287395,2016-04-11,0,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I always enjoy the Shabu Shabu here at Swish. The service here is an A-. When it gets a little busy, they do take a bit longer to bring out the ingredients needed to get started. For those not familiar with the Shabu Shabu process, it does take some time before you can start eating. 

Just to give you a brief walk through: 

First, you want to heat your stock up. As your stock is boiling, you want to add carrots and onions first because they take longer to cook through. Later, you can throw in the rest of the veggies as you cook and enjoy the meat of your choice.

Next, you want to build your sauce with mustard, ponzu, garlic, chili paste and onions. The key to building a great dipping sauce is adding a little of each ingredient to your own taste preference. DO NOT copy what your friends are doing because each person has their own taste preference (e.g. some prefer more garlic, some prefer an immense amount of heat). If you've never done this before, building the perfect sauce can take time. But it is worth doing it right the first time so it's easier and less time consuming the next time you visit. They give you a raw egg with the sauce. Add the yolk to your sauce and blend well. Some people prefer not to add the egg, but I love it because of the texture it adds to the sauce. 

Next, take a single slice of meat and dip in your boiling broth. 10-15 seconds in the broth will cook the meat all the way through. Then you can dip it in your sauce and eat it with rice. 

When you're done with your portion of meat, you can throw in your egg whites in the stock and enjoy your soup. They also give you a small portion of noodles to cook in your stock. 

Shabu Shabu is certainly one hell of an eating experience you will never forget. Every meal is different and I am always learning new ways to make my dining experience more enjoyable. It is one of those meals that definitely forces you to take your time. And I guess the anticipation of prepping your food makes the food taste better (if that makes any sense). 

Swish is definitely top notch for service. If you visit, don't be ashamed to ask questions because they will happily help you and offer advice. 

I know this is a bit long, so I'm going to just give you a quick recommendation on what I like here at Swish.

However, I was dissappointed in such a small plate of veggies (only cabbage, a few noodles, 2 pieces of green onion and tofu and blahh, oh come on .. seriously...). The portion was so small too.

What I ordered was prime-rib hungry, but it did not seem like a hungry portion at all. So I had to order an extra plate of meat which made my single bill almost $ 31.

The customer service was just awful, I was sitting on the table for about 15 mins without anything to drink. The servers did not even care I came and didnt even say Hi. Plus, since there were a lot of customers with only one server, I was even sorry to ask the server to give me some sauces or condiments cuz everytime I am looking for her, she is not there.

The meat grades here a great, I recommended the Kobe chuck for nice marbling.  I was wanting la-yu chili oil and shichimi seasoning to add extra spice to the meat itself, not sure if they had it but i was too hungry to ask.  The amount of food they served with the meat was just right, you don't want to overload on carbs with traditional shabu shabu.  I'd go for the miso or spicy miso broth, unless you know what you are doing.  The seaweed broth is served with kombu which is supposed to be removed at boiling point, and you need to fancy up the ponzu and sesame sauces to give the meat the right complementary flavor.

I was in heaven.  I ordered sushi, but the sushi SUCKED.  The roll was drowned in bland sauce, and the tempura tasted frozen.  Stick to the shabu or sukiyaki here, and let less adventurous friends settle for sushi if they want to.

I'm kind of glad they didn't have alcohol, but offering iced coffee or beer at least would be nice.  But yeah, alcohol would just fill you up and ruin the flavor adventure.

My husband and I came by here for lunch the day after Christmas because we wanted something warm on that chilly day. As soon as we walked in (around 12:45 pm), we were greeted by a male employee (whom I think was the manager or possibly the owner). He seated us at a table and handed up menus. We ended up getting:

Edamame- Normally $3.45 prior to tax, but we scored an order of this for free with Yelp check in (it pays to check in people!). They salted these and provided a bowl to dump the shell. I think I would prefer these to not be salted but I have never been to a restaurant that does not salt these prior to serving. Anyways, they were standard, but pretty good. 

Chicken Sukiyaki (4 oz, lunch portion), $8.95 prior to tax- I wasn't too hungry so I opted for the lunch portion. And I thought the 4 oz portion was more than enough for me and my husband actually had 1/2 of it (since I wasn't that hungry). All of the shabu menu items come with a plate of raw vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, carrots, a few small cubes of tofu), udon and rice. This is definitely plenty of food for lunch and a good price. The sukiyaki in general was good, but a little on the salty side. I had to add water to my bowl to dilute it a bit.

Prime Rib Eye (6 oz, healthy portion), $14.95 prior to tax- My husband decided to order the smaller portion (8 oz, hungry portion is $18.95 prior to tax by the way) for lunch. Just like my lunch, his came with a plate of vegetables, udon and rice. He liked his prime rib eye. 

Herbal Tea, $2.45 prior to tax- Because I was still cold and also I had a scratchy throat (The cold just doesn't agree with me) I decided to order a tea. However, this tea is just from the can and so it is served cold. But the employee who seated us said he could heat it up for me (they do serve green tea that is heated but I don't like green tea). And so he brought out my tea in a teacup, wrapped in a napkin so that I would not burn my hand when holding it. This tea tasted really good and wished I had more (I used to drink this tea when I was kid). This type of tea can be purchased at any Chinese market (probably could get some at the market that is in this plaza).
----------------------
(Total= $28.29 after tax, prior to tip)

When we first made our lunch order, we had requested for hot water. Our hot water was brought out in plastic cups. You shouldn't put hot food or beverages in plastic. So we didn't bother to drink it. This is why I decided to order some tea to warm up (even though I had shabu, I wasn't getting warm enough). 

Service was friendly and quite attentive. This other server who was also waiting on us got my husband another bowl of rice (free of charge) and also refilled my husband's ice water beverage. 

Food was good and wait time for all that we needed to have shabu was not long. 

The ladies' restroom was clean upon this visit.

Would come back here again (just don't order the hot water and don't forget to check in for your free order of edamame).

We entered the place and it felt underwhelming from the start.  The restaurant is nothing more than 4 painted walls, a bar, and some tables.  We were seated and we took a look at the menu.

Swish menu: http://www.swishlasvegas.com/menu.htm

To be honest, it is not the easiest menu to read and they use terms like healthy and hungry instead of small and large portions.  My buddy and I have been binge eating all week so we weren't that hungry so we opted for the healthy size.

The food came out decently fast and she turned on our burners.  They use the can of gas burners here and ours didn't run out but i can see that happening and being awkward.  But the food was just mediocre. The sauces seemed very salty and to me it just was very blah.

The healthy serving size is really healthy.  My buddy does not have a large appetite but even he was ready for round two of dinner after we left swish.. I guess if you are dying for shabu shabu in Las Vegas you should try here, but i've been to shabu shabu places that are much better than here.

Healthy, clean flavors resonate from this restaurant that moved from summerlin to Chinatown.  Now that I've had the opportunity to try shabu shabu (lite broth) compared to sukiyaki (rich and more intense soy flavored reduction) I enjoyed the sukiyaki flavors more.  
On this particular field trip I ordered the shrimp with sweet soy & coconut crystals as a first course.  Good dish to start with.  Coconut wasn't too intense of a flavor surprisingly.  I want to try other appetizers on my next visit but this will be an old standby when I need a safe bet in the future.
Sukiyaki was the main course except
they were out of the Kobe chuck.  The great thing about sukiyaki is you control the flavors of your sauce and temps of your meat & veggies.  If you don't like it, blame that person looking at you in the bathroom mirror...You made it sucker!!
 
I can't wait to go back for lunch again.  Portions and prices are great, service is above average.  It's easy to go to Swish Han Solo or fun to go with a significant other.

The time with a groupon, came here for lunch. Had only 1 other table besides us. Granted this was mid-afternoon. Ordered a prime rib-eye and a mushroom party (friend was a mushroom fanatic so that was a must have for her). Sukiyaki style. Was a different experience from the traditional chinese hot pot. never had sukiyaki this way before. Cooked it in a cast iron pan thing with sauce. Flavor not too bad. May be a little sweet/salty for me. Overall, good deal with the groupon

Second time was for a friends birthday during dinner time. Check in for free hot sake (first time having hot sake so WHY NOT!? LOL) Sake was well.. warm alcohol so uhh... nothing to say about that HAHA (not much of a drinker anyway... wanted to try at least once anyway)

Ordered a salmon shabu shabu in a spicy miso broth. Comes with a lot of veggies, tofu, and udon noodles. Decent amount overall. Not that much salmon (maybe 10 pieces if memory serves me right...) Not filling for me. Broth was light (before i added a bunch of green onions and garlic to it MMM GARLIC). I guess i can call this a healthier version of hot pot vs the chinese one with a heavy spicy broth. Guess in a way it was my wallet that limited me but eh..

I've been a loyal customer for about 7 years and they would always give me a loyalty discount upon every visit, which was always incredible!

It was explained that the owner does not honor this and would not be applied. What?!? So we asked to speak to someone (manager). The waiter further explained owner was not there that he already called them once earlier and was yelled at and would not want to be called again. Waiter also explained that on another bill with a Groupon the owner took the difference from his pay check. What?!?  Then why are you still actively still showing up on Groupon if you are not honoring it?? (I pulled it up to show him)
Shame on Swish. Shame on that owner. We were very excited to come back. But we were also looking forward to our Groupon discount. Prior to ordering or maybe on the door/table there should be a sign saying ""No honoring Groupons"".

This place offers shabu shabu style vs. sukiyaki and from what I know it's just the difference in the cooking broth- so essentially you get all your food raw/uncooked and you cook it on the burner at your table. Walking inside here is like stepping into the steam of the broth to heaven. It smells fantastic and gives you warm fuzzy feelings. 

This last time I stopped in however, it was alright nothing that would bring me back most-definitely. I've been here a couple times prior and I remember the sukiyaki being so much more potent and savory. 

This time around, it just felt like there wasn't much flavor, no matter how long I left the veggies/protein in there. 

I got the salmon plate which came with veggies: napa cabbage, mushrooms, udon noodles, carrots, green onions, and tofu, and a side of raw salmon for $12.95. I didn't really leave satisfied. It was good for what it is. The salmon however, was fresh. I even ate most of them like sashimi!

So I had some issues with the faux Swish in another location, and was invited here after that epic Groupon fiasco but never got around to it until today. 

Well I am so sorry that I waited. This Swish is absolutely fabulous! (It also helps that I can go down the street for a Trader Joe's run afterward...) My husband and I both ordered the vegetarian platter and shared an order of edamame. The young woman who was serving us was very helpful and personable, and I loved that they brought all the condiments to you so you can more into the hot pot to your liking. She gave me a very healthy dose of garlic so I refrained from adding anything else. 

This vegetarian dish was HUGE! It was one gigantic plate filled with lettuce, mushrooms, baby corn, carrots, noodles, a little tofu, onion, and green onion. Although it was bountiful, I would have personally liked maybe some zucchini, some extra tofu and a bit more mushrooms than the extreme amount of lettuce on top. Just my preference ;) It was really good though and I liked that the hot pot was right on the table and was in very easy reach. This also came with white rice which was deliciously sticky. I would have preferred brown, but white was good too. The edamame we had as a side dish was tasty. 

I cannot even begin to tell you just how full I was - well, am! It's been a few hours since eating and I am still pleasantly stuffed to the brim!

How many restaurants workers these days remember their customer's by name and talk to them outside of work? Not many, but they do! And it's not because I go every week. Truthfully, with my schedule, I can only get there once every 3 to 4 months, but my friends, family and I look forward to it every time! The food portions are GREAT for the price.  I noticed one person complained that they didn't get enough food for the price, but I think that is due to American portion sizing expectations. lol, compared to the rest of the world, we over-stuff ourselves. 

**The food~ I have tried everything there from t he Kobe Chuck, Kobe Ribeye, to the seafood platter and chicken platter. My Good Old reliable favorite is the Prime Rib Eye, Healthy size, Sukiyaki! Don't get me wrong, I like Shabu Shabu (cooked in water) too, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Sukiyaki sauce! It is their own special blend and it is SUPREMELY flavorful! I have been completely unsuccessful in my efforts to duplicate it though.. lol. They give you a hearty portion of veggies, rice noodles and meats. My personal recommendation- When you choose to cook your noodles, wait until the broth has reduced a little bit, then leave your noodles in the reduced broth for a few minutes to absorb the extra numminess flavoring.  All their food is FRESH!!

*Now the staff~ they are AWESOME! They are always there when ever you have a question or just want another glass of water. I have never had anything more than a 10 second wait, and even the other waiters come to check up on you too, so every one helps every one else there. 

**ONE WARNING** They used to have a location on W Sahara, and due to landlord issues, they moved down to China Town. However the former landlord has decided to take up using the Swish name and logo, but the quality and service CANNOT match the original's! So, if you have a bad experience on W Sahara, I assure you, that company is NOT related at all to the Original Swish, locate on Spring Mountain road.

We came with a large group of people, probably around 12 people and there was just one guy helping us out. I think there was a second one somewhere doing something else. The food came out slowly.. I'm assuming there's only one person preparing in the kitchen as well.

They serve you your pot on a portable gas stove that goes out sometimes. I would suggest to change these out.

I got the spicy miso with hungry portion of the regular beef.
The broth was just okay, I felt like they got the soup base and just dumped some hot sauce into it. The beef was slightly below average in quality. The beef slowly breaks apart as it starts to cook. 
The veggie dish was just okay as well. 
Udon quality isnt very good.
The sauces were also just okay. 

There was a check in offer for a free sake or 2 piece sushi, we chose the sushi.. quality is very poor.. skip this! The ""sweet shrimp"" was actually just the normal shrimp. So they have both shrimps listed but both shrimps are the same. PASSSSSS

I thought I could flavor it by adding garlic and radish but the garlic was an old yellow.   Next the dipping sauces were also flavorful but in a bad way. The Shabu sauce tasted like straight up vinegar with just a little bit of soy sauce and the other sauce was a like a sweet pudding.  We let you he waitress know that we have been coming for years and the taste is different and she said it has been the same cook even though there is a sign that says under new ownership.

Service was HORRIBLE had to get up myself for many things sauce/Fork, spoons etc. Server didn't even know what name of fish they had lol.
Food was unappealing dry like not fresh, Chicken was cheap bulk with fat on it ewww, Not much to choose from either they bring you a plate for the all you can eat not good, unlike my favorite place Shabu Grill on Silverado and Maryland  you get to choose your own from fridges and wrap buffet 99% more food best place ever wish we went there, you would also A+

no wonder this place was empty. 
asked for check after while got it, and said $74 with everything tax etc that's  without Groupon!.

I like how the check in gives you free edamame so remember to check in!!
My favorite is the sukiyaki omg I love how they give you a whole bottle of sukiyaki sauce if you run out in your pot!
They offer you a pretty good portion of veggies for your pot and you don't have to share your veggies with your friend, they get their own haha 
I love to order the mushroom party and a plate of ribeye with the dipping egg sauce.

The server explained the steps and started the preparation for me (excellent service!). The aroma of sesame oil, garlic, scallions, and chili cooking on the skillet was amazing!!

When the sukiyaki sauce was added, and when it started to sizzle, I knew this was going to be special. I added the beef and cooked for couple of seconds (as instructed before) and took a bite. I have to say I love Japanese food, but I had never had a flavor like this before. Beef was tender, and it soaked up the sauce from the skillet just perfectly. The egg added perfect texture and flavor to sukiyaki. I really loved the experience. It was fun, interactive and delicious!

The first time I came here, I arrived right about the time they opened.  This turned out to be a good thing.  By the time my friends and I were finishing up with our leisure lunch, the place was filling up quickly and nicely.

The layout is waaay cool.  A large U shaped counter sits in the middle of the room.  Sitting out the outer edges, your server will provide you with a gas grill and give you your choice of shabu shabu or sukiyaki.  Or, loosely translated - wet (soupy) or dry meal (grilled)?  You get to 'swish' your food yourself.  If you give a stupid enough look, your server might be as sympathetic as mine and help you out with the cooking.  Luckily, I've done this before, so no stupid looks here!  At least, not in regards to getting my cook on.

Being from OC, I've had great tasting Shabu in Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, and LA.  I figured LV should be comparable.  To my surprise, this place definitely disappointed when it came to taste.

1.  The decor of the restaurant was decent.  It was bad or anything, but nothing stood out that made me like the place.  NO ONE was in the restaurant, I mean NO ONE!  We were the only people there so they were attentative.

2.  The service was good, though I can't be a critic because no one else was there.  

3.  The food was decent.  I mean it wasn't the best shabu.  They have Kobe Chuck and Kobe Prime Rib that you can Choose.  We chose the Kobe Chuck with an add on of USDA Prime Rib.  The slices of Kobe Chuck were huge!  One slice of the chuck was the same as 2 USDA Prime Rib slices.  We weren't too starving so the amount of meat for us was more than enough.  They cooked great and easy.  The dipping sauces were good as well, it got the job done.  As were were finishing up, I asked for the soup base so we can use it for our udon noodles.  They brought us canned soup base that we had to mix ourselves: beef broth, tom yom, or chicken broth.  Sorry to say, it was a disappointment in flavor.  It's not at all on the same level as the broth from California Shabu Shabu.

For being in Vegas it's actually pretty good, but compared to other places that I have been it's ok, especially for the price. 

We came for dinner on a Saturday night and it wasn't crowded at all. Be sure to check in on Yelp so that you can get the check in offer of free hot sake or 2 piece nigiri sushi. I chose the nigiri sushi and got the super white tuna (pretty good) and my friend also checked in and got the hamachi (also pretty good). Not the best sushi, but for a place that doesn't specialize in sushi, it was worth the free offer.

I went for the shabu shabu dinner - they have a variety of meats that you can choose from and different grades of beef - for shabu it is on the pricier side - 8 oz for $18.95 of the regular beef (especially when you can get all you can eat in SF for $29.95 - maybe I should recommend this to them). They also have a few selections of broths - I chose my usual favorite of spicy miso. The flavor of the broth was good and the quality of the meat was good too. I think they could give you more of a selection of vegetables (and maybe just plain more vegetables). It comes on a small plate and definitely not a lot of it - cabbage, 2 pieces of broccoli, a few carrots, and 1 mushroom cut up (just regular mushroom, not enoki or any other kind).

-Friendly service

-While the service was friendly, it was painfully slow at times
-The meat was not fresh. By its dark red color, you could tell that it had been cut in advance and stored in the fridge before it was served to us.

The place was plain. The first thing I noticed when we sat down was that they had condiment settings that are normally used for things like chili sauce filled with what looked like grated ginger or garlic, scallions, and onions. I said to my boyfriend that these could've been sitting out all day. I glanced at a table to the left of the bar and there were a bunch of these condiment sets sitting there, probably never used since they took 'em out of the fridge because no one comes here (it was pretty dead). Hmm.

Next, I was looking at their menu and I was fairly disappointed. Everything just seemed to cost so much more than it should've. When the waitress came to take our order, my boyfriend told her what we wanted, but she turned to me and asked what I wanted. My boyfriend was like, ""We're going to share."" I started to wonder if the portions were supposed to be for each person. If so, then I felt like everything was overpriced. When we got the food, we were able to share it just fine (though my boyfriend ate most of it and I am hungry now, a few hours later). At the end of the meal, I still felt like we overpaid. Our meal was $23. If we hadn't split what the waitress implied was supposed to be a meal for a single person, then it would've been too much, imo. We just had hot pot at this great place in Rowland Heights, CA (called Kingswood Teppan Steak House, if you're ever in the area) and we had way more food and broth (two kinds, too) for $32. We had two different kinds of broth, four ingredients (chicken, beef, mushrooms, vegetables), and there was fried rice for each of us. Since it seems we split a single meal, we only got one bowl of white rice. The $9 difference would've only gotten us... I think probably just the side of chicken (it was like $6.95 or something) and we would have a couple bucks leftover that wouldn't have paid for anything else. I wasn't happy with the prices.

As I mentioned before, it was pretty dead when we got there. After finishing our meal and reading the reviews, I was not surprised. I've had hot pot before, but this is my first time having it in Las Vegas. I'm hoping better places exist. I may just have to start having hot pot at home when I get cravings.

I can't recommend this place nor do I ever plan on coming back.",Ylnzp7o02wCziyMdHmN8Tw,1,1,1,SScsYJCGJQSNQrfHTlDvDA

2619305,2015-04-24,25,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I was avoiding this restaurant like a tourist car pileup on the strip because I thought that it was run by the same owner as the Swish on Sahara (I gave Swish on Sahara a scathing 1 star review for being inauthentic and just plain terrible.)

Good news! They don't have the same owner (anymore) and they are dishing out reliable and comforting shabu shabu. This Swish location also offers legit hot drops and great tasting ponzu and goma sauce. They always give us more than enough food and I don't feel like I'm getting robbed with paper thin slices of meat or tiny bits of dry veggies.

The shabu shabu never fails here but I also love their sukiyaki option. The broth is definitely on the salty/sweet end, but you can always dilute it by adding some water and it'll be perfect. I always get a large ribeye and it comes with a generous amount of veggies and rice. I also love that they typically offer a complimentary salmon nigiri with yelp check-in! The salmon is always fatty, fresh and sweet every time I come. They use great quality fish so I'm sure their sushi selection is great too! The appetizers are also pretty tasty, I recommend ordering the jalapeño firecracker - they hook it up with lots of toppings and it's really flavorful. 

True this isn't the best shabu I've ever had - I've had much better in California and homemade. But there's a real shortage of great shabu restaurants in Vegas and this place comes pretty close. The service is always top notch and the food always satisfies! We frequent this location and love it!

Pro tip: Ask for the hot drops! But don't complain about it if you can't hang. ;p",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,28,27,5,keNyuONDCgK1c0kVMTZjSw

This was our first time out as a family having Shabu Shabu--aka ""hot pot"", and I'd have to say that it was a success. 

I ordered the Shabu Shabu, with spicy miso broth, a ""hungry"" 8 oz. serving of salmon and an a la carte order of the Mushroom Party. My only gripe about my food, was that my salmon wasn't as fresh as it could have been and did have a taste that gave me the impression that it was frozen at one point. 

The assortment of mushrooms in the Mushroom Party were fresh and earthy, just as they should have been. And I love me some mushrooms! 

Aside from the fish being frozen, this place could have easily nabbed 5 stars from me. Maybe next time I'll try the Kobe Beef and that'll change my 4-star rating to a perfect 5. 

Until next time, definitely try this place out and you won't be disappointed! 

I know I'll be back again.",CT0eM6ERMiZ1VgVBHtSuHg,1,1,4,XYHDroIyoZqF-6pk7rCPoQ
2639385,2015-07-05,8,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"My family and I come here often for shabu shabu. It's tucked away in the same plaza of SF market and right underneath Bazic. The layout of the restaurant is somewhat off. All the tables are scattered everywhere, but it's nice to be able to sit at a 8-top table when it's only the three of us. 

Service can be a hit or miss. The times we've been there, it's been a miss. The place was busy and attentiveness lacked so much that we got up to get our own condiments that we asked a few times for. Sometimes, even getting a menu could take a awhile. There was also a time when they forgot about our rice and I waved my hand in the air, but the staff that looked dead at me just didn't care. I was like damn he's faking the funk game is stuuurdy, real sturdy. It can get frustrating at times. When the service is a hit.. it's a wonderful experience here. Everything comes all at once, drinks are refilled, rice is given without being asked. So it's all about chance here.

We usually get the Kobe Chuck, hungry portion that comes with a small amount of sliced white onion, mushroom, tofu, cabbage, broccoli, green onion, and udon noodles. I love their dipping sauces which are a ponzu-based sauce for your veggies/noodles and the goma sesame-based sauce for your meat. I add the minced daikon, garlic, and green onion from the condiments selection to my ponzu sauce to intensify the flavor. I also add garlic and green onion to my goma sauce to give my meat the same effect. Delicious. If you don't get your white rice or condiments by the time your meat and veggies are done.. Ask for it! 

I highly suggest to avoid the soy milk broth. There isn't any flavor whatsoever and it's so translucent that it's almost all seaweed broth with a sake shot of soy milk. I was looking for more of a heavy cream based broth as in all soy milk not half or a shot of. I stick with the Spicy Miso Broth, which has the most flavor from the three of Seaweed, Spicy Miso, and Soy Milk. 

The technique for shabu shabu is to you its own. I prefer to use half my tofu/cabbage/mushroom/broccoli portion, all my white onion/green onion, and save the udon noodles at the very end. While the veggies are almost done, I swish one by one my Kobe Chuck slice, then dip it in the goma sauce and get a veggie.. dip it in my ponzu, then combine both (meat/veggie) with my white rice and there you have the magic of shabu shabu. Lastly, I save my udon noodles for the broth that had everything boiled in it. Think seasoning the broth for a soup ;)

Shabu shabu is soul food at its best. I always leave here with a smile on my face. It's therapeutic, yet fun at the same time. Love the music they play here. Top 90's, Reggae, and some old school like Sinatra got me movin' while I'm swishing away. Keith Sweat - I'll Give All My Love To You... Ready For The World - Love You Down just to name a few. Dining here with music that I love is a plusplusplus!

Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.. I can always go for Shabu Shabu whenever. That's how much I love it. It's one of my favorite cuisine! And Swish is our Family's favorite place for it.",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,8,8,5,bY5oC47HgCD5pnxI9Id6Ig

2750194,2016-07-17,0,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"Vegan review:

We got a groupon to Swish and were really excited to try the offerings. 

This was the first time I had suki yaki and I highly recommend it over shabu! There is a vegan shabu broth option though if you are interested. The waitress prepared the suki yaki by adding garlic, hot sauce, and green onions to a hot dish over a burner. Then, she added a ponzu, mirin and soy sauce mixture into the dish. I got the veggie portion ($8.95) which was a really healthy amount of food. It came with napa cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, udon noodles, broccoli plus a bowl of rice. Definitely very filling and generous portions. 

Things are much more expensive for meat eaters. My brother got a ""hungry portion"" (8oz) of prime rib-eye PLUS an a la carte portion (4oz) of the prime rib-eye. His meat came with a side of veggies/udon and bowl of rice, but he gave me his veggies. He polished off all the meat and rice and was sufficiently full. 

The veggie sushi:
The veggie roll (not tempura veggie roll) was just avocado and cucumber, so I didn't think it was worth $6. The avocado roll (not on the menu) is also $6 which was crazy. The sushi rice did not have sushi seasoning and was mushy. It was fine though, but I prefer the suki yaki for sure.

Vegans can eat here for less than $10. Others can eat here for $10-$30.

Service:
The waitress was so helpful in helping me figure out what was vegan and what wasn't (the sauces, broths, etc). She was friendly and just awesome!",w1Kx0pLwThUc9CmwP8UWRg,2,1,5,rxMPcCAqxUDtCofNlTZZOA

First off, when we entered the building, nobody greeted us or acknowledged our existence for a good seven minutes. If you know anything about good customer service this is a red flag. It took them a good while to ""clean"" and set up the table for us which we didn't mind. When we were seated, we noticed the table was still wet, sticky, and disgusting. We had to use the napkins on the table to finish cleaning it up ourselves. The server didn't do such a good job at explaining the menu to us since it was our first time, it really felt like she knew almost nothing about the food here lol. After ordering, we waited, and waited, and waited. By now I was getting irritated because there was only a total of 3 small families in the restaurant which I didn't understand why it took them so long to bring the food out just so we can cook it ourselves. Usually when you bring food out, you should try to bring them all out at the same time, after awhile they only brought us lettuce and a small plate of thinly sliced beef. They had also brought out the two plates of mushroom that we had ordered but ended up giving those to the family next to us. COME ON, SERIOUSLY. We waited some more and they brought out a plate of assorted seafood. The funny thing is by now, we still haven't gotten our bowls of rice or noodles to eat along with the rest of the food. wtf. At least bring us small empty bowls so we could have scooped our food into it. Not once did they apologize for taking so damn long to bring us our food. When they finally brought us our rice, they only brought two bowls. There were six of us. Now, I'm just really trying to keep my cool. By the time we were done eating, they still haven't brought out my brother's roll of sushi, so we just cancelled it. I was pissed because it was my idea to take the family out to eat for once and ended up going to this place. We ended up paying $80 for a small plate of beef, a small plate of seafood, and some mushroom, with a side of terrible customer service. A word of advice to the owners of this place, retrain your employees and brush up on your management skills along with your customer service skills. It's embarrassing, really. Don't waste your time and money here.

 *  Ask if they have any new flavors for their Sukiyaki.  
 * Don't be scared to adjust how much broth you use or the level of fire.

  When you combine good eats with good service, you can't go wrong.  This place has it all!  Not only was our service really friendly, but he was very informative and answered any question we had about menu items.  He even gave us a little breakdown when it came to Shabu Shabu and Sukiyaki.   We ended up ordering both and really had a chance to taste the differences in cooking styles / broth.  The pricing for Swish is really decent too.  They even have lunch specials for you early birds.  Everyone at the table gets a burner (if needed, depending on what you order) and the seating is quite spacious.  The overall ambiance of the restaurant was calming as the interior was red in color.  If you happen to be dining along, there is also a bar area with flat screen televisions for your viewing pleasure.

I feel that the food is decent, but nothing special, also their plate of veggie is small as heck, like three pieces of carrots and an inch cube of tofu and like two slurps of udons... wtf, you'd think that the veggie are expensive as heck but no, it's just napa cabbage man. In the seafood plate they have some of the smallest scallops ever, I feel that for the price, it shouldn't be that small...
There's no service when I went there either, all they did was to give us menu, the drink, then brought the food then nothing. Had to wait like 15 mins for to find someone for the check and another 10 to bring it... and it wasn't even busy when we were there. (Just one other table)

We were a bit hesitant, worried Swish would be touristy or not authentic, but we were more than satisfied with the choice.  Our reservation was early, and probably wasn't necessary, but good to know they take them.  

We went traditional: the Kobe Ribeye (hungry size...8 oz).  The meat was BEAUTIFUL, great marbling, very thinly sliced, amazing flavor.  Each of us were served a very nice helping of veggies, tofu and udon, as well as a bowl of rice and the two dipping sauces: ponzu and goma.  There were also, of course, negi (green onion) and  daikon to add if you preferred.  We also chose the Mushroom Party, which came with a number of different varieties, and was also a generous portion.  

Our server was helpful, but not intrusive, checking on us from time to time and adjusting the heat of our tabletop burner.

We opted for the mushroom platter and the salmon since they were out of the shrimp when we went there this weekend.  We also got both the traditional shabu shabu (it looks like water but it's actually a seaweed infused broth) and suki-yaki (sort of like a watered-down version of teriyaki), to get the best of both worlds.  When the food came (various veggies, udon and tofu accompany every order), our server was more than happy to answer all the questions that shabu-shabu novices (like us) would ask... a smile on his face the entire time!  The salmon suki-yaki came out on top though I have a feeling that as our palates become more refined, we would prefer shabu shabu to the suki-yaki.

All in all, a good meal with good service.  It is expensive for food that you have to prepare yourself (our total bill came to about $80 including 1 beer and 2 4oz glasses of sake) but it's worth it for something a little different that's also healthy.",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,1,0,4,vaEPG6An-CqfyD0OCajvew

Then the regulars/friends came in and started eating. I figure more people come here for dinner though. The ambiance was dark and intimate. There is a bar area where you can sit or many tables that seat about 2-4 people. When we sat down at a table for two, the waiter asked me if a wanted a chair for my purse. Let me repeat that...A CHAIR FOR MY PURSE. Well f*ck yes my purse would love a chair! I don't think I've ever been asked that in my whole history of dining. My boyfriend and I were both a little taken aback when he asked me that. 

We started off with the Crispy Garlic Chicken ($7.95), which was phenomenal. The chicken was crispy, juicy and garlicky and the sauce was just oozing with all sorts of flavors. We were originally going to get the calamari, but if there's one thing we love more than calamari, it's garlic. After being schooled on the difference between Sukiyaki and Shabu Shabu, I opted for  healthy size (6oz) prime rib-Eye Sukiyaki ($14.95) and my boyfriend got hungry size (8oz) prime rib-Eye Shabu Shabu ($18.95) in their new Spicy Miso broth. These both came with a small bowl of rice and a plate of veggies, udon, and tofu. This was actually my first time ever having Sukiyaki, so I don't have much to base it off of, but I still found it to be pretty damn delicious. My boyfriend actually enjoyed the Sukiyaki more than the Shabu Shabu because it was just so flavorful, although a lot less healthy than the Shabu. The waiter told us to wait until the sauce got a little thick because it would make it have more flavor, so everytime I took out the cooked meat, it was drenched with all kids of goodness. The Shabu Shabu was okay, but just boring compared to the Sukiyaki. I'm sure if I tried the Shabu first, I would've liked it more, but my taste buds were spoiled from he awesome Sukiyaki. 

*Tips
-Ask them what flavors they have for their Shabu Shabu broth. When we went they had Spicy Miso and for an extra buck, you could also get soy.
-Lately, there have been a lot of Groupon Now deals for this place, so you should definitely check that out before arriving. We got a Groupon a few months ago, so our bill only came out to $17 for all that!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,19,14,5,Gp5ttZX8WvI423Xt4os6-g

I preferred the nutty, creamy, and slightly-sweet coma sauce over the ponzu sauce which was a little too salty. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and was stuffed.

Took almost another 45 minute before we see any foods. We made order of skewers. We got a plate with one skewer on it. Services here are bad. Only three big table including ours and four other table open. I will not refer people here at all. Best going other places with better foods and better services. Many items were out. But honestly I think this place does such bad services. On going almost two hours and they still have not completed what we order. Waited 30 minute and my free check in soda still not arrive.

It was the cheapest meat I have ever eaten, I am not a fan of complaining at a restaurant so I went with it...  as I was putting in my cabbage I noticed black specks all over it and I think it was moldy.  I showed the waitress and she replaced it with some fresh cabbage, about half way through the new cabbage again showed up the moldy looking cabbage.  

The staff has always been great to be around, I think that the low volume of people in the restaurant has an impact on the food quality.  

I told my friend who was visiting from out of town that I will not be eating there again.  Nothing against the staff or the owner, I just really like to eat great quality food.

I'm so happy I tried this because it is soo addictive. My girlfriend and I have been here twice in one week and plan to go again! :)

When you get your hot pot they pour in the sauce for the sukiyaki, they also give you a plate of veggies w/ noodles and also your plate of thinly sliced beef (if you choose beef that is) when the hot pot is heated you dip the meat in the sauce to let it cook and once its done you take it out, dip it into the raw egg and eat it with rice.

Swish Shabu Shabu now operates only in their Chinatown location as a new owner has bought out the Sahara location. My friend and I have been wanting to try Shabu Shabu recently and we were lucky to stumble upon this location. 

Confessional booth time: I just found out what Shabu Shabu was. I honestly thought it was just hot pot, but boy was I wrong! This meal is like kbbq meats (see what I did there?) hot pot meets soup. Having learned it's the sound it makes when you swish the food in the pot, we were excited to try it for ourselves.We even tried the traditional raw egg dip. You can find out more about shabu shabu and sukiyaki if you just ask them. I think they love newbies. Just make sure you get the spicy miso.

So the first thing you need to do is check-in and either get a free serving of edamame of a soft drink. Next, decide what at meat to get. Now, it is my personal belief that an 8 oz portion is good enough to share between two people if you treat the meal as a soup, especially with all the vegetables and small serving of udon noodles. As a pescatarian/sometimes-vegetarian, I enjoy the 8 oz of salmon for $15.95. First off, where can you get 8 oz of essentially salmon sashimi-style for $15.95? It gets even cheaper at lunch time and if you just want chicken sukiyaki, it's $12.95. You'll sure be full, especially after the napa cabbage, carrots, onion, button mushroom, and tofu slices. 

Service is generally good. I always have to ask for a refill or make eye-contact with a server to get their attention. It seems like there's one server and 3 helpers/bussers/cooks who cannot function in a waiter/server capacity due to a business model, but I guess that's on them. 

If you're in the area, I recommend coming here. They sure won't disappoint.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,4,4,5,8JxQATjf77qpH1LHmzIjsg

There's also sukiyaki, where you cook the meat in a more shallow pot of sauce/broth.  There's not much more to it.  They serve you raw vegetables and meat, and then you basically just cook it yourself in their broth.  It was delicious, but I think it's a bit over-priced for shabu shabu/sukiyaki.  However, I don't see any place like this around Vegas.  The place is small with a U-shaped counter.  I couldn't really talk with our group much.  The decor is clean with just one TV on one side of the room.  Guess where us guys sat.  On the side where you're able to watch the NBA game haha.

Service is requiring much improvement. Waited quite awhile until our order was taken and for our food to arrive to our table. Noticed that multiple tables were not cleared for awhile. Water was not refilled once. I had asked a question to two different servers about our order and neither one seemed to speak english very well. Lastly, it took 15 minutes before I could grab someones attention for our check and then waited another 15 minutes hoping we'd receive our check. Finally, I walked up to the front to get it and pay. I noticed other tables were equally frustrated with the lack of service. There were at least 3 other tables that had to walk up to ask for a check as well.

Service was horrible! We came on a busy night so I wasn't expecting amazing service in the first place. When we got our order, they forgot 1 portion of the vegetables which wasn't a big deal. But then two of the three burners died, we had to ask two servers to refill our drinks and had to ask two servers to get an extra menu since one friend arrived late.

At first she was skittish by the thought of cooking your own raw meat but she was quickly assured by the amazingly healthy process of it all. We were seated and given drinks promptly. They never do have the White Peach Tea but I was fine with Raspberry because they are another Asian restaurant with very aged Sweet n Low/Splenda that is hard as a rock so no go on their Iced Tea.

But beyond that, our food came lightning quick to compensate. We ordered the sukiyaki water this time for more flavour upon the servers suggestion who was also very patient with my shallow understand of how shabu works exactly (this was only my 2nd time), and she seems confused by us wanting to share one boiler for two meats and veggie plates and it only hit me why later because the boilers are pretty small but I just didn't want them to charge me more for two boilers. Alas, should have just asked but all wisdom is in hindsight!
I also ordered us a Baked Salmon Roll for sushi and then the salmon healthy portion with a Kobe chuck healthy portion which was plenty of food. At first you never think so coz you arrive starving but we were stuffed to the gills.
I did feel bad for leaving such a messy table and tried to clean up for the staff because they were so polite and attentive to us even with three or four families there by the time we left.
I definitely suggest the Dinner groupon for $40 off your bill which you buy for $27. Not only do you save $13 but with what we ordered very little was left over.

3954940,2011-06-30,3,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I haven't had much experience whne it comes to Shabu Shabu, but I know quality when I experience it.  I have only been to Shabu Shabu Paradise in Henderson, so unfortunately I have no other basis for comparison. 

I had just gotten the Groupon deal and decided that it was a healthy option that I wanted to try out for dinner.

When we got there, though, there were only 3 other tables occupied at about 5:30pm on a Friday.  

The menu, though, was awesome--meats, meat sampler, seafood, and chicken.  My boyfriend and I were hungry, so we each opted for the bigger/hungry size portions (8 oz. meat, roughly 15 slices).  For those of you not too hungry, you may want to try the smaller/healthy size portion (6 oz. of meat, roughly 10 slices).  You also get a variety of sides, along with white rice.   

Unlike Shabu Shabu Paradise, the burner isn't built into the table, but is a portable unit where you get a bowl and some vegetables/tofu/noodles (sides) to cook.  The type of broth, though, is where the cooking differs.  For those of you that prefer less seasoning/plain eating, choose Shabu Shabu.  If you like Soy Sauce, though, definitely go for the Sukiyaki.  I opted for the Shabu Shabu, since I tend to like my food more on the plain side (sensitive stomach).

Also, they do give you more seasoning options, such as dipping sauces--peanut-based and ponzu, as well as other ingredients (garlic, scallions, chili sauce) to make an altogether different sauce.

Remember, if you get hungry, you can get refills of the veggies/tofu/noodles without paying extra, but will have to shell out more money otherwise.    

I was so hungry/focused on the meats that I almost forgot about the veggies/noodles/tofu.  Regardless, I enjoyed, and did NOT have to order anything extra.  Granted, it's not the same as a buffet, but I did 
like this healthy alternative. 

The service was pretty good, and they made sure to come back regularly for refills and to check on our progress.  I was afraid that I was annoying them because I kept accidentally turning off the propane a few times in the middle of cooking.

Overall, I enjoyed this experience, although I would rather have paid a little less...oh well.

The woman greeted me warmly and she knew I was a neophyte.  She explained the menu to me.  I chose the healthy portion--6 ounces of rib eye and the vegetables that come with it.  She then helped me choose the cooking liquid.  I went with the spicy miso broth and it was very good.  

Shortly after placing my order, the platter of meat was placed in front of me and an assortment of jars of spices, sesame oil, mixed pepper spice and the vegetables were put down and I was left to do my thing.

I really wasn't sure exactly how to attack the cooking.  Do I put in a fair amount of vegetables and let them simmer and then cook some beef quickly and then remove.  I just winged it and did things the way I guessed it should be.  I had one empty bowl, for liquid I figured, and a small plate for the solid food.

My thoughts range along these lines:

It's a lot of work for what? 
It tended to be a bit messy for me.
I think a slotted spoon or mesh ladle would have been nice to have to aid removing some of the harder things from the pot.
There was nothing that stood out about the meal except the spicy miso soup left after cooking the meat and vegetables in the broth.
Why is it that most Asian restaurants with a sushi bar assume that a person eating alone wants to sit at the bar?  I found the height of the burner and pot on the counter to be harder to get to.

Price with one iced tea (I was never asked nor offered a refill) was just under $19.  Add tip and you have an expensive meal for not much food and I did all the work. 

For $20, I'll go to any other Asian restaurant and I'll be served and not have to screw around with a burner.  I'm glad I tried this once.  I'll be eating elsewhere in the future.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,1,1,2,PRMAL1PlJ3LxEpk_PmIT0w

I've never heard of shabu shabu until my friend took me there. Thanks to her, she opened my pallette even more than I could have done on my own. And thanks to her, an avid yelper, we went to a lot of places to try things out. I digress, here's my review on swish shabu shabu.

Little known fact, in the Philippines ""shabu"" means crack...as in crack cocaine. So when she said we're going to swish shabu shabu, I cracked the joke. Pun intended. We got there and the ambience was good. I ordered the hungry portion of kobe chuck, coz I'm a fat kid at heart. I ordered it with the Sukiyaki broth. I also ordered eel special roll.

For the kobe chuck on Sukiyaki, it was great. The Sukiyaki broth brings out the flavor of the kobe beef. I like to cook mine where it just starts to brown the meat...so basically just dip it in the broth for about 10 seconds and eat it with rice. Overall, no complaints on that. It was phenomenal for a person that has never tried it before. 

As for the eel special roll, it was good. Not great. If you want specialty sushi, go for a restaurant that specializes in sushi. Swish shabu shabu is for the shabu shabu part. I like my sushis, but if I go to swish, I go for the shabu shabu. 

Overall, this place is great, but even the the hungry portion is not enough even for me. Good thing that there's another location that offers all you can eat shabu shabu. The service is great, music is a little off for the ambience (they either play rock music or edm). 

As for the part when I said shabu means crack cocaine in the philippines? Yeah, this place is crack coz I'm addicted to it. I would give it a 5 star, but they don't have all you can eat like the other location, that's why I'm giving it a four star. Don't take the 4 star lightly, though, coz almost everything about this place is top notch...except for the out of place music that doesn't go with the ambience.",aLsqrrHPvfJcLIgmf72rfA,0,0,4,YBXWfxW3vDMMuxuYI65qWg

However, I thought it was mediocre at the best. I ordered sukiyaki and my wife ordered shabu shabu. I thought the sukiyaki was a 2 star, and I would not try it again. The shabu shabu is a 3 star, and it has a great peanut sauce, but the meat did not live to its over priced value. Being used to the Shabu shabu in little tokyo in LA, this one is mediocre in comparison. 

another thing I didn't like about this restaurant is the set up. They have individual portable gas ""hot pot"" at each station. I really didn't like that. I think overall, that lowers the class of the restaurant. Maybe it's the fact I'm use to a build in glass-based table hot pot for shabu shabu in LA that makes the presentation of Swish look non-professional.

4286938,2008-06-17,0,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I like the hands-on experience when I come here. They serve you the raw ingredients and you just cook it yourself shabu shabu style (in a boiling broth, like fondue) or sukiyaki (pan-fried) on your own personal burner. 

But for the same reason, it seems the place is a tad over-priced. I mean ... you cook it your self. 

Prices on entrees range from $9 for the small veggie shabu shabu plate to $60 for the large Kobe sukiyaki plate. 

I think with the exception of the bento, they don't cook anything. All of the kitchen labor is just prep work (like washing veggies, cutting meat). I'm gonna assume the seafood is shipped in frozen. The cheesecakes and mochi ice cream are probably outsourced. They don't have to keep a large variety of ingredients on hand. 

You can ask someone to help you if you're totally clueless. Sometimes they offer to get you started. It seems the burners frequently go out or the wait staff forgets to light them. Don't be shy to let some one know. The wait staff is always attentive and polite. 

The items always seem to be fresh. I get the seafood or mushroom party (variety of fungus) or vegetable plate add on to my bf's Kobe. The Kobe is sliced per order. I like it when meats are cut or decanted right before eating it. It keeps the texture crisp. 

I'm pretty particular on the temperature to which my seafood is cooked. Like I like my shrimp well done, but I like my salmon and scallops rare. One of the advantages to cooking all your own stuff. 

They recently expanded their menu to include bento. 

Try the steamed cheesecake. Its Japanese-style, so its fluffier, lighter. 

Swish is a good alternative to the common dining experience. Each meal is nicely balanced with meats (or meat sub), veggies (cabbage, carrots, onions, mushrooms, green onions, and spinach), and starches (rice and udon). Meals also come with two dipping sauces: a peanut sauce and ponzu. You can order a small or large portion meal. 

I think I liked this place a lot the very first time because it was novel. After that, it was just meh. Now days I just go there when I'm feeling like being healthy ... which is rare.

She recommended that we try ""sukiyaki"" mix if we weren't too familiar with the shabu-shabu flavor, since it does have more taste.

The meat came out for the sukiyaki portion, and yes, it was amazing too. The taste of the broth was uncanning almost like an outter body experience.  I loved the udon noodles they gave, and the nappa cabbage.  Honestly, just eating that in your broth makes the meal amazing....adding the meat is just a plus.

We opted for one shabu broth and one sukiyaki (sweeter broth) so we could try both. These two broths are totally different so it's based on personal preference.

4396252,2017-04-28,2,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"Having had eaten at many Japanese shabu shabu places in the Bay Area and in Asia, I must say I was rather disappointed by Swish. I ordered the 6oz 3 meat sampler shabu which consisted of prime rib eye, Kobe chuck and Kobe rib eye. The meats were pretty decent with the Kobe rib eye being very nicely marbled with fat but they were sliced paper thin - not that I prefer thick cuts but this was beyond thin - nearly transparent and stuck together when I tried transporting the meat to the pot.

The meat was really the only thing about my meal that was decent because all other ingredients were just not quite the quality I had expected. For instance, they didn't have the pork bone broth and I don't like miso broth so I got the clear broth with some pieces of dried seaweed (kombu). That was fine but then the plate of veggies came with a bunch of napa cabbage (filler), several thinly sliced tofu (equivalent to two regular cubes), a few broccoli florets, one sliced button mushrooms (instead of enoki, let alone shitake) and some sliced carrots that looked brown and old and tasted bad. The ponzu dipping sauce was way too watered down without much flavor. 

I was given a quarter of a yellow onion and green onion which was nothing I have seen before and I put them in the broth which made the broth tasted worse than bland. It turned into a strange onion flavored soup.

I didn't want udon, which came with the meal, so I asked for the rice/glass noodle and had to pay extra $2.50 but that wasn't the issue. The issue was that their glass noodle's texture was really weird - it was a bit thick and crinkly and crunchy. It came pre-cooked and when I transferred to the pot, the texture did not change or soften or straighten after cooking for some time. I tried a strand and I had to spit it out because it was bizarrely crunchy and tasted strange as if I was chewing on something utterly superficial like a plastic tube. I had to tell the waitress that I can't eat that and she was kind enough to take it off the bill.

In my life of eating at shabu shabu / hot pot places, I have never encountered anything of lesser quality for the price paid, which surprised me because I did no expect this area near Vegas Chinatown to command this kind of price with this kind of questionable quality. Perhaps people here don't mind. The photos I have taken seemed decent but the flavor and ingredients were laughable.

I really hate to give this place a bad rating because its high rating on Yelp was the reason I came here but I was never this disappointed.",8BV5Hm4Nygujx3cdoP_EtA,4,1,2,rr_UtL7M-_et2paECdpYIw

I always get the shabu shabu, and I always leave with a happy and full tummy. I've tried both the seaweed and spicy miso broth, and I enjoyed both. The seaweed is very light, and the spicy miso is definitely much more flavorful. If you don't like spicy food, then they can just give you miso broth as well.

I usually get the prime rib 6 oz or the 4 oz lunch special. The meat is thinly sliced and is definitely a good amount of food. I go mostly for the vegetables, and it's such an easy and delicious way for me to get my nutrients. I love dipping my beef and veggies in the goma sauce.

The servers are always really kind and hard working. Sometimes the service is a little slow when the place is busy, but that is totally understandable. If you want something, don't be afraid to ask. They will get you what you need much quicker, and they won't have to read your mind.

4615532,2011-05-20,0,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I am a huge fan of shabu shabu....... it is hearty, healthy, and perfectly portioned. It's a great way to avoid your typical greasy stir-fry and feel cleansed after your meal (:  Let's just say I've been to several shabu shabu places on the east coast. 

This place was my first attempt at shabu shabu in Vegas. I must say I was greatly disappointed :(. Best way to explain why is to compare lunch at this restaurant with my prior experiences at other shabu shabu places. 

1) The base broth I am used to is more flavorful and a bit darker in color. This place was almost like water, so I had to make too many additions to get any flavor out. 

2) There is usually a good selection of vegetables and plenty of noodles, OR you can 'build your own' by choosing what you want as a combination. Here, there were no combo options and the vegetables are the same for each and every order. Broccoli, cabbage, asparagus, carrots, and tofu. Would like to see other options such as egg, corn, bamboo, bean sprouts, etc...  Also, the noodle portion is WAY too small even for a child, and the only option is udon. 

3) Service. I believe the girl on shift that day was inexperienced. She was on her own and we had to keep asking her over and over again for the same items. They don't provide you with a bowl and spoon for the soup so we had to ask for it. They weren't provided until close to the end... 

4) I would say most shabu shabu places, if not all, that I've been to had the built-in shabu pots. Here, they use the portable gas ranges, which I don't think provides the same kind of experience. We were finally given a ladle towards the end of our meal, which helped with the pots being elevated pretty high... 


*I must say the positive thing about this place was that the seafood is fresh and the meat is good quality.... they just need to work on portions, more menu options (combinations, build-your-own, etc..) and have better training in staff for serving shabu shabu, because it's different than serving at an average restaurant.

4661953,2016-06-14,0,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I had purchased a Groupon deal so I decided to come here for lunch. They have lunch menu that is pretty affordable but all plates served are 4 oz. I ordered the prime rib eye and seafood plate (baby scallops, salmon, yellowtail, one muscle, and butterflied shrimp). Each plate comes with a side of vegetables (Napa cabbage, green onions, tofu, mushrooms, and carrots) with udon and a bowl of rice. 

QUALITY:
I wasn't impressed. The beef slices tasted slightly gamey and it didn't hold a bright red color like I've seen with other shabu shabu/kbbq places. I was not a fan of the baby scallops, especially for the price. The one muscle looked like it was frozen prior as well as everything else probably. If I could, I would easily replace them with more muscles. The shrimp and fish were fresh though. However, I did think it was odd that the fish were served as sashimi slices. I ended up eating them as sashimi. 

Usually, the broth of any post shabu meal should be taken home because it tastes bomb AF but I didn't because the broth didn't have that deep broth-y taste. In the beginning, I felt like the broth was weak and I had hoped that by the end of my meal, the broth would taste better, but that didn't happen. 

PRICE: 
For the lunch menu, the plate of prime rib eye was about $11 and the seafood was about $15. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
My waiter was nice and checked in with me frequently. Despite the fact that he accidentally brought me regular miso broth instead of spicy miso broth and charging me for extra udon instead of the free bowl of rice, he had nothing to do with my low review. 

ENVIRONMENT:
The decor is a bit outdated. I think if this place did a bit of remodeling and updating of the menu, they would have more business (during the prime time of lunch on a Sunday, there were only two tables - me and another couple).

Your choice of meat is brought out to you, along with an assortment of vegetables that include onions, green onions, asparagus, carrots, mushrooms and cabbage.

I've had the shabu shabu here before, but it wasn't something that I'll be eating again anytime soon.  The broth seemed quite plain and didn't seem to do much more than boil my veggies and meat.

Ok so Swish is actually the first shabu shabu place in Vegas. I looked when I moved here. This was the only place. I needed something to get my shabu shabu fix taken care of. Shabu Shabu is when you get a hot pot of water or broth and you ""swish your meat/veggies/seafood"" to cook it and eat. I have this thing with interactive food. I love to play with food. ""BE THE BOLOGNA SANDWICH!"" 
So you come into this strip mall not knowing this place is here. I'm sorry but this place was not easy to find. But yo support yo local businesses. The table setup is kinda cool. It's like a square counter with everyone having their own seperate hot pot. It's a very simple menu. Veggies, meat, kobe, or seafood. You get a healthy size....and a hungry size. They need like Hulk size. But then again this explains so many skinny asians. You can get a variety of apps from Edamame, seaweed salads, miso soup. But the good stuff comes in 2 forms Shabu Shabu form....or Sukiyaki form 
For dessert - have some Mochi ice cream and rub yer full belly. Mmmmm So this place did place in Best of Las Vegas Staff picks 2006. If you get lost it's on Sahara near Buffalo!

Seriously though.  I really enjoyed the experience, and the spicy miso shabu shabu was delish! I confirmed with our server that it (and the seaweed broth) were vegan, and I was good to go.  I got the vegetarian delight, and I was pretty delighted.  The soy-ponzu dipping sauce was tasty and a nice compliment. (The sesame sauce is mayo-based, so I skipped that).  The meal was light, but filling, and very fresh-tasting.... and quite a deal at only $8.95.  My only complaint is that my plate was about 1/2 nappa cabbage, with only about 1 oz of tofu, and a few slivers of other veggies.  I love me some nappa, but I'd prefer a little more broccoli and udon noodles (OMG, the udon noodles are SO GOOD).  Maybe next time, I'll just order and extra portion of tofu and noodles??  

The point is, there will definitely be a next time.  I can't believe I haven't tried this before!

I found my friend's seaweed broth to be a little bland, but they have nice containers of chopped garlic, onion, green onion, and chili sauce that you could use to flavor it up, if you're a DIY sort of broth maker.

The experience is similar to kbbq style but you are cooking your meat in a hot pot style. You can order between different varieties of meat and veggies. After that you can choose which flavor broth you would like and they'll bring the flavor broth in a pot and a mini burner. We orders the seaweed, miso and spicy miso broth flavors. The seaweed broth was a little bland, I enjoyed the miso and spicy miso a lot more! 

You then cook raw thin slices of meet in the broth until it's cooked. The same rule applies for the vegetables and udon noodles. You can either eat them with a bowl or rice or even make your own little soup bowl to slurp from. Overall I had a great experience and would recommend this place.

They also need to fix the ventilation in here; you leave smelling of old hot pot. Not cool if you're going out on the town afterward.

Menu shows different types of meats in different ""sizes"" of platters. Most come with rice and veggies as well. Was a little surprised at some of the prices even for the ""healthy"" (smallest) portions. Some have said it's cheap, but maybe I'm used to a different area, because some of the plain beef (not even kobe) was much more than I'm used to. Ordered rib-eye.

We got our table range and a pot with the broth in it, but honestly I didn't care for the broth too much. It was just okay; should have tried the sukiyaki, but I can be picky about that. 

Got a couple dipping sauces, which were okay (ponzu was good, but extra salty). Disappointed we didn't get faithful drink refills.

Overall I was just a little disappointed; but maybe I've been spoiled by other shabu-shabu places I've been to. The meat tasted stringy and old after being cooked, we only got a couple kinds of veggies which weren't that great...It just felt cheap and didn't match the price. (I knew I should have tried the mushroom platter instead).

They do have a happy hour, which looks like a good deal. If you've never HAD shabu-shabu and are interested, I'd say try this place. It's definitely a good starter and with the discount price it's worth a shot.",QOxFvRsHDyAiNRraNluFrw,0,0,3,ZBuqLpGim-nr3H4fz7eUuA

To all the fans, I'm sorry to say.. but I think Swish Shabu Shabu was a #FAIL!  Swish did not live up to all its Swash.  We ordered numerous items on the menu from small portions of seafood and the kobe.  The amount of food that you get for the price was not worth it.  Also, am I the only one here that thinks the broth, especially the sukiyaki was bland to the bone?!?  We dumped in a dribble of soy sauce, gave it a few shakes of pepper, stirred up some magic juju in hopes to re-engineer the flavor, buy no luck there.

4974392,2007-08-08,0,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I love the idea of shabu shabu cooking, whether it's fondue style for the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, or the French.  

After discovering Nina's has closed down (for now), the BF took me to Swish to satisfy this craving.  Walking into the restaurant, it's pretty straight forward how business is run here.  In front of every seat is a hot pot (or a hot pan) for your own cooking wishes.

The main two features of Swish is their shabu shabu menu and their sukiyaki menu.  

For shabu shabu, you get to cook your meat, seafood, or veggies in a broth.  (The menu says it's a seaweed broth, but it appears clear like water and I couldn't taste any seaweed in it.)  I ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size portion for $13.95.  They give you two dipping sauces, one is a ponzu type sauce and the other tasted like it had a peanut taste in it.  (Supposedly it's sesame though.)  They also give you a small dish of assorted veggies that include onions, carrots, green onions, tofu, mushrooms, spinach, and cabbage.  A small portion of two types of noodles and a bowl of rice are included with your shabu shabu order.  You can also request for shichimi (chili powder), layu (hot sesame oil), and chili paste for an additional kick.  It's a filling portion for the price you pay, and you can order additional rice or noodle for no extra charge.  (Double check on the noodle part though.)  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of shabu shabu.

The BF ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy Portion for $14.95.  They pour a bit of oil into your hot pan, and add a sauce where you pretty much grill your food into the sauce.  Throughout your meal, you'll add more grilling sauce to help cook your meal.  There's a bit more taste with the sukiyaki style, but shabu shabu would be considered healthier.  You also get the assorted vegetables, noodles, and bowl of rice with your sukiyaki order.  Be sure to ask for your raw egg too, you can either dip your food into it or pour it over your rice like the BF does.  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Chicken Fiesta, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of sukiyaki.

Other items on the menu include appetizers like kimchee, spinach sesame salad, seaweed salad, and spicy seafood salad.  For dessert, you can find ice cream, mochi, and Japanese steamed cheesecake.  A few bento options are available to go too!

Service was good, but I heard it could be better.  In the beginning of your cooking, they offer garlic, radish, and green onions to your sauce or cooking pan.  The BF mentioned that when he eats there, the waitresses often cook the food for them.  However, when we went, they didn't offer.  He wasn't sure if it was because he goes at lunch or because he's with other guys.  =)  Haha!

Overall, my experience at Swish was good.  At other shabu shabu places (like Koji's Japan in Orange, CA http://www.yelp.com/biz/cqQHvz1zvM_z2MbH0zjXBA#hrid:xzHUpQinpow0nRqocXAB0w/query:Koji),  they offer unlimited vegetables and a better dipping sauce.  Then again, Koji's is a bigger run operation than Swish.  I wish they would offer more vegetables though in their order.  

Look out for their specials!  When we went, they offered 25% off Kobe orders, 10% off with Student IDs, and a frequent eater card.  They're about to open another location on Silverado Range and Maryland Pkwy in the late fall.

Overall: 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.

Update! 10/29/07 - Over the weekend, the BF and I were craving some Swish.  I ordered the Kobe Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size ($35.95) and the BF order the Kobe Rib Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy size ($38.95).  The meat was so tender and oh so good.  I think the prices just went up and they no longer offer a frequent eater card.  But they do offer a group discount for five or more.  And reservations are accepted for parties of three or more too.  Only udon noodles were given to us this time, and the veggies are still on the skimpy side in my opinion.  The Kobe Rib Eye is pretty good stuff, but it's a costly thing!

(I added some pics of our dinner on the business profile section.)

Update! They apparently offer a happy hour from 9 pm to 10 pm.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,3,4,FQSqCoPfurntyaAjNaXYzA

I can't really compare their prices but this is the only shabu place I've been to in Vegas. I think for lunch it's a great deal! 12 bucks for 4oz portion of ribeye plus rice and veggies. For the broth you can go with soy, spicy miso or seaweed. I picked the spicy miso because it sounds the most flavorful.  When I went in the restaurant it was pretty empty so we got seated right away food came really fast and this place doesn't charge more for extra broth or extra sauce :). This is a huge bonus!

The beef was very tender and delicious. I only dipped it in for a few seconds until it turned color so it didn't get too tough. The vegetables were mostly cabbage but it was a good portion. I think my favorite part were the condiments they gave you on the side. In addition to ponzu and sesame sauce, which were delicious they also had hot sauce, green onions, grated garlic and my favorite grated radish!  I would definitely come here again for shabu.

No one was here except for our three person party.  The waitress took our orders (we all had the same meat except my buddies got the sukiyaki style while I got the usual shabu shabu).  I also ordered the mushroom party because of my love for enoki mushrooms and....who doesn't want to say ""MUSHROOM PARTY""?

We had some problems with the gas canisters: J's one was over zealous and causing her broth to constantly boil mine and L's bowls kept whimpering out.  I love rare meat but...uh not this way.  It took our waitress a bit to figure out what was going on even though we were the only customers in the room.

The meat was OK and the veggies were good.  We also used the Yelp check in special for nigiri sushi ....and that fish looked a bit suspect.  Come for the shabu shabu but not for the sushi, mmm kay.  My mushroom party came about 75% into the meal which meant I was so hungry and I probably didn't need to order the MUSHROOM PARTYYY.  In any case, the serving of mushrooms were generous but it'd better be for the price.

I LOVE IT!! *does a little dance* This plate has 6 or 7 different types of mushrooms and a second plate full of vegetables with noodles.

I got mushroom party lunch ($11.95) with sukiyaki and the BF got the seafood platter lunch  ($14.95) with spicy miso shabu, Angela shrimp with spicy shrimp shabu. All come with a plate of veggies and noodles and some rice. All the ingredients were fresh and good. I think out of the cooking styles I prefer the sukiyaki for the mushrooms and the seafood was better in the shabu. Their miso creamy sauce was decent, ponzu okay, but I was hoping for another sauce that was offered that is more savory salty for shabu (sukiyaki you eventually dont need it). 

We had shit luck though and first Angelas burner ran out of gas, then it was the BFs canister and then mine. Made me wonder why they even bothered with camping burners that take little gas cans to power. After we go our food it got busier and it was hard to flag the waitress down for some drink refills and such. It wasn't bad, but just OK service. 

I think for the amount of food, it was a good value. I am a fan of shabu shabu style and haven't had it in a while. Definitely will return and hope for no burner fiascos.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,2,3,1AnZg5WxWVMadj1PKn_tZA

The atmosphere is open and a bit sparse, but clean. Service is friendly, but perhaps a little inattentive, as we had to wrangle them for water refills. You sit at individual tables, and they provide private mini-ranges. Tabletop flames scare me a little, but now that I am adult, I do okay. When I was a Southern tot, however, I would make my mom blow out the flame on our pupu platter at our favorite Chinese restaurant. Otherwise, I would cry.

We went with the vegetable plate without the mushrooms, extra orders of tofu and cabbage. Their vegetable plate comes with broccoli--bonus! We were really excited by this vegetable appearance, and let the waitress know it. She thought we would appreciate this too: ""It also comes with baby corn!"" Um, yeah, that's kind of a problem, but I'll let you slide because the broccoli thing is that wonderful. The vegetables were all fresh, and the tofu was good.

Now, maybe this was in my head, or maybe I am just becoming a sukiyaki snob, but I felt as if their ""broth"" was a little more salty and less tangy, sweet. This could be a good thing or a bad thing because it either means it is indeed salty, or it means the other places are putting boats of sugar in their creations. I need more tastings to determine the correct answer. 

For now, I think I would be just as happy and maybe happier having the vegetable plate at the Swish location closer to my house, but I am still a fan because sukiyaki is just that sukiyummy. One more salty encounter, however, and I will have to reevaluate.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,9,4,z5IlhGAnQOMVOcoQHUDDlw

Anywho, walked in sat down I was excited to try the ponzu & goma sauce the prices for the meat was decent but what I didn't like about it was that it did not taste fresh. The meat tasted & looked like it was bought from a grocery place and then they just placed it really quick onto the plate and made it look nice. The goma sauce was so sweet/ and the texture of it sucked I tried to add in as much items as I can to take the sweetness away, seemed like they bought that from a grocery store also.

5390420,2013-08-08,0,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"Anyone who friends me on Yelp will probably quickly realize how much I love Shabu Shabu due to the sheer # of times I check into Shabu Shabu Paradise in Henderson (81 at time of publication).   Conversely, my mere 5 check ins to Swish correctly show how I rate my Shabu Shabu options here in Las Vegas, but that is not to say I don't enjoy a meal at here.  As a matter of fact there are even some characteristics of Swish which I prefer to Paradise:  options and price.

I love the variety of options at Swish from the fact that you can venture off of Shabu Shabu altogether if you desire, or that even if you choose Shabu Shabu as your option (as I always have and probably always will) that you can choose a larger variety of protein options (salmon!) and different types of broth (spicy miso!).   I also love their tableside condiment tray options with garlic, chili paste, green onions and radish all being available at your disposal.  Please don't judge me by how much Garlic and Chili Paste I put in my broth, it's a free country.   Service is friendly and usually efficient, though they do sometimes get overwhelmed.   When paying by credit card the last few times the waitress would bring over one of those smartphone enabled scanners to swipe the card and then have us sign the touchpad.  Not a fan of this as it seems like they're hovering over you waiting to see how much you tip.   Fortunately for all involved, I'm an amazing tipper so it just made us all feel better.  

The cons to Swish when compared to SSP would be the quality of the food is slightly lower (though still a good deal considering SSP is more expensive), and it definitely skews younger and louder as far as clientele. That could be a pro to a lot of people, but I'm the type of guy who pays extra to sit in VIP sections if available for any concert I go to because I can't stand being mixed into a crowd or standing for more than 5 minutes at a time.  This is who you're dealing with here.  

So while Paradise has my heart, Swish is an excellent alternative on the nights I'm craving Shabu Shabu but feeling like salmon or wanting to spend less money.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,G-qtagSDZy1AH3WC9Jzv7Q

The service is friendly, but I found the ambiance of the place a bit lacking. It is just a big, open room and something feels strange about it, too big, loud and echoey.

It didn't take long to fill up though. The smell alone, when you walk in the door, will captivate you. The ginger, garlic, and chili pepper aroma intoxicates the hungry. I ordered the spicy miso broth with the the hungry portion of Kobe chuck. We also ordered a mushroom party and it was well worth it. I really enjoy the texture of foods and was worried the savory meat and veggies might get diluted being cooked in a broth, but as our waiter explained the process my fears were put to rest. The meat is literally swished into the broth then dunked in a sauce (ponzu or soy miso) before eaten. The veggies I let cook until slightly withered and they maintained their integrity through the process. This made for an experience in dining that was not only interactive but self gratifying. My friends were cooking their entrees and we exchanged tips on what sauce to use or how much garlic to add. All in all the dinner was amazing. The staff is attentive and quick to answer and assist with any questions.

To my surprise, it was around dinner time and the place was completely EMPTY.

We ordered two hot pots, a couple of orders of sushi rolls, and a drink for each of us.  

Hot pot #1 spicy miso:  This pot was alright.  It had some flavor to it... at least more flavor than the other one we ordered.

Hotpot #2 seaweed:  This pot is literally just water and seaweed.  There was absolutely NOTHING in the stock except for water and a few pieces of seaweed.

Since the place was completely empty, we got the table closest to the kitchen for faster service.  There was ONLY ONE PERSON at the entire restaurant.  There were NO OTHER customer, yet we still had a hard time asking for things that we need. Between the three of us, none of us liked the food.  It was an experience we didn't plan to repeat... Until when the bill was settled and... 

After the meal, I paid the bill, which came to roughly $63.  I gave them roughly$12 tip to make it $75 even.  I paid by credit card, tip and all.  As we were leaving the restaurant, the server saw that there was no money on the table since I included tips in my bill, so she literally ran after me and asked me if the service was bad that I didn't her tips.  I didn't tell her that her service was indeed bad, but I mentioned that the tip was given to her on my bill.  She proceed to tell me that I didn't leave any tips.  I told her to go back to the register and look.  Did I mention she didn't even give me a receipt???  Anyway, she saw the big tip ~20% that I gave her and smiled ear to ear.  What she didn't do is apologize for being rude to us and our birthday guest.

The bill came to $75 after tips, taxes, and food.  That's about $25/person.  It was rather overpriced for what we had.

TWO stars for the food.  -2 stars for the service.

It was very easy to find. When we entered the restaurant, they already had 3 other tables all eating shabu-shabu. We initially planned on ordering one Shabu (spicy miso) and one Sukiyaki so we could share. But after seeing everyone else eating Shabu, I had doubts about ordering Sukiyaki. 

We were seated immediately. Our waiter was this asian gentleman who was super friendly and made us feel very comfortable using both groupon and yelp free sake coupon when asked. 

I asked how sukiyaki was and he even offered to bring Shabu broth for our sukiyaki order if we end up not liking sukiyaki!!! Amazing service!!!

So we decided to go ahead and order 1) prime rib eye sukiyaki and 2) seafood party spicy miso Shabu as we planned initially along with ""sassy calamari"" as an appetizer. Sassy calamari is a must try. It is amazingly GOOD. Portion was kinda small but it had nice sweet and savory flavor with a kick. Thinking about it makes my mouth water Yummy yummy calamari!

Pots with broth were brought first with veggie plate. Tried both broth before adding any condiments and WOW sukiyaki broth was goooood. On the other hand, spicy miso was kinda bland. 

My bf loved eating rib eye and udon noodles sukiyaki style. Spicy miso was just mediocre even after adding vegetable, meats and seafood so I had to modify it by adding some of the sukiyaki broth (extra sukiyaki broth is brought to you in a bottle from get go so you don't need to ask server for it). After adding sukiyaki broth and letting it simmer for a good 5-10 min, spicy miso Shabu became delicious!

I know it's Summer in Vegas and I know it's a bajillion degrees outside, but after eating on The Strip for a while I was craving a good, healthy, and authentic Asian meal and Swish Shabu Shabu delivered. Typically I love to have hotpot during the Winter months, but the balanced mix of meat and veggies hit the spot.

Swish Shabu Shabu wasn't too busy when I arrived around 6PM. My server told me they typically get busier later in the night around 8PM or so. I guess people in Las Vegas eat later in the evening!

This restaurant offers a variety of meats to choose from including typical beef to chicken to seafood. I picked the Kobe Chuck since it was a step up from the Prime Rib-Eye and it had a nicer fattier texture. 

So there are two sizes to pick from: 

*Healthy that is 6 oz. and consists of 10 slices.
*Hungry that is 8 oz. and consists of 15 slices. 

After picking the size you can pick the broth:

*Shabu Shabu that is a clear water broth.
*Sukiyaki that is a richer soy sauce based broth.

They'll bring out an individual propane cooker for you to cook all your ingredients in.

Accompanying your meal you'll get a bowl of rice, two dipping sauces (ponzu and peanut sauce), side condiments (minced garlic, green onion, and chili sauce) and a plate of vegetables. I remember seeing these items on my veggies plate:

*Napa Cabbage
*Tofu
*Mushroom
*Onion
*Green Onion
*Carrots
*Udon
*Broccoli

It may not look like it, but there is a ton of food. I was definitely grabbing my stomach by the time I cooked my last slice of beef. The Kobe Chuck pieces were quite tender and remember not to leave the beef sitting in the broth for too long. 

My servers were also very courteous and hospitable the whole night. They even helped me get a taxi back to my hotel.

Be sure to check out Swish Shabu Shabu to have a nice Japanese meal off The Strip.

5918717,2010-11-16,1,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"Overall, a very good shabu shabu place in Las Vegas.  Plus it is on Spring Mountain near most of the other Asian restaurants and supermarkets, so getting here is not a hassel for most people living, shopping or working nearby.

Plus they have two (2) happy hours!  3-5pm and again from 9-11pm. But you have to tell the waitress/waiter about HH to get the HH pricing.  That will entitle you to 50% off your HH alcohols, such as Gekkeikan Zipang Sparkling Sake for $5 (instead of $10), which is cheaper than buying it at the Asian/Japanese supermarket that carries it. And if you have a current student ID, you get 10% off too.

I have not tried their Kobe RibEye yet, but Living Social has a $15 for $30 deal today, which will be like getting $15 off the typical $38.95 or $48.95 pricing.  http://livingsocial.com/deals/12943?ref=email-jp&rpi=2266445
But that is only good for about another 11 hours.

This Swish location is located in the old SF Market, along with many other popular businesses. The closest parking spots are usually occupied, but there are plenty of other spaces in the garage under the building.

Now if they just add an AYCE option, and this will for sure be a 5 stars shabu shabu place for me.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,3,4,pd2OOjcjefSfpr7nRbDlxQ

The restaurant was completely empty at 12 pm...only one waitress working and a couple customers went into the restaurant after us and she seemed quite frantic. Took a while for the food...a tiny plate of veggies with broth that tasted weird. Ponzu sauce had a strange taste to it. Meat still looked frozen and was not great at all...miso had a weird sour taste. Overall, I didn't like it. Sesame sauce was good, but I probably won't come here again...",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,0,0,1,txeYTxxhs0zVTvbWYGrtKA

Service was quick. Very efficient. I was genuinely impressed how well the place ran with just 1 server. She was managing at least 5+ tables too!

Walk-In. Order. Choose your broth flavors. Can't decide? Ask for a split pot. We got the regular miso and spicy miso. 

Veggies were okay. The frozen slices of Prime Rib-Eye were delicious though. Yummy. Perfectly portioned. I was satisfied, but my partner wasn't. You can always add more, which was kind of pricey.

Overall, I would come here again. I wasn't blown away by this experience since I've had better quality veggies, meat and broth at other Shabu locations, but I would reccomend anyone trying to get their Shabu fix to come here!",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,1,1,4,Izz14cuPUpCflJmkO4K77w

5959394,2011-10-02,6,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"Yet another Groupon alert. 

I've been to the Swish on Sahara on quite a few occasions (usually when I scrounge up a coupon or two), but had never tried the newer location on Spring Mountain. When the Groupon popped up a few months ago, I snatched some up and have been planning my trip. 

We ordered the Kobe large portion Sukiyaki and the mushroom party Shabu Shabu to share. I'm not a big fan of cooking food myself. I will often make the sacrifice for some AYCE Korean BBQ or Shabu Shabu and this was one such occasion. 

My fella had never tried Shabu Shabu or Sukiyaki, but I knew he'd love it. What's not to love flavorful meat, rice, veggies and noodles. 

The staff was friendly and attentive. The place was really empty for a Friday evening around 9, though. There are so many great places to try on Spring Mountain, I know there's a lot of competition for them, but I highly recommend this place, especially with a coupon. Excellent deal!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,8,4,h72LYe12vd1MWm69HeYEYA
5968328,2014-01-02,1,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,"I usually go ti the Sahara location. Swish is my favorite restaurant and so I was given a gift certificate but only this location accepted it. First off: we were the only ones there and service was bad. Second off: food was HORRIBLE. I ordered the prime rib shabu shabu. The ponzu sauce is not the same as the other location. This ponzu had no taste to it at all. My vegetable plate was slightly smaller than I'm used to abd the udon was practically non existent. The broth was decent I admit. We tried some sushi to use up our gift certificate and order the Philly roll. What I got was not a Philly but a California with cream cheese and salmon on top. Disgusting. The waitress hardly checked on us and was too busy talking to the 'chef'. Thy didn't clean off a previous table until 20-30 minutes after they left. That's unacceptable when it was so slow.

Needless to say STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION. THE SAHARA LOCATION IS A MILLION TIMES BETTER.",iETCGuWIAgwS1oY8ApI85A,0,0,1,4ka2sXH18DcNGJ-kTnS2Pg

I have been to several places in southern. Ca and this is much nicer and cleaner. This is the first time I had an all you can eat option. 
I would have like to have seen some garlic and scallions to add to the pot but the hot sauce was tasty.  
Definitely will be back - with friends !!",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,6,2,5,xJ3mJQtzY88WyACzell9dQ
