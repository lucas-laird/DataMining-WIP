Service staff at the counter was surly and unhappy. I had to repeat myself a couple of times as she stared at me blankly when I ordered. 

My order for a couple of burgers, drink and pie took a long time. And I had to check my order, ask for sauce, ask for plastic utensils. 

I'm on holiday, so was in a positive mood, so I thought nah, maybe it's just me. But as I was waiting for my order to be ready, I noticed her snarling at other customers as well. 

I'm not asking for the best service ever, but is it too hard to just give minimal service without the surliness?",Xs4wlPwWUCdQSqqFDG1b_A,3,0,2,DZwXDoazbnqeagIU7kVwTg

I had over $100 in comps on my totals rewards card, which you can pay with there. Of course after eating and trying to pay my bill they tell me the machine isn't working and that I have to pay with cash or credit. This defeats the purpose of me going in the first place. Instead of finding someone to resolve the situation, they decide to treat me like a criminal and threaten me and call security as if I'm running off without paying. Security comes over and calls a casino rep, who was extra nice to me and took care of it so fast. The whole ordeal with management at Johnny Rockets took almost an HOUR! Why couldn't they just have handled it better and called the casino rep themselves? But no, they decide to be total asses and make threats and treat me like a criminal.

Last Thursday evening decided to stop and eat here because the Flamingos cafe was closed and food was good. 
Took a drink of ice tea and it tasted so foul it was unbelievable that's when I also noticed a smell coming from the Tea. 
I notified the employee and they also noticed the smell and came back after talking to manager and stated ""it always smells like that its always like that we filter it"" well I knew better and drank water and it pretty much ruined my dinner. So about 4-5 hours later WHAM nausea and vomiting time and cramping. Thank god the vomiting stopped quick. When notifying the assistant managers they showed no concern and really didn't care maybe lack of training so I filed a complaint with the health dept I'm sure they will get them to clean the lines and the tank etc",fsvBRaR93q9ZngAN1CCJ1Q,4,1,1,4GV0rbqMsjt5U-btFUgKTA

Several of the alcohol-induced patrons were causing a ruckus so it was a bit chaotic during the ordering process... but it's Vegas, so it's what you have a to deal with.

My affinity for spicy food led me to order the Houston Burger, which had jalapeños, pepper jack cheese and a spicy mayo-based sauce. As far as burgers go, it was average... good, not great. The sweet potato fries I ordered were pretty solid though.

What makes this a 3-star experience? The wait. For a burger and fries, it took waaaaay too long to get my food. -- 20-25 min. That's just unacceptable for an ""okay"" burger and [probably frozen] sweet potato fries.

At that time we didn't have any groupons or discounts, so we ended up paying full price for or meal. Being that this is Vegas, we knew that the price would be inflated, but we didn't expect it to be quite as high as it was at that time. We noticed that some chains in Vegas stick to their standard pricing without inflation (i.e. Chipotle) but Johnny Rockets is not one.

On our second go round, during our most recent trip to Vegas, last month, we used groupon and it made a world of a difference. After paying for my groupon, my total came to $0.96 cents! Now, I'm not all about penny pinching on my vacations, but when there is a deal a deal like this, why wouldn't you take advantage?

The food here was solid, no complaints. I ordered a veggie burger and my husband got a cheese burger. They will substitute fries for a side salad, per your request also.

(I mean, what are the odds of that ever happening again?) My immediate impulse, being the typical me - 'let's grab a bite!' 

It was early afternoon. Our tummies were calling and I remembered a neat-looking food court right across at the Flamingo. We hopped over to try Johnny Rockets out. A friend of mine has been egging me to try it out so we gave a shot at the Rocket Wings with fries. 

For $10.95 (+ tax), you get 10 pieces of scrumptious wings with your choice of dipping (ranch, blue cheese etc.) If possible, lay off the blue cheese dip because all they're really going to hand you is blue cheese salad dressing which is comparatively milder than its counterpart dips - watery too. For dessert, we opted for the original vanilla shake. Here's where the prices started to get a tad bit ridiculous. $6.95 (+ tax) for a milkshake the size of that at an In-N-Out Burger and you could get the same thing there for $1.89 (+ tax) 

Just when I was just about ready to question why their prices were so high, Aretha Franklin's 'Respect' on pipe-in went on full blast and we saw the staff shuffle out of their counters and do a little dance at the middle of the food court, in front of the crowd. People joined in, others clapped along. It was a cute little show and in the end, keep in mind that what you're really paying for is the novelty.

I was perfectly happy with my experience and would gladly return.",3PaNIWP2uFZBcayFa1yUkQ,1,1,4,u1KEDHEY9KHUBaEgZ7WhXQ

We are still got the Hershey chocolate shakes which was really yummy! at first I didn't think it was too good but then I realized I was using the regular soda straw to drink from it not recommended...

When I realize what I should have been using which is a big round red straw oh my god that shake was delicious and you could taste the Hershey chunks that come up from the bottom which was just as Ono!

Reason for the three stars was that it was really expensive ...our bill was 87 dollars for four burgers 2 malt shakes and 2 sodas. They do have TVs there where you can watch whatever sports is on so that was cool..

As for the seats they're really close together so the person that was sitting behind me kept bumping his chair into my chair which was a little annoying....

It was cool.... I don't know if I will visit there any time soon again but it was a good experience I just think that it was so expensive due to the fact that the location is in a hotel... I have tried other burgers that are better then this, but all in all it was still a good burger nothing bad to say on that part.",Jl1zWNk5i3AwGVN1AacaUQ,1,1,3,tp0IGCKYFJDb0iLFvjT25w

A bit much for food court eats in my opinion, granting you're in the casino and everything is inflated but really it's ridiculous to spend that when you can shell out a little more and have a better meal at say Yardhouse. 

It takes quite a bit to get your food also so technically it wasn't FAST FOOD lol. Ordered fries/onion rings combo but was only given onion rings, no dipping sauce given for chicken fingers. They fixed it but the spotty service was still annoying. On the bright side, the Oreo shake hit the spot!",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,13,9,2,WLbfJhTNCnlCtV54ZYtVEg

- I've eaten at JR Sacramento and Los Angeles with high unsatisfactory taste, but decided to give it another shot bc LV has a Groupon! Didn't particularly enjoy their burgers last few times, so decided to go with a Philly-cheese. 
- Lackluster taste. American cheese!? Come on! Kraft!? Yuck... 
- You know when you eat a good philly-cheesesteak sandwich when you bite into it and all the meat and cheese gush out, right!? didn't happen...fail..
- Microwaved bread. Far from toasted. 
- I've tasted better philly-cheese from SUBWAY!!! haha..that already says a mouth-full. - Almost like a Costco cheesesteak but bigger.  
- Stale french fries. 
- For a sitdown burger joint, J.R is at the bottom of my list. For $20, you can go to Red Robin and get 2 great burgers for that price. 
- Generous portions for a split meal.
- The only admirable trait that JR has would be their classic style and friendly service! A decent experience for a train-wreck meal. 
- Good thing we still had leftovers from the Nordstrom Cafe! Haha..Even our waitress was telling us ""ooo-ooo, that Panini and cupcake..Delicious."" We ate it at J.R. haha",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,4,3,2,seiazPZCPyUR-grZ4OqSzQ

The fries were extra cheesy but a lot of the bacon pieces were burnt. So was the toast on my BLT (a bit darker than I like it even though I said lightly toasted). Wheat bread is available. The cheese fries were super messy. They don't provide any forks at the front unless you ask and there aren't any available at the napkin and condiment station and there should be. Even if you get your shake to stay you still get a to go cup. They give you a pager even for to go orders so you don't have to stand around. You can go play some slots or have a seat while you wait.

5829737,2012-06-26,2,dJS3iH-odljqWS9MKEFsBA,"Gabe and I were carrying Mauricio back to the elevator when, suddenly, he jumped back to life. ""I gotta eat,"" he said, so we let him go. 

It's as if he were possessed. After all, how did he know where we were? How could he sense the foodcourt? Did he smell the food cooking?

Walking on his own two legs for the first time that night, Mauricio deliberated as the neon signs in the foodcourt harnessed his attention. He stumbled a little as he passed Pan-Asian Express, but it was the red 1950's style barstool that finally beckoned him.

""Johnny Rockets,"" I thought to myself, ""gross.""

Mauricio plopped down on a barstool and looked for a moment at the wonder that was almost mechanized behind the bar counter. Meat sizzling. Buns toasting. Frenches frying. ""My god,"" he thought to himself, ""this is a kitchen!"" He buried his face in his hands and took a deep breath. He lifted his head back up after what seemed to be an eternity. 

As quick as a shot Mauricio stood up, and painstakingly walked over to the cash register. Gabe and I stood close, but slightly out of sight. ""God this guy's fucked up,"" Gabe confided. ""I know,"" I hesitantly responded. I was embarrassed. I felt the blood rush to my face as men and women walked past us. ""Soon this will be over and we can get some sleep,"" I thought. But sleep didn't come soon enough.

The clock strikes. ""My god, it's 3am,"" I say to Gabe. We exchange a mutual look of disdain. Finally, Mauricio walks back to the bar stool and sits down with the same intensity as he had standing up. I look at him. He's tired. He buries his head in his hands again. Then I notice the stool.

The stool was bright red vinyl with a polished chrome stand. The kind that my mom must have told me about a million times. A round, backless seat that's connected to a cylindrical pole, which is then connected to the ground by means of 4 or 5 large bolts. The stool was certainly sturdy enough to support Mauricio during his stuper, but I wonder what it would take to break it. The vinyl was clean and looked new. It had the shine that new vinyl has. It was crease-less, and plump. ""They used to have matching benches like this in the 50's,"" I relished.",kUx-GER6msp1lKnCzAttRg,0,1,2,3bEy8EcuWdOvh8W44THOrQ
