The music is normally on point and by the end of the night you find yourself singing to a few. Bartenders are always great to me, I've never had a single complaint when coming here. Definitely get to know the bartenders, find out who your favorite is and visit when they are working I found the best nights were spent with my favorite bartenders. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a chill place to drink.",gG6M6h0RB0LFCM_vnRx6pQ,0,0,5,dpvcHXfNNfzhmrZf8YfAPw

This place is great. Aside from the gambling, they offer pool tables darts and other non gambling games for your enjoyment. The always friendly and attentive staff is lead by Victoria and they are all great! It is definitely a place where they remember your name. Angelina's, the connecting restaurant, offers their menu and full service bar side. There are other places similar to Putters in the surrounding area, but this by far should be your go to neighborhood bar.",n_JkxLDM54i4IrkyG8pIkA,0,0,5,AShjwUV9Dt4kTymC8cFoYQ

2864890,2015-07-26,0,gJKdFQhR4hLCQuoKyU0kEw,"Not a good place to gamble and drink they only give one drink for every 20$ of play, I've been a customer for 10 years and they just imposed this rule this week I've lost 600 here and I'm paying for drinks because I'm only playing 50 cent keno ... so when I play 100$ I only get 5 beers ... not cool time to find a new bar",9c7DFp6dIJ78FPgdba7tCQ,1,0,1,Co6R-kH1ov36DO3fHOLPVQ

4578832,2018-06-08,0,gJKdFQhR4hLCQuoKyU0kEw,How is it that I put $100 in the machine as for 2 beers and I tip this bartender about $10 in a time period of an hour and I played about $25 and he STILL charged me for the beers. Im not a cheap person but what happen to gamblers that tip get comp drinks? Last time I come here. Every bar i have ever gone too give comp drinks especially when im tipping well for 2 beers only.,vJMR1DAhyypXpGNgSoj3ng,0,0,2,kxnikTdWkztKeS32x5uDyA
4720974,2017-07-04,0,gJKdFQhR4hLCQuoKyU0kEw,"Putters is a pretty typical Vegas Local's bar. They have a slightly better beer selection than your average bar, and have much better payouts than most. The only thing keeping me from giving them a fourth star is that they don't really reward gamblers well.

I've been here a few times and have always had prompt and friendly service. They don't have food but they are connected to the Angelina's Pizza next door, which has some excellent sandwiches and decent pizza.

They have draft beer, which I like much better than bottles. They also have a few offerings that aren't too typical, which they alter periodically. You might find a decent red beer or lager, but they only have a few draft lines and most of those are the typical domestics. Don't come here if your only into craft beer, but if you stop by for pizza next door you might find a surprise or two here.

The machines have a very good payouts, much better than a PTs. They also are fairly loose with comping drinks, but that's about all your going to get for playing here. My wife and I have both played here multiple times and have their players club cards, but we never get any free play or other offers. We usually at least play $80 between us and I know we've had at least two nights where we played around $200 each. I don't really feel like we deserve free play like other bars offer, but it pretty much keeps us from coming here unless we feel like going to Angelina's next door.

In the end, this bar isn't really anything special, though it has a lot of potential. I would't go out of my way to go here, but if your nearby and want a beer or two while you play this place is fine. If you want a place with good odds this is also a very good choice.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,3,mJ0WSRbWwmPSxDoL4eKGkw
5903642,2017-01-23,0,gJKdFQhR4hLCQuoKyU0kEw,Putters on Charleston is a clean example of corporate owned bars in Vegas. Locals from the area are the crowd.Food at the bar is from the first rate Pizza joint next door ANGELINAS. I recommend the garlic/parmesan wings.I live on the East side of Las Vegas and have many choices .The staff at Putters makes you want to return. Good vibe good time .,028WqgXeeB41eRSDgt6QCw,0,0,5,LY3Cj3GeQ2eHMoA--vXb7g
