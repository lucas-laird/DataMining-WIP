I've prdered the so called 'soup of the day' and got a 4 ounces soup with no taste at all. I've paid $10. The I've ordered the veggie filled peperoni, teh veggies were not cooked enough, and it tasted horrible. My hubby got the seafood salad,, he brought it back, so disgusting it was. Don't eat at the italian restaurant!!!",j4U5JvFc8Q03MWtKt1EENA,1,0,1,PWdd1hvgyBX8rXKhHLyjDA

I was able to order the perfect meal in all the right times while in Vegas.

My favorites were the Chicken Kale Salad @ $12.98.

I ordered extra chicken at only $3!!!

Eating clean is a daily challenge, especially when you are traveling.

While meandering through the Venetian Canal Shoppes, we came across the food court we'd stopped at last time we were here. It boasts a variety of quick eateries: Chipotle, Subway, Panda, Johnny Rockets, Prime Burger, Kabob Empire (highly recommended) etc. A nice place to grab a meal without emptying out the bank.",Uwj54BqrO30ybSzICGSyrw,4,3,4,4b36m9nDGKg6304YDgbN7Q

The first thing I thought of when I walked in was ""Dang! this looks like the food court at Brea Mall"". They have made to order or fast food, American or Ethnic, whatever you desire. 

Pros:
Lots of options to choose from
-Mexican
-Italian
-Indian
-Traditional American burgers
-Mediterranean
-Japanese
-Chinese
-Subway, and
-Desserts
4 stars for having a Desi place (Curry Pot) at a food court! Unfortunately, the line was 30 Minute long, so we did not dine there.
Finding seating could be a problem, however there is abundant seating to relax your legs before you walk another couple of Hours at this massive casino. 

Cons:
No TV's, or good music in the background.",DqNgAUKmZEFnLJcREzd5SA,6,4,4,3vZZXTraBX1Ufes98_h5EA

I believe there is a gelato/coffee place, Italian. Mexican and pizza place.

My favs are: Gelato, their European breakfast and their bacon is on spot, Krispy Kreme donuts, their Italian coffee Illly is soooo good, their Sticky Buns at the bakery, On the Upper level Food Court, their Pizza is delicious with garlic knots and salad is so good. The ambiance and the way they designed the tables is very pleasant, peaceful and makes it a great eating experience! You dont even realize the casino is just a few feet away...you are totally transported. Im a local and I love to go for the food of course, but also for the experience....A High recommendation!",v4WB-qGb4mSIOilHK6i-xg,3,3,5,pM7xuayryXJknqS3leZq_w

Gets the job done. If you're coming here, let's assume you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo trying to get something in your tummy to keep the party going - and for that, it'll do. It has chain options like chipotle and johnny rockets; there's a pizza place that's not too bad and a few other options as well. Everything's a little up-priced, but none not on par for Vegas. 

Stick to simple dishes and you'll be recharged and ready to go again soon enough. If you want an amazing, mind-blowing meal, go elsewhere, but for something on the go, it'll get the job done.",ONAC8zv6KUlnx1EAyRZbmA,2,1,3,XDIFMx_2SZxB20xugxk7fA

How could they create a plaza identical to St. Mark Square? Well they did! And there's always a show with real characters in masks to remind you that Italy is living inside these walls in the heart of Las Vegas.

But the restaurants are the touch√©. Authentic Italian restaurants with personnel from Italy like myself ready to welcome you with big smiles. We had lunch here and we didn't regret it. 

Perhaps a little overpriced, but worth it. After all, you're getting the food + the show, and you're not coming here every day. 

I can't wait to be back and live again this amazing experience. There are plenty of shops along the canals too!",HJfuzbFTwREQJ13sUUzHWA,2,1,5,0uYPKs-XMyhfqjGxrnH3jQ
5969536,2018-01-07,0,LdB-ymK-cauStX7TxUAs_w,"I went to eat at the Food Court at the Venetian Hotel and Casino.  The one in the basement floor.    I tried the Cafe Pan and had their Roasted Lamb with Rice and Salad.  It was about $10 and a bargain for this exclusive hotel.   The salad had very fresh lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and croutons with enough dressing.  With the dressing the salad was not too soggy.  
   They gave half a Take out container for the salad and filled the other half with rice and plenty of lamb with hummus on the side.   I couldn't finish it in one sitting, but I don't eat much.  So I took it on the plane with me for my late dinner.  Cafe Pan had sandwiches, pastries, espresso as well.   
   There was a Pasta Take out counter on the upper floor Food Court that I wanted to try but I ran out of time.   But on my next trip to Vegas, I hope to try it if it's still there.   The prices were very reasonable, under $13.  If you are on a budget and don't want to pay for additional Tip money, the Food Courts at the Venetian is one of the best to offer.  They have a variety of Take out counters from Asian food, Italian, American burgers, and Pizza.    It's great if you have small kids who are picky and you don't really want to spend very much on them if they can't finish their meal and food is left to waste.",S_CEjST7pcfztvVz9cKpzw,1,0,5,IRR2i8eOWvBPu74_eqyh_Q
