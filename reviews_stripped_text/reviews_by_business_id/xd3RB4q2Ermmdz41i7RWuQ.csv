Both options are up-sales.  If you want the meal item on the menu you have to say, no I want the regular or the small, which mean the same thing.  They don't warn you that the medium is an up-sale making you think you have one of two choices when you actually have three.  Very sneaky and very unappreciated.",v3oIQ7qmWo2L6B45BTWWQw,0,0,2,t_AcOxPWMYCZXl2JZWZntw

They were all okay but overall unsatisfactory. Have been back in the last month a couple times and it's always been clean, everyone has been very nice, and the food has gotten more organized. It still tastes the same, but it's a lot neater, burgers not falling apart, curly fries aren't cold and soggy. Much better than ever before.",zXHDiYVR81wQXSl4EECMLQ,0,0,5,YXePVTy9otMy0OSSNiacEQ
2872039,2016-07-25,0,xd3RB4q2Ermmdz41i7RWuQ,"This has to be the slowest Jack in the Box ever.  There was one customer ahead of me, already sitting at a table.  The cashier was very nice - gave me time to decide before I ordered.  So I got my cup for my soda, filled up and waited.. and waited.. Finally after 10 minutes the one customer ahead of me got their order.   My order was to go, so I'm standing there watching the back.  I finally got mine 10 minutes later - but I saw that my burger was done and sat at the fries bin when they decided to put fries into the fryer.  Then the fries were done, dumped out, and they too sat there while the cashier took orders for new customers.  Apparently the man who puts the fries into the fryer cannot scoop them into the sleeve.   So, when I finally got my food, it was 20 minutes after I ordered - burger was cold and fries were luke warm.  Guess I won't be going here again.  If they were busy, I would understand.  But everyone was standing around gossiping.",nA4A0xEQlHW_fclKpPBTgQ,0,0,1,O2P3TwXjm9yRGdE7ijNURQ

Not a very professional explanation or way to word it, perhaps the machine was getting cleaned. I drove to the location on trop and sandhill, didn't even share the experience with the young dude and he gave me the shake for free! Now that's what I'm talking about! I don't normally go to Jack in the Box but if I crave a shake again in the near future I'll be bringing my $3.19 to the Tropicana store",GKIlAjiM3W1Rp-21hLUnfw,0,0,1,Nxsw78iNN-hPF9NuvUBMLQ

The rootbeer is just always better at jack in the box for some strange reason. At 1 dollar for any size soft drink...why yes I would like a large, thank you.

The order was completed quickly and accurately despite the fact that they were busy. Its located in a weird spot, but if your on the move you can gas up and get a burger then hit the road.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,0,1,4,DyRvvVzsqfDOeWgaXceH3g

I was at this establishment between the time of 5:10 - 5:25A.M. I had to repeat my order to the order taker 3 times. Got to the window to pay and was NOT given a receipt for my order or given my drink which I asked for easy ice and was given extra. And the regular coke tastes like vanilla coke instead of regular. I received my breakfast jack and 2 tacos before getting my drink. While I had time to look around I noticed something that should be cleaned more often.

Once I was given my food it was more rushed out the window and I had to ask for my drink with some rolling of the eyes. I'm normally at this location at 730am, but the experience should be universal which apparently it isn't.

Anyways, I get my food and the fries are lukewarm/ cold... I'm still like no big deal. Then, I get home and pick off the lettuce with brown spots and while doing that, there's a hair in the sandwich... Cold fries are one thing, but waiting for a while to get food to find out that there's some others persons hair that you don't know what area it fell off from.

Ordered TWO orders of tacos, got to the drive thru window and she tells me ""here's your two tacos"", I told her ""I ordered TWO orders of tacos two orders meaning THERE SHOULD BE 4 TOTAL"". If I wanted TWO tacos I would have said just ONE ORDER of taco. Than she rolls her eyes at us and I asked for 4 butter milk and she hands over ONE without even saying ""I'll be back with the rest"".  So of course I'm already pissed at how she gave us attitude, she comes back and I tell her ""I said 4 not one"". Than she tells me (with an attitude) ""yeah I said I was coming back for the rest"". BUT SHE DID NOT SAY THAT. She just walked away. I asked for a manager and she says ""I AM THE MANAGER"" (again with an attitude). I said are you sure you're the manager? And she says ""yes just cause I'm not wearing a polo doesn't mean, I can use whatever I want"". Like first of all you don't speak to a customer like that period. She could have said things differently. She could have apologized about having the wrong order instead of giving attitude. And everything would've been just fine. She acted as if it was hard to make two more tacos. Oh and she ended up speaking in SPANISH to her coworker, YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO SPEAK IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE WHILE WORKING! Especially during those kinds of situations. Asked for her name and she mumbled it twice cause she knows what's going to happen. Asked for my receipt and she said ""idk"" than reprinted one.
