I had the satay beef noodles.  The satay sauce was spot on. The beef was great, but I would have preferred slightly thinner slices.

Can I suggest more snack items, and that in the sandwich section, add the ham and egg sandwich too?  And HK style french toast?  Please and thank you!

Five stars for quality of food and four stars for variety.",gv7STvfMSzJ3T8i6nlQIPQ,0,1,5,TDtTgBrLbA_twIiiMBu4nQ

Althought they have just started, you can tell there is a strong passion from the owner. Quality tapas and drinks, I would definitely recommend everyone to give that a try.",j0TPAWLQdJb4_tzJcpJ21A,1,1,5,MD_TvR1ZWBuCPFbo9OmNpw
1409741,2016-07-20,0,m-tOkwXdW0r4u_NG8w_ZXA,it is located in the same plaza as Tea Station. Authentic Hong Kong style noodle cafe. We try the beef brisket noodle soup. It was amazing for $8.99. They have the best brisket noodle soup in Vegas.,W0LmWvB2TRlA9OHo60KxkA,0,0,5,3LdtQ-HEjDcDe8xE-0dX2A

Went here for lunch for the first time today and I don't think I will be returning. The place is very nice and clean, plenty of tables, good for large parties. Their menu is quite small but good variety, noodles, fried rice, snacks, and a few drink options. 

Service was not good, the waitress clearly did not speak English very well but she didn't even try, no greetings, not even a smile. Personally, if you are a new restaurant you should try a little more with customer service. 

We ordered HK lemon tea which was ok, not as sweet as I would like but I'm not sure if it tastes like the ones from HK or not since I have never had lemon tea in Hk. We tried the shrimp toast which was gross. The slice of bread was deep fried and way too oily, small amount of shrimp on top, not much flavor at all, and the presentation was terrible. 

My sister got the beef brisket noodle soup (which a few reviews said it was really good and it was their signature dish), this was very bad. Noodle was not crispy, did not taste fresh, the brisket had lots of fat (I don't mind fat but there was A LOT), the broth was so bland. The broth was shiny, a clear sign of lots of fat in the broth, didn't have any beef flavor or any seasoning. We got there around 11:30 so I'm not sure if they just made the broth so it was not flavorful or what, but the overall dish was not good. We added salt and chili to it but still was not good, my sister ended up ordering the Yang Zhou fried rice because she just did not enjoy the noodle, the fried rice was not bad. 

I got the pan fried noodle with chicken. The gravy was way too thick, also kind of bland. The dish literally only came with chicken and Chinese broccoli, NOTHING else. Not impressed at all, I love pan fried noodles and this has got to be the worse I have had. Pretty much every other places give you a variety of vegetables, this was very bland and way too simple. 

I don't think I will be coming back here, the menu is small, which is fine if the food was superb but I was very disappointed. I would rather go to Big Wong or wait in line for Tung Ky for better food at almost the same price.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,1,0,1,Y5u4zjdnjJprzezDdK2bcQ

2233121,2016-08-08,0,m-tOkwXdW0r4u_NG8w_ZXA,A for effort. Nice family owned new restaurant. Better than the place that got shut down for being unsanitary (next door). Open late so I'll most definitely be back.,ACOWS6ytxT-ZDNVsMYijiA,2,0,4,iVaY6n2-QPyTHum5gMTMQA
2507419,2016-10-30,0,m-tOkwXdW0r4u_NG8w_ZXA,"Best Authentic Chinese Food in Town. Selection is moderate and always delicious. As a repeat customer who has tried most of the food. My best top 3 recommendation would lye between the cutlet and rice selection, the ""Best Wonton Soup in Town"" combo(it sounds gimmicky, but the chefs taste in cooking will make you eat your own words along with the meal), and the egg noodle soups. 

The food has a great mixture between all ingredients. Your not just tasting just the meat or the veggies alone, but all of the savory spices between.

If I am hungry and I'm looking to get full and satisfied Lucky Cafe would be my first choice and suggestion of you are looking for great food in China Town(Spring Mountain Road) in Las Vegas.",KEeBnqTPqQJWN7KYpxrnQw,0,0,5,R-8HWhkUSIXtkrYOs_vm5w

4046916,2016-08-12,1,m-tOkwXdW0r4u_NG8w_ZXA,"The food was tasty and somewhat authentic. Unfortunately, we were all a bit too hungry to pause and take many photos. So why the poor rating?

We had the tendon and brisket noodle soup and the roast duck noodle soup with the curry chicken rice. They talked us into getting half of a roast duck but prior to serving, they asked us if $18 was ok for half a duck and we said what!? We can buy an entire roast duck elsewhere for the same price. They told us their full duck price is $36. 

They said they make their own daily and we did receive some with the noodle soup that tasted pretty good. I much rather pay half price at Asian BBQ. 

Tendon and brisket noodle soup - the brisket was very tender. These came with the thin egg noodles that you see in wonton noodle soup. They were overcooked and soggy. Broth was okay, but nothing incredible. There also wasn't very much meat ratio and for their price, I expect a hearty portion. 

Chicken curry and rice - This was a bit of a gimmick. This was made with chicken wings which isn't usual. It should be called chicken wing curry and rice. The flavor profile was very good but I felt deceived with chicken wings. If it didn't taste good, I would have complained. 

Roast duck noodle soup - this came with the thicker white noodles and the broth looked the same as the brisket soup but tasted a bit different. They could be the same base, I couldn't tell. Again the issue was the lack of meat. There were a measly 4 pieces of duck to the entire bowl. 

The service was a bit subpar as well. They seemed unprofessional and had their little kid behind the register. He actually ended up serving us our waters. The older son was our waiter and was also unprofessional. Every time we asked a question he couldn't answer, he would run into the kitchen asking for his mom. 

Overall, decent tasting food with subpar service. I likely won't be back with the other solid options in town.",4UsK-DNdFlw-TEzcdkVcgA,0,1,3,99VziLPLGcFu9PZZXhu06A

5234689,2016-07-27,0,m-tOkwXdW0r4u_NG8w_ZXA,"We stopped by to next door which is closed for a week for renovation. And stumbled upon this place and decided to eat here. It was a pleasant surprise. 
It is not the big beef noodle anymore, but a Hong Kong style cafe. The new owners just recently moved from LA and started this new place. And the way they cook their dishes are fantastic. Authentic and taken a lot of care, the dishes are delicious and made at a good portion! We had the beef brisket noodle and fried rice and ham and cheese sandwich. The beef brisket was so tender. And chow fen with black bean sauce. Thinking about it now makes me hungry. Even with the sandwich, they ask you if you would like to cut the sides of the bread or not. 
Ask the owner what is available before you order to get the most fresh dishes for the day!!!",1DYufnG9NvRjdkOtxpei3Q,0,0,5,PRwIwdg4MJ7cgloOirF-eQ
