1145311,2016-06-13,0,1aYKH2ea5_dg0bLznqnvQA,I hired lv taco for a party of 65 guests this weekend. I have to say my guests were extremely impressed!! They were on time and very helpful in setting up the table. Everyone was asking who made the tacos. I myself as the host was very happy . I will definitely use Peter the owner of LV tacos again for my next event. Peter the tacos were delicious!! Thank you so very much! You guys rock!!!

The food was absolutely amazing, the staff was super friendly, and our clients had nothing but great things to say.  We had to do absolutely nothing for his set up.  He showed up with everything he needs, down to the napkins.  Also, there was no shortage of food, even with the number of people at our parties.  I'll be having taco leftovers for a week...and let me add, gladly.",iMIqzkjIZNaTbyqWwBv8Vw,1,2,5,Zn5WXVwbfDMSpLn_2W7acw

Peter was on time and once he started setting the food on the table, I could already smell the yumminess. Everything looked fresh, and the meat smelled amazing. I was scared that it wouldn't be enough but it was the perfect amount of food, and my party guests are big eaters! Everyone kept saying how delicious the tacos were. I avoided the time and energy that it takes to cook things for my party, and I absolutely loved the food. I would absolutely be using them again. Thank you!",_W2_ZdGUZRhPsLV64yQeEA,0,0,5,CBs-r46MBlQzvyzsOzswrg

When I spoke to Peter, he was very accommodating considering I called him five days before I needed him to deliver. Additionally my order was a little bit smaller than he normally does, however he still allowed me to hire him and accepted the job and thanked me multiple times for booking with him. The day of the delivery, he called me 15 minutes before his team was to arrive to let me know that they were on their way. They showed up on time, was very professional and set everything up on their own. All of the supplies we were able to keep and the food was absolutely delicious. The meat was tasty and all of the side dishes and toppings were fresh. I would definitely use this company over and over again. I've hired a couple in the past but none have as great of service as LV Taco with such a reasonable price. Thanks Peter!",dEYIdZp5DaSofx85Q4IPQQ,0,0,5,4qihsroabdHg1x1ytqZGFg
