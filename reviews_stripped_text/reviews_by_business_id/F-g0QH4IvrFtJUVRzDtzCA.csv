141827,2010-12-28,0,F-g0QH4IvrFtJUVRzDtzCA,"After a day of touring the Hoover Dam my friends and I were anxious to find a place to watch our UConn Huskies take on Pitt in the Big East opener. We decided to try our luck off strip. After driving around in circles for 20 minutes we happened upon PT's and went in because the game was starting in 10 minutes. Upon entering the darkly lit bar we were surprised to find that it was spacious and had numerous televisions set to the UConn game, even though a highly anticipated Monday night football match up between the Saints and Falcons was on. The bartender was extremely friendly and helpful, and recommended the nachos and half-price pizza for us out of towners. The nachos were among the best I have ever had. The steak was tender and not undercooked, while the fresh jalapenos and roasted tomatoes complemented the crispy tortilla chips and warm nacho cheese. The pizza was nothing compared to New Haven pizza, but was thin crust and hit the spot. For $6 it would be hard to complain. Drinks were half-price for happy hour, so I was able to get two huge mugs of Fat Tire (aka nectar of the gods) for about $6, while my friend got 2 Buds for the same price. During halftime we played a round of pool on one of the huge pool tables and people-watched as a group of UNLV students played beer pong at one of the designated tables. I highly recommend this bar for anyone who wants to get away from the strip for some good deals on food and beer and a great place to watch your team. BONUS: It is also in a strip mall with a Von's where we were able to stock up on Tecate, limes, water, Gatorade and all of the toiletries we forgot to pack for our trip.",WHmVPO2NKGK5NlUa7M0E_A,0,0,5,E1Ys2WMLp8W9Hx8fz9uHBg

He obviously doesn't care about working for tips!! I walked in and it took 30 minutes for him to to even acknowledge me and my boyfriend.

The server was nice but was really slow.  She even forgot a round we had ordered.  The real disappointment was the food.  We ordered wings and tenders typical bar food.  The wing were small and overcooked.  The tenders were as small as the wings and also overcooked.   All which had no flavor.  Really, I have had better chicken at KFC and I hate that place.  We would have said something to the server but she was hard to find.  Wouldn't be returning to this bar.",0CFCZuSPfbmmELYVAtMa2g,0,0,2,OsrZkIiaQn5MZSLhZa27_g

He recommended goose ipa and Brooklyn lager..., he was also on his phone and, openly discussing about the discount he gets, to his  patrons and how he can void items etc. meanwhile I dropped 30 bucks on the keno and ordered 2 chicken Caesars( witch were amazing)., ( that took 20 min ) he did not comp my $7.30 Newcastle my bill was $40.13 for two drinks and really bad service as he continued to cater and practically give the bar away to friends. I hope this post is read by the PTs entertainment group for the property on Silverado and Maryland prkwy. One star for JAVIER & 1 star to the business for hiring such poor staff. PTs entertainment is great company but will loose quality Las Vegas patrons for this. The place, food and atmosphere is great just POOR bartdnders.  HOPE ya's get a proper bar host.

Was over charged and he didn't know how to comp drinks for gamblers.  Also, the bathroom in this place is disgusting.  I would rather go in a porta-potty.   Then when I went to leave, the bartender chased after me with another bill that he thought was mine.  It obviously wasn't because I had already paid mine.

1253978,2015-03-03,1,F-g0QH4IvrFtJUVRzDtzCA,"Worst customer service ever. Came in here for happy hour - ordered well's on the rocks. Came to find when we got the bill that they charge an extra $1.50 when you have a drink on the rocks (post happy hour discount). I suppose that would mean an extra $3.00 a drink in regular prices when you have your drink on ice instead of with soda. Who knew it costs an extra $3.00 when you ask them not to add something to your drink? 

Complained to the lovely bartender who looked at us like we were crazy and that every bar tacks these prices on. I guess they rely on brand new 21 one year old's who have never actually been to a bar before. Especially great since they never mention these additions before they give you the bill. 

Note to everyone - stay away, much better places to drink in Las Vegas that won't sour your experiences in the city. Note to owner - If this isn't your policy and you just have a horrific bartender - get rid of her ASAP. Never coming back, never recommending anyone to come here.

This place is like a second home even the bartenders(Frank or Edgar)  that usually work the graveyard shift know my order  once I walk through the door. So I come in on a Sunday night and they have this one female bartender I wasn't familiar with. I ask for a Jameson and ginger ale, as simple as that sounds, she pours a Jameson and club soda. Her explanation was, ""some PT's don't have ginger ale."" So she remakes it, I downed the first one and asked for another round. She DOES THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN! When I asked her to remake it, she disgustingly takes the cup and pours another shot of Jameson and tells me to take care of this one. All that attitude and still didn't fix the drink. I just took the drink and didn't mind to ask again. I never had such terrible service that it made me ask a friend to use her yelp account to post this. I just know from now on, whenever I see that bartender again, I'm walking out.

2974187,2018-02-03,0,F-g0QH4IvrFtJUVRzDtzCA,"I went here with my mom and my sister. We intended to play pool but wanted to get some food first. We sat down at a table and were greeted by a waitress named Jazmyn. She kindly cleaned the table and took our orders. Mom, sis and I had good conversations and we were patiently waiting for our food. A ""little"" later the waitress comes and says ""your food will be out shortly"". We say ""thank you"" but then noticed that we actually had been waiting for 40 minutes. 10 minutes later we were really getting annoyed and were then trying to find our waitress but couldn't find her. A total of ONE hour of waiting we decided to leave. I end up finding the waitress and tell her that we are leaving because we shouldn't have to wait for an entire hour for the food we ordered (a burger, nacho plate, and sliders). Oh, and by the way,  the restaurant was more empty than full so you would think that they'd have time to care for their existing customer a bit more. Anyway, when I told the waitress that we are leaving she just said ""ok"" and didn't seem to care as she quickly turned around and walked away from me. 
 I could have accepted this wait if the staff handled it better and had a good explanation/reason. This was not the case which is why I'm giving them a 1 star.",33JgTQRpqivZdqrg8Mn9YA,0,0,1,4erxzE4s_SqjiMSMVqMdTQ

But it took about 10-15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge we were sitting there (we were right next to the bar). It wasn't busy at all. Once we were finally given menus service was just slow.

The customer service is absolutely terrible, the bartenders underpour the liquor, & keep you waiting for a good 15 minutes on a drink refill. Oh and about those free drinks while gambling, yeah forget about it. It's a $20 minimum while playing max bet to get one free drink per half hour, and it can not be top shelf ANYTHING. Oh and for the worst part, apparently you are NOT allowed to ask people for cigarettes in this bar otherwise they will kick you out! I don't know what kind of bar operates this way, but I sure do know the family that owns the chain and they're all a bunch of snooty stuck up rich brats. I take my business elsewhere. Might I suggest going to T-Bird Lounge right down the street on Eastern, or Mulligans Border on Pebble. Much better drinks, prices, and a way way less bitchy staff. They'll get to know you by name, and Mulligans has some great bar food. Don't waste your time here at PTs or any PTs for that matter.
