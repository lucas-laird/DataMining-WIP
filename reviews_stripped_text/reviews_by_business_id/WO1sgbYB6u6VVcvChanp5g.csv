Galbi which is not marinated.   That Galbi is available at a good Korean BBQ place to taste real meat flavor.   Well one of us really wanted that marinated this time and it was an excellent choice.   
After 11pm they deduct 20% and it is average price with really good dining I think.   

The receptionist was very attentive and we liked her service.  Table waitress is ok. 

We had paejyong? Pancake also.  It didn't took my fancy but all small dishes especially Kimchi was very good.  

I certainly would come back this place for tofu stew menu and other choices.  

They have a semi private dining area for a group dining.   I can use this for business dinner",ggUIxd2V8ryLPYUYJUBEaA,0,1,4,u58LG4uWejPwr8gHaijmvw

The meat is always really fresh and not too fatty (huge problem at other Korean restaurants in town).  And unlike EJay, my favorite pieces are the ones that aren't marinated...dip the cooked pieces into the sesame oil/salt and pepper mix, place on a lettuce leaf, add some chili paste, and you're in food heaven.

But even better than the bbq is the amazing, amazing kimchi chigae here!  It tastes just like Mom's!! (ok, no restaurant makes it quite as good as Mom but go with me).  Seriously, it is ridiculously good.  Plus, they add a few pieces of dduk in each serving (a little strange but tasty!).

Oh, and the banchan is great!  I love the Korean-style potato salad (includes small chucks of crisp apples...sounds weird but it really cuts the mayo).

Now I'm not going to compare this place to the places in LA. It's like comparing a hamburger from (DJK)Denny's to (Numerous LA Korean Restaurants) In-n-Out. Both are burgers, both have meat, buns, etc. But one has a very distinctive taste of being fresher, tastier, more personality i.e. Know what I mean?
With that being said, DJK does have a happy hour, I think it's starts @ 11pm, I'm assuming it's to cater to the service industry folks out there. The dining room service is not too bad, it's kinda of everything you'd want, fast and courteous. 
The food is really not too bad. Since I'm usually one of those Vegas locals who just happen to ""stumble"" in here every chance I get, I usually get the soon-tofu or bim-bim-bop, both the stone and regular.

I did the udon (broth too sweet with way too much msg), friends the kalbitang and manduk and noodle soup.  Usually the waitresses will scoop the rice out of the stone pot for you -- instead they came and dropped off a plastic pitcher of hot water with my friends who had the kalbitang.

I've been to a bunch of places in Chinatown, none of which I can remember their names...except for this one...and that's because it's my favorite!

Unless you are a Korean foodie or Korean yourself, I would suggest going with Korean friends, so they can order for you and cook the meat for you at the table. Each table comes with it's own ""stove"" of sorts, and you cook the meat and veggies on it. I usually get chicken, which they will cook in the kitchen for me, because they will spice and sauce it up just the way I like it!

You also get a bunch of appetizer dishes before your main course, this includes fish cakes (my personal fave), kimchi (spicy pickled veggies), seaweed, bean sprouts, etc etc. This place is also 24 hours, though I would never venture into Chinatown alone past 10 pm. :p

We were visiting Vegas for the weekend and hooked up with some cousins in town. They brought us here. I was very surprised by the amount of food that came...and kept coming. Not only is this place open 24 hours, you can order as many servings of the side dishes as you can shovel in your tummy! Oh and we didn't have to cook our own stuff either. Every few minutes, someone came by to check on the meat and turn it for us and then pile more on until we finished everything we ordered!! The meat was cooked just right and very full of flavor. As for the sides, I think we must have gone through 3 orders of the cucumber and the daikon and 5 or 6 orders of the fish cakes!! 

The parking lot of this strip mall was very crowded and we had to park several store fronts away but the restaurant is family friendly (at least during dinner) so that's a plus. My preschooler loved the food and the staff didn't seem to mind that she dropped her fork a few times and we needed extra napkins (those with kids know how meal time can be). The restrooms were clean too. Another plus for someone with a bladder the size of a pea and a preschooler.

If you are in Vegas and you have a car it's definitely worth it to venture slightly off the Strip to visit DJK.

The soup had no flavor and there wasn't even a spicy flavor. I was extremely disappointed since the soup tasted horrible and didn't satisfy my craving. Plus it was pricier. 

The ban chan was pretty tasty. They had kimchi, kimchi radish, fish cake, broccoli amongst other things. However I would have rather had better tasting soup. It is to be expected, I guess since it is a Korean BBQ restaurant.

The first visit was great. The service was okay and the food was delicious. We ordered daechang (large intestine) and traditional kalbi. The daechang was a treat due to its rarity, especially here in Vegas. It's slightly marinated, which is a nice touch and adds a slight sweetness to its rich, fatty flavor. We liked it so much that we returned four more times.

This is where the bad begins. The second visit was mostly okay but the daechang wasn't marinated properly and lacked flavor. If the dish wasn't prepared properly, the servers should have told us that it wasn't available. We could have ordered something else. Instead, they served it to us anyway. After they us served our food, we were forgotten and the food ended up getting a bit burnt. It was still edible and the place was fairly busy so we gave them a pass. 

The third visit on, things get really bad. The servers burn our food AGAIN. We waited over 15 minutes for more rice, side dishes, and water. That's only after having to flag one down after being ignored for quite some time. This is at 11 PM, when less than 4 tables are being served and 4 servers are working. We had to ask for straws three times. Twice to our server who never procured them and a third time to someone who wasn't even serving our table who *eventually* brought them to us. We were annoyed, but just chalked it up to tired workers who had a long day.

The fourth and fifth visits just sucked. Why did we go two more times after a shaky third visit? Probably due to a combination of having too much faith in mankind and a hankering for marinated daechang that can't be found elsewhere in town. By now, the faith is gone and the craving for that sweet, fatty dish has all but withered up.

Everyone is so friendly, had a good chat with couple of wait staffs while they cook the meat on the table top stove thing.. 

I can't say menus are cheap but reasonable compare to those Korean restaurants on the strip. Also, Korean food is suppose to be little more expensive because it usually requires massive amount of labor to prepare the ingredient in the right way.

Anyways.. 
DJK is by far The best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas.

I think they're under new management and if not they need to train their staff with a little more diligence.

They say when you walk into a Korean BBQ restaurant to not be startled by the enthusiastic welcoming shout but when we walked in it was neither enthusiastic, nor was it welcoming, nor was it even a shout. 

We were seated to our table as the waitress practically threw the menus upon it and left us to it without asking what we wanted to drink or basically anything else. Later we had to call on someone to take our order and man came to attend to us and asked us what we wanted to drink and if we were ready to order with an extremely nonchalant attitude.

Throughout the whole meal no one ever came by to ask if we needed anything else or if we needed refills on some of the side dishes that came with the combination order. Our grill became charred and although they looked as they passed by there was no automatic response to change the plating for the grill nor was there any service in helping you grill your meat like typical Korean BBQ restaurant.

We ordered the Jack Combination and I gotta say that their meat/food was pretty mediocre. Didn't look fresh at all, didn't even attempt to try to make it look appealing. 

From the start to end of our meal I noticed a drastic difference in the way they treated and greeted customers that were either Korean/non-Korean and that difference was not good. 

Note that if you're not Korean don't expect any good service or even any friendly smiles. Whatever you choose to do whether you have the same experiences or not that's fine because I know for a fact that I will not be coming back again.",zV-CQLRsukT2usRWbOlFOQ,0,0,1,65zDPsvdTOMtbcMVXjIKDw

The thing is that Korean people ( or people who have a great deal of experience in Korean food/ BBQ ) would probably not like this place very much. This place has different types of food, but my family ate bbq, so I can't judge the other things on the menu. Also, this restaurant had the type of bbq where you have raw meat and you grill it yourself on a huge grill in the center of the table.

I have to say that my family and I were very, very hungry when we came here, and would probably think any food was good. But, we have tried several Korean BBQ and this was one of our favorites. I don't live in this area so I probably won't visit this place again, but I would if I came back.

The service was a bit lagging, since all they were required to do was bring a few slabs of raw meat to our table. 

We ordered a tofu- ribs combination (sorry I don't know names) and 2 plates of meat: more specifically beef. We ordered one plate of delicious marinated ( Korean style bbq) tender beef and one plate of beef ( Chagol something or other.)

My whole family unanimously agreed that both types of beef were delicious, but I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND the marinated beef if you were to get one type of beef. 

The waitresses/ waiters give you a bowl of rice in the beginning, and the tofu was delicious with that. Now, as I said before, we ordered a tofu- ribs combination. The ribs were fantastic, some of the best I've had. Trust me, I've had a lot of ribs ( Im a meat person).

1094849,2017-07-30,0,WO1sgbYB6u6VVcvChanp5g,"(Vegas Locals) My wife and I decided to try a different All-You-Can-Eat Korean barbecue and we were in for a surprise and pretty much ended up getting the worst customer service we've ever experienced. Dae Jang Keum (DJK) Korean barbecue at Spring Mountain is a 24/7 Korean BBQ who for what we know just added an ""AYCE"" option on their services. I'll just start this review with the PROS; first off their place is a bit spacious and seating/tables are huge and comfortable, secondly a few of the meat choices are USDA certified meat so you could guarantee the tenderness and juiciness of them and lastly is the fact that they're 24 hours and wait times are quick.
********************* But sadly, here are the CONS. As I mentioned this is an All You Can Eat restaurant and as most or all of us know that there are waitresses that takes your order and brings them to you. Well this waitress started off by greeting us with a frown on her face. Sure, I know that we're not Koreans and I understand that there might be a language barrier of some sort but the least you could do is try. My wife and I are not perfect but I could say that we treat others nicely and with utmost respect but that is far from what we got from them. This particular lady pushes our dishes away when she lays the other plates that we ordered and there are even times where she just pretty much almost just drops it on our table. Nearly everything that you request to her, she always have a *SIGH type of expression where she seems to get annoyed or she completely just doesn't care. After a while, we got tired of how she was treating us so we just asked another waitresses' help and surely that didn't help. This other lady kept on insisting that we have to finish a piece (literally 1 tiny baby octopus) before we could order anything else and she threatened us that we would have to pay for left overs (we're talking about a 2 1/2 inch baby octopus). My wife and I just looked at each other confused and wondering why are we being treated like this. So After finishing that we asked if we could order and she literally looked everywhere for that damn octopus and made sure we ate it. That was just flat out frustrating. Then she puts on a fake smile and sarcastically asked us what we want. Julie and Hailey were the the name badges that they were wearing (I'm sure those aren't there real names). I saw a total of 4 waitresses on our time there. I don't want to get the others in trouble, and I don't want to have to drop names as well but I'm left with no choice because I need protect the character of the other waitresses that we didn't have dealings with.
********************** Service in this place is TERRIBLE. Prices based on their menu (available meat choices/side dishes) are inflated and expensive compared to other similar restaurants. We also looked after receiving such horrible service in YELP to see how other's experiences went and you'll see how we weren't the only ones who complained. *********I DO NOT recommend this place at all and I guarantee that we would NEVER come back.*********

They told us there would be a wait so we sat patiently and waited meanwhile while we waited tons of people were being seated that just walked through the door after us. I was fine with that because we were hungry and patient to wait to eat something good.  When we finally got seated we didn't get water for about 10 minutes and then probably menus long after. A woman came over to us and started to take our order but when the phone rang, she ran to the phone. She came back and said she was ""off"" but she would take our order anyway and then the phone rang again and she ran away again.  At this point I'm wondering WHY the customer service at the table is less important then the phone ringing. And if she was off, why not get a waitress that was working to help us? The fact is is that we were the only non-Asian in the restaurant and nobody wanted to help us. This place caters to Asians only. When a woman finally came to take her order she was mad she threw down the menus.. She was huffing and puffing about having to even stand there talking to us. Maybe she was irritated that we had two orders for there and one order to go or maybe she was just irritated that she didn't understand English and she got stuck with our table.

- As for service, they had two waitress waited on us.  One person was a bit too demanding.  It was more of a pressure to order and rush things.  The other person was more calming and allow us time to review.

I pointed it out to the waitress (""I ordered pork soondubu, but..where is the pork?) She watched me as I swirl my spoon in the stew, a little embarrassed/shocked and didn't know how to respond, she walked away!! The tofu wasn't the softest--more firm. The broth was ok, it could be more flavorful (maybe lacking salt or anchovie flavorings?) In addition,  i have tasted better seafood/vegetable pancake. The pancake here wasn't entirely crispy.

I went here twice for soondubu and both times it disappointed me. I've also tried the soondubo over at Mr. Tofu (which is a few restaurants down) and i think its better.

We went for the combo to make it easier since we didn't know what to order. I think next time I would order the meat I want separately since the meat they gave us was very fatty. The service was good, at other Korean BBQ restaurants sometimes they start grilling it for you then leave you alone and while it begins to burn you never know if you should remove it and risk offending them or let it burn and hope they return before there is fire. In this case, the waitress returned exactly when it was ready, each time. It was amazing how good she was with all the customers in there. 

I would probably come back and try it again. But really, they need to clean those bathrooms and slap a coat of paint on the wall.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,2,0,4,nliCzTuftdxEc87nrSDqVg
1676884,2013-08-14,4,WO1sgbYB6u6VVcvChanp5g,"Probably the best Korean BBQ in town.... if you're really drunk, have no taste buds and this is the last meal you will ever eat.  I'm sorry but my friends and I are from LA and this ""KBBQ"" spot does not even come close to the ones in LA. It was such a disappointment after partying it up at XS (Sunday) Night Swim that we were still talking about eating somewhere else afterwards.  They are not even All You Can Eat and when we asked our waitress if it was, she responded so angrily as if we were insulting her.  Maybe she thought we were going to get up and leave because it wasn't AYCE.  We probably should've left but starving, we stayed.

OK, yes, it is open 24/7 but that is probably the only PRO here. 

CONS (where do I begin??):
- Quality:  Sucks.  The waitress brought out our meats still frozen! You can see the freezer burn on it.  And can I get some meat with this fat please?
- Overpriced:  We ordered the King Combo for $79.99. Poor quality meat, small amount (even if it was only supposed to serve 3-4 people), and cut into even smaller pieces.
- The Fan:  It is supposed to suck up all that smoke right? Not here! it was making it worse and was blowing it at us. Can you say smoke inhalation? After flagging down our waitress through the cloud of smoke we asked her to turn the fan off and that was even better than having it on.
-  Service:  My group of 6 friends were the only ones there and there was two waitress both having dinner.  We had to call out for them a few times because they wouldn't check on us to see if we needed refills or anything else.
-  The sides:  No comment.  Oh wait, rice was cooked well.  The only thing the waitress was willing to refill was the salad.
-  Drinks:  Hot green tea in a tall plastic cup used also for ice cold drinks.
-  Silverware:  Chopsticks and spoons kept in bulk in a wooden box at each table.  Im pretty sure I saw some fingerprints on some of those spoons.

We thought about ordering another King Combo but we decided it would not even be worth it.

After much conversation, we think it was intentional. We think they have two menus, one for tourists or non-Korean and one for local Koreans.

So what's my current comfort food?  Bibimbap!  

I suppose there are far more ""guilty"" comfort foods such as macncheese or a fast food meal, but DJK's Bibimbap with bulgogi is just bliss to me.  A wide range of tastes and it's nothing particularly heavy, greasy, or guilty that I'll feel bad about in a few hours.  

But I digress - DJK is located off Spring Mountain and is, as mentioned, open 24 hours.  They offer a fairly decent Tofu Soup with slightly sad collection of banchan late night -always the same, generic, not particularly fresh - coupled with my bibimbap and the late-night percentage discount, it's a fairly nice place to hit for a cheap price.

However, their table BBQ is very expensive - it's a pre-set package that starts around $50-$60 bucks that you essentially need to have several people there to help foot the price.  To me, I don't mind paying for that at Honey Pig, but the quality at DJK is not quite fantastic enough for me to justify the price.

This restaurant has also never been closed down by Southern Nevada Health District so I feel far more comfortable eating here than the latter.  Now back to their food, combinations usually come with beef brisket, pork loin, beef flank, soy bean soup, steamed eggs and unlimited serving of salad and homemade banchans (Korean side dishes).

One downside about this place is their service.  Perhaps, I've never really gone here at an earlier time but being the only group at 3 am and still not get decent assistance is quite surprising.  I'm not asking for them to cook every single meat we have on our table as I can do that myself.  If I had to stand up and serve myself water or chase down the server because I want more kimchi is just not cool.

Overall, Dae Jang Keum is one of the better Korean restaurants in the valley.  The fact that they're open 24/7 is a plus since we can drop by anytime we want Korean food!",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,2,2,3,hpZmSWnCucgcPuTuUX8t0w
2076832,2014-01-19,0,WO1sgbYB6u6VVcvChanp5g,"I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. We (party of 3) ordered the love combo $50ish (samgyupssal+marinated beef+chadolbaki+soju or beer+egg jjim+salad) which was meant for 2 people. We had to leave some piece of meat behind because we were too full. 

But most importantly, the taste is really good. My dad is very picky on food and so he would not eay it unless it is good. But he gave two thumbs up. I give it 2 thumbs as well.

The service was really good, too. We had enough refills of salad and other banchans. The waitresses and the restaurant owner kept asking us if we needed anything else. 

The only bad thing about the restaurant is the location. We tried getting there by bus from lv strip. It took us a good half an hr to get there because of the lack of bus lines that go straight from the strip.

I havent tried bbq meat but i will need to get a second job to afford it.  I'd rather go to Hwaros.

Beef tofu soup didnt have much taste
Beef in tofu soup wasn't easy to find due to its scarce quantity...
 but when I did find it, I was disappointed with its bubble gum like texture.

I dont want to be ALL negative. I have found my teeth and cheek muscles significantly stronger next day after the beef workout. I might have even gained muscle and lost some weight.

Service people were nice this time. Last time i was here it wasnt the case.

The boy and I opted for the Jack bbq platter for $60.95, which was a TON of food! Easily enough to feed 4 with all the side dishes. It came with a bubbling cauldron of soup & a cauldron of steamed eggs, as well as multiple kinds of meats and soju. We substituted a large sapporo for the soju. We shared another beer later and for the four of us, the bill ended up being less than $90. The amount of meat we were given was quite a huge portion, so they definitely weren't skimping! It came with a bowl of steamed rice and two different sauces, as well as bean paste, seasoned lettuce, cabbage kimchi, seaweed salad, radish kimchi, beansprouts & broccoli. The banchan tasted fresh enough when we arrived, despite it being after 2AM. The kimchi had good tang but didn't taste old, the bean sprouts were still crunchy, etc. The meat had good flavor, though the pieces of pork were almost entirely fat. I like undercooked bacon and enjoy a good piece of pork belly now and again, but it was too rich to have more than a few bites. There were occasional bone fragments left, so be aware. Overall a satisfying bit of meal and plenty of food for 2-4 people depending on the depth of your hunger. 

A good selection of meats and a surprising little 24 hour restaurant in the same shopping center as Mr. Tofu & Pho Kim Long. There were korean gameshows blaring loudly in the background and most of the customers and staff were korean. A couple that came in after us departed long before we did. Our server didn't come by very often after she got the meat all on the grill. At first she was really attentive and cut up our meat for us, but when we were ready to leave it took quite a long time.

I could see that same sign from my room at the Monte Carlo and noticed it pointed down a quiet street, right next to Walgreens. I could barely make out the fading blue Dae Jang Keum sign but after searching for it on Yelp, I was excited to find a Korean restaurant nearby!

Yes, if you're Korean, than obviously you've tasted much better Korean restaurants but this is VEGAS! If you're craving Korean food in Vegas, this is the best you're going to get - without a car!

$16 (including tax and tip) for seafood soon dubu that was a bit diluted but otherwise, good. She didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it which was a bummer because it was a bit too mild for me, though my spicy level is pretty high.

Side dishes were good, which included some of my favorites: spicy cucumbers, pickled daikon and bean sprouts.

Side dishes also included sliced hot dogs - HUH?! I didn't even touch this. I don't think anyone did!

Menu was also Caucasian-Friendly and offered Salmon, Beef and Chicken Teriyaki for about $18-$20. Each came with a side salad, soup, lots of rice and the meat.

Service was good - they even asked my caucasian coworkers if they'd like a fork.

Place is open 24/7 which is awesome! I wish I could find one here.

Prices are obviously a bit inflated and pricey but I didn't expect anything otherwise. It's Vegas - everything is expensive!

I'd honestly go back to Dae Jang Keum if I ever stay on that end of the strip again :)",BI_PXSF5M61S8O9bqR7VVA,11,9,3,2agEaHanKEgDBaJ523mUmA

Some lady got some menus and sat us in the table in the back. There were about 5 tables of people dining in at the moment. We waited 10 minutes for waters (the waitress did not seem to know much about the menu at all, we asked her about the all you can eat bbq and she had to keep going in the back and asking somebody if rice was included) and maybe another 15 to order the first round. We ordered 3 gold all you can eat. Not sure if anyone really spoke much English. (Not a problem). Apparently you can only order 3 meats at a time, so we waited to order the next round about 15 minutes. Still not full, we waited THIRTY MINUTES to order the next round. Meanwhile, the two younger women who we thought worked there (because they had gotten us waters and rice etc) were sitting down, chatting with their friends while the older woman was weeded and working her ass off. Inexcusable. Nobody even came to check up on us. We were still hungry but decided not to order, because it would take a while (and nobody came back to the table) awful service, but I do commend the older woman for working so hard while the younger ones just sat there with friends. 

THERE WAS NO DISCOUNT. It even says 20% discount on the door on both sides and there are no disclaimers or exclusions that are mentioned on the paper. The lady refused to give us any discount and was rude about it too. She said that all you can eat is not included in discount. Nobody told us that, and we even asked about it earlier. Never coming back here again. Poor service, but the food was ok. Not worth the price especially since we did not get money's worth.

I have to admit that the restaurant itself is probably the nicest and cleanest Korean BBQ place I have ever been to. It looks practically brand new. 

Then I opened the menu and discovered that each plate of meat cost at least 20 dollars. It took me aback a bit because I'm used to eating at all you can eat places for under $20. So I started to rationalize; maybe the plates of meat are huge portions or of higher quality. That was not the case. Each plate was a sufficient portion for one person and the meat was no better than the aforementioned all you can eat joints.

Our waitress was really nice but she seemed to be the only person working the floor. This is one of those places where the waitress does the cooking for you so due to the fact that she was inundated with tables and we were hungry, we ultimately had to take over cooking duties for her. She was extra good though about making sure we had enough sides.

For four plates of meat and a couple of cokes, we ended up paying close to $140. Not worth it!!",ffarmP6gowdXoTxQARKU7A,0,0,2,MMeKiFqSIX2rwoHebK2-hA

Ok back to the real deal; it was just us two and a group of other people there but after they left it was just us, the place was not as clean as I could have remembered (and I was sober too!) the lady came by with our food the meat was frozen when she bought them out so knowing that's not really fresh at all but whatever I'm hungry, she drop one of the meat on the table and still served it to us!!! Gross!! Who knows how clean that table is I'm pretty sure they don't clean down the table with anti bacterial spray or anything but a wet towel because I notice that while she was cleaning the other table after the last group left whatever food is food just hope I don't get sick!!! Really when you're here if they put that meat on the grill and ask you not to touch it trust me you're going to have to touch it and flip it yourself by the time they come back to flip the meat for you you'll be eating burnt meat yep that's how it is every time here so yeah I gave this place another chance and it's just sad how their service hasn't improved not only that the food wasn't that flavorful.

Anyways I really liked this place at the beginning I reaaaaally hope they improve on their service and their food can be better I just know it.

Their banchan is great, lots of variety...and they have the cucumber kimchi.  To me, that is a HUGE plus...that actually might be the only reason I come here!  Service is usually pretty snappy, the food is good...obviously I've had better but for the price and in this location, I can't ask for too much more.  I usually opt for the L.A.(?) combo, which consists of sundubu and galbi.

HONESTLY this place was probably the only Korean place that I was able to eat at when I FIRST moved out to Vegas.... the place is big & they also have a glass private area if you have a large party as well.

The service is quick & yet sometimes they can be overwhelmed but they are definitely under staffed sometimes. We know most of the workers.. so they always attend to us in the best way... but HONESTLY don't expect that sweet timely attentive & conversating expectations you would get at an American resteraunts... these ladies are there to get your order & get your food out as fast as possible..... 

We came here very often when we didn't feel like cooking BBQ at home & didn't want to clean up the grease mess. 

The quality of meat is good & I would have to say we get very full. 

THE KING $83.95- combination of meats probably the largest portion....  sirloin beef, beef short ribs, marinated beef short ribs, beef brisket, soy bean soup, steamed egg, combination veggies, soju bottle. You also get rive if you ask & all the BANCHAN is good... like actually good side dishes. 

They have happy hour everyday where you get 20% off your bill after 11pm! We always eat that late too especially when we get off work =]",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,7,4,4,BApQu7NTi-lvOYe_KUQAjA

So around Dinner time I jumped into Pats Audi A6 Whip with his lovely wife Marla and Pats Posse and rolled to DJK .  DJK is one of Pats Finds and he has been going there for years . Pat rolls deep with an Entourage we rolled in to DJK with around 20 people. 

They gave us the Private Room with 2 Large Tables with 2 BBQ Grills per Table . It was a Hungry Posse so 5 King Meal Packages , Seafood Pancake's and 4 Orders of Pork Belly  . 
There were numerous bottles of Soju ordered and drunken lol. 

Our Server was a little Overwhelmed and Spilled a Large Glass Of Water into my Lap . LMao it was a rude awakening to say the least.

But the Food was off the chain good - Beef , Ribeye steak, Bulogi  and Pork Belly grilled right at the Table by the Servers . We all had tongs to pull the Cooked Meat off the grill Yummy!!

All the Banchan you can eat. The Seafood Pancakes were Delicious !!!

Service was good except for the Water Spillage.

I walked in to the restaurant because I had questions about the AYCE options and I wanted to scope out restaurants in the plaza before my family and I committed to one for dinner. The hostess was on the phone and was unable to answer my questions. That's fine. I've worked service jobs before, I know the deal. I turned to an older woman in uniform and asked her if they had prices for AYCE that I could see. She said ""no"" and turned away. At this, I was sooooo confused. How do you just answer no to a question that requires actual answers? I figured it must be a misunderstanding and I ask another older woman (again, not the hostess) about AYCE options and prices. She gives me a clearly exasperated and annoyed look and says ""We don't have AYCE here."" I felt that this must be a joke. Previous Yelp users had talked about it in their reviews. There was literally a sign on the front that said they had AYCE options. I don't know if they didn't want my business or if they just didn't feel up to answering but I wasn't going to stick around to find out.

I left immediately. Tip for the owners: manage your workers appropriately and teach them how to act. That way you'll actually be able to have customers during the peak dinner time hours.",vM6Uoprp-f_BotmqpwA2yw,1,0,1,BStj-SB_bjkCLHofZe_YaA

The two watching over our table did a very good job of asking if we were doing ok, and I guess we looked like noobs cause the lady ended up doing it for us. No matter, as I was too buzzed to be wanting to be playing grill master. I also learned some tips on cooking for the next time.

The array of banchan was great, and provided extra layers of flavor to the grilled meat. You can refill as much as you'd like. OH... and I almost forgot, our meal came with a little bottle of Soju as well which was a nice accompaniment to the meal.

I came here the first time after a night of raging and I was sooo hungry our group decided to go cray at kbbq. The food was good, we were drunk punks so my taste buds can't be too accurate but it was satisfying.

The second time I came here, I didn't even get to eat here, or step inside the restaurant. I came here again this past weekend after a weekend of drinking of course and we wanted to eat and Pho Kim Long line was pretty long and its chilly.
We remember we came to this KBBQ place from last time and we decide to go see if theres a wait. They have pretty large windows so we're looking inside and there is literally like 3 tables there. So I'm getting hella happy like yay! we can eat here without a wait. We go up to the door, the lady doesn't even let us IN the restaurant. We tell her we want to eat, she just nods and mumbles something and PROCEEDS TO CLOSE THE DOOR AND LOCK IT IN OUR FACE.

what. the. hell. I swear I was not being a DAB, I was sober and cold and hungry. AND I CAN SEE PEOPLE EATING IN THERE. what the heck is going on??

we kept trying to think, wait why would she not let us in? we are all changed into our regular clothes, pants and jackets. But that can't even be the case because last time I ate here I was straight up in my rave clothes. 

Needless to say I will NEVER EVER be going back here. I have never ever had such an experience with a restaurant where the employee closed the door and locked it IN OUR FACE.

I've tried other things on their menu (Japchae, various soups) but if you're Korean, you know soups, stews, and casseroles at restaurants are never as good as your mother's. The meat at this place though is great.. I usually get one of the combo sets. For 2-3 people, the Love combo set is perfect. It comes with 3 cuts of meat, daenjang jjigae, gaeran jjim (steamed egg), and your choice of drink (soda, beer, or soju bottle). Rice, sauces, and banchan are a given. The meat is always fresh, the portions are HUGE, and for the Love combo it's like $40. AND don't forget you get a discount for being a NV resident after 11pm!! Also, this place is open like 24hrs and a few blocks from the strip so you don't have to drive your drunk ass too far and risk getting caught before getting some food to soak up that alcohol before driving the rest of your way home.",ddnaCZqDO_swmwqHjSJaWw,0,0,4,bDcWWAVfz0af1lSMsYgNpw

After a night of hard drinking and partying I was in the mood for some spicy tofu soup.  The tofu soup I wanted to originally go to was closed on Sunday so we settled for this place.  

It was very slow and empty for a typical Sunday afternoon.  I guess everyone is still resting up after partying so hard?  Upon entering we were greeted and ushered to our table.  The restaurant is a decent size and looks like it could hold a lot of people.  The three of us all ordered seafood spicy tofu soup.  

Just before the food came out I realized they did not ask me how spicy I wanted my soup.  I prayed they make it super spicy the way I like it.  

Well, it was a big disappointment.  We all agreed the soup lacked flavor.  It was so bland and tasteless.  The seafood they put in there is a joke.  It was near nonexistent and the pieces were so tiny I barely tasted anything.  

The service was good.  Our server was attentive and was kind enough to refill our banchan when asked, but never offered to refill our teas or water.  Of all the restaurants and food Las Vegas has to offer, I'll explore other restaurants and will most likely not return due to the fact that my stomach space is limited when I visit and would like to try out other places.",wbe3nWYyjwaw_bgebBBaQA,2,0,2,VRHgwfFGjVOrZLcZ1TR1KA

The dish I had was the spicy tofu which comes with an egg in it as a choice. It was good and filled me up quickly. Theyre generous with the sides too. Sides include broccoli, fried tofu, raddish, bean sprouts, and more that I cant think of right now. They are also willing to refill any of them if youd like. Seems like most of their tofu dishes are spicy or comes with meat, so if youre a vegetarian that doesnt like spicy things you might not enjoy it here.

Service was good and there was nothing to complain about really.

Environment is nice with wifi. Its a nice place to gather friends in I think, but I dunno since I have none.

They offer metallic chopsticks which I don't like since it has less friction, but in all fairness of the restaurant they do last longer and are easier to clean.

Pros: good food, service is on par, wifi, generous side dishes

Cons: tofu is limited to either spicy or served with meat and aluminum chopsticks if you care for that.

3785705,2007-03-15,1,WO1sgbYB6u6VVcvChanp5g,"Update (4/22/07):  So I know I said I'd never be back cos my first experience here was pretty bad, but Boyfriend's Japanese class gets together once in a while, and they decided to go here. I was dreading it at first, but I am extremely glad we went cos this time, everything was just so much better. I'm not sure if it was because we went during full-price hours or if it was because we were with a large group, or maybe they just decided to be nice that day. I can't really say. One thing's for sure, though...I was glad for the change.

I'm kind of at awe at how different the two experiences I had there were. The food was sooo much better! The meat actually had some flavor, and that disgusting garlic oil crap from last time was actually a pleasant dipping sauce this time. Even the little side dishes were better! And the salad was just as good.

The service was also loads better. They actually took care of us! I feel like that's pretty darn important when eating out. Our waiter was extremely patient with the ordering process, since it always takes a while to decide how the ordering and sharing goes down in big groups. They filled our water cups, they flipped the meat for us, and they actually cut the big mushrooms that come with it, which we definitely noticed since it was impossible to eat those the first time.

Two bad things from this trip: chopsticks and bathroom. This place should definitely invest in some better chopsticks because trying to eat with these sharp-edged-blocked chopsticks was painful. The whole all-black thing with their bathrooms might be cool (or creepy) since it kind of reminded me of Magneto, but one toilet was backed up and the other had pee (or some other liquid, since all I saw was black) all over the seat and ground. Ew. But I guess that's more the fault of stupid customers, eh? I'm sure it'll be cleaned up by the end of the day... =\

Despite those two things, it was really a great experience this time around. I wish I could give it more stars, but I'll just say this is an average of the two times I've been.

---------------------------------------------

I can't say I've been to many Korean barbecue places, but I do know I enjoyed every single one until I came to this one. Perhaps we just didn't know how or what to order. But I feel like that should never be much of a problem with restaurants. Even if it's not the favorite item that everyone orders, it should still be somewhat good.

So we ordered some beef that was extremely bland. It was also pretty fatty and came with a sort of garlic oil dipping sauce that just made it even more fatty. I still had the icky taste of the oil in my mouth the next morning even after some good brushing, flossing, and rinsing. The glass noodle dish that we got after was pretty good. It was definitely the better of the two. I didn't care much for all the little side dishes, but the beef one and the kimchi were pretty good. The salad that came with everything was good as well. It just sucks that the main 'bbq' part of our meal was the worst.

The place looks nice inside, and it's pretty spacious with comfortable booths. The service was nice when it came, although it was pretty sporadic. I think the prices are comparable to other Korean places, but the place did kind of redeem itself with it's 20% off happy hour from 11pm-8am. (They're open 24 hours.) I hear it used to be 50% off when they first opened, and you'll only find me back there if they fall back to that.",tbXhMtRaWgscqbD6U_PV5A,2,1,3,0twu-F0OnUTsecpdzN2r8w

When I come with my family, we'll grill one of the combos - usually Jack and ask to substitute the pork belly with more brisket. It's a good portion and comparatively the same as the others in town except there are more side dishes. Hobak is good but it doesn't have all the sides we like and at DJK it comes with the bean paste stew and coddled steamed eggs. We also don't drink so we get sofa versus the soju.
I'm Korean and grew up in Los Angeles so I'm looking for authentic Korean taste and DJK hits the spot. I'm here for lunch or dinner several times a month.
Overall, they do well. It's easy. Also, it's one of the few places in Vegas where they make naengmyun from scratch. If you like the bibim naengmyun spicy, they do a great version, although I'm not a fan of the meat pieces in naengmyun. 

Their kimchi is always ripe and starting Nov, they introduced new kimchi stew that's really good. I ask them to add rice cakes (dduk) to it. It's really tasty.

Over the years, I think they've gotten enough non-Korean speakers so their service has improved. Recently I noticed one of their serving staff doesn't speak Korean, so that was new.

Their main problem is that the facility has been around for 20 years or so, it's not shiny. But in terms of food, it's pretty good. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,0,0,4,XzBEkEWs5a6aFKiO2hgJvg

4305132,2015-12-21,3,WO1sgbYB6u6VVcvChanp5g,"Saying this place is terrible is an understatement.. I wish I could give it 0 stars.  My mother, sister and I were visiting Las Vegas for a few days (we are Korean btw so you can count on us to know what good Korean food is supposed to taste like).  We decided to come here for a late bite at around 11:30pm on a Friday night.  When we walked in, the entire restaurant was COMPLETELY empty with no background music playing, making the place look sad and desolate.  The fact that it was completely deserted on a Friday night definitely irked us..

We got seated by a woman that seemed like she was either the manager or owner.  She seemed pretty off-putting and did not put any effort with welcoming us in, especially when we were the only customers in the entire place.  When we tried to order our food, she told us that a lot of the basic menu items we wanted (all buckwheat noodle ""nengmyun"" dishes, all smaller beers, etc) were unavailable after 11pm, giving the excuse that they have to turn a specific set of their cookers off which are used for the nengmyun noodles.. To me, this is pure laziness.  Because of this, we decided to get a bibimbap order for each of us.

She gave us waters, which tasted like terrible tap water.. At first I thought it was really weak Korean barley water, but then realized that they were serving us tap water that just tasted (and smelled)  disgusting.  We didn't even touch the water, which is sad seeing that it's pretty hard to mess up WATER.

Then they brought out our side dishes (banchan), which tasted either old or poorly cooked.  The kimchi was not even edible-- it tasted very old and sour, and had that 'carbonated' taste which only happens when old kimchi sits too long in the fridge..  The bean sprouts (kongnamul) was undercooked and also inedible.  The blanched spinach side dish also tasted old and was too soggy, as if it was leftover from the entire day at the restaurant.  All the other banchan was mediocre to say the least.  None of it tasted fresh, and was so bad that it even made me lose my appetite a bit.

Finally, our main bibimbap dishes came out, along with a small side of anchovy soup for each of us.  My mom and sister ordered the stone-pot bibimbap while I ordered the regular one.  The white rice that came in their dishes were overcooked and soggy, which made their entire bibimbap dish inside of the stone pot too ""wet"" and mushy... The bibimbap themselves were pretty mediocre too, and I doubt that any of the veggies in them were fresh, just like the banchan they gave us. The anchovy soup was also cold by the time it reached out table, which we barely touched.  In the end, we couldn't finish any of our bibimbap food because of how un-appetizing and tasteless everything else was.  The red pepper paste (kochujjang) that we used in our dishes was more flavorful than the actual veggies and meat in the bibimbap itself...

I couldn't finish most of my bibimbap, so I decided to get the rest of it to-go in an effort to maybe cook it into something tastier.  When I asked for a to-go box, the lady looked at me and my food, then condescendingly says in Korean ""if you take it to-go, the food and rice will get bloated and it won't taste good..""  Um, excuse me but I didn't ask for your two-cents.  The lady gave us the check and only one small to-go container, so I asked if she could get us another one.  She looked at me as if I made an impossible request, then comes back with another container and a bag, in which she dropped and left on my seat.

After we left the restaurant, we couldn't stop talking about how terrible the food there was.  Yes, it was really that bad.  Maybe their food and BBQ is better during the day, but if that is the case then they really shouldn't have the business open 24/7 if the food can't be consistent!

TL;DR-- You don't go to Vegas to seek amazing Korean food per se, but even so this restaurant doesn't come close to making it on that map.  Very disappointing place and none of their food tasted fresh or even decent.  One of the worst Korean places I've been to in a very long time.  Terrible customer service.  Very unfortunate that many items on their food+alcohol menu is unavailable after a certain time at night, seeing that they are open 24/7.

That is why I was very surprised with the slow service. We ordered very fast and waited for our banchan and waited a little longer...and waited for about a good 15 minutes after ordering and finally they arrived, I loved the dried fish and the algae thingy, but immediately they brought our tofu soups and kalbi, so I got a little annoyed, fortunately the soup is hot enough (not as hot as other places serve it) that it could wait, but the kalbi couldn't, so we had to eat real fast. Since they were not extraordinarily busy the slow service was a dissapointment. 

As for the food. The tofu soup was not the best one I have had, but I'm spoiled by LA Koreatown restaurants, but it was not too bad, it was edible and just what I needed today.  It is also pricier than other korean restaurants in other cities. The Korean bbq seemed overly priced, I usually pay no more tnan $15 per person in LA or even Rowland Heights. The Kalbi was good, small pieces cooked well. 

Probably would only come back after a night of drinking for the 20% off and 24 hr service, which is definitely a plus for them. I will try the other place next time and see where they stand.

Tonight, a group of us that work in the same kitchen on the strip went out together. We got there around 11pm and requested a table for 7-9 people as we weren't sure how many were showing up.  We were told it would be 15 minutes, as another part was almost finished and they needed to clean up, so we waited.

We were told our table was ready, and then no one showed us where it was. Being that it isn't a large restaurant, we found the table and sat down.  This is where it fell apart. We waited over 30 minutes to get menus, at which point I simply went to the front and asked for them. Shortly there after, our server showed up and her exact first words to us were ""Yeah what do you want?""

We ordered 3 bbq dishes, japchae, 2 dumpling apps and she said ""this it?"" and then scolded us for not having the full 9 (we had 6).  20 minutes later she brought out our side dishes and yelled at us for not being squeezed to one end of the table.  We proceeded to adjust seating to try and lessen the load on her (we figured that was what might be upsetting her, having 3 of the 5 occupied tables in the restaurant).  She brought out our food, threw some meat on the grill and we never saw her for the next hour.

I cooked our food on the tabletop grill. I cut our meat, I served all of us the food that was cooked, and I even cleaned up and stacked the used dishes in the hopes she might notice and maybe take them, or refill our drinks.  Long after we had finished eating, she simply threw the check presenter onto the table and walked away.  4 of us fought over paying, all threw in cards, so I walked to the front and asked the split the $100 check four ways. She said no, said a few things in Korean that I wasn't able to understand (I do speak a bit), then told me she would only split in on two cards. 

After this experience, I will more than likely not be going back to DJK, despite their galbi being excellent.  I've never in my life had such a bad experience with a server, and I've been working as a chef for over 15 years (and have caused my share of servers to leave in tears/had them screaming at me in the middle of the kitchen).",UU-VxG_dXqxsY0IK9PNldw,0,0,1,nTxAjjtTNCceYRCH0qUddQ

LAYOUT
spacious and very comfy.   the lighting is bright and the decor is welcoming.  my friend pointed it out and i agree that this place is vented very well - for those who hate leaving a BBQ smelling like grease.^^*

SERVICE
prompt and attentive, although lacking in cheer...   i honestly think ""cheerfullness"" is a key service and a convincing reason to the customer that they should look forward to the meal.    but, like i said before, service is attentive and they made sure i did not wait to eat my meal by each dish before i finished with the last.

FOOD

PRICING
a bit under the average cost of other Korean BBQs in Vegas.   surprising, despite it's prime location (nearest to the highway exit).

1. Banchan sides: 
The usual stuff, but my favorites were the kimchi and cucumbers. I would like to point out that their version of potato salad was just sad. It was bland and did not taste very good.. it was at that moment that I was truly appreciative of all the korean restaurants in SoCal that were able to make this side right. Blessed for reals! 

2. Kimchi Stew: 
This definitely hit the spot! I have been obsessed with kimchi stews lately and I think this was just as tasty as the one from home ! The stew consisted of some rice cakes, meat and of course can't forget the kimchi! 

Two star deduction: 
1. Service: 
This aspect of the business was horrible! Took forever to wave over a server to take our order and when it came time to get the check I had to walk to the front to request for the check which was ridiculous!

Truthfully, I give their tofu stew maybe 3 out of 5 stars. I enjoy it every single time but it's certainly no BCD soondooboo from LA or sogongdong from the east coast. I have yet to find a tofu stew that can match up to either cities in Vegas. I always ask for it as spicy as humanly possible, and they bring it out mild to medium-hot almost every time. 

One of the great things they offer on their menu is their combination (tofu stew + galbi, korean short-ribs) for $14.95 so with the locals discount 20% off, it's a fantastic deal. 

I have tried various other items on the menu and the food is overall good... so I WOULD recommend it to people; however, do not expect the greatest of service. Usually the ladies are extremely kind and friendly, but they are understaffed every single time I go. There's 1 waitress running around with her head chopped off serving a handful of tables bbq, side dishes, drinks, etc...  Korean bbq is supposed to include full service (grilling the meat, refilling side dishes)... basically extra attention than your average restaurant. With 1 waitress and anything over 4-5 tables... be prepared to feel ignored. Don't take it out on the waitresses though, they're usually the sweetest of Korean ladies busting their butts!",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,0,0,3,m7en4fla-0qSJzSnp8mGUA
4616134,2016-05-07,1,WO1sgbYB6u6VVcvChanp5g,"After asking for the check, we reviewed it and found that the Korean lady had added a 15% tip charge on the bill, even though there was only two of us. She told us in broken English that it was automatically charged. At first we were going to tip her pretty well since she tried to cook the food on the grill for us, but to be honest she didn't do a very good job at it. She angrily told us that she'll fix it and she promptly came back. She then threw the check down and old us that we had to tip her the minimum of 15%, which was about 11 dollars. Obviously at that point we just paid the amount that was due and did not leave her a tip at all. 

I can't believe that she had the audacity to force us to tip her. We are never going back to a sketchy place like this again. If you do go, watch out for them adding a gratuity fee.",b9DIahYZ6gJDk-GdKbnS9g,3,0,1,mpcOTNB4LYo2H3LJhcEG7A

Korean BBQ or Mr. Tofu.  After checking out their small and simple menu at Mr. Tofu, we decided we liked the 'full' Korean experience that D.J.K. was offering.

With no wait on the past Memorial Holiday for dinner, we were seated at  a booth right smack in the middle.  After perusing their extensive menu, we opted for their Dwaeji Galbi (Grilled Pork Ribs) at $22.95, the BF's favorite of Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap (Steamed rice with vegetables and beef to mix in the hot stone pot) at $14.95, and the Mul Naengmyeon (Buckwheat noodles with vegetables and meat in chilled broth) at $8.95 based on their picture.

About nine different banchan was brought to us after our order went in.  It included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, salad, marinated octopus with pickled cucumbers, daikon, omelet, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, broccoli and some kind of dipping paste.  The salad had a nice dressing to it, and was pretty good.  The octopus was pretty yummy as well.

We soon discover they are out of Dwaeji Galbi, and ordered the Sanggalbi (Premium beef short ribs) at $26.95 instead.  The beef was good. It wasn't fabulous for the price we paid.  The Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap was average.  At first, the rice seemed a bit mushy.  But the stone pot that it came it really crisped up the rice very well.  (Apparently, this was the best the BF has ever had in terms of crispiness.)  The Mul Naengmyeon didn't quite look like the picture it was presented in.  It came with two slices of beef, one hard boiled egg, some veggies, and few pine nuts.  We asked the waitress about it before ordering and she was honest in her opinion, noting that although she enjoys it, it's a bit different for other people.  It's a cold noodle soup dish and I found it refreshing on a hot day.  They also give you vinegar and horseradishy mustard to mix it up with and this gives the broth the much needed quick.  

Back in the city, I'm used to getting tea automatically.  But I guess here, you have to ask for it.  At least they don't charge for it though.

I like how the tables are set up here.  At other Korean restaurants, they have to bring this container of hot coals to your table and it's pretty dangerous.  But here, they just turn it on with their gas stove.  And if you aren't going to cook the meat yourself, they simply put the cover on and it's flat like the rest of your table.  

The BF was still eating when the cashier girl brought our check to the table.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert.  (They offer creme brulee, ice cream, etc.)  Asking if they had any shikhye and learning they did not, we were a bit disappointed.  (Had to visit the Asian supermarket next door to get some!)

Service - we had the long-haired waitress.  There's this one short-haired waitress that was not so friendly.  When she initially asked us if we were ready to order, and we asked for another minute, she made a ""Huff!"" sound.  The BF and I looked at each other like, ""WTF?!""  Thank goodness the smiley long-haired waitress ended up serving us the rest of the evening and she made up for the bad customer service of the other one.

Side note: The restrooms have these gigantic square sinks.  Watch out for the first stall in the ladies' room 'cuz there's a huge puddle right in front and I think they might have a leakage problem per the previous yelper who mentioned the mess too.

Wow, low slung (strip malls) see the irony? with hundreds of shops & restaurants. Chinese / Vietnamese / Korean / Japanese. WOW ! Its the Asian invasion of Vegas. Felt like we were explorers who discovered China (oooops I guess it is hard to ""discover"" since a lot of people live there, to digress even further:  there is a movement to change the record that Chinese merchant seaman discovered America many of hundreds of years before you know who sailed the ocean blue in 1492). Anyhoooo once my fingers hit the key board, they just keep going. 

Chose the DJK cos: 

1. they were busy but didn't have a long line

 2. after a brief walk through (under the ruse to use the bathroom) it was very clean with powerful exhaust fans for the bbq smoke. Alert... not all tables have the bbq grill & fan, so if you are goin  to get the bbq fare, tell them !

3. greeter / sitter / cashier was nice & cheerful, I asked her if we needed to sign in, she responded I know the order and points to the two groups ahead of us....they are #1, and they are #2 and you are #3. Well we had 3 in our 'party' the other groups each had 4+ people. Low and Behold a table for 3 comes up. It was kinda like that old slot machine (since we are on the Vegas thing) where you win if 3 cherries land on the line....anyhooooo I point this out because the greeter then explains to the 2 other parties that a 3 person bbq table just came up and she would like to sit us there ! Wow, courtesy and class at a strip mall in China Town, not to say my expectation did not include those qualities, but at that moment I knew ""its goin to be good"".

The food at DJK:

Ordered the 3 person set bbq meal (I forget the name, but it was something like 3 queens), a variety of beef (including a sirloin steak) & marinated pork. I think it was $60 or $ 65. With steamed egg (kinda a egg thing like Japanese shawanmushi (sp?) = great,  tofu soup = great (really tasty not tooo salty), kimchi etc. etc. etc. One accompanyment that stood out was the marinated Daicon  (sp?) thin sliced with a delicated marinade - the best. Meat was tender & very fresh. For us tooo much for 3 people, had some of everything left over, and the wait person  asks if we would like to take it to go ? Hmmmm let me think, I am staying at ARIA with no utensils, no plates, and I am going to take bbq meat and aromatic kim chee into the room ? Ahhh no. It pained me to leave behind this great food. 

The service at DJK:

Awesome. Attentive & considerate. My only comment would be is that they want to load of the bbq thing with a bunch of meat at once. I kinda had the feeling that it was a ""turn-over"" strategy, since this shortens the time, wouldn't want the diners to slowly and individually grill.... I can hear ""too much time, load grill up, go back stir it up"". I actually think they believe it is part of the good service thing. We did not feel rushed.

Food: 2 - The silverware is kept on a box near the wall, which I don't like. I feel that it's very unsanitary since anyone can touch your spoon. Also, walls near tables can be the dirtiest places--not a good space for spoons! 

The sides were of average quality in both food and taste. I didn't like any of them--not even the kim chi. For lunch, I had a lunch special bento box that had beef ribs, rice, an egg omelet/roll, pot stickers and a salad. Everything was average, none of it was tasty. Probably the best thing that I ate was the white rice. It was a pretty big disappointment considering how many reviews they had.

//Tip: The only thing I liked about this restaurant was that they provided their WIFI password on the wall of every table, which was really nice and useful. 

Other than that, I say pass this restaurant over. There are better places.",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,7,3,2,ZrixshWjzyY4RS-jSNIVfQ

I was seated right away by the host and because my friend was on her way, we wanted to try and order ahead of time since she was on her 1 hour lunch break from work. Once I was seated, I waited for about ten min for a waitress to come by so I can quickly put our orders in. As I was looking around for someone, I noticed it was not busy at all with only three tables occupied on the other side of the restaurant. The host (who happened to be walking by me) saw that I needed someone. When he finally came to the table, I told him I was ready to order and if he can find out who the waitress is. He just stood there and asked what I wanted to order. It was sorta odd for him to take the order but I didn't care because no one even came to say hi. As for the food, I ordered from the lunch special menu: bulgogi bento box for me and spicy tofu soup with kimchee for my friend. Everything was delicious and we were surprised that the portions were huge for a lunch special. They were even decently priced too. We only saw our waitress a few times- once for the food, another time to give us two glasses of water, and lastly, to hand us the check. The entire time we were eating, she didn't even bother to refill our waters or even check in on us from time to time to see if we needed anything. We had to flag that same host just to ask for hot sauce since we could not find our waitress anywhere. 

Overall, I only gave this place three stars for the food and the lunch special prices. Other than that, this place has poor customer service. I gave this place a try and I can definitely say I won't be coming back.

We strolled into Dae Jang Keum and thought, hmmm it smells pretty good... and the pleasant experience went downhill from there. As we were deciding what to order, we wanted to order a smaller package (bbq for 3 and then 3 apps since there were 3 girls and 2 guys... typically Asian girls don't eat a lot either) for the bbq so we could order more sides and apps.  We weren't trying to be cheap, we just didn't want a bbq buffet at our table when we wanted to try some appetizers. Well, this didn't sit too well with the waitress... but also keep in mind we were heading to the airport shortly... who wants to smell like bbq on a 5 hour flight? Anyway, after ordering, whatever we asked for afterwards... like more tea, clean plate, utensils, whatever you name it, she would give us a dirty look and just  plopped it on our table. It was also uncomfortable to ask when the soju we ordered was coming.

Overall, the food was pretty decent. It was delicious and the price was alright.

I seriously could not do it. I witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that could've gotten it into some major trouble if I wanted to complain about it. So instead of going straight to the health district, Im just going to let people who care enough to take time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future. 

The other night at 4AM, I went to eat there with my boyfriend. We were around the area and decided to eat Korean food since that place was opened all night and had 20% off everything on the menu until 8AM. On first impression walking in, the place seemed clean and spacious with about three booths occupied at that time. The place itself is rather larger than most Korean restaurants, had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60+ people. It was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends. But, that was about it on the plus side of our experience.

The only waitress working there did not greet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us. She was unfriendly, did not speak understandable English and looked as if she was pissed off because we had walked in and now she had more work to do. She sat us down at the table and I saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons. She didn't get us water or anything right away. I know most places, that's considered bad service, but I wasn't that picky to fuss about it at that time.The menu itself was similar to most Korean places. It had tofu soup, bbq and combination plates. Nothing too out of the ordinary, however, the price was about $5 more expensive than most places like Tofu Hut and Mr. Tofu. We got the combo with seafood tofu soup and Korean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for $2. She did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes. When we ordered the soup, she didn't ask us about our preferred spice levels and didn't even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered. All she did was write it down, said nothing looking away, and walked off leaving us kind of dumbfounded. 

The side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people. I understood we only ordered 1 thing, but it was a combination that is close to $16 with $2 extra for rice. She didn't care to accommodate the platings for the party at all, even when it was complimentary.  The soup itself came out boiling, but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot. No one bothered to wipe it off. It wasn't like there was a small amount, you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side. The soup itself tasted good, however. I enjoyed the taste greatly, but to be honest, it was the same as every other Korean resturaunt. Nothing that left a big difference. I noticed for the price they charged, our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very, very tiny.  When our ribs came out at last (the combo pretty much came out one at a time), there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry. What do you know, it was. The ribs itself was not marinated well enough, there was that sesame oil taste, and slightly sweet.. but that was pretty much it for the ribs. I did not enjoy the ribs at all. 

There was 2 people sitting next to us drinking the whole night we were there. On many occasions, I noticed the waitress came over and talk to them, and kept on standing there talking to them in Korean. She payed every attention to that table, and pretty much left us in a corner the whole night. She never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from us. It was dirty the whole night we were there. She even watched TV and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table. 

OKAY so are you ready for this? One of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food. He took out a cigarette and lit it up, smoking in front of our waitress. She did nothing, and continued talking to him in Korean. The other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much smoked in the restaurant, with us eating a booth away from them. My boyfriend and I were speechless. They ignored us and kept smoking. At one point, one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand, walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway. I could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being. If that was being allowed in the main lobby area, I wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods. I've gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let us use ""cups"" as ash trays. But that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this. It's like management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory. I could not believe it. This place is so corrupted.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,3,1,1,Ckxz9B2tBAXz_rn_qR8KcQ

Their Happy Hour is after 11 PM and you get 20% off your check. We come here often enough for one of the workers there to actually recognize us. 

We do realize that there are a lot of Korean BBQ places that offer AYCE and offer cheaper prices than DJK but price isn't really a factor for us. We want the quality and DJK has never failed to deliver that to us. Sure we could go to an AYCE Korean BBQ places but most AYCE Korean BBQ places in Vegas have fallen off the quality latter. 

One of my favorite things to order at DJK is their spicy tofu soup. I typically get the version with pork and at medium spicy. Always yummy. I think there only had been one time where it wasn't as flavorful but all the other times it was great. I also love how they would crack in the egg for us too. 

We also get an order of pork belly and marinated galbi. What I LOVE is that their galbi is not the thin ""LA short ribs"" or that's what they usually call them at the supermarket. Their galbi is the huge bone with a strip of meat so you're getting meat meat meat meat meat! ;) Their pork belly is always very yummy too. Some pieces maybe really fatty but it's typically a good combo of meat and fat. 

The service can be a bit slow sometimes depending on the time of night but we've never really had any major problems.

Dae Jang Keum is one of the few Korean restaurants that are open 24/7 and doesn't gouge you for it. I swear I am coming to terms with the fact that I need to make it myself, go to K-Town in LA, or move back to Korea to get some of the dishes I miss most. 

The menu is large, but has a few time restraints. Having a craving at midnight cuts down the menu, but there are still quite a bit to choose from. Katrina M. asked for something new and would make the waitress do a double take. Was there such a dish available? No, it is as mainstream as you can get. We had ordered the kimchi dolsot bibimbap($13.95). The hot stone pot  crackled while getting to our table, but sadly, there were no charred or crispy rice pieces. The flavors were still amazing. When we broke the over easy egg, the yolk and gochujang bound the rice together nicely. It is searing hot, so watch out. We had also ordered the doenjangjjigae ($9.95). Sometimes it can be too salty from the soybean paste. This one was delicious. Bits of beef, pumpkin, peppers, and blocks of tofu in a stew like broth was good to settle my upset stomach. 

From 11pm-6am you can enjoy their happy hour. Have no fear, jumping from one happy hour to another does not mean impending doom. A nice 20% off the entire check will get you food to nurse you back to health.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,4,Kz0iBFLQ5banpwSVSAcxSw

Everything was mediocre and disappointing with this restaurant.  This restaurant only has tables with the bbq grill in the center and parties of 7 are shoved into a little booth with a chair at the end.  They seriously need more table space if they are going to put out banchan and food items.  Due to the fact that the table was so crowded, a glass of water was knocked over.  The waiter...stood there and didn't offer assistance, no towel or additional napkins.  The box with the chopsticks was emtpy, we asked for chopsticks.  We had to ask a few times before chopsticks were brought over.  At one point we asked for additional napkins, and the waiter told us they were available on top of the counter and we could help ourselves!!!  Excuse me?! What did they hire you for? This last encounter with the waiter pretty much sums up the customer service at this place.  

Onto the food, the banchan consists of kim chee, pickled cucumbers and radishes, bean sprounts, mashed potato, and broccoli.  Probably the lamest combo of banchan and the least tasty version I've ever seen.  I've had food court Korean with better banchan selection.  I was craving cold buckwheat noodles, since I was introduced to it at Soyo the week before.  However, this place obliterated my craving probably forever.  The noodles are thinner than the first version I had and clumpy.  The beef broth tasted like MSG water....it was altogether a horrible dish.  The galbi was overly sweet and didn't have a nice char on the outside.  The bimbimbap was just average.  The seafood pancake also was mushy and didn't have the crispy exterior that some places can achieve.  The sundubu is definitely not as good as Mr. Tofu....there's a reason why people pick this place as plan B.  Although Mr. Tofu has a much more limited menu, the prices for basic items like tofu soup, noodles, bimbimbap are probably $5 less over at Mr. Tofu.

There was no flavor to it! The dipping sauce that came with it made it taste a lot better though. The only good thing I did eat here was the bulgogi.

Soon dubu is pretty good, one of the better ones in Vegas. Nice, hot, and packs a punch. The side dishes are okay (broccoli is awesome). Their kimchi seems like it's been fermented for a lifetime too long.

My parents both got a dish that is called Galbi with Buckwheat Noodles, which I got to taste. Basically the dish has two parts: kbbq kalbi and a cold soup with buckwheat (soba) noodles. They liked the Kalbi, but the soup was.... peculiar. It has ice in it! Like they were not joking when they said it would be cold. It was like a soupy slush, lol. There was cucumber, ginger, and jicama in it, as well as some type of meatloaf slices. The soup was sour. I wouldn't say the soup was bad, it was just strange. I guess we're just a family partial to warm soup.

My brother got the Dolsot Bibimbap, which looked outstanding. 

I ordered the Galbitang. Oh my goodness. Their Galbitang is wonderful, and I highly recommend you order it if you ever visit this place. If there is ever a rainy day when you might feel gloomy or if you feel a bit under the weather and just need a warm and cozy pick-me-up, this soup will do you wonders compared to the plain ol' chicken noodle. The soup was brothy and so full of flavor. I was given a very generous portion of meat, too. The noodles were cooked well and the green onion added enough of its own flavor to really make the dish special. I added lots of black pepper to mine and also dumped my rice into the bowl, just as I usually do with this dish. Perfection. 

I would like to comment on their Pan Chan (sp? The little side dishes each table is given to enjoy with their meals). There were two particular dishes I wasn't familiar with - the broccoli and the potato salad. Wow! These were lovely additions to the meal! I finished them completely and so quick! The broccoli was steamed and flavored with sesame oil, simple and yummy. The potato salad was chunky, but also creamy -- a potato salad that was mostly potato and not just a plain mixture of several ingredients. This potato salad highlighted the texture and flavor of the potato well and was a pleasant surprise. I tried their kimchi too, which was fine, but the kimchi at Mother's is better.
