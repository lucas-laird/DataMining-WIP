All of the meals we have had so far are really good, some we just like over others. They have taken my customization and substitutions to the meals and nailed it every time! They care about pleasing the customer and helping you stay on track with specific needs. The delivery driver always calls and/or texts to tell you he is on the way, which is nice. If you aren't home you can leave a cooler our with ice blocks and they will put the meals in there. We love the carb-less chow mein, turkey burger, turkey meatballs with spaghetti squash. All in all for meal prep and customer service, they are doing a great job! Thank you. - Cody",nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,0,0,5,OKEOvHR0VBaiw6igRS2w_w

After trying Foodie Fit for a couple weeks, it appears I have made a REALLY good choice. For a little context, I am one of those people that works at home and on the computer for hours each day. So making sure my diet is in check is really important as I don't go outside and burn a whole lot of calories. The result? I have been losing weight!

Foodie Fit has made eating way more convenient because not only is it prepared for me, it is absolutely delicious. I actually prefer their food way more than what I had been eating before. So if you are wondering if you should test Foodie Fit out, go for it! : )",N5kzO_cKRAlljd58PFTwPw,1,1,5,msfnWghdkHzCwP8_gnSsdg

736389,2017-05-06,0,k0iSRXXqw49yugl8UUpbsw,I have ordered 9 lean meals. None of them was good. All meals tasted very bland and nothing to rave about. Very dissapointed in this company and their food. Small portions which I dont mind if it was good. It tasted not fresh it was more like tv frozen food that you get for a $2 at the grocery store. It seems like they cook a bunch and put it into the freezer or into the fridge untill somebody orders or pickes it up. Dont think they cook fresh for you when you order. Its more like factory food cooked and packed waiting for you in the fridge at their pick up location. That might also be the reason why the meals dont taste fresh. Even the one eaten on the first day tasted very old. For the price I have paid I was expecting to get at least some freshness and some decent taste. Regret ordering because of all the good reviews. Dont get all the 5 star reviews about this place. I honestly dont think their food tastes that great at all. Wont be ordering again.,CEtp4S5PCLQZRe0xXNPgkw,0,0,2,e7I1rqp4djTpsEwyfTZmHQ

The problem is (at least for me) I don't like to eat the same food often. I need variety. So finally after trying to meal prep on my own to try and save money. I realized I was wasting more money by throwing out gobs of food that I meal prepped because I was sick of eating the same stuff. I mean come on. I'm not going to make 5+ different types of dishes to meal prep for a week. I was doing one big meal prep for a week and I would go for maybe 2 days of it then go out to eat the rest of the week and throw the rest of it out. That wasn't helping me lean out and I was wasting food and money. So finally I realized that in the long run this is the way to go. I personally now buy enough meal prep from here to last me and my family about a week. Changing up the selection of what to eat throughout the day for the week has been working for me and it allows me to stay on track. I've been back here 3 times now, it's relatively close by or on the way to and from work so if I forget to pre-order online it's very convenient because they have most of their meals ready to pick up or buy in their store.

1042999,2018-02-10,0,k0iSRXXqw49yugl8UUpbsw,"I have been ordering Foodie Fit for 2 months now. I decided to do this because I am very busy and do not have time to cook. In addition I suffer from high blood pressure and the frozen meals in the supermarket have a high sodium content. Before I placed my first order I read all the FAQ's, but the one that was most important to me was this question.

Is there sodium in your food? And this is the response they have posted on their website.
Most ingredients naturally have sodium in them. We use minimal sodium in our food and for those dishes that have a little added sodium, we use a small amount of organic Pink Himalayan salt.

Currently on each meal they list the nutritional content, but the one fact they omit is the sodium content. Now folks, why do you think they have omitted that piece of information up to this point? Because many people would NOT buy Foodie Fit if they knew that one meal like the Zucchini Chowmein lean had 1100 grams of sodium, spaghetti squash turkey meatballs lean has 780 grams. That is more sodium than what you would find in the frozen food section of a grocery store. And if you are eating the bulk portion, you are eating that much more sodium.

When I placed my order yesterday I noticed that they had margarita pizza and a chicken bacon pizza as choices. When I sat down to eat the margarita pizza tonight I noticed there was an additional nutritional label on the side of the box and it stated that it had 810 grams of sodium. At that point my blood started boiling. So for the last 2 months I thought I was eating a low sodium diet when in fact I have not been.

I called tonight and asked to speak with a manager, I can't recall the name of the gentleman that got on the phone, but when I explained why I was calling and told him I purchased 7 pizzas that now I am not going to be able eat, his answer was ""Well maam, if just eat a quarter of the pizza you will be well within your sodium limit of the day"" Uhmmm.....is a 1/4 of the pizza suppose to be a meal? That was the dumbest answer I ever heard in my entire life. At that point I told him to have the owner call me.

A couple of minutes later I received a call from Alex one the owners. Alex said if they made their meals with less sodium they would not taste very good and would not sell. Now while that is a true statement you need to be transparent with your consumers and NOT answer the FAQ sodium question the way it is currently answered on their website. He said they have both a doctor and a nutritionist look over the meals and guide them. I have a difficult time believing any doctor is going to agree that 1100 grams of sodium in one meal is a healthy amount.

Alex did refund my credit card for the order I placed which was $264 and offered me a $100 gift card for a future purchase. So that gesture was a step in the right direction. Alex is a very nice guy and genuinely wanted to please me.

For those of you out there that need to watch your sodium intake please make sure you ask Foodie Fit for a list of their meals with the sodium content so you can make sure you know what you are putting in your body.",e0h1czHGXwqsii99OfzmRQ,3,0,2,iaSJjoZht8i2pruBhS3zEA

1670720,2017-04-22,0,k0iSRXXqw49yugl8UUpbsw,"I have mad respect for those who meal prep every week. Although I am a decent cook, I find it time-consuming to prepare different dishes each day. I'm also a picky eater and absolutely hate eating the same thing everyday. I've also recently started working at a desk job and definitely can feel the effects. I work out but...I. Need. To. Eat. Better.  

Enter Foodie Fit.

Foodie Fit has some of the best reviews for any meal prep service in Vegas and has a few great features:

- NO minimum order required. You can order one meal or fifty (delivery service has a 4 order minimum though).

- Menu has new dishes each week! Did I mention I was picky? I'm looking forward to the new dishes I can try each week. :)

- Best of all, you can place your order the day before and have it ready the next day. No more having to store meals in the fridge for days or weeks and eating old leftovers!

This week I ordered four meals:

- Loco Moco (3/5): Good flavor, but the beef patty was a little tough to cut and chew. This is due to the leanness of the meat, but still satisfies that loco moco craving.

- Turkey Meatballs and Spaghetti Squash (3/5): I felt that the turkey meatballs were lacking something...possibly more seasoning? The marinara sauce was fairly standard as well. The star of this dish is the spaghetti squash, which had a refreshing and subtle nuttiness.

- Al pastor Chicken Tacos (4.5/5): These were BOMB. The chicken was marinated wonderfully and the tortillas were super fresh. The mango salsa was delish but a little too spicy for me. Definitely going to re-order this one!

- Custom meal, 4oz filet mignon steak, green beans, rice (4.5/5): The steak was absolutely delicious, even with minimal seasoning. Great cuts of meat should shine on their own without being drenched in A-1 sauce! Brown rice was cooked well and the green beans had a nice crunch to them. 

All in all, I'm very satisfied with my order and will definitely continue to order from here. Their pick-up location is convenient and saves you $6 if you opt out of delivery. The prices are very reasonable per meal at $8-11. A great option if you're lazy but want to stay on track with your goals (like me)!",EBbWynrvoJxKB2ykgR664A,4,0,5,mvo5PkH1FbVxmdsircrqYQ

I am a very picky eater (I've been compared to a toddler haha) and I haven't came in contact with a meal I didn't like! & every single worker here is SO nice and super helpful.

I didn't even originally get into meal prep for fitness at all. I did it because I work 10-12 hour days and have 2 little kids so it wasn't always ideal for me to pack a lunch every day so I would always end up running out on my lunch break to eat fast food OR I would meal prep my own but by day 3 I was like I'm NOT eating this same meal another day and the food would go to waste. So not only is Foodie Fit super convenient by making my food for me, I also get a completely different meal EVERY SINGLE DAY! It's marvelous. 

The meals come fully cooked all you have to do is reheat and it still taste fresh! I've also purchased too many meals at once before and froze some meals and even after being thawed out and reheated again - STILL tasted fresh. 

I'm super happy they moved closer to my house! I've been telling everyone. This place isn't just for health nuts, gym freaks, or those strictly trying to diet. It literally is for everyone. So happy I found this place. Keep up the great quality, prices and customer service and you have a customer for life!",7mPMWAXaz50pcEYJjGtnAA,0,0,5,AupKGY0qGpG5SESQVF7KWQ

Admittedly, I'm not the most hard core person when it comes to fitness, but I am into fitness, so I am fairly conscious about eating properly and eating in a timely manner. The biggest problem is, I don't have time and/or the energy for meal prepping. And when I do, my stuff is always the same over and over again and it gets maddeningly boring. So, Foodie Fit is the perfect solution. They have perfectly portioned meals, so you can eat once every three hours, and there are different plans on whether you are bulking or cutting. They also change their menus frequently so you won't get bored easily. You can purchase meals a la carte or purchase them in packages.The people there can also come up with a custom plan for you based on your needs. They are all into fitness themselves so they know what they are talking about.  If you need more meals, there are other items as well such as breakfast items, snacks and even some drinks. 
They also deliver their meals. The cost is $6 per trip. Or you can come to the store and pick it up yourself. 
Just like with everything else, any fitness regimen requires that you stick with the plan, and not do any in-the-closet cheating. These guys are such a time saver and their prices are very reasonable. I'll be using them a lot in the foreseeable future!",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,33,26,5,TKZZmPBkTyx8Pw4SZI3hTA

Unfortunately for me, I only got to try two of the meals I bought, because my husband swiped the third out of the fridge - I'll have to put my name on it next time! 

I loved the collaboration they did with Big B's BBQ, the meat was perfect, even reheated, and the slaw was so fresh and light. I also loved the spaghetti squash and meatballs - this was from the bulk side, with 3 meatballs instead of two, like with the lean side option. 

They have a variety of meal options including breakfast, and it's all freshly prepared food. I thought the prices were reasonable, the equivalent of grabbing a fast casual lunch out, and much more convenient.

3328919,2018-01-19,1,k0iSRXXqw49yugl8UUpbsw,"Well, I have a ROTD for another popular meal prep location, but I had to branch out. I wanted to give Foodie Fit a try for two reasons: smaller prices and smaller portions. The first thing I liked about Foodie Fit was the ability to decide between Lean or Bulk portions for your meals. Ironically, with my other fave meal prep place, I was having an issue with the portions being too big and was wasting a lot of food. With the ""lean"" option from Foodie Fit, I've found the perfect portion for my 20-minute lunch break. 
I tried four meals my first week: Kung Fit Chicken, Chicken Parmesan, Al Pastor Chicken Bowl, and the Tex Mex Bowl. My favorite was the Kung Fit, by far. I ordered it again for next week. Chicken Parm was good, but the spaghetti squash wasn't shredded quite enough and I had some chunks in there. The Al Pastor and Tex Mex bowls weren't bad, but I opted out of having those for a second time. The meals were lower in price than the other meal prep services, and delivery was only $7. Overall, I'm able to save about $5-10 weekly by using Foodie Fit. Over the course of the month, that's quite a bit and over the course of a year, those savings will really make a big difference. The meals are tasty, the delivery option is awesome and thrifty, and I love the portions. I am a big fan of Foodie Fit and will probably be sticking with them from now on. I hope to see some more meal options added, and maybe I'll try some of the Pressed Juices they carry in the future as well.",vbG9-F7u-WUbY9lfvadIJw,2,1,5,JXT-yLpVvLqiWY7L06GMLw

The food is worth getting excited about - it's delicious!! He uses fresh, organic ingredients in all the meals. Everything is portion controlled so I can't pig out, and he tolerates all of my annoying substitutions and requests. There are new items on the menu every couple of weeks, and they're posted on the Ninja social media pages so I always know about new options. 

The best part about the delivery service is I can get the food whenever I need it. With other services, there are set days and times for delivery. If you can't be home at that time, you get no food. With Ninja, delivery is really convenient. 

I've referred several of my friends and now my boyfriend to order from Ninja as well, and everyone loves it. 

Also, another reviewer mentioned that Ninja Fit is unlicensed, which is absolutely incorrect. It took me all of 30 seconds to look up the business license.",w1hvQ8taOfV-EpvdxjjH5A,3,0,5,4scZlWgRRw-_CukuHbtTMg

Today, I just had the Steak Bistro and it is absolutely to die for. By far the best yet. My other favorites are the Omega Mac N Cheese and the BBQ Tri-Tip.

You can either order the food on their website and pick up the next day, or you can walk on in and pick up whatever is in their fridges. Be warned that Sunday's are pretty busy as a lot of folks come in to get their lunches for the week. Best bet is to order. When you do, you're literally in and out in under a minute, as they are already bagged and ready to go. 

If location is an issue for you, delivery is only $6 so it's totally worth it, if you live far.

Ordered 4 days worth of meals and threw away the first two. The marsala tasted like watered down slop. I am conscious of what I put in my body and cook healthy meals regularly. The difference is when I cook I actually season my food so that it is appetizing. I'm not talking salt here folks, I'm talking herbs and spices that enhance the food being cooked. These folks don't seem to believe in seasoning at all. Blandest most tasteless meal prep I've ever had. Threw away the first two, the last two will probably end up joining their brethren.

Taste was ok... in my opinion not worth getting...but here comes the worst part... 

I FOUND HAIR IN MY FOOD . 

I was pretty disgusted and  just lost my appetite completely. My husband ended up calling them to tell them about the situation and they issued a replacement meal. We live on the other side of town..

The people were friendly and offered a solution to the situation, but I just can't get over it. I can't get myself to try the other meal I bought. Again the staff was really nice which is why I'm doing 2 stars instead of 1.

It made me sad to spend the last of my calories on it. My friend raved about the Egg macro muffin so I ordered one and even though I tried to eat it two days before the ""use by"" it was dry and inedible so I ended up throwing it away.

I have really liked the Kung fit chicken, the Mediterranean chicken, the Breakfast fried rice and the Turkey meatballs with spaghetti squash.

I've tried several other meal prep places across the valley and I think I like them the best. 

For context, I've been meaning to try them for several months but finally got to since they moved around the corner from my workplace. Next context, I write this as I eat my Beach Club Wrap with faux doritos (which tastes like the real thing) which is the first meal I've had from them.

Therefore, this review is on service, convenience, taste (of the wrap), and over all goodness.

Service - is on point. Despite having a steady stream of customers in and out of the doors, someone is always available to answer your questions.

Convenience - They have ready made food for a grab and go or you can place your order online (by 8pm) for pick up/delivery. They also have breakfast! If you don't want to patronize McDonalds across the street.. come here for a great healthy breakfast option!

Taste- Good and satisfying. Perfect portions for lunch.

Overall- I would buy my food from here even if I'm not trying to be healthy and proportional. I have an order in and I'm sure all their meal options are just as good as this wrap I'm eating.

It comes with the name, it's food for the fit! Every dish contained a lean option and a bulking option featuring calorie count, protein content, carbohydrate levels and so on! Everything you need to stay fit and count calories, if that's what you're in to! I know I am! 

The food was great too! Nice, light tasting without all of the horrible stuff, ahem...salt, that comes in every dish at every restaurant known to man!

5052682,2017-03-08,0,k0iSRXXqw49yugl8UUpbsw,"I live alone, and meal prepping can be easy for me because I like to cook, but most recipes make 4+ servings... so with no one else around, I end up eating the same thing every day. Which can be redundant and boring. I end up cheating on my meal plan by the end of a week AND wasting food. So I decided to give this a try, and so far Im loving it.  I can get a weeks worth of food for about the same price as my grocerys. The food is fresh, delicious and so far very filling.  I do wish they had some more options to reduce the cost a little... like a discount for purchasing a large number of meals at once.

Delivery was cheap and on time... you pick a delivery day and time window... then the day of you get a text that narrows down the time window to 1 hour. And pick up is also available.

I missed the online delivery deadline for my usual LV travel and Foodie Fit order, so I stopped by this handy shop to pick up my things. It was stocked-ish. Quite a few empty things, but I think they had more in back to refill if they could just get a break from the register. They also had some pre-made juices and frozen bread items, bars, etc.  I do kinda wish they had dessert-y things, but maybe in the future :-) hint hint.

I can't wait to be back to LV and place my next order. Their food is just so good and the guys manning the shop were super nice.",EW3jDZFPhUEKPxPMhxLN8A,1,1,5,9UiPTZspXNKDdgCO2Lwa_w

The food quality is amazing (even for the red meat) and it's seasoned but not over drenched in spices; you can order foods from their creative yet healthy menu or build your own, which works great for variety. 

The biggest advantage is that you can order THE DAY before and there are no weird subscriptions needed; this allows me to order last minute if needed, while other services I tried, despite liking them a lot, were really strict about their order cutoff (had to order the Thursday BEFORE and delivery was only on Monday ... I can't live with that much planning for food hahaha!)

If you've never meal prepped then you don't know the answer but the answer is purchasing prepared meals that are cooked and ready to eat.

Foodie Fit is awesome because it offers you a rotating menu and delivery. They also offer custom programming for their meals. You can preorder your favorites or come in and grab from the fridge.

The staff is super friendly and helpful, the food options are fun and I've become a fan of most of their offerings. My favorites are their Omega Mac and Cheese, Shepard's Pie, and Naked Mushroom Burger. Their cauliflower pizzas also help with those pizza cravings. 

I'm not so much a fan of the Chicken Parmesan but honestly that is the only meal I've had there that I'm not to be fan of. The chicken was just a bit tough.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,26,19,4,RjL3HVQ70gM0tAR0YASaSQ

The owner did not answer calls why this happened.

On top, when I looked up their license, they are unlicensed and do not have a health permit to have a restaurant, nor serve or deliver food.

The two times the food did come, it was either undercooked and raw, or overcooked and bland.
