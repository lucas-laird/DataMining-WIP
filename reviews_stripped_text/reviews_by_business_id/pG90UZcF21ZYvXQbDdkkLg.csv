226759,2015-10-18,0,pG90UZcF21ZYvXQbDdkkLg,"Couldn't wait to try this replacement for the old HK Star.  Their menu features many of the same popular and best dishes of the former restaurant.  This new place is clearly focusing on HK's weaknesses.  Imperial One is much cleaner and the service was excellent. I'm looking forward to making this new restaurant my ""go to"" place for Chinese food once again!  Their menu is extensive and prices are reasonable, especially for fresh seafood.",Wwa7RshRpvf5Ob2zeS6fng,2,0,4,sPAlDpG313RA-1FkZ6GYBA

379558,2015-12-03,1,pG90UZcF21ZYvXQbDdkkLg,"The first reason I deducted a star from this review is the name of the restaurant is not in English on the large neon signs above the door. They only way we found it was by walking the entire strip mall, looking in windows. The English name is in two inch letters on the door. We are in America after all, where English is the primary language, so that instantly made me feel a bit unwelcome! The second reason I deducted a star is the service. We did not get to complete our order or order drinks before our server rushed off. It was approx 15 minutes later before we were able to get his attention to order drinks. Then when we asked for separate checks, he was very put out by this and in a less than polite manner said if we didn't spend more than $25 they would not take our debit/visa cards. What???? So bring cash if you are not putting all meals on one tab. The three stars I did give was for the food. The food was Awesome!!!!! Delivered in a very timely manner, hot, and tasted amazing! 3 Stars for the food. --2 stars for the service. Mm",vjETkWV59TBgwP6FxcFBsw,2,0,3,n2FehpQBm3RmdQrzvOCqgA

For the first night we wanted to try something that everyone would like and found Imperial One Chinese Food restaurant, which was also near our hotel. Food was amazing! Specially the seafood! Wow, it deserves an A++! Plus! Great services! Waiters are very friendly!

2853975,2015-11-27,4,pG90UZcF21ZYvXQbDdkkLg,"Lots of private rooms and trafficked by a ton of local fans of Cantonese food.   It was smokey (-.5 star to 2.5) as I think one of the private rooms were smoking like a chimney.  While we had heard great things we would call the food average and the prices a little on the high side, so we didn't find it lived up to the hype.",IPFQA_6En6T8DE1-pCaPRA,4,5,3,-tXMdCtFqUZW9-S0laxTWw

Super good service! We were a group of 5, super loud and needy hahah. But the waiters were super cool and gave us whatever we requested!

Authentic Chinese food for a reasonable price

Used to Come when it was HK and was skeptical when we noticed it was a different name. However the food was fantastic. Service definitely lacked in all areas. Went without water for almost the entire meal after our first glass , good thing I had a bottle of water. Forgot my Coke I ordered as well.

4270667,2015-11-16,0,pG90UZcF21ZYvXQbDdkkLg,"I eat here almost every week since it had opened.  I think management is a bit not clear what customers mean to them.  There was a huge tourist of mainland chinese that was obviously drunk in their restaurant, not only were they rude sticking their butts in my face when passing by our table but one of the ladies were so drunk she fell onto my leg.  Did management say anything, no they are too busy trying to feed more alcohol to their guests, so what about me that I go there every week?  

50% off on certain dishes, it doesn't apply most of the time and they keep changing their requirements on those discounted dishes.

This week and some other week, I think they served me 'dirty' clams, I like this dish alot but it kills me to go to the bathroom every weekend and go to work with weak knees, might have to stop for a bit.   Their clams are fresh one week when there is no major event.  I went this past weekend and they had a wedding.  

This is the best place to have Hot and Sour soup, out of this world.  Authentic taste and perfect spicy and sour taste, excellent combination all the time.  

Beef tendons are very tender, so tender I was expecting it to be chicken.  Well certain people make it differently, it was fresh and up to standard.

Vegetables are in good portions and fresh, no complaints here.  Average price for a plate is about $10.00.

Tried their Sea cucumber with Mapa Tofu this weekend.  Very little portions of sea cucumbers, okay-could have bought the entire sea cucumber at the market for $10.00 but I had to spend and try it for $30.00.  

Well there's many dishes to talk about here but go when there is not alot of events, you can tell when you call them and if there is alot of background noises.  

Staff is great, love their service except when they don't realize that they always try to put me in an area that other people should be moving their tables because it is blocking them or some silly people putting their butts in my face to pass me.",7b5XWYpk9KGVb7TjtDoMKg,1,0,4,bdflOQ4eu4oDJPxASLT_dQ
4460087,2015-10-18,0,pG90UZcF21ZYvXQbDdkkLg,"Imperial One has fast service and fresh and tasty food. As soon as we arrived we were quickly seated. The waitress was polite and attentive to our needs. They have two menus. One is a huge book with pictures and the other has the daily lunch specials. We (4 people)ordered from the daily specials and we spent less then 30 dollars for baby bok choy, chow fun noodles, tofu seafood pot, and salt and pepper pork chop. Rice and tea was included. The tofu exploded with jucy flavor as we bit  into. It paired well with the seafood and vegetables and rice. The pork chop was not overly salty and kept its crunch. The bok choy had a nice garlic taste. The chow fun was ok tasting but overshadowed by the taste of the other dishes.definetly a place to visit again.",sYSRSJVuZcLEM-_kQfIRNw,0,0,4,y0u-M3K26OaILMhKngHaWA
4934526,2015-12-27,2,pG90UZcF21ZYvXQbDdkkLg,"Well, I was ready to go to HK Star and did not know that it changed owners to Imperial One. After spending a week in good ole San Francisco with some amazing and simple Chinese Food, we decided to come here on Christmas Day to celebrate and not cook.  Of course, i am looking for the traditional simple Chinese American fare, not American Chinese fare and i was not disappointed.

1. Decor - It is the same as when it was HK Star and even the sign on the building says HK Star. They do have some semi-private booths to sit in now.  If you need tables for 6 or 10 people or if you want to reserve a few tables for a larger group, it is very easy to do here and accommodating.

2. Menu - New menu, lots of pictures, and well, i got confused just for a wee bit because I was used to the old menu and where to find everything.

3. Prices - Seemed to have gone up a few dollars here and there, however, the prices in general are excellent.

4. The Food - Ahh, I really enjoyed this.

a. Imperial Chicken - This is the white ginger scallion steamed chicken that is full of flavor, juicy and also I feel very healthy.  This was an excellent dish and we ordered the whole chicken vs. half.  Reminds me of home and gnawing down on some excellent and simple chicken.  For those of you that are more into Panda Express type, remember that these chickens have the bone in them and are ""chopped"" right at the restaurant, so you have bones and bone bits as well.  The best tasting chicken is on the bone!

b. Oyster Sauce Chinese Broccoli - Ummm, this was gone in like 60 seconds. Perfectly al dente with the right amount of oyster sauce and oil on it.

c.  Grilled Lamb with Cumin - Very tasty. Would have preferred a sautéed lamb vs. one that was fried, however, it was tasty.

d.  Steamed Flounder - Gotta have steamed fish to get that whole perfect taste of cilantro, green onion, minced ginger, heated oil, soy sauce over the steamed fish. The meat is flavorful and tender, juicy and well, only some bones were left. I order the flounder because it is generally half price or more compared to getting one of the market priced bass or rock cod.

e.  Minced Garlic String Beans - We all love our veggies and this was just right. The string beans were very fresh and cooked to the right level of firmness and biteability.  Crunchy, and not too crunchy.

f.  Pork Chops - Loved these small cut up bits of pork chop on the bone.  Slightly fried with garlic it was very tasty.  Had to be careful fort he bones as they were hard to see with the fried coating.  I may order salt and pepper pork chops in the future though.

g.  Bitter Melon with Beef - love this dish. Absolutely love it.  It was perfect.

h.  Where was the soup - Normally at HK Star, if you are ordering family style they bring out fresh soup of the day for free. This is one of my favorites and well, they did not have this.  Boo Hoo.  I miss it. 

i. Steamed Pork Hash - Another one of my favorites. It was missing from the menu as well. Maybe a bit too provincial or common, but one of my all time favorites with the salted fish bits on top.

5.  GK says check this place out for some good ole Chinese American Food that many of us born in the US and our parents too, grow up eating if you are from the Cantonese areas.

I'll be back.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,2,4,poCBhLgylowljndQiZAWxA

I ordered grilled lamb chop, braised meatball in brown sauce(forgot the exact name for this dish, it's a really traditional dish back home), giant clam( they offered to make it 2 different ways, so I have it prepared as sashimi and also salt and pepper, sooooo good!) I also tried their stuffed chicken wing, they stuffed fried sticky rice with Chinese sausage in the chicken wing and it's boneless, love this dish! 
All the food that I ordered are dishes that I have never seen in other Chinese restaurants in Vegas and there are so many dishes on the menu that I wanted to try! Will definitely go back:)",3nRuqUb_crS24_oLHxswqQ,3,1,5,JhDeDBZemiCWE65U8Q41BQ
