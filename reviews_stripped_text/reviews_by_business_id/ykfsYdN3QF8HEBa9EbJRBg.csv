We were both extremely hungry from a long rockous evening on freemont. If you've ever been to freemont, you can understand the hunger pains the following morning...

Anywho, we both ordered our bagels and headed to our gate. As we sat at the gate, we noticed our bagel orders were both wrong. We had to walk all the way back to get our correct order. Not a significant deal, however the walk seemed like the long mile due to the side effects of the previous night. 

After we picked up our correct bagel order, much of the remaining time I had with my beautiful woman was gone. I was no longer hungry because I was about to say good bye to the love of my life as we were headed to different places. 

We kissed hugged and said our goodbyes. I was so sad to see her go, while holding your bagel recently made. As she disappeared into the walkway and onto her plane, I asked the attendant at the gate where my gate was (my gate wasn't posted because my flight was a few hours later). 

Lo and behold, it turns out my gate was the same exact gate that the love of my life left on. I sat there, looking out the window at the airplane my woman was on that was slowly backing up and leaving, all while holding your bagel. Turns out there was a 15 minute delay and the plane stayed in my view for an additional 15 minutes, parked on the flight line. Throughout the depths of my sadness I held your bagel until her plane pulled away from view. 

Great American Bagel you get 3 stars from me, not because you messed up my order and I had to come back to get it fixed, or that your bagel tasted bad, because it tasted decent.
