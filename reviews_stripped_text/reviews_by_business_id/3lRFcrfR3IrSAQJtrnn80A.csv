Me lo tendrían sentí mucho pero igual llegué pasado ese tiempo.
Cuando llegue la administradora se tardó como 25 min. En cobrarle a otro cliente, según por problemas con su registradora,  al fin cuándo me atendió ""ME ESTABA COBRANDO EL DOBLE DEL PRECIO""..... alegaba que tres pupusas del pedido eran más caras por ser de quezo, le dije que me las quitara, despues me dice que todo mi pedido me lo cambiarían por pupusas más pequeñas que las que ya me habían echado,  ya que la empleada era nueva y no habia podido hacer bien el pedido, las cuales tenía que esperar otros 45 minutos más, y eso si quería esperar, sino que no las llevara.....WOWWWWWW y Qué con mi tiempo? Más de 1hora  perdida, y mi hijito de 3 años con mucha hambre en ese momento, por eso NO se lo recomiendo,  por el pésimo servicio de la encargada!",mz-PEIOOEXDEcuQlxL_mgw,3,1,1,jx5AvQ1W3XWQ6TcW30gIYQ

Came in the early afternoon and there were no chicken breasts or hand napkins in the bathroom...it's the little things. But for the sake of discussing only the food I would come back and do take out. I would rather eat in the car.,KZx_n-uAllzDMaIbiZM_Ew,0,1,4,Qh-YQCVaRo0FT7m9cNxXxA

1935649,2017-12-01,0,3lRFcrfR3IrSAQJtrnn80A,"We were sorely disappointed in this place. We were excited upon reading their reviews on Google but it just didn't meet our expectations on the pupusas.  They had no flavor whatsoever. To be honest,  we couldn't tell the difference between the chicken, pork or cheese n beans. Everything just tasted the same & no, neither of us had a cold. We were happy to see plantain empanadas with fried ice cream on the dessert menu & were we ready for that! But to our dismay,  our gal who was assisting us with our order stated that they weren't serving any desserts. No apology,  no explanation....just ""yeah...we aren't serving any desserts"". That was that. Won't be back. There were more points I could make for this decision but why? It was a simple strike out.",0Bw_3MFUW01PXbjlzbTIrA,0,0,1,ObytCBsYlg86fgtYU_ZciA

Was recommended to me and had a terrible experience here. We walked in and ordered my food to go around  4:40pm and my food was not ready until 5:50pm! Took over an hour considering there was only 2 tables occupied (5guests total) where the people were eating since we got there. We were the only people in restaurant by 5:30Pm. Some customers came in and left since they were not attended. We ordered 12 popusas 1 torta and 1 order of carne asada fries. The food was very poorly prepared. The popusas taste was good but the Carne asada fries had no carne (meat), torta was plain.Considering they had over an hour with barely any clientele in restaurant they should be ashamed of their service. Do not recommend.",9hux3F2Wafx1Kq0qqYJENw,2,0,1,bA0NWWZ0hVERDVQ-8aeQYQ
2229922,2017-02-04,4,3lRFcrfR3IrSAQJtrnn80A,"A coworker brought me so I could try pupusas. The Salvadorian main entree. Its like a tortilla stiffed with a variety of options. I got to try 3 different ones. All very good. 

The pupusas were small in size but quite filling. Topped with a cabbage and hot sauce, the meal was unique and one I'd love to try again. 

Experiencinnew foods is always fun, especially when its good. 

Loved the orange soda and fruit drink. I apologize I don't know the names, my coworker ordered everything for me.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,10,6,4,sV264QD49mMFuneJHJBDwg

Well, here we are and this place has GREAT authentic Salvadoreño food. The banana leaf wrapped chicken tamales are stupendous! Also had the pupusas, cheese & chicharrón, cheese & lorocco & a mixed pupusa. OMG! All was delicious. The curtido for the pupusas was just right and the ""hot"" salsa was not that spicy but has great flavor. We will definitely eat there again, maybe try different dishes.",EwovOl9RLEVMJqbgkZ9jRA,0,0,5,xJli6wGThmlyyE_j_A6-IQ
2584522,2017-06-13,0,3lRFcrfR3IrSAQJtrnn80A,"Went here 6Pm on a Saturday night. Had always drove past this place on Rainbow so I thought we would give it a try. Ambiance is very basic: a few pictures on the wall with about 10 tables that seat a range of 2 (or 1)- 8 people per table. I am not sure if they take reservations.
One person runs the register and the other cooks. When we were there, we sat ourselves and walked up to the counter to order. 
We Ordered:
1)Horchata: $2.75- Super super sweet, much sweeter than I am used to
2)Plantaines with crèma and refried beans 6.99$ (kinda expensive for 6 plantains and some beans and crema) 
3)Papusas 1.75-2.75$ each: we had the Shrimp and Cheese and the Everything Papusa: pork, shrimp, and cheese and some other things I couldn't tell what was in there
- I would say you need about 2 papusas per person to get mildly full. 
-DEF recommend the shrimp and cheese papusas
-not overly greasy but still bland
-BEST PART WAS THE Pickled cabbage that came with it

There was about 8 other people in the restaurant and our order took about 20 min. Service was kinda slow. We had to clean/Buss our own table
- we watched Spanish soap operas while we waited

Service: It sucks, they didn't come as often. Only came to the table to deliver our food and asked for drinks. It took about 35 mins to make 5 revueltas pupusas, we should have went somewhere else. 

Food: Salsa was very spicy for my taste. Revueltas pupusas was good, it wasn't great 

All in all, I had other places that was much better than this. So disappointing.",9BrpcyKg1UDVkJQBUXIBXw,1,1,1,s-YX54CcpHaRwVVGSrcSZw

Compared to other Salvadorian spots, this place makes pupusas that are just like mom used to make (according to my Salvadorian friend).  And I concur, these pupusas are delicious!!  Prices range from $2 to $2.75 per pupusa.  3 or 4 will fill you up.  This is the only place I've ever seen that has a zucchini pupusa.  

The only negatives are the service is a little slow and they don't have pasteles.  But if you're on the hunt for just pupusas, you're at the right place.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,0,1,4,gbNRZgjXP10ygeQ3SISMRg

4491702,2016-10-11,1,3lRFcrfR3IrSAQJtrnn80A,"Absolutely disappointing! 
          I've ordered here before and always tent to order 12 or more popusas to go at a great price. Today I decided to make an order and the front desk notifies me that the 99. cent special, order of 12 or more is only applicable for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday only. 
Not to happy :( because it doesn't have that written down on the online specials section. Plus I've ordered before with the same price. I advised the lady that the information she's giving me is not very accurate because it's nowhere on the menu or online. Perhaps they didn't want to give me the special pricing? That's an issue! :(

This place is really unprofessional and would've liked to see them caring about providing exceptional customer service. The lady could've easily honored the special. It is not my fault they are not advertising correctly and properly. But she refused to be helpful.

I will most definitely be taking my popusa cravings elsewhere ;) 

Note: I've tried the popusa tomato sauce on my last visit and it had a plastique after taste perhaps they are cooling the sauce in a plastic container? Not sure but I was going to ask but forgot about it after the whole ordeal.",JXVDGeVS_av8BCrzyNGNPg,2,1,1,sy_7wQw-l5VuAkdyECeMYw

- no gracias, no vine a que me regale nada.
Cuando pido mi cheque me dice que fueron 9 pupusas y que me quito dos ..
Cuando sólo fueron 7 y me debía quitar 2.. para sólo 5 en total y de nuevo empezó a subir el tono de la voz y me dijo que no volviera a ese lugar y prácticamente me sacó del lugar..
Si es la dueña no creo que el negocio le dure mucho y se lo dejé saber por que ella de servicio al cliente lamentablemente no tiene idea alguna.
