227108,2013-05-12,0,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"Totally surprised at this place tucked in a corner at Arizona Charlie's! Elegantly decorated and charming staff... our waiter, Joey made sure we were comfortable and did a fantastic job. We all had the prix fixe menu for $34.99 which came with salad or soup, choice of 3 entrees, glass of wine, side and dessert. They delivered a warm basket of bread with 3 delicious butters... plain, garlic and cinnamon. Wine was nice choice of Merlot or Zin. Sou p was light and tasty and salad was interestingly displayed... thin sliced strips of cucumber wrapped around the greens as a bowl and was quite pretty. 3 out of 4 of us has the 8 ounce fillet which was grilled perfectly. I had the chicken Oscar and was not disappointed (chicken with shredded crab on a bed of Bordeaux and Bearnaise sauce). 
Joey even asked us if we had a Arizona Charlie's players card as they offered a 10% discount to members. He went and picked one up for us at the members desk. We passed along our savings to him as he did such a great job!",to-2EIRXGkhV3dWcwnllig,4,0,4,XOE31rNeshHCXJJIBqqDQA
447179,2012-02-15,0,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"Honestly speaking, Ron's was kind of a last resort for Valentine's Day dinner. I was originally planning on taking my wife to Fleming's or Morton's, but the reservation times were way too late, so I had to think of something quick! Then I remembered that AZ Charlie's had recently opened a steakhouse, so i tried to make an online reservation and to my surprise, there were seatings available for 7pm. We arrived and were promptly seated by a very nice hostess. I wasn't particularly crazy about being seated against the wall, but at that moment there were no free tables in the open area of the restaurant, so I didn't let it get to me. The ambience was intimate and calming, with dim lighting and music faintly playing in the background. The room had more of an ""old school Vegas"" feel to it, when things were more laid back. Our waiter, Monty, was a class act and provided outstanding service the entire meal...an extra shout out goes to our drink server Andy, who NEVER let our water glasses become empty! Now for the food: First, they get big kudos for having an awesome bread basket that comes with 3 different butters.  Our favorite was definitely the raisin bread with cinnamon butter...yummy!!  My wife ordered the New York Strip and I ordered the Ribeye, both cooked medium rare. The steaks are ordered ala carte, but they did come with our choice of soup or salad. My wife had the soup, which was sun-dried tomato bisque, and it was absolutely delicious. I tried the salad and it was a nice plate of spring greens with a tasty blue cheese dressing, nothing extravagant, but sufficient enough. We tried the sausage stuffed mushroom appetizer and it was nice. I would best describe its taste as ""doughless pizza."" After about 20 minutes or so, our steaks arrived. Sides can be ordered for only $5 each so we tried the au gratin potatoes, creamed spinach, and the risotto style orzo pasta. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection and tasted absolutely delicious! As for the sides, the orzo pasta was the star of the show, with a rich, cheesy-like flavor. The creamed spinach and au gratins were good too, but not outstanding. My only knock was that I was really looking forward to trying the tableside bananas foster, but they were not offering tableside service that night. Also, we tried the creme brûlée and found it to be a bit runny and it had somewhat if a bitter aftertaste. Overall, I will be back to try the Porterhouse and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative to the higher end steakhouses in town!",gTQ9Vwp0FGXDQVX9Opo-7g,4,1,4,rx0fLd-ycZ7ItE39_LlpBw

YUM!  Sides of asparagus and potatoes au gratin.  I would probably pass on the potatoes next time.  Not bad, just not great.  Too cheesy.  Brought a huge dish of vanilla ice cream with a lit candle out while singing Happy Birthday.  Great service and food.  We WILL GO BACK.  Also won $300.  Great evening.

The staff wasn't very friendly, our waiter was very short n rude, almost like on autopilot, and when he checked back (once) to see how our meal was and saw my wife wasn't eating her food.. asked why. The prime rib was off in color, extremely overcooked, and just looked gross. After expressing this he insisted to offer a replacement. He took it back to the kitchen and returned with the SAME piece of meat.. All they did was re-dip it, and seared the edge where her previous two bites were. Absolutely the same piece of meat. How awful. To be honest it wasn't worth it even with the $50 off, and we left a side tip for the bread guy (who was also the busser) as he was very inviting, friendly, casual, fun, and got us extra bread with our to-go boxes. All while we never saw our waiter again.

The waitress was friendly and we didn't have to wait. I ordered steak and my husband ordered prime rib. We got some mashed potatoes to share. The waitress put bread on the table which was nice. It had 3 types of bread, regular, a raisin and a crunchy tortilla like bread which came with 3 types of butter. It was very yummy. We both chose soup and it was potato leek. It was amazing. So tasty we both ate all of it. After that though I'm sorry to say the food was very plain. The presentation was nice. The food came out looking amazing. However my filet minion was ordered medium and was rare. It also was completely tasteless. Like a piece of steak you expect to get at a low class diner. The mashed potatoes tasted like ones from a package. My husbands prime rib was over cooked but he said it was ok tasting. I ordered chocolate cake for dessert. It looked awesome but tasted like the kind you get from a box in the freezer section of the grocery store. All in all for the price we paid I wouldn't return.

1559505,2014-11-23,1,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"Somehow I never noticed this steakhouse inside Arizona Charlies, despite countless visits. A recommendation from Dana S put this place on my radar, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food, ambiance, and service. $26/person cardholder special is a great value: appetizer, salad or soup, plus entrée.

Nicely appointed upscale décor and matching quality of service. Tables are immediately served a bread basket with three gourmet butter spreads- the basil version is to die for. Could eat the whole basket and call it a night.

ESCARGOT: seven-piece app portion is generous, save some of your bread for this to mop up the excess oil and herb sauce.
STUFFED MUSHROOMS: sausage plus mushroom covered in cheese served on a puddle of marinara, even better than it sounds.
HOUSE SALAD: artfully plated, fresh produce, no downside to this starter salad
CHICKEN FLORENTINE SOUP: special du jour, packed with meat, generous portion
RIBEYE: Generous portion, but not the best I've had in town, not particularly flavorful. Horseradish sauce is super spicy, exercise caution.
FARMED TROUT: not seared properly, wish the skin was crisped. Generous portion, choice of preparation with lemon butter sauce with capers or lemon-pepper, served with asparagus spears.
CREAMY CHEESE GNOCCHI: disliked this, way too rich. Had a few bites, did not finish the portion or take with us. Flavor was not balanced. Staff did not ask why it was uneaten, was not removed from bill. Found this odd but sides are a cheap $4/ea with the combo deal.

Quality of most items was good, service was on point- rarely took more than two sips of my drink before it was refilled in a haste. All dishes brought out on a cart, nice old-school touch. Will be returning here, great value.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,3,3,Y7bGVmGAXOH9moR1O435qg

2667896,2011-08-08,0,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"In many ways, Ron's is a throwback to an older way of doing things in Las Vegas. Plopped inside the Arizona Charlie's Decatur, it is a replacement for the previous steakhouse run by the casino, which was quite good but little trafficked and itself a throwback to the era of small casinos with only a 24 hr cafe and a nice steak place for the whales. A few years back, AC replaced that steakhouse with an Outback chain, perhaps thinking it was a little more 'to their market' and now they've reversed course. 

The other notable thing about Ron's is that it is named for (and run by?) Ron Lurie, a former Mayor of Las Vegas who now serves as AC's VP. So it will come as no surprise going in that it is more or less a modern version of the Olde Vegas Steakhouse experience. Classic dishes, big slab of meat for cheap, prepared well, with minute sides. 

Clientele-wise, the room is done in cement walls painted in the current dark brown scheme. It was busy with middle class patrons dressed for a nice night off-strip. (Business casual, I guess.) The table is bare marble slab style, no crumb cleaning off the linen.

I went with my parents and teenaged brother during a 2-for-1 special that my dad heard about on KJWL. My parents had the prime rib. Teenaged brother had chicken marsala and I went with the New York Strip Steak. It was twenty four dollars, classically prepared - which means medium rare was more rare than medium. My mom ordered her prime rib well done, and it was, so from one experience they do pay attention to the scale. 

A dollop of garlic mashed and a selection of sautéed onions and mushrooms came with it. Soup or salad come with this special but the Soup of the Day choices are limited and the waiter looked a bit askance that I would ask for balsamic instead of a cream-based dressing. (He did, however, make it happen for me. So, no marks off.) The salad was mixed greens and red-and-gold tomatoes, basic again except for the presentation inside a bowl made out of cucumber. 

Cheap but nice, basic food presented well. It won't impress anyone used to eating at one of the upscale Strip houses, like Cut or Prime, but is a nice local alternative to say, Flemings or Ruth Chris.",BemKKkZBBmu9GupEwKBj9g,3,2,4,Rz93dO5uBZKX8ZV31xd36A

 The service has always been impeccable, by all of my servers; but I will always request JP he is the best!!

I can appreciate there new appetizer menu...it has more variety than it once did, and I am a big fan of the rib eye steak as well as the caesar salad prepared at your table. I would say a wider dessert menu would be great, but honestly I am so full I won't eat it anyway.

Lastly, for all of those who complain about the ""smokey smells"" inside Arizona Charlies, stay the hell home.  This is Las Vegas!

Drinks came quickly and the pour was generous for a fair price.  The bread basket was nice and fresh, and came with three kinds of soft butter.

Most of the food was quite good.  I started with stuffed mushrooms, which tasted a bit unusual; I don't know that I would order them again.  My wife's crab cakes, though, were very good.  I then moved on to the Lobster Bisque, which the menu advertises as rich and creamy, and they're not lying.  Yum.  My wife liked her Caesar Salad as well.  Then I had the rib eye steak, which was excellent.  Flavorful, well-cooked, and good marbling.  Sides of gnocchi and asparagus (roasted, and unusually crisp) were not only good, but downright cheap at $5 each.  Being 22 oz., the rib eye was good for a second dinner the next night.  That makes it quite a buy at $30.  My wife had the Scampi with Angel Hair Pasta, and she loved every bite.

All in all, Ron's served up a very good dinner at a very bargain price.  That makes it, in the words of Yelp, ""as good as it gets.""",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,4,0,5,6MDlbXYcV9Yku4VXL1g4BQ

Although I have fond childhood memories of Arizona Charlie's when I was a kid, those days are looooooong gone.  Now, it reeks of cigarettes and Depends...and I cringe every time mom asks me to meet her there.  So you can understand how I cracked my jaw on the floor when I walked into this spot.  

The scene opens:  Dark, sultry chocolate walls, and red über modern decor. Dim romantic lighting.  Enter surprised patron stage left.  

Unlike the ambiance, however, the staff are still old school Vegas servers - it is AZ Charlie's.  I personally like that.  Polite, unpretentious and relaxed service made this entire meal perfect.  Karen was our waitress and she was great. 

Food:    First up, a trio of breads (one sweet like raisin nut, one with a parmesan crust, etc) and a complementary trio of butters (sweet cream, garlic herb, cinnamon something-or-other).... Delicious!

Their salad was presented very artistically, wrapped in a long luscious wafer-thin cucumber slice, and their house dressing was OMFG delicious!

Lobster bisque was OK... Too salty, but huge chunks of lobster.  Mmmmm.

Filet mignon Oscar was perfect.  Simply perfect.   They use some kind of savory rub that was even beyond what I expected. As others have said...the risotto side is tasty.

Deserts were the standards...creme brûlée, etc.  nothing spectacular.

So add all this up and you get a solid steakhouse experience, at muuuuuch less than you'd pay on the strip.   (most entrees were under $30). 

A hidden gem, and a straight up shocker for AZ Charlie's.  Holy moly.  I'll be back.",IQTzpSyZphASEnQS2I0Ckw,7,1,5,xJa8G4PHoYMgxgk-Iw__5w

- Meal started with a bread basket and compound butters. The one with honey was my favorite. I enjoyed the sourdough and the raisin bread with the honey butter. The lavash bread was lovely with the garlic & herb butter.
- Stuffed mushrooms came nice and hot. I loved the pickled mushrooms blended with the tomato sauce for some reason. The flavors meshed pretty nicely.
- Cream of mushroom tasted very buttery. It was very thick so it felt like I was eating from a bowl of gravy. 
- Prime rib was tender and very flavorful with the au jus so it wasn't at all necessary to eat it with the horshradish cream. The horshradish cream had a bold kick to it - I can't imagine anyone finishing the whole serving. The mashed potato mound was dried out - it actually formed a crust all over it.

I had high hopes after reading reviews and the bus boy did not disappoint. I will preface this with the fact that I eat prime rib occasionally. We both ordered the prime rib (medium). My salad had wilted leaves and brown edges, it looked like a bagged salad from Smiths. The soup my mom had, Italian wedding, looked more promising and she was quite content. The issue came when we asked the waiter for a new spoon and he brought back the exact the same spoon complete with the same stain on it. We gave up on this waiter after that and my mom disappointingly washed her own spoon in the tap water provided. The prime rib was actually cooked to med and served with flavorful mash, horseradish and au jus. We loved the prime rib but as I was told it is hard to mess up prime rib. We left without the waiter ever asking how our meal was and being very brusque with us at every interaction. The bus boy on the other hand had the whole section to mind and he still was on top of the refills, service and regular bus boy duties. Even mother was impressed that he cleaned the seats, stating that most people miss the seats. Overall I would recommend the bus boy and the free warm bread with fun butters.

Ron's is a surprisingly nice, subdued place in a tacky old smoke-filled casino. It's quiet and pleasant inside, and the bread basket you are greeted with is pretty yummy.

Our waiter was also a pleasant enough fellow, but I'm afraid they need to stick to serving and get a specialist to prepare the tableside caesar salad, because OMG! They actually list the ingredients on the menu, with romaine lettuce being the main one, but I'm afraid that's deceptive: it's actually garlic. Like enough to peel a layer of skin from the inside of your mouth. Holy Sh#t! And not only that, he decided that since most people don't like anchovies, it was better not to mash them into a paste and emulsify them with the dressing, but to drape their little carcasses across the salad instead. That would have been fine, assuming they were the smoky, chewy, delicious kind of anchovies, but these were wet and slimy and unfit for consumption unless incorporated into another entity. No problem. It wasn't exactly possible to taste them anyway with your tastebuds and mouth lining burnt away from the garlic.

As for the rest, the Anaconda really like the stuffed mushrooms. I thought the sauce was a little too spicy but that made him happy since he didn't have to share. 
The prime rib was juicy and rare like I like it.  Sides of orzo risotto and au gratin potatoes were both enjoyable.  A positive experience after we recovered from the salad. Well, I still haven't recovered from the salad.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,2,3,wbr8wRcONTJnELUATIiy6w

Shrimp cocktail, French onion soup, Italian wedding soup (which was Thursday night special), beautifully served house salad and even bread basket were absolutely delicious.

They even accommodated us with a table at the end of the dining room so our 2 year old can walk around and doesn't bother other patrons.

3810775,2013-08-05,4,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"Seriously, who would've thunk?

I went to Arizona Charlie's for a friend's birthday dinner.  I was a little bit surprised for the choice of venue.  A buffet for dinner, I thought, but why Arizona Charlie's?   Parking was ample right next and across the establishment, and I walked into the casino floor.  The place looks like a local hang out considering it's distance from the touristy strip.  Sure enough they have a buffet restaurant but I was led to Ron's Steakhouse, and boy, was I in for pleasant surprise! 

The place was very cozy and void of the cigarette smokes.  You would not think that the restaurant was inside Arizona Charlie's.   It was 5 pm and there were few tables already filled in and we were immediately sat on our table.  Our waiter, Nestor, greeted us with his genuine smile and asked for our drinks.  He came back with our drinks and baskets full of 3 different warm breads and 3 different compound butters.  Am impressed, and found no flaws or complaints so far :).

We ended up ordering their 24oz rib eye steaks, shrimp cocktails, fried calamari, shrimp scampi over pasta and salmon steaks.  We finished up our dinners with orders of their Crème brûlées flambeed right in front of us.  Aside from their shrimp scampis being served on angel hair instead of linguine and one of the diners sorta found the alcohol on her brulee a bit strong, we were all satisfied and me, couldn't believe I had such a wonderful dinner in a place I least expected.

3967594,2017-05-02,4,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"I first heard of this place when Arizona Charlie's changed the steakhouse from what it was to Ron's.  And, it hasn't been on the radar since I never go to Arizona Charlie's.  Yesterday, that changed when I was unable to meet a friend for a show on the Strip in time for the start of the show.  I started home from the Smith Center trying to think of a place to have dinner when Ron's popped into my head.

I found a space on the surface lot on the north side of the casino and walked in the side door.  I was totally lost.  It's probably been 12 years since I was here.  One thing never changes--there was the smell of cigarette smoke everywhere.  I walked a short distance trying to get my bearings and when I looked to my right, there was Ron's.  A quick dash and I was inside their door and the casino noise and cigarette smoke was behind me.

The woman at the podium seated me immediately and I was told my server would be Maria.  That was the win of the night--she is fantastic!

After looking at the menu, I opted to go à la carte skipping a few 3 course meals on the menu.  For a starter, I got escargot.  The main meal was a 14 oz. NY strip steak that comes with soup or salad.  I opted for the salad.  I asked about the size of the sides and Maria explained that the fries were large portions.  When I asked about the au gratin potatoes, she said they were a more modest serving.  I ended the meal with chocolate cake.

My iced tea was brought immediately and it was refilled twice without needing to ask.  Used sweetener packs were removed from the table.  The bread service consisted of two pieces of lavash and some slices of Bon Breads raisin walnut.  There were three cups of butter served--one a garlic herb, one a cinnamon sugar, and one regular.  I wasn't a fan of the cinnamon but I can see why people would like it with the raisin bread.  I was not impressed with the lavash.  It was old and lacked the cheese flavor it was supposed to have.

The escargot was good.  Each was topped with a round of puff pastry.  The pastry puffs were somewhat hard.  The thing to do here is move the puffs aside, eat the escargot, and then push the pastry into the ample garlic butter and let it soak up that goodness.  They did not spare the garlic at all.

The salad was small and was made with a slice or two of thin cucumber acting as the ""bowl"" with greens inside and the bleu cheese dressing on the side.  Nice concept.

The steak was good albeit a bit tough.  It's not listed on the menu as any class of prime or and other USDA designation.  I was cooked the way I wanted it and the seasoning on it was good.  The au gratin potatoes were excellent and the serving size was perfect for a solo diner.  The prices for the sides were less than many steakhouses in the city.

To finish this meal, I opted for the chocolate cake with fresh berries.  It was a good choice.

I'm not sure if I'd come back to Ron's but if I did I think I would consider one of the 3 course, prix fixe meals.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,7,3,-80AWlMyCzj56L5XAuyFOA

Then to my son who ordered his steak med it came back well done. Asked for another and they were glad to do this but it came back raw. It seems like they knew it was raw on purpose?
My son could not eat this. He ended up not eating his entrée. They did credit his meal.

This steak house attempts to provide fine dining in a second rate hotel/casino and it almost achieves that goal.  Our waitress (Kelly? sorry don't quite remember) gets an absolute ""A"" for effort, she was great.  The apps (escargot, shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail, shrimp scampi, oysters, lobster bisque and house salads) were all excellent.  The Caesar salad made table side was hit & miss.  Initially it was tasty, then we hit a few clumps of very salty anchovies, not sure how to fix that.  The steaks were cooked to order and the lobster tail was quite large.  One steak was a bit dry and the trout was overly peppery.  Ron's falls just short of a 5 star strip steakhouse for the little things; the bar drinks were amateurish, there was no selection of beer other than domestic, and limited selection of salad dressing.

5011463,2015-12-17,1,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"Meh truly sums it up.

High point was the excellent bread basket. Cream of mushroom soup was decent. Stuffed mushrooms were odd (topped with what seemed to be squares of packaged, pre-sliced mozzarella) but acceptable. Chicken piccata's lemon-caper sauce had a scarily gelatinous consistency--not unlike that of bad lemon chicken at a low-end Chinese restaurant. And, finally, the true low point: Caesar salad prepared tableside. What is the point of preparing the salad tableside if, when the customer states her preference for light dressing, the server snottily declares that there's only one way to dress the salad? And, when the customer clarifies that she doesn't like her lettuce swimming in dressing, the server states emphatically, ""We don't do that""? In the end, the Caesar was drenched in dressing, so that even if the romaine had been fresh and good, the salad was, for my purposes, ruined. The only upside of the overly dressed salad was that the pre-cut, obviously bagged romaine didn't seem worth eating in the first place.

Beyond the food, the service was fairly attentive, but that attention was overshadowed by the fact that the server seemed to be sneering under his saccharine veneer. I would have liked to have pointed out to him that if you can't, when asked, keep from drowning the Caesar, you have no right to cop an attitude over someone's ordering ketchup with his steak. (The last sentence should NOT be confused with a defense of my husband's use of ketchup on steak.)

Finally, the atmosphere was quiet and somewhat austere (attractive but bare table tops, for example), with overly bright lighting, as if incandescent bulbs had been replaced with LED bulbs of the same wattage.",nEABfoTu6n6qvLRD2_mX1w,0,0,2,CK42UKvXtlzN4c8QfRypnQ
5237545,2013-06-15,1,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"As a local couple in Las Vegas we like to try different upscale restaurants throughout the city.  My husband is a serious ""foodie"", a great cook and I am one of the pickiest eaters anyone would ever meet.  We tried the steak house at Arizona Charlies on Decatur last night and have to say I was very disappointed.  It started off good but went down hill fast.  First we were seated in the back, by the kitchen even though the entire restaurant was empty except maybe five tables.  We overlooked that.  We were attended to quickly by a very nice and informative waiter who gave very good advice on what to order and drink.  The Chef salad he prepared in front of us was amazing and for me to say that since I generally don't eat Chef salad is definetely saying something.  He recommended an amazing red wine and great steak for my husband and the sword fish for me as well as a drink.  The food was good but the sauce over the swordfish reminded me of the sauce in chicken pot pies so I scraped it off.  At this point we had decided he was going to be tipped VERY well but then.....we looked at our completed plates for 20 minutes with not one bus boy to clear the table and no attention by the waiter even though he walked by us at least ten times and kissed the butts of the patrons seated in the next booth.  By the context of their conversation they ate there weekly and were well known.  They consumed all of his attention which I am assuming because they are weekly clients and great tippers.  What he doesn't know is that when we find a local restaurant we are also great tippers and will visit often and refer people. We eventually asked the bus boy for our check and at that point he took some of the plates from our table.   So what could have been one of our new local steak houses will not be visited by us again which is too bad because the food was good.

We all ordered the same thing the prime rib Ron's cut well done with a baked potato. None of them were well done they were red and bloody these were the fattiest pieces of prime rib I have ever seen, I filled my bread plate with fat. I could only eat half of my baked potato because it was also undercooked. I will never return for a meal over $100 and nothing was cooked right then the service the bus boy was great but our waiter sucked and was too interested in helping a party that came after us.",iYjl5n2WecRBJWSyTx6Jwg,1,0,1,oEbGyeIiG7lwtSQ2E-0fJQ
5596640,2016-01-27,0,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,Arizona Charlie's is an off-the Strip niche hotel that just happens to house a fabulous steakhouse that goes by the name 'Ron's.' Service was excellent (Todd) and the food magnificent. Reasonable menu pricing too. Ron's beats the hell out of many of its fine-dining competitors on or off strip. I can honestly highly recommend Ron's to you. We will be back soon.,8z_EK_OYXGOR4cd5qiEBHw,1,0,5,06Jr2I_oy0iAZCRtSi7NsQ
5653752,2017-03-16,1,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"I was with a large party this last Friday night to celebrate a close friends retirement. She chose this restaurant for her family/friends party. I had never even heard of this place but I am not a frequent visitor of Arizona Charlies. 

I arrived just as we were being seated in this small, cozy room. The decor was pretty and I loved the fact that the smoke from the casino did not follow me inside. The space is not large, but looks so much like a high priced steakhouse with much better prices. We were offered drinks and I perused the wine list. It was not overly impressive, but I found a tasty cabernet at a very reasonable price so I ordered a glass. I got excited as I noticed that they had a shrimp cocktail appetizer featured. I have been craving an old fashioned shrimp cocktail served in the sundae glass with lots of ice, and the prawns hanging over like the old days when I used to eat out with my parents. I was convinced they would have it.....no dice! The presentation was elegant and came with a shot of clamato juice. The shrimp was tasty and so was the sauce but I was disappointed. I guess I will have to wander into the downtown area to search for my classic shrimp cocktail.I proceeded to order the petite filet mignon with a side of Idaho baked potato and shared a plate of asparagus with a friend. In addition, you have a choice with your entree of soup or salad. I heard the clam chowder as really amazing but I am a salad lover (must be the rabbit in me)...The presentation of the salad was truly artistic as you can see in some of the other featured pictures. The steak was cooked just right and the potato was hot and smothered in butter/sour cream and chives. The asparagus left a little to be desired as they were too large and I like my asparagus stalks thin. They are so much juicier when thin. These are hard to come by and I don't see them too often unless we are in asparagus season. I cannot complain about the service as it was terrific, never had to ask for anything as our servers were right there. The hostess was very sweet and I discovered that my retiring friend is a regular here so we were all treated like royalty. This place was definitely worth checking out and I am glad I did!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,5,1,3,qwRNDeO2gF3Zpm7Rmbs8Lw

We also tried the steak fries and just couldnt stop eating them!

5848554,2017-12-11,0,Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,"Granted Arizona Charlie's is a local's dive as far as casinos go, but it typically has a higher payout than most casinos. Considering the casino, I shouldn't expect much from its ""steakhouse"". Based on the medium range price of the menu items, I thought maybe it was a hidden gem. It is not. 

I had the Porterhouse Pork Chop on the prix fixe menu. The potato soup was ok, very gravy-like and less soup like.I had a 6pm reservation, so it's not like it was the end of the day.  Had to ask for the bread basket that was evident on other tables. I wanted to take my leftover soup home and when the server brought the container back, the outside had globbers of soup all over it. No attempt to wipe off the ""dribbles"". 

The meaty 1-1/2 inch chop was under-cooked and tough. The demi glace on the top tasted like powdered gravy mix. Temperature of all the hot food was tepid. 

Service was slow and careless.They weren't that busy and the place isn't all that big. The scant communication I had with the waiter was as he was walking passed the table.  By the time I could catch his attention about the chop, I'd been waiting 30 minutes. At that point I no longer wanted to wait for the food to be remade. I ordered the desert and coffee, which were both marginal. After I'd pushed everything the to opposite side of the table and placed my credit card on the table, it took another 30 minutes to get the check and I had to ask for it too.

Don't let the crazy people in and around the Casino scare you. This is a great place to escape the heat, the hustle and bustle of the strip and better yet most of the people in the casino couldnt afford the restaurant so its quaint and yet classy sit down experience you dont want to miss.

We both had a 3 course steak dinner of perfectly cooked Fillets, house salads that came wrapped in tasty cucumber bowls and for desert it was cheesecake.

The server was an Expat from France and very knowledgeable about all the dishes. He was even very entertaining as he made jokes about himself and his not being from America. It was very personal and engaging and all the staff made you feel at home. (So much so an elderly lady had a personal cell phone conversation in the booth next to us like she was sitting in her own living room. I hope whomever she was talking to gets her meds figures out, the laundry folded and the pets fed) 

If you are in the mood for a great steak dinner at a great price that will impress just about anyone; GIVE THEM A TRY!",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,9,3,5,SKFIVTjF0f-8bV9Huh9taw
