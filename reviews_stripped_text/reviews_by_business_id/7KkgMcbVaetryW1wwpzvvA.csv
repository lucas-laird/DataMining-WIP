Cafe rio is much less healthy than chipotle and since I am allergic to gluten, there is almost nothing gluten free on the menu. Even the rice and beans have gluten in them! There is no reason for there to be gluten in rice or beans. I guess they put a lot of extra stuff in their food.",63F5L7SqmFSWwc_zU45x0A,2,0,2,MMLyUKnoD-bza8UBOjMcnA

I stood in line for about 5 minutes before I even got to order my food.

Service was mediocre at best. I constantly let the young lady helping me know that it was my first time at cafe rio, she seemed more agitated then excited to have a new customer. She really was no help at all. I asked for sour cream cheese and pico on my burrito, she said I could only have cheese because they have to put it in the oven. I explained to her I didn't want it in the oven, she basically said there was no choice. I told her just to make me something since I obviously don't understand how to order and I can't have what I'm telling you I want. Instead of offering me assistance she looked relieved and just made something. 

Not very good, tasted microwaved honestly. Kinda sad. 

Basically my experience and the food were undesirable and I won't be back. $20 for a burrito with chips and guacamole and a drink.

594959,2015-03-16,0,7KkgMcbVaetryW1wwpzvvA,"First time eating there. There were over 10 employees behind the counter and no one had any direction. there were only about 6 customers in the dining area and they were already eating. We were the only ones in line and they were rushing taking our order.

I stated that it was our first time here so we didn't know how things went for the order here. They still didn't be patient with us or change up the un needed speed and sloppiness. Didn't even ask if I wanted corn or flour tortillas for my tacos. after making my food the girl had to redo my order bc I wanted corn tortillas.

Upon check out the guy didn't even say ""thank you, have a great day"" just rushed through with my transaction with a confused look on his face as if I was a burden to him or something.

WORST fast food experience in a very long time..

I've experienced better customer service from A young boy at a Mc Donalds drive through by himself (literally taking, making, and ringing the orders) and a long line of cars were behind me and in front of me. he still was organized and had time to thank us and tell us to have a great day with a smile on his face.

728141,2011-07-08,0,7KkgMcbVaetryW1wwpzvvA,"A cut above other fast Mexican concepts, Cafe Rio is always a favorite place of mine to eat at.

When you enter the line the first thing you will see are the fresh tortillas being made by hand.  While 3-4 will be spinning on the wheel getting delicious, the rest will be in some form from dough mixing in a blender to partitioned lumps being prepared for the heat.  The end result is always fantastic.

The pork barbacoa is the signature meat here and its a favorite with most I know who eat here regularly.  It has a very unique sweetness to it that goes well in any form you choose to have it, be it a salad, burrito or even nachos.  You really can't go wrong with the other choices but the pork barbacoa offers the most memorable experience.

They have mild, medium and hot sauces here for your dish.  The mild is basically salsa verde and as a tomatillo fan its something I opted for often.  The medium is an oddly sweet but warm sauce, and the hot is your typical red.  

If you like a side dish, the chips and queso is also very good.  The queso is given in a very nice quantity along with a metric ton of fresh chips that aren't too salty.  Holds up well if you get it to go as the cheese will still be very hot when you get it to your table.

If you opt to order extra meat the entire staff will yell out ""Exxxxxxtra Meat!!"" which can be fun.

My favorite meal from here would be the fire grilled steak burrito, enchilada style with extra meat. with chips and queso on the side.  Mild sauce for a tomatillo day, hot sauce for a flavor enhancer mood.  

They also offer a loyalty punch card program, so if you frequent it you will get free meals periodically which is a plus.",si2HgoQo_SiTl3Ek4JGPpQ,0,0,5,tKvTkXFQuFUM4zgswO8qxg

Darn, I like the food at Cafe Rio.  Big servings, wonderful flavor, quality ingredients.  And the freshly made tortillas are beyond compare.  It's just wonderful.  If I were to rate the place purely on the food, it would be 5 stars.

Unfortunately, I've got to knock off a star for other factors.  First, even though I said big servings were a positive, they're also a negative.  I have no idea how single people eat here.  The wife and I always split a meal because there's no way we could each eat one of anything not on the child's menu.  Yet, we see bajillions of these young, thin women in there with meals bigger than their heads.  I have no idea how they do it.  The second negative is that the prices are high.  Yes, big servings of excellent food made with quality ingredients will cost.  But, this is a place where you stand in a long line to order your food and eat it from an aluminum bowl/plate with plastic utensils.  Because we always split a single entree, the prices are fine for us.  But, again, for lone individuals, I think it's a lot of money (but, then, I'm old).  Then, there's the environment:  the place is usually jammed with people and it's unbelievably loud.  It's just an uncomfortable place.

So, wonderful food with a few other factors that knock it down by a star.  Still, a very good place to eat.",IgFS6DZRcePxecF17YA3Qg,0,0,4,5-nBAZ0MzPOgQ94Dx6rAeA

I also have to add that I am very glad to have this location in our area of town as it's worth the few extra minutes out of my way if it means avoiding the customer service abuse from the N. Decatur/215 location.

Last week was my most recent visit. I was completely wow'd. So I'm making my way home and decide I don't feel like cooking so I call up this location and place a phone order with 3 meals. Two problems though...

I just picked up my furchild from Camp Bow Wow, and it's sweltering hot outside. How am I going to go inside and pick up this food? Surely I am not aloud to bring her inside with me and surely I would never leave her in the car under the weather conditions. I sat in the parking lot contemplating  should I take her home and come all the way back or do I see if I can seek out a good citizen to watch my pup for a few min while I run inside and pay? NO! I can't do any of those things, am I crazy? No I'm not, just hungry. 

While sitting in the parking lot with my pup, I place a call to the restaurant. A super nice girl answers the phone, and I really wish I remembered her name so I could
Shout her out! I explained my situation and ask if there is any way they can bring my food to the car? She said YES without hesitation. She even acknowledged my pup and said hello to her when she came out to the car. 

So to end this long story I was super stoked that this location just continues to be so awesome and provided above and beyond service to me and my pup. PLUS...my order was RIGHT!!! SCORE!

Add on from a previous visit on different date: I order all our food, get to the counter to pay, and realize my wallet is missing. It's dinner time rush. So embarrassed and with people waiting behind me, I ask the cashier if there  is anyway I can call my bf and get his cc # to pay over the phone. She says sure no problem (I think she could see my embarrassment and worried look). How awesome was that? They totally could have turned me away.

Cafe Rio is all over Utah (which is pretty full of Mormons and Polygamists [they ARE NOT the same thing, people! Trust me; I have but one mom]).

If the score was based on food alone, Cafe Rio would slide by with five stars. Unfortunately my scores are based on service, price, and cleanliness too. Las Vegas, we have a problem.

Sure I'd rather eat at Cafe Rio than Baja Fresh, On The Border, and Lindo Michoacan (pardon spelling if wrong, I don't care enough to look up that over-priced mess-taurant's name up). But the problem is that the staff (including the cooks) are rude and the place is dirty. I remember several months ago when I had to drive by the place everyday there were stacks of boxes and garbage in the back. I've worked in restaurants for years and we always broke down the boxes. There is a specific bad experience that one of my family members had at this location with some of the cooks. None of your business.

If all you care about is good Mexican food, go to Cafe Rio. But heed my warning that you might be paying a lot of money to fill your stomach if you are anything like me.

Girl slammed down the food and even the guy behind me commented on it. Then I ordered the special and the girl said it would be 5 mins. I said I would wait then she sighed and said more like 10 mins co said fine I'll wait then she said 15. I was in disbelief. Then when I said never mind she rolled her eyes and walked away. At the pay counter my wife asked for the beans and soda that come with the paid kids meal and she just stared at us. Finally she slammed the chips on the land and the beans.

I've had great customer service until today. I love cafe rio food it's amazing, but unfortunately customer service can tarnish the experience. The restaurant closes at 10 and we got there at 9, The moment we walked in this young lady greeted us nicely. However, the moment she asked me what I'd like to eat I responded ""a burrito please"" .... she then replies with a ""excuse me?"" In a tone I did not feel comfortable with. I assumed she really didn't hear me so we continued with my order and then my girlfriend tries to ask for a sample of the chile roast beef. At this time I could tell she wasn't used to getting asked for samples. She says no word as she roles her eyes heavily and sighs as she moves her hand slowly to the sample cups. .... my girlfriend and I became uncomfortable but again didn't want this body language of hers to phase us. So as she continues with the order the lady asks if my girlfriend would like rice and beans, my girlfriend responds ""yes please on the side!"" ... at this moment i became to understand that the worker then not only rolled her eyes... but sighed heavily and started
Murmuring under her breath as if she were cursing us out.... I immediately felt uncomfortable, and very displeased. 

I could understand if we were giving her a hard time on specific orders , but we've ordered here plenty of times before. I could understand if we were the last minute customers but we got there an hour before the restaurant closes and there ended up being 4 customers behind us. I could understand if the worker had to place the order first then prepare the meal like most restaurants, but all of the food at Cafe pre-prepped, it literally takes less than a minute to prepare the food. So maybe she had a bad day, or maybe she was thinking of something else. However, while working in a restaurant where customer service is crucial, regardless of what's happening in your day... you shouldn't take it out on your customers... having that type of attitude is completely unnecessary, especially if we are literally right in front of you.",o3qEwKrPMjfTXaOo-MAefQ,1,0,2,LZt1GP5KZbpg4ofKMmqSkQ

3943290,2010-10-08,0,7KkgMcbVaetryW1wwpzvvA,"My wife and I used to live near the cafe rio located near where Eastern met the 215 and it was always awesome food. Now we live in a new place and luckily we found that it is fairly close to yet another cafe rio! Yay! It is real strange though seeing it located in such an empty shopping center... it is such a stark contrast to the other location which can be an insane mind numbing experience when it comes to finding parking. Not surprising though considering it is such a small lot with some really awesome food spots... *ahem* Nelson's Frozen Custard anyone? Anyway, back to cafe rio! lol.

Food is pretty good here, though they do tend to make the occasional errors ... forgetting a lime here or there, no guacamole, etc. Never anything huge though, and if you point it out politely to them they will fix it immediately without problem. Customer service has always been a big thing for us and it is probably one of the things that constantly brings us back here. NEVER have we had a problem with the employees or their service, they have always been super kind and helpful! 

Our favorites are the salads, typically we get without rice or beans and just ask for extra lettuce and pico. My wife usually can't finish and I just barely squeek by, lol. Huge portions and with the giant homemade flour tortillas it is a very satisfying meal. Occasionally I'll get a burrito if I'm in the mood for more carbs. The hottest sauce they put on the burritos isn't all that strong, so if you want something more spicy make sure to grab one of the sauces from next to the drinks for that extra kick in the pants. If you want to try something a bit different though you can always try the daily specials! Every day but sunday is a different unique item, monday is chile rellanos for example and you won't find it on the menu any other time. The specials come with a drink included with the price. 

Lastly, make sure you get a stamp card if you plan on coming back, 10 stamps and you get a free meal plus drink! lol, my wife and I already have 2 meals saved up for a special occasion when we are REALLY broke!",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,1,1,4,QZTtTLmcMuw-QNmbJMw9zg

3990930,2013-08-28,2,7KkgMcbVaetryW1wwpzvvA,"No. This is not authentic Mexican food. Did you really expect it to be? I don't get the obsession with this place either. This chain is extremely popular in Utah and everytime I visit I struggle to see why. 

I consider this place a few notches below chipotle. And here's why:

1. The wait. Cafe Rio does the exact same thing as Chipotle. Make a burrito, a salad, or quesadilla. How long does it take to throw some toppings in a silver bowl? At most I've waited 5 min to make a burrito at Chipotle. Cafe Rio, I've been in line 15 min before I can even order. 

2.  My blood pressure rises every time I've eaten here. Can we say salty food?? The rice, the pulled chicken. Lay off the salt!! 

3. Ok I'll give you an extra star for giving me a scoop of guacamole. Including it in the price is a good idea. 

4. How much was my salad?! $8?! Wow. This is the most expensive salad ever. Do you think layering the bottom of the bowl with a tortilla warrants an extra $2 more than a chipotle salad?!

So basically, this is an expensive fast food joint where the food is so-so. I guess if there aren't any other options it'll do. 
The service is extremely slow.",id2PorJklxhytP-JAwpu-Q,2,1,3,Q5-WjFFnhtXroGAwDjhpWw
4014362,2015-03-04,1,7KkgMcbVaetryW1wwpzvvA,"I'm not their biggest fan, but I give it 3 1/2 stars.

I've heard it before, ""Café Rio puts Chipotle to shame."", ""Café Rio is better than Chipotle."", ""Café Rio is my liiiiifffeeee!""  Okay, I didn't hear that last one...but I sure did see the viral video about that for Chipotle.  Either way you are getting the same thing...AN EXPENSIVE BURRITO.

I like Chipotle, I do.  Doing right for the environment blah, blah, blah.  Doing right for the consumer blah, blah, blah.  Doing right for the carnitas blah, blah, blah.  I get it, responsibility.  And I appreciate it.  And I appreciate my overstuffed grilled chicken burrito.  Sometimes you just want a change to see what else is out there.  Hence, the mosey on down to Café Rio.

Décor is very Southwestern meets Latin, unlike Chipotle who is more modern in style.  But the ordering process is very much the same.  See the menu, go down the factory-style line and choose your entrée, meat, beans, cheese, fillings, extras, then pay at the cashier.  Café Rio and Chipotle are very similar in this aspect.  Get in, order, get out ASAP.  The more people you process per hour, the more money you make.  Capitalism with a side of guacamole, I like it.

This is where much of the similarities end.  The food itself at both places is vastly different.  I've come accustomed over the years with the easy order process at Chipotle.  I've grown to like it for it's speed and convenience.  Café Rio easily has much more choices on the menu, but at the cost of speed.  Sometimes I don't want to wait that long in line.  Café Rio lines can get long, which takes up time.  I appreciate the many choices but it almost seems more like a sit down restaurant than a fast casual joint.  Food menu was a bit confusing for me at Café Rio so it left me a bit pressured to order quickly especially with the line building up rapidly behind me.  

Of course I ended up going with an easier choice, a burrito with fire grilled chicken.  Burrito with chicken, black beans, cilantro lime rice, pico de gallo, salsa fresca, sour cream, cheese and extra lettuce, then extra lettuce on the side.  I like how they use the round foil trays for service as well as take out.  Overall it wasn't bad.    
It was definitely missing something though, I couldn't put my finger on it.  Not enough seasoning?  Not enough cilantro?  The salsa choices at Chipotle have a bit more flavor, so my burrito at Café Rio ended up somewhat bland.  it was OK.  

But you know what pi$$ed me off the most about my food?  The price!  It's already $7.79 for a burrito, but an extra DOLLAR for chicken that's been thrown on the grill?  That's $8.79 before tax!  Chipotle gives me just as hearty a burrito for $6.95.  That my friends, makes a big difference to me.  The quality of the burrito at Café Rio does not equate to an extra $1.84, at least not in my opinion.

Wifey got a taco meal which included rice & beans, but that didn't impress me much.  One of my kids got the salad which is actually very good because it comes with a tortilla underneath so it's more like a taco salad you see at Taco Bell, but again the price kinda kills it.  $8.49!  But I give props for that tasty cilantro lime vinaigrette, tangy and sweet.  My other kid got the meat quesadilla off the kid's menu, but it didn't fill her up.  She ended up sharing food with us.  We ordered a side of tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole to share at the table.  Chips and guacamole were great, very fresh.

On the plus side, Café Rio stands out in the drink department over Chipotle.  Coca-Cola for everyone!  Plus, you can partake in their more traditional drinks like horchata (which is pretty good), all included.  

To sum it up, Café Rio isn't bad but it's far from my favorite fast casual place.  The food was OK but the prices were too much on the high end of the scale, ends up being comparable to eating in a sit down restaurant.  I would come here if I really needed a change of pace from Chipotle, but didn't want the grease of Del Taco or Taco Bell.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,1,3,-Ba6zcn_zYyFv4r8L9Filw

I gave up on In-N-Out for Lent.  So, you know what that means. That means I'm eating more chicken and salmon.  Café Rio has both.  My meals at Café Rio is a couple of servings of their Fire'd Grilled Chicken w/Cheese or a couple sides of their Salmon.  Don't expect too much from their salmon filets.  It's usually over-cooked and a lot of the nutrients is visibly cooked off.  Taste wise, it's okay.  I'll usually stick to just the chicken and cheese. This dish is very good and sure beats chicken breast from home.  You can also make it a ""healthier"" burrito by substituting their white tortilla with wheat.  Or, do what I do and just skip the starches and make it protein beast.  The ordering process is simple and quick.  The lines are rarely long and the staff is efficient.  I am a fan of Café Rio.

4146961,2013-01-28,0,7KkgMcbVaetryW1wwpzvvA,"I am struggling to find the positives in Cafe Rio.  Since I have no issues listing the negatives, I'll start there.

First, the interior of the restaurant.  I appreciate what it wants to be looking kind of beach shack meets TexMex but seating is an issue.  There is plenty of it but the restaurant is not big enough.  People are squeezing between chairs and walls just to get to one of the few available tables.  Not too comfortable.  I have a problem with the menu too.  It lists the options and gives a price but not much else.  It gives a starting price and shows you meat options but most options are an extra charge.  What I really wanted would have brought my burrito and fountain drink to well over $10.  For a fast food place? Get real.  So I got the pulled chicken because it was cheaper.  I was disappointed with it.  The chicken was too salty.  The beans in my burrito were good but the rice reminded me of cheap instant rice.  It was not as good as the rice at Chipotle.  The burrito on the whole was alright.  It was big and filling though I've tasted better.  Furthermore, I like to be able to pick up  my burritos and eat with my hands.  I cannot do that at Cafe Rio.  The burritos are rolled loose and are rather saucey.  Too hard to eat with the hands, that is for sure.

On to the positives.  I like the ice at the soda fountain.  And the iced tea was good.  As I mentioned before, the burrito was filling.  That is a mark in the win column.  I like that the tortillas and most everything else is made fresh.  I like that you can see it being made fresh.

Overall, this is not my favorite place for a burrito.  I would rather go to Chipotle or Q'Doba.  In my opinion, they are better and even a little more affordable.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,0,3,0d87u0NPwz-xA0w4EMR7WQ

I got an enchilada style burrito. Inside I got the cilantro rice, with no beans. The sweet barbacoa pork, mild sauce, cheese. I had a side of this creamy green sauce. On the side lettuce and pico.

The food was not as tasty as Chipotle and the service although similar to Chipotle is horrible, I mean terrible.  For a Sunday evening and not very busy the service should be excellent.  Out of the 6 people behind the counter ONLY the lady making the tortillas smiled at us.  And the rest of the staff were all grumpy, not one of them said hello first before what can I get you. Not even a smile.  I got the shredded chicken with black beans, no cheese burrito and then when I got to the girl serving the salsa, I said can I have it on the side, she said sure what else? I said lettuce, she put the salsa down to get the lettuce but never handed it to the cashier.  My friend got the grill chicken taco plate.  We got our order to go and left. My friend said she did not give us the salsa, I said never mind.  I got home and my chicken was dry, the taco plate was not bad.  
Advice to Management, if you are going to compete with Chipotle, even if your food is sub par,   your service needs to be excellent.  I prefer to drive the extra 4 miles to get Chipotle. I give you 1 star because of the service over the food.",0Iy04fJxaKug-kYsi6gvWw,1,0,1,h5GVguenqmncl5hs3wN_sg

Regardless which Cafe Rio location you go to you can expect the food to taste the same, and not worry about anything tasting odd or off. When we went I ordered my usual of a smothered sweet Barbacoa burrito. It was delicious. It oozes with delicious flavor each bite! 
My only qualm about this location is that I found a lot of the workers particularly unfriendly. The man at the front who was making the tortillas was so nice and helpful, but moving along the line, if someone even looked at me it was rare. No one smiled, they rushed you (it wasn't even busy), and they looked miserable. 
It's close to my boyfriends family's house so I am sure I will go again when visiting simply because of convenience.",oT4-j7Kht8P-8EfE9FZCKw,1,1,3,dLLb5p7MzQK_b840w2m1Xg
