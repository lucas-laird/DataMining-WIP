42785,2016-04-26,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,"We are a group of 10 friends that head out for an extra long weekend every other year for some golf, good food and fun.  This year we headed back to Las Vegas and get a big house off the strip.  That provided the opportunity to add an extra twist this time around of getting a Chef to cook dinner one night.  After a handful of failed attempts, I was lucky enough to find Chef Lisa Cornish.

Within hours of my first email to her I got a response saying the dates I had in mind would work, and she needed a few more details on what we would like to do.  We traded menu ideas a couple of times with Lisa providing a choice of numerous dinner options and ideas.  We settled on the shrimp and scallop scampi for the main course.  She also called and we talked about the final menu and ballpark start times just so she knew exactly what we were planning.  Through every step of the planning process Lisa was incredibly responsive and always had some great suggestions on what to include in dinner.  We settled on a dinner and added an antipasto to kick things off.

A day before the event Lisa contacted me and said she needed to arrive an hour or so before the party started to begin the dinner preparations.  As soon as she arrived carrying a couple of large containers with all the fresh ingredients, we knew we were in for something that was going to be special and delicious.  The layout of the house provided us an opportunity to not only watch Lisa practice her craft, but gave us a chance to talk and just have a good time as she prepared dinner.  She didn't skip a beat setting up, preparing our food, and chatting with us.  We were probably a pain in the neck, but she explained to us what she was doing, we exchanged stories, she let us get in close for ""a view"" of what was cooking - it was just a great pre-meal time.  

Then it was time for the antipasto, served up just beautifully and enjoyed by everyone.  Great selection, and great tasting.  Dinner started with a wonderful appetizer and salad (best dressing ever).  She gave us a short break as she was finishing up the main course.  She then served up the best scampi I have ever had and would say the same was true of the 9 other guys eating dinner that night.  The pasta was cooked just right as was the shrimp and scallops.  The scampi sauce was incredible......... just delicious.  It's hard to keep the 10 of us quite, but Lisa pulled it off as we all finished up the main course.  After a nice break and some good conversation she topped it all off with an incredible chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and fresh berries.  All of our expectations were not only exceeded, but blown away.  It was a great dinner party.

The bottom line of this long write up is that if you want a unique, delicious, wonderful and professionally prepared dinner; you just need to start with contacting Chef Lisa Cornish, and don't even spend time searching out others (amazing how some people don't respond to your mail).  When we return to Vegas we will without a doubt have a meal prepared by Chef Lisa (maybe two if we can work it out).  I can't say enough how wonderful and professional the entire experience was from my first email until the final clean-up by Chef Lisa and her assistant.",EHFhtpelYokjwyp1ttia1Q,2,0,5,ztwukjPVQffk19dpFghz7g

For 65 guests, she prepared a BBQ-styled welcome dinner, a reception with dessert, passed hors d'oeuvres for cocktail hour, and a farewell brunch. Everything was delicious, plentiful, and the guests did not stop raving about the food all weekend long. There were several logistical challenges due to the remoteness of the location, which she handled with grace, and she also went above and beyond taking care of other details which were not her responsibility. She's personable, friendly and energetic and was a wonderful and memorable part of our wedding weekend. I highly recommend her for your next event.",pa58HGryqLlUBsR13Ka9Yw,0,0,5,zQJiMx7tQF696obiSP3Jdg

This was the first time I ever did anything like this. What an amazing experience it was! Lisa was so sweet and personable and helped me figure out the perfect three-course menu for the two of us. The food was incredible. My favorite was the Dissected Spicy Crab Stack and loved all the different mini pasties she made for us.  My Husbands favorite was the Jumbo Shrimp Scampi topped with breadcrumbs. Thank you Liza for making our Anniversary memorable and a day I will never forget! I would highly recommend Liza for your next event or private party!

I always plan last minute so Lisa had little time to work with me. She gave me a few options for appetizer, main course, dessert. We quickly decided on a menu. There is always prompt communication so you don't have to worry about any small details. She came to our house one hour prior to serving time. She prepped and cleaned her prepping supplies. We ate right on schedule. The meals were plated and explained to us. The meal was fabulous and the portions were quite large! Even my three children sat through the experience and loved the food!! They wanted more filet mignon the next day. I love that high quality ingredients are used. You can see them as she brings them to your house. We had key lime pie for dessert - it was amazing!! I love everything homemade and am quite picky about high quality ingredients. We polished off the homemade whipped cream with sliced strawberries! 

Lisa works with your budget. It's important to let her know how much you want to spend so she can come up with a budget for you.

I will definitely use Lisa again in the future for private events, parties, cooking/baking lessons in the comfort of our home. We love that there is no clean up or driving anywhere. We eat and relax at home afterwards!

Such a fun experience!! Thank you to Lisa for making it a memorable event for us!",1Iu_PIkNxsVZYRkNZShAKQ,0,1,5,LfrsPMcWlf7dFFTSVSOLkA
536013,2016-04-26,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,"OK - I don't know where to start. For the cliffs notes:

Absolutely perfect. From the first time I contacted all the way to the hugs goodbye when Chef Lisa left after preparing an amazing four course meal at our house.

Longer version:

I contacted Chef Lisa via text as I was at work when I first started reaching out to personal chefs to cook an anniversary dinner for the wife and I. She texted back in about an hour (she was working an event) and let me know she could definitely help and we should talk via phone that afternoon. 

When I got on the phone with Chef I immediately casted aside the two other companies I had reached out to. First off, Chef Lisa does this herself. She is NOT a booking service like many of the others. So, you know you are getting consistency. Secondly, she was able to give me basic costs right away then we tailored a menu to both my tastes and budget. This was all a surprise for my wife. So, Chef asked all the right questions to make sure we we had all of our bases covered. 

I got an email that night with a menu and pricing so we could lock everything in.

The day of Chef Lisa worked with me on timing. Then, I had the idea of having her text me when she got there so I could surprise the wife effectively. She did so and it went perfectly. My wife never knew!

Now on to the process and food. 

She brings all the stuff she needs. I saw a lot of whole foods wrappers and so I trusted the quality of the ingredients. I know there are large wholesalers offering similar quality. But, we had dinner for two. The only thing needed from me were a few pots and pans, plates, utensils, and a stove. She comes in first and introduces herself, gets a lay of the land, then comes back with her supplies. Very professional to not come to the door holding all of these boxes of stuff!

She got a quick tour of my cabinets to find things, then started away. The menu was a surprise for my wife, too, so she kept that under wraps. 

The food:

Here is what we had... 

FIRST COURSE
Pan Seared Sea Scallops atop Pea Puree with Crispy Pancetta
SECOND COURSE
Bistro Salad with Baby Spinach, Arugula, Seasonal Berries, Candied Pecans
THIRD COURSE
Veal Picatta Asparagus Tip Risotto
DESSERT COURSE
Bananas Foster with Housemade Poundcake and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream

Scallops:
Perfectly cooked. Seared. Not overdone but not chewy. Right where they needed to be. On the night of, Chef added corn to the pancetta. It was a perfect addition. The sweetness and additional crunch sat perfectly against the dense scallops and soft pea puree. This was 5 star stuff.

Salad:
Super tasty and a BIG portion. The berries were perfect. Super tart very fresh and very cold. The dressing was awesome and the cheese she used was all pasteurized since my wife is pregnant. Nice attention to detail! The candied nuts are homemade by Chef.

Veal:
OK - so here's where I got scared. It looked... weird. Well when she served it, she explained she doesn't bread veal. Reason being, you can't really enjoy it as much. It could be chicken at that point and you wouldn't know. Well, she was right. This was like eating a thin steak with a super beefy flavor. But you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was just right and thickened to the perfect consistency. This dish doesn't photo well. But man it was good. The portion was great too, we had quite a bit left over which Chef packed up for us and put in the fridge.

Desert:
Pound cake was homemade too. The portion was large! Nice ice cream and the bananas were perfectly crisp without being burned. The sauce was super tasty and not just sugary. My wife couldn't finish hers. The portions all night were generous. 

The little things:
Bullet points here...

Chef was super nice and cordial and talkative when we talked to her. But, when the wife and I started talking to each other she immediately got silent. She just let us be. It was a romantic dinner after all.

The flexibility with scheduling and text messaging and whatnot was great.

Chef told us and showed us a video of her on food network winning a competition show. That was really cool!

She cleaned everything afterwards. I mean she literally wiped down my ENTIRE kitchen top to bottom. The dishes were run in the dishwasher and the trash was packed neatly for me to take out. (FYI to take it out you have to throw it over the car. So, she didn't do that for safety's sake)

Lastly, it seriously felt like we had a friend over. She is so hospitable and cordial, I felt like we had known her for years.

100% recommended. Perfect experience.",mfRNvJFtOR1TdXryJ5iZLA,2,0,5,fJpTdbg9Pv-XujeivGj0NQ
615614,2011-10-04,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,"I live in Washington DC and wanted to plan a special event for 20 friends in Las Vegas. I gambled and went on the internet and ran across The Chef and You, Lisa Cornish, what a FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!! She was personable, friendly and made me feel totally comfortable, since I was planning a party from 3000 miles away. She came up with a menu that I wanted to serve and arranged everything that I asked of her and nothing was too much trouble! The food was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!! THE CAKE she made was the best I have ever tasted and even the guests stated the cake was AMAZING (Vanilla Cake with Bavarian Cream and fresh raspberried covered in chocolate ganache)!! I was sick on the day of the party and Lisa went out of her way to help me, she went to the bar in the hotel to get me a drink of bitters and soda to help me with my nausea, and it worked! She is just amazing and I can't say enough about her!
She is a STAR and should have her own cooking show on TV!

Don't hesitate for one second, this is the BEST CATERER in ALL OF LAS VEGAS!! You can trust her with any party no matter how large or small.

About 9 months after my 1st event that was so successful, I was arranging a party for about 600 people, and I called Lisa immediately, got it all worked out, and of course the party went off without a hitch, the food was amazing, all the guests were so pleased and commented that it was the best catered party they had ever been too! We didn't hear one bad word about that party, the food or the service.

Lisa Cornish is AMAZING and is the ONLY PERSON that you should ever turn to for parties, conferences, etc...

I have another event to plan in Vegas and Lisa is the ONLY PERSON on my list to get it arranged! SHE SHOULD BE THE ONLY PERSON YOU CONTACT AS WELL!!  You won't regret it!",Z-auoziKMV0UUUylVHpXfw,7,0,5,2ilrzzosmDvLE0-h7dcF0A

Tonight we met at Ferguson Bed and Bath to meet with Lisa Cornish, the principal chef for Chef@YourHome.  After Ferguson had closed we stayed behind and Lisa and her assistant Amanda cooked up a four-course dinner at one of the showcase kitchens.

Lisa is very personable, chatted with us and shared her recipes, cooking tips, and asked some fun trivia throughout dinner as if she had been a part of our group for years.  Each course was exceptional and recipes easy to follow, and like other reviewers, we were ""oohing"" and ""aahing"" with each bite.  Our menu included a fresh summer salad with lemon zest dressing, penne pasta with freshly made pesto, tangy chicken Marsala with summer squash, and bananas foster for dessert.

Prices included everything we needed, from the dinnerware, food, and drinks (water and soft drinks only, though we had the option to bring our own adult beverages as well).  After all was finished at the end of the two hour event, everyone in our group of 10 paid about $40 a person to cover the cost (gratuity not included).  Not bad, considering a dinner and show would cost significantly more.  We were also able to take home the leftovers!

Lisa is also available for hire for catering and party supplies through the main part of her business called CurrentEvents.  She can be hired for home, cooking classes or dinner for two people or groups, and will even go shopping with you to help you stock up on kitchen food staples and help you become the best cook at home.",9wcVVBRouYb-8c0vDL39Dg,9,2,5,uccTEY6iU79D0dZkYn84OQ

Already planning to use her for additional events back on the east coast. The food was as good as advertised.",HiQU_ImViNaHOMZJKwzJOA,0,0,5,3ZcmjlW7F4JxFGdF-KM4fw

She worked with my budget and still made everything I wanted including one of the best cakes I've ever had in my life (my guest all agreed). If you are ever in the Vegas area and need someone to cook for your party or event I would totally recommend Lisa; she is personable, friendly, accommodating and a fabulous cook. We had an delicious charcuterie, scallops, crab cakes, chicken salad, sliders and a custom mac n' cheese / pasta bar- it was so good i'm getting hungry just thinking about it. We also had enough food leftover to feed us for a couple of days. A couple of my friends that came to the party own restaurants and they were so impressed they were trying to recruit her.",0zD5RC5Jp-bSFszlYUDf8A,0,0,5,S1EclDfmvNJZxLlNYp-DwA
5247411,2018-04-18,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,"We are from out of town and my wife and I just got married this past weekend in Las Vegas.  We searched for chefs with high reviews on Yelp to cater our wedding ceremony meal.  We are huge fans of brunch food so we had a mid morning wedding with brunch served right after from Chef Lisa and her outstanding team.  From the moment we reached out to her last fall on what we were looking for, she was very knowledgeable of the event venues around Las Vegas and what they would and would not allow us to do without written knowledge from the venue themselves.  It was a nice to receive that feedback from her just so we would not take a chance on getting a larger bill from the venue after our event was done.  We had many hiccups with our wedding leading up to the event but the only thing that was flexible in this whole deal was Chef Lisa.  Not only did she work around our timing issues and room situation issues but she delivered an outstanding meal with impeccable service to all 50 people at our event.  She even noticed that a few of the food items were getting low so she was very quick to make a plate for my wife and I since we got to the room late to eat.  After things started to slow down, we invited her and her team to have a drink with us.  I can only image how chaotic their morning was prepping a feast for 50 people...that deserves a drink in my book.  Chef Lisa and her team interacted with the group and made sure all had plenty of drinks and food the whole time!  BTW, the food was amazing.  Not your typical catered food that is overcooked, bland or cold from sitting out.  It was all fresh and prepared perfectly.  It was an amazing meal!  I wish I got pictures of the food but most was gone by the time my wife and I got to the room.  Not to add to all the praise but they cleaned up in no time. Trash was picked up, counters wiped down, dished all cleaned, the furniture was straightened back up and they were loaded back up.  Thank you Chef Lisa and to your team for this past weekend.  I hope you and your team enjoyed our event as much as our guest, my wife and I did!",YpGAllyEMZtWUnWZSUUCaA,0,0,5,7kDdfL-4x2unlQZB8MXL9Q

She recommended an amazing menu, including a pasta, salmon and petit filet.  The food was amazing!  Chef Lisa arrived on time and with all her own tools.  She cooked a fabulous meal and left my house as clean as when she arrived!!  If your looking to have an event catered, she is definitely your person!!",7CHyMNOfIXyOGIuDeSjmVA,0,0,5,oMWXAtjfpgdqPlMnvW4XXw
5424753,2017-05-10,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,"We used Chef Lisa for 2 events in May 2017. She did a cooking class/lunch for 10 people one day, and brunch for 8 people another day. She was so easy to communicate with before and during the events. She did a great job of connecting with everyone and answering questions. 

As for the food: SO DELICIOUS! For the lunch we had a charcuterie plate, beef tenderloin appetizers, a salad, cucumbers topped with chicken salad and cranberry. Then Chef Lisa showed us how to make macadamia encrusted sea bass and fig and asparagus risotto. And of course there was a desert tray! For the brunch we had bacon, sausage, an egg scramble, fruit, salad, and a huge pastry tray. It was all amazing!

There's a reason she has 5 stars. I can't recommend her enough!",LfaLwtPEVg5y7qvZYiUehA,1,0,5,m6BdOWyjdNZbjJjRnx9A5A
5507482,2016-08-30,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,I hired chef Lisa to cook for my husbands surprise birthday party. Everything was amazing. All our guest raved about the food. She is a amazing. Everything was wonderful. We had appetizers when guest arrived. The dinner was a 3 course meal. The bacon wrapped shrimp  was so delicious I wanted to lick the plate. Every one of our guest cleaned their plates. Not only was the food great the service was so good. She definitely knows how to entertain. The best part is the she does all the dishes and cleans up the kitchen and table while we enjoyed the rest of our evening. Thank you Lisa. I will be calling you again.,CjG3YCqzEXznflfvyPClmw,0,0,5,OFh3IBvdBDuWNLnXYuq7uQ
5833026,2017-11-19,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,"Chef Lisa is absolutely amazing to work with. I was planning for a 17 guy bachelor party and found Chef Lisa on Yelp. I reached out via email and immediately was in touch with Lisa. She was so accommodating and accessible through texts, emails, and phone calls. The entire process was so seamless from the initial call to the clean up after dinner. Lisa worked with me to customize the dinner after giving me a recommendation on the menu. 

On top of all of this, Lisa and her team even checked out or AirBNB prior to our arrival to make sure we had space and seating for all 17 guys. She helped order a little furniture (table and chairs) and came prepared with ALL the utensils and silverware.

Each dish came out perfect and everything was cleaned up immediately after.

Also, her assistant was so professional and nice. Super helpful throughout the night and saw that they had great chemistry working with each other. 

Service: impeccable
Communication: perfection
Food: 5 star restaurant at your own home and comfort
Professionalism: out of this world
Experience: this was the cherry on top of a very memorable bachelor party with the crew

I would highly recommend her for a private dinner of any size.",t9njz-htzO1fN_fpfv7PLA,1,0,5,qzP5G2G72pVtBiyichGh8A
5850819,2016-03-24,0,prIta4agQiDpUQVY3MliFA,"My sister found chef Lisa and got her to cater my bachelorette dinner in Vegas. I'm a huge foodie and wanted something unique as a dinner experience. I also wanted something that would be more intimate than going out to a restaurant. There were 16 of us and not once did we have to worry about portion size. The portion sizes were huge! The 4 course meal she prepared was out of this world.  I'm still dreaming about the sea bass. It literally melted in my mouth. And don't even get me started on the chocolate bundt cake she made for dessert. It was a little piece of chocolate heaven in my mouth. We could barely finish it so we all had it for breakfast the next day. Each of the dishes was beautifully put together, and to my utter joy, tasted even better.  She was a complete professional who came well prepared and did a thorough job cleaning up after. Thank you Chef Lisa for making my bachelorette even more memorable with your cooking. And a bigger thank you to my sis for finding her!",jM6IroDAbJzDliIx7QUgtA,0,0,5,UK3axmeTht48hPnSZ7f4qw
