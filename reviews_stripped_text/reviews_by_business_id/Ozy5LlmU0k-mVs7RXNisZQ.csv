First I asked about the 5 dollar foot long as to was it not offered there,  due to being in front of the outlet mall or are they not offering it the girl laughed and replied i guess both. My bread was dry and crumbly, the meat which was cold cut combo had no flavor like the meat had been frozen. I even tried taking off all the toppings to see if that was just hiding the meat flavor and that was not it. This is my first bad experience at subway, and hopefully my last. I will just choose another location next time i am wanting a sub sandwich.",p9c15C0TiryLJKobzwPt1A,0,0,1,-SMGT8SwEMDDsq4-Xabe3A

Not only did he make us wait for him to make the bread when we were the only ones inside, he also didn't ask of if we wanted our sandwiches toasted but preceded to anyways. He also refused to put extra cheese on our sandwiches. Then when the sandwiches came out of the toaster oven, the cheese had slide off and he didn't do anything about it, all the vegetables were old and lettuce browning, they didn't have a lot of the sauces. The worker was extremely rude the entire time, and not just to me but everyone that came in.You would figure in Las Vegas where there are always a lot of people coming in the subway would try to hire better employees and keep the ingredients fresh.",aFN-2bUAOWRXIpCJQ8hPuA,0,0,1,KL0t4s3f_hjGHSwrGSA4gw

Whoa! Don't forget to mention the other team member hovered over the register waiting for you to pay for your food. Only so he can clock out for his break or time out for the day and eat his cold slice of Villa Pizza.  Yes, Yelpers it was that kinda day at subway. Did i forget to tell you that the Sandwich Artist kept putting her dirty elbows all over the sandwich board while making the food.  It was almost as if she was so exhausted to be making two sandwiches.  I am sure it will be at least two years now before I try this concept again.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,0,0,2,JIny6ge4jleSPqITYocoIA

3646670,2014-06-08,0,Ozy5LlmU0k-mVs7RXNisZQ,Whoever did the hiring at this Subway deserves a pat on the back. The staff is always patient and helpful and the food is always prepared correctly. I'll gladly drive past the other 2 Subways between my house and this location to eat here.,tl-1Dcoz6-qMqdX8B8m7HA,0,0,5,L5U7l7IBm1cn5Vu2-1K8nA
3647437,2015-03-08,0,Ozy5LlmU0k-mVs7RXNisZQ,This subway was awful. We are from out of town and came in at 1045am for lunch. There was only one gentleman in line already getting his sandwich made when we walked in. The worker making the sandwich appeared to be new as he asked the girl sitting on her phone in the back questions about making the sandwiches. He was pleasant but she didn't offer to help and didn't respond to several of his questions because she was too busy on her phone. So he would  have to ask a second time. Her name is Selina. After we got our food we sat down to eat and listened to Selina talk to the other worker about the closer from the night before in a very poor manor using swear words while they were in the front of the store. Our sandwiches were very dry and the bread was falling apart. As we left the two workers were at the register talking badly still about the other co worker and my husband purposely said Thanks Guys as we walked by them to leave and neither one looked up or said good bye. The worst food and service ever!!!!,iuRPXyllXsJapJBmHp6X9Q,0,0,1,nBkftV4vz8FG5uWaXiAvPA

4223212,2015-08-09,0,Ozy5LlmU0k-mVs7RXNisZQ,Place was very clean. Tried the new Turkey/bacon guacamole sub very good. Mark was over nice and very good about  customer service. Thank for having the different teas. Like how they have all the chips displayed. Table over a Subway supervisor was going over scores with store manager on rankings of the store. By the way the Biscuits and Gravy chip were great.,KnzboKNnJ4OBTHUbq1cBgQ,0,0,5,CyUYiN-tW-ZC5ySHyzrQFw

Usually you get employees who seem like they've spent a little too much time in the back smoking pot, but the staff here is always upbeat and friendly.  The guy always asks me if I need my sandwich cut or wrapped in any special way.  You always get a very well put together sandwich.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,0,0,4,jQFk5V7xV5Y790PoXg2zuA

Your overnight employee locked the doors and turned the lights off on me when I walked up! Terrible business and a prime example of false advertisement! Im defiantly going to better business bureau about this!! Screwed me out of dinner, thanks :(",ta_Xf1_sV8HBiAi56CAcuw,0,0,1,msG5YTU316C85QqNSvYehw
5288462,2014-07-02,0,Ozy5LlmU0k-mVs7RXNisZQ,Terrible service. Some old lady who works there was extremely rude. I asked what was on 2 new sandwiches that they added and she replied with such a rude attitude.  Made my sandwich very sloppy.  And when I asked her to use a different knife to cut my sandwich she refused and said she had wiped that one down. The customer before me got tuna and I hate that and didn't want the taste on my sandwich.  I don't recommend going to this crappy subway because of the old rude lady. If the management knew how many customers she offends I hope she would be let go.,5aTkrcMQviCmsElCPtMbJQ,0,0,1,lkZvKSwnNYMeR-NvvDVDrg

However , they are not open until 2 am (per Yelp) nevertheless open 24 hours (Per google maps). They close @ 10 pm as advised by the staff. Management needs to fix hours of operation listed online. Also, cookies were a little to hard.  Defiantly seems like they were from overnight or something.",JB6RHkBWiSv-HYt1yid0Yw,0,0,2,gTNbobuW5vubc50yyOzpHg
