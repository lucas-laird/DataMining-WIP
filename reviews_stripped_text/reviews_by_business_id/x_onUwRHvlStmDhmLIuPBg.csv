Pizza was good, bar vibe is great, bartenders were great.  Joe stopped by and introduced himself.  Nice guy. 

I will stop by again!",x66yoOhtX42f6zI5c93ZuQ,2,0,5,YN_wpOZKCkEfwvDS-dTYlw

Had a few drinks during the playoffs and the owner Joe stopped to ask and make sure I was ok to get home (I only live a spit throw away), but appreciate the concern. Great place, thank you!",RNfwitXrQ1rtN5DHqO86AA,0,1,5,BJZRTK8ZZw2alCEshGRKlw

First time the bartender was awesome!  The pizza was great. ..even enjoyed it the next day for lunch. Second time, not so great bartender service. ....sat quite some time with an empty beer and they just kept walking past me (insert sad face). Good thing my to go italian beef was awesome. The other bars that have been in this location over the years have failed. ....I'd really like to see this place succeed. ...not only because I'm from Chicago and it's a Chicago style bar.",iK6gjoHlK0AhMCgXyHJMDA,0,2,4,Gw-8mg9P42suDw4H_TdpbQ

The bartender was definitely on point, he called himself Baby T. He was attentive, very personable, and made sure I was taken care of the whole time. It's cool that the owner, Joe, hangs out at the bar and a pleasure to talk to. I recommend this place to relax and the food was a big plus.",qhkzKK8ZUaSKpUPRLI5x3g,0,0,5,RnzaP9ydFxbSlQzvzThXTQ
3275972,2018-05-16,1,x_onUwRHvlStmDhmLIuPBg,The staff was friendly and the place is clean. From what I overheard from those that ordered food it was good quality but a little on the pricier side. Joe himself is a loudmouth (loud voice and made comments to me I never asked for when I just wanted to be left alone). Overall I'd say it's a pretty decent place and better than most in the area but still has to compete with the Bar Rescue famous Bacon Bar.,0_S-BGrvSY1UjttA3TnzuA,0,1,3,7QGeEUop51BfgmhJjVnXRg

Our outstanding server was Ashley, and she was a great person with a firecracker personality! She was by herself and did a fabulous job attending to the bar and the eating area. Drinks and food were excellent as well as the service!
We'll be back because of Ashley!",L1F4_uPZTZ6wYApce5MeWA,2,1,5,9hGUvvMEPiCMNC4aTGSZfg

Lots of Tv's playing sports , high ceilings and a modern interour to this Chicago themed bar and restaurant. Regular need, craft choices, full bar all help compliment the food choices. We all enjoyed the thin crust pizza. We went back the next night to watch the Golden Knights Game",FhkZk24n_Dh-pVLpBKUwEw,0,0,5,hEvfu_gCPsEfx4iiUR8PAA
5767306,2018-04-29,0,x_onUwRHvlStmDhmLIuPBg,"Disappointed.  Went to their 'Grand Opening' on the 28th, but was told that was at 8pm, not 2pm when we arrived.  Ok, no big deal, let's check this place out. Everyone is friendly, especially Brandon.  Food seems reasonably priced.  Plenty of TVs, and the place was clean.  Got some players cards, and played while ordered several items off the menu.  The combo platter was OK, but nothing more than standard frozen fried food.  Next up was the Michael Jordan sandwich and some fish and chips.  The sandwich was very good, but the fish and chips were bland tasting.  While I'm not professing to be some food critic, I know flavor when I taste it. The big disappointment came when we received the bill.  We were charged for the 3 draft beers and 2 soft drinks while playing their slots.  I'm not looking for the world here, but you might wanna toss out a 'bone' to people who are players. Bars and casinos are a dime a dozen in this town, I look for places that are not run of the mill.",YuWUrq-TA-QW_EC30FFaKg,0,2,2,b0ZR_G12gRA0wBHvQJhprg
