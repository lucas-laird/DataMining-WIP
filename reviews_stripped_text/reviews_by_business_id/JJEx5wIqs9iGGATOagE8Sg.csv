Beans are a no go, and rice was average. My suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a Baja Fresh, go to another location, they do have good food!",zkBFQaTaDNU_BwSpY_ggyw,0,1,2,5eV4fmrjCUYlqwXv7fRtrg

As I've mentioned before, after I realized how many calories are in one of these bad boys (2,020 calories!), I reduced the number of visits to Baja Fresh.  That's 3 hours on the Elliptical for me!

This location is convenient because it's in a shopping center with Walmart & Sam's Club nearby.....which are 2 places I frequent.  Of course, their signature Salsa Bar and plenty of seating is available.

Will I return?  When I'm in the mood to gain some poundage, I'll stop by.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,6,4,3,auRzBEMw9u7KFLdG34cZEw

I appreciate the salsa is fresh and kept clean. I like that the food is fresh and doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna have cardiac arrest.

I tend to like Burrito Bowls and I thought it's rather weird they charge you to ""upgrade"" it.....Uh, you saved a tortilla by puting it in a container, isn't that not a ""downgrade"" ? I would think they wouldn't charge you $1.50 to do that. 

It has the same amount of food in the bowl as a burrito so you didn't really get more for the price which I initially thought was the price difference. Seriously- unwrap one and throw it in a bowl and see. Sure, they add lettuce, but it's not even much. Only other ""upgrade"" available- enchilada/wet style burrito....that makes sense since you're gaining sauce and cheese. I guess make bowls at Chipotle, do a burrito at Baja. 

 I know, it's a small thing, but it's rather weird to me!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,5,3,Sx3j9Tf6ajNnIWtl5GfaYw
