690936,2010-05-24,0,1Iz9OlIJi12jLWrQYoUsAA,"Wanted: atmosphere, good wine and decent food for Sunday -early dinner.
Received: expensive place, mediocre wine and salty, processed food in a place that looked like it had seen better days.

I will start out and say we had the nicest staff! No complaints at all on our service! I feel bad that they have to serve this food in this place and try to do it with a smile. I don't think I could (and I have worked food for years)

We called on the off chance Chianti's would be open on a Sunday- and they were (though they will be closing Sun and Mon for ""the season"" starting next week. I didn't realize there was a season for eating....but we decided to try it  based on the reviews.

We enter, and it is dark and empty  Greeted and seated by lovely Mary who explained it was happy hour and gave us a moment to look over the menus. I had a few questions, ordered a glass of their house cab and my partner ordered chianti on her suggestion. We also ordered the Mozzerella Fritta.

The wine came and the cab was so sweet it tasted like fortified wine. I questioned the bartendress (also lovely) and she tried it and said yes, it was sweeter than normal, would I like something else? I ended up with my bf's chianti (which wasn't amazing, but definitely better). The Fritta came and it was essentially two very large triangles of breaded, frozen moz that were barely cooked through, VERY salty and had chunky tomato sauce on them. Edible, but not fresh.

After looking through the menu and  a few more questions, (Only the Lobster Ravioli are handmade (why not the cheese?)  I decided on the manicoti (which I was told was prepared there) in bechemel sauce with fresh spinach and my bf got the orange roughy special (artichoke hearts, capers and sun dried tomatoes).

We asked about how busy the place was, (Friday night is hopping apparently!) and who the main clientele is (Older people from Sun City) but they get a mix. We were told it dies down in the Summer, which is why they were closing Sun/Mon.

I have now run out of wine, and so started looking through the dirty menus (all four of them were stuck with old food) to select another. I chose a 9/glass McManis cab- and after searching for it- two other opened bottle were brought out because they were ""in the process of drastically cutting down the list"". Neither were great and both had been open at least a day and recorked. I asked them how long each had been open and was told no more than a day on one and 2 at the MOST on the second bottle. If you are going to have wine open at all for more than a day-  vacuum seal it.

Plates come and are as hot as Mary tells us they would be (which means mine has been sitting under some heat lamp for awhile after being microwaved).

The plates look ok- I can do without all the parsley garnish on EVERY plate- but whatever.

The manicoti does have fresh spinach on top, but it is not in a bechemel sauce- it tastes like a who jar of Ragu Alfredo was poured over 3 frozen manicoti and nuked for 4-5 minutes. I understand you have to make things ahead and heat them up sometimes- but at least bake the items! No fresh cheese bubbling- only a thin layer of film from having sat for a minute too long under the lamps while the fish was cooked.
Speaking of the fish- it wasn't bad. Not amazing, and kinda fishy smelling- but edible and nicely presented. Like everything, it was salty and plenty of frozen items were used to concoct it- but edible.

There are now 2 other tables, one of which came just after us and they heard the same thing we did - Fridays are hopping, the chianti is great and Mary recommends the lobster ravioli (at $22, I can see why).
The next table is much more interesting.....having driven all the way across town to be here (really?) but then I hear why. Our bartender's martinis are among the best in town- and probably what we should have ordered to wash the rest of our meal down with! Doh!

End of meal comes- leftovers wrapped  and my bf now wants an espresso or capp.- do they have amachine? Yes. He asks- will I hear the milk froth? No- it comes in a ""pod"". He gets espresso anyhow. No bueno, and has 3 sugars in the espresso cup to just gulp it down. For $3? 

We could not be tempted with the ""Homemade Tiramisu"" so sat and finished our wine while pondering the place.

Our conclusion is that Chianti Cafe needs to contact Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and get a facelift. There is NO REASON why this place couldn't make it, but there is a WHOLE list of things that need to change. You can tell the owners are feeling the pinch, so have cut as many corners as they can. Sad really- LV doesn't have enough of these small, community spots.
Despite the nice staff, we will not go back (but will check out the new Chronic Tacos that opened next door!)
As for giving Nora's a run? Not a chance! Even at their worst- they use fresh food and have properly stored wine.
We are disappointed, but know where to go for a martini!",1llLRrB6uFwACTleMfoYuA,1,1,2,d4ChlEyALfRINShzrZhjJw
1120734,2008-08-13,0,1Iz9OlIJi12jLWrQYoUsAA,"My wife and I went to Chianti for our anniversary.  And, we had a 20% off coupon.  We started with the garlic bread and as an appy ordered the cheesy artichoke dip (Carciofi Gratinati).  Both were wonderful, as were the drinks on the specials menu.  For our entrees, we ordered the Margherita pizza and the eggplant parm (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The pizza was.....OK, nothing to write home about, but the eggplant parm was absolutely perfect, with the accompanying pasta served perfectly al dente.  We mentioned to the excellently attentive waiter that it was our anniversary, and he brought out a huge slice of tiramisu for our dessert, without our asking for it, and without charging us for it!  And when he brought out the check, we noticed he'd taken the 20% off the entire meal, including alcohol.  Doesn't get any better than that.  Now if they could only make the pizza a little more enticing, they'd earn five stars.",I2LqdDguUbkh22hc06dgWQ,0,1,4,ICb5MZmWR5r0jTCRXdg0SQ

With the use of Yelp on my iPhone, my family and decided to try Chianti Cafe which was nearby.  We were thrilled with this place.  Nice quiet ambiance with delicous italian entrees.  The place has an air of sophistication but is not pretentious--very down to earth fine dining.  Service was excellent and friendly.   We ordered from the chef's additions to the menu of that day.  The orange roughy with the special sauce (which I cannot remember the name of) was excellent.  The Linquini with fresh clams (with shell and all) in white sauce was a treat.  The italian sausage rigatoni (they had a different name for it) was slightly bland for my taste, but, was still very good.

Great place.  We also like the baked bread with Tapenade while we waited.",XYP9RvJGnRy6YvvoN34qeg,0,0,4,kQdr6lp9d2WVDqhCGGb4CA

I've had the veal in the sweeter sauce with pasta. It's so good that I can't really order anything else. Excellent service, and not too crowded. 
  Nora-Snora (previous review). This place is much better.
 Great for a date or for out-of-town company. Casual , and awesome food. check the local ads for an entree free ad. We've used them several times.",8vyIdW57BQa1R4DzuG367Q,0,0,5,aOUvMa_vqA8N60zFGq9fBA
2796945,2010-09-12,0,1Iz9OlIJi12jLWrQYoUsAA,"My girlfriend loves one of the lounge singers here, so I met a friend for dinner one rainy evening.  Nobody greeted me at the door and once sat, I was the only one in the dining room section.  Once my friend arrived, we ordered wine that took a looooooooong time to come.  The lounge singer kept coming to our table & singing when we were obviously deep in conversation.  The first time we were polite & clapped when he walked away, but the second time & third time it was so loud my ears hurt.  He asked when finished if it was too loud and I said ""a bit"".  He seemed offended and I said ""you asked"".  The food was OK and we will not be coming back.",A60ZTslcjF1Jy9dMnR31Tw,0,0,2,jis9W0FbZeIf_M0E1Vz4-w
4484319,2010-04-23,0,1Iz9OlIJi12jLWrQYoUsAA,"Chianti cafe is not a place worth going out of your way for, but if in the area you can get a better than average lunch at a reasonable price. In fact, they publicize their lunch menu as ""everything under $10,"" so you're pretty much forced to be frugal. If you have been there before, I'd like to let you know it has recently changed management. Apparently the restaurant was going downhill before they did, so if you had a bad experience you might want to try it again.

My Greca salad ($7.95) was quite enjoyable, and a touch unique. It was tossed with a creamy garlic dressing rather than a vinaigrette, which was a nice change, and the feta cheese was not of your standard supermarket variety. This cheese was soft and mild, without much salt. Though I personally prefer feta with a little more tang,  this was of good quality nonetheless and you do get some brininess from the kalamata olives.

My husband had the pastrami sandwich ($9.95) which was tasty but not delivered as promised. Instead of fries it came with a good version of basil mashed potatoes (I still would have preferred fries) and instead of the more appropriate rye bread listed in the description it was served on a soft hoagie. Additionally, the presentation was pretty sloppy as mustard was EVERYWHERE around the outside. There was too much mustard inside the sandwich as well, and it would have benefited from the use of whole grain or deli mustard rather than yellow. I still liked it as the pastrami itself was tender and delicious, but with a little improvement it would have been great.

Overall, it was a good lunch at a reasonable price, but not a real find by any means. I've had their pasta, which is fine, but not great, and the menu is fairly mainstream. It's just your average neighborhood Italian eatery in a nice area.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,4,1,3,46cRGx-2ApELBK-N6UUZuA

I love going here for a relaxing  dinner or drinks and appetizers at the bar with friends.  Anytime friends or family come to visit, my boyfriend and I always make sure to take them here.  The lobster ravioli is to die for, although I believe that is a limited item. 
The bread and tapenade are always enjoyable. This is one place I definitely don't mind paying alittle more for.",bMdlxWIB_iq_qnPD2a0_Wg,1,2,5,3pgcknSFRgLwjChbDv3HYw
