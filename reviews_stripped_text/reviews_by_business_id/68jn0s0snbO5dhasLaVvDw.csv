As a frequent traveler to Southeast Asia, and Singapore in particular, Hainan Chicken Rice is something I constantly long for. Imagine my surprise when Flock and Fowl opened just down the street from me. 

Let's start with the amazing team. Jenny will remember your name and your preferences, take care of your order, and have a great conversation when she isn't busy with other guests. The kitchen team is hard working and the wait is never long. 

The chicken rice is the best I've had outside of Asia. Period. If you miss this food from the other side of the pacific, Vegas has it. I've also had their unique specials, like the chicken katsu sandwich which is superb! 

I will keep coming back. Support local. Support delicious. Thank you Flock and Fowl for setting a new standard in town!",c_8mVHgveLNVd2wdUT7EHw,0,0,5,Ut3aozI8C3m07Y8eXAs-_Q

I've ordered the Hainan chicken that came with a trio of sauces, which she explained, I also ordered the chicken bao. Perfectly seasoned, the micro greens gave it a balance in each bite of the meal. Delicious! Just thinking about it while typing this review is making my mouth water. They also suggested to pair the poached chicken with the chrysanthemum tea, and it was on point.

399465,2017-10-26,2,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Flock & Fowl was a staple in reigniting the food scene in Las Vegas. It's clean, simple, and homegrown family approach to it's delivery has won the hearts of many diners in the valley. With it's early hours and limited availability of food people were literally flocking to this location to get a taste of it's most famous dish. 

Food: Flock is famous for one thing and that one thing is done to perfection. The Hainan Chicken with Rice. The best one I've ever had was in Singapore many years ago and this one is probably the closest thing to it within a 500 mile radius. The fact that they took a common street food and made it in as traditional as possible yet uses farm fresh ingredients is genius. Hainan Chicken is a very clean and light dish, and Flock definitely hits these points. The rice isn't too oily but it's packed with flavor from the chicken oil. The poached chicken is also not too oily and not dry but instead soft and tender to a point it melts in your mouth. Sauces are the traditional parings with the marinated cucumbers being extremely fresh. The Farm Fresh Organic egg is also a great add on to the dish as it fills in something I never thought was missing when eating Hainan chicken.  It's hard to comprehend the simplicity yet delicacy of this dish but just know that this is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to Hainan Chicken. 

It's odd location and small interior is reminiscent of many restaurants in the boroughs of NYC or Los Angeles. If it wasn't for Flock not many people would be in this shopping center especially at the time it opened. But the draw of good food has the ability to draw people from all types of places. The fact that Flock has made it's name off of this simple yet delicate dish is of course remarkable and it is definitely a must try no matter where one is coming from.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,1,0,4,DFq6qAU4AK3PBrwaqKTR8Q

419646,2016-07-06,1,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"The original poached chicken was like velvet - it definitely lived up to expectations.  The roasted spring chicken was equally good - very tender and juicy, and the skin was perfectly seasoned and crispy.  And the RICE! Those three items were the star of the show.  

The buttermilk fried chicken tenders and the chicken wings were alright, more like backup dancers.

My only complaint is the lack of a restroom.  The place is an ""order at the counter and get a number"" establishment, but it is located in a very small strip mall away from Las Vegas Blvd without much around it.  We were told that the cigar shop next door had a restroom but the folks there were (understandably) not happy about us using it.  I would give them one less star but didn't because I would chance a potty accident for some of that chicken and rice.

Poached chicken rice- The rice was excellent, fragrant and not too oily. Condiments provided complemented the chicken and rice well. I had to have a 2nd serving of them. Added an order of soup which was hot, comforting and more flavourful than what we were used to. 

Bao- Tenders were a bit dry. Bao was fluffy.

Chicken wings- The Thai wings were a bit too salty for our tastes. 

Service- Impeccable. Food was served quickly. Always pleasant, young lady who took our order was flexible and allowed me to add on the soup after our chicken rice was served. (Paid for soup at the end)

Verdict- F&F's poached chicken rice compares favourably to Singaporean versions we are used to. That alone is worth four stars. The service provided tops it up to five.",OdG1s0mhiuvgQFBxqmktxw,1,0,5,GbwIp8CppBkmYCh6RMm7_A

The woman (Jenny) taking the orders, seating and serving people was ""High Stress."" Although polite, her anxiety level ruined the atmosphere. I think all customers would rather wait a few minutes then deal with a high stressed server. The pictures and presentation of the food was amazing although the food (at least what we ordered) either lacked flavor or was overly  sauced. The fried chicken bao buns were dry and the chicken pieces were to large and unevenly cut for the size. This place has a nice idea but not executed well. The menu is up front or on the wall which was confusing and then Once you realized you had to order in the front you are rushed to order which the leads to likely ordering the wrong items and don't expect the server to give you any suggestions unless you want them to basically bombard you with the whole menu rather than an actual suggestion. I don't need to say anything more about rice that costs 4.00...yes rice. My general rule is that any Asian restaurant that need to charge for rice is going in the wrong direction.

Hainanese Chicken (poached): The chicken is extremely tender, moist and perfectly cooked. The chicken is definitely the star of the dish, simple yet delicious. Three homemade sauces ( scallion/ginger, thick soy, sambal) highlight the simplicity of the dish. 

Baos: Similar to the peking duck but replaced with a deep fried chicken. The chicken is so moist/ crunchy and pairs well with the greens. The bao was fluffy and sweet. Yum.

Chicken wings: Sriracha honey. Finger licking good.

The chicken is super tender and the skin is my favorite part! It comes with deboned half dark half white meat. I really wish I can pick between dark meat or white meat - I personally liked the dark meat so much more! The three sauces that come with the dish are super good - hot sauce, ginger sauce, and sesame soy sauce. But if you like a sweeter taste, you should request the sweet soy sauce. I like to put all four sauces on the chicken and the rice, super yummy combo! 

The prices are a little steep - the Chicken Rice is $8.99 then $1.99 extra for Chinese sausage. But they do use high quality ingredients! 

Beware that this place is not that fast if you are in a hurry or want to pick up to-go quickly. It took ~20-25 minutes to order and get our food.

The perfectly cooked chicken is complemented by the house made sauces - sambal, sweet soy, and ginger and scallion.  Dip anyway you like - no wrong way to eat.  Sure, sometimes chicken is just chicken.  Confront the chicken like necessary protein, and savor the chicken fat rice.  So, so good!  I could eat a gigantic bowl of the rice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner several weeks in a row.  Apparently, we have to thank Sheridan Su's mom, Mrs. Han, for the recipe...THANKS!

Menu is simple (today) - Hainan chicken and rice, wings, salad, and fried chicken tenders.  Teas highlight the drink menu.  Try any one of them. Wings are sold by the half and pound.  Not super crispy wings, but perfectly sauced and juicy on the inside.  

This place is west of Fat Choy's on Sahara.  It's not the greatest of neighborhoods (pawn shop next door), but who cares?!  It's better food than you can get at a lot of Strip restaurants.

1389101,2016-05-15,0,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Location - 4 stars 
Small, and small shared parking

Set up - 2 stars
Nice rustic decor, tastefully designed.  Very small space.. Total of maybe 6 or 7 tables for 2.  I don't recommend a large group.  We had 7 guests and luckily the timing was right for us, or else I'm not sure how we would dine.

Menu - hard to read, it's on the wall so everyone is crowding the same area.  Specials were scattered in different chalk boards.

Order then sit - this is my least favorite thing about this place. Usually order then sit is for take out driven (fast food) or a large food court with plenty of seating.  Our group and another 2 groups behind us were waiting to be seated (esp when the place is so small, you wouldn't just go sit down on an empty seat, common courtesy) however, the staff tells you to order first, chances are you can order and what if somebody takes the only empty seat as they come in while you're ordering? Are you forced to take your food ToGo? And the line to order is literally right next to our table. If menus were given during the wait and orders were taken at the seated tables, the place wouldn't seem so unorganized.

Staff - 5 stars
The waitress we had was energetic and helpful. Also educational with the product.

Taste - 4 stars 
Everything was flavorful and tasty.  But not something that blows my mind.  Coming from LA, I am very familiar with Hainan Chicken.

1438092,2015-11-23,0,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"My friends and I had heard about this place far before it was opened, on some article online (probably by Eater, or someone). After seeing the tons of great reviews, we had decided to try it out for lunch. 

I've had hainan chicken in various styles (famous Thai style at Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra, CA) or Malaysian/Singaporean style in various restaurants in different cities. 

As this place is owned by the locally well-known Great Bao/Fat Choy, Sheridan and Jenny, its gotta be good ! 

Upon entry, you are greeted behind the counter by Jenny, rigorously taking orders in person and by phone herself. You go to her to place your order and pay before sitting at a table.

As said, my friends and I had ordered the Hainan Chicken (listed as organic free range chicken) with some of us ordering a side of chinese sausage (random craving). There are also other choices of egg, broth, salad, etc. 

The chicken comes de-boned, mix of dark and white meat. Tender and juicy. Rice cooked with chicken oil/fat and broth giving it a nice lift of fragrant flavor and aroma, while keeping each grain of rice nice and firm. Sauces that come with it is the traditional ginger and green onion sauce, sweet soy sauce, and a house-made spicy sauce. 

I dont recall where they get their chicken but for one who is used to chinese free-range chicken, it wasn't similar. Generally for a chinese free-range chicken, the meat is firm and ""chewier"" with a fairly deep yellow skin that has a ""crispier"" (i dont know how to explain in english) texture to it. 

Chinese sausage is... chinese sausage. Steamed with water or cooked with rice. Cant screw it up Lol

Overall, despite the smaller portion than i had expected (left kind of unsatisfied and still lookin for food), it is probably the best you can get (for what i know) in vegas so far. Location may be kind of sketchy as you need to go kind of on a little detour to get to it off of Sahara if you are going east bound, as it sits on the west bound side without a way to turn in from Sahara.

1597640,2017-11-18,0,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Recommended by some friends and wasn't impressed. Ordered the #1 and their specialty dish is basically traditional Chinese ginger chicken. The rice was made of a chicken broth which made it quite tasty, but the chicken wasn't anything special. For $10 a plate, I'm expecting more than 6 pieces of chicken. Although the chicken was moist, my hubby and I each ordered the # 1. So for $20 we could've ordered an ENTIRE chicken at a chinese restaurant.

The description on the menu said ""pickles and mustard greens"" -- to think that we were getting a side of veggies was naive. They literally served a teaspoon amount of mustard greens and 3 slices of pickles. What a joke. 

I'm not one to complain about prices... but I added 1 egg, an order of chinese sausages, and 1 order of chicken skins - all of which was $2/item. My $10 dish became a $16 dish. 

The sausage was mediocre. The ones I get at the market is better than the ones served here. The sausage was cut extremely thin and was over cooked -- extra crispy. And the skins were bland and tasteless. Would not go back. 

The chicken wings were okay... We ordered half and half. One of which was a bit on the sweeter side and the other was a bit too spicy for me. 

The Bao was the best thing on the menu - but the sauce was drenched on the chicken making the bao too salty for me. 

The green milk tea was pretty good... but not amazing.

1831534,2017-02-16,1,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"It's all about the chicken. If you're planning to come here for the Hainan chicken and rice, like us and most people, the chicken itself is definitely more clean and less adulterated than the actually Hainan chicken. That also means less flavorful but more healthy. Their chicken is also free range so that's more healthy too. 

The chicken comes with three different sauces - ginger scallion, soy sauce, and spicy sauce. All three of them are good but I think the best sauce for the chicken is at the paying counter. It's a sweet soy sauce that appears to be cooked and reduced and comes in a squeeze bottle. That sauce is so good that it can make anything taste amazing. 

I thought the portion of chicken to rice was off. I guess this depends if your eat more rice or chicken. The ratio here was about one to one. I personally like more chicken and less rice. But it didn't matter because the rice was so good on its own. There is definitely chicken drippings or salted butter in it. 

I also ordered the chrysanthemum tea - cold and half sweet. Their teas are made from loose leaf and it's free refills! I like the customization and free refill of course! 

My only complaint was that the bathroom is located next door. My friend was directed to ring the doorbell next door and it actually caused more inconvenience as she had an awkward interaction with them.

I'll try the fried crispy skin next time for sure, I keep forgetting. The glazed wings are delicious as well and they offer different sauces from time to time.

The rice is good, the chicken well cooked, but it all falls a little flat.  The critic raved about ginger-scallion is passable to anyone who actually grew up with the stuff, as is the Chinese sausage, and there are better examples of both around town if you're willing to look.  It is nice to see chicken rice available in town but not so much so to justify going to that location.  The one standout thing is the de-boning of the chicken, it is a nice change of pace from the traditional presentation, especially if you're feeling lazy.

Oh, by the way, they don't have chopsticks, which makes for a very odd experience considering this is chopstick food.

We decided on the indo fried rice (special), hainese chicken, thai chicken wings, and the fried chicken rice plate. I really enjoyed the hainese chicken, as the chicken tasted really clean as other reviewers have noted. However, I do have to admit that I believe authentic hainese chicken should actually have that distinct chicken flavor, which this dish lacked (it only had the texture of chicken). Everything was okay as well, but the thai chicken wings were definitely over fried and was crunchy to the point where it was almost hard and difficult to swallow.

1935639,2016-10-11,0,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"My wife and I decided to try all 4 star restaurants or better in Vegas. Today, after reviewing this restaurant on Yelp, we decided to give it a try. 

This restaurant is located in an old strip mall on Sahara. But inside the restaurant, the décor is pleasant and clean. The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Good first impression. 

Their menu is simple and all items revolve around chicken. Hainam Chicken is a famous dish in South Eastern Asia. Unfortunately, few restaurants in North America has managed to do a good job - most restaurants try to cut corners and louse up the dish. The best Hainam Chicken Rice is offered in Singapore. 

We ordered item #1 - the traditional Chicken dish, i.e. Hainam Chicken rice and item #3 - Roast Chicken. 

Both chicken in the two ordered dishes were all fascinatingly well done. They are tender, moist, flavorful and juicy. Definitely a A+. No question about that. 

Each entre comes with Chicken Rice ( rice cooked in Chicken broth ) and with condiments offered. Portion is not large but quite sufficient for a regular eater. 

The Chicken Rice has room for improvement. On the outer side of the scoop of rice, they are a bit hard and tough and crusty -- left in the open a wee bit too long?? Flavor can be improved as well. The condiments and the cucumbers are very well done.

Add on items to the dishes are available, e.g. an organic fried egg, Chinese sausage and etc. 
We did not order any of them, but we saw some customers did that and indeed they looked delicious.

Were it not for the rice, this is a five star restaurant. But the rice takes it down to 4 star or 4 1/2 star. Still a very fine place to eat.

4/23/17 note:
I have since refused to visit this place due to the following incidents:

1. On 1/6/17 , I took a visiting party of friends ( total 7 ) to this place. Without any indication, I was charged an additional 15% for having a larger party. If the management can add charges indiscriminately, I can take my business elsewhere. 
2. On 12/24/16, day before Christmas, we went to this place and instead of plates, we ate from paper plates -- the management said they want to give the employees a break. At the expense of the customers??",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,2,0,4,4MO-evVk7EKJr8fDyl3xAQ

You're just slowing up the line and making us wait even longer for the dish. 

Hainanese Chicken definitely gets 5 stars - 6 stars even. They get a point off because service is excruciatingly S....L....O....W..... And the newbies (and those who don't know better) who have to be given a brief lesson on what the f*** chicken rice is, by the cashier - are not helping. 

Again - the only order should be Hainanese Chicken Rice. And no, you don't order it with chinese sausage, nor do you eat it with an egg. You shouldn't even order it with the fried chicken skin (although, admittedly, I do because I love fried chicken). 

For those lucky enough to have eaten this in Singapore (where it is considered the national dish) - you will find it laughable (or maybe not) that it takes this Vegas outpost 20-30 minutes to serve you the dish, where the standard hawker vendor/stall will whip it out in two minutes or less.

1988422,2017-06-29,0,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Five stars for the atmosphere, service, and novelty of the Hainan Chicken in Vegas. The chicken tasted very fresh. It doesn't have that industrial farm raised taste of mass produced chicken you get everywhere else. These guys know how to use ginger. I believe they serve it 2 ways maybe 3, with the hainan and through the sauce and pickles. It's not overpowering, but enough to make a presence. The atmosphere was very clean and home-y. The servers were very informative and soft natured to complement the atmosphere. For what it's known for, the price is reasonable. My food came out quicker than I expected.                                                     I think my biggest reservation is their use of plastic utensils. Even though the chicken was soft, It wasn't easy to cut through with plastic spoons or forks. Either they should provide plastic knives or switch to regular metal utensils. A piece of my chicken fell off the plate and onto the floor trying to cut a piece. Overall a great first time experience and would definitely comeback, maybe not every week but definitely once a month, when I get a fresh hainan craving.",86DiNIPEnOE4mLfp4TuD3g,0,0,5,NVGULEc9AEV8gi_0-osl0w

Unfortunately, when I visited they were out of rice- I'll have to return to try their Hainan chicken dish, but I was thoroughly impressed with the items I did try, and Jenny's top-notch, friendly service.

CHOPPED SALAD: Lettuce, kale, avocado, almonds, fried shallots, seasonal veg, and sesame vin. The dressing was light but flavorful, and the seasonal vegetables on this visit included red grapes and sweet plum tomatoes. It was a shockingly fresh and flavorful salad, and adding the fried chicken filet on top makes it a filling meal.
TWICE COOKED SICHUAN CHICKEN WINGS: Available by the half or full pound, these are damn delicious. Slightly sticky, sweetly sauced, with great flavor. Definitely a win for Sheridan Su! I'd say these are a must-get item.

I'll be back for their five-spice chicken bao and the Hainan chicken! Heads up that they close at 3:30PM, so this is exclusively a lunch spot.

I have been here a few times now and enjoyed the food both times. Services was good, friendly staff, water re-filled, dirty plates are picked up. This place is rather small, lucky we came in a little early today otherwise we would not have gotten a table. 

Tried the fried chicken bad and thought that was ok, nothing special. Just the bun, fried chicken, greens on top and sweet sauce. The fried rice was ok, tasted like curry rice, I really liked the soft boiled egg on top though. 

The Hainan Chicken rice...tastes good but small portion for the price. $10 is not bad but because Big Wong has the same rice for cheaper and tastes just as delicious, I prefer Big Wong. The portion here looks like its doll's food, the plate is huge but the little rice, few pieces of chicken, tiny little sauces, 4 pieces of tiny cucumber and the little veggies made it looked really comical. Rice is really tasty, chicken is soft smells amazing, the three sauces are nice. I like the food here, but nothing screamed special or would make me come back here specifically. 

For a small local place the add-ons are a bit ridiculous! Extra $1 for broth, $2 for everything else...their portion is quite small, if you want the add-ons it can add up quite a bit. 

I much prefer the Hainan Chicken rice at Big Wong, much cheaper, bigger portion, the sauces are better too. Presentation is not as nice since Big Wong is a simple place for food, but their chicken rice is better.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,1,3,8c_d_ZZzOFHs84yCd46nEw

I always order the #1 which is a poached chicken that comes with three different sauces. I order an extra fried egg as well. The sauces are so damn good.

The wings were pretty good but a little on the sweeter side then I would like. Maybe the ability to choose the level of spiciness will be great too since I could use more heat on the chicken wings.

Jenny was the only one working the front, so the service was a bit slow. It was expected, since we kinda went during the lunch rush. But she did make sure we were well taken care of.

I ordered the #1 Hainan Chicken Rice. All I can say is: It was DELISH! It comes with 3 sauces (ginger scallion, housemade soy, and chili sauce), rice, broth, a few slices of cucumbers, and some preserved mustard greens. The chicken looked a little dry, but when bitten into, was nice, tender, and juicy. I guess it was borderline of being a bit overcooked? I guess looks can be deceiving. =P I got mine with a sunnyside up egg. Mix in the egg yolk and some ginger scallion sauce into the rice and that in itself could've been a meal!

I also had an order of the fried chicken bao. Imo, it was pretty much a chicken finger bao. Nothing too special. The chicken was a bit dry though. I'll stick to ordering bao from Fat Choy instead. Lol.

Decor: nothing special about the decor. They have many menus posted on the wall. It's pretty clean and they keep it up well. But it's probably not hard to do since it's a small space to start with. 

Menu: love that they have organic/ grass fed chicken. You can definetely tell the difference between antibiotic chicken and grass fed ones. Their rice is seasoned well and I love the three spice/ sauces that comes with it. It's not as good as the original one in Singapore but it's acceptable. Price is a bit high.

The chicken was moist, perfectly poached, high-quality chicken that could stand alone without a single dip. The three dipping sauces, including sweet soy (my favorite), tasty ginger scallion, and a rockin' sambal greatly complimented the chicken. The broth...the often overlooked broth--was chock-full of flavor and the rice absorbed it all. Even the thinly sliced cucumber garnish was a treat. For $8.99 this lunch really scores. 

The chicken wings are meaty and the two-step fried and braised preparation resulted in a nicely glaze coating with the slightest kick. I am normally not a wing fan, but I'm a fan of these.

Jenny (the co-owner) is a service superstar...friendly, accurate, knowledgeable, and patient while Chef Su is, of course, outstanding.

I first came to Flock & Fowl right after they opened for their now famous Hainan Chicken Rice. This dish is famous for a reason...it's good. But I continue to introduce others to Flock & Fowl because so much of their menu is simply as good as it gets!

My favorite item at F&F is the Night Market Fried Chicken Bao. This appetizer chicken sandwich is the best chicken sandwich I have had. It is composed of five spice buttermilk fried chicken, kale pea sprout sesame slaw, and a steamed bun. I recommend adding a fried quail egg...but then again, I never turn down the opportunity for a euphoric burst of egg yolk--flocking delicious! You need a few to fill up if you aren't enjoying other items. I don't do a lot of fried food, so I normally order one and fill up in other ways.

Honey Siracha & Thai Carmel Chicken Wings with Crispy Garlic! If I'm here with someone for the first time then we must share some chicken wings! I suggest splitting an 8 piece order with both flavors if you are having them for the fist time. Again, these are the best in town. Most of us enjoy sweet and tangy flavors at the same time...restaurants and lines of food exist on this concept...F&F's wings are an excellent example of sweet and tangy flavors coming together. As you bite in, your lips are inundated with their gooey exterior as your teeth crunch through the exterior to moist chicken below--perfectly amazing!

When my love and I come in to F&F we normally would eat a Night Market Fried Chicken Bao each and then share the Flock & Fowl Salad. For $10.99 the salad comes with your choice of Roasted Spring Chicken, Buttermilk Fried Chicken Tenders, or Poached Chicken...or you can just do the salad consisting of lettuces, kale, avocado, almonds, seasonal vegetable & fruits, with a sesame vin dressing for $7.99. This is one of the more robust and flavorful salads I know of. The seasonal fruits and vegetables are amazing, often propelling this salad into as good as gets Territory for me. Since I usually have a fried chicken bao with the salad I do the salad only option, but the Roasted Spring Chicken is delicious if you want chicken with it. 

Oh yeah, and what about the famous Hainan Chicken Rice...if you grew up with this style of chicken then you need to check out F&F. So many of my friends that like this dish say that F&F is the best or one of the best versions of this dish that they have enjoyed.

Regardless of whether you're enjoying Hainan Chicken Rice, Night Market Fried Chicken Bao, Chicken Wings, or Flock & Fowl Salad, the good people at Flock & Fowl decided to put the Buddha's thoughts to practice in the form of chicken.

Everything I tasted lacked flavor except for the broth.  The texture of the poached chicken was more ""rough"" than I would have liked and the Chinese sausage was just OK.  The flavored rice tasted very plain to me even with a splash of the Cantonese soy sauce.  Speaking of sauces, only the spicy sauce was enjoyable as the ginger sauce just didn't pack enough flavor for my liking.

All of this summed up to a mediocre meal that was quite pricey, $15 for my order, located off strip.  The staff were very nice and attentive and based on the other reviews, they may have just had an off day in the kitchen.",6XLyyv-hQ6TQmu6Rtt49yA,1,0,3,3WV9SJNYnokXoOO9QChTlw

Even though the wildly popular Savoy is just a 5 minute drive from me, I have only been there twice in all the years I've known of its success. (For you Las Vegans, I'm referring to a place in Alhambra, CA.) Since I was not impressed with their Hainan Chicken the first time, I thought I try it again given the 2k+ reviews. Second time around, I was still not impress by the dry so called Hainan Chicken.


ONTO THE REVIEW

I came in with low expectations; I've had my Hainan Chicken heart broken before. 

Like other have said, the restaurant is located in your not so typical plaza. But can't complain since there are plenty of free parking. The restaurant is small but cute, very modern and definitely a minimalist feel to it.

When you first walk in be sure to place your order. If you're dining in, the cashier (who also serves as waitress) will let you know which table you can take. If you're ordering to go, there are seats along the wall.

This is not a fast food joint, so expect a bit of a wait before your meal is brought out. 

We ordered:  

-Hainanese Chicken Rice w/Chinese Sausage and Chicken Broth: 
The best Hainan Chicken I have ever tasted! The chicken is moist and flavorful! Pair it with the ginger and soy, perfection! The Chinese Sausage was just ok, wouldn't get again. Didn't enhance the dish further. And I can definitely pass on the broth (a bit too bland for my liking).

-Hainan Fried Chicken Rice w/Chinese Sausage and Chicken Broth:
Decided to get this dish so that we can sample other things on their menu. Like another Yelper had said: skip this. I have to agree. Nothing really exciting about. I enjoyed the dipping sauce that was specifically for this fried chicken, but you're better off getting their Hainanese Chicken Rice.

2596157,2016-05-06,3,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"The Hainan chicken hit very close to home. The free range chicken and home made sauces reminded me a lot of my mother's cooking. The chicken was very tender and moist. The ginger and scallion sauce was my favorite, although it could've been a tad bit more gingery in my opinion. We ordered the fried chicken tender and poached Hainan chicken plates with Chinese sausage and broth as sides. The sausage was a bit overcooked and the broth was a bit bland. The rice, however, was very good. It seemed like a mix between white and brown rice. I think it is cooked in chicken broth but you may want to double check with Jenny or Liz on that. Jenny and Liz were super sweet and checked up on us often. Napkins, moist towelettes, and our water cups were always replaced when dirty or empty. We also ordered eight chicken wings, 4 honey sriracha and 4 Thai wings. Both were very tasty and flavorful. They do come out boiling hot so watch your fingertips when you decide to dig right in.

The only downside is that this restaurant does not have a restroom. If you really really need to go, you can go to the restroom at the cigar store a couple stores down (as Jenny recommended). Only downside is that you will come back reeking of smoke. Oh and you'll also be eyed down by the hoard of guys smoking in there if you're only one girl. I did this and I spent the whole time sniffing myself rather than enjoying my meal. Next time, I'll try the restroom at Capriottis. 

The portions are smaller than what I'm used to when it comes to Asian food and a bit overpriced. A Hainan chicken plate is $9-$10. The broth is an additional 99cents and a side of Chinese sausage is $1.99. A side of 8 wings is around $9-$10 so it does add up!",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,5,3,4,1N94sUcwKOD2gorlvk0FHA

As others have noted: this dish is poached and served with the skin on; I don't eat skin, but my dining partner was more than happy to take it off my hands. We added an a la carte organic egg which was a great call; it was exquisite in its simplicity, and though I'm not a huge rice fan, theirs was delicious as was both the house made pickles and accompanying sauces. 

The fried chicken ""Bao Chicka Bao Bao"" was off the hook delicious! Moist chicken, crispy coating, crunchy kale slaw, a fluffy bun = this is what fried chicken should be. It is a 'chicken sandwich' for those who care about the quality of the food they eat, rather than the $1 menu, or an inexplicable devotion to fast 'food' chicken. 

If ever you thought that organic produce and protein was a waste: just tasting the difference in the quality of Mary's Free Range fowl, and aforementioned egg will make a believer out of skeptics.

Service was warm, welcoming, and informative, very helpful overall. We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Rice, Crab-Chicken-Kimchi Fried Rice, and a bao, all of which were solid dishes. 

The chicken is nothing crazy; the dish highlights the meat without much spice. Nice breading, cooked well, fresh-tasting meat. The sauces make it great, plating's nice as well. Garlic, chili, and scallion sauces, my favorite was scallion. Not too oily. If you like fried chicken, with a light, crispy breading and juicy interior, accentuated by great sauces, this is the item for you.

The bao was awesome; it was a traditional soft bao bun with a buttermilk tender, some greens, and sweet sauce. I preferred the bao to the tenders alone. 

My favorite was the fried rice, but if I went again, I would not order it. The dish was entirely without crab, with three or four small pieces of chicken, despite being $12.99. Tons of kimchi. I enjoyed it, and won't hold it against them for the strange meat proportions, as I hurried them and asked for it to go last-minute.

The shiny and luxurious hotels are filled with eateries by world-class chefs and restauranteurs. A few hotels boast delicious buffets that are the selling points for many tourists who stop by.

We actually decided to venture off the strip to try out a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant called Flock & Fowl. Typically we try to take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt, but this place definitely earned every one of its stars and rave reviews.

From our hotel on the strip, we hopped in an Uber and arrived in under 10 minutes at a tiny strip of stores. Nestled next to a costume shop and theme wedding specialty store, Flock & Fowl is quite the hidden gem.

Online reviews tout its authentic Hainanese style eats and delicious free-range chicken. Asian food and chicken? Check and check.

We walked into the small restaurant that could probably seat close to 30 people at the most. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the staff with a ""Welcome!"" and huge smile. ""Have you been to Flock & Fowl before?""

The staff up front gave us a detailed breakdown of how their menu worked, explained what food items were specialties, and pointed out customer favorites. Each member of their staff that spoke to us was super friendly AND helpful in a way that made us feel like they really cared about sharing their love for the food they made with us. 

Our meal started with an appetizer of wings, thai caramel chicken wings with crispy garlic to be exact. They were some of the best pieces of fried chicken I've had in my lifetime. They reminded me a little of Korean fried chicken wings - the perfect balance of sweet, salty, crispy and juicy. My mouth is legit still watering thinking about these guys.

Our main courses came shortly after. Roasted Spring Chicken for me and Buttermilk Fried Chicken Tenders for him. Everything on the plate was a 10/10, from the chicken to the pickled vegetables to the rice to the sauces.   

Flocking delicious? I'd say so.

Also, the place is difficult to get to since it is next the I15 freeway on Sahara and you can only get in one way but I get it, the rent is cheaper.

I was a  bit hesitant to only have poached chicken, but lucky for us all, they serve some well done fried chicken skin here as well.

2940475,2016-07-19,1,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"I am not giving this a Four/Five star because the Singaporean Chicken and Rice did not impress me but maybe this is because I am comparing it to the one I had in the street stalls of Bangkok (Street stalls in RCA). I gave them a try because not many places in the States even serve this dish especially here in Iowa. I thought the rice needed a little more flavor and the sauces need more spice and flavor. I also tried the Thai wings, it was just A-OK. I thought it was too sweet for my liking. This is a small place so get there early before the big rush. All in all I would still recommend this place if you haven't had Singaporean chicken and rice before. But if you had one from Thailand, than you might be kind of disappointed.

Food - 3/5  It was okay nothing to really rave about here.

They offer three main items on the menu, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Caramel Chicken Wings, and Night Market Bao Buns which is what I went with and they were amazing. Perfectly fried, super juicy, and the breading was something that would make the Colonel second guess his career choice. I honestly wanted to eat about three more these things, but decided not get Bao Bun wasted. 

The side of the rice and egg was the perfect addition to the meal, the rice was just a tad on the sticky side, which I love, and the egg made for the perfect topping.

Ordered the Fried Chicken Baos. They were as good as they look. We ended up ordering more after we were done eating. 

Also got the poached chicken with rice. Added an egg, fried chicken skins, and broth. Sooo good. The chicken does come luke warm based on how it's prepared.

The chicken is silky smooth, moist.  Rice is fragrant with chicken essence.  I love pouring some of the rich broth over and the sauces are ridiculously good.   Love the ginger scallion and the chili packs a punch but you can then pair it with the sweet soy.

3083844,2016-02-18,1,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"What an amazing place that is literally a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd.  

Where to start?  

First, the food:

The artisanal care and love to their Hainanese Chicken Rice is apparent from their house made sauces that accompany the dish to the use of organic chicken sourced from San Joaquin Valley (and cooked to perfection, juicy, tender and flavorful), to the chicken rice that is seasoned well and balanced.   

The Thai Caramel chicken wings were amazing - lemon, ginger, garlic with sweetness from the honey , along with a crispy crunchiness.  In San Francisco there is a restaurant that serves generally mediocre food yet has long lines and less than desirable service day in and day out because of its chicken wings.  Flock and Fowl wins out hands down. 

Second, the service:  

Most small places have a great signature dish but lack service.   Here it's sort of an hybrid.  You sit down, decide what you order and go to the counter area to place your order and pay by cash or credit (via their Clover POS).  The food and beverages are otherwise served as expected at table service restaurants.

But what sets Flock and Fowl apart, elevating it to the top is what I witnessed during the 55 minutes I was their.   Jenny the front of the house knew the names of many of the customers that came to eat as well as what they normally order and their preferences.  This wasn't just one customer but at least 5 customers. This demonstrates a commitment to not only food but to providing great customer service.

If only there was something like Flock and Fowl in the Bay Area (Peninsula), I would dine regularly.

I'm horrible for not remembering her name, but they have an employee that is one of the most charming servers I have ever encountered. My first time at the restaurant she told me about all about the food, where it came from, etc. Every time I eat she gives me a rundown of my meal and I will never get tired of her describing the final component of the perfect rice: ""Lots of love.""

Hainanese chicken rice is one of my favorite things to eat. EVER! It's a dish I grew up on Thailand, and to this day reminds me of being there. Yes it is more associated with Singapore than Thailand, but trust me there's many versions of it all over Southeast Asia. In Thai we call it khao mun gai, which literally translates to oily rice chicken. It's not commonly found in Thai restaurants, and when it is, it's not usually great. The chicken rice at F&F is pretty great. Chef Sheridan Su has perfected the rice! There are several options for the chicken- Traditional steamed/boiled chicken is what I prefer and most commonly served for this dish. He also offers fried chicken in the form of chicken strips, and roasted chicken which is served bone in. 

I have tried all three and I enjoy all of them. I still prefer the traditional number one the most. And I definitely recommend adding an egg.

Upon my visit on a weekday for lunch, we were notified the restaurant was only serving one thing, which was the popular favorite Hainanese chicken rice.

We requested two orders of the chicken rice dish...and had waited a looonnng time for our food. Overall, the food wasn't bad...I personally feel this place is overhyped.  Yes, the chicken was juicy and flavorful.  There were various dipping sauces (spicy and savory) and the dish came with a bed of rice, sausage and an egg. 

What I found weird was that for a sit down restaurant....everything was served in plastic--our water cups, the takeout container our food came in, the utensils. I guess in retrospect, it all makes sense now if they had issues with the health dept which we were unaware of at the time. 

In the end, the bill came out to be almost $40 after tax and tip. For the mediocre experience, I felt the price was too steep and could've been better spent somewhere else.

3218112,2016-04-06,1,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Perhaps the best chicken rice I've had outside of Singapore?

The rice itself was fragrant and perfectly seasoned, accompanied with a pinch of pickles.  Only issue I had with F&F's star dish?  The broth should be part and parcel of classic Hainanese chicken rice - even if it's a perfunctory shot or teacup size - not some janky $1 surcharge...

The other dishes we tried were quite good - the chef's special duo of toast (pate with jalapeno jelly, duck confit with quail egg), buttermilk chicken tender bao, and the house salad.

I have yet to try the poached Hainam chicken (they were sold out), but so far, I've had the roasted spring chicken, the Thai caramel chicken wings, the fried chicken baos, and the salad with the buttermilk fried chicken. 

Roasted spring chicken- roasted to perfection. Skin was super crispy, but the chicken was moist, tender, and full of flavor. It comes with 3 sauces (a soy sauce base, chili sauce, and a ginger/scallion sauce) to really enhance its flavor. The chicken rice that came with the roasted chicken was really tasty as well. 

Thai caramel chicken wings- a little bit fishy (maybe used too much fish sauce), but the garlic chips added a nice touch of flavor to it. I definitely want to try the Sriracha honey wings next time. 

Fried chicken baos- loved the baos at fat choy, and the baos are renewed here at Flock and Fowl, with its own twist. The contrast between the crunchy and crispy buttermilk fried chicken and the softness of the steamed bun is created to perfect. 

Salad with buttermilk fried chicken- I ordered this mainly to have some greens in the meal lol, but I enjoyed the sesame vinaigrette dressing on the salad. The salad portion is also very generous.

The chicken was very authentic and had nice texture and flavor.  I had the salad which turned out to be much bigger than expected (i.e. 2 meals).  Given the size, $10 is a great deal for the quality.  The salad itself matched any other restaurant in town as it came with fresh fruit, nuts, and varieties of salad inside.

The place seems like it could get crowded during lunch and tables may be tough to find.  I got there around 1pm and there was a few group wait to be seated.

Flock and Fowl opened recently and I found it while looking thru my Yelp thread of notifications. It is located in a small and old shopping center near the SLS and the I-15.

The place is small with a handful of tables. You place your order at the counter and then grab a table. The menu is small with a few dishes that the chef specializes in. We ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and the Fried Cornish Hen with Rice.  We also got a cup of chicken soup for 25 cents.  The meal came out to around $25 with tax and tip.  The meal came out pretty quickly, which gave you enough time to grab a table, enjoy some water or any other drink you ordered, and to enjoy the cute and minimalistic decor.  For the food, the Hainan chicken rice was decent. The rice was pretty good; it was cooked with chicken broth so it was moist and pretty flavorful. The chicken was not dry and you get a pretty good portion.  It also comes with some pickled veges and also some salted veges.  Finally it comes with a combination of sauces (soy, chili, and ginger oil).  The dish was OK. Nothing too amazing but also nothing to really dock it for.  It just felt average. The Cornish hen was a half fried bird with the same accompaniments as the Hainan chicken (except for the sauces).  Instead you get a spice and salt mixture with a slice of lemon to sprinkle and squeeze on your hen.  Compared to the other cornish hen dishes I've had with red rice, this dish was also just average. The hen was not dry nor overly oily but it also lacked the savory finger licking flavor I was expecting. Same goes for the chicken broth. It wasn't needed and it lacked flavor that could elevate the meal.

Overall, the meal was average.  Your taste buds will be satisfied but they won't be wanting chicken over and over again.  The service was good and you see the effort the owners put into the food but the food is still just average.  Hopefully the chef does a bit more research to perfect the flavor because it seems to be almost there but still missing that special something.

The store hours are short so check before you decide to head on over. Also, no restrooms so don't come with a full bladder unless you want to go find a restroom at a store next door.",Vi_qBZBXgkNbsO1qXXkoVw,3,3,3,drOUidDenp5TcwQHlSf3OA

I tried the Night Market Fried Chicken Bao with a quail egg, Hainan Chicken Rice, and side of chicken broth. The bao here makes for a bangin Instagram, but leaves much to be desired. The description is ""5 spice buttermilk chicken,"" but honestly really had no flavor. Also my fault for getting fried food to go, but the outside of chicken got soggy from being steamed inside the to go box. While the outside got soggy, the inside was still dry. The quail egg on top was perfectly cooked, but the star should've been the chicken. 

The Hainan chicken rice was okay. Not bad, but not amazing. For $9.99, it's decently priced. Honestly not much to talk about here. Chicken broth rice really had no flavor though. 

I did not like the chicken broth at all. It was super salty and had a bunch of chicken fat in them ): 

I will say that the staff here is stellar. They have really weird hours and close at 3:30pm, which I was not expecting. My coworkers and I were working an event at LV Convention Center and called in at 3:25pm and the guy who answered the phone was super nice and said it was totally fine to place an order. I showed up around 3:50pm and got the food with no issue. Maybe the food wasn't super because I came in right before closing?

Hainan Chicken w/ chinese sausage ($8.99, +$2 for chinese sausage, +$0.25 for broth): This was an excellent dish.  You can tell they chose quality ingredients because everything tastes very clean. Since when can you say chinese food tastes ""clean""?  It's a very refreshing dish and contained the perfect amount of food.  I particularly enjoyed the garlic sauce, though it may be too spicy for some.  For those from the 626, the garlic sauce is very similar to Litz... which is one of my favorite restaurants.  They also have Sweet Soy sauce, so ask for that if your taste buds need something sweet to go with the spicy.

The exterior is not that glamorous and it was actually a little tricky locating the shop since you have to approach it from a certain side of the street.

The interior is quite lovely, though on the small side. It reminded me of a coffee shop, even though it serves Chinese/Singaporean food. They only sell a few items, so a quick browse at the menu and you'll be good to go. You order at the counter so there is no waiter/waitress service.

I ended up getting the standard Hainanese Chicken Rice (you pick from four different chicken preparations, and I chose #1 - poached). I was intrigued by the bao so ordered one on the side. I also added the vegetable of the day (bok choy) to my chicken meal. I ended up getting my meal to-go due to limited time.

The food is a little pricey for what you get, but it was definitely very tasty! Given the atmosphere and the food itself, I'd probably consider this more of a fusion restaurant; nevertheless, it's certainly worth a try!

Hainan chicken - tender and flavorful. Not as authentic as those in the SGV but pretty comparable. Rice was cooked perfectly and they give you both light and dark meat. Sauces were exactly what they were supposed to be... gingery and savory. 

Fried chicken bao - perfectly fried chicken with just the right amount of sauce. This was just pillowy goodness all around!

Sriracha honey wings - most places do this wrong...  the sourness of the sriracha is overpowering. This was perfectly balanced.. sweet spicy with a bit of tang and not overly fried chicken

Fork-tender meat and bold flavors can be attributed to a broth crafted with precision and cared for with passion to create the best chicken dish in town. A touch of sauce on the rice provided sweet, intense flavors and three more house-made sauces accompany the dish for your dipping pleasure.

While that dish is my favorite on their small menu, the chicken bao is also exceptional and their buttermilk fried chicken tenders put all others to shame.

I love the choice of complementary sauces/condiments - finely minced garlic/onion, soy sauce, and a spicy orange sauce. So each piece you take a bite of, you can pare with a different flavor. The Indo Fried Rice was also very good and tasty with good flavor. For me, the Fried Chicken Bao was on the dry side, we ordered a couple to try, but could've done without. The Hainan Chicken Rice and Indo Fried Rice are worth coming for. Will be back again to try some of the other dishes. Service was also excellent. We were a party of 6, and they did the best to keep a look out on who was wrapping up and try to group us together, and it worked out that we were able to combine a few tables and sit as a group.

The poached hainan chicken is to die for. And yes get the broth for an extra 99 cents. And get the egg for the extra 1.99. The chicken is soft, not greasy, and just melts in your mouth. The rice it comes with is just so perfect! Al dente and lightly flavored. My favorite part was mixing the left over rice in the broth and adding a few of the sauces. 

Baos: they make Em fresh and piping hot. I wish the sauce was a bit sweeter (like hoisin sauce) it was really salty and lacked any umami flavor. They also use organic sprouts and the buns are soft and fluffy

Lastly, get the mango saffron sago! Perfectly sweetened with just the right amount of sugar, yummy chia seeds and a good amount of fruit.

The Hainan came out to be below standard as well. The chicken was gummy and tasteless. It seems like they took a chicken and boiled it in water. I have had better hainan chicken rice in Chinatown. 
Paul is great though. He comped the dish and is very nice about it. 
I won't come back for the food but their service is great. Paul is an asset to the business.

Jenny, in response to your comment, I had a bite and I couldn't eat it. It's a different case if I ate the whole two dishes and asked to be comped. 98% of the food is still the in the plate. So why would I pay for something that I couldn't eat? Don't send your waiter around and asked to switch out dishes or comp dishes if you don't believe in customer service or doing it.

Ok, the place is very small inside so we had to wait for others to be done before we could be seated. The guy said oh it goes by fast. They have your name on the list, ok well then they decided to seat the guy that ordered after us. Then, after we were already waiting for 20 minutes, a large group of 7 walked in. They then also seated the large group before us and pushed together three small tables. 

By the time we finally got to sit down, they have served the guy after us, a to go order, and almost all of the seven people sitting in the large group. Oh also my husband ordered a Vietnamese coffee that he didn't get because they said they were brewing more. Well, when it was done they gave three other people who ordered after us theirs first. 

So my food came out first, husband was still waiting and now pretty much everyone that came after us has food. I ask what is going on and they tell me they are short. Ok, but why does everyone else have their food but us? Even another family of four after the party of seven was getting their food before my husband had his. What. 

We were there for an hour from the time of order to getting food finally. 

The food was ok. Nothing special that was like ohhh this is so worth the wait! Nope, plus the portion was tiny. 

I can see where people like this place and the dishes look good and interesting and what we had was good but this experience was just horrible and I regret going there. I've never been skipped over that much at any place ever and had that many people that ordered after me get food before I got anything at all. It wasn't like we ordered anything special or different from what the others got either. I didn't understand and it was super frustrating. It wasn't a matter of an extra 15 minutes either. This was a whole hour! 

I'm not from around here so I won't have the chance to give it another shot but after this I don't think I would risk wasting another hour of my time to be skipped over again.",ocY6psWZGQQkG8vuB3GiHg,4,0,2,D_Qp_hXJH21x13Qh1siutg

Read an article on Eater so I drove to the strip on Wednesday 16 September.

If you have a skeptical SO who does not believe in the magic of ""just boiled chicken and rice"", bring him/her to Flock & Fowl. The dish will speak for itself. 

Everything was done right - from how the chicken was poached, to the jelly under the smooth slippery skin, to the evenly chopped pieces of chicken, to the flavorful oily rice, to the chili and soy sauce condiments that tasted like they were straight from a hawker stall or kopitiam in SEA.

The restaurant itself was small and cute, and service was wonderful, and the other items on the menu looked delicious as they were being delivered to other tables.

3877291,2017-06-21,2,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"As much as I love Flock & Fowl and tout it as the best place in Las Vegas to get Hainan chicken rice, during my last couple of visits, the quality and service has dropped off quite a bit. Located near the north end of The Strip, it borders the abandoned Rock in Rio festival grounds, the strip clubs, and the new Lucky Dragon casino. It's not the most ideal spot, but it does play as the perfect hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The space itself is pretty small and only fits roughly 20 seats. When they first opened, they used to take orders at the tables, but now they have transitioned to pay and sit (although when it gets busy, you can put your name down on a waitlist). 

The menu is kept simple, which is a good thing. The specialty is Hainanese chicken rice prepared three different ways. The #1 (the best and only way) is the classically poached, quarter free-range chicken. Everything is deboned and cooked to perfection. It parallels the quality of the chicken you would get from Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra, CA. The other options are the #2 buttermilk fried chicken tenders and the #3 roasted spring chicken. All plates are beautifully plated with house ginger scallion, chili, or soy sauce with chicken rice, marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens. Add-on sides include a 63 degree egg, Chinese sausage, buttermilk fried chicken skin, or chicken broth. The other well-known menu item is the fried chicken bao. It's basically a piece of the buttermilk fried chicken tender with a kale pea sprout sesame slaw wrapped in a steamed bun. Although usually a favorite, I found the chicken to be very dry and lackluster during my most recent visit.

The service is really hit or miss here. I've found the servers to get very flustered when it gets packed and things are amiss from our order including long wait times. The other annoying thing are the odd hours of 10:30 am to 3:30 pm making for a very limited lunch service. When it does get busy, the line goes out the door, which makes for a very uncomfortable wait when it's in the middle of the sweltering summer heat. All in all, when I'm craving chicken, I come here.

3939560,2017-04-23,10,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"So this review is a little bit lengthy because it is both a review of the restaurant and a review of the owner.

I've grown up eating Hainan chicken rice. I'm from LA and literally spent my teenage years living off Savoy Hainan chicken rice. It's one of my favorite things to eat. I've been to the most well known places and some hole in the walls all over the world. So obviously, this is a comparison to all my other experiences.

3 stars for the food. Have come in a few times and sometimes the chicken and rice is great and sometimes it's dry. When it's great, it's 4 stars. The chicken and the rice do not have as fragrant a taste as other places I like, but the chicken can be very tender sometimes. (I'll say the same thing about the buttermilk fried chicken- tender but not flavorful). When it's not good, it's just...dry and tasteless and tough and then you have to grin and bear it because you just paid $10 for a 1/4 chicken and a little bit of rice. 

Which leads to a minor second point. It's not cheap. I don't eat a lot, but just getting the Hainan chicken rice is not particularly satisfying. It doesn't feel like I'm getting a good deal for my small lunch that will put me $10+ after all is said and done.

OK. Moving on. The place is small and not super comfortable. Which leads to a third point. I have no idea what kind of business model this place has. The owner keeps saying she's trying to change the perception of Chinese food/chicken rice and justify a higher price point. Well, opening up a shack in a kindof crummy end of the strip with no toilet will not do that. The inside is kindof cute. But it's weird because...again, it is cute but inside a small joint in a crummy area at the end of the strip with no toilet. She mentions take out business being a big part of her business. At which point I want to know why she doesn't just run a straight up take out restaurant and charge a couple bucks less? I don't know if she wants to run a nice restaurant or a take out restaurant and I don't think she knows either. I'm not saying you can't do both, but I'm saying you have to have a point of view and she doesn't. $10 for a take out meal that is literally no frills chicken and rice feels like I should just go to Chick Fil A. Also, I think this place should realize that setting, ambiance, and service actually play a big role in why people spend the money they spend. It's not just the food. $15- $20 at an Italian restaurant tends to get you some bread, a nice place to sit, nice wait staff. $10 at a Chinese restaurant tends to get you a table and some tea thrown at you. I'm Chinese. I appreciate my people's efficiency. But I'm just saying, the extra $$ goes into a lot of things outside food.

And all this leads to the owner. I hope some of you have read her yelp responses and realize she is not a...pleasant person. She doesn't smile. And before you accuse me of demanding women to smile, I don't. I'm a woman and I just like it when SERVICE PEOPLE smile at me. Even just to welcome me in. Because they are in the SERVICE industry. Honestly, I just assumed she was a really serious person because we sometimes would make jokes with her and she would just stare at us like we were wasting her time. But then I read her yelp responses and it's bananas. Because I realized she actually isn't just serious, she's obnoxiously defensive. Someone says they can make better chicken rice at home and she replies ""let me know when you open up your own restaurant then."" Who says that!? Oh, I guess she does. I mean, the point of eating out is so you DON'T have to do things yourself. This is how our actual economy works. You provide a service at a price we think is less than the cost of our time. If that doesn't happen, we feel like we've been had! I bet if I complained about the quality of my J Crew shirt, she'd tell me to go buy some sheep and a loom to make my own shirt. And someone complains about price v. portion size and she says everyone else charges the same or more. Which is really just a lack of understanding on economic principles. You were judged, by the market, to have a subpar product compared to your competition. Your response is not ""everyone else does it"" when your everyone else offers something more - bigger portions, better quality, or you know, a smile. Your response doesn't actually have to be anything. But it's certainly not that. 

If the recent United incident has taught any business anything it's that the customer is always right but this owner seems intent on following Oscar Munoz's initial response and stubbornly refuse to acknowledge any criticism. 

And finally, I just want to be petty and point out that she claims to be one of the FEW Hainan chicken rice places in AMERICA. I've been to many many places across America. This place can be good, but it's nowhere near the best and it's certainly not one of the few.",yZVoXTvybz0LMItl0bRzxA,11,6,2,qV1dGW7osv4Y3K15VxFQBw

3973270,2015-11-01,15,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"I have been to Chef Sheridan Su's Fat Choy restaurant in the Eureka Casino and I was intrigued when I learned that he opened a new place with a very limited menu of Hainan chicken and four other items.

Six of us decided to meet for lunch yesterday and it would give me the chance to try the Hainan chicken about which I've read so much.

We were served everything on the menu.  As it only contains 5 things plus a few à la carte items, everything was enough and very good.

We started with fried chicken bao with kale pea sprout slaw.  The chicken was excellent, breaded just right, and with the slaw and the soft bao, it made one great sandwich.

Next came two orders of chicken wings--one of Thai caramel and one called Mystery wings which are Szechuan style wings.  I had one of each.  I liked the Szechuan wings better but I'm not a chicken wing fan.  Generally when I order wings, I get boneless wings which aren't wings at all.  It's the messy fingers syndrome I don't like.

Then we were served a Flock & Fowl salad with Cornish game hen pieces.  I had some salad but I didn't try the hen.  

Last, we were brought two dishes--one with the Hainan poached chicken for which this place has become known and one with fried chicken tenders and rice.  Both dishes come with three sauces, ginger scallion, house made chile, and house made soy.  Both dishes come with rice and marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens.  The Hainan chicken comes with a cup of broth.  These dishes are excellent!!  The Hainan chicken is moist and delightfully boneless and the dipping sauces add to the taste of the chicken.  The tenders are excellent!

This is a must return to place.  The bao, the tenders, and the Hainan chicken are all worthy of having again!  

A couple of tips:  this is a lunch only restaurant open from 10:30-3:30.  It's a small place seating just 16 people so you may have a wait.  This is in a small strip mall on West Sahara near the freeway on the north side of Sahara.

I love Fat Choy (although don't get there as often as I'd like), so when I saw Chef Su was opening a new joint, I figured it was a must go. But that was months (or even years) ago....the hours and the location were just not that convenient for me, so I FINALLY made it over to Flock & Fowl this week.

We got to try the signature poached chicken and rice, both flavors of wings, and the fried chicken bao (what fatties!). The bao was excellent, as expected. I enjoyed both flavors of wings, but really loved the caramel ones. Probably would have eaten more than a couple. The poached chicken is.....boiled chicken. I mean, they make it well, so that it's juicy and all, but I'm not sure how good poached chicken can get. The chicken does come with rice (very chicken-y tasting!), some condiments, and 3 dipping sauces. I enjoyed the soy-like sauce, and the mild sriracha-like sauce, but found the ginger sauce just bland and oily. 
Prices are about $10 per plate, and the service was extremely friendly and helpful.
Overall, I'll definitely return if I'm in the area, but considering the location and hours, I won't seek it out. I will recommend it for lunch to anybody staying or working in the area.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,0,4,dqJcd5WDWa-O1pByH3Q-1w

The chicken was soo tender and juicy and went SUPER well with that spicy house sauce. We were actually really excited to order the fried chicken baos (basically the main reason we came here) and boyyyyyyy am I glad we did! We really wanted to come back for another order of those baos but we had such little time :(

The chef seemed super nice as he came out a few times to greet his regulars and we were only there for an hour or less sooo he's a pretty popular guy I'd say.

RULES: Order first then sit, or wait to be seated. It is a small mom/pop restaurant so be patient for their awesome foood! We waited only a few minutes but found it surprising to be full at 2:30PM.

We were here for a long wedding weekend and some of us stepped out to eat here one night based on the recommendation of someone staying in our hotel. Man, it didn't disappoint. I ordered a dish called Hainan Chicken, it was really good, very hearty. Portions were average sized, not out of this world large, but it's Vegas and it was not expensive, so who really cares. Just the perfect blend of seasonings, everything was good, even the sides. The rice was pretty good, maybe a bit standard, but good nonetheless. This restaurant is small, only a few tables, so it might be too tight for some people's tastes, but I was cool with the intimacy of the place and the tastiness of my meal.

4108233,2016-06-17,5,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Remember when I wasn't willing to give five stars for the food? Now I am.

Flock & Fowl continues to serve awesome chicken-centric food inspired by Chinese and other cuisines. Although they've not yet expanded their evening-less Tuesday-Saturday hours, they're still worth visiting for fantastic food and typically great service. And they are not afraid to experiment and offer new creations from their kitchen.

The Indo fried rice ($12.99) is one of my new favorites of anything food-wise. It started as a popular special and appears to have been promoted to regular menu status. Having never tried nasi goreng, I can't speak to the authenticity of this particular preparation. but I can vouch steadfastly for its huge flavors. The dish is supposed to be a soy sauce-based fried rice, which certainly explains the dark color and awesome umami in every single bite of Indo fried rice. The meat portion is pretty generous too, and it comes in the forms of chicken, Chinese sausage, and bacon. If that's not enough, there's even more richness from the 63 degree egg, aka perfectly poached yolk and white. You should plan to take home leftovers or share it with a friend because it's so heavy - but in the best way.

They may have reneged a little on the Half Sweet & Half Spicy chicken wing combo ($9.49 for 8 wings) since my prior visit, but I'm sure they'll entertain a request for it if they're not too busy. That order allowed me to enjoy equal amounts of their terrific Thai Caramel wings (about which I've already waxed poetic in my first review) and their newer Honey Butter Sriracha wings. The Sriracha tastes like it came out of a bottle, and I say that as a huge compliment as a fan of this sweet and spicy chili sauce. The honey butter lends richness and sweetness that balances out the heat. Another must-try.

Having paid attention to social media this week, I just made a visit today to try two new (or new-to-me) specials. The newly debuted Banh Mi Nachos ($7.99) are a surprising contender for best banh mi in a very lackluster town (note: still gotta try a few newer spots) despite lacking the namesake bread. There's plenty of starch and crunch from the housemade potato chips though, and the chicken liver pate mousse, avocado mayo, pickled carrot and daikon, cilantro, and Fresno pepper provide most if not all of the expected flavors.

The Toast Duo ($7.99) was my other choice, and Chef Sheridan mentioned on Instagram that it's an old special that's now back. Portion/price considerations aside, I'm not sure why it went away. One piece of the crunchy toast is topped with smoked duck that's a successful play on smoked ham, hard-boiled egg, and smashed avocado. The other piece has a healthy dollop of that silky chicken liver mousse, a sweet orange marmalade that plays very well off the mousse, and almond slivers. I slightly preferred the pate mousse, but both are must-try options if you see them offered on the menu

I've tried other foods in my return visits. They occasionally offer a Congee special that's a classic rice porridge plus 63 degree egg with chicken done multiple ways (fried and Hainan I believe were two of them). Their Katsu Sando ($8.99) is another upgraded-to-normal-menu item with marinated, breaded, fried chicken tenders, shredded cabbage, egg sauce, and housemade potato chips. It's a great option if you want your chicken in bread instead of bao. They've also started providing limited desserts recently, and although I had to take the Coconut Panna Cotta w/ Tropical Fruit ($4.75) to-go, it was a refreshing treat that can help to lighten up a meal's end (even though I had it at the beginning).

With a solid core menu and a variety of delicious specials and ""permanent"" specials, Flock and Fowl is definitely one of the best lunch spots around town. I won't hold my breath for it to become a dinner spot as well, but I do hope that I keep seeing Jenny around from time to time. She really is the best, most hospitable host, but she has a lot on her plate and capable employees in her stead.

I am only in Vegas for the weekend so today is the only day it is open and it closes at 3:30 pm. I made a deliberate stop here at just after 2 pm...nearly an hour and a half before closing. And the waitress tells me that they are sold out of the poached Hainanese chicken - and they ALWAYS sell out about this time. Um, what? If you ""always"" sell out an hour and a half before closing, wouldn't you know to make more next time?!? And it's your MAIN dish!! It's not like I'm asking for white truffles on poached blowfish - it's the chicken that is supposedly your staple bread and butter dish!! That's like Pizza Hut running out of pizza!!  It's so ridiculous that's it's absurd! I was also planning on visiting their sister restaurant also, but have scrapped it from our plans since we don't know what they'll be out of if we go there.

4132256,2016-03-08,2,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"I had a chance to meet Chef Sheridan Su a few years ago when he first opened up his restauraunt, ""Fat Choy,"" just east of the Las Vegas Strip. There, Chef Sheridan created an ecclectic fusion of classic American diner-style and Asian comfort-style food. The menu includes items like Pork Belly Bao with pickled mustard greens, cilantro and crushed peanuts. As well, there are sandwiches like Short-Rib Grilled Cheese which are finished with an onion jam, provolone and chedder cheese. Both are rich and tasty offerings, served up in the corner of a very intersting location. It's a spot we would reccomend trying out if you haven't already. 

With ""Flock & Fowl,"" Chef Su takes a lighter look at Asian food with a Hainan approach to preparation. By casual definition, Hainan style is derived from the recipes of the peoples of Hainan province in China. The food is lighter, less oily, and more mildly seasoned than that of the Chinese mainland.

When we visited, we chose to go with what we were told was the House Specialty: ""Mary's Free Range Poached Chicken"".  (pictured above.) It was a real treat! Light and flavorful, the poached chicken is prepared in a seasoned broth and served chilled with seasoned rice. The dish includes a selection of house-made sauces and on our recent visit we chose to pair it with sauteed asaparagus. Other pairings such as fried chicken skins and a fried egg were also available. 

Along side the poached chicken, we also sampled the Sriracha Chicken Wings. The  wings were zesty and spicy without coming off unblanced. The wings were very good, and with 4 wings to the order it was enough for a nice lunch paired with the chicken dish. 

flock and Fowl is located not far from the SLS Casino and Hotel, just West of the corrner of Las Vegas Blvd & Sahara. Get there soon. They are currently only open Tuesday - Saturday   10:30 am - 3:30pm, so plan your visit accordingly. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,2,2,5,Pc9d4IA54MUyK6MzjVOTDA

Hainanese chicken rice plate with 1/4 Mary's free range poached chicken (#1) and added a side of chicken broth, Chinese sausage, and veggies. The poached chicken was borderline dry, just okay, I had to drench it in soy sauce and ginger scallion sauce. Folks can consider adding $2 for dark meat wich might be juicier. The side of chicken broth was very oily and gamey and would be great if used to make soup or gravy as it is legit chicken broth BUT not so much as a soup - SKIP. The Chinese sausage was okay, very little and in small pieces - SKIP. The side veggies appeared to be maybe one or two batches of baby bok choy, for the price point - SKIP as well. 

Hainanese chicken rice plate with buttermilk fried chicken tenders (#2) was great. Nice piece of fried chicken but didn't match the rice plate. Speaking of rice, it was bland and can use additional seasoning. The establishment should consider pulling #2 out of the rice plate section and have it as an a-la-carte item (and add ketchup please!).

Night Market fried chicken bao was awesome! Very delicious, like I said before, a nice piece of fried chicken!

With that said, if you're looking for Hainanese chicken, this place is OKAY but if you want some delicious five spice buttermilk fried chicken, this place is GREAT.",v6GRvRORKVDJAdD2AVuL9A,1,3,3,Xft_htq90AqCqaQGcyoFiA

The area isn't the best, but once you step inside you'll forget all of your worries. 
The decorations are cute, the tables are cute (but also impractical- my keys kept falling through the spacings on the little table and I felt like any sudden movement would knock it over... and I'm not THAT strong ;) ) and the waitresses make you feel extremely welcome. 
The food was beautiful and also delicious. We ordered the poached hainan chicken and the spring chicken. The spring chicken tastes like a fancy rotisserie chicken wing. Good, but I prefer the poached. I thought this goes without saying, but YES the poached chicken is cooked and NOT raw. I heard several newbies asking if the chicken was cooked lolololol c'mon guys do you really think they're serving raw chicken on Sahara Avenue? The rice is flavorful and perfect. I could eat the rice all day. 
My issue with Flock & Fowl was the lack of space that made me feel uncomfortable and rushed. The line can reach out the door (fine, that's unfair the doors like 10ft from the counter), but the amount of people in line hovered over you while eating makes it hard to enjoy the food. But I guess the portions are so small you aren't in there for long anyways. That bring up my second issue. The prices are low, however the portions are small.

4276239,2016-10-05,0,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Been wanting to go to Flock and Fowl due to great reviews on Yelp and high recommendations from friends. Decided to finally come on a Wednesday around 11 with my cousin. I got their specialty which was the Hainanese Poached Chicken with side order of broth and my cousin got their Salad with Roasted Organic Chicken. Decided to also order us the Chicken Tender Bao. 

My Poached Chicken was flavorful and delicious. I've tried Hiananese Chicken where it's been dry and flavor came from the sauce but at Flock and Fowl every aspect of the dish was packed with flavor. The Poached Chicken was moist and rice had a nice gingery lemongrass taste to it. The three housemade sauces were delicious and enjoyable with the chicken. The Chicken Tender Bao were amazing!! One big piece of crunchy moist chicken tender on a pillowy steamed bao bun with crunchy fresh pea shoots and sweet salty sauce that brought the whole thing together. The nice surprise was actually the Salad with Roasted Chicken. It was big, fresh and plenty of delicious textures. There was spinach, shaved carrots, stone fruits, edamame, quinoa, snap peas, mangoes, nuts!! It was a nice surprise in every bite. The roasted chicken was perfectly executed. Crispy, moist, and like everything we had... Intense in flavor. 

Paid about $30 for everything. However I feel the money was worth it. Portion size were big, every dish was flavorful and you can really tell the ingredients were fresh and I think it makes a big difference. A bonus is the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Place is really small and no restroom, but next door is a costume store where Flock and Fowl customers are allowed to use their restroom. I personally didn't mind the small size or no restrooms because it adds to uniqueness to the experience. Definitely a gem of a place and will be taking visiting family and friends here for the superb food and experience.

Now that we have that out of the way, Flock & Fowl is a fascinating little restaurant near the North Side of the Strip and although the hours are short and the menu fairly simple, it's a recommended treat.  

The menu mainly consists around various Chinese Chicken dishes.  This includes the Hainan Chicken which is about $10 (in three variants of poached/fried/roasted) that includes chicken rice and a few sides/sauces.  They also have fried chicken bao, Thai caramel chicken wings and even some salad variants.  Look on the board as you enter to the left for a few specials that included some noodle dishes too that sounded delicious.  

Being my first rodeo, I aimed for the Hainan Chicken poached with all the ingredients along with unsweetened iced green tea.  After a short wait at a comfy table near the window, I received the beautifully prepared plate - something that surprised me at first glance.  Simple and sleek are the last things I think of when I mention Hainan Chicken and yet here we are.  Sauces neatly to the right; the cucumber/mustard greens neatly to the top (wish there was more of them), the rice neatly stacked nearest me and finally the chicken all stacked oddly in a beautiful manner.  The presentation wasn't only good; the chicken (served at room temperature which they can heat more if you'd like) was solid as well as the rest of the dishes.  The standouts for me were the sauces and the mustard/cucumber which added zing and pizazz to the dish more than just a standard soy sauce/ginger mix might bring.  There were some terrific flavor combinations happening and I happily enjoyed mixing and matching all of them.  

Special thanks to Liz/Amber for making me feel really welcome and doing a great job both explaining the dishes and checking up.  The restaurant itself isn't too big - they do have benches for waiting on the side.  The decor is nice/simple

My only qualms are that I wish they were open in the evenings and that seating can get crowded fairly quickly.  They aren't too far from the Strip if you also plan to hoof it but Uber/Lyft make it that much easier plus the parking lot is fairly plentiful.

4326611,2017-06-12,45,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Recently, I've been experiencing a case of ""choice fatigue"" from all my dining adventures. My colleague introduced me to this phrase and explained it's a legit term where we're so exhausted in making a decision (in this case what to eat) and we are completely indifferent.

But here comes Flock & Fowl which came highly recommended by my two LV aces Chris V. and Rod U. (HI) who steered me into this tiny off the strip joint for a hearty lunch. 

With my choice fatigue at its peak, I was so relieved to see the limited menu of chicken dishes. My decision making took less than a minute as I gladly ordered #1 Hainanese Chicken Rice $9.99. The plate consisted of a beautifully poached free range boneless chicken, a mount of savory seasoned rice, tangy pickled vegetables and three sauces to accompany the main attraction. The white meat was delicate and tender where you are able to taste the freshness of the chicken. It didn't have that in-your-face seasoning. 

On the side, they served three homemade sauces: ginger scallion, chile and soy. All of them delicious in their own way but I'm more of a traditionalist and gravitated to the ginger scallion. 

I can understand how the price or quantity doesn't add up but once you have a taste of the chicken you'll be able to taste the difference of this ""cleaner"" version. 

Very simple process of ordering and pay at the counter, grab a number, take a seat and the staff will deliver your dish. The restaurant is very small and crowded but was efficient to get diners in and out without any delay. I noticed more take out orders than dining in. 

The only disappointment is they're closed all day Sunday and Monday and do not serve dinner. There goes another choice I gotta make for the next meal!

4447516,2016-04-12,2,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Flock is such a gem in our little desert! After leaving Cali (specifically Monterey Park) 3 years ago, I would always crave Hainan Chicken Rice. Every time I drove back home, I would always make a stop at Savoy, a joint in Cali known for their hainan chicken rice. I am happy to say that I no longer need to make that trip! Flock and Fowl tastes just like home! My husband actually prefers Flock over Savoy. I think the only thing that Savoy has an edge over is their spicy sauce.

The food is top notch! I always come here every Friday on my days off, and order 2 hainanese chicken rice each time to-go (1 for the hubby and 1 for myself). When we get a chance to dine in, we will order 2 hainan chicken rices to eat at the restaurant, and 2 to-go. That's how delicious Flock makes their signature dish!

The customer service is also top notch, especially Jenny! I'm always greeted by my name whenever I enter, and it amazes me how every time I'm in there, she greets almost every customer walking into her restaurant by their name. You know your food and service is great when almost every customer entering your shop is a regular. 

See you next Friday, Flock & Fowl :p",ycaTwX_sMuuryxsuITB-GA,3,2,5,GORuaul7B3i3bZl8YsJiqw

On to the food - we tried a few things off he menu and everything was fantastic. Flock and Fowl is known for their special Chicken hainan dish and thus the restaurant is aptly named. If you come here you must order it! Or at least a try it if someone else orders it. It's amazing. We also had some Szechuan wings and those were fantastic as well.

I was greeted by a waitress here, who explained to me their menu. While everything sounded great, I came here for one thing and one thing only - the Hainan chicken. I added in a fried chicken bao and chicken broth as sides since I was starving.

The food was great - I don't need to say more. The quality of the chicken was superb, the sauces were exactly how I like them, the fried chicken bao was super crispy... YUM!

Other awesome parts: the poached chicken is boneless (great for the hubby who doesn't like bones), the sauces are homemade and just amazing, and Jenny is super friendly and took the time to explain the menu, ingredients, and sauces.

4530045,2015-11-08,2,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Experience:  I've eaten at Fat Choy and heard this was the new hybrid chicken restaurant from the same owners. Besides all my YELP friends have given it such fantastic reviews, so had to come try.  Annnddd, its in my neighborhood! :)
I came with a girlfriend on a Sat at 2:30. As everyone else mentioned, it's only open very select hours, so be aware. 

Facility: This is located in the strip mall next to the strip mall where Golden Steer is. It's a very small spot with only a few tables and chairs. There are a few chairs in the side to wait if you decide to get Togo. It's very quaint with a clean, modern feel. There was a TV on the wall, but thankfully it wasn't on. They are playing a great soulful, neo-soul type music, that I LOVE!!!  

Service: I met the owner Jenny, and she was super nice and helpful. She describes everything as she places it on your table. Then she comes back to check how you like it, and if you need anymore sauce, etc. Phenomenal service!

Food: We ordered several dishes to try. Jenny said the chicken was all organic, range free chicken out of a farm in California. Good to know!

Chicken Bao - 4/5 - I liked this, but while I was eating it, I was craving more sauce flavor. The chicken strip itself is soaked in buttermilk, and it was cooked perfectly. 

Chicken Wings - 5/5 - we tried both kinds and they both were decisions. The Thai were deep fried with a crispy coating and yummy sauce. The Szechwan were fried and braised, and the sauce was amazing.  

Hainan chicken with an egg and sausage - 4/5 - This was very good. The sauces were good. And I loved the Chinese sausage add-on! It had almost a sweet finish to it. You really have to try it next time you order the Hainan. Unfortunately, this is nothing against the chef, but I love salt on any eggs, and also on white rice, so I kept wishing I had some salt to add to this dish. 

Overall: Great little spot with a specialized menu. Jenny is awesome and really sets the tone for a great dinning experience. Plus these were some of the best wings I've had in Vegas. I'll be back. :)",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,4,4,V_8uJ7GzRjLnOa3C3KaJqw

4571738,2015-10-07,6,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"I flocked to Flock & Fowl today because I have followed Chef Su and Jenny around town from Great Bao to Fat Choy to here and also the Lucky Rice Night Market thing when it debuted here.  They are a great team.  I freakin' love Hainan chicken rice and my main exposure to it was in Thailand.  I had some at a cheap place mentioned in Lonely Planet in Bangkok on my honeymoon, then again in the Bangkok Airways lounge in the Bangkok Airport, where I think I ate 8 plates of it (in 2011).  Fast forward to summer 2014 and Eric R. and I flew from Bali to Bangkok to Tokyo to the US.  We had a long layover in Bangkok (during the coup, and didn't tell anyone we were flying through there - the government shut off the a/c in the airport so I actually passed out)...first though we stopped at a random restaurant in the airport and I got Hainan chicken rice then passed out in the hot restaurant and then Eric R. dragged me to the gate to Tokyo where I passed out from the heat and exhaustion again.

I do not know when I will actually get to Singapore (where this the national dish), Hainan, or Malaysia any time soon, so I am often on the hunt for this dish.  There are a few places that have it in town but...eh!  In the Little Apple where I live, we have a place that serves cao mun guy (Thai version of this dish) but the chicken is dry.

This dish at Flock & Fowl.....well....the chicken is MOIST! and organic, free range fowl!  No foul here, just fowl.  It was so moist that it needed no sauce, seriously.  The rice was delicious and flavorful.  It was served with pickled mustard greens and cucumbers, broth, plus 3 dipping sauces made in house: sesame soy, ginger-scallion, and sambal.  I liked all of the sauces, and dipped my chicken in a random sauce every bite.  Then I drizzled the sauces on the rice.  I wanted an egg but the last one was ordered by the person before me = darn!  So I took a cab here from the Venetian because I was too impatient to wait for the Deuce.  Due to its location on Sahara with lanes only going westbound and a major accident southbound on Vegas Blvd., I decided to walk back.  Fueled by fowl, I flocked back to Caesars Palace where I returned to my conference, feet burning but tummy smiling.  I hope to come back when the restaurant is out of the soft opening.  I also had a green milk tea which Jenny made to order and adjusted sweetness to my taste (I guess I am a bitter gal because I like unsweetened, bitter green tea).  I am pretty fly for a fowl girl (I am what I eat)!  If only I could have flown from the restaurant to my destination.  Too bad I am leaving or I could go to a foot spa on Spring Mountain.  Flock to this place but be patient as the restaurant works out its opening.  According to Jenny, it is meant for take-out which is why there is limited seating and no public restroom.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,11,11,5,Etgy9wW335iiOB02JUMH1Q

I had the #1, Hainan chicken rice and added Chinese sausage. The chicken was so moist and tender best of all boneless. My favorite sauce by far was the ginger (actually got extra). The black sauce was okay and that last one was too hot for me. The rice and Chinese sausage were also tasty.

Both my gf and Mom enjoyed their meals too. They both liked the roasted chicken, also moist and tender. A little small but good. My Mom kept raving about the salad.

everything is organic and homemade here, the sauces, gingers, eggs, even chickens were 'massaged'! the hainan chicken was yum - white meats were so tender, don't need to pay extra for all dark meat! rice was pretty seasoned, fried chicken skin were a little too thick - i did not finish mine and i LOVE chicken skins! i thought the sambal wings were just OK, not so spicy and lack of flavors...

the waitress (or the owner?) was... WAY too attentive... she came over and checked on us for maybe 5 times, explained how everything was prepared... she did the same thing to everyone, so when you are inside a small restaurant, you kinda hear the same thing over and over and over again... yes it's very helpful, i guess if people ask or seem confused on how things are made? the whole thing was seem too excessive.   

would i come back? probably not. (well, if i actually live in LV, yes i would definitely will!) i do recommend people who loves hainan chicken to go give this place a try! the congee with poached egg looks interesting too but i did not give it a try...

Hainan Chicken Rice ($8.99): poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat with pickled cucumbers and mustard greens.

Chicken is organic free range; it's the American version of the chickens that are found in Asia called ""Tu-Gi"" - ground/dirt chickens since they run around all day on dirt.

The chicken was poached perfectly. Juicy. Tender. Melt in my mouth. The rice was soooooo flavorful! Perfectly al dente. I'll be dreaming about this for awhile. 

Sauces are all made in house. Dip the chicken in the soy, add a dollop of ginger scallion and do a dab of the sambal sauce. Eat. Repeat. 

Broth. Get the broth. Hands down that broth is amazeballs. I wish I could get the broth Fedex-Ed to me next time I get sick. It tasted like hearty yummy chicken. 

Cornish hen salad was delicious! Served with half a hen that's fried so that the skin had all sorts of delicious crispy heavenly goodness. It comes with a wedge of lemon and a twist on the classic salt and pepper that included ground Szechuan peppercorns!

You then just eat it with soy sauce and rice basically. For the price and the chicken meat, it's too much. You can get a comparable chicken from a good Chinese restaurant for the same.

In any case, the friends and I finally had a chance to stop by and we glad that we did.  First of all, we were not at all familiar with the location so we got lost but we eventually found it.  There's not a lot of parking so when it gets busy, it can be challenging.  The space is quite small and it's harder for larger groups to sit together since the premise of this place is to order first and then find a seat after.  If you are a larger group, they try to accommodate you and make sure that your group sits together, which is pretty awesome.  The staff is very friendly and service is on point.  They check up on how things are and they make sure that your water is filled and will ask if you want more sauce.  

Anyhow, as I stated earlier, you order first and their menu is not at all extensive.  They keep it simple so they can work their magic on the items that they do offer.  Some of my friends opted for the chicken and rice (roasted version as well), chicken wings and the bao.  The chicken bao was massive.  It was a little dry for me but you just add some sauce to it and viola!  It becomes awesome.  The boyfriend got the roasted chicken and rice and he really liked it.  He said that his chicken was not dry at all and he especially loved the rice.  I ordered the hainan chicken and rice.  I agree with the boyfriend and the rice was excellent - it had excellent flavor and it was not salty at all.  Who knew that rice would be so darn good?!?  The chicken was moist and had great flavor but you do need the sauces to make it spectacular (at least that's my preference).  If they don't offer you enough sauce, you can always ask for more.

Staffing & Service:
-Extremely nice and attentive staff
-1 chef (owner), 2 cashier/server/buser

Menu/Food:
- I had the poached chicken salad with an added over easy egg.  Delicious! The salad ingredients were incredibly fresh and interesting.  Due to food allergy, I requested mine without avocado and fresh grapes, but it was still really great tasting and had wonderful textures.  The poached boneless Hainan chicken is legit!  Egg was also well done
- Menu has a very small offering but better a well execute small menu than a long list of junk

Location:
-Really bad neighborhood
-Exiting the parking onto Sahara was difficult.  Watch out for that left turn merger, I almost got hit driver side by a vehicle Exiting onto Industrial and once you merge on Sahara, everyone is driving at 40+mph while you're ramping up to 10mph.  

OVERALL:
Food was delicious, but the chicken salad with added egg was not filling as a lunch plate.  Another companion in our group had the roasted chicken rice plate, served with one small quarter bone in chicken.  We both ended up getting more food at a nearby restaurant when we left for dessert in Chinatown.  We would visit again but will need to order a 3rd sharing plate to fill 2 adults (both of us are under 150lbs).",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,2,1,5,Y3TsI52HUSU4cwU9scLllA

What a great experience in exceptional preparation of Hainanese Chicken with Rice that has a Vietnamese influence using quality organic product created by Chef Sheridan Su. Superb service and barista execution in a knowledgeable and educated delivery by Jenny Wong.
Hainanese Chicken and Rice is the house speciality, A MUST.
The House Salad consist of a mixture of bib lettuce and assorted greens, pomegranate, avocado, dried cranberries and ripe tomato silvers coated lightly in a house made dressing, addition of a sunny side up organic fried egg also with slices of chinese sausage 
confit is a treat.
Thai Chicken Wings are off the chart. The sauce is not spicy but the flavoring with the Thai fish sauce makes for a great flavor profile. Chef's cooking method keeps them wings moist.
Bao Bun with Fried Chicken Tenders marinated in butter milk (again) with Chef's spin on the breading along with garnishes. 
Chili, Scallion & Ginger and Lite Soy are sauces that of course Chef makes from scratch. With the addition of a cup of Chicken broth is also fun and flavorful.

The only thing I think the dish was missing was the green onion oil on the rice. The sauces were spot on minus the soy sauce. I am used to a salty sweet soy with my Hainan Chickens so this is why I am singling it out. We picked the 1 hour egg (which has a custard consistency) and Chinese sausage. I recommend cracking that egg over your rice and a few drops of the soy sauce that comes with your chicken on it...amazing! They had a pop-up menu and I got to try the pancit and cheese (think Mac and Cheese). It was soooo good. I never thought the two would go together but it did.

Pro-tip: Flock and Fowl is on UberEats, 

=====Flock and Fowl vs. Big Wong's=====
* Chicken: Flock and Fowl! More flavorful and slightly more tender at F&F
* Rice: Both were decently good, I think I favored Flock.
* Value: Big Wong's - only $5 for a plate and you get more chicken!
* Sauce: The dipping sauces are better at Flock and Fowl, but I've had better.

=====Other Dishes=====
* Fried Chicken Wings - 3.5 stars: Thai chili was FAR better than the Honey Sriracha. The Sriracha had a weird flavor and was too sweet. I liked how big and crunchy they were.
* Oolong Milk Tea - 2.5 stars: Tasted very homemade in a way I didn't enjoy.... Would not order again.
* Broth - 2 stars: Scalding hot, too oily, not flavorful enough. Only 99 cents for a cup!

The chicken rice was made with some sort of broth/fat, making it absolutely delicious. Their chicken was a mixture of both white and dark meat, creating a juicy balance.  I remember telling my friend during the meal that I was already looking forward to my next visit - yea it's THAT good.

The menu was quite simple with limited number of items. I prefer menus that way because that meant the restaurant must specialize in those items they serve. They have poached chicken which is a common technique Asians cook their chicken. So I order that with salad. My boyfriend ordered with the broken rice instead. The broken rice came with egg and other pickled vegetables. The amount of chicken they give you was a good portion and I felt full afterwards. The meat was juicy and tender as well.

I wanted to write in particular about yesterday's Sesame Noodles special. From what I was told, some people who ordered the dish were disappointed, but I'm guessing that that was because they didn't know what to expect.

Years ago, when I lived in New York City, cold sesame noodles were a staple Chinese takeout dish--a dish that was sometimes heavy, somewhat greasy, always addictive. Flock & Fowl's version was exactly what I had hoped for on a July afternoon when our car thermometer was reading 120 degrees--a light, healthy, equally addictive take on the cold sesame noodles I remember.

Flock & Fowl served up slivered carrots and cucumber, cold noodles, and warm poached chicken pieces arrayed on a plate with the sesame sauce on the side. This allowed me to mix the ingredients myself, adding as much of the wonderful sesame sauce as I wanted. I happily took the server up on her offer of extra sauce, since it seemed quite healthful (delicately delicious rather than pasty thick). The flavors melded together beautifully, and the nuanced result was yummy.

The cold sesame noodles weren't at all spicy, which brings me to the other reason I wanted to write a second review. The food at Flock & Fowl is made to order, and the staff is very accommodating, so if you have specific expectations, you should definitely speak up. I'm sure I could have asked for the cold sesame noodles to have some kick to them, and I think that's probably true for a lot of the dishes. My sense is that Flock & Fowl leans toward extremely well executed, subtly (in a good way) flavored dishes that appeal to a wide range of palates, but I'm guessing that they will happily try to fulfill requests regarding individual tastes as long as they know about them.",nEABfoTu6n6qvLRD2_mX1w,4,0,5,0I2KBW8VKzwVrHZNkXJ1qw

All of the sauces would be fine just served with the seasoned rice but they took the chicken to another level.  Everyone just devoured our plates.

Chicken wings might be even better.  I don't know what they put in the sauce but it was out of this world and the wings are slightly crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I can't say enough good things about this place.

Oh and another thing, if you don't have 2 hours for lunch (wait for table and wait for food), I would suggest going elsewhere as food is also slow to come out because of the small kitchen.

Other than that, I really did enjoy my hainan chicken.  I ordered it with veggies of the day which was bok choy.  I thought for the price of the add on, the portion was extremely small.  I wouldn't order it next time.  The chicken comes with 3 delicious sauce.  My favorite was the ginger, I had to ask for more of that.  The sauces really make this dish!  The warm garlic rice paired really well with the tender soft chicken meat.  I could eat bowls of that rice.  

We also tried the fried chicken buns.  It's not my favorite because I found it really dry.  It was breast meat and I would have preferred thigh meat which is juicer.  The momofuku one is wayyy better although way more expensive as well.

It was ""okay"". I didn't care to finish it. Their claim to ""Indo"" (Indonesian) rice I think was met by a judicious use of Indonesian sweet soy sauce, but that's where similarities ended. The Chinese sausage was nice, but there were very few and skimpy shreds of chicken and much of the bacon stir-fried in was still chewy as opposed to crisp. What WAS crispy that I could taste was lot of garlic that was fried to the point of almost-bitter. The egg was ""okay"". I love poached eggs and runny yolks, but a lot of the egg white was also quite runny and well, snot-like (horrible sounding, I know, but accurate). Portion size was great if you wanted lots of rice. Chrysanthemum tea was really pleasant, just strong enough and very freshly-brewed tasting but I admit I did a small double take at the total charge coming to close to $18 (with tax) for what I'd gotten.

Simply put, this is an authentic, closest tasting Hainanese chicken rice to the hawker stands of Singapore.  Boneless, tender, moist, not fatty pieces of chicken with a very pronounced chickeny flavor served with rice cooked in a rich chicken stock.  Add a whatever portion of dark soy, grated ginger and scallion oil, and fiery chili sauce before spooning the entire bite into your eagerly awaiting mouth.  Then, wow.

First of all, the chicken rice is very tender and the rice soaks up the flavor, this is a top notch dish and worth the wait.  Their ginger dipping sauce hits the spot.  The only complaint is that the portion is small, like a larger appetizer, so don't come hungry.  Perhaps an extra chicken add on for a few more dollars?

The fried chicken tenders was a little disappointing.  The outside was nice and crispy, the inside was very moist.  The only problem is that it's way too salty and dipping into the provided sauces makes this worse.

The biggest disappointment is the jook or chicken congee.  This is not done the traditional way, the texture was off, the bean sprouts and pickled veggies just didn't work. Why don't they use a traditional recipe and use their high quality chicken and this certainly would be a big hit?

Note that the restaurant is hard to find and not in good neighborhood, going here only for lunch is high advisable.  When on Sahara, look for Tam street, it's in the small strip mall.

I never knew chicken can taste this delicious, it's the best I have eaten in Las Vegas!!!

It was deceiving at first, a quaint restaurant with what looked like simple chicken & rice dishes not a whole lot choose from.  I thought to myself ""what's their deal, am I at the right place?"" 
As I sat down and had my first bite of the chicken that's when my world flipped over.

Roasted Spring Chicken with rice - The best part of the chicken is that its so tender and juicy. I didn't have to use a fork, simply broke the chicken apart by hand. The flavors was intense but not complicated, seasoned with garlic, ginger and other spices.  They provided me a side of dipping sauces and a lemon to further enhance my taste buds. Even the rice was cooked evenly, cooked with the chicken stock. Simply Amazing!!

The Chicken Katsu 2.0 
It's pickled Jalapeno tenders with Egg and cabbage.
I don't see this on menu very often, so by chance if you see it order it!!
If there is national bucket list for sandwiches, this must be on the list.
The chicken katsu was crunchy and salty, while the chicken inside stays moist and full of flavor. The egg and cabbage mixture created the creaminess necessary to bind everything together. 

With great food comes a great staff.
Every time I go I'm always warmly greeted and received awesome service. 
Liz and Jenny are exceptional, knowledgeable and passionate about the food they serve.

Food: Ordered hainain chicken with rice and Chinese sausage. The chicken is super moist.  I didn't know plain chicken could taste so good.  Comes with three dipping sauces which are all good. And the rice OMG. It is probably cooked in butter but it is so good. Got a side of bok Choy and that was even tasty.  
Also got the fried chicken bun thing.  This was also good, the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist in the inside.  But I definitely recommend getting the classic hainain chicken when you go.  You can order extra/sides with it.

Ambiance: small, got crowded around noon.  Slightly hispterish. The menu is kind of confusing and is like a picture frame on the wall that one of the workers explain.

Flock and Fowl is as good as it gets.  You don't understand how much I miss Singapore,  I miss the food there more than I miss my friends there.  I am the type of person that will fly halfway across the world for their favorite food.  And i did just that when it come to Hainan chicken over rice.   This place is legit.  The owner is even in Singapore right now taking lessons on how to improve, not that they need to.  This place can be hard to find if you miss your exit, so don't MISS IT!  

I walked into the cafe on a weekday and was shock to see how packed it was.  There was one table left which is great cause i got really lucky.  You have to place your order in the front and then take a seat.  The Owner Jenny will greet you with a smile and provides attentive service.  I got the Hainan Chicken over rice.  It came out pretty fast! The presentation was nice and it came with 3 sauces.  The sauces include the ginger, sweet soy and chili sauce, all which was made in house. I added an egg to mine, was was on top of the special rice.   

The way I normally rate Hainan chicken,  comes down to the rice and the way the skin is attached to the chicken.  In this case, it met all my standards.  The chicken was boneless and the skin came off easily.  The chicken was not dry and perfectly moist.  The rice was just want i wanted.  It was flavored well and wasn't too oily!   Just completely perfect!

I have to say I like this place more than Savory in SoCal.  When i found out this place opened, i seriously convinced my friend to fly out to Vegas just to try it when we got off the plane.   Of course, it's cheaper than flying to Singapore.  I was so tempted to buy one togo to bring it bak to the bay but they don't open on Sunday. Oh the heartbreak!!

The food atmosphere is great and what friendly and knowledgeable staff.   I showed up first before my wife so I got started with the chicken wings as an appetizer. I had both the salt and pepper as well as angry sauce. The batter on the wings was fresh and amazing, perfectly tender. The salt and pepper wings however could use just a tad more salt. Keep in mind I tend to have a bolder pallet when it comes to wings. I also think they could scale back with the sauce on the angry wings. When my wife arrived we had the Laksa which is very similar to a Northern Thai style Kao Soi. That was delicious but not the best I've had. 
    When I asked the waiter what their signature dish was he recommended the Hainanese Chicken Rice. This is where they should get 5 stars.

Achieving unlikely success in the middle of Eureka Casino with his Great Bow-turned-Brick+Mortar Fat Choy, Sheridan Su has seemingly found success where so many others have failed largely by keeping head down, eyes up, while focusing on quality of the product, and narrowing his focus even further at recently opened Flock & Fowl the young Chef finds has proven the rare double threat with a ""do one thing and do it well"" space that gets it right.

Historically an adapted dish of early Chinese decedents from the Hainan Province, but offered throughout Asia and a few famous shops speckled around the United States, Su and his wife Jenny officially started obsessing over the dish following a visit to Taiwan and although a recipe of poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat may seem 'simple,' its perfection lies in the details - all of which the duo seems to have dialed in.

No more fanciful in location than Fat Choy. the renovated space on Sahara next to a pawn shop and within view of the Strip Clubs on Industrial Road in the shadow of The Strip, Flock & Fowl seems as intentionally limited in its seating as it is in its menu and with Sheridan in the Kitchen as Jenny works the room orders are placed at the counter with service fast to follow, a ""one of each"" order seeing our table of six served in three successive rounds.

Starting with Sheridan's longtime signature buns, in this case graced with crispy buttermilk soaked bird from Mary's Free Range with a bit of kale slaw and sauce, it almost seems silly that anyone could be excited about the pending opening of Chick-fil-A with such a thing available, each bite first met by pillowy bao before giving way to bittersweet flavors juxtaposing juicy, well-seasoned meat.

Rare to be wowed by wings, though always open to a change of heart, round two saw Sheridan send out a couple extra bites of each flavor to that the whole table could enjoy, and with two flavors available the only real question is which of them to order, the Szechuan expectedly the 'hotter,' though certainly not ridiculous, while the fish-sauce tossed Thai style rivaled those at Pok-Pok for flavor, if not for size.

Served all three entrees at once, easily enough to feed six adults when paired with that which had already come, suffice it to say that the Chicken tenders were perfectly fine if not particularly 'wowing' compared to the rest, yet when paired to the housemade chile sauce or chunky bits of garlic the three-piece order was an absolute steal for just $9, the crispy cornish hen another veritable steal alongside a complex and elegant salad for just a dollar more.

Speaking last to the dish Su set out to perfect it should first be said that many at the table had never sought out a truly authentic version until this date, but whether a virgin or a veteran none at the table seemed to be disappointed in the silky broiled breast or the fluffy white rice, a $2 addition of spicy Chinese sausage every bit worth the surcharge while the bonus broth was chock-a-block full of flavor without being pumped up with salt or MSG.

****Flawed only in the inherent limitations of space, an outsourced single dessert, and menu -  the later to be remedied by specials from time-to-time - Flock & Fowl has thus far shown that perhaps Las Vegas is ready to embrace such a focused concept - the early word almost universally favorable, but a fate that only time and the fickleness of local 'media' will tell.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,4,PC2cD5vfWr9igFUyDxZdVg
5296762,2016-11-30,7,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Singaporean food! I was craving for something different & this was a good mix of asian food. Located off the end of the strip. Definitely a hidden little gem next to other shops that aren't even restaurants. Small parking lot.

* Ordered:
- Chicken Bacon Truffle Burger (4/5 stars): Talk about egg porn! This was one of their off the menu specials & the fact that I'm not much of a fan of bacon in my burger, the egg drew me to ordering this. Anything with ""truffle"" in it, you already know it's going to be a crazy combination of other food in the burger. I loved how it was served with potato chips & a large sliced pickle. It balances out the salty part of the burger to sour to sweet. 

- One buttermilk fried chicken bao (4/5 stars): This is the main reason why we went here! What was deceiving was the portion size. I didn't know it would be a mini size until they asked if I wanted one or two. It seemed like a snack to others, but this could be just another meal if you order 2. Crispy, buttery, & soft on the bun side. Thankful we decided on this!

- #3 Roasted Spring Chicken with Rice (4/5 stars): AH! Such a good plate filled with both rice, chicken, & lemon with seasoning to squeeze all over. I love the way they roasted the chicken. It was perfect to its crisp.

- Milk Green Tea & Vietnamese coffee (5/5 stars): These 2 drinks were first served to us & I almost finished it before the food even got to us! SO good! The milk green tea was not just any green tea, it was very mellow on the milky side. I loved it! Same goes for the Vietnamese coffee. Something to keep us awake throughout the day yet very light on the coffee side.

* Service (4/5 stars):
Shout out to LIZ! She was our sweetest waitress! She acknowledged our outfits & conversed with us like any other customers dining in. She deserves the full 5/5 stars for her friendly service, checking up on us, & made us feel welcome. As for the girl who took our order at the register, she didn't seem pleased to serve us. Simply took our order & gave our number, nothing too dramatic, just no expression of a smile & kept talking to her coworkers. They have a ""House Rules"" posted & it seems as though to help them better, TAKE YOUR ORDERS TO GO! It's such a small dine in that it's understandable that they'd love to serve everyone but simply can't because they do not have the space for it. ""To go is helping you, help us, help you""

Oh & rule number 9, when you're in Vegas though... ""No shirt. No shoes. No service."" Straight up & simple!",tzny-qjvs0gBpDIPqFt-1Q,10,10,4,jPv35qpN0DWldH_DYmojUw
5319972,2015-10-26,8,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"Sheridan Su and Jenny Wong have done it again. Their success with Fat Choy is due to their great business sense and people skills: offer good food at affordable prices. Flock and Fowl just has more sophistication, shall I say. 

They are located at the same complex as Golden Steer. Currently, their business hours are limited. Seating is limited (about 5 small tables) but you can always take your food to-go instead. They have about 5 organic poultry menu items/combos. But the freshly made drinks and the Hainan chicken rice are the business!

Hainan Chicken Rice:
First of all, I'm not a big fan of chicken skin that is white. If it's not BBQ'ed, fried, baked, or roasted to a golden brown - I refuse to eat it. I avoid Hainan chicken rice at all costs...but not this time! I'd have to say, this is the first Hainan chicken rice I've ever liked. Ok so maybe, I removed the chicken skin but the sliced chicken pieces were juicy. You dip the chicken in sambal, garlic ginger or soy sauce...or maybe, all 3. Then, eat it with the fragrant and flavorful rice with mustard greens. 5/5

Bao Chicka Bao Bao:
A big hot juicy chicken tender in a bao (steamed bun) with kale and sauce. There's nothing quite like it. Soft bao + crispy kale and chicken. Yuuuummm!!! 5/5

Lemon Tea:
Refreshing and fragrant without being too tart. Jenny makes a fresh batch from scratch as needed. 5/5

Milk Green Tea:
If you want a somewhat richer kind of drink, this is a good option. It's floral and slightly creamy. 4.5/5

Jenny can make adjustments to your drink if you want it sweeter, more tart, etc. They're genuinely nice. They remember customers' names. They take time to chat with you.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,18,16,5,FHToyPZZQ3Fk0Vn8Nj9QNQ

5349214,2015-11-06,2,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"My friends and I recently went to Flock & Fowl for lunch due to the awesome reviews. I love eating Hainan Chicken when I can. I often visit Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra for the dish and I have tried the popular Nong's Khao Man Gai in Portland, Oregon as well. Of course, Flock & Fowl's version is different -- I do believe they base theirs on Taiwan's version. 

My friends and I all ordered the Hainan Chicken ($8.99) to try. Two of my friends ordered Chinese sausage ($1.99) with it. Other than Chinese sausage, you can add on an egg, broth, or salad. Each dish comes with a mix of dark and white meat chicken -- organic free ranged chicken at that. It also comes with rice, which is traditionally cooked with chicken broth but judging from the rice's consistency and flavor, I can't say it was traditionally done. On the side is some cucumbers and pickled mustard greens. Then on a tray is three different sauces for you: ginger and scallion, a sweet soy, and a spicy sauce. 

The chicken itself is very tender and juicy. It was prepared beautifully. However, perhaps I'm just not used to organic chicken...the flavor just isn't there for me. The essence of chicken is missing. Even when I use the ginger and scallion sauce on it, it just doesn't bring about the same reaction as I usually get. Also,I normally love chicken skin and the aroma it comes with. I don't necessarily eat it often though because I've had some pretty bad experiences as a child. The chicken skin that came with the chicken here at Flock & Fowl just does not make me excited. 

The rice was fantastic. I love rice. I love rice that isn't mushy. The rice here had just the right amount of bite to it. The flavors were really subtle. I kind of wish that they used chicken broth to make it. But hell ... What's even better? Mixing the ginger and scallion sauce into the rice and eating it! 

Chinese sausage is really good. Chinese sausage is like a comfort food to me so it has a dear place in my heart. The flavors are great with rice so definitely give it a try. 

As for the service, I guess I could give them the benefit of the doubt that there is literally only one person working the restaurant front. Though, something stood out to me that I absolutely did not understand. My boyfriend and I were standing in line to order and when it was our turn, the phone rang. It turned out to be a phone order and it turned out that the phone order came before us, regardless of the fact that we've been waiting long before that phone order was placed. Not to mention that it was a good 30+ minute wait for our food. 

The establishment is also really tiny. There is only about five tables or so. No restrooms. Sorry. You'll have to go to Capriottis for that one. 

End point. I would probably justify it with a 3.5 rating. I liked it .. I just didn't love it -- aside from the rice and pickled mustard greens that is. The wait and the ""put phone orders first"" was definitely not a plus on this one. So even if I do give it another go, I would only do take out. Doing take out means I'll be able to cut in front of whoever is in line during that time. 

I've had better but not in Vegas. If you compare to the other places in Vegas that serve Hainan Chicken, Flock & Fowl is definitely a solid and #1 choice.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,3,4,GzjGInPKdSjnh3OM0mBpMg

5350712,2017-01-18,0,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"My dish was a chef's special called curry fried rice or something.  I was very excited to try it at first and when it came it looks amazing and smelled amazing, BUT it was extremely salty and difficult to eat. I was only able to eat about 1/8 of it until I decided to take it home and see if it was savable by eating it with plain rice instead.  Unfortunately I'll don't know since my boyfriend look it home instead. (Don't plan on asking him, since a few months have passed by lol.) Everyone else in my group ordered the specialty Hainan chicken said it was nothing special.  They said they would be content with Hainan chicken from Big Wong or any other Chinese restaurant as they taste better and for less, but the chicken would not be free range.  There was a table next to mine where the guy had barely touched his food a women who worked there asked if everything was okay with their meal.  To make it short, he said the Hainan chicken was nothing special and not worth the price paid. 

If you really need free range chicken, go right ahead, but don't expect anything better in flavor than a typical restaurant that serve Hainan Chicken and maybe ask for less salt if you ever order the fried rice.  I don't think I would be back to try anything else since their location is out of the way as well as their menu variety is small.

5390862,2015-10-28,2,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"After one visit I'm hooked with Flock & Fowl.   I usually like the try a place a handful of times before officially christening it with a rating, but the meal and experience I just had was special enough to warrant an instant 5 star review from me.   

I might get my foodie card pulled with this admission, but I've never been to Great Bao or Fat Choy and am completely unfamiliar with the food of Jenny Wong and Sheridan Su outside of what I've read online.   This was a heck of an introduction.

I was almost scared off by some of the reviews stating long lines and long waits.   It was roughly 12:15 when I arrived on a Wednesday and I had ordered by 12:20 and had food on by roughly 12:30.   I may have just lucked out, but I guess the moral of my story is don't let the fear of a long line or wait scare you out of going.   

The menu is small so ordering is quick and painless, especially if you're the type like me to just agree to any/all add-ons.   Number 1: Hainan Chicken and Rice.  Egg?  Chinese Sausage?   Why yes, I'll take both.   Chicken Broth?  Sure!  My gluttony knows very little limits, I was almost tempted to try one of the baos or some wings but then I realized there's always next week, or tomorrow...  

Back to my experience today.   After receiving my iced lemon tea which had a great balance and just the right amount of tart, my food arrived shortly after.  It was presented quite beautifully, with the fried egg perfectly perched upon a heaping mound of rice, the tray of 3 sauces, and the perfectly cooked de-boned chicken and chinese sausage.   Off to the side was the cup of chicken broth.   At this exact moment, food and drink in front of me, Jenny (can I go first name basis at this point?) having just explained all the components of the dish to me, I'll admit I was frightened.  In what is one of my top 500 most embarrassing google searches of all time, before I drive to Flock & Fowl for lunch I googled ""How to eat Hainan Chicken""   If any of you work for the NSA you can confirm this fact.  Not having found much help or guidance there, I looked at Jenny and showed all my cards and asked her.   She assuredly answered that I can do whatever the flock I wanted to and there was no right way.  

WHAT A RELIEF!   My foodie fear out the window, I started meticulously attacking this meal.  There are hundreds of combinations of bites you can create with all the components I had, and as the plate got less full, I was creating them with reckless abandon.   Oh let me get a piece of the chicken, dunk that into the broth, then into the soy, then add scallion, a piece of egg, and some rice, and shove that all into my mouth.   Outcome:  delicious.   I didn't have one bite that I thought was subpar.   

Jenny was a gracious host the entire meal, and was constantly checking on every customer eating there.  As I was about to leave, I had finished my lemon tea and wanted to try the oolong.   I never like to assume free refills unless I'm at some conglomerate owned-chain, so I pulled out a $5 bill ready to pay for another, but Jenny graciously told me she could just refill my empty Lemon Tea cup.   As I expected given the quality of everything else I had prior, it's also delicious.

My friends and I stopped by here for a late lunch while entering Vegas. The place is rather small so it's not great for groups. Even at 2PM, it was busy enough that my group of 9 had to be split into 3 tables. Otherwise, it has a hipster vibe to it and the staff are so friendly and cheery, it's contagious.

I heard from one of my friends that they sometimes run out of their popular Hainan Chicken Rice, but luckily they still had it for our late lunch. You can also get Buttermilk Fried Tenders or Roasted Spring Chicken with rice instead of the normal poached chicken, and there's a salad option if you're not feeling rice. They also have wings and baos.

I'm not a rice person so I was glad there was a salad, which you could get with any of the 3 chicken options:

* ORGANIC SALAD ($10.99) - 4/5
[organic veggies, dried and fresh fruit, nuts and seeds]
The salad consisted of mixed greens, strawberries, grapes, dried cranberries, sliced almonds, granola and some sort of dressing/vinaigrette. Simple salad with a refreshing sweetness from the fresh/dried fruit. I wasn't too fond of the granola though. It was a little soggy from the dressing and made me feel like I was eating cereal, so I wish they had called that out on the menu so I could have left it out. I got my salad with the Hainan chicken, which was perfectly poached. I wasn't expecting bones since I'm used to deboned Hainan chicken, but it was super tender and juicy!",ofZzcj1oiHS64f7jbGCXxQ,3,2,4,o376fexOeUHrR8yAh6GiiA

I ordered the numero uno which is the 1/4 Poached Chicken and when they served it I was like ""this shit looks plain as fuck"". It was as if someone decided to make a dish that was supossed to be dipped in sauce like a boss but instead after they prepared it they washed the sauce off and was left sauceless. I then proceeded to cut the chicken with a knife and fork and low and behold this plain looking chicken had some flavor to it. The rice was fire too.

The dish felt very clean and healthy but the sauces made it flavorful and you can tell everything was fresh. It's just something you appreciate after eating all that junk food in your life.

Thanks to the reviewers who recommended getting here early - we arrived before 11:30 AM on a Tuesday before our drive home to CA and there was one other party already there, but after we placed our order and sat down the place totally filled up!

No public restrooms - you'll be told that pretty much the moment you step in.  I love the space - so bright and clean!  Order and pay at the counter, then grab a seat.  

We shared a Hainan chicken rice ($8.99), 4-piece Thai wings ($4.99), 2 chicken baos ($6.99) and an iced lemon tea ($2.99).  The Hainan chicken was really moist and the rice was flavorful, the Thai wings had a delicious sauce coating the super crispy skin, the chicken baos were amazing as well.  The lemon tea (which Jenny brews herself) was different than the overly sweet lemon tea that you might get at an HK cafe, but it was refreshing and I liked the tartness (part of the flavor reminded me of sour plum).

- Chicken broth (additional $0.99) - this was oilier than expected. Probably would not get again but seemed like a natural accompaniment.

The rice was delicious. They give u 3 options for the chicken prep - traditional, fried or roasted. I was told traditional means poached. I opted for the roast chicken after making sure that it will be crispy. It certainly was crispy but for some reason it was drenched in oil. It almost looked like fried chicken. In fact my friend thought I must have been given fried chicken. The greasiness of chicken is what really put me off this place and made me give it three stars. I'm not fond of greasy food. I expect my roast chicken to be moist and crispy without being greasy.

I'm also not sure why the one hour egg was called a one hour egg. It was good but it looked and tasted like a poached egg to me. Nothing unusual or fancy.

The Hainan chicken is an interesting version of this Cantonese staple.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, including the three wonderful sauces.  We also had a version of chicken congee or ""Gai Jook.""  I finished my healthy-sized lunch with some of the Thai wings-- a little sweet, and tasty.  I wanted to try the chicken bao but did not have the appetite.

This tiny restaurant without a restroom, understands that it is all about the food!  The owner has a wonderful personality, and I thoroughly enjoyed her company.  I find humorous some of the Yelp reviews who criticize her for being too friendly and attentive.  Many customers even Yelpers have always believed that the world revolves around them???

Also, all plates do come with three dipping sauces. The three sauces were house-made ginger scallion sauce, house-made chile, and house-made soy.

It's in a scary shopping center where most of the stores have bars on the windows and you can throw a rock in any direction and hit a strip club.  

We were greeted with ""HELLO WELCOME WE DO NOT HAVE HIGH CHAIRS OR A PUBLIC BATHROOM"".  Woah, lady!  Dial it down a notch! I felt really bad for her because she was doing literally everything but making the food.  She took the orders, ran the food, and bussed the tables.  Can we get this lady some helpers before she has an aneurysm please? She's a hard worker for sure!  So much hustle! 

Order your food at the counter AND THEN SIT DOWN or else this lady might reprimand you like she did the people behind us.  

$35.70 got us a hainan chicken dinner, a cornish game hen dinner, a vietnamese coffee, and a green tea.  

$8.99 Hainan chicken dinner comes with three dipping sauces (ginger scallion sauce + house made chile + house made soy) rice, pickled cucumbers, and preserved mustard greens.  I also added chinese sausage and broth for $2.24.  I was expecting the hainan chicken to be a room temperature but I was not expecting the broth to be the same temp....so that surprised me.  The rice was wonderful...fatty and silky and delicious.  The chicken was so juicy and tender...probably the best white meat chicken I've ever tasted.  

My husband had the cornish game hen with salad.  The salad was phenominal...the greens were fresh and crispy and it had tons of fresh toppings like pomegranite arils, avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, kale, etc.  and came already dressed with the most delicious sesame dressing. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked too long.  It was dry and almost black on the bottom.  I felt like I was in that christmas vacation movie where they are all chewing on that dry-ass turkey and trying to choke it down with water.

What sold me was the concept of the chicken + bao. I was excited to try the crispy chicken tucked between the soft bao. The contrasting textures made my tongue salivate. Unfortunately this dish fell short. Perhaps because the chicken was too big? It didn't allow the edges to get fully crispy. Also, the batter lacked some flavor. Def worth trying at least once.

We also ordered the Hainam rice with Chinese sausage. It was very rich and moist in texture. But too heavy on the soy sauce which gives it that deep brown color. We also ordered the wings in a Thai and Sriracha flavor. No worries, it wasn't spicy. It was very crispy and the sauce was thick and caramelized. My favorite dish was the salad with roasted chicken.

A friend and I ordered the Hainnan chicken rice with a side of egg and Chinese sausage, the sambal chicken wings, and the bao, in addition to the salad. 

Somehow, the two gentlemen who ordered their food after us were getting the exact same order of Hainnan chicken, wings, as well as the salad dish prior to us, which lead to much confusion. 

We got an apology by the waitress, and then received our orders, but couldn't help but notice that the size of our chicken was 3/4 the size of the table next to us, and the wings were smaller as well. The salad portion was also significantly smaller. Side by side, it was a bit obvious. 

The Hainnan chicken itself seemed like high quality chicken. The portion however is small as a trade-off. The side sauces that came with it were okay.  

The sambal wings were an epic fail in flavor, and neither of us enjoyed it, even leaving a wing behind. 

The salad dressing and flavor was really good and refreshing. The bao was nothing to rave about as the fried chicken inside had a mediocre crunch, texture, and flavor was unimpressive. 

All in all, the price was a bit high for everything we got. The service is questionable, as there is one person running around trying to take orders and serve customers. Not only did it seem hectic, but, the waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed and anxious in general. 

Just a note, there is no restroom available, so wash your handsies prior, and your bowels emptied prior to your arrival.

5918915,2015-11-03,7,68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,"I had lunch recently with friends at Flock & Fowl, which from what I have read of the few reviews posted at the time, is all about their authentic preparation of Hainan Chicken Rice.  The restaurant is on a small stripmall lot on Sahara, and very close to Las Vegas Blvd and SLS.  I can see parking potentially be a problem, but there should be plenty of street parking on the side street.  It is a very small restaurant with very limited seating, so if you plan to go during your lunch break, go early and beat the crowd. Or expect to wait or have it prepared as a takeout.

So what exactly is Hainan Chicken Rice, aka Hainanese Chicken Rice (????)? It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore, and is very popular in Vietnam and Thailand as well.  But it is based on a dish called Wen Chang Chicken (???) from the Southern Chinese province of Hainan (??).  And each country that adapted this popular and tasty dish from early Chinese immigrants from Hainan put their own regional spin on it.  I have tried a few variations already (Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore), and as long as the chicken is cooked and still moist, it is already considered good by my book.

The variation prepared and served at Flock & Fowl is one of the better ones for sure.  The chicken is moist and paired well with the fluffy white rice cooked with chicken fat (this might be the first time I have tried this variation, as I am more accustomed to the rice being cooked with chicken broth, which gives it more chicken flavor) and the homemade sambal chile sauce and the ginger scallion sauce.  For diners looking for a simple and healthful meal option, this is definitely a good choice.  Additional add-ons are available, such as egg and chinese sausage, which I think will make your dining experience even better.

Even though Flock & Fowl is a small restaurant with a very modest number of tables and seats (I counted about 20), with a very small menu of 3-5 items, it should still be on every Yelper's radar of places to try.  I really enjoyed my experience at Flock & Fowl, and I think you will too.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,14,9,4,XYfTlw5hmgE_EZcZDljT7g

A little restaurant the size of a cafe in the middle of a run down looking strip mall on the northern side of Sahara at Industrial. Inside, the vibes were chill and I noticed the tea selection and minimal decor.

Jenny took care of me. She was great, always moving in earnest, showing great concern for her guests' experience. Paid up front and waited patiently yet hungrily for my food.

Every time the food is brought out, Jenny tells her guest a bit about it. I got the Hainan Chicken - 1\2 dark and 1/2 white Free range chicken from a ranch in San Wakeen, CA...sliced and deboned; three types dipping sauce (dont remember names, but garlicky, sweet/salty, and spicy); and rice fried in chicken fat. 

It felt like I was on a date and forming an intimate relationship with this chicken that was laid on front of me. I listened to songs by Marvin Gaye and John Legend playing softly in the back as I contemplated how to dip and dress this most savory and moist chicken.

TL:DR Great chicken. Awesome food. 11/10 Would eat again and brining friends to start the Flock & Fowl chicken cult.",thCcBj33p7vLa9eSNKuupQ,1,1,5,epcTNqF5QFD787e6UukRBA

I ordered the chicken tenders with rice and added the broth and an egg. The tenders were delicious, with a light crispy batter on the outside. I liked the ginger sauce best. Rice was awesome, I definitely reached my carb intake for the day here lol. My friends ordered the hen with salad and the Indonesian fried rice.  The teas were really good as well. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable. A good amount of the menu is organic- huge plus.  We left very satisfied!",lx51rqUtlmoTxWs9RZu1uA,0,0,5,UTIGUqKUqPrikPbTMvn_tg

I've only eaten the salad here (trying to keep it light) and I'm never disappointed. Everything is fresh, flavorful, and in season. I like that every time I order the salad it's a little different. Keeps my tastebuds interested. The chicken is very good, moist and flavorful. 

Service is always fine, all of the staff are friendly and helpful.  If you want to come here during peak lunch time, I suggest calling ahead and taking your food to go, there are only a handful of tables here. This is not the lunch spot where you can chill and catch up with friends. Also, food can sometimes come out slowly due to the busyness so if you don't call ahead be prepared to wait a while. 

Flock & Fowl has limited business hours so be sure to check ahead of time (they're closed on Mondays!).",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,1,4,H3N7EdR1f0zhCY8FPwovbg

Situated in a very unassuming strip mall very close to the strip on Sahara, Flock & Fowl always serves up excellent chicken dishes with a smile. Every dish is hand-crafted simplistic perfection. Less is more is the name of the game here. The menu is not extensive but that's the beauty of it. Sheridan focuses on making each dish beautiful, delicious and impactful. I'm always excited for every new venture of his and look forward to the new location opening up in DTLV very soon as well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,10,5,Y8d4TUEMKkiaUhs4bjbYyQ

Place was standing room only during lunch and no one was unhappy about it.  Simple ingredients done well.  Expect a wait for a table during peak lunch.  Food is ready pretty quickly for to go.  Look for Golden Steer and work your way west in parking lot to find this gem.",vQbh6sw0QPZH4DBUOtEtqA,0,0,5,8NF-5eTI7ZzMIaum0J8UlA

The atmosphere was super pleasant, with a caring team that wants you to be happy and fed well.

I highly recommend the Hainanese chicken rice w/ poached chicken and Thai caramel chicken wings

Every component of the rice was perfectly done, combining into a symphony of deliciousness. I know that sounds absurd but it's really really good with seemingly simple ingredients. I put everything together and it was awesome.

The chicken wings were stellar. 

Only regret is that I didn't get egg in my rice!",95L-Gt8omF0jutek5WxBtA,1,3,5,siJJ3gdwcSEz3KXySP_55w

Fried chicken wings are so-so, bao are good but not spectacular. The stand out items are the chicken and rice obviously, fried chicken sandwich, and the flock and fowl salad! Limited seating in this small place make taking orders to go a good idea. Take out through online app only it seems. NO BABY CHAIRS.",m8LtB4wEarC2_RiXlkJIFA,4,0,4,6S3sK6zhznd4Dnj4JOocKw
