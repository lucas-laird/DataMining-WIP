When I came home with my order, opened the boxes the pizzas looked alright until I got to the CHICKEN WINGS more like hairy/boney wings! The worst wing experience ever! They had no meat and looked disgusting! Will never go back there again! Not even for FREE!",Z0rmaHGgm_h2qfzs1ynR-Q,2,1,1,eutNlTkWmUfasYFQEvFaLg

The only thing I dislike is the girls who answer the phone are very rude , 
They do not greet you when they answer the phone all they say is sofias , I constantly had to say ""Hello"" to make sure I was still on the line ! Very poor customer service ! The food is really good though.",N6i61YxNsmOhW8hrW9KnDg,0,0,3,mf_UzvujU4tPPkQ2T338vw

Frozen Costco or Sam's club meatball and sausage, #10 can of Marinara sauce ( No gravy here I was draining water off the sides of meat balls  and sausage and my Lasagna with meatballs.) The lasagna cheese was sour and they forgot my extra Garlic bread, the remembered to charge me for it though! Store closed when I got my delivery and calling both numbers did not allow for voicemail for my concerns.

1708665,2014-02-06,1,hvuKpdYWyoFm6abwfQiipQ,"They don't sell pizza by the slice, so I ordered an Italian sub instead.  Sadly, I neglected to refrain from putting mayo on it (which I shouldn't have to do, since an Italian sub should NEVER be made with mayo, but rather oil and vinegar on the bread).  The sub was ok, but the mayo really wrecked it.  It might have been great; maybe I'll give them another try some day.  

Staff were friendly; it didn't take long to get my food (I was the only customer there).  The TV was off when I arrived, but they turned it on while I was waiting; apparently they thought I would enjoy seeing a meth-head get arrested on ""COPS"" while they made my lunch; I preferred ""off.""

Seating consists of 3 formica booths that each seat 4 people; it seems like most of their business is take-out or delivery.  You *could* eat here, but the ambiance would hardly be charming.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,2,0,4,cT50yXgfVH3FXtP79Aa-3Q
1868769,2016-08-20,0,hvuKpdYWyoFm6abwfQiipQ,"The pizza is pretty good, definitely one of the best in the area. Sometimes its a little greasy, and the mushrooms are canned, but good other than that. The service isn't the best though... We tried to use the Yelp coupon for 1 dollar off of every 10 spent, and they said they don't accept coupons. My total was $28, so it would have been 2 dollars. Good customer service says, give the small discount; but not them.

2639646,2015-03-13,0,hvuKpdYWyoFm6abwfQiipQ,"Customer service was very pleasant, young lady who took my phone order was very nice and in person was nice as well.

Ordered the ""Sofia"" and since I am a fan of Italian and New York  pizzas I base all my pizza reviews on those styles.

First the pizza looked ok and they did not skimp on the toppings,  the first bite tasted ok until I started getting into the ground beef and Italian sausage which tasted like meat substitutes.

The vegetables were cut so unevenly the their texture ranged from raw to overcooked.

The crust was a good vessel and stood up to all the toppings and cheese but was extremely bland.

The sauce was average and fairly acidic.

When canned mushrooms work I am a fan, and these canned mushrooms worked in fact if I ordered this pizza without ground meat toppings this combination pizza the  ""Sofia"" would have been good but it's just ok.",GMCWCH7hJ25BaZTZxyrEvw,0,0,2,shg2n4UeiS56yH9gKfbfiQ

It did take them over an hour for delivery but that was fine. My complaint is when we called on Friday to order again the guy that answered just said ""hello"" and was really rude. I told him I wanted a delivery and he asked where and I told him and he said ""No to far"". I explained we just ordered a couple days ago and he said ""No to far"", almost mad and yelling. I said the driver gave us 10 menus for next time and he again said ""no"" and then he hung up on me. Very rude service and we will not be back.",8HLZTMjLK4ILflTuqQR96g,2,1,1,oONUWmYMEWh1LmTgY4ummA

Food/Drink: 3/5

Atmosphere: 3/5

""Hole in the wall with great food.""

Food/Drink: ordered a water but was not directed to where to grab my bottle from. Found out that refrigerator was broken and all of the bottles were warm. They gave me cold water in a cup instead from a dispenser behind the counter. Also, my salad was fresh and a very large portion (can't complain)

Service: Pretty good, everyone was very nice.

Atmosphere: the floors and walls could use a good cleaning to remove black markings

Price: I paid around $8.50 for a salad. McDonald's is cheaper 

Parking: Good but keep your car where you can see it since this place is in the hood.

MY THOUGHTS? I'll come back if in town again and craving a last minute large and fresh salad.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Don't mind the panhandlers in the front...it's all part of the scene",nY9FUScv1oLEo-XNjOcr4g,1,1,3,qa6gUaKRjnkWMixdX0ezPA
