We were a party of 7 and none of us had anything really good to say about the place.  It's true, they have real grass.  Otherwise, it was uncomfortable, service was slow, and the band was REALLY bad.   It was too loud and the Amp crackled making the singer's voice even worse than it actually was. The staff seemed disorganized.  I wanted a glass of wine, and my choice was one red wine and based on how long it took us to just get drinks, we were concerned that we wouldn't get or food in time to catch our show after. There was no ""people watching"" from this vantage point, although, passers-by were able to lean against the fence from main street and watch us.  My German Brat wasn't bad, but I there are definitely better ones out there and I wouldn't go out of my way to go to the Bier Garten again, not with so many other choices.",h334VT43xjYg-k6i7vb6AQ,1,0,2,wgTgKxxH99L_n0FkpaOnLQ

The outdoor area is truly a gem downtown and the casual picnic table style seating on top of real grass is a real treat.  The ample outdoor space makes up for the limited indoor seating.  Although the place was empty given that it was a Monday, the weather was enjoyable to sit outside and enjoy some people watching.   The beer menu offers an extensive selection of micro brews and European (mostly lovely Belgian beers) drafts.  Tonight I chose a Banana Bread flavored brew and I have to say it was not bad.  With its subtle hint of banana the beer was smooth and fruity without losing its ""beerness"".  The service tonight was also exceptional even if it was only one cutie manning the joint. The bartender was cute, courteous and professional.

     Allison R.
     2.0 star rating
     9/23/2014

     ""Boring, small and nothing to say about it.... slow service.... no atmosphere.... food wasn't anything specials... not worth going out of your way for!"" 

Allison, I agree.

I would have given this place 1 star except I actually liked the food. The service was SUPER slow. We were there for more than an hour, and all we had were 2 wursts (The Stardust and The Golden Slipper) and 4 beers. The wursts came with sides, so we ordered the fries and the onion strings and split them both. Lots of food for the price ($7.99 each), and as I said, it was pretty tasty, although The Golden Slipper would have been better if the fried egg on it wasn't so overcooked.

The slow service was bad enough, but even worse was the fact that we had to pay $5 to park at the Plaza. The sign on the shack said the fee would be reimbursed with restaurant validation, so we showed our waiter the parking receipt and asked to be validated. He said to go through the casino to Pop-Up Pizza. So we figured that's where the validation was. Wrong. That's where the VALET PARKING was. So we didn't get validated and we had to eat a $5 fee to park.

I'll never understand why downtown Las Vegas charges for parking, but that's one of the reasons we seldom go downtown. And although the food at the Bier Garten was fine, it certainly wasn't working paying a $5 surcharge to eat it. Or to wait an hour to get it. If you're staying at or near the Plaza, by all means check it out. Otherwise, I said NEIN.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,2,035fqklkAcyiZI3dYAtzTw

This place is located in the Plaza Hotel, accessible via the casino/food court area or through a gate outside. 

This place isn't big but it has a lot going on in terms of beer selection and backyard games. Here's my rundown:
-Local beer (think Teneya Creek)
-Beer pong 
-Cornhole boards
-Outdoor Jenga 
-LED tree outside that changes colors 
-Indoor and Outdoor televisions 
-indoor bar sitting, indoor tables, and outdoor sitting 
-music that isn't overpowering, so you can hear what your company is saying!

Overall, this is a nice place to stop for a beer (served in plastic cups- so you can walk around outside with your drink!) & play some backyard games!  This place is a winner over Gold Spike because the volume of the music allows you to hear conversations and it's a little more accessible and laid back :-)",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,1,0,5,QP9xeStXPzo-l_MmURd2Sg
2036390,2015-06-02,2,3QzPhQ3ltbon0-1gC7Q18Q,"I had much higher hopes. But this is just a run-of-the-mill, a-ok, average, casino quick-serve spot. It's inside The Plaza. There's an outdoor area with real grass, which is kinda the highlight of this place. There's long, picnic-like tables and great people-watching. The inside area is a bar with some high-top tables around it. There's no table service, you have to order and pick-up at the bar. The beer offerings are better than average, but nothing near what you'd expect from a beer place. The do definitely have some good tap, though. The menu is primarily sausages, as well as a giant pretzel and some other items. It's like American-ized, quick-serve, sorta-German-ish food. There's several sausage options with a variety of toppings, which is nice. And if you get a signature sausage, it comes with fries and a beer, making it a pretty good deal at less than $8. However, you don't get a choice as to which beer. When we were here, there was just one bartender and one cook, which definitely seemed under-staffed. But the bartender was friendly and acknowledged everyone even if she couldn't get to you right away. All in all, it's an alright spot.

In addition to an indoor seating area, It will have an outdoor courtyard, so you can watch downtown Las Vegas go by while you sip your beer.

There is good people watching from here.  I had a Shiner's Bock, and it was interesting, to say the least, to sip it as I watched pedestrians going up and down Main Street.

I had not eaten because I knew that I wanted to eat at the Beer Garden. I had pulled some friends and suggested we go eat the brats or the pretzel and have a Micro beer. So we sat outside and waited as we people watched and eventually after about 20 minutes realized that they were not going to serve us outside. So we came in and just as I did, there he goes outside. I dont think he was going to serve, just to clean up but I waited inside. After about 5 minutes he came back in and asked for the happy hour [that was advertised] menu. He said that they did not have one, they only had a grilled cheese or chicken fingers with fries. So I said the brats and pretzel are full price to which he informed me that they did not have those items any more. Maybe in the summer they will bring them back. WHAT!

So get all those pictures of those pretzels and big brats and take them off because they are gone. So I say, how much is the grilled cheese and he tells me $9. I can get full dinner plates for that price at 50 places within 100 yards. So I tell him, never mind but what happy hour specials do you have on beer. Yeah, you can get Rolling Rock, Bud LIght... I didnt hear what else he said because I asked him what Micro Beers do you have on special.

NONE. Yup, this micro beer haven that advertises a Happy Hour will not give you a dime discount on their micro beers.I didn't want to hear about Bud Light. Are you kidding me.

I'm pretty glad that they had a bunch of stouts on tap, because I usually can only find Guinness as the only stout available at places. So for me, getting to try a sample of each one they had on tap was pretty great. I ended up settling for this Peanut Butter stout that I didn't catch the name of, but it tasted very smooth & defined. I guess it's what you would expect out of a peanut butter stout. 

They have a small indoor section as well as an outdoor seating area that's nice & well-kept, which is something you wouldn't expect from Downtown. This place has your standard beer garden games like, cornhole & Jenga. There's a lot of TV's outside. They also have an LED tree that's pretty cool to look at.

One last thing: Just stick to the beer here. Their mixed drinks are watered down as hell.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,12,12,4,qvj1ORUi5QWidh1l-TLS1g

I have been at the plaza 2 weeks and this bars always dead.   There isn't any good music of a feel.  The bar area with the liquor is stale and seems empty.   I tried the food but it was so salty and over cooked.  I enjoy the beers but I was always the only guy at the place.  
Today I want to have a good beer and a young guy was bartending.   He was leaned over the bar texting and didn't notice me.  I LEFT!   Sorry to bother you with my money.   
If I left the owners can bet others do to!  I don't allow cell phones at my store and not sure why they do.  Stand at the bad smile and make eye contact with the hundreds of people who walk by them.   Invite people in.  Make some money!   Absent management sure to lead to a failure.",xylHgwHAf_T3Gy7YZ65eBw,0,0,2,aKS5UOo1GqQeZTJ8kjp_9w

5604186,2015-10-08,2,3QzPhQ3ltbon0-1gC7Q18Q,"It's a nice little unpretentious drop by spot, you can either take a seat and people watch, or grab a quick brew to go. Sadly, kids aren't allowed inside, not even on the patio, they would have actually really liked the food selection. 
 That's the only thing that kept us from eating here, so we had to grab dinner elsewhere to accommodate the family. 
 However, I did take a Pranqster from North Coast Brewing Co. to go, never heard of it before, turned out to be a delicious wheat. Will now look for it, it was fresh, smooth, very tasty. 
 The girl working the counter was very sweet and super friendly, the patrons seemed to be having a great time. Definitely a return to place in the future, hope to try the food and experience the patio next time.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,3,3,4,KjR9f1IrcDgIvRl6S-MZeA

The beer is a good price ($6 for an IPA pint) The bar staff was very enthusiastic and fun. Enjoy it. Would recommend a stop in of you are down in old Vegas.,2m44NBBJCcff2c22JwQ0zA,0,0,5,IxHWrexidKe6pSgiGV3Ehw

It is located next to the food court and is a step above your basic food court options. They were working on the patio area, adding more grass, but it looked really cool. There are TV's and a cute little structure outside, but I didn't see any fans or misters. This may be a cool area to hang out at night or in the spring or fall. The indoor seating area is actually quite small, there are maybe 5 tables, but there is a ton of counter seating. 

The waitress/bartender was SUPER nice and attentive. She greeted us and walked us through the menu. I don't drink beer, but they had an elderberry cider on the menu so I decided to give it a try. It was delicious and I'm happy they try to cater to everyone. We started with the giant pretzel and it could easily feed more than 4. The pretzel was warm and super tasty. The German sweet mustard on the side was a perfect accompaniment and made us all very happy. I ordered the Stardust and it was very large. It also came with my choice of fries, crispy onions, or coleslaw. In my world only fries exist, so that was an easy choice. The sausage was flavorful, but there was a bit too much bun. I wish the onions were a bit more caramelized, but the flavor was really great. The fries were crispy and delicious and there was the perfect amount on the side. Overall, we were really happy with the meal and experience. I would definitely come back in the evening to enjoy the outdoor space with a brat and a beer (or cider).",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,4,2,4,ksY6x0D15anW2wSZ1S-K1Q
