Service: We got one of those small table for two. after serving the drinks, our server disappear. She never came back to take the plates. If I remember right it use to be her job.  
The food: most of the items were over cooked to a degree that they were uneatable.

We heard the lines were long because of a number events in Vegas.  We decided instead to go to an old favorite, the Sante Fe buffet.  What a mistake!  We were amazed at how far it had fallen in the last few months since we last visited it.  We understand the economics of a buffet, and the somewhat tough economic times,  but they cut corners way to far.  Poor selection, low quality and unappealing presentation. The didn't even have my favorite, sausages and peppers which almost every buffet has. The service was spotty, but acceptable. Since it was Saturday, we didn't have two-fers and paid full freight.

644055,2014-01-09,0,lokPfoken16iTeAJ2PAwmQ,"Okay so the only reason I would and did come here is because with a 2 for 1 coupon (dinner for two was about $12.00 including drink and tip) and it is convenient for me. I would not stand in line for this place or go under other circumstances. I should preface this by stating as a general rule I do not like buffets, of course, there are exceptions i.e. Bacchanal, thai or indian lunch buffet. However, for the price (with coupon) who couldn't pass up a okay salad bar and a drink. The majority of the food is barely edible, sometimes the mexican and the chinese food is okay (at best). I think once in awhile the prime rib is okay (of course you have to assess if it is medium rare before they cut it). Tonight they served roast beef so I took a pass on that. The salad bar is not as good as Sweet Tomatoes as to variety but they have the usual fair - iceburg lettuce, spinach, cherry tomatoes, onions, croutons, broccoli salad and the like. How can you screw up salad? 

The servers are attentive and the dining room is clean which is a plus. I have been to some buffets where this is lacking in both respects. 

I don't find the dessert area appealing - the ice cream has a decent flavor but there is something about the texture that screams powdered milk product to me - the texture is somewhat grainy and leaves a slight filmy feel in my mouth if  I recollect correctly.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,2,uWiWXMstlsGlQ7vMpGFoqQ

Longest wait EVER considering we went there for breakfast and didn't even get seated till after noon. We ordered 2 $.99 Margaritas - they couldnt get the machine to work because it was frozen so refunded our money.  Off to a good start already.  We all scurried to get our food as we were all starved.  Had we known the wait would be that long we probably would have gone somewhere else.

This place is a typical everyday boring buffet.  It seemed everything I chose was hard as a rock - rolls, pizza, potstickers....just simply not consumable...and being that the place was so busy you wouldn't think anything would be there long enough to get hard.  Dumbfounded. The sausage gravy had instead of ground sausage had 3 inch chunks of linked breakfast sausage.  It seemed so wrong and gross.  Ugh.  Not even to mention the gravy needed stirred...bad.  I went up to the meat counter where the guy was slicing the meat for people.  I asked for turkey and he slapped a piece of completely uneatable raw bloody prime rib right in the middle of my plate.  Thanks for listening Mr. Man.  I guess I should pay better attention or else he should.

The waitress was pleasant though.  The company was great.  The food not so much....I'm giving a one star to the 1/2 of a donut I indulged in at the end.

The place was filled with customers but fairly quiet when I was here for lunch - many seniors. Counter cleanliness could use some improvement. Table service was okay.

Sunday brunch was great. The Feast Buffets are always clean. Our server was also fantastic. The reason this is 4 stars is because our service was great, the price was right, and we even had a special buy one get one free pass. 

They have their usual international selections. I always try to taste something from every section. And I have to say, there wasn't anything that I didn't really like. I was surprised to see lettuce wraps as an item in the Asian section. That was good. And I know fried chicken is just fried chicken, but theirs was good.

It's okay. I mean, it's only $9.99, so how can you complain. (I guess)
I try and stick to the roast beef or turkey and then make my own salad. 
But honestly, most of the other things that I've tried there have been marginal, at best. 
Pad Thai tastes NOTHING at all like Pad Thai, egg rolls are completely pasty inside and have no flavor. The beef and broccoli is always terribly overcooked, rendering the broccoli pretty much inedible. In fact, their vegetables across the board are usually overcooked and utterly bland. 
I do like the BBQ pork, the beef fajitas and the pork asada. And my boyfriend is easy to please because all he ever wants is hamburgers, pizza and spaghetti, which he claims they do quite well, but his standards are dismally low, so I take that with a grain of salt. (he's not much of a foodie, much to my dismay.)
One thing I can say is that the service is always good....with dirty plates taken away quickly and drinks refilled fairly often. 
I guess the bottom line is that I've paid a lot more on the strip for buffets that were certainly no better, so it's a good deal, all in all. (Kind of.)",0ZOt5C0H0HgOIJ3fBj361g,1,0,2,7J8iLTOGGPPWZ7SotVtXUQ

They have a pretty solid Mexican station. And I don't mean the yellow cheese sauce and ground beef. Skip those and head on over to the chile verde and carnitas. Bf had an ingenious idea to get some of the chiliquiles and top them with the chile verde. Also lots of toppings to add on, incl real guacamole, not some thinned out watery green sauce, pickled carrots/onions.

Carving station had ham, turkey, and roast beef. All very good, and none of it dry.

The dining area is spacious and clean and the decor is nicely done.

I would recommend this to anyone if in the area.

The hotel/casino is a bit of a distance from the strip but well worth the visit.

Over 10 mins go by and no one came by to take our drink orders. Numerous servers passed us since we were by where the drinks come out at. After 10 minutes I found another hostess and asked her how we get drinks since it's been over 10 minutes. She rudely said ""they will bring them to your table"" and ran off. Didn't care at all about customer service. After 15 mins of sitting there, finished our plate of food we finally got our sodas ordered. She was okay with bringing them out after.

The cashiers were super nice, engaging and complete with a genuine smile.

My hostess was completely different. No personality, though polite. I was so hungry I wanted to go start checking out the food, so I asked the hostess if she could get me an ice tea.

She told me, ""You can order that when your server comes."" In a tone of voice that resonates, ""that's not my job""

Woah. Guess who hates their job.

I stood by my table and my server arrived, I order my drink and went to get my grub on.

Everything looked ok, nothing really stood out as eye popping - most people eat with their eyes.

The BBQ / Hamburger station was average. I was grabbing some mashed potatoes with beans when the Customer next to me asked for fresh baked chicken. The chef pulled out a big metal tin from what I assumed has been sitting in a warmer, by the looks of the chicken in it, it looked like the chicken has been sitting for awhile. 

Skip the roast chicken. 

Next segment was the Asian offerings. There's a build your own Pho. There were 2 huge rice pot warmers, one for white rice and the other for fried rice. I love fried rice, so I grabbed a bowl and opened the pot.

Yikes! I quickly closed it because it looked like mush with vegetables. Skip the fried rice.

There's a Mexican station, It didn't look very promising. There were ore made tostadas and quesadillas but you can look at the tortilla and the topping were dried up and crusty.

Moving on...

The carving station looked great! They had turkey breast, roast beef, and meatloaf.

Meatloaf? That's new.

I asked for a piece of meatloaf and roast beef. The chef gave me such a thin slice of meat loaf that it crumbled in my plate.

I asked politely if I could get another piece.  He did the same thing, sliced it so thinly that the loaf crumbled on my plate. Now I have a small pile of meatloaf mess. Unbelievable.

My roast beef slice was so thinly sliced as well. They should just serve deli meat or find a new chef who knows how to properly cut a piece of meat.

Their dessert selections are probably the most impressive part of their buffet offerings. Even the salad bar looked depressing.

I sat at my table eating the few things I thought were good. That would be mac n cheese, select vegetables, my meatloaf crumbles, one piece of fried chicken, au gratin potatoes and hush puppies.

Actually the hush puppies were mush but it was a tasty mush.

The whole time I sat at my table, my server never came back to check on me.

My final summation is don't eat here. On purpose. 

Honestly, if I was the F&B manager here, I would be embarrassed to even offer and operate a place like this.

We had stopped by the previous day and the line was so long, we turned around and walked out. I guess we weren't the only ones who got the free buffet. This time the line was much shorter, with only a few parties in front of us. After a few minutes, I realized the line was not moving. It stayed at a virtual stand still for a good fifteen minutes. No movement whatsoever. When we finally got close enough to the register to see what was going on, the cashier, Maria, was shuffling through what looked like stacks of receipts and coupons, ignoring the customers in line. Finally,  another employee, Glenda, came to the register and told Maria she could ring some people up while Maria continued to look for whatever was so important that they were losing money and people were walking away. Maria declined and continued to stand right in front of the register, looking  and looking and looking, all the while ignoring the customers in line. Glenda tells her again, ""I can ring some people up while you look."" Again, Maria declines and goes on about looking for the all important piece of paper. Throughout the entire ordeal, Maria did not once acknowledge the customers in line. Finally, she appears to be ready to ring us up. The Mrs. hands Maria the coupon, casino card and money. The Mrs. Also gives her our drink order, as adult beverages are not included. Maria then turns away and starts looking through papers again. Finally, Maria rings it up, but has forgotten the drinks and bonus points that come with the cards. Maria then comes at the Mrs. with attitude and tells her ""you didn't order drinks."" When we eventually made it to our seats, I asked to speak with a supervisor. Glenda showed up at our table. Yes, the same Glenda who told Maria she would ring people up, only to be ignored. Glenda apologized and acknowledge Maria's attitude and disregard for the customers, but stated she did not want to reprimand her in front of others. Glenda assured us she would address it.
 
You would think that a casino that claims to ""love locals"" would put a huge emphasis on customer service. I see absolutely no reason or excuse for Maria's attitude and poor customer service. The buffet was what you would expect and on par with what it normally rolls out. However, having it to do all over, I would forgo this experience and pay full price elsewhere. My time is worth much more than a free buffet and I definitely could have gone without the attitude and poor customer service. The fact that Glenda stopped by the table and took the time to listen to our complaint along with her assurance she would address it, saves this from being a one star review.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,2,0,2,mko1VzYekS-yiubZXKPwtQ

Item 1: Rewards person went up and down the isles asking the white people in line if they needed a rewards card while ignoring the colored people (meaning blacks and browns. I'm hispanic and my friends are black) It was extremely disgusting watching this going on in America now a days.

Item 2: People in this buffet line were too comfortable and disregarded personal space.

Item 3: Sat us in the back next to the staff entrance and bathroom exit as if there weren't any other tables available. (There were, I checked).

Item 4: The waiter simply took our drink order, fulfilled it and never came back to check on us. We were the ones that had to call him over or one of the other waiters several times in order to get refills or napkins. (Mind you we only had a party of 4)

Item 5: We noticed that when his friends, family or relatives came in he was at their every beck and call. Not trying to be mean but I don't think employees are supposed to wait on acquaintances.

4014488,2016-01-27,5,lokPfoken16iTeAJ2PAwmQ,"OK, as a Station Casino club member (it's FREE), I'll readily admit we get at least two buy one, get one free buffet coupons just about every month (for very little slot play time I might add).  So to save some duckets, the fam & I will often choose a Station Casino property to have a value breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  A penny saved, folks!

That being said, we often choose to use our coupons at Station Casino properties like the Red Rock or if we're feeling adventurous Green Valley Ranch (yes, driving to Henderson is an adventure for us fuddy-duddys).  However, since we live close to Santa Fe Station we often end up going here for a quick meal.  I've been coming here for years now and for some reason have no clue why I don't have a review for their Feast Buffet.  Plus, I could've swore I had pics here from our most recent dining experience there but I can't find them AT ALL on my phone.  So much apologies for no pics!  You Yelpers will just have to use something rarely seen, YOUR IMAGINATION (no need for Temptations flashbacks, y'all)!

The Feast Buffet at Santa Fe Station is like every other Feast Buffet at every other Station Casino property - BUSY.  Go on a weekend?  Busy.  Go on a specialty weekend dinner?  Busy.  Go on a holiday specialty weekend dinner like Thanksgiving or Christmas?  Busy!  It's busy for the sheer quantity of food a Feast Buffet can put out, and man do they know how to feed the masses!  Not only that, but price-wise...it's Hella cheap!  I mean, only in Vegas right??  Where else you gonna go for an all-you-can-eat breakfast for around $8 a person, $7 if you got your Station Casino club card?  Plus a bonus coupon for a free buffet?  Plus FREE entry for any kid under 2 years old?  Nowhere!  You think you can pull this off at your local IHOP or Denny's?  Hell to the NO!  For families with kids or for families that make a limited amount of income, a cheap buffet is a value treat that will keep a belly full & a crying kid quiet.  Think about it, feed your kid a 'value' meal from Mickey D's...or let them run the gamut at the Feast Buffet for the same price?  Yep, the true value is clear.

But, that doesn't mean Feast Buffet here puts out the quality of food you really want.  That's not to say that they put out low-quality food either...it just means it's all...inconsistent.  Some days the salad will be good & fresh, other days it will be a tad wilted.  The mac & cheese will be delicious some days and on others it will be watery.  One day the roast beef will be done just right at a medium, the next it will be cooked to a near crisp.  The fried shrimp was tasty the one time, but the next it was damn near a rubber ball.  You get my drift here.  A lot of the food is cooked in-house, and with the right care from the chef (yes, some of them are really chefs) it tastes pretty darn good.  But there are some of the line cooks (yes, I consider the unloving one cooks) who just don't give a $hi+ and put out food just to get people out of the damn feed line.  And yes, some of the food does come out of plastic bags!  You think someone cracked all those eggs individually to make the scrambled eggs on the buffet line?  Nope!  It comes from a huge bag of pasteurized egg mix, which is then poured into a pan then cooked like scrambled eggs.  The shu mai or steamed buns you see in the Asian section?  They come from a frozen tray!  Yep it's all true, I've seen them do it with my own eyes.  

Although it goes without saying, you come to a Feast Buffet to mainly fill your gullet & not worry about farm-to-table cooking.  This is the blessing of a Feast Buffet, to try and give you a better option over a fast-food meal.  It may not be the healthiest way to go, but for the median cost it sure is a viable choice.  It's not the best stuff I've ever eaten, but I am grateful for places like this in Las Vegas.  For us middle-class cheap folks, it's a Godsend!  Like manna from Heaven!  I mean seriously, eating at the Feast Buffet for breakfast or lunch is actually cheaper than a full entrée at your local chain restaurant!  Chef will make you a cooked-to-order omelet for breakfast, or custom pasta dish for lunch?  How you gonna beat that value?     

I got one more way for you cheapies out there to save even MORE money at a Feast Buffet.  See how breakfast ends at 11 AM and lunch starts at 11 AM?  Go for a late breakfast at 10 AM, by the time you are seated you get the last run at breakfast...then your go sign at lunch when 11 AM hits!  Saved you $2 right there!  Pay the breakfast price, stay for the lunch rush!  More bling in your pocket!

I just wish the food was cooked with a bit more care on some of the stations.  Overall, I cannot complain about this Feast Buffet.  It has served my family well for some time now, and has helped us maintain some sanity in those lean times when we were down on income.  

Improve the quality of the food offerings and you might just get your extra star back!

This review is for their breakfast buffet, not the dinner.  Bottom line, the Feast Buffet at Santa Fe Station Casino is dirt cheap.  The breakfast buffet cost me only $6.99 and I had a $6 credit voucher.  Do the math. I paid almost nothing for breakfast.  The scrambled eggs are extremely watery, the bacon is way too greasy, the pancakes rubbery, and everything else lacked flavor.  One thing that is good is the made-to-order omelets and the glass of water.  The service is excellent since I served myself.  Other than that, there's not much else to say.

POW!

""Of course not, Boy Slender.  What are potatoes without the meat?  This buffet has meatloaf, two kinds of Italian sausage, smoked sausage, roast beef, and pork roast.""

""But this all seems kind of standard.  Is there anything different that we can eat.""

""Certainly.  The Asian District has pansit noodles and pork adobo.  I see chow mein, pot stickers, egg rolls, white rice and fried rice.  My fat sense tells me there are tacos, tamales, refried beans and rice in Mexico Land.  Down in Little Italy there is spaghetti and meatballs, pizza and creamed spinach.""

""Well I am glad to hear they have spinach but are there any other vegetables to choose from?""

""Dammit man! Look around you.  There is Ceasar salad, green salad, cole slaw, green beans, corn and hominy.""

""Mother of gastronomic redundancy!   Corn and hominy in one dish?""

""Indeed.  Try it, you'll love it.""

""This is great, Fatman.  I'm getting full now but I feel weak.  My sweet tooth needs to be replenished.  Can I find desserts too?""

""Do you even need to ask?  Take your pick.  Pumpkin pie, pecan pie, apple crisp, eclairs, ice cream, carrot cake.  It is all yours for the taking.""

""Thank you, Fatman.  You have given me hope for the future.""

First off,when we got there they promised that they would  give us 35 minutes to eat,they also promised that no food would be taken away,instead we found that half the food was gone.

Second,there was a very rude pasta chef that was ignorant and refused to cook our pasta.This was very rude since all the other Station Casino's buffets cooked without any resistance,even though it was only 8:40.After I complained to the head chef,he hesitated in making the pasta and once We tasted the custom pasta,it turned out that it was the worst pasta we've ever tasted.


Third,At 9:00 about 80% of the food was gone.This was very inconvenient as we were still very hungry and desired dessert.The waitress informed us at 9:20 that it was the last call,as promised by the cashier.ALL OF THE FOOD WAS COMPLETELY GONE. Every chef was gone,All of the machinery was off.


Overall:If you want terrible service and no food that fills you up,then go here,If not then I definitely recommend Fiesta Rancho or Palace Station. Those locations have better service and are significantly cheaper.

LAYOUT
spacious, comfy seating, good selection of foods.

SERVICE/FOOD
i thought the quality of service and food are both good.   i REALLY liked it when Sante Fe Feast Buffet gave it's customers the option of having their Snow Crab Legs flavored with a cajun-like sauce upon request.   i'm not sure if they still offer that as Aliante Feast Buffet stopped offering Snow Crab and i think Santa Fe Feast Buffet may have also.???

NOTE* Santa Fe/Feast Buffet -- also gives it's military members a free meal on Veterans Day.   thanks.^^

PRICING
average cost...  think $25.??

4632221,2012-11-05,3,lokPfoken16iTeAJ2PAwmQ,"Maybe my experience at Caesar's Palace's Bacchanal Buffet conditioned me to expect the same exemplary quality from other Vegas buffets. Not a smart mindset. This was right along the average line and 'typical' is the word. My uncle took a bunch of us from our church choir to celebrate his birthday and everyone was excited for lunch. I envisioned just as much diversity here and was already itching to hoard the dessert area. When we got there, my father, the big crabs legs fan, walked from one end of the buffet counter to another in hopes of seeing his glorious, scrumptious crabs to no avail. So he settled with crispy shrimp and roast beef instead. 

I tried bite-sized bits of almost everything. Some lettuce & spinach soup for appetizer. Second helping consisted of fried rice, crispy shrimp, chicken and cream, BBQ pork, broccoli and a couple of fortune cookies (just for the sake of reading a fortune). Last 2 walk backs were solely for dessert, considering how much of a sweet tooth I am. The best part of the buffet was probably the mint chocolate chip ice-cream and according to one of my friends, the coconut cream pies. They weren't exactly top-notch, but for $9.99, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Then again, there is no real division between the buffet area from the casino so you can expect some insidious cigarette smokes to seep in your eating area. 

On the upside, champagne is served for free and the day ended with a nice toast to my uncle.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,3,2,3,bEojyjjlHYp5JWo46CTZIw
4655164,2015-10-08,9,lokPfoken16iTeAJ2PAwmQ,"2.5 STARS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT $15.99 DINNER

    Following hours of hiking up in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I decided to make the Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet my post - hike supper. This review is testimony that I should of picked one of a hundred other restaurants for dinner. I have a frustrating relationship with Feast Buffets. Sometimes they are rewarding dinners in Boulder Station and Red Rock Resort Feast Buffets or poor experiences in this Feast Buffet for example. This is my second time here in person and the first time as a Yelper. My first experience was around 2009 before the remodel. I attempted to try it in 2012, but in the 24/7 City of Las Vegas they shut down at 9:00 on Saturday night.

   There was a moderate line to pay for the buffet. Nothing like the lines I have stood on at Red Rock, Sunset, Boulder Station, or Green Valley Ranch Feast Buffets. The $15.99 plus taxes brought my Saturday night special dinner to $18 before the tip. The deal was there was nothing special about this Saturday night special that was advertised steak and seafood night. There was zero value to the meal. Unless I was missing something I failed to find a seafood station. The only seafood I saw was the live shrimp scampi at the Italian foods station. Where was the peeled shrimp? I really dislike the steak and seafood gimmick that many casino operators use to jack up the price.

    In general, there was a poor selection of food. Right off the bat I could tell a good buffet from their Asian foods station. I can assert that their sister property Boulder Station has a far better Asian foods station with at least double the selection. In reality, $18 brought me a couple of bowls of wonton soup, cabbage based vegetables  (where is the description of the food?), chow mein noodles, rice, wonton soup, shrimp scampi, cola, coffee, and desert. The food lacked flavor just like the coffee. I only took a few sips of the coffee and said, ""forget this."" Finally, the sushi that Red Rock Feast Buffet (similar price) features is nonexistent here.

     A hardworking yet unfriendly woman served my two colas, cleaned the table, and served my coffee.

    There are two compliments that I will bestow this Feast Buffet. First, the Halloween presentation of the pastries was neat. And second, I appreciated that the wontons are in a separate bowl from the broth. A major complaint I have in regards to their sister Feast Buffet at Sunset Station is that they frequently run out of the wontons.

    Based on my experience of paying close to $20 for a gimmick steak and seafood night, I have to rate it 2.5 stars. If I return on a night when it is $9.99 and get value, I might pen a review update. In conclusion, Station Casinos is their own biggest problem. A few miles south on the 215, their Red Rock Feast Buffet offers far more at a similar price. Most likely I will return to the Red Rock Feast Buffet before I return to the Santa Fe location. In conclusion, Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet can feast on 2.5 stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,6,2,HXOPiIkVlqJC42S4QZ8SDQ

For a Vegatarian there wasn't much to gawk at aside from the giant cold pasta and salad bar in the very center of the room- think they are trying to push the veggies a bit a by having it very accessible to everyone? They have the usual suspects of American (mashed potatoes and fried chicken) Asian (Chow Mein and Orange Chicken) BBQ (self-explanatory) and Italian (Pizza and hot Pasta).
My dishes were mainly composed of potatoes, since they seriously had three different types, a very bland cheesy pasta (it did NOT taste like cheese) vegetable spring rolls w/ sweet and sour sauce, some cheese pizza, some bread, and by far the worst thing ever- salt and pepper fried tofu.
I've had many kinds of fried tofu. I have never had fried tofu that was as bad as this. It was tough. It was dry. It was tasteless. It was sad. We broke open every one of them on my plate, and they were all the same: dead on the inside. 
Finally we left behind our two diet Pepsis and ran over to the dessert area where we filled plates full of pastries. The best one had to be the mini eclairs. Though they were a little on the dry side, they were far more palatable than the soggy cannolis, and nasty tiramisu (seriously, it didn't taste anything like tiramisu, or a dessert). They have fruit and cream pies, but they taste pretty much like they are: out of a can.
The best dessert by far is the ice cream. Though, you have to wait for ten minutes for an employee to waddle over and ask if they can give you a scoop since it is protected by glass. Best way to get their attention? Glare at them from the ice cream. They'll stare back as if waiting for you to get annoyed and go back to your seat without it. But no! Not us!

After she rolled her eyes we politely explained that we paid separately and didn't get the chance to tell Ravynn that we wanted to all sit next to each other and that coworker gladly accommodated us. The only reason I was frustrated because Ravynn was laughing at us. So we requested to speak to a supervisor Alec who was obviously no help. When we tried to explain the situation instead of apologize for his rude employees behavior he decided we needed a lesson in her employment history. Long story short he was incompetent. A greeter Riz was more than helpful and the cashier ladies in the front were great as well.

There are so many other recipes that can't be created at this price point, I would love to see them make an appearance. This place  is geared towards locals and for the most part we know this is the type of experience we expect at this price point. If your not a local don't expect this to be The Bacchanal buffet at Caesars palace or you'll be very disappointed.",sr3ePDrr2mZTUKEa-u_6Jw,1,1,3,liTJtmagd7tC3tbsWoVGAQ

I think we have been to them all at one time or another.
This one is a little better over most of them. 

Sometimes you have a long wait here for dinner.
The service can be hit or miss depending on who you get as with anywhere,

We have had good and bad service here over the years. 

We came one night it happen to be Hawaiian night, Were not crazy about a lot of  Hawaiian dishes but we could not believe they had a whole pig out.
I am surprised it did not cause any problems here.
The pig was cooked perfect and it was really good.

The salad bar is a pretty good size and they usually always have some kind of soup that is really good.

This buffet is usually always clean and well kept. We have never had too many problems other than how fast the service was for cleaning off the tables or getting our drinks.

And you need to make sure it is a night you want what they are serving, the theme of the night.

It is not bad of a buffet we go on and off if were close by. Its not horrible by no means.
Try it out!  ( This is more of a Locals Casino too far from the strip)",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,4,2,3,kdV5lxcvVBzYt4-CxuI7Mw

Please have them take grade school all over.
Non of the employees have communication manners between themselves or with customers.
This place with their pretending executive chef just 
ruined my dining experience.",BgTEmV6LRcbtb-TK9JI6vA,0,0,1,yshHYL4m6PIPsO_3usT9nQ

First thing that I took notice of is the common sense of the staff people. have. The hostess seated us all the way in the back near the wall, but to get there I had to squeeze through other people's chairs with my baby's stroller, ram people in the foot, apologize and manuver through tables. All that and there were open tables up front? Stoopid! Secondly, some of the other restaurant patrons here are rude. They stare you down as you obtain your food or hover right behind you...gross. Next we have the eggs benedict setup, one of my favs! But wait, they've already topped it with the hollaindaise sauce? Yuck, so I get a mushy eggs benedict. When I returned to my table, I found an OJ waiting for me, which was great considering I had a plate full of food that would need to be washed down. Took a sip and blargh! It wasn't just sour, but it tasted nothing like OJ! It was like they mixed it with a secret ingredient that I couldn't even place...All in all, don't think I'd come back here, unless I had no choice.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,2,1,3,x64CBrDNGDAMBsurKyQKjQ
