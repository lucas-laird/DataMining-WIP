663461,2017-04-02,0,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,Paid with my debit card and never received my pizza! Called to speak to the manager and he was so unprofessional. I am very upset and I hope no one goes through the stress and frustration I went through.  Do not order !!!!,p8KqsM2U6_-zFg4c1nDynA,1,0,1,CYdqV8Cd2RCMEpsNfjn2gA
1437669,2016-04-26,0,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,Quality of pizza was about Pizza Hut standard so pretty good. Waiting time was about 20 minutes so not terrible but not great.  Employees were robotic and not personable but efficient. Few good choices at a reasonable price in the casinos. Warning at peak hours this could be a long bad wait.,6zd6v4xPmED7Bs0JlP5pPQ,0,0,3,AXU_UxASf7JyOxkh206EDQ
2120228,2016-07-10,0,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,We decided to have pizza so I got my very first personal pan pizza in my years of life.  It was delicious and then even made my special order with no cheese.  Service was ok and wait time was about 20 minutes.  I would go back to this location.,XJlO3JkonghDu59nmE62Mg,0,0,4,0S28aWfnlgvrvac9UPFInA
3419244,2018-04-15,0,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,So I made my order 7:15 PM for a medium pizza. The gentlemen said it was going to be 15 minutes. So we waited and the crazy part of this wait was everyone who orders after me was getting their pizza. I went and asked the gentleman what happened. He started to talk to the ladies in Spanish not knowing I spoke it. I over heard them say they didn't make it at all. So they said it'll be another 15 minutes by the time we got our order our food we ordered from the other place was cold. Wouldn't come back again! Made us wait 1 hour for some damn pizza. HORRIBLE SERVICE,-Rjin5dN5VQsciVS-ND1Pw,0,0,1,wfXYMNbGS7OJG1XXlVW1Ag
3877412,2017-03-27,0,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,"Pizza Hut ""Express"" inside Excalibur.  Not really ""express"" since nothing was pre-made and under the warmer.  The upside is that my breadsticks were cooked fresh so why am I complaining?",DsKCvpCXcS0tjWwGGnVEsA,0,0,3,leqCwJtzxOe6YKvqBj_WUA
4494864,2014-04-16,0,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,"I guess this place is new, and I couldn't find an existing review page for it... so, I decided to make my own. It was much needed. My boyfriend and I were a bit hungry, so we decided to share something. We decided on pizza, as the price was decent... not, like, $13 for a sandwich. 
When we got up to the register, we were not greeted. There were freakin' three men behind the counter pretending to work and chatting away with each other. One of them even passed by the register a couple times without acknowledging us. My boyfriend wanted to leave, but I didn't want to spend much on food, and pizza sounded good to me. 
Finally, one of the guys washed his hands and took our order, but that was about five minutes after we got to the register! Anyway, we ordered a #5 - small cheese pizza, a drink, and buffalo wings. The food sits under lamps, but still... they tasted pretty good. Fine. You get one star for that. Otherwise, unfriendly employees. Bad service. This place is definitely not worthy of anything other than one star. I'm sorry, but Pizza Hut Express, you should try harder next time.",soXCrtlQ3_z_kBC7OrT-_Q,0,0,1,uCB_vHGr0y5TJMunxVx3mA
4644084,2014-08-06,1,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,"Bad service, long wait times. The cashier was texting when we approached and kept finishing his text before greeting us. Huge no no. He shouldn't even be texting on the job in the first place, but if he is going to text then he should put down his phone immediately when customers approach. This glaring error in basic customer service is costing the restaurant most of it's stars.",rhtps55mnfi2TP6bxn0tIA,1,1,2,RU1FBZwAon1tT_cRaSPMtQ

My husband and I split a personal pan pizza and breadsticks. The breadsticks had been sitting there for awhile and was missing that delicious garlic butter. 

I guess for an overprice ""fast food"" meal check it out.",hzKQOJI8-7TM-BstJpSVCA,3,3,2,V3fE2SJLPTWypwR2iOhRKQ
5477400,2017-09-23,0,mlXQFMNrCFgnOjQhylD9yw,"I went to the restroom in the Luxor restaurant. I noticed and employee a Pizza Hut not wash their hands as they exit the restroom. I went to the manager of the Pizza Hut. And the employee confess that he didn't wash his hands that he only use hand sanitizer her. When I complain the manager just shrugged his shoulders and asked if I had ordered some food there. My quoteto him was ""I didn't order anything here hell no!"" Because I wasn't going to get contagious diseases from an employee not washing their hands. So I made sure to tellThe customers online that the only employee making pizzas did not wash his hands. The manager told me to quiet down. I said I wasn't going to quiet down that these customer should be aware that their employee didn't wash his hands and he was the only cook on duty.",yTwBCU5owi3RvURegI427g,0,0,1,xRefsXMJ-q8S2nngEy1vgQ
