Location is prime. Service is always fairly quick. Hush puppies are crispy and lightly oily - just the way they should be. Clam strips and fish always taste freshly pulled from the oil. My order has always been 100% correct. I've honestly never been disappointed.

Actual customer service could be better. Fast food or not, it's your job to not appear too disgruntled. They get really stingy with the napkins and condiments - particularly tartar sauce. Whenever I politely ask for more, they always give me a pinched faced look and then WHACK! The tartar gets thrown angrily into the bag and shoved out the window.

But I don't care. I'll keep coming back for those delicious hush puppies as long as they stay fresh and cheap.",owlCjxNkDW02M3ABygGgag,1,0,4,bFmv2qOPTEYLBFcqaf16Sg

Don't judge me for ordering chicken at a fried fish joint.  It's actually pretty good (juicy chicken with a crunchy batter that's not greasy).

I wish they'd spruce up a bit so it doesn't look so sad.  A solid three stars for consistency in their food and good, friendly customer service.",KdQq5g7AjZyCrB2gzwHsmQ,2,0,3,GpQbDVO-FM5eLWZ0GZIoqA
2121207,2006-09-30,1,TUfb2lH2nwKqu_IyM8wA-A,Yeah I get my fried fast food fish fix (5Fs!) here whenever I'm in town and around here.  Living in SF you don't get enough junky fast food and LJS definitely hits the spot - always get tons of tartar sauce - oh yeah!,duymKKwUruH8GwbvcaFd0w,0,1,4,vzBqb6MxoW-t6ugDYO41sQ

The ""Yum"" corporation has failed with us on this one!",GMCWCH7hJ25BaZTZxyrEvw,1,0,1,k3n6SMf7-Pxx7sK4-t1OeQ

Went to this store ar12:33 PM today. What a disaster. The fish tasted like chicken, the fries tasted like chicken, the hush puppies (which were under cooked and doughy) tasted like chicken. All of it tasted like the oil was old and over used.  The crab cake tasted like salmon. No excuse for this. The table was dirty and even after being wiped down twice had food and gunk left on it. Both me and my friend both barely made it to a toilet with the runs after eating there. Stay away if you value your health and taste buds.",4GRlseG5W3VgQ0Hd3EmRxg,0,0,1,bmFN3rvvkrraHkXTIukcjA

I was very pleased with this particular location. Look if you're looking for high quality fish or seafood, you have to understand that this is fast food seafood and you wont find it here. BUT I have to say for fast food quality I LOVE LJ Silvers. And my new favorite item to get is their BAJA FISH TACOS!!

What I loved is that normally, I just get the fish platter but today I was feeling like a fish taco, so I rolled into LJS and ordered ONE fish taco to try out, when I got to the window the cashier asked me if it was my first time trying one and I said yes. He simply said ""This one is on the house, if you like it- which you will, come back and see us again"" :D so I got my first Baja Fish Taco Free! and not only that- it was AMAZING! The taco is big! get two and you'll be full. Then theres the sauce they put in it- and ITS AWESOME- has a little spice to it and it's mouth wateringly delicious... JUST TRY IT. You will be pleased!!",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,1,2,4,ttcnCxG_w_U6LD1yn0fytg

Also, looks very clean here. Which is what I look for the most. The tables need constant cleaning though. Everything else pretty good for me so far. . .",Jne7UiKCp_VsSsvh-utyQw,0,0,4,XyJgnxWn2K7GayPRSxtyHg
