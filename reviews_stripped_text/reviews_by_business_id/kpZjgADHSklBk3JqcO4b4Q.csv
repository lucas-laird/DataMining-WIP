The service never got any better.  
The hostess was better suited for an Outback, too casual and familiar for a place with $50 lobster.
Our waitress finally sashayed over with an air of condensation, like we should know who she once was but isn't now.  
Neither the waitress nor the helper cold find the energy to step around next diner when serving the plates and drinks.  He was probably never taught how to serve, she was probably just lazy and annoyed. 
Did I mention that there were only three other diners, a booth of two and a table of one.
The food was fine, exactly what should be expected for those prices.  I had duck and shrimp tacos.

RUDE, NEGATIVE MANAGEMENT WITH INCOMPETENT PEOPLE SKILLS!!!

My fiance and I are getting married on the strip at Caesar's Palace in March. We decided we wanted to do our reception here at Second Street Grille for a party of 22 guests. 

After calling months in advance to place a reservation and talking to 3 different managers (each giving me a different answer on whether or not they could take the party), they decided they DID NOT WANT OUR BUSINESS.

I talked to the Operations Manager by the name of  KIRBY who started off our conversation with a negative and confrontaional tone. He said they will not be taking the party. When I asked for an explanation, I was told they cater to ""high rollers"" and can't accomadate our party. He then continued to talk over me and finally, while I was in mid-sentence, hung up the phone.

I was willing to give this establishment thousands of dollars worth of business, but was turned down because of a unknown reason. I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO NEVER SET FOOT IN YOUR PLACE EVER AGAIN.",L721D9afHL5yRcqZWMCifA,0,0,1,ekk_rJbsmqjkImT5ZaH1Ww

The Second Street Bar & Grill is definitely an upscale treasure sitting cozily in the Fremont Hotel & Casino. Quiet, cozy, and the perfect escape from the casino floor. Casual to upscale attire recommended and this wouldn't be a good place if you have kids. It's somewhere people would go to find a cozy quiet dining experience only feet from the casino floor. 

The grill specializes in American cuisine with Pacific Rim influence including a unique array of fine dishes including steak, fresh seafood and poultry. As an appetizer we had the Hunan pork and beef lettuce wraps. This could easily have been an entree for 2 on it's own. Flavor is top notch and the portion was huge.

As an entree, I had the Alaskan King Crab legs (38) and it was the largest serving of crab, perfectly served, and the BEST crab I've ever eaten in my life. It was a steal at a $38 market price. The crab stuffed prawns (28) were HUGE and just as filling. 

Side dishes, like the salad and baked potato, weren't bad but were average. Dessert, which I barely had room for but couldn't resist, was awesome. I chose the Cheesecake and it was one of the best I have had. Dessert is $4 with purchase of an entree...otherwise it would be $7. Well priced either way. 

Our waiter was Tony, who appeared to be the only waiter on shift. Tony and the busboy were perfectly timed and were on top of everything and everyone dining. 

Be aware that they seem to only be open after 5pm and they are not open every day...reservations don't appear to be necessary but I'd recommend it if you're going to dine there on a Fri, Sat, or Sun.

Spend-o-meter: expect to spend $100 for 1 app, 2 entrees, dessert, and sodas.

For dinner my husband had the rack of lamb which he said was the best rack of lamb he's ever tasted. I ordered the chicken breast that was also super delicious! Desert was delicious we had both the chocolate and raspberry cheesecake. The chocolate too rich for me but the raspberry was perfect! 

Restaurant wasn't too busy for NYE and was very nice and quiet and we really enjoyed the food.

1227506,2009-05-01,0,kpZjgADHSklBk3JqcO4b4Q,"When I go to Vegas, I am there to visit family and enjoy some gambling and food.  I stay and play like a local, so I prefer to spend my time and money Downtown.  The Strip is great for tourists, people who like to party and families with kids, but I am none of those, so I don't miss the glitz and glamour of The Strip.

My favorite upscale restaurant to eat at (and I eat there at least once every visit) is Second Street Grill inside The Fremont Hotel.  It is a Pan-Asian steakhouse with lots of great seafood and steak.  It is a little hard for wheelchairs to get in and out, but they will work with you to make sure everyone is comfortable.  The ambience is classy with low-lighting and the casino noise is pretty much nil (until someone opens the door and even then it's not bad).  The service is usually great (They have occasional slammed-busy nights) and the busboys, waitstaff and hostesses do a great job.

I love the food here - not only is the presentation nice, but the choices are varied and quality is excellent.  There are a few dishes that I have not liked as much as others, but that happens and it's subjective.

Appetizers are big and can be shared between 2 people - I highly suggest the caprese salad ((Fresh tomato slices, chopped basil, balsamic vinegar and beautiful fresh mozzarella cheese) , the soft-shell crabs (Crispy and tender and so flavorful!),  the Peking duck tacos (A little messy, but so yummy!) or the sashimi (Super fresh and delicious).  The shrimp cocktail is also really good with gigantic tiger prawns cooked to tenderness (not rubbery and over-cooked) served with a really good cocktail sauce.

For entrees, the steaks are always good - the filet mignon is tender and flavorful and the New York and Ribeye steaks are big and meaty.  The pork is thick and juicy and the whole fish is really tender and a great presentation.  The only entree I have had where I was disappointed has been the Tempura -- The batter was thick and heavy and I didn't care for it.

One of my favorite entrees is the lobster tail.  The lobster tails are HUGE - I am talking the meat, out of the shell is gigantic.  Not only is the lobster huge, it tastes great and they will remove it from the shell for you if you ask them to.  The drawn butter is served over a candle to stay warm and melted throughout the meal.

The desserts here are really good.  They have changed them recently, so the creme brulee is no longer available, but the ice cream is always good!

This place is not cheap, but it is completely worth the money to get away from the noise of Las Vegas and enjoy an intimate and fabulous meal.  Most people shun the Downtown areas as being low-rent and where losers and old folks hang out.  What they don't know is their loss - in my opinion, the gambling is better Downtown and with Second Street Grill tucked away in the Fremont, the food is great.",n4qDKZ2RfwW8bqkQDQeLBQ,6,1,4,KhlsO4SnROlq86pU1VrWMA

We had the pleasure of stumbling across Second Street Grill during our most recent trip Downtown in August. We stayed at the Fremont Casino and Hotel and did not feel like venturing out to find something to eat, and we thought we would stop in for the T-bone special for $22.95. 

The decor of the restaurant was very quaint,  subtle and classy with perfectly dim lighting. Wait staff was attentive, friendly, and on top of everything; our glasses never went empty! 

On our first visit, we opted not to get the T-Bone special. Instead, we went with the Chipotle Rib Eye, and Mongolian Rack of Lamb. Both were phenomenal, well seasoned, and cooked to perfection. We had the crab cakes as an appetizer and they were delightful. You could not have received a better meal at a better price at any of the higher end steakhouses on the Strip, that's for sure. 

We were so impressed with the service and food quality that we went back a few nights later for a second feast. This time, we both took advantage of the T-Bone special, and I can't imagine a better meal for the money. The salad dressing on the house salad was incredible, and the bread basket was delicious. Steaks were perfectly done, seasoned well, extremely tender, and we ordered ours with loaded baked potatoes. Don't forget to order desert!

All in all, Second Street Grill is an amazing hidden gem in Downtown. If you are staying or playing at the Fremont (which we both love), you couldn't ask for a better restaurant.

So I said ok let me go ahead and order this. She asked what was my dressing I asked what did they have was told all the dressings then my friend said I got a Caesar salad. So she said do you want Caesar dressing or a Caesar  salad we both agrees on the salad. So the apps arrived and out drinks and them the ""Caesar"" salads come out. It's a chicken Caesar salad not a side salad. So I asked why did she bring this and she said it's what I asked for I told her no I assumed it was a dinner salad not a full on meal salad. She was very rude and them said I didn't have to eat the salad and she took it off the table.

Thanks to Jeff V. for inviting us out for a lobster & crab feast after his lucky weekend in Sin City! We're so glad he introduced us to this cozy lil steak house tucked inside of the Downtown Fremont Hotel & Casino. This place is a hidden treasure! The restaurant is dimly lit and has an old school steak house vibe; really unpretentious. The decor evokes a 1920s atmosphere with rich colors, wood paneling and faux marble pillars; but on a budget. We lifted up the tablecloth to find a vintage padded dealer's table with a cigarette burn. Thats old Vegas alright! There's also a small bar area to the right when you enter. Casual attire is fine, but you can surly bring your date here. The pricing is reasonable and the portion sizes are great!

All you need to know is Alaskan King Crab and Australian Lobster Tail! Both were extremely meaty and sweet. Cooked to succulent perfection. There was so much meat, we had to take a doggy bag home! They go all out on presentation here, the plates looked fantastic! The lobster was presented beautifully on a huge plate with pesto mashed potatoes (extremely dry and unedible) and stir-fry vegetables with lemon ginger butter sauce (they're alright.) But the shellfish were the star of the show and equally incredible! Rated: 5/5

The entrees also come with a simple side spring salad and your choice of dressing. Get the Bleu cheese dressing. Rated: 3/5

We also shared the Tempura appetizer which comes with soft shell crab, tiger prawns, assorted vegetables. The batter was fried golden and crispy, but it was way too thick and heavy. Rated: 2/5

Would I come back? Hell to the YEAH. But let it be known, the shellfish is where it's at! Thanks Jeff V!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,34,31,4,_LgtIp-_CJG1A_tFDSOVhQ

Our apps came out quickly, but the main course took an exceptionally long time.  It wasn't that big of a deal because we were caught up in an interesting conversation.  However, when our food arrived, I was a little disappointed.  I had ordered my steak medium, while my friend ordered hers medium well.  Mine was right around medium well and hers was well done; due to it being butterflied.  Our server Pam offered to take it back and prepare a new one, but it wasn't her fault so I just declined and said I will eat the well done steak.  It was still good, just not as juicy of course.

I give Pam an extra star because of her service and kind attitude.

Place was packed - lots of diners ordering $35 steaks, escargot, and $15 sashimi. The lamb chops were particularly good - for $37. perfectly cooked and tasty. No gamey smell or taste for the lamb. 

We also ordered the whole fried snapper - was told it was good, but it was way over cooked and dry. Meat was tough and hard, I wouldn't order it again for that reason. It was pricey at $55, thought it would be worth it. Meh. 

Buffalo mozzarella was large enough to share with the whole table - mozzarella - excellent, though a little drowned in balsamic. 

Miso butter fish was the best dish - black cod was marinated perfectly and very tasty. 

Ambiance is loud, tables are very close to each other but the butterfish and lamb chops were worth it. 

We were almost too full to have dessert so only ordered plain vanilla ice cream, it came with marinated pineapple. 

We would return again -  a good meal without driving very far if ou stay downtown.  If you drive. Parking is by valet only unless you park somewhere else and walk in.",zwVGQOe7xUgAV49KQRGd_Q,2,0,4,cztnxsT7JOTU1jLZlNH_KA

I had spoken with the manager in charge that night and requested a table in the back and not too noisy so we could enjoy a b-day celebration for 6 of us.  He kept repeating what I was requesting and told me not to worry that they would be happy to take care of us.  He had even asked if we wanted any particular server.  Well, we show up at the restaurant on Monday 6/22 and the hostess (who identified herself as the manager) proceeded to seat us in the front room in the middle of the restaurant.  I asked her if she could seat us in the back as I had called several weeks ago  etc, and she proceeded to tell me that she was the manager and she didn't know anything about it. She acted like because she didn't know it wasn't her fault.  And she had the nerve to ask if we could wait about a half hour until the big group in the back left and she could seat us in the back then.  I was furious- she was rude and didn't even have the manners to apologize.  I told her we were leaving and she picked up the menus and went back to stand at her hostess stand without saying a word.  This was totally unacceptable- I couldn't believe how unprofessional she was.  She clearly could have cared less about our business.  I guess someone forgot to tell her that no one will go back to a restaurant with bad service no matter what the food tastes like.  A smile, an apology, a drink while we waited would have gone a long way.  Needless to say, I will never go back to this restaurant and neither will I let anyone else I know go back there.

We arrive at the restaurant with reservations and were immediately seated. Then we waited for 15 minutes for our server to come around...there were only about 4 other tables in the restaurant at the time. Finally our server, Gloria, comes over to our table. I asked her what the Gluten Free options were on the menu and she said we don't have anything that is Gluten Free. I was leaning toward the steak and lobster special so I asked her how that was prepared. She said there was butter, which wasn't gluten free, on the steak and lobster, and the sour cream on the baked potato wasn't gluten free either. Clearly she didn't know what Gluten was and was making stuff up as she went instead of asking the chef or someone that actually knew. Finally I said I'll take the steak and lobster and the butter was fine. Our table also asked for a side of bacon as well. The food comes out, I have a dry steak and a dry lobster...no butter on either. It was the worst steak and lobster I have ever had. The lobster tasted like it was a month old and the steak was the lowest quality steak for a $$$ rated restaurant i've ever had. 3 of us had ordered steak and not a single person had received a steak knife until we asked for one...half way through our meal because no one came by to check up on us and the bacon never came out. The server visited our table maybe 3 times during the entire dinner, once to take our order, once to give us water, and once to give us our checks.

As a long time casino visitor thanks to my father's gambling interest/addiction, I have been to more buffets than my stomach can handle, so it was a nice upgrade to go to the steakhouse.  

It is classic fancy/shabby Vegas restaurant, a place which caters to the medium rollers at Fremont, who eat at home 51 weeks a year so they can blow their cash in an old time Downtown casino.  

There was nothing really interesting with the decor or service, nor do their customer base want better.  I was a little dubious about my menu selections, especially when he made me get the T-bone special (despite getting a free food comp).

As with most steakhouses, all the apps are meant to be shared so I decided to try either soup or a salad.  When I found out that the salad was also for sharing, Tony told me that a house salad comes with each meal.  Win!  I ordered a cup of beef vegetable which was the soup du jour.  I didn't realize that I could have gotten a different dressing than the honey mustard that came on the house salad.  It's one of my least favorite dressings because of its sweetness.  Along with my soup, I was brought a round loaf of right out of the oven bread scored in quarters.  There were also two butters--regular and pesto.  The regular butter was the best.

I ordered the NY steak done blue.  It comes with gorgonzola cheese, mashed potatoes, and Maui onion strings.  Tony asked me if I was OK with the topping and the other items to make sure.  The steak was very rare as asked.  The Maui onion strings were completely addictive.  One thing I don't like is when a restaurant puts a layer of mashed potatoes down and then plates the steak on the potatoes.  I know it's my quirk, but I'd rather have them separate.

For dessert, I got the Kona coffee crème brûlée.  It was good but there was a strong coffee flavor.

This was an enjoyable experience and service was good.  I'm not sure of a return visit.  They're closed Monday and Tuesday and they only have valet parking.  I parked at Neonopolis and walked there.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,8,3,pLs40khbtrLmuPbFXSM-cQ

It was off the menu for a while, but they have it back and I highly suggest going for the fish!!!!

The four stars is definitely just for the fish! (although the escargot was amazing too)
The fish is a wok fried whole fish that is prepared perfectly! They serve it with a soy dipping sauce and a tarter sauce, but the fish needs neither.... it is perfect all on its own.
The bread they bring out for the table is very fresh and I really liked the honey mustard house dressing that was on the salad.

The restaurant is located in the Fremont Hotel downtown. The location is 3 stars. It does feel very old school Vegas though.
The service is hit and miss... definitely 3 stars...they put forth an effort, but not so much of an effort to leave any kind of an impression. 
I however love good food... so atmosphere or service can take a back seat for the quality of the food!

I will be back very soon for that fish!! (Please keep it on the menu Second Street)",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,0,1,4,b3oADChI-TUyq6dyG6CZJg

First they bring over bread and 3 different toppings for the bread. Butter, garlic Olive oil and an eggplant spread. All were great and the bread was fresh and warm. 

I ordered the New York Strip with gorgonzola on top. It was served on top of crispy fried onion strips, mashed potatoes and broccolini. I usually don't care for steak while out, but this was delicious. And my steak was actually delivered medium, like I ordered (something I wasn't expecting for a steak house inside a casino).

The servers were all nice and the atmosphere was relaxed and peaceful. It was a nice getaway found inside the hustle and bustle of a casino.",TgOaTBhotYP0TV0xs6Visg,1,0,4,Aepk-Ls907pL46VdqrodxA

Called and asked if there were openings that evening and was told it was very slow so no reservation needed.  Didn't stop the guy who would turn out to be our waiter from glaring and mumbling when we got there and I said I had no reservation.  He also seemed annoyed that we didn't order immediately.  Maybe he mistook us for others because when he came back again, there was a complete change of attitude.  Helpful and friendly for the rest of the night.  I think the appetizers would make a better meal than ordering an entree.  The lettuce rolls were really good.  The crab cake was also good.  Neither of these was as good as the scallop and shrimp dim sum, which was excellent but overpriced.  Ordered a shrimp and vegetable tempura dinner as well but the tempura wasn't quite cooked long enough - doughey inside.  Didn't even try dessert after barely finishing half of what we ordered.",kkTOV5bnE9hHb5V_zd9b9g,5,7,4,dRAu7Y9ZQ9N9Y5krCsza6g
5079385,2013-02-04,2,kpZjgADHSklBk3JqcO4b4Q,"Me and my wife stumbled upon this restaurant when we were just browsing the nightlife in downtown vegas. So I made a reservation and we waltz pretty much right in since there are not really that many customers around. 

When we walk in the hostess asked if we needed the wine list. Wait? Arent you supposed to be a fine dining steak house? Maybe its because we are a couple of asian that looks to young to order any wine. Still, wine list should come automatic without asking. Weird??

When we sit down, our server an old lady showed up and asked us within the first minute, so are you ready to order? WOW!!! No what,why, if and but, just straight asking like we are at the mcdonald. AMAZING. No wonder you work in downtown, cos I dont think the strip will hired you.

The rest of the evening was pleasant, I ordered the prime rib queen size which is pretty big already and my wife ordered some fish which she enjoyed very much. All and all, the food are okay. The old busser are pretty nice, he make sure that we have our water filled almost immediately and taken all our dirty dishes. The salad that comes with the meals are pretty nice and tasty too. 

At the end of our meal, the server just pop in and drop us a check maybe hoping that we dont order any dessert so that if we stiff her its not too painful. All the more reason my wife would like to order some dessert, so we ordered the napoleon and it was wonderful. 

Dont worry, we didnt stiff the old lady, except the greet and the ending, she did an ok job and that warrant a 20 percent tips. Is there room for improvement for the management for a service training, sure. What about food, they are wonderful. Pretty good deal for the price. Will I come back? Maybe not in a little while, there are a lot of steakhouses in downtown and I heard an awesome steakhouse called Andiamo is coming soon at D Casino, cant wait to check that one out.",gm20Rasn38z5xdnd7_iM4g,1,0,3,BlmR1oY89gmbgF9FsByb5g

That has all changed. The food was mediocre at best, and certainly not worth what was being charged. They clearly changed vendors or downgraded the quality of the beef they used because all of the steaks were terrible - tough, tasteless and despite being ordered at Medium came at shoe leather - so back they went.  The worst part of the evening, however, was the atmosphere and the manger's refusal to tone down an extremely drunk and loud party of 3. I know, how can a party of 3 disrupt an entire restaurant?  Vegas, baby! They did. I have been at super bowl sports bars that were less noisy.  It is a small dining room, so one loud party allowed to do their thing will ruin (and did) the dining experience for everyone else - with the manager's blessing.  We complained to her as we left, given our complaints to the waiter were only met with stares of there is nothing I can do.  We will never be back. Take you money and go play MegaMillion.

5612295,2018-02-14,1,kpZjgADHSklBk3JqcO4b4Q,"My husband and I have been staying at the Fremont Hotel since 2008 and we typically visit the week after the NFR and right before Christmas.  This time of year finds many of the finer restaurants (and popular shows) to be closed or dark, to do the yearly sprucing up and to give the employees holiday time with their loved ones.  

This year, we visited the first full week in February and were beyond excited to find out we could FINALLY visit the Second Street Grill.  Every year, we gaze wistfully at their posted menu, and dab a tear from our eyes as we read the sign that says 'we are closed now but will re-open on December XX' which is always the day AFTER we leave town!

This year, things were going to be VERY different!  Last year, we had the pleasure of meeting the manager, Leslie, who has over the past year, become a dear friend and we were anxious to connect again in person.  We alerted her to our impromptu visit to Vegas and promised to let her know when we'd be stopping by.  So, because we knew this evening was going to be awesome, we invited our friends along (we'll call them A and J-O) for dinner.  We had reservations for 8pm and arrived on time, to be welcomed with a big hug from our friend Leslie!  Yes, this year was going to be VERY different!  For once, we were inside, not outside with our noses pressed against the glass, hoping for a whiff of the amazing food inside!

The first thing you notice when you enter the sanctuary that is the bar is the complete lack of noise from the casino.  I have no idea how they do this, but if you didn't know you had just come from a land of clinking, clanking, smoking and laughter, you would never know the cacophony that lies beyond the front door!

The decor is understated, with subdued lighting and jewel-toned accents.  The restaurant feels very intimate and classy, without being pretentious.  Soft music, attentive service and amazing food really makes this place a 'must visit' for everyone.

Now, the main attraction - the food!  Our group started with the escargot and scallops, bathed in a garlic butter sauce.  Everyone proclaimed it to be quite delish and I can vouch for the garlic butter sauce being perfectly dippable with their amazing bread.  The sourdough bread, served warm, had a satisfying crunchy exterior and a dense and flavorful inside.  Butter and pesto butter accompanied the bread and the reviews of the pesto butter were mixed.  

A and my hubby R both opted for the surf and turf, which consisted of  a filet mignon and a lobster tail.  The food was artfully presented with the perfectly charred filet resting atop grilled mushrooms and onions and 
the lobster tail was shimmering and succulent, imploring for a dip into the drawn butter.  A flower garnish completed the artful plating and really took the entire dish over the top.   A salad and baked potato accompanied this entree as well.  

J-O ordered the bone-in ribeye, which was accompanied by green beans, a baked potato and side salad.  Again, the presentation was beautiful - with a flower and a sprig of rosemary rounding out the dish.

I selected the filet mignon, medium rare, which was crowned with a tangle of fried onion straws and accompanied by a baked potato and a salad.  The perfectly cooked steak had a char on the outside and was cool red from edge to edge - a skill very few chefs can execute time and time again.  

Everyone we encountered added to our overall experience.  The staff was professional, personable, attentive without being intrusive and really took great care in anticipating our needs.  The manager, Leslie, stopped by each table at least once during the visit and you could tell she takes great pride in her staff, her food and beverage offerings and her establishment.  From start to finish, the entire experience was a night to remember.  Yes, this year was VERY different indeed!  Thanks to everyone at SSG!
