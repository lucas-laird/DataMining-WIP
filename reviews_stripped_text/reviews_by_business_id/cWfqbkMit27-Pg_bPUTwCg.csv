60187,2013-04-07,0,cWfqbkMit27-Pg_bPUTwCg,"Not a bad place for a burger and a drink, but not great either.

To summarize the pros and cons of my experience:

Cons: 1. Sticky tables, 2. Dirty looking silver ware 3. Cool beer, not cold beer.

Pros: 1. Good Food, 2. Nice and attentive staff 3. Sports on TV 4. Free Wifi

I went to the Roadrunner off Buffalo and Washington around 4:10 on Saturday 4/6/13. I walked in and sat myself as a sign instructed and was promptly greeted by the Manager on duty. He brought a water and he took my order. I asked for the 1/3 lb Angus Burger and a draft Sam Adams Boston lager. I prefer draft instead of bottled because draft is colder, usually.

Looking around its what you would expect from a local's oriented sport bar. Dim, sticky and sports on TV. The table I sat at was pretty sticky and the silver ware, though clean, had a lot of water spots on it and looked a little gross. They had Wichita vs Louisiana on, no volume though which was ok with me because I think Charles Barkley's voice is annoying. Also they didn't have the captions on so I had no idea what anyone was saying, but I don't really care that much about it.

About another 3 minutes later I was brought a bottle of Sam Adams Boston lager instead of a draft by a very kind waitress. Even though I ordered a draft I didn't make a stink about it  because hey, beer! Taking another look around, the place was clean and if you like antique-ish looking cowboy stuff and garb this place is your mecca. There are cowboy hats, western style art and nick-nacks on the walls; even rusty looking horse shoe light fixtures. Also they had a sign that said free WiFi, which is all ways cool.

Now to the important stuff; the food and beer. The beer was cold but not cold enough, I'd honestly have to say it was cool. You know a beer is cold when there's condensation on the bottle, a good example is when you bring out a glass of ice water and there is moisture on the outside of the glass, that means its cold on the inside. To say the least it was cool, tasted warmer then my water and therefore like crap. Any savvy beer drinker knows, especially those that prefer Sam Adams, that a good beer temperature is between 39 and 45 degrees; mine tasted more like in the low to mid 50's. Yuck, but I still drank it because I'm a man, and a man never wastes beer. I ordered another hoping for a better one, but I was disappointed again.

The burger was good, very slightly pink even though I asked for well done, and was served on a perfectly toasted bun with too much lettuce and two slices of tomato. With half the lettuce off, the burger tasted excellent; the fries were also good and had just enough seasoning unlike other places that pile on the salt.

The price for a burger and two beers was $18.32 with tax. That's $4.50 a beer and $7.95 for the burger. Not great but not bad for Vegas, I'd say it's the average around here. If you go there Mon-Fri between 11am-3pm you can get the burger for $5.95.",1PFkb0MUYrAfdhOrJ5p4qw,3,0,3,72bnMidkUhe5JmI0gTJB2w

596676,2011-07-13,2,cWfqbkMit27-Pg_bPUTwCg,"Why can't you give negative stars for a review?

I came here on a Monday night with my fiancee and two co-workers. The waitress seemed nice enough, although it took forever to get our food. But by the end of the night, and one too many beers later, our tab was suddenly over $200. WAY over. Are you kidding me?!?

We begrudgingly shelled out our money, and even left a sizable tip. 

So imagine how thrilled I was when I woke up two days later to a text from my bank (Thank god for Chase Mobile) informing me of a $64.14 charge that overdrew my account. Due to that charge and the overdraft, my paycheck that I had deposited the previous night did not clear. I went directly to Roadrunner and informed them of their mistake, and the manager had the audacity to tell me ""it was not their fault, and that it was the bank's fault.""

WHAT?!?

I proceeded to call my bank who, of course, let me know that the charge was in fact from Roadrunner and that they could cancel the still pending charge at any time. My fiancee and I made ANOTHER trip back to Roadrunner, and informed the manager of this, and he still refused, saying that they were in no way at fault.

I'm now having to file through the fraud department at my bank, and god knows when I'll get my money back, not to mention the fact that my account is now in limbo. &%$# this place. Great food, ok beer, horrible prices, even worse service.",-zZ8Z-IuPvYiH2ed7t3j6w,4,0,1,pdAzHY7SVarefcldsXKKPA

1025448,2012-04-30,0,cWfqbkMit27-Pg_bPUTwCg,"I have been eating and enjoying a few adult beverages at this saloon since 2001.  It had the best waitresses, and the food was amazing..... And then a corporation purchased the bar a few years ago.  The draft beers shrunk in size, as did the food portions.  The good waitresses all left, and now it is hit or miss with the new staff.  The prices have all inflated, but the taste is not near as good as it was before the corporation came in.  

We used to eat there 2-3 times per week, and I woujld bring every guest from out of town there.  Now I eat there twice a year, only when forced by a friend that is visiting from out of state, and only when I can't convince them that the experience is not the same.  After expensive, smaller drinks and food, less tasty food, and less friendly waitresses, my friends agree and do not want to return either.

As a side note to RoadRunner.... Hire Roxy or Keisha back as a manager, and have them train the staff.  Get away from cheaper food (your salsa tastes like BBQ sauce with tomato sauce, and your ranch is watered down).  Go back to the way it was before the corporation took over.",uPgj7UUo5BTErhAnzVV4Ww,3,0,2,gAy0hHuZ1lkC0PjWJJpCFw

1170776,2013-07-09,0,cWfqbkMit27-Pg_bPUTwCg,"You get what you pay for. Which is why I love the Roadrunner Saloon. 

I first started coming here as a Denver Broncos fan. Everyone knows the Broncos have the best fans, and the Roadrunner made Sundays very special. Drink specials, kickoff shots, cheerleading, raffles for prizes, etc. It is loud and crazy and this upcoming season should be better than ever!

Ok, back to the review... I found a Groupon, $15 for $30. Already that's a steal, considering most of it could be spend getting liquored up. The fine print stated that 1 food item needed to be purchased. Perfect, side of fries and shots all around. Well, actually, I was more interested in trying the food. So we spend all 30.00 on grub.

Here's the breakdown:
Menu- it all looked interesting. Keep in mind this is bar food, no matter how they try to sell it. If you can remember that, you'll be fine.

Started off with the Jalapeño bottlecaps, fried pickles, and JD Whiskey Chili.
The jalapeños  were just spicy enough, went great with ranch. Fried pickles were actually great, with a big beer batter and ranch. Real good.
The chili was ok too. Not the 5 alarm of your dreams, but better than Stagg in a can. It was tasty. Would I get it again? Maybe. I think I'm somewhat of a chili snob, but that shouldn't affect my judgement here. Lets just say for bar chili I've had so much worse. you might really enjoy it. Give it a shot, they sell it by the cup, you just have to ask.

Then we tried the turkey melt and the burger with bacon. The turkey met was wicked awesome. Bread perfectly buttered and toasted, nice hot deli turkey with avocado and mayo. It was great. I ate most of it, Sarie being full after the apps. I'd recommend the turkey melt over anything else I've had there. Im getting hungry just thinking about it.
The burger wasn't great. And that sucks, because why go get a beer in a place that can't make a decent burger? What was so bad about it, you may ask? Well, the bacon was, shall we say, less than inspired. Thin and dry; not the best look for bacon. The bun, however, was soaked through. Not the best look for a bun. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium but lacked flavor and wasn't seasoned, as far as I could tell. The fries were limp and a little cold.

BUT for $15 dollars it was a steal. That sandwich was great! The staff and managers are always in a good mood and do a really good job. So for bar food, it's great. Just go in with accurate expectations.",Gu-rR-zYcWo3mPPkUHXUrA,8,4,3,nu4h__AmEO2kDiCwKz28Og

1721280,2012-11-11,0,cWfqbkMit27-Pg_bPUTwCg,"I am glad I ended up here, because I was pleasantly surprised. After a 10 day stint with family on the east coast and practically Indian food everyday...I was ready for easy all-american food.  I wanted a simple steak and salad with ranch dressing, but I didn't want to spend alot like I normally would at a steakhouse.  To top it all off, my husband wanted to watch to watch football, it was Monday night.  Further we wanted to try a new place in our neighborhood, so we ended up at Roadrunner.

We walked in, and at first, I was off put by the smokiness, but there were not that many people given that it was a large place, so at the doorway, I decided it was fine...I was tired and hungry anyway.  Once I started to look around, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the establishment is, and the cozy outdoor space that includes a fire pit and some TVs.  While the country, southwestern? decor is not my preference, it was still cleanly done, so I didn't seem to mind so much.

Anyway, we were greeted by a very polite yet casual hostess and she let us sit where ever we liked since there were only two dining tables occupied at the time.  I was a bit hesitant by how empty it was, doubting the food was any good, if even edible. 

Going through the menu, I was surprised at the expanse of the food menu, given it was a ""saloon"".  They menu items were definitely were inspired by its Southwestern roots, although they had nice twists on regular ""All-American bar food.  The menu had something for everyone... burritos, fish, pasta, steaks, pizzas, salads, soups, burgers, and sandwiches. Prices hitting all sorts of I struck gold with a steak salad! 

So I ordered the steak salad and my husband ordered a burger with bacon and cheese.  We also ordered a couple of drinks.  He ordered a Guinness, but I was not impressed with the limited wine selection . I asked for a Sauv Blanc...they don't serve it.  So I asked for a Pinot Grigio, they usually have it but were all out, I went with merlot.  It was fine, probably should have not bothered since it was just labeled house wine, which tend to be pretty crappy just so they can increase their profit margins.  

My salad was well done, actually taking on a Mediterranean flair with Kalamata olives, feta, red onions, and grape tomatoes,  topped  with crispy fried onions on a bed of romaine with pan seared strip? steak.  The steak was plentiful and perfectly done, given I asked for it medium rare. That was impressive, not to mention tasty, since most steak salads offered by restaurants seem to just use any odds and ends for steak salad.  Whether they were or not, the crinkle cut fries looked like they were bought and just cooked.  However, my husband did eat them all without complaint.

The diverse menu obviously expresses the talent and passion of the chef (staff) in the kitchen, it is a shame that the wine offering does not compliment that.  I think Roadrunner is underrating its own potential.  The Saloon names is a bit offputting, but focusing on the southwestern flair has broader appeal. Roadrunner could expanded its target market, even showing off its menu.  It could appeal more to the nearby Summerlin neighborhood, which are searching for nice casual dining establishments. With a little more marketing Roadrunner could get the justice it deserves, but for now it is my little secret.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,4,1,4,gtS_lbI5cx5USwityyIuzQ

So, for those that don't know, this is probably one of the best breakfast specials in town.  For $1.99 you get two eggs however you want, two slices of toast (or an English muffin), two slices of bacon (or sausage) and home fries.

And it is ALL delicious.  I've ordered a couple of different combinations and I have some custom requests (eggs fried over hard, bacon extra crispy, home fries extra crispy) and it always comes out correct.

So, why 4 out of 5?  Sometimes the service can be godawful slow in the mornings... and I don't mean the chef.  When you're trying to get in and get out, that can prove to be a challenge.

Lunch experience -- 5/5

It's really, really tasty.  Beats going to any fast food joint, and it's a good price point.  Also, great service during lunch.  I guess people working in a bar at 8am simply don't want to be there... go figure.  -:P

I've also tried their spinach & artichoke dip here -- absolutely fabulous, and I am SO picky about my spinach & artichoke dip.  My friend raves about the macaroni and cheese but I have yet to try that one out.  -:)",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,5,1,4,u_psA3p4gTwhtjmy3cNkkw

We didn't end up using it as we were there during happy hour and our dinner of Cowboy Poppers (Jalapenos stuffed with cheese and pulled pork), Sliders, Chicken Wings, a Bud Light, and a Sprite was well under our $30 Groupon. The food was pretty decent. I liked the filling in the poppers but the breading could use some work. The sliders were cooked past the medium I had requested but still pretty good. The chicken wings were chicken wings.

Next time I think I'll try the Southwest fried pickles and the pulled pork sandwich. And I think I'll bring my parents so the tab exceeds the Groupon.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,3,2,3,Xknlxi8yJbFS5MyzVHxPWg

The food was fine...typical bar items.  There were five of us all eating different things (and ordering soups or salads as well) and while no one had any major complaints about the food everyone agreed that we need to drive a little farther next time to eat something worth remembering.

BUT, I swear this is so far the 4th time that I've gone here just to sit down, wait 10+ minutes and then walk out because no one bothered to come over to my table. I'm not kidding! I'm actually typing this from my phone in their parking lot. There was one time-late night-that I was asked what I would like to drink, was brought that drink, drank that drink, then sat there with an empty glass for at least 15 or so minutes before I was asked if I wanted to order any food. I ordered my food (I'm sure you can guess what it was), got it and ate it. And yes, I also got my drink refilled too-I'm sure you're dying to know. Once again, my glass was damn near dry with no one checking to see if I wanted a refill-I really did want one, btw. In fact, no one came by at all! After I don't know how long- but long enough for my glass to be almost dry (I'm not exaggerating)- I finally just got up and paid my check with the bartender.

1. I love bar food, cowboy food, and Tex-Mex food.  Roadrunner Saloon carries all three of these types of food and they all taste great! I have tried a lot of the items and my belly is always happy afterwards.  Tasty food makes me happy.

2. Dr. Pepper Tacos!  Yes, you heard me right!  I love Dr. Pepper just a smidgeon less than my hubby and kid, like a paper thin difference.  So when I heard about these tacos, I had to investigate.  They are super duper fantastic!  The soda makes the meat so tender and flavorful.   They are fun to eat and taste great. I know this goes with #1, but anything regarding Dr. Pepper gets a special spot in my book.

3. Great service.  Every time I have been to this location, I have gotten great service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  I love good service because it makes your meal so much more enjoyable.  

4. It's family friendly.  Many of my favorite bar food joints have switched to a 21 and over only, which means I rarely can go.  Sad.  Roadrunner does allow kids and families, so we can all go out to a good meal.  My daughter loves the place too because she is all about cowboy stuff already.

5. The drinks are stiff!  If you are interested in bar service, the drinks are tasty.  I rarely have alcoholic drinks these days, but if you want one, Roadrunner serves stiff!

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that I think the prices are a bit high for what you get.  It isn't crazy over priced, just a $1 or so too high on most of the food items and $2-3 to high on the drinks.  Maybe I am just cheap in my old age, but that is how I see it.

For a meal that is on average $8-$11  per plate, you would expect it to be

For example the french fries were the kind you buy in a big buy and can oven at home... at least that's how it looked and tasted

the bun was cold and the coleslaw on the bun didn't make it taste any better

For example, my husband originally ordered the half chicken, and the waiter came back and said that the chicken was frozen and would take a little longer to prepare. We asked how long, and he went to ask the chef, returned and said one hour!  On a Saturday night, it strikes me as a point of concern that one of their main entree items is not ready to go. We ended up skipping the chicken.

Given the value, selection and service level, I could only see us returning to nurse a bowl of soup or chili, sip a beverage and watch some football. It wouldn't be a dinner destination for us, but it is an ok bar spot for snacking and watching a game.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,8,3,UqDcym1ciNUneHp4SkjzWw

The seating is amazing. Comfy upholstered chairs in rows! Get there early! 

The menu is great and the kitchen is flexible and very accommodating. My server, Kristen, was so sweet, attentive, and made the experience seamless! 

They have an area separated for families who might want to away from the bar and gambling area but still with screens! It has a blue sky ceiling like the Forum Shops. That's cool.

They do raffles throughout the games for some really cool stuff! 

Annnnd it's open 24 hours!!!!!

I'm not the biggest football fan, so when he told me this I rolled my eyes and said that's nice. When I went to visit a week later, he took me here for lunch and to watch the tail end of the game.

The menu is typical bar food with a bbq flair. I was pleasantly surprised though, the place was clean. I ordered the cobb salad, it came out split which was an accident, but it was actually fine, because it was big enough that I had the extra split scooped right into a to-go container.

On game days they turn all the lounge chairs toward the projector screens and make it a comfy seating situation. The patio looked like it would be a nice place to hang if it was warmer out too.",Z6RH7rwbgHZFc8cuJBcfZQ,5,0,4,CO6LP9IMcnVM6nax9KuyvQ

It's an appetizer, but there is enough there to fill you up and at $6 after tax, you can't go wrong. I could sit here and go into detail on how cheesy and delicious it is, but it's one of those things you have to experience yourself. 

They have super cheap breakfasts. $1.99 I think? that give you a good portion as well. Not only that but $5 lunch specials such as hamburgers and burgers. Their burgers are pretty good but I haven't had a sandwich yet. All and all, I've had at least 7 items on the menu and nothing has been bad.

5600135,2011-11-12,0,cWfqbkMit27-Pg_bPUTwCg,"Well not the first time I have been here, so I though I should finally write a review.  I guess you can say this is your typical Las Vegas Bar and Tavern.  It has a cowboy theme - nothing to orginal here.  It is a broncos bar if there are any Bronco fans left...

I don't like the oversized lounge chairs - thay are totally uncormfartable and clunky.  We sat in a booth in the bar area.  They do have a seperate dining area.

The food here is ok.  We got there during a thursday night football game so they had some game specials.  3 apps for $8.95.  Sounded good but the apps were like mini size.  Jal poppers, guacamole, mini-shrimps.  The shrimps were small - you could probably call them krill... I understand it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.

To save this visit;

They had Pitchers of Kokanne Beer for $8!!!!  Love it!!  I will go to a place that serves Kokanne specifically for the Kokanee.

This is not my favorite place to grab a beer but it is okay in a pinch.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,1,0,3,L0mon5xONbmRvTY3Oxb17A

Let me explain why i am rating this a 1star
After work I met a friend there for some late night fingers and fries, as soon as we sat down, some crazy drunk dude was falling all over himself and had to be escorted out, and found out that in the parking lot he took a WHIZ right in front of the entrance, GROSS...next after the waitress ""Kristen"" brought my fingers, she immediately said I had to pay the bill cause her ""Manager"" said so! What!!!! YEA! Ok if they wanted to close out for the night, she could have said it a different way, and I told her I was going to order more food later...turns out she never came back for a tip or to collect the money from my second order that I got which was the disgusting jalapeno rings(YUCK!).
AND the bartender was rude when I asked for a pack of matches and wanted the 4.29 for the damn jalapeno things, I asked for the check, which he did not offer and my friend just handed him 7.00
REALLY?????????
UMMMMMM NO, that is all wrong
They lost a loyal patron
I will never go out of my way to drive there again, thanks",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,9,2,1,7R_xYAOFieE5btnvwQR_xA

It's a Thursday) and the bartender was super sweet and explained that I could have my choice between the breakfast and lunch menu.  Can't beat that! After looking at both menus I went with the cowboy eggs Benedict which was delicious. I can never say no to eggs Benedict anyway. The food here is always great though.

No don't get me wrong, the place is nice, top notch decor but.....it has an identity crisis, its not what it appears to be, and as one that been to many Texas road houses I was highly disappointed. ,first off, its more of a restaurant then a bar, 2nd, poor draught selection where the most interesting beer is a Newcastle.....A Texas themed bar with no Shiner on tap? sad, very sad.
Moving to the food, Ordered the artichoke dip, surprisingly advertised to contain Texas cheeses, funny....in all my years as a north Texas resident I never heared about such a thing.
Anyway, it was bland and flavorless.
Service: mediocre and needs improvement
Will I be back? no thanks, I rather go to Steiner's 300.feet away.better everything with a real happy hour.",KCwfAJkgpi3-J1Es1qlLyg,1,1,3,VeDOwqrnOSA1JRyRA5TKJg

Its a big space with a long bar full of gaming, comfy chairs and low tables for groups, and a raised dining area. Plenty of TV's for viewing sports, often tuned to 4 different channels on the 2 big TV's and then focused on the big game during prime events.

I like this place because of their food. The Dr. Pepper tacos are always good....sweet marinated tender meat with some nice salsa, rice, and beans. I also love their chicken fried steak, served with mashed potatoes and an ear of grilled corn on the cob. I like chicken fried steak and they do it right here.
