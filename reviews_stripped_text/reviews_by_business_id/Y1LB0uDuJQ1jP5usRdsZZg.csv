You get to enjoy an artfully presented, well balanced tasting menu that leaves you full, but not stuffed.

507359,2014-07-07,0,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"Very excited to see what else the Chef will come up with once they get their full menu going.  With such limited seating and quality of food,  I can see this place as the next hot spot in town! 

We were there for the three course lunch.  First course was a chilled avocado soup.  I recommend spooning through all three layers to the bottom so you can taste the complexity of the soup.  Wonderful for the hot summer; refreshing and the perfect amount of salt and texture.  Second course was presented beautifully, the dusting of flavor of the shrimp was incredible - reminded me of a fresh shrimp ceviche.  The third course I chose the ramen.  I've had lots of ramen all over the place (in Asia as well as the states) and I've never tasted anything quite like this.  It was a wonderful porky broth with sesame and a charcoal-y, grilled flavor.  The meat is thicker than I like but was full of flavor and melted in my mouth.  My bowl of ramen seemed endless!  Couldn't finish everything....   

Similar to Raku and Kabuto in terms of food quality and service, but different in terms of type of food.  Raku to me is more traditional and Kabuto is strictly nigiri.  This place is like a modern twist on Japanese.  It's young and hip. 

We met Chef Omae after our meal and he is so humble and nice.  Very cool guy, definitely come check this place out!  Beat the crowds so you can say you've been there, tasted that.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,2,2,5,WluWfXyUkjm0tJ9Z2Bkliw
512766,2014-08-17,0,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"Couldn't wait to go try some great food by a Michelin Star Chef.  Chef Omae took over Morimoto XEX in Tokyo and recieved a Michelin start,  the restaurant subsequently was renamed Omae XEX.  He decided to open an off the strip price fixe menu for local Las Vegas!  Currently only open for lunch, but soon for dinner(also no liquor license at the moment).  At a price of $20 per person for a 3 course, it can't be beat!!  The menu is always changing but here is a breakdown of our 3 courses:

1st - Egg custard with Edamame soup - amazing flavors, almost reminded me of the egg custards at Roku.  The Edamame gave a good added flavor at the end.

2nd - Charred onion with Chicken miso and dried Bonito shavings - my least favorite of the courses.  I appreciated the flavors, the charring of the onion really decreased the intensity of the onion flavor and helped it marry with the miso and bonito.  But it felt as if it was missing something

3rd(main) - There were 3 choices, we picked the chicken ramen and the waygu burger.  The Ramen was a large portion, a little unexpected given previous courses.  The noodle wasn't your typical noodle, it was thicker and almost seemed more absorbant, as it took in much of the broth flavor.  The Burger was on another level completely!  The burger was rich and perfectly cooked, on a simple bun with lettuce and tomato.  The mustard used on the burger really made the flavors of it all pop, I believe it was a wasabi type mustard.",pfsE0t9X4UYSdSh8fodsEg,2,2,5,rPEBORyRSD3ZkxcScgfv0w
953833,2014-11-26,3,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"It's tough to review this place as I'm partially biased that they can't serve alcohol yet (and won't let my BYOB!) and way more important was that it took over 3 hours for a 7 course meal that cost $150 per and I left unsatisfied. 

That being said. We had the ama ebi tartar with shrimp chips. Not bad. (Took pic) then we had the steamed fish which was a combination of scallops, white fish and shrimp served inside of yuzu. (Took pic again but was hard to capture) - this was an incredible combination of fish with the tang of yuzu. 

Next they showed us what fresh wasabi was like when grated. If you've never had this before its both refreshing and palate cleansing. Awesome. (Of course I took another pic- but don't be confused as this was for two people)

Then came the sushi. After a long two hour wait was the yummy sushi. Ebi, abalone, white fish (wasn't clear) Japanese plumbs, squid and seaweed. (Pic- upper left was dried plums to die for!)

Next was steamed seabass which was the usual soy sauce with scallions and tofu (pic)  definitely looked better than tasted. Slightly flaky with the sweet of miso glaze but I've had better. 

Next (pic) was the wagyu and the certificate of authenticity. There's a Japan Carcass Verification Buteau?!! 

The wagyu beef was fantastic but then again I was about 3 hours into a meal and was thinking of what pho place was nearby to satisfy me. I had to add the pic of the wagyu beef as the 'pinch of salt' looked like a line of coke. Didn't need any pho after that!!

1027531,2015-11-15,0,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"Mindblowingly awesome. This was one of the best omakase I have had in my life.

The place is unassuming in a strip mall. Interior is sparse with a few tables and dim lighting. The atmosphere could be use some help but it is fine. Reservations are easily made online via the website. They will call to confirm your reservation. 

The food is what you come here for. It is $150 per person for the omakase experience which is 7 courses, including dessert. Each dish is carefully made with thought and sensitivity. 

We started with an egg custard (a type of chawanmushi) which was garnished with a sweet lime zest. It was delicate and refreshing. Next came pieces of uni wrapped in wagyu beef. The server showed us the certificate that the beef came with showing his ancestry and pedigree. I thought it was a little odd but once I put that piece of red meat in my mouth, OH EM GEE. It was lush, rich, luxurious... The marbling of the meat melted ever so slightly in the mouth. It was kind of magical.

Our third course was a smoked oyster. Beautiful presentation with hints of cinnamon and five spice. Fourth course was the sashimi selection with a side of chirashi. This was presented with vintage house made soy sauce and freshly grated wasabi root. A brush is given to you to apply to your fish. My favorites were the tuna which has been flown in from Japan and the smoked barracuda (in the top right).

The fifth course was interesting and unique in its preparation. It was a saba fish cooked under pressure similar to confit. The tiny bones were rendered edible as a result. My husband had the front half of the dish and I had the back half. I even ate the din which was like a light fishy potato chip.

Finally we reached our main entree, the beef tenderloin. This was beautifully presented on top of individual smokers on what looked to be a ficus leaf. Several cuts of medium rare tenderloin where accompanied by several varieties of Japanese mushrooms and asparagus. 

Dessert was a house made green tea tempura on top of azuki bean. It was accompanied with several pieces of fresh fruit and a pistachio macaron.

The entire experience felt very intimate and personal. The only downside: they have no liquor license so BYOB.",o_aQ9LqQM9dlrNDHWjep-A,4,3,5,2W6cKGDvBXx-FLpdcHfHNw

I decided to go to the restaurant anyway and I was surprised to see that it was closed. No signs telling if it was definitely closed or not. It seems to me that the owner just left his restaurant.

Omae was the most unique and wonderful experience. We went there with another couple and had the entire place to ourselves for over an hour. It was like we had our own chef. 
 We ordered 2 of the four course and 2 of the seven course dinner to get the most variety possible. It was the best ever. The fish was so fresh and unique. I can't say enough. You just have to try this place. 

He is still working on their liquor license so that should be fixed soon. Still worth every penny. He is a really nice guy to. He came out and we took pictures. This place is well placed away from the strip. Since they only seat a total of 12 people. Very special and if Omae is not there the place is closed.

1237026,2015-02-21,4,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"If you're tired of the blazing lights of the Strip and overhyped cuisine then take a trip to Japanese Cuisine by Omae for a thoughtful dining experience that you will appreciate.

After countless trips to Vegas, a city that I've never been terribly fond of in the first place, I find myself craving for real cuisine.  I'm loathe to admit that it's taken me this long, but it's hard to escape Vegas' orbit once you're stuck there.  Japanese Cuisine is worth a trip.  It's located in a dimly lit strip mall, which reminds me of those I've seen in Torrance, CA.  Don't let the exterior fool you.  Once inside, your adventure begins.  The interior is a serene environment punctuated by the sound of falling water from their indoor koi pond.  There are two booths and a couple of side tables.  Given the size of the restaurant, it does give an exclusive feel.  Plus, you have to make reservations in advance.  You can't just show up as the chef prepares everything in advance.

The food is very, very good.  Overall, the food is artfully presented and borders the line between traditional Japanese cuisine with some fusion notes mixed in.  We opted for the 4 course omakase for $75.  We were offered an amuse bouche of selected breads with a miso dipping sauce.  Such an intriguing fusion of east meets west flavors.  Our next course was a Salmon Trout & Organic Vegetable Terirne.  Incredible artistry and the flavors were fantastic.  Up next, our table's mutual favorite, the Assorted Appetizers.  The artistry of this plate is a feast for the eyes.  What made it better was the incredibly fresh seafood.  For example, the live sweet shrimp that was imported from Tsukiji Fish Market and brought out to us live first so we could see what we would be eating.  Incredibly sweet and delectable.  There are so many delicate flavors to appreciate on this plate.  Third, we ate a Lobster Risotto with Japanese rice & Wagyu Teppan Yaki.  This is Omae's interpretation of Japanese style surf 'n turf and it's a solid savory dish to anchor the meal.  While the Wagyu was good, I've had better, but Omae's was still up there.  Fourth, for dessert, Mascaporne Cheez Iced Cream over Matcha Green Tea.  This is Omae's interpretation of Japanese style affogato.  Instead of espresso, you pour a delectable matcha green tea.  So creative and so delicious.  All the dishes ranged between 4-5 stars for me.

The service is top-notch.  Our server made our dining experience both educational and interactive.  It was like going to an awesome show and tell with great food.  We were shown the live shrimp from Tsukiji.  We were then taught how wasabi is grown and then had a chance to grate our own fresh wasabi tableside.  Hell yeah!  Then we were provided with the certificate of the wagyu beef we were eating - Japan has an incredible system where they can track the piece of beef to the cow, farm, etc.

We didn't know what to expect when we decided to drive out to Japanese Cuisine.  A few reviews seemed mixed, but I assure you that we had an amazing experience.  I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas and this time, I'm doing the full 7 course omakase.

FYI, Japanese Cuisine is applying for their alcohol license, but if you'd like they will accommodate BYOB without any corkage fee.",bfsX2VxPkZxiA-Hj-RHT4g,6,4,5,1AZ4eyp9pSAFv9QWR3xJNw

Chef Omae is switching to a dinner service only at the price of $100/person on Sept 3rd, 2014. 

Only 4 tables. Two 4 seaters and two 2 seaters.

We had originally wanted to try this restaurant 2 weeks ago but reservations were all gone on the day we wanted. So we found another day and it happened to be today. (Aug 05 2014)

Decor is simple. Fairly dark setting. Aside from the 4 tables, there were a few kimono's hanging from the walls, as well as a koi pond next to one of the tables (our table). By this table, you'll also see descriptions of each fish, their names, as well as their worth/cost. oh my D:.... ranged from a few thousand up to over 28,000.... 

The menu had just recently changed (the menu is ""served"" in its own plate too LOL)

---------------------------------------------

--Appetizer--

Vegetable Terrine - 10 kinds of vegetable jellied with a soy sauce flavor fish broth

--Main Course--

Assorted Tempura served over a bowl of rice - shrimp, lotus root, snow pea, pumpkin, oyster mushroom, scallop, and white fish

Wagyu Beef Burger with sliced tomato, red onion, lettuce and a side of fried potato and parmesan cheese

--Dessert--

Green Tea Tiramisu

--Drinks--

Coke, Diet Coke, Iced Tea, Iced Green Tea, Sparkling Water

----------------------------------------------

Vegetable terrine - My first experience ! I've seen it done in various shows before but I've never had it. I know its a clear broth that's solidified/gelatinized holding fresh vegetables and served. The fish broth was flavorful but light. Vegetables were fresh. some vegetables were pickled which added another element to the flavor. There was also a sauce to the side that was made with sesame and something else. I don't think it's pure sesame. Not overwhelming, but smooth. Probably the best course on the current menu. 

Assorted Tempura - Served in a huge bowl ! I just realized after looking at the menu, while typing this review, that mine didn't have the oyster mushroom nor the scallop. Wonder if the scallop was wrapped with the white fish... Though I am pretty sure i didnt have the oyster mushroom though. To be honest, this main dish wasn't anything out of the ordinary for me. If anything, it was a little underwhelming. The rice was a bit overcooked, so was a bit mushy. The sauce was nice, not too sweet. Batter was nice and light. Nothing made me go WOW! 

Wagyu Beef Burger - not my main course but i got to try it. The fries were nicely fried, topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. The ""ketchup"" is homemade. Our guess is they may create a broth with maybe bonito flakes and blend with a tomato paste or powdered bonito in a tomato sauce. It had a hidden flavor in the sauce. The burger overall was nice. The beef was soft but was a bit ""rough"". Not as smooth as i had hoped for. There are ways to make it smoother but i guess they wanted to maybe keep the texture without adding too much liquid. The sauce (guessing had wasabi in it) was nice. Not strong. Creamy but complimented nicely. Not a dish I would think of to represent japanese cuisine. 

Green Tea Tiramisu - Since we had 4 people, we had 4 servings. All of different sizes and shape. Lol... Probably made in a pan and was scooped out. I had the ""best"" looking one. Matcha powder and sugar sifted on top. Creamy and light marscapone. Have had better made green tea tiramisu but this was not bad. The lady fingers was a bit dry in comparison. Nice flavor overall. Presentation is a bit of a mess though and very inconsistent. 

Iced Green Tea - made with matcha powder. pretty strong. and refills (didn't expect this part but woo!) 

-------------------------------------------

Overall experience, not bad. Would like to try it again if there is a menu change before lunch service ends in September. $20/person not bad to experience a 3 course meal designed by a michelin star chef.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,3,4,c5BXIhCxcFICC6WfoFCHpw
1393476,2015-12-12,0,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"We had a delightful experience tonight! The omakase is a 7-course meal, and we started off with an egg tofu/chawanmushi with Japanese mushrooms, shrimp and edamame topped off with the zest of sweet key lime! The flavors were perfectly balanced and the dashi stock tasted light but flavourful. 

Our second course was Wagyu Beef wrapped with Uni and seasoned with garlic soy sauce and shiso leaves, topped off with crusty sea salt. This was our favourite course of the night. The uni paired really well with the beef, and the shiso and sea salt rounded off the dish on a rather refreshing note. We were also shown a certificate of authenticity for the Wagyu beef. 

Our third course was a small oyster paired with foie gras and seasoned with sweet sake and truffle. The oyster sat atop a heap of organic spices including cinnamon and star anise, which added a level of smokiness to the dish. The ingredients went together very well and I had to stop myself from licking the oyster shell clean. 

The fourth course was an exquisite experience. Chef Omae came out with two ""secret"" boxes - the first was a delightful showcase of the best fish in season from Japan's renowned Tsukiji market. We had a sashimi platter of bluefin tuna, mackerel, gold-eyed red snapper, flounder and octopus. Alongside the sashimi were freshly grated wasabi and a house made soy sauce which had very rich notes and hints of bonito. The second box held a perfectly rounded chirashi with snow crab, bean curd skin, salmon roe and egg omelette. Everything was arranged beautifully. We enjoyed both boxes tremendously! 

The fifth course was a miso marinated salmon atop daikon radish. The flavors came together nicely though the salmon was a little dry. I enjoyed this but it would have been perfect if the fish had been moister. 

The sixth (and main) course was wagyu beef with a miso sauce mixed with sweet almonds and some chili powder. This was complemented by some Japanese sweet yams, chestnuts and spinach. The beef was cooked to tender perfection. The sauce was rich, and on the saltier side. But what we really liked was the crunch and sweetness of the almonds within. 

The seventh and last course was a tempura matcha ice cream with red beans, accompanied by a small platter of seasonal fruits and a chocolate macaron. The tempura crust tasted a little too heavy, and might have overwhelmed the refined taste of matcha. However the red bean paste at the bottom of the matcha ice cream rounded the dish off nicely with a light touch of sweetness. The chocolate macaron was delicious with a hint of citrus notes - it also had a great texture and crunch. The seasonal fruit platter was my favourite - pear, golden kiwi, raspberry and persimmon drenched in golden kiwi juice. 

Not only was the food delicious, service was impeccable. Please also note that they only have three seatings a night and only one party (from 2-10 guests) each time. It was an exquisite private dining experience and we are so thankful to have found this place. Chef Omae was also extremely hospitable!",ekOYZTSBD7tbE-EDFO-nnQ,2,0,5,_9jENME2ZDkWDJ0xdihPkQ

Came here for lunch during one of their special menus...You pretty much have to book a reservation- this place is tiny!

The only option for lunch that day was their tonkotsu ramen for $10.  The food was delicious and the service was awesome but I wish I could have had a bit more variety- like a salad or some side dish to give my palette a break in between the richness of the ramen.

I love the concept of this place but again, I was not expecting such a limited menu (although that's partly my fault for not reading the details).  I will likely try to stop by here again in the future to give it another try.",pjF0bsc228VVT2YDH4EcKw,0,0,3,tprGFujwN1VOYs6pNGlbXQ

1600397,2014-06-23,7,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"We were fortunate enough to have lunch here today - on their soft opening day.

This is a rare opportunity in Vegas to enjoy plates prepared by a Michelin starred chef himself, not just by a name on its signage.

Eventually this place will be a kaiseki restaurant - a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner - of only 12 seats, but due to limitated availability of uncommon ingredients required for kaiseki, liquor license, etc. they will only offer Japanese comfort food lunch in the coming months.

It was a three-course lunch for $20:

- First course: Triple layered vegetable soup served chilled - Seven vegetables in the first layer, soy sauce based brown gelée in the second layer, avocado and egg white with Japanese sake in the third layer
- Second course: Petite Assorted Appetizer - Flavored edamame, marinated cucumber with sweetened miso, yuzu flavored shrimp, soy flavored Japanese taro potato, deep fried lotus roots
- Main course (choose one from three): a) Chicken Rice Omelette - egg omelette over white steamed rice sautéed with ketchup, onion, green peppers, chicken, bacon and mushroom. b) Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle Soup Wok Charred - pork based ramen. c) Black Curry over Steamed Rice - traditional Japanese style curry over white steamed rice.

The first cource - the three layered soup was amazing. Very complex tastes mingled on my tongue, the potato-ish veggie flavor on the top followed by the sweet gelée, deepened with the avocado. All completely grated, but I was still able to tell the texture, scoop and taste individually or all at once.

There came the second, more traditional kaiseki-like appetizer. This time, we could see the basic attributes of natural ingredients were preserved, yet amusing presentation of craftsmanship was well displayed. The finish of shrimp was like what we eat for Osechi that would bring back old timey memories. Satoimo (Japanese taro) came with tangy rock salt. Cucumber came hocho-crafted with mildly sweet moromi-miso. Deep fried lotus roots had perfect crunchiness that played nice in the mix. However, the edamame was lacking the finishing touch. Not only that the flavor was nothing special, it felt awkward to pull out beans from the pod by hand.

We chose Omurice (Rice Omelette) and Tonkotsu Ramen for the main.

As much as I would like to say the Omurice was perfect, it was also pretty basic to be honest. Considering that Omurice has been less accepted in the US market, I can understand that the straightforward path is a safe bet, but for matured taste buds like ours, some you-cannot-do-it-at-home factors seemed to be missing. My personal preference is rice less steamed and eggs more runny. Also I personally like demi-glace sauce better, or at least the ketchup could use some twist.

Now the best part- the tonkotsu ramen! I was blown away. I know it's like cheating to compare ramen elaborated by a kaiseki chef with shops serving bowls in every 60 seconds, it was the best ramen I've had in this competitive Las Vegas market. The broth had very intricate flavors, but was not too greasy or heavy. Quite contrary, the aftertaste was pleasantly light. Chashu was a little sweetened, which added a unique perspective. Typically noodles are straight and thin for tonkotsu, but wavy noodles used by Omae worked to fully enjoy this rich-yet-not-too-rich broth.

In the end, all those three (plus drink) for $20 was a well considered price point. It's on a high-end for lunch, particularly for local clientele, but is a steal for the quality of food and service.

Some obvious opening day flaws aside, this place is very promising. I spotted some misses in the food as described above, but I will hold off my full review until they start offering kaiseki, a big missing piece in the Las Vegas culinary scene.

4 stars + 1 for a forward looking factor.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,27,17,5,EfV46M83UeUADQaxNycICw

1757313,2014-08-12,7,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"Chef Omae hails from Tokyo with two Michelin stars back home and a tiny new place down the street from Chinatown- reservations available for lunch only ($20/pp pre-fixe), dinner service starts in September at $100/pp, then goes up to $150 in October. 

Went in to celebrate our monthly ""anniversary"". This week's entree options included the tempura rice bowl, the chicken ramen, and the wagyu beef burger- which they were out of by our 1PM reservation.

First course was the VEGETABLE TERRINE- I was not expecting to like it much but it ended up being the highlight. Perfectly harmonious combination of jellied veggies with chicken and a mayo sauce on lotus leaf. BF called it one of the best things he's ever had. 

The TEMPURA OVER RICE, which sounded deceptively simple, was actually pretty phenomenal: lotus root, shrimp, snap pea, mushroom, and a single amazing scallop, all atop a great brown rice with ginger. Thin batter, perfectly cooked, very well balanced, this is a dish I'd order again.

Sadly, it was a bit downhill from there. The CHICKEN RAMEN was thick but the broth was missing something, resulting in a flat, one-note flavor. Thick, chewy noodles, and several additional ingredients mixed in made a filling bowl.

Dessert was the GREEN TEA TIRAMISU- The cream layer was amazing with just a touch of sweetness, but the bottom green tea layer was very gritty. 

Slightly bummed to miss the burger, may try to make it again before the end of the month. Figured we were better off with the more traditional entrees but was disappointed by the dish I'd hurried here to try- the ramen.

Overall, great value for the current special pricing and the intimate environment is perfect for a special event. Service was attentive and went the extra mile to email the day's menu prior to our reservation.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,7,4,8cXEIe4fCKeuX8xt65DtOA

BUT, it's worth the time and effort if you truly love the art of Japanese food. 

Incredible presentation, umami EVERYTHING, personalized service, new ingredients, exceptional knife skills, superb quality and interactive courses.

Reservations are required and made through their website.  They will email you several days before to confirm what menu you will be ordering. A text confirmation the day of also appeared on my phone.  Reservations currently are still easy to acquire.  

Make sure you are ON TIME, we were in the cab at 6:04PM and got a call. Eeks.

The service is a one man show.  He is energetic, efficient, will keep you updated on delays and hovers a bit.  

Ambiance is intimate and VERY quiet, don't even remember if there was music, but we felt like we had to whisper even in our large booth.  Décor is kind of 90s, white with black marble and beaded drapes.  Kimonos are displayed throughout.

Toilets are awesome, heated Japanese toilets with all the bootie cleaning bells and whistles.

TRUE sadness, their liquor license is still pending for about 6 more months, SO they only serve non-alcoholic drinks.  They comped two glasses of 'champagne' for us.  

There are four menus to choose from, one is for repeat guests, so we were not able to choose this time around.  We opted for Omakase 4: Signature, 7 courses and has more of a French spin to the dishes.

C1: Warm Appetizer, Clam, Crab, Seaweed and Mochi, seems simple, but was so delicate and fragrant, the crab was reconstructed, so soft and luscious.  
C2: Ama-ebi Tar-Tar, citris sorbet, caviar and a peach cream, sounds really odd, but somehow worked harmoniously together
C3: Steamed dish: foie gras and duck, amazing, who knew fresh wasabi could catapult a dish like this?!?
C4: Fish from Tsukiji, this course was so beautifully presented, blew us away.  Ika, Ikura, uni, crab, clams, snapper, different types of ginger, soy beans, plums, knotted ribbon like mochi and salted fish, reminded me of the Chinese version in fried rice, SO good.  We even got to brush and season our fish!  
C5: Simmered fish, buttery, lovely silken tofu, reminded me of a really elegant claypot type dish, scallions were cut with precision and balanced the richness of the dish
C6: Grilled Wagyu A5 beef, on the leaner side of the spectrum, so tender, all the natural flavors coming through, loved the wasabi mash and the bamboo shoots, I don't typically like bamboo, but they really take care to ensure they are cooked and seasoned properly here.  
C7: Desserts, Asian pear, red bean and chestnut, so simple, fresh and wonderful.  The tiramisu was also good, but my favorite was the red bean.

The A5 comes out with a birth certificate.  This was SO entertaining.  We literally talked about this the rest of the night.  

According to their website, not only do they get their fish from Tsukiji, they have their own fish buyer.  Every fish course was top notch.

I been to a few of these celebrity chef restaurants and was not really impressed. I had some VIP's to entertain, and checked out Yelp reviews. Like everybody has mentioned the place is very small, but nicely decorated. The food is why you come and Chef Omae didn't disappoint. Since they still don't have a liquor license, we were allowed to BYOB. 
We had a wonderful meal, won't go over the courses since they have been reviewed previously.
 I will add that Chef Omae did email me, and went over the dinner courses and asked about allergies. I informed him that 2 Guest weren't really fond of fish, and he adjusted their menu to suit their taste. 

Our VIP's were so impressed that they picked up the tab, and we took them to dinner! 
Chef Omae even took a picture with us. 
Thank You Chef Omae for a wonderful evening. You have created a life long memory and our VIP is a now business partner. I know why Morimoto, depends on you so much on the show.",_jBrBjAFq3KuOf2nGz2aqw,2,1,5,M9NhdmVYwMtuuScgMhDdWQ

Over the years, Las Vegas have become more food-centric than gaming-centric. There was a lot of talk about the soft opening of this restaurant. A $20 prix fixe 3-course lunch will be the test for the soft opening prior to moving on to a prix fixe dinner that maybe 5-6x that price. The lunch features an appetizer, main and dessert. At the time of this writing, the restaurant have started their dinner service. The menu is not set and will change on a daily basis. Overall, I would say if they hold the same quality from lunch to dinner, there will be no shortage of customers. Please note service is slower than usual due to the kitchen crew. You will pass the kitchen on your way to the lavatory, you will see why. Additionally, there are 4 tables (2 tables of 2 and 2 tables of 4), the seats are wider and comfortable. In other words, this is a meal thats suppose to be savored and not dine and go.

2206232,2014-07-23,4,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"The Skinny: given the level of fusion Japanese styled cuisine today, there's a lot of work that needs to be done  (2.5) service: the ambience is quiet and intimate with some discordant decorative aspects  - service was good but nothing outstanding (3) value: for $20 for 3 course meal plus beverage (fountain drink or housemade iced tea), it would be more than reasonable if the food was up to par. (3).

I really wanted to love this place. When we first spied it's soft opening in June, we were hankering to give it a go. Given the few truly legitimate Japanese restaurants in the valley, I was eager to try it.

First of all, this restaurant is very small and can seat at most maybe 14 people. Sporting only 4 tables, the dining experience here is very intimate. Reservations are a must. Unfortunately, next to one table, there is this massive bathtub looking spartan pond sporting some large looking koi. Hmm... kind of weird but okay. The seating consists of large white leather benches with high backs towering over you. The backs of the seats are kind of far, so I found myself slouching backwards to get comfortable.

The menu is a prix fixe menu with 3 courses plus a drink. The first two courses are set while the third provides you with a selection of three different main entrees. FYI - I found the cursive font to be too small and distracting - making it difficult to read. 

We both ordered the iced tea which was made with black tea. It was a little too weak for my taste - I like my tea brewed strong and robust to stand up to the ice.

Our first 2 courses were a chilled vegetable soup with custard/edamame and charred onion with chicken miso/bonito.

The chilled vegetable soup with custard really didn't do anything for me. I suppose the biggest thing was the actual custard on the bottom. It did not have the velvety smooth texture of a wonderful chawan mushi due to the addition of perhaps some bonito/dashi flavoring to the base. Serving it with a overly thick soup spoon was also not a great decision as well - causing the layers to get macerated while trying to eat it. Flavor profile wise, the taste of the fish with the scant sprinkling of roasted rice puff matched well together.

The charred onion with the bonito shavings and chicken miso was another huh? dish. I suppose charring the onion from the outside gave it a nice sweet root vegetable flavor. However having a hunk of thick chicken miso paste in the middle onion sliced in half was kind of an odd choice. So you tried to mix the half charred onion with the paste on the inside while trying to get a bit of the bonito shavings with each bite but that left the parts of the dish with too much or too little of the savory paste. Taste wise, it was okay but presentation needs work.

Our third courses we chose the chicken ramen and the wagyu beef burger. 

I was sorely disappointed by the chicken ramen. The broth while suitably thick was hopelessly lacking in chicken flavor. As a matter of fact - it was really bland and horribly under seasoned. In my humble opinion, if you can't get the broth right, it's a lose-lose situation. Although the chicken chasu and the marinated egg were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious, if the broth is bad? Forget it. Not to mention the ramen noodles were a tad over cooked. Would not recommend getting this dish.

The wagyu beef burger was a little underwhelming. First of all, the burger was medium well - emphasis on the well - which kind of defeats the purpose of using wagyu beef. The portion of the beef was overwhelmed by the large bun and the butter lettuce. This was served with some parmesan fries which were rather pedestrian.

I really wanted to love this place because I love Japanese cuisine and I hope this business succeeds. However given the level of cuisine today, I cannot highly recommend this place for lunch at this time.  That being said, depending on the dinner menu, I might be encouraged to return. 3-starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,6,3,3,j7vIqTRYXsGr3IBtXvGdpA

When first entering the restaurant, please don't judge the place by its decor.  Unfortunately, we did.  :/  You will forget all about that when the first course arrives.  Attention is turned to the great meal we were about to fall head over heals.  We had the $150 course and brought in our own sake.  They are working on their liquor license.  We brought couple of different kinds of sake (dry and lightly sweet) as we did not know what to expect.  The menu changes week to week, so it was difficult to plan ahead.

Three Layer Cold Soup: Surprisingly good. The waiter encouraged us to mix it up. It's served in a cup-like bowl with the kind of soup spoon I ate cereal with as a kid. Make sure you dig up that bottom layer when you mix because the flavor is strong on its own. Also, circle crunchies!

Appetizer: Each person received a giant bowl with an artful arrangement of food. It was a fun experience to go through all the pieces: seasoned edamame on a toothpick, a small fried potato-really nice, a single shrimp (didn't taste like it had yuzu), fried lotus root- like chips, and an intricately cut cucumber with a delicious strong sauce on top (try to distribute the sauce so every bite has some, otherwise it's just cucumber).

Then a choice of chicken ramen, an omelet, or black curry.

Chicken Ramen: Holy cow, this is the best ramen I've had in a long time. I wanted to put the broth in my eyes. It was perfect. The next best part was the egg. We split it open and GUSH comes the yolk. I could have licked the sides of the bowl.

Black Curry: I must be accustomed to a more down home curry. All the ingredients were so nice, like, too nice. The cuts of beef were luxurious, I wish they weren't smothered in sauce. Mushrooms were a different touch for me too. It came with lettuce drizzled in katsu sauce and pickled radish. Not sure how to feel about it.

At the end we spent over an hour there and we were full. This seems like a nice place to take a date. And for what it is the price is reasonable. I hear the burger is great so I think I may come back.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,4,3,4,TWhAz6amhvIn4_wnK3fr0g

Not sure how Omae is anything but five stars on Yelp, but holy baby jesus. (Just kidding, I know how - you'll notice every review after 08/18/2015 gives them five stars. Rightfully so because that's when they changed their seating/menu structure/etc.)

There are no hidden tricks.

This is one of those meals. 

Everything that Hiroyuki and our chef did today was over the top and amazing. I was head over heels.

Ambiance: quiet and refined, decor was a chic and quiet jazz music played in the background. The place is very intimate and also had a koi pond with profiles on each fish, if you're in between courses you get to see the stars and feed them!

We had the omakase meal #2 which was a 7 course meal.. Last minute addition of another course and some ingredients switched up but it was WELL WORTH IT. Note this isn't your typical Japanese fare. This is a fusion place with soft touches of Italy and France in these meals. 

1. 4 layer tartare: caviar, tomato purée, shrimp tartar , citrus creme with rice croutons

2. Miso peanut butter fondue with egg, black sesame with garden veggies 

3. Roasted oysters with foie gras and sea urchin 

4. Soup: Chinese broccoli, clam, grilled cod, fish balls in a daikon broth and olive oil

5. Sashimi imported from the Tokyo market: red snapper, squid, salmon, salmon roe, abalone, needle fish and fresh wasabi paste (grated on shark skin)

6. Lobster risotto 

7. Wag yu beef imported from a province in Japan with a truffled mashed potatoes- green onion wasabi and a key lime to a palate cleanser 

8. Chocolate soufflé with truffle butter and ginger ice cream

9. Marscappone ice cream over red bean, chestnuts and rice crackers with a green tea sauce


Each course was light and flavorful, the use of truffles really mirrored what I seek for in dishes (and I even ate shaved truffles on my dishes in a diff meal last night)

The thanks I have for sharing such an amazing experience cannot be forgotten. Every course was amazing and I will be back.

Next, the food was good. Not great. Intense flavor on the first dish, but everything else was okay. The black curry I had I could have made at home from the package from Von's. The chicken ramen was good and it made me wish I could have chosen a different dish. Maybe the curry just isn't good.

3014512,2014-07-28,0,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"I discovered a very filling and unique adventure at Omae, one that made me realize the potential that food has to become its best in the most simplest forms.  What Omae does in a short amount of time and with only three courses provided a very quiet but exciting experience.  With a small restaurant to seat up to 12 people (2 four-tops and 2 two-tops), reservations are required, and there are three times to arrive for lunch: 11am, 12pm, or 1pm.  We chose the last seating of lunch and arrived a few minutes early just in case.  We did have to wait since the meal was running behind for the last group from 12pm, but it was a nice wait.  There are 5-figure koi swimming around a tank to look at.  

Once seated, we received a menu on a square serving plate and chose one of the three options for entrees, and I chose the wagyu burger.  The server, who handles all the tables solo, was very attentive and made sure that the kitchen wasn't overwhelmed with orders.  Each table flowed a certain way.

The three course menu is simple and sweet, set beautifully with summer.  It progressed the way most courses do--from light to filling.  The colors and flavors made the experience even more enjoyable.  We started with the chilled edamame soup atop savory custard.The small rice puffs gave this chilled soup a lovely texture.  I didn't mix it to make a creamy soup; rather, I dug through the layers and ate it as it was presented.To the left in the spoon lies the custard base, followed by the lovely edamame soup on the right.  As I ate it, the texture changed from a watercress type of soup to a creamy and light one.  The rice puffs added this unique crispy texture to the experience.  I enjoyed every spoonful.  

When this second course arrived of a charred onion with chicken miso and bonito flakes, I was taken aback.  I never experienced an appetizer of what is basically a baked onion with miso and bonito on top.  I leapt in with an open mind, however, and happily ate the sweet and salty second course with pleasure.  The soft and sweet onion is a great vessel to showcase the miso and chicken on top.  The bonito flake gives it a light, briny taste.  I pulled every sweet petal from the skin, never once looking up to acknowledge my partner for the meal, only eating in utter silence, happy and marking this one on my list of favorite things to eat.

After finishing the second course, I was excited for my wagyu burger, chef's way, of course.  He added melted cheddar, red onions, tomato, and lettuce, with a wasabi sauce.  The burger is sloppy, juicy, with burger juice and melted cheese running down my hand--and I loved every bite. The meat wasn't hidden by any of the toppings at all.  I could taste the burger perfectly.  The parmesan fries weren't abandoned.  I ate every single one, even using my finger to wipe up the parmesan shavings on the plate once everything else was gobbled up.  Crispy, salty, cheesy--it was a perfect side for a great burger.

We left with bellies full and look forward to the next luncheon at Omae.  With 3 current options for entrees--wagyu burger, thick ramen, or omurice--I have to come back and try the entire menu before it changes with the seasons.

Thank you, Omae, for a great experience.

I would say that the first visit was  Absolutely the best, and the few more visits afterwards were a mixed bag of more misses than hits.

CHILLED CHAWANMUSHI WITH EDAMAME AND CRISPY RICE
Flavorful and refreshing, I wished there was more of this teaser portion

ROASTED ONION WITH CHICKEN MISO AND BONITO
Simple, packed with flavor, and if anyone can pull off elevating a simple onion on a plate, it would be Chef Omae

VEGETABLE TERRINE
Tasted this first course twice...enjoyed it the first time paired with micro greeens and an aioli...second time, the terrinne was half the portion with some chicken added to it which made it seem like the chicken didn't belong there in the first place

CHICKEN RAMEN
Tasted this entree twice...the first time, the consistency was thick, milky, and delicious and the second time, the broth was fluid, brown, and the flavor was underdeveloped. The Noodles and egg were spot on both times.

ASSORTED TEMPURA
This was the most disappointing entree which looked more like a first course...borderline rubber shrimp and a skimpy cluster of veggies atop a tiny mound of mushy disappointing rice...from a Michelin starred Japanese Chef? Totally unexcusable. What a let down, and all that time I was just thinking of the bomb-ass Ten-Zaru Combo at I-Naba...:( They must've changed it up because Al Mancini was in the house on a later visit and was all raves about it

WAGYU BURGER
Wifey had this on our first visit, and I enjoyed that buttery bite, I was sure to get it on a future visit. When I finally got my own burger on a later visit, the burger seemed to have shrunk, cheese was missing on the fries(and so were half the fries) and instead came in a cup. The house made ketchup came in a sizable bowl the first time, but was reduced to a smear on a tiny plate on our most recent visit.

MATCHA TIRAMISU
Great flavor, but lacking in presentation, random inconsistent pieces on two different visits

Lunch service is a thing of the past now, and for those willing to splurge on Omae's Omakase Dinners starting at $100, Good luck, and hope it's worth it!  ALOHA!!!

The first time coming here, dare I say, is originally because I just wanted to eat here not only for the food, but to really say that I've been there. You enter, and it's just so intimate, quiet, beautiful. Probably look like what a geisha would like if it were in the form of a restaurant? The layout looked similar to those Cohin (or Cohen?) designed establishments, with that infamous bidet feature in the bathroom. Then, I came for seconds, and now I intend to go for thirds..hopefully fourths. The food is just incredible, and you can't help but want to go back for more.

Key takeaways:

I've never had chilled soup until I came here and Chef Omae had served it to us. Nor have I ever experienced eating half an onion either. Your servings of the first and second courses are surely one that plays outside of your normal or cliche Japanese dishes (sushi or teriyaki anything). For sure his chilled soups are truly one of a kind and definitely a must try. Super refreshing, light, but yet has these nice layers of flavor and texture. 

RAMEN BROTH - is a foodly equivalent to Natalie Portman's presence and personality. Smart, sophisticated, beautiful, and rich. It's by far the best broth I've ever tasted. A lot of you might argue against that, but the broth is so thick, flavorful, and rich. It's the perfect thickness of the broth I think that gets me. First time I ordered the pork ramen which was heaven, and luckily I was able to try Yuhi's chicken broth. Dare I say that I might like the chicken ramen better just because the chicken in it has this nice sweet flavor almost had me mistaken it for pork.

WAGYU BEEF BURGER- Man...his seasoning in it and combination is far from what my mouth would normally expect from a burger. It had that good salty/garlic seasoning too that it kind of gives your taste buds a nice smack in its metaphorical ass.

The evening began with our server bringing drinks.  We all had iced tea save one who had bottled water.   Both green and black teas are served.

Course 1 -- Our Sakizuke or amuse-bouche was salmon roe and mushroom with grated daikon and ponzu sauce.

Course 2 -- Our Zensai consisted of sweet shrimp tartar, celeriac purée, and tomato sorbet.

Course 3 -- The Mushimono course was steamed scallop, mozzarella and grated turnip, and brown sauce.

Course 4 -- The Sashimi course consisted of varieties of fresh fish from Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo served in a large bowl.

Course 5 -- The Sumiyaki was overnight charcoal grilled white fish with truffle soy sauce and served on a round bed of rice.

Course 6 -- For Teppan, we had our choice of grilled wagyu or grilled Kobe (up charge of $80 for the Kobe).  The steak was served with roasted onion and wasabi mashed potatoes.

For dessert, we were brought a large round platter with various desserts including delicately peeled grapes to look like flower petals, mochi strawberries, blueberries, green tea tiramisu and other delights.

The meal was very good, paced nicely, and with the classic Japanese attention to detail in plating and choice of service dishes.  Some of the highlights for me were: the rice served with the white fish was absolutely delicious; the tomato sorbet with the sweet shrimp was another winner;  finally, the steak and wasabi potatoes were very good.  Portions are small for American habits.

It was a relaxing dinner with good food and lots of great conversation.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,12,4,JILSumQ967G6vq-E6mkHQA

4107078,2014-08-20,1,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"I got to eat food prepared by a Michelin starred chef, while sitting at the only table in his restaurant, and I got to shake his hand afterward. How cool is that?

I'm still over the moon and grateful for the opportunity that, as Nelson Q. pointed out, will disappear in just a couple of weeks when chef Takeshi Omae transitions completely from his $20 soft opening prix fixe lunch to his actual $100 prix fixe dinner. It was an added bonus that we ended up being the only 2:30pm reservation today, so we even got to sit at the table for 4 despite being only a pair of hungry diners. They actually flipped the sign on the door from ""Open"" to ""Closed"" after we sat down. It was a serendipitous VIP-like experience.

Decor is nice. Lighting is fairly muted. Music and koi pond water are both fairly relaxing. Menu is a bit hard to read with the small font and dim lighting (and some interesting typos), but it was nice to have it presented to us in a dish of its own.

One beverage is included in the price, so I chose iced green tea. It is solid, authentic iced matcha tea. It tasted better before dessert, so I didn't find much value in the included refill.

On to the food. First course was the vegetable terrine with ginger chicken. It's a very modest portion of each and is paradoxically served in a gigantic bowl. The ginger chicken is served cold with a creamy sauce, and it is about as good as you can reasonably expect it to be. The vegetable terrine was sweet overall, with a soft gelatin surrounding crunchy vegetables. I wasn't dazzled, but I don't think that would have been a reasonable expectation anyway from just an appetizer.

We both chose the same second course, the pork tonkotsu ramen. Tempura with rice and wagyu burger both sounded interesting, but neither of them were compelling enough for me. Owing to inadvertent VIP status, I received my ramen fairly quickly after I had finished my appetizer. The ramen is served with an almost awkwardly wide spoon that I would call a very shallow ladle, and they currently have bamboo chopsticks, so I'm curious to hear whether they get fancy for dinner.

Immediately, I tasted the broth, which was filled with savory pork goodness and surprisingly light on salt. The thin noodles are chewy, meeting the standard for good ramen. The chashu is meaty and quite delicious. The bamboo shoots are juicy, with perhaps the most actual bamboo flavor that I've had in bamboo prepared for ramen. The egg does not have a runny yolk, which is actually par for the course as far as I've seen, but the yolk somehow seems marinated despite the egg remaining wholly intact. It reminds me more of the hard-boiled look but with a softer solid, I suppose. The fungus (excuse my lack of knowing the actual name) and green onions helped to round out the flavors. Overall, I can't definitively say that it's the best pork tonkotsu ramen that I've experienced, but it is very clearly in the top tier.

Dessert was green tea tiramisu, and it may have been the highlight. It is not heavy at all in either the cake or the cream, but it is sweet, moist, full of matcha flavor, and assertive without being overpowering. It is more of a substantial portion than the appetizer is. I think this is actually my favorite green tea cake to date.

After dessert and taking care of the check, we walked around to the koi pond. My friend actually has some experience with koi and asked our host (""server"" just doesn't seem right) about the koi, which we had seen listed table side as having a firm sale price in the tens of thousands. Turns out that they are actually really hard to grow to such a large size while retaining the colorful variations in their scales, most large koi being entirely black. Interestingly enough, they don't actually feed the koi more than once a month.

Toward the end of the koi conversation, chef Omae actually walked out, which I had been quietly hoping for all along. We told him how much we enjoyed the food and thanked him for it. And yes, I really did get to shake his hand (although, come to think of it, I probably should have bowed).

If pressed, I would admit that it's a 4.5 or even a 4 star value for the food. The fifth star is for the intangibles. I certainly hope to come back for dinner eventually and I wish chef Omae the best of luck.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,5,43t4TrCig4Mnc7XQE6j2rg

Aside from the very small and intimate venue, he is currently only open for lunch. While small, his other parties were running behind so we had to wait an extra 30 minutes despite having/forced to have reservations. As an apology we were offered free dessert which I will address later.

For the main courses we could select from tonkotsu ramen, black curry, or omurice (omelette on rice). Seeing as how I wanted to experience what this chef could deliver I ordered the ramen and the curry.

The wok charred pork tonkotsu ramen was decent, and the charred actually translated into a burnt flavor. Decent but not as good as say monta or ippudo in Japan.

The curry was a black beef curry that actually was better than the ramen, but still you could get a better curry at a real curry joint like Zen curry. I could tell that he used high quality beef, prime if not better but in the end both dishes weren't anything outstanding and you could find better alternatives, even locally.

The dessert was some sort of green tea tiramisu, but it just failed to be a tasty dessert, we didn't even bother trying to finish it.

Despite the location, I am not rating below 5 stars as everything presented was done with outstanding flavor and subtle panache. This was a dining experience not to be missed by any lover of Japanese dining. 

Kudos to all the Yelpers who've nailed the exceptional estaminet with words and picts. But even you must agree... If a picture is worth a thousand words, then dining at Omae's must be worth a hundred thousand words.

The chilled soup was good. I didn't like it as much as my husband did. The charred onion was the second course and I wasn't impressed. You definitely need the miso chicken paste that comes with it to make it taste like something edible. The onion was steaming hot though when it came out. For the main entree I decided to go with the chicken ramen and the husband got the Wagyu burger. My ramen lacked flavor....it was really thick so I'm sure there was a bunch of fatty goodness but it was so bland. I had to use the chili paste that was given but even then I didn't enjoy it. I do have to say the pork was flavorful but it didn't save the ramen. My husband enjoyed his burger and his fries but it wasn't worth $20. 

Overall service was good. Would I come back for $48 lunch? Nope. If they ever serve dinner I might pop back in but for me it was just ok.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,7,6,3,g2zQjIUKm1h90utKHbkbIQ

Wifey and I came here on our last minute date night. I read about the restaurant opening a while back, but never had the chance to eat here because I moved back to California before this place opened. My awesome co-worker offered to watch the baby and let us have a night out. 

Food here is created and executed by Takeshi Omae, a Michelin awarded chef. Dinner requires reservations, so make sure you call ahead. We had their Omakese (Chef's Creation) Premium Shabu Shabu dinner which ran $100/Person. Before you close out and find another place to eat tonight... continue reading... the meal was actually a steal. 

For this particular evening: 

Warm Appetizer - Chawan Mushi (Steamed Egg) with asparagus, seafood, and froe gras - Sounds simple right? It was a fantastic way to start the meal and get a glimpse of the culinary artistry we were about to experience. Originally I thought it was a soup, but after digging towards the bottom, i realized I was actually eating Chawan Mushi. It was ridiculous how Chef Omae could get such texture and consistency out of simlpy steaming eggs.  The eggs were literally well seasoned clouds. 

Sashimi - Fresh cuts of Sashimi flown straight from Tsukiji fish market in Japan. It was actually a work of art and arranged beautifully. 

Tempura Appetizer - airy, lightly battered shrimp. 

Shabu Shabu - This portion of the meal was educational and heartbreaking, but delicious. The server came out with the birth certificate of the kobe beef we were about to eat. He explained that REAL kobe beef will come with a birth certificate. If you eat elsewhere and want to question if it's real Kobe Beef, just request to see the certificate. It was sad to see that the cow only lived for 2 years and it had a name and a nose print, but man... he did not die in vain. We ate every little piece of him and toasted to his life. Apparently Kobe beef get VIP treatment and have a short life span anyways. 

Black Truffle Risotto - This was a filler food (as most rice dishes served at the end) and an interesting take on french and japanese cruise. Perfectly cooked risotto with fragrant truffle oil. 

Super sad that they closed the door. Hope to see Omae again!",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,3,5,5,XCilUeeLfTs-qtL8KfMIXQ

Don't let the strip mall location put you off, it feels like a super secret hideaway location in maybe not the swankiest part of town, but once you're inside, you forget that part very quickly. The interior is tastefully decorated, giving a feeling of warmth and friendliness. I loved the mix of modern and Japanese decor.

The food is every bit as amazing as you could ever imagine having a Michelin star chef actually prepare the food for you. Ingredients were top notch, wonderfully prepared, and every dish was well balanced. I've had dreams of this meal months later!

The service was spotless, but mind you, we were the only table that night. It was fascinating to hear about each dish, the source of ingredients, and its preparation. We did take longer to enjoy every mouthful than most, but we were never rushed, just checked in on to make sure the next course wasn't brought out too early.

1. Chawanmushi with asparagus- super light, flavorful, egg was cooked perfectly
2. Sashimi platter (halibut, sweet shrimp, uni, oyster with caviar, salmon roe with rice): all super fresh and tasty, with freshly-grated wasabi
3. Fried fishcake- made from the halibut with a sweet chili glaze (probably the weakest item IMO)
4. Shabu shabu (with certified Wagyu beef and Kurobota pork)- the soup base was sweet and rich (almost like sukiyaki?), filled with noodle, tofu, and veggies including carrot, onions, and scallions. It also came with a sesame foie gras dipping sauce (but couldn't really taste foie gras).
5. Risotto with shaved truffle- basically porridge made with the broth from your soup, with added egg and pork
6. Dessert- interesting platter including a mochi with red bean and fresh strawberry on the inside, chocolate souffle with ginger ice cream, etc.

Our server was extremely professional and knowledgeable. We learned about the use of fresh wasabi (even got to grate it ourselves) and saw and learned about the certificate for the Wagyu beef. He also even took a picture for us (special occasion), and had one developed and printed for us before we left.

2nd course- Petite appetizer. It was very simple and plain, and wished I had more of the paste on the side. Still, decent and beautiful plating. 

3rd course (you can get omurice, ramen, black curry) - I got the ramen which was very rich. The broth was thick that it was almost like sauce. The flavor was nice and I didn't think it was overly salty for being reduced down. The pork slices were tender, and I always appreciate getting a whole egg.

The 5th course was sashimi using goods flown in from that Tokyo fish market, and it was buttery soft deliciousness.  The 6th course was wagyu beef (first time I've had it) and I didn't know beef could be so tenderly delectable (makes me think these are the Japanese cows that get pampered/boozed up and massaged by their handlers).  From now on I'm ordering wagyu beef if it's on the menu (I think I've seen it on Carnevino, Cut, etc, menus but I had stuck with American beef to be price-conscious). 
- The 7th course was dessert and I liked the green tea tiramisu but I loved the ginger ice cream (does that make it healthy?).  For a drink I had the iced green tea which was a hearty iced drink.

Understand, if your idea of Japanese is Raku, Yonaka Modern, or heaven forbid, Goyemon, this is not your place.  Think barMASA minus several hundred bucks.

The components are there, from the authentic dishes showcasing Japanese aesthetics, and suability to the very intimate dining space and 2014 trendy, sketchy strip mall location.  That said, don't go expecting a Michelin dining experience straight from Tokyo rather honest, Japanese food in an environment to match.

Yes, the chef comes from Michelin pedigree.  Yes, he has worked with Morimoto at XEX.  But in true Japanese style, Omae himself is the chef and personally prepares the dishes served.

Selections form the three course lunch menu showcase the chefs talent.  An incredible multi layer vegetable soup with a base of sweet edamame and mixed green veg puree with shitake, above a sweetened earthy soy gelee and to top it off, an airy puree of avocado and sake.  The unevenness of each spoonful elevates the enjoyment.  Sometimes more earthy and salty, other times sweet vegetal flavors with the aroma of the sake.

The chicken based ramen, atypical of any single Japanese regional specialty, showcases an intense chicken broth thickened with its own collagen, hints of sake, soy, and sesame that envelopes perfectly cooked, toothsome wide ramen noodles.  Tender pieces of mirin marinated then just grilled through chicken atop with a soft poached egg.  Very well balanced dish.

If these dishes are any indication of what we can expect from the chef as he expands to dinner service, this could be a real winner.

Note:  $20 three course lunch only until 08.31.14.  $100 multi course dinner 09.03.14 until the end of the month,  $150 thereafter.  Reservations for dinner service required.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,26,23,4,pWbtvSP6ipZBVA4tg6llnA

Plus, it's so affordable it's worth at least 1 visit, maybe 2, or 3--really it depends on the menu. Speaking of menus... Omae, please. I generally don't carry a magnifying glass with me. USE NON-SCRIPT FONT LARGER THAN 4pt. My personal suggestion, Helvetica. A classic.

I've been here twice on two different menus. Each had a chilled soup, a vegetable course + an entree. The chilled soups here are phenomenal. If you've never had a soup cold, this would be an excellent place to start and acclimate yourself. They're vegetable based, creamy, and amazing. One had an egg custard on the bottom which was phenomenal.

The 2nd course always leaves something to be desired. Not bad just not special. Visit #1 consisted of a deconstructed shrimp salad. It was a miniature vegetable plate with a prawn for substance. Visit #2 was a half of a carmelized onion w/ miso paste. Tasty but just eh. 

Here's where your meal is either worth it, or not. If you're ordering Omurice as your entree, you just got ripped off--badly. If you order something more substantial, i.e. Ramen. It's 100% worth it to eat here. Omurice = Fried rice wrapped in egg. I've had many a fried rice(s) and Omae does not make the best. If you need fried rice in your life, holla and I'll steer you in the right direction. There was also a Wagyu burger on the menu which, while tasty, was not all that special. Personally, I''ve found that the ramen is a guaranteed delicious time as well as the only way to get your money's worth. I've had chicken and pork based ramen here and they were both excellent. Don't let a chicken-based broth frighten you. It's much richer than it sounds. They also have thicker, chewier noodles. woo.

Toqued by Takeshi Omae, a man bestowed stars from Michelin in Japan and one with plans to expand his culinary concepts stateside, Japanese Cuisine by Omae originally launched at 3650 South Decatur a few months back and with early praise lavished on the $20 lunch it was finally in September that the twelve seat space debuted its true vision, a $100 Omakase to which myself and four friends sat down on Saturday night.  Intimate in size with a pair of four-tops and a duo of two seaters set beneath subdued chrome lights in hushed dining area decorated with kimono and koi it was just moments before our 5:30 reservation that our group settled in and with beverage service currently limited to non-alcoholic options green tea and sparkling water ordered, our one-man service team keeping cups brimming throughout our seven-course experience while presenting each dish in great detail.  Measured in pace with portions trending small as the two-man kitchen turned out edible works of art without a single detail overlooked it was with a textbook bite of delicate tempura set next to briny baubles of salmon roe that our meal began and progressing next to dishes melding sweet shrimp with tomato sorbet and briny to soft mozzarella the team's creativity took the spotlight early, a large bowl of elegantly plated, though unfortunately common, sashimi selections reigning things in before moving to plates more substantial.  To this point impressed, though not particularly 'wowed' by any single course, it was finally the Sumiyaki that saw all five of us swoon as umami-rich rice provided a crispy juxtaposition to flaky fish and finishing up with reference standard beef, simply prepared with a light kiss from the grill, alongside aromatic mashed potatoes preceding a board of small, elegant desserts plus Japanese 6-hour drip coffee the evening ended strong, no one particularly full but everyone discussing how Las Vegas needs more restaurants of this kind.

Undeniably a dining 'experience' as opposed to a simple meal it will be interesting to see how well Omae fares in its current format, the pricetag apparently prone to an increase of $50 at the end of the month.  Oddly located, though really no more-so than Raku or Kabuto, and easily on par with the skill-set of any Strip-based omakase while proving quite capable of sourcing premium ingredients including A5 Kobe direct from Japan the longevity of Omae will be dependent, largely, on the support of locals and in a city where the 'next big thing' is never more than a week away I truly hope the restaurant finds it audience early on and word of mouth spreads quickly, though I must say even the current pricepoint makes me leery.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,4,JJJFwUHhkAOzwp_80ydZ0A

I would like to star by saying that I have eaten in many top restaurants in the world, including a few Michelin star rated ones and I have eaten in Japan as well; I say that because I want the reader to know that my expectations were high. I read about this relatively new restaurant a while back and tried to get a reservation last month but could not. We got in for a late dinner Wednesday and for some reason we were the only ones there. 
The experience was amaZing. We chose the 7 course dinner. Everything was beautifully presented and the taste was amazing. Chef Omae came out often and explained what we were eating and where it came from. I cannot remember the name of all the dishes but they were all very special in their own way. The sashimi came from the Tokyo fish market. We also had Wagyu beef. I added pictures of all of dishes. We were so full by desert that I could barely finish. My boyfriend had to help me. This restaurant is top notch. Do not be fooled by its location. It should be at the Wynn or Bellagio, but it is what makes it even more special. THe place only seats 12 ppl. It has a koi pond, beautiful statue, and kimonos on display.
The plates and silverware are beautiful. He makes all his own soy sauce and other sauces in house. The wasabi is grated fresh, not the powder mix you normally see at sushi bars. Overall, an amazing memorable experience. I would definitely recommend it and we will return! 
When our cab came to pick us up, Chef Omae and the waitress (sorry forgot her name but she was lovely) came out to say goodbye. It was so special!!",O-uKwR-Yx6Papw0oB4hkeA,2,2,5,l7UCStoatyQHDEArxMsX4g

When I heard that he offers a $20 per person lunch with three courses that sounded great, I immediately made reservations for the boyfriend and I.  A small place at the corner of Decatur and Twain, the 12 seat restaurant currently takes reservations for two parties of two and two parties of four at 11:30am, 1:00pm, and 2:30pm.  They are supposed to open up for dinner when the liquor license is secured.  We ate here on a recent Friday afternoon at 1:00pm.  The place is nicely decorated with kimonos and there's a pond with koi for sale with price tags that range from $4,500 to $14,000--wowza!  We were seated at a nice booth next to the pond where we saw the koi ads with the price tags so that's how I know.
There was one waiter who took care of all the customers, which really wasn't that difficult since only three of the four tables were occupied when we were there.  He was very friendly and attentive.  A prix fixe lunch menu, we began with a chilled layered soup with egg and avocado.  Unluckily for Mel, he's allergic to avocado, so I saved his life by eating his portion--so good!  The second course was an assortment of appetizers, including edamame beans on a toothpick, fried lotus root, and cucumber with miso.  We got to choose the third course from a short list.  I opted for the chicken ramen soup and Mel had the rice omelette with chicken.  Chicken ramen soup was a first for me and it was delicious, with a tasty broth that wasn't too salty and noodles cooked just right.  A generous portion, I couldn't even finish the whole bowl, which doesn't usually happen when I eat ramen.  
The menu has changed since we ate there last week and I already have reservations for my next visit because I want to try the Wagyu burger next. Speaking of the menu, the paper one there has tiny, tiny font, which makes for a lot of squinting.  I even broke out the reading specs and still couldn't make out a lot of it.  Other than that,  for a unique dining experience that won't break the bank, make your reservations, too; it's not every day that you get to eat a meal prepared by a Michelin man.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,12,10,4,z1tsCq4cQmc-5276ABuhMA
5793742,2015-05-17,0,Y1LB0uDuJQ1jP5usRdsZZg,"I had the 7 course Omakase and it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  I've eaten a lot of gourmet food and a lot of excellent kaiseki/omakase style meals and it's gotten rare for me to have a meal that I love so much I can't shut up about it, but this was one of those meals.

I'm not going to review each dish individually, mostly because I feel like I'd be selling them short with my descriptions, but we had a total of 10 courses and every single one of them was better than the last.

The service was very friendly and helpful, as you'd expect at any good Japanese restaurant.  Chef Omae himself came out a few times to explain the elements of a particular dish or ask us how we felt about it.

After paying the bill, we left the restaurant pretty quickly and Chef Omae literally ran out after us in order to thank us each personally and make sure we were satisfied.  That's a level of humility and care that you don't typically see from Michelin-starred chefs.

For some reason it's still pretty easy to get a reservation here, but eventually this place is going to be discovered.  With only 12 seats and Chef Omae's desire to personally run his kitchen, it's going to be very challenging to get a table.  Anyone who really appreciates an amazing meal needs to make a reservation right now and get in here ASAP before that happens.",DgUpYXJsEEgIqxGBZFGTGw,2,2,5,3JXMYx0z1O2vohUBm7U9Kg
