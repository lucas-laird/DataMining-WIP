I was here with my husband to smoke some hookah in their lounge on a Saturday night.  It wasn't busy and that's probably due to the effects of the current economy.  We ordered our hookah and then I ordered a tea which they would not serve to me in the hookah lounge.  However, they serve coffee!  Having lived in the Middle East, I told the server it was tradition to serve tea with Hookah.  After that, I really didn't want anything but was told I had to order something since there was a 1 drink minimum.  People, in this economy, you would think they would make an exception seeing business is down everywhere.  Instead the lounge manager was rude when we asked to speak with him and we promptly walked out and took our business to Stephano's opposite UNLV where we were treated like we were the only customers in the world!

Try sitting near the wall.  

Let's move on to food... using a 5-point rating:

3/5 Shrimp artichoke dip with pitas. Pita had mold on it so look carefully. But the dip is flavorful.

4/5 Chicken pita.  They have been inconsistant with the chicken portion and sometimes it comes out dry.  But the overall flavor is good and it's a good size...sometimes.

5/5 Athen's Fries are great (seasoned with paprika, garlic and italian seasoning). It comes with with ""fat"" sauce, which the main ingredients are mayo, ketchup, paprika, italian seasoning, garlic powder etc.

5/5 Baklava was good but a bit on the small size. 

4/5 Hummus was a nice consistancy and flavor, again, watch out for moldy pita bread.

I usually get Chicken Tandoori and it comes with a healthy dose of rice and vegetables and a chutney for dipping. Occasionally I'll opt for some pasta and every option is delicious. The penne pesto is about $10.95, but you can get the same exact dish for a dollar less off the all you can eat pasta menu. The bolognese is very traditional and hearty, goes perfectly with the spaghetti.

My girlfriend always gets a bowl of lentil soup and occasionally the farfalle with  roasted garlic cream sauce or the chicken pita, or marsala. Both are fantastic.

I love sitting in the indoor courtyard between the dining room and hookah lounge.  I spend a good ten minutes everytime I'm there trying to read the script that lines the walls at the ceiling.  I sit back into my comfy sofa and relax --it's usually much quieter than the dining room.  If I'm with a group, the sampler platter is a staple--excellent hummus, loads of the best pitas I've found in Vegas, great olives, the fries with Greek seasoning, baba ganosh, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, and plenty of tzatziki sauce.  The three dip platter is a great option too.  I seriously recommend the hummus, yogurt cucumber dip, and bouranni...also served with all the delicious, fresh pitas you can handle.  

Their lentil soup is to die for.  Their falafel and tahini sauce are addictive.  Guy loves the gyro pita, which is HUGE (like as big as my head huge).  Now they even give the option to have your pita wrapped instead...but how could you say no to those pitas?  Plus, pita means the paper bag, and you should always ""Protect yourself, keep it wrapped!""  Sometimes I get the ""falamus"" pita--falafel, lettuce, tomato, and hummus instead of tahini sauce.  Of course, NOTHING is complete until it's properly doused in their super yummo Racy Red Sauce--their house blend of spices, vinegar, and tabasco.

I am terribly sad they closed their market down.  I had just decided to buy a hookah when I went in one day and it was gone.  BUT, no market means expansion which means more tables which means I never have to wait to be seated!

Oh yeah, if you really want all your teeth to fall out of your head, you have to try the baklava.  I almost cried.",ScAkGG5VXHNpnMYsGtaadg,3,2,4,clAZSwXFf-UWmnQMQf_JNw

We were after Mediterranean cuisine, so can't really tell much about italian dishes there. We went with apperizer combo platter, ground beef kebab, vegetarian dish with couscous (forgot the name) and moussaka. For dessert we had bachlava, tiramisu and arabic coffee.

All dishes were good size, we did it family style for 4 adults and 2 kids, everyone was full at the end.

Without question, I always NEED the Paymon's french fries and dipping sauce.  Hands down these are some of my favorite fries ever!  But who goes to a Mediterranean Cafe for French Fries???  Me.  Okay, I also enjoy the other food!  

On this day I ordered the traditional lamb Gyro in a pita (not the pita pocket).  Paymon's gyros offer the best combination of ingredients.  Plenty of veggies, just enough sauce, and just enough meat.  I couldn't eat the whole thing, it was too big!

As some others have said in their reviews, the Passion Fruit Iced Tea is a big hit for me as well.  I LOVE their Lentil soup - simple but flavorful and served with a side of pita.  

Paymon's does not have ""Lunch Specials"" and a typical lunch here can run about $15.  If you want a cheaper gyro meal, you will have to go elsewhere.

Paymons is a great hangout place if you're a hookah lover or not.  The flavor selection is great, you can blend your own and come up with something new every time.

I don't care if you just ate, eat some more!!

The Athens fries are a favorite, but you gotta try their pesto pizza, I recommend pepperoni, mushrooms, and pepperoncinis.  There's just something magical about that combination.  Hookah wings, hummus, and the calamari are all winners as well.

I assure you, you haven't see service until you've meet the crew here.

I can honestly say that this must be the worst hookah experience I've ever had. There was no smoke at all and all my friends were trying to see if it'll get better but it's basically just cheap cigarette smoke coming out. It was very disappointing. On top of it all, the server looked like she didn't know how to set up the hookah. We addressed the issue to  Christin (server) but she said we'll have to buy another bowl. We just asked to change the charcoal since it's not even producing smoke. We looked around and none of the hookahs were working. Food seems to be ok but honestly, it was my first time trying this place and will never go back again. I came in looking for good quality hookah but all I got was disappointment.

It gets points for convenience since I'm a grad student at UNLV and it's easy to get to and eat in under an hour for lunch.  I should say that I've never been for dinner, but I don't think that there's any change in menu items.

In my opinion, the Saganaki might be the best thing on the menu, because who doesn't like hot, melting cheese?  I've also had the combination platter, the baked Kibbe, the fesenjan, the moussaka and the pastitsio.  For the most part all are tasty, and usually done correctly, but I've never had that *wow* factor that would have me rank this place higher.  I will say this though, their food does tend to be on the salty side, so be prepared to drink plenty of liquids for the rest of the day.


The service is also usually pretty good, but sometimes I think it might depend on the server.  Overall, a perfectly decent place that I'm content with going back to time and again.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,0,0,3,belbkWh5Pa__A4Tnh7vASA

Happy hour is great, too! The only downside is happy hour is served in the hookah lounge, and I don't smoke hookah. However, as long as people aren't waiting for a hookah spot, you are allowed to sit in the lounge and enjoy the happy hour experience of half-priced drinks and reduced appetizer prices.

Our current visit this time around was Very Disappointing to say the least. As stated, we were there around lunch time, less than 1/2 the tables in the place had patrons. We knew exactly what we wanted, same and only choice we ever get here: The combination platter & the Broiled Moroccan Lamb.

Tammy, our server (or should I say one of three servers we had) seemed nice enough, but unfortunately thats where it ended. If your going to take someone's order that has a few particular requests (i.e. crispy athens fries, xtra sauce, etc.) and not write it down, no problem, your awesome, but when the food does come, and wasnt to order, and it was like talking to wall, then yea, im a little peev'd. 

The grapeleaves have been and will always continue to be, a store bought product (I believe wild oats store bran from a jar) and are the worst you could ever want to eat, I mean, if you like mush and all. The rest of the combination platter lacked lemon!!!!! Come on Paymon's, your serving mediterranean food, put some damn lemon on the food, had to ask for a side of lemon, then it was just edible.

Asked for the Lamb cooked medium, came to us ""well done"" No self-respecting person would ever eat Well-Done lamb. Oh by the way, I even question whether it was even lamb or beef, I honestly could not tell, and you lamb lovers know what a distinct taste lamb has, it was very difficult to tell if we were eating lamb or beef, but either way, it was tough as hell, so who cares at that point.

So out of the three or so food servers who were serving us, Not One of them EVER asked us how anything was, not Once, ever, nor did we recieve a thank you for coming in from our server Tammy.

Here's a tip (because you know this was the only one you recieved from me) if your going to work in customer service, you better have a clue (or get one fast) what it is you are doing, it does go a long way.

I know I couldnt do this type of service, too many a$$holes to deal with, but some people can do it, and they love it, I applaud you, otherwise, please, find another occupation.

I did bring our experience this trip up with the manager very politely, there is no need to be rude or mean, just pointed out all the shortcomings of this trip, and stated that there are too many other business competing for business, and customer service (you know, the good kind) goes along way in my book.

Needless to say, wont be going back to Paymon's Las vegas anytime soon, will seek out other mediterranean establishments till we find a good one again

The part that really set me off was the service we received. We tipped well, but we were treated poorly for no reason at all. We came here to kill some time before an appointment we had, and at the end when we were all finished I was asked if we needed anything else, and I mentioned just the check. We ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes after that to receive the check, with our waiter no where to be found.

I got up, and walked around looking for the waiter, with no luck. I looked through the window in the door, and had seen one of the waiters doing their nails in the back (with the same color hair and type), but I wasn't exactly sure it was her because I didn't think our waiter would be that rude.

Sure enough when our waiter came out about 10 minutes after that, her nails were shiny freshly done, and that's when I knew it was her.

We have by far the worst bartender imaginable named Valerie. She is horrific. She constantly complains while she is working, she tries to overcharge customer, she does not know which drinks she is making more often than not. She is god awful.

Do not let her deter you from coming here. Everyone else works their ass off and will give you phenomenal service. However, she is truly the worst. I cannot wait until they find a replacement and I doubt she will be here much longer. 

I love Paymons and I will always come here whenever I am in town, but I cannot wait to order a Maccallan 18 and cheers to when she is fired.

I've been to a few hookah places before, and it can be dirty, overpriced, hokey, or just off. The decor inside is warm and welcoming. It has beautiful gold Moroccan style lamps overhead and an eclectic mix of furniture and stools next to the booths. It reminded me of  place i'd see in NYC, kind of boho-chic-eclectic. It was dark and welcoming. My friend ordered the iced hookah and I believe we had the jasmine-mint. The waitress was attentive and came around with the different flavors in these little intricate silver boxes, and the hookah was awesome. We came during happy hour, so it was cheaper and oh so relaxing. I'd recommend it if you just want to relax and let go and simmer down from the day.

I ordered the ""koobideh"" since they named it the Persian way and expected it to be a Persian kabob plate. What I received was a ""non cooked at all"" Arabic kabob. I wish it looked as good as some Arabic kabobs! It clearly had no resemblance to Persian kabobs and was so pink I got sick looking at it.  As I'm pregnant I had to send the food back to cook my kabobs longer. Our server could not be found for 10 minutes so my husband went to their kitchen to find someone and we were told they will remake mine and send it back. I waited for 25 minutes while our family ate their mediocre food. We received the bill and I asked the server to either cancel my food or pack it to go. She had no idea where my food was or anything. She brought a food back with her and gave it to me with no bag or silverware. We asked them to call a cab for us and she said: please wait outside for your cab. This is in Las Vegas! In the heat!

Food-wise, I've only ever had their chicken dishes (kabobs and the like) and I thought the meat was well seasoned, moist and tender. The rice is always a little bland; I find myself making vigorous use of the salt and pepper shakers.

We've been looking for a good, unique place to eat after hours - someplace that doesn't serve the usual pub food - and I think we've found it with Paymons.

We were seated in the atrium, which was nice because we could enjoy the music from their Hookah Lounge next door without dealing with all of the ""riff raff"".  Fair warning - it is a club / lounge atmosphere.  

We started with hummus and pita bread, at $5.95.  The chicken pesto panini ($9.95) was excellent, and as always the Athens Fries are so good that we get one order per person, because no one wants to share.  

The Gyro (around $11.95) was also delicious, though it had (in our opinion) way too many onions.  

Service was good, not great.  Our server was attentive, but not proactive.  We asked, she did ... but she didn't think ahead (""oh, they're out of bread.  I'll bring some more"").

1468720,2009-12-14,0,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"It pains me to give Paymon's three stars, because the food deserves 5-stars. This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants ever, anywhere. The people are great and the food is wonderful to almost every sense... beautiful, aromatic, and not that expensive!

They recently added italian food and surprisingly it is very good. Generally, jack of all trades = master of none, but apparently this wasn't far enough a stretch for them. 

The reason they got 4 stars instead of five is for two reasons... one is that they used to have a fantastic ""best in the world"" falafel recipe. It was the best in any city I've visited. Unfortunately, they CHANGED IT. The falafel is now bland and pseudo-tasteless. You eat it for the sake of eating it and not for the sensory experience it was before.

Second, they have some ridiculous policies... for example, they do not accept take out orders after 8:00pm even though they are open until 1am. I assume this is because they are trying to mitigate ""friendly fraud"" ordering, but if you're a regular customer and you're willing to hand over your credit card, THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.

Third, one night I called and asked what time they closed. They said they were open until 1am. I drove 1/2 way across town to get there only to have some newbie tell me that they don't accept orders after 12:15... (would have been excellent information before I drove over!)

Anyway, with the exception of the falafel they have now, it is a delight! Still one of my favorite places. I only wish I could give it 5 stars.

UPDATE 2.19.2010: I continue to dine here and the food continues to be excellent. Had a wonderful amazing server the other night. I wish I had gotten her name because she deserves mention here. This makes up for this older blonde lady server who works nights and is unattentive and rude to the point you want to punch her in the face. The falafel is still severely lacking compared to the fantastic recipe they used to have. I was wrong before when I said it was now pseudo-tasteless, because it is not pseudo, it is full-on tasteless (LOL). Also, I should mention that their hummus and kabobs are excellent.",43mw4n9eZA5o8_hiwZIulQ,1,0,4,MKK2mftkLiyXnHk25spZ1A

Anywho, I'm knocking it down a couple of stars because of the last time Matt & I dined here. 

Got seated quickly inside, and made our orders after getting our drinks. I got the bowl of lentil soup sans cheese and a falafel pita with hummus and fries. Matt got the unlimited pasta bowl, and his first round was bowtie pesto. 

Service was alright although our waitress was a total ninja and disappeared a lot so if we actually did need things it would have been very difficult to find her. 

My food was very good, although I think that the soup is a bit overpriced but still very yummy. I'm not a fan of their hummus at all but when it's wrapped inside the pita it's good, and the fries are always bits of pure heaven. Matt however, wasn't a fan of his pasta and had half of the big bowl left. He still wanted a second bowl of something different, and asked if I could take the rest of the pesto home as leftovers since he didn't like it. The waitress said due to policy they can't box up the first round of pasta. 

Okay, I would understand if Matt didn't completely finish his second bowl and kept asking for to-go boxes, but come on. I can't believe that they just wasted all of that food that I would have gladly ate for lunch the next day. They need to change the policy that you can only take home one portion or something. That policy just totally puts me off from coming back as soon as I usually do. 

Overall the experience was alright but wasting that food is upsetting. I guess from now on we won't be so adventurous with our first bowl. The food is always good usually though and the service is alright (although I can tell you a funny story about a waitress who kept blindly spilling water on my friend throughout the night - too hilarious) but I don't think I'll be back for awhile.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,4,2,3,1GsjVJ6FdD-msgqupyMOsQ

However, the food is not always great. Last night, I got two falafel pita sandwiches to go and they were very dry. My husband and I LOVE falafel sandwiches and we always get them at Greek restaurants. I am not sure if they fried the falafels twice or if the falafels were just not fresh, but it was hard to eat the sandwiches. In addition, they were very stingy with the lettuce and tomatoes in the sandwiches, which could have helped a little bit with the dryness. Also, they over-package everything. They wrap the pita sandwich with foil, then they put the wrapped sandwich in a paper baggie, then they put the baggie in a Styrofoam to-go box and last, they put the box in a bag, 4 different things to get a sandwich to-go. A bit wasteful in my opinion. They do something similar with their fries. They put them in a paper bag and the bag in a box. They also give you way too many to-go sauces, which they usually also put inside of another to-go box.

1811534,2012-09-07,0,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"What we ordered (ranked from best to worst):

Athens fries - These were really tasty.  They come with the Paymon's special seasoning (more about that in a second) and a dipping sauce that tastes a little bit like thousand island but not as relish-y.  I usually only really like shoestring fries, but even though these were medium cut, they were so crispy that I still gobbled them down.  The seasoning is SO GOOD - it has like ten thousand ingredients and tastes a little bit like old bay but without the background shrimp-y flavor.  If for no other reason, you should try this place just to try that seasoning.  You can buy it there and bring it home with you too, to sprinkle into your mouth at your leisure.

Hummus and baba ganoush (sp?) - they have a comp dip plate for 6 bucks, and we chose the hummus and the baba. It comes with a side of pita.  The hummus was okay (not bad but nothing special), but the baba was really good.  

Grilled salmon mediterannean platter - I'm not sure if this is what it was called, but this was pretty much just grilled salmon (really tender and not overcooked), with this ""vermicelli pilaf"" thing which was pretty much seasoned yellow rice, and a side salad.  The salad had lots of cheese on it, so if you don't like cheese be careful.  

Combo kabob platter - 3 kabobs - lamb, beef, and chicken, + the vermicelli pilaf (see above), and some sort of rice pilaf + side salad.  The rice pilaf was really good - it's a mix between white and yellow basmati rice.  The lamb kabob was SO GOOD - the lamb tasted like the gyro lamb meat that you get at the good halal carts in new york.  The beef was okay, though a bit chewy, and chicken was pretty tender.  

Tiramisu - We actually didn't order this, but the waitress gave it to us for free since she felt bad about having us wait so long for the check.  The tiramisu is homemade, and has a bit more rum flavor than most of your average tiramisus, and is pretty good.  I think the baklava is also supposed to be really good, although we didn't try it.

The main thing about this place (besides the magical spice seasoning) is that the portions are GIGANTIC.  I think one of those platters could easily feed two people with big appetites, no joke.  Given the portion sizes, I think the prices are pretty decent.  Also, they have one of those cool dessert trays (like the ones you see at steak houses) that they bring around so you can see all the desserts on offer.  And our waitress was really nice.

The cafe side was closed, so we went through the lounge area to the left of the cafe. It was darker? inside than it was outside so upon entering, I had to give my tired eyes a moment to adjust. A door to the left led to a hookah bar. No one was there to greet us so we grabbed a table in the dining room and waited. A server came in from the back to hand us menus and water. 

The menu had a lot of vegetarian options, which included three or four pita sandwiches, but I decided to go the deconstructed route and got the vegetarian platter. It came with hummus, baba ganoush, tzatziki, stuffed grape leaves, tabouli, four falafel balls, and a generous serving of seasoned fries. Additionally, there were three dipping sauces and warm pita bread. Everything tasted fine until I got to one of the dipping sauces. There was an odd, sharp flavor to it and took two tries before realizing something had spoiled. I didn't bother to ask for a replacement because I figured they would give me another scoop from the bad batch.

Service was good. I had to request a water refill, but after that our server came by frequently to top us off. It was so dark inside, I'm sure it was difficult for him to spot an empty glass.",92QbGGM9PAyqtW_WVlehiw,14,9,4,rBLlWoVOMvTaUf3qTIjGBA

We didn't quite know what they meant by ""atrium"", but we're adventurous, so that's what we chose. It's a dining area that looks like it was between 2 buildings and they enclosed it overhead with glass. There was a door to the kitchen and a door to the hookah lounge which was the building ""next door"". The decor is kind of dated looking, but what pleased me so much was I got to enjoy the feeling of dining al fresco without melting in the heat!

We ordered the flaming saganaki, a very salty super oily delish cheese that is lit on fire to crust the top. It was very good and I felt like there was enough of the warm pita slices served with it. Sometimes I feel places skimp. We also ordered Athens fries. They were super seasoned and I wish I had more room in my tummy to stuff them all in! Loved them! My husband and I both ordered the gyros. The meat was perfectly seasoned, the tomato and onion were very fresh and crisp, and I thought the tzatziki was perfectly tangy and plentiful. They make their pitas every day. The gyro was HUGE! And I stuffed myself. I'm talking sauce all over my face and contented noises coming out of me!

The kicker for me was we told the server where we were from and compared our fav Greek place in Denver to Paymon's, which proved to be much better. After a pleasant quick conversation he went for our check and came out with 2 slices of baklava, packaged to go (no styrofoam!), on the house. While my husband doesn't like baklava, both of us were charmed. I love places that know how to create loyal patrons who spread the word!!!!

The night started out brightly, as we ran into Ahmad, a former student of mine...full of personality. The waitress took our order as we chatted with him (2 gyros and an order of Athens fries). Our friend eventually clocked out, and we waited, and waited, and waited. Another couple came in (we were the only 4 people in our section), got their apps, and then their food. We finally got our waitress's attention, and asked, ""what about ours?"" She asked if our server knew we hadn't gotten it yet, so we let her know (again) that she was our server. She was dumbfounded and had completely forgotten about us, even though she passed us several times on her way to the table who got all of their food before us, despite coming in at least 30 minutes after us. We did get our food for free (almost an hour after coming in, so we took it to go), but this shouldn't happen in a busy restaurant, much less an almost empty one.

2017214,2015-01-08,0,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"Summary: The hookah lounge is of good quality. the café itself is spacious and accomodating, but given the pricing, the service and food itself, with a few exceptions, leave a bit of room for improvement. 

I am going to separate the hookah lounge and café in my review:

Lounge:
I haven't smoked at their lounge in a while but from what I understand, it's pretty much the same as when I used to come here weekly.
Product: I am unsure what shisha brand(s) they use, however, I remember it being on par with their competitors. They do have a good selection of flavors and they do a good job of mixing them. 
Service: The staff is usually prompt and friendly. They're good about checking back on you.
Cost: The price of their hookahs are pretty much in line with the industry standard. However, the happy hour deals are awesome. Having a beer/drink, as well as awesome appetizers, make the hookah experience much more enjoyable.
Lounge itself: The hookah lounge has a really relaxing darkly-lit, well-decorated environment. Seating is comfortable and can easily accommodate groups of varying size. 

Café:
Food: I have been heard plenty of times, since long-before I discovered Yelp, and I have to say, aside from a few exceptions, I haven't really ever been impressed with their food. They do carry a decent selection focusing on cuisine from Italian, Greek, Persian, Indian and general Mediterranean. Unfortunately, as with many restaurants: over-reaching diversity usually means that quality gets sacrificed (looking at you Cheesecake Factory).  I've tried all type of food there, except Italian since I refuse to eat Italian when out, and haven't found any stand out dishes. It's not horrible, I should be clear, but it's not dynamic. 

I will say, however, their appetizers are usually awesome, which is what getting appetizers in the hookah lounge is so enjoyable. This goes double for Athens Fries and, admittedly, I have taken several trips to this restaurant JUST to get these fries. Also, their Arabic and Turkish coffee are pretty good. 

Service: As with the food, I have never been impressed with their service. I wouldn't say I have encountered anybody rude but service tends to get mechanical: there's a bare minimum of personality/conversation and I haven't really seen any service instance that made me feel like we were building report versus them just providing a service. (Imagine getting served food by the Geek Squad at Best Buy). 

Cost: They do offer some interesting deals like all-you-can-eat pasta, however, there dishes are slightly pricey for what you actually get. 

Cafe itself: the cafe is pretty spacious and comfortable. I have yet to see a large party there personally, however, I can imagine they would easily accommodate.",AolnyiEB_UMlQtD_dp5E9g,0,0,3,KBhwkhHwUXSUfqOC816ETQ

My brother and I made the mistake of referring to GPS, rather than Yelp. We had lunch on a Friday afternoon. I liked the aesthetics, but SERVICE was POOR. The food reflected the poor service. I ordered the lamb kabobs for $16 not including t/t. The lamb was dry and rough. The dish had an Italian twist, which really took the authentic flavor out of the food. 

Service was the worst I have encountered in quite some time. There were about three small parties while I ate there, and about 5 servers. WTF were they doing? Certainly not checking to see whether the meal was ok, nor refilling drinks. I had to walk the bill up to a server that gave me attitude.  Also, there was an annoying teen (possibly owner's daughter) running about. 

Suggestions to the owner- Close shop or offer decent prices (happy hour), take the Italian out of the Mediterranean equation, rehire new staff (David K was our server- nice, but just delivered food), eliminate dishes that are not popular, and offer complimentary Hummus and Pita.

I've been coming to Paymon's since I moved to Las Vegas in 2003. The food has always been awesome - from my meat eating days when I used to order the chicken pita to my more recent vegetarian leaning days.  My current favorite thing on the menu is a big bowl of lentil soup served with a few slices of pita on the side.  Comforting and flavorful - and a perfect size for lunch - which is when I usually end up here.  If you're in the mood for something a bit more substantial, the felafel or felamus (felafel and hummus) pitas and fatosh salad are great veg choices too.  The spiced fries are good - I rarely order my own, but I've been known to poach a few off of my husband's plate every now and then.

The hookah I prepare or smoke at places like the Olive can last 1-2 hours. A refill to  Paymon's is when your charcoal runs out, NOT your shisha. So, if your coals are burning out, they will charge you for an entire refill even though your shisha is still burning fresh. This is the only hookah place that I know that charges you for a refill just because your coals run out. I've experienced this everytime I come here. Two of those times, the hookahs weren't prepared properly and were at fault to the person that prepared them and the waitress still insisted on charging me for a refill. Um, no thanks.

2474034,2014-03-23,1,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"My last meal in Vegas on my winter vacation was a bit of a last minute selection. My friend picked me up downtown and we had plenty of time for dinner before I caught my flight back to the DMV. He suggested Italian, and took us to a nice local place with the word ""Amore"" in its name. One problem - we forgot it was Valentine's Day. After opening the door to a huge crowd and a room full of heart-shaped balloons, we immediately turned around and discussed plan B. We joked that we were each other's Valentine's date, and then he asked me ""Do you like Greek?""

Off we went to Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe. The large restaurant is cutely decorated and, like most Greek restaurants I've been to, they pack the tables a bit tightly. The front of the restaurant features an array of spices and blends that are related to the Paymon's franchise and are used in the restaurant. Despite the ""holiday"" crowd, we were able to walk in and grab a seat.

My friend insisted that we start with an order of their Athens Fries. It's basically just seasoned fries with a sauce - a bit boring I thought, but I trust his judgement. And WOW, I can see why these are called ""award winning"" fries ... their house seasoning makes them the best seasoned fries I've ever had, and the house dipping sauce was a nice accompaniment.

For dinner, I ordered the Moussaka. I get it at just about every Greek restaurant I go to, and use it as a ""litmus test"" of their food. This was right up there with the best I have ever had. Beautifully layered, and the béchamel sauce was outstanding. My friend ordered the Gyros Platter and it was so massive, and looked so tasty, that I almost had buyer's remorse. Almost.

The meal was a nice cap to my vacaton, and I'd be happy to make a return trip on any future trip to Las Vegas.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,2,2,5,TwFJgaJQIq3VP8xPUIAk2A

The lentil soup... hands down the best I have had!!! Can't even begin to tell you how sad it is I can't take a gallon back with me to Louisville. 
My husband ordered the Kibbeh platter and vegetarian grape leaves. He loved every single bite!!! The grape leaves seemed to be hand rolled and not the typical canned version. The kibbeh was extremely flavorful and perfectly cooked. It went extremely well with the fluffy basmati rice. 
I had a falafel pita which was so delicious and flavorful. Most can become dry but these were extremely moist on the inside. I chose a side of fries with my pita and the portion size was HUGE!!! I didn't care for the sauce given with the fries so I dipped them in a side of Tazikki which tamed the overwhelming amount of seasoning put on them.

2540239,2012-02-25,0,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"I am only rating this place as a hookah bar. Coming from Los Angeles, where hookah bars are a dime a dozen, I would have expected something on par in the City of Sin. I understand that the primary business of this place is a restaurant so again, I must reiterate, this review is for the hookah lounge of Paymon's cafe only.

The service is ok. My friend and I were greeted at the front desk. However we were directed to go towards to two other doors before we can even reach the hookah lounge. It would have been fine if we were escorted, but we had to find our way to the other side of the restaurant to reach the actual hookah bar. Once we actually got to sit, we were greeted by a woman who carried flavors of hookah and asked us what we wanted. I notice that the tobacco that they used are not of the best quality. Most of it are dried and some of it were mislabeled. As someone who has been smoking hookah for several years and have been to several Nargile bars all over the Middle East, I know what to look for. Our server was very attentive and we got our drinks and appetizers right away.

Our hookah came minutes later. First of all, I am not sure if their staff knows how a hookah works. The rubber seal on our pipe was so loose that air was escaping, thus not getting the air necessary to get a full smoke out of the pipe. I knew this, but I am not sure if their hookah preparer knew this. He kept messing with our hookah till I finally told him why it wasn't working. I told him very tactfully what needed to be done and he was able replace our hookah eventually. I also notice that they use the cheap Chinese made ones, not the good kind (Egyptian, Syrian, Persian, etc) but I am sure its for cost efficiency. The worst part of this place and thus why I am only giving it 2 Stars is the simple fact that THEY DON'T REFILL CHARCOALS. Charcoal service should be standard in all hookah bars. If I've had my charcoal changed every 15 minutes at a Hookah bar in downtown Bagdhad, why not in Las Vegas? Are they too cheap to have this service? All the hookah guy can do is adjust the air valve, which btw does not do anything to the charcoal. The charcoal will keep burning till its completely turned to ashes. 

If you're in Vegas visiting or a local, I DO NOT recommend this place at all. I gave it two stars because of the service and that is it.",Mq91E7cjFQH53cngWCdLQQ,0,0,2,XR1fZZIyMXUhUZCACvesZg

I think it's just because it's turned into a bit of a comfort food place for the mildly discerning local.

I've tried almost the entire menu here and I've found that the things I like the most are those that are probably tried the least.  For those that forget that Italy is considered a Mediterranean country, don't shy away from their chicken marsala.  It's surprisingly good, even if the penne marinara served with it isn't the most harmonious of pairings.  The chicken fesenjan is tangy and refreshingly different, and the pastitsio (kind of a middle-eastern lasagna) is hearty, filling, and perfect for a rainy day.  Their Athens fries really are tasty and make up for the often disappointing hummus and questionable falafel.

The ambiance of this place makes up for its culinary shortcomings.  Sit in the courtyard if you can, it's a completely different experience than the dining room.  The fountain, which would seem gaudy in its size other places, fits in well among the couches, pillows, rich fabrics and stained glass windows of the Hookah Lounge.

Lets make it clear this is resraurant owned by a Persian guy and yet he does not know how to make his own food, how the hell are you going to maintain the rest of the stuff that are none Persian.

A) I waited 25 minutes for my food with nothing on my table!!! When you eat Persian food as soon as you get in they will need to bring you warm bread with butter with mixed vegtables and onion this is a must at the table. After getting deinks Then the server needs to ask you if you would need any salad, yougurt mix (cucumber or shallot) and then get your order. Kind of like how they bring you tortilla chips at Mexican food before you wait for your food.

After a long wait and my moms complain to Anthony the food came, I dont know what word to use but it was garbage and I mean litterly garbage. Tasteless, spiceless crab with premium pricing.My sister only ate the salad from her koobideb friends order was supposet to have white rice but it came with a garbage brownish mixed rice so they brought him another plate of white rice also servers learn your job chicken is always served with lemon on the plateand make sure it is not burned. My trio had dried, seasonless koobideh with burned chicken along with half cooked koobideh.

And the combination plate was another disaster, flavorless tastless stuff. We didnt eat a good portion of the food my mom said its not nice to be wastefull so she brought the food back for our little dog coco and guess what even coco did not eat the food she only ate the meats lol.

I found this place by doing a google search and they had two locations so I figured it must be good, oh boy I was mistaken.

2703862,2010-12-04,1,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"Paymon's. I've been here enough to write this review with no compunctions or second guessing. 

Starting with the restaurant.. The food is all pretty decent, but none of it seems to be particularly well-executed. And then the bill comes. Now, it's not like this place is super-expensive or anything like that. But it's not cheap, and in the end, I'm never happy with what I've paid for.

Now, the hookah lounge is a bit of a different story. It's marginally comfortable (at best), the service is usually super-friendly, and the hookahs vary wildly in quality. Hookahs only last an hour, and that's if you're lucky, since they don't replace coals. And the cost is about $15. Most other establishments will get you about 2x as much smoking time for the same money. The big redemption is daily happy-hour. 5-7pm, including weekends, gets you half-priced hookahs and a bunch of appetizer and drink specials too.  At half-price, everything is instantly reasonable and worthwhile. Drinks, appetizers, hookahs, etc. Also, while it's not a very comfortable place to lounge and smoke, the decor and atmosphere is usually pretty decent.

I rarely come here to eat anymore, and hardly ever show up outside of happy hour. Everything, from the decor to the food, is just ""pretty good,"" which to me is not enough for what they charge. But happy hour in the hookah lounge definitely makes the place worthwhile. 

PRO-TIP: No hats allowed in the hookah lounge. Take yours off first so you won't look like an idiot.",21KWy-JENq6xVEly5xki0A,2,2,3,pSWJYUt5cZZt4QGGPpUpKQ

For a Saturday night it was not too busy.  I remember this place having long waits for service and a hip young crowd.  I guess things have changed slightly with new management.  Despite all that it was an overall good experience. The service was prompt and attentive.  The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant and comfortable.  

I went with the steak kabob which was serve with grilled vegetables like onions, peppers, zucchini and served with a side of rice and Greek salad.  This dish was very fresh tasting and the ingredients were good quality.  My better half had the Falamus pita which has always been my favorite.  This is a falafel pita with hummus, lettuce and tomatoes.  You must get the Athenian fries for any meal.  They are seasoned so delicious and also come with this amazing dipping sauce that will have you licking your fingers for more.

A coworker and I just dined for lunch and we split a Greek salad which was abundant with fresh veggies, feta, and kalamata, tossed with a tangy lemon dressing. We split the combo platter, which came with tabbouleh, hummus, baba ganoush, tahini dressing, falafel, dolmas, seasoned fries, and pita. It was plenty of food for the two of us, and the falafel was perfectly crunchy and crispy on the outside but steaming and moist on the inside.

In the restaurant portion, our group was pretty large and the service wasn't great. Everyone was nice, but the servers weren't able to answer simple questions about the menu items. We were told that the menu had recently changed, and they were still getting used to it. Not sure if I accept that reasoning, since it had been a week since it was changed. They also didn't seem to have enough people to handle the bar and the restaurant. Service was a bit slow, and seemed a little chaotic. Once again, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since our group was 20+ people. The Athens Fries and Garlic Fries were very good. The Kabob Trio was ok, but not nearly the best I've had. All of the kabobs were a little too dry for my taste. 

A few of us stayed to check out the hookah lounge area. It's a bit of a small lounge, but kind of cozy. I could imagine it getting cramped during a busy evening. The employees in the lounge were nice and checked on us. I ordered an Old Fashioned but it tasted nothing like an Old Fashioned. It tasted like soda water with a splash of whiskey. The Skittles flavor of hookah was pretty outstanding! I also liked that the music wasn't loud. So many places in Vegas play music on high volume, and it prevents any sort of conversation.

I think my experience would have been better if I came with just a few people. At the same time, there are so many other places that are so much better.

However, he eventually got us seated, and our server, Anthony, made sure to make up for any misgivings I had. My wife ordered the combination platter, and I ordered the Gyros platter. The portions were HUGE - I normally don't have leftovers to take home. I liked it at first, but, the more I ate, the more the salt content got to me. By about halfway through the meal, I got an idea of the sodium intake of your average bukkake star. My wife assures me that it was perfectly normal for Greek food, so I'll chalk that up to my inexperience with going Greek. The vegetables served alongside, though, were magical. I greatly enjoyed those - giving me half the rice and twice the veggies would not have been a bad idea. 

She liked almost everything on her plate except the dolmas - they were extremely bitter (even for grape leaves), and the consistency was like pudding, rather than rice. Other than that, though, she loved it, and was very happy with it.  She also truly enjoyed the lentil soup she ordered.

Another for the great hostess who explained to us how the sealed bowl worked (and extended the life of our lovely triple apple).

Finally, a star for the Persian? Lebanese? art on the walls...great to gaze at during lulls in the conversation.

I can't give them a fifth star because EVERY time I'm there, they are playing crappy music way too loud for the intimate, exotic venue.  90's R&B is a triple apple buzzkill.  How about some goa trance?",IQTzpSyZphASEnQS2I0Ckw,1,1,4,Jq7wWa00b_bspYp5gdBDmA

Excellent service for a neighborhood restaurant - have been coming here for years and many of the wait staff have been here for years, and they have great attitudes.

Hookah lounge next door is fun too - if you are into cocktails and hookahs.

Our server Cynthia, (we actually had 3 different people tending to us, but this one in particular was the one servicing our hookah) addressed our table as normal and began conversation by telling us she hopes she gets over this sickness soon, a throat infection no-less. Fine, that's our prerogative if we wanted to smoke after that. But not wanting to make her feel bad, we chose to do so anyway. 

We came in only for happy hour (5-7) for the prices. We ordered one of our hookahs 45 minutes before the end of happy hour and it did not come out until 5 minutes before happy hour was over. We could have smoked and ordered another bowl in that time. Cynthia apologized and said there was a mix up with one of tables, that was the reason for the delay. So, when we finished that hookah, I asked Cynthia if she could put this next order as happy hour pice being as their in up prevented us from doing so. She said she'd need to run it by her manager. So she did, came back, and said that was fine. 

When our bill came, it was not at happy hour price... we waited another 20 minutes for someone to come by so I could address this, and no one ever came. I went up to the bar to speak with Cynthia, or anyone really, and when she saw me come up to the bar, she quickly went off to the back. So I ended up speaking with another girl and she said the manager discounted $4 (not happy hour priced) at this point we were just tired and defeated and ended up paying for it. But I'm leaving this review here for others to please be cautious of Cynthia...

I ended up here because Stephano's my go to Greek restaurant was closed. The atmosphere at Paymon's is so dark and dungeon like. I looked over the menu and saw that in addition to having standard Greek fare they also had Indian and Italian food which made me question the authenticity of the food. 

I started with a regular hummus and for my entree I chose the gyros plate. The hummus was slightly bitter but had a smooth consistency. I could tell the pita bread was low quality and store bought because it tasted like cardboard and had a spongey texture. This was the most unauthentic pita bread I have ever had at a Greek restaurant. 

The gyros plate looked sloppy and did not taste freshly made. Later on, I found out from the manager that the gyros comes frozen. I was not at all surprised because the texture and taste reflected meat that has been previously frozen. 

I hope the owners look into improving the quality of their gyros and either make it in house or find a local supplier because anyone that has had authentic/high quality Greek food will not want to eat here.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,6,2,2,HFu-C-FvJZWWevn4WLxdaA

The tables are a tad on the small side, the only reason being because we ordered a ton of food and had trouble keeping our drinks and plates somewhere stable. 

The food was great! I had the Athens fries (good), calamari (good), and babaganoush (my favorite!). We also had a side of chicken tenders but I think those were of the frozen variety. Very pleased with the food overall. Beers were reasonably priced. 

Service was great too. Our server came to check on us regularly, and the hookah guy (sorry dude forgot your name!) was super awesome. He mentioned he only works saturday nights I believe? Anyways, he was super friendly while we chatted with him.

Its out there, and people talk about it; but when it comes down to it... Its only ever kinda good, or good for the price, or the atmosphere but never have I heard, or said, ""Outstanding.""

Outstanding is barely appropriate for my first experience here. Interestingly enough, I searched ""Delivery"" on Yelp, and this Paymons came up high on the list... Strange, because they don't deliver. Which is fine, i like living in Las Vegas and being able to drive around our beautiful city; driving down Maryland Pkwy at 30mph is excrutiating, but worth it when you get here. Its neatly kept in a non descript mini mall across from Target and Buffalo Exchange.

The food was beyond excellent. There was an interesting sauce that came as default chicken sauce that just made me... I dunno, not my cup of hummus. But the white tzaziki is incredible. Great consistency and not watery or over cucumbery. The chicken is tender and marinated all the way through. The kabob (kubideh) is meaty and well seasoned. My only gripe is if you get it in pocketed form, its all meat on top and salad underneath. Im going to try wrap form next time.

The Athens Fries are beyond phenomenal. The only fries in the entire world that I gladly munched on cold. I was floored and full and satisfied for under 30 bucks and didnt even touch the Greek Salad yet. The best takeout experience I've had in Las Vegas across any genre of food.

The food was great. We had the Athens Fries, and Dolma appetizers. My friends also had the mozz sticks and said they were good. I was totally impressed by the Dolma dish. Tender grape leaves stuffed with angus ground beef, tomatoes and rice in a tangy tomato sauce. I've been craving them ever since! The fries are delicious too. Coated in some kind of seasoning with a side of this creamy aoli sauce. That sauce you could put on tree bark and I would be good. Great happy hour deals 50% off all appetizers and signature drinks. The Lychee Martini was pretty good as well.
The hookah flavors were great as well. We tried Blueberry Vanilla with a touch of cinnamon... Tastes like French toast so amazing! Ill be coming back specifically for that. 
Now into the bad... Unfortunately this completely out weighed the good. First, I say down I'm the hookah lounge part for about 25 minutes with no menu, and no recognition at all. I finally went up to the bar where the waitress was and asked if she could stop by. She held up her finger and said one minute in a very snappy tone. Mind you the lounge was not that busy at this time. I sat back down and about 15 minutes she came over after I waved my hand at her. I ordered a glass of wine & asked if it was on happy hour, she said yes. The rest of my party arrived a few minutes later & we all sat there for about 30 minutes with no service. And still no wine for me. One of my friends approached the bartender to order the rest of our drinks and he said they would be brought out to us. After waiting 20 minutes and seeing our drinks just sitting there on the bar I got up and brought them over. When I was at the bar retrieving them I told our waitress we would like to order. She got out a pen & paper and said what would you like? I was t sure of the exact order everyone wanted so she told me to go ask them and she would be at the computer when I was prepared to order. Now in all the years of experience of dining out or working in restaurants in general I was blown away by this. She actually wanted me to go get the order of our table and walk back to the bar to order. While taking my drinks as well. Wow, not cool bro.
The hookah chic was no help either. She kept forgetting the flavors and had to ask us several time what we ordered. And to top it off I had 6 glasses of wine over the period of our 4 hour dinner and when we got the bill not one glass was offered at happy hour. When I asked about this, this was her response ""oh I didn't ring up any of your wine until the end and it's 10pm now."" 
 Such a disastrous experience. If the food  wasn't so amazing I'd never return but since it is ill give Paymons one more shot. But if I receive service like this again my next review won't be as nice. Get it together people!",z8wN6EQuw_JF-zTjcNgsLw,10,6,2,Lm7Zkw6PhuC20qVqHIcyVw

Honestly, I could give a five star rating just for the Athens fries alone (as one reviewer noted, these are the real deal, and they sure as hell are). Hell I'd go out of my way to stop in here just for these. That being said, pretty much everything in here is five-star all the way.  We've been here 3-4 and we just can't get enough of the place. You can order pretty much anything on the menu - kebabs, curries, gyros, and you will not be disappointed. The hummus sampler is amazing too (get some baba ganoush as well).

My favorite is their fries! I love just coming and hanging out with friends after a long day for some fries and beers. It's seasoned perfectly and delicious and definitely something I get every time I go to either Paymon's locations.

Another item I got was their fried calamari, which was surprisingly pretty good as well. It was seasoned perfectly the couple of times I got them, but it's just your average calamari.

The broiled ground beef kabob is delicious, it just left my mouth watering for more and I would always try to eat it all in one sitting, but end up taking some of it home for a snack later which still tastes amazing! It's never overly cooked and always seasoned well and has a savory taste to it. 

A safe choice always is their gyro platter or sandwich, it's just a typical gyro and isn't too special, but if you're unsure what you want it's always a good back up plan!

When they have the all you can eat pasta, it's a always a great deal especially when you're with friends and are unsure what to eat for dinner that night. You might as well! 

Overall it's one of my favorite places for mediterranean and one of the top contenders for best in town. I haven't been to another place that's as good as they are yet, but I'm looking!",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,1,0,4,9CtogRSsxeKTubvRczefMg

Colors of turqouise blue amidst magenta and purplish color tones of the upholstered chairs, the curtains and the painted walls. Rather cheerful. But our hostess led me and my Mom to another room where it had low-lighting. Mom commented it to be a little dark for her liking. Tables were adorned with electric candlelight. A flowing fountain decorated with cherubs  was in the center next to the exit door. Tables and padded chairs were set up around the room, as well as a few green plants. Hard to tell if they were real live plants or faux. A cozy atmosphere. A painted wall lends an air of romantic mystique. 

Whenever dining in a Meditterranean restaurant like this which serves Persian and Mediterranean cuisine, an order of hot mint tea is my favorite beverage to go along with such cuisine.  Especially that vegetarian food is healthy and favored, for starters the ""Stuffed Grape Leaves"" was delightfully juicy. It's a great vegetarian dish, a version of Greek Dolmas. It's listed on their menu as an Appetizer. Rice and herbs were wrapped in soft grape leaves and served with tzatziki sauce that complements it well. We had the pleasure to dine on the not so obscure ""Chicken and Beef Kabobs"" which was served with rice, and vegetables. The ""Athens Fries"" were delicious in its seasoned rendering which is served with a dipping sauce. Time went by before our meal was served.  The male waitstaff was attentive, friendly and patient.

Adjacent to the room we dined in had a few patrons entering and leaving the ""Hookah Lounge"" room.  It is where ""shisha"" or flavored tobacco from a common nargile (or hookah water pipe) is shared by patrons on a table. We did not enter nor try a ""hookah"". Although it is unlike nicotine smoking, it is one habit I prefer to not even desire to try.

They have posted on the door their ""dress code"" which seemed a bit silly as this is a pretty informal place. It is the basic stuff, no shorts, sandals, tank tops, hats, etc. Well two of our group had hats on and we were told immediately we had to remove them, no problem.

Upon sitting us down and taking our order we noticed not one but two people wearing baseball hats similar to ours. When we asked why we were told because they are girls and the rule is for guys only. After a quick trip to the bathroom I noticed that in fact the sign says only ""no hats"" 

So being a bit of a jerk I asked again why the double standard. I was told the rule is for guys and if we don't like it we can leave. I asked to speak with a manager and they sent over this lovely british or aussie lady that was unnecessarily rude stating that they have had gang problems so no hats for guys. Apparently there are no hookah loving female gang members...

When I pointed out that her sign didn't say only guys can't wear hats she became irate and asked the two hat wearing non-gang member ladies to remove their hats. She then returned and said ""there, now no one is wearing a hat, are you happy?"" I told her I would have been happier if she acted in a professional manner and not like a child. 

Our actual waitress tried her best but the experience was ruined and we will not be back.

I have visited this establishment on three occassion (2x for lunch and 1x for dinner).  In the three times I've visited, I ordered the following:

Gyro - lots and lots of meat.  Although, I wasnt thoroughly impressed with the lettuce and tomato (I like romaine lettuce but it's just a preference thing).

Kabobs - for dinner, this is a lot of food.  The lamb and sirloin were cooked perfectly - tender.  The meal included rice and a salad.

A friend of ours in the group was told he had to change his shirt ( he was wearing a tank top) or leave. When I inquired as to why, the server told me that no tank tops were allowed. I guess he must have missed the lady 2 tables over from us that was wearing a tank top as well. Thankfully, our friend had an extra shirt in his car, but by that point I was already angry about a policy that wasn't posted anywhere, & enforced by an obnoxious server who shouldn't  be in any kind of customer service position. 

Our food took forever, it was far from great, & we kept being pressured about smoking the stupid hookah.

Baklava: Walnut and Pistachio filling - very authentic ingredients. However, it was soggy, and not enough honey.  It was obvious that it had been sitting around for more than a day.

We also got the Athens fries for the first time the last time we went, and they were good...just not as good as they're hyped up to be, I suppose.

We got the Pastitsio for the entree that time, and it was very good and filling. It's sort of like lasagna, but different. We've gotten the gyro platter before, and I think that's always a good choice. Boyfriend likes the baked kibbe, but there's better things on the menu to me.

My friend and I had a veritable feast, sharing a beef/lamb sausage entree with rice, pita and three different dips, Athens fries, and finished the meal up with baklava. We were so stuffed that we had a meal and a snack out of the leftovers later. 

The tzatziki was amazing.  I love any kind of dip, so the hummus and the baba ganoush were welcomed. The baba ganoush was smokey, unlike any I had ever had. I stuffed my face with what seems like several pounds of deliciousness over the next few days. I loved trying different bites of different things--fries, pita, sausage--in the different dips.

Or if you feel like fish, try the Greek salad and add a salmon filet, omg so good. Not sure what secret spices they use on their salmon but man I love it.

After about 2 minutes of having the door directly behind me open and close repeatedly and watching people emerge down the hallway, I had us move to one of the corner tables next to the window- most of the tables next to the window were empty.

We ordered fries, which were okay but not great and cost too much.

I repeatedly had to ask to have out water refilled throughout the meal.  At one point, I had to get up to get their attention.  Again, the restaurant was not busy.

Then, I ordered the eggplant parmesan.  Big mistake- the eggplant was too flat and way too dry.  The spices did not complement the food.  The pasta itself was okay, but the sauce was really watery and again the spices did not work.  And it cost a lot more than it should have considering.

I ate less than half the meal and then took the rest of the meal home with me planning to eat it for lunch the next day.  Then, on second thought, I realized there was no way I was going to be interested in eating the leftover, and I gave the rest away.

Oh, I remember, it's the iced tea.  I drink gallons of it!  And when it's time to leave, I get a fresh to-go cup.  I have been coming here for years (16 to be exact) and my bladder never fails to get maxed out.  Paymon's is one of the few places I can think of that still brews this brand of passion fruit flavored iced tea.

But the pee tea isn't the only reason I come here.  It's also the Athen's fries.  Yup.  I eat fries at a Mediterranean restaurant.  But these ain't your run of the mill fries.  They have a crazy tasty seasoning and a dipping sauce I could pour over everything.  I have tried a lot of the menu items with some hits and misses.  However, I always fall back on my reliable favorites: gyros salad, lebni, hummus and baba ganosh.  And I used to love stealing some of the buttered noodles from the kids...until they stopped leaving leftovers.  

Besides the food (and tea), they open up the hookah lounge at night and are open till late.  I've only been to the lounge about three times, but it's a decent spot.  Reasonably priced drinks along with access to the entire menu can make for a looooong night.  The only downside IMHO is that they use a cheaper hookah tobacco that doesn't last as long, burn as evenly and isn't as strong as the higher-end stuff (Starbuzz, anyone?).  An apple bowl would be a nice option, but they don't even offer it.  And they could be more attentive to the coals, though I guess that's irrelevant since the tobacco doesn't last very long anyway.  Regardless, like I said, it's decent.  And I don't come for the hookah.  I come for the tea.  And I run for the urinal.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,2,2,4,iplNtENFAgjTB_9s-NEZbw

On to the important stuff!  This was my first time, so I got a little confused by the sign near the door I came in and ended up at the hostess stand.  She was kind enough to walk me over to the Hookah Lounge.  Very friendly and not bothered at all my general lack of direction.  

I had two very delicious mojitos.  Our server was apparently doubling as a bartender as well, because I saw her behind the bar.  There were several servers who stopped by to check on us and service was freaking fabulous.  Even better, we were that group with a crap ton of credit cards, and our server took care of it without any issues.  

I tried the Athens fries and Calamari.  I had the fries at Bite of Las Vegas which is why I wanted to come here in the first place.  It was NOT just the beer talking at Bite of LV.  These fries are good! Calamari was okay.  I had a bite of my friend's hummus and found it to be pretty bland and a little runny for my taste.  Overall, I loved the vibe of this place.

4061570,2017-07-07,2,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"I've been coming to Paymon's for awhile now for lunches during the work week and it's always been bomb.com...  Time to give some props with the details of this past lunch visit with the work crew celebrating the department ""mom's"" birthday.  Lunch party of 6 please... 

Service: 5/5 Shout out to our server ""Robert B"" and the efficient kitchen staff who took care of us with a full lunch crowd. After taking our order, in about ten minutes the Pesto Hummus, Side Fries and Dinner salad were on the table. Less than 7 minutes later, everyone had their individual entrees.  Robert stopped by frequently to make sure everyone's waters and Ice Teas were fresh.  I had to take home about 1/4 of my Giro Platter and he packaged it up for me.  They brought out the complimentary Birthday Baklava with extra spoons to share.  From sitting down to closing the bill, the whole lunch experience was under 1 hour WITH the extra birthday dessert.  Fantastic....#1 af!

Food: 4.5/5 The freshness of the vegetables and the high quality of the ingredients utilized has always stayed consistent with my lunch visits at Paymon's.   Today we went with the:
Pesto Hummus Full sized:  The Pesto compliments the hummus so well and both were very fresh.  They came out with 2 half slices pita bread for size of us and asked if we wanted more.
Athens Fries:  Seasoned fries that were fresh but not too hot.  The Seasoning and the dipping sauce is amazing.  Has the same effect on me that the Caine's sauce has, but I digress..
Gyros Platter:  The plate was huge and covered evenly with the pilaf, meat and the salad.The thinly sliced Rotisserie beef and lamb was very tasty.  Delicious.  The Vermicelli pilaf complimented the meats and the house salad on the side was fresh with a nice dressing.  So much food I had to take some home. (see pic)

Value: 5/5  Great value for the quality of food and the portions I received.  
$3.25 Athens Fries half size.
$8.50 Full sized Pesto Humus that was enough for our party of 6
$12.95 Gyros platter that had so much food I had to take some home.  For those that know me, they'll know how powerful a statement that is as my tolerance for eating through fullness is 4 out of 5 stars on a bad day.  ijs..

Ambiance: 4/5 Smartly decorated with Mediterranean art and accents throughout the restaurant.  The tables and chairs were spaced perfectly to walk through a full restaurant without bumping into anyone.  Entrees served on big plates which I always appreciate.  I can get claustrophobic when it comes to food on my plate.  I'm working on it...

Summary: I still have yet to stop by for dinner but I see a dinner visit coming soon as EVERY lunch experience I've had so far has been a positive one.  They have Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern/International and Indian entrees.   I haven't tried any of their Italian dishes but that is absolutely happening on the next mf visit. The menu is extensive, food is tasty and the service has been consistently good.

And, you guessed it! They have a awesome HAPPY HOUR (if you know me, you KNOW those are the fastest way to my heart :)!

Most of the staff is super friendly and makes sure you have everything you want/need. We ate good, they had good music, had a good hookah and great times.... All for less than 30.00!

I did not have time to try the hookahs.  I'm not even sure what a hookah is - I always thought it was a glass contraption college kids used to hide the smell of the weed they were smoking.  Or a stage prop from Alice in Wonderland.  I guess I'm not gettin jiggy with it.

In Pashas, as soon as you sit down, you are served with a free 10 inch round hot fresh naan bread along with a saucer of olive oil containing spices. And they replace it often, all complementary. 

Paymons give small pieces of dry cold triangles of pita bread.

The atmosphere is lush and exotic feeling, and they played great classic rock. I'm tired of euro-trash house music and trance, people! 

The hookah smoke was perfect and taste was great, but THEY DON'T REFILL COALS DURING HAPPY HOUR! WTF! What a waste of a good bowl.

I had the bow tie with garlic butter, and couldn't finish the entire portion (yes, I am weak, but hey it was a work meeting). The noodles were cooked well, and the sauce was good.

When I dine with my gluten-free friend, the first thing we do is ask if they have GF menu items. The hostess said they in fact do! We settled down into a cozy table in a dimly lit dining room. Tealight candles illuminated the tables. The hostess gave us a laminated sheet that had a list of their gluten-free items. My friend noticed that the fries were on the list, but there would be a high chance of cross-contamination.

As we were just looking for a quick bite, we decided to order some hummus (served with cucumber slices) and veggie stuffed grape leaves (dolmas). I ordered the broiled chicken kabob to take home. The hummus was quite smooth and creamy, though I wish we had something else to dip with than the cucumber slices (carrots? celery?). The stuffed grape leaves were okay, I would have liked a bit more seasoning.

The server was friendly and checked on us often. I got my chicken kabob just as we were ready to leave. I didn't check the chicken kabob until I got home, which was unfortunate because I saw that it included the vermicelli pilaf.

The fries are a killer and probably the best dish of the house. I have to give this place some slack because we are in Vegas so I really can't expect much.

They're famous for their ice tea and french fries. Judy sold us on those items. French fries were very flavorful. You have to love garlic to like these fries. The ice tea was tropical. I can't put my finger on it but it was refreshing on a hot october day. The first time I was there got the gyro. That was tasty and a huge portion. They're whole  menu portion is huge. This last time I went I had the ground beef kabob (Koobideh). It was really good. I ended up taking that back to the hotel. It saved me later that night when I drank a little too much.

The server found us after about 10 minutes, the cocktails were more like moonshine, and the spicy chicken curry (which we've had many times) was awful.  It was more like two cups of spicy seasoning was added instead of a proper amount.  The server didn't even offer to replace it for one of the guests who couldn't eat it.  My hubby (the spice lover) painfully choked it down.  The only reason I'm giving two stars for our last experience is for the ambiance and the Athens fries. We'll stick with W.

Paymon's is about a 5 minute walk from UNLV.  Very convenient for students who don't want to lose their prime parking spot & are tired of subway and the menu at the SU.  

You can dine in their courtyard or inside.  Sitting in the courtyard doesn't actually mean your outside... It is another section of the restaurant where there is a water fountain, some trees, and lots of frames to look at on the wall.  This place has a lot of charm and it feels like you're outside without having to dread the heat (or ummm cold.) 

One thing you must get when you're here is Athens Fries!  Crispy fries with their special seasoning sprinkled on top accompanied with the most addicting dipping sauce.  I could eat just that and be satisfied, its that good! 

The servings here are really big.  After devouring some Athens Fries, I never have enough room to finish my entree.  Got the gyro and had enough left over for the next meal.

Perfect amount of food to fill you up during your lunch break if you are at school. They have a large tea selection, which all kinds of fresh tea. They carry an assortment of black, green, and herbal teas and coffee. 

They have delicious desert. I have tried the chocolate cake which is so rich but sooo good. It is ordered from the cheesecake factory. They also have baklava.

I have tried their fried cheese appetizers which are very good.

My to-go order was not even ready, but I was told that I was not able to dine in due to already making an order, even though I wanted to order more food to dine in.

I put in a to-go order with the very congenial hostess when I arrived. They had just opened, but as I waited for my order, what seemed like regulars streamed in at a decent pace.

For my husband and I -

An order of Athens fries - a HUGE portion with oregano and other flavorings peppered all over, and it also came with their very distinct fry dipping sauce which I loved.

Two gyros - these were amazingly large and actually served for our lunch on Saturday and our lunch on Sunday as well. I was so pleased with how big these were and the amount of meat allotted to each. The meat was also succulent and delicately flavored. Of course I had mine with tzatziki sauce which was heavenly. My husband opted for his on the side and actually ended up dipping his portion of the fries into his.

Immediately upon entering the busy hookah lounge, Steph the bartender introduced herself, cleared out a table for me, listened to my sob story and made me a tasty mojito.

I've been to the other location a few times, but this was my first time here. It's probably not the best Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas. But somehow, everything I've had has just been extremely satisfying.

On this visit, I shared a few dishes with a friend. We had their Baba Ghanoush, a bowl of Cold Cucumber Soup, and a plate of their Chicken Curry. I've been thinking of cold soups lately. Cucumber Soup isn't quite what I had in mind - I was thinking something more along the lines of Vichyssoise - but it was pretty enjoyable and I couldn't stop eating it for some reason. The Baba Ghanoush was excellent. Not that I'm an expert. I didn't even realize it was made of eggplant at first. And then there's the curry. I'm a sucker for good, heart-warming curry. That's probably a strange way to describe curry, but theirs just has a ""comfort food"" effect on me. It's probably nothing special as far as curries go, but I love it nonetheless. And as always, I washed my food down with their delicious Passion Fruit Iced Tea.

Overall, I'd have to say that good food, nice ambience, and great company combined to make this a five-star experience.

Paymon's menu ranges from Italian, Greek, American, and Middle Eastern. Do you want buffalo wings? They have it. In the mood for koobideh kabobs? They have that too. Or would rather have chicken scallopini? You're ur in luck here! 

The restaurant is intimate with warm red colors and isn't too brightly lit. They have a lot of natural lighting instead. It's not so fancy where you cannot wear jeans and sandals, but it's not so casual where you cannot have a business lunch in either. The place gets busy during the lunch hours if 12-2, but the wait time has been minimal. I think I waited 10 minutes once during the holidays. You can order to go, but for orders over $100 they require a credit card. Fair enough. They do separate the meats if you order a gyro salad or chicken Alfredo to go. Since it gets juicy and/or steamy, ask for the meat container to be in another plastic bag. You will thank me later that meat juice is not all over your to go bag and the other containers in your bag.

The ground beef kabob is consistently moist and is usually my go to choice. I'm not a fan of the yellow rice that comes with it, but you can ask for white rice instead. The gyro salad is also a safe bet. My coworkers have ordered the chicken scallopini, turkey panini, and pesto chicken Alfredo several times and all had said it is very good. I recently had their tabouli salad which was massive. I could only eat half and took the rest home. Lots of parsley and lemon juice. Very filling for no meat. The Athens fries is very tasty as it has rosemary, garlic powder and I think paprika. The dipping sauce is like the same seasoning mixed with mayo. I enjoyed it. I also recommend their passion fruit tea as it is refreshing and not sweet. Service has been good lately. It used to hit and miss a couple of years ago, but it's much better now. 

There is also a hookah lounge in another section of the restaurant for evening options if you're into that. All in all, give this place a try if you haven't. If you have been here, be sure to try something new. You never know what will be your next favorite.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,23,24,4,AGdDj-xse8ExBfzQctKkYA
4702477,2015-12-11,1,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"This is one of my favorite places to eat Greek and Mediterranean food and I've been coming here since college (10 years!). I love that it's low-key, casual, but still a nice dining vibe with your significant other, friends, or family. 

Here are my go-to dishes:

Combination Platter ($13.95): Hummus, Tabuli, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Falafel, Tzatziki, Baba Ganoush, and Athens Fries. It also comes with warm and toasted pita bread. This is a generous platter (as is all their dishes) of Mediterranean favorites. I love the variety and it has all my favorite things, so I don't have to choose or order too many dishes. I love their Falafel and the Athens Fries are one of the tastiest fries in town. Also, the dipping sauce that accompanies their fries is equally delicious.

Moussaka ($13.95): Layered casserole of sliced eggplant, onions, potato, ground chuck, fresh herbs and spices, topped with Béchamel sauce and baked. Served with Basmati rice and house salad. We absolutely love the flavors of Moussaka. The herbs and spices with the wonderful meat, potato, vegetables, and the not-too-rich Béchamel.

Broiled Kabob Trio ($20.95): Marinated Chicken (boneless chicken breast marinated and rotisserie broiled over an open flame), Lamb (top sirloin domestic lamb marinated with Moroccan seasonings and rotisserie broiled), and Koobideh (Ground beef chuck marinated with onions and spices; rotisserie broiled). Served with Basmati rice, Vermicelli pilaf, house salad, and fire-roasted tomato and red pepper. This is a HUGE plate with their most popular kabobs, so if you're like me and can't decide what you want, get a little of everything. All the meats are delicious and juicy. I also love they all have different types of seasoning. I prefer their Basmati rice (which is delicious), but their Pilaf is also good and I love that they're both offered on this dish.

Gyros Pita ($8.75) OR Gyros Salad ($9.75) OR Gyros Platter ($10.95): It's no secret that I love gyro meat, so anyway I can eat, I'll get it. All of these options are essentially the same - Gyros, vegetables, rice/pita - and it just depends on my mood. A sandwich (I love the fresh vegetables and Tzatziki sauce here), a salad (lose the pita for a low-carb option and you get a mountain of fresh vegetables) or a plate (rice and salad).

Service is always nice and we've never had any trouble with our food or bill. It's a bit away from us and their other location is a slightly closer, so we'll visit when in the area.

They sell their spice blends including the Athens Fries mix on location.

Also, Wednesdays 5-9PM is Customer Appreciation Night and it's 25% off your bill (dine-in cafe only).",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,4,4,vE7m76ZKe_7-WRh_qFeGGg

4749816,2008-07-04,5,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"This place apparently has been here time eternal (""You know Frank Sinatra? He's dead. DEAD!"" *giggle*) according to the group of nursing student outside, who also pointed out good spots to de-stress during the midweek. For another time and yet another review. Speaking of the outside, their patio area is clean and relaxed during the fall term, but they don't have those misting things that I've seen at other places, making it murder in the summertime. Then again, the act of breathing is murder in the summertime here in our beautiful artifice where Nicolas Cage goes to die. So make it a point to please don't eat outside if you have a choice. If it's packed during lunch (which it normally is as UNLV kidz metabolize carbs like the Jamaican bobsled team on a moonshine run) come back later for dinnertime or afterhours. Trust me, it's a lot funner inside.  

Several great things about Paymon's: A) Hookah lounge is well-maintained (nothing more disconcerting in life than ""residue""....it's up there with some random asshole waiting in the bank line with you talking candidly about their recent colonic) and often not very full, there's subdued lighting which greatly enhances the mood and ambience. B) Athens Fries. I'm normally not too big on fries, but these properly seasoned and lightly oiled goods are, in proper culinary terms, fucking magnifique. If you're the type who carries around a boxcutter in your pocket so you can enlarge the orifice atop the ketchup bottle for Greater Pour Capability, you're missing the point. Athens Fries must be enjoyed on their own merits, that is, sans Heinz. 

Finally, the Chicken Skewers+Hummus+Loaded Meat Pita (+5dp Combo Bonus, +1 Comfort) are by far my favorite standbys whenever I am here. Meats are never too dry, hummus has consistent texture and does not ever have that overly acidic aftertaste that the lesser players bring to the table, and the Pita is sooooo overstuffed it'll fuel whatever adventures you have planned for a lengthy period of time after you leave. Great value for your money. There's a reason why so many other reviewers have enjoyed their time here. And....that's about it, no punchline. Lest things get too predictable.

The vegetarian dolmas  are drenched in taziki sauce.  The  kibbeh falafals tasted like they were frozen. The koobideh kabob is broiled in the oven.  Serving broiled kabobs would make you a laughing stock in the middle-east.  Thats like serving barbecue made in the oven.

The only reason I came here was for the hookah happy hour.  I came here ten times and on the 11th time some new guy said I looked too young for my ID and refused to serve me.  He called his manager who looked like he graduated high school last year. I'm 34 but guess I am getting younger.  The staff are mixed bag.  I always see somebody new in the hookah lounge. All of them look under 25 and seem like they hate their job. This is typical doucebagy Vegas server attitude.  When I called the general manager to complain, he never returned my call.

All entrees were pretty good. The meat is always pretty tender and seasoned well. Still not as delicious as the dip, though. Their Athen's fries and dipping sauce are quite tasty as well! Decent Hummus and Pesto Hummus. Their Saganaki was good, but sadly the serving was pretty small for a cheese lover such as myself. Extra points for the sizzling skillet it's served on though!

They are super-quick with the orders (at least for a one-person order), and the woman who handles these orders is so friendly and nice.  My food is usually waiting for me by the time I get there (my office is only like a mile away!)

What I don't like: the prices are a bit high for the portion size and quality.  At almost $10 for a sandwich, I should be delighted and/or stuffed afterward.  Also I hate that their Athens fries are ridiculously delicious, forcing me to either order them and eat them all (when I'm trying to eat responsibly) or not order them and want to cry.  They add some magical addictive spice to these perfectly cooked crispy potatoes that makes me love them and, probably like Joan Jett would feel if she were on a diet, hate myself for loving them.  

My go-to orders are the falamus (falafel and hummus) wrap and the fattosh salad.  Sometimes I'll get the baba ghannoush, I'm a fan of that as well.  Limited vegan options, but decent (not great) enough.

There are two locations and, although the Sahara site is ""fancier"" I actually prefer the South Maryland Parkway location.  It's in this strip mall by UNLV Medical Center (that's how I found it but that's  a story in itself...)  It looks very unimpressive from the outside and, frankly, I would NEVER have gone there in the first place had I not been scouring the path from UNLV to my hotel after 10 PM at night--STARVING! My sister and I entered the building desperately hoping to find SOMETHING-----ANYTHING!  

When you enter the building, it looks like a very basic diner of sorts--not fancy...but look to the far right and you will see a wall you will need to dodge in the event of an earthquake!  It is LOADED with plaques, articles and other kudos.  Zagat rated, this little hidden gem is an unexpected  surprise if you are not a local ""in the know!""

Paymon's caters to may tastes...Vegetarian...non-vegetarian...picky eaters...there's something for everyone!  Their specialty is Mediterranean food--and it's awesome!  I love the appetizer plate with all vegetarian selections.    Not caring for grape leaves or spanikopita, I used to request more falafel and/or hummus as substitution but they did not flex at my last visit.  The flexibility for substitutions has changed over time so I can't tell you if this is set in stone but  I suggest you complain if they don't allow ""tradesies""--maybe Paymon will change his mind!!!

The lentil soup is a great start.  And if you pair the appetizer plate with their vermicelli rice, the combo may just be enough to feed two people!  If you or someone in your party does not care for Mediterranean food (yes, it really DOES happen, however hard to imagine!) then there is always...pasta.  I'm not kidding.  And their pasta is, remarkably, very, very good.  It took me five years before I ever tried their pasta because I adore the Mediterranean selections.  However, someone in my dinner party opted to try the pasta and everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their ""just a taste.""  

After dinner, you should check out their cappuccino...a world traveling friend of mine remarked with astonishment that it was THE BEST cappuccino she had EVER had!  Quite a compliment indeed!

If you step through the restaurant past the restrooms and into an enclosed courtyard, you will see a door to a ""Hookah Lounge.""  While I can't critique the H Lounge because it's not my thing, I can tell you that the decor is cool and the place is hopping as the night progresses.

I must say the service is very good.  I met with Paymon over lunch many years ago and we talked about his business model.  He seems to attract and retain top talent because the wait team really is very good.  At the time, his compensation package was above industry standard and included profit sharing and this translated into a team that takes ownership.

Last, but not least...price!  The food is reasonably priced for the quality...and if you go on a Wednesday between certain hours (look it up), you will enjoy ""Customer Appreciation Night"" which is a whopping 25% off your whole ticket!

Overall, I enjoy Paymons.  I feel like the quality and price of the food match up.  I have tried most of the veggie appetizers.  They have good baba ghanosh, good hummus and tasty falfels.  

My favorite entrees are the veggie platter (which comes with there seasoned fries!) and the veggie kabobs.  The veggie kabobs comes with hummus and rice, so you might want to skip an appetizer, if you don't want to eat to much.  

I love the tea selection here, because it's all loose leaf, and they have a huge selection.  My personal fav is the oolong, although my friend always gets the cold comfort.

They have a great atrium that connects the hookah lounge and the restaurant itself. It has a beautiful fountain and tons of plants and trees. It's just like your eating outside. If you go into the hookah area of Paymon's it is very dimly lit with lots of plush seating. Since it was happy hour (starts at 5pm) I went to the bar and ordered us a couple of drinks. I choose the Lychee Martini and Joel had a Mai Tai. Both drinks were very tasty and mixed perfectly. Not to mention excellently priced due to happy hour!

As far as food goes we shared both the Athens Fries and the Baba Ganoush which came with warm pitas. We both loved the sauce that came with the Athens Fries. Don't be afraid to try the Baba Ganoush. Even if you don't like eggplant, you really might like this. It's like hummus, but better! I also asked for some cucumbers to use in the Baba Ganoush. 

We also both ordered the standard gyro with lamb and beef. I loooove the taziki sauce that comes in the gyro. I could totally slather that all over the whole thing!! The meat was garlicky and had great flavor and the pita did not fall all apart when I picked it up. 

Service was beyond wonderful. They were very attentive and always kept our water glasses filled. The bartender even was nice enough to bring our drinks out to us in the atrium.

But in the case of Paymon's I have to thoroughly disagree and put her on blast for her one time skewed sensibility and taste.  I don't understand why you would present an unfavorable rating to an establishment you admittedly will return to.

Paymon's on Maryland is easily one of my favorite places to eat her in LV.  It has a courtyard with great atmosphere, wonderful food and what I deem very reasonable prices.  I never liked hummus until I tried it at Paymon's and it is now a staple item when ever I visit.

The chicken curry was a food-gasm to me from the very first bite.  The pita was definitely NOT stale, and from what I have tasted of my children's and wife's food, the Italian was admirable.

My one issue with Paymon's is that on a few occasions, the service wasn't consistently attentive.  Many times we have had exemplary service from the wait staff.  On more than a couple instances however, we were made to wait longer than I would prefer for refills, the check or appetizers.  The few blemishes on otherwise phenomenal service are the only things keeping me from posting a perfect 5 stars.

On Weds, 5-9 they do customer appreciation with 25% off your entire bill. I didn't know that, just went on the day by chance! 

The fiance and I shared several things. 

Cold cucumber yogurt soup - the serving was good and it was nice and cooling. It wasn't very cucumber-y though still decent. I liked the crushed nuts and raisins in it. 

Koobideh plate- it was a bit dry, but the seasoning was pleasant on it. If only it wasnt overcooked it would have been tasty town. Rice, grilled tomato pepper and salad were standard, but good. 

Combination platter - the hummus I liked a lot, tsatziki and tabouli was good, the babaganoush was a bit too smokey, stuffed grape leaves were standard, their falafel was really crispy if you like it that way and their fries had a pretty yummy seasoning on them and were crisp yet soft inside still.

The portions were really generous. The koobideh came with twice was much meat as most places. Overall I enjoyed the food here even though there were a few execution misses, but I would eat here again. I used to go to the Sahara location quite a bit when I first moved to Vegas, but it's been a minute.

The thing that made the experience a bit less was the service. I'm a pretty forgiving judge on servers, but we didn't get drink refills and our server was often not in the dining room to flag down. I got a to-go box from a busser. When we asked for the check, she went to check out on other tables, took a table behind us order and then realized she didn't bring it and went to get it. We were gonna pay with card, but realized she wasn't anywhere again so we just paid with cash between us so we can go. I can wait for food, but when I'm trying to leave is the only time I get a bit impatient with being held hostage. 

The experience is exactly 3 stars, pretty middle of the road. I may try it again though at the Sahara location as I'm rarely ever down here.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,1,3,cuALf1kSImyY1Bw2ooTxfQ

I have always had a wonderful experience whenever I have sat down to eat. The service is friendly, attentive, and fast. I have been both for lunch and dinner and have used their to-go services, and all of them are great. There is indoor, outdoor (with misters), and courtyard seating and all of them are very comfortable and have a wonderful ambience. 

They have an excellent selection of foods ranging from salads, to Greek favorites like moussaka, spanakopita, and gyros, to all-you-can-eat pastas. There is something for almost everyone here,  BUT the true ""staple"" of this restaurant in particular are what most of my friends and I have dubbed ""CRACK"" fries (or Athen's Fries as their menu calls them). They are the most addictive food I have ever had, namely because of a delicious seasoning they smother them in. The sauce added to go with makes it a perfect storm of addictive, delicious, and bad for you.

I have tried several different foods from their menu over the time I have been eating here, and I have never disliked anything on the menu. There are some meals that are obviously better than others, but I can genuinely say that I have not had a bad meal at this restaurant. But, I have fallen into a pattern now, and I get the gyro pita sandwich, wrap, with a side of fries. In the colder months, I love to get a hot tea to go with the sandwich, and they have a great variety in their selection of teas. I recommend the mango ceylon, and any of the green teas.

But I digress.  I'd visited Vegas many times before we finally made it to this place, because it keeps weird hours, and always seemed to be closed when we wanted to go.  We finally caught it on a night when it was open, and it remains my first and best hookah lounge experience.

When you enter, there's an interior ""courtyard"" dividing the Greek cafe on the right, and the hookah lounge on the left.  There are tables set up here for ""sidewalk"" dining, and this is also where they seat the overflow on the hookah lounge's waiting list.  Service isn't great out here, because the servers are usually hurrying back to the kitchen and don't check on you very much, but we did eat out here once.  I had the stuffed grape leaves, which were good but not outstanding, and the Greek fries, which lived up to all the hype.

The hookah lounge itself has great ambience: red velvety swags of fabric on the walls, sultry-eyed portraits of harem maidens everywhere, plus ornamental hookahs and pretty chandeliers.  The seating consists of low, plush couches with big cushions, perfect for lounging indolently while you smoke.

When you sit down, they'll present you with a tray of maybe fifteen different tobacco flavors in little tins.  I've enjoyed the apple, jasmine, and vanilla - banana was interesting, but weird.  Once you choose, they'll fill up your hookah, turn it on, and after a couple of minutes, it's ready to go.  The base lights up in an ever-changing rotation of colors, which is fun to look at, and each person gets an individual disposable plastic mouthpiece for the communal hookah pipe.

One order of tobacco is good for about 30 minutes of smoke - you'll know your hookah is dead when you have to take a lung-busting inhale to get it to bubble.  If I recall correctly, it was about $15 for one sitting, so definitely take some pals to split the cost.  They're pretty good about not hassling you to leave, especially if you keep the drink orders coming, but they do have a last call (an alien concept for us Nevadans), so keep an eye on your watch.

Between the crowds of customers and the bellydancing/techno background music, it can get fairly noisy here, and it's not a place to go for quiet conversation with an intimate date.  But as an exotic stop on a boozy night out, or a post-party chill session before heading home, everybody loves the hookah lounge, the hookah hookah hookah hookah lounge...",Ffa1cXIvFAy8H1sorICaiQ,2,2,4,YAUHklfsbtmO3d48lS8QDw

In addition to the great brewed iced tea, they also offer a selection of loose leaf teas in pots. I appreciate that. 

More than likely you can expect a wait around lunchtime, and on my last visit, the host seemed a bit overwhelmed. We weren't greeted, and the seating process was a little confusing. However, once we were seated Anthony, our server, was terrific. 

They do have a hookah lounge. They are open pretty late seven days a week, and on this visit, I noticed they have Customer Appreciation night on Wednesday - 25% between 5-7pm. (I think those are the right times. Double check my quick tip!)

In fact, I have been there multiple times since. I prefer this location to their other location in W. Las Vegas. It is more authentic, in my experience.

The highlight of Paymon's is definitely their deserts. Their kataif and baklava are out of this world. I like their salads as well. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is great--I like the dim lit place with Mediterranean paint on walls. The staff is always friendly and although this restaurant is usually packed--the staff remains engaged and not overly stressed.

The only draw back--I am not very fond of their Greek dishes here. Some of the hot dishes are not necessarily bad, just bland and average. But, I usually try to go for the usual--baba ghanoush, humus, pita as appetizers and salads as entrees, and am very satisfied.

After hours dining happens at the adjacent huka lounge, which has a very ethnic atmosphere without much smoke permeating the air. It is not overcrowded either, unless you come on a Saturday night.

I recommend this place for affordable Mediterranean place. Don't forget to try the deserts and the Fatoush salad!

Apparently food from the cafe is available, but you'd have to be seriously stoned to want to eat here. And since the staff simply will not load the hookahs with hash, that is unlikely to happen.

This is primarily a locals hangout, as it's somewhat off the beaten path. The Lounge is a long, narrow room, swathed in red fabric. An upholstered banquette runs along each wall, giving the impression that you are at a hookah smoke-off. The hookahs are attached to the tables, in order to prevent some sort of misadventure, I suppose. This also allows the placement of colored LEDs beneath each hookah, so the color changes as you smoke. Trippy, dude. The tables are surrounded by tuffets. Yes, just like that used by Miss Muffet. The seating places you close enough to the ground for intimacy, but not so near as to cause leg cramps. The decor is something out of an absinthe-fueled fever dream. In addition to the swags and gold cords and velvet tuffets, there is every painting of a harem or odalisque known to man. It is as if an art historian specializing in 19th century Romanticism went on a shopping spree.

The Hookah Lounge is primarily about two things: tobacco and alcohol. Call it what you may, flavor it with apple, cherry or chocolate, it is still tobacco. The drinks match the tobacco, in that they are sweet and colorful. I had a Tanqueray and tonic, because I'm mean.",V7N4zvbBz4xz_NCTRm-yfA,0,0,3,GYAaGJH2clQH8jD4gXQGJw

I love to eat in the courtyard, but I had an awful experience with the late shift. I will let it rest with a simple statement about the inattentive and down right neglectful server. 

The food is also better during the shifts I listed because you get the full menu instead of the late hour one which is limited. The biggest difference is that you cannot get rice with your entrees and they substitute it with hummus. Their hummus is not bad, but it is better if you ask for pesto to be put on it.

My group does not come here as often as we used to, with the exception of one, who makes it a ritual every week. Still, if you ask anyone what is a staple for every visit they will scream, ""CRACK FRIES!"". Listed as Athen's fries, but we call them crack fries, because the seasoning is as addictive as the drug. Not only do they generously coat it in this stuff, but they mix it into their mayo dipping sauce, and then place a bottle at your table. Watch out because you might overdo it on the sodium, if you are not careful. 

Another dish that is worth trying is the tandoori chicken. It is cooked perfectly, although the seasoning is lacking. If you pair it up with the mango chutney, it is delightful. I personally prefer the lamb kebabs, they are juicy, and perfect, when cooked to a medium rare. I still ask for a side of mango chutney, but that is not due to a lack of flavor. It is just my obsession with mango anything.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,4,1hhE0IVkBk-pC9aKMv1sMg

Perusing the reviews I saw someone else mention they call them that as well.  Now I dont feel so special.  Back then we'd go as this large group and order family style: just picking and choosing from the menu and sharing everything.  Based on those experiences I would have given it 5 stars each and every time.   From the Shrimp, Artichoke and Cheese Dip and Combination Dip plate for appetizers, to the Gyro Salad, Eggplant Parmesan, Penne Pesto Pasta and of course a side of Crack Fries all washed down with their Passion Fruit Iced Tea, it was essentially my favorite lunch spot for a number of years, and basically my introduction to Mediterranean cuisine that had previously been limited to gyro sandwiches at carnivals or mall food courts.   

Fast forward some years and a new job that's much further, along with a lot more experience with Mediterranean food than I had before, and a little bit of the luster has worn off.   I've been back sporadically dining in much smaller groups and as a couple and have had a mix of good and bad.  The gyro salad is still always a good choice, and I do still enjoy their pita gyros even though I've certainly had better.  I still love their Combination Dip platter, and if you like hummus you're doing a disservice to yourself in not trying the Hummus with Pesto dip here.  I've had the pita bread and crack fries range from hot and delicious to coming out cold and hardened.  I'm also not a huge fan of their falafel and rank it among some of the worst I've had here in Las Vegas.   The Passion Fruit iced tea remains delicious which is comforting.

Along with that I don't understand the need to try to incorporate a bunch of different offerings and making an all in one restaurant out of what was clearly a well defined Mediterranean restaurant. Go back to doing simple, tasty Greek food and leave the Denny's menu alone.

What made this experience perfect was our server David T.  His knowledge about the food and its origins impressed everyone on the table.  (At one point we thought he was making half the stuff up, but we looked it up on my I phone and he was right on the money.)  

We asked him a simple question of where does baklava come from.  We expected a simple answer like Greece or the Middle East, however the answer we got impressed us all.  He started the answer by saying ""the history of baklava is not very well documented, and it has been claimed by many ethnic groups, but there is strong evidence that is of Central Asian Turkic origin.""  Central Asian Turkic origin!!!  Who the hell talks like that!  He then talked about the Ottoman Empire, ancient Mesopotamia and an old Chinese cookbook.  Needless to say we ordered two of them.

I didn't realize, but this is right down the road from my house. Oops! 

We sat on the patio, which we were assured was air conditioned-- and it was, it's totally covered and basically just a room. The waiter asked what we'd like to drink and I replied, ""ALL OF THE WATER, please."" He obliged. Oh god, best water ever (granted, I was basically dying of dehydration at that point, so perhaps that had some effect on my perceptions). 

We got an appetizer of hummus, which was good. My only complaint is that I like my hummus a little more flavorful than theirs is--- like, a lot of garlic vs theirs, which is a bit bland. Not sure I'd get the hummus appetizer again for this reason, but if you're a fan of less garlic, then you'll be happy.

For the main meal, I got the gyro salad which was absolutely phenomenal. My friend got a fattoush salad, which she loved. 

Will definitely be back.",Ll_IZTr6GnZC8SfpEU-dKg,2,0,4,chGN0MQd2wAj7lVZ7i2aEQ

I waited to do a review of Paymon's until i had had a chance to try a few of their dishes.

The curries...If you are in any way shape or form a curry fan, avoid them, though well cooked, they taste like something out of a jar, not good.

Chicken Parm...Oh yeah, this is the stuff, a very well done chicken parm is hard to find, they nail it, just a little hint though, skip the pasta and go with the Athens fries, yes I know, I hang my head in shame, but they make such a great combination.

Spaghetti Bolognese ...An ok interpretation of a classic dish, I have certainly had better, I have also had far worse.

Fesenjan...My wife's favorite, a little to sweet for my tastes, but she raves about it so it must be good.

I can honestly say, the service has been good each time we have been there, the empty coke glass test get's passed every time, so I am happy.

5641022,2015-07-05,1,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"My cousin picked Paymon's for dinner one night during our last stay in Vegas so I ended up dining here a couple of days ago. Paymon's is located a couple of miles off the strip so it was nice to get away from all the lights and hustle bustle for a change. At the peak dinner time the restaurant was empty with only two other patrons inside. It also felt very small like only a small section of the restaurant was open for dinner service (I'm not sure but I'm guessing there was a hookah section to the left which ate up some of the space of the restaurant making the open section look tiny). The lighting was also very dim which made for an intimate setting not a family eating environment.

The server who took care of us was very friendly and made the dining experience more enjoyable that what it was. Most people in our group got standard Mediterranean dishes like the Gyro Platter ($11.95) and the Chicken Kabab ($15.95) along with a side of fries ($2.95) and some kids pasta ($3.75). I decided to be a little more enterprising and got the Fesenjan ($13.95) on the recommendation of the server (he did mention that it was a sweet so in case I did not like sweet I should get something else). The wait for the food was very long. After 20 minutes we were just about to cancel our orders and leave when the first plate was delivered which was slowly followed by other orders.

Taste-wise it was hit and miss with more misses than hits. Let's start with the good stuff. The Chicken Kabab was hands down the best dish served. The kabab was completely cooked through yet nice and juice. The rice and other stuff on the plate was also good. The gyro was hard and rubbery like it had been chopped up earlier and refrigerated and then was microwaved before being sent to the table or alternatively it could be that it was grilled for so long that it had become completely dehydrated and fit for the dustbin. The Fesenjan which is basically Iranian chicken stew made from pomegranate molasses and ground walnuts that give the stew a sweet and tart flavor, was by itself very good but the white rice in the center was almost raw like it had been hurriedly steamed and added to the plate. Maybe steaming the white rice was the reason for the extremely long wait but that's what my gut feel is as the rice that came with the Chicken kabab and the gyro platter was the flavored rice which was cooked right. Anyway it made eating that dish almost impossible and even tough I was hungry I could not eat more that half of the Fesenjan which was a shame as it was pretty good.

Overall I was not completely satisfied with Paymon's. If it would have not been for the friendliness of our server I would have rated this place only 2 stars. I'm not sure if I will return.",HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA,4,2,3,Zvqmq0trK3jGgGS5Xoh0bA

Atmosphere really makes the culture & the cuisine come alive. Spacious, decorated in fine Mediterranean style, & really gets you engaged in the culture of the food. I can see why this place has won so many 'Best of Las Vegas' awards, because when I was sat I was immediately greeted by a friendly server who was very knowledgeable about the menu & overall kindness goes a long way. I expressed it was my first time at Paymon's, & he did an excellent job to explain & guide me through the menu.

Purchasing the felafel pita, it was the only item I was going for until my server offered me to test out their famous Athen's fries. While french fries are often redundant & boring to myself, I have to say Athen's fries are quite possibly the greatest fries I've EVER had! The seasoning with the side-sauce for dipping compliments each other so finely I had to hold myself back from scarfing the fries down before the pita. The felafel pita itself was delicious as well.

I'm interested in returning here again to try out more of their dishes, since the atmosphere & the flavors of seasoning they use in their food truly won me over (as well as the attentive service I got!)

5863791,2013-07-23,1,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"This is a two part review. 

The cafe portion of Paymon's is actually quite nice, and is the only reason one should patronize this business. The food overall is delicious, with a variety of Mediterranean with some American fusion and South Asian cuisine rounding out the menu. The Athens Fries are without the best French fries I've had at ANY establishment, so they are a must get when going. Otherwise, the rest of the menu is fairly consistent in quality (not necessarily authenticity) and should be experimented with. The gyros, pastas, kabobs and curries have all been worthwhile dishes to try in my opinion. Lastly, the cafe has some great ambiance, especially during lunch time, with plenty of natural lighting and well-done decor.

Paymon's would be worthy of a 4 or a 5 star review if only the cafe were being reviewed. Unfortunately the attached hookah lounge prevents that. Simply put, Paymon's serves some of the worst and most overpriced hookah in the city. It's actually appalling how bad it is, given the quality of nearly everything else about the establishment. First, Paymon's uses molasses, an extremely inferior alternative to sheesh a tobacco. Flavors are weaker, and the amount of smoke produced is pathetic. This goes hand in hand with absolutely mind-boggling decision to use instant lighting charcoals. The charcoals are of very, very low quality and burn out easy, which is why Paymon's uses a metal cover to insulate the heat of the coal, a practice that typically results in burning the bowl. The ultimate kick in the groin is that despite using coals that are low quality and burn out quickly, additional coals are NOT free, when practically every other hookah lounge will give you at least 2-3 coal refills, if not more on request. Overall, despite the ambiance and food menu, the lounge is definitely not worth it if you were expecting a good hookah experience. Stick to the cafe.",kHKK7IiFwiHgS8xEhN3EVA,1,0,3,OUKUkayogBFwoKO6z0oV5Q

Excellent place for date-night (and you'll witness the validity of that statement on your next visit by all the other couples lounging around) My wife and I have been going here at least a couple times a month for the last year or so.

 I'm not crazy about the food selection, although that is not primarily why I go here in the first place. I smoke a mixture they have called ""The Thief,"" which is one of the tastiest flavors I've ever had while smoking hookah, and I have been know to grab a smoke here and there for the last 12 years or so when smoking hookah wasn't ""the cool thing to do"" as it come to be.

On that note, Paymon's has been one of the first players in Las Vegas to have a hookah lounge. They've been around for 10 years plus I would guess.

Try to go on a night where the Salvadorian guy (forgot his name) is working; he really knows how to take care of people and is great with the hookah. This place is really relaxing, the drinks are tasty, and the quality of music that creates the vibe is hard to come by anywhere else.",l_yEb3Q-q7C5Eq1HReCrzw,1,1,4,MNzjPAEUKgfBVJ6IsbT_RA

besides the athens fries i don't recall what we had, but they were all so delish. those fries though, are something else! everything about this place is awesome- the food, waiters/waitresses and atmosphere! 

did i mention that they also have a hookah lounge?  pretty chill place to be. i'm from hawaii and can't wait for my next vaca to have some paymon's again!",h-_7eL4MCaXavXKJZOFeEg,0,0,5,VkZVsYQhthoc1oNUV9brJA
5931971,2015-11-17,0,f4kNNLU_0q_2J711jCN7dA,"Came here last week to try out their Hookah.  Upon entering the Venue, you are greeted by a sign that says please see host to be seated with an arrow pointing to the right.  Following the directions we make a walk that deems us awkward through the restaurant just to get to the host.  We say we want hookah and they point us back to our starting point.  I ask a random worker about hookah and they point us to another room that is actually to the left and said we can just go right in.  (Whats up with the misleading sign?)  

After sitting down we wait for 10 - 15 minutes just to get a menu.  another 10 minutes for the order to be taken then after the order was taken, we wait another 10 to 15 minutes for the waitress to come back and asked what we ordered again.  The place wasn't even busy.  

The Hookah and drinks come out and I was really disappointed by the quality.  Really basic sub par quality that you can DIY at home.  Cheap Egyptian style bowl with the basic lid literally straight from a discount smoke shop.  I was hoping the Hookah wouldve been good since it IS a hookah lounge.  Not to mention probably the worst selection of early 80's music available.  Fans and doors were wide open as well so no chance of blowing o's are doing anything with the little hookah smoke their hookah's produced.  

If I didn't know about hookah I guess it wouldn't have been super bad just okay and nothing special.",aBKfBuDXSMAUdQWFfEgn7g,0,0,1,jjZxuxZJGX-bzlMOODIOnQ

On the other hand, the service was some where between less than adequate and bad.

A couple of other things...

- Can some one explain the appeal of falafel?  They almost always taste greasy and sit on your stomach like a brick.  No exception here.
- For some reason the pita bread here tasted like it was a week old.  Taste, texture and look it looked like some cheap store bought pita like substance.  How does that happen?

We had planned on going to Paymons after having a couple drinks at The Garage last weekend.  Paymons says its open until 2 am. At 1:10 they were closed. Located on hookah lounge door btw.
Perhaps an emergency. I was totally disappointed though. :(

We are coming back before 1 am soon!",P1JqTh13dpAZ16U1ZPw_IA,8,7,4,0dS3rerM-CH0dDKeQjy2_w

I've never had a single dish here wow me (usually overcooked) and I think it's overpriced for what you get. 

The atmosphere is nice and they do have a nice hookah lounge that I find to be it's only saving grace. Not a place I recommend or even enjoy going to for a meal, but if you're there it does the trick, just not outstandingly. 

Overall, go for hookah, go elsewhere for food.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,2,cWM7623Qi8I-QQxKzwroZA
