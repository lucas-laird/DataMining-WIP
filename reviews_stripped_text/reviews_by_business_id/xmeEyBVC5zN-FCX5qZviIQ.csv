If you call to complain about it you will be told what the average tip is for your building and how you are ' too cheap'. Also if you put your tip on a credit card via their on line ordering and not on the slip in front of the driver , the drivers don't understand that  and think you are giving them nothing, and pitch an even bigger fit.  Dinner and a show! 

Thankfully the security guard in my building put a stop to it. 

So you tell me folks, is expecting a $10 tip on a $20 food order ( including $2 ' delivery fee ' )  the norm? 50%?",e6v57-7Z9MYD3dwAznyRBw,3,0,1,9dedH5UDDNxPCe-xzIrX2A

My favorite thing to order is house special lomein and the egg foo young along with some wontons. Only chinese restaurant that has ducksauce eastcoast style.

Not greasy at all and the vegetable and meat are very fresh.

Excellent prices and very nice sized portions.

The may serve egg rolls you can buy at Sam's Club but for $1 each they are crispy and delicious.

They deliver and you get your food hot off the stove and delivered super fast.

I have not has a bad meal there yet.

Love the Moo Goo Gai Pan, Orange Chicken, Beef & Broccoli and more!

Keep up the great work.

First off, I will digress. I learned a lot about Chinese food this weekend. Chopstix is noteworthy for serving ""east coast"" style chinese. I am from the midwest, so I was intrigued. Apparently ""east coast"" style chinese is more Americanized. Its more heavy sauce based/ deep fried based than your average ""west coast"" chinese. I definitely found out after eating at Chopstix that I love east coast chinese food haha. I had always wondered why chinese food in Vegas left me so unsatisfied, and its because they are so different on the two coasts! Who would have thunk?

Delivery was fast and the food was still hot. Everything we ordered was prepared very well and had lots of flavor. The thing we liked most was the value. We got enough food for 3 meals each for about $10 per person. This place is now one of my favorite for chinese in vegas.",T18ONQv62KWYceY7BE0xtQ,0,1,4,5ifU74zptrwpM5Edy50MwQ

It's not overwhelmingly greasy, and they use a decent amount of vegetables, but the couple of dishes I've tried all seem to be fairly bland and my guy has complained that they're a little stingy with the protein.

No. No. and No! This place must drench their food in grease. This time around, I ordered some garlic chicken dish that comes with ""red fried rice."" The garlic chicken tasted....""off."" I can't really make out what the taste was but I definitely did NOT taste garlic. What's odd is that I tasted BAMBOO SHOOTS instead!!! Ummm...what!?!?!?! Why would someone put bamboo shoots in a garlic chicken dish!?!?! Two strong tasting flavors should NOT be mixed like that. And for those of you who know how bamboo shoots smell/taste like would know what I mean. With these nasty little creatures (or tasty, depends on how your taste buds are), you either love em or hate em.

Chopstix, you utterly failed in my book. I don't care if you are less than 5 minutes away from where I live. Even if this was given to me for free, I would NOT eat their food. Stay away from here.

     We were hungry and my 7 year old wanted Panda, but I was in the mood for Cashew Chiken and Panda does not have Cashew Chicken. So I search on my iphone for a chineses fast food restaurant. Chopstix Express right across the street pops up. 
      The first thing I do when I walk in is ask ""Do you have the lunch special still"" to this the guy behind the counter replies no and points me to the combination specials on the menu. So I look at the menu read and ponder what else to get besides cashew chicken. After I ordered I look at the menu again and I noticed the lunch special on the back of the menu, everything I have ordered is $5 cheaper, and that it is daily and ends at 3pm. So I didn't think of it much but that I probably just missed it, oh well!       
      When I get in the car and started to head home, I looked at the receipt and noticed that the time of order was 2:58pm. So I make a U turn and go back to show him the receipt. When he sees the receipt he says ""oh no the credit card time is wrong, and it printed the wrong time, and that I ordered at 3:02 and not 2:58pm. 
     I am like wow really!! ""You know as soon as I walked into the store I asked you: do you have the lunch special. To this you lied to me and said no and pointed the combination special on the menu to me. You know that it took me atleast 5 minutes to read and decide what I wanted to order. So you telling me I didn't make it on time! You are dishonest. I will never order from you guys again!
      To this he replies If I have to loose your businees than thats ok.!!! 
Wow I dont know about you guys, but for a business to lie so that they can earn $5 more from their customers, is just rediculous and wrong in so many ways.

2901952,2008-03-23,1,xmeEyBVC5zN-FCX5qZviIQ,"Well, the main reason I wanted to try this place was because of its building.  It looks like a 50s style drive-in burger joint (cute tiny building) that is now a Chinese quick eats/take out/delivery restaurant.  The restaurant delivers within a 5 mile radius.  It also boasts using 100% vegetable oil and NO MSG.  The second reason I wanted to try it was because I saw on the sign (driving past it one day) that it served New York style Chinese food.

We called ahead and ordered General Tso's Chicken $6.95 and Chicken w/Broccoli $7.50.  10 minutes later we picked up our food.  The inside was diner-like, a bit rustic and in some need of updating.  There might have been about five small tables to eat-in.  The kitchen where the food is cooked is almost fully exposed so you can watch all of the action take place right in front of you.  Calling your order in at a Chinese restaurant isn't really necessary since everytime you call an order in for Chinese food, don't they always say ""okay, 10 minuss"" (sic, please do not take offense, as I am Asian too--just silly!).  

Anyway, we got our food home and dug in.  The portions were very large.  The General Tso's Chicken was ""tasty"" as my source called it yet ""average.""  My chicken w/broccoli was good but lacked the taste of ginger, garlic, and sugar (the New York part).  However, the broccoli and carrots were fresh and the chicken was all tender white meat.  When our bellies were full, our tins of food still looked full!  I also must add the white rice was perfect and I was told the fried rice was ""good.""

This comment isn't meant to slight the restaurant but, I don't know if we'll order from here again, as there are WAY TOO MANY Chinese restaurants to try with Chinatown being so close to us!   FYI, this is NOT a late night Chinese eatery, they close @ 10:30 pm seven days a week.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,3,1,3,dHP_jsLrwRxHLB5APlzZDQ

 I have been driving past Chopstix express since we moved here one year ago. I used to live in Guangzhou (Canton) in China in the 80s and we had some damn good street food there.
I ordered some steamed dumplings, some walnut shrimp, and some ma pu tofu.
Well, even before tasting the food I felt like I was back on the streets of Guangzhou listening to the yelling and shouting in Cantonese between the customers and the staff, but this was not fighting yelling this is just normal Cantonese volume.
In about eight minutes I had three platters of food very hot and fresh in a bag and I raced on home. The food is delicious and fresh. The place was busy enough because it was well before lunch hour that I came by and people who know their Chinese food or chowing down believe me.
This appears to be one of those little hole in the wall places that you don't look twice at but for me now I will return and try some more items as it was pretty good. This is enough food for two adults' dinner, or 3 lunches, and now I have got to share it with my husband.",hd-S4mtrPY9Q6iuBJegnOQ,2,2,4,pgNyn1XSQnZNtK-ymFryIw

Tonight I ordered a Pu Pu platter appetizer and a Shrimp Lo Mein dinner. I requested chili sauce for the Lo Mein and extra hot mustard and plum sauced for the large appetizer platter. I got 1 small packet of the plum sauced and no mustard or chili sauce.

I decided to stop by and grab some dinner on the way home this evening. 

BIG MISTAKE! 

EXPENSIVE PRICES FOR BAD QUALITY BLAND AND TASTELESS FOOD! 

I ordered the garlic chicken which was full of vegetables, very little and few pieces of chicken. This was more like garlic vegetables! The sauce on the chicken was the best part of the dish, just wish there had been a decent amount of the actual ""chicken"" in my ""garlic chicken"" dish! 

The crab rangoon appetizer was ok, thankfully as that was all I ended up having for dinner. 

I will NOT be back as the prices are outrageous for the poor quality ""food"" they serve. 

Most of my meal went to waste after picking out the few small pieces of chicken to eat. 

They give a big portion but is not really a big portion as is a small amount of the main course laid on top of a bed of bad rice.",hv_M1Kf1EPWDBB1bgnzu6Q,3,2,1,scaQSf2qVqWw4_k8GfQiYg

I had the Chicken Teriyaki bowl. I'm seriously not trying to be stereo-typical here, I'm being dead serious when I say I don't think the chicken was actually chicken. It didn't look like chicken, wrong texture, wrong taste, everything. Dunno what it was, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't chicken (Maybe pork with the skin still on? Not sure.). The veggies and rice were good. I picked out all the bamboo shoots because I'm just not a fan. The rice was actually really flavorful, almost more like a Jasmine type of rice. it was a little dry when it was freshly cooked, but was still pretty good as leftovers today.

The crab rangoons were absolutely wonderful and the egg rolls were pretty good. Both of these are what kept this from being a 1 star review. The price and portion size is what gave it the 3rd star.

The building is really super cute, with a drive-thru which is convenient.

Customer service was crap. I'm going to just be brutally honest about the lady working. I drove up, she had our order ready already, which was the one good thing. On the phone we had told her we had a coupon for the crab rangoons and she just said, ""I don't care, just show me the coupon when you get here."" So that's what I did. Well, she got all pissy when I mentioned the coupon and said with a LOT of attitude, ""Why didn't you tell me that before???"" I mean, it was really mean the way she said it. And I tried to nicely tell her we did tell her about it (I even apologized even though I know it wasn't my fault), but she wasn't having it. She was going to be right no matter what, I guess.  I tipped her to try and avoid getting the rangoons spit in (she made them fresh right then). So hopefully there was no bodily fluids anywhere. I guess we will never know. We also did not get any sauce, napkins, or eating utensils.

Anyway, my coworkers got completely different food than I, so I can't speak for them about the taste of their food, other than to say that all 3 of us had bubble guts after eating our food. We spent the next few hours taking turns in the restroom.

And the cherry on top... worst fortunes ever. Like, I'm talking about the kind with sentences that don't even make sense. But the cookies tasted like regular fortune cookies and weren't stale, so that's good.

Not much else I can say about the place. I won't be eating there again, but at least I tried something new!",vPsI1RB4XGcHHlgQej5nAg,2,0,3,LiRzdBVrGd8KJUpgbxR7Hw

So this is what ""New York Style"" chinese food taste like.  Umm no, not impressed at all, i would say this is the equivalent to CHINA STAR BUFFET.  If this is what New Yorker's are calling chinese food i feel sorry for them.  They are really missing out on some good eats, so sad.

Ok, .so i ordered GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN w/ fried rice and eggroll...never again

- GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN: the chicken in this dish should be so tender that you can cut it w/ a plastic fork. u need a STEAK KNIFE, super tough and chewy. Total buffet style chicken (a CHEAP buffet)  And where was my spice, usually i get a red pepper or two in the dish...nothing. i should of asked for the sarrachi to spice up the meal.  (is that the correct spelling? sar-ra-chi...you know what i'm talking about)

- FRIED RICE: nothing special, bland, flavorless, loaded w/ chunks of brown onion

- EGGROLL: ""Costco's Quality"" frozen eggrolls deep fried to order/

QUANTITY: you get what you pay for, huge portion

QUALITY: WAY overpriced for buffet style chinese food (cheap buffet)...oops i meant NEW YORK style chinese food.

Back in the late 90's in San Diego all the express chinese food places started popping up all over the city.  no restaurant name, all it said on the store front was $0.99 Chinese Food....i've had better quality food at the $0.99 chinese restaurant than this place.

The chicken wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, it seemed like it was made fresh and then sat a while before being heated and stirred up to throw in the bowl. The ribs were a little tough but only barely, and the sauce was more than tasty enough to redeem them. My biggest complaint however, is the absurd amount of soy sauce included when I hate it and did not ask for any..... I order 1 rice bowl item which I can understand some people will use soy sauce for, so I would expect 2-3 soy sauce packets max. Instead, I get 24 packets, and in addition, I get 7 of those small plastic cups with lids full of soy sauce.... WHY!??!? Just putting them off to the side on my desk to get to my food, I notice later that the cups were not closed properly, causing a rather large puddle to form, which leaked down my desk and into my computer which is now dead.
