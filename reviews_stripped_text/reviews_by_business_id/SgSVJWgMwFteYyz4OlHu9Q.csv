A few place come almost close but not like Bambinos. This is NY Pizza. It is PERFECT. Thin, sauce is yummy & not stingy with cheese. 

Just waking in the door is a happy experience. The smell, the NY accent & then the longest 2 minutes of your life waiting for your slice to come out of the oven. OMG I died a thousand deaths waiting for that first slice. It was perfect. Exactly what I had been missing for all these years. Felt like I was back home. Later that evening had to order a pie for the family. This is now a weekly event. 

Oh and the other food is great too but I only want pizza. The hot sandwiches are stuffed full, the grandma pie is outrageously good as are the garlic knots.

The guys are great, personable & funny. The shop is spotlessly clean. Did I mention how yummy the smell is? And how the pizza somehow can transport you to your happy place..

Just go there now & get a slice. I guarantee you will be buying a pie & more before the end of the day.",FCdZGj4CccoeSuLFD3qErw,4,0,5,EoOc29jdGetqafYv0EXB1w

I had the baked clams with herbed bread crumbs, sautéed spinach, chicken francese, fettuccine alfredo, and cannoli.  The baked clams were tender, not over cooked, with their clam juice, and the herbed bread crumbs complimented the clams nicely, just a squeeze of lemon made it on point.  The sautéed spinach was chopped and cooked soft with burnt garlic, if you are a garlic fan you would enjoy this dish.  The Chicken francese dish had tender chicken with a bright acidic white wine sauce and spaghetti, I have an affinity for acidity and this dish more than satisfied my pH-of-less-than-7 palette.  Solid, solid fettuccine alfredo and they have a strong, like Mr. Olympia-strong, cannoli game.

We were craving pizza on a Monday night and decided to check out Bambino's after a friend recommended going there and verifying good reviews on Yelp.  We arrived an hour before closing but the owner and staff were so welcoming, and we knew it would be good since it was still fairly busy.  As per Yelp reviews, we decided to try the white pizza (usually my favorite), 'grandma's pizza, garlic knots and the cannoli.  The garlic knots came first: piping hot, crunchy on the outside and chewy soft inside. Make sure to dip it in the extra garlic butter sauce in the bottom of the plate and the sauce that comes with it. Then comes the white pizza: amazing flavor, simple white pizza yet complex and delicious in flavor! White pizza is usually my favorite order, but from the other Yelp reviews, we also decided to order 'grandma's pizza. WOW. Everyone is right. You HAVE to try it. Simple yet savory, slightly sweet sauce, perfect blend of cheese. Then comes the cannoli. I'll be honest, my hubby loves cannoli but it's usually not my favorite. This was the BEST cannoli I've had (and I've even eaten them while in New York!). Not only was the food delicious, the staff and people were fantastic! Such wonderful characters (most of the 'regulars' we met were from Staton Island, Long Island, etc). We were saying this place needs to be on Food Network-it was that good!

Service was excellent. 
We ordered two dinners. I ordered the chicken parmigiana. It is the first place that I have been to in Las Vegas, that matches what I always had in NY. 
My husband ordered the seafood pescatore. They were kind enough to make it with a garlic and oil sauce for him. It was a large platter of fresh seafood. 
The chef asked us how everything was and we could honestly say it was great. After speaking with him a few minutes we learned he is from Long Island, as I am as well. He told us it is all family working there.

1770532,2013-07-21,1,SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q,"The entire pizza experience is determined by what manner you choose to eat your pizza.  A lively topic of conversation ensued on our UYE about proper technique.  Turns out Loren F. and I are the fork and knife users.  Antonio preferred the folded pizza and eating it by hand technique.  Seems the rest of the table preferred the pick it up and eat it without folding it technique. 

There's nothing better to go with pizza than good company.  Michele H. was kind enough to prepare a large table for our group complete with appetizers and a little table for the kiddos to work on their coloring projects.

To the pizza itself, I ordered two slices of the vegetarian.  I posted those pictures for your review.  I believe I am correct in that this would be equivalent to four pieces of pizza anywhere else.  I was very happy with the taste of my pizza, the ratio of sauce to veggies was just right and the individual tastes of the vegetables really popped in my mouth.  I couldn't finish my two slices so I ended up sharing it with Loren F. and Skyler and LJ.  

As far as the atmosphere goes, it was like a cute side street pizzeria you might expect to find in ""Bowston"".  I appreciated the themed pictures, jerseys, Red Sox paraphanelia.  I don't get the large Citgo sign next to the drink machine, seems to detract from the rest of the memorabilia.  

I did look over at Marie T. dabbing the grease off the pepperoni and cheese.  That was a big negative to me.  From what I have been taught, the better meats and cheeses don't pool grease on the top of the pizza when cooked so that was a negative to me. That's the reason for my rating.

All in all, though I think everyone enjoyed their meal and the fried dough was very popular.  I decided to stay away from the garlic knots, fried dough but did indulge in a few fries.  The service was very attentive and I believe we were all happy about that.

Garlic Knots ($3) - 6 jumbo buttery garlic knots almost the size of my fist (though I do have kind of small hands, hehe) with lots of marinara sauce - YUM!!!

Chicken Wings ($6) - 10 large breaded chicken wings tossed in your choice of sauce.  These were awesome and at only $6 for 10 wings, a nice deal!

16"" Large Meatball Pizza ($13.50) - This is a BIG pizza for a pretty good price; great sauce, crust, cheese... definitely skimpy on the toppings though; I would've expected double the amount of meatballs :(

Been to NY three times and NJ once and this pizza tastes as close as I've found to east coast pizza

We've been looking for a place to replace our love of grazianos... Which closed but this place won't do it. It's in a delicious category of its own. 

The wings were great. Crispy and tender, not too much sauce. Good sized ranch came with it too. Not skimpy. Fries were limp, almost soggy which were still good but a little disappointing. Good sized but it should be for three bucks. Pizza was large and good, true east coast pizza here, the type that's thing crusted, extra cheesy, flimsy, fold in half, greasy goodness.

Love that they cook the pizza in brick ovens. They just taste different. Impressed she said it would be delivered in 45 to 60 mins and it actually came in 35. Awesome!",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,7,3,4,27vwH9aNDpDSm4EA98i1vA

The chicken wings were very flavorful too. We also had chicken parmigiana, baked ziti, chicken francese, and a pizza. All very delicious and again ample portions. You will bring home leftovers. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.

Since my move here in November, in the Summerlin/Spring Valley area, I have NOT found a pizza place that was actually good. This sentiment is shared by my husband who is from New York. And I'm not much of a food snob, pizza generally makes me happy. But....i had yet to eat pizza that has enough crunch throughout the crust, good sauce, and lots of oily cheese. Many pizzas I have tried have a tinny taste or used frozen ingredients bc i could taste the freezer burn flavor. I just have not yet found ""good"" pizza in Vegas that is reasonably priced. That is, until I visited Bambino's on Saturday 3/11/17. I searched ""Pizza Restaurants"" here on Yelp and the reviews by New Yorkers, lured me in. It's a small hole in the wall pizza shop. They have a variety of pizzas. We had the Meat Lovers & Pizza Bianca. At first bite of the Meat Lovers pizza, i immediately noticed how good the sauce  was. Usually,  pizza sauce doesn't do anything for me. But the fact that I did get impressed by pizza sauce alone,  meant something. The dough was thin and crispy. There was so much cheese that it was separating from the crust and toppings were sliding off when i folded the slice in half. This pizza was EXACTLY what I have been searching for in Las Vegas. The crust had the perfect burn marks (not blackened,  but brown and toasty) which tasted amazing!!!!  The Bianca was delicious too, with pure garlic, mozzarella cheese and Ricotta balls. I am so happy that the Yelp community pointed me here. This is now our designated pizza shop.

The pizza is a good balance of thin crust, sauce and cheese.  It was a good pizza where folding was perfect.  They gave us cheese sticks, garlic knots and fries before the food came. The cheese sticks were a big hit with my daughter who usually won't eat much.  The zeppoli's were also a hit as she loved them and they are small enough you can have more than one.  The powdered sugar that covered them was an added bonus for her! lol....... the cannolis were really good with the perfect balance as well.

I have to admit this was a little far for me, but I don't mind driving for the good food and even better company. I drove by this place numerous times when I lived on this side of town. Now I regret passing it because I missed out on some delish pizza. 

Upon waking in, it's a cute little place with about 10 tables. It's clean and the walls are decorated with numerous sports teams memorabilia. Michele and a few other yelpers already had a few tables put together for the event with some appetizers on the table for us to try. There were fries, mozzerella sticks and garlic knots. We arrived an hour later so they were already cold. I did try the garlic knots. Good buttery garlicky flavor. I imagine these would be fantastic if they were hot and fresh. 

I ordered the #1 lunch combo which came with 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5. It was 50 cents per additional topping so I added pepperoni and garlic. My friend had the #2 lunch combo which came with one slice of cheese pizza, a salad and a drink for $6. He opted for his pizza as Hawaiian which was $1 extra I believe. Our food was delish!! The salad was bright, colorful and fresh. Nice crunch to the lettuce and the Italian dressing was just perfect. The pizza was also delish!!! Thin crust NY style, which I'm not a huge fan of, but this was amazing. My 2 slices of garlic/pepperoni were huge! It was greasy so I had to tab some of it off with a napkin. No biggie. I loved how they chopped up the garlic and spread it throughout the 2 slices instead of huge chunks here and there. And there was plenty of pepperoni on there as well. I'm not a huge fan of Hawaiian but my date said it was yummy. Lisa G. ordered the vegetarian pizza which looked yummy as well. Colorful and packed with veggies. I would have tried it if I wasn't so full. 

Towards the end, the owners brought us fried dough covered in butter and powdered sugar. I pretty much ate the entire basket and had to move them away from me. Loren and I did have a mild choking incident when we both inhaled the powdered sugar on accident. Good times. The owners were very friendly and were very easygoing.

2834207,2016-12-19,1,SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q,"Visit on 12/18/16:

I'm not an Italian from New York, or Italian at all for that matter. However, the owners and employees are, and one of the diners that we talked to is yet another New York Italian, complete with the accent. He said that while there are many pizzerias around the city, this is the best and closest to New York-style pizza and serves food that tastes like it came from Little Italy. We also asked him about his dish, which was custom-made. So it seems they will customize dishes for the regulars.

That was his experience, or more like one of many. Ours started with an order of garlic knots and ended with a huge heaping plate of Bolognese spaghetti.

Garlic knots: fluffy, chewy, definitely not anorexic in size, and bursting with butter and garlic bits. Yes, if they claim to be garlic knots, shouldn't they have garlic? Yes, well, I've had the cheap kind at other places that have just some garlic powder baked into them. They come in a small and large order, but I recommend that you get a large order and take home whatever you can't finish. It's that good.

Bolognese spaghetti: house-made sauce with huge portions. My boyfriend and I had trouble finishing a large order. It is big enough for you to share with a friend or possibly two, depending on how much you eat. If you are a teenage boy, you can probably eat a whole order yourself and still have room for a large order of garlic knots and cannolli.

Prices are very good. They are about the same as casual Italian on the Strip, however, the portion size is HUGE and a lot bigger than what you'll get elsewhere. Very good deal. Service was prompt and friendly. Plus it was nice to hear the customers and employees talking to each other about the weather in New York and about cars. Nice ambience.

Yes, it's quite a ways off the Strip, but well worth it. Get over there already!",Xeiog4urs3gv8lj06Eh9mg,1,1,5,b2dUFLLi9755E06MFLpbhA

Order grandma pie with pepperoni, told to wait 25 minute to pick up. Arrived after 17 minute because I walked there and got there earlier. It was sitting in a box on their cool rack so I was confused but continued home. 

My friends and I all too a slice realizing it was extremely greasy.  I know with peporoni it's gonna be greasy but hot oil was getting all over our hands it was really gross. I bit into the pizza and it was just doughy. Not fully cooked. 

I called them to see what they can do to fix it. Since I had 5 friends over and we each took a slice they wouldn't just get me a new one next time or refund my order. I used to come here a lot. But unfortunate this was the last straw came, spent 20 dollars for semi raw dough with cheese and oil.

Staff was busy serving pizzas left & right.  I watched as they served the tables & it smelled anazing.  Our order want ready for another 8 minutes which I'm cool with as long as it's good pizza. Total came to $18.12.

The ride home seemed like forever & when we got home all 3 of us said it was the best greasy pizza ever out here.  Being from Rhode Island we all miss the pizza, this hit the spot.

Bambinos which is conveniently located near my place of employment really shined when I went to lunch and had a slice. The pizza crust was crispy and golden, the cheese was stringy and delicious and it produced just the right amount of oil when doing the original NY pizza fold. Of Corse its not exactly NY pizza because this is Las Vegas but its one of the best I have tried here and I am a constant returning customer. You may notice the 4 star rating rather than 5, this is not due to the quality of their food its actually referring to their customer service. How I am treated when I go somewhere is important and adds to the whole dining experience. I have been to Bambinos several times and every time I am there I am not greeted by any employee, the individuals standing behind the counter all look kind of miserable and unhappy and don't seem to really interact with their clientele.

The joint is decked out in Boston photos and memorabilia.....be prepared to get a talking to if you walk in here with other sports teams gear.  A guy with a Lakers hat was catching some guff from the owner.  It was all in good fun and they were both having fun talking a bit of trash about the other team.  Hilarious.

After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It's a thin Crust variety, very similar to NY Style.  I'm not calling it NY Style because it's a Boston Pizza joint.  The slices are pretty big and you have to fold it if you want to eat it with your hands.....I like it better that way.  The Pizza was pretty good....above average.  I thought the Sausage was much better than the Pepperoni.  The Pepperoni wasn't anything special.  The Cheese was gooey and had good flavor.  I didn't have to add anything to the Pizza, I enjoyed it as is.

Located on the west side of Vegas it's a short drive to the small but popular eatery.  I called my order in and advised them when I would be arriving.

Once arriving and not having any issue parking, we wewre seared at a table by the friendly male employees and started us with the half order of antipasto salad and put white pizza in the oven. The salad was large and had the whole kitchen of ingredients that made the salad outstanding . Timing was perfect of receiving the pizza which was rich tasting and delicious.

We went to Bambino's not knowing what to expect and with open minds.  We are pizza lovers and are always looking for the next awesome slice to experience.  What we found was a fun Boston Pizzeria.  This means lots of Red Sox stuff and super yummy thin crust pizza.  It's a great time to be had!

Let me just say, the Meat Lovers pizza from Bambino's blew our minds and we ate THE WHOLE THING in under 10 minutes.  10 minutes!!!!  I don't think we even stopped to take a breath between bites because it was so tasty!  We inhaled the awesome pizza because it was simply amazing.  It had flavorful pepperoni, ham, and some of the best sausage I have ever had, EVER!

We also tried some yummy garlic knots, cheese sticks, chicken fingers (yes, I steal my baby girl's chicken fingers when she isn't looking), and fries. Oh and the zeppoles!  I have never had a zeppole and didn't know what to expect.  They are Italian style donuts and are one of the best things I have ever eaten dessert-wise.  They were hot fried dough, covered in powdered sugar and other fun spices and were finger licking good!  Everything we tried was delicious, came in a huge serving, and at a very good price.  How can you go wrong?

It is a small joint, but it feels super homey.  The staff was always coming out to talk to us and make sure we were happy.  There was a lovely young lady, Stephanie, who was awesome!  I think she was about 13 and was on top of everyone in the restaurant.  She was running the counter and taking food orders, as well as being the welcoming committee.  She would even come out to play with my daughter from time to time, just to make sure she was enjoying lunch too!   It is a great mom & pop place and you feel so welcomed just walking in the door.  I wish Vegas had more places like this one!

4233961,2017-10-29,2,SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q,"My cousin and I came to Bambinos after a strenuous hike out at Red Rock. We worked up a serious appetite and yelped the yummiest mom and pop pizza joint near us. Bambinos caught our eye so we set out for our highly anticipated pie. It was easy to find tucked into a shopping strip of sorts. We were greeted immediately and handed menus at the counter that you order at. We decided on a Cesar salad and a large grandmas pie. We sat down and the waitress brought markers out for my daughter. As a momma, I always appreciate kind gestures like these. 

Our small Cesar salad came out quickly and we were both happy with the size of it. (A small is large enough for two people to split) They brought out a  warm loaf of French bread shortly after. I indulged and grabbed a bottle of olive oil from the condiment/ utensil hutch and made a nice mixture of olive oil, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. We dipped our warm French bread in the olive oil and it was heavenly. 
**What? We earned it on our hike, remember??? **

As we were finishing off our salad, the pie came out! Perfect timing! The crust was the perfect combination of crunchy yet doughey. With each bite there was crispy crunch, but you still have to pull a bit to tear the bread. (This is my favorite type of crust y'all) The cheese used for this pizza HAS to be some kind of specialty or imported cheese because it was so tasty. Lastly the sauce. A pizza is nothing with out sauce and I'll be the first to say their sauce was magnificent. 

Needless to say, We ate way to much. What we had left over we decided to bring to my husbands office so that  we could share the deliciousness we had just experienced. (It would have been horribly selfish to have kept it all for myself- although I deeply considered it.) 

Walking through his office felt like the cha cha train you'd do at a wedding. With every turn we had more of my husbands colleagues behind us following the incredible aroma of the pizza. By the time I got to my husbands office- most of his co workers were popping in asking where the pizza came from! Don't worry, I encouraged him to share. 

The ONLY thing I saw that I didn't LOVE, was the table next to us ordered a big beautiful pepperoni pizza. When it came out I was drooling over the smell. I personally don't eat meat so that should tell YOU something. The gentleman that ordered the pie called over my attention as he preformed an almost professional cheese pull. It was glorious. BUT than came the grease. SO MUCH GREASE. There was a puddle under the slice. That was concerning but I asked him how it tasted? He raved about how yummy his slice was while the rest of his table continued to moan with each bite. So I made the assumption that the grease didn't effect the integrity of the crust. 

Anyways- we can't wait to go back. Would love to see an arugula option for on top of the grandma pie!  It was absolutely delicious. We had a great time, wonderful service, quality ingredients, and speedy service. Great mom and pop joint!",nDynpOP644nCR9CPYz6ecQ,2,1,5,d7KF6imU-_ILRMd-FdsbOg

We discovered this GEM about a year ago and have referred so many people here that are from New York City, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island even up state and the result is always the same, it's delicious. :)
We started with a regular slice of pizza, then got hooked on the Grandma for a while, and ventured into the dinners, the Stromboli's are delicious, my favorite is the chicken parmigiana one, we do however like the previous version of the garlic knots, they changed and eh- the other ones were bigger and a lot more flavor-able. 
We really enjoyed the baked ziti, the ravioli, spaghetti with garlic and oil, and my husband likes the hero sandwiches and the bread is delicious, so my review is hurry up and go!

We kinda took over the place and were a little loud, but that's because we were having such a good time and stuffing our faces on what turned out to be great food.  Since we all ordered what we wanted but ended up sharing, there was a big assortment of items to try.  

Three friend and I shared a white pizza, which was scrumptious, and a large salad that, thankfully, was romaine and not iceberg, which had a very good ranch dressing that we had on the side.  There were other dressings to choose from.

We also got to sample the garlic knots, veggie pizza, and the calzone.  Everything was terrific, but the calzone was extra wonderful!  

What I love most about Bambino's pizza is that the crust is not overly salty; so many other pizza joints drown their crusts in salt.  This one was perfect, and crispy, just the way I love it.  The white pizza had just the right amount of chopped garlic, creamy ricotta, and extra seasonings that bumped it up several notches in flavor.

These guys are very nice, greeted us upon arrival, didn't charge us for last minute extra sauce and offered to serve the garlic knots before receiving our to-go pizza.

* Cleanliness: 5/5
The restaurant was VERY CLEAN. Both the kitchen and tables were spotless.

* Food and portion size: 4/5
We ordered a large half pepperoni and half Hawaiian with extra sauce. The pizza hardly had any sauce, cheese was average, but wasn't greasy and the crust was GREAT (cooked in a brick oven, fresh taste, not too thin and not too thick). But the pepperoni portion was VERY SALTY. I am assuming it was salty because of the pepperoni because the Hawaiian was PERFECT. 

As for the garlic knots, they were GREAT! Nice soft bread with just the right amount of garlic and butter. The marinara sauce used for dipping was excellent (very fresh and tasted original). 

Portion sizes were perfect for two-four people.

* Atmosphere, room capacity, and menu size: 4/5
Restaurant is conveniently located next to a 7/11 in the newer looking plaza. The interior is up-to-date and casual. It's a good size restaurant with a simple menu.

Price was perfect for a large with four toppings ($16.00).

The pizza was soggy and super greasy. I couldn't even pick a piece up without the toppings falling off and the crust was the only crispy part about it. The zucchini sticks were probable the best part but the sauce was spilled upside down in the bag therefore making it quite messy to eat.

First off we have ordered take out from here one time before and loved the meatball calzone and chicken parm sub.  Today we actually came in and sat down for one of their lunch specials.  Normally we do all our takeout from 2 places close to home.  Villa Pizza being one of them.  This place has great food and great service!  While Villa tastes good their service leaves a lot to be desired (in my opinion).

We arrived just as they were opening and received a welcome hello from the guy behind the counter.  We ordered my personal favorite of Chicken Francese.  It's served with a beverage, garlic knots and a side of pasta all for $9.  Not to shabby considering how much food you get.  Everything tasted great and exactly as one would expect.  They offer fresh parmesan cheese, none of that stuff in packets.  There is a soda fountain so you can refill your glass as often as you like.

Living in Boston and being the daughter of Italian chef, I would eat pizza about twice a week before I moved to Las Vegas. I love pizza. I love everything about it. When I moved to Las Vegas about 10 months ago, one of my first missions was to find a local pizza place. Well let me tell you... this is NO JOKE or exaggeration.. i ate pizza every day for about 2-3 weeks, trying all different places in the Las Vegas Valley. (Even tried some in California) There is no debate: West Coat just does not make pizza like east coast. All you West Coasters will beg to differ, but that's because you have nothing to compare it to. 
Bambino's East Coast Pizzeria is by FAR the best pizza in Las Vegas. Those who claim the pizza is ""too greasy"" obviously have never eaten at an authentic pizza joint on the east coast. I actually found it funny when people comment about the grease.. that's actually how i knew i needed to try this place! 
The pizza was perfect.. sooooo cheesy it just ooozed and would come out in long strings whenever i bit into it! man i havent found anywhere in vegas like this yet!

Trust an opinion from me, an Italian chef's daughter who grew up in Boston for 27 years.. this is THE ONLY PLACE TO GO FOR PIZZA IF YOU ARE FROM THE EAST COAST",Ry6ij_Frk9UuQ8t2vaVkAA,6,2,5,P0BZkH8vevMZE4HdCQhpXQ

Ok so my go to is their cheese pizza. The amount of cheese is out of bounds , the dough of the pizza is perfect it's just a great pie. 

I've had their supreme and wasn't thrilled it was over burden with sautéed veggies that weighed the pizza down and made it soggy so I basically couldn't eat it. I for and knifed it and I love love love veggies and I'd love for this place to make a pizza with just fresh toppings nothing cooked all ready because I like my veggies a bit al Dente. 

Regardless of that supreme pie flop it was will tasty. 

Well today I got my daughter and her friends a large cheese pie as this is their new fav pizza and I see this slice and it looks so inviting and hearty and I say hey what's that the nice lady with the shirt brunette hair replies ""Lasagna pizza"" I immediately go I want one now  I love lasagna so how could this be bad right??

Right ! It was amazing the velvety ricotta that blanked out the salty lasagna meats and sauce that was just folded perfectly over this dough I was in heaven I took one bite and said omg I have to text this to someone and showed friends and now here I am writing a review while finishing this pizza slice of life ! 

I think people love this place because of the amount of toppings but I suggest you make two pizza options light or heavy ! Have two price brackets and those who want heavy on the toppings can pay heavy prices and hose who like a nice balance can pay a bit less. 

Just my opinion. Anyhow this is Jen of my top 3 fav pizza spots in Las Vegas. 

The people are spectacular. I will say before there were some young ladies one with short blonde hair the other I've cast out of my memory and no matter how many hi's or pleasantries I sent to them they were never receptive , pleasant or responsive. Their customer service was horrid but now I see two older ladies as the other two probably early 18-22 well these two new ladies are heaven ! 

They are so sweet pleasant and kind. It makes all the difference it balances out the smart ass ways of the men in the kitchen and I'm sure those ladies can hold their own but what they give out to the world and their customers is genuine kindness and consideration and I appreciate it and thank them! Very tip worthy those two I'll have to find out their names ! 

Anyhow can't wait to see what I try next as I'm eager to venture into their pastas since this lasagna pizza has that traditional authentic lasagna flavor you want to taste. No spins ... no twists ... just traditional lasagna flavors on a pizza. A lovely meat sauce , cheeses and doses of ricotta on top.  So wondrous everyone should try it $4 a slice and I'm so full I can't breathe !


Oh and as to the Authenticity of this being a True New York Pizza I can't say because I am not a native of New York but I can say by my encounters with their clients I would say it is Def an authentic NYC style pizza !

Plenty of left over as well as they were very generous. The gal that waited on us was very nice as well as the rest of the staff. My daughter thinking that she cooked the pizza looks at me and goes ""Mommy that girl bakes a good pizza""..lol. I believe I read that they do a lunch time pizza special with two slices and a soda and that seemed to be a huge hit. It was a chill place and I thought it was cute the older couples coming in for the special and chatting with the staff. You could tell they were regulars and the staff interaction was just cute. Would definitely recommend it really did remind me of back East!",ZhoGqwq3wFvJZsLnzz2bLA,0,0,5,59hf9ny0WGFkS_ksIpHsPw

Good ingredients not to greasy thin crust the way it should be like back east. Just a touch of crispyness. I would give it five but my only complaint was the ingredients wanted to slide off. Now that is not a complaint because they were not cheap when it came to toppings. Probably had a touch to much sauce but the sauce was tasty n I am not a big pizza sauce guy. Good work guys and I'll be back. N if you haven't tried it support your local joints and try it. U won't be disappointed.",4T5QVpJD7bKmhu_sjw3qbw,0,0,4,PDem1JjJAHLPp4FEfcRi6Q

5795841,2016-02-29,0,SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q,"Came here on a recommendation from a buddy after a Facebook debate on Vegas' best pizza.  Am I glad I did.  I'm a big fan of Metro and Rocco's for their NY style, but this is as authentic NY as you'll get.  

I wanna thank Metro's for their years of service to my stomach, but I found a new spot now.  Their tomato sauce is so good.  It's not too acidic but just enough to remind you that you're having tomatoes, not apples.  The mozzarella was rich so you got that famous string that stretches when you bite into it.  Don't think it's just ""heat"" that does that.  It's also the ingredients in it.  

On the way out, they even gave me a slice (on the house) of this round deep dish pizza.  I was thrown off.  I never ate a deep dish back in NY.  When I bit into it, it wasn't dense like these Chicago pizzas.  It had the fluffiness that a Sicilian slice has.  I friggin' loved it and can't wait to thank them when I return.  

If you're also yearning for that NY slice and have also been asleep on this gem, go now.",FH3GgmOeAgXST37jG1-uWg,5,0,5,0BeVaGpbIbSWPxzLfBMErQ
5797814,2015-11-11,0,SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q,"Absolutely astonished with this place! The food was incredible, and very well priced. Staff was very generous and helpful with my questions. The pizza is excellent no matter the type, or toppings you decide to throw onto it. The family at Bambinos came from New York, and you can really tell! I'm from New York myself, and even THERE it's hard to match what the owner produces. I've also read some other reviews on here which were completely false! When I mentioned prices being well, I meant it! Someone was claiming that pizza and wings was over 50$ which is outrageous and false! People also said that there are no specials, which is why I ask this one question: Have you even been to this restaurant? There's always specials available for pizza and chicken! I've rambled on enough here folks, now it's up to you to decide, and eat some of this fine food for yourselves. I know one thing, my family and I will be visiting this place weekly from here on! P.S. : Don't always listen to the negatives, especially when there's very little. Some people just get upset because they have nothing better to do but cause waves of negativity. Be open minded, and if you're in the area, YOU be the judge.",pAQfxke2HMp6tOkZSAEqFg,0,0,5,GFKOEqTKfoa-els_v05TOw

If pizza is an option then this place should be the top of the list. The place is closed on Monday. The lunch deal is so good $5 for a slice and a drink! Can't beat it!

I like their very flavorful cheese slices and the special is a real deal. Last visit I added  Italian sausage and really liked that too. My wife enjoyed their Caesar salad with grilled chicken and some of my friends have tried the pasta and been pleased.
The service has usually been good and the atmosphere is typical strip mall storefront ambience but it is clean and nicely decorated. Worth a look for lunch or a casual dinner.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,1,0,4,rzKi8M1g-cUOzdt7v-Mb5w
5876194,2018-01-26,10,SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q,"This was a solid A-OK experience. 

My man friend's poppa was in town and is a big fan of Sicilian style pizza. Heard great things via many of my Yelp friend's reviews about this place so I made the drive across town. Don't let my 3-stars fool you into thinking this wasn't a good experience. It was good, just not great. 

They were super busy at the counter when I walked in so I snagged a table in the back corner near the window. The young gentleman taking our order was new and a bit nervous. We ordered the Sicilian and added pepperoni as well as the Antipasto salad. The poor kid seemed really unsure when he walked away with our order. Our salad came and it was pretty tasty. Loaded with meats, cheeses, and olives - it was plenty for three of us to share as a starter. We opted for the Italian dressing and I was a fan. Next thing you know a large round pepperoni pizza shows up at our table. It looked delicious but it's not what we ordered.

Unfortunately, he thought we had ordered two pizzas. One large pepperoni and one Sicilian as is. I watched with sadness as the pepperoni pizza was taken back to the kitchen. Another gal came over to verify that we only wanted one pizza - Sicilian with pepperoni - and to apologize because the other employee was new. It was an honest mistake and it was all fine. The Sicilian pizza came out soon after and the crust was perfectly crispy and buttery. Super cheesy and the sauce was quite good. Not as sweet as other Sicilian style pizzas I've had, but a solid 4-stars.Unfortunately, the pepperoni was added last minute due to the ordering snafu so it wasn't crispy at all, but that's okay!

I will definitely be visiting this place again because the staff was super nice and the food was great. They did start closing 30 minutes early so I felt a bit rushed to get out once they started putting the chairs on the tables but the experience overall was very pleasant. I mean, it's pizza! And pizza is always a good time.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,23,12,3,GdLd8Sen9hoS0iCS7SCALg

5934504,2017-08-15,0,SgSVJWgMwFteYyz4OlHu9Q,"I feel I have to start with a disclaimer. My sister is a waitress here but that didn't influence my opinion of the food. This was my first time eating at Bambino's and I know I'll be back as often as I can. I started with an order of chicken wings (plain) with ranch dressing on the side. They are among the best wings I've ever eaten. I'm not sure what they do to them but they're crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside -- just the way a wing ought to be. The ranch dressing is made in-house and, again, is some of the best I've had. There's a major difference in taste between homemade and the dressings some places buy in bulk and serve on their salads and with their wings. I also ordered a medium sausage pizza. I know some people think it's a minus when the pizza comes out of the kitchen with that little pool of grease on top and they grab napkins and mop it up. Nope, that's the sign of a tasty pizza! The crust is crispy yet soft enough to fold for that NY method of eating pizza. The toppings are generous and, judging by the taste, seem to be top quality. I took more than half of the pizza home and can tell you that it even tastes good reheated in the oven. I can't wait to go back for more of those wings!",E95rnaSlscaxghXM62afpg,1,0,5,MzrOp75c5lrkvNoPHd9n4Q
