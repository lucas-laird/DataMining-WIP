The only other things I 've tried here are the calzones and the chicken wings. Skip the chicken wings cause they was small as hell. Maybe they was pigeon wings or something.

The staff is not that friendly and when you order delivery most likely any special directions you give them will be ignored. 

Other than that, I recommend getting a large cheese pie to go. Would not recommend anything else. You won't be dissapointed - in the pizza - and that is the most important thing right?!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,1,2,3,P06T__Oa00Z1WN1H5kAHiA

Did the Bianco, or however they call the white pizza, ricotta cheese, mozz, tomato, which is standard on one side and on the other half we added onion & it was stellar.

Calzone was ON POINT.  Portion to filling rations made mouth happy.  Again great texture on the crust.  

Had some red sauce on the side and it was everything you would expect.

If  I can find one flaw is that we needed to add salt but have to believe the demographic of elderly prevents that sodium be a constant.

While hanging out with my family, we were hungry and my Brother mentioned a pizza place he had heard about and saw there was a coupon offered for 2 Large Cheese Pizza's and 10 Wings for $24.95 so we decided to drive out there and give it a try. Being from the East coast I look forward to trying out different pizza's [seeing it's my Favorite food of all time] and Upper Crust Pizza met my expectation of an 'east coast style' pizza. The crust was cooked perfect, not too hard on the outside and perfect consistency on the inside, not to thin and not too thick...it really was my idea of perfect. The sauce was the right amount and was really very tasty. The cheese was just the right amount and I love cheese, the pizza wasn't overloaded and definitely not shorted on either. I could not stop eating the pizza, nor could the family it was that good, out of the 4 &  1/2 of us we only had 1 piece left. I don't eat wings, however, my Brother and his wife do and they said the wings were ""really good wings"", weeven got the approval from my 20 month old niece who kept eating them and  she even proclaimed ""these are good, Mommy"". The service was friendly and fast, they took the coupon with no problem and offered to make one pizza first and then make the 2nd pizza after the first came out, which was a great idea and the timing was perfect, just as we were taking the last piece off the first pie the second was being placed on the rack. I would highly recommend this pizza place and even to it's a bit of a drive from where I live I will be picking up regularly...hopefully I can control myself and not stop there daily ;-)",qyeQ-ZEvl2CjxC7hmSFLmw,0,2,5,pkyhuYfpG-aCj5b9u-D7og

They didn't have the lasagna I originally wanted and that worked out because I had the eggplant Parmesan instead and loved it. The baked ziti was also good and next time my guy will probably add the sausage. He did think it could use a bit more sauce.  I think that's an American thing and we drown our stuff.  I'm sure you could ask for extra if that's your preference.  I thought it was great especially since its all homemade and fresh. YUM,bjsZPthav8K7sRKGqvX6ug,0,0,4,XOsOYxwHGex1eE1iS0gENQ

So...I decided to try a new pizza joint near my house and you would think Summerlin upper neighborhood I see people going in and out all the time and the place looks decent. How bad can you screw up pizza right? 

Well...let me tell you 

You walk in and place your order and they charge you .50 cents per toppling for pizza by the slice. Once you pay you slide over and watch them make the pizza and they pull out a pre-cooked cardboard crust cheese already melted and begin to add your toppings on...i should have stopped them there and asked for my money back but I didn't want to be rude. 

Once I got home and opened the box I saw uncooked toppings on all the slices on a cardboard crust with cheap crappy cheese. I had to throw it back into the oven at home so i know the pizza was cook and safe to eat.

1st Slice Meatballs uncook,
2nd Slice Ham and the Pineapple look like it just came out of a can...
3rd Pepperoni looked decent but still un-cooked
4th Mushroom and olives....un-cooked and it came out of a salad bar on to my pizza...YUCK

I knew I should have just demanded for my money back but was scared to ask because the Manager was ripping one of her employees a new one right in front of me....I was afraid to ask

I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of food or pizza but I know bad food I really know bad pizza....Isn't it against Yelp policy to write your own reviews? Who ever gave this place 4 to 5 stars is beyond me. 

Little Caesars or Digiorno is 10x better than this place

It is worth driving out of my way, picking up some home made smoked mozzarella and other delicacies at Rocco's than having a greasy, soggy toward the center slice at Upper Crust. Or, going for Weds Chef Marc's fabulosity! 

Perhaps for those that AOk suffices: this will too. For those of us who value our heritage, a rare carb fest and miss NY pizza, Upper Crust does not live up to its name or its competitors.

The thin crust style is fine since it's supposed to be an east coast style pizza, like you see in the Ninja Turtle movies.  Huge slices that you're able to fold up while walking around, catch my drift?  The pizza itself is fine but I think the Calzones are much better. I like the Italian.  But if you were to talk about your flown in dough, would you want that to be the ""center piece"" of your dish?  Make it a little more thick so we can really taste it's authenticity?  The thin crush is good for holding up ingredients and the ingredients itself seems store bought than cut fresh.  The sauce is good and one important factor to a good pizza is the sauce.

Each additional topping on the pizza is $1, $1.50 if the pizza is a large.  If you want to grab a slice of pizza, come in and grab one while you walk around the other stores or on your way to do some grocery shopping.

Then one bite into the mozzarella stick revels a  cheese that was not melted, seriously I could have peeled it off like straight up gas station string cheese.  How can you deep fry something and actually avoid cooking it?  

Then when I called them to complain, they leave me on hold and then start laughing about me calling them.  Stellar managerial skills did you get your  Kellogg MBA from the back of some Frosted Flakes???  

I think my husband orders from them if he is in a pinch for food for the kids, however I declare a moratorium on this lower crust.  Can you put pizza in cement shoes?

I'd probably give it 3 1/2 stars until the grabby owner or manager took the second phone call in front of me while I'm just trying to pay for the pretty-Okay cheese pizza.

Real Pizza in Las Fakass!

I've Iived here off and on for almost 30 years, and one of the most disappointing aspects of my Saturday night is not having a good slice to chow down on. (okay, I'm exaggerating, but go with me here)

I'm no pie snob, but I do know quality when I put it in my mouth, (clears thoat) and most, if not every, local pizza shop in town has the same tired flavor, texture and sauce. And as for the other guys, the big guys, why even bother?!?!

This place has my vote every time. They don't deliver very far, and only have one location, but I would walk 500 miles just to have one of their pies. The crust is perfection and the sauce is sinful. I can not say I have ever been a fan of fried hot wings, but for some reason, the ones served here are boss. And if you dare leave without some of the Fried Dough you should be slapped and sentenced for illegal trespassing.

Don't listen to the naysayers, I'm assuming those people are only use to West Coast cardboard cutout designer pizza. Wolfgang and anybody who ever thought it was a good idea to put barbecue sauce on a pizza pie will burn in the eighth circle of hell for eternity. If you want to know why pizza has been a staple of the American diet for over 100 years, this is the pie you have got to try. As for service, these guys are working in front of a hot oven for Gawd knows how many hours, in a desert!!! I could care less if they smile or even talk to me. As long as they continue to make slices the way they served up mine I'm happy. Its a 5 star pizza joint, not a 5 star restaurant. Lets keep this all in perspective people.",5xGO2SXrxv5_sYDrwXvh2g,2,1,5,1WYjG6Tcs-NNzIprLeEmQA

Sometimes I ask them to cook the pizza a little longer to get a nice crisp crust. 
All around good food from the chicken ceaser salad, to the calzone 

Crust is thin and crispy, but have recieved chewy crusts from here before. The wings are breaded which I know everyone doesn't like but they are good. The calzone is ok.
