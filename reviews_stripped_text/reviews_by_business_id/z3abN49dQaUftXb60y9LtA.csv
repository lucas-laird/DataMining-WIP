Who doesn't like Popeye's?

I like it, I luv it, I want some more of it!  These have got to be the BEST mashed potatoes.....and the Louisiana hott sauce? mmmmmmmmm....

How do they get away with using the name? Isn't it copyrighted or something?",erdvrYG2b-YkTfZljgrXIg,0,0,5,CJyM8oOnjSymJRVgnQz0IQ

I've been a big fan of Popeyes before they opened all these locations and when they were just on the corner of Rancho and Bonanza. I think what makes Popeyes so good is that you can add some heat to the chicken.  I always tend to favor the SPICY chicken strips and of course the cajun mashed potatoes. Anytime I'm feeling sick I always ask for the mashed potatoes. There goes my love for carbs again! Overall, I'm definitely a lucky girl that Popeyes is close enough for anytime I need some spicyness and comfort.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,4,2,5,ZnqZ1gs2H9oSAc7X-0huIg

Aside from that, this is a fine Popeyes location: clean, easily accessible from the beltway, and the service is always prompt and friendly.",c33Z36u5N8h5JgYsnweXlw,0,0,4,HAHmWjLZ5bdhkhVEkMBD_A

My husband loves this place, and could eat chicken daily. As for me, I enjoy the chicken, especially when it's spicy like this place. 

For quick meal pick up, this place is the good choice.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,0,3,K8zQjzg-QMB1y9oW_jTn8Q
