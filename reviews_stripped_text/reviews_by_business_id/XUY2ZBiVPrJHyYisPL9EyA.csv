276013,2013-02-15,0,XUY2ZBiVPrJHyYisPL9EyA,"Wasabi Jane's is a nice alternative to traditional Vegas food.  You would think that since this is in a food court that it couldn't be good.  I beg to differ.  During the convention season, WJ's is good break from your regular catered hotel food, but also from the more expensive establishments around the Venetian.

I know it seems odd to have Wasabi Jane's in the same food court as another chain fast food Chinese restaurant.  Wasabi Jane's has something that the other place doesn't offer - the large bowl of noodle soup.  I have ordered both the beef noodle and seafood udon soup a couple times. Each time they were excellent.  

I would take the seafood noodle over the beef.  They both have good flavor, decent portion, and one important ingredient... vegetables.  When on business, it's sometimes difficult to get a good serving of veggies.  The seafood udon makes up for that.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the seafood udon included calamari, shrimp, fish cake and some small scallops.  So, it is a very good mix.

So the trick here, skip the pre-made items on display.  They make the soup fresh in the back, right when you order it.",Y8soACnXhNO2RUCLDCI8iw,0,0,4,MWFhfoayVsEpBDOzMuvXiA

For $14 I got white rice, noodles, and an entree, plus a drink which to me is pricey for a ""one item combo"". I got a dirty look for requesting rice and noodle, even though the menu photo clearly depicts rice and noodles for the 1-item combo.  

My rice was cold and getting dry, not sticky but crumbly.  Rice should be warm, soft, kind of sticky.

My noodles tastes like liquid smoke. Nothing else. 

My sukiyaki beef was the worst part. The beef was mushy like when you add too much tenderizer, and it was room temperature, not what I would consider a proper serving temperature. The vegetables were so soft I did not even need to bite them, they just kind of mushed in my mouth and slithered down. The dish didn't have much taste but vaguely reminded me of, in texture and taste, the bbq ""rib"" sandwiches available at convenience stores; but this dish was more bland. 

Again, I wasn't expecting much but was very disappointed. I ate maybe a bite of each item and tossed my $14 meal in the garbage. I hope I do not get food poisoning from the few cold bites I stomached.",pNAbD4fnGJgxX4LZglPsCQ,0,0,1,LOqP2xi70JAVUWqK8iZ3Kw

Having two kids in tow, the family doesn't have the luxury to sit through fine dining or extended meals. This was one of the food stands we stopped at for dinner. 
The ordering process was fine, and we asked for one cup of ice water, and they proceeded to charge us 10 cents for the ice water. When inquired what the charge was, they replied ""plastic cup"". For the life of me, I could not locate that ""cup charge"" on their menu anywhere, and that is either false advertising or some type of bad business practice which I will later on report to BBB. 
Their udon noodle was just ok, nothing too outstanding, but that charge left a sour taste in our mouths. 
Oh, and just for your reference, walk 10 steps to the Panda Express in the same food court, and you can get ice waters (yes, plural), extra plates, extra napkins, fortune cookies, and utensils, all for FREE!

What do you do now at the 5 star hotel but you don't have 5 star cash? Get a new job player! Just kidding. Hit the food court. My first choice would is the Deli for sure, but if the casino slots have left you with a few dollars short try Wasabi Jane's Rice & Noodle Works. 

Food court options are limited and I always almost barf in my mouth when I see Panda Express. Sadly, I rather shallow barf than eat there. Just saying. Wasabi is a similar combo asian food place. A lot of greese and fried food for your delight. 

On my last visit to the Venetian food court, I saw a sign for beef noodle soup. I know I was taking a risk trying a random place, but it was worth a shot. The soup was hearty and a little msgy, but overall tasty. It was filling and didn't leave me craving more. Not the best soup but for a cheap shake on budget this was good enough. 

I can't recommend this place, because the quality is okay. If you had enough buffet and you want something tasty and fast, it is worth a try. If you don't fill like getting a sandwich at the deli, concider trying Wasabi's. If you are super picky when it comes to asian food, skip. 

I hope this helps with your decision. Usually no waiting here.

Probably right on par with PE in my book. May give them another try sometime when I'm craving Chinese again at work. I will make sure to sample what I'm getting first though to see if its hot.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,1,2,iMsINZ0RPph10_xIRSRPZg
5208424,2014-07-19,2,XUY2ZBiVPrJHyYisPL9EyA,"Problem: You and your friends decide to celebrate a bachelor's party in Vegas. In keeping with the wedding party in Vegas tradition, you drown yourself in liquor, eventually falling into a drunken stupor. Before you know it, it's morning. You walk to the bathroom and realize one of your lateral incisors is missing. Ignoring the fact that a tiger, an abandoned baby, and a chicken are running around your suite, your stomach demands sustenance. Oh, and you only have 10 bucks.

Solution: Wasabi Jane's

Wasabi Jane's is another typical Asian take-out restaurant. Located within the Venetian food court, and situated across the way from a Panda Express, Wasabi Jane's has your typical selection of Asian food.

I purchased a 3 item combo. You will likely have some leftovers if you order the 3 item combo, even if you split it among 2 people.

I ordered the chow mein, chicken teriyaki, and the beef (I forgot which variety. Oops.) I admit that the noodles were somewhat greasy. The proteins were tasty, though.

The most discerning foodies will not find this place very tasty. For everyone else with a stomach to fill, and a hangover to heal, I'd think you'll be thoroughly pleased.",gAmMQXqGcRZ-gUwTdwHeig,1,1,3,5hxRn4hgwYtwOGJVoTMFvQ

Their tofu was extremely soft and the noodles were flavorful.,oKsBUuCzg8Hb99-regZP6g,0,0,3,KRTr_f9MiOFa7vqaEOvxlA

Overall, pretty good food, resembles that of panda express. Fried rice and sesame chicken were both spectacular. Only down side was the portion sizes (a little small). Great place for a quick lunch, would definitely recommend.",saIh5ShcSeZNN9frEznC2g,1,0,4,4KfOMLHhVpb919cPPpXMpw

I think I'll stick to Chicken Now or the pizza place in this food court from now on.",ffPY_bHX8vLebHu8LBEqfg,0,0,1,qmA76yFDMQppDVccF8ra6g
5834315,2017-09-17,0,XUY2ZBiVPrJHyYisPL9EyA,"This convenient restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. It is on the 2nd floor where all the other ""more affordable"" fast food eateries are located. I cannot really make a long review since this is not a full dine in restaurant. lol BUT the service was great! The guys that worked the food line were really nice! And they recommended the Roasted Duck bowl to me since I told them I love duck! The food was AMAZING! For it to just be a mall eatery restaurant? I was amazed that it was REAL DUCK with the bone! And it was a big bowl with rice and some veggies. It tasted very good. My friends orders the POKE BOWL? which was ok? and someone else ordered the soup which they said was surprisingly good too! The price is around $10-$15 and of course drinks are around $3.99 for a bottle water and other drinks are $3 plus too. lol Its VEGAS! If you want some great asian food in Vegas this is a hidden spot you don't want to miss.",2oj5QU-NrcQGQlWpn89awg,0,0,4,eW9ETIUEen8PmO4jchqSzg

On top of that, the cashier would take order from someone who obviously cut in line instead sending the person to the end of the line. Very disappointing and disgusting.",xiMbjhIoMI2GK94g3yEI1A,0,0,1,o2Sacgur-V9vv6b-zSiLxg
