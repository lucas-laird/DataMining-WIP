18950,2011-05-23,0,T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,"I have long heard about Pink's Hot Dogs being a go-to hot spot late at night for grub and the chance to run into celebrities out in Hollywood but have never had the chance to go.  Thus I was really excited when I saw that Pink's had opened a storefront right on the strip in Vegas.  

After a long night of debauchery, I walked halfway across the strip just so I could eat at Pink's.  I have to give them credit, they sure know how to jazz up a hot dog.  I ordered a spicy Mojave Dog, which is a polish sausage with nacho cheese, guacamole and jalape√±o peppers on it.  I ordered relish on it as well.  

The combination works well in theory as well as in practice.  But in practice all of that stuff on a hot dog makes it damn near impossible to eat as you would normally.  Picking it up makes all the toppings fall off, and a sloppy mess gets all over your hands.  So I had to resort to eating the dog with a fork and knife.  I felt pretty stupid, but it was the only way to do it and plenty of people around me were doing the same.  

But eating like that made the bun soggy, which is not good.  I appreciate the effort they put into dressing up a hot dog, but I only give it three stars because I've had amazing ""gourmet"" hot dogs in Chicago before, with toppings piled high, but with which I could still eat as hot dogs are intended to be eaten - with your hands.",bAzdeuQiR80wVOLUh7ox7g,0,0,3,hhm2-2NGM5igp_6IQJZxFg

The prices though are just a little bit overboard, I think Costco or Sam's Club for $1.50 is probably way better and a medium drink is included!

On the plus side, there are some interesting combinations on the menu, but the execution was so average.  My husband had a chili dog which was mediocre at best- the hot dog had a good snap to it, but the taste wasn't anything to write home about and I've had better hot dogs (Vienna and Koegel's in the Midwest).  I had about 2 bites of my polish (I can't remember the name of it, but it had guacamole, hot peppers, etc. which was fine) and again, was less than impressed with the meat.

I actually really enjoyed the hot dog, which was of an ample size overspilling with toppings. However, at the end of the day, this is still a hot dog and I felt not quite worth the price. Nevertheless, the hot dog was made of good quality meat with none of the processed texture and artificial flavoring as expected from supermarket hot dogs. In addition, the chili that Pink's use for their hot dog taste like legitimate chili of slow-cooked ground beef simmered over low fire in a soup base of onions and other spices. The raw tomatoes threw me off in terms of texture and flavoring, but at the end of the meal, I was glad for it because the bacon, chili, and cheese on the hot dog was actually very heavy for a standalone meal. The turnaround was relatively quick where I never felt like I was just standing around doing nothing, but I would have been more impressed if they actually finished my order before I even walked out the restaurant to find a table.

You order at the counter, wait for your food to come up, and eat outside, overlooking the Strip. There are notices asking people to not feed the birds, and I noticed the birds are a real problem. One actually got on my table and started making moves towards my lunch. I tried to wave it away, and it actually pecked me. O_O So be aware that birds are an issue, particularly if you're alone.

I got a chili cheese dog with mustard and onions and some onion rings. The onion rings were right out of the fryer and good. The chili dog was good. I ate it with a fork--knives didn't seem to be available for some reason?

We started our night grabbing some Fat Tuesdays at the Mirage and doing the usual Vegas Strip exploring. We were walking for some blocks now, and realized that we were smelling some delicious meat from somewhere nearby, funny because we had been having some cravings for Hot Dogs lately. We walk across the street to Planet Hollywood and are trying to figure out where the smell is coming from. Can you tell how buzzed we were at this point?? Lol. Anyways, BEHOLD-- PINKS HOT DOGS right in front of us. YES! We didn't hesitate to order. We both ordered the classic Hot Dog, no toppings, except Ketchup for me, and Mayo for him, and a side order of some fries. We received our food fairly quickly, and the employees were very nice. First thing we noticed was how HUGE these hot dogs were, WITHOUT any extra toppings. We dig in, and DAMN these were SOOOOOO Good!!!! Crunchy sausage, warm bun, SO perfect. The fries were also delicious. That is literally all we wanted to eat the rest of the weekend, and we even swore we'd go back before we flew back home. Sure enough, after a great night at XS, we couldn't wait to go back to PINKS, in fact we went back, ordered the same thing, TWICE, that's right we got seconds, after our seconds. It's fast, a very reasonable price for what you are getting, and the perfect drunk food. i definitely recommend it when you're in town.

Not sure what all the hype was about.  I guess i had to find out the hard and expensive way that coming here wasn't really worth my time.

These hot dogs are boiled-something i can get at a baseball game.  I prefer a grilled hot dog that has char-marks and some snap to it when you bite in.  

I ordered the basic chili dog; the toppings overpowered the hot dog, there was so much going with this hot dog that i couldn't even enjoy it.  I actually ended up eating it with a fork n knife because the massive amounts of toppings tore the bun apart.  That seriously detracts from any hot dog experience. 

It was $8 for one hot dog and a bottle of water.  

Do yourself a favor and spend that $8 next door at earl of sandwich...you'll thank me later.

The line, was what I expected it to be.. long. What made the wait seem 10x longer was the fact that the actual place is so small that once about 5 people are inside, the rest of the line is waiting outside in the scorching heat. In a way I was glad that there was a line so that my party and I would have time to browse the menu. I also noticed their had a few special celebrity hot dogs, which certain celebrities conned, obviously. There were hot dogs by Holly Madison and Kim Kardashian, and a few others too. After a few minutes, I decided on the swiss mushroom hot dog, which was a hot dog with swiss cheese, mayo, and of course, mushrooms. My mom got the chili cheese and bacon dog while my dad played it safer with just the chili cheese dog. I must say that I was definitely not impressed with any of the hot dogs we ordered. I am a fan of mayo but the amount of mayo on my hot dog was just way too much for my liking. The mushrooms were almost flavorless and the cheese was not even melted; it was as if it was just placed on top of the hot dog for decoration. Although my parents' chili cheese hot dogs were pretty similar, besides the bacon on my mom's, they were nothing special at all. I think I would have enjoyed a hot dog from Top Dog in Berkeley or even a chili cheese dog from Wienerschnitzel.. would have saved us a few dollars, too. I don't know about ya'll but $7-8 for a hot dog topped with basic kitchen ingredients just doesn't seem right. Maybe the LA location is better? But will I ever know?

Some of those friends have since moved away from LA and are deprived of the Pink's that they have come to love. Well upon hearing that there was one in Vegas, one of my friends was so happy because she was totally anticipating it and hyping it to her husband. 

Well we found it outside on the strip by P.F. Chang's at the Planet Hollywood casino. There was no line. NOT a good sign, but we thought that the Pink's name that we know and love in LA would suffice so no worries. 

We all ordered our dogs and sides of french fries and chili cheese fries. The orders came back rather quickly and we proceeded out to the patio to sit and eat. 

So how was it? Not very good. The toppings were cold and the hot dog was limp and just didn't ooze of the flavor and kick that the LA spot has. It's also more expensive here even without the wait. And one of my friends wanted a hot dog she had in LA, but they changed the names to fit the Vegas theme and lacked the same kick in LA. And the husband? He was less than impressed with the place. We ended up being belligerent and threw the fries at each other rather than eat it. 

All in all, disappointed with the experience in Vegas. Again, the nonexistent line should have been a clue. Not impressed. They really have to overhaul the place to make it match LA's!

The thing that bothered me the most besides an expensive, mediocre tasting hot dog was the condiments and cutlery section.  You can tell they purchase the absolute cheapest plastic cutlery (the forks and knives weren't even the same brand!) and ketchup.

So let's start with the cons  the shop is small and cramped thankfully it wasn't busy so we weren't bumping into people. The only seating was on a patio which was ok with the misting fans but those darn Pigeons . It made it very uncomfortable to enjoy my meal for fear of being pecked at my feet. So let's get to the pros location was right across the street from my hotel which had a pedestrian bridge. I ordered the Planet Hollywood(located at the Miracle Mile Shops at PH) it was a polish sausage with grilled onions/mushrooms nacho cheese and bacon got an order of fries as well. The dog itself wasn't salty like typical sausages which I appreciated but not much flavor. Although I liked the size considering the price it made it difficult to get all the toppings in every bite so they could have a party . The price came to $14 that was w/o a drink which is the cheapest thing I got out. I did notice on the menu they had a souvenir cup for $20 which was refillable for $10 which for LV I think is a great deal. The fries were good basic nothing special and the cashier was nice. I would try again bc like I said I'm from SC so I won't(actually can't lol) make my final judgement until I've had their chili dog.

This is probably good for drunk people who just want throw crumpled up money on a table, point at a wall and then ingest whatever they were thrown.

This place is all about the name and nothing else. Everyone in line was using a Groupon and wish I knew that ahead of time. For two veg dogs, two orders of fries with cheese, it was around $20+ from what I recall. You can sub a veg dog into any of their menu items. But we opted to make our own with toppings.

The fries are salty and limp and when you add the taco-bell style face nacho cheese on-top, its just a gastrointestinal mess. The dogs are large in portion but were not hot (temp wise) as I'd expect for something that was 'just made'.

I took the chance, and ordered the turkey dog with a simple dressing of ketchup and relish.  I keep it classic.  And what they served looked more like a kielbasa or bratwurst, it was so big.  Thick, juicy, and great flavor.  Success!

Pretty much, you walk in and the menu is on the wall one foot ahead of you.  Then one foot to the left, are the cash registers.  Order your food, grab your drink, and find a seat outside on the patio.  

Now, this wouldn't sound too bad in any other city.  But this is Vegas.  If there is any line at all, this means you are waiting outside to order (waiting outside in the 115 degree heat).  Then, when you get your food, you're eating in the 115 degree heat because there isn't any indoor seating.  

I ordered a regular hot dog with sauerkraut added.  It was very mediocre.  My boyfriend and sister ordered the specialty hot dogs.  They said there were just mediocre as well.  At the premium price tag, I was just expecting more.  But there was no difference between these dogs and the hot dogs from Costco.

My dining companion's was 2 hot dogs with cheese, chili. guac, and onions. He liked as well. In fact, he told me I can't put the picture of him eating it online!

There was a pretty thick casing on it, but I wish it had been a little hotter and fresher. There was nothing that made this dog better than a Gray's Papaya dog, a Coney Island Dog, an Atlanta Varsity or even a Disney Hot Dog.  It was super generic.
 The pastrami dog was pretty cool.  I like pastrami and wouldn't have thought of putting it on a hot dog, so I appreciate the unique combo, but same problem in that the hot dog was lukewarm at best.

The problem with Pink's is the wait time to order to taste ratio. Its good to try once but it definitely isn't worth the wait. The second thing is the seating area outside is very very small.

SANITATION: (most important to me) Tables are alright. Some dirty. fast food, like I said.

The hot dog was large with a large bun and fresh toppings, but who wants to eat a cold, UNDERCOOKED dog?

I am a bit OCD and it annoys me to no end when my hands are all messy.  Okay enough of that rant.

The hot dog just wasnt anything special and it didnt really stick out.  Heck, I dont even remember how it tasted like exactly just that i didnt care for it.  I mean it wasnt a bad hot dog but nothing just extraordinary.  Maybe others have a different opinion but whoknows.  Place was dead though... so i might not be alone on that thought.

The hot dog looked wonderful! Big hunks of bacon, lots of gooey cheese, and a plethora of chili. It was also topped with tomatoes and mustard. Trying to pick up the hot dog was an adventure in itself. Definitely needed that fork they provided. 

That being said, it was alright. The hot dog was great. Juicy and perfectly cooked. The bun was also soft and complemented the hot dog well. I think the toppings were too overpowering for the hot dog and bun! I did not enjoy the American cheese or chili. I don't like American cheese. ever.

The hot dogs here are good, but not amazingly delicious like the ones at the LA Pink's, so I'm probably biased in that sense.

However, it was just mom and I and still had way too much food.  Food was plentiful and fresh and large servings, so definitely for sharing and/or Groupon.  

Ordered 

Chili dog...larger than standard dog on a regular bun and messy chili.  Had to fork it, but great snap, texture and the chili had a good consistency.  

Mini corn dogs (knew we wouldn't eat two big dogs, but had extra dollars and I love corn dogs), however these were frozen and not hand dipped.  Disappointed, but they were very tasty, hot and fresh and plenty.  Also oddly, served w the cheese sauce which was actually good, but never have paired that w corn dog. 


Fries.  Hot and fresh.   Large portion.  Not my type of fry though.   Prefer Nathan's hot dog fries much more.  

Onion rings.  Very good.  Hot and fresh.  Good portion.  

Service was excellent.  The owner or manager was working the register.   Nice and helpful.   Knew how to use the coupon right away.  Oh, I think it was a living social or Travelzoo, not a Groupon.  No clue. 
When picking up tray, they forgot the cheese and the boy gave a double helping and the manager just  smiled and said give it to us.   

The seating was patio only and there were pigeons and a cooler January day.  And I can see similar issue in hot summer, so not a fan of the outdoor eating only.

Food: Meh. The dogs seemed precooked, the buns were plain, and the mushrooms looked canned. The Planet Hollywood dog was damn near $8 alone. I had to ask for a side of nacho cheese, because the PH dog here only comes with a slice of what looked like kraft cheese. The prices were at least $2 more than the LA location, but I guess its understandable since its Las Vegas. The fries weren't freshly prepared like the LA location either. AND to top it off, they didn't have grape Crush soda or Yoo-Hoo like the LA location. 

Service: The cashier chicks were nice. The dogs and sides were served up/made in assembly line unlike the personal attention you get from one person at the LA location. 

Overall, it was just MEH. I'd rather drive 4 hours, then wait in line for another hour to have an authentic Pink's hotdog. I probably won't come back here unless they somehow manage to replicate everything that the LA location offers. This place seemed like the ""McDonalds"" version of Pink's.

Not really seeing a deathly spicy option (not saying that I was gonna find one), I got whatever could be interpreted as spicy to some people. The Spicy Mojave Dog ($8.49) was my choice. Yeah, you read that right. It was gonna basically be $9 with tax for a damn hot dog. Polish sausage, nacho cheese, pickled jalapenos, grilled onions, guacamole, and tomatoes.

It looked and tasted like your basic hot dog bun here. With the larger Polish sausage and an abundance of toppings, it really needed one of those large gourmet buns to even give me a shot to pick it up. Fork and knife would have to do.

Flavor-wise, it did the job. It's basically as good as I could have expected this to be. Great snap from the Polish dog. Nacho cheese felt like it came from a container. The veggies and the guacamole tasted fresh. My issue is simply the price. There's no way this poor panda would even want to pay around $9 for a hot dog, even if edible gold was attached to this sucker. Besides, I'd take the edible gold and try to extract monetary value from it anyway.

I look at the Yelp reviews for the Los Angeles Pink's, and it's around a three-star average, same as the Vegas spot. Any complaints are likely directed at the price or the hot dog not living up to the hype. The line's also longer in L.A., so that probably also affects the reviewer's rating. Still, it makes me wonder if the Los Angeles spot is better.

Pink's was good for the experience. I can't complain much about the food other than not being able to pick it up. But I also don't want my wallet to have a reason to riot again.",oN23cWAm6Umyp19BTCc-QA,6,6,3,8-NZg_P_W4EbUroUOdUrDg

The reason I'm only giving three stars is that although the service is good, and the place is clean, and the dogs aren't bad, they're not all that great either.  Mainly I like the place for the variety.

The dog by itself can't hold up to a properly done Nathans, but it's nowhere near as bad as a Bar S.

The Rueben Dog is good, but the hot dog itself gets lost in the reuben part, which isn't bad, but I'd like to taste the dog if it's there.

Now, what makes Pinks (LA anyways) famous is the chili dog.  I recently had the bacon chili burrito dog.  The bacon was nice if undercooked, but that's about it.  The cheese and onions got lost in the chili which was pretty dang boring.  It's not spicy, it's not flavourful.  It tastes kind of like bean powder was mixed with ground beef, gravy, and a dash of tabasco.  Not anything special.

If a place is famous for something, it should be good, that's why they're famous.  So it was very disappointing to discover it tastes like something out of a budget can.",6aJ_WRWa3C3o0A3EXYyEmw,0,1,3,ChSQDXkC0WIYSgdH-6_Upg

Both their classic hot dogs and specialty hot dogs are delicious and more than satisfying; if you're a fan of natural casing then you'll be in heaven.  The menu feels smaller than the legendary Hollywood location's, but they have all the classics and favorites, though sometimes under different names.

I developed a fondness for Pink's while living in LA and I've missed it terribly since I left, part of that is because there isn't much of a Hot Dog scene where I live, so if you are visiting from a city with great Hot Dog joints, you may not be as impressed.

I was dismayed when I didn't recognize the menu, I'd been harboring a mad craving for a Martha Stewart Dog and it wasn't to be found.  Fortunately the cashier helped me identify the Vegas equivalent of the Hollywood dogs and I found it, it is the Showgirl Dog and I highly recommend it.  If you're more in a sausage mood, the Planet Hollywood is a delicious option.  I missed Pink's so much I had both of these gigantic dogs.",ab3reFeopcOWWDWcnFn2Rg,1,1,5,Rhs4ObUmzzWZDZvZuPfsyw

I ordered the G...jsdoifahefoiasjfsaoif dog. The one with tomatos onions and relish with sour cream, cept i cut the onions cause me and onions dont get along.

Overall i think this was a bad choice because none of the condiments really complimented each other, the relish was over powering, the tomatoes were tasteless, and the sour cream was barely noticeable. 

The bun and that long gay looking sausage made it all worth it. The dog had a crisp bite and bursted with juicy flavor (no homo...) and the bun was soft and not to filling.

LOCATION:  Pink's Las Vegas is one of the numerous eateries at the Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.  Please note that Pink's is NOT located within the Miracle Mile Shops.  The entrance and entire eatery can be accessed only externally from the shops themselves.  If you know where Earl of Sandwich is located, walk directly to the nearest doors that exit to Las Vegas blvd and there you will find hot dog mecca.

I noticed that 2 things were exactly the same at this location:  The menu, of course, and the line!  The wait time was nowhere near that of the LA location, but I really didn't expect that many people to be waiting to be quite honest.

FOOD:  My friend and I both decided to order a chili cheese dog each and shared a side of fries with nacho cheese.  

PRICE:  Price$ are slightly higher than LA......this is Vega$ after all.

SEATING:  All available seating, like the LA location, is first come first serve and is all outdoors.  Some tables have a covering provided while others do not.

AWESOME: One of the best things about this location is that.....credit cards, namely Visa, MC, and AMEX are accepted!!

My Mushroom Swiss dog was ready literally less than a minute after I placed my order- it was room temperature, with ample 'shrooms, and about seven servings of mayonnaise.

If I have a complaint, it's that the dogs are too loaded and too messy.  I feel like a hot dog needs to be eaten with your hands, but some of these are knife-and-forkers.

I don't remember the exact names of all these dogs... but I got a hotdog that was topped with relish, onions & and tomatoes, topped w/sour cream.  I feel a bit ashamed to say this was pretty good. Aside from the fact there was sour cream which may throw people off, it really put the taste together. My boyfriend had the sausage with pastrami, bacon, and cheese drizzled on top. That was a bit too heavy for him. The hotdogs are definitely better than the sausages and I really enjoyed the the chili cheese fries.

I am fond of the location as it's right in the front of Planet Hollywood and it does allow for the ever popular bouts of people watching that encompasses Vegas. 

After seeing a random post on Instagram it lead me to tackle the Three Dog Night. It comes wrapped in a flour tortilla and although nothing really special to mention there it at least didn't have a heavy taste feel to it which was nice. The hot dogs themselves had an odd taste to them that I couldn't really place to, but I did admire that it had the snap to it in each bite (that saved things for me). My highlight had to be the chili as it did feel like a tummy filler, but was seasoned well so it was a pleasant gulp down the hatch. The only drawback was that the run off from the chili did seep through the tortilla and leave it to be an orange oiled down mess at the final few bites.

 So I guess all in all you can't go wrong and for me if the LA location is out of reach so to speak having the LV experience works just the same. The price is there for sure and although the taste is hit or miss, it still is worth taking in when it's all said and done.

I ordered the showgirl, which came with bacon, sour cream, tomatoes, onions, and some relish. The bacon was pretty bad, super thin and way too salty.

""But it's from PINK''S!""
""It's. A. Hotdog."" 

I ordered the Guadalajara dog, and while I enjoyed it, was it really worth the $6? Probably not, considering it's just a hotdog. It's basically like paying $2 for the hotdog and $4 for the famous name. And if it's not even the original Hollywood stand, what's the point? Definition of a tourist trap. 

I suppose I would recommend everyone to try it once, and don't try to be healthy. Lather on the sour cream, cheese, chili, ect because if you're going to wait an obscene amount of time for a $6-$8 hot dog, you might as well go all out. It might help if you were a little tipsy as well to cushion the realization of the resources you are exhausting for minimal nutritional value. Hey, it's Vegas. Luckily for myself, I barely beat the lunch rush, was able to walk up and order, and got my dog in just a few minutes. But the line a few minutes later was crazy! Unfortunately for me though, it was also December and freezing outside. None of your $6 goes toward any indoor seating.

Needed salt and a lil sugar...it was like mayo salad vomit.

The burger patty was fine. My friends got turkey chili dogs and I tried that...it was good.

The fried something we had...I think it was french fries were good. 

The whole set up of this place is a narrow hallway...you can barely read the menu. Its about 4ft between the wall and the counter. Then there is an assembly line of cooks and at the end is a soda fountain.

Not gonna lie, I've heard about this place many times before but I never knew where it was. Turns out, my friends were talking about the one in LA, but whatevs, I'm not gonna pass on my chance to try Pink's famous hot dogs.

Anyways, you're greeted by this enormous menu once you walk in the front door, but feel free to step to the side and look at a normal sized menu if the doorway is too crowded. 

Personally, I think that the prices are a little overpriced but it's nice to order a ""high end"" hot dog with a handful of toppings after a night of drinking. I've only been here twice and I can't seem to recall what I ordered on my first visit but I can say that the hot dogs are really good and they definitely put a lot of thought into the different combinations. 

& as a fan of chili cheese fries, how could I pass on the deluxe chili cheese fries for a good portion of my wallet (costs the same if not more than a hot dog). I mean, it's pretty good, but probably not worth the cost.

2664979,2010-01-23,9,T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,"Dude, it's Pink's...in Vegas. My two favorite things in the world. OK, I really don't feel that way. But if I was a surfer dude from Redondo Beach out with my buds for a Vegas weekend, this would certainly be my dining destination of choice. Since I'm not, I guess I can be a little more discriminating. But dude, it's Pink's. Well not quite Pink's. Just a reasonable facsimile in an apt setting, Planet Hollywood. 

Jamie W. and I really wanted some dogs after strolling through the sterile City Center complex which has none of the kitsch that really is Vegas. Luckily, Pink's has kitsch to spare in its patio setting outside the hotel entrance. The menu looked familiar. We decided to each get a $4.75 Giant 12-inch Jalapeno Dog with nacho cheese and chili, and share a $6.50 ""Planet Hollywood"" Dog, which consisted of a Polish sausage, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon and cheese (see photos). Oh did I mention the fries, too? Nice and tasty they were. 

Indigestion thy name is Pink's. The Jalapeno Dog has that snap to the wiener that I don't care for much. I prefer a meatier dog to the tooth, and the mustard was way overwhelming, but chili, cheese and diced onions are bulletproof on a dog as far as I'm concerned. The ""Planet Hollywood"" Dog has quite a pile of toppings to maneuver in your mouth starting with the bacon strips lording over the sausage already drowning in melted cheese. The mushrooms seemed almost incidental to the creation, but they were good. Hell, it was all good in a bad, bad way. 

FOOD - 3 stars....quite an abundance of toppings on those dogs but not quite the Pink's I remember in LA 
AMBIANCE - 2 stars...hell, it's just a patio...in pink 
SERVICE - 2.5 stars...just keep moving the line and the dogs will eventually be there

It was ok except for the fact that my bun completely fell apart, thus defeating the purpose of eating a hot dog. My friend had the bacon chili cheese dog, which I had a bite of and really enjoyed. The bacon added just the right amount of salty goodness. The fries here were really tasty, and although we didn't order onion rings, almost every other table around us had them so I'm guessing they're popular. 

What is nice about this place is its location on the strip and the outdoor seating. A great place to people-watch and enjoy the weather. As a sun-starved Seattleite, it was nice to be able to get some vitamin D and UV rays in since most of our Vegas cavorting usually happens at night.

If you want yummy hot dogs and fries, or just some hangover food that hits the spot, i'd recommend. If you're a tourist in Vegas and are trying to experience Pink's in the city of sin, this surely isn't it. Too clean, too friendly, too flashy.

But just based off the actual hot dog and hamburger, they weren't great. The hot dog wasn't the juicy, thick tube of meat I was anticipating.  Instead, it was a thin, dry, floppy thing that looked like one of those balloons you tie into animals.  

The hamburger wasn't much better - pretty overcooked.  The fries, however, were decent - crispy, fresh and hot.  I didn't get the onion rings, but they looked like they could have been pretty good too.",txWFXIMtDUaheiePKnAQyg,0,0,2,j8NdfrWYrUlxVrWby7d60Q

I was so excited when I hear PH was opening a Pinks Hotdogs. I was even MORE excited when I got to the place and saw that there was almost no line to wait in. In LA I had to wait in line for over an hour just to get a delicious dog. However, I was very disappointed when I got to their menu.

This Pinks is NOTHING compared to the LA Pinks. The selection pretty much sucks. I could make these hotdogs at home in my kitchen or down the street at 7-11 for a lot cheaper. Just because everything is piled on high, doesn't mean it's any good. 

There aren't even many side orders or any additional toppings from what I see on the menus. What kind of place is this!? You should be able to create your own monster or pick something incredible off of the menu, but you can't. Even the fries are boring. You can get better fries at any mexican fast food joint.

-Quick food for Vegas
- Yummy bacon
-Order of fries is automatically seasoned, yumo!

Cons:
-It's too hot to eat outside in Vegas during summer, we took our food into the Planet Hollywood Mall and ate at the tables near Fat Tuesday's
-Canned mushrooms
-Didn't like the taste of the polish dog here 
-Scaled down menu from the original

I was very happy that they have a pink's hot dogs at Planet Hollywood! There was no line and not crowded! I would never wait in line for 3 hours in Hollywood location! So I got to try world famous pink's hot dogs! Very good location outside Miracle Mile, walking distance from our hotel Cosmopolitan.

Very cute place decorated in pink color, there is a wall full of celebrities photos. I was glad they had veggie and turkey hot dogs. 

A solid 3.5 star, $40 for 2 hot dogs, one fries, one corn dogs, one Pink's lemonade with souvenir cup. 

Veggie hot dog with chopped tomatoes: not much flavor, but it was not bad with mustard sauce and tomatoes 
Hot dog with mushrooms and sour cream: fairly delicious 
Fries: not bad
Corn dog: good 

Pink's lemonade: yummy

The hot dogs were good, but not great, veggie hot dog needed to wait a bit longer to get my order, other orders were fast. I guess we should've ordered Pink's secret recipe chilly on top, that would make our hot dogs more tasty, or add more toppings and sauces. It is a bit pricey for hot dogs though, but it's famous so it's OK I guess. 

I didn't think the hot dogs were great, but they were not bad either. I like this fast food place a lot because of the cute decor, and outdoor seats, good view and people watching on the strip, there were some cute little birds walking around, they were fun to watch.

Even though I am in love with the idea of chili cheese fries, the idea is usually far more appealing than the real thing. In my view, chili cheese fries are kind of like internet dating: the hottie in the picture is nothing like the nottie in person.

Same thing with chili cheese fries. Too often the chili is too wet and loaded with beans and runny cheese sauce, so the fries turn soggy and the pathetic pile in front of you ends up looking like something that just came OUT of your mouth, not something that should go IN your mouth. BUT NOT AT PINK'S! Here the fries stay firm and crisp, the chili is mostly meat, the cheese is judiciously applied, and the portion is just enough to hit the hunger spot without making you want to retch or go into a food coma.

Just to let everyone know, Pink's it outside of Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile Shops facing the boulevard.  I walked around for awhile till I found the sign in the building and realized it was outside.  Anyway, there wasn't a line and their seating is all outside, so I went in to take a look at their menu.

The menu is simple with pre-made options for you and even burgers if you aren't into their dogs. At almost 10 dollars a dog it was pretty pricey, but I expected that from a famous hot dog eaterie.  They even have their special dogs from celebrities on a flyer at the entrance and near the menu, so check those out, too.

I went for a guadalajara dog--sour cream, tomatoes, onions and relish--and my husband ate their classic chili dog with onions.  We grabbed a water and fountain drink for a total of 25 dollars and moved on down to the pick up area. When I saw our hot dogs I freaked out.  I love toppings, but really?  REALLY?  This was definitely a fork and knife dog.

I love eating my hot dogs by hand.  It's just the way that it should be, but at Pink's it's difficult to do so.  Too many toppings on the dog cause the flavor of the dog to be lost, so I scraped EVERYTHING off on one half to get down to what matters--that fried dog.  The hot dog is good with a slight snap to it, but it's not an amazing.  I ate the rest with my utensils, feeling as if I violated some ethical hot dog code by not eating with my hands.

If you want to try the dog, buy a plain one and ask for toppings on the side if you need them, that way you can really taste what a Pink's dog is all about.  If you want something really good, their chili dog was decent.

Overall the dog was decent and I can at least say that I've tried it once. Would I fight my way down there through traffic again for it?  Nope.  But it's something you have to try once so you can say that you have.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,1,3,jTcekokmBE3joG9qFYNZ3Q

I guess anyone who has bacon, American cheddar, hot dog and bun could easily make a planet Hollywood dog at home with a much lower price.

Between the four of us we had four hotdog and sausage dishes, plus a burger, the onion rings, and chili-fries.

We expected the hotdogs and sausages to be of great quality, but we found them to be lacking in flavor.     I would have given the restaurant 1 star, but bumped them up to two stars for the following:
- the bacon on my Planet Hollywood was amazing (but everything else in it was blah)
- the onion rings were very tasty (the chili-cheese fries on the other hand were not).
- when they messed up our order, they quickly corrected it and additionally let us keep the sausage plate that we hadn't ordered.
- my friends said that unlike the dogs, the burger was actually quite tasty

For me, I think the sausages that one finds at an outdoor fair have much better taste/quality than what I found at Pinks.

Sometimes there are certain foods that taste even better when your drunk and this place happens to be one if them! I ordered the Vegas style strip dog and added sour cream!

I believe that with so much direct competition around, Pink's is finding it difficult to compete. 

Many people say that this is not like the original Pink's in Hollywood. While I have been to Hollywood a few times, I have not had the pleasure of dining at the original Pink's, therefore, I don't have a reference for that comparison. This particular location was A-Okay. I ordered a veggie burger and it was divine. It was so great that I went twice during our  trip to Vegas. My husband ordered a chili cheese dog and did not like it at all.

I guess it is more than a hot dog, it's an experience.  Well...experience is the right word for it.  They not only have regular dogs, but they have specialty dogs as well with everything imaginable on top.

First...the entrance to Pinks is from the sidewalk on the strip.  I was parked in the back parking garage, so coming from the backside of the Miracle Mile, I was lost.  I thought Pinks was inside or would have an entrance from the inside.  They do not.  I walked around for about 20 min. trying to find it before I realized it was outside.

Looking over the menu I just didn't want to have an old fashioned hot dog, I wanted to try one of their special dogs.  I ordered up a Planet Hollywood dog, which is a polish sausage with cheese sauce, mushrooms, grilled onions and bacon.  They have a list of other dogs as well for anything you are craving.  My order arrived and I was ready to eat.  

Well...it was an experience that's for sure!  Trying to eat this huge dog with all the toppings gave a new meaning to messy!  I had to finish with a fork because it was just too much!

3249309,2012-05-30,0,T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,"First off, this is nothing like the Pinks in LA. I've been living in San Diego for a year now, after having lived in LA and I miss Pinks. So when I was in Vegas and saw Pinks on the strip I got really excited. As soon as I walked in, I should have known. This place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. This caught me off guard considering the real Pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. Next was the menu. I didn't recognize a single 'special hot dog'. The original Pinks special hot dogs either have a LA themed name or are named after a celebrity. The Pinks in Las Vegas has special dogs named with a Las Vegas theme. So I had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the Martha Stewart dog. She had a list behind the counter that listed which special hot dogs were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. Uhhhh... ok. So basically this Pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name Pinks slapped on.

Now for the food. I ordered a Chili Cheese Dog (with a Polish sausage subbed for the hot dog) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. I waited a few minutes and my order number was called. I went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as I saw the French fries which are nothing like the LA Pinks French fries. I made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original Pinks, and a woman, also from LA, walked up behind me and said the same. 

So was the food good? Yeah, it was decent. But not worth the 13 bucks I spent on it. The shoe-string fries were nothing like the Cajun fries (that the LA Pinks serves) I was expecting but the were good nonetheless. Worth the $5.99 I paid for them? No. But that's what you get for eating on the strip. The Polish sausage was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. But overall I'm glad I tried it.

The verdict: if you're on the strip near Planet Hollywood and craving hot dogs, this is probably the best you'll find. However, if you're a lover of the original Pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. You'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.",eU4b0pC5pNw2KukOIxctug,1,1,3,xyc20JXzhdlvpa1b3XbVpw

 It was a Monday morning, so there was pretty much no line. I'm a guac/avocado type guy so I had the Kim Kardashian and I thought it was pretty good.

Boy was I wrong.  I don't think my sister liked hers either but speaking for mine alone - all I could taste was topping and no hot dog.  Is that because the hot dog is that bad?

They were in town for the very fun, very awesome EVO (Evolution Championship Series), in which gamers compete with each other for awards and prize money. 

They had been there quite a long time, and were ready to grab some dinner. The contest was taking place at Bally's, so we ended up just walking from there over to Planet Hollywood.

The menu for this hot dog place is quite expansive! So many different combos, and it's not just hot dogs. You can get a burger, a side dish and dessert, to name a few. I settled on a regular traditional dog with cheese, bacon, chili, tomato, onion, mustard and ketchup. I also had them add guacamole for an extra charge.

It was so large, I had to use a fork to eat it, in fear of getting it all over my face (therefore messing up my makeup job. We can't have that). The Corona I ordered was expensive ($5), but complimented my dog perfectly and was well-worth it.

One of the guys I was with ordered Bacon Burrito Dog..... Let me start off with a warning. This thing has around five or six hot dogs in it. You might want to abstain from eating for at least two days prior when planning to tackle this thing.

Overall, the joint is really pricy. My total bill with the dog and beer came to around $15. Not an amount I would be willing to pay normally, but it was my first time so I decided to throw caution (and my wallet) to the wind. But because of their price points, I don't think I will be back anytime soon.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,4,2,3,ijEjVP4o4mDh8aWDT-R7yg

I'm not a huge cole slaw lover but I figured I would give it a try.  I can't believe I had never thought of this hot dog (easy to replicate at any home bbq)  It was delicious!  My friend got the chili cheese hot dog which was huge and loaded with yummy stuff on top.  The fries are big enough to split between two people (let's face it, most of the clientele to this place are women and you don't wanna scarf down the whole thing yourself)

Inside, there are a bunch of autographed pictures of sexy women who probably never eat hot dogs.  They have other hot dogs named after some of them (The Holly Madison, the Miss America, etc)

This is the important part:  Do not go during regular lunch/dinner times, or even really late at night...  Good for early lunch, but if you go during ""peak times"" you WILL be waiting.  We've passed by several times with a long line down the sidewalk.

He gets the thing and it's got lettuce, tomato, and relish (not even neon green). The eff? No celery salt? No peppers? No mustard? No grilled onions? Blasphemy!

I agree with other reviews that this joint offers crappy toppings for you to put on, which implies to me that they are not always using top ingredients for these top dollar dogs.

This is a place for me to say I ate at, but not something I would go to more than once or twice a year max.  The hot dogs come with basic long dogs or a polish dog.  The polish dog is nice and big and tastes pretty good.  I would suggest skipping the ""Chicago Dog"" as it lacks from what a I would call a true Chicago style hot dog.  The Vegas dog was pretty good as was the Majove dog.

Overall an A-OK place to eat a fancy hot dog, but not something you want to eat at often or more than once a year.  Be prepared for a pricey experience with somewhat questionable topping quality.",EZMXs_3pMV369g3CGRrQZQ,1,0,3,m6BOOjc1YHf1N0G3CJySsQ

Heading into the first bite, I definitely did have high expectations, mainly because I was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent Groupon deal. However, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. It's not fair to compare this to Costco hot dogs on price.

When I tried my friend's chili cheese dog, my eyes, taste buds, and probably everything else just lit up. Yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and grilled onions - was really delicious and made me wish that I had chosen it. Instead, I had gone with the Planet Hollywood dog, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. I also loved the polish sausage, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the nacho cheese went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.

We also shared some deluxe chili cheese fries, which had a crapload of toppings on them. In hindsight, if I had known how loaded the hot dogs would be, I would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. Oh well, live and learn.

Anyway, I've seen the other reviews, and I'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original Pink's - which I still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. Not considering the price, the only problem I have is that I'd rather go to Earl of Sandwich, which is right next door and which I love to death, so I might not really see this place much at all in the future.

There is something magical about standing in line for 45 minutes to get one of a huge number of various hotdogs.  Some more unique than others.  It would take me 45 minutes just to decide which i wanted.

The Pink's in Las Vegas is, unfortunately, not the destination that the original is.  The menu is smaller.  Much smaller.  There are a handful of the unique dogs and a few standards too.  What I really wanted they don't have (The Mulholland Drive and the Lord of The Rings).  They do have a Planet Hollywood Dog (fitting as that is the casino in which Pink's LV is located).  The Planet Hollywood dog is similar to the Mulholland Drive.  The same toppings of nacho cheese, grilled mushrooms and bacon but has a hotdog rather than a sausage.  Close but no cigar.  Instead I opted for a Pastrami Reuben Dog topped with pastrami, sauer kraut and mustard.  It was fine but nothing spectacular.  I did appreciate the snap of the natural casing.  That is the signature of a Pink's dog.  But there was no wait at all.  I walked right up to the register and ordered.  A couple of minutes later I had my food.  There was no anticipation of what I was about to receive. There were no celebrity photos to gawk at.  At least none that I can remember seeing.  I wasn't in there long enough to notice such things.

In the end, my hot dog was fine but this location just lacks that certain something that makes the original so special.  Next time I have a Pink's craving, I think I'll just live with it until I can get to LA for the real deal.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,0,3,kZYBQvdixpmmr5u2NdRI2A

After having drinks all day and night, I really wanted something bad.. real bad for me..

I decided to order a Planet Hollywood dog.  This had bacon, grilled onions, mushrooms, and nacho cheese on top of a polish dog.  Let me tell ya, It was exactly what I was craving.  It was a bit on the salty side though.  I was already dehydrated enough, the bacon was real salty... and I love salty things ;)  Other than that, i've never had a hot dog so yummy and so big!  I couldn't finish it.

The wait wasn't too bad when we came and actually getting our dogs didn't take long either.  I liked the environment, it was fun and exciting.

I'll probably come back here when I have a huge appetite and I haven't done my make-up.  By the end of eating your dog, you've wiped off all the nacho cheese that's gotten on your face and your freshly put on make-up!",9Xec9d55DdOOPw-B6FOcvQ,0,0,5,d00WXb5GQcTHH6DdZ0F5zA

Maybe it's because you have to go outside the casino to actually get into the tiny little space to order - pretty inconvenient since it was 30 degrees and snowing outside.

I was disappointed by my hot dog - nothing special - I guess all the toppings are what make Pink's special. Their staff should be a bit more energetic, ask if customers have tried Pink's before, and if not, then recommend one of the quintessential Pink's dogs.  

None of that here.  Just people who looked bored.

The stand is located outside the Miracle Mile shops, with no access from the Planet Hollywood casino. We learned that the hard way. -_-

I ordered the Brooklyn Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog. I like keeping my dogs plain, and dressed with mustard. So I enjoyed this dog, but would have liked it even more if the pastrami came out hot, rather than lukewarm.

I also sampled some of the bf's Bacon Burrito Dog (2 dogs, bacon, chili, cheese, onions). We ordered the dog without onions, but it came out standard, so he brought it back to have it re-made. The cook was nice about it, probably because there was hardly a line at 4 pm, and served up a new one within 3 minutes, spit-free! It was interesting... glad we tried, but wouldn't order it again. It is also best eaten with the wrapper, because the burrito drips chili grease... yum!

With our $15 Groupon, we had to fork out a whopping $0.52. Overall, $7.52... I would not mind paying that price, but $15.52 is a bit steep for 2 dogs.

4197339,2011-08-19,1,T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,"I should've checked Yelp instead of listening to all the hype. While on vacation there were a few places my friends and I had heard about quite often and wanted to check out - Pink's was one of them. Located right in our hotel, we figured it'd be one of the better places to eat during our trip, but ... not so much.

Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by all the good food here in San Francisco, but Pink's didn't strike me as anything special. Most of the items seemed to be pretty similar, mostly consisting of chili, bacon, onions, cheese, and other meats; not a ton of variety overall. Though I have to say, the portions-to-price ratio was pretty good - you get a gigantic, filling meal for about $10 or so, and unless you have a monstrous appetite you won't need a second hot dog.

As for the food itself? Average. Even though most of my friends and I were feeling ravenous I think only one out of nine of us managed to finish, and it wasn't really because of how filling the hot dogs were. Sure, they're packed to the brim with condiments and other things, but it's mostly standard fare. I actually felt kind of sick and bloated for a few hours afterward, and I certainly didn't feel like finishing the leftovers after looking at it later than day.

Unfortunately for people thinking they'll get to sit indoors and have a hot dog in an AC-dominated environment, the only seating is outdoors in the hot, hot Vegas sun, with only a few tables sitting underneath a bit of shade. It's a pretty small location, so if it's crowded you might just want to bring everything back to your room instead. It'll be less messy that way anyway.

Overall I don't think Pink's met the hype at all. Perhaps because the original is in Los Angeles and not in Vegas, and in addition I've had better hot dogs at local joints (sorry!). It's probably worth a stop if you're in Vegas, but don't go there expecting the best hot dog you've ever had.

After drinking on an empty stomach, my two friends and I decided to go to Pink's before meeting up with the rest of our friends at a club.  I'm not sure what it is about my group of friends but we like to have a few drinks before an intermission of (greasy but quick) food.  This can either be good or bad when it comes to writing reviews.  

We were starving and needed food asap.  We actually took a cab to PH for the sole purpose of getting Pink's (instead of just eating something in the vicinity of our first spot or the next drinking spot) because after 2 nights of eating at expensive restaurants, clubs, and losing money at the tables - we wanted to eat something noteworthy but cheap.  

According to my friend who is born/raised socal, it is not as good as the original in Cali.  I figured this was a mind-over-matter slash original-is-always-better-duhhh situation.  We ordered the bacon chili cheese dogs, fries, and beer.   My other friend (a newyorker) and I thought it was good but agreed it wasn't awesome.  Considering the acclamation Pink's receives from born and bred LA-ers, I changed my assumption and decided it probably is better at the original stand in LA.  I remember thinking it wasn't as amazing of an experience as I was hoping to get - and was a bit disappointed by the lack of ""snap"" in the dog itself.  Also, it was a bit... much.  I have a feeling the dog had better snap to it before it got doused in the chili.   

That being said, I did enjoy my experience there.  It was exactly what I was looking for at that moment.  We were buzzed and looking to eat something extremely unhealthy but tasty - and that's exactly what we got.

I'd definitely try it again because for some reason, I think it was just an off night.  And we had some strange concoction of drinks before going there so all of this might be completely in my head.",WPagNsy_iw2iqN2JCvFPOw,1,1,3,kR26y0YiS8yk3iTgHelbqw

One unique thing about this place is the burrito. Rather than using the bun, many options use a tortilla instead to wrap 2-3 hot dogs together with a ton of ingredients. It's a convenient package and definitely an interesting experience.

Also featured at the Vegas location are jell-o shots and yardstick drinks. I haven't had the chance to try either, but I am sure they are decent.

Before I start, I am not a hot dog fan
I went with a friend and we eat got a hot dog. One was the bacon chili cheese dog, other was the spicy mojave. The hot dogs were just hotdogs.... I liked that they had specialties, especially for not being a hotdog fan. It was a bit salty for me! Messy too..

Environment 
It is all outdoor seating, it is right on the strip, so you can sit outside and enjoy the view of the strip. There is no indoor seating. The store front is small, make sure you know what you want! 

Niceness
There are no servers, all help yourself and clean up after yourself. The cashier takes your order and you collect your order on the other end before heading outside to sit. 

Dollar
Typical hotdog prices, not too expensive. The spicy mojave was $8.50 which was from their specialty menu and the chili dog was about $8 which was on the regular menu. 

Yes?
Sure if I am craving a fancy hotdog. Worth the experience. Sitting on the strip people watching. Would definitely recommend to friends that wants fancy hotdogs. Enjoy!

First off If you've never tried LA Pinks, your missing out. A hot dog stand that's been free standing in the same location, with the same look since 1939. To my surprise I was super excited when I found out there's was going to be a Pinks inside Planet Hollywood.

Food: I personally don't think this place is a ""real"" pinks location. The hot dog tastes WAY off than what I originally tasted in LA. The hotdogs were longer and thinner, more bread and also it tasted like rubber. 

Service: The service is pretty slow, the place is kind of small and it reminds me of Subway. You start your order at one end and you walk to the other to pay. I have no idea why people couldn't concept that idea because it seemed like the place was crowded with confused people looking for a line. 

Price: I believe in LA prices for Pinks are around $3.50-$5 bucks, reasonable. Nope not at Planet Hollywood it was about $8.95+ a hotdog. Honestly for the quality of food and the service combined it really wasn't worth it. 

Ambiance: outside seating, super hot it was pretty annoying. The place did feel vintage inside but it was very modernized.

The basic hot dog is incredibly overpriced--$5 for one with nothing on it. The options with a selection of toppings are way better deals, at around $9 after tax. Pink's is pretty over-hyped though, either way. The hog dog itself was alright, and it did have a bit of the ""snap"" that other reviewers mention, but the hot dog bun was definitely a letdown. It was cold and basically tastes like something you get out of a bag from the grocery store that's been sitting around maybe a few days too long--it's edible but just doesn't add anything at all to the hot dog. My friend had a few too many drinks, and even he knew better than to eat the bun, instead eating his hog dog and toppings with a fork and knife. 

Overall, it's a decent meal if you want to spend three times as much on a hot dog as you should, but IMO, Pink's is nothing to get excited about. I'd just as soon pick up a hot dog at Ikea and probably give it the same star rating.

I went with a friend of mind around noon.  Pinks is right in front of Planet Hollywood adjacent to the street.  The wait when we got there was only a few minutes but since it was 105 degrees, it was a little uncomfortable.

I ordered the bacon chili cheese dog, a drink, and the chili cheese fries.  The total came out to be just under $17 which is a little steep, but I guess it is to be expected in Las Vegas.  

When the food came, I immediately thought, ""how am I supposed to fit this in my mouth."" (insert that's what she said joke)   There was a normal sized hot dog underneath a mountain of bacon, tomatoes, onions, and chili.  I literally could not pick it up unless I risked having all the insides falling off of my plate.  I had to grab a knife and fork to tackle the foot long an inch at a time.  It tasted fantastic and i could feel my eyes getting heavier immediately from the food induced coma the meat from the chili was putting me in.

After I finished my hot dog filled with 3 slices of bacon goodness, I was very stuffed.  I'm usually one with a decent size appetite but the high fatty food filled me up quick. ...and then there were the chili cheese fries to deal with.  It looked as though the workers used a bucket to pour on the chili since there was so much of it and I knew immediately that I had to take it to go and offer it as communal fries.  The few bites I could squeeze into my already full stomach were delicious.  The texture and the size of the fries were crispy and thinner than traditional fries but it worked.

The chili was very oily, flavorless, but every aromatic.....to the point that I had to wash my hands...... twice.

dog - good meaty flavor with a nice snap to it
chili - delicious rich taste and a smooth texture

My boyfriend and I usually order this, then take it to the mall or to our hotel room and eat it there, because the outdoor seating is sooooo gross and it tends to be windy. 

I love their chili cheese fries. One order of these, and I'm set for that meal. BUT I always feel the need to get their dogs too! I feel like I can't win! Chili cheese fries or a hot dog, oh the dilemma. I get into a mini panic attack because I can't choose. And then I end up getting both, and regret eating whatever I had eaten first, because now I can't eat as much as I could of the second one.

You get to order and receive your order fairly quickly. Makes it hard to make a decision, and you end up making really stupid ones like ordering way more than you can eat because you don't want to hold up the line, but you can't decide between the dog or the fries or the onion rings.

From service, to the final product, I was beyond disappointed, especially when compared to their other, much more busy LA location. I was the hungry, and the only one in line, and ordered 5 hotdogs and 1 fry, one chile, and 4 ""Chicago style"". I paid, and stood to wait for my for my dogs to be prepared, 4 or 5 people beyond the line chit chatting, laughing, totally ignoring me and my food. About 10 minutes later, one of the 5 workers starting half hazardously started throwing the extremely expensive hot dogs together in a painfully slow fashion all the while still chitchatting with his other co-workers, not giving another care in the world, let alone me, the customer. 
Now to the consumption of the dogs. I've eaten probably a 1000 dogs in my lifetime, all over the world, many I would say were pretty bad- these I would say were horrible. The bun to dog ratio were way off, which would not be bad, if the bun were steamed and not cool and on the border of being stale. I ate the chile dog first, which made the bun bearable. The second dog, which was there interpretation of the ""Chicago style"", who's toppings were way beyond ice cold- unbearably cold. So cold, the actual hotdog was cold why the time I got to it (above room temp), and extremely inedible, especially combined with the large stale bun. I wasn't the only one who felt this way, either. Since I paid, the other two in my party just politely didn't finished their food (just a single hotdog) without a peep, both starving before we got there.  
Pinks, don't go opening restaurants in hopes they become tourist traps, because I moved to Las Vegas last month, and my second day here, I was trapped by this restaurant thinking it was the same quality as the one in LA. I'm a local who could have been repeat business for you.

I don't really like hot dogs (which maybe discredits my review) but my two other friends got hot dogs and nobody enjoyed their food. I got a cheeseburger which are usually hard to mess up. It wasn't burnt or anything but there was absolutely no flavor and the tomatoes were diced and the lettuce shredded. I get that shredded premade veggies may be easier but who puts diced tomatoes on a burger? It made it really messy to eat. And at almost 9 bucks for a standard burger (with no fries or drink) I expected a little more. My friends mushroom dog had mushrooms that tasted old and my other friend got the bacon chili dog. We all got halfway through and looked at each other with dissatisfied faces and tossed the rest. Sadly, I think you'd be better off at a McDonalds.

For example: ""They ignored me and my date for the better part of an hour, the tablecloths reeked of cat vomit, the bill came out to $1879 for two entrees.....but the maitre D' had an iPod Touch! 4 Stars!"" 

I mean what's the point of wasting time with it, right? There has to have been SOME saving grace, right?

Unless there's major shenanigans that have to be called out (such as with www.yelp.com/biz/ted-wiens-tire-and-auto-centers-las-vegas-3#hrid:Ng0bUo3nQ2adWG5GHmy3MA/query:ted%20wiens ) It's been all roses and chocolate-covered corpses. 

Then there's this wanna-be Pink's. 
First off, putting Pink's in a swank hotel-casino is strike one. Pink's should be nasty, grimy, eat outside on the picnic tables and feed the obese birds. Pink's is park across the street several blocks down because you risk instant cardiac arrest if you don't walk it off. Pink's is People. 

Secondly, what's with the pseudo-exclusivity? Like the other reviewers on here have said, there's a waiting list and they're not consistent. I mean, if I wanted to wait in line I'd go to a club, aight? All I want is diabetes, goddamnit. Make it snappy. Do I need proper security clearances to stuff my face?

Having practically been raised (i.e. ""Dude, first PINK's then Necromance!"") on the ""chorizo-double-burger-chilli-ham-sausage-kielbasa-plane-crash-survivor MEGA HELLA FKN MEAAAAT!"" standards of the ORIGINAL Pink's on Melrose, this is beyond weak. 

This is Freddie Prinze Jr. doing Macbeth. This is Chewbacca after a depilatory. This is definitely NOT Spartaaaaaa!

Just thinking about how bad they fucked this up just lowered my cholesterol by several points. Atrocious and unacceptable. I'd rather fist myself to old Debbie Gibson albums than have to come back here.",A2HbQtcuK2tkegX7BXcEtg,6,3,1,i6BkTDma4PVuN-Ih__Q4jA
4758810,2017-10-11,2,T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,"Okay so this particular ""Pink's Hot Dogs"" is not the famous original one on La Brea Ave. & Melrose Ave. in Los Angeles that everyone has been to. But to have a spot located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip is definitely the next best thing. And if you're craving a reasonably priced and well-equipped hot dog, then this just might be what you're looking for.

It is only appropriate that this Pink's is located at none other than Planet Hollywood. The location itself is actually a small brick-and-mortar building adjacent to the hotel that is visible from the strip itself but not located in the casino/food court area. After seeing a live show at Planet Hollywood (which got over at around 11:30pm), I was craving a small bite somewhere; just not a full-on meal. This is where Yelp (and Pink's Hot Dogs) came to the rescue. I wasn't too worried about the hours since they're open until 3am (on Friday and Saturday nights).

The layout of this location offers a nice exterior sitting area for the more comfortable days and evenings. The inside, however has no seating and is really only an area to order and wait for your food. There is also a small condiment station as well. As many people know, Pink's offers a huge assortment of hot dogs to choose from that come in just about every topping imaginable. I, however was craving something simple which is why I ordered a good old ""Plain Hot Dog"" (for $4.79).

As it wasn't very busy around 12:30am on a Saturday night, my order was ready within 5 minutes. I had already requested ketchup, mustard, relish, and onion on my hot dog. I think made the 10-minute trek through the casino towards the elevators and up to the 18th floor of my hotel room. The first bite of the hot dog was that amazing and distinctive Pink's ""crunch"". It was cooked to perfection and the bun was still warm and soft even after 10 minutes. It was exactly as I remembered after going to their Los Angeles location on several occasions.

In addition to the 30+ hot dogs they serve up, they also offer burgers, fries, and nachos; your typical comfort food. And what visit to Pink's wouldn't be complete with a nice little alcohol selection? They serve beer, margaritas, and strawberry Daiquiris. Overall, this is a nice, lower cost option without breaking the bank. My rating for ""Pink's Hot Dogs"", a solid four stars.",yFb-Hqr8k6uIfwCQ3BO4dQ,8,6,4,YbTIYAWvyAoOn4y6mdV1og

Brief Summary
-- Spin off location from the original Pink's in Hollywood
-- Located on the LV Strip & only has outdoor seating
-- Not for the cheap of heart
-- Say NO to the chili or say yes to the toilet
-- Bring your OWN ketchup // condiments

I've seen Pink's featured on Food Network before. So when my friends suggested we go there for lunch, I was down!

Luckily we got here right before the huge lunch rush. You can imagine the line getting very long during a busy hour on the LV Strip.

--- Our Order ---
** Pinks Lemonade (no alcohol) -- It was delicious, GET IT!

** Chili Dog & Chili Cheese Dog -- PASS, the chili is definitely the East Coast style that is mostly just greasy meat/beef. The cheese didn't taste real, must have been some ""Sysco"" cheese matter. This stuff stuck to my ribs and made me want to ""yack"" later that night. My tummy was hurting. The dog was good, I ended up just eating it alone. 

** Chili Cheese Fries -- I ate these before the dog and they were mostly good because I was so hungry. Again the chili is just greasy meat, not really the ranch style chili (if that's what you like).

My biggest complaint about Pink's is that they ONLY have Sysco Ketchup which is very DISGUSTING. It doesn't even taste like tomatoes or ketchup, it just looks like it. On top of that, it's more of a thick paste then a sauce. I seriously wish I could have gotten some Heinz!

This place got a 1 star bump for my friend's polish with pastrami that I tasted. Although, it was kind of dry and in need of mustard, the flavors were there and it was juicy and hot.

I won't be back here any time soon, but I hope to try the original in Hollywood!",-HBdisZOrgMdw08zCWZ_kg,1,0,2,bdLAdKenu8L9y_zxPIlQAg

What misery. And sadness.

After nearly 1.5 years of living in Las Vegas, this has to be one of the WORST meals we've ever had here.

We used to go to the Pink's in LA a bit, as we lived in LA for a LONG time up until our move to Vegas in Dec 2010. 

So we expected SOME quality. 

Boy were we wrong. 

And even with a $15 coupon, it was WAY too expensive. RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

Never again.

I had a polish/pastrami ""classic"" thing, SUPPOSEDLY with swiss. (Swiss air?) Spouse had a ""baja"" dog, or some such (he was like ""HOW did they remove ALL flavor from jalapenos?"") and some polish thing. All were just awful.

The fries were way too salty. Virtually inedible.

Very sad, that we can't get the Pink's of yesteryear. (Then again, we've heard sad rumors about the original, too, but we can't vouch, as we haven't been in so long.)

So avoid this joint, if you know better!

PS And you know what the WORST thing about this is? This franchise of Pink's is run by Block 16 Hospitality, the same people that brought to LV the following restaurants: Holstein's, LBS Burgers, Barrymore, Public House. I've been to 3 out of 4 of those, and have been from ""quite pleased"" to downright ""in awe"". So this failure in their portfolio should be jettisoned IMMEDIATELY!",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,1,1,1,ZXODaY_GtZbgho2fpLDGXg

I wasn't aware that Pink's averaged 3 stars before I ate there.
I had the Brooklyn Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog which is basically ""that.""
A tad bit over priced for hot dogs imo

4823948,2016-12-22,2,T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,"OK place for a bite, because you know what you're getting, but also does feel like a rip off since bottom line: still paying a lot for hot dogs, with some toppings. And the hot dogs weren't the big beefy jumbo hot dogs, so it did not seem special or elevated enough to warrant the price. These were standard sized hot dogs, longer than the bun. 

But I still give it 4 stars because as Alice L. said, the wait in LA is at minimum 1 hour (if you're lucky), versus getting served here within 5 minutes or less. Not sure if it's the timing -- around Xmas holiday on a weekday, but service was fast, and the cashier almost looked a little bored. Kind of a young girl who answered your questions, but had zero energy or friendliness. Looked like she did not want to be there at all, and you were inconveniencing her by being there. Ah well, I had a Check-in offer for a free hot dog with purchase of two other hot dogs. May as well make the most of it! 

We got onion rings -- crispy and thickly battered. 

Cheese fries -- liquid cheese was good, but the fries alone seemed extremely over salted. Like to the point it tasted bad. 

Nacho chili cheese dog -- gooey cheese and chili (no beans, which is great for my husband!) and onions. We opted to not have mustard on it because it's a strong flavor and IMO didn't mix in well. 

Brooklyn/pastrami dog -- My husband had it, and they were surprisingly plentiful with the pastrami. 

BBQ/cole slaw dog -- my favorite, just because I love cole slaw. But since hot dogs are salty, I feel like the cole slaw adds a little sweetness and texture. A bit light on the bbq sauce, but still good overall. 

I don't think there's any indoor seating, only outdoor. I think most people were opting for takeout orders. FYI: we couldn't finish everything in one sitting and the hot dogs held over very well a few hours later. 

Great spot, convenient to everything on the strip. Right by Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile shops. Perfect for a quick bite to recharge.",Zohjr4ZPl76vryPqiQLJ4A,1,1,4,J6pi3RqfUmgWSyEZaQSueQ

It was packed in the outside seating area but the counter was free so there wasn't too bad of a wait and finding a table worked out pretty well too. 

I went with the Planet Hollywood Dog because the combo of bacon, nacho cheese and other grilled goodness was just too hard to pass up. 

When I got my food, there was no way to eat this thing with my hands, had to fork and knife-up for this one.

While cutting through my first piece of deliciousness my knife melted at the steaming cheese and scorching hot polish dog.

$6 for a hot dog is not bad when you see how much they really stack on the condiments (chili, onions, tomatoes)... and that it's Vegas.

The cole slaw was mediocre, but it did make me feel healthier for balancing out the grease I ingested.

The complaints about the firmness of the bun are spot-on -- you will need a fork to eat your chili dog.

Glancing along the right side of the page reveals a lot of 2- and 3-star reviews and I think it's largely due to unmet expectations.  Let me enlighten you: come if you want something quick and greasy to fill up with, and don't want to stand in line at Earl's.

After having it there, I really thought this place was overrated. The hot dogs were just ok, and were definitely not worth the wait in line (at least 30 minutes).

Because of that, I really did not want to give this location a chance. However, we were leaving Las Vegas and wanted something were it would've be relatively quick. Hesitantly, I agreed to go to Pink's. And you know what, I'm really glad I did.

For those that do not know where Pink's is, it's outside on the strip. When we got here, I was honestly surprised that there was no line here. I had to initially do a double take to make sure I was at the right location. There were the familiar pictures of celebrities on the wall which helped me know that I was at the right place.

Due to being hungry, I ordered the Spicy Mojave Dog and the Guadalajara Dog. The Guadalajara Dog was good, the mix of sour cream, tomatoes, and relish was a nice combination with the hot dog. I'm not the biggest fan of relish, but I liked it in this case. The Spicy Mojave Dog was pretty awesome. To warn you in advance, make sure you have napkins, a fork, and a knife. I rarely eat hot dogs with a knife and fork, but in this case, you must! The hot dogs have a nice pop when you take a bite, which I love in a hot dog.

There's no room to eat inside, but there are tables outside for you to sit and enjoy the strip on a nice warm day. Especially after a big night of partying, this is a nice way to recover. 

Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. The reason I rounded it down to a 3 was due to my experiences at the Hollywood location. Though I'll definitely would come back to this location whenever I'm in Vegas.",2HxQF9flaRc58XRp7BUY5g,1,0,3,NOL3ovQVwTPouw3MUJcsrg

We had about an hour before our movie started so we figured we had plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  A nice bonus of this location was that we were able to sit around the edge of the restaurant and watch college football in the sports betting area.  I was hoping that my Rival College team would lose, but I guess that is what I get for wishing ill on a team...even my rivals.

If there were half stars I would have given Pink's 3.5, but I rounded down for a couple reasons.  One of reasons was that the speed of service left a bit to be desired.  It was a pretty busy Saturday night and they only had two people working (one in the kitchen and one at the register) so service was slow.  There was a part of me that thought the menu items were a little over priced...but I rounded down more for the slow service

Now to the important part, the food:

The Las Vegas hot dog - Came with cheese, chili, jalapenos, guacamole and two hot dogs.  This was definitely the better of the two dogs we tried.  It was a little less than $7.  Really though how can you not like chill and cheese on a hot dog...everything else was just a bonus.

The Spicy Mojave (with sauerkraut) - The extra sauerkraut definitely saved this hot dog.  It just didn't seem like much without it, especially for almost $7.  

Chili Cheese Fries - I think this was the highlight of the meal.  There was a great portion of chili and cheese.  And the fries were perfect.  They were a little thicker on than a pencil, crispy outside soft inside.

It had onions, relish, sauerkraut and diced tomatoes over a hot dog smothered with the perfect amount of sour cream. It is highly recommended.

We tried the hot dog with bacon, chili and cheese. It was huge yet absolutely glorious. Since we weren't eating it as a meal but as a mid-day snack, it was large enough to split for 2 people. I kept scooping up the chili and onions that fell onto the plate. I think I enjoyed that the most.

If not for the awesome dogs, nothing else would stand out to me about this spot. The location itself was okay. Not much room to eat when it's absolutely cold outside like it was the week we were there. We ended up just hanging out inside the small location. It wasn't necessarily an enjoyable experience being that it was so cramped but the delectable nature of the food made up for it.

I thought the fries were over-priced and since I'm not a fry lover anyway, I didn't feel it was worth the money. I hoped to make it back to Pink's one more time before leaving since they have such an extensive menu, but I never got a chance.

Judging by other reviews comparing this one to the original in Los Angeles, It's a shame I never tried the original location when I was out in LA a year ago. Just another excuse to travel though and I'm always looking for that.

This gourmet hot dog is featured on Triple-D in So-Cal and Guy Fieri considered this hot dog, ""MONEY"".

The Showgirl Dog (relish, onions, bacon, chopped tomato, sauerkraut, and sour cream) - Amazing! If you love bacon, I promise you that this is the hotdog for you because it is loaded with strips of crispy, yummy bacon! The only thing I would change about the hotdog is the bun - it wasn't very good and tasted like a hotdog bun from Safeway. Other than that, I would TOTALLY recommend this to anyone.

French Fries - Possibly the best french fries I've had and that is a big statement! Pink's Fries tasted like they were dipped in batter right before they were fried and the insides were so perfectly piping hot, which made for a crispy, yet soft fry. Very good!

You really couldn't miss it with it's big pink sign. 

There was a super extensive menu of dogs, burgers, burritos, soda and alcoholic beverages, sides, and desserts. We chose only one hot dog to share, a Naked Polish, since we weren't looking for all the fix-ins. Can you really justify a $6 Polish dog? And that's before tax too. Maybe it was possibly for the polish dog size and since we were in a tourist attraction city, but I wouldn't want to pay this price on a daily basis. If it included a drink as a meal, then maybe that's a deal. Yes, the Polish was spicy, juicy, and hot. But there wasn't anything special about the bun.

The skin on the hotdogs was a tad bit tough but not overwhelming. The chili had a peculiar but subtle taste (Not nasty or anything, just something I've never had and I'm not sure if it was for the better or worse....meh).

I will say that the size of the hotdogs and the amount of fries are reasonable, and can satisfy any sensible eater. I agree with some of the other posters that the hotdogs can get a bit greasy, and also they only have outdoor seating so be aware if you decide to grab something to eat from here. But aside from that, I do think that Pink's Hot Dogs is in a excellent location on the Vegas strip. And with the restaurants outdoor seating makes eating at Pink's that much better. Especially during the more cooler evening hours when the night life of Vegas really comes to life.

In the end I don't think that this Pink's Hot Dogs sells the kind of hotdogs that will convert you to an absolute hotdog lover but they are decent and decently satisfying.

I bet it would taste even better with grilled mushrooms but I would have to pay another $1.49 to add that.

I guess it's kinda cool that they serve jello shots. Even though vegan me didn't have one, my friends paid $20 for six shots and it came with free french fries: http://su.pr/5TALb6",53dkR4-xyhjsCVHfrwiGaQ,6,5,3,W1WWKJHN54lCkzz9M57A3Q

Practically every time I go to Costco, on my way out I have to buy a hot dog.  I've even purchased their refrigerated hot dogs to make at home - not the same as the ones they make there - I think because of the buns.  But I digress...

I was in Vegas and having heard of Pinks being a southern California favorite, I realized these hot dogs needed to be sampled.  First of all, my challenge was finding the place.  I knew it was inside Planet Hollywood.  Upon walking in, I explored the mall, the food area, and even saw a big sign with an arrow pointing towards the casino/mall exit.  But Pinks was nowhere to be found.  Well, turns out (after asking someone), it is in the front of the casino.  Ahhh.  It was one of those things - most Vegas places on the strip, you never really walk out in front of the casinos.  They are always designed to suck you in and never let you leave.  

Anyway, after finding Pinks I ordered a Chicago dog and their standard footlong dog.  I should note that Pinks has a ton of hot dogs - their menu is quite extensive.  The Chicago dog was much thicker compared to the long and skinny footlong.  Both were ok.  They had been steamed.  Toppings were pretty basic.  No sport peppers on the Chicago dog, which I guess I can't complain about too much because we aren't in Chicago.  Buns were soft and tasted fresh.  

Overall not an amazing hot dog like I had hoped for (still like that Costco hot dogs better), but certainty a very decent dog for Vegas.  Maybe if I make it down to LA someday, I'll try the original.",FK_JfGRA_r0HwqDQ_-KTVA,0,0,3,tADIS51Yhm8_-9z1sjzoxw

My palate has changed over the years and although I enjoyed the first few bites of the Mojave dog, it was a bit much (which is expected given that the polish hot dog is topped with guacamole, nacho cheese, onions, chopped tomatoes and jalapeno slices).

A good dog is hard to find no matter where you look.

Both dogs were aight. Cheap and filling. But they need to do something about the bun situation because they fell apart on the first bite.

Didn't realize until we sat down to eat that they are ""Home of the Best CHILI Dog"", and we had gotten no chili. Oops.",6O8N7cv0OVbj8YbKqqbi-g,1,0,3,n3271IFlP5-Op31rNA4_rQ

OOooOoo... What a disappointment!

It was just a small little stand with one worker who looked like he didn't want to be there!

I ordered a regular hot dog combo, which came with chips, that cost $5.95. The chili dog combo was $6.95. It just tasted like a regular hot dog, except that it had a nice ""snap"" to it (which made me give the place an extra star!). Other than that, nothing special about it. The chili tasted like crap on it, probably because it was old and in the container all day! Ewww! Actually, I bet all the food they served there was old! EKKKK! =O

I had asked the guy working there when they will be opening the actual official stand, and he said he wasn't sure. However, they will be opening one near the Hawaiian Tropic entrance of Planet Hollywood. SOOO..LOOK OUT!

Equipped with hot dog, pastrami, mustard, swiss cheese & sauerkraut... I mean its not the fattiest of the bunch, but lets be honest the scorching hot weather was taking a negative toll on my appetite. Regardless of my choice, I had the chance to have a bite of a few others -- The Planet Hollywood, The Vegas Strip Dog, Chili Cheese Fries... Nothing really sang to me ya know?

They have a large menu posted on the wall as you walk in. I got the mushroom swiss hotdog, I think that is what it was. It was good, but didn't care for the mayonnaise they drizzle on as if it was mustard. The prices are a little high, I believe I spent xlose to 12 dollars on just a dog and a soda, but sitting outside is nice, I am a big fan of patio dining.

My personal favorite is the burrito stuffed with chili and a large 12 inch wiener (any one will do as long as it is large and at least 12 inches)..I call it the Kim Kardashian.

Their wieners are custom made for them by Hoffys and have a very pronounced snap to the casing when you bite into them.

I had the spicy mojave hot dogs? It had: onions, guacamole, nacho cheese, jalapenos, hot dog. How do you go wrong with that? I haven't eaten in days due to EDC so  I gobbled that hot dog in seconds. It did however need a fork and knife to eat, or else it'd get messy. It was delicious and the jalapenos were spicy. Nothing special because it tasted like something I could make at home, just throw all the ingredients in one hot dog. My bf had the roast beef hot dog? Or was it pastrami... anyways the meat for the hot dog was thinner since there were other meats on it, he gobbled it quickly and was still hungry. Both our hot dogs came out to $18. A bit expensive.

There was no line at this Pink's. Well, there were about 4 people ahead of us. But with only one cashier it's kind of hard to not have a tiny wait. I ordered the Guadalajara dog. 

In general, it was decent. The dog was fairly snappy, and the toppings were fresh. The Guadalajara has relish, onions and tomatoes with sour cream on top. The relish was a little overpowering, but very fresh and flavorful. 

The problem is that 2 days before I had a Nathan's dog at New York, New York. That dog, with just fried onions and ketchup, beat Pink's hands down. Maybe if I hadn't had that dog, I would have rated Pink's just a little higher, but even with all the amazing toppings they can't compare. 

I probably won't go back next time we're in Vegas. I just don't think it has what the original Pink's in LA has.",3Dm9eo_9VxNJnKcQyq1Keg,1,0,3,DHl1cUYjLJqpqYiHdXbnqg

5742337,2010-04-04,0,T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,"So me and my girlfriend planned a Vegas birthday trip with a group of our friends for the weekend back in January. At this time, City Center had just barely opened and we were staying at Aria in the Sky Suites. The Sky Suites at Aria blew me away and they are AMAZING!!! But that's for another review... Anyway, that morning we arrived, we decided to leave our comfy suite at Aria and to take a stroll down the strip. Being that it's January and still winter, I was stupid and brought a thin-ass jacket to wear and of course it did nothing to keep me warm. 

As we walk across the street from City Center into Planet Hollywood, we see some people walking into Pink's Hot Dogs. And since we were all freezing in the cold and hungry, we decided to rush to the door and order up some hot dogs!

Let me make something clear: We're LA folk and we love heading down La Brea Ave in LA to have a Pink's hot dog late at night after leaving the clubs. So you can imagine my excitement as we stepped in through the door and out of the cold. I was gearing up to order myself a ""Martha Stewart"" dog but sadly, they don't offer it at this location. Ok, not a big deal. I'll order whatever is on the menu. I think I had the Holly Madison... Insert sad face. To make a long story short, this did not please me. 

I don't care what condiments and sides came with that damn hot dog, when I bit into that thing, I wanted to spit it right out. I know what a Pink's hot dog tastes like and that was not a Pink's hot dog. It was soft and mushy and didn't have that firm, juicy texture that I'm accustomed to at the Pink's in LA. I firmly believe that if you're going to call yourself Pink's Hot Dogs, you better serve it up like it's Pink's Hot Dogs! 

Am I being a bit overdramatic? Maybe. But think of it like this... What if you walked into a McDonald's and ordered a Big Mac but it ended up looking like and tasting like something that came from an elementary school cafeteria? Or out of the back of some fat guy's ass? What then? I would rather pass out in the bosom of an obese woman with three eyes, one large breast and one little breast, and a tentacle hanging from her double-chin than eat another of those things. 

If not for beer and gambling, I would have done nothing that entire weekend in Vegas but complain that it's not the same. And since I'm not in Vegas and I'm sober, I'll say it anyway...

It could easily fill you up. I also love their chili cheese fries delux style (includes onions, tomato, and sour cream). There is only outdoor seating so if it is summer it will be uncomfortable. Also, I am a Coca Cola lover and they only sell Pepsi products. Aside from that I enjoy coming here. The seating faces the strip so you get a view of the Aria hotel and you get to people watch. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is a little high. I paid $32 for two specialty dogs, delux chili cheese fries (which is small), and 2 drinks.

If you sign up for Planet Hollywood's rewards card, you get a booklet chock full of coupons, one of which is 10% off Pink's. Of course we used it, and it barely made a dent into the final price.

The hot dog was okay, filled with overflowing toppings. The thing that caught me by surprise was how tough it was to bite through and chew through the outside casing. I mean, I've heard of hot dogs having a good ""snap,"" but this is getting a little ridiculous. I might have chipped a tooth eating their hot dog. That would be a first.

Overall, not really worth a wait of any kind. If you really want to try a Pink's hot dog, by all means go ahead. But if you're itching for a snack to tie you over until the next buffet gorge-fest, I suggest heading over to Earl of Sandwich inside the casino.

I don't know why people are questioning the price? These are not the same hot dogs and polish sausages as Costco! Pink's hotdogs and polish sausages are better, overall. Higher quality meat, casing, larger in size, and with toppings. Pink's is not in the Miracle Mile Shops, they are on the front of the PH, with patio seating on the strip. So NO. $5-10 for a hot dog loaded with toppings and bacon isn't a lot. The hot dog at Serendipity 3 at Caesar's is $15.

It was actually very disgusting.  And some how...2 chili dogs, 1 order of fries, and 2 Gatorades cost me $23!  If I went to Sonic, it would have been about half that price and taste 5x better.
I got the hot dog about 4 minutes after my order was completed.  The hot dogs didn't even taste like they were cooked completely, and the chili...well that was the most disgusting part...  The chili tasted like it was just squeezed out of whatever bag it came from and put directly on my hot dogs.  It was pasty and gritty, and was barely warmed up.  And the taste of the chili....well it tasted DISGUSTING!
The fries were okay.  At least they were cooked.  They server those skinny, little, shoe-string fries BTW like at Steak & Shake.

The hot dog, the actual meat part of it tasted acceptable, but not good. And they were too skinny. Skinny hot dogs are for suckers. Go big or go home. If I get a dog, I want it to be mostly meat inside the bun and all the other toppings pouring out of the top of it. Thats a hot dog. A skinny hot dog covered in onions is as dissatisfying as, well a skinny hot dog covered in onions. The ""grilled"" onions had clearly only been acquainted with the grill top for a few seconds before hoping on to the long twig that was my hot dog, and didn't have any of that yummy caramelized taste that real grilled onions have. The pastrami was plain and dry. Call me picky but isn't pastrami supposed to taste like something other than newspaper? I've never had pastrami this disgusting. And I've had a lot of pastrami in my time. You can make yourself a better dog for a 5th of the price by going to the deli section at your local grocery store.

I give it 4 stars in spite of the crappy patio setup, and small size. It needs a bigger area, some indoor seating, and a better looking patio -- it feels like they built it as an afterthought because they had some extra space left in a wall. It really should be built better.

However, I found the hotdogs to be fantastic! That's why it gets all four stars. They're a bit spendy for hot dogs, but when you've got bacon, sour cream, onions, relish, ketchup, and kraut on it -- it's not exactly going to be cheap. The dogs themselves weren't exactly top-notch, but the toppings all over and the ginormous size really made the dog great.  Next time I'm back in Vegas I will definitely stop here again.

So off to Planet Hollywood we went.  But when we pulled up to Valet Parking behind three stretch limos, and no valet was in sight, something seemed off.  Then I saw that we were about six blocks from the valet stand, again with no valet in view.  So, off to self-parking we went, with uniformed police everywhere, to find a parking spot.  At length we found one--the only one.  Something unusual was definitely going on.

So, Diane and I walked from the parking garage into the Miracle Mile shops, and walked and walked.  As we finally reached the entrance to Planet Hollywood on the other side of the shopping promenade, 9 uniformed sheriff's deputies were assembled together, and fashionably suited males and well-dressed females were everywhere.  About then I realized that we had left the Groupon in the car.  Oh, well (sigh).  I decided that I wasn't going to walk all the way back and return again just to save a mere $5!  So, we continued on and out the main doors until we finally saw Pink's facing Las Vegas Boulevard, and examined the vast menu on the wall before making our selections.

This story does end well.  I really enjoyed my Brooklyn Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog with pickles, onions, mustard, and sauerkraut added, on a soft Old Country bun.  It included a generous amount of tender pastrami, and although the hot dog was thin, it was long and had a very nice snap to it when one bit into the casing.  Beer-battered Onion Rings and nicely salted Shoestring Fries were both good and tasty.  And I liked the mild Nacho Cheese Sauce for dipping my Fries, while Diane enjoyed Mini Corn Dogs.  To my surprise, one single hot dog sufficed to quell my appetite.  And, there were free refills of lemonade and all other available soft drinks.  

The place is nothing fancy, seating is all outside, and there is only counter service.  But staff members were friendly and helpful.  We had a nice view of the Strip before us, but it was a mite cold and windy at 10:47 p.m.  Heat lamps were present, but not in service.  Hard driving music overhead added to the casual ambiance.  So, we finished our food, walked all the way back to the car, and left the parking lot as we were directed out by at least 6 police officers.  Just as we were turning onto Tropicana Avenue, Diane asked the last officer if she knew what was going on at Planet Hollywood, and was told, ""Soul Train Awards!""

Now I'm sort of glad that I still have my Groupon for Pink's, which, as luck would have it, does not really expire for another month.  For, it means that I can return again soon to enjoy another tasty classic dog!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,4,4,Q1x3bcH92OKESdspm_xr3A

Grilled onions and mushrooms are done just right for all the combinations. The Las Vegas dog is now my new favorite. Be WARE they load the hot dogs. This is no cheesy Weinerschnitzel or Sonics dog. One dog and sharing fries, will make you plenty full.

My sister and I shared the mushroom swiss dog, the bacon chili cheese dog and a side of onion rings.  I was surprised that our order came out looking like regular hot dogs and buns (that you'd buy from any grocery store) slathered in everyday condiments.  I totally agree with the other reviews that there was really nothing special about the food here.

The mushroom swiss dog was disgustingly coated in mayo.  I like mayo but not to the point where that's all you taste with every bite.

The bacon chili cheese tasted no better than something I could have ordered at Wienerschnitzel...super salty and the chili tasted nasty like it was ""fresh"" out of the can.

Of all the things we ordered, the best thing was probably the onion rings but there wasn't anything extraordinary about those either.

Honestly, this place is no different than any other fast food joint except that it's highly overrated.  We actually came here after several rounds of mojitos and even then it still didn't taste any good.",WGzuou0_YOojgoKs7jL68g,0,0,2,mYzOEzBYkn0EO5iRGqJhxw

Since the place is so talked about, and has thousands of reviews for it's original Cali location, I have to admit; I was expecting a dog that would blow my mind. I didn't quite get that. The dog was decent, but was way too loaded with toppings so it had to be eaten with a knife and fork. Kind of just turned into a mess of bread, beef, and mustard that frustrated more than satisfied. 

On the other hand, the chili cheese fries were pretty good... but paying $30 bucks for 2 hot dogs, 2 drinks and an order of fries isn't worth it for what you get. It's basically fast food for sit down restaurant prices... which is ass-backwards.

My friends that I went to eat with all had similar reactions. (one ordered the polish sausage-based dog, which he said was overcooked and dried).

I've heard about them on TV so I chose their fame over the reviews (dumb move). The fact that their hotdogs look visually appealing made it much worse because the taste didn't match the looks. The hotdog and toppings tasted old and bland. Each bite I would question all the bad decisions I've made in my life. To add insult to injury, my friends and I all got stomach aches on the bus ride to EDC. Thanks Pink's Hotdogs, no one ever wants to take a dump in a Porta-potty at a music festival.

The chili fries were super crispy and fresh, and definitely one of the best fries I've ever tasted. They were gone instantly among the four of us. I split the Las Vegas Strip Dog with my friend since it had two dogs inside of it, and I never thought I'd be eating guacamole on a hot dog until that day. It was delicious! I have no other words to describe it, but both guacamole and chili were great additions to my hot dog. I haven't tried the Planet Hollywood Dog, but my friends gushed about how great it tasted.

As a fellow Chicago-ian, I'd say I've had my fair share of Chicago dogs and you know a good hot dog isn't good unless you have the right condiments/toppings to go with your dog. 

 I thought the Vegas version of Pink's was much more weak than the original location mainly because it feels absolutely cramped inside and you'll probably feel guilty for blocking the entrance trying to decide which hot dog you want. Once my bf finished holding up the line trying to find the RIGHT combination for his hot dog, we placed our order and got it within 5 minutes.  The hot dogs were pretty average and they loaded it up with tons of toppings which is nice, but my hot dog was missing out on a ton of ingredients that defines a Chi-town dog. What happened to the onions, tomatoes, and mustard on my hot dog, Pink's!? Instead I got lettuce, relish and a pickle.
