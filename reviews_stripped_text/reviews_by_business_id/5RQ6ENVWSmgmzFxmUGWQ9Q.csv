I love how it's chill and smoke free! I was sooooo relaxed!
Hubby, a friend and I came here after dinner one night around 7pm and it was super chill. 

The guys ordered a Mango Soju and a Pomegranate Soju. See my pic.
Honestly I tasted both and did not like either LOL! Waaaaay too sweet for me and I did not taste any alcohol at all. I like my drinks strong and there is no way I would never order that for myself. 

I had a few beers and they were nice and cold. I really like the water bottles :) See my pic.

I really want to go back and try the food. I saw several dishes come out while we were sitting there and they smelled divine.

The owner? I can't remember his name. He is super super nice. Came over several times to talk to us and get feedback. I told him that his patio area will be a super smash hit when/if they set it up. He said they will eventually. He asked us how we found the place and I told him I was a Yelper and that I saw Misti's review and check-ins :)

We will defiantly go back. 
I really love the chill vibe and actually the music videos keeps me in a trance. I love it. 

I'm convinced our friend might call his cable company and order a K-pop station if that even exists. :)",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,13,8,4,3g3WfvwFaRIvRr3UExdIjw
1432119,2014-05-07,9,5RQ6ENVWSmgmzFxmUGWQ9Q,"21 is the first Korean bar/club that I know of in Vegas that reminds me of ones that are modeled after other establishments in other cities such as L.A., and Annandale, VA. But, 21 definitely follows the sound of its own horn providing such a unique and impressive setting.

I've been here a multitude of times. From Elite Events, UYE's, to just informal get-togethers, 21 has regularly bestowed upon me a service that has been dependable, and drinks that are solid.

Foodwise, I commonly order the dried squid and file fish on the appetizer menu. It's a fairly uncomplicated dish which totally complements beer and soju drinks. I've tested numerous other items on the menu, and they are more favorable than other comparable establishments.

On Wednesdays, there is a DJ that spins club music, and during this time, this venue gets swarming with crowds of folks looking to get their freak on.

New note: 21 has just a while ago constructed individual karaoke rooms, for inebriated hijinks, or for those wanting to develop into the successor of Mariah Carey (or Mark Carey...)",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,14,9,4,4mKJz8swSa3vCRk48PCM4A

Walked in with a few friends around 8ish... only to find that WE were the only patrons... AND that we just missed HH!

We opted for the lit tables.  I find it fascinating when my table lights up... guess it makes the experience more appealing & fun! 

Since we just came from dinner, we only came here with the intention to drink.  They've got a full bar, but we went for the Korean stuff... ordered the Mango soju, Yogurt soju, & Hite beer.  Both sojus were quite enjoyable, but I preferred the yogurt one as it tasted less sweet.  

Granted that they just opened up last month, I'll forgive them for being so empty.  The service was good, drinks were tasty, dint get around to trying the food, but the pix look good.

DRINKS:  Soju cocktails and full bar.

Almost fell on the way in, entrance curved down so WATCH YOUR STEP!

Really dark, loud music, cool vibe..

Friends and I sat at the lighted table instead of the bar because it was impossible to read the menu at the bar!

We started off with Strawberry & Yogurt Soju (our fave) and then ordered a Mango one soon after.. Seriously like juice! So good and not so sweet.. Although I didn't feel as if it was as strong in alcohol as the other sojus I've had before! 

Food wise -- there was nothing special, nothing that stood out from their menu.
Spicy, bland, Korean food ..¯\_(?)_/¯

Service was like molasses! Took forever for our waitress to come check on us and also took forever to get their attention..

2295638,2014-10-01,1,5RQ6ENVWSmgmzFxmUGWQ9Q,"Overpriced, mediocre food and crappy service is what you'll find here. When we arrived, there was only 1 other booth seated but for some reason it took 5-10 minutes before we even saw an employee. It didn't help that when the server finally showed up, he spent 5 min arguing with us over the terms of our Groupons when the terms are clearly printed on the voucher.

I wanted to try the short ribs but they were out so I settled with bulgogi, kimchi pancake and wings. The bulgogi was ok and was served with a bowl of rice. This was the only thing in our order that was decent although I would've expected a $10 order of bulgogi to be much larger than what we got. The kimchi pancake was bland and was just a greasy piece of dough with tiny bits of kimchi in it. No taste whatsoever. The wings were just pieces of fried chicken with dipping sauces...definitely not worth the $11 they're charging. If it wasn't for Groupon I'm not sure who the hell would be eating here!

If you're planning on coming here to drink, forget it. Just turn around and go home. Soju and cocktails start at $12.99 at this little bar. No wonder it's always empty! Do yourself a favor by skipping this place and saving your money!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,1,2,3puFh80MFye8EdumB9LOtw

Why does this place get 1 star?  NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE.

This place opened up in March 2013.  How in the world did they pass inspection with no regards to wheelchair accessibility?  My friends had to lift me up 4 steps just so we can hang out.  But because this was a special occasion, I quelled my anger long enough to enjoy the evening.  

We ordered:
Boneless Chicken - probably the most amazing chicken I have ever had anywhere.  Hint of orange, 2 different crunch textures (from the battered exterior and the peanuts) juicy and moist chicken.
Cheese Pork Cutlet - thick cutlet, cheese placed right inside.  It needed more sauce as it was slightly dry.
Kalbi Fries -  not enough Kalbi but it was good.

The food came out SLOW.  We ordered our food and they came out trickling one at a time, after an hour we placed our order.  The place wasn't even packed.  We were only the 4th table at this place.

They do not have chairs, only benches to sit on.  But this also attributes to the owners lack of regard to people who will be coming with their own chairs.",XnUsbrLIBB69Q5eM1f34Ww,2,0,2,ifx0uA2kAfKx-7NmGJD6Qg

They set up was very nice looking, huge screens playing Korean pop videos, light up tables with comfy booths and benches to sit around. Our waitstaff was VERY nice (and cute) and attentive and we all had a super fantastic time eating and drinking.

Anyways, the whole place is pretty spacious. The bar itself is right in the center of the whole thing surrounded by tables and chairs. The tables are lit up. Something you have to see for yourself. On half the walls you have several projectors screens with projectors showing nothing but K-Pop videos. I swear every video had the same group of girls only with different hair and clothing. Don't get me wrong, all these K-Pop girls are pretty. They all just look alike. Sometimes the dudes look like the girls too.

So I join my friends. They are already toasting for like the umpteenth time. The main reason why they came here was for happy hour, which was 6 pm 10 pm. All drinks 30 percent off. That's everything from your different flavored sojus to mixed drinks. Not a bad deal. Some of the food they serve is decent like chicken katsu with cheese. Its kind of like what you would get if you had chicken parmesan but in a Korean version.

The only thing that really irks me is that you can smoke anywhere you sit in the place. I can imagine on a really busy night your chances of gettin lung cancer an emphysema skyrockets by a thousand percent. 

I had a lot of fun hanging out. That night there wasn't too many people there so the smoke was minimal. Still I wouldn't wanna go here just because I wanted a drink for 30 percent off. If only somebody could invent some kind of ventilation system that sucked all the smoke out then I can truly enjoy my experience.

Upon entering it is very dim. Barely any lights besides the K-Pop music videos playing and the neon lighted tables. Watch your step because when you first enter the floor isn't leveled so girls who have heels on, try not to fall. 

We seated ourselves at a table because that's the only place that had any kind of light to even look at the menu. And even that was a struggle. We decided to order Strawberry & Yogurt Soju to start our night. My favorite! Boy they were good. All those 3 stars are from how delicious I thought the sojus were. Later on we decided to get the mango soju as well! Again pretty damn good. 

For foods-- I had gotten a groupon, $15 worth of food for $30. We ordered Bulgogi Fries which I thought were really good. we also go the chicken wings. They were on the sweeter side & I didn't really care for them. Also my friend got the spicy rice cakes which I didn't really like either. Lol ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

Service-- Took forever for a waitress to come and even acknowledge us. The place was nothing but busy when we arrived. Once we got her attention the service started to pick up. She came by and checked up on us once in a while. 

What I hated about this place was.. There was smoking allowed. I know it's half a bar but it's also half a restaurant. There should be a designated place for smokers, if even that.

April had the shrimp with mayo....2 things. I would never think to deep fry shrimp and then toss with mayo and OF COURSE April got a dish with mayo in it, Anyway, I thought it was DELICIOUS.

The drinks are very tasty, though when you buy flavored soju, you should be aware it is going to be low in alcohol content. Beer is fairly priced, as is most of the food. Very typical for a Korean bar.

For me, the food was good, but not quite top notch. I had some Omu Rice, kimchi pancake, a taste of the pork cutlet, as well as some spicy chicken thrown onto my plate... All of it was authentic, but the execution could be sharper for a couple of things. I'd say Soyo has better food, but the environment here is more of a bar than there.

One cool thing is they're open until 5am every day - when we got there around 745 (end of happy hour), it was pretty empty, so this is definitely a late night place. It was a lot more crowded around 10-11 when we bounced to the next destination. And they serve food the whole time as well.

Tables light up neon colors, lights are very dim, music video projections on every wall, spacious, clean, and lots of places to sit. It was a great night, nonetheless. 

I heard it was also a restaurant. So I decided to have my boyfriends surprise birthday dinner here the next week. Which I did. Food was so good. Ryan (manager/our server) is amazing. And we just had a great time. For a table of 10 people, I spent about $200. Including drinks and food. So I really don't understand why people are reviewing this place as ""expensive"".

4273873,2014-05-25,1,5RQ6ENVWSmgmzFxmUGWQ9Q,"I came here on yesterday with a groupon deal, $15 for $30 worth of food. I ordered the tofu kimchi (11.99) and boneless chicken (12.99). Both dishes were equally delicious. The tofu kimchi came with a bowl of rice. Besides kimchi, there were also rice cakes and meat (I think it was a meat) in the kimchi dish. Which was a wonderful surprise. It was spicy. So for people who don't like very spicy food, stay away from this dish. The boneless chicken dish has a sweet taste to it. I really enjoyed it. But for people with peanut allergies, stay away from this dish. I saw two peanuts at the bottom of the dish. Always tell the waiter any food allergies you have. I never thought I would find peanuts in a boneless chicken dish. Luckily I'm not allergic. Together, the two dishes came out $24.98. Just one dish is enough for a person. No need to worry about ordering two to feel full.

As for the service, they were really good. They checked up on me multiple times to see if I need water or anything else. But about the place  I got there 9pm and the place was DEAD! Only two people were there. 10pm, still dead! I was really in the mood to dance and mingle. But nothing. 10:15pm, a group of 3 Koreans came in and sat at the table next to mine. One began to smoke. That's when I took it as a sign it is time to leave because it is 10:30pm and nothing is happening.I think they need to advertise more since they are still new.

The vibe and ambiance is cool. Korean pop music videos were playing. I understand the place gets hopping late nights. It was our first time there and we noticed it was quiet, but it was early and we arrived right after opening hour.

I was going to give 5 stars but only from a marketing standpoint, the menu text/design could have been updated as some N/A items were scribbled out. I'm a graphic designer and kind of picky about those things ;)",Z1g3_X8wTyTsRsTuEDv2qA,2,1,4,aEYPi5rChr3I0d5Fq5USKg

4835434,2014-07-04,1,5RQ6ENVWSmgmzFxmUGWQ9Q,"Came here after buying their groupon.

While not a negative impact on my experience, the place was pretty empty with only two other tables occupied. But whatever.

At first, I wanted to order their short ribs, but they were out. While I figured this was only for the day, there was other pictures and menu items that were X'd out with permanent marker. It would be cool if they kept up with a updated menu.

I got the calamari, the pork cutlet, and the bulgogi fries. The calamari was tempura battered, not a whole lot of flavor to it, but it wasn't overly cooked and chewy like some calamari tends to be. It came with a soy sauce and vinegar type of sauce which added some needed flavor. Overall it was okay. The bulgogi fries ended being a lot of fries with only a little bit of bulgogi. The meat was overly sweet. It was topped with some shredded cheese, onions, and some type of 'corner store gas station nacho cheese' and two other dip-able sauces. While it was something different, and of course I wasn't expecting it to be or taste like authentic Korean food, some more bulgogi on it would have made it a little less forgettable. The pork cutlet was pounded extremely thin and heavily breaded. There was some type of sauce on it, but I couldn't tell what it was, and the pieces that didn't have sauce on it didn't have any flavor to it. Most of the pieces were chewy. Rice and some shredded cabbage with a drizzling of sauce came with it.

The service was good, I was always given more napkins when I asked for them, and I always had plenty of ice water.

Nothing was particularly bad, but nothing was particularly good either. Which is fine, since 21 doesn't play itself up to be a fine dinning experience. It mainly plays itself to be a bar that serves bar type food. I saw they had a full bar with a selection of soju and other Korean alcohol. The food seemed perfect for 1/2 off happy hour, or to soak up some alcohol.

I would come again with another groupon or during one of their half off food and drink days. With it being so empty during the evening time, I don't know how much longer it will remain open.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,0,0,3,pA8rxPR2ujfSHQBGSfOqzQ

Sent a text out to my friends on Saturday night to meet here at 7:30 so we could catch the end of Happy Hour.. We all arrived separately.. some later than others. We ordered like 6 bottles of soju and 6 bottles of beer to get the party started.. I appreciate that they honored the HH prices even though we ordered at 7:58 haha 
The space is big with lots of LED tables and flat screens playing Korean music videos. They also have a large central bar. My friends ordered lots of food.. I unfortunately was full so I didn't try anything but it looked good and my boyfriend said it tastes better than Soyo~ 
The servers were super nice and attentive. They took shots with us and took pictures of/with us haha My iphone was about to die and so the server took it to the bar and charged it for me. The server told me they will be getting karaoke sometime in the near future but they should also invest in some hookah too to draw in more people. 

Over-all great vibe.. very trendy reminds me of the lounges in Korea town in LA. I even like the restrooms.. Big full length mirror.. Great for taking drunk ""myspace mirror pics"" with your girlfriends LOL I really hope this place pulls in more business, they should probably focus on some major marketing and promotions because it was empty when we went!

HOT TIP: Happy hour is daily 6-8, 50% off beer, soju & cocktails! Also if you let them know in advance that it's your birthday they will set up something special for you complete with decorations, cake & cocktails~",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,11,7,5,B9y-glyyWoZ2QDhqWXByEg

It's been open for about a year and a half now, I think, but every time I go there it's pretty deserted still. Nevertheless, it's got great happy hour (50% off food and drinks!) and I've been back time and again and always had fun.

The inside is pretty huge, with garish neon lights, and TVs lined along with walls constantly playing Kpop music videos. It kinda reminds me of S Bar in the LA Ktown. 

The food is pretty typical, decent drinking food. They have a full bar too I think, even with high end stuff like Macallan. Of course, they've got the Korean stuff too, hite, soju, even flavored sojus.

I've always had a good time here, though it's always so empty that I'm scared it might not be open for much longer. Hopefully it lasts!!",lSYjxhpxWQQGaCbMOKNO_Q,4,4,4,_So2OoDbpLVzWdebHfSEfA

5123036,2014-07-16,3,5RQ6ENVWSmgmzFxmUGWQ9Q,"Really outstanding authentic Korean food here. Even the rice water hit the spot and I'm not usually a rice water fan. 

We ate bulgogi, kimchee chigae (soup which wasn't on the menu that they made special) and some spicy pork-gogi dish. Everything was delicious and the portions were pretty decent. 

My only possible negative critique is that it was extremely dark at the table. The tables themselves are cool and lit up but it's hard to see your food coming from your plate to your mouth...like I couldn't tell if I had pork or kimchee on my spoon until it was up to my face...that dark...but if they are going for a club vibe, they nailed it and if we were there to drink it probably would have been fine.

The friendly service was spot on and the food was better than expected. I'll definitely come back and try something new sometime.

The drinks here are decent priced during happy hour from 6pm-8pm. I think most of the soju was $5-7, beers and liquor also half price.  If you are drinking after HH, it will add up pretty quick, but it's still somewhat reasonable.  A few pics of the soju :

If a Korean joint doesn't make great bulgogi, I don't have high expectations for the rest of it. Didn't have much flavor, and the meat had no crisp or char on the edges at all...they must slow cook it here or something.

Kart ordered a Spicy Chicken concoction :

We tried a few things on the menu like the sausage, pork cutlet and bulgogi. For drinks we had mango, yogurt and strawberry soju...it was happy hour when we went so drinks were half-price! They also have drinks other than soju.

When I heard a group of friends were meeting here for some Soju, I couldn't say no after seeing the menu.
Happy Hour from 6-8pm is a good deal to try some of their soju. All drinks are half priced. The Strawberry Soju was like kool-aid, but I fell in love with the Yogurt Soju...tasted like a creamsicle! Plain bottles of soju can be consumed as well, it's smooth and has more kick than it's flavored counterpart. There is beer as well if you're not the adventurous type.
So onto the food. I got my Shrimp with Mayo (15$) batter dipped decent sized shrimp were crisp and tasty with a sweet sauce covering them. I would've loved a spicy dipping sauce on the side to cut some of the sweetness. Their portion was big, so I encourage sharing. So we also got the Cheese Pork Cutlet...OMG! Yum! I'd go back just for the food.
Love the atmosphere with the light up color changing tables. Lots of room, not crowded. Staff was pretty good about keeping up with us. The  K-Pop videos playing in the background is an interesting ""something different"" to watch and listen to while enjoying your food and drink. A downside was that there were some smokers in the bar and we got wiffs of it at times, but it wasn't ""smoky"" like a lot of places and it also gets really loud.
