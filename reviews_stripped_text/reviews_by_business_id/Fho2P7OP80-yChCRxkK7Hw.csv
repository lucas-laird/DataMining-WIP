It is ok for what it is. It is cheap, quick food available 24/7.

I love their chicken soft tacos! I also love that they have an extensive menu of items under 99 cents! You can grab a value size burrito, a mini quesadilla, some hard shelled tacos, or nachos among many other items! All of these things (and more) are priced at just  99 cents or less! The food I have gotten here has been solid by Del Taco standards. Nothing over the top, but not bad either.

The service is okay. I've certainly had worse at other Del Taco locations. That being said, keep your expectations realistic. 

So, I guess what I am saying is that this location is your standard, run of the mill Del Taco. It is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.

Went through the drive-up about 7:30pm Friday night, they were holding all the cars back from ordering by announcing ""we'll be with you in a few minutes"" over the speaker.  Well, a few minutes turned into about 15 considering there were a couple of cars in front of me.  After I ordered and rounded the corner to the window, I realized what the hold up was.  They are timed at how long cars sit at the window and didn't want a line of people waiting and messing up their numbers.

So, I was extremely specific on what I wanted, and again like an idiot I got all the way home to find out it was wrong.  So back in my car I get and drive all the way back to have it corrected (knowing that by the time I get home everyone else will have finished their meal and I will be eating alone).

I walk in and immediately the night manager Sergio gives me a bad attitude.  I showed him the receipt and asked him to remake the item and to give me a refund for my time, gas, trouble...whatever.  He cops a total attitude with me and says I can have a refund or item re-made but I'm not going to get both.

You know, for a couple of two dollar tacos (that probably cost them a nickel each to make) you would think they would do what they could to keep a pretty regular customer coming back a couple of times a month.

There are way too many other options out there for me to ever go back to this Del Taco.  Thanks to Sergio and his lack of customer service skills.",TszSb9N49c8JPRevXG2GeQ,0,0,1,NLSWpwoQiGrAFol3Tk2d2w

1) In general, my reviews are overwhelmingly positive.
2) I really like Del Taco
3) I am fine with indifferent service/minororde r issues
4) I eat a lot of fast food because 'Merica.

The guy in the drive through exuded ""f*ck you"" from the moment the speaker came on. He said everything he was supposed to, but it came loaded with battling quantities of creepy and douchey. Real simple order with a no ice drink. Clarified specifically no ice (in a very nice way). Got drink with tons of ice less than 10 seconds later. Food came out shortly after and the body language/tone coming off that dude was nothing short of a master's class in hostile and condescending body language.

I called up with a simple complaint and the ""manager"" talked over me, dismissing my legitimate concern of missing items.  He then hung up on me.  This place is pathetic and sad.  Boo, thumbs down.  Food was whatever; not as good as my normal Del taco.  Flagrant scum bags working the counter.",qGMfXy3uuP3byWQXWNDqNA,0,0,1,_MfwKs-3x2C9pVQG5mWCtw

Why cause you don't know how really old the meat is specially late night early morning. Why I say that . I order 4 tacos though the drive though around 3-4am. As I pulled up to the window to pay the cashier walked away from the window and I see another guy filling up hot water from the coffee machine into a lexan (metal pan) and started mixing it. I was a little what was inside and I knew it was meat they were warming up and sifting it up to put in my tacos. I asked the cashier if that was old meat . He said no it's the hot water we put under to keep the food warm. I'm not stupid I'm in the restaurant industry since I was 16and I'm 36. I know what he was doing. After I said this comment the other gentlemen approaches the window to re assure me that he threw that away and was putting new stuff. N I said no worries. I know what was going on so I guess this would be the last time I eat Del taco late night or even for ever. I hope I don't get food poisoning out of this.,wybiFm3G_7FouBx7sKHmVg,0,0,3,JhnhX4rasfFBATTL5WSPOA
