And I asked ""but u guys are open 24/7? You should have all the breads 24/7!"" They were just lazy to make any other bread.  This is the only time I've been to subway and I didn't get it ""my way"" as subway would say.  Very disappointed.",li7D6bK8_p8uHbQXlCNrlQ,0,0,1,-crpRDPBNfCUishDYUIMGA

They sprinkle a little of everything you ask for ... first time ever that I've seen such service.  Especially it being subway.  They have 4 girls on staff and all tables are dirty, filthy. And they don't seem pleasing at all.  They look miserable working.  Half ass everything. I rarely post negative reviews however this was just horrible.",HydOxLMDk6yEV0PT8HVYLQ,0,0,1,EY4O_qtkpkfLHRyGTK2OeQ

Clean, bright atmosphere.
Good, fresh subs. They got the order right
They offer combo meals (sandwich w chips) with drinks- I like their Fuze green tea with honey.
They also have yummy cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, white chocolate macadamia nut).",nr2QuEyY_ZKicxnF4eCmLQ,1,1,4,lRgA7WnFBKozTTI5fdca6w
