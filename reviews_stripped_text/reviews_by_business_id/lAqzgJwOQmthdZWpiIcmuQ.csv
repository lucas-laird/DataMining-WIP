My mom ordered a salad and they didn't even have a fork, one of the basic necessities in a restaurant. They microwaved this ladies pizza and turned it to rubber. They microwaved My sandwich AFTER they put the vegetables, that's common sense the sandwich was rubbery and my dad and I keep making jokes about it.",gce05XEY8uqn_gZIscU25A,0,0,1,Mpt9S-fl41kgMNzn3jxGVQ

The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! 

Needless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location.",Mxhyti32VQVow0Y2bqj91g,0,0,2,xm8VxcCBwbRZZBbcDo0mwg

I love subway, well actually I love subs no matter where they're from but subway is different, their sandwiches are supposedly healthy since the franchise is own by a bunch of doctors and if doctors know what's good for you then subway is the way to go but that's actually what kept me away for a while until I realized that it was  just a marketing  gimmick and That you can find unhealthy food with awesome taste like anywhere else  and it was then when I became a subway regular. My favorite is the Italian BMT with extra pepperoni, pepper Jack cheese and mayonnaise on white bread.  mmm mmm so good! Heart attack grill's got nothing on you babe! But if that's not you and you prefer something healthy you can certainly find that at subway, and here's the list.....

The ""brunette"" girl who made my sandwich was very nice very sweet very professional she look like she actually liked her job. She made the sandwiches very neat because sometimes they're just thrown together but that wasn't the case here. This location is right by my house and this was the first time I've been there.

3870400,2014-01-11,0,lAqzgJwOQmthdZWpiIcmuQ,"1 star for being open late. 1 star for nice people working there. No stars for food. Very skimpy on the meat and veggies. Basically got bread sandwiches with a little bit of meat and a few veggies. I guess that why they can get away with only charging $5 for a footlong. Pastrami melt was nasty. The meat that was on it was rubbery. Got about 10 black olives on a footlong buffalo chicken. Asked for mayo on the cheesesteak. Ran out of mayo in the squeeze bottle, so instead of getting another bottle of mayo, they just squeezed some light mayo on it. If I wanted light mayo, I would of asked for it. Steak sub ha nooo flavor either. Got a root beer out of the fountain. BIB must have been out of syrup. Started driving up the road and took a sip. Tasted like straight carbonated water.",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,0,0,2,rbb8rJkRJrk4axTotWbJBg
3909049,2015-07-06,7,lAqzgJwOQmthdZWpiIcmuQ,"This location is my Subway of choice when in Las Vegas. Plenty of parking, cool inside, great service and never had an issue with food quality.

Subway has sandwiches for everyone. If you are looking for something healthy, make your favorite sandwich into a salad. If you dont mind calories, then there is plenty for you as well. Then there are those half way sandwiches, like the forest black ham sandwich that is delicious yet the foot long has 720 calories. 

I would like to see Subway take their food to the next level by no longer using GMO ingredients, give organic options and buy locally grown produce. This seems to be the trend among the new, educated and healthier consumers.",QdfFtp430K_-BP1GTPNnDg,11,15,4,-Xrr67lhbbKV-DBAwTwAuA

I walk in she doesn't even greet me like ""welcome to subway"" instead I feel like she doesn't  want to be here. Then this guy who is helping me, just like the rest, is too quiet.

I love banana peppers and lettuce I didn't have to ask a bunch of times to get it. They usually just drop a very thin layer of all. 

I can't stand eating at a dirty place. You'd never know how they handle the food, if the place is messy. This subway is clean and the service is great.",3yPrXlvbECGKHSZTy9usWA,1,0,4,9PPbSawcynU_TywJBkGIMA

   The store is clean. That's good and all. But they should pay enough attention to the customer as wiping the counter.

   What about the featured sub they will be promoting in May? Very sloppy. Two napkins are insufficient.

  Lesson learned. I will pay closer attention to advertisement signs at businesses. Even at fast food places.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,1,0,2,7CI401NgrgmuqGmlN_c-RA

And it all worked out, because, I didn't like the way she was making my sandwich anyway.  She acted like she was rationing out the ingredients.

There is a plethora of them springing up on every corner and no need to travel more than a block to get to any of them. Located next to the Starbucks on the corner of LV and Blue Diamond, it was close to where I picked up a friend. 

I did not want bar food, so after she got her order, I picked up a Veggie Delite on 9 grain honey out. The food is similar to the others across the board. Maybe the veggies are not as fresh, but they have a wide selection. I like the one near Bachi Burger more because the place is better lit, the produce is more vibrant, they pack my sandwiches with all the toppings, and the employees are more astute to their customers request.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,3,S-ZQNxhdJdoBVl4k3Cj1zg

Getting a sandwich should not take 30 mins.
