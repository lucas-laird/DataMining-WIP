For newcomers the ""All-American"" and ""Full Montagu"" are a must but if you like spicy the ""Caribbean Jerk"" is where it's at!  Salads are excellent as well and if you have access to a microwave, definitely heat up their pastries before eating them.

This franchise will start to be seen more and more at a quicker rate, fast food needs to take a healthier route like this place does so well.

1229999,2013-01-25,0,Ffhe2cmRyloz3CCdRGvHtA,"Came here for lunch with my husband this past Tuesday. This Earl of Sandwich location is located in the Palm's Casino food court. There is plenty of seating and free wifi from Earl of Sandwich (total score, especially since the majority of hotels on the strip do not offer free wifi). 

Anyways, this was our very 1st time ever experiencing Earl of Sandwich. Ever since I found out about this place, I knew I wanted to come here. I am so glad to come to this location instead of the one on the strip because I can imagine the one on the strip is probably more populated, which meals there would be longer lines. But anyways, when we arrived here around 1 pm, there was no line and we were greeted by the manager who took our order. We didn't know what we wanted so the manager suggested their new chicken pesto sandwich. We also decided to order a chicken salad. Since my husband and I wanted a light lunch, he was able to split our chicken salad into 2 bowls and cut our sandwich in half. He also asked if we wanted our salad dressing to be mixed or put on the side (truly love when restaurants/ eateries do that), which of course we got on the side (healthier and prefer not to have my lettuce swimming in dressing). I also impulsely picked up a brownie sandwich filled with peanut butter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas-4?select=qKJv1RCGZ7LPr2ixpdyN8w#JAUr5KroaCtKuztbL0FgLg) right at the register.

We didn't wait too long before our order was ready. We both enjoyed our salad and our sandwich. The pesto sauce was very flavorful and a nice combination with the chicken and bread. The salad and sandwich we split was actually a perfect potion for lunch. The brownie we split was also just the right amount of sweetness (not too sweet at all) and a good portion to share with someone. 

Overall, pricing for this place is very reasonable and comparable to other gourmet sandwich eateries (like Caprioitti's) and delicious sandwiches that are memorable and worth talking about. Oh and I love that the food court this place is located in is smoke free (who would want a side of carcinogenic toxins with your meal?).",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,1,0,5,yl6UxpNZtT3_r37c3_BhNw

They offer a range of different sandwiches (hot and cold), as well as salads, wraps, and soups. 

They are popular for their hot sandwiches, mainly ""The Original 1762"" as well as ""The Full Montagu""

The Original 1762 - $6.49 - Roasted beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce. More traditional style of sandwich. Like a Arby's sandwich on crack. Nice toasted and warm bread, tender roasted beef. A little ""plainer"" than the other sandwiches they offer but it is still delicious. The horseradish sauce adds a nice little kick (not too much, not like the pain in your nose kick) 

The Full Montagu - Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce. Probably their most popular sandwich people usually get. Two different kinds of meat and cheeses, as well as veggies (to make you less guilty) and a light mustard sauce. Two different meats give a plethora of different textures and flavors, as well as the swiss and cheddar gives an extra added flavor (that the original was ""lacking""). Veggies help add a fresh crispness to the full flavors of the meat and cheeses while maybe taming the slight guilt you have for eating this, making you feel a little ""healthier"" because you picked one with veggies too. 

Overall, good place, still have yet to have the chance to try the other sandwiches yet. Would love to. Prices are really good considering their locations within casinos, and the size is not bad. 1 full sandwich fills me for breakfast.

These sandwiches might be a little small, but they pack quite a punch of taste! I usually eat 1 1/2 to 2 sandwiches every time I go. My personal favorites and recommendations are the Italian and the Hawaiian. I love the bread! It's always nice and fresh, and they toast it just enough so that the bread is a little crunchy when you bite into it. The bread also has a little bit of a chewy texture, similar to that of a french or sourdough bread. The ingredients they put into their sandwiches are fresh as well, and they're in the appropriate proportions. No one ingredient is too strong or too much that it masks the flavors of everything else. 

I would definitely visit again because it's a quick and light meal. It's also easy on the wallet for being in Vegas.

Tip: Order extra mustard sauce if you are even kind of a fan of mustard. I'm not a huge mustard fan but I like extra sauce on all my sandwiches and this was a great choice.

At 2:30 in the morning there was a line! How crazy is that? It's just a sandwich joint! Yeah, no. This place is awesome. I got a Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich and my husband got a chicken Caesar wrap. They were $6.49 each, which really isn't much more than Subway. Wow, they were good! Now I see why there was a line! OK, that and the fact that they were the only place open 24 hours. :)

Today we went to the one at The Palms food court. I got the same sandwich and my husband got the Tuna Melt. Mine was still great, but his was way better. A tuna melt? Mind blowingly delicious? Who knew?

So in an effort to find the nearest location to our home in suburban Phoenix, we checked their website. No locations in Arizona! Only two in Nevada! Luckily we've been to both and they're awesome. 

So take my advice. If you ever run across an Earl of Sandwich, take the time and stop for a bite. They make sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, kid-friendly items, baked goods, and breakfast items.

To top it off I paired it with the broccoli cheddar soup. Yum! Cheesy goodness with lots of broccoli. It was really hot but worth the burnt tongue. I would recommend the small size, even though it looks too tiny.

Prior to ever being an active Yelper, Earl of Sandwich was a goto spot for me whenever I was in Vegas. After my friend's MMA event at the Palms, I was hungry and busted out my phone to use the good ol' trusty Yelp app. Low and behold, my eyes lit up with excitement after launching the ""Nearby"" feature. Earl of Sandwich had a location in the Palms! My happy arse rushed over quickness to get me a sandwich!

There was only a couple of people in line when I got here. Let me note that the time was around 1am. It didn't take me long to browse the menu, since it was very simple. I felt like being adventurous with my sandwich and went with the jerk chicken sandwich. Once placing my order, I was handed a pager/buzzer. I guess having a pager/buzzer is a common thing here in Vegas.

Ten minutes later my pager/buzzer goes off. I was handed my sandwich nicely wrapped in the Earl of Sandwich foil on serving tray. When I sat down and gripped my sandwich, I could tell it was fresh out the oven. It was still hot. The melody of the jerk chicken, provolone cheese, and sauces paired very well with the soft, warm, and lightly crisped wheat bread. There was no doubt I was going to inhale the sandwich.

It was after midnight when my show got out and I was happy about their 24 hour service. It was not easy to decided which sandwich to get so I bought two - caprese and Full Montague. I was told the full Montague was a thick filled sandwich that would feed a starving movie goer and the caprese was a satisfying light midnight snack. 
SADLY  the full Montague did not deliver the hype of a full sandwich. There was barely any roast beef or turkey but  IT was heavy on tomatoes and mustard. The bread was delicious, but Meh. I would've preferred a deli sandwich over this.  However, the caprese is what saved this review from a three star, it delivered on taste. I had shared these sandwiches with a family member and I had halved both sandwiches, I wanted all of it. The mozzarella was fresh and smooth, the tomatoes sliced to perfection with basil layered throughout. Now the best part - Balsamic Vinaigrette. It was slightly sweet, but it was nice, balancing out the peppery bite of basil and the light taste of cheese.
All in all I would defiantly return for a caprese sandwich, and maybe at a different venue try another type of sandwich. The reviews for the Earl on the strip were much higher and I see why. I would like to say I was greeted with a smile, and the sandwich maker was very polite.

I had the chicken sandwich with avocado and bacon. I thought it was great! I would def get it again. The quality of chicken was much better than other fast food sandwich companies. 

The bread was tasty too. 

If you are fed up with the prices for food on the strip, you'll love this place. 

Negatives: you have drive over to the Palms, find a place to park and walk inside which isn't very convenient at times.

2741701,2014-01-02,10,Ffhe2cmRyloz3CCdRGvHtA,"Mr. Earl........you and me got some talking to do.

First off, don't get me wrong, I like your sandwiches. I havnt had one yet that I don't like. My favorite is the Full Montague, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. Hard not to keep picking this every time because everything put together tastes so good.

I like the fact that this location and the Planet Hollywood location is 24 hours. I also like the fact that if you sign up for the email club, you get a free sandwich on your birthday along with other offers.

With all that I said, the first thing that pops into my head any time this place is mentioned...........is the price. Damn Earl! 6 bucks for a little sandwich? That's without any chips or drink. To satisfy my hunger, I have to order 2 sandwiches. So 12 bucks for a footlong. Sorry, but 1 sandwich with chips and a drink aint gonna cut it for me. 

So one size coupled with only one kind of bread. What's wrong with wheat for those health conscious folks? Sourdough sounds good too!

So Mr. Earl, I like your sandwiches, but I am not gonna go out of my way to tell every living soul but when I do, I will make sure to let them know about said statements above. It's up to them if they want a sandwich and if they agree with me or not. Please get back to me Mr. Earl if there are any changes based on this review. Until then, I will continue to whine any time your establishment is brought up in any conversation.

2880300,2013-01-15,4,Ffhe2cmRyloz3CCdRGvHtA,"Everyone and their mamas always rave about Earl of Sandwich, so I finally decided to see what the big deal was all about. I decided to go to the Palms location since it seemed more convenient (and I assumed there wouldn't be that big of a difference in quality). There was a huge Earl of Sandwich sign right near one of the entrances, but it took us awhile to realize that Earl of Sandwich was in the food court area, right next to the movie theater. We got the club, the tomato soup and a caprese salad. For some reason I thought the sandwich was going to be bigger and messier since most people I know have it when they are drunk. I was surprised that the sandwich was more reasonably sized and not ginormous like Bay Area sandwiches that I'm used to (Mr. Pickles, Ike's, Little Lucca's). Sandwich had a good crisp and good flavor, but I did think it was a bit over-priced in comparison to other aforementioned sandwich places I've frequented. There wasn't too much meat and for $7/sandwich, I guess I just expected more. The tomato soup maybe was also a bit hyped up for me because it did seem overly salted and just like spaghetti sauce.  I'm glad we ordered the salad since the soup and sandwich definitely weren't enough for two people. I'll try it out again if I'm in the area or have guests that are curious about it, but I don't think I'll go out of my way again to order... and I really shouldn't wait so long and let so much hype build when it comes to food places, oh well.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,4,4,3,Agv2swqI5jW6GdTBzsdjiQ

Finally, a place I wanted to checkout has made a location that way easier for the Las Vegas local to venture too without making a one mile walk. 

Earls is located at the entrance of the  Brendan Theaters, and this hole in the wall is the perfect place for a small meal before a movie, or a night at Rain.    It's a lot smaller than the Plant hollywood location, but still breaks out quality sandwiches.

This was my first visit to this business, and I was impressed with the Hawaiian.  This creation had nice chunks of chicken that's blended well with the ham, pineapple, and cheese. The BBQ sauce was a nice touch with this sandwich.   Great Sandwich, but still not in the class of my all time favorite, the Hot Ham, and cheese with Mushroom from Magoo Pizza (too bad, Magoo's went out of business in Hawaii)  but someone needs to copy that sandwich.

The sandwiches are pretty small. Actually, I could woof two of these things down with no problem. Why don't you do that, Mike?

Again, I'm so glad you asked...

The prices are borderline rediculous. They are roughly $6-$8 a sandwich! (of course that also does not include chips, a drink, etc.) Ouch!  I understand it's located in a casino. I understand it's in a food court. But....damn!

I really want to like EOS, but at the current prices I just don't see myself  making any repeat visits. There are just way too many great sub/sandwich shops in the city that will give you a great sandwich at a much better price point.

Great sandwiches even though not very big. 

The soup is decent but also way to small. The tomato soup is filled with soggy crouton I can't believe they do it. They even pore the soup over the croutons to really make it terrible so ask for them on the side. 

The salad bar is okay but not very quick process to make it. 

They will hand you a sandwich is a bag that is ALWAYS greasy. The bag handles are guaranteed to be slimy when it's handed to you, I just don't get whey they do that. 

I'll certainly be back again and recommend to try them out. 

They can get busy at times at this Palms Casino location but usally pretty darn fast. It is not as busy as the PH location. The food comes out fast and is warm and toasted.

I got a half Earl's Cobb which for years was my favourite. No longer do you get cubes of swiss and cheddar. Instead it's a light sprinkle of shredded yellow cheese (no flavor). Add to that they no longer toss the salad in the dressing. Instead you get a small cup to do it yourself. Fine I suppose for healthy eating, but the small container doesnt leave much room for shaking for maximum dressing coverage.   

Along with the salad I got a half Full Montegu. I tasted none of the delicious mustard they normally use...and honestly that is the best part.

Also, the ""order here"" and ""pick up here"" lines are very close together. While placing my order I had to move out of the way and stop placing my order twice so that other customers could get their food. They need to really make some adjustments as far as where people should place an order and pick one up. 

The girl at the register who took my order was very friendly and polite. She had trouble getting one of the coupon codes to scan and after she asked the manager for help several times,  was finally able to get it on her own. I felt bad that the manager was ignoring her and talking on her cel phone instead. They had a promotion going on called ""Dine with the Royal Couple"" that offered 2 sandwiches not regularly on the menu. The 2 sandwiches were the ""Avocado BLT"" and ""Pastrami Reuben"" both priced at $6.99, but I used the BOGO and ordered 1 of each. I left off the kraut and thousand island dressing and just requested mustard be put on it. I usually would love having the sandwich the way it came, but hubby doesn't like the other stuff so we just customized it a bit since we were sharing each sandwich. The Pastrami Reuben was very good, but skimpy on the meat. Hubby would have to eat 2 of these to get full. The Avocado BLT was also very good except some bacon pieces were too fatty while the other pieces has great meaty flavor. The bacon was cooked fresh so kudos for that. All the sandwiches are made fresh to order here. They were generous with the fresh avocado too. So for the free sandwich from the birthday coupon I ordered a ""Full Montagu"" priced at $6.49, but of course the awesome coupon took care of that! The Full Montagu has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, tomato and mustard sauce. I had them leave off the lettuce. So with everything I said was in the Full Montagu you would expect something pretty big right? Nope! This sandwich was very good, but again just too skimpy on what they put between the bread. With the coupons we did get full though! I do like that the sandwiches are generally under $6.49 so even if hubby needs to order 2 to get full, it really isn't any more in price then ordering a burger and fries at a average restaurant. 

Earl of Sandwich also offers a variety of salads, wraps and artisan soups (soup selection changes daily). They also have sides like coleslaw, potato salad, pasta salad and chips. Breakfast is served daily until 11 am and they use fresh cracked eggs! There is a kids menu and when it comes to dessert Earl of Sandwich has a lot of tasty looking sweets, including brownies made with Ghirardelli chocolate.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,25,21,4,r-IYFYV5L_O5-Ob3cxTTug

Pros: Breakfast sammies for $3.99. I ate an egg white, avocado and cheddar sandwich three days in a row. And once paired it with tomato soup. ($3.49)

Refillable drinks ($2.99) and coffees ($2.29)

Choco chip cookies: $1.99

Service was always fast and friendly. You get a pager that buzzes when your food is ready, which, by the way, scared the bejeesus outta me the first time it went off in my hand!

They also had decent sammies, their claim to fame is their hot sandwiches, I was a definite fan of the vegetarian one, but the boy didn't love his buffalo wrap. Another con would be that the amount of avocado on the breakfast sandwich changed daily for the two of us. First day was generous avocado day, second day, not so much. 

All in all, you can't go wrong with the Earl. Well priced, decent food that will fill your tummy, keep you satisfied, and might even encourage you to gamble away another $20 in the penny slots since you got a good value for your meal.",YrkX1LTMd1CpivCxjiJUpA,2,1,4,3lDjl4bpNqod5RBSUpBiRQ

I tried the Montague, The Original, and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. Out of all 3, I liked the Caribbean the most! Very flavorful, not too spicy. Will get that next time, and try others, probably at the Disneyland location since it's closer.

Got the Full Montagu and it was small and expensive not unlike Erik's deli (which is satisfying). It is hot deli meat, which is good (better than cold), with a cheesy mustardy Arby's kind of sauce. Wheat bread toasty Quizno style. I found nothing special about it and can think of Sprout's deli sandwich, which has more fillings and costs just about right... and I pop that baby into the toaster, which hits the spot!

This Earl was a big part of pulling me out of my myopic ways. As a generally-trying-really-hard-to-be-health-conscious eater,  it can be hard to find decent options when short on time. So when I was headed out but needed a quick bite, I swung by the food court and stumbled across some really decent and diverse options. I settled on the Caprese sandwich at Earl. Wow!

Lay out was confusing for me when I walked in. Register is by the front left counter and LED menu screen is right above it. Service was alright.

They offer variety of sandwiches and wraps with different ingredients. Each sandwiches are around $6 for 6 inch and you are offered a choice of either wheat bread or white bread. I got to try four sandwiches from their simple and easy to read menu: 

The Full Montagu- My favorite out of all I tried. It comes with roast beef, turkey, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese with mustard sauce. Liked how it came with lots of ingredients which made it more filling. 4/5

The Original- It's a roast beef sandwich with cheddar and horseradish sauce. Reminded me of Arby's roast beef sandwich, but not as meaty. Too basic in my opinion. 3/5

Chipotle Chicken Avocado- Had high hope for this since I love the combination of chicken and avocado, and I also really like chipotle sauce in general. Not enough sauce + avocado and came out tasting flat. 2/5

The Earl's Club- Has turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato with their sandwich sauce. Nothing memorable about this one. 2/5

In conclusion, sandwiches did not meet my expectation based on other rave reviews. Being a Subway fanatic, I would expect more from a $6 sandwich when I can get a foot long from Subway for the same price. Subway has my heart and soul for their always fresh ingredients therefore Earl of Sandwich is just ""A-OK"" for me.

The potato had some good flavors. The jalapenos are a nice touch. The potato is good sized and filled me up. The issue with the potato was the complete lack of chicken. I am not sure there was any on it. I did not have it in me to go back down there to correct the issue.

With numerous restaurants by almost every celebrity chef on the globe, there really doesn't seem to be much need for a simple sandwich joint at Planet Hollywood- except that it's SO INSANELY GOOD. I never seem to grow tired of this place, and will even go out of my way to drive to the Strip and walk half a mile through the shops just to get my fix. 

It's budget-conscious (under $10 for a filling sandwich and a drink- they even serve wine and beer!) and 24 hours, so incredibly convenient after a long night of partying/gambling on the Strip (we've all found ourselves completely ravished after stumbling out of Marquee at 4am). Even better, it's only a stone's throw away from the Cosmo, so cheap, delicious eats are only a short jaunt across the bridge if you're leaving the club! 

I have yet to try a sandwich I didn't like from this spot, and I've sampled pretty much the entire menu over the course of 4 years. The bread is by far the yummiest I've had in my existence, and I'm a big fan of carbs, so that's saying a lot. Top of my list of ""Most Savory"" would probably be the Holiday Turkey, the Original, and the Hawaiian. The desserts are pretty yummy as well, and it's obvious that everything is baked fresh daily. They do have wraps, salads, and gluten-free options also if you're looking for a healthier route (but WHY would you be?!?). 

Plenty of seating, great prices, convenient location to the Strip, this will always be one of my favorite places to grab a bite.",RrS5PUJ63Hdn4sk2pc9Edw,1,1,5,O4F5sBv0P2CDnTQNNS5smQ

Since The Palms is across the street from my house I was too excited to take my boyfriend there and share the amazingness of their food, But nope. Total disappointment. The location in The Palms is a franchise, and they suck. I give the review average, because if you didn't know better, it would be decent. Ironic how you can the same recipe and still no. The Original is roast beef, cheddar cheese, and horseradish all that I crave when I am there. They have an A1 sauce with a blue label that sits on all of the tables (in Planet Hollywood), seems to be a staple of the restaurant. I dipped my sandwich in it and it was astounding. When I asked for the sauce in The Palms location, they said they didn't carry that. huh? ummm. no special sauce.. weird. Then the horseradish was barely there and the meat wasn't the same. It was just different and subpar compared to what I had already tasted. 
I go back every now and again but still not the same. A few nights ago I went to Earl of Sandwich in Planet Hollywood... It was 520am... it was amazingness.

Jeff ordered a turkey sandwich.  He offered me a bit, but I didn't try it.  He ate the whole thing, which is unusual for him.  
Everything is made fresh.  We waited for just a few minutes.  We were given one of those light up drink coasters, but we didn't have to wait more than just a few minutes for our order.

I'll usually have the same thing over & over too. TUNA MELT & TOMATO BISQUE. Earl has a two-fer deal too where it's half sandwich & soup for $7.95 (for all you newbies out there)...but that's just not enough for me or my appetite. 

I usually dip the tuna melt in the tomato soup for some dripping extra flavor or get some Tabasco & Mustard to dip my sandwich in, but even by itself the melt is literally a MELT with provolone cheese so hot & melty that I've now noticed how many times I've just written ""melt"". 

Also, for some reason, I don't know what they put in the tomato bisque...but the croutons that are in there when served make it all the more ADDICTING.

I think my heart skipped a beat when I found out there was an earl of sandwich inside, granted there's a sign right outside but I was wearing a baseball cap to even notice it... but anyways...

Surprisingly it wasn't packed. The service was quick and the cashier was very attentive. Everyone was busy, the place was neat and clean. Usually it takes a while with places that have the pager callers but this place was fast!

I got the Earl club and it was delicious, earl sauce wasn't over bearing and just blended perfectly, not to mild or high, just a little above medium taste. Lettuce, tomatoes were fresh and crunchy, meat wasn't salty and had that authentic turkey taste, bacon was also crispy and wasn't soggy or soft. I definitely know what my choice is from now on when I go to the Palms. The best thing is that the sandwiches are wrapped for...well you know, in case you wanna eat it somewhere else later ^^. 

Downside still is that there isn't really any bread options but the bread is perfectly toasted just right to where you won't even really care anymore. I didn't see any hot sauce but it's my fault for not asking and I wouldn't put tobasco bottles on the tables where people can easily take'em and it's really not a problem at all, besides these sandwiches taste great with or without the hot sauce.

I knew I should of stopped by again before I left to go home, i'm starting to feel hungry again. Going to this place is way more convenient than going to P.H., parking and walking for a while to get to E.o.S. but either way, whether it be P.H. or at the Palms it's worth it and you might as well get 3 or 4 sandwiches while you're at it.

The sandwiches are extremely well priced (between $5 and $7), but they are not particularly big.  I generally accompany the sandwich with some sort of snack.

My boyfriend who used to live in  FL kept raving about it before I ever tried them and I was like, ""geez, it's just a sandwich shop"". But damn. We finally went to the one @ The Palms and now I wish it was them instead of Subway's at every corner. I think for me what sets them apart is the amount/ quality of the filling, but more than anything, especially the BREAD.

I'm usually just ""meh"" with sandwiches, I'd usually go for a rice dish or fried chicken or anything else over a plain old sandwich, but since we first tried it I've contemplated with increasing regularity if I can drive from my office in Mountain's Edge to the Palms and back within my one hour lunch break... it's that good. It's mostly the bread. Most sandwich places have a this light, cheap-feeling, so-so crust bread (think Subway or Firehouse subs... sorry, fans out there). Even Capriotti's could do better except they microwave their hot sandwiches and you end up with a soggy crust. Quizno's is the closest to their bread but E. of S.'s bread is slightly dense, with a outer crust that stays just crisp enough for your teeth to crackle through but not so hard that it tears up the roof of your mouth (Yes you know what I'm talking about, we've all been there). SO FREAKING GOOD. My only gripe is that I wish they offered fries, but then again it's a sandwich shop not a burger joint.

Pros:
It's like a toasted quizno's sub but tastier with better quality meat

Cons: 
Smaller than a quizno's

It took two full sandwiches to fill up the tank which brings you to about $13, near $14 with tax...and you're pretty much at footlong levels with 2 sandwiches...another drawback is I didn't feel like you could really add any ingredients you wanted to sort of ""get your value"" if you're paying $7 for 7 inches of sandwich (unlike quizno's).

I opted to go to the location at the Palms because I wanted to avoid the madness of the Strip. So...IMO Earl of Sandwich is not what it's hyped up to be. 

CAPRESE ($6.49?): Heavy on the mozzarella and like, 3 pieces of basil. The wheat bread was overly toasted and would've been better on white bread (my bad). An annoying gnat kept assaulting me and my sandwich for the better of the part meal (until I squished him, Mwah Haha!). 

CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO ($6.49?): My husband said his sandwich was just okay, and that he wouldn't come back again. My thoughts exactly. 

CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE ($1.99): The best part of the meal! Loaded with chocolate chips and still soft. Definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.

SERVICE: Manager didn't smile, but our food was ready in less than 5 minutes! 

ATMOSPHERE: Earl of Sandwich is located in the food court at the Palms. There were teenagers everywhere! I attribute it to coming on a Monday, which happens to coincide with Brendan theaters $5 movie days. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Nah. It irks me that 1) the sandwiches are only 6 inches; and 2) combos are not offered = everything (drinks & chips) are purchased separately. :/ Plus, the sandwiches are very forgettable.

Located across from the golden arches in a far less fanciful space than its Planet Hollywood sibling I really had not planned to visit Earl of Sandwich on Saturday morning, but when my friend from 24 Seven suggested she was stopping by to pick up lunch for later I decided ""why not?,"" a pair of shared sandwiches and three fresh baked sweets each making me wonder why I'd waited so long to give the Earl a go.  Another 24/7 operation with offerings including sandwiches, soups, salads, and wraps plus a later day menu of pastas and more it was just after 7:15am when we arrived at the small storefront and each opting for a sandwich that was subsequently split and swapped I bid my friend adieu before sitting down to eat, my first bite of the Hawaiian BBQ crunching through golden bread to discover notes of bright citrus overlying tender proteins with a smoky finish well balanced by the brine of Swiss.  No less compelling than its island themed counterpart yet far more comforting in the midst of a Las Vegas summer it was only after finishing my half of the 'cue that I turned to the Holiday Turkey and although more of a 'fork and knife' affair than a proper hand-held I will simply say that there may be no better sandwich in Sin City, the cornbread stuffing a perfect accoutrement to rich gravy and briny bird while the cranberry jam lends subtle sweetness at the end.  Every bit worthy of its substantial praise, particularly for a 'chain,' it was finally in a few baked goods that my meal would finish and although neither cookie will win any awards the oft celebrated brownie would indeed prove a worthy bite, the soft and smooth center with crispy edges as good as any I've had in recent memory and all the better given the fact that it was free (with signup for the fan club.)",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,3,4,J6idCe5KUdc8b4YS2nZKIg

They really make the sandwich really well with non of the filling falling off. They also do not go light on the sauce either so if you ask for extra sauce you may want them to put it on the side like I do so you can have a fairly neat meal.

My boyfriend really enjoyed his sandwich. He kept repeating himself, saying how good it was. Usually, he doesn't say much about his food, so for him to expressed to me that he liked it a lot was a good sign.

The roast beef sandwich was good and not to red for me. The meat on the sandwich was very tender and had a nice flavor to it. Sometimes roast beef can have a metallic & irony flavor to it, especially if it is a cheaper cut of meat.

Their menu is a bit pricey but it is inside a casino food mall so it is too be expected. Overall, they are A-Okay and I would return but not in my regular rotation.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,4,2,3,YhYLJREbKO1oOHsBm2TBxA

I wasn't able to get my favorite which is the chipotle chicken avocado with bacon.
They have a wrap that bears the same name and I was ignorant enough to order that thinking it was what I wanted.. Shame on me :(
The wrap tasted weird though... I think it's too citrusy and clashes with the bacon.

The tomato soup was the same though and tasted great! 

Customer service was good and food came out fast!",g3KSdl_F4oFQ3Q3s4TcnmA,1,0,3,gEfc9J5zOKk-B1aox7Ac_Q

Overall this place is good but from all the reviews i was expecting greatest sandwich of all time type stuff.  I guess that's why sometimes hype can be just that.",rzIy4JY0QxnOSrgnAQwdoA,0,0,3,74eVQNZk-2DV61EMVwgQpw

The service was very friendly here and quite efficient as well. They were pretty busy, but they were still able to get everyone served in a good amount of time. When I finally got my order and headed out, the cashier shouted to me ""Happy Birthday."" So nice of her to remember. This is a good addition to the Palms food court.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,6,4,9tDk-0T5hyzXEICZOUG92Q
5965727,2017-01-07,0,Ffhe2cmRyloz3CCdRGvHtA,Still arguably the best sandwich EVER.. 2 star because of a manager (Chris) who wouldn't honor our yelp(eat 24) order. We placed it and confirmed it. When I got there he said they don't honor it and turned me away. I called eat 24 and they took care of it and gave me credit. Amazing sandwiches but terrible service. I kinda of wondered why this location isn't as packed as the planet Hollywood one,HfQFfBbhw1K8b3-gr0iXeQ,0,0,2,qkEjbZyYtPL6WHleL4fM4w
