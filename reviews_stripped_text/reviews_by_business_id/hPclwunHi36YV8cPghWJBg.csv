Short story short, they closed the restaurant and never again did we find that same taste in another Thai food dish. All that changed today when I order from Thai food to go. It brought back so many memories and I was transported back to that round table we used to sit and enjoy that delicious chicken fried rice every week. This is authentic Thai food with a very warming family traditional taste to it. Will be eating here many more times from here on out. Loved it!!!",aT9nUrNXniWFS4FGB8y_yw,0,0,5,LsmhiX_HC35Jz9IjS4fnyg

We had the Drunken fried rice, Pad Thai and Golden Nest Noodle (Mee Krob) along with Thai tea. The dishes were excellent in every respect. The food was fresh, the quantities large, and everything was served promptly, courteously, and piping hot.

305120,2014-01-20,0,hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg,"The staff was incredibly friendly and smiling and helpful and seemed like genuinely nice people.

They took extra efforts to decipher and look up a food item i was curious about that i couldn't remember the name in Thai language. Then they took it a step further and translated it for me into English.  Pok bong (sp?) is apparently morning glory. Maybe the stems are safe to eat (though I've heard stories about the flowers).

The food was prepared incredibly fast. awesome.

I'm eating some tom yum soup right now and it is nice. honestly it has a hint more salt then i would like but almost every soup at every restaurant i have ever eaten at except one place tastes a little salty to me. so perhaps I'm just sensitive to this flavor. The lemongrass tangy goodness is divine and the vegetable stir fry is quite fresh and crunchy and veggies are cooked to a nice bright green. I'm liking the papaya salad too. 

I ordered a 5 spiciness on a scale of 1-10 thinking that Thai standard would be a bit hotter, so I'd better hold back a bit. but I'm not finding it very spicy. so i think this spiciness scale is well fixed for an American pallet. I have a lot of flavor in my food  and just the slightest hint of spice. no after burn to speak of.

the restaurant dining area is small and uncomplicated. There is a pretty mural of boat people on the wall and some Thailand t-shirts. There are only a few tables available. The ambiance to me it is more of a convenience eating space for patrons because there is a sign that says no bathrooms.. so that means it is strictly a take out place for me.. i prefer to be able to wash my hands before/after eating. The second half of the restaurant's name is ""to go"" however, so i was actually surprised to find a dining area at all.",XSCf9uT3ZGKU-gF79UFTNQ,0,0,4,6R2B5ROa4lnvZ5eSG71vzQ

Normally I go to Archi's or I go to Satay but this is closer to me.  So I place my order for panang curry w/beef in the lunch special and get an egg roll and wow it was only $6.55.  I get there and the place looks somewhat raggedy but the woman at the front desk was super friendly.  I get my food, awkwardly she doesn't give me change but I make my way back to the office.  Here's where the issues begin.

The serving size of the curry was so small.  Like not just lunch special small but like ""am I really supposed to get full from this small"".  I ordered a spice level 5 (on a scale from 1-10) and it was like an 8.  I can handle spice and I like spice but that was excessive since I wasn't expecting it.  The beef was akin to beef jerky and was boiled with 0 flavor.  At Satay they have shredded beef integrated into the panang to give it a different texture and and great flavor.  This tasted like nothing.  The curry was ok in flavor but very soupy.  The egg roll was random in flavor with no appetizing dipping sauce.  The fake sweet chili sauce had vinegar (weird).   Overall I had a flavor profile in my head that this didn't meet and I was still hungry. Blah",-4iHaD2KxbdEJQ964RS-9w,0,0,2,dmSanSuJxRMOvdO8dC-sZw

The soup I got has chicken and pork, which I don't eat. I called the restaurant to ask what was in the soup, and ask why this soup was so different from regular tom yum when the menu didn't mention any differences. Both men I spoke to on the phone spoke over me the entire time I was trying to get answers, until I just got frustrated and let them go because they would not listen to what I had to say.
I also ordered fried shrimp, and when I got them, I found that they were not fully de-veined, which is not okay!

Quick note: FREE iced thai tea with YELP check in and showing the waitress. Strong flavor without the overwhelming sweetness. A little ""too"" much half & half though. 

My friend and I had came here for lunch finally after hearing people raving about this place for a while. 

Prices are VERY good considering the quality you are getting. Lunch specials are $5.95. Typical items on the menu are mostly under $10. Even their specialty fish items are like $12. Wow ! 

My friend had ordered a Green Curry w/ Chicken Lunch Special with fried rice and potsticker and a house vegetable soup. Spicy level 7. - $5.95 - Good spice and flavor. A little strong on the coconut milk. Overall, great combination. The potsticker was nice and crispy. (note you only get one. i dont know about you, but i was kind of surprised LOL). Overall a decent portion size for a lunch special. I was surprised how much curry you get. Usually in other thai restaurants, you get in a smaller bowl (rice bowl size) 

I had ordered a normal Pad See Ew with chicken - $6.79? - good portion size. The dish was cooked very well. Lots of chinese broccoli flowers and stems. Noodles were cooked perfectly with a good amount of flavoring. Noodles weren't all in small ity-bity pieces. Shows the chef skill in cooking this type of noodle. Good ""wok flavor"" for those who know that term (familiar with a good quality item cooked in a wok). 

Overall, very happy with this experience. Would love to come back again for the same items (like spice level 10 !  ! )  if not try other things. !

My husband and I each had a lunch special. This comes with a soup of the day, which was Hot & Sour soup. Okay, I've had that hundreds of times at Chinese restaurants, never at a Thai restaurant. I would say it had a spice level of about 3-4, noticeable after it builds for a while, but tolerable.
I ordered my Red Curry ""very Mild,"" but not ""zero."" It was spicier than the soup! I made it through eating it, but just barely. 
My husband ordered his dish (can't recall what he had), ""medium.""  I thought they must have gotten our orders mixed up in spiciness. Then I overheard a young man telling his friends that he had the night before ordered a dish spiced to ""4."" (maybe out of 5 instead of 10??) He said he could not eat it, it was so hot.

All this to say, be careful of how you order. Over all, I would say the food is slightly above average Thai restaurant food. The prices are great and they have a Yelp check-in deal to get a free Thai Iced Tea!  The service is friendly. The restaurant is tiny, tiny! 

I would probably try some other restaurants before going back, but I would not say to not try it. You might have a different dish that is terrific.

AWESOME. On a Saturday night at 8pm we were craving thai food but wanted to enjoy some ESPN 30for30 on the couch...delivery was the only option obviously.

I poked around on Yelp and found Thai Food To Go. I figured I would give them a shot. We ordered:

-fresh spring rolls (the non-fried kind)
-thai beef salad
-chicken pad thai
-garlic chicken with brown rice

When the guy on the phone read my total bill I thought he must have left some of the food order off....he claimed my total was $25. Really?? Ooookay. We will see if the food arrives correctly...

The food arrived in about 35 minutes of ordering. Everything was hot, fresh, delicious AND they threw in a free order of the fried spring rolls and a free order of crab ragoon! On top of everything else we ordered I would say $25 (plus a good tip) was well worth it. That order from Satay or Komol would have costed at least $40 or more!

If you know me well enough, you would know that Thai yellow curry has got to be one of my favorite dishes of all time. The combination of sweet and spicy does me in. With that being said, I have this weird thing where I must try different Thai restaurants around town just for their yellow curry. I've tried around 7 different places now and Thai Food To Go has got my vote for the best yellow curry that I have had to date! The flavor is out of this world: there is sweetness in every bite. I'm not crazy about crunchy vegetables in my curry, either, but the veggies in this curry are so soft. It's almost like they slow cooked the curry in order to let the flavor penetrate every part of the dish. 

Anyway, getting away from curry, the place itself is pretty nice. There is a beautiful mural located inside the restaurant depicting some Thai people on a boat out on the water. The employees are very nice and whenever I order through Eat24, my food is always done earlier than anticipated. I've ordered delivery before at my old address as well, so I've been coming here for around 3 years.

Went here last night, and my husband recommended calling ahead of time to order food. I declined that, because I didn't want the food sitting in a box, ... I hate that idea.

The place was empty, and I had no problem getting ahold of a young lady to take my order. It was also done in a decent amount of time. I paid and was on my way. In the matter of the 15 minute drive home, the deep fried catfish was no longer crispy. The container of my duck soup was overflowing when trying to transfer it to a bowl so I could eat it (noodles were packed separate, and the broth was filled to the top and couldn't handle anything being added to it.)

The crab fried rice had no flavor. I was trying to guess the difference between egg and crab....Not a good thing. Naga's crab fried rice has chunks of real crab in it, and is very flavorful....and can have spiciness added to it.

Don't let the name fool you, it's a cozy location with dine in available. The high ratings are entirely justified, everything I've tried here has been great and the prices are extremely reasonable.

CHINESE BROCCOLI WITH CRISPY PORK: So good! Pork is perfectly cooked with a crunchy exterior and moist, juicy interior. Broccoli is tender, sauce is delicious. Would get this again.
CRAB FRIED RICE: This is a gigantic, flavorful portion! Every bite seems to have crab in it, and the mountain of food can easily be split by two or three people. One of the best CFR dishes I've had.
GRILLED SALMON PANANG CURRY: Salmon is on the dry side, curry itself is intense! Plated with green beans, carrots, and broccoli, which was an odd combination that surprisingly worked. 
MANGO STICKY RICE: Classic dessert, good-sized portion, rice is just right and mango was perfectly ripe.

They offer delivery to a 3 mile radius, with only a $15 minimum. Most dishes in the $8-10 range. My only regret is that this place isn't closer to me!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,4,Pxryc6qk0N8Cf2XmwTYgaQ

2208023,2014-05-25,0,hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg,"WOW. I was not expecting such a good joint (even with 4.5 stars on Yelp). What do you think when you hear ""To Go"" in a, Asian restaurant's name? Probably pre-made, oily, salty vats of food scooped up into paper boxes and Styrofoam container accompanied by underwhelming side selections. This is far from that.

Despite the somewhat dilapidated exterior and slightly cheesily decorated interior, there is a lot of character to this small family-run joint. As you walk in, to your left is a mural of a river market in Thailand. To your right on the far wall there are menu items listed with pictures of their specials. The tables and chairs are what you'd expect from a middle-of-the-road restaurant; the tables are sturdy and the chairs look to be fairly new. On the tables are the traditional condiments for Thai food (chili pastes, pickled jalepeño slices, and other spicy yums). The man who was our server, who I assume to be the owner, is a jolly, middle-aged Thai gentleman by the name of Yai(?). What he lacks in his ability to speak English well he certainly makes up for in character. He was very attentive  to my family's table and seemed to make his best effort to make sure we were content. Boy, were we beyond content!

ON TO THE FOOD! What we ordered and their ratings out of 5 stars:

Vegetable Egg Rolls: 3 of 5
- Pretty standard egg rolls. They were good, not great, but they were presented nicely with some sweet and sour sauce and were good enough to be gone by the end of dinner.

Pad Thai with Chicken: 5 of 5
- So, let me start out by saying that I usually don't like pad thai; it just isn't my thing. We got it because it's my parents' favorite. My parents loved it and I loved it. It had the standard vegetables and chopped peanuts, but the sauce and noodles were what made the dish work so well. The noodles were soft but not chewy, and they didn't stick together. The sauce was slightly spicy, because we asked for it that way, but not overwhelming nor bland.

Pad See Eu with Beef: 5 of 5
- Now this is my favorite dish to get at Thai food places. I loved the one they made for me here. The vegetables were slightly crisp, the noodles were nice and chewy, and the beef was tender. One of the biggest problems I have with other places' pad see ews is that there either too much or too little sauce; I didn't have this problem here.

Crispy Pork with Broccoli: 4 of 5
- This dish had a lot of flavor. If you like garlic without it overpowering the dish, this would be something for you.  As with the pad see eu, the broccoli was cooked to perfection. My only issue with this dish is that the pork was a little too chewy/dry for my liking (but maybe that's how it was supposed to be).

Sticky Rice with Mango Slices: 5 of 5
- Just the right amount of sweetness from the mango and coconut milk. The rice had a great texture and went well with the mango. A must try!

Overall, my family was very pleased with it's experience. This is my new favorite Thai food place. We are definitely going to visit again before we leave Vegas.",b6OGeGxfjKJFULSn1OCwiA,2,2,5,F7o21AynDuqY_rTPEWhJUA

My wife, mom and myself visited family one weekend and decided to try this joint out. We dined in. So here's what we had: HK Potstickers, Padthai shrimp, Thai style papaya salad, Pineapple fried rice, Tiger cry beef jerky, Mango and sticky rice. Of course we took leftovers to go. The potstickers I believe is their signature appetizer and was very tasty. Some spice from sriracha on top gave it some kick. Padthai shrimp was awesome! Padthai is my favorite dry noodles to eat in Thailand and people can butcher it. Usually I see restaurants make PadThai too soupy. I can't stand that! It takes a bit of practice to make PadThai from the high heated wok by a flame burner(not electric). Seems like this place has it down. Pineapple fried rice had a good balance of pineapples and flavor but not over powering. My wife was craving that one :). Tiger cry beef jerky and sticky rice was phenomenal. Well seasoned and very tasty! All I needed was a beer to go along with it. It's finger food that I can live by everyday. Thai style papaya salad had a good portion and had the flavor that was use to when I was living in Thailand. I was told their flavors are consistent every time because the ingredients are identical in measurement every time except the amount of heat requested by the customer. As for the finale, the mango sticky rice finished our meal perfectly. Mango wasn't too ripe or brown and the sticky rice had the perfect sweetness from the coconut milk and sesame seeds. 

On top of our great experience there, we observed the amount of orders they were receiving from UberEats going in and out of the place. People apparently loves this place! Spoke to the owner and was told that the orders just keep coming. I'm pretty nosey so I asked the Uber driver and they get orders from here all the time. Locals and visitors.

Discovered the awesome tabletop Fish Sauce which can be included as a condiment in your to-go bag.

West-siders and Hendersonites, it's totally worth the extra distance to eat here if you're hungry for Thai. The value and taste are undeniable.

I've had my food for here a couple of times and thankfully the service was friendly despite the name is not Thai Food FOR HERE. The drinks came quickly and the food arrived at the table steaming hot so you knew that it was fresh off the stove. 

Even though I tell myself that I need to be adventurous and order something different, here are the two things that I always end up ordering:

1. Pad see ew ($7)-- A common, yet delicious fried noodle dish. It has Chinese broccoli, flat noodles, egg, and your choice of meat. I usually get it with chicken! 

2. Deep fried chicken fried rice ($7)-- Did you catch that? It has fried in its name twice, it has to be good! Seriously, it is tasty. The fried chicken is crispy and the fried rice is perfect.

I have also had the chicken wings. The chicken wings were okay, but for the price I would rather have another entree that comes with rice or something. I also had the mango with sticky rice for dessert. They have a fried banana and ice cream dessert that I have been meaning to try.

Overall, TFTG is on my list of top favorite places to eat since my move to Vegas. Little family owned restaurants are the best when it comes to taste and authenticity. Come check this place out and get your pad thai on!",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,37,33,5,Z2zkoVqA1R_ATAbyxVfd8Q

I've lived in Las Vegas since 2009. I've tried sooo many Thai restaurants. This is the first one that had all my favorite items, and they were all PERFECT! The thai tea was PERFECT, not too sweet, not too creamy, and the tea was nice and strong. The Tom Ka Kai at most restaurants is too sweet and creamy and not sour enough. Here is was, again, PERFECT. Most restaurants I've tried in Las Vegas don't even HAVE Drunken Noodles. They had them aaaand they were PERFECT. Lots of crisp green vegetables, the exact right amount of sweet vs salty vs spicy, the exact right amount of basil, perfectly cooked seafood, and the squid wasn't rubbery. 

The staff are super attentive and sweet. Honestly, this is good as ANY Thai food I've had in LA, Orange County or NYC. And probably better since ALL my favorite things were perfect and not just one or two items. And that is saying a lot.

2541154,2013-11-07,0,hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg,"THIS RESTAURANT WAS THE BEST FOOD I ATE IN VEGAS.

We were staying on the Strip so it was a trek and we went here after an Asian spa experience on Sahara. It took about 40 minutes by bus to get there and some of the connections were late...thanks RTC. But once we got there, our order was taken and food in front of us happened in span of 5 minutes. 

We ordered vegetable egg rolls with the spicy sauce (5 for $5? $6) that were perfect for hungry, weary, public transited travelers. Man, they were good. Also, I used the check in offer for a free thai iced tea. It was delicious!

For my main, I ordered pad thai ($6.95 for chicken, beef, pork, add $2 for combo) and it was served about a minute after the egg rolls came out. I wasn't asked about it's spicyness but I'd say it was mild, like bbq sauce or a smokey heat. Really tasty! I always love peanuts on my pad thai so I'd love more but it was a good portion of everything. Egg, leek/scallion, peanuts, bean sprout. . .man it was delicious. I ordered another thai iced tea. My bf had drunken noodle at a 5 and it was somewhat spicy but basically everything was just awesome.

2646780,2013-02-06,3,hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg,"Let's get straight to the point, this little Thai restaurant is skyrocketing near the top of my list.  I was extremely impressed with this place.  While the atmosphere feels like a small hole in the wall, and the seating may be a little cramped, rest assured that this is some of the best authentic Bangkok style food in Vegas as of this review.  

On my first visit I tried the Pot Stickers ($5.95), Green Curry Fried Rice ($7.95), and Green Curry with Beef ($6.95).  The Pot Stickers were similar to the ones served at TSNH.  The fried shell had a light crispness to it, and it was topped with a creamy orange sauce (I think it's the same sauce you get on a lot of sushi rolls).  They were pretty good, although nothing to rave about.  At least, not compared to the next two dishes.

The Green Curry Fried Rice was absurdly good.  Spiced heavily with just enough heat (I ordered a 7/10), the balance in flavor was spot on while still having that strong herbal/spicy array of authentic flavor.  The vegetables, which included short slices of green beans, were firm and juicy (not as juicy as good ol' Pan Asian mind you).  The chunks of chicken breast were most impressively juicy and tender as well.  I highly recommend this dish to any Thai food lover.  They don't hold back on the flavor. All kinds of lemongrass, basal, and other delicious spicy flavors explode with this dish.

The Green Curry itself, ordered with beef, was one of the best I have had in a very long time.  It was a thin Bangkok style curry with lots of bamboo, green and red peppers, etc.  Any Thai food lover knows that it is hard to find an exceptional Bangkok style green curry.  I think this one has trumped Krung Thai for my favorite green curry in town.  The balance of flavor was again amazing.  Many Thai restaurants either hold back on the spicing ingredients or can't balance them properly.  This place does it right.  The only complaint that I could see maybe is that there wasn't a ton of beef, but to me the curry itself is so good that it doesn't even need it.  A+ green curry right here, folks.

On visit two we had the Roast Duck Curry ($8.95), Larb with Pork ($6.95), Pineapple Fried Rice ($7.95), and Drunken Noodles with chicken ($6.75).  Again, the food was stellar the second time around, and again the Roast Duck Curry stole the show.  It had a strong yet balanced and lightly sweet flavor, very savory while still a thin consistency.  The pineapple tasted fresh, and the duck was of the highest quality.  The only complaint I would have is that there could have been more duck meat, but I would rather have less of a higher quality meat.  The price is certainly right regardless.  The curries here are authentic and balanced at the same time, completely stellar.  

The Pineapple Fried Rice was excellent as well, with a light grilled flavor balanced with the sweetness of fresh pineapple.  The cashews tasted fresh and were absolutely delightful.  The Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mow at some other restaurants) was also great.  The Larb was slightly dry for my taste, but very flavorful. It wasn't too sour but definitely had some sourness to it, and had lots of other savory flavors to balance it out.  Most Larbs I have had lately are very one sided in the sour department, but not this one.  Multidimensional flavor seems to be the theme to this place!

I would probably give Thai Food To Go a 4/5 over all, but the curries here are so off the hook that I have to bump this one up to a 5.  I can't express my previous frustration with not being able to find really good, authentic tasting Bangkok style curry in this town.  Thai Food To Go has finally filled that gap for me, and I can't wait to go back.

I've done take-out twice and delivery a few times - I prefer the delivery.  The take out is fine, though the last time there was a mistake when the guy next to me in line ""accidentally"" took my food as well as his.  The owner was apologetic and gave me a free Thai iced tea while she remade my order... it was just irritating.

Nonetheless.  The food is amazing.  It's always hot and freshly made, incredibly tasty and flavorful.  We've never ordered anything that we didn't like.  My husband typically orders the Pad Thai and my go-to is the Pad See Ew.  We get heaping helpings that are usually enough for two meals along with the free appetizers for a $20 order.  

Delivery is fast and friendly;  our food is always hot and there are never any issues.  There's no question about if we will eat here again, it's simply a matter of when.


**Edit** Still a great place - but they've done a little remodel inside, which makes it fairly pleasant (they have a wicked-cool mural).  They've added a delivery charge (sigh) and no longer offer the free appetizers with the $20 order.

Thanks to all my fellow Yelpers for leading me to this place especially to the Duke, Shawn J who just happens to be one of my Yelp buddies! Oh, and I cant say enough about Jaime W's review. She hit everything spot on. Also Emily R's review is awesome as well. It was so awesome that she got the ROTD! (Review Of The Day).

So here's my two cents. I actually was thinking about goin to Del Taco. As I pulled in to the parking lot, I see ""Thai Food To Go"". Hmm....I thought. Isnt this one of my bookmarks? So I check and yup, there it was. So there was no doubt I was eating there.

First impressions are that it's quite cozy, meaning they only have about 5 small tables and not much room for anything else. But you guys know the saying, ""Dont judge a good book by it's cover."" Im assuming that person has eaten here because the food is absolutely dee-lish.

The have this lunch special from 11 to 3 for 5.50 dine in only. What you get is your choice of meat, steamed or fried rice, soup, and a pot sticker or eggroll. That's awesome for your stomach and your wallet! I chose the Spicy Chicken Basil with a spicy rating of 4. Either im getting soft or my spice buds are deteriorating cuz I was sweating like a pig! Nevertheless, the fried rice, egg flower soup, and pot sticker were scrumptious! You also get a free Thai Iced Tea just for checking in. (dine in only). Of course I still needed water due to the fact I had steam coming from my forehead. I guess the lady saw that and went ahead and got me some water which was well appreciated.

Service was awesome!. From the time I ordered to the time I paid, everything was convenient, well except for the 10 dollar minimum credit/debit card policy. That was a bummer. So you either gotta order more food or pay cash. Most people dont carry cash anymore so hopefully after reading this you will be well aware.

So bookmark this place if you havent already. Im glad I did. Put a little spice in your life!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,8,8,4,vBf11GTDtNFbjYJmyJi4Bg

While Archie's and Pin Kao are familiar Thai lunch staples to the Vegas locals, this hidden gem on the east side of town excels in value and authenticity.   To start off, you automatically knock off a few bucks simply by checking in on Yelp and receiving a complementary Thai iced tea, an always refreshingly cool, creamy, and sweet beverage to neutralize even the spiciest of meals.  One then has the options for the $5.95 lunch specials which include choice of main entree, soup of the day, steamed or fried rice, and veggie egg roll or chicken pot sticker.   The standout option is the green curry.  They are not shy on spice, so my advice would be to order at about 5-6 if you like spicy, and titrate upward with the dry chili flakes at your table since that is essentially what they add to increase the spice level.  My experience with 7 or higher is that the spice overpowers the other flavors and it is not a pleasant experience, especially if you are ordering noodles or fried rice since you can at least extinguish some heat from the curries with steamed rice.  

Whereas Pin Kao is heavy handed with the coconut milk and Archie's can be a tad on the oily side, the curries here are remarkably balanced and packed with vibrant and distinct flavors from the herbs and spices.  All the meats and vegetables components are fresh and well-cooked with toothsome textures.   A few items I've tried off the beaten path include the spicy crab noodle (think vinegary pad thai with bits of spicy crab), thai bbq chicken served with a side of papaya salad and sticky rice (aptly named ""the three buddies"", there's probably a food porn joke somewhere in here involving the words threesome and sticky, but I will keep this review PG), and the crispy fried pork (good flavors but way too salty).  The noodle soups are unmemorable and the one dish to avoid at all costs is the mee krob.  I've been wanting to try a solid rendition of mee krob (roughly translates to ""crispy noodles"") which is akin to hong kong style pan-fried noodles topped with a meat/vegetable starchy gravy but having a sweet acidic component and using rice noodles instead of egg noodles, yet the rendition here uses cheap chow mein noodles and drowned with a msg-laden sauce that reminds me of a premium bowl of cup-o-ramen.  I'm going to pretend this dish never happened.  Based on other yelper's photos, the whole fried tilapia topped with a spicy mango relish and the mango sticky rice look pretty legit so they are on the agenda for future visits.  All in all, a solid local mom/pop Thai joint that is easy on the wallet, loaded with authentic flavors,  and hits the spot if you are looking for a quick bite or as a solid take out option on the east side of town.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,20,19,4,7gx0uO7o6RP9ARD9WTb23A

Last June I planned a Vegas Bachelorette Weekend for my best friend's sister. The group of about 12 girls stayed in penthouse & adjoining suites at the fabulous Platinum Hotel Las Vegas. Everyone checked into the hotel on Saturday and were set to check out on Sunday. Games & male exotic dancer were all set for early evening in the main suite before the group headed out for their VIP Club Tour & Limo Bus. Since the bachelorette party would be in the suite, the bride requested to have her favorite food catered for dinner. Platinum hotel rooms have LARGE kitchen space with wrap-around counters and dining table...and the penthouse space was perfect for the dinner. I immediately went to yelp since i'm from LA and not familiar with local restaurants...I called Thai Food To Go a few days before arriving to Vegas and told them of our budget for food for the party...they were more than accommodating and agreed to deliver the food. I don't remember the name of the person I spoke to, but he delivered the food ON TIME himself and everything was DELICIOUS!!!! All of the guests were so pleased with everything we ordered (Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, Yellow Curry, etc.)...and most importantly the bride was thrilled! There was SO much food left over that the girls continued to eat everything the next day for breakfast/ lunch lol",tDfmTcrrgvOxzk_JvYXsCA,3,3,5,lHgTAPU6KLWw7LXltXA8hA

I am so happy to have finally found a great place that is very close to home, for a quick bite that does not compromise in quantity or quality. The service was very refreshing. The man taking our order was very helpful even with a bit of a language barrier. 

Of course I started out with a free Thai tea that comes with a Yelp check-in. My SO and I ordered an entrée of the chicken pad Thai noodles and yellow curry with chicken which came with a side of steamed rice. The meat and veggies were plentiful and delicious!  We like our spice on more of the milder side. On a scale of 1-10 for spice, we asked for our dishes to be at a #4 for the noodles and a #2 for the curry. I think the noodles were still pretty spicy! We didn't mind. It was still very yummy!

It is, however, very small! Consider take-out for larger groups rather than dining-in. I was very relieved to find it empty on a Sunday evening because I was expecting it to be packed like I've read in previous reviews.

We ended up getting pad see ew (I always judge a Thai place by this for this is what I mainly order), yellow curry, and garlic, pepper crispy pork.
The crispy pork was probably better eaten right away. Had a lot of flavor. A little bit on the saltier side for me but perfect with a side of rice. 
I shouldn't have let the girl order for she got shrimp in the yellow curry. Should've stuck with chicken or beef. Curry was good. Had a nice serving of vegetables in it.

I pretty much judge my Thai food on how willing they are to make my food super spicy. I asked for an 8 and it was perfect. I should remind myself to not go higher next time but I know I'll be tempted. The spicy mint was great, there was a ton of ground chicken and this was probably the spiciest of the dishes. Pad see ew is just a classic and they gave us a tonnn of noodles which made me happy because this is usually the first dish we finish. The panang curry was the only slight disappointment. The curry was pretty watery and I don't usually like green beans in my curries. Other random highlight: the chili paste they give you is really spicy.

I got the sense that they must have a really high rate of return customers and I can see why.

Now the food... I ordered Pad Thai. The portion was large with a good amount of chicken. The taste was awesome and just what I was looking for.

I really like the packaging too. They put the noodles on a tin foil so none of the sauce leaks out and they give you a side of hot sauce and utensils without having to ask.

Normally I wait to write a review until after I have at least two dining experiences, but today I can't wait. Zero patience when it comes to spreading the good word about good food.

 5 STAR FLAVOR. $5.50 (Lunch Special Prices) Green Curry Chicken at 10 for heat level. Overall it was some of the best Green Curry I've encountered and the heat level was spot on. Nice balance of white meat chicken to vegetables and loaded with chiles. It's going to be hard for me to try anything else because it was that good.

 5 STAR SERVICE. The lady who helped me gets 5 stars just for her smile. She lit up the small restaurant with her smile and positive attitude.  Her spirit is contagious and I wish my coworkers could be more like her. I had a real funny thing I wrote right here about that, but thought it would be in my best interest to keep it to myself. (That's growth)

Why only 4 STARS you ask? 
1. Because I've only eaten here once and I am not going to high five a spot until I have tasted more of the menu.
2. This place is REALLY small. It was clean and bright, but it's just too small. Definitely not first date worthy unless the person is really cool and really loves Thai food and you. Then it would be ideal. 

I forgot to mention if you check in on Yelp you get a free Thai Tea if you are dining in. 

Thai Food To Go is not to be missed. One of the most flavorful, top quality meals around for 5 bucks. I might go back tomorrow to try the Pumpkin Curry on special right now!",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,24,16,4,u4N_fS_q3wZY-D0ZjJ8qPg

This unassuming little place might not look like its fancy peers, but who needs fancy when your food is this good!!

I have to say, Yelp stars were on point for this one. If I had just based it on looks, then I may have passed this gem over. But guys, I am dead serious. This is some of the best Thai food I have ever tasted!! I know I have only been here once, but I just had to shout it from the rooftops about how awesome the food is.

My boyfriend decided to treat me to dinner, and I chose Thai. But he was actually the one that found Thai Food To Go (thanks Yelp App!). Upon pulling up in the parking lot, we didn't even really see it at first, because the strip mall it's in looks empty. We drove over to the other side, and that's when we actually saw the front of the restaurant.

Inside, there are only a few small tables. Barely enough room to order your to-go food, even! I recommend staying there and eating. I actually really enjoined the no-frills, mellow vibe the place had going for it.

To start, we ordered the Spring Rolls. They have both chicken and shrimp in them. I remember once I ordered the same thing at Lotus of Siam before, and it was a bunch of money wasted for these puny little rolls. Not here. You get a good sized portion and some of that sweet vinegar dipping sauce with the nuts in it, all for the same price, maybe even cheaper! 

For our main dishes, I chose the Pumpkin Curry, which was on special for around $7.95. My bf ordered the Duck Curry, spicy. Both of our currys looked beautiful upon arrival! Mine had large chunks of chicken and perfectly cooked pumpkin pieces. Not too soft, not too hard. The duck curry also had large meat pieces in it, along with tomato and pineapple.  Bf said that his was not as spicy as he had wanted it, but that was his only real negative thing to say (plus, they have more spices and sauces on the table if you need it).

To finish off, I got the Mango and Sweet Rice dessert. Soooo guuuuud. 

We both had a Thai Iced tea, and they were very, very sweet. I loved it.

This is my official favorite Thai food place in town! Be careful. If you do decide to go, it might ruin all other local Thai food experiences for you... But I'm sure Thai Food To Go wouldn't mind that at all!",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,26,25,5,wmWp4bFiWBhtMxDclQv80g

#44 Spicy Green Beans: Enjoyed it. Had a bit of spice but wasn't overpowering. Would have liked more veggies but the carrots green beans and bell peppers went well together. I asked for Brown rice in place of the typical white and was charged $1.50 to upgrade.

C4 Roasted Duck Curry: Wasn't my order but I tried a little. Was to sweet for my liking though dad liked it a lot.

There are 5 tables that hold a total of 14 people.  I guess that's why it's named well and they had a number of take out visits while we were there.

I checked the daily specials board and saw pumpkin curry.  I ordered it with chicken, spice level 7 on a 1 to 10 scale.  My wife got her standard pepper and garlic chicken which does not have a spice level.  We also got an order of vegetarian egg rolls.  

Everything was very good.  The egg rolls were very good and were delivered very hot to our table.  The pumpkin curry was something very different for me and I'd certainly get it again.  I tasted my wife's chicken and it, too, was good and she liked it.  Unlike what she's used to at other Thai restaurants, Thai For To Go deep fries the chicken briefly--no coating--just enough to give a bit of crispness and cooking to the chicken.  

A couple of small things.  Being so small, the tables are small.  We would have been better off sitting at one of the two tables for four people because there almost wasn't enough room for the dishes on the table.  Also, we had our egg rolls for about 2 minutes when she came out with our main dishes.  Perhaps I need to ask people to wait, but I really like some time to enjoy the appetizer before having to start the main course.  Again, due to its size, there's no customer bathroom available without going through the kitchen.  We didn't use the bathroom but we noticed one of the customers going into the kitchen to get there.

It's a good value for the good food.  I hope to get back.  If it were on the west side of town I'd be there more often but it's almost to Boulder Highway.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,3,4,3nFoEyvMclO6n5t0ZAAU6g

They don't even have a bathroom! 

It seats like 12.

Anyways we always get take out from here for lunch at my office.

They can make anything a lunch special if you ask nicely for like $6 dollars.

Aside from that their entree portions are big especially for the cost and the food is really good.

They have gone through different owners which helped them. I heard they once were owned by the same ""Thai style noodle house"" people. They even have a few of their staples like the pot stickers, the Tom yum noodle soup, and the crispy chicken over fried rice. I'd say the Tom yum at noodle house is still a lot better.

Their yellow, green, and duck curry is good. All of their dishes are good. The fried rice, the noodle dishes, the soups. 

The only thing I don't recommend is their pad Thai =\ sorry. But who gets pad Thai at a Thai restaurant anyways? :P

To date, I've tried pad thai, pad see ew, pad woon sen, khua kai, drunken noodles. Can't go wrong with any of them and the pork that's among the non-premium choices.]

They say that all good things must come to an end. Unfortunately, that has finally happened to the $5.95 weekday lunch special at Thai Food To Go.

I hadn't visited this restaurant for a few months, and I just learned today that they're no longer offering their lunch special, which includes a reasonable selection of different entrees, the option to sub in a very basic fried rice instead of white rice, a fried chicken potsticker (or veggie egg roll, but who eats that stuff?), and a small bowl of soup. I'm definitely going to miss the egg drop soup and the sour soup, which I don't even see on the menu. I'll have to inquire next time about whether they'll still make it.

I ended up ordering the beef pad thai today. I'd never had it before because it wasn't on the lunch specials menu. It's a generous portion and comes with crushed peanuts and fresh bean sprouts. I have to say that it was a little strong on the fish sauce and just a little lacking in meat. I would definitely suggest not ordering pad thai and pad see eu here.

However, this is not one of those mopey ""oh I had one bad experience so my review/rating is going to invalidate all of the good meals that I've had."" No, Thai Food To Go has given me countless enjoyable lunches, and it's still the same folks and the same food. The menu is still priced the same, starting at $6.95 for basic entrees including your choice of tofu, beef, or the not-very-appealing-cuts of pork and chicken that they use in many dishes here.

So what should you order with your beef? From what I've experienced with the lunch specials, the curries are awesome. For a long time, I was on a rotation of red curry (spicier than the others), yellow curry (more potato-y than the others), and panang curry (similar to red but milder). The green curry that didn't captivate me as strongly, but feel free to give it a go. I also enjoyed the spicy basil, which is basically code for ""it's sweet and you can still customize the spice level"" (they work on a 1-10 scale, by the way).

Salmon panang curry is another skip due to the dry salmon. BBQ chicken, another former lunch special, is definitely worth a try. This chicken comes on the bone, and the meat is charred. I prefer the sweet and sour sauce, but I think it's normally served with a spicy sauce. Lastly, I'd say the fried rice dishes are also worth your time. I had a fried rice once. I think it was the pineapple fried rice. Adding the fish sauce from the table-side condiment basket made it a real treat.

In a way, I'm also glad that I'll have more leeway to try explore the rest of the menu and occasionally try different restaurants' lunch specials. I'll definitely still come back to Thai Food To Go when the craving for a curry strikes, but I'll surely miss what was once an utterly amazing deal.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,5,5,IZwEo3H_HBLdvHEkEVZ4Fw

I decided to sit center of the mural (note photos) cuz it's just so darn cool!!!!! I just love the Thai versions of coca cola, sprite, and fanta-oh I do wanna fanta fanta!!!

Anyway, they have a yelp offer for a free Thai tea if you dine in which I am so happily enjoying right now. 

I ordered the usual Thai garb: Tom kha (coconut soup), beef salad, and pad Thai. Let me say you either know how to make good thai food or ya don't and this place DEFINITELY knows how!!!! 

tom kha: 
doesn't get any better! I think there was a total of 5-6 shrimp which is about normal. You can get either beef or chicken but I always get this coconut soup with shrimp

Pad thai: 
Just the right amount of each fixin'. Sometimes I get upset if I don't get enough peanuts! lol One thing that did bum me was that my noodles got cold fast. Not that it showed up cold, I probably couldn't stop gabbing with the Bestie.

As for the beef salad, Homegirl ordered that and wanted it a 5 on a 1-10 scale. I can't handle hot food so I didn't eat any of it but it sure looked yummy! (refer to photos).

But my overall impression is that this restaurant is beyond accommodating and extremely friendly. We showed up relatively late: me 945pm and my Bestie 1021pm (no joke). This place closes at 1030p. They still allowed us in with no pushback or attitude, remained smily and friendly, served us and a matter of fact waited AFTER it closed down for us. However we didn't take advantage of their kindness and was out the door by 1040p. 

I'll definitely come here again when I'm craving some thai goodness. They deserve my patronage!",FBlKK57447Wt-EUR1TfENw,2,2,5,O8I0qoidZiUGb_dfgd-HUQ

Trying to be patient, I said I would wait. 45 minutes later I again get a call. No one answered the door (not the same driver) so it was left on my doorstep. Immediately I go to the door. Nothing there. Try to call the number back- no response. Call the restaurant. Was told the sauce was delivered. Explained it wasn't. Second delivery person called me back.

Having lived in Bangkok for a year of my life, I tend to be a real snob about Thai food. However, I was extremely impressed with Thai Food To Go!

I can only comment on the two dishes I had -- chicken pad see ew and yellow curry chicken -- but both were outstanding. The pad see ew was made exactly the way it is in Bangkok, using Chinese broccoli (essential), and the flavor was outstanding. The standard Thai condiments that are supposed to be served with this dish were on the table just as you'd find in Thailand. The yellow curry was also delicious -- some of the best I've ever had.

I give this place my highest recommendation for its quality of food, authenticity and extremely low prices. The couple who run the place are very friendly and deserve your business. They're serving some of the best Thai food I've had anywhere at borderline fast food prices. Big thumbs up for me!

UPDATE: I ate here again and the food was only above average. The old woman who cooks in the evenings was not there, and whoever was cooking in her place was not quite up to par.

First time out had the green curry with duck. I don't often have duck, but I thought why not try it in curry?? It was fabulous! There was a generous amount of the delicate bird throughout and plenty of veggies too. The portion was easily enough for two meals. I believe I ordered 5 on the heat scale, I don't recall as there was poolside beer drinking involved, but the heat was just right, not overwhelming. If you have it for dinner, add the leftover rice to the remaining curry so it will soak up all the delicious heat!
I did get hooked on the green curry and had it again on my 2nd go, but this time with chicken, same level of heat. Out of this world! 
It's so convenient and we had our orders delivered very fast. I want to go in and sit down for some Pad Thai, and a nice glass of Thai ice tea so I can meet these folks in person to heap praise upon them and their culinary talents!!!",LsKp4SlhrVw3ZHs11c1deA,4,1,5,fPkjXbwzY7Xpu6-tp6R3OA

Talk about hole in the wall place! I absolutely love little unassuming restaurants. Once I walked in I knew it would be tasty. They only have maybe 6 tables, but it just adds to the whole experience. 

Not only is this place unique, but it's very budget friendly! It was just over $20 for two entrees, an appetizer and two sodas. They have a pretty large menu and some really good lunch specials as well. Joel and I both ordered the pad see ew (mine had beef & his had pork)  and we also ordered the veggie egg rolls. The portions were large and it was full of flavor, but I was a bit thrown off having to add the spiciness myself. Most Thai places have a spice scale. They had four little pots with different kinds of peppers and chili sauces. I just started adding ALL the things. We both really enjoyed the flavors and spices we added. The egg rolls were also very tasty and cooked just right. They didn't fall apart when I bit into it.

Food came out shockingly fast and piping hot off the woks I can hear in the kitchen. 

Pork Larb - it was labeled something along the lines of ""spicy special salad (larb) on the menu so I missed it at first, disappointed they didn't make it until I saw a Yelp review that ordered it. I really liked the way they do it here. In general, most places are light on the herbal aspects and I appreciated the abundance of mint, cilantro and thin slices of kefir. I normally add condiments to tweak larb at places to my liking but I didn't touch this at all. Love! 

Green curry with beef - this is a more watery style of curry, but the flavor was definitely there. Lots of carrot, bamboo shoot,bell pepper and basil came along with it so not as much meat, but it's still enough to go around.

Pad kee mao/drunken noodles - the flavors of this was lovely, noodles were perfectly cooked and not gummy and the pork was tender.

The Fiance tends to lean to a milder spice and ordered a 3 which was spicier than average. It seems they employ using the ""Thai spicy"" scale than the ""White Boy Spicy"" most use when they see us ordering. Normally a 3 anywhere else is basically having nothing. I can detect some spice here so spice whimps, beware! I like my stuff as spicy as I can tolerate so the condiment wheel is my friend when dining with my guy . If I ain't wincing and breaking a fierce sweat, I am not satisfied. Hurts SO guuuddd.

The girl running the front was very friendly and attentive. The place is pretty small, only 5 tables, probably less than 15 people can dine at once. The prices are cheaper than average (majority of dishes are $7), but probably because they are in a small space in a dead shopping center. On top of the great prices, there is a current check in offer of a free Thai Ice Tea! Just FYI, there is no public restroom. I didn't ask if you can use the kitchen bathroom, but there were no doors leading to a bathroom. There was a sink, however, to wash your hands. 

This is a solid place. The flavors of everything was fresh and seasoned with a knowing hand.  If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely stop but this seems to be one of those hole in the walls worth actually coming this way for.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,3,4,ywad8n9HLfevxQZsS1EXOg

First and foremost, when you check in with your Yelp app, you get a FREE thai tea. So just show the waitress! The thai tea wasn't too sweet, which was great. I hate drinking di

For the $5.95 lunch special, you get your choice of dish and meat with steamed white rice or fried rice (which wasn't really fried rice, more like mixed rice), soup, and one pot sticker or spring roll. I opted for their green curry with chicken and fried rice and pot sticker. They have a spicy scale of 1-10 and the lady who took my order suggested 5 since she said it was pretty spicy. But I LIKE SPICY SO I WAS LIKE, LEVEL 7 PLEASE. You thought I was going to say 10 huh? HAHA! 

My friend got their pad see ew since that's usually my favorite dish so this way, we could share. 

The food came out FAST. Which was awesome because both of us were starving. The surprisingly, the portions are pretty huge. I was surprised how much curry they gave you for the lunch special. 

The curry was yummy. It was spicy but not TOO spicy. But then again, I can take the spice. It was so good. I just couldn't stop eating. Though, next time, I think I would much rather prefer steamed white rice over the fried rice. And I will get a 10 next time (: 

The pad see ew was equally yummy. It was delicious! It had the perfect flavor and aroma to it. They stir fried it really well too. 

Overall, amazing food for the price! I definitely want to come back. In fact, I MISS IT. I MISS IT SO MUCH I wanna go back ASAP. Haha but first, need to find time.

Fortunately, the gentleman helping us said it did and when I explained my sensitivity, he assured me it could be omitted. My hubby ordered the pad Thai noodles with tofu, also, no msg requested. Both dishes were good, just a bit oily for my taste.

Both dishes were attractively presented. Portion size was just right. I do wish it had been cooked with a tad less oil. The tofu was also fried, a lesson for me to remember to ask for it to be steamed next time.

Kunchorn had been my to go Thai place and I was so saddened when they never reopened in June.  But now I have a new favorite.
Thai Food to Go is a small restaurant with just 5 tables, a dive?.  But it is clean, the staff are all very friendly, and I find the food to be superior to most of the other local Thai restaurants.
Pros: 
Flavorful and nuanced food
Good prices and large portions
Fast service - at lunch it slows down just because of the sheer number of orders coming out of the kitchen
Lunch specials are a great deal!

Cons:
Limited menu
Inconsistent with heat levels 

My husband prefers Stick E Rice likely for the ambience.  He says the menu is larger but he always gets the same thing so I'm sure that isn't the reason.  

They no longer offer the free Thai Iced Tea or appetizers with your order.  But if you check in with Yelp they are currently offering a free Thai Iced Tea with $15 or more order.

Anyway, if you are looking for authentic food, served in a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere, without breaking the bank, I recommend trying Thai Food to Go.

5715849,2016-03-31,18,hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg,"I was gonna tell a Thai joke....but Phuket.  

This restaurant is located on Desert Inn between Pecos & McLeod.  Went on Wednesday 3-30-16 at 6pm for some takeout.  $9.15 got me an order of Pad See Ew and an order of sticky rice. 

The restaurant is in an older and very small strip mall and only has about 5 tables.  I don't think there is a public restroom on site.   The place is of questionable cleanliness...especially if you peek back into the kitchen area.  I would be much happier if I had not seen the inside and had just ordered delivery.  

I always get the same thing from here...the $7.95 pad see ew with chicken and then I substitute regular broccoli for the chinese broccoli.  Last night's version was probably the most disappointing...the chicken tasted like it was cooked days ago and one out of every 5 bites or so was SPICY. 

It was like playing spicy noodle roulette....will this bite be normal or set my mouth on fire? Only one way to find out....OM NOM NOM.  

When they have it (which is almost never), their mango sticky rice is amazing.  They haven't had it the last 3 times I've gotten food from there.  They keep telling me it's not in season.  The sticky rice has the most amazing texture...unlike anything I've ever had before.  It's so chewy and fragrant.

5765596,2012-01-19,10,hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg,"Life is about managing expectations.  This Thai dive provoked an expectation by it's namesake that their respective target market is the ""TO GO"" crowd.  Ok, got it.

Ok, just to prove my point and to be a smart ass, I googled ""the definition of TO GO""...it crashed Google...so, when I read ""TO GO"" I assumed it to mean...hey, let's get some fast food and keep moving....

I only have 30 minutes for lunch and I work on the east side of the Valley which just seems notoriously slow whatever direction you are going.  I had forgotten my lunch today and instead of heading to the conveniently located but boring local Subway, I opted to YELP something new.  This eatery is approximately 2.5 miles from my work so I figured I was safe if it was fast.

First an accident on Eastern.  That took an extra 10 minutes.  Then, my friggin Yelp app refused to talk to my Android Google maps Navigator....kept sending me to Latitude where I kept seeing my g/f's last location 2 days ago (WTF Latitude...anyone awake over there at Google?).  So, driving blind but I find the restaurant ok.

Since I had arrived at a ""TO-GO"" place, I assumed they would be waiting on me...So, I quickly picked up a menu...but, thinking in the spirit of expediency, let me just order some PAD THAI and Wonton Soup.  The lady seems Thai so I hedge my bets and make sure she does not get confused with my Alaskan accent and just order  #10 and #21 off their menu.  She gets very confused.  So, I then say, ""Pad Thai and Won Ton soup please...""  Still does not register with her....So, I break out the menu and quick point to my two items.  She gets the Pad Thai written down and then looks at me blankly...Yes, I would like some Wonton soup also...

After 20 minutes, this has given me an opportunity to scrutinize the less than tidy tiny place and wondered how bright their business future is if they just opened.  As with most Thai peoples and restaurants, they are very polite and friendly but already my expectations have been disappointed.  They did bring me a Thai ice tea while I waited without asking.  I do not like Thai ice tea.  

So, now I am stressed because I am late and I actually have two time-sensitive projects at work.  This 20 minute adventure took close to 50 minutes. :(

Once I got back into my cubicle, I opened my food...huge portions and not really typical of a lunch menu.  I had hoped the lunch menu would have a cup of wonton soup not like the 23 gallon size.  Never touched the soup and maybe I will have for dinner.  The pad thai was very good but the 'foreplay' to my meal took away from the potential pleasure of enjoying a thai lunch.

In conclusion, I would not recommend this place.",BzEf4f8nNYz3SCb_qA66DA,3,3,2,pV98mOgWq5JcGIFkS6BtsA

My partner in crime & I stopped in for last a last minute lunch sesh. The place is quaint, roughly 4-5 tables (hence the place is not called Thai Food To Dine-in). We sat down, browsed through the lunch menu and made out selections. 

First and foremost, the lunch menu is very reasonable. $5.50 gets you an entrée, fried/steamed rice, and hot & sour soup. I ordered the green chicken curry, she ordered the stir fry veggie platter. Both dishes had excellent flavor. The cute solo pot sticker that accompanies the dish is tasty, too. The thing that pushed this place from 4 to 5 stars was the presentation. One would expect this to be lackluster with the cheap prices, yet they managed to present me with a dish that was Instagram worthy (Lo-fi with the green curry makes for a good pic). My partner in crime is on a no meat-save-the-world kick, so it was nice to see that they are able to alter dishes in order to accommodate vegetarians. 

They have bottled water & cans of soda for a buck & of course they have Thai tea. The tea was great. We noticed they serve dessert as well. I remember seeing fried banana ice cream, but was stuffed so I made no further inquires. 

Service was great. Food came out quick.

So while my order is cooking, I decide to leave and come back in 15 mins. When I walk back in the lady tells me she's sorry, that they are out of noodles. So now I have to reorder and wait an additional 15 minutes. 



I certainly hope their food is good, because their service is horrible! I walked in and as soon as the I got to the counter, the lady asked me to give her a minute. I explained to her that it was my first visit and had questions about the curry. 3 times this lady interrupted my ordering to run off and do something else. If she wasn't stopping mid sentence into my order to take another order, she was cutting me off to help another customer. 

Finally we got down to the level of spice. All the Thai restaurants that I have been to have levels 1 to 4. Out of habit I say 2. Then I ask her what the levels are and she says 1 to 10. So I ask her on a level like that, is 2 even spicy and she says no. So I tell her that I enjoy spicy food but I don't want to burn out my taste buds,  and ask if she could suggest a number based on the information I gave her. This lady looks at me and says 2!
