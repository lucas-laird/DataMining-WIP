689188,2017-02-06,0,ai5dbb7P-qwt113PaJJCwg,"My friends and I decided to go the nearest Denny's, which so happen to be the one on the Vegas strip. It was near midnight and the strip was packed on a Saturday night. We were a group of seven women. We walked into the Denny's and were quickly greeted and seated at a table. The restaurant was nice and clean and had a warm and friendly ambiance. The restaurant wasn't packed but had about five groups of about 4 people per table. 

We were quickly approached by our waitress Cynthia S., an elderly woman with glasses and a messy bun. She was extremely friendly and happy. She made us feel so comfortable and took care of us so very well. She asked for our drinks and went around the table and treated everyone so diligently while taking our drinks. She came back quickly with them and took our order. She complimented everyone on their choice and made sure  everyone's sides were the sides they wanted. She quickly came back with the food and everything was outstanding! In looks, quality, and portion. Everyone's plates looked exactly like the picture in the menu. Most of us ordered off of the dinner menu; chicken fried steaks, philly melts, and nachos. She made many jokes and checked up on us constantly throughout our dinner. I ordered the Banana Walnut Pancakes; exceptional! The 3 pancakes were large, all the same size, perfectly golden brown, fluffy, and hot. The egg whites were fluffy and perfectly cooked. The turkey bacon was a little crisp but not over-cooked. I was even more impressed when I realized the walnuts within my pancakes were fresh, crisp, and candied and the bananas on top were nice and fresh and not brown or too ripe. The portions were amazing compared to the price! My plate costed $8.50 and my Berry Lemonade $2.89. My total came out to $11.38 for exceptional food. I had a 20% coupon, so I actually only ended up spending $9.84 (including tax). 

Cynthia S. was amazing and I feel so bad the group only tipped her $15. I absolutely feel like we shorted her. The total bill for everyone was $101. I've promised myself to not tip according to the 15% rule from now on. I believe a tip is what you think your waiter or waitress deserved and I think Cynthia deserved more than 15% for her outstanding service. I'll be sure to make up for my mistake when I go back. 

Not only was Cynthia amazing, the ENTIRE staff was extremely kind to us. While waiting for our food, I decided to play a game with the group which required some writing on napkins. I didn't have a pen so I asked a young man who worked there as he passed by our table. He uncomfortably said he only had one with a smile but gave it to me anyway and when I asked him if he needed it he said no. Lol I'm sure he did, but he sacrificed his pen for our satisfaction. And when we got up to pay our bill the young man at the register was incredibly kind as he joked with us and asked about the food. Not to mention the other elderly waiter who greeted us and asked about or night while Cynthia was getting our food. 

Overall, Denny's is a wonderful restaurant chain. The one on the Las Vegas strip is outstanding and I recommend everyone to dine at any Denny's, and not hesitate to visit the one on the Las Vegas Strip.",ssoZVVD068EXD1qgu5XKSw,0,0,5,61D343EWtTE2ZYl3KNCIYA

Not impressed. I ordered the Tilapia Ranchero dinner. Once it arrived, there was NO spice added to the fish. None. It was whiter than white on rice, on a paper plate in the middle of an Alaskan snowstorm.

 Whoever cooked it obviously didn't know the recipe. I informed the waitress the fish was nothing as advertised and she offered me another, even though we had appetizers and other items, which came at the same time as the entree..all at once. Was not interested in getting another entree. The rest of the food was good, the fish was not to my liking in its plain form unseasoned form. We paid the bill and moved on...

930801,2017-04-10,0,ai5dbb7P-qwt113PaJJCwg,Denny's is my favorite restaurant but today I was completely disappointed. The wait to be seated wasn't bad. They said 15 to 20 minutes. We got seated and it took a while to get our drinks. That was okay we understood it was busy. I ordered an omelette and the food came out pretty fast. But as soon as I saw it I felt so disgusted. The hash browns looked darker than my under eye circles and drier than my elbows. The eggs were a throw up yellow that looked plastic and I opened the omelette up to see how it looked inside and I don't even know how to describe what I saw. We were in a rush and I was hungry so I ate it. Next time I'll just stick to my usual Denny's. This location was just disappointing.,7sxaL2IDnD8fE5dVuEp9ZQ,0,0,2,8n2n8bAQuIM15bxbV_OeTw

Dennys always good. The food came out fast and to order. 
Very happy with meal.
Not happy i had to wait 5 minutes to be seated.  I was only one waiting to be seated.  After finally getting seated i realized why it took soooo long. Their hostess who was on at 320 am was on her phone texting.  She was facing back by where the ice cream is kept. The 28 minutes i was there she sat only one other party.  Too busy on her phone costing the waiter and waitresses MONEY.  REVIEW your security footage.  Terminate her and replace her with someone else Whos willing to do their job... 
Your waitresses are always freindly engaging and welcoming to have my business. I'll return but next time I'll just seat myself.

We waited twenty minutes till I went and spoke to a server who was hanging out in a group near the drinks, informed him of the situation, he asked what table we were at. Five minutes later, still nothing. We were completely ignored. So we left. On the way out informed the host that they had a table of 6 open now because they didn't serve us for 25 minutes.

Lesson 1: Under promise, over deliver.

Everyone was wearing a smile on their faces and that was awesome. Smile is contagious. 5 stars for that.

The busser who was bussing tables on our section was fantastic. She was like a super woman, had an eye for detail but quick at the same time. 

She offered to take our order and pass it on to our server and she did a great job at that. She deserves to be  promoted as a server. 

Our server was great too. When she came to check on us I was finishing up my coffee and immediately offered a refill. 5 stars for that.

I came here just to get a slice of pie and some coffee and unfortunately Denny's couldn't even manage to get it right.

At first I was excited when I saw my pecan pie, but then when I started eating it I noticed that it was pretty hard and it had an after taste of old stale dough.

The texture and the taste gave me the impression that this pie has been sitting in the fridge for an extremely long time.

I know that Denny's isn't known for high quality food, but the least this establishment can do is serve a fresh decent slice of pie. It's not that freaking hard, but hey that's what you'll get when your only paying $2.

Overall I'll never come here again for a slice of pie. It was just disgusting and for the record this small lovely slice of pie will run you 730 calories. Yikes!!!!",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,0,0,2,3TPKoNeidU5ySFgSe29rlg

Facility:  forgive me, but all I noticed is it was a Denny's. What can I say...I was drinking I told yah. 

Service:  our waiter was good and very nice; however when he went on his break, I had to try to flag someone else for a drink refill. Took a while and someone finally came over and gave us refills. Then about 5 min later, our waiter appeared checking if we needed anything. LOL! 

Food:  just about anything on the greasy side is good when you're drunk. We shared some fried jalapeños and cheese quesadillas.  LOVED the jalapeños!!!!
Then I ordered the skillet platter with sausage. I ordered over easy, but they were more like over difficult. I asked to hold the onions and peppers, but add tomatoes. The skillet above on the menu said it was with grape tomatoes, so this is what I expected. It was more like they added stewed tomatoes...could have done without those, otherwise, the skillet hit the spot. Although, I filled up on appetizers, so I ended up taking most of my food home.

Q: My god, are you really trying to get me to go to *this* Denny's? You gotta be fucking kidding me.
A: Let's say you've been driving all night. Let's say that Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) was real busy that night. Let's say the hotel doesn't check you into until 11.00am. Let's say you're really, really hungry. Let's say you wanted a Sampler Platter and substitute the Onion Rings for seasoned fries. Let's say this Denny's is the ideal location. Let's say there is no shame in going to this Denny's.

Q: Why is this Denny's so sad at 5.32am?
A: Between the hours of 4.00am and 6.00am on a non-holiday weekend, this town is just sadness. Trust me. I know.

Q: You are a sad, sad human being.
A: You should try asking more questions, anyway, let's just say that after growing up in California/Los Angeles and after driving 7 hours (stupid 15 Fwy traffic), there's no better thing than the host asking you: Smoking or Non-Smoking?

Clearly, we were in the Smoking section.

FYI ... It *is* sad. But it's away from the hustle and bustle and it's a good way to ""get away from it all"" before you dive back into The Strip. I was gonna give this 2-stars. Fuck it. Three it is.",jjHcf6XWMU7LmOEeUc9dqA,1,2,3,O5_3rYm_Xj_FUXKDoYVDxA

After 40 minutes, we got up and went inside to pay for our coffees so we could leave and actually get food somewhere. While in line, our server walks by with our food and asked why we were leaving. When I asked what took so long, she blatantly blamed the kitchen. So we follow her back outside, sit at our (now cleared) table in hopes of eating. Food was ice cold. We got up to leave for a second time and offered to pay the cashier for our coffees, and she waved it off like this type of service happens all the time.

Food is good to any Denny's standard. Our waitress was fabulous! We were seated in a fair amount of time considering the volume and our food arrived faster than I expected and was hot considering how packed they were. 

I will continue to pick them as a breakfast stop when I make another trip to Vegas!",aeSSDGNNCgGE37eSI-l2nw,0,1,4,vzUHYB97PGvBeq-CJYHiRQ

This place is awful I have tried several times to make call in orders they just put me on hold.I go across the street to order and I just want to leave the staff is a bunch of people who really just don't want to be there, the service is slow, and it's just not a good place to go if you are visiting Vegas  ..or living here for that matter",Sa419P1h9y5bQb5ynGShEA,0,0,2,1_E4ZxFvvMfLwEuUfATE4A

I ordered the BLT with fruit( it comes with fries but can be substituted ) and my sister had the Super Slam with eggs, hash, bacon, sausage and two huge pancakes. We ate it all! Super delicious!
Great customer service, extensive menu options and very clean.

Always a great option for comfort food and for those of us that dine on the lighter side.

Total for two meals no drinks(just lemon water) $12.98 plus an added $4 tip. Remember to tip! That's a tough job!",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,15,13,5,5uktey72xEbXrk6JO9_xrQ

Sure, but when you compare this one to other Dennys, or even to other diners in geneneral, its a cut above.  we been coming here for awhile now and weve always noticed how cleen, professional and tasty this one is.  The fried fare is a cut above too, always tasting good, not flat (not dirty) probably because they clean their grils and replace the oils.  Definitely chek this Dennys out.",cEhzbWGjThfBR_PBCO4zfA,1,0,4,AMkp_LXl7x0XnLdgB6mfvA

The rest of our party thought the same.  The waitress came every minute asking if we were ready yet but kept saying no rush.  She Did this at least 4 times.  My breakfast was also awful.  I was only able to eat a few bites.,8F1wNV8Q6L-9F_9BS5RXxA,1,0,1,jssRVE7klB_7ZXZy4afnhg
