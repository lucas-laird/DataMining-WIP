The cashier is sweeping and dry mopping, and bussing tables inside restaurant plus taking your money and not going nowhere near a face bowl to wash her nasty hands. She instead, help the cook prepare your food. When I called her out for it, she asked the manager, who by the way didn't wash her hands either or put gloves on. I told them, I was calling the Southern Nevada Health Department on Both of them.

760997,2014-02-13,0,nhjYGdlR5Yw5-uOQqCVF8A,Absolute worst service.  Tremendously long wait. Three cars took over 15  minutes in drive through.  Each car waited 5minutes to order.  I thought they were ordering a bunch of burgers but when it was my turn to wait it also took 5 minutes.  Poor people stuck behind me.  There goes their entire lunch break.  No quick burger run here.  Drive a little bit further and get done quicker.,t3Kii94Z1kcXlh0rISom4Q,0,0,1,zaefoUK0OVuF59AfgOhfMg

I'm buggin cause if I'm not mistaken, I can pay for the upgrade. It's completely unheard of to tell a paying customer no, and can't, when the request is 100% possible as well as profitable. Poor job. Order cancelled",A6eI3xr2S5uQq6qZjRFWKw,1,0,1,chcoeYEGXJll-0rO59y2FA

The restaurant was tidy and clean and Monique at the register was nice and helped me decide on the right type of chicken sandwich. She had a great knowledge of the menu and was so nice and helpful. Monique made my trip here very pleasant. UPDATE: that was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had in a fast food joint, or maybe anywhere. So moist!

I opened to find they put everything on it, the burger was cold, the cheese wasn't melted and there were pickles, I hate pickles!  The fries were lukewarm.  I can't believe these people expect$15 an hour when they don't listen and can't get a simple order right.",CLcZ660ZCkATjYsf0PnNqA,0,0,1,ARQbwsgxTgQpmEDbmBb0jw

I'm at this location all the time and it's rare that I don't get excellent service. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. All of their sandwiches are really good, but the crispy chicken is amazing! If you're looking for something sweet, try the vanilla frosty always good on a hot day.",ymfXldDYJ5NZmCBqr-oWSg,0,0,5,oiYKGQ6jsFlgzxP4h-JFdQ
