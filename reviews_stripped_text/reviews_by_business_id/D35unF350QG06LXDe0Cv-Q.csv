The food is fresh and the people that work here are so friendly I might even go try another PT's I don't think you could get any better. The lady that cooks the food brought it out to me it was great.,j6lWJPlm-AtFrC4hsnVwaQ,1,1,4,xYPGl3YU8W1rzGkXymih-A
1279762,2015-12-13,0,D35unF350QG06LXDe0Cv-Q,Went to this location my first time service was slow and they wasn't even busy I order a salad and a French dip with fries .. The fries was soggy and the beef looked fake on the sandwich .. It also tasted dry the beer was kinda warm also .. The waitress was kinda to herself not check on us at all but stuff her face behind the bar .. I asked about their sports book app on how to sign up on the Machine but the players card feature was broke .. All and all I will not be returning to this location,5wlul4_XRgC46l4msy7xew,0,0,2,6ddhnF5PFGmQUuLTzco4ig

The place was fairly empty, we were the only table and there were 5 or 6 people playing machines at the bar, and it took over 30mins for 2 omelettes. The server dropped the creamer containers on the carpeted floor and just scooped them up and have them to us. I like PT's but would not go back to this one.",SuBtVsJu9FJTyGgAeQoBbQ,0,0,2,a2jxBKSNgi0-pvlR8q-vUA

2843360,2014-04-06,2,D35unF350QG06LXDe0Cv-Q,"Very small PTs. We usually just come here to eat during happy hour because it's just right down the street. 

Coming here so often we became known with the bartender, Jeff. He's the greatest. I'm notorious for googling cocktails. So I would just shout out some drinks to him & he would gladly make them. Sometimes I would come in & he would be like I have a drink you're gonna like and of course I love it! Some nights I would crave a certain taste & I'll let him know and he'll just put some stuff together for me. He's amazing. 

For the food-- it's bar food. The beau loves their chicken wings so that's what we usually get. The pizzas are half off during happy hour so once in a while we'll get a pizza. 

Last night the cook wasn't there though, disappointingly! So we just had a few cocktails and left.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,4,3,3,ZpbSmuhP6mH3UZ1S316WdA

What makes this one is the staff, they are much friendlier than most of the PTs that I have been too around on a consistent basis.

Kyle and Nicole were working and they were very friendly and welcoming. I had a build your own veggie pizza and it was cooked well, the crust was perfect not soggy and was very tasty. I definitely recommend this location to others.",95-UKLmklGkiINNFFt0viw,2,1,4,i9yjYkte19TMo1NxciflSQ

When you walk in it is pretty dim but, it was a solid setting. Happy hour was from 12AM-2AM so we came at a perfect time to order a few drinks for cheap. 

The bartender was genuinely friendly and offered some groovy suggestions on what to drink based off what drinks you like. 

Pretty spacious bar with lots of video poker at the bar area. I did not really walk around the place but it seems like a neat place to chill. 

Overall really respectable bar to chill with a couple buddies and the drinks were great!",39FT2Ui8KUXwmUt6hnwy-g,1,1,4,wYeU14EdGLqIHh-4mlyozA

A bar should have two important things other than liquor; good service and decent food. Missing all three at this location. 

The coleslaw in a small ranch container was a joke and the burnt fried fish was nothing but bites of oil. 

The burnt fries tasted like the burnt fish :(",ZJDvoG6iMtYYQhrzN4POFw,0,0,2,6nmGwprBxVJWx1TveCpWKg
