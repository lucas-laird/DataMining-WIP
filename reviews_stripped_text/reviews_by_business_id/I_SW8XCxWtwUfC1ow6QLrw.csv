It's amazing to me that the owner Lloyd, can't see through his bullshit.  But then again, every dog has his day; I can't wait!",GsPRMqHNkXQD5n8-2GC4kw,0,0,1,UNK-1U61nmOSUKC_Sjk9tA

I hear they still like to drop in but when I was there it was quiet.  Just a quick stop to see what's new.  Reasonably comfortable, gambling (video poker/keno), etc.",PUdifmlsaUMIfPlhQnZbHg,2,1,3,t9L_DSPdjdbpZw7ZfOYIpg
1562152,2015-10-08,0,I_SW8XCxWtwUfC1ow6QLrw,If you're looking a place that you want to relax and have a good time without all the crazy theatrics of the strip. This is the place. Make sure you see big Vinny for the full experience he is a true New Yorker who has a heart of gold and takes care of this place like no other. Don't be mistaken if you act a fool everyone will let you know. The staff here is the best and make sure to grab some pizza while you're in there. It is top notch.,pbwC6ScuSACadK7rkjUOww,0,0,5,GtTiaspboYt19nKjQqZWeA
3527432,2015-12-16,0,I_SW8XCxWtwUfC1ow6QLrw,"Wow!  As manager of Scandals Salon & Day Spa, I chose this place for our Annual Holiday Party for 80 technicians and guests.  It was a blast!!!   The place was decorated like what you'd expect in downtown Manhattan, Larry cooked for us an amazing spread including his signature Sausage and Peppers (Yum!), and Janis was a great bartender.  The layout of the place was perfect for our event - we brought in a karaoke act, and tore up (in a good way) the stage and dance floor.  Can't wait to rebook for next year!",k-n8iYUR9mDf4ohlK5-1hA,0,0,5,ifpR2rIgMnXMfXnfUEjuAw

But one of the guys use to write and sing with Bobby Blue Bland!  And I love me some Bobby Blue Bland!  The drinks are affordable, and the crowd is a more mature crowd!  The waitress was cool!  I will be back!  To hear some down home, southern soul blues!

They had a karaoke night for a short time about a year or two ago, but every time the owner was in, the host had to turn the music down...almost to the point of not needing a microphone.

if you want a quiet bar, don't have a karaoke night.

I love dive bars, but this place was just seedy.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,0,0,2,7VJWDzk_3i118dW20NWn1w

NY Yankee fans will give this place 8 stars. No food here so I gave it 3.",aGNvO5rjmeHspcpGZNOoQw,0,1,3,06H_LDfEDByzqlKchh23Dg
