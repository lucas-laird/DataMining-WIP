98924,2013-12-27,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"I went to the French Market for the all you can eat BBQ beef ribs.   First of all, even though they call it BBQ it's not.  The ribs are roasted in an oven, and then just before serving the cook slathers some BBQ sauce on the ribs, puts them on the fire for 60 seconds and then serves them.  There is no BBQ flavor, no smoke, no spice rub, no falling off the bone tender.  They don't give you a steak knife so eating them is a pain.  The ribs have been cut so that the only meat is the little strip of meat between the bones.  Very disappointing - but all you can eat - for about $10 if you are a member of the players club.   

The salad bar had the bare minimum ingredients to call it a salad.

The deserts were more looks than taste.  Tasteless meringue in the lemon meringue pie, tasteless pumpkin pie, cannolli with barely any filling.  Best desert was the cream puff.

There are much better buffets in LV (but they don't have beef ribs).",B3tQ-TJ6Ca_AxKn15VAEEA,0,0,2,hv09My27pHp-WimRBAL7lQ

I'm just not that enthusiastic about this place as my 1st two visits. Tonight was the Seafood Buffet for $17.99 with $1 off with players card. The oysters were absolutely scary looking. I've never seen oysters look so dried and shriveled up before. And there was a large bowl loaded with them. But we were happy with the salmon, the king crab, snow crab, shrimp, craw fish, mussels and clams. But not so impressed with the $37 we paid for this. We could have gotten the same things at Asia Buffet for $28 and enjoyed the oysters and a larger sushi selection. The desserts here deserve 5 stars because they all are very delicious. I have no complaints. 

I'll be back.... just not for Friday night seafood. Any other time I want to say will be my money's worth.",XCKrTNG6x-3UJdvQPb8htQ,1,1,4,pEC9btuK1Dy8yMmsK0TRdQ

The BBQ station serves sour cream, horseradish & another sour cream that's lumpy. Instead of labeling it sour cream/horseradish mix they call it sour cream. Desserts are dry. The carrot cake especially.  There's a breakfast station too, although I couldn't find it. Everything I had was bland, dry or had a funky taste to it: chili tasted like corn, dumplings bland & dry, same with fried rice. Someone in my group found it & he took one bite of scrambled eggs & pushed his plate away. I'm not a buffet person but have been to a few that are actually good. This isn't one of them.

I was forced (yes, forced!) to go here with my family - party of 8 with two toddlers. Usually, for big parties wiith messy toddlers, the host would normally sit you in the corner away from other gobbling patrons, but not our case. we were just a few feet away from the food, yet not too close from foot traffic.
(that's 1 star)

The buffet, being in the Orleans casino, serves southren food (among other ""international theme"") - from crawfish to hush puppies. They also have cooked and raw oysters. Not bad for a $20. The only drawback is the desert section - they dont have much to offer tehre. But then again, I get stuffed easily and usually dont have much room for sweet shutffs.
(that's 2 stars)

This is no Rio buffet, so there's really not much waiting. However, being that it was graduation week, there were a lot of locals with their graduating kids (still on their cap n gown). Stilll, we only waited for about 8 minutes.

655529,2014-08-12,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"I was in Vegas for 4 days and ate here twice.
First time was for breakfast, a decent selection of stuff to choose from; you have fruit, waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage (normal breakfast foods). Nothing to spectacular on that end considering the biscuits and gravy they had was below my expectations (gravy lacked flavor almost as if they were afraid to make that traditional peppery white gravy you crave with biscuits and gravy), drink service was also a little slow but it was to be expected for a Saturday. But then you get to the desserts which were available during breakfast; not only did they have donuts but they also had cake and pie. I'm a sweets fanatic but have a pretty severe nut allergy and the lady working there (I can't remember her name but super sweet and a little older lady with brown hair in a bun) was very understanding of that and gave me a full list of everything with nuts, cooked near nuts, and may possibly be contaminated with nuts. I was pretty happy with that since I got a fresh slice of the most delicious peach caramel cake I've ever eaten and convinced me to give the buffet another go but at lunch to see if it was better than breakfast.
Second time was for lunch and lets say I was left feeling a little disappointed. The cooks  behind the buffet prepping food didn't seem to know much about the foods and had to go track down other chefs to ask if anything contained nuts or was cooked in peanut oil; while nothing was prepared in peanut oil other foods ""could have nuts"". Disappointing since they couldn't name anything that had nuts at all and I had to guess at what would or wouldn't be safe to try and eat. The lunch options were not very impressive either, the fried fish was kind of ""meh"" the pasta at the American station was very oily/greasy almost as if they had only boiled the noodles and melted butter onto them. Italian food left A LOT to be desired, the pizza wasn't very great but even bad pizza is good pizza, but there were not many pasta options. Plain noodles and only meat or marina sauce, a few options for various different pastas (none of which really stood out) and one sad looking vegetable lasagna. Drinks this time were quicker to arrive and be refilled. And then we get to desserts, whoever makes these do a superb job and they ladies who work in that area (the one from Saturday was there again) are the nicest workers I have ever met. They saved what would have been a disappointing lunch with the offering of a delicious blueberry cheesecake that I had two pieces of.

Like a lot of sub $20 buffets, the food offerings here need to be attacked with a strategy in mind. I have my own system for deciding what to pick, but the most important buffet rule is to immediately stop eating anything that isn't GOOD. There's a lot of crap at this buffet and a lot of stuff that's so-so, but there's some real good stuff to be eaten, as long as you're not busy chowing down on dried-out, fake, instant, imitation, bland funk.

I found the roasted chicken to be excellent, like actually worthy of being on a plate being served in a regular restaurant. The crawdads were unique and it was my first time trying them. I didn't care for the taste, but I don't have anything to compare them to, so I switched over to the peel and eat shrimp. The salad bar was decent enough. The bread pudding was amazingly good. The service sucked, as my water was never refilled, I had to scrounge for a second napkin, and at one point my table was totally cleared while I was up getting more food.

Breakfast was about $8. The OJ was fake and tasted funny. The coffee was not bad, but not good. Skip scrambled eggs as they're fake too. Instead, get your eggs off the top off the Benedict offerings. You don't want to eat the whole Benedict, just the egg, as the rest is gross. I have a weakness for cheap-o breakfast sausage with syrup on top and I wasn't disappointed. Don't bother hoping for a nice pastry to pair with your last cup of coffee because they're all pretty horrible.

Overall, FMB is worth the price it seems, but don't think you're going to get the variety of a full buffet, as most of the food is no good. Be picky and search out the few gems to be found, then jump in with both feet.",Rg2idPf4S7Cb13anamh02w,0,0,3,2dL8k0sIY-pQ10G1wEEFiw

I thought the first time was a fluke. In the past, I never noticed them  putting out food that is way past it's prime.  However, there were several items I used to enjoy that should have gone into a compost bin rather than being served as food.  Watermelon and some items at the salad bar were especially disappointing since I had enjoyed them in the past. My boyfriend is the meat eater, and he said the quality of the meat had gone down too.

The pricer Sunday brunch was the most pleasant of the meals we had.   The free champagne, which wasn't bad, helped make the experience more enjoyable.  They had better fruit on Sunday, and had a  chocolate fountain to dip fruit, rice krispy treats, macaroons and marshmallows in.   

I never cared for the cakes and pies at the French Market Buffet.  They are pretty, but like most Vegas buffet desserts, they taste like they use a cheap oil instead of butter.  The cobbler is usually good, and so is their ice cream and gelato.

We always like the servers and tip them even if the quality of the food is bad.  It is not their fault.",ieutzDRTNv3iXVdgpUFbXQ,0,0,2,Oc-ojCFawlnQ-TDUvIqCwg

1099941,2017-12-26,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"4 stars for great value in terms of price vs quality and selection among near-strip buffets. Removing one star for making me poop longer than usual. But adding a star for nice decor. Removing another star for making me look fat. I'd also subtract couple stars for putting me into food comma for 2 hours, which makes this place a little more expensive as time is money. But the overall experience was very good and I'm giving it 5 stars to negate older reviews posted before remodeling, as this place now deserves much better rating.
Anyway, I wasn't aware of the recent remodeling and was nicely surprised when visiting for Christmas Day dinner.  I usually don't care for expensive remodels that are often used to increase the price, but in this case it worked somewhat well and the Orleans buffet now deserves the place among the top buffets in Vegas, even though still far from perfect. There are no crab legs (except Friday nights) and therefore this buffet cannot be compared to the best ones that do serve them. Yet, the price reflects the lack of crab legs and justifies rating this location among the top of those that do not have them. The food quality and selection makes this place among the top 5 in Vegas on my list, little behind Bacchanal, M, and Wicked Spoon, while beating all of them on price.
I was especially surprised with ribs, which were better than those served in many restaurants. They had good selection of other meats, although some could've been added only for Christmas. Green beans, sweet potatoes, and other vegetables were fresh and cooked well. Lots of other selections from various cuisines, at least during Christmas Day. Some things that I would like to see added would be mushrooms and au gratin potatoes. Desert selection not as amazing as top buffets but still along better ones in Vegas. The holiday price was the same as the regular price during nights and weekends ($19 with rewards card), therefore I'm assuming that the selection and quality may be similar every day.
Nice decor and friendly waiter further helped providing great experience.",pt3fBzxa7om-CQESpv0HYQ,1,1,5,bKNXlHNlScJlJklGWCSh7w

Never has it been an issue where they only give one of us the discount but today the sassy grouch at the counter wanted my husbands card too. Oh well it's just $1. So we are seated at a table with no place settings and a bowl with one coffee creamer. I was waiting for a family to return to their table as if it was in use. the waitress comes and gets us silverware. She takes our order. Me: coffee and a water, him: champagne and an orange juice. She rolled her effin eyes at him! Really Zoraya? Is his order  really going to ruin your day with your busy section of 4 tables? She didn't even refill our drinks.

1483722,2017-12-23,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"This review is for the Friday night seafood buffet.  $31.99 for subpar food.  Before the renovation, the price was cheaper and the food was so much better.  King crab was also on the seafood buffet, but not anymore.

The crab legs were so skinny like the Chinese food buffet and the meat did not come out in 1-piece.  No matter what you did, the meat kept breaking apart and stuck in the shell.  The oysters had quite a bit of shell in the meat.  Luckily the crawfish was huge and the dungenous crab was pretty good.  

Prime rib was non existent but roast beef was on the menu.  When the prime rib did come out, it looked very dry and unappealing.  Everything else was just ""average.""

If you are charging $31.99 premium price for a seafood buffet dinner, the food better be up to par with the price that is charged.

Unfortunately, you are paying for their renovations with a lower quality food product than when it was the French Market Buffet.

Sadly I uses to love this buffet, but now I will never frequent this place as the quality has gone downhill.  The breakfast buffet is just as bad.  Please make the necessary changes if you want to charge strip buffet prices.",ZvNDnyc0uTSeelyWXSN-OA,0,0,2,G_eiW_U2E6JOdzGbYwLRwg

Anyhow me and my friend got in because me and him use the coupon we had where you get a free meal at the buffet so was lucky to not spend much of anything here. Now onto the food although it was good they didn't have many options to choose from with the foods at each station it was limited at best but the food was good just wish they kept up with the freshness of the food I went to get my plate the first time got some chicken bit into it as I sat down and it was dry and not that fresh but the second time I got some it was fresh and chewable just wish they were consisted with stuff like that also got the pizza it was good and hush puppies they were delicious and I got some mac and cheese out of the rest of the stuff I mentioned that was the worst no flavor bland and even if you added salt or pepper to it it still tasted awful. Besides that are server who got us our drinks worked her was very friendly and always at are table to make sure we were okay and got our refills we also gave him a tip as he worked hard and went that extra mile for us. Overall this buffet is okay would I say this buffet is one of the best out here no not a chance but you do get your money's worth besides the limited options of food and dessert and you'll leave here full I probably might come back one day as it's not really that bad and the customer service is good I give this place 3 stars.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,1,1,3,xVCyhiaYSLVUuxf-Qi4eYA

We visited the buffet at the Orleans hotel for dinner for the first time since it was remodeled. Standing outside the entrance - the remodeled buffet looks very nice and classy - quite a change from the old French Market Buffet. The name has also changed to the Medley Buffet. The buffet now has several cooking stations with much improved food ! The buffet was just OK before - now it's definitely gone up a notch ! Everything we had was very tasty and their selection was significantly improved ! I would now recommend the newly remodeled Medley Buffet at the Orleans !,9cLyJWjfIc-xnWOmmHHt-Q,1,1,4,obk9Oh-BnQ9YCUT_bA0xeA

Directions from the Las Vegas Strip at Tropicana. cross the street to the north side of of Tropicana. there you will find a bus stop. Take any bus going East, but there is usually only just one. get off one the Orleans is anounced.

Mike starting to get a Players Club card as this will give you one to two dollars off.

Directions to French Market is very well marked.

Once you pay and are stated the choices are unlimited. come prepared with what food styles you are looking for. the good stuff like the sea food and barbecue, it's at the far left. this is also where things get very exciting and tantalizing.

At least four different types of ribs in addition to a large carving station, with some of the largest portions of smoked brisket you can imagine. perfectly seasoned, with many rings of smoke, and a fatty bark if you request that. I always request fatty bark pieces. my serving was at least a half pound.

it's a good point to remember that it in a buffet like this, to take advantage of things that you don't normally get to eat so skip the salad bar and go for the expensive things like shrimp and grilled vegetables.

Shock and awe on the dessert station. the tiramisu was so good I went back for thirds.  but in addition there were several varieties of gelato as well as sugar free desserts.

Service was five-star five-diamond. but my diet Pepsi and my water never went empty and I did not have to ask. licked clean plates were whisked away unobtrusively when you would come back to the buffet. From the cashiers to the cleaning crew, everyone greeted you with a sincere smile and kind words.

What really stood out was the number of regulars and locals, that have a choice of hundreds of buffets. What keeps them coming back is the delicious food and service. and I do not have to reply on cheap gimmicks like the Cosmopolitan....stop putting food in different containers such as miniature skillets. this is nothing more than a gimmick to get you to eat less.

I would recommend French market to anyone visiting Las Vegas.",8v3aEuuHEJU_8h0OgmsfDA,6,4,5,qLdLseJG5uoAA0gzuuoEZg

I went to the renovated buffet the week they opened. While the food was disappointing, there were a few items that were edible and I thought it showed promise. I went back today and I could barely find anything worth eating.  Anything that cost more than a few pennies to slop up was removed since their grand opening. 

They raised prices but lowered their food quality with the reopening.

In just a week food quality has fallen dramatically. If they keep this up they will just be serving ten versions of potatoes and twenty variations of cabbage  and some rice with nothing else soon. Instead of crispy fried chicken they had frozen pre-fried chicken wings which were cold, soggy and disgusting. Instead of a rich oxtail stew they had dried out ""roasted"" sweet potatoes. The clams and mussels were replaced with shells that were pretty much devoid of anything else. Their BBQ ribs were so over cooked and dry they were worse than jerky.  

Service was terrible as well. Waitress was very nice but she could not keep up with all her tables and our dishes were piled high and sitting there throughout the meal. 

It's such bad management to invest so much money and effort into creating a gorgeous new buffet only to ruin it by basically serving reheated the cheapest frozen foods out of some deep discount food warehouse.  I was really looking forward to this new buffet and utterly disappointed.  My review may be a bit harsh and overly critical but Ii really want management to fix this buffet.  There is so much potential to have a destination worthy buffet at the Orleans.

$17.99 for champagne Sunday Brunch (without player's card) and they did not mess around with the champagne. They basically just poured the entire contents of the bottle into our drink glasses (and it was just two of us). The servers were very attentive and fun. 

The buffet itself: heaven

Made to order omelet station-delicious with plenty of options.

Seafood! Delicious baked clams, sushi, lox for bagels, calamari, and plenty if other options I did not even try (including crawfish which I thought I would try but instead became our table mascot).

Plenty of fresh fruit and cereals including oatmeal and grits. 

The rotisserie chicken melted in my mouth and had I not filled up on everything, else the honey glazed ham looked amazing. 

Dessert selection: wow. So many cookies, pastries, pies, and cakes to choose from, but I had to have the chocolate fountain. 

If I could have stayed for more time (and had a bigger stomach), I think I would have tried everything in the Mexican and Italian sections because everything looked delicious.

I also don't like competing for food at the buffet line.  So, that said, what I'm saying is that the cons are that i don't like that the place was too popular.

And I can understand why it was popular on the day we went.  Of course, the senior couples are eating at half price, which is a great deal because the regular price for lunch is $8.99.  $8.99 itself is a very good price for this buffet.  The variety is good: you have American, Italian, Asian, Mexican, etc. stations, and the quality is good for a buffet (I tend to rate buffet food with a lower expectation that sit-down food).  I enjoyed the shredded pork carnitas, the chile verde pork was okay, and the bbq ribs, I enjoyed also - I can't remember everything I had, now, but I do remember sampling a variety, and I normally don't do that at a buffet.  I normally have two servings and stop.  Here, I think I went back three times, then went for soup (I had a cup/bowl of the hot and sour, and that was a bit disappointing - the broth was too thin).  

The popular item seemed to be the craw-fish. I passed by tables where people had stacks of craw-fish on their plates.  I myself, took a nice quantity of shrimp, and except for peeling the shell, basically had a nice shrimp cocktail (on a plate).

It's even better if you're a gambler there because you get a discount, sometimes a comp!  I have been coming here for years, and the food is always consistently good.

They offer the usual American-Asian-Mexican-Italian-salad bar standard that I've come to expect in the average buffet here in Vegas, so you shouldn't feel like you won't find something you'll enjoy.

I eat here once a week or so, and my favorite go-to items are their BBQ items... I love their ribs and their brisket!  I also judge buffets by their mashed potatoes and I believe this buffet has some of the best in town -- none of that powdered potato crap, this stuff is legit, smothered in yummy butter!  They have a mongolian grill if you're the type who likes fresh-grilled asian fare as well.

They have a really great selection for dessert!  Although my favorite is always the gelato, if you're lucky enough for them to have chocolate chip cookies that day, make sure you swoop some up!  

I usually go for lunch or dinner, but the other day I woke up early enough for the breakfast buffet for the first time in a long time, and was pleased to see that they offered many gluten-free items, and their made-to-order omelets were on point!

Great selection and affordably-priced, this is my little gem of a buffet off the strip.",wqhuRhMwwlbuqW9xa1li8A,3,4,4,XKh9ldWlAbheyA6b2AvtJg

It was cheap to begin with, but they recently lowered prices and you still get a discount with a Coast Card, even if you have no points on your card. A lot of people seem to just go for the crawfish, which were OK, but nothing special since they appear to have just been boiled in water. I'm used to them being boiled in seasoning so I don't really like them plain. However, there is so much more to eat than the crawfish. The salad bar is nothing special, but they had watermelon. I think they are just coming into season since I didn't see them at too many other buffets. There were lines for the watermelon here. I was lucky to grab some just as they were restocking.

My friends reported the BBQ station was very good, but I mostly skipped it since we had Brazilian BBQ the night before and I wasn't really in the mood for more meat. I ended up eating a lot from the Cajun station and the USA station. The Asian station had stuff for Mongolian BBQ, but I didn't see too many people take advantage of it. I should have since I love Mongolian BBQ, but I really couldn't take too much grease that day. The Mexican station had stuff for DIY tacos, but I was too lazy. The pasta station was probably the most disappointing. The pizza was OK, but the other items were either horribly mislabeled or complete failures. It could have been the former since they did have Salisbury steaks in the USA section labeled as terriyaki chicken.

The dessert section is a big surprise. Not only did they have some pretty good cakes and rolls, they also had a good gelato selection. Overall, I really enjoyed this buffet. I honestly could have paid twice as much and still be fairly satisfied. They also have beer and wine specials ($6 bottle of wine) for those who are interested.

CHEAP!!!!...but expect what you paid for...

We've always wondered and were curious about the casino buffets away from the strip.  On Friday around noon, we had to go to AutoZone and Orleans Casino just happened to be around the corner...we said...why not?

The buffet has no lines which was nice...Yes it is nothing like the buffet you experience on the strip but for the price, it is ok...not bad.

* Price:  $8.99/person...CHEAP

* Food: NO CRABS but small cocktail shrimps with shells still on them.  My most memorable was Mongolian BBQ...it's descent (oh don't ask for beef...it's tough and tasteless) Crawfish available...but dry.  Oh I would stay away from the desserts...

* Service = pretty attentive.

* Ambiance = honestly, it has a feel of run-down old casino buffet but it's ok.  It has it's charm...very relaxed and casual.  

Ok, no sophisticated gourmet here...basically, if you dream of being able to go to a mall food court and eat whatever you want, all you want....this place is it.",7UBDZmeF101orAc72KeofQ,0,0,3,KAnpraeLV9I_tJcLryMwRg

Service: 

The service was okay - our waiter was a bit slow and they didn't really clear out our plates as quickly as we ate...actually it would stack up quite a bit before he or anyone came to clear it. He was also hard to wave down to get refill on drinks. It did get a little busier with big parties of people coming in - looked like there was a graduation somewhere cause a lot of graduates came in to eat with their families. 

Food:

They have pretty good selection of cuisines and not to mention an unbelievable amount of choices at the dessert section. They had a lot of comfort food for sure - fried chicken, mac n cheese, jambalaya, etc. What's interesting was that they had really good pizza - usually buffet pizzas are okay - but the pizza here was really cheesy and the crust was really perfect - not super thick and not too thin - so to my surprise I think their pizza was pretty awesome. 

They had a lot of good choices for desserts too - 7 different flavors of Gelato - the peach ice cream was the best and the Watermelon Sorbet was very refreshing. In addition, they also had Tiramisu, red velvet cake, cookies and just too many to name - However I did like their Chocolate Cream Pie the most - it was pretty heavenly.

First, although the previous buffet was cute and rustic, it was clearly aging. I love the new set-up and decor. Its chic and modern and I like that it feels more ""open"" and fresh.

That said, the food was hit or miss. Some things were pretty good, while others weren't great. The shrimp scampi and the stuffing were mushy, but the cuts of turkey and salad bar were delicious. It seemed to be like that with most of the food, so quality wasn't consistent. 

Our waitress was a bit MIA most of the night. I get that its a buffet so you don't need constant attention, but we didn't see her often and that made it difficult to get refills on drinks or dirty plates taken. Other than that, the service was adequate. 

There's a nice variety on desserts but I don't like the addition of having some of the small desserts behind the glass case and having to ask for them. It made it feel like I was inconveniencing them, or that I shouldn't take as much, even though its a buffet and had they been out in the open I would've gotten one of each. 

Overall, its a decent value buffet. I would come here for a lunch and maybe a dinner again. There are better buffets around, but this wasn't the worst by far.",COst8UurHPQmwGecun-7eg,2,0,3,lW4TsqByYbvpBJ1qgdEHDg

The food isn't much better. Everything that I tried was either overcooked or bland except for the fried chicken wings and ice cream which ended up being most of what I ate. Healthy right?

And a row of everything else stretching across the entire length of the buffet starting. Most of the food wasn't the greatest but their BBQ section had to be one my favorites.

This new buffet is a lot brighter and a lot ""fancier"" looking than before. The layout is just one long row stretched across the length of the buffet.

I showed up 3 min late. My fault no doubt. Along with about 10 others who were turned away. Considering just two days ago I got in line 10 min late I was surprised that they were enforcing the clock so strictly. But ""rules are rules.""

What I can't handle, though, is being lied to. I was watching hundreds of people in line for a buffet, and they told me that they ""didn't have someone who can take my money."" (lie) Then I'm told there are ""no open tables,"" when I could see many open tables. (lie #2) Our group is then told that there is a ""power issue"" (possible lie). I asked, ""so what about all those people in line to eat, are you going to make them all leave?"" She says ""yes."" I was floored and said I would like to see that... So she then starts going table to table, but nobody actually leaves.

I know this because at this point I was standing away from the front door looking at my phone deciding where to go for food when hotel security surrounds me ...

Now ... I know that I was late and I know that they weren't going to let me in. I lost, I moved on. I never yelled, I never made threats or swore. I had what I thought was nothing more than a conversation with a restaurant manager. The fact that she resorted to calling security shows that she is out of her depths in a position of leadership. I cannot imagine what she would have done if I truly was a risk. 

I can handle being rejected. But if you are going to obviously lie to me then I have a problem with you insulting my intelligence. Just say, ""sir, we don't want to let you in "" and be done with it. Telling me you ""can't"" and then making up of a bunch of made up nonsense is really insulting.

2382720,2009-10-20,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"I wondered why my dad took me here several years ago. Its because its cheap and almost a good competition to Rio's World Buffet. I think the price is $8 per person for lunch. I did not have a Orleans Club Card, but $8 is a deal. The Sahara Hotel has $8.99 Buffet with a Card, but with the Orleans, you probably would save $1 or $2. I remember my total was around $16. Very Good Deal!!

They had Salad, Mexican or Tex-Mex Station, Chinese Station, American, Italian, and their own big Dessert Station. I mainly went to American Station since I always fall in love with Mac N Cheese. I had sandwiches, and bunch of other Americana stuff. They had a lot of food, but I only had three plates. Like my headline says...I am a Big Guy, but I don't eat a lot.

Orleans is away from the strip, but somewhat is small scaled version of the Rio. Orleans has their French Market Buffet and Rio has their World Buffet. If you are on a budget and not wait a long line...go to the Orleans. Its pretty cheap for lunch without a Club Card and food is better than the Sahara Buffet and probably as close to the Rio Buffet without the high price. 

Lunch Ends around 3:30pm. Not sure what time Dinner starts during the weekdays. Very reasonable and not too crowded, but the food is very good and not seem too be mass-produced.

The food is good!  I recommend going straight for the crawfish and beef ribs.  They are the ""signature"" items!  The crawfish is boiled in a cajun style broth has great flavor without being too spicy.  The beef is super tender and well seasoned.  The good thing is that because these are very popular items, they're constantly being replenished.  Aside from these two items, everything else was okay.  I sampled the gumbo, mushroom stir fry, and a few of their desserts.  All were good, but I spent most of my time eating crawfish!

2504812,2017-09-13,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"As of today, it is the Medley Buffet. A real big step in the wrong direction, IMHO. Whoever was in charge of this remodel was very foolish! Gone is the festive, colorful feel of the old buffet. Welcome to the dreary somber feel of corporate gloom. There are grey walls all over the seating area that separate you from the food and other diners. There is literally nothing to look at. I'll miss the whimsical signs directing you to the various types of food they serve. Still no restroom in the buffet.

I was there for lunch today and found that even though they raised the entry price, I didn't see any roast beef, turkey, shrimp or craw fish like at the old buffet. Perhaps I missed them because the food area is more spread out and there are no signs.

They also eliminated any dedicated line for disabled people which shows me that they don't realize that they have a much older customer base than most casinos. Maybe they just don't care. Remember, I said whoever is in charge was foolish and inconsiderate of customer needs!

Whoever made up the new pricing is also foolish as they post on the website and at door that breakfast is from 8am to 10am and lunch is from 11am to 3 pm. What happens between 10am and 11am? I called and asked and was told that if you come after 10am you will be charged the lunch price ($3 more) BUT you won't get any lunch items until 11am when they start putting it out! Who made this ripoff deal up? Maybe they were rushed to come up with this new ridiculous pricing. They only had 4 long months before they reopened. READ UPDATE BELOW...

To sum up, a cold dreary atmosphere, raised prices but fewer pricey foods, no accommodations  for handicapped people, unnecessary walls all around, still no restrooms in the buffet, and unreasonable high pricing etc., a definite step in the wrong direction for me. I much preferred it the way it used to be!

UPDATE: I went back today to the new buffet to take another look and found that I was given incorrect information yesterday. The reason for lack of pricing between 10am and 11am is that they actually close and stop admitting customers for that hour! They do the same thing from 3pm to 4pm. I'm retired and don't keep track of time anymore. I go to the Orleans to gamble and as soon as I either run out of money or get hungry, I head for the buffet. Now I have to worry if it'll be open since they close twice for two hours a day during the daytime. I guess I'll have to find somewhere else to gamble and eat.",MQcMuIWh8vHBYm9i7Z4Vvw,7,0,2,Dd-QHgN60S-cnxKKGi0UnQ
2523539,2010-12-02,1,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"While working I was talking to a bus driver who I will call ""JOE""( because THATS HIS NAME!!) & we were talking ""Buffets"" & he said I had to try this one. So to show what truly nice people I have encountered thus far in Las Vegas, Joe not only makes a recommendation to this place, BUT gives me a $4 off coupon & meets me on Tropicana Ave to give it to me and drives me there with his wife & daughter as they were on their way to run errands. HOW COOL IS THAT?? (Answer: VERY!!)

 So I ended up paying $5 and change for this AWESOME Buffet using the coupon. And let me tell you now THIS PLACE IS HUGE!! The entire dining area has to be as big as a basketball court if not bigger. And for the size and the crowd on hand, it was a very nice and orderly atmosphere, well lit and pleasantly quiet with no crying babies and no standing up ""Peekers"" looking over the back of the booth I was sitting in. (I like to feed them string beans!!)

I asked to be seated in a booth and was gladly told to sit wherever I wanted. There are several stations = BBQ, American, Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and a HUGE island of deserts.

I made a good attempt to try as many items from as many stations as I could and ended up liking the Chinese station the best that had spring noodles mixed wt vegetables & Beef  that was really fresh and good.

Joe had really pushed the BBQ Beef ribs saying they were the best but the selection the day I went had ALOT of fat on them and I had to pick at them to take it off. And while I'm complaining I might add that the onion rings, fried fish & chicken fried steak had ALOT of breading on them that had me picking at it as well. Other than that though I really cant complain and have to give this place 2 thumbs up.

The Mexican station was extremely good with beef tacos and all the toppings and a spicy shredded chicken that made nice tacos as well. There were other selections such as enchaladas etc and it all looked very good.

The Italian station had speghetti, lasagna, pizza that all looked really good too. I have a sliver of a slice and it was very good and crispy and I tried a couple pcs of eggplant parmesean and it was off the hook good .

There was also peel n eat shrimp wt tartar & cocktail sauce as well as crawfish which looked good and I had one and still cannot see what the draw to these things are as its alot of work for very little pay-off in the way of meat. I chose to stick wt the shrimp & mixed them in wt my Chinese noodles mix & sliced open a couple spring rolls and put them inside. I always ""shrimp out"" my spring rolls!!

The aforementioned Desert Island had a little of everything = soft serve ice cream, strawberry & whipped cream toppings, scooped Ice Cream, Gellato, Pies, Cakes, Cheesecake, & cobblers. I tried the Coconut Cream Pie and the filling was off the hook (I had 2 pcs and had to stop myself from getting more!!) but the crust was soft and mushy-like and not to my liking at all and I didnt eat it. I also tried some soft serve Vanilla Ice cream  wt whipped cream and the taste of the shortening in the whipped cream came through and more cream & sugar was needed.

The waitstaff seemed nice enough but my Ice Water was'nt refilled, nor was I asked if I needed a refill. I didn,t so it wasnt really a big deal. The girl taking the plates off the table seemed to be working the hardest and I felt bad for her and took my plates up myself several times. I also hid a dollar under my dish within a dish so she would find it and not the waiter as she deserved it more than the waiters did.

Overall I have to recommend this buffet not only for the wide variety and selection, but the quality and good food offered. I only paid $5, but had I paid full price it would have still been worth it.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,4,2,4,CpAD_nkm0idnZLhMEVgXFw

2543593,2016-12-30,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"Let's be honest here. This is not Caesars Palace but that doesn't mean that it's not a good buffet for the venue you're eating it at.

To start with, understand that this is actually owned by a corporation that owns several different casinos here in town most of them called Coast. For example Gold Coast, Suncoast.

Which means you're going to get simular quality at all of these buffets but the Orleans is actually slightly above the cut of the others.

I'm only going to be talking about the seafood night, because if you pay a few dollars more it's the only night that it makes sense to go.

So, Friday nights are Seafood night. Typically in Las Vegas this is the night that most of the hotels put out Seafood.

It makes sense doesn't it? People get paid on Fridays, Seafood is consumed when people get paid and have extra money, unlike the strip hotels which can jack their prices up and put the food out every day of the week this is how the local hotels and casinos operate for seafood.

Okay, so what are you getting here?

Well, in addition to the regular fare, you're also getting snow crap period The Orleans snow crab is pretty decent. It's not skinny and small and actually quite large compared to other hotels here in town.

It comes served cold but you can also take it over to the Mongolian cooking station and have it heated up for you with different spices which is something that no one else offers.

Word of warning though, if you're like me and you can't eat seafood then you should probably avoid the Mongolian station all together. They literally cross contaminate like crazy which is the only reason I can't give the early and so true 5 star review.

Everything else at the buffet is actually quite good. The food is fresh and turned over on a regular basis.

The dessert bar is actually great they have gelato and lots of different desserts for anybody's tastes. Make room for dessert when you go to this one.

I can only assume that the rest of the week is just like Friday nights but just without Seafood with the exception of shrimp. I highly recommend the Orleans versus the other local hotels here in Las Vegas because the quality is pretty darn good the wait times are low and the service is great.",JacQo2YkmQYYItbN0GbeQg,1,0,4,n1P5BbT4Fv20exPETlLPew

The line to get in was pretty intense, but it went by fast so didn't wait longer than 20 minutes to get seated. The French Market has all sorts of food including: American, Italian, Mongolian, BBQ, Mexican, Chinese, and Seafood. They have 2 big salad bars and a pretty good dessert section, but seriously, who wastes time with salad at a buffet?! 

The beef ribs and prime rib from the carvers station were pretty good, probably one of my favorite things there on that day. I mostly took my chances with the huge variety of seafood there was to offer. The salmon, the king crab, snow crab, shrimp, craw fish, mussels and clams were all very good. The craw fish is sort of complicated to eat and so are the crab legs, which there was a crazy long line to get, haha. Fine, maybe I'm just dumb and don't know how to eat, but still I was getting impatient with the craw fish and crab legs. It's too much work for not that much meat, haha. 

They had an omelet station where you had omelets made for you after picking out what you want in it. It was whatever, not too impressed, takes too long and isn't the best omelet ever. The whole USA section of the buffet is pretty bland, very typical breakfast foods, but boring and flavorless. and I love breakfast foods, but that was a fail. The deserts looked so awesome, but I just had a little bit of ice cream, didn't want to go into food coma after.

Too bad I was driving home after otherwise I would've taken advantage of the unlimited Champagne and made them fill up my Viva boot for me, haha.

I'll begin on a positive note before delving into the depths of my irritation with this place. I went twice during my stay. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. The breakfast was one of the best breakfast buffets I have visited in a while and the dinner was pretty top notch as well. There was a good variety of steaks during the Saturday night dinner buffet with a good supporting cast of potatoes, veggies and other buffet staples. The grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms were a nice touch. The problem I have is with the mandatory 18 percent gratuity for a large party. We stayed at the Orleans over a weekend for a family reunion and gathering of friends who had not seen each other in some time. Our party for dinner was approaching 50 bodies and we got there prior to their opeing for dinner and gave plenty of notice ahead of time. We did not just show up and ask for a table for 50. We paid in small groups (immediate families, etc) and were all charged the 18 percent. I can see an 18 percent tip at a restaurant where the waiter or waitress takes your order, fills your drinks, deals with special requests and is attentive to your table. An 18 percent tip at a buffet is over the top to begin with, but outrageous when you consider the drinks were running empty and the waiter was rude and acted as though we were putting him out. The tip was in the $150 range for a lack luster, one-star performance from the waiter. If you have a casino ""Club Card"", you'll need one card for every two people to get the discount and there was no price break for children.

I anticipated the worst, knowing that buffets can often be filled with steamed scrambled eggs and microwaved ham.  Much to my pleasant surprise (a la the Easter Bunny bringing me a basketball hoop when I was 12 years old), the food was absolutely delicious.  The buffet has food stations for different types of food, and they all have cooks behind them doing it up right.  The food was average priced, but so much better than any of the others I've had in Vegas (even the ones I did like).  Although there was a huge line, it went by surprisingly quickly because they had plenty of tables to seat everyone.

Nothing too special about this buffet. There's a lot of different options but beyond that, the flavor does not call for a repeat visit....EXCEPT the beef brisket. That was fantastic and I was so surprised. Juicy, fatty, great flavor and seasoning. A MUST get before you fill up with everything else. Because everything else is standard and not great.

Pros: Selection. Each section has a different theme to it so you can pick and choose what you're feeling. Big dessert and salad islands in the middle, but nothing special about the desserts, just your standard selection. Service is good, they're attentive with clearing plates and getting refills.

Overall
4 Stars

Gold medal - BEST Fried Chicken Wings
Silver medal - Great service
Bronze medal - Great price

The name is a bit deceiving.  It is not french food, but a mixture of Mexican, Chinese, Italian, & American.  Lots to choose from!

They have the BEST fried chicken.  It was crispy and juicy!!  I want more!!  They also had like 4 other types of chicken items.  Lots of variety to choose from.

The service is really a hit or miss, but during this last visit......... It was a HIT.  The server was super fast, nice, and attentive.  Every time we were done with our dishes he was there to clean it up.  He came by offering refills without us having to flag him down.  He was great. I even over tipped him.

We went on Saturday during Memorial Day weekend.  They did not increase the price to Holiday pricing, which was nice.  It was still $10.99 for lunch.  If you have a players card you, +1 guest are $1 off each.  $9.99 for a HUGE buffet selection is not bad at all!

The place has a very nice variety of food, especially for a frequent buffet lover like myself. They had some odd noodle dishes, fresh pork tacos, a noodle station.

Line was lonng, considering it was Labor Day and they had wrestlers in town.

Here, some workers just looked Unhappy with their job. It was packed and it was noticeable on their face at their frustration, especially with some cooks in the back. When a customer tried to make small talk and ask about the food the cook just gave him a nasty glare and shrugged. I don't expect the cooks to be all jolly, but it just felt since they aren't acknowledging guests then how can I expect them to make tasty quality food if they don't give a f$!k?! Plus, our waiter needed an attitude adjustment. I asked for sprite and she rolled her eyes. 

Honestly, I only enjoyed the spring rolls and salad bar. I took a leap of faith with the passionfruit ""gelato"" (It looks like the gelato melts and they just refreeze it). 

I was disappointed in the fried rice *sad face* and their sub sandwhich. The bread tasted rubbery and very dry while the fried rice was REALLY PLAIN. I felt like whoever prepared the fried rice did NOT know what they were doing. Now I understand why it was barely touched.

I've had better food and the same quality of food for way more money in Vegas buffets.  What this place supplies is reasonable food at a price point less than many of the other buffets around.  I went for their steak and crab Wednesday, $15,99 less a dollar discount for being a guest at the hotel.  The crab legs were spindly and the steak was a bit tough but cooked to the medium I asked for.  The swordfish wasn't bad and I noticed several folks with whole plates of crawfish.  Many of the folks seemed to be locals and although I had no wait at 5:00 by the time I was done the place was full and a long line had formed.  They do not rush the diners in the restaurant.  There were plenty of food choices.  I gave up after 4 plates, the last of which was desert.  Because of the number of people everything I tried was still hot or cold as needed.  The vanilla soft serve had given up so I had chocolate ice cream with my peach cobbler.  The service was really quick and I noticed those folks requiring bar service got their drinks quickly.  My one big complaint was my plates got cleared while I was getting another and my service, complete with whatever was on them, was set on the table rather than waiting for me to get back and transfer them to my new plate so I would get a separate plate to put them on on the first trip.

3684539,2018-03-31,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"Boy, was I surprised when I walked by and saw this completely remodeled buffet.  I've been staying at the Orleans for Vegas trips for the past 15 years.  I've had the old French Market Buffet more times than I can count and it has always been this drab depressing place with horrible food.  Well, all that has changed.  The Medley Buffet is all new and modernized!

I came for week day dinner and it was $18.99 with players club card.  They have extended the buffet line and there are so many more choices that look much more appetizing and inviting.  The food is overall much improved.  I really liked their smoked pork spare ribs, the braised oxtail, and the menudo.  The old New Orleans items are still there, so rest assured you can still get chicken and sausage gumbo as well as red beans and rice.  The gumbo seems less spicy than it used to be, but nothing a little Tabasco can't fix.  I also really liked the al pastor tacos with the meat actually being cut from the rotating spit.

They also serve crawfish, although when we went they were frozen crawfish from last season.  They were gigantic in size and tasted quite good for being frozen.  They were cooked well enough that you could still take the first ring off and pinch the tail to get the meat to come out all at once.  I hope as crawfish season picks up, they switch over to the live stuff.  It's happened in the past at French Market Buffet, so no reason it can't happen at the upgraded Medley Buffet.

Some items have not changed.  The hushpuppies and fried catfish are pretty dry.  The pizzas look anemic and greasy.  The desserts, while upgraded, are still stuff that's brought in instead of being made in-house.

The staff seem to have more of a spring in their steps and even the clientele seems upgraded.  No longer is this buffet just full of old locals eating for free after earning 200 points.  It felt like I was eating at M Resort.

With this new upgrade, Orleans leapfrogged many local buffets and even many strip buffets.  I'd say the order goes Bacchanal at Caesars, then Studio B at M Resort, then Medley Buffet in a tie with Feast Buffet at Red Rock, then Wynn, Bellagio, and the 3rd tier stuff at the Harrah's resorts.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,5,1,4,ScVbID4_jmvufJTn4AFawA

It has a ton of options for a very affordable price. Not to mention, it's all-you-can-eat!  

VARIETY:  The variety of food available is very diverse. Great for picky eaters, I guess, because of range of food is almost ridiculous! Dinner buffet was my fave; breakfast was a close second. 

Here's a general idea of the dinner spread:
-Fresh and cooked seafood: crab, shrimp, clams, crawfish, sushi, you name it.
-Chinese: stir fry station, noodles, spring rolls, etc.
-American: ribs, steak, etc.
-Mexican: burritos and such
-Several different pastas
-Soup
-Salad bar 
-Dessert bar with a gelato case!

SWEETS:  The desert bar/station will satisfy any sweeth tooth!  Diabetic and all!  I'm so happy to say that they have a whole sugar-free dessert section for all you health nuts and diabetics.  I like to eat and sample sugar-free desserts every now and then, and these desserts are scrumptious.

For me, the effort (grocery shopping, cleaning, prepping, chopping, stirring, frying, etc.) and time is not worth it - especially if it doesn't turn out well.  I'm so exhausted from my Graveyard Shift job, that sometimes I'll skip a meal because I'd rather sleep.  That's why I truly appreciate anything anyone cooks.  I understand the work that went into combining ingredients to create a meal.

With this in mind, I especially enjoy Senior Days at the Orleans Casino.  It used to be on Tuesdays, but now it is Wednesday.  After collecting 50 points on your B Connected Players Card, you earn a free breakfast or lunch buffet.  After 100 points, you get a free dinner buffet.  I believe I earned both a lunch and a dinner buffet!

I have been to pricier, higher quality buffets like the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan, but for the price (free), I can find good enough food at the French Market Buffet. 

For example - the dessert section... the fluffy cheesecake; and the strawberry torte.  I wish the torte's crust was on the lemon meringue pie!  I try to eat things that I don't normally make, such as the bread pudding, chocolate cream pie, and the gelato.  Those are pretty good.  Remember to get a plastic spoon from the dispenser!

The Italian section was okay - there was pizza, pasta, garlic bread, and lasagna.  Nothing really outstanding.  The pizza crust was on the thicker, softer side.

The BBQ area was interesting with its collard greens, yams, black eyed peas, hush puppies, ribs, and fried okra.  I had a well-done rib and enjoyed the crispy edges!  

The Asian foods were adequate: spring rolls, Hot & Sour Soup, Egg Drop Soup, crab sushi, and shrimp tempura sushi...  The noodles loooked spooky, so I just had one for good luck. Some dishes looked sad and overcooked, like they had been there a while... 

The salad bar looked fresh.  The fruits (cantaloupe, honeydew, and watermelon) were relatively sweet.  The peel and eat cocktail shrimp moves here at dinnertime so the crawfish can take its place at the Seafood station.  Dinner buffet includes Prime Rib at the carving station.  Breakfast buffet includes an omelette station.  

I skipped over the Mexican section because by that time, I was full.  I had a bite of macaroni and cheese for my niece, but it was bland.  

The service is quick and efficient.  The atmospere is energetic with many people moving here & there.  It's like a variety show!  The coffee refills are often.  Raspberry iced tea is available.

The long line to get in moves well.  There are many, many chairs and tables for singles and large groups.  It's just a basic buffet for everyone of all age groups to fill up.  The variety and value are noteworthy!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,6,6,3,DKBP6Big0qI-Vi6zUNXd6w

I stay at the Orleans a lot because of the gambling and because I get comped (although I'm not exactly a whale - more like a minnow). So I often eat here. This trip I discovered Anton's Secret to Buffeting: try having a meal more like you would in a regular restaurant, that is by courses, or by themes. Usually I sample a bit of everything to make sure I don't miss anything good, but really, this isn't the only time I'm ever going to eat here, so why not be a little more discriminating? 

For example, on this visit I had dinner here twice. The first night I did it strictly Mexican. It was not bad but not memorable - maybe the double tequila had something to do with that. On the second night, I had a full course meal: a seafood appetizer - shrimp and clams, a salad, and an entrée of sliced-to-order roast beef with vegetables (although I did sneak  in a yummy rib).

4014453,2018-03-06,2,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"Wow!  After the remodel of this buffet late last year, I give it a nudge to a 4 star rating!

Look, I realize these buffets in Vegas are par for the course...so I go with what the buffet is doing to improve themselves, to make it a better experience.  With the newly named Medley Buffet at The Orleans, they seem to have gone all-out with a total makeover!  The old buffet is unnoticeable - new walls, new stations, new decor, new seating, new carpet...new everything!  Their buffet was due for a nice change, and it seems to be all the better for visitors new & old to Vegas.  I think many would be pleased with its new looks!

I'm not really gonna complain about the food either!  No, it's not really competing with the likes of Bacchanal or Wynn or Cosmo when it comes to really high-end buffets...but it gives many of the local player buffets a run for their money!  We went on their most expensive meal night (Friday's Steak & Shrimp is $25.99 per person) and had many selections to eat:

-Prime Rib
-Al Pastor Tacos
-BBQ Beef Ribs
-Shrimp & Pork Shumai
-NY Steak
-Assorted Meat & Cheese Platter
-Kalbi Ribs
-Fish & Chips
-Crepes

Overall, mostly good!  Some of the items were on the overdone side, like the NY steak.  Some were not flavored the way I prefer, like the Kalbi ribs.  The BBQ beef ribs are tasty but they do tend to get stuck in your teeth & get very messy!  The crepes were not my favorite - batter is a bit too thick and more pancake like.  But I give them an A for effort on those.

The station selections were varied and there are more offerings than ever before.  Choices people, choices!  So while you may not like everything you try, there must be something you can agree with!

For me, the best selection they had that night was a HUGE pot of Oxtails they brought out!  We Asians know!  The minute I saw those glistening oxtails I knew I had something special.  Right after I got my large bowl (OK 3 large bowls), all my Asian peeps followed suit.  One little Chinese lady actually came to our table and asked exactly where those oxtails were on the service line!  Popular to say the least!

Great experience at the all-new Medley Buffet with my family!  Good eats with good company always makes for a good time!

Don't forget your FREE B Connected players card when you visit the buffet, discounts galore depending on your player level.

The French Market Buffet at the Orleans is a much better value than the others. On Friday's it is higher than other days, but being Catholic I appreciate that almost everything they serve at all the stations is seafood. 

For under $20 on Friday, I piled high plates with crab and shrimp. Had civeche, shrimp fajitas, fish, sushi, clam strips, oysters, a smorgasbord of seafood. Everything was delicious.

I would suggest making them medium-rare and then grill a little longer for those who want thoroughly cooked meat, I prefer medium, the Mister likes medium rare - unfortunately we don't get that option here, it's either well-done or well-done.

They only offer a few different rolls, but it is better quality sushi than you would expect.

The vegetable sides are really where this buffet stands out, in my opinion. Especially the roasted potatoes by the BBQ section, the Lyonnais potatoes in the Frenchy section, and the greens beans all the way down at the end in Italian/Asian.

It reminds me of back home in Texas. And I don't say that about much. The only thing lacking, which I would have expected to see in a New Orleans-themed place, was rolls of some kind.

It's $7.99 for lunch and it's quick, its food and whare more would you expect given those two things.  It doesn't compare to many of the strip buffets in terms of the quality of food, but I don't think it tries to.

I did see pizza, pasta, potatos, fried chicken, meatloaf, mac-n-cheese, a mexican spread of tortillas and taco shells with the fixin's, and salmon that was actually pretty tasty!  There are quite a few dessert options to go with the many food options and there is hard scoop ice cream and I am a sucker for hard scoop ice cream!  The soft serve machine stuff doesn't cut it.

4231048,2017-01-02,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"I really wanted to try a buffet while in Vegas. It was New Year's Eve, so we wanted to avoid the madness of the strip until that night. We were staying fairly close to the Orleans Casino and decided to give this place a try. Many buffets off-strip didn't seem to have great reviews, and this place seemed decent while remaining reasonable priced. I don't want to spend tons of money, as I can't eat enough to properly take advantage of a buffet.

We were quite happy with the offerings at this buffet. After paying, we were seated at a table and received excellent service for drink refills and bussing. I started with some BBQ, trying the pork links, biscuit and gravy, and jerk chicken. I also tried some french fries and fish filet from the seafood section. From an American food section, I had mac and cheese. From the Asian section, I had sweet and sour chicken, potstickers, egg rolls, and lo mein. I also had a salad from the salad bar and gelato, a mini pecan pie, and a mini piece of chocolate cake for dessert. There was another Asian-inspired section and a Mexican section as well, although I didn't try those.

I liked everything that I had, with the exception of the mac and cheese. It was dry and flavorless, although others in my group seemed to like it. The biscuit for the biscuit and gravy was extremely dry, but the gravy softened it, in addition to being tasty. The Asian foods were typical, Americanized offerings but had good flavor. Everything available looked appetizing, even if it wasn't my cup of tea. The salad bar was small, but I enjoyed the balsamic vinegarette and the topping options. The balsamic and oil and vinegar were the only dressing options that weren't a fattier, mayo-based option.

I wish I could have eaten more, but there was simply wasn't enough time for us to linger to have more helpings. If you're in the area and looking for a good buffet, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",N6zhXHPIrCXommDEg0Rw3g,1,0,4,hqQI83WTTRfc0DGynfSv8w

4241687,2012-11-04,1,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"Came to the Orleans Hotel with a roommate who scored free tickets to the Bill Maher show (He was hilarious)... decided on the buffet since the line wasn't long and none of the other restaurant options there seems interesting.

Being a native Las Vegan who was born here. I have not eaten at the Orleans Buffet since 1998 when I was 16.

That being said I was actually surprised by it.... the salad bar had nice crisp lettuce as well as all of the other options for your salad looking and tasting fresh and crisp as well. the salad plates were stone cold too which was a plus!

Of the options they had on the buffet line I didn't try any of the Mexican or Italian selections, I stuck mostly to the seafood area (They had a sign out that said due to unforeseen circumstances they would not have any craw fish, when I asked, the response was that they wouldn't have any for another week.) but the peel and eat shrimp were nice and plump and easy to get into and the Seafood Newburg and Cioppino were surprisingly good. 

The beef ribs were disappointing however as was the cut of prime rib. I also didn't like the Salisbury style steak that they had with a mushroom gravy, I went in at it with a fork thinking it'd cut right through it however the fork bounced back and almost took my eye out.

not much for seafood selection and as I said before the Mexican/Italian section didn't have anything that looked appetizing, the Mongolian section had SUSHI though which is kinda strange however the rice was pretty good and the fillings were decent for basic buffet sushi. 

TIP!: MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR B-CONNECT CARD BEFORE PAYING!! (The regular price of the buffet is 14.95 without that card however it drops down to 9.99 after you get the card. 1 B-CONNECT card is good for two people to enter and the 5-10 minutes you'll use getting it is worth saving 5 bucks per person.

4259874,2013-03-18,1,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"This was our plan B when plan A was a bust (we checked out the menu at the oyster bar and the cafe, but majority ruled)- the McMullen's irish bar across the street was jam-packed, and there was a radio station there too (should've known it would be a hot spot since St. Paddy's fell on a weekend this year). (We'd been here years ago, but I think that it was seafood night.)

Since I had the baby, my system has gotten a little sensitive to certain dishes so I went the safe route and stuck to a few choice items: shrimp scampi- didn't really taste like it was supposed to but eatable (didn't get seconds), chicken gumbo (good considering the averageness of the buffet as a whole), peel 'n eat shrimp- who can mess this up, right?, mussels- a tad overdone but eatable, green beans- surpsingly a crispness to it, and not soggy, prime rib- good, once you cut out all the fatty parts (and there was a lot of it). There were salads, mexican, seafood, carving stations, asian including a mongolian feature, and pasta. 

I still find that some people get a little crazy when it comes to food, and that there will always be an impatient person right next to you or someone who wants to create their own line when there is already a clearly defined line started. The majority of the diners were good, except there were a couple kids playing and when there is a big crowd, that type of horseplay is not appropriate period.

An average Las Vegas casino buffet is the best way I can put this place, not the worst, not the best, just right smack-dab in the middle. To tell you the truth, the desserts ARE better than the food selections- there were No-Sugar selections as well, in addition to the pies- pumpkin and pecan, cakes- red velvet cake, slice of rolls- lemon or raspberry, cookies, macaroons, plus ice cream and gellato- about 9 flavors like cookies 'n cream, coffee (delish!!!), watermelon sorbet. Just steer clear of items like cake slices that were the obvious leftovers. I made the mistake of grabbing a red velvet slice, against my better judgement, and had to take off the entire side because it had hardened a bit- eww.

There was a lot of refilling of dishes going on by the workers, which meant there were a bunch of customers here. It was a good crowd for a saturday night. It wasn't too noisy, since our baby got to nap a bit. I also noticed a Hand Sanitizer station in between food stations, which you don't see a lot in a typical Vegas buffet. The drink server was good except she kept missing asking one person in our party. 

FYI- get the card so you don't feel like you just wasted your money; it's a few dollars cheaper when you ""get connected."" $12.99 for saturday dinner.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,3,1,3,OndtTsWFUIfAx1IdxIMsFw

We happened to go for dinner on Saturday after seeing a movie. It was about  6pm, there was no line, and we paid about $30 (including tip) which is about the same as we'd pay at another restaurant. I usually stick to Chinese and Mexican with the addition of fruit and veggies, and this night was no different. Everything seemed pretty fresh,  except for some roasted potatoes. The fruit (mostly melons) was fresh and juicy. As always the desserts were good.I think the secret to buffets is as Anton mentions - eat in courses. That is definitely the way.  What you really must know about this buffet, and any of the non-strip buffets is that the food is not the best you'd find, but not bad at all. Don't expect the best Vegas chef's but you will get a meal here that rivals the restaurants in this and other local casinos. 
On this particular occasion our service sucked, but that really was the worst we'd ever had at the this buffet. Since we don't eat the buffets often, it probably won't be until we have family in town to go back, but they are always satisfied, and so are we.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,1,1,4,RTqtlKUe_IeAeiLQz8mPkg

They had asparagus and grilled zucchini. The taste was nice and sweet. 

They also serve southern food like grits , and Jambalaya. I tried the grits because I remember liking them so much when I ate some at Rosemary's restaurant but it wasn't quite the same. I did have fried scallops and mini crab cakes which were really good with a spritz of lemon. I also had chicken fried steak but it tasted plain to me because I usually eat it with a side of honey mustard. It's different ... but it tastes good! Unfortunately they had no honey mustard salad dressing. 

My second plate I thought I 'd try their chocolate waffles. If you like soft waffles don't eat these they had the consistency of toast. I also grabbed some scallop mixture they had cradled in a shell it's not as tasty as the ones at Asia buffet. I would pass these up.I also tried a cheese blintze but I could only take a bite the cheese inside was all crumbly. 

My dessert plate was my favorite because they had this almond crumb cake that had drizzled raspberry sauce in it. They used to serve this at Red Rock casino but I haven't seen it there in a while. It was so good with tea,. They also had Tiramisu cups which were really tasty the cake part wasn't too wet it was just right!

The food quality-having been to numerous AYCE buffets in Vegas has really improved since our visit years back. On this particular visit this past weekend, there were two standout dishes for me: the pesto tortellini, and the al pastor tacos! Pesto tortellini is one of my all time favorite Italian dishes, so to see it as one of the dishes in the Italian section was a big surprise, and it did not disappoint! The pasta was creamy, the cheese-stuffed tortellini was sooo delicious, and the pesto was not overwhelming, and tasted fresh! The al pastor tacos were such a pleasant surprise!! We are Southern California natives so everyone in my party was super excited, and they were DELICIOUS. The quality of meat was fantastic, and the salsa gave an amazing kick. We also saw the al pastor being cooked traditionally on the stick, and carved fresh-so amazing!

Lets just say I'm glad I didn't pay for this. 

On my first plate I tried their cheese enchilada (because how in the heck can you mess that up), rice and a few pieces of sushi. The sushi was inedible, falling apart, dry and fishy. The enchilada was over-cooked, falling apart and to say it was salty would be understating the salinity of this abomination. The rice, surprisingly crunchy.

I had literally one bite of everything and ditched the plate. I thought for sure our server was going to kick me out or something for throwing out an entire plate of food, but thankfully he didn't say anything.

Round 2: I tried the steak, a salad, some chow mein, and cheese ravioli with marinara. 

So I ended up eating the salad for dinner (the rest was inedible). 

Dessert was bland. Also, like every other casino in Vegas, they have those cute little desserts in the clear cups, and small tarts.... unlike other casinos, they put these tarts behind glass and you have to ask for the ones you want. So weird... you just know they're going to shame you if you ask to try 3 or 4 different tarts.

One guy reviewed the Aliante's buffet and said that if you wanted to know what the color beige tastes like you should eat there. EXACTLY! If you want to know what the color beige tastes like-- this is your jam. I would have been really upset had I actually paid the $43 for 2 buffets.

I haven't been to a buffet in ages -- at least not the last 3 times we've been to Vegas, but this time, I had a craving for peel and eat shrimp. I don't eat much else at a buffet, so I said let's go to the Orleans for their buffet since it's really cheap and I know they have peel and eat shrimp.

OK so the pricing was super cheap -- it's $7.49 for lunch -- and it includes non-alcoholic beverages. There were the usual bbq stuff, Mexican stuff, Chinese stuff, Italian stuff, and an attempt at Mongolian bbq, which was rather dismal. 

I had about a pound and of a half of shrimp, a few slivers of bacon, 3 corn on the cob, a swirl of vanilla ice cream with crushed peanuts, 3 glasses of iced tea and I was done. I remembered last time they had these fantastic cookies, but there wasn't a cookie in sight. On top of that they have added a gelato station, but all the desserts were handed out, you couldn't help yourself to them.

For me, this buffet suffices because I don't really eat much at a buffet. Usually, I'll eat peel and eat shrimp, smoked salmon or trout, and lamb chops if they have them. What's the point of paying 20 bucks when that's all I eat? 

The buffet at the Orleans is fine by me. It has the shrimp, and I'm happy to pay $7.50 for it! I must say I remember there to be more selections so I have to deduct a star for this visit. However, I didn't feel ripped off and I was content when I stood up to leave.

The downside to it being a buffet is that they have to cater to the masses, so definitely no extra garlicky or extra spicy options available. However, find a willing cook and give them a tip and I'm sure you can get it flavored how you'd like. 

Their crawfish looks like it was on steroids with how big they were and I had to stop after 3 huge piled high plates of just crawfish alone! My friends and I were THOSE people that would basically pile up a lot of crawfish on our plates to the point where other people behind is would give us the stink eye... excuse it, it's an AYCE, don't get your knickers in a twist, they will replenish it haha. I even had to give my friends the side eye and sh1t talking at the table because they emptied out the pan when they went before me haha.

Their barbecue station was amazing. The pork and beef ribs were fall of the bone tender. 

Their made to order crepes were decent. I mean, yes they don't have the crepe pan to ensure it's a thin crepe, but the filling of fresh pineapple and blueberries made up for it.  Here's a tip: Tip your cooks who do a made to order anything in a buffet. Even a $1 is better than nothing. They were down to the last 2 crepes and the cook serviced me first because he knew I tipped him over the other person who was plain rude and didn't give them anything. It's kind of an unspoken rule seeing as you know, they're serving you something fresh and not just something in a pan that's been sitting in their warmer in the back. 

Seeing as this trip was all about the crawfish, I didn't really try anything else. That'll be for the next visit. But definitely one of the better buffets in town that's off the strip.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,3,2,4,x7YJEOfdlhOQQBAjO-MU7Q

The quality of food hasn't changed much compared to before. Ya it's expanded a bit but the only huge change I saw was a crepe station and a pho station which I didn't care for. The only big change I saw was the dessert station which improved a lot with higher end desserts like creme brule. They always had a gelato station. 

My always favorite thing was to go there to eat the BBQ beef ribs which they still serve for dinner only. They also had prime rib but was very low quality of meat and tough. Who would've thought prime rib would be tough. 

The Chinese section was decent the lo mein was good. Now sushi no matter what buffet you go to in Vegas is a must void food. They make it ahead of time and refrigerate it and you can tell the rice isn't made right. Anyways any buffet you go to sushi and pizza are a must avoid period unless you like crap food.

I honestly would only go here if I wanted all you eat beef ribs and gelato. For cheaper price I'd rather go to palms buffet way better quality. Even tho less quantity.

So, let's say your family gambles at The Orleans so much that they get dining comps from them all the time, right? Since that describes my family to a T, lately, we've been going here about once per month thanks to comps that allow us to eat here for basically free. 

Is it the best buffet in town? Not quite, but it ranks pretty high up there among locals places at least. As a matter of fact, the Feast Buffets at the Stations are the only ones that give this joint a run for it's money. 

There are numerous Creole, Cajun and other southern-style touches scattered throughout. Most notable is the fact that it's probably the only buffet in town that serves crayfish. And eight times out of ten, gumbo is included as one of the daily soup options. Everything else is pretty standard fare, but most of it is done fairly well. The chicken wings in particular are always tender, well-seasoned and tend to fall right off the bone. 

One major gripe I have about this place is how certain things aren't seasoned up to par. The last time I came I tried to do some makeshift Hoppin' John with black eyed peas and smoked sausage and it just ended up tasting like a bland, soggy mess. Another one is that desserts tend to be pretty hit and miss. The ribs are also tough as nails but I've found that to be true of ribs at literally EVERY buffet so that's just a universal complaint right there.

They also have a ""Mongolian"" section which is probably the most useless section to have in a buffet ever. Other than that though, you do get your money's worth here. Especially if you're able to eat her for essentially free. *Wink Wink*

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Generous comp provided by The Orleans.
One of the better locals casino buffets.
Wide variety of cajun and creole delicacies available.
Diverse selection of seafood as well. 
Usually friendly service.
Probably one of the fastest moving lines for a buffet I've ever seen.

Cons:
Occasionally a little deficient in the seasoning department.
Sometimes great desserts, sometimes not. 
Decor in dire need of updating.

Huh?:
Why is there a Mongolian section? Like, for real?

Suggestions:
Replace that Mongolian section with either 1. A crepe making station or 2. A full-fledged Cajun/Creole/Soul Food section. Also, beignets in the dessert section! That way the theme comes full circle!

Return factor: 10/10. We're probably going to get another comp in the mail anyway.",h-nw7NECMw5qo1LEmpXxeQ,5,1,4,fCuu3uCjV9WcjpwTFun3FA

What was once one of the best values in LV considering the price and fairly unique southern food has changed to an ordinary buffet you can find in other casinos. The remodel was nice but the food got much worse although the price went up by $3+. I visited the buffet for breakfast and lunch (decided not to bother for dinner). The southern food has virtually disappeared and only a few of the dishes previously served from the French Market buffet are there. It also seems the executive chef has changed because the food tastes worse for a lot of the dishes. And the shrimp...my gosh, I told management 3x that the shrimp was old/bad/spoiled and 3x they kept changing the shrimp and it was still bad. I'm sure many people got sick that day. Also, they serve menudo for breakfast but not for lunch? If you're looking for a vestige from the French Market go elsewhere, you won't find it at Medley anymore. Sadly, I will pass on this buffet which is one of the reasons why I go to the Orleans in the first place as it was once one of my favorite buffets to go to.",BV_rvgi0rdkq5mlwyNFnZA,1,0,1,Ve9FlygUHFlrs2mVmJ0URw

I loved the Italian broccoli and the onion soup (minus the cheese and croutons). The Chinese section had well prepared baby bok choy that was not overcooked like at other buffets. What was especially nice was the chart defining the gluten free choices and the dessert section which included a selection of gluten free options.

No line, walked straight to the cashier, and in...that had to have been record time for a buffet line! Lunch was on my friend so I don't even know how much it came out to nor did I bother to read how much. Probably wasnt interested as I could forsee myself never coming back anyway.

There are buffets you may try and know...just know...once you have your plate in hand and start doing the slow zombie walk as your eyes wait for something from the warmers to jump out at you...and nothing doesn't. So you forcefully tell yourself, just get something. And I did...

Everything aside from salads because I swear you almost can't go wrong with salads unless the dressing is gross or the salads are wilted...and buffets never screw up on salads...regressing here, okay...everything I had was bland, boring, and dry. That was me trying a dish from every country they offered. I even had a simple rye grilled cheese sandwich or something like that...and THAT was bland, boring, and dry. What the?! Service was typical of a buffet one so no comment. As long as we got our drinks refilled without asking, good enough.

So before I make this long and repetitive, unless you get your food comped here, or you don't want to leave the casino...then by all means. However, if you are coming here from elsewhere looking to eat at a buffet, I won't say DONT...but uhh....you know there are a lot of good places to eat out here.

It is kid friendly (but if you don't want the smoke smell since you do have to go through the casino then not so kid friendly) and stroller friendly.

It's kind of annoying that they close the whole thing down between breakfast and lunch, but I'm not a huge buffet person, so this might be standard now. I think you need to be selective about what day/ meal you come here for, as some offerings are better than others. We came on a Friday and got here at 11, so we had to wait until noon for lunch.  They put bell peppers in everything and I'm allergic to them, so that limited what I could have. The barbeque brisket was a little tough, next time I'll try the ham.

This buffet is located inside the New Orleans casino. The price is a bit expensive (over $13) but if you sign up for a free B-connect membership, your meal admission is only $9.99! Need I repeat it? All You Can Eat Prime Rib for only $9.99!

I have to say the quality of the selections there is pretty good, considering how much you pay for your meal. I was pleasantly surprised at the Chinese section, since the stir-fried vegetables and eggplant dish was pretty delicious. Usually, in my experience, I usually avoid the Asian section when I go to buffets (except for sushi) since the food ends up tasting like Panda Express.

But other than that, I really did enjoy the dessert! They had ice cream flavors ranging from Vanilla, Coffee, Mango, and Peach. Also there were sorbet flavors such as Passion Fruit (My fav! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!), Lemon (another hit!), and Watermelon.

I definitely recommend this place, especially if you sign up for your B-connect membership before lining up at the buffet. It's worth it. You save AND you get to eat happily. :D",lDKbTlZqjIn2gn490gU2HQ,4,3,4,sW8bKX5yQdEzRA403K2VRA

I didn't just eat the crawfish. Their many stations offer you a variety of ethnic foods ranging from Italian to Asian and Mexican. Their meat items would be among the best. I favored their grilled sausages (wow, I thought about that sentence to try avoiding any 2nd meanings...). The majority of their food was mediocre at best, but they have some jewels.

The service is pretty efficient here. They come by every so often to check on your status and to refill your drinks. For the most part, they are very nice except for one or two of them. Many of them do have a good sense of humor and had a laugh with us when they came to look at all the plates. A lot of the other patrons came by to take pictures of us and give us some encouragement.

The environment was pretty spacious. It gives you a lot of room to move around without having to run into people on accident like some other buffets. It was a comfortable setting, just don't look around too much to see what other people do with their food. It can become pretty bizarre.

Overall, this is a good place to go to with family and friends. There is plenty of food selections, so you'll be able to find something you enjoy with very little ease. People are overall pretty friendly here, so you won't feel uncomfortable much. If you love crawfish, just come here for that because that alone made it worth the money for us, as you can probably tell from my introduction. I believe lunch was around $8 and dinner around $16. It is definitely worth a visit. 

I gave this restaurant 3 stars because I judge establishments on overall quality, not just on the amount of food that I can eat. If I did that, almost any restaurant would get 5 stars. They do have some excellent food, but overall, there are some bumps.

5616063,2009-09-24,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"Since I stayed at The Orleans last weekend, I thought I would give this place a try. This is definitely one of the better casino buffets I've eaten at in Vegas, if not the best (I have to admit, the only buffets I've tried on the strip were at Excalibur's which was pretty bad and The Stardust which was terrible, the worst buffet I've ever had anywhere, even though that's a moot point now since it's no longer there. I also tried the much-hyped Carnival Buffet at The Rio a few years ago and thought for the money it was a rip-off).

The surroundings were nicer than average for a buffet and they had a tremendous variety of food. They have a deal for $21.00 in which you can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. I only had lunch there once ($8.00), but because of the huge variety of items, I'm sure it would be no problem to eat all three meals there and never have a single item twice if you didn't want to. 

The quality of the food was above average for a buffet. There were a few things I tried I did not like, but there was more I liked than disliked. The beef back ribs, in fact, were by far the best I've had at any buffet and they had a braised oxtail stew which was very good, not as good as top quality homemade, but very good nevertheless, probably the single best item I've ever had at a buffet. The mashed potatoes, usually just fair or mediocre at most buffets, were also first rate.

The lines moved quickly and the service was good, although I couldn't understand why you couldn't just get your own water and napkins instead of having to get the attention of a server to do it for you. Also, there didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the order or location of the various food stations, i.e. the ribs were two or three stations from the American food station whereas it seems more logical they should have been next to each other. That's a minor thing, though.

In terms of overall value for what you get this place is an easy four stars, although I could not quite bring myself to give it five due to the items I did not care for and most of the stuff just being decent. If I ever go to The Orleans again, though, which is quite likely, I will definitely go to this place again.",6lyW_pEgWX6oInKWHU0M4A,0,0,4,G3cP3SddbK5N_DGF8neSFg

The selection is endless! You can have anything from prime rib to veal parmesan and yes...shrimp scampi. I was in the mood for mexican and they offered a taco station, enchilada's, chili releno, street corn and an entire fresh salsa bar with delicious chips. Plus so much more.
I did try the steamed crawfish because I have a weakness for shellfish. They were really good but wasn't in the mood for all that crack a'lacking and messiness.

After dinner we decided to try the desert area. Impressive Boyd Group!
So much to choose from..bread pudding, cobbler, carrot cake, pies, fresh baked cookies and my favorite ""The Ice Cream Parlor"" This is not an ice cream station its a full size ice cream store! Not some soft freeze ice cream that squirts out of a machine..but endless flavors where an employee scoops it out for you and puts on a cone or a dish. Its kind of hard to describe, you will just have to go see for yourself. I thought it was really cool.

For the price this buffet is worth it! I certainly couldn't eat more than what I had, but if I had a big stomach I would've tried more things!

The bacon was crisp, the mexican sausage was especially juicy and you can't go wrong with the biscuits and gravy. There was also an omellete bar. It's a steal at $8.99.",TQcycwYMygQ8SvgXvgW3oQ,0,0,4,VUsp0We5dtEh6OozyeHysw
5840744,2015-09-09,3,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,My father just stayed at the Orleans for the past week and we had breakfast here most mornings and dinner one evening. I would say the breakfast is the best value (8.99 with players card) but dinner was still pretty good. If it's a busy weekend prepare to wait in line especially in the morning but they do keep things moving along fairly quick. Drink service can be a bit slow to get to you but it was very busy the times I was there over the week and the servers had many tables.,BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig,3,2,4,iwRr7ajIUyf1aFXYfmmdag
5854466,2016-03-14,0,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"For the price you pay, this buffet is a good deal.  :)  It's $12 for lunch, or $1 off with a club card, and you get a nice variety of food.  The best section for me is the Cajun section with the smoked ribs and the beef ribs and the gumbo, its all pretty good.  I also actually thought their sushi was pretty descent for a buffet, I have ate sushi at probably about 50 buffets and I thought it actually tasted pretty good, it was a bit dry, but it was still fairly fresh and tasted like sushi, the problem I have with most buffet sushi is it just does not taste like Sushi, not even at Asian Buffet restaurants. 

The sweet and sour pork was surprisingly good, the sauce was separate which was nice so the food was not at all soggy.  :) The craw fish is very tasty and well-cooked, love craw fish those alone are 5stars, and they also have a chocolate fountain, for dinner at least (can't remember if it's there for lunch too)!

Overall, for the price, I think it's pretty damn good.  I have been to a lot of Vegas Buffets and I would rate this higher than many of the buffets on the strip that cost 5-10 dollars more.  The staff was friendly, the food was pretty fresh considering they were pretty dead, and I nothing was poor quality, even if not all the dishes are exceptional, they are at least decent.

5878494,2018-05-23,4,-LzUYsR54hd8cCiYXTquRA,"For $21 buffet, it's really not too shabby at all.  The variety of food and quality is worthy of another trip.  We came on Friday night, which was steak & shrimp night.  From what I could gather, there is no more seafood night.

There were so much shrimp dishes- butterflied shrimp, shrimp over ice, popcorn shrimp, deep fried shrimp, shrimp linguini, and a few more shrimp dishes in sauces and broth.  I'm starting to sound like Bubba Gump, so you get my drift.  The variety of soup like clam chowder, sweet & spicy, menudo and even pho were all represented with a few more that I can't quite remember. The pork ribs, beef ribs, the variety of meats on the carving board will satiate any carnivore eating habits. 

This is our first time and we were so impressed with the clean décor, excellent service that was provided throughout the floor.  

Stay for the gelato, the bite-size dessert and if you could believe it, their decaf Folgers coffee was pretty darn good.  To each's own, this place was a pleasant surprise for a buffet.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,6,4,4,nfSKe_sZ9t7T6BQHieeSIA

I had a little bit of everything but my favorite was they're carne asada and seafood enchiladas. Mixed with some salsa, guacamole and sour cream. Oh boy! 

Two salad bars, but who eats salad in Vegas? 

Very big selection of desserts! Not only ice cream and pies, but gelato! That really surprised me. 

Awesome place to eat if you're at The Orleans.",pmfwXDSQCT4nT3IUWXTYWw,0,0,4,M2gGFCfBwRDLcSWLWyPkBQ

Did not have to wait in line long only 17 mins., place was already full.
I especially enjoyed the German food. You could tell a lot of time and thought was put into these dishes at the Hofbrau station.
The Wait service met my every needs, I never had to ask for anything.
