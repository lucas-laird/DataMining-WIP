I had the club sandwich which was served with Chipotle Mayo(yum) as well as waffle fries sprinkled with chili and cocoa powder! The fries were great. I had the eighties chocolate shake with my meal. Soooo good!!! I can honestly say that that was the best shake I've ever had! After my meal I tried the chocolate popsicle fondue. Amazing.

Though widely known for their hand painted truffles, packed in decorative boxes and tins, and decadent hot chocolate, I discovered that Max Brenner dabbles into the savory side of life as well.  

It was after a few hours of exhausting shoe shopping in The Forum, that I needed to rest my feet, and found myself conveniently located right in front of the Max Brenner menu display. Though I could always go for a serving of their thick hot chocolate, it was the mushroom and ricotta pizza, which drew me in to have a seat.  Being alone, I opted for a comfy bar seat, which was a great idea, because the bartender was there to take care of me immediately, and check on my regularly throughout my time there.  I loved the flat rate pricing on the drink menu, $6 for cocktails and wine, and $4 for beers, regardless of brand.  That mushroom and ricotta pizza, along with a glass of sparkling wine, were my choices for the evening.  The pizza was a perfect-for-one-person sized flat bread, with mozzarella, chunks of ricotta, black olives, and sun dried tomatoes, with a drizzling of balsamic vinegar.  The smooth ricotta, combined with the chunky bite of the mushrooms, and the crispness the crust, offered a great combination of textures.  The sun dried tomatoes provided the perfect amount of saltiness.  Though this was the only food item that I ordered, I eye witnessed other bar-seated patrons ordering other things, and making positive comments about what they were indulging in.  Because of my surrounding observations, I may just have to come back and try a few more things.",9QrE24JaemD3TLFihmTKxg,0,0,4,1wExxdvE5NVAtse9285IUQ

The entrees could be a bit improved, but I can overlook that with it being a chocolate themed restaurant. I would always start my visit with an italian thick hot cocoa (milk chocolate), and then enjoy an entree followed by one of their amazing desserts. One thing that would have helped this place along is a third party taste tester to tell them the honest truth about their dishes (for example, the recent menu item braised pork burrito with mole sauce is just not good).",3X9SbVaryFtfanr-HCZtbg,0,0,4,CYX8GbHY6rVgTfsed1dUwQ

This place does not disappoint. The lime vinaigrette salad dressing on the side salad was amazing and the ""no guilt"" omelet was fantastic as well. This place isn't just for choco-holics! 

Also, our server was fantastic.

When we did go, there were barely any other customers there which seemed to be a good thing to us as we figured that we will be served in no time. WRONG. My friends and I sat there for 30 minutes, trying to flag down anyone that could possibly help us. NO ONE came. In the end, we went up to the bar and asked the bartender if he could take our order. He was very nice and said that he could but he was too scared to because the wait staff might get mad at him so instead he said that he will get someone to take care of us. He was very apologetic and seemed to want to help us especially after we explained to him what happened. He came back after 10 minutes (we waited at the bar) and said that someone would be serving us.

We went back to the table and went through the whole thing again: waiting, trying to catch someone's attention but alas, it all went for naught as no one came again to help us. After almost 40 minutes of waiting, my friends and I were tired and fed up. We decided to leave but not before informing the hostess about what happened hoping to get something akin to an apology. Instead, my friends and I were greeted with a very snobbish sorry and a ""have a nice day"". She didn't make any move to try and make it up to us or even offer a sincere act of apology.

Apparently, it doesn't matter to this restaurant whether people are in it or not. It is such a shame because the dessert is actually good.",crHZhw2KgT3KEGmyGY8N3w,0,0,2,xSNLkxGHnDFhf-DejagSnw

So here I am, reminiscing my trip to L.V..then all of a sudden my taste buds are savoring the chocolaty tastiness of Max Brenner. Which is the reason of me writing a review on it. I went with 3 other people, let's just say we're all very critical and precise when it comes to food.

The wait, was..okay the wait was friggin' forever. Prolly 40 minutes or so. HEY I'M NOT A PANSY, I WAS REALLY IMPATIENT AT THE MOMENT OKAY??! Anyways.. they finally called us over..me and my stupid self galloped over to the table gazing at the beautiful bald chocolate man's animated face..I..I mean the menu. 

Uhh just to confirm when you go there..make sure to order something involving CHOCOLATE. Oh god, most of the people that were surrounding us ordered sandwiches..I mean REALLY?! Sup with that?! We ordered the Classic European Chocolate Fondue, which is enough for two, but we've never tried it, nor know the portion size, so we decided to just order one. I'm not going to create a huge hype for the fondue, since they only served huge sticky mouth watering marshmellows, fresh strawberries and bananas..with thick, sweet, sugary, plentiful white chocolate, milk/dark chocolate..sounds aight? Well it SURE AS HELL WAS! The whole setting was enjoying for us, definitely comin' back for some fondue swag. For the drinks, we ordered a couple o' Mexican Spicy Hot chocolates, and Melting Marshmellow Hot Chocolates. Overall, they were okay. Sweet, and chocolaty, basically. 

When it comes to the way the place looks, it is pretty relaxing. Nice lighting, ambiance, waiters, smell..oh the smell. Honestly, you will have a nice time, even if the food wouldn't be as good as you thought. Even the bathrooms are stunning. Wow, I'm such a loser.

Max Brenner, a highly anticipated opening for this Chocolate shop/ restaurant inside the Forum Shops, in addition to it's other locations around the world and statewide. After looking through the mouthwatering menu, I decided to go for the chocolate pizza, which comprised of melted milk chocolate, a choice of banana topping, among others, and minced hazelnuts. This was a disappointment, as the tough and thick crust did not complement the smooth milk chocolate topping. Fortunately my disappointing was regarded by, who I assumed to be Mr. Brenner himself, and granted me another menu choice. I chose, another disappointment, the ""Max Wich"", which was an unoriginal chocolate ice cream filling in between a dense and overly chewy cookie and a bottom- stale textured, hard to bite, cookie, I should have asked for recommendations before ordering, but for now, all I can say is not worth the prices.",tSX--AWjl3cB_-ODyfFu9w,0,0,3,Efy5EM7wIfUZsE8bO8lHrw
129770,2014-01-07,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"I like their dark hot chocolate! But just the dark hot chocolate. The rest of items that we tried were just ok. The rest were chicken wings (I forgot the name but it wasn't the one with nuts on it), a shake and the popsicle fondue. I think the chicken wings got honey on top of it so it's sweet......which was not good. I have sweet tooth but I want my savory food not sweet. So it was a bummer. I think the shake is called the 80's shake. It has dark chocolate (menu said milk choco but I asked them to change it to dark), vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell. I though everything is blended in the shake but when it came, it's actually a dark chocolate shake or granita, with a scoop of ice-cream on top, and the chocolate shell is on the ice-cream. So the execution was a bit not what we expected, and not appealing to us. Lastly, the popsicle fondue was way way way too sweet. The popsicle is made of vanilla ice-cream, which is sweet already. Then chocolate for dipping is milk chocolate which was way way way too sweet and passed the point of being yummy....I meant the dip wasn't yummy at all. And there was ground pistachio nuts and wafer balls for dipping to make it even more sweet. Don't get me wrong, I like sweet but only to its optimum level. I think it's a disaster when they make things above the optimum point. 

My husband got freaked out by the sweet chicken wings and doesn't want to try other savory items there again. I think we will go back only for the dark hot chocolate. Why? It's not too sweet, but has the real chocolate flavor, and not too bitter or sour. Some dark chocolate is very bitter and sour, but not the case for their hot dark chocolate. I like chocolate not because of its sweetness, but its distinctive aroma. When you make chocolate too sweet, that aroma will be masked and all you are tasting is just sugar, not chocolate.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,3,ucNrQBI6iNJYBNQOfRigng

141723,2010-12-30,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"If you love desserts, then this is definitely the place for you. Real food...uh not so great, but desserts. Wow. Delicious! But first, real food, right? We ordered tomato pizza, some kind of pulled pork sliders, and philly cheesesteak sliders. The sliders were tasty, but the pulled pork slider was especially tasty. Our server said it was his favorite and he was definitely correct. The cheesesteak was just okay in comparison, but still good. The pizza was not good, at all. We had to send it back because it was soggy. The cheese tasted like rubber, the dough was wet, and we couldn't even pick it up with our hands, or even a fork and knife! Instead of the pizza, we ordered some other kind of slider with ham, turkey, and maple syrup. It was actually quite good. 

Now the desserts and other sweet things! The eighties milk shake was A-mazing. The icy chocolate drink part and the scoop of vanilla ice cream were perfect together. The chocolate shell on top was a tasty touch. We loved the glass it was served in so much that we went over to their store and bought not only chocolate, but also mugs, and glasses! Their Italian hot chocolate was decadent. It's a little thicker than normal hot chocolate, and definitely a hundred times better!  For dessert we had the sharing for two and the milk chocolate apple caramel crisp. The milk chocolate apple wasn't my favorite combination. It was just okay. I wouldn't order it again. The sampler was delicious. It came with a banana split waffle, chocolate cake, chocolate egg roll, chocolate crispy bar things, chocolate crispy balls, chocolate sauce, fruit and marshmallows, and a chocolate fondue. If I could, I would eat the waffle for breakfast! It was yummy! The chocolate cake was just okay. The egg roll was my least favorite. It was also the only thing left on the place when we left. The chocolate bars were probably my favorite thing there. Imagine a kit kat but waaayyy better. The crispy ball things tasted like chocolate covered cheerios, not my favorite thing on the plate. The chocolate fondue was yummy! We could roast the marshmallows then dip it in the chocolate, but I ended up just eating the chocolate with a spoon! It was delicious!

Overall, I think you should just skip the main meal part, and just go straight to dessert. Why order real food at a chocolate place? The sampler was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it if you want to try several desserts, but I think it serves way more that two; maybe three people? The eighties milk shake is a must.

161551,2012-10-19,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Everyone seems to think they know it all when it comes to their favorite burger in town, myself included, and this problem doubles when that place also happens to be where they work. People have a certain pride in their workplace if they love it there, and will defend it to the death. I had a friend who worked at Max Brenner in the Forum Shops who always swore they had one of the best burgers she's ever eaten, which I would normally accept if this place wasn't known mostly for their chocolate. How can a dessert place actually have a decent enough burger for her to recommend to me?

I've said it before and I'll say it again, I hate going to Caesar's. This becomes even worse when I'm risking a burger meal at a place I have no confidence in. Brenner is located deep in the mall across from the old FAO Schwartz location which is now a completely loud and obnoxious multi-story H&M store. I know this well because I chose to sit in their outdoor 'patio' directly across from this insanity to people watch and take in the scenery. What I didn't think about when I made this request was the ridiculous music coming out of H&M, and is definitely something to think about if you come dine here. Your other option is to sit inside their restaurant which is fairly small and nice, but has the amazing smell of chocolate. The menu is very heavy on the dessert-influenced dishes from shakes to sweet breakfasts, but also has a variety of regular items including pizza, pastas, salads and sandwiches. Quite extensive actually, and I really want to come back to try some of the dessert items as I didn't have any room after my burger.

The Brenner Burger comes with Max's secret barbecue sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar and a Vidalia onion ring on top, with waffle fries dusted with chili and cocoa powder. It has a great buttery bun; a bit strong at first but quickly got lost in the flavors. The meat had good flavor, it was cooked almost too rare but was still good, although the overall temperature was very low. So low in fact, that my cheddar was barely melted. Isn't that one of the easier cheeses to melt? The onion rings were a bit undercooked as they were hard to bite through, and I ended up pulling them out of their fried ring sadly. I recently told someone that a perfectly cooked ring is easy to bite through leaving the rest intact; this wasn't the case. The barbecue sauce was sweet and good, but there was almost not enough of it as I felt myself longing for that bit of flavor occasionally. 

The waffle fries were good, but they only give you like five of them in a tiny glass. The cocoa and chili powder are a great concept as a seasoning, but they were hardly noticeable. The aioli on the side was good; it was very sweet and I found myself using it for my burger and fries. The two pickle wedges were ok, but I couldn't finish both after eating the large burger.

Overall this could have been a really good burger, but the cold temperature really took away from it. The $14.25 price tag is a bit steep, but I guess I need to take into consideration where I was sitting. Once you do that, it's about on par with some of the other Forum locations I've been to, but possibly not as good. The service was spotty too; my waitress was extremely friendly, but bused a table behind me for 5 minutes after taking drink order and disappeared for at least another 5+ minutes after taking my plate before bringing my check. I will point out that they were pretty quiet too. My friend was right to recommend this burger to me; it's really quite good, but I think it has some competition within the building.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,3,HqKMNAVUBKMWJ2JRmRdAzg
165399,2010-11-14,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Went here for my cousins 21st birthday, it was difficult to find but once you saw the bald head of Max Brenner, you knew you were at the right place. I didn't expect them to have so much selection for a notorious chocolate place when I read the menu.

They actually have two, one that is more formal, with a simple list of salads, pastas, burgers/sandwiches, sides and appetizers. Pretty normal for a restaurant. The one that caught my eye was the Kobe Beef Burger, I decided to go with it since it costs about an extra $2.

When I got the burger, I was impressed with the display. It's not your average plate, you get served with a wooden style pallet with this 8+ inch steel rod in the middle of the burger. It was quite huge and definitely did not make me feel bad for spending $16 on a burger. The sides were a waffle style french fries and came with a unique sauce on the side, which I put on the burger and fries. 

I was also impressed with their style of bowls/cups, when my seatmates ordered their pasta, it was something I've never seen at a restaurant before. It reminded me of the seat Will Smith sat in for his interview in Men In Black. I wanted one. In fact, when I have my own place, it is a goal of mine to have these obnoxious bowls that wouldn't be good for cereals or soup, but great for pastas and stir fry!

When I bit into the burger, I was one happy camper. The thing was huge and I decided to use a fork and knife just so I don't ruin it. I felt like, it was not your average burger, might as well eat it like it wasn't a normal burger.

The atmosphere was alright, for a large group that we had (about 11 people), it was pretty decent. Kind of hard for the booth side, in case someone needed to hit up the restroom (which is located upstairs). Also, the music was played very loud, kind of like a club but it wasn't club music.. It was like, lounge or jazz... At one point they played a beat where I felt like I was in a jungle or something! Our server was nice, she had to handle a lot with a big group. I am sure I would have gotten a better experience with that if it was maybe 4-5 at most. Then again, you know what your expecting with a big group. Whats your order? Next.

Sadly, I didn't get a chance to have dessert as my buddies wanted to go back to the hotel and party. And I don't know if chocolate and alcohol would mix well, I mean.. It really depends what your drinking. I KNOW... Dessert is why you go there but again, the Kobe burger got to me and I my hunger was definitely satisfied. I'm also trying to watch my diet... So the burger was more than enough. Originally, I was going to go for the turkey burger/sandwich but I said, ""what the hell, I'm already here and... I've never had a Kobe beef burger... Might as well go big or go home!""

Anyways, I would go here again. Definitely for a big date night, special occasion or if I was in the area and decided to spend at least $20-30 on myself for lunch/dinner.",XyDLSwfbkySPxLFoszyvpA,0,0,4,463r0OR-GU9kWeCt0zck1w

I suggest eating a lighter meal and indulging yourself with an extra dessert.  I have been to the MB in New York as well.  The Vegas location lacks some of the impact of the NY one when it comes to the chocolate smell.  The large opening connecting the restaurant to the Forum Shops probably has something to do with it.

I got a panini and everyone else tried it and liked it, but I really couldn't taste anything. The pizza has ridiculously thin crust. The pasta is overly portioned. The waffle fries are dusted with chili and cocoa powder, but you can't taste the cocoa powder at all. Plus, it's a little expensive, I say you get less than what you pay for. For dessert, however, that's a different story. We got two crepes: hazelnut and white chocolate cheesecake. Both were AMAZING. I can't tell which I like more. The shakes come in the cutest cups I've ever seen (based on Alice in Wonderland- they say DRINK ME). So, overall, I'd say just go here for dessert. It IS a chocolate place.

We had the Brenner burgers and the buffalo chicken sliders, both tasty and arriving with a couple awesome waffle fries. Also got the potato skins which were pretty decent.

Chocolate pizza. Delicious. I was skeptical at first but never again.

292106,2011-04-09,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"This is one of the highlights of our Vegas trip. I am not a huge chocolate fan but Max Brenner made me experience what most chocolate aficionados must be experiencing when they eat chocolate!

I read from a magazine that they opened a location late last year in Vegas (Caesar's The Forum Shops, right across the 3-story H&M store). And considering they only have three-- now four-- Max Brenner Restaurants in the US. (None in California, Why?!?!) I thought this was a MUST DO on our Vegas itinerary. And boy, was I right. :)

Our server, Brenda, was very delightful. She introduced us to the whole 'Max Brenner Chocolate' experience. She was also very knowledgeable, if you can't make up your mind. Just ask her. Going to Max Brenner's is like going to a Candy Store. It's hard to pick which candy (or in this case, chocolate) to get.

In the end, we decided to do a 'taste test' and ordered the ""sharing for two"" dish (split up between 3 people, lol.) We also got an order of Sugar Crystal Churros and we didn't get to finish it. We were soooo full. Everything was so good! 

They also had a huge selection of shakes and even their food presentation, their cups, mugs, etc. They were so whimsical. It really feels like a chocolate factory. Btw, you can purchase those mugs in the gift shop AND they also have free samples in there. So dig in! :)

If you are looking for the best chocolate martini... order Satisfaction Guaranteed! The name speaks for itself. Seriously. I never had appreciation for chocolate until now.

302821,2011-01-10,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"You will never encounter better chocolate. It's as simple as that.

I made reservations for two for January 8th, 2011 at 3pm, which is Brunch. I made these reservations as a Christmas gift to my mother who is the ULTIMATE chocolate aficionado. We arrived at 2:30 without even having realized we were a half an hour early, and they still instantly seated us. 

I researched this restaurant quite a bit before deciding to go there, even though I have friends in New York who rave about this place. I was worried about it being really cramped, loud, busy, and too upscale or snobby for my taste. It definitely wasn't. Every single employee was abundantly friendly and helpful. The setup in the restaurant was very adorable and decently spaced. My only complaints would be that the table we sat at was a bit tiny and wobbly, as well as the chair wasn't all that comfortable. Our waiter was a younger man who was very witty and helpful and didn't complain when we gave asked him ""which is better?"" about several dishes. 

For starters, my mother and I both ended up ordering the Eighties Milkshake ($8) as our primary beverage and were also brought glasses of ice water. It's served in a tall freezing porcelain glass with a steel straw, which is brilliant. The Eighties Milkshake is a combination of milk chocolate ganache and  vanilla bourbon ice cream which is topped with a chocolate 'shell'. This milkshake is HEAVEN. You immediately taste the bourbon in the icecream and how creamy and delectable it is. If you take a drink and bite off a piece of the shell, you enter an alternate universe of tastyness. No milkshake tops how simple but amazing this one is. I can't wait to go back and have another one.

For brunch I ordered the B.A.L.T. ($14) which is a Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato sandwich with avocado slices and a cilantro-avocado mayonnaise. I ordered it with pepper jack cheese (+$1). This sandwich was to die for. It's served on white bread with the crusts cut off and is skewered. It is mindblowing. The bacon was perfectly cooked, the sandwich was perfectly put together, and it tasted fabulous. I was worried that because it's a somewhat fancy restaurant that the portions would be small and that I wouldn't get enough bang for my buck, but I was wrong. There's two skewered stacks of the sandwich (one on each side of the dish), with two pickle spears in the center, and a small bowl of about 5 waffle fries with the dipping sauce. The waffle fries are incredible, though I wish there were more. They're perfectly crispy and dusted with cocoa powder and chili powder to give a very mild accent and a very mild kick. The dipping sauce is sensational and definitely has a punch to it. It tastes like a horseradish-tangy-southwestern sauce with a bit of chili powder on top. It compliments the waffle fries very well.

My mother ordered the Grilled Chicken Panini ($14) and it was exquisite. The Grilled Chicken Panini is a panini with grilled chicken, olive pesto, tomato, spinach, and goat cheese. The chicken was cooked beautifully, the bread was exceptional, the olive pesto gave the panini the perfect amount of saltiness and earthyness, the spinach and the tomato were excellent additions, and the goat cheese completely brought it all together. 

For our much awaited dessert, we ordered the ""Sharing For Two"" ($25) off the Sweet Icons dessert menu. This dish comes with a few squares of chocolate sponge cake which are melt-in-your-mouth perfect, a crispy chocolate eggroll that is stuffed with fudge and bananas and drizzled with caramel, and two bars of ""bark"" (milk chocolate and white chocolate) which are a crunchy bar made of what I'm guessing is rice krispy and chocolate. The dish also features 1/4th of a waffle topped with icecream, carmelized bananas, and rice krispy crumble. Last but not least, the Sharing comes with a fondue set; complete with a fire grill, candle-warmed liquid chocolate fondue of your choice (milk, dark, or white), and a bowl of bananas, marshmallows, and strawberries. Oh and did I mention that your entire dish is garnished with the perfect amount of powdered sugar? You can't go wrong with this dessert. It's everything that a dessert should be. 

Max Brenner's has instantly become one of my favourite places to dine and I will surely be going back time and time again.",bQKz18TPCxvi_UJmFwdgjA,0,0,5,Gu33PWBfqHJAaiTNMEGIIw
305441,2013-12-30,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"While living in LV for the summer, my husband and I went to MB about every week (in 2011) - yeah, we LOVE it! 
We loved everything we had tried there, especially the desserts, shakes and hot chocolates. We loved the sexiness and the style of the restaurant.
After that, we went back about every 4 months and still loved it.

Last December (2012) however, we went back again and noticed that they had changed a couple of things. Change is oftentimes a good thing, but not in this case! We were pretty disappointed to see that the presentation was not as sexy as it had always been, and they had changed some of the plates to more boring ones.
What is even more disappointing was that they had reduced the amount of food/sauces in f.e. the euphoria sundae (our favorite!) while making it more expensive.
We asked the waiter about it, and he said that they reduced the amount because ""people didn't like that it was so big"" ?!?!?

Yeah, it's big and it's definitely for two people, but you can't just reduce the amount of stuff in the sundae but still raise the prices by $2-3. I understand that they have to raise the prices every other year to keep up with inflation and stuff, but reducing the amount of food??! Very unprofessional, and very disappointing for regular customers like us.

If you're in Vegas and you've never been to MB, you should definitely get some hot chocolate there. Their normal food is ok (nothing special), but everything with their chocolate is amazing!",7fsPskiSUeZtH__CjcFi8A,0,0,3,fNB448FiWG7PAwTrGdAbgg

Finally, the original waitress comes back and says ""oh, I was on a break, let me see what happened"".

430293,2011-01-15,4,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"On any other day, breakfast in LV, for us, usually involves me heading down to the hotel lobby Starbucks; sporting bed-head hair, surf shorts & a oh-so-classy pair of Local Motion slippers. But on this special-occasion (Mrs. Art G's b-day), we decide to take it to the max, & have brunch at Max Brenner (sans slippers).

The restaurant itself is an amazing chocoholic's dream à la Willy Wonk... (Oops, I almost said the ""W"" word - prolly a big no-no here). Our server was super nice & answered our questions about items on the menu.

Black & Tan Beer Battered Vidalia Onion Rings - large & bready, I could really taste the beer in the batter, not awesome, but just good. This came with a chocolate-ranch dipping sauce, which I didn't really care for (plain ranch would have been fine).

Waffle Fries - dusted with chili & cocoa powder, though I didn't really taste much of it. They were hot, crispy & had enough salt to make them very tasty. This came with a light, tangy dipping sauce, that went well(er) with the 'rings too.

(me) Huevos Rancheros Sunrise Burrito $13.75 - light, fluffy scrambled eggs, spicy-hot chorizo, tomato & pepper jack cheese. Giant sized, wrapped in a festive bright-red tortilla & served with salsa, sour cream & a side of homestyle fries. This was really good, really spicy & filling.

(b-day girl) Guilt Free Omelet $13.75 - mushrooms, spinach, onions, peppers, tomato & Swiss cheese. Served with a sugar dusted buttermilk biscuit, home fries, sour cream & chocolate sauce on the side. Though I didn't sample this dish, b-day girl liked it. ""Mmm, that's good"" (that's what she said).

Chocolate Chai $4.50 - served do-it-yourself style, set it on your glass & it pours the Chai spiced Hot White Chocolate Truffle right in. This was so good, both the Chocolate & Chai flavors were really intense.

Mocha Frappé $7.50 - Milk Chocolate Truffle & Espresso Shot served in a very cool ceramic ""Alice In Wonderland"" inspired cup with a stainless steel straw. This is, the best & most chocolatey tasting frappé I have ever had, chocolate-bar none!

The Kids Menu reads like a children's storybook. The first chapter all about sweets. A little strange, with names like ""Chocolate Burger"" & ""Chocolate Pizza"", but it turns out - they're made entirely of sweets, not some bizarre concoctions inspired by pregnant cravings. Chapter 2 offers more traditional food, with fun & interesting names like ""The Bowl Scribble Little Mouth Cheeseburgers with flying saucer french fries & ketchup paint"" $8.50. My son really enjoyed these 2 skewered sliders & waffle fries, but opted not to have the ""paint."" He was a little weirded-out by the names, I guess. It's served with a fun little brush to paint on the ketchup.

We browsed the 50+ items on the dessert menu throughout our meal, but sadly, were way too full to try any of them afterward. Why did I wait 'til the last day of our trip, to come here? I was at a loss, like going to 31-Flavors & only having enough time to try the plain vanilla, loss. Next time for sure.

Overall, I thought the food & service was good. A little pricey (it's The Forum Shops - wha'd ya expect?), but the amazing Chocolate here, is well worth the visit.",tscXXfHPtcYNMNmi6GGQVw,3,4,4,CtGSWX9k--emdpBxdc8m-A

I came here with friends who had been before and loved it, and while I completely trust their recommendations, I wasn't sure if I would be as head over heels for this place as they were because 1. I wasn't sure I was sold on eating chocolate so early in the day (I know, I know, as I write this it sounds crazy - any time is chocolate time, right??) and 2. they were all about the desserts, which, with me being gluten free, wasn't as big an attraction. But I needn't have worried. The strictly brunch part of the meal alone impressed me enough for a return visit, and that was even before the sugar coma. I had the Mexican omelette with cheese and black beans wrapped around avocado and topped with salsa. Perfectly done, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Also I love that I had the option of fruit as a side dish - most places would charge an extra $5 for that. It was a fairly generous portion of fruit, too, and best of all came with chocolate dipping sauce. All of the sudden it didn't seem too early for chocolate.

For ""dessert"", I had the do-it-yourself hot chocolate which is steamed milk served in a mug that is set atop a tea light candle with the chocolate chips on the side. The candle kept the milk hot so you just add in the chocolate, stir, and voila! Even more decadent, I tried a sip of my friend's Italian drinking chocolate, which we described as almost like drinking ganache. Unbelievably rich and awesome. 

Fun times, good food and chocolate. All situated in a giant mall in which  to shop off those calories afterward. Now I get it.",sTaq8WK7In539EGyjOhXwg,0,1,4,3HX_8noTGh7Ws-AYNjPc9w

It was such a large portion my husband and I could have shared it.  When it came out the top had a nice crust of crispy parmesan cheese on it.  It came with a side of delicious marinara sauce.  It was a little skillet of cheesy heaven.

Somehow we made room for a Chocolate Hazelnut shake in one of their signature Alice glasses.  It was good but we didn't really find the hazelnut flavor until we got the bottom of the shake.

The reason for the 4 star review instead of 5 stars really hinged on our server.  There were many times that our glasses were empty and he was too busy talking to another server to notice.  He actually walked to the table next to us and walked away without noticing that we had empty glasses.  We tried getting his attention unsuccessfully but thankfully another server noticed and brought us refills.

What better way to be in Vegas then go shopping at a three story H&M and then go across the way to having chocolate to your hearts content?!?! (No better way) My husband and our friend decided that they would get drinks well they waited for the girls to finish up their shopping, so they decided on Max Brenners. They got some pretty good drinks, but of course us girls came along and we got a way better deal out of it all. All I have to say is that the GM came out saw that I was carrying chocolates from another company and it set off an event of things to come. He made us everything thing from homemade chocolate covered bacon, we got free chocolate martinis, and many more things. My good friend is vegan and couldn't have a lot of things that they were giving us, so the bartender/ barista went out of the way to figure out something that she could have. When we got our bill and they only charged us for 2 drinks. It was amazing !!! 

I've never experienced anything like it and the customer service was just through the roof. Everyone was so nice and friendly to us. We actually went back for brunch the next day, just because the food looked so amazing and it truly was. We had a few different kinds of sandwiches (even a waffle sandwich), the corn cakes, and some different kinds if mochas. The food is actually really really rich, so I suggest splitting it with someone, or taking some back with you. The mochas are really good and the chocolate they use is of such great quality. They come in these really cool cups that are suppose to warm and make the chocolate taste better or something like that. (Honestly I can't remember it was definitely a funky cup though.) The chocolate martinis are really good too (they are also nice and strong), they put this skewer of marshmallows in it and top it all off with more chocolate of course. 

All I have to say is that if you really like good food and LOVE chocolate then this is the place to be in Vegas. The service is awesome and Max truly could have not done a better job of making such a great restaurant.

Back in the late 80s, nike ran a campaign featuring Bo Jackson. 

It proclaimed ""Bo Knows"" and went on to enumerate all the things Bo knew, including but not limited to football, baseball, and Ray Charles. 

Max Brenner knows chocolate.

I can't count the number of times I've been here. 

Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, Snack-time, Cookie-stop while shopping at the forum shops.... 

You really must try the chocolate fondue ""sharing"" @  $24.95 for two at least once. 

And buy yourself a $5 cookie to go. It's $10 if you eat it inside because it comes on a plate with a dollop of cream, some berries and chocolate sauce. 

Another thing: sometimes the service is uneven. It's not a fine dining restaurant, so it comes with the turf. Spend some time reading the menu and the whole Max Brenner story. It will make you want to quit your job selling widgets and apprentice in a tiny Parisian chocolate shop with a crotchety Gitane-chain smoking chocolatier named Gaston. 

They don't really open early enough, or close late enough, and lately, they got rid of the little mini-stand outside the restaurant to make room for more fake-patio seats, but those are my only beefs, and they are fairly trivial and easily planned around. 

Even the non-sweets are good.

The omelets are solid, the potatoes are well-seasoned, and everything is certainly quite edible.

But stick to the sweets, like chocolate pancakes for breakfast, the aforementioned fondue sharing, and the cookies and cakes and you will be very pleased. There's this hot chocolate here that you need to try. Ask for a sample of each kind before you order to get a taste of each variety, and you will know which one I am talking about. 

Don't come here if you dislike sweets, and write a review complaining about how sweet everything is. That's just asinine. 

The whole point of eating here is to assemble a meal like Will Ferrell makes in Elf, and spend the rest of the day bouncing off the walls on a crazy sugar high.",VxUuMNnCqgA8zK4F0TYHMg,1,0,5,FQDtBT_Ku1Quin86EeURog

The atmosphere is very chocolately - like you're inside of a dark chocolate bar. The menu is fun and whimsical, and there's a nice intro from Max Brenner that tells a little about his story. More chefs should do this at restaurants - its nice to know a little about the minds behind the madness. 

Although everything is literally dripping in chocolate on the menu, we were in much more of a brunch mood and settled for the BLAT (Bacon Lettuce Avocado Tomato) sandwich, the spicy chicken burger and the Brenner Burger..DELICIOUSNESS all the way around! 

Let me warn you - the portions are somewhat huge and if you are in a sharing mode, I suggest ordering an appetizer each and an entree to share. 

We couldn't make it to dessert - tummies were full. But we did have the Oreo milkshake in a really neat Alice mug. Sucker for all things Alice in Wonderland, it was a special treat to drink the shake out of a cup that demands you to Drink Me! 

Looking forward to revisiting again for dessert on a date night. There are so many options to chose from but I am particularly interested in the chocolate fondue. 

I should note that we used a Groupon for this - and if you ever see a Groupon or Living Social deal for Max Brenner - buy it!!!! Use it! Or give it to me - I love this place!",uU5xH0JEqlhOxJ9srnbOVg,1,1,5,J32BDr1x3YfTU0OxVNsOkQ

Service was great, despite other yelp reviews, maybe because it wasn't that crowded. Come for happy hour  (3pm-6pm) for 6 dollar drinks and appetizers. Corn croquettes were excellent, sliders were very good and mini sloppy Max (pulled pork) were good. Not as memorable were the intoxi-cake martini, the banana fondue (fondue sauces were great but hot mushy bananas, not so much), and cocoa and chili dusted fries (they were pretty average but could not taste the cocoa).

The waitress did comp one of the burgers when my friend complained, but I can't imagine she would have comped them all, so I stayed silent.

So, would you want to?

Max Brenner will damn-right get you wasted, that is, chocolate wasted ;D

Such ah delightful chocolate aroma that touches your tongue as if you can already taste the sweetness and flavor of Max Brenner's signature milk chocolate once you step into the restaurant...

You must compliment the smell of the place with a cup of hot chocolate:
_Milk Chocolate - cocoa origin [Venezuela] My 1st choice
_White Chocolate- cocoa origin [Trinidad] My 2nd Choice

Then get your appetite on: [share please]
_Creamy spinach & artichoke fondue
_Deep bleu Cobb salad
[Silders] Only on Weekdays (boooo)
_Mini burger, BBQ pulled pork, Philly steak, etc (best food to order then what's on the menu to tell you the truth) 

Not yet full until you get your grub on: [going solo]
_The best B.A.L.T (I agree, dripping with a guacamole spread)
_Grilled chicken panini (must love goat cheese)
_Chubby smoked turkey club (simply a turkey cold sandwich)

And finally its Chocolate Wasted Time!:
_Chocolate chunks pizza (choice of crunchy hazelnut bits, bananas, peanut butter or roasted marshmallows) 
_[The Works] Everything on the pizza that is listed right above (BUT, I'm not a fan of the overly layered roasted marshmallows on top of the pizza)  
_Crystal sugar churros fondue (6 pieces, with milk chocolate, caramel, & raspberry dipping sauce)

Service: [3-4 stars]
Just hope you get a server who can give good recommendations on the food they serve, unless you already know what you want, then you should be fine.
Twice have i already experienced two servers who aren't knowledgeable of the menu to recommend something worth trying besides the plenty of desserts that they serve. 
And based on their answers, I can almost say that this place is better off pleasing customers with a sweet tooth.

NOTE: this review is based on what I have tried, so get chocolate wasted on your own choices ;)",IuEb-wEFXIGSSH1ctOSX3w,16,13,4,2xh8ECry1rQla9tqlvIibg

The ice cream bars, the banana tempura fondue, the banana split latte, the BALT. Everything. It's all amazing. While the service is sometimes a bit off, it never matters. As long as the chocolate is there I don't care. The restaurant even LOOKS like chocolate. There are pipes all around leading to the bar which has large tubs of milk, white, and dark chocolate. I've wondered if anyone has ever stupidly tried to break those pipes open. 

P.S. If you're going to come to Max Brenner, you MUST get something with chocolate in it. It makes me sad when I see people come in and order just a salad and a water. It makes me want to force feed them chocolate. Come here to indulge!",3CMiTAhq_o_GP1tLs-ihbg,1,0,5,GWu_diQAB90yDQwyaMsFeQ

I ordered the banana split waffles that had bananas and carmelized rice krispies on it.  The bananas and rice krispies were delicious, but the waffle had the consistency of a donut.  The whipped cream was below the waffle, so it had already been absorbed into the waffle when I received it.  I was very disappointed that the waffle already had syrup on it, so it was super sweet.  I've never had waffles where they added the syrup already for you, so it was quite a surprise.  Thankfully the chocolate ganache came on the side.

Ordered their Brenner Burger, just your average, normal burger. It came with all your usual fixin's & waffle fries. The sauce was to-die for! My boyfriend had their Steak Panini & he loved it.

Overall, it was a good food experience. Just wasn't a fan for their Chocolate 'Tini and ambiance. Hostess and server weren't attentive. We were in the very front of the line but the hostess decided to seat the larger party behind us because she knew them. I was in a nice mood so I didn't go off on her. The server seemed a little rude too, as if he didn't want to serve us.

1402342,2011-12-07,2,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Came back again after completing the Vegas RnR half marathon.   Their hot chocolate and their cookies are the best I've had.  

Their italian hot chocolate is so creamy and smooth that it coats your esophagus all the way on its down to your stomach and it leaves you with that warm feeling of satisfaction.   It tastes like melted chocolate.  In my last review, I wrote that I felt like I was drinking the from the chocolate river of Willy Wonka's factory.  (Though, if you think about it, Wonka's chocolate river would be a cesspool for disease and bacteria).  Nevertheless, if you want to see what an uncontaminated hot chocolate river would taste like, then you should check this place out!

Their cookie is filled with chocolate chunks and heavy.  It's dense, its perfectly chewy, and it's just really rich and great.  At $5 a pop it's expensive, but that's because of how much chocolate they pump into it.  I wouldn't be surprised if they told me that the cookie was a quarter or half a pound.  

If you're looking to buy chocolate from their shop, I have to tell you that their chocolate is probably as good as it gets.  It's only matched by XOX Truffles in SF.  I bought a box of their ""Caramelized Pecans rolled in praline cream and fine cocoa powder"" and it was just creamy and smooth.  It's too good.  

As you'd see in my last review, I gave them 4 stars because I felt like their savories weren't perfect.  I didn't quite like their burgers, but I did like their omelette.  Try your luck with their savories if you'd like (though I'd recommend that you go elsewhere), but absolutely don't miss their sweets.",0hMC8tPtc_K_ACAj7pss_Q,4,4,5,qVUGpNCX8iPzvGJST_CNvA

I give this review 5 stars because their food is innovative and amazing and their prices are fair. I really like how they have private dining areas. Our party of 16 was seated in a separate room that had closed doors. We were able to enjoy ourselves in privacy. Our server, Chris was on top of it! He handled all of our orders and drinks and was super efficient. He brought out things that we would need before we even asked for them.  Although it is a chocolate themed restaurant, not everything on the menu has chocolate. Their milkshakes are to die for! I'd highly suggest getting the onion rings.

I came across Max Brenner while walking through Caesar's Palace.  I knew I was going to need a brunch spot for Sunday morning and their menu looked good.  What I experienced was pure chocolate greatness.

The waitress didn't make my selection too easy.  Everything I asked about she said was really good.  It wasn't that she didn't have an opinion.  I think she really did enjoy everything I was considering.

For starters, I ordered the Choco-Pops chocolate drink.  It's served warm in a ""hug"" mug that requires using both hands.  It was probably some of the best chocolate I've ever had.  If the waitress had twisted my arm, I would have considered getting multiple cups.

Almost everything on the food menu appeared to include chocolate of some form.  I bet it's all good.  For my entree I went with the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes.  They're topped with pecans, caramelized bananas and served with both dark and white chocolate sauces.  They were perfect and delicious.  All the flavors complimented each other very well and you could tell the chocolate was of a good quality.

In addition to my pancakes, I ordered a side of bacon.  I'm not sure exactly what it's seasoned with, but it had sort of a spicy, Cajun flavor.  It tasted so good with the sweetness of the pancakes.  I'd definitely recommend adding the bacon to any dish you order.

I dont want to sit outside because its impersonable if you're trying to have a conversation and there are tons of people strolling with shopping bags through the mall. Not ideal.. so YES hostess.. I WOULD like to sit inside EVEN if it is ""hectic""

He informed us that either option was OK. But NEVER came to check up on us!

He gave our check and we left, BUT we could have easily dined and dashed since he paid NOOOO attention to us!

I had my first chocolate cocktail. I believe it was called the mocha madness. As good as the cocktail was, paying around $14-15 is way overpriced for a small drink. Yes, it does taste pretty good and it is really unique and I love the plating but as good as it was, I think I rather spend my money somewhere else. (No offense) 

My friend got the ice cream bar thing. It was around $8 for something that's prob not really homemade ice cream that comes with 3 toppings: nuts, chocolate sauce, and chocolate pebbles. As I said, I really love the plating but the ice cream was eh. The weird part was seeing my friend not even using half the toppings for each item...so to me I just find this place to be overprice.

I was walking in The Forum Shops wen I saw that there was Max Brenner. My initial reaction was excitement as all the rich chocolatel-y memories of my first experience at Max Brenner in NY came flooding back. The decor is basically the same but the NY store is obviously bigger/more elaborate.
The dessert menu is the same as the one in NY as well. 

I decided to try something different. I got the Mocha Frappe - and although the menu states ""Milk Chocolate"" our server asked me if I wanted Dark, Milk or white. Of course I chose dark chocolate :)  I didn't get to enjoy the hug mug this time but the Alice ""drink me"" cups were pretty cool!  The drink itself wasn't sweet at all and was actually quite bitter - but in a ""i'm-strong-espresso"" way. Delightfully refreshing. 

My friend ordered The fantastic Popsicle Chocolate Fondue. I didn't know what to expect when it came but it was adorable! In three little bowls there was the melted chocolate, crunchy wafer balls & candied hazelnut crunchy bits. So basically it was like dip it yourself. The vanilla ice cream bar itself is a magnum ice cream bar - creamy and delicious. I could eat the crunch wafer balls & candied hazelnut crunchy bits by themselves. 

AND best part was that while we were waiting for our dessert, my friend went to purchase something from the store as a gift. When she came back and our server saw that she had a bag - she asked if we received the 10% discount. We were unaware of the discount and she promptly applied the discount and gave us our money back. Yay! :)

I had the Alfredo penne pasta, some fondue for two, as well as a couple of slices of my friend's oven roasted tomato pizza. The pizza was VERY thin crusted and had a thin layer of tomato sauce as well as some pieces of cheese and tomatoes spread evenly across the top. It was honestly like a few sheets of paper stacked on top of each other for ~$14.

As for the pasta, it was again, nothing special. There wasn't really anything wrong with it other than the fact that it was ~$16 for like 4 bites. The taste was okay and was probably the best thing I ate there.

Finally, the fondue for two was ~$25 for a plate of some strawberries, blueberries, bananas, a few brownies and cookies, marshmallows, and a scoop of ice cream. It was hardly worth the price.

My experience here was really disappointing and did not meet my expectations. The food didn't taste bad but it was definitely not worth it.

1560684,2012-02-27,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"My wife and I spent a few days in Vegas, and one of our favorite things to do is try out as many restaurants as we can while we're out there.  We had tried a few new places already on this trip, and had been left greatly disappointed, almost to the point where we were considering going to the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops, even though there is a Cheesecake Factory 10 minutes from our house.  We were staying at Caesar's and wanted something close, as this was our last night in Vegas and we were pretty much ""walked out.""  After scouring Yelp, OpenTable, and others, we ended up at Max Brenners, intrigued by some of the ways they incorporate chocolate into their meals.

We had made reservations for 7:30 on a Friday night, expecting the place to be mobbed.  We walked over and found it maybe half full, the entire upper level was empty.  Guess we didn't need the reservations, but it always makes me a bit nervous when a restaurant isn't busy at a peak time, but it's Vegas so peak times are going to be skewed a bit.

We had looked over the menu a bit at our hotel room, so my wife and I both kinda knew what we wanted already, but still spent time checking out our other options.  I went with the Brenner Burger, and my wife got the mac n cheese.  We skipped appetizers as we really wanted dessert.

The waitress was a little slow on keeping our drinks full, but she was overall nice and helpful in recommendations on the menu.

When reading the menu I saw that the onion rings on my burger were ""black and tan"" onion rings.  I instantly thought beer battered onions rings, and figured they were something along those lines.  After taking a few bites of the burger though, and noticing some additional flavors I wasn't used to in a burger, I can only guess that the tan part was a regular batter for onion rings, and the black was chocolate.  The burger was very simple, but incredible.  I normally go a bit crazy on the gourmet burgers, but this one was nice and simple and very tasty.  The fries were also very good, the cocoa and chili powder complimented each other very well.

The mac and cheese was good as well.  My wife added chicken to it, which I might have skipped, but it was still very good and flavorful.

Then came dessert.  My wife got some crazy chocolate cake thing, and I went with a White Chocolate Cheesecake Crepe.  I've never been a huge fan of the type of cake my wife got, but it was pretty damn good.  My crepe had a bit less white chocolate and cheesecake than I expected, there was an orange flavor that kind of empowered the other flavors, but still tasty.

Overall it was a pretty good dinner, and the price wasn't completely outrageous like you find at a lot of other restaurants in Vegas.  And afterwards we got to walk through the Forum Shops and laugh at all of the trainwrecks in Vegas on a Friday night!",1rJH9vhwcX5J5HyWzM944w,0,0,4,U8S7MDVF4QnWzlf7SslIQQ

He speaks to the chocolate lover in you. 

Picked up a dark hot chocolate that comes in a ""hug"" mug.
It's their ""cappuccino"" of hot chocolates - light, frothy and oh so smooth. 
It warms you inside out. 

We also grabbed a steak panini  --  delicious thin sliced beef with a medium sized toasted bread. Comes with a side of waffle fries. =) 

I want to say the menu changes -- because I see photos of items not on the menu. 
They have a whole dessert menu dedicated to chocolate -- waffles, drinks, fondue, ice cream, chocolate chip pizza. =) If you don't want to dine in, they have a small counter right outside it for a quick order.

$$$$ So, as much as I liked this place, it was pretty expensive. Sandwich was $17, which you could get at Earl's (at Planet Hollywood) for $6/$7 (w/o fries). The hot chocolate WAS delicious, but at $6 for a small cup, I might just venture over to starbucks or coffeebean.$$$$

Great coffee - love their Kangaroo coffee cup !!  Great tea - wow so distinctly served with its own wooden tray biscuit and allowing you to take your time for the brew and release to the cup & the deserts .. while all the food is great, the deserts and Cocktails & Chocolate Aphrodisiacs are a must ...

Ok so this is not my first visit there, I was friendly with all tables close by talking to them I was not surprised to find out many other people were having the same wonderful experience as I do and they ALL LOVED IT !!!

Service was excellent and attentive, Chocolate must be in the air cause all those servers were smiling and looked like they enjoy the place and like their work.  

Decor - earthy wood furniture and color scheme reminiscent of different chocolate shades with pipes going through the ceiling to the different chocolate brews machines ... love it !

When I was going there I passed by Denny's on the strip they had over 1 hour wait .. and yes you can end up in Denny's paying about 5$ less per person and get a bigger portion stand out in the heat ... and wait an hour and half .... or you can do what I did ... cross the road to the Forum shops, locate Max Brenner and have an amazing celebration for your taste buds ... while you can have here a breakfast for about 15-20 incl your coffee I highly recommend to  bring your wallet so that you can buy one of the cocktails and indulge in one of the deserts and enjoy more of what this place has to offer .... and save the visit to Denny's when your back home ... they are everywhere.

I fell in love with this place in NYC, and on a recent trip to Las Vegas, I knew I haddddd to indulge here! Max Brenner did not disappoint! The Las Vegas location is inside The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. While beautiful from the outside, it definitely did not compare to the interior of the NYC location. The NYC location just blows your away with all the chocolate-y goodness eye candy.

Anyway, we each ordered an entree (I had the huevos rancheros sunrise burrito). The restaurant is cool in that it's willing to customize things for you. I was able to take out the sausage, and substitute for egg whites, with no charge. Very nice! I ordered the Italian Thick Hot Chocolate for my drink (which was my fav in NYC), and we also ordered the banana split waffle to share for dessert. It came with mini chocolate truffles, chocolate sauce, and vanilla bean ice cream. What a fantastic way to top off a meal!

After indulging in all of the awesome food, we picked up a few goodies in the Max Brenner chocolate shop at the front of the restaurant. Can't leave without a few things to take home and let melt in your mouth!

1650520,2012-06-06,3,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"~~~This is a Chocolate Love Story~~~~~

Once upon a time, a bald man name Max Brenner came up with a brilliant idea to develop a restaurant that focus on chocolate and created dozens of deliciously sweet treats that attracted customers to his chocolate haven. 

I got my friends excited to check in out in Vegas last weekend which they were really thrilled about after seeing all the great sweet photos on yelp. When we entered the restaurant, we were immediately taken a back by the sweet and delicious smell of chocolate.. the perfumic smell of the cocoa was just heaven.. thats usually how I feel when I enter a coffee shop like Starbucks or Coffeebean. The smell of chocolate and coffee is blissful!

FOOD:

Spicy Chicken & 3 Cheese Pizza- Blackbeans, jalapeno, cilantro, mozzarella, cheddar, and goat cheese. Pizza was really thin but flavor was really not there. No cheesyness to the dish that you normally look for in a pizza. For some reason it reminded me of taco bell's mexican pizza.. just how it looked minus the ground meat and beans you would find at taco bell. I would not order this again. 

Sliced and Diced Steak Pillow Panini- Char grilled and thin skirt steak tossed with diced caramelized onionson a bed of asagio cheese crips, baby spinach, roasted tomatoes, red pepper aioli with a side of waffle fries which is sprinkled with chili and cocoa powder. Waffle fries were good and prob the best part about the dish because it was freshly fried. You didn't really taste the sweetness of the cocoa powder so I think it definitely sounds more interesting then it actually taste. The sliced steak was kind of touch and didn't have much flavor or spice to it. The sauce made the bread soggy (which is a pet peeve of mine) so when I picked it up, the bottom of the bread is all wet and soggy. The panini looked good but there was definitely something lacking in this dish because it was a let down amongst the group.

Chocolate Hazelnutt Shake- ""Drink Me"" is labeled on the cup. This ain't as shake.. its more like.. a chocolate hazlenutt.. melted yogurt/ice cream drink because it was SOOOO THICK. you seriously needed to suck on the straw with some force and it will get you full fast if you drink the whole thing before your meal! The shake was also really sweet too.. I passed around my drink around the table and each time someone has a taste of it, they are like ""damn.. its thick.. and really sweet."" Total let down again and definitely looks better than it taste. 

The Works Chocolate Pizza with Toasted marshmallows, peanut butter, and banana- SWEET SWEET SWEET. Crust was okay.. pretty thick and dry. I would not get this again either. 

Dessert Crepe-  Crepe with banana, a side of choco crisps, and chocolate syrup. Crepe was good, choco syrup on the side would make your crepe too sweet but the texture of the crepe was nice and thin and good. 

Overall, the sweets were toO sweet for me and my friends taste and the savory dish was just ""okay"".. nothing you want to order again or made a great impression on us. Don't get me wrong, I was a fan of Max Brenner when I went to it in NY and loved the whole concept of it but for some reason it was a let down when I tried it again in Vegas. Just the price of the food and the quality and taste we received at the place just did not match. 

Sorry Max, there isn't a happy ending to this Chocolate Love Story. You do smell good though... =P",-3GwonyrKEu4tHSO11bSRQ,2,1,2,T8ykhLPV6uH5M-mkXGhg3g

Even if the mac n cheese doesn't have chocolate, then your drink is sure to have chocolate. You can betcha bottom dollah, that drink is pure chocolate...at least mine was. It was half dark and half milk chocolate. I was drowned...in chocolate. I actually fought the tenacity to ask the waitress to cut my chocolate drink with a little milk. After a bit, she returned with my drink, and it turns out they actually warmed the milk before adding it to my Italian Thick Hot Chocolate, as it was called.

My un-chocolate item was their recommended crunchy mac n cheese. I didn't really get what the big deal is about this dish. It has bacon. *crickets* Big deal. 

My beau had the Peanut Butter Chockie. It was just okay for me. I did enjoy my Italian Thick Hot Chocolate more (after it was cut with the warm milk). I love the cute little Hug Mug my drink was served in. 

For the most part, the concept of this chain is fun, but next time, I would skip the mac n cheese. I can very easily whip up yummier crunchy mac n cheese at home.",oLVKX7yWg7UcdekDGkfpfw,1,3,3,0c0zseKtSzIqv46A2DJ-eQ

We ended up ordering the Blackened Skirt Steak & Mushroom Quesadilla and Max's Sunday Mood Pasta. The quesadilla was an entire meal by itself. It was huge! We only finished half of it and took the rest to go. The pasta was very tasty, which was similar to the Pasta DaVinci at Cheesecake Factory.

I made a mistake by ordering an alcoholic cocktail here, when I should have ordered some chocolate drink... next time for sure! Anyways, for dessert we were already stuffed, so we just ordered the Melting Chocolate Heart Truffle Heart Cake & Shake. It was delicious! I'm drooling just thinking about it.... yuummmmm!

Located inside of Caesar's Palace Forum Shops, Max Brenner is a chocolate lovers paradise. It's like a real life Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory without the creepy oompa loompa's. The dark decor inside of the restaurant almost made it look as if everything is made of chocolate, especially the staircase. They actually have big clear tubes throughout the joint that are pumping milk chocolate. 

This place was put on my radar by my two Yelp buddies Michelle T and Dru C, both of whom had nothing but great things to say about it.

All the employees I encountered were great. They all seemed to love working for Max Brenner. Prices are a bit high but the products are so amazing it's easy to look past that.

We got this insanely good dessert, it was like smushed Smores or something in a small pot and it was DELICIOUS. Came with bananas and also melted chocolate to drizzle over it ...

First the service here is not really that great overall. The first night we came here we were sat and placed our order, the person that delivered the entrees took one of our dishes to the wrong table next to us, then he went away to try to figure out where the food went. He took forever and the people at the other table ended up handing our food to us, and finally our waitress came with the rest of the food. We also ordered an appetizer and that did not come out until after the main dishes were almost gone.

The second day we came during happy hour and told we had to sit at the bar to get those prices. So we moved to the bar and two bartenders told us they would be right with us, which apparently meant more then 20 minutes, there was very few people in the place at the time too. Finally we got tired of it and went back to our table and skipped the happy hour pricing. I also noticed that two fairly attractive women came to the bar after we went back to our table, they were helped right away and they even finished and left before us. Great to know they value all the customers equally. 

As far as the food, the regular food was average nothing special, not bad and not great. The desserts were actually pretty good, we had a shake and a waffle banana split.

Saying ""This is it! I'm gonna eat some chocolate so prime!""
This place is in the left wing of Caesar's Forum Shops
On our four-day trip this was one of our scheduled stops
Greeted on a semi-crowded Tuesday night, nicely
Seated to the souvenir shop's left and kitchen's right, precisely
We looked at the menu and were astounded by the selection
We needed someone to point us in the right direction

And ooooooooooh...I didn't listen to the waitress' recommendation (about maybe not getting the sampler)
And ooooooooooh...I better listen next time, I'm telling you
If we ever ever ever go back to Vegas we should remember
That we will get together together together with Max Brenner
We'll order the O.M.G. cookie
Order the milkshakes
Order food savory
So we may get together together together again with Max Brenner

""But shouldn't every chocolate dessert be 5-star here?"", I think
And shouldn't all the flavors in their sampler be clear, and in sync
And while the milk and white chocolate bark ""branches"" were exciting
And the chocolate sauce and chocolate wafer balls made the ice cream inviting
The banana tempura had a strange batter and aftertaste
And the chocolate sponge cake had no chocolate flavor, what a waste
And while the waffle with fruit made me somewhat happy
The next morning I had a much better waffle with fruit at Mon Ami Gabi

And while the fondue was nice, it didn't fill my chocolate wish
They had to start the marshmallow grill flame twice because once it did extinguish
But however ever ever disappointed I was by this endeavor
I don't know if we'll sever sever sever our ties to Max Brenner
While we liked the bark branch
Liked the fondue
Liked the ice cream
We may never ever ever go back to Max Brenner 

And while the waitress was bubbly and endearing and sweet
The management had her working too many tables; she looked flustered and beat

While the concept is a clever clever clever cocoa endeavor
Should we ever ever ever go back to Max Brenner?

I've yet to be disappointed by anything else I've ordered from here.  Their Blackened Skirt Steak & Mushroom Quesadilla is the best quesadilla I've ever tasted!

We have asked for a simple explanation of the new items of the menu and suggestion, I got a chicken burger, and my sister got the waffle sandwich, very innovative idea with savory waffle. Actually very good. But of course the highlight is the chocolate menu. Our heads were spinning as there were so many items to choose from. We ended up choosing the chocolate truffle cake-warm lava coming out of the cake paired up with chocolate shake. I wish I know the server's name, he was awesome! The next night, we could not resist and went back for an Italian Hot cocoa dark chocolate and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was not as impressive as the chocolate cake from the night before but still VERY good!

 I am a bit of a mac and cheese snob, where my boyfriend swears by Kraft. When my order came out he was all over it. His pillow panini was delicious as well, the meat cooked perfectly and the waffles fries went amazing with the aoli sauce that it came with. His only complaint was that the bread was a bit thick (hence pillow) and it was crispy all the way through, where he though pillow meant crunchy outside and soft on the inside.

The mac and cheese was perfection! Creamy enough, crunchy a bit because of the bread crumbs and the bacon bits were the perfect touch! It also comes with a marinara sauce on the side, which I've never thought to put with mac and cheese but it was the perfect combination. It was having two types of pasta in one dish!

The second time we were here, we came just for dessert (we were too full the first time). We came with five people total and ordered three things. The fondue for two, the chocolate heart cake and shake, and the churros. The fondue for two was the perfect amount of everything, we had the milk chocolate option, it came with super moist banana nut bread, fried bananas, strawberries, ice cream, chocolate wafers, regular bananas and marshmallows. The finishing touch was the open flame that you got to roast your marshmallows over. 

The churros were awesome as well. You could definitely tell that the churros were made in house, it came with caramel sauce, milk chocolate sauce AND raspberry sauce.

Lastly was the heart cake and shake. This is where the minus star comes from. The cake was a lava cake of sorts, but it was incredibly dry. We each had a bite, and we just pretty much left the rest. The shake was super cute and perfect for one person to take a sip from. The best part was the chocolate sauce that was in the shake. It's meant to be used over the cake, but we ended up using it on just about everything!

We had the sloppy Max sliders, the Brenner Burger sliders, and the Mexican hot chocolate with milk chocolate.  OH SWEET JESUS the hot chocolate was good.  We initially ordered one to share but the second I tasted it I knew that would not be happening.  We got one more but I tell you I could have drunk that stuff by the potful.  If you like a little bit of kick, DEFINITELY try that.  I was sad I couldn't buy some mix or something to take home.

The truffles were not as good as the ones I got from Vosges also in Caesar's but they were tasty.  My favorite was the chili and cornflakes one and the hazelnut cream pecan one (or something...I tried to look it up on the website but I'm having a hard time finding the flavors).

Not super pricey either (for Vegas) so check it out if you're looking for a quick bite and something to satisfy your sweet tooth!

I don't even know where to start. This place is great for so many reasons. 

First, forget the chocolate obsession - we will get back to that in a second. Max Brenner actually serves really delicious brunch/lunch food.   I was surprised to see such an extensive menu, sure to please any craving (both sweet and savory)!  I had their BLT with house-made fries and everything was just so perfectly executed, and  so generous in portion. My friends shared a goat cheese scramble of some sort, which was also very tasty.

Ok let's talk chocolate. Holy Shit. Here chocolate comes in every form, shape, size, color. It can be a drink, a cocktail, an appetizer, your entree, your dessert, or all of the above.  Since we were in Vegas, we could not skip the alcoholic part of the menu. I got the Mocha Madness which came with little biscotti type cookies and it was delightful. Usually chocolate & liquor drinks tend to hurt my stomach but this was not too heavy.  My friend got the non-alcoholic hot chocolate served in a special ""hug mug"" (yes it's soo cute) and it was so rich and decadent and rich and decadent and rich (did I say that already?). Borderline indescribable. We could not stop drinking it. Wow. A must order!  My friends also split the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes. Ya, the name kind of says it all so I'll let your imagination do the rest. It was so so good.

I think the icing on the cake was our superb waiter. He was so patient as we got lost in the menu, accommodating to our many requests, and gave us amazing recommendations. Although as far as I'm concerned, it seems you can't go wrong with any item with a Max Brenner stamp. 

I don't usually consider Vegas a very romantic place (I'm more of the clubbing and pool lounging type) but I would come here with my fiance just so we can have a Max Brenner foodgasm together and then go comatose by the pool. True story.",_XFhTYX3wS0ftGc9u4pLqw,1,1,5,_Hc856qOFYdhhO6YR5UEDw
1905183,2012-03-21,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"I give them 2 stars instead of 1 because the manager (Erica M.) somewhat tried to resolve the problem.  The problem is we had mediocre server and at split bill time she was put out and rude about the whole transaction.  I'll start with we were a group of 7 with separate payments.  I can guarantee that in a convention town, that is a common occurrence.  I am also quite familiar with the Micros POS and simplicity of splitting checks or multiple payments.  GRANTED, its a pain but seeing that the restaurant was 1/4 full, I highly doubt an extra 4 minutes was going to impact the server's overall tip for the shift.  Back to business, the automatic 18% was added to the bill to protect the server from bad tippers on big party...standard and totally fair.  Who protects the customer?  I had a problem with the service so adjusting the tip would have been my resolution.  Not the first time to have bad service on a big party, server is guaranteed their money and they can do what they want.  We had 2 glasses of wine for our whole party, so her average check charge per person was low.  I CLEARLY saw her giving more service to her table with bottles of wine...smart for the server (she raises her per check charge and in turn makes more of her set 18% gratuity) bad for the establishment because an experienced F/B customer gets bad service and writes an honest review.  I admit this is a rant but please see my review distribution, I give way more 4/5 stars then anything.

Manager resolution, come in again and we'll take care of you...great idea if I lived in Las Vegas.  I addressed my issue with the service, not the food, not the environment but the service.  Make us happy and adjust the 18%, simple psychology would say you can guarantee that server will do it again, she got her money!

I definitely think this could easily be for four gals.  We sampled everything several times and half remained.  Definitely a great smorgasbord of MB's best.  All were excellent, loved all the crispy textures and the choco was very high quality.  Marshmallows were lovely and had a lighter, only slightly sweet taste, much better than store bought. Banana on the waffle was caramelized perfectly.  I wanted to smuggle the choco wafer balls, but I think they would have melted in the club.

Even the espresso had a choco touch, squares resting at the edge of the cup, melting whilst drinking & slowly gliding into the cocoa river.

Super DECADENT and RICH! You could tell the chocolate was very good quality. The caramel was infused very well. The one thing that I thought was missing when I took my first few sips was the sea salt. I didn't find out till later that it was in the foam at the top! So remember to mix it well!

The first time was for dinner with reservations made on Yelp through the app. Hubs and I showed up promptly on Tuesday night. The restaurant wasn't busy and we were seated immediately. 

Our waiter greeted us and have us the 411 on Max Brenner. I ordered the steak panini ($16.50) and Hubs ordered the cheese steak waffle sandwich ($14.95). The food took about 20 minutes. The steak panini was delicious and a little messy since the ingredients were chopped so it kept falling out. Hubs sandwich was a disaster. The taste was good but the waffle was thin and got soggy. He gave up on using his hands and went with flat ware. The waffle fries are to die for crispy and seasoned perfectly. For dessert we shared ""The works"" half portion pizza ($9.95) OMG, talk about a sugar high. It was all of my favs in one, carbs, banana, peanuts, chocolate and marshmallows. A small slice is all I needed since it was so rich. 

Our second visit was for brunch the next day. I made reservations the night before but it wasn't needed. When we showed up it was pretty dead. I ordered the ""Max-ican"" omelette (with egg whites $14.95) and Hubs ordered the tomato, bacon and cream cheese bagel ($6.95) and a pumpkin pie hot chocolate ($5.95) Brunch was delivered quickly. The omelette and potatoes were okay. The omelette didn't have much flavor and the potatoes were hard, cold and over fried. The biscuit was sweet, soft and warm so good with or without the chocolate dipping sauce.

Service was great during both visits by the waiters, Beau and Ruy. I over heard the staff talking about how they were all sick during our brunch visit and saw one of them blowing and wiping their nose behind the bar area where the crepes area made. That was pretty disgusting and unprofessional. If that happened during our first visit we wouldn't have returned. 

Prices for the food quality and portions are average. It is a cool place and has good menu options. I'm turned off by some of the staff's actions, the complaining about being sick and the hostess not knowing how to take/make reservations (long story short it took 10 minutes to get it done)

2036412,2010-12-26,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"I waiver on how exactly to rate this return experience. Service was 1 star, entrees were 2 to 3 stars, and dessert was 5 stars. I think what we have concluded from this return experience is that the manager is awesome and it's best to stick to menu items containing chocolate (I really should've ordered that amazing crepe again).

I suppose as to be reasonably expected, the place was packed. I must say that some of the tables are quite close together. The person sitting at the table behind me was constantly knocking into me throughout the course of our dining.

Our server was...odd? I can't quite find the right word. It was the weirdest, and worst, serving experience I think I've ever had. So here's the somewhat play-by-play:

- We sit for while. Server comes over, says nothing, and sets down napkins. 
- We sit there again for awhile. Server comes over and takes our drink and appetizer order, quickly picking up the menus and swiftly departing before we can finish ordering. Uh... 
- Server returns, says nothing, sets down forks, and quickly leaves again before we can say anything.
- Server brings waters and apologizes for the drink wait saying it wasn't his fault (never thought that it was his fault). We then manage to capture his attention and place our entree order.
- Wings arrive, but we have no plates or knives (yes, some of us are strange enough to want to eat wings with a knife and fork). But thankfully, the server eventually comes by to ask how everything is and we are able to ask for the knives and forks.
- Drinks arrive, but he gives none of us straws (which ok, may not be totally necessary, but is customary for things like ice tea - and we wanted straws).
- Server comes over and snatches the plate from in front of me (reaching across the table to do so), never saying a word (ok, yes, I was now done and all the other plates were already cleared, but it was really awkward and weird).
- Entrees arrive (not delivered by our server). Server never comes over to check on how things are. We take our time eating - server never makes another appearance.
- Manager comes over and asks how everything is (after we are almost all finished eating). He is very nice and insists that we tell him the truth about how everything was (maybe our exchanged glances gave us away when he didn't buy the whole ""everything's fine""). My husband filled him in on some of the basics and he sincerely apologized and said dessert was on him.
- We are asked if we want anything else to drink (by someone else, not our server). We all order re-fills finally.
- Manager comes back and takes our dessert order.
- Server comes by to ask if we are all set (our check in his hand). When my husband says that we are still picking at it (but otherwise all done), the server snatches the check back and speeds off. Uh...
- Eventually, the server brings the check back and we pay.

The food was a-ok. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things? Or perhaps it was just that almost everything was over-cooked?

The excellent:
- The wings were divine. Absolutely divine! Definitely 5 stars for the wings. Perfect size and meatiness. The sauce was amazing! It was a BBQ-type sauce, but with a slightly spicy kick and hints of orange (and everything had a very light dusting of chocolate). And the dipping sauce was fantastic. It was blue cheese with something I can't quite pinpoint added to it. So so yummy!

The good:
- The home fries that came with my omelet were quite delicious. Perfect amount of crispy on the outside and perfect seasoning. And the diced peppers added a nice kick and sweetness to them.

The a-ok:
- The hangover omelet was good. The fillings and cheese were very generous which I appreciated. The flavors were good. It just wasn't anything particularly notable. And it was a little over-cooked.
- Pretty much ditto on the breakfast skillet my dad ordered.

The so-so:
- The burger looked so insanely delicious, but it was well-done instead of the medium my husband had ordered. Now, of course, this didn't stop him from eating all of it. But then again, it's not like our server came over to ask how it was. (We were pleasantly surprised when the check arrived and the burger was taken off.)
- The waffle fries were ok. Good crispiness, but the dusting of chocolate and chile powder didn't actually seem to add any flavor to them. Not as good and exciting as we anticipated.

The ""can't barely eat this"":
- My mom claimed the Belgian waffle was barely edible. She did not like how dense it was and felt it was over-cooked.

Now, the desserts, of course, were divine. The chocolate fondue was delicious and fun. The chocolate truffle heart cake was amazingly decadent. And all of the presentations were amazing and perfect.

In conclusion, we will definitely be here again, but I hope we have a different server and we'll be sticking to the chocolate-based menu items (and, of course, the wings!). And big props to the manager - he kinda saved our experience this time",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,3,0,3,H79PIsfoSyLHG21xnDJWcg

My friend ordered the chocolatrouge wine which the waitress described as 50% rich merlot, 50% chocolate and ohmigosh. That's just what it was. Now normally, I don't go for wine at all, but this one was pretty alright. I could definitely taste the chocolate in it. My friend didn't really like it but hey, he's a guy. 

I ordered the baja style fish tacos, that were served with red beans and steamed rice. But I had them put the fish on the side cause I'm a crazy vegetarian. But my friend ate it for me & was like OMG! This is freaking amazing! He said that it was very chili-lime flavored. So I'm assuming that it was pretty good. Just the coleslaw in the tacos was good to me. Although I would have liked Mexican rice instead of white. 

My friend ordered the southwest Caesar salad. It was your basic Caesar salad, served with homemade croutons, grape tomatoes, avocado and a cheese crisp wafer thing. It was alright as far as Caesar salads go.  

For dessert We ordered ""the works"" chocolate chunks pizza. It was a pastry dough covered in double chocolate melting chunks and topped with crunchy hazelnut bits, bananas, peanut butter and roasted marshmallows.

Ironically, I had nothing that contained chocolate-although there might have been some in the espresso, not too sure though. I started with an orange smoothie which was nice and cinnamony but I am not a fan of the metal straw, steel apparently is not too tasty. I had the huevos rancheros burrito which was awesomelicious. It came with nice crispy tater tots and the burrito was spiced well.

This is definitely a place to take kids (order the mac and cheese $8.25) and make room for dessert.  Entrees are pretty good,  and prices are standard with comparable restaurants.  What you are paying for is the atmosphere---e.g. kids get a super sized ""syringe"" when they order the mac and cheese which is filled with a marinara sauce.  They loved this concept.  My kids especially enjoyed the chocolate pizza with toasted marshmallows on top--which I didn't care too much for because I was enjoying my chocolate cake oozing with warm milk/white chocolate.

2170578,2013-12-07,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"My friends and I hit Max Brenner for dinner before heading over to Absinthe last year. We were looking for a moderately priced dinner option as we were all watching our wallets to balance out the shopping and shows :) My friend raved about the restaurant, so away we went. We had a great time, and the food was fantastic. The perfect lead in to a great night. 

Fast forward a year later, we are back in Vegas and have put this on our list for a must stop. We had lunch there yesterday, and we honestly were not at our best. We both seem to have picked up a bad cold and were fighting the symptoms. But determined to enjoy our vacation, we were going to go shopping and have a great lunch. Not wanting to splurge on crazy cocktails or $6 beers, I asked if there was any way I could get a Hot Toddy as I thought it would be the perfect tool to help in my fight against my headache and sore throat. She said they could absolutely make one for us, and would just charge for the tea ($1.95) and the shot (we went with brandy for $3.95). My friend ordered one too and we were delighted when we were both presented with the lovely pallets that were our drinks. A wooden board with a glass of hot water, tea bag, honey and a beaker with the shot so we could customize our drink. And we each got a powder sugar topped lady finger to complete the beautiful presentation. I was truly surprised at the effort that was put in for our simple request. 

I ordered the cobb salad and my friend had an omelet with side salad, both were very tasty. And while I enjoyed the food, it was the service that really made the experience grand. They were just so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure we had a lovely time (even explaining how to make one of the salads that had been taken off the menu that my friend had been looking forward to ordering). Our server even gave us some great recommendations on things to do on Fremont St and when we mentioned wanting to get a small piece of chocolate to end the meal, she gave us a coupon to the gift shop and a few recommendations.

Now, I should honestly tell you that I am not a huge chocolate fan (shocking I know!), but I was intrigued by the way that chocolate was being incorporated into the ingredients.

The food, the service, and the smell of chocolate in the air made for a great dinner, and sitting outside on the patio (although it's not really outside but just a view of people passing by the Forum Shops) was pretty relaxing.

DRINKS:

Satisfaction Guaranteed!  Nope, that's not what I think about the drinks here, that is in fact that actual name of a drink.  It's pretty much like a spiked chocolate milk (castries peanut liqueur, caramel liqueur, milk chocolate served up)....but a very very very notched up version which was amazing.  They serve it to you in a martini glass (sans stem) which is placed in a small bowl of ice to keep it cold while you drink it.  It also comes with a small beaker with some extra in it as well as some spicy peanuts which really do add to the flavor of the drink as you enjoy it.  

FOOD:

The food was great. To start, we got the onion rings which come with a chocolate ranch dressing. Now some of you might be thinking ""blech!!!"" but I have to say...don't knock it to you try it. It's pretty mild, so don't expect a huge burst of flavor...just enjoy it for it is.

For my main course I had the grilled asparagus crepe and it was huge! (That's what she said! lol).   It was very flavorful and filled with perfectly al dente  aspargus and a lot of cheese.  An excellent way to be induced into a food coma.

Unfortunately I simply had no room for dessert, but did buy some pieces of individual chocolate from the store inside.  One to try (if they still have it)...chocolate filled with halva.  Halva is a Middle Eastern thing (difficult to explain really), so I really impressed that they would have such a chocolate there.   The chocolates overall were VERY good (although I still think Tseucher is the best) and were a great way to end the meal.

I would highly recommend you come here at least once to see what it's all about.  The menu is fairly large and there are many options for picky eaters.",DD9y38PieYPDdhPwnVDfjg,1,0,4,5blX2JG-3imC5jNyOQwzJg

We arrived at Max Brenner for a relaxing Saturday brunch. Turns out our experience was anything but relaxing. 

Initially, we were seated promptly by the hostess and waited. And waited. And waited. We sat there with our menus with no one taking a drink order. Our waitress shows up and tells us that she'll be right with us. Afterwards she just disappeared on us again. Another long interlude passes.

At this point, I was thinking about chewing on a napkin and wondering if I should just get some water upstairs from the sink in the bathroom. 

Finally she shows up and takes our orders. Water takes forever to come and so does our orders. We stayed at the restaurant for 2 hours... for them to make a plate of eggs, a burger with fries, a waffle and a fried chocolate egg roll. Plus, there's an excessive heat warning outside and they take forever to refill your water glasses (which are surprising tiny - their hug mugs hold about as much liquid). I think in the two hour time span, they got refilled once. May I remind you, this is while you are eating some incredibly rich food.

The real food itself is okay (ie, the burger and the omelette). Nothing earth shattering.

The dessert tasting is both overwhelming in richness, underwhelming in quality.  I think in the end, the dessert tasting really lacked a good editing eye.

Tasting includes: a belgian waffle with syrup, caramelized banana, nuts with choice of ice cream and chocolate ganache; fried chocolate eggroll with Mexican spices ?bananas and peanuts; two different chocolate ""bark""; a bowl of chocolate krispies; a fondue set with strawberries, bananas, and marshmallows (and hibachi for roasting).

The belgian waffle is too overloaded with stuff. First, you have the syrup, nuts and caramelized bananas. Then you drown it in ice cream and chocolate ganache? The waffle at this point is totally lost in the whole process - becoming soggy from all the ingredients. It's just too much.

The fried eggroll was filled with a chile pepper spiced chocolate with banana and peanuts inside. Albeit it was different and interesting, the eggroll became soggy from the chocolate inside.

My husband and I found the two chocolate bars and chocolate covered rice krispies (supposedly malt balls but I didn't taste any malt flavouring) to be too sweet in combination with everything else. The brownies were okay, not great. 

The fondue (dark chocolate, baby!) was alright. We were wondering about the fire hazard we were going to create because flame kept setting our marshmallows on fire.

Honestly, the dessert tasting is okay - would probably share it with 3-4 instead of 2 because it is really too much for two to handle. However, factor in all the other things like crappy service I have to say a 2 star review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,2,2,vYT5rR41Svb2PWxc_hDkwQ

Came here with some friends and we were just looking to get some good dessert eats. I'm a sucker for chocolate and nuts and anything that tastes like Nutella and all that great stuff. Now, Max would've gotten 5 stars if they didn't run out of the Fantastic Posicle Fondue. So, in my moment of disappointment, I listened to the waiter's suggestion and opted for the Hazelnut milkshake instead. Omgahhhhhhhh so good. It's like melted Nutella that's been chilled to milkshake form. 

Side note: I probably should've shared my shake because it was so thick, rich, and yummy that I couldn't even finish half by myself. So yummy!",LaO4FZ2yPbqRjlv6QoaUJQ,3,3,4,pq5oJsH0YPhtZq1f_B-qqA

The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace is medium sized mall filled to the brim with the latest fashions and also is home to several restaurants.

One such restaurant, is Max Brenner's Chocolate by the Bald Man.  This place came highly recommended and so we were excited to give it a try.  As a certifiable chocoholic, I was surprised at myself that I actually almost walked right passed this place.  I suppose my eye was drawn across the hall to the massive, three-story H&M clothing store.  However, my nose did not fail me and my eye quickly followed me back to the sight of Max Brenner's.  The place looks like Willy Wonka and Wolfgang Puck had a brain child.  There is a childlike playfulness to much of the decor but with a crisp and refined edge.  

One glance at the menu and we knew this was going to be a special meal.  Surprisingly, there was a lot of care and detail put into the flavor and presentation of the savory dishes.  I honestly expected these to be a loss, so this was a plus.  The winner and the reason I will return is the dessert.

There are page after page of delectable options.  We settled on the *Sharing fondue and the Crystal Sugar Churros fondue.  Both sets came to the table stylishly displayed, but not at the cost of real chocolate experience.  There were fruits, cakes, churros, other chocolates, and even pieces of waffle to dip into several different flavors of warm molten chocolate placed on the table by the waitstaff.

Service here is excellent.  Most places in Las Vegas are missing this component.  Max Brenner must either pay well, or be a truly enjoyable place to work.  It s a remarkably enjoyable place to sit and enjoy an amazing dessert and people watch.  As you leave Caesar's casino head into the Forum Shops and veer left, trust me your nose will guide you the rest of the way to chocolate bliss.",V6fWM24mP46KwJ5_zpEWNQ,3,2,4,lnCQEAKdAfw2dzFk99VLlQ

How could you not, there is a chocolate shop inside!  Comparable to a Serendipity or Sugar Factory, which are some other fun places we like to take the kids, so we are adding this to the list.

The kids meals are a bit pricey, so more for the fun that you are paying extra for :)  My daughter got the grilled cheese bites which were good, but the best part is that they give the kids little paint brushes for them to paint the ketchup on their sandwiches or fries.  I was sold right there!  

I had the regular brenner burger and my husband the steak quesadillas which were also pretty good.  The fries and dip were the best part in my opinion.  It's the orangy color, thousand island/ranch/chipotle mix.  The menu isn't that big, but again a fun place to go.  The kids got a fun sounding dessert, it was just okay, the chocolate cake was kind of hard.  It was chocolate cake with vanilla ice-cream, whip cream, sprinkles, strawberries and then a vile of caramel and cup of chocolate krispies to throw on.  The kids loved it.

I'm a regular here and have been going since it opened in Caesars Palace. 

Most if not all of their desserts are really good. 

The Italian Thick Hot chocolate (dark chocolate with Vanilla cream; you have a choice of milk or dark). It's pure decadent dark smooth thick goodness...  Mmmmm, warmth and comfort served in a cute hug mug!  (It's like a warm melted fudge beverage)   not only does it warm you up on the inside but warms up your hands as well 

Chocolate Chunks Pizza -order ""the Works."" Topped with melted milk and white chocolate chunks, crunchy hazelnut bits, bananas, peanut butter or roasted marshmallows  marshmallow. All the ingredients compliment each other and yet still showcases the chocolates; the pralines add great texture and crunch, roasted marshmallows are a great gooey addition to each bite!

The Euphoria Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae. ""deep chocolate peanut butter ice cream, dulce de leche ice cream, caramelized toffee bananas, spiced peanuts and pure chocolate chunks topped with whipped cream and crunchy hazelnut bits. served with warm chocolate peanut butter and very pure milk chocolate ganache."" The Warm peanut butter, melted chocolate chunks and the crunch from the hazelnut bits result in a spoonful of excitement and flavor!

And as I've said before, most of their dessert items are awesome, like their waffles (Banana Split Waffle is the best choice), fondues with their own Chocolates (dark or milk), crepes, and so on 

This is definitely a must try!

2289880,2011-01-25,4,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Yum, yum, yum!  I finally made it back here since the CMYE and it's great!  

The drinks were great at the CMYE so we had to try more of them.  My husband had the Dreamsicle ($11.95) and it is excellent.  It tastes just like an alcoholic creamsicle.  It's made with vanilla vodka, Grand Marnier, OJ, and vanilla sauce.  I would try to replicate this at home but I have no clue what vanilla sauce is.

I had the Psychedelic Punch ($11.95) which is rum, triple sec, and a secret exotic juice blend.  Ooooo, secret!  Very tasty and it comes with a side of Chambord and grenadine in a little bottle.  For those who attended the CMYE, it's the same little bottles they served the milk in (no mas leche, Paolo and Allan!).  I'm not quite sure why it's on the side, and it definitely was not one of the ingredients listed for the drink on the menu.  I just poured it all in and drank it down.

For food, we had the B.A.L.T. ($14.50) and the blackened skirt steak and mushroom quesadilla ($14.95).  Both were very, very good.  I agree with Misti on the B.A.L.T. - there's gotta be a whole avocado in there.  The waffle fries that come with the B.A.L.T. are to die for!  Just like Chick-fil-a, but crispy and spicy.  The menu says there is cocoa powder on the fries - I couldn't taste it at all and I don't think I would want to, either.  The only bummer is that they only give you a few waffle fries - like 6 or 7 - with the sandwich.  

The quesadilla has a good spice to it and comes with some extra sauce, once again in the little milk bottles.  The sauce was a little difficult to get out of the tiny milk bottle and almost fell off the plate when the waitress cleared the table.  Those little milk bottles must break all the time.

For dessert, we tried the banana split waffle ($13.95).  This is also very good.  It comes with chocolate krispies (my fav), chocolate ganache, and caramel.  There is supposed to be a vanilla bourbon ice cream on top, but I didn't taste any bourbon.  The waffle is very crispy and yummy.

We also shared a peanut butter chockie ($7.50) which is basically a chocolate and peanut butter shake.  It comes in a cool, Alice in Wonderland inspired glass with metal straws.  My husband got more of this than I did because my straw was defective.  Tasty shake but I'm not sure about the metal straws.

Those tiny little philly cheesesteak sandwiches that we all adored at the CMYE are only available Monday-Friday, according to the menu.  Also, they seem to have free wifi but I couldn't get it to work.  I figured I'd talk to my husband instead of screwing around with my iPod touch so I didn't ask what's up.  But if they get this fixed it'll make my unexpected wifi list.

Great service and they took my Groupon with no problems.  Keep in mind when ordering - the tables are really small and the plates are pretty big.  Not particularly good for trying a variety of items.

Can't wait to come back.  Next time I'm getting a big plate of waffle fries and Euphoria peanut butter chocolate fudge sundae (which my husband vetoed).  Sooo good!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,6,5,5,d4gM0CrRNBpOGrCsuMqg5w
2291767,2010-09-14,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"So, let me start by saying that we just grabbed a slice of the Chocolate Pizza to go. Not much, but we wanted a dessert and figured that a place based entirely around chocolate would be a good choice. 

To continue, the chocolate on the chocolate pizza may be the best chocolate I have ever had. The chocolate pizza has a sweet pizza dough covered with liquid milk and white chocolate. To be honest, I felt like the dough actually took a little bit away from the fantastic chocolate, mostly because the pizza dough isn't very soft. However, the chocolate was so good that it didn't matter. I would like to see a version of the pizza with a traditional, crunchy, thin crust. I can't wait to go back and try the other food, especially a Double Dark Chocolate Cookie. If you just want a sweet chocolatey dessert, I would recommend the Chocolate Syringe, which is a giant syringe filled with warm chocolate that you just squirt into your mouth. At $5.00, its a very reasonable, delicious dessert for the Vegas strip.

As for the service, the person helping us at the little stand outside was extremely friendly. They were able to answer all of our questions and seemed very knowledgable about all the items offered. 

In conclusion, I will be back here when I'm back on the strip and it is definitely going on my list of favorites! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.",df_wr-hXaxeb1b_KCAX3BA,0,0,5,HYpbDjysHGQaD15V7h6sFg

It was natural for me to try the restaurant itself when I visited Vegas.  We were seated immediately by a courteous hostess.

We asked for Alcohol recommendations and he highly recommended the Brazilian Breeze.  We ordered that along w a Mojito and Mediterranean Trio to start. Few min later he came back and we decided to order bunch of appetizers so we can have dessert. 15 min go by and no drinks, food, or sign of our waiter, so we asked another waiter to locate him. Over 5 min pass when he finally showed up with our drinks.  The Brazilian was the worst by far but didn't complain.  The food finally came out and he kept on disappearing again. About an hour and 40 min experience with zero time waiting for a table and 3 appetizers, 2 drinks, and a dessert we decided to go downstairs and pay the bill since we had it for 10 minutes and he still never came back and mind you the restaurant is almost empty considering it was almost 11 PM.  At the gift shop where I spent almost $80 I asked the employee there if we can pay the bill she kindly declined and said she would locate our waiter who later rushed over with who I assume to be the manager because they thought we took off.  All they cared about was the bill, neither one was listening to us complaining how we had to keep waiting for everything including the check.

Yes, the prices seem up there because you think, it's just chocolate.  Let me tell you, it's not JUST chocolate here!  

Honey and I came here thinking they only served desserts.  They actually offer real food!  We were so bummed because we were searching for a place to eat brunch and couldn't find anything appealing.  Next time we are definitely going to check out their non chocolate offerings because not only did everything on the menu sound delish (fancier offerings than your basic breakfast), we witnessed people eating and we were looking at their food with longing.

My $7.50 Mocha Frappe (milk chocolate truffle and espresso shot) was offered in their Alice ""Drink Me"" cup with the metal straw.  The metal straw kept my very thick mocha cold to the last yummy drop.  It wasn't overly sweet so I was able to finish it.  He thought I was going to get sick finishing that and eating a dessert.  I did prove him wrong thank you very much!  Okay, I did feel a bit nauseous later but I would do it all again in a heartbeat.

I ordered the Chocolate Surprise Tiramisu.  The lady fingers were espresso soaked and sitting in extremely thick cognac mascarpone cream.  So thick was the cream that your lady fingers would break in half when you pulled them out.  You had to use a spoon to eat the lady fingers with the cream.  The chocolate truffle surprise was a warm gooey thick chocolate drink in the cutest mini glass pitcher.  I felt like a giant Alice drinking it.

Chocolate overkill?  Yes, yes it was.

Question: What's with the small tables!? I felt like I had to do a balancing act while eating... put my plate on my knee there, put my frappe by the edge of the table and push it with my elbow as I eat to keep it from falling off...

I had the Brenner burger (it was average) and my husband had the Cubano waffle sandwich (he reported it was tasty). The fries were uber tasty. We then got the classic European fondue for two and an Italian hot chocolate. I just loved the hot chocolate - it was so rich and creamy. I'm drooling right now. My husband liked the fondue more so. It came with two choices of chocolate (we did dark and milk) and caramel sauce. Dipping items included a chocolate chip cookie, brownies, bananas, strawberries and marshmallows (along with a little burner to toast them on!). The milk chocolate was way too sweet for me, but I think it helped me self diagnose a possible cavity (ouch!). The dark chocolate was really tasty and overall our favorite fondue sauce. 

Service was pretty good - there was a moment or two we wondered where our server was but overall he kept up with refills and bringing things out quickly.

Let me preface this by saying I'm not a huge chocolate fan. So given that, the fact that I was still blown away by the offerings here - says everything.

On our final night in Vegas, my guy and I ventured in for a late-night dinner and drinks. Located conveniently inside Caesar's Palace (we stayed at Nobu Hotel), this was stumbling distance back to our suite - perfect.

We started with a pair of the signature chocolate martinis. Picture the most perfect milk chocolate ganache, a hefty swig of premium vodka, and a dusting of chocolate powder...all perfectly poured into a sizable martini glass and topped with a ripe, chocolate-dipped strawberry skewer. Pure bliss, I tell you. The smoothness of all ingredients mingled together perfectly. We hardly needed dinner after these babies!

Dinner, however, also did not disappoint. A bacon burger for him, a grilled chicken panini for me - and we were set! The accompanying waffle-cut fries were a great touch. We were officially stuffed and ready to roll out (literally).

But then I saw it: A marshmallow-topped, white chocolate ganache white russian. Yes, I had to have it. It came out with a side of liquid white chocolate ganache which we drizzled into the perfect cocktail to our heart's content. (This drink was also amazing.) 

Key takeaways: Go here for a chocolate martini, even if you aren't a dessert person or a chocolate lover! Stay for some food (you'll need it), then split another beverage or two. If you're a fan of White Russians, do not pass up the opportunity to get one here. 

Regardless of what you choose, you will want to try everything on the menu! On our next visit, I'm hittin' this place up for a chocolate-covered brunch. O.M.G.",LaNXfiMDjMib2NhK4BE7-Q,3,3,5,qnbICttSRVpzS81ocPi-Bw
2404581,2011-03-09,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Max Brenner Knows Chocolate. Definitely

I came here and immediately i was drawn to the menu that told the story of Max Brenner - in all seriousness though, it's probably completely fictional but despite all that, it was a good intro to what I should expect from the steve jobs of chocolate."" Heavenly chocolate"" only scratches the surface. 

if you're going to max brenner, definitely give them the moment to show you their way of experiencing chocolate - sounds completely like their marketing strategy, but believe me, it delivers. i tried their waffles, ice cream and coffee, but this review goes to their hot chocolate.

bottom line: TRY THE SPICY HOT CHOCOLATE

Spicy hot chocolate; best i've ever had. 
they serve it to you in a special cup that they call a ""hug mug"" which is specifically shaped so that while sipping, your nose is drawn close to the chocolate, in order for you to experience the aromas and spices in the drink itself. after each slow sip, you taste almost every spice, every cream, and every blend of chocolate mixed into the drink. Drinking hot chocolate this way brings the experience to a whole new level. 

next time i'm in Caesars palace, or Vegas, I'm definitely stopping by to see what Max Brenner came up with next. 

Know this... If Style from ""the pick-up artist"" were to meet willy wonka, you'd have yourself a place called, Max Brenner.",BM59XraNv5UzzImuJyNE0Q,2,5,5,3EC6zIC2u0Gu2yVmDFuLpA

Can you get a lot of sweet crammed into one dining experience? You absolutely can. Can you pick a dish that's good to share? You bet. Can you also get savory items, if you're so inclined? Apparently, though we did not get a chance to sample anything savory.

We were crazy enough to think, ""Hey - I'm feeling a bit overly stuffed, but wouldn't something sweet be GOOD right about now?"" 

We're masochistic. Or crazy. Or overly-ambitious. Or maybe all three. 

At any rate, we ended up at Max Brenner's cute little establishment kind of late on a Friday night. We got a table for three on the ""patio"" right away, and squabbled over which kind of fondue platter we'd order. I was drawn to one of the ice cream fondue creations (because, really - how can you go wrong with ice cream?) while the other two were listing off the virtues of ordering the fondue for two.

I finally relented, and we ordered the fondue for two (even though we were sharing it amongst the three of us), with dark and milk chocolates. The menu said that the fondue would come with things like tempura bananas, chocolate sponge cake, waffles and choco-pops. In reality, we got banana slices, strawberries, marshmallows and a couple pieces of banana bread, with an extra container of caramel sauce.

I guess they were improvising at that point. 

Everything was delectable, though I wanted to try the waffle pieces. I was surprised by how rich and smooth the chocolate sauces were. You expect the chocolate to be delicious, but everything was so silky and shiny - it was perfectly tempered and so cutely displayed!

Our waiter got extra points for putting up with us, and sharing some of our jokes. It takes a special personality to handle us sometimes, believe me.

I would have liked to have gone back to try the savory items, and maybe give the spicy hot chocolate a go, but the timing didn't work out. It's definitely on my list for our next Vegas visit, though.",-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,1,1,4,faGMS0ocjEQEh8bFQULOQQ

    First of all, the PRESENTATION of the food...beautiful! It was unique and just very pretty and impressive, I almost didn't want to eat it.  The pictures really don't do it any justice.  The plate comes with little dishes filled with sauces, like chocolate or other sweet sauces/butterscoth? on the side.  I like this because you can add sweetness to taste.  The bananas that came with my crepe were also served individually.  I saw other people's dishes, like their burgers, the presentations are appetizing, I wanted to taste everything on the menu. 
    Had the hot chocolate with a shot of Bailey's: ....mmmm...it was a tad sweet, I believe b/c of the Bailey's, but was good.  
   The next day I was craving it and came back for some more.  This time, I ordered the choclate crepe with hazelnut, toffee and banana...woah was it awesome! The icecream had a nice little bunch of crispy nuts covered in this spicy curry-ish? sort of spice on it, it  totally caught me off guard, it was like wait,what was that? huh? awesome!  The crepe had all kinds of textures to it, soft, crispy, fluffy at the same time.  High quality chocolate.
     I also tried their chocolate oatmeal, delicious, the best oatmeal I've ever tasted.  
      Their coffee was really good, kind of tasted a little bit like Mexican Cafe de Olla.  
      The portions are large, their dishes are meant to be shared. I think you could share a crepe among 3 people with normal appetites.  The oatmeal you can probably share among 2.  The dishes are simply too rich to have large portions, you'll definately feel fatter after eating this, but well worth it.  
      I think that their awesome customer service is worth mentioning, both times I went there all of the workers were super helpful and nice, I really appreciated the unpretentiousness.  The only problem was that the girls in the merchandise area weren't very knowledgable about prices for merchendise, and prices weren't on all of the merchendise    I bought some mugs to bring home as souveniers, even though I don't think that the cute ""hug mugs"" serve their purpose so well - if you try to ""hug"" it, it will burn the F*@** outta your hands, so let your chocolate cool before you hug it.   
              The place is very clean, nostalgic, and romantic.  Reminds me a little bit of disneyland.  Would definately come back. Great place for a date first date.
      Just to compare, I also visited the famous Jean Phillipe pastry place at the Bellagio, hands down M. Brenner is better.

I've been to Max Brenner so many times now. It's the best place for friends to gather around over some BOMB  dessert. It never gets TOO crowded, and the restaurant is pretty big. They always seem to be able to accommodate our party regardless of the time and size.

Things I've tried
1. Creamy Parmesan Risotto: Pretty good, HUGE dish (definitely share-able), but nothing super special about it.

2. Black Sesame salmon: Good sesame flavor, tender salmon. Pretty tasty, nice presentation.

3. Chubby Smoked Turkey Club: Nothing too special. I've had better club sandwiches. Served with waffle fries dusted with cocoa powder. Meh. Didn't taste any of the cocoa. Did not taste as exciting as it sounded. 

4. The Fantastic Popsicle Chocolate Fondue: So much fun! You get 1 or 2 vanilla ice cream bars that you can dip in chocolate sauce and all sorts of fun toppings. Very tasty too!

5. Suckao ""do-it-yourself"" Hot Chocolate: Another super fun Max Brenner concoction. You're giving some warm milk over a small flame and a bunch of chocolate. You add  as much chocolate as you want into the milk. Fun drink, but not as tasty as the regular Hot chocolate. I love the 'hug mug' that the Hot Cocoa is served in. You can buy your own in the gift shop!

6. Hazelnut cream chocolate milkshake: Tastes like frozen Nutella. NOMS Much tastier than the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity's and cheaper too! Again, served in a really adorable cup that can be purchased in the gift shop.

When I came here I knew I had to have both savory and sweet to satisfy my cravings. After all, I'm not in Vegas too often. 

For the savory, I ordered the chicken and goat cheese salad. The salad came with balsamic vinaigrette and was topped on a huge waffle.  The chicken and salad was decent, and the waffle was definitely a nice touch.

For the sweet I ordered the banana split waffles. It came with crunchy caramelized rice crispy bits. Bananas were chocolatey and sweet. I would say the fruit itself was sweeter and stronger than the added chocolate and caramel, if the makes sense. This is a good thing. It means the dish isn't too sweet for most people.

Of course, I was unable to finish the meal even with added help on the banana split waffles. This was essentially both my lunch and dinner.

I also couldn't resist ordering an original hot chocolate with white chocolate. It was a bit too thick for me. Good thing it was comparably a small size to the other drinks. I couldn't take too much of it, but it was good.

We had an informative friendly server. Nothing like good service at a restaurant. Makes you feel welcome and at home.

Overall, I would say the food is decent, but all the chocolatey choices definitely make it a unique restaurant that I will definitely return to next time. I still have to try the chocolate pizza's and fondue.",O5Dh496HSFj9UW32CqDkfw,0,0,4,Toq5HoW6OHFCaCarbwp7XQ

The happy hour list has been cut down to fewer offerings than on my last review but still has 6 cocktails plus select beer ($4) and wine on special.  3 of the cocktails are chocolatey so there are even more options as you can choose white, milk, or dark chocolate options.  The snacks are great and enough to share if you aren't starving or have a crazy sweet tooth.  We got the 80s shake from the regular menu and 3 cocktails, the smoky corn croquettes which were good but the smoked paprika ruined my chocolate palette, the cheese pizza which was bigger than expected, and the trout banana fondue.  So 6 happy hour things and 1 of the ref menu for $43.  I only come here for happy hour because I'm cheap.  Staff was really attentive and even let us have happy hour at a table instead of the barrio since it was busy.  We usually have our teen sit at a 2 top close by and we sit at the bar and carry good back and forth.  He's happy becauSe he's eating amazingly chocolatey goodness without his mom and I'm happy because he's stuffing his face for cheap.  Growing boys and all that.  My bf and I still get time to ourselves, also with awesome sweets, and for a pretty penny.  The best part is that once you Re hopped up on sugar, you can go to the 3 story h&m across the way and get even more deals with the money you saved!

Once again, there was nothing wrong with the food, other than it being overpriced for average quality. I ordered the panini because I was eager to try the waffle fries sprinkled with cocoa and chili powder; once again, the fries were fine - but I failed to notice anything  special about them. 
The  reason we went to Brenner's was for the hot chocolate. We tasted all around the Italian w/ dark chocolate, the whipped chocolate (also the dark chocolate), the white chocolate and the Melting Marshmallow with dark chocolate. The favorite was the Melting Marshmallow, the least favorite was the white chocolate. I tasted each with the exception of the whipped chocolate. I would gladly order any of the dark chocolate drinks again; I am a sucker for thick hot chocolate and the Italian was exactly that; albeit a little sweeter than I prefer. For my buck the best flavor was the Melting Marshmallow. The two who ordered the white chocolate were sorry they had done so.
The service was poor as the waitress would disappear for long stretches. We ordered the hot chocolate before the meal (we didn't want to take the chance that we wouldn't have room for hot chocolate). We ordered the meal and 20 minutes later the food arrived and we had to ask for water glasses. I had ordered a soft drink with my meal, and it never came. We had a party of four, plus two infants who shared with us and an 18% gratuity was added. I have many friends who have worked in service industries and I have learned from them the importance of tips and I am typically a modestly generous tipper - I would not have given this waitress 18%.",JPOj_4fUrBGivGrfOLk5Yw,0,0,3,fZ3bsEetfUaqZpHii8Ku3g

2650875,2013-06-07,1,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Max Brenners is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace and we visited it on the first night of our annual Vegas vacation. We had 6pm reservations and even though we were almost a half hour early the hostess was happy to seat us.  The first thing you notice here is the smell of melting chocolate throughout the dining room.  There is nothing wrong at all with that. Most of the drinks and at least half of the food at Max's has a chocolate component to it. With that in mind Simone and I started the meal with two of the most amazing Drinks I may have ever had. My drink was the Berry Nutty Professor, a quirky drink take on the Classic PBJ sandwich, consisting of Peanut Liquor, Frangelico, Chombroid and Milk Chocolate. It was smooth, sweet and creamy and unbelievably good. Not to be outdone by my drink, Simone ordered a Satisfaction Guaranteed and it was completely satisfying. Peanut Liquor, Caramel Liquor and Milk Chocolate, served in a glass on a bed of crushed Ice with a flask refill on the side. Even though my drink was amazing, I still couldn't help but steal some sips of hers. For our food we started with White Corn Croquettes. Spicy seasoned sweet white corn kernel's are mixed with creamy Manchego cheese and coated with Panko Breadcrumbs then lightly fried to a perfect crispiness. They did not come with a dipping sauce and they did not need it as they were great all by themselves. Next we split in order of Mac and Cheese and at the suggestion of our waiter we added grilled chicken to it. Although not my favorite of all time ( that honor belongs to Yardhouse) it was definitely one of the better ones I have had. Tomato Bruschetta and Bacon is combined with a 5 cheese blend and grilled chicken then baked with a light bread topping. This was smoky flavored with a bit of sweetness due to the tomato. It was not as creamy and rich as expected with five cheeses but it was still overall very flavorful and delish. It came with a side of marinara that I thought was a bit pointless but I gave it a try on top of the Mac and Cheese and it wasn't to bad but also didn't really add anything to the dish. Last up was dessert and of course we had to have something with chocolate. We choose what sounded like the most satisfyingly decadent choice on the menu. A Chocolate Chunk dessert Pizza with the works ( marshmallows, peanut butter, chocolate, banana's, and hazelnut nibs). Unfortunately it was not as yummy as I dreamed it might be. The dough was not a crispy pizza dough but some strange spongy pita bread wannabe. The chocolate itself was lost in the dish with all the other toppings. This was actually a surprising disappointment to end our meal. For a place known for chocolate I was expecting so much more.  Overall the meal was very good and the drinks exceptional but the dessert disappointed me leaving me no choice but to give three stars to Max Brenners.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,2,2,3,hjpufsRguM-qEMLj70K5Wg

I must have pass by this place a million times in the Forum Shops but never ventured inside for a taste. We wanted a late snack after a long day of shopping ending at Caesar's, so this was the perfect time to give it a try.

The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The service was quite exceptional, very quick and she came by just enough times to check up on us without the sense of harassing. Needless to say, I gave her a deserving big tip.

We ordered the following:
1. Tutti Frutti Waffles
-it was covered generously with strawberries and milk chocolate granache with vanilla crumbled ice cream
2. Baja fish tacos
-corn tortillas stuffed with fish and mango slaw, served with rice and beans.

I love both dishes. The fish tacos were very refreshing with the mango. I didn't really like the side of plain white rice, it could had easily been replaced by a salad or some Spanish style rice would be more appropriate.

I'm coming back here to try the Chocolate cheesecake crepe and hot chocolates next time. One can only handle so much decadent food on a weekend trip to Vegas. This is one time I wish my stomach could hold more food.

Kudos to the bald dude!",jVyR4PSFQDAmXpzDZmnBlg,10,8,4,0rcxRq9IRz6zcFdlGW33qQ

2811895,2013-07-22,9,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Dear Mr Brenner,

I just wanted to let you know that ever since I took my wife to your fine establishment, all she could talk about was your desserts!

Let me explain. Some friends of ours told us about your happy hour specials. So we went on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. Once we got to the bar and saw our choices on the happy hour menu, we couldn't make up our minds. We loved the fact that some of the appetizers and desserts are only 6 bucks. Since it was our first time, we decided that a couple hundred more trips should be able to allow us to experience every one of your creations.

I decided to go with the Max Brenner Sliders while my wife went for the Philly Sliders. For dessert, we decided to share the S'mores Concoction. 

We were a bit hungry so we were thinking of ordering some more food after we put our order in. But when our two orders got there, we didn't have to because these ""appetizers"" that we supposedly ordered were pretty much meals by themselves! Both sliders were scrumptious and filling. 

As for the S'mores Concoction, two words came to mind after tasting it. Rich and Decadent. It's comparable to a person just trying out drugs for the first time and is curious about other drugs. Well, I can say this dessert is the gateway to all the other desserts on your menu! So if you have a sweet tooth, you just might overdose here.

So ever since we were there the first time, we have been back several times, even bringing other friends and family with us. If we don't have kids with us, we hit up your 3 to 6 pm or 9 pm to close happy hours at your bar because you have to be 21 and older. 

So in closing, maybe you should have a chocolate lovers stamp card or something because I know for sure we would have filled up about 2 of them.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,9,8,4,nAx_bMGQQWG4rplb0cvGMQ
2829829,2011-07-17,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Came here for brunch while visiting Vegas. The atmosphere was simple yet, modern and sophisticated and the service was spot on. 
Being that I had heard so much about Max Brenner, I felt it was my duty to try some of his famous hot chocolate. So I decided on the Mexican hot chocolate having never had Mexican HC before. I loved it! It had a unique but delicious flavor with a slight kick at the end from the cayenne pepper. For my meal, I decided on something less sweet: The Rosen Deli smoked turkey crepe. It was an egg crepe with swiss cheese, turkey and mushroom inside with a salad on top that consisted of greens, bell peppers and mandarin oranges. The crepe would have been salty if it were not for that salad on top. It was also accompanied by some potato wedges that were seasoned with of all things, cocoa powder and other spices. They were very good. It was a tasty meal but after trying the Cinnamon apple pecan and white chocolate truffle french toast my friend had ordered, I was wishing I had ordered something sweet for my brunch. The french toast was amazing, by far one of the best french toasts I have ever eaten. Lucky for me that my friend only ate half and left me with the remainder. After brunch, we decided to look around at all the chocolates. We were given samples of the chocolate covered pecans which were delicious and I purchased a couple of chocolates to eat while wandering around Ceasars: The toasted coconut and a chocolate with whiskey in it. Both were very good although pricey. I did manage to find a good buy though. It came with two hug mugs (mugs specially designed to hug with your hands when drinking hot chocolate so your hands get warm, two saucers and a tin of hot chocolate all for 25.00. I thought it was not a bad price so I purchased it and plan on making that hot chocolate soon once I am done with the first few phases of my diet. So if you are in Vegas and looking for a decent Brunch, Max Brenner is a great place! Just make sure you order all sweets when you go.

Located inside Cesar's Palace, near Spago and Guess.  Faves and I were both intrigued by this place due to the name of the restaurant and the similarity of it.  Max ""chocolate by the bald guy""..just took off the last name.  Pretty crazy.  

We came in close to 7 or 8pm and there werent many people in there and I dont know why.  This is such a good place!  We ordered the smoke rub chicken wings, bacon-cheddar-chicken rolls and mac & cheese. I would tell you how they were individually but I would max out the 5k character limit on my review.  Definetely have to try them out, really good quality food!  

Drinks: I ordered the satisfaction guaranteed aphrodisiac chocolate drink which was spectacular and faves order a berry something chocolate drink which was also great as well.  For dessert, we settled for the fried bananas and asked for both the dark and milk chocolate dippings sauces which also came with a toffee dipping sauce as well.  So damn good!!

Its one of those types of things where you try once and it tastes okay but it wouldn't be enjoyable if it were something you had to eat the whole meal.

After the main course we had ordered the main fondue for two, once again, it felt like forever. The strawberries we delicious, but the rest of the samplers weren't really worth it. Especially not the waffle and there was hardly enough chocolate. Definitely not worth the price.

2868505,2011-09-12,2,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"We've only been here 2 times and already the bartender remembered us.  My girlfriend and I stopped by for some late night Happy Hour prior to catching a show at the Cosmo.  The trip to Max Brenner sucked since we were walking there from the Cosmo in uncomfortable shoes... I knew I should've worn some Adidas!  When we got there, the place was packed!  Not a surprise, since it was happy hour.  We had to sit at the very end of the bar, which wasn't very comfortable.  The server was really attentive though.  The moment the group of girls on our left side exited, she cleaned off the bar top for us and had us scoot down so we could be more comfy.  

Pros:
 * Super cheap happy hour.  $5.00 drinks and if its not on the menu, they can make it for you (as long as they have the alcohol.. .which they probably do).

 * Waffle Fries !!!!
 * Attentive service and very nice ambiance
 * Flat screens at the bar and is usually on Sports Channels for all you sport fans.
 * They have a little Chocolate shop next to the bar. 

Cons:
 * located inside Caesar's, which can actually be a plus (shopping and food in one stop), but when you are coming strictly for Brenner's, you have to find a parking spot and walk through the casino, etc. to get there.  Good thing we just walked this time.
 * Food portions are pretty small, but surprisingly filling... It's gotta be the alcohol!

* We didn't try it this time, but we did our first visit: Banana Tempura Fondue.  It sounds good right?  I was thinking something along the lines of a deep fried ice cream (like you can get at some Japanese Restaurants), but that was not the case.  The Banana itself was all mushy.  My gf and I are pretty daring with food and the textures of food doesn't bother us much, but this one was just a no-go!  It tasted like mush doused with sugar.  I liked the idea and am a fan of Bananas, Tempura, and Fondue.  This particular menu though is an epic fail.
  The sliders are amazing.  You get 2 sliders per order and comes with some waffle fries, which are basically crisscut fries.  You can get a pretty good buzz going and satisfy your late night cravings for a pretty decent price at Max Brenner's.  It's hard to find a decent happy hour on the strip.  This is definitely one of my favorite Las Vegas Strip Happy Hours!

Tips:
 * Ask for a side of Chocolate Ranch for your fries and sliders!  Bomb!
 * Don't be shy to ask the Bartender about the different drinks they offer.  Also ask them for recommendations.  They are super friendly and helpful when it comes to that.
 * Say no to Drugs and Banana Tempura Fondue-due
 * Be adventurous when it comes to your alcohol here.. they have lots to offer.  i'd share some of my favorites with you, but honestly I can't remember the names LOL
 * come with a pen in hand.  Why you ask.. Because the napkins are graced with doodle of Max Brenner's head.  During out wait my girlfriend had a genius idea to draw on him.  The drawing we came up with were hilarious!!  She's so fun !!!!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,1,1,5,EdP0BtwDwv2b8Noi4ixHGg

Get the chocolate drinks--they're unreal. The Satisfaction Guaranteed was probably the best alcoholic beverage I've ever had in my life, it tasted like chocolate-peanut butter milk.

Towards the end the sugar will catch up to you but it wasn't overwhelming. You definitely leave feeling more satisfied rather than simply sugar-rushed.

FOOD - 3.5/5

Mac & Cheese
This was served in a large skillet and had a side of tomato/marinara sauce and diced tomatoes. Although there were five different types of cheeses, I didn't find the cheese to be anything special like when I order truffle mac & cheese at places like Pop Champagne or Elbows Mac & Cheese in the LA area. 

Turkey & Gruyere Waffle Sandwich 
It was my first time tasting a sandwich with waffle as the type of bread. I kind of wish that the waffle was crispy rather than on the soft side. The gruyere (cheese) was cut in thick slices and paired with apple, which complimented the sandwich well! 

DESSERT - 4/5

They ran out of the melting chocolate truffle heart cake, their signature dish! We were kind of disappointed!

The hazelnut milkshake made up for it though! I've never had a milkshake that had the perfect balance of smooth, creamy, and icy goodness until this trip!

I truly love their enormous chocolate chip cookies. I've ordered their food several times to-go when I worked at forum and I've also sat down to eat but only when the wait was a little long at cheesecake factory. Their food is alright, very basic but I do like their waffle fries. The seating area is a little small, make reservations if you're coming as a group. I would recommend coming here only for their deserts and sweets, not so much their food.",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,2,2,4,GVcY8XSjFswVlVgpMo-LZg

Went here for LUNCH for Restaurant Week.... 

Made reservations and was promptly seated.  The table was a bit on the small side but I think maybe this adds to the ambiance... upscale, coffee/hot chocolate shop.... that just happens to serve full meals.

Service: excellent
The gal was really nice and fun to talk to ... there were also several other people serving us too so it was ""full service"".

Food: excellent

What we ordered:

APPS
-  Pita with eggplant dip and roasted red pepper.... the eggplant dip had a sweetness to it that we were not expecting ... really complemented the warm savory perfectly seasoned pita slices.  The BEST pita slices ever!
-  Bacon, Chicken, Cheese rolls... these are not ""rolls"" in the bread sense... these are savory, meaty, yumminess.... bacon rolled around chicken in a light cheese sauce
-  SW Caesar salad.... lots of ripe chunks of avocados!  a little too much dressing though... but the avocados

MAIN
- Brenner Burger.... JUICY AWESOME-NESS! It's served Medium... and it comes out perfect!  The bun is fantastic too.... not too bready and not hard or dense... soft and fluffy. I took home 1/2 home so I could enjoy it again tomorrow.
-  Spicy Tuna sandwich... this is NOT your typical tuna sandwich... this is meaty and has a nice flavor with a bit of heat... the pickled jalapenos in the sandwich are oddly good. 

DESSERT:
-  the chocolate pizza with hazelnuts and peanut butter.... the pizza crust is a bit on the 'heavy' / 'thick' bread-y side.... I would prefer this to be a bit thinner.... other than that... this is a sweet, chocolate-y dessert... it is a decadent dessert.... that would go really well with coffee or a glass of milk
-  tempura banana fondue.... i like bananas and this was perfect... not greasy, not heavy... light and sweet but not overly sugary... and a really nice way to end a really great lunch

BEVERAGES:
They have some fantastic adult libations on the menu... however because it was lunch time... we stuck to Peach iced tea which is really refreshing.... and I don't like Peach.  
The only drawback is that the Peach iced tea does NOT come with refills.  But the regular iced tea does... so I got the Peach iced tea to start and then had it refilled with regular.

Menu: excellent
The RW menu was a good indicator of what this place offers.
Now, I want to go back and try more.

The Store:
Lots of great gift ideas and Lots of yummy chocolate options... all different kinds of chocolate...dark, milk, white... with all kinds of different add-ins... plus milkshake and hot chocolate mixes.  
If you have a choco-holic that you need to find a gift for... this place has a plethora of unique and fabulous options.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,0,4,H4s7_tOlpbyq1POQ-abmww

I'm gonna start this review with the BEST thing about this restaurant which is our waiter for the night. I didn't get his name, but he was so friendly towards our party and even gave me a birthday treat as a surprise! He was funny, nice, and didn't have a problem with us teenagers being loud. He was the best. 

Okay, now the food. I shared an oven roasted tomato pizza with my friend for $14 and it wasn't appetizing. The bread was super thin and it looked like it was drenched in tomato sauce and a couple of slices of cheese here and there. It didn't taste like a pizza, more like crackers with tomatoes. I could make it with a freaking easy bake oven. 

I also got the fondue for two, I think it was the one with the most items in it. The dessert platter came with a bunch of fruits, marshmallows, banana tempura, cookies, brownies, a chocolate shot, and the fondue. It was all really good in my opinion! Fun to play with and it all tasted yummy as well! My only problem was that it was $25 and I just think that it can be a bit cheaper. I guess I should've known the food here would be expensive considering the fact that it's on the strip.",2Z29fLaeLtGnNroTuHyJ2A,0,0,3,jKU6K2UJYILrQ3tECZZ9tg

That pretty much sums it up for me.  I'm a fan of this restaurant/cafe and hope to come back for more.  Not only is the ambiance fun, but the food choices are excellent and the whole place explodes of chocolate.  From chocolate cocktails to cocoa dusted waffle fries, Max Brenner covers everything with a bit of sweet satisfaction.  For the Forums this place is reasonably priced and all dishes can easily be shared by two people if you have a small appetite.

I truly enjoyed the eating their appetizer of fried pita with bobba..something..and their spice rubbed wings were awesome.  I had the classic burger with waffle fries--huge, juicy, and yummy--and my husband had the fish sandwhich, which consisisted of fried salmon and not fried white fish.  It was a great twist and was interesting to eat (although I don't like salmon at all).  We had a hazelnut cream shake that came in a cool glass (I bought one on my way out), and their vanilla popsicle fondue for dessert was fun and just the right size.

If you're looking for a chocolate experience that's fresh in town, try out Max Brenner.  It's a great place for chocolate, food, and overall fun.

3027678,2014-01-12,38,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... ""I had you at chocolate.""

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for ""yum.""

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.",AbMjnKOwg736fcIu8apuyQ,38,35,4,86wVmc1lKsB_Td15SpaC6w

I love this place. One of my favorites and I was so excited to hear that they were opening one here. I took my mother here for her birthday because she can never get enough chocolate. you could probably put an IV of chocolate in her bloodstream and she wouldn't fight you on it. ever! Everything is good here from the food to the chocolate desserts to the drinks. My mother is not a drinker, but the guy that seated us overheard us singing her happy birthday and brought us all out a berry shot. I wish I knew the name because everyone at my table loved it. (including my non-lush of a mother.) I also shared the satisfaction guaranteed drink with her which she sipped up as it tasted just like hot chocolate. you couldn't even taste the liquor in it. YUM! We shared a peanut butter sundae that everyone went to town on. I highly recommended trying it one evening. My dad and friend shared a chocolate beer trying to give something new a chance. They do not recommend it. Something about it did not catch their fancy, but everything else was super. I am counting down the days until my anniversary later this month, with the boyfriend, so I can take him to experience his first fondue. (i know it will win him over fast!) I took him to a yelp event here last week and max brenner won over his heart with their delicious food (mini pulled pork sliders, philly cheese steak sliders complete with cheesewiz, max brenner cheeseburger sliders, pomegranate cosmos, giant pillow like chocolate chip cookies and brownies, banana split waffles, everything mouth watering.) you can see my previous review on it with CMYE. I also think everyone should try the brunch there on the weekend. if it is anything like the new york one you are in for a treat. it is excellent and you wouldn't even think so since they are known for their desserts.

It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating. Our server was super nice and very kid friendly.  

The presentation of each entree was truly impressive, especially their latest addition of their waffle salad where the salad comes in a tin and then you essentially toss it by pouring it and the dressing onto the waffle. The kiddo ordered the chicken fingers from the kids menu which came with their waffle fries (yummy) and a little basting brush so you can glaze the chicken w BBQ or ketchup yourself. Super cute. I shared the turkey waffle sandwich which unfortunately did not come w the waffle fries but instead a cucumber sunomo type salad which was also good and very filling. 

FYI, the spicy tuna sandwich pics you see on here look yummy but have been removed from their menu. Same with their other fish dishes, so stick with the turkey and chicken items to be safe.

3042994,2011-12-07,3,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"$5 for a chocolate chip walnut cookie? Pretty darned steep for 'just a cookie'. But oh hot damn, it's not 'just a cookie'. It's probably downright 'THE BEST COOKIE' I've ever had. That badboy was loaded with chunks and chunks and moutainous chunks of quality chocolate, along with very delicious crumbles of walnut, strewn strategically throughout the cookie.

The dough itself was a perfect vehicle in presenting the wonderful ingredients. SO DELICIOUS. Not too hard, not too soft, not too buttery, and not too dry. This cookie was absolutely amazeballs. But I think I'd only be able to handle one because I'd implode with food amazement. 

Ken C and I stopped by the morning after my marathon and we wanted something to ready ourselves for the buffet we would later have. We both ordered hot chocolates at the bar, Italian style. He got milk chocolate, I got dark. 

Sooooooooooooper smooth chocolate, so rich and so fine, I was about to die. My stomach was not able to comprehend how there could be so fine a warm liquid that would coat it with such creamy smoothness. At $7 a cup, it seemed pretty harsh, but it was so kind on the way down. OH SO GOOD! Nice touch with the 'hug mug' as well. cute concept and clever way to enjoy such a lovely concoction.

We didn't order anything else, but I'd be willing to give the chocolate pizza a shot the next time I visit.

There was a wonderful display of chocolates also in the shop that you could purchase as gifts or snacks for yourself at a later time. These items are not cheap by any means, but you're essentially buying the best stuff around.

Located in the Forum shops in Caesars, Max Brenner was kind of difficult to get to, especially the day after running a marathon. But boy was it worth it.

My wife is a Yelp Elite member, in which she was invited to attend a Yelp gathering at Max Brenner and wanted me to be her guest.  At first I had my doubts, cause I was suppose to be in bed, due to working the graveyard shift.  But, I promised her I would go, and try out something new.  I'm glad I did.  

Max Brenner, located at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, is a chocolate filled extravaganza.  Its a good size place to eat, a good place to sit at the bar, or to walk by and get a snack.  It also has a second story, where you can have gatherings of any sort and I believe any size.  Well, according to Jocelyn, the sales & banquet manager, the upstairs gathering place, can fit up to 50, but with the Yelp Elite gathering, it was filled up with about 200 people.  So I'm sure they can probably reserve the place for more then 50 people.  

Now, being there, has to be a nice feeling.  Not only for the fact that its a Yelp Elite gathering, but the Staff of Max Brenner made it special.  We had snacks, that were absolutely delicious, and loved the Chocolate Martini.  I felt overwhelmed with one of their waitress, Misti.  She made sure I had something to drink and went out of her way to make sure I had a drink.  Also it was great to meet Jocelyn, who was nice to come around and talk to us.  Despite how busy that night was, I was really impress with the service, the food and how friendly everyone was.

Dessert: the make your own chocolate pop is delicious but that tiny thing for $8? Crap...
The Banana Split Waffle was amazing! Although the waffle was more dense instead of fluffy and crunchy how I like it, it was top notch
The one thing about these dishes that put it over the top? The chocolate sauce! My god that this is euphoric like I haven't had chocolate in years kind.

It is one cool place to visit that's for sure and the chocolate gift shop is pretty awesome...especially those chocolate syringes :P The vegas location isn't as big as the NY one, but still a pretty restaurant, which isn't surprising because it is in the Caesar forum shops. To be honest, I like chocolate, but an excessive amount of chocolate just seems a little to saccharine for me. And that's kind of what it feels like in Max Brenner's. Like you're Augustus Gloop drowning in Mr. Wonka's chocolate river.

So we tried the famous ""Chocolate pizza"" that this place is known for. And it really wasn't anything too special. The crust was kinda...meh. Like the edges of a pop tart that no one really likes to eat because it's so bland. That's what I thought the crust tasted like. We got the works, which is every thing on top...so marshmallows, chocolate, peanut butter, drizzled caramel...basically ingredients of your favorite chocolate bars laid out on a pop tart crust for you to cavitate your teeth and be your dentist's dream come true. And it was just okay...I felt like I could have made that at home if I really wanted to. Key word = if. 

What was partially redeeming were the banana split waffles. This was actually pretty delicious and it even came with a cute little mini beaker/flask of chocolate syrup to drizzle to your delight over caramelized bananas atop vanilla ice cream and mini waffles. Plus a little bowl of those crunchy rice krispy-like chocolate balls. Mm...this was sweet but balanced well with the bananas and vanilla ice cream. 

One of my friends also got a burger which actually looked quite delicious. (He attests to this) we munch on some of his waffle fries which were also good...and hey, if you did want to grab a bite of real food and not diabetes, you could still try their menu for other food! The server was really nice and overall, it was still a fun experience. I probably would come back for the banana split waffles (to split with friends of course) but everything else on the menu seemed just a little too chocolate-y for me.

I knew my mom would love it here because she is a total chocoholic! My mom, grandma and I shared the tasting plate, which is loaded with all different types of chocolate goodies. I knew we were in trouble when the waiter came by and started pushing our glasses and utensils out of the way to clear room for the plate! It ended up being 2 plates, the first with mini cake bites, egg roll, waffles, chocolate bark, and wafer balls and the second with fondue including a burner for toasting marshmallows. And all of this was supposedly for 2 people!!

My favorite of the bunch had to be the banana split waffle. The waffle was so crisp and the bananas were perfectly caramelized. The egg roll was also interesting because it tasted Chinese-y... I think it had 5 spice powder in it? Of course, I had to order a glass of milk and it came in the absolute cutest cup ever with a straw holder. And how convenient that they sold these cups in the shop because you know I had to get one.

I was surprised by how many people were eating the ""regular"" food here. I'm curious to try some of their non-dessert dishes, but the desserts are definitely the star.

First two experiences here back in July was absolutely amazing. Just could not believe how perfect the ""cookieshake"" was, especially with the addition of an espresso shot. Its like I found ""liquid nirvana"". It's one of those things you know you have to come back for. Definitely worth 4 stars (leaning 5 stars) - food was great, service staff wonderful, and the shake made this a two visit deal that weekend.

So of course, this past weekend, I made another trip to Vegas for a volleyball tournament and had been looking forward to Max Brenner for about 2 weeks. I even kept on telling people what I really wanted to do this entire trip (besides win of course). The ""cookieshake"" seemed all too certain since it's what everyone had agreed to do - because of me, aka ""the fatty"".

So on Saturday evening, after overstuffing ourselves at a local AYCE sushi (way off the strip), we trekked over the The Forum Shops to meet up. Excitement level = ASIAN. Yes, it was late, but they didn't close yet so it was nice to have dessert after a crazy meal.

After sitting down, the waitress wearing nerdy glasses ""informed"" us that ALL THEIR BLENDERS WERE BROKEN. I pleaded, ""Are you sure? I came all the way from out of town looking forward to the 'cookieshake'!"" As if sounding ""sincere"" she said ""yeah, I feel bad"" and tried to offer something else on the menu. Then she redirected her attention to another person in my group as if trying to help me out would be too much of a hassle.

C'MON!!!

Then.......I see, at a far far table............... the signature ""Alice"" cocktail cup in front of a couple still finishing up their late meal.

Wow... I had no words. I was so upset I didn't even order anything. How's that for awful? First you're denying a ""fatty"" like me the sole reason why I even came to this restaurant in the first place by saying that ALL the blenders were ""broken"". Then the waitress didn't sound sincere enough to pass the test and convince me to order something else. Then, with my 20/20 vision I see the popular cup (obviously filled with something blended) sitting in front of a couple who is enjoying their meal at a table underneath the staircase. I even took a picture to prove to myself I wasn't seeing things.

This trip should have solidified my long-endured craving and my urge to give a stellar review. Instead, my experience here this past weekend left me wondering if I would even return or recommend to others to come anymore. It's been two days and I'm still upset. Maybe because something like this has never happened to me before. What a complete turnaround.",9dPsSoY81dw8H0sIUNNE0w,2,0,1,B0N0Fqlttl_c381TS4TNBQ

Upon arrival, we asked the hostess if happy hour was only available at the bar, or if we could sit down at a table.  To her credit, she told us it was her first day, and she didn't want to give us the wrong information.  So she went and quickly collected the answer to our question and came back.  Happy hour was at the bar only.  No problem.

First, we started with a couple drinks.  My pregnant wife got a frozen lemonade, while I tried the Classic Chocolate Martini ($12.50 normally, $6 on happy hour).  Both were outstanding!  I decided I should try something else, so I went with the Intoxi-Cake with white chocolate, also quite good.  

We ordered some sliders and chicken tenders to start off the food, and while my wife thought some of the food items were infused with chocolate, I couldn't taste it  (She, of course, could have been misinformed).  We then ordered the Cheesy, crunchy mac and cheese which had tomato and bacon.  Ooh, it was excellent, although I was getting so full I couldn't finish it.  

My wife needed to have her dessert, so we got the banana tempura with dipping chocolate.  I couldn't have any because I thought I would explode, but she loved them and I tried them later at home and, even cold, they were delicious!

We had a 3-year old Groupon that had expired, but I knew it was good for the amount I had paid for it.  Since they didn't really have a way to honor the Groupon in their system, they just took enough items off the bill to equal the amount I'd paid for the Groupon. 

The service at the bar was excellent, and the food (especially the chocolate items) was everything I hoped it would be.  They even offered us a chocolate sample on the way out!

Will I go back tomorrow?  No.  But anytime I have friends/family in town and they are looking for something unique and sweet, Max Brenner's will be my recommendation!",0-dEwtOpGdh7B8Jozm7FQQ,1,1,4,f5G-n3lVvk_TYNVGuZBGVA

We started off the evening with the white corn croquettes, black and tan onion rings, and the grilled asparagus crepe.  The croquettes were crispy on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside.  It was a wonderful contrast.  The onion rings were tasty, but not really anything special.  On paper, they sounded interesting and unique (black and tan beer battered vidalia onion rings with a chocolate ranch dressing), but in the end, they were just onion rings, albeit pretty good ones.  The crepe was rich and cheesy, and big enough to share.

We didn't save room for dessert, but not to worry, because we'd already planned to return for it later.  The dessert menu looked fabulous, but since we were Max Brenner virgins, we decided to go with the Tasting for Two.

The decor is lovely with the deep brown woods and whimsical artwork literally making me feel as if I am truly in a chocolate factory. But, even if you are not a chocolate fanatic like myself everything else I tasted made me want more. I know you want to hear about the food:

For food I had the pleasure of making out with the Pulled Pork Slider that had a citrus slaw and fried pickle on top of the perfectly tender bbq pork which was served on a lightly toasted brioche bun. To die for my friends! Next was the Philly Cheesesteak Slider. The meat was very tender and had a nice flavor as well. Lastly the BBQ Burger Slider. This was top notch in my book for tasty burgers. A melted slice of sharp cheddar and crispy onion ring was the perfect balance to the beef. I could have just left after these and been content, but now is when I go into complete ecstasy.

Dessert. I live for dessert. It makes all of the troubles of life disappear if only for a moment. That being said, Max Brenner hits it out of the park with ALL of the desserts I had. Chocolate/Chocolate chip cookie, Chocolate chip/Walnut cookie, I love you. They were served warm and with beakers of milk. This might have been the moment in the evening when I turned to my friends and said,"" If someone proposed to me that I wasn't really into I might just say YES if they did it here"". I cannot say enough about the quality of the chocolate used. Smooth, not overly sweet, but just divine in every way. My favorite dessert by far was the Banana Split Waffles.  The waffle was dense, warm and had a flavor like no other waffle I have ever tasted. The best I've ever tasted anywhere! It was topped with fresh banana and complimented by a drizzle of melted chocolate sauce. Home fricken run! 

I know I went off on the food, but I must also go off on the service. All of the staff was friendly down to the buspersons. Maybe I was tipping too much because I was actually bribing them with their trays of goodness, but I think it was because they were so nice and made me feel special. All of my friends have said the same about the staff. 

Max Brenner, until we meet again under the pale moonlight I am going to tell everyone who has a mouth and a belly to take a journey through Flavor Town for a VIP experience at your restaurant. xoxo",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,5,3,5,EbhgA5Dv03NxeKVxdCxPbQ

Its surprising to see people complaining about service on here, but I guess it can really depend on the waiter/waitress. That being said, we had two different servers (about a month apart), and both had great knowledge of the menu, awesome explanations of the food and were more than accommodating towards our special requests.

Let me just lay this out there for you. Max Brenner owns the crown in my book for the best Veggie Burger I've ever had. Its so good it makes me think I could give up eating meat. And then I tried their Wings.  Oh their wings...dry rubbed, awesome smoky sauce and a great in house bleu cheese. These things are killer.

Second time in, we had the BALT and Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich. Both very good, but neither on the level of our first meal.  If you loving Avocado, you will have never had more on a sandwich than you'll get with the BALT. So much, its almost a challenge to eat. The Spicy Tuna Salad was good, just not spicy enough for my tastes.

The second time we also gave the Loaded Dessert Pizza a shot. A half pizza is about the size of a half a frozen pizza and has four slices. The pizza itself, eh...It just seems like the pizza part is treated as just the vehicle for the chocolate and goodies which makes it the most underwhelming part of the dish. That being said, anything from this place with chocolate is fine by my book (and the chocolate more than makes up for the lackluster crust).

If Yelp had separate ratings for service, Max Brenner would get a big ZERO.  Before I begin, I must note that we went on a Monday evening and it was not very busy.

1. It took close to 10 minutes after getting seated until somebody came to our table. 
2. Orders came out wrong.  (A salad was ordered half-dressed with dressing on the side but it came out wrong.  Coffee came out cold.  Mojitos came out with very little mint.)
3. We had two young kids (2 & 7) and usually restaurants will bring their drinks in kids cups (or covered cups), but the server didn't have the insight to do that for us.  Perhaps this isn't bad service...but I certainly appreciate servers who can anticipate your specific needs.
4. Halfway thru dinner...a server drops our check on our table.  Wow...anxious to close the restaurant???

3.5 stars.
Max Brenner obviously stars its dessert category, but, I was so hungry for a good, savory brunch nearby! And this so happened to catch my eye. 

I was more in a savory mood, so I got the egg omelette combo. Not bad. Portion sizes were a tad bit smaller than other usual breakfast places, but that was expected. It also came with a nice fluffy biscuit to dip in chocolate. The chocolate pancakes seemed awesome, but I just couldn't get myself to eat something sweet that morning, such a shame!

I did, however, get the milk hot chocolate as my dessert, at the end of my meal. I'm glad I got this one instead of the dark hot chocolate because it would have been way too intense and rich for me. It comes with a right amount of hot chocolate... Mm, I wish I could be sipping on one right now!

Overall, good place to eat, especially for the chocolate-y things. Great service, too! Our server was kind and patient...

I settled on the Chocolate cheesecae crepes ($10.95). Bad move.. I thought it would be more cheesecake-y. It was mostly banana with chocolate syrup in a crepe. I didn't even like the sauce it came with that much, but I did really like the raspberry with whipped cream. Honestly, I wish I had just said - ""Hey. It's Vegas. You're at Max Brenner. Who cares what time it is."" and gone with something ridiculously sweet with ice cream or something. Oh well - you live and you learn! Now I know for next time.

Boyfriend got the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet ($14.95), which he really liked. Scrambled eggs, sausage, onion, tomatoes, spinach, fries and mushrooms in a skillet with a a baguette and some choclolate to dip it in. I thought it was good, but wasn't blown away. Would have preferred it with a bit of ketchup. I also got a cafe latte, which was wonderfully foamy and (of course) had two pieces of chocolate which melted their way into the cup. I could have done without the chocolate, but it didn't influence the taste much. I enjoyed it because it helped cut the sweetness of the crepes really well.

My friend ordered the deep fudge chocolate cake (sadly, they were out of our first request - the truffle heart cake - at 12:30 pm though??) and I ordered the banana split waffle. The cake was very rich but luckily it was served with a small scoop of ice cream. I looooove chocolate and I loved every bite but there was no way I could finish my half of this cake. Next came out the banana split waffle (yes, I felt like a glutton at this point but who cares?? It's vacation. My trainer wasn't very happy with me when I gave him that excuse.) That waffle was the best part of the whole meal. Served with a shot sized amount of choclate ganache and chocolate waffer balls was the perfect balance between the waffle, bananas, ice cream and rice krispies. I loved everything about this place except our waitress. She seemed distracted and forgot that we had ordered the waffle along with the cake. But hey - everyone has off days!

The presentation of each dish, even the hot chocolate, was very creative and pleasing.  Service was good, and ambience is nice.  The only things holding me back from giving this 4 stars are that the waffle was very dry, the tiramisu was a tad too sweet, and the hot chocolate lacked depth of flavor.

We wanted to start off with an appetizer so we ordered the white corn croquettes and they were delicious!! White corn anything is such a treat with all that sweetness. There was quite a thick layer of bread crumbs which I disliked but a minor complaint. 

There were a few tables around us enjoying ice cream sundaes so I was immediately drawn to that. Sadly, there were only two sundae options and both consisted of peanut butter ice cream. I am not the biggest fan of peanut butter, but we still decided to order the Euphoria Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae. The crunchy hazelnut bits were my favorite part. Be warned that half of our sundae was SO MUCH peanut butter flavor/stuff and the other half was not so much. Unfortunate for me, guess which side I was eating until I finally decided to say something, to which my boyfriend said ""wait, try this side!"" :(:( 

Service was horrible. We literally sat there for what seemed like forever, while our waitress went to get our waters. After 10-15 minutes, I waved down another waiter who reluctantly took our order.

So my boyfriend and I went here for dessert on our 4th Anniversary. He made reservation thinking there would be a lot of people since it was on a Thanksgiving.

We got there 10mins late for our reservation and the friendly hostess greeted us and seat us right away. I was surprised that the place was not packed at all.

Our server was very helpful, we were overwelmed by a lot of dessert choices and we couldn't decide what to get. Beau, our server recommend their infamous fondue-- where we can sample 6 different dessert and dip 'em on our choice of melted chocolate.
So we got that and the hazelnut shake that they serve on their Alice cup.
Everything was chocolaty and serving size was just right. No left over for us! Lol

We enjoyed our first time here and would definitely come back to try their food choices and of course more of their chocolaty goodies. A must try when you are in the area.

Five star for great service and yummy dessert!

Last week, I forced group to go to Max Brenner for some dessert.  Located conveniently inside the forum shops in Caesar's Palace, we didn't have to trudge through the icy Vegas weather outside.

At around 7 pm, we were seated immediately on the upper floor.  Crowds were minimal and noise was minimal here.  Ahhh...more peace and quiet to sink my teeth into my dessert.  

After combing through the dessert menu from front to back, then back to front, we finally decided on the Banana split waffle ($13.95).

The presentation of the dessert plate was awesome!  When it was placed in front of me, my eyes lit up.  ""IS THIS ALL FOR ME??? YAYYY!!!"" The waffle was crispy and warm and the bananas were crispy after being caramelized.  The vanilla ice cream paired SOO well with the warm waffle and extra chocolate was set aside in a container that looked like a beaker.  Crispy coated chocolate pieces were also on the side too.  The dessert was absolutely delicious from beginning to end.  If there weren't other people around, I think I would have licked the plate in the end.

Service here was also great and efficient.  Our server gave us great recommendations and refilled our drinks regularly.

If you are a chocolate lover, COME HERE! The 80's milkshake is to die for. Definitely the best milkshake I ever had and the cup it comes in is super cute. The texture of it wasn't so thick that I couldn't suck it through my straw. It was perfect! My boyfriend got Brenner Burger and it came with waffle fries and pickles. The burger was surprisingly good. I've been to a lot of burger joints and this one tops a lot of the ones  I've tried. The burger sat so tall I didn't even know how to bite into it so I used a knife and fork and just took a piece haha. I got the guilt free omelet.. but at first I was iffy about getting it because I wasn't really craving an omelet. But once it came, I took a bite and it was sooo good and has so much flavor. The potatoes that came with it were a little hard, but it was so tasty. It was seasoned just right. The biscuit was alittle dry.. but the taste of it was good especially when you dip it into the chocolate they give you. 

For dessert, we got the sharing platter for two. It came with fondue, marshmallows (that you can roast yourself), strawberries, bananas, a waffle (too sweet) with ice cream, a tempura bananas, chocolate crispy ball stuff, 2 chocolate bars (that weren't textured like chocolate bars, but tasted like it). Overall, it was very delicious, but it was hard to finish because it was a lot of sweets. The only thing I probably didn't like was the waffle, because it was too sweet.

Overall, our total came out to about $80 for these 4 items. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of our waiter. I felt like he was a little too inexperienced.

We each had their famous cookies - Walnut Chocolate Chip and Double Chocolate - both were fantastic and incredible - soft and gooey cookies with rich chocolate flavor.  My favorite was the Walnut Chocolate Chip...it's definitely one of the best cookies I've ever had.  These were $10 each and even though it arrived with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and a mixed fruit and mint side, it still was very pricey. 

We also tried their sundaes -  I had a dessert with chocolate ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate cookies and it arrived with a rich milk chocolate dipping sauce.  It was very good and decadent.  The other sundae ordered was a chocolate peanut butter one with lots of great chocolate flavor and peanut butter goodness.

This was definitely a splurge, but I enjoyed it.  The next time I'm in LV, I'd definitely come back here , but I'd go to the outside/""to-go"" stand and order the Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookies, which are only $5...those cookies were extremely impressive.

Problem was the service was just terrible. First there was a girl who was training but really was receiving no guidance and didn't know what she was doing. Then our waitress,  who seemed nice at first, left us for so long when we were waiting to order. We had to ask another waiter to get her and even finding someone else took a while. 

Our food took a while to come too which would have been fine if a) it come out all at once and b) it came out correctly! Noting that this was 11pm and so maybe service is better in the day but still! She brought out half of our fondue, and then served someone else before bringing the rest! Then we realized she had brought milk not dark chocolate so had to wait again for her to correct it.

We were all very excited to to try it out. We had all heard good things about the food. 

I ordered the Kobe Burger and Fruit Smoothie. Both were good. Unfortunately I was still a little hung over from the night before to completely enjoy my food. I also tried a small piece of the Chocolate Pizza, and it was delicious!

3519485,2010-08-06,6,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Between Serendipity 3 and this place Caesar's has the Vegas market cornered when it comes to over-priced desserts and junk food. But, despite it being a tourist trap I wanted to check it out. Afterall, it's a tourist trap filled with lots of chocolatey goodness.

I stopped by with my son for lunch and they tried to seat us at a tiny 2-top right by the entrance, outside of the actual restaurant. um... no, not a good choice. I asked to be seated somewhere else. They brought us inside and sat us at another small 2-top. I'm not one to bitch and moan, so we took it. It seems like most of the tables on the lower level are small (They have a second floor that I didn't check out). When you combine that with the large plates that everything is served on, it makes for a crowded and uncomfortable dining experience.

The menus are kind of ridiculous, both in a good and bad way. There's a spiral bound book that lists all the sweets. There's a separate menu for brunch, lunch and dinner with no entrees for less than $12. Even their sandwiches are $13+. Even for Las Vegas standards, I think that's outrageously pricey. Kids get their own menu with a pack of crayons.

We ordered:
- Blackened skirt steak & mushroom quesadilla ($14.95) - filled with tender strips of steak, sauteed mushrooms, topped with salsa and sour cream and laying on a bed of thin tortilla strips. Mighty tasty, but I couldn't stop thinking that I was paying for a $14 quesadilla.

- Kid's order of chicken fingers ($8.25) - 3 chick fingers with waffle fries. My kid loved them and the waffle fries were some of the best I've had. The meal comes with a paint brush. A couple of the waiters encouraged my kid to paint with the mustard and ketchup provided. Obviously, they don't have kids. If I let my kid do that he would have painted himself, me, the table and any poor soul passing by. It's cool that they encourage that because it makes for a fun, kid-friendly environment, but it may not be the best thing for a two year old to do.

We also ordered a lemonade ($3.50) which was kind of like a slushy and got a dark chocolate hazelnut shake ($7.95) to go. The shake was rich, creamy and delicious.

We were too full to experience their desserts (except for the shake), but I'd gladly come back to try one or two.

The service was excellent. We had a main server who was very attentive and eager to explain the concept of the restaurant and answer any questions. There were also a few other waiters who stopped by to see if we needed anything. Even the hostesses were very friendly. They gave my kid a couple temporary tattoos to put on later as we left.

Yeah, I would go back but probably just for dessert. I still can't believe I spent $44 (including the tip) for lunch for one adult and a two year old. I'm used to spending a lot for food but this was a little excessive.

We came here specifically for dessert. There were eight in our party and we ordered two samplers that were each supposed to feed two but totally filled us up.It came with chocolate sponge cake, chocolate egg roll, chocolate bark, chocolate fondue (dark, milk or white) with marshmallows and fruit, crunchy chocolate wafer balls and more yummy choco goodness.

Not only was everything we sampled decadent and delicious, the atmosphere was just as cool. I fell in love with all of the cups, plates and silverware. Hot chocolate is served in a ""Hug Me"" cup that you need to pick up with both your hands. Milkshakes come in an Alice in Wonderland inspired ""Drink Me"" glasses. How fun is that?

I haven't had a chance to try much of the food aside from the pizza. I had the mushroom and ricotta pizza which was on a thin crust and tasted as wonderful as their desserts.

I would give this place five stars but they could improve their service. The first time I went, they screwed up another table's order and gave us a free pizza so it wouldn't go to waste. Good for us but sucked for the other table who had to wait for their food. The next time I went, our waitress was rude and accidentally dropped a stack of plates.

We've tried several items, both sweet and savory from their menu.  The prices are high at this restaurant, as one might expect, since it is owned by a celebrity chef and located in the Caesar's Forum Shops mall.  While tasty and high quality, the several savory items we've tried are not worth the high price.  We liked their mac and cheese (very cheesy with a crispy topping and yummy tomato sauce on the side).  Their chicken fingers and waffle fries were solid, but not quite as special as the mac and cheese.

As is Mr. Brenner's specialty, the desserts are the highlight here.  Three items stand out to us.  Our very favorite item here is a cocktail - the Satisfaction Guaranteed.  There are quite a few ingredients but it just tastes like chocolate.  Though not thick and creamy, the taste is purely, deliciously chocolatey.  The butterscotch shake is also decadent and amazing.  Their Italian hot chocolate is super rich and thick.  We love all the desserts that feature dark chocolate.

The atmosphere is very classy and make you expect great things to come out of the kitchen for you.  For the most part, they deliver.  The serving presentation is really fancy.  So many special little platters, jars, dishes, serving trays, ""potion"" bottles.

We've found that many dishes are hard to picture based on the descriptions on the menu (chocolate with chocolate and a side of chocolate).  The servers are very helpful in making suggestions and describing what everything looks/tastes like.

My first time dining here was date night for Valentine's Day. I was so stoked that he planned this because he knows how much I LOVE chocolate. This place is all about the presentation! The ambiance, the displays, and even food presentation!

We had reservations and were able to get walked in. Our server was prompt and even gave us a few suggestions on the menu. She informed us that we can get complimentary chocolate samples! We both started out with ""hug mug"" drinks which is basically hot chocolate! At first we opted for the standard hot chocolate, but we ended up loving the white chocolate marshmallow and ordered a second one of those! Be careful with the hug mugs because they get a little hot, but there is a spoon for you to use on the side.

Honey ordered the Grilled Chicken Panini and he said that it was delicious! I ordered the Mushroom & Ricotta Pizza.. and that's how I discovered that I am not a fan of ricotta. After picking it off, LOL, it was definitely one of the best pizzas I had in a long time! We split their Cookies & Cream Shake and ended the meal with the Classic European Chocolate Fondue. It was the best chocolate fondue this girl has ever had. Beat out the Sugar Factory by far!

The second time that I ate here was taking a friend out for her birthday! We had ate dinner beforehand so we were just coming for the delicious desserts. She got the S'Mores Concoction which was on an adorable display and I got the OMG Chocolate Chunk Cookies, the dark chocolate. The server explained to us what everything on our cute platter was before we dug in. This was seriously a delicious cookie. It had the right little crunch on the outside and the soft gooiness I love on the inside. It was perfect. I also had chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and minted strawberries as my sides.

We went to the Caesars for Restaurant week knowing there would be many restaurants there participating. My group consisted of 2 adults and a child. None of us were particularly hungry so we ordered one lunch off the Restaurant week menu and a mac and cheese. The waitress said that we could not share so I told her we were not going to share. After talking to her manager she came back to question what my boyfriend would be eating and after he responded that he would just be nibbling off mine she again told us there was a strict no sharing policy and that sharing would not be allowed. So we went to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill instead where they had no policy against sharing.

I was very disappointed with Max Brenner and do not understand the purpose of such policy.  Isn't the primary point of Restaurant Week to support fighting hunger in Las Vegas?

The location is great, clean and beautiful I have no complaints on that, great place for a date or your mom. 

- Courteous fast and efficient but the place was not full at all when I was there.
- Dessert was the name of the game today: 

Italian thick hot chocolate....just like they serve it in Rome...very rich I give it an A+ 

80's milkshake ( chocolate ganash, vanilla ice cream, chocolate shell) NOT the best...I believe the icecream was not up to par with the exquisite chocolate in the cup... they should serve a better brand or make their own ice cream. B-

Max's Palace Famous Chocolate Mess Party ( layer of chocolate mudcake, icecream, chocolate chunks, strawberries or bananas and overkill of Walmart brand whipped cream) ....I recommend staying away from this MESS because its more of an after party than a party itself...again, the icecream is substandard and it is 70% whipped cream all over it...even my 10 yr old niece wondered why there was so much, now I know there is better whipped cream out there somewhere because my mother makes her own and its fantastic .... so I'm sure Max could come up with better cream somehow.....it was just overkill of store bought whipped cream...so I will NOT recommend this dessert.

You really have an asset in him. I believe his name is Juan. We went at 10PM on 4/9 if that helps in case I got the name wrong. Seriously, he is such an ideal employee and server. He knows EVERYTHING about your products and is very proud to be there. I loved the Earl Grey tea and the mechanism that you had for brewing and dispensing it. I would so LOVE to buy one of those for us. All in all, I was very impressed and if there is any reward you can give our server, please do so!

Many thanks!

3653950,2013-01-27,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"After hearing good things about this place my bf and I finally stopped to try it out. I must admit that what drew me in was the description to the ""Satisfaction Guaranteed"" cocktail. We were sat pretty quickly but then came the waiting. I can understand that it was a popular place but many waiters walked by us and didn't even acknowledge us. After about 15min of sitting there and without so much as a hello we were ready to just get up walk out. I told my bf that we should give them 5 more minutes and if nothing happened after then, then we could leave. Well, 3 minutes in our waiter finally appeared. 
I ordered the Brenner Burger and ""Satisfaction Guaranteed"" cocktail and my bf ordered the Turkey Waffle Sandwich.
The burger was amazing! I was so sad when I finished it. My bf liked his sandwich also but claimed my burger tasted much better. The cocktail was like thick alcoholic chocolate milk..Super yummy! The presentation for the cocktail made it look even yummier!
Our waiter only stopped by twice. The first time, to drop of my cocktail and the second time to ask if we needed anything else while dropping off the bill. In the end, during the whole time we ate, the servers who would bring out the food payed more attention to us. They were courteous, asked about our meal and refilled our drinks. Everything our waiter should have asked us about.
Regardless, of that small service flop, I would still go back and eat there again. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is sweet.",_SSZT8TwbmChhw3T3vCHVA,0,2,4,-SP6oSXC7UUunsOu3xoR-w

They did have a few new items on the menu, like chicken finger and beer battered onion rings with CHOCOLATE RANCH dipping sauce. Weird, right?! I had to try it. And it wasn't bad but, it wasn't great either.

3667551,2012-12-26,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"I've had this place bookmarked for as long as I can remember.

Let me just say that I LOVE LOVE LOVE chocolate, so Max Brenner was really a no brainer for me to try.

Finally had the opportunity this past saturday with the lil bro. I was craving hot chocolate, frozen hot chocolate, something decadent and was deciding between this and Serendipity. We decided to go with this and was planning on getting dessert of some sort.

Well, although we had the intention of ordering their chocolate drinks and desserts we ended up getting their Adult chocolate infused drinks instead. (lil bro wanted some alcohol)

Anyways.. so for drinks we got the following:

-White Russian 
This is their most popular drink. According to our waiter (who was super nice and very helpful) this is the most instagram worthy drink as well... so what the heck, I must get it right?

Well the verdict is this... The flavors were bold, it tasted like a white russian infused with white chocolate. And to top it all off there were two marshmallows that came on a stirring stick. I must say that the concept was cute. The shot of white chocolate came in a miniature
z flask and was very dainty, but for the price of the drink...and the size, I would say the drink was just alright and nothing too spectacular. It was good, but definitely not mind blowing..and not THAT instagram worthy. I must say though, that it was strong and perhaps the strongest alcoholic drink they serve.

-Tiramisu
This drink was yummy and had a very good presentation. It came in a dainty cup with a ladyfinger cookie on top. If you love coffee or tiramisu for that matter, this would be a great drink. Not too heavy, not too strong, taste like an espresso drink.

So I really wanted to rate this place higher, but based on the drinks and the menu selection, I really wasn't impressed. Everything seemed overpriced (which should be expected since you're on the strip) but nothing seem to jump out of the page at me as something that i MUST try.

The actual location is cute, good location, great atmosphere, but definitely not worth the price that you pay. I mean, i'm sure there are better selections elsewhere.. more worth the calories and more satisfying to both your palette and wallet.",iYeLvhAGiUgKeNkZV19_IQ,0,0,3,LnzELbrY3vEncjeyo3Pnmg

ordered:
*tutti frutti waffle - as our dessert. $13.95. it came with mixed berries, crumbled vanilla ice cream, milk chocolate ganache and choco-pop. Yummy! I love waffles and the tutti frutti was a perfect balance between sweet and fruity. The choco-pop was a nice addition. I would highly recommend this if you're a waffle lover. 
*the best B.A.L.T. which really is the avocado BLT- which was a little confusing because we thought it was going to be a burger with avocado BLT. However nevertheless it was very delicious it came with a side of waffle fries that is dusted with chili and cocoa powder. The waffle fries side is quite small so if you're sharing I would recommend ordering another side of waffle fries because they're just that good. $14.75. you think for almost 15 bucks i'll get a piece of meat. But everything was fresh and the bacon was thick.  


tips: 
*You can make reservations on OpenTable. 
*indoor and outdoor seating. Inside might be a little bit loud. 
*located inside the forum. 
*They have a little chocolate type of store and they give free samples. 
*They have cool looking coffee machines. 
*Cash and credit card accepted. 
*Happy Hour is from 3-6pm.

overall, Staff are really nice and attentive. The really encourage you to read the story behind Max Brenner.  Now when my girlfriend and I asked the waitress what would she recommend to eat... it was really hard because she recommended everything she informed us that she gained a lot of weight working there because everything tastes so good. So that totally didn't help us decide. we had a very difficult time because we wanted two get two items and half it so we'll be able to try both items. I definitely loved the food, atmosphere, and service here at Max Brenner and will definitely comeback especially for the waffles. There's more items on the menu that I wanna try.

I LITERALLY had to make sure I found myself in Vegas in 2010 to use a Groupon I purchased here. I was shocked to see Max Brenner with a Groupon because quite frankly, this is a popular restaurant known world wide that can get by without a Groupon, I'm sure. 

Of course the chocolate here is ridiculous- and by ridiculous, I mean freaking amazing. There isn't a piece of chocolate on Max's menu that couldn't bring me to tears of joy. This chocolate is dark, rich, thick, a whole bunch of decadent adjectives baby. A list of deserts so delicious, it'll have you wishing you were Augustus Gloop.

I'd have to say, The Bald Man has done us west coasters a solid by bringing his chocolate to Caesars. The theme of this restaurant is interesting- very 'wooden chocolate industrial workshop' vibe going on. The plates and cups are all unique.

my lunch entree was a Deep Bleu Cobb Salad since I wanted something light and refreshing. 
I'm being serious when I say this is the most delicious cobb salad I have ever ate. They mix all the ingredients for me instead of separating each into sections so I get a consistent flavor.

3704794,2013-06-12,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Made some reservations via Yelp at 9:40 PM (I love Vegas hours!). Got there a little bit later because it is nearly impossible to turn into Caesar's Palace off the strip with the 5 gazillion tourists walking around. When we got to the restaurant, it looked like everyone had just cleared out. However, the host told us that they had Happy Hour specials at the bar, so we decided to forfeit the reservations and sit at the bar. The inner boozer made a good choice!

We each had some chocolate cocktails to start it off - wifey's chocolate martini was really great; my white russian was alright. I felt they could both use some more alcohol, but if you're looking for a tasty drink, you've found some right here. The server/bartender was pretty helpful but slightly all over the place so we didn't get our waters or place settings right away. Who cares though, we have chocolatey alcohol in our hands. I let things slide here that wouldn't be taken lightly at other places.

Looked for Giancarla E's recommended Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate pancakes but didn't see them on their menu. Plus the wifey wanted to get the fondue so I decided to save the chocolate for later. Got some $6 sliders and white corn croquettes, which were both pretty decent (the chipotle sauce that came with the croquettes was pretty flavorful). Got the waffle (crisscut) fries but I didn't really get a whole lot of the chocolate/chili taste that other posters raved about. Seriously just tasted like some Carl's Jr or Chick fil-A crisscut fries. 

Anyway, we weren't here to induce ourselves into food comas (we were saving that for the next day at Bacchanal), but the fondue for two really put us over the top. Really liked that you could toast your own marshmallows - wifey had fun almost burning down the restaurant. 

Location was pretty nice, and if you have a private party upstairs, it looked like a chill spot. It's located in the Forum Shops so you can go there for a late dinner and still have time to walk around and do some shopping (most stores close around midnight).",wYqrEP8IAqb6r-MBEHDUzg,0,0,4,fRS-PUCJ5Ymlo9M-uuVR5Q
3709165,2012-08-07,4,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"When I contemplate some of the top highlights of my recent trip to Las Vegas, the evening I had at Max Brenner's is one that is still seated in the forefront of my thoughts. I think I found my new favorite restaurant on the strip, and I'm head over heels in love with it. 

Max Brenner has developed quite the notoriety for its ability to cater to the sensibilities of us chocoholics. Indeed, it's expansive dessert menu is what initially caused my antennas to go up, and, inevitably, for it to be bookmarked in my Yelp to-do list. Nevertheless, I had been reading reviews that also boasted about the other items on Max's menu. Sure enough, not only is Max Brenner an amazing dessert destination (and that's the understatement of the century), but it's also a great spot to enjoy a phenomenal meal before embarking on the mission to satiate a raging chocolate craving.

We arrived for 8pm reservations on a Saturday night. Reservations aren't necessary, but it's probably smart because it's hard to predict when the retaurant may face an onslaught of hungry tourists that are trapsing around The Forum at all hours of the day/night. The hostesses were sweet and welcoming and took us to our table where the menu was explained. I decided to start with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and my dining companion had Max's White Russian ($13). Although I enjoyed the refreshing, crisp taste of my white wine, I had a sip of the white Russian and it was sheer perfection in a glass. Loved it.

For an appetizer, we decided to share the White Corn Croquettes ($11.95). Absolutely delicious. I was so impressed by how each croquette was balanced in taste. The manchego cheese was nicely offset by the sweet corn, and all of those elements were married perfectly together by the exterior, crispy batter. Brilliant.

For my main entree, I opted for the Grilled Chicken Panini ($14.50), and my date had the much-bragged-about Brenner Burger ($14.25). My panini was served in a creative fashion, artfully stacked. The sandwich caused me to swoon, and the olive pesto sauce that was lightly spread on the bread was divine. My companion's Brenner Burger looked equally good. It was very large, and was also flavored by a giant vidalia fried onion ring. I would have had a bite, but I was enjoying my panini too much. Typically, I'm not much of a fry eater, but the waffle fries that came with our sandwiches were so ridiculously good. It's the first time in a long time that I've actually finished the fries that came wtih my entree.

Because the profane indulgence at dinner wasn't enough, we moved on to dessert. I was given the authority to choose what I wanted on the menu; therefore, I picked the O.M.G. Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($9.95). Yes, paying almost $10 for a cookie sounds outlandish, but the cookies at Max Brenner are far from conventional. Our milk chocolate cookie, a giant cookie that practically occupied the majority of the real estate on the plate it was sitting on, was served with a hot fudge ganache, whipped cream and chopped strawberries. Heaven. In addition, I also had a cup of Max's famous hot chocolate, and it, too, was staggeringly rich and good. 

Our waiter was fantastic. Service was swift. Our orders didn't lag. I was impressed by the entire operation.

Needless to say, I woke up with a tummy ache, but it's my fault. I went overboard. I ate too much. And it's so easy to do at a place like Max Brenner. There will be another time when I find myself in Las Vegas, and it will give me another opportunity to explore the menu even further.

Ok, switch chairs.   It took 15 minutes for us just to place a drink order. And when the order was taken,  the server, Danielle, was rushed and indifferent. She also kept calling us ""guys"" and that was annoying.   I ordered the salmon. It was as dry and as stiff as my Nike sneaker.  When the table was cleared, she noticed that I only ate one or two bites of my salmon.  She asked how it was. Seriously?  She needs to learn plate cues.  See my reviews of Hank's Steakhouse.  Anywho, I told her it was terrible. She told me she would take it off the bill.  Really? She took an order, which I didn't eat, off the bill?  How generous!!!!

Came here to for the typical late Vegas lunch.  Really convenient since we were shopping in the Forum Shops that afternoon.  Since we were at a place dedicated to chocolate, we had to order one of their specialty drinks!  So we got the Italian thick hot (dark) chocolate.  I've never had a richer smoother creamier hot chocolate...it was like a quality dark chocolate bar in liquid form.  Amazing and very addicting!  It comes in this innovative mug that has a tear-shaped opening so that there is a tip/spout that you drink from -- I assume it prevents a mess from being created?  

And their food was also really good! We shared the pita chips (warm toasted/crispy outside, soft chewy inside = DELICIOUS!) with the eggplant dip, chicken tenders, spicy tuna salad sandwich, and the banana tempura fondue.  Watch out for the banana tempura...it's not really made with tempura batter (it's more fine and grainy, but still crispy) and the banana lump inside is very soft and creamy, and not the usual firmer banana texture you might expect. Everything was still very much beyond what we expected and their portions were generous (kinda spoiled our dinner later! haha).  We were thoroughly impressed.  And to top things off, we didn't know it was restaurant week in Las Vegas, so the pita chips, sandwich, and banana tempura were together only $20.11.  What a steal!

The service could have been more pleasant and personable, but maybe it was just an off-day.  We will likely return to try more of their menu items...and more chocolate stuff of course!

It complimented the sugar biscuit very well along with the soft butter in my breakfast dish. The CREPE. Wow. I think this may just be the best crepe I've ever tasted!!! It was perfectly crisped, perfect crispness. And the ganache sauce in the flask, drizzled over the crepe was too good to be true.

It was my first time trying the Cocoa Powdered Waffle Fries and I thought it was pretty interesting.  I didn't have ketchup with it since I wanted to be able to taste the Cocoa.  The Cocoa was subtle and gave a hint of sweetness, but didn't overpower the Fries.

For my drink I went with Max's Famous White Russian.

Pretty good!  The warm white chocolate was pure and helped melt down the marshmellow into the drink.

And since I was there, just for the fun of it, might as well pick up another ""Works"" Chocolate Pizza.

How can you not get one when it's almost half price? LOL

On the sweet side, I had the After Party Belgian Waffle, which was fine, but a real contrast to the Illegal Chocolate Pancakes, mainly as the waffles are two fairly tiny dollar pancake sized morsels with about two feet of whipped cream on top, compared to the truly hefty pancakes at the same price. It's no contest: love the pancakes, okay on the waffles. 

It worries me that the joint is almost always empty, because I do really like Max and hope he stays in Vegas; that said, I think they'd do miles better somewhere like Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, or Paris, as opposed to next to the snack bar in Caesar's Forum Shops.",J8_KEdgc9_k9PCLia16DlA,0,0,4,hcxu6-IndzocgM2GvLJFaw

Hubs and I shared our food. We got:

+ The Brenner Burger
+ Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes
+ Mexican Spicy Hot Chocolate with chocolate wafer balls

I shared a Bacon Avocado Lettuce Tomato sandwich with a friend and it was completely savory with enormous hunks of avocado and bacon. Plus the seasoned criss-cut fries and dip were equally deeelectable.

Our waitress was the sweetest woman ever; she was incredibly friendly and attentive to our huge party of fourteen, graciously taking care of the most customary services like water and napkins.

Buffalo chicken tenders- comes with 2 large pieces and those infamous brenner waffle fries dusted with cocoa powder. You definitely get your money's worth with this because it's a good amount of food for a single person. Spiciness was just right for me and I prefer most of my buffalo style food on the mild side. Perfect amount of sauce because sometimes when you order tenders buffalo style its like dripping with sauce and thankfully that's not the case here. Breading was good and not too thick. Highly recommend!

The Mini Philly- the perfect combination of cheese and beef. It's practically a match made in heaven. I think it's the 5 cheese blend that does the trick.

Buffalo chicken slider- pretty good too, but I'm not a big fan of feta cheese. Although I would recommend the mini philly rather than this.

Onion rings- pretty standard onion rings. Comes with a chocolate ranch sauce, but it honestly tasted really close to plain ranch with a hint of brown color. 

chocolate pizza- loved every bite of it, just like I expected. Half a pizza is big portion for 1 person so you should really plan on sharing this. The combination of the chocolate marshmallow and crust does the trick- Brenner you a pure genius or chocolate genius that is, hahaha.

There are two sides to the store. The first is where you dine and on the opposite side are all their confections. 

I did the unthinkable and ordered the Deep Blue Cobb Salad. I wasn't feeling very well so I wanted something as light as possible. It was decadent with the bleu cheese and bacon, but the salad wasn't big at all, so the flavors weren't overwhelming. It was a good salad but I'll try to never order a salad from here again. 

My fiance went the sweet breakfast route and ordered the After Party Belgian Waffle. The waffle was cooked well but it consisted of two small waffles covered in whipped cream and strawberries. In two little mini beakers were the melted white chocolate and strawberry honey. It tastes like a creamy strawberry syrup and the white chocolate was good. 

The next time we visit, I said we'd have to try the Chocolate Fondue. A few people ordered it to share and it looked amazing. I'd suggest going out of your comfort zone in a place like this. 

We also ordered milkshakes and when you see the prices on these things, you might remember the $5 milkshake scene in Pulp Fiction. Well, these were $8 milkshakes so they better be good. I got the 80s milkshake and it was really boring. He got the Chocolate Espresso milkshake and the flavors were much better, although I didn't taste much of the espresso in there. They weren't worth the price, in my opinion, as our tastebuds didn't receive a blast of excitement as we expected, but they were tasty. We might split one if we decide to try them again. Even Sugar Factory's ice cream concoctions were more creative and comparable in price. Toward the end, my fiance also ordered an Americano with an extra shot and I remember him enjoying it. Before tip, our total cost $53.89 and it was pricey. The $15 salad wasn't worth it and I feel like you have to go big or go home otherwise you might be disappointed. 

On the other side, the chocolate shop is small and sometimes cramped. There is a chocolate twist in all of their treats. Chocolate is their thing. The waitress even gave us a 10% off coupon to use so we found it difficult to pass up buying several things we wanted including their variety box.

Hunger struck us a little after grabbing drinks from Fat Tuesdays (which most of us weren't even able to finish). We weren't looking into getting anything too pricey and we just so happened to stumble into Max Brenner. It had a very clean and stylish atmosphere. We were seated very quickly upstairs soon after speaking to the host. However, it seemed like we were the only party up there. Hence, the bad service. 

It took a really long time for the food to come out (about 20 minutes) and I only ordered potato skins. Granted, I've learned it takes a long time to cook and we had a big group, but these guys are pros compared to my cooking am I right?

Once we got the food, I took a nice whiff of the baked potato skins before I dug in. They smelled GREAT. I took a picture before I got to it. Then, I picked one up and started munching away. This was the first time I've had them and I was surprised that something so simple could taste so good! I told myself that once I got back home, I'd try to make some on my own. Turns out that it's a bit harder than expected. I can make bacon cheese fries but I definitely have trouble making baked potato skins.

In terms of food quality and taste, I could give these guys a 5 out of 5. Honestly, it was their service that brought the mood down. We were all extremely hungry and the fact that it took 15 minutes for them to come back up and take our orders then another 20 to push out that order was a little too long. I guess that's what we get for ordering real food in a chocolate specialized restaurant. We didn't have time to order dessert at the end, unfortunately. That probably would've upped the rating I'm about to give, but that's not the case. Sorry.",zLlPxG71iwesizgyKyULzQ,1,0,4,QeaLa5wHeZ0x8a3KOh94Yw

I know, it's a heck of a job, but someone's got to do it.  I forced myself to enter the restaurant, perused the menu for quite awhile, and then decided to try the Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake made with vanilla bourbon ice cream, dark chocolate truffle, and topped with whipped cream.

It was served in an ""Alice"" mug that says, ""Drink Me,"" a signature mug of the bald man.  It comes from a statement in Alice in Wonderland when she found a little bottle with a paper label that said, ""Drink me.""

The milkshake was outstanding if a bit pricey - $7.95.  The restaurant is quite nice, and the employees were just excellent - smiles all around and very helpful.  I also bought a tin of caramelized pecans rolled in praline cream and cocoa powder for later nourishment.  Take one as needed.

You order a chocolate crepe or something, and end up with a chocolate shake, too. Today, we splurged on chocolate fondue. Do me, I said to it.

His chocolate cafes are popping up all over the world. With all truthfulness, this Vegas location isn't as cool as Brisbane, Australia.

I ate a few fries before I trekked back into the mall and before they got soggy in the Togo box. For $7 there were about 10-12. Large waffle fries. I didn't really taste any cocoa and just the smallest hint of chili. I saw it but I just wasn't tasting it... And I'm not even a fan of spicy stuff, but these fries were lacking.

4012234,2013-06-29,7,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Located inside Cesar's Palace Forum Shops across from the H&M store-Max Brenner is a two story casual chocolatey smelling diner-type restaurant that offers breakfast, lunch, dinner and their speciality chocolate desserts!  

Mom and I came in for lunch.  We stumbled upon it and it had been on my bookmarks list for sometime. I'm so glad I finally made it in because I definitely plan on coming back.

Service was friendly and since the restaurant was not busy the upstairs section was closed:( which was a bummer because it offers views of the mall and sounds of the buzzing music from H&M.  

The nice thing is if you're a guest at Cesar's and you're just rolling out of bed around noon-ish (which probably isn't too far fetched...I mean this is Vegas) then you'll be glad to know there's  a dark dim-lit diner-ish place to come and grab some strong coffee a breakfast burrito and that much needed Bloody Mary!

Recommendations were the pizzas, the club sandwich and the burgers.  I opted for the steak panini with a side of waffle fries and yummy savory dipping sauce.  Mom couldn't make up her mind so she had the burger-wow this was some cheeseburger!  Piled high with a fried onion ring, bacon, tomato, lettuce and avocado if you wanted it.  Talk about a heart-attack on a plate!  She took a few enjoyable bites and took the rest home.  I liked my panini but it wasn't spectacular.  The dipping sauce was tasty and it was perfect for the fries and sandwich to dip in.

Since we had to leave I couldn't stay for dessert so I took dessert with me.  A wonderful chocolate shake, thick rich and delicously chocolatey.  MMMMM!

A nice gift shop is adjoined so you can take some sweets home as a momento or a present for someone really special.  

I love this place. I saw so many options on the menu like FONDUE...yummy...so next time I come in that will be on my list of things to try at Max Brenner.

4014600,2010-10-11,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"If you love chocolate, you'll love Max Brenner!  This place is like chocolate nirvana.  Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate everywhere!  Place is nice with modern decor, and the smell of cocoa wafting everywhere inside.  I think the last restaurant to occupy this space in Caesar's was Chinois.  

This review is only for the desserts part of the menu, we didn't try any of the breakfast, brunch, or dinner food so I won't be commenting on it.  But a lot of it did look good!  On to some chocolate!

Myself, I'm not much of a chocolate or sweets fan (I'll make an exception for ice cream, my Mom's baking, and Halo-Halo) so I tend to not eat it very often.  My niece asked us to meet her there for a 'snack' one evening she was visiting LV and we said, ""Where?""  That's my first hearing of Max Brenner.  I pull up the website online and check out their menu.  They had a lot of spins on chocolate and desserts involving chocolate.  Almost everything they had on the dessert menu had chocolate.  See a theme here?  It seemed intriguing, and of course my lady had no objections trying this place out.

At Max Brenner's they take their chocolate seriously.  It's supposed to be an experience, a celebration of cultures of sorts.  In fact, I think the company itself calls it the 'New worldwide chocolate culture'.  But don't quote me!  Their dessert menu is varied and is very playful.  There are 'crepe brulees' and waffles, sweet icons like S'mores , classics with a chocolate twist like tiramisu and cheesecake, their popular chocolate fondue, as well as their menu named 'Max I Scream' with their takes on ice cream and chocolate.  

First we tried the Chocolate Chunks Pizza with the works - Max's double chocolate melting chunks with hazelnuts, bananas, peanut butter, and roasted marshmallows ($16.95).  I thought for this price the pizza should be fairly large but when it came out, it was only about a 9 or 10 inch!  A bit small, but six of us managed to share the whole thing because we could only handle a slice each!  It's very rich and decadent, lots of chocolate and lots of sweet.  Sweet for my tastes but it was good nonetheless.  My main gripe was that the pizza crust was a bit too thick and not very crunchy.  Everyone else on the table loved it though.  

Next we tried the Banana Split Waffles with vanilla bourbon ice cream, milk chocolate truffle, and caramelized rice krispies ($13.95).  I thought this was pretty good.  The waffle was nice and warm and went great with the cool ice cream.  This desert I liked better because it wasn't over the top sweet, I found it had a better balance of flavors and the chocolate was more complemented by the waffle.  This dessert was a bit on the small size as well but we managed to share just fine.

My niece said we had to try the fries, I said ""Sure, why not?""  For me this was the best thing of the night.  Max Brenner's Waffle Fries 'dusted' with chili and cocoa powder were excellent!  Coming to our table nice and hot, the crunchy, savory waffle fries went very well with the semi-sweet cocoa powder dusted on.  I couldn't stop eating them!  They even tasted good after dipping them in ketchup!  Sorry folks if I ruined the flavor for you on that one, ketchup is a food group at my house...it goes with EVERYTHING!  My only complaint was that the serving size again - on the small side.  Who eats here, Oompa Loompas?

Regardless of the smaller portions here I think another visit to Max Brenner's is in order.  I really want to try their ice cream concoctions and their fondue.  Service was quick and friendly here, and not too bothersome so we could catch up with my niece.  Max Brenner also has a chocolate shop within the restaurant where you can stock up on nearly anything chocolate for your trip back home.  Nuts, candies, you name it.  Oh yeah, where else can you get a $5 shot of Max Brenner premium chocolate in a plastic syringe??  Creepy to me, but some folks were in line waiting outside the restaurant for a free sample of this crack-like chocolate from a syringe!  It was like their fix of the day!  They got my kids to give in too...we ended up buying one to take home!  Diabetics beware!!


**Oh, I forgot to mention, the chocolate from the syringe is squirted into your mouth...not injected into your arm!**",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,1,4,JOifu0s-egcBhIO1tElK1A
4020763,2013-08-19,1,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Want to get chocolate wasted? Well this is the perfect place for that! This place was highly recommended by one of my best friends and I knew I had to pay a visit here. The shakes were on my mind as soon as we landed and that is exactly where we headed too. Going to Vegas during the summer was definitely not a great choice but we were in Vegas in a heat wave and all I've been thinking about was those damn Shakes! 

We headed straight to Max Brenner from picking up our rental and we were probably a few of the first customers there around 10ish. We ordered some breakfast omelets and they were so good and fulfilling. It was unique how they had bread with our meals and chocolate and white chocolate served as replacement for their butter. I ordered the Hang over omelet which came with bacon, onions and red peppers and side of potatoes and buttermilk biscuits. 

I didn't know much of this place until I got here but there was tons of humgous chocolate bars displayed around the restaurant. Some were fake though but we got to hold one of the bars and it was quite heavy and quite expensive. If I was a kid I would love love love this place because I would want to get everything in chocolate. And this place is the place for that with Chocolate pizza, waffles, cookies, crepes, Bagels, and even A Chocolate Burger!  And of course I had to order me a shake, the chocolate hazelnut milkshake. which came in their famous Alice Cup. It was so refreshing and the it was made just right not too sweet and overpowering.

They also have a gift shop located to the right of the restaurant. I made sure I paid a visit there too so I could get my BFF a souvenir. I got here those Milkshake Mix with the infamous cups and she was so ecstatic about getting it. 

I can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing shakes! 

Only reason it was short of a star was because of the prices, there was only 3 of us and my bill came out to $60.00 for breakfast and 2 shakes. Which is worth It but I wouldn't come here on a daily only because H&M is right across from them.",N9ajy6JyZVuys5s06H7JJA,1,3,4,GnAYGBMBqn7RW7q1RfizxA
4027908,2011-07-11,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"You should probably try this place if you are walking by and might like it, but tastes vary and it was not quite my cup of tea, so everyone should reflect their own tastes to capture the average in the review and I can't be the one to give this place a top rating. I tried one of the shakes (technically some kind of grenada-something not a shake) and a hot chocolate, as I was between meals. The 'shake' was definitely a different style with the character of a raw chocolate powder based icee with rich dark chocolate with a lot of character to it, however it was just quite my thing, not creamy, not melt in your mouth irresistable, just very cold and strong. The hot chocolate was interesting (I would recommend it above the shake) with a very very frothy head to it. Again it was very rich, but I think that combines better with a hot beverage than a cold one, not my favorite but different and interesting. Probably I should not have tried both because they are strong raw chocolate with a lot more power than the usual stuff and I ended up with a headache later, but I did not want to miss the experience. Overall the italian ice at another very well reviewed vegas desert stop was more to my liking, but to each their own. For $5-7 to try a chocolate item though this place will cost you a lot less than most things in vegas though, so it is worth a try to see if it is your thing.",wYcY7pDjH9cKzvPxMZBhqw,0,0,3,5YyqG1A8U4LMP3o6pXa6ig

For brunch, I ordered the the Huevos Rancheros Sunrise Burrito, Slammin Spicy Chicken Burger, and Chocolate Chunks Pizza (all shared of course, although I probably could've ate it all if I chose to). The burrito and chicken burger were both good, although I thought the burrito could've used more seasoning. Might have just been because there was more egg than anything else. The dessert was the best part! Although it doesn't look like anything special, it tastes great, especially with hazelnut bits and peanut butter.

2) WAFFLE FRIES dusted with cocoa and chili powder and chili mayo for dipping (4stars) - this was delicious, but absolutely not worth $6 b/c the amount was ridic. You get like 10 waffle fries. I suppose it's worth trying once, but I wouldn't get it again.

I have never eaten here however I have been here many times in the winter months for the sipping chocolate (please DO NOT mistake for hot chocolate) After my boyfriend being to Spain he told me about this kind of drink this is not quite the same but as close as he has found here in the US.  If you're wondering what it's like in Spain it is like a chocolate bar melted with a crispy sweet bread if you put it in it would stand on end.  This is ever so slightly more liquid but OMG good!  Pretty much a milk chocolate, if that is you choice bar melted down with milk added and put in a cup warm.

You don't need much at all.  The way it used to work was they had a little kioskey thing out front to just order and go.  They must have wanted to up the value of the property so that is now gone for tables for dinner.  You now have to go into the bar and order, this wouldn't be a bad thing but the bartenders are truly unpleasant.  I mean if you hate your job that much and you pouring a cup of chocolate into a cup for me and getting a tip for your unpleasantries and inconvenience is such a problem then please find a new job!  I hate the new layout and consider not ever coming back but sadly I like chocolate and I like it a lot in small portions so I will come back.

If you are a chocoholic, this is your Mecca!  You gotta love a place where the dessert menu is 3x bigger than the food menu!  Overall, this is a cafe you have got to try out NOW!

The regular food is so flavorful!  I have tried a lot of the menu and have enjoyed every bite!  I think the absolute highlight on the menu is the turkey burger.  Let me say that I do not like turkey burgers because I am all about my beef, but I tried a turkey burger when it was highly recommended by the server and it blew my socks off!  It was one of the tastiest burgers I have ever had.  That burger had the flavor of 10 regular burgers crammed into it!  To top it off, it comes with tasty fries that have cocoa powder on them.  I know it sounds weird, but those fries are so yummy and different tasting.

I also really like their flatbread pizzas. They have some ""normal"" pizzas and then some fun pizzas like the Southwest BlackBean pizza.  It was like having a party in your mouth with the different textures, flavor explosions, and gooey cheese to tie it all together. 

As for the desserts, where do I even start.  I mean the dessert menu is 3x bigger than the food menu.  The have hot chocolate, chocolate pizza, fondue, cookies, sweet waffles, milkshakes, and truffles, to name a few.  I'm probably forgetting some because the menu is THAT HUGE.  

Max Brenner is a mad, chocolate genius!!! The prices are a little high, but on par for Las Vegas Strip rates, speaking as a local. The staff all seems super friendly as well. Go check it out and get a shot of chocolate!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,2,2,4,iiNc29TM1pog00IZwlq8tg

there were several people at the table so I got to sample a few different desserts. i personally ordered the banana split waffle which was pretty much like a orgasm in your mouth!

4177565,2010-11-12,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"We went for a Saturday brunch.  I'm always looking for new places to brunch, and this one excited me.  Brunch AND chocolate?  What could be better?

Ambiance:  This place felt like an old English pub.  Very dark, with lots of wood.  It was cozy, but the chairs were not the most comfortable, especially the ones with arms.  If you are anything bigger than a size 12 or 14, you might want to opt for one of the armless chairs for a more comfortable dining experience.

Service:  Very nice and prompt.  Nothing special, but nothing to complain about.

Food.  YUMMY!!!!!   But WAY overpriced.  We started with mocha lattes, which was one of the best I'd ever had - rich and creamy and just total perfection.  But a very small portion for the $8 pricetag.  
  
Then we shared the Well Mannered Omelet ($14 I think)- and it too was delicious perfection.  There was so much goat cheese oozing from the omelet, and the side of potatoes were spiced just right.  It also came with a sugar dusted biscuit and chocolate dipping sauce...mmmmm.  So good.

We also shared the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes, and ate every fabulous bite. However, $15 for pancakes is just too much to spend, even being as delicious as they were.

My friend got the Max Brenner burger. (about $15 I think) She had ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well, but they quickly fixed it for her.  I didn't try the burger, but I did have several of her chocolate dusted waffle fries.  YUM YUM!  Who'd have thought....fries and chocolate?

Overall, I would have rated it higher except that it was just too overpriced.  I guess I should have anticipated that given there were no prices on the restaurant website. And I suppose it is par for the course for a restaurant on the Strip.  I might return one day for a special occasion, or just to share a chocolate dessert with some friends, but I definitely won't be a regular.",gAQnLgWU6ypEQXy-f5msAw,0,0,3,M2175kNofZi-jbinBJV8Yw

after we ordered our food we waited...and waited...and waited and saw other customers getting their breakfast (when they were seated about 10-15 minutes after us) and still waited. i didn't want to complain because it was our first hour in vegas and didn't want to start off the day bad, but i can tell that my friend was getting a bit annoyed and so was i. finally our waitress said that our food would be right out, after the guy who was seated 25 minutes after us got his food. finally the food came out...it looked amazing smelled amazing and tasted AMAZING. i was munching and enjoying every bite and at my 5th bite...i saw something thought it was cheese, but it was a long stringy curly hair....like i mean at least 4 inches long and it was disgusting. i barely ate my food, i was starving, but after seeing that you loose your appetite you can't eat. and my friend stopped eating. we told our waitress and she brought over the manager who comped both our meals. and told us to come back before our trip was over to use our groupon. he was so nice for comping both our meals we tipped our waitres $10 and was happy. i didn't want to yelp about this, but i have to explain our HORRIBLE experience the 2nd time around. 

on saturday we came here for lunch. our waiter was HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HOOOOOOOOOORRIBLE. juan didn't acknowledge us for 15 minutes, took our drink order, didn't come back for another 5 minutes, took our food order, which took 30 MINUTES AGAIN (yes other people ordered after us and got their food before us again), never checked up on us, took another 10 minutes after we ate to flag him down to get our check, he took my CC and walked around everywhere with it (which makes me paranoid about CC fraud) and after he had it for 15 minutes he then swiped my card i was ANNOYED. 

the food however was amazing, pricey, but hey it's vegas, but NOT WORTH IT I WILL NEVER COME BACK EVER AGAIN. i was so upset i'm not sure if it's because we're asian or we had really BAD luck, but it was horrible and i am upset that i even had to spend a penny there. i will NOT recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy their vegas trip and if you do come here watch out for hair and say no to juan.

p.s. they also take away your food even though you're not finished happened both during breakfast and lunch. even though my bf didn't want to eat his meal he wanted a bite of the ""famous"" biscuit w/ chocolate spread, but the waitress just took it away after the manager ok'd the comp and juan took away my plate right when i was about to eat my fries...ugh i'm still super annoyed -_-;;",YslR3U1iwphOFYqvwSZ4cQ,2,1,1,vd0ZwxzitTQOE0apyuoy6A

It was chocolate heaven and the company we had next to us were also very nice and charming so our experience at Max's was wonderful.

Our server was on point and was very patient with us. What we ordered was:

1) Meaty, Crispy, Cheesy and More Pizza - bacon, pepperoni, chorizo, salami, roasted red peppers, garlic, onions & mozzarella

2) Cinnamon Apple & White Chocolate Truffle Cream French Toast - brown sugar spiced pecans, warm toffee sauce

The food came out in good time and it filled me up real fast! It was delicious. The pizza is semi-thin crust and lots and lots of sauce (which I love!!). The French Toast was perfect- not too sweet, not too bland.

Immediately upon walking in, we were transported to a magical chocolate factory! Honestly we took about 20 minutes before we could decide what we wanted! Too many good choices. 

I ended up getting the prosciutto waffle sandwich with a side of their famous waffle fries! The sandwich was bursting, and really worth the money. The lemon aioli was really tangy and flavorful, and the prosciutto was super tasty! My only complaint is that it was a little dry, and could have used more aioli. The waffle fries were really crisp and nicely seasoned, and the chili mayo dipping sauce that came with wasn't too bad either! We also got a cup of the chocolate ranch which was really interesting, and went pretty well with the fries! 

My girlfriend got the white chocolate French toast, which was AMAZING. The French toast was nice and fluffy, yet crispy on the edges as they should be. The white chocolate came in a cool little flask that you could pour over, and was really good quality chocolate! 

Overall, I think Max Brenner was a really great brunch place, and we are definitely coming again! My only regret is that we were too full to try the desserts. (We were really craving the shakes...)

4239914,2013-12-02,2,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"What isn't there to love about chocolate? If you've got a sweet tooth like mine, nothing. White chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate and chocolate with all kinds of extras....I've seldom met a chocolate I didn't like.

Max Brenner is serious about chocolate, serving his delicacies in ergonomic mugs molded to be held for maximum enjoyment and coffee cups with kangaroo pouches for chocolate. He even serves his French Fries with chocolate. That is my kind of guy!

Our tummies were rumbling for savory food, so we started with macaroni and cheese and a pulled pork sandwich before diving in for dessert. The portions of both were generous and both were delicious. The mac and cheese is served with bacon and tomato and has the perfect crusty, crumbly layer on top. The pulled pork had a barbeque sauce that was just the right amount of sweet and the chili chocolate fries were the icing on the cake. Knowing that we were going to order copious amounts of dessert, we cut ourselves off early and ended up saving leftovers for lunch the next day. This was easy to do as the portions were large.

We had the fondue for dessert and it came with two choices of chocolate as well as caramel. We had been debating between traditional fondue and the option that included graham crackers for smores, so our server suggested adding graham crackers and voila, the best of both worlds!

We literally loved the white chocolate to the point that my husband actually scooped it out of the fondue pot and ate it solo, and the caramel in the middle made for perfect pairings with the fondue accompaniments (marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, etc.). I have to say that if he hadn't scooped up the last morsels, I probably would have!

Max Brenner's story is fun (read it on the menus), the decor is whimsical and the food is great. It's definitely worth a stop, whether or not you have a sweet tooth, and will definitely earn you ""brownie points"" (Ba-dum-ching) if you happen to treat a friend or loved one who has one!",q2NZ70jWHUkZVcC8Mj5tig,2,1,5,_STPjVdgoRhPVBAAVxiFRw

4260570,2010-12-17,2,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Ever since the Yelp event, I had this place in mind for the company holiday luncheon this year. At the last/most recent Yelp elite event at the Republic Kitchen bar, the question I asked most of the people that I met, was if they had gone to the event- and for the most part, the consensus was yes, and they all raved about it (because the food was sooo good). 

Today, it was a group of eight of us from work. The appetizers we sampled were: chicken, bacon and cheddar rolls, onion rings- both served on long heavy wooden platters, and a cheesy mac casserole- served in a round skillet. We all shared a creamy chocolate milkshake (yeah, it sounds funny, but this way we all got a taste plus we wouldn't ruin our appetites either- our server brought extra glasses and metal straws- never saw that!). 

The sandwiches range from $12.95 to $14.50- served with waffle fries dusted with chili and cocoa powder, different, huh? Ok, it sounds weird, but it actually worked- it was just enough chili powder (mmm, love spice). The dipping sauce was yummy. Since I went to the yelp elite event which was primarily mini sizes, I didn't know what the standard sandwich size was- so I ordered the Max's sandwich of the seas- seasoned salmon( flavorful), carmelized red onion (so sweet- I love red onions), aioli, tomato and lettuce on a huge bun (I had to ditch the top side; it was just too much bread for me). My coworker sitting next to me, had the Brenner burger but only had half and she took off the onion rings (saved the other half for her husband to enjoy later for dinner). The coworker across from me also had the Brenner burger and said that it was good- but he didn't really eat his fries, so my other coworker ate them; he had the monte cristo sliders served with syrup (cute little things- only two though; but he ate one, and took the other one to his wife- this would be an appetizer size rather than an entree, I'd think), another coworker had the quesadilla, cut in quarters, served on shredded tortilla strips- he finished it and said it was really good, another coworker had the philly paninis (four petite things- I had them at the yelp event so I know that the beef is super tender- probably one of the best things I had at the yelp event), another coworker had the Best Balt- bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, cilantro-avocado mayo (I glanced at hers- there was a lot of avocado- I love avocado). We all had non-alcoholic drinks. The bill was a little over $216. 

Half of our party was sitting on the booth part and the other half were sitting on chairs (they had to put tables together- the wrought iron bottoms were kind of awkward; had to rest my feet on top of them, or risk getting my feet crushed!)- we were in the front of the restaurant, facing the store part and kitty corner from the hostess out front. Our heads (the ones at the booth part) were near the stacked humongous blocks of chocolate ($250 each!). Our server was so good about tending to us and really was attentive, bringing us refills, extra napkins and clean silverware. The other servers were attentive as well, taking away all the dirty plates and serving dishes. It was pretty busy in the restaurant- the whole shopping center was buzzing with shoppers/tourists. (FYI: Taking the back way- Frank Sinatra- is a breeze.) The bathroom is located upstairs. In addition to the chocolate store inside the restaurant, there is a to-go bar outside (chocolate pizza slices sold here), facing the foot traffic inside the shopping center.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,6,4,5,LNrDNdnCjgZXWeFefD4rpg

We split the Kobe burger which was incredible and the waffle fries reminded me of my childhood. We were in a big group so when we ordered dessert we literally order EVERYTHING. My favorite was the chocolate pizza and the smore's. I have a feeling they add addictive substances to their food. It's sublime.,BquCQH35BwhmKoegkEzC1Q,1,1,5,CRZAQ99dg0Q5EiFESIouXQ

4277031,2013-08-14,4,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"I don't know if it's our bad luck, but Loren F and I keep going to these hyped up places and get let down by the just ok food. 

Max Brenner is located inside the Forum Shops and is known for their dessert menu, but also offers a variety of American fare. We came during happy hour (M-F 3-6 and 9-close.) So maybe that's partially our fault for only trying a fraction of the menu. 

Here's the breakdown of the food:

Mojito
$6 for happy hour drink inside a casino is a steal. Drank 2 of them since I was thirsty, but then again I never have just one drink during happy hour. Good amount of mint and lime, way too much syrup. I had to try and squeeze out as much lime juice as I could so I wouldn't be drinking diabetes. 

Brenner sliders
Eh. Also $6 for happy hour. Came with 2 mini sliders and about 5 waffle cut fries. Completely underwhelmed by the taste. It's a burger that could be found at a normal place like PTs. Nice presentation though. 

Chocolate chip walnut cookie
Pretty massive cookie. Came with a side of whip cream, strawberries and a mini glass of chocolate syrup (which I wanted to put in my purse BTW.) Cookie was full of chocolate and walnuts, but again nothing that would knock my socks off. I dropped part of it on the floor as I was cutting it and my response to that was ""there's goes $4 on the ground."" It was only a small piece, but just the concept of dropping such an expensive cookie on the ground just ruffles my feathers. 

All in all, I came for the experience of just trying new places. Don't know if I'll be back, but it was fun.

4300197,2010-10-31,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"The wife and I decided on Max Brenner as the dinner location for our wedding anniversary. She was urged by a couple of her colleagues. Since it was a Wednesday night, we figured we would have no problems getting in and having a good dinner.

When we arrived we were hit by the wonderful chocolate smell that came out of the restaurant. It wasn't an overpowering smell, and it wasn't the smell of cheap chocolate. This was the good stuff. We were seated under the stairs corner ""booth"". The place wasn't that hopping, but again, it was a Wednesday at about 7:30pm. However, we did see a constant line at the hot chocolate bar. 

We opted to not get hot chocolate or milk shakes as we didn't want to spoil our dessert after dinner. I ordered the margarita panini  and the wife got the veggie burger. Both sandwiches came with waffle fries. These waffle fries are some of the best fries I've ever had. The aioli dipping sauce was also incredible. My panini was spectacular. The bread melted in my mouth, and the cheese and veggies were perfect. The portion size wasn't too big, but if you eat the fries and are getting some sort of chocolate, it all evens out in the end. My wife's veggie burger was amazing. The veggie patty was homemade, as in, not some frozen nastiness. You could see some of the veggies inside (edamame!) and the patty had a very nice crisp to it. The bun was also incredible. Very buttery and a perfect compliment to the patty. 

For dessert we had the peanut butter euphoria. Homemade dulce de leche ice cream, peanut butter ice cream, toffee bits, caramelized bananas and bits of nut. The sundae is massive. We couldn't finish it. Every ingredient stood out, and nothing was overwhelming (except the size). Euphoria is a good name for this dish. It was epic, and almost life changing. It was a tough decision as to what to get, but we are glad we went with this one. 

I was pretty excited about the price for the food. For our two entrées and the shared dessert we were only set back $45 (not including tip). The desserts are the price of the main dishes, but I think on the Strip that is totally worth it. 

The service at Max Brenner was also top notch. I would expect this at a Strip restaurant, but sometimes we just aren't lucky. 

They do have a chocolate shop above the restaurant. We didn't hit it up this time, as we want to save that for a time when we have family in town.

After a whirlwind night of partying, my friend and I were looking for a spot to wind down and have some sweets. Max Brenner became our pick after Serendipity had too long of a line. 

Max is located across the GIANT H&M inside Caesar's Palace (is it the real Caesar's Palace?). The minute you walk into through the doors you can smell the chocolatey goodness. But, if chocolate isn't your thing they have a lot of savory food choices as well. But where Max really shines is obviously in the desserts. 

WHAT WE ORDERED:
White chocolate and strawberry smoothie: Incredibly rich and actually a tad overwhelming! I think it tastes better once it melts down a little. The consistency makes it hard to drink at first.

Fantastic Popsicle Chocolate Fondue: After seeing the picture in the menu, I was intrigued. What a fun creative twist on a fondue! Unfortunately, it no longer features popsicles. It is now plain old vanilla ice cream in a waffle cone, but you still get to sprinkle your choice of toppings on it. 


Max Brenner's chocolate is SERIOUSLY one of the richest chocolates I've had to date. Normally, I'm a sit down and eat 3 bars of dark chocolate kind of gal, but I can't see myself pigging out on Brenner's stuff. 
Bonus points for having a mini shop in the corner where they give free samples! Way to fatten me up Brenner!

I'll definitely come back just because the menu is SOOO massive and I'm really intrigued by his waffle fries and cocktail items. Until next time Mr. Brenner!",S6SvF-lP1Gdt1jeHpgsrEg,0,0,4,SARYHMNCWMTA2jxQdx-OhA

Having done my research on Yelp beforehand, I already knew that I was not going to leave Vegas without trying Max Brenner. Located inside The Forum Shops (part of and right next to Caesars Palace), parking was a little confusing at first because The Forum Shops has its own parking lot that's separate from Caesars Palace's parking lot (you have to circle down around the Colosseum). 

Max Brenner was surprisingly empty on that Sunday lunchtime..and that suited me just fine! Also, I was not expecting the restaurant, which looked unassuming and average from the front, to be so big and spacious inside. They had chocolate-themed decor inside (chocolate ""pipes"" running across the ceilings and walls, posters featuring chocolate, jars of candy/cookies, etc (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pMUkSaVSD9zUcP5KG_mOhA&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw)) and nice couches for people to lounge around, although I'm not sure when you will need to lounge around unless you're waiting for someone in the restroom (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CutljJ3FFNhZLodcz9Y48Q&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw).

Even though it was empty that day, service was still kind of lackluster. It took us forever to flag down our waiter to place our orders and get some cups of water...and there were only three tables that were seated in the whole place! I noticed that the other tables were having trouble getting the waiter's attention as well. Anyway, after we placed our orders and got our food, we hardly noticed the slow service because the food overtook our mouths, our minds, our conversations, and our souls.

Banana Split Waffles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ywqLRT_IZ8bQwUx1KUVkpg&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - Even though I would categorize waffles as a breakfast item, Max Brenner placed its waffle dishes in its dessert menu, so be sure to look through all their menus before you order! The waffles were amazing. Even though the portions look small, it was actually very filling. There were so many components to this dish I didn't know where to start! The caramelized bananas were super delicious and together with the crunchy chocolate-covered rice krispies, chocolate syrup, and creamy ice cream made the waffles send me into cardiac arrest and fly up to heaven!

Guilt-Free Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2y5M9yOwQwEUDYB98aMaNA&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - So, we all know that Vegas is a fattening city. I don't even want to think about how many calories I took in just from the endless alcohol drinks and buffet food. It was only natural that my friend and I decided to appease our guilt by ordering the Guilt-Free Omelet. My friend substituted the eggs for only egg whites (at no additional charge!) and the omelet was amazing. Cheesy and fluffy, and filled with all these veggie goodies. The potatoes on the side were okay, but I liked the herb seasoning on them. The biscuit was AMAZING! Soft, buttery, and so so so good with their chocolate sauce (hey, cannot escape Max Brenner without tasting their chocolate)!

Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B51pIQ9RY-J-A1tBHQtLWg&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - Yes, there is THAT much chocolate that they had to put in the word chocolate 3x to do the pancakes justice! I would recommend that you split this with at least 3 people (and that is if you're only planning on eating these pancakes and nothing else) because they are huge and densely soaked in chocolate and syrup. Yummm..I can totally see why such a thing would be illegal, even in Sin City..

Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=U05QfAZxZE0yhI1PaPogaA&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - At first my friend tried to stop me from ordering yet another fatty item, but I was determined to try a milkshake here. They had so many options (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zSuQ9qhGuAJbbxRuhhVgcw&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) that I could not for the life of me believe I had to narrow it down to just one. Alas, I chose the Hazelnut Cream one because I love hazelnut in my coffee, in gelato, in anything. It was put in a cute ""Drink Me"" (Alice in Wonderland, anyone?) cup and my eyes popped open the second I took a sip. Best. Milkshake. Ever. Imagine Nutella in a milkshake form, but 100x better.

My other friends ordered a Brenner Burger (with Kobe beef), which came with some tasty cocoa-dusted waffle fries, and the waffle sandwich, which I was too full to try.

I normally don't go for fried food, but my party wanted to try them, so why not? They were amazing! The fried outside was surprisingly light and crisp, and the inside was gooey with cheese and corn goodness. The sauce was addicting! I had to stop myself from licking off the plate it was so good!! It was like a mayo type sauce, but 100 times better. 

Drinks:
I should say I'm not a huge fan of chocolate in general, but I wasn't about to be the Debbie Downer of the group, and I never shy away from trying something at least once. So, I was a good sport and tried the Mexican Spicy hot chocolate. The server of course asked if I wanted milk or dark chocolate, and because I was feeling adventurous that day, I asked for half milk and half dark. Bad idea. Sometimes being adventurous just doesn't pay off. My hot chocolate came out to be spicy and bitter. Not a very good mix. However, one of the girls got the thick Italian hot chocolate, and that was delicious. Probably because it was all milk chocolate. Note to self: never get a dark hot chocolate. It just doesn't make any sense now that I think of it. Why would you choose a bitter flavor in a sweet drink?

Another girl in our group got the chocolate Chai tea. I've never had Chai tea before, but my friend is an avid Chai tea lover, and she claimed that this was the BEST Chai tea she has ever had. I tried it and I must say the Chai flavor is very strong, and it was pretty yummy for a first timer. I'm definitely getting this next time.

Food:
When you begin looking at the extensive menu, it can really be overwhelming because everything just sounds so good. Even for brunch, I was torn among the breakfast skillet, the cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast, after party belgian waffle, and the guilt free omelet. I finally narrowed it down just to the savories because it was that kind of day. I ended up choosing the burrito because other girls ordered the skillet and omelet. When you think breakfast burrito, you think big. At least that's what I think when I order a breakfast burrito. I imagine stuffing myself in egg, cheese, and whatever goodness is in the burrito. To my huge disappointment, the burrito came in a tiny serving. I can almost compare it to an egg roll. That's how disappointed I was. However, looks can be deceiving, and that's exactly what I realized after my first bite. The burrito came already cut into two, and each opening was sprinkled with cinnamon or nutmeg. It was a sweet spice that I couldn't decipher, but it complimented the burrito well. They used a red tortilla that was probably tomato flavored. I couldn't tell because you really don't taste any special flavor from the tortilla. 

The burrito stuffing includes farm fresh eggs, spicy chorizo, tomato, and pepper jack cheese. It's served with spiced home fries but I substituted it with the waffle fries. My first bite was absolute heaven. The perfect amount of egg, cheese, and sausage. Not too spicy and not at all too many flavors. Everything worked together, and I just wanted to say good things do come in small packages. Sometimes. 

The breakfast skillet was a pretty large serving, and it was absolutely what you would have expected: an egg hash scramble with sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushroom, and their home fries. It's nothing new but still delicious if you want to be safe. I would say the same about their omelet. Serving was big, and it was expectedly a good omelet. 

In the end, we were too full to try any of their desserts, but we all decided it was worth another trip to Vegas just for their desserts one of these days. Overall, if you're here for food, you MUST try the corn croquettes. The best I've ever had. The burrito was delicious, but order only if you're feeling adventurous and beware of the small portion. I was full in the end, but that's because I also ate part of my sister's breakfast skillet.",qIqHUdv0tl9QlaOaZGvz0A,0,0,4,O53sgIjD7t6jj2cl46nZ6Q
4414654,2012-07-30,3,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"It's located in the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops.

By no means am I taking anything away from Max Brenner by saying this but go for the desserts and not the food. Why you ask? First off, for you chocolate lovers this is your mini Willy Wonka type store front you've been searching high & low for. Don't even bother with that overrated Serendipity outside Caesar's Palace. That place is a joke especially when you have this spot not too far away in walking distance. Second, if you order too much food off their regular menu, you may not have enough room to fully enjoy their sweet delicacies at the end. The food food was good but nothing spectacular. The quality of their chocolate is for sure up there and the dessert menu itself will blow you away. When we first sat down, we all reached for the dessert menu before the food menu. We spent most of the time looking it over back and forth.

Off the bat, the décor of the place should stand out. Back in the day this store was actually a club that I visited once. I'm glad that they got rid of that and Max Brenner took over its spot. A little trendy, lots of chocolate theme props, and the never ending aroma of cocoa beans floating about especially in the downstairs part of the restaurant.

They do have a couple of cocktails and mixed drinks made with chocolate and your favorite alcohol. It will however will run you about $12-13 per drink. We went with the shakes instead. The Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake ($8) - vanilla ice cream, dark chocolate truffle is worth mentioning and should not disappoint if you so order it.

For dessert (to share), we had The S'Mores Concoction ($11) - marshmallow fluff, milk  chocolate mousse, graham crackers, caramelized bananas. This looked like your 11th grade science project more then anything. Even the grid looking palate it came out on reminded me of being in class again. Every prop used for this dish will make you nostalgic of those days you use to pass puppy love notes in class to that cutie you had a crush on. Personally, it was fancy to look at more then eating it. It was good but I probably won't revisit it again.

The Melt Chocolate Truffle Heart Cake & Shake ($14) was the winner. Milk and white chocolate heart cake served with a creamy vanilla ice cream, red berries, and an iced milk chocolate shot. That shot of chocolate is crack like. The chocolate heart cake reminds me a of lava cake that is perfectly complimented by the vanilla ice cream. You pour the milk and white chocolate yourself so you have the option to go easy or douse. Again, this look was very appetizing but the taste of everything worked well together in perfect harmony. I want more of that stupid shake shot! 

Honestly, there's just too much to order from their dessert menu. Whether it be a variety of hot chocolates, to hand dipping your own ice cream bars (which they were out of on this day), to their infamous fondues, or crème brulee/waffle dishes. The possibilities are endless. I don't think one trip to Max Brenner is sufficient. That is why I say go for their desserts and that's it.

Remember, I'll forewarn you that it's not a cheap place to grab dessert and the portions are quite petite. What they lack in size makes up in taste and presentation. You will feel like a kid in a candy or in this instance, chocolate store.

Also, check out their $5 cookie out in the front stand if you don't want to go in and sit down. Yes, its $5 but it's a damn good $5 cookie. If they close the stand, just walk to the bar inside the restaurant and ask the bartender for the $5 cookie, they'll know exactly what you're talking about. It may not seem like it was worth it after the initial bite but you'll soon be asking for more of it. Yeah, it's legit son.",tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,4,2,4,oHvX1Drd1XC7bHtfxOedOw

Its located inside the forum shops where I have never been to, so it was fun walking and touring inside. 

Getting to max brenners, we got there overly excited from looking at yelp pics all week, and all the food did not dissappoint! We started our food marathon with all of their hot chocolate drinks, one stood out was the white hot chocolate and the salted caramel shake. It was unbelievable. Then we all tried the yelp recommendations for the main dishes. Burrito was delicious, the pancakes though were nothing special. Not as chocolate-y as I was expecting and very dense for pancakes.

Came back the next day for desserts, and had twice the fun. All of them are good, although ordering all of the fondue was overkill, they were all still mighty good. Had the churros fondue, very small servings for the desserts btw but still good.

D and I make it a habit to have dessert at Max Brenner every time we find ourselves in Vegas. We first discovered the bald man about 3-4 years ago in NY and we were glad when they finally opened a location in Vegas.

I am a creature of habit and always end up ordering the Melting Chocolate Truffle Heart but since we came here on New Year's Day , I figured it's time to try something new! I went for their S'mores Concoction presented in a medium sized bowl with 4 layers of goodness inside it: The bottom had melted milk chocolate, followed by graham crackers, gooey marshmallows, white chocolate shavings and topped with about a cup of whipped cream! It was served with a beaker of caramel sauce, chopped caramelized bananas and a miniature s'more with roasted marshmallows on top.

The dark wood decor is perfect for the chocolate themed restaurant, the fake chocolate pipes were a bit cheesy, but the delicious sweet smell is worth a visit alone.

The menu is also huge, (think Cheesecake factory).  Unfortunately, we were tired since we just landed, and plus we had a hard time finding our way to the restaurant in Caesars forum.  We missed breakfast and we were both starving, so, we went straight for the savory food menu and picked the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet.  We also ordered the Pearl Sugar Chocolate Waffle for something sweet since we were at Max Brenner.  First the bad, the skillet was AWFUL!  The whole thing was a greasy mess topped with cheese.

The waffle were a tad on the dry side but the chocolate syrup was enough to compensate for it.  The presentation was neat.  They used a tiny beaker for the chocolate; adorable!

4451962,2011-09-07,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"This will be my review of my Restaurant Week 2011 experience with Max Brenner.

I made my reservation for a lunch at MB with my mother. I truly wanted to take her out for Restaurant Week and seeing that MB had a yummy sounding cheeseburger I knew it would be right up my mother's alley. 

We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and we were seated promptly at a very, very small table for two. The table was just... small. I don't know what to make of it. That's the main reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating. Especially considering the large plating options they use here I just wonder who thought such a small table was appropriate for dining? Drinking lattes, sure, but for full-blown meals? No way!

Our server seemed delighted that we would be taking part in their RW menu, she asked if we wanted wine, but my mother and I both declined and got Ice Teas instead. Once we took a look at the menu, it was obvious we would each order something different and share. So, with that being said, the following is what my mother and I ate:

Crispy Spice Dusted Pita Chips with Creamy Hummus
Chicken, Bacon & Cheddar Rolls
The Brenner Burger: Max's secret barbeque sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar & vidalia onion ring on top, came with waffle fries, dipping sauce, and pickles
The Unforgettable Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich: tomato, lettuce, pickled jalapenos, crushed bbq chips brushed with cilantro & avocado mayo also came with waffle fries, dipping sauce, and pickles
Chocolate Chunks Pizza (1/2 serving) with hazelnuts and roasted marshmallows
/Banana Tempura Fondue: warm & crispy banana bites, pure milk chocolate dip, toffee sauce 

The hummus and roasted peppers that came with the pita chips were very good and the peppers were an excellent addition. The burger was delicious. I can't compliment the chefs here enough on how well they cooked the burger to my mother's specifications, medium well. The spicy tuna salad sandwich I think I could eat everyday and it has practically changed my mind about tuna sandwiches all together. If every restaurant could make tuna like that, I would eat it every time I go out.

I felt as though the pizza was not as good as it is hyped up to be. The dough/bread was the downfall for me. Yes, it is clever and cute, but when it comes to taste - meh. I personally think everyone should go with the fondue! Because the banana tempura was out of this world! 

I will definitely be going back to Max Brenner to eat off their regular menu now. Plus I want to have a milkshake and other desserts! Overall this was a great experience.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,4,Or-r7GGE2W2wVHCXe-RHPg

The ice cream was delicious and a nice accompaniment. My absolute favorite part, though, was the milk chocolate shot. My goodness that was good!!!  Mmmm.

I started off with a Mint Hot Chocolate while I waited for The Unforgettable Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich. The hot chocolate was really rich and full of flavor and there was a perfect balance between the chocolate and the mint. My Spicy Tuna came with tomato, lettuce, pickled jalapenos, crushed BBQ chips with cilantro and avocado mayo. You have to really enjoy spicy food to appreciate the sandwich. This also came with waffle fries that were dusted with chili and cocoa powder. It didn't come with that many fries but the meal was still very filling. 

The dessert was the big star of the show! My sister in law, cousin and I shared the Classic European Chocolate Fondue . It's supposed to be made for two but this can be easily shared with three people. We chose milk chocolate, white chocolate and caramel for our dipping sauces. The chocolate was really good but my favorite was the caramel. It's the best caramel I've ever tasted! It's not like me to choose caramel over chocolate but it was that good! It came with cookies, marshmallows, strawberries, chocolate cake, and bananas for your dipping pleasure. My favorite was dipping the chocolate chunk cookie in the caramel. 

I also like that they have a gift shop on the premises because I had a chance to shop for my Secret Santa for work.

We went to brunch there on a lark while on a trip to the Apple Store in The Forum Shops.  I'd passed by once before and had heard good things and the brunch menu looked tasty. A little on the high side for breakfast, but we figured for the Strip, it wasn't bad and decided to give it a shot.

First, the smell. Oh sweet holy moses on the halfshell, it was DIVINE. The smoky smell of bacon wafting through the restaurant mingled with the rich cocoa scents and it was all just... sublime.

Our server was Brenda and she was fabulous. Attentive, bubbly, not overly hover-y, she didn't rush us and she had a charming, dishy way about her that I loved. I could drink with her.

I had the Huevos Rancheros Burrito which was scrambled eggs, chorizo, tomatoes and pepper jack in a red pepper (It was red, I'm just guessing) wrap.  It was served with some glorious house potatoes with a chipotle sour cream drizzled on it with pico de gallo. The whole thing kind of made my eyes roll into the back of my head. My toes were curling. I'm just sayin'.

He had the Lazy Breakfast of scrambled eggs, chorizo & onions with a side of the same potatoes (sans orgasmic chipotle magic). It was also served with a sugar-dusted buttermilk biscuit, a dish of softened butter and a ""lick"" (a small dish) of melted milk chocolate, which he added to his biscuit with the butter.

He loved his breakfast, but after tasting my burrito, wished he'd gotten that, but still raved for several hours about how good breakfast was. The sugared biscuit with the butter and the chocolate combo was brilliant.

We finished up, he with an 80's shake (vanilla bourbon ice cream, milk chocolate shake with a hard chocolate shell) and I with a Mexican hot cocoa (with cinnamon, nutmeg and other stuff).  Both perfect cappers to our meal. 

We left full, satisfied but not sluggish and with plenty of leftovers which I whipped up into breakfast tacos for dinner last night.

Our tab was $48, which is about double what we'd normally pay for breakfast, but we don't normally have milkshakes and frou frou cocoa with it, either.  But we both agreed: WORTH EVERY PENNY. (Especially since we got dinner out of it, too.)

I had an old Groupon that expired but still good for the original $12 I paid to purchase it, so my friends and I came for an after-dinner snack.  Our waitress was very nice, but at first, she said I couldn't use my Groupon since they had no way of verifying whether or not I used it before.  However, the Groupon stated the original value never expired, so she spoke w/ a manager (again) and said I could use it.  Dang right!  They were able to scan it at the end anyway and verify it was good, so make sure to insist to use your expired Groupon if you are denied the first time!

I got the half-sized pizza with roasted mini marshmallow and hazelnut bits ($9.75).  The thing is exactly like a pizza, except for the toppings.  My friend thought the bread was too doughy (it's just like pizza dough) and preferred it to be thinner.  It was super sweet, and we could only eat a small slice each.  I prob wouldn't get this one again.  My other friend got an Espresso Shake while the other friend ordered the Banana Hazelnut Crepe ($13.95).  The crepe was really large and super sweet as well.  It was really good, though.  I'm not a huge fan of crepes since I lean more towards crispy food than soggy, and I find crepes to usually be more of latter than former. The shake was also delicious.  You could taste a slight hint of the coffee, as it was not overpowering.  It was not thick at all, though, and more like melted ice cream.  I would have preferred it to have more of a shake consistency, which it did not at all.  

Prices are pretty steep here but the desserts are more than enough for at least two people.  It's a great place to go for anyone with a sweet tooth.  The chocolate was also very good!

We knew we wanted to get the Blackened Skirt Steak and Mushroom Quesadillas again!  Man this dish is seriously a piece of heaven.  The cheese, meat, mushrooms, and three different sauces all marry together into a mouthful of deliciousness!  Our new course for this visit was the Pasta la Mancha.  It was a decent dish, but nothing will ever satisfy our Max Brenner savory cravings like the quesadilla.

The place comes with desserts a plenty.  We've tried the several of them and like the Melting Chocolate Cake Souffle the most.  A number of different shakes to try as well.  You can even buy several items and of sweets from the gift store inside.  We snagged ourselves some Alice cups to take home.  

Only 4 stars cause the decor and ambiance just wasn't like it was in NY.  But don't get me wrong, we'll definitely make it a point to stop by at least once (if not more) every time we're in Vegas.",PPA4Dy7lrt8il6L8Tkd6Eg,0,0,4,_I6Zem0euxg6M_gOAFQ0Nw

Although I am a fan of chocolate and great customer service the 3 stars is based on the food. I think Max Brenner has good food but it is not great.

I had the Mexican omlette, a pizza made with mozerella cheese, a dark hot chocolate. The Mexican omlette was nothing special and the egg was over cooked, the pizza was the only thing I really liked and the hot chocolate was way too sweet even though I requested steamed milk to dilute it a bit. I think I actually ruined my hot chocolate by adding milk. The first few sips were heaven but it eventually got too sweet where I didnt want to eat my main course. I suggest you save the hot cocoa for dessert.

The customer service was impeccable. We were served by a friendly staff that checked on us every few minutes and were happy to cater to our every need even though we asked for numerous little things like steamed milk, moving to another table, extra utencils and plates, etc.",W7sQ50m0VADz-RD2To4YNQ,3,3,3,mL5B7s3J3l4LFJGIpplu-w

My reply: ""I already have it planned out.  We're going to Max Brenner.""

After parking the car at the hotel, we wandered over to the Forum Shops at Caesars, where Max Brenner is tucked away near the back (across from the mega-H&M).  The place was fairly empty at lunchtime, so the two of us had no problem scoring a second-floor balcony seat overlooking the crazed capitalism going on below.

Even before our server came by with menus, we were intoxicated by the chocolate aroma that permeates the place.  We were hungry even before we sat down; once the chocolate tickled our noses, we were ravenous.

The menu is ginormous.  There is enough ""real"" (non-dessert) food to pull you in multiple directions.  The dessert menu is even worse -- it's practically an encyclopedia of drool-inducing chocolate delights.

To start, we ordered the grilled chicken panini.  I'm a sucker for a great panini, and this one was more than just great -- it was heavenly.  Gooey cheese, a nicely crisped roll, and the most intoxicating tomato aioli.  It was served with a side of waffle fries dusted with cocoa and chili powder, which is possibly the best twist on French fries that I've ever enjoyed.

We also shared a side of white corn croquettes.  These beautiful bites were absolute perfection.  Crispy panko breadcrumbs on the outside, silky smooth corn and manchego cheese on the inside.  I could eat dozens of these and never tire of 'em.

As amazing as the these were, the single most revelatory dish was dessert: chocolate chunk pizza with hazelnuts and bananas.  It's as decadent as it sounds.  I've never had anything else quite like it.  And, obviously, the best way to wash down chocolate is with more chocolate, so I sipped on a ""hug mug"" of Mexican spicy hot chocolate, which ranks among the finest hot cocoa ever.  (I loved dessert so much that I had a cookie to go -- thanks for the tip, Michelle T!)

The Max Brenner gift shop is almost as fun as the restaurant.  Lots of free chocolate samples there, along with surprisingly reasonably priced dishware and boxed chocolate to go.  The best part: chocolate moisturizer that makes you hands silky smooth while smelling like an ice cream sundae.  (Yeah... I took some of that to go as well.)

Can you tell I'm completely bowled over by Max Brenner?  Next time I'm looking for lunch in Las Vegas, I'll definitely be returning to this veritable castle of chocolate.  Take it from this chocoholic's mouth: Max Brenner is a no brainer.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,11,9,5,4k4U-AjwlLk6dTbCGRW3jw

There are too many crepes that simply become homogeneous flavor globs of thick sweetness (see: Jean-Philippe), so I was wary. To my surprise, the banana hazelnut crepe with the rice krispies had some great layering of textures and flavors. Plus points for creativity with the customizable add-ons served on-plate, although the presentation could be better and more cohesive. But still - a great crepe, one that makes my top 3 list. 

I like the atmosphere - it's understated for a Strip dessert joint, not too typical French, but not too hipster, either. It's a nice balance between casual and charming. The service is patient and friendly, though a bit lacking in the details - while our server was very personable and engaging, she did fail to provide us options for our order (dairy milk vs alternatives, type of chocolate, etc). I'd rather take that technical error than a fundamental issue with service, though, so overall the staff seems good. 

Also appreciated the extra step they took in their tea service, using the new-style infusers with actual loose-leaf. Too bad the measurements were way off though, because the tea was excessively strong, which, flavor-wise, was the low point of my visit. This place just needs a little tweaking in the details, it seems; they've got some fundamental things right already!

I've been a few times (as my check-ins reveal) to purchase gift items, such as their chocolate-filled syringes, but I haven't been back to dine in. I finally had my chance last night as we sought out a dessert destination to satiate our post-Hot n Juicy appetites.

If there's one thing you can say about the bald man, it's that he sure knows how to make a dish look purty. I mean, Crystal Sugar Churros Fondue, Chocolate Chunks Pizza - it all sounds pretty delicious to begin with. But the way those desserts come out to your table, they're just a work of art.

I'll be honest. I'm not a huge fan of how the churros are prepared. I want a plain churro that actually looks like a churro. To me, the churro is merely a vessel for the chocolate. I don't need it to be covered in sugar, but I do need it to have the deep grooves on the side by which it will receive the chocolate and transport it to my mouth. Partial fail on that.

On the other hand, the pizza was delectable. I'd name more dishes, but I really don't remember what everyone ordered. All I know is that this place beats Serendipity3 hands down.

She asked us to wait, which was fine but when another couple who made reservations as well checked in, she seated them before us! We were seated outside next to a large group. Our server was overly sarcastic and not so friendly. Onto the food... We ordered the penne pasta with chicken. It wasn't amazing. Ordered the heart truffle cake and shake and our server left before my boyfriend could finish the remainder of our dessert order! Tried to get his attention and he half-turned his head and said to us ""oh I hear you what do you want?"" as he turns back to multitask. Umm, kinda rude! So then a couple minutes later, the server comes to take away dirty utensils and give us new ones. He neglects to switch out my fork and I catch him before he leaves, handing him my fork and telling him it was dirty. He proceeds to give me a fork and says ""umm here's this one.

We got a table upstairs right by the balcony as our group was fairly large. Our server was very attentive and sweet. For drinks, I got the dark chocolate mocha....sooooo amazingly good! I've also had their regular dark hot chocolate before and it definitely doesn't disappoint. Whatever you order, definitely try something from the chocolate drinks menu! My favorite thing besides the delicious chocolatey drinks are the cute and clever cups that the drinks come in. I love their hug mugs as it is made for optimal drinkability and warmth! I even purchased one of the hug mugs so I can repeat the wonderful experience at home!

For food, I ordered the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate pancakes. OMG!!! If you love chocolate and pancakes, this is the dish for you! The pancakes come with dark chocolate shavings, caramelized bananas, spiced pecans, and more melted white chocolate for drizzling! I was definitely in chocolate heaven after my first bite!

Our dinner date coincided with filming for the Food Network show ""Kid in a Candy Store,"" so not only did we get to indulge in scrumptious sweets, we also were filmed for the show while eating it  :-D

I HIGHLY recommend the Banana Split Waffle...imagine this: a delectably perfect belgian waffle + creamy vanilla bourbon ice cream + carmelized bananas + crunchy chocolate rice krispy balls + a mini jar of Max Brenner's famous melted chocolate (for dipping) -- TIP: You MUST ask for a side of the peanut butter sauce, it is seriously delicious and goes great with the waffle. 

I am salivating just thinking about this. We came back a second night in a row JUST to have this same dessert again. 

We also tried: 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae: bananas, rich chocolate and dulce du leche ice cream, peanut butter sauce, whipped cream, nuts...seriously, how can you go wrong? You get your money's worth with this sundae, too. It is ginormous. PLENTY of dessert for two. 

Meaty, Crispy, Cheesy Pizza: It is as the title suggests. We ordered this because we felt like we should put a little ""real"" food in our tummies before stuffing our faces with chocolate.

We were seated quickly and each given three menus to consider... and probably drooled on all three.  The options for chocolate lovers are overwhelming and deserve time and consideration before committing to order.  Even with our late arrival, we were never rushed to order.  At one point our server seemed ready to sit down and join us to discuss all of options we were considering.  I wish she would have!  

The nights were starting to get a little windy and chilly, so the hot chocolate was perfect in both taste and comfort!  I wish it were bigger, but I also realize that if it had been, I wouldn't have been able to eat even the little bit that I did have.

Overall, all of the things we sampled (one appetizer, two entrees and a sundae) were great!  Each dish was artfully prepared balancing flavors and textures.  The corn croquettes were crunchy and creamy, sweet and spicy - just perfect!  

The S'mores Sundae... Wow!  We were stuffed when we ordered it, but you can't come to Max Brenner's and not do dessert!  We probably should have started with hot chocolate and the sundae and called it a night!  The melted marshmellow and chocolate ice cream together was amazing!

On to food. The corn croquettes were really interesting. They're basically fried cheese balls filled with creamy corn. I loved the lightly fried crispy texture, and the filling was perfect, a good mixture of sweet and spicy. I also had the mac and cheese, the portion was huge. This is not a saucy mac and cheese, it's basically macaroni pasta topped with a variety of shredded cheeses, tomatoes and bacon and then baked in a skillet. I would highly recommend this if you're a cheese lover. 

Don't skip dessert here! Max Brenner seems pretty well known for chocolate. I was eyeing the fondue, but we ended up getting a s'mores sampler instead, which was as delicious as the hot chocolate.

I know it's a sweet spot (pun intended), however, I've only had dessert once (we're always much too full from our meals). That doesn't mean you don't consume chocolate though - he is the ""Chocolate Man"" after all. Seating is available in their ""outdoor"" area, inside (surrounded by the bar and shop), or upstairs. All the seating is enjoyable with the upstairs dining area to be the most desirable (spacious and a bit more private).

My favorite items from ""Things to Dip"" are The Smoky Dry Rubbed Chicken Wings ($12.25) with creamy bleu cheese sauce, Waffle Fries dusted with Chili and Cocoa Powder ($6.95), and Black & Tan Beer-Battered Vidalia Onion Rings ($6.95) with dark chocolate ranch. Really, really, really delicious! The onion rings didn't produce the same fireworks as the other two dishes, however, that dark chocolate ranch is seriously amazing. Can I get that with everything?

""For Your Hands"" choices, The Brenner Burger ($14.25) with Max's secret BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and vidalia onion ring and The Best B.A.L.T. ($14.75) with crispy bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and cilantro-avocado mayo, are both amazing. Same goes for their ""Perfect Paninis"" - the Grilled Chicken ($14.75) is made with goat cheese, spinach, tomato, and black olive pesto and the ""Margherita"" ($14.50) has oven-roasted tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella, and a tomato-basil aioli. They all come with the addictive chili and cocoa powder dusted waffle fries. Drool.

""Max's Flatbread Pizzas"" are also really good and great to share. The ""Meaty, Cheesy, Crusty, etc"" Pizza (no longer on the menu) had Italian sausage, pepperoni, peppers, and crispy basil. I've also had the Ricotta & Mushroom Pizza ($13.25) with black olives and sun-dried tomato pesto.

The Really-Cheesy Really-Crunchy Mac & Cheese ($15.75) made with a special 5-cheese blend, tomatoes, and smoked applewood bacon on the ""With a Knife and Fork"" menu is crazy good. I'm not even ""Mac & Cheese"" person and I would never have ordered this dish (thank goodness for Ruben), but wow. I couldn't stop eating it. The Sunday Mood Pasta ($15.75) with fresh tomatoes, spinach, ricotta, and tomato-pesto sauce is also, as you can guess, delicious.

I've only been here for ""Max's Brunch Therapy"" once and I had the Hang-Over Omelet ($13.25) that came with a scrumptious diamond-dusted sugar buttermilk biscuit, spiced home fries (YUUUM), and pure melted chocolate (YEAH). You would only raise an eyebrow when you read chocolate with an omelet until you've actually had it. See, you don't need to order dessert.

But, of course the desserts are amazing. I had their popular ""The Fantastic Popsicle Fondue"" that comes with vanilla ice cream popsicles that you dip into pure melted chocolate, Choco-pops (love these things!) and candied hazelnut crunchy bits ($8.50 for one, $14.50 for two). Interactive, fun, and tasty.

I could go on and on about the food (I already did), but if you need guidance to just one item, it would be the waffle fries. I know it sounds silly, but they're so yummy! The chili and cocoa powders plus the mysterious ""fry dipping sauce"" really makes it pop.

Their menu is extensive so it can be hard to decide what to get.  We decided to share the Margerita Panini ($14.50) and the European Classic Fondue ($23).

The wait for our panini took awhile.  But I must say it was quite tasty for something so simple.  It was filled with mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and tomato aioli.  I think it could have done without the aioli since it made it so messy.  The cocoa and chili dusted waffle fries were so good!  They were perfectly fried and potatoey and the spicy and sweet worked well.  We were finally ready for our fondue.  It came with two choices of chocolate so we choose dark and white chocolate.  It also came with a third dipping sauce, a toffee one.  We both liked the toffee one.  Our dipping items were: strawberries, banana slices, marshmallows, banana bread and another cake.  We enjoyed the fondue and our waiter even asked us if we wanted any more of any dippers, but we were too stuffed.  It was a good fondue for sure.  I guess think everything should have been a little cheaper, but then again, it's on the strip, so it's expected.

After all the hype, I was ready to give this place a try!  We set up a reservation and arrived with our table waiting and ready.  It was about 9:30 pm on a Friday night and we wanted dinner, drinks, and of course we wanted to try the chocolate.  I started off with the White russian and it was really good.  We also ordered the Peach Lemonade which was good, but nothing special.  For food, we started off with the Creamy Spinach & Artichoke Fondue and we tore it up, we both really liked it.  For dinner, she had the Angus Beef Brenner burger with bacon and I had the Really Cheesy- Really Crunchy Mac & Cheese with Chicken.  Both the dinners were awesome!  I really enjoyed the Mac& Cheese and it was a huge  portion.    This is when the service went from good to horrible.    

Our server basically vanished around this time, but finally showed up and we packed our to go plates.  They were out of the special order fantastic popsicle, so instead of the fondue,  we ordered the banana split waffle for dessert.   The waffle was cold and didn't have much flavor, but a fork full of banana, waffle, chocolate, caramel and ice cream was really scrumptious.    By the time the server showed up we had eaten about half of it ( it was plenty for two).  So i mentioned to her that the waffle wasn't warm at all, and she replied ""but the banana was warm right? ""  and walked away.   She brought us our bill and then vanished for about 15 mins,  we gave our payment to another server finally and we just wanted to leave at that point.  Overall, it was decent.

4725782,2012-05-25,1,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"I'm not a chocolate fanatic, but I loved Max Brenner! You really can't go wrong with this place. The location--Caesar's Palace The Forum--is great. Our server (Desiree, according to my receipt) was so friendly and helpful. And the food--not to mention its presentation--was amazing (for the most part).

I came with two friends and we got two apps/sides to share:
1. Molly's White Corn Croquettes: house seasoned white corn & manchego cheese balls dusted in panko bread crumbs & lightly fried
-- OMG I loved these! I tasted mostly cheese and only a hint of corn, but that was fine with me! We got the full order (8 croquettes) and it comes on a long glass dish that has grooves for each of them. They are nested on top of a bed of chili mayo sauce and MAN, that sauce is mmmm delicious!
2. Waffle Fries Dusted with Chili and Cocoa Power
-- These didn't blow me away, but they also came with the mmmm delicious chili mayo sauce which complimented it perfectly. I mean, I love fries of all kinds, so I loved these waffle fries, but I feel like I love the sauce even more...

As for entrees:
1. Keri W. got the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet: farm fresh eggs, sausage, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, spinach, home fries & mushrooms seasoned and scrambled together served with a house baguette
-- I only tried a little bit, but it was good. She really liked her dish. It came with a small side bowl of butter and one of chocolate. She's a traditionalist and loves her bread with butter, but when she tried it with the melted chocolate... she didn't go back.
2. GH got the Chocolate Chunks Pizza (half-size): Max's double chocolate melting chunks & a choice of 2: crunchy hazelnut bits, bananas, peanut butter or roasted marshmallows; she chose bananas and marshmallows since I'm allergic to nuts
-- Looking at the pictures, I kind of wish we had gotten ""The Works"", but that would have been much too much! I ate 1/2 of a slice and that was more than enough for me. It was too chocolate-y! And very sticky in the mouth. I gave GH my pecans and she said that helped, but she wondered how sticky it would be if someone ordered peanut butter! :P Anyway, it is because of this dish that GH also agrees that Max Brenner gets 4 instead of 5 stars. We both really did not like the crust. We were told it was a ""thin crust"" so we were thinking the nice crispy thin crust pizza-esque crusts... but this was like thick pita bread. Didn't like it. So glad I did not order this.
3. So what did I get? The Cinnamon Apple & White Chocolate Truffle Cream French Toast: brown sugar spiced pecans, warm toffee sauce (obviously got the pecans on the side)
-- I love cinnamon, apples, white chocolate, and french toast. So guess what? I LOVED this dish! It was a bit heavy, but also quite a bit heavenly ;)

GH also got the Mexican Spicy Hot Chocolate (red chili, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper) and she greatly enjoyed it. And I think it's so cute that it comes in the Hug Mug! Adorbs.

But now that I've read Misti Y.'s review, I have to come back! I want to try their BALT since I love love love avocadoes, and she also makes their lemonade granita sound amazing.

This girl was not quick..she was very very slow.
Finally when the food arrived his grilled mac & cheese was cold. Thankfully he did not care. She offered to take it back and warm it up but there was no way he was going to go for that. He was hungry.
We finally order the chocolate pizza for dessert after waiting way to long for her to come back and check on us.
The pizza of course takes forever & I am trying to keep my kid from climbing the walls. Once it gets there tho my kiddo is in heaven. He tore into that pizza. He was in heaven.

There was once a bald man, Max Brenner, in New York.  He made great, delicious things out of chocolate.  Like all worldly people, Brenner traveled to the city of up and coming culinary geniuses, which happened to be Sin City as well.  As one finds when coming to Sin City, a deluge of spirits run through the streets; one can hardly avoid the potency.  Of course, Brenner married the two ingredients in a little white chapel, which later bore 'Luxury Truffles.'  These truffles balance spirits and high quality chocolate. :)

(fictitious, I know.  I felt my inner storyteller crying out.)

The waffle fries are some of the best in town! They are actually tossed in cocoa powder and served in a great sauce! 

I most enjoyed the tea. Yes, the hot tea. They serve it in a fancy glass device they steeps it and then it strains it directly into the cup. It was incredibly unexpected and neat. I have since been to Teavana to try and find a similar item.

Our server Brenda was helpful and friendly.  She took time to make suggestions, answer questions, and even let us try some peanut sauce when we started talking about lettuce wraps.

If you are looking for unique ways to cure a chocolate craving, this is the place for you!!  

The Mexican Hot Chocolate was delicious.  That little bit of chili kick at the end made for a delicious spicy surprise.  One friend ordered the Berry Lovely made with chambord, raspberry sauce, and white chocolate  We were all sneaking sips of this unique drink.  She liked it so much she had another.

The banana split waffles were FABULOUS!!!  They waffle had a caramelized  crunch that was soooo yummy.

I had to go with the ""Feelin Good About Yourself"" Turkey burger.  It was SOOO good.  The mushrooms, swiss cheese and caramelized onions were a great combination with the extra large bun and burger.  The criss cut fries with cocoa and chili powders were good too!

The BEST part of the meal was (believe it or not there was still room) the S'Mores sundae.  Thank you, Brenda for the suggestion.  HEAVEN in a glass!  It was a blending of chocolate ice cream, chocolate fudge, graham crackers, marshmallow fluff, and peanut butter!!!!!!!  I wish I could have eating it all, but my butt and thighs are glad I didn't.

This will be a DO NOT MISS next time I'm in Vegas.  ENJOY!!!",5BbQRGHlyIUNGhXPJLyCoA,0,0,5,m7Sj55l_hy6tSt1iqWUCiw

First of all, we didn't get our water until we waited for 15 minutes and asked for it but that's no biggie. Then we were approached 3 times by different waiters to ask if the food in their hands is what we ordered which wasn't. That was annoying. We waited for around 15 minutes for the food that we actually ordered to come and i wasn't disappointed at all because the presentation was mouth watering. 

However, when we  were about to dig in we realized we didn't have any utensils and i wasn't planning to eat with my hands so we informed the hostess about it. Instead of an apology, she simply turned around and grabbed two forks for us without saying anything. But we needed knives too so when our server came, we told him we lacked utensils, he simply replied ""oh okay"" and turned around and got some for us. No apology.

My boyfriend ordered an omelet with waffle fries. The waffle fries dipped in chocolate was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I've never had anything like it! Who knew fries and chocolate go so well together?

I got a tutti fruitti waffle and it was waffles with fruits on top dusted with icing sugar, mint leaves, ice cream, a mini jar of chocolate and chocolate wafer balls. I loved my waffle so much. Everything went SOOO well together. The punch of flavour from the mint leaves is just perfect. This dessert wasn't too sweet either.",Jf3EkyDJzpHG5d37iacdpw,1,1,4,9Fb6fd6dHqTWyP2zs9FObQ

The good:
- Location: Love the Forum Shops area, makes for great people watching and window shopping to and from dinner.
- Price: Four of us shared one appetizer, three entrees, one dessert and one coffee for $75 (including tax and tip) and we were STUFFED.
- Quality: The veggie conscious burger was perfect, with a bread soft enough to allow you to really enjoy the juicy veggie patty. The spicy waffle fries were cooked perfectly. The chicken panini was nice and juicy and not smashed like most paninis I'm used to. The spicy chicken and cheese pizza was very big and could easily feed two, maybe three people (the goat cheese was a nice touch). The caramel concoction dessert was very nice (since we're Indian we love spice anywhere we can get it and here, the combination of mousse, white chocolate and spicy peanuts was memorable).
- Quantity of food: The burgers are HUGE and while you dont get a large side of fries, you get enough to fill yourself up. The panini was hearty and the pizza was large also. Comfort food indeed!
-Service: Fast and friendly!

The bad:
- The cheese croquettes. For $7 you get four measly quarter-size croquettes. They were tasty (panko crumbs) but incredibly over-priced (shocking because everything else seemed reasonable).

I named him Ryan throughout the entire time, and what do you know, his name really is Ryan. Hey, maybe I can be his Ashlee, but we all know how that went.

The pizza was not as good, it fell apart as soon as I took a piece and it wasn't as crispy. Fondue is always as good, and as usual, my marshmallows were caught on fire several times. As long as my food is edible, I'm good. And I must say, I've never had so much fun with chocolate until now. I was making splatters and drawing with chocolate, being a kid is good again.

One was available for $24 worth of food for dine in only - the cost was $12.  After reading reviews, I was very excited to go, although the Groupon was restricted to 1 per table (there were going to be 4 of us in my party).

The Saturday I was in LV, the restaurant closed at 12.30am, and we got there at 12am.  Our server, Ryan, was nice, but I was trying to determine whether he was slightly annoyed that we came in so close to closing time.  After he gave us menus, then returned to see if we had any questions - it took asking so many questions to get some information out of him on what was good, etc.  At one point I felt bad asking so many questions - but if you're not forthcoming with information and we're overwhelmed - what do you expect?!  Anyhow, we finally settled on the Profiterole Fondue, an Apple Waffle and 2 Apple Crisps (pics coming soon).

After all the drama from perusing the menu and trying to decide, everyone in my party was spectacularly impressed!  The serving sizes were plenty for 1 person (could even be shared with 2), the flavors were decadent, and the chocolate was as perfect as I could imagine.  I had the fondue, and couldn't even finish it all because it was so rich.  Don't get grossed out, but it was so rich, I thought I might get sick at one point if I took another bite...and I still wanted to it was so good!

We were celebrating a birthday, so once we determined we could eat no more - Ryan brought out a tiny plate with a candle and a square of chocolate - a nice touch!  With the $24 Groupon, the bill came to a little over $50 - so it's a pricey place, but worth a once-in-a-while visit.

One bonus of being the last customers - another server asked us if we liked cookies.  Of course we said yes, and she she then brought each of us one of the large chocolate cookies that they were going to toss.  They were so thick, and they were warm!  We all decided to take them on the plane with us the next day, and I was so glad I did.  It was de-li-cious!

All in all, I was very happy I discovered this place.  I've been to a chocolate bar before in DC - but it can't compare....Max Brenner is simply the bomb.  Oh and the decor was so fun!

We thought this would be the perfect place for DD (turning 9) on her bday, since she's a chocoholic. Everything started out promising, with oodles of chocolate drink selections from which to choose. Both her and her younger bro ordered kids' oreo shake. Not sure they used real oreos, as the flavor was off. Strike one.

While waiting for food the four of us really wanted water. (We all ordered specialty drinks, but sometimes you need some water to counter the sweet.) Should be simple enough, right? Hmm. Where's our server? Any server? Bueller? Bueller?? Ten minutes later, we finally get someone's attention. (Mind you, the place wasn't tremendously busy.) Strike 2.

Kids were SUPER excited about the ""decorate your own pizza."" Menu said it comes as a cheese pizza with lots of toppings with which to decorate. The pizza arrived on a cute wooden board, with a small dish of about 5 cherry tomato halves. Nothing else. Not olives. Or pepper.  Or anything else. Seriously? Just a few tomato halves to ""decorate"" a kid's pizza. Strike 3.

On top of that, the food was barely mediocre (think fast food, drive thru quality despite steep sit down prices). The Greek salad was more parsley stalks (yes, stalks) than lettuce, the ""feta"" was unflavorful, the dressing was off, the olives were small smashed pieces.

The onion ring batter was pretty good, but the rings were greasy.  And a big no-no in my book: they were ordered as appetizer, but took forever and showed up seconds before main entrees.

The kids' pizza was a bit greasy, unflavorful and had a soggy crust. (Think Pizza Hut thin crust sitting out too long.)

The club sandwich wasn't bad at all. If you are suckered going into this place, it's a fairly safe bet.

The focus of my visit was purely on the hot chocolate. The edible ordered was originally viewed as only an incidental to me, and only being added for nourishment. Hence, why I chose to pair my salted caramel hot chocolate with the (gigantic) fruit parfait.

I really believed the parfait would be watery Yoplait with a couple strawberries and stale granola, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The base was a very thick Greek style yogurt, the mixture of berries had a beautiful aroma of orange and honey, and the topping of dark chocolate shavings was a fun and well paired addition. It was a wonderful breakfast which didn't fill me up so much that I couldn't enjoy my hot chocolate. Possibly a smart choice for you as well if you'd like to enjoy one of Max Brenner's sweet sippables without being sickeningly full afterwards.

My salted caramel hot chocolate was to die for. That amazing little ""hug mug"" of rich, creamy, and dreamy drink had me almost falling out of my chair. Perfection in a mug. The chocolate was intense, but not even slightly bitter, the caramel was not even close to cloying, rather it was buttery and nutty, and the salt was gentle and balanced out the sweetness of the proceeding. To say the least, I was very satisfied with this as my morning treat, and I was very, very happy to finally be experiencing it.

So, the savory options at Max Brenner tend to run all over the rating scale, but I can tell you all that you're safe with the hot chocolate if nothing else. It's raved about for a reason.

THe fish itself was COVERED in black sesame (as in crusted), and you couldn't even see any inch of the fish from the top. The taste itself was SPOT on. The combination of the sesame and the awesome aioli really had an authentic and delicious taste to it. The wasabi aioli didn't really taste like wasabi or aioli, but a bit like honey mustard. That combined with the black sesame seeds really hit the spot. The only gripe I would have is that the salmon itself was a bit overdone and was hard and a bit more chewy. I really hope that they work on this because this dish was SO close to being perfect! 

 Service was great; super attentive and friendly. Would go back for the salmon *IF THEY WORK ON NOT OVERCOOKING IT!!!* :)",TfaNjaJFkK9Dz9zPfKm8YQ,1,0,4,rgEWdm0zT9NjopIEQ-ZNxQ

Mind you I'm sort of a pessimist but I'm glad my friends and I came here on a random note! Service here is great, ambiance is great as well! My friend and I were waiting for a couple or more friends and they were nice enough to have us sit outside of the restaurant while checking up on us occasionally (with water!). I don't like servers who are all-up-in-yo-beeswax, but these servers did it just right. :)

Menu is a good size, and I had quite a difficult time choosing because I wasn't craving anything specific. I went ahead and ordered their chicken satay for appetizers and steak quesadilla. -- HEAVEN. Chicken SO delicate it melts in your mouth, complimented with extreme sauces. Garsh. Steak quesadilla cooked in a specific way and drizzled in a wasabi-mayo dressing I believe. So good. 

Max Brenner is also known for their specialties in sweets such as chocolate but their main dishes already satisfied me. I have yet to try their sweets. I have no doubt their sweets will NOT wane in comparison to their main dishes.

So if ever you're around a Max Brenner with a couple of friends, try it out. You will have no regrets. Trust.",73Fr0L-euanFlnhQlUkdTg,0,0,5,iT3SF2eAASLWAUfDk1DosQ

4995026,2011-01-15,2,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"This is the story of how we saved $12 with a Groupon. The story starts late one night online. Groupon had a $12 for $24 deal so the purchase was made with the idea that LA is only a few hours from Vegas and we'll be out there in the six-months before the Groupon expires. Well time did what time does and the expiration date was fast up on us so a trip to Vegas was planned. Another couple was found to join us on the adventure and we made our plans to stop by the outlets to shop and then go here for dinner. So pretty much we drove to Vegas for dinner just to save $12. Doesn't make a ton os sense but it turned out to be a really fun day that was highlighted by some tasty grub and chocolate.

So we drove all the way from LA to Vegas for dinner, that's a lot of pressure but Max Brenner lived up to the hype we had built up for it. The Unforgettable Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich is actually unforgettable mostly because they put crushed up bbq chip in the sandwich which is something I've done after a night of drinking but never thought I'd see it in a restaurant. The Waffle fries that come with it are dusted with cocoa but I just didn't get any of that flavor. Maybe my taste buds had been over worked by the jalapenos from the sandwich. Next time I want to try the turkey burger, i hear it's bugerlicious. 

The little lady does this disgusting thing where she will order a pasta with alfredo sauce and not only ask for extra but ask for extra extra and she usually has to ask for more. i swear she should weigh 400lbs and no longer be a little lady. She of course asked for this when she ordered and I was amazed that when it came out she didn't have to ask for another side of alfredo sauce. The friends that were with us also ordered a pasta dish so there was some making a comparison between extra sauce and normal person sauce was easy. They didn't drown the pasta in alfredo but there was a little extra. I think it's because they have good hearty sauces and you don't need to drown pasta in it to get the goodness.

We were all pretty full after dinner so we decided to share a dessert. Even though we wanted to try so many of the sweets they have we figured sharing the Crystal Sugar Churro Fondue would be the easiest to share. We all agreed that we could have done without the muddled raspberries but really enjoyed the chocolate and caramel sauces. Don't judge us but after the churros were gone we might have dipped a knife in the sauces. fat kids at heart I tell ya, fat kids at heart.",0zQtyBiwOnuacNuk7sJpxw,1,0,4,Orob2BI4XMbQB2Jf5un7IQ

The ice cream on top and rice krispies pieces were a great touch. 
The chocolate egg roll was fantastic. You get 3 eggrolls and have 2 dipping sauces, chocolate and caramel. The caramel was way too sweet so i stayed with the milk chocolate. Once you bite into the eggroll, be warned that you will make a mess. there's chocolate that will ooze ooze out. there's banana and peanuts inside. the peanuts remind me of thai peanut sauce so you have the savory with the sweet.

The Yelperazzi and I weren't sick of each other and did the HH after a Yelp event and shopping. 

I just wanted a small snack and got chili coco waffle fries. It was perfectly crispy and the seasoning on it was tasty. I wouldn't say it screams ""this is chocolate"" but just a hint of cocoa flavor and has a more smoky savory flavoring from the seasoning and the chipotle mayo it comes with. I saw they also do chocolate ranch dressing so I asked for a bit to try. It was a good ranch, but that really didn't taste like chocolate at all. 

I got my order not put in or something despite being one of the first to order and while waiting they gave me a extra mini philly. They made too much apparently. Those were really surprisingly delicious. I didn't think I had room for it, but I made room. I have to come back for that again. Two come to a order and theres a small paper cone with a tiny bit of waffle fries between them. When I mean little, I mean like 2-3 for a taste. 

Everyone seemed to all enjoy their food and cocktails. Service was good and friendly from the bartender. 

I've had their savory food once during a Yelp event (one of the best ones we've ever had, BTW) and definitely coming back for a meal and happy hour.

I had come by the day before to buy cookies from the stand outside of the restaurant. The cookies (chocolate chip with nuts) are amazing! They are pricey at $5 each but they are large and heavy! I was shocked at how big they were. So we decided to come back the next night for dessert before going out to have drinks.

We got the fondue for two which was, I believe $21.95. With the fondue we got strawberries, bananas, marshmallows and what looked like store bought brownies, caramel and two types of chocoloate (we got milk and white). The fondue flame was a bit out of control! It was sparking a lot and actually made me a bit nervous that something would catch on fire. I was even more nervous after our server told us that a previous diner's Louis Vuitton bag caught fire a bit after a spark landed on a napkin then landed on her bag! I was like ""Umm, you can take it away now!"". Although I laugh/laughed about it, it could be dangerous though so you definetly need to pay attention. 

I felt that the fondue overall was kinda of basic and not that elaborate or special. It's easy to just cut up some fruit, get a few marshamllows and some Little Debbie brownies and put them in a bowl and melt some chocolate. I was expecting it to be a little more elaborate or to have a wow-factor. The overall experience of eating fondue and laughing about the out on control flame was fun and that did over-ride the lackluster service and fondue.

I would probably only go back for the cookies.",OdBdt2-gnbJLcjvyQ-0MZQ,0,0,3,gg25vnbZPqbakxRTKIUovA

Stopped at Max Brenner to pick up a gift for our casino host and had to come back for happy hour later in the day before we saw Absinthe. 

Happy Hour is the best deal. Half priced drinks and apps - BUT - they don't skimp on anything. Had a chocolate martini and intoxi-cake, which were two of the best drinks I ever had. We shared smores concoction and banana fondu, and both were extremely decadent.

The chocolate shop has so many great pieces. If you have any doubt, just ask them for a sample as everyone was very friendly and happy to assist with anything you need.",ZCWE1WBTbc6FsyT4ngLOAA,0,1,5,5Wn60SYdjxjumKk8B-V9Xw
5129271,2013-08-18,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Max Brenner (located on the 2nd floor of the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops) is famous for their chocolate and desserts - two things my family and I adore - so we were really excited to try this place. We weren't disappointed, but we weren't blown away either.

The chocolate espresso milkshake ($8) was really rich and creamy. I could definitely taste the chocolate and coffee in there; no bitterness from the coffee, definitely more like extra-milk-chocolate mocha than espresso. The whole thing was pretty filling, so you might want to share it with someone (and then you can split the price too!) The shake was served in a unique ""Alice"" cup, which they also sell in the store for ~$15.

The banana split waffles ($14) was a delightful combination of vanilla ice cream, lightly caramelized bananas, crispy waffle, warm melted chocolate sauce, and crunchy chocolate pearls. Again, you might want to split it with at least one other person - we split it four ways and that was enough for each of us. Otherwise it might be sugar-overload.

The double macchiato ($3.75), however, wasn't that great. It was served in a ""Kangaroo"" cup, which has a shallow curved side pocket where they put a few pieces of chocolate. Supposedly, licking up the melted chocolate at the end of your coffee will make you feel like a child again (or something like that...) But I didn't really see how the chocolate pieces added anything to the coffee (except for the price.)

There are a lot of other dessert options, including fondues, hot chocolates, and sweet crepes. Might be worth a try sometime, if you're willing to splurge a little.",pYQ0ndyhHZ43CYXSFbL_6A,0,0,3,yHywiaJvVf-b5ALEVbBrGg

If you have never been to Max Brenner, your sweet tooth has no idea what is coming!

If you come here during their dual happy hour at the bar, you will find a good amount of sweets and savory items for a clean $6.

Heard a lot about the Brenner Burger Sliders, but I wasn't too impressed with them personally. They were overcooked and the flavor wasn't too impressive. I much preferred the Mini Philly ($6 HH): Shaved Ribeye, 5 Cheese Blend, Caramelized Onions, and Roasted Pepper Mayo. These were good, much better than the burgers IMO. Great taste and the happy hour price of $6 was pretty good value!

And of course...the chocolate! The Chocolate Chunks Pizza ($6 HH): Max's Double Chocolate Melting Chunks, Bananas, and Roasted Marshmallows (1/2 portion). This was super rich, chocolatey and tasty in each bite. It was almost too much for me...overwhelming chocolate amazingness! I also tried the ""Smores Concoction"" which was mind blowingly good! Loved the milk chocolate mousse, but it was so rich that I started getting a headache LOL.

The food did not disappoint. It was delicious and I'm only sorry we couldn't have more.

And we couldn't have more because the service was just AWFUL. We were there on a weekend night that wasn't even busy, and it took them 15 minutes to get us napkins, another 15 for them to bring us more water (had to ask twice for both), and our dessert never made it to the table. We only had the chance to order one appetizer because our waitress didn't check back on us. Never got to order another round of cocktails either. When we finally decided dinner was over and maybe we still had some patience for the much anticipated dessert, another 20 minutes passed before my friends husband decided to get up to cancel that order and just hand them our credit card to pay for the bill.

With Restaurant Week drawing to an end, my brother and I decided to participate at least once before he left the city. When he suggested Max Brenner, all I remember thinking was ""Really? How mainstream, David."" Well, I was wrong.

For $20.11 (clever, by the way.), lunch was coma-inducing. I ordered the Southwest Caesar salad, the Most Orgasmic Tuna Sandwich Ever (not really named that, but should have been), and a Chocolate Pizza for dessert. For only a pretty Jackson, that was so much food. Jesus! My Caesar salad was basic - romaine, avocado, tomato, a Parmesan crisp and a chipotle dressing. It was quite a portion, enough to fill me up for the rest of the meal. Nothing too spectacular other than the fact that every bite was avocado-laden, rendering the dressing unnecessary.

The Tuna sandwich was seriously some good eats. Real tuna, lettuce, onion, and barbeque chips?!?! I must agree with my brother - whoever made that was probably high. But I loved every bite of it.

Lastly, I ordered the Chocolate Pizza with hazelnut bits and banana. It was good, but after watching the show ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Pizza"", it definitely didn't live up to the hype I expected.  

Thank goodness for Restaurant Week. It definitely broke my hipster notions of mainstream chain restaurants. It also definitely broke my caloric intake for the week.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,0,0,4,UP0CmO6ZE0_sfrZNbbYtnQ

Maybe because we went as they were closing, I was pleasantly surprised compared to NYC. Was happy to order a waffle salad entree (best of both worlds, really! must've been created by an indecisive woman haha).

5159259,2011-07-21,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"This is the first place I've eaten at in Las Vegas that I want to go back to the very next day.  First I got a free chocolate sample in the store, a chocolate covered praline, and I knew I had to eat here (I liked it better than Vosges which is at the other end of the Forum shops).  Then I got a great whiff of the giant decorative jars of spices and chocolates on the wall...it was like breathing wonderland.  Then my mind boggled at the drinks and dessert menu.  I ordered a burger thinking that if it was ok I'd probably eat half and still be able to have a drink and dessert.  By the time my burger showed up I had settled on a dark hot chocolate to drink.

The number of ways this meal went right is astounding.  Crisp, freshly-fried, well-spiced fries and a tasty spicy sauce.  The burger was really amazing.  It had several flavors perfectly balanced: buttery toasted bread, beer battered onion rings (amazing), flavorful burger pattie with grill marks, real chedder, fresh tomato slice and lettuce...and it went very well with the dill pickles on the side.  This burger was the best I've had in a long time, through the amazing composition and attention to details.  I just had to eat (almost) the whole thing and so I didn't have the appetite for a dessert.  The waitress was mostly attentive.  They even give a discount at the shop after your meal.  Everything I saw the servers bring out to the tables looked amazing.

It wasn't quite perfect (not comfortable chairs, music a bit too loud, burger was well-done even though they asked me if I was ok with medium, and the hot chocolate was about the consistency of milk (too thin for me)), but for prices on par with the Cheesecake Factory nearby I wish I could bring everyone I know to try it out.",JUp-cmMdfYWUBb3-vrNTAg,0,0,5,op23uCLMHd5oAJYgXMbh5Q

We went because my sister told us we should try it.  Apparently, she had a better experience with the dinner food than we did.  However, she did visit here about a year ago.  So something may have changed between then and now...  If you're going to visit, go for the dessert and chocolate drinks.  The dinner food was mediocre.  

I had the Mushroom & Ricotta Pizza which was a very thin crust.  I like this style of pizza but this one was not done very well.  It was papery and flavorless.  It tasted like it came out of a box from the freezer.  

My kids had the The King of Chocolate's Crispy Mac & Cheese served with a pool of tomato sauce (it wasn't actually a ""pool"" of sauce.  It was served in a plastic syringe).  They liked it, but it really didn't fill them up (and they don't eat all that much in the first place!).  The serving size was small and almost $9 for a kids' meal!  Yes, the food is on the pricey side for what you get.  

My husband had the Brenner Burger with the waffle fries.  The burger was actually decent, but nothing special.  It was just better than what I was having (the pizza).  The waffle fries were nothing special either.  Chocolate dust?  I looked and looked.  Tasted and tried my best find it but couldn't find any chocolate.  It tasted like the waffle fries you can get from Carl's Jr...  Sorry, but it did.  

We had the Mexican Spicy hot chocolate with dark chocolate.  It was delicious.  Pricey, but good.  Also tried the Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake because of all the positive reviews.  It was good, but we've had better.  It was nice to try these chocolate drinks at least once though.  

Why an ""A-OK"" rating and not a ""Meh"" rating?  Three words-- Banana Split Waffle.  OMG!!!  The only thing we at our table truly all enjoyed.  The waffle was crispy on the outside, soft in the middle.  This was cooked to perfection!  Ice cream, caramel, and chocolate ganache with bananas and the chocolate rice krispies were soooo good.  

So although we would never go back for dinner, we would probably visit again for desserts and a taste of different chocolate drinks.

Soon as I picked up my menu the girl was asking what drink I wanted. I asked her to come back seeing that they have a lot of chocolate drinks, and I wanted some extra calories today. 

So the prices turned me off about those good yummy sounding drinks, and I just got a coke, which was pricey  $2.25 for a diet coke sucks. 
I didn't want to spend too much, and It looked like I had no choice. I had a lot of good choices to eat. The menu items sounded so good, and I went with the Really Crunchy Mac n Cheese. 

I drank my coke quickly, and they asked me several times if I needed a refill but I really actually was worried that they would charge me an extra $2.25 for it, so I said no. 

The meal was ok.. I mean it was good don't get me wrong, but not the best I tried. Soon half way in the meal I bite on some seasoning, they had in the mac and cheese, and I hated it. I have tasted this before in another meal once, and I don't know what it is! I changed my mind as I was eating it and instend of ok..it was now bad because of that one little seasoning. I just stopped eating and hurried to check the menu for a drink, they could get the taste out of my mouth because it makes me sick to my stomach. 

I got a cookie shake to go that cost $7.75.
That was the best part of this whole meal was that shake! It was soo good! It had white chocolate cream and Oreo cookies! I would come back just for that shake! 

I think this place was decent. I just picked the wrong meal for me.  If I come back, I will try something with less ingredients.

And it didn't disappoint! The dessert *wowed* us more than the lunch items we ordered (turkey club sandwich and fish tacos) but the lunch items were still very good.

4/5 stars for the fish tacos (ordered with extra avocado). The fish was seasoned well, chipotle and blackened and a little burnt on the edges which I really liked.

3/5 stars for the turkey club sandwich (the bacon was extra crispy which was a plus). I felt that the texture/quality of the sandwich bread could have been better, or they could've seasoned the turkey more.

5/5 stars for the fries - seasoned with pepper and chocolate powder! Super delicious.

5/5+ stars for the chocolate lava cake with milkshake shot & homemade ice cream. PURE INDULGENCE! It was sooo good and well presented, thinking about it makes me crave some!

5199601,2010-12-08,19,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Let me break this down for you: Max Brenner knows his ABCs.

A is for Avocado: I know you're thinking I have the wrong place because the bald man is known for chocolate, and really what do avocados have to do with chocolate? I am not sure, but I do know that I have a new guilty pleasure: The BALT (the bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato sandwich). I am pretty sure there is at least an entire avocado on this masterpiece of a sandwich. I have pretty much stopped eating bacon, but I make an exception here. I tell myself that I am getting all of the good fats associated with avocados as I proceed to consume the entire thing. I rarely finish every bite of a meal, but I have finished this entire sandwich twice. Sad little BLTs, you can only aspire to be half as tasty as the BALT.

B is for Beverages: Previous to the arrival of Max, every single time I visited the Forum Shops I would become angry at the lack of exciting beverage offerings sans alcohol. I wanted a smoothing or an iced tea or something interesting and refreshing, and it simply did not exist unless you wanted to overpay for an Italian soda. Now, there is the ultimate refreshing beverage available for $3.50, a lemonade granita. It is a lemonade, mint slushy that is a magical elixir of refreshment. They also have smoothies and a wide variety of chocolate drinks. The hug mug is adorable, and the perfect little thing to cuddle during a little first date convo. I had a white hot chocolate with soy in a hug mug, and it was cozy.

C is for Cheese... just kidding, clearly it is for Chocolate: Honestly, I am not a chocolate freak, and if you see me here, it is because the BALT has been calling to me, but you will find plenty of chocolate goodness at the bald guy's place. 

I also really enjoy the music here. They have some great bossa nova numbers and other eclectic tunes that make my ears happy. The bar is also a great place to grab something quick and watch TV. There is only one TV, but the bar is small, so if you're sitting at the bar, you'll be able to see the TV. 

One last thing: They also know their Ws, which stands for Waffle Fries. Actually, if I had one complaint it would be that they don't provide enough of these cross-hatched beauties with their sandwiches.

Go for the chocolate. Stay for the BALT!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,27,22,5,vQzwxTuZzyOGX1P-KWf8tw

For my entree, I decided on the Sliced & Diced Steak ""Pillow"" Panini.  The bread, incredibly soft (not soggy) so that it doesn't scratch the roof of your mouth when you take a bite.  Inside the panini was just the right mix of ingredients of steak, onions, spinach, tomatoes, and asiago cheese.  So great, I could savor every part of the sandwich with every bite.

Then, for my DESSERT ... OH DEAR GOODNESS TO GRACIOUS the DESSERT!!!!  So many choices, not enough room to fit it all in.  Honestly, I had the hardest time picking knowing it would be a while before I could go here again.  After much deliberation, I chose the Banana Split Waffles.  Great choice, Tiff!  Give yourself a pat on the back!  Imagine it with me ... waffle, bananas, carmelized rice crispies (which I have to say turned out to be the best part of the dessert), chocolate wafers, and a chocolate syrup to top it off that I couldn't help but slather it all across this ultimate dessert.  Every bite was heavenly.  I also had a bit of the Melting Chocolate Truffle Heart Cake and the Deep Fudge Chocolate Cake.  Both equally delicious and mouthwatering treats!

I am not embarrassed to say that I looked forward to burping for the rest of the day because I could still taste the chocolatey goodness for honestly the rest of the day.

How have I not known about this place before?  Forget it.  Let's forget about the past, and start dreaming of the next time we'll meet, Max Brenner.",CZz9iFuILPC9FDYVG_zunQ,0,0,5,bILCzE5bPRjj2jdi7Ebqsw
5277636,2013-04-15,1,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"To me, Max Brenner is a classic American restaurant with chocolate as the main theme throughout their menu. Upon arriving at the restaurant which is located inside Ceasars Palace, I noticed a bold decoration on the interior and a nice setup outfront in which they called the patio. While the menu is extensive, it has a fairly confusing layout. After browsing, I ordered the individual portion of the Molly's white corn croquette. It came in six pieces - a perfect size for lil ol' me. This isn't exactly a healthy item nor overwhelmingly delicious but I enjoyed them just fine. 

I also asked for the Mocha madness and the Surprise Tiramisu. Both of these items came in little glass cups with tiny flasks filled with chocolatey liquid. The tiny flasks reminded me of the flasks I used to use for chemicals while working in a radiochemistry lab and that brought back unpleasant memory. Despite that fact, I bet some people find these items cute or whimsical. I thought that the Mocha Madness had the perfect amount of kahlua and sweetness, especially if you're an Asian who can't hold an ounce of alcohol to save her life. As for the Tiramisu, the white cream sauce was outrageously sweet I couldn't eat more than half a teaspoon and just gave up on it. Instead, I poured the chocolate flask onto the strawberry cup and really enjoyed the chocolatey fruit. I wouldn't recommend this Tiramisu item if you don't like overly sweet desserts.

Overall, I was a little bit disappointed at the chocolate items at Max Brenner. Chocolate desserts don't have to be overly sweet to be good. A good dessert must have a balance of everything and not be overpowered by a single component, which in this case is sugar.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,1,1,3,8x9jrrYJ12hKLkLVxAYVaA

Having experienced ""The Bald Man's"" chocolates in New York many years back and quite familiar with The Forum Shops at Caesars I really cannot explain why my substantial sweet tooth had never indulged at Max Brenner's eponymous Las Vegas restaurant, but a chance mention by a friend of the space's pending closure or relocation quickly set me to mend the oversight.  Two stories in size and featuring many things chocolate plus a collection of overpriced comfort foods it was just after 10:00am when we sat down at a cozy two top near the base of the stairs and treated to pleasant ""everything is good"" service typical to such places a five part order was hatched as the restaurant bustled, leaving one to ponder the reasons for any pending change.  With service swift it was only a matter of minutes before selections began to arrive, the first a superlative $8 milkshake thick with caramel and rife with vanilla but topped with copious whipped cream to mask what I'd guess to be an 8oz serving, a trend carried over to each plate that followed as large prices met small portions thankfully bolstered by bold flavors.  Starting sweet and following with savory due to a kitchen miscalculation it should be noted that each of Brenner's pure chocolates are well sourced, smooth, and complex by the bar and as such both white and milk versions only served to improve the Custard French toast and Soft Cookie, the later on par with that of New York's fabled Levain Bakery in terms of taste and texture (though at 2.5x the price) and while I think everyone would have been happier to see the Croquettes first I'd be lying if I didn't say they were my favorite bite of the meal - the paprika and manchego working smoky, savory magic on the lightly fried kernels.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,0,1,3,tIdlHR1RhN9Yh_RRKBi4Dw

That may be an exaggeration, but if it is, it's not much of one.  Nestled in the food courts of the Forums at Caesars, you'll find this chocolate lover's haven.  Hate chocolate?  Then starve!  Just kidding, there are tons of great options, and you never have to touch an ouch of cocoa.  But you disgust me.

Max Brenners are scattered throughout the world, and this is the closest one to Southern California residents (of which I am one).  The restaurant itself is straight out of Willy Wonka, except without the insanity.  The hot chocolate is piped throughout the building (not real, obviously, but very interesting to look at), and there are two levels of seating to guarantee that this place will never become completely overrun by customers.  

The menu is superb.  I've ordered the Oven Roasted Tomato Pizza and the Southwestern Caesar Salad, which comes in a funnel-like bowl/plate.  Both are excellent, and are better than one would ordinarily expect from a chocolate-centered property.  

But if you leave without ordering the waffle fries, you might as well have stayed at home.  They come with an addictive mustard-cocoa powder dipping sauce that tastes like God punched me in the tastebuds and said it was Good.  I always order an extra side (even though they are somewhat pricey), because someone at home is going to want a handful.  

They also have about a dozen coffee, hot chocolate, and dessert options.  Honestly, although these were good (I've had the hot chocolate and the classic milkshake), they're not the reason I keep going back.  I expect them to do their specialities well.  But you could skip actual chocolate and still have a memorable experience.

The service is generally solid, and they do take-out orders, too.  My fiancee and I have a pair of their ""Hug Mugs,"" custom-made hot chocolate cups that are laughably impractical but still fascinating.

Punch-line: go at least once.  I think you'll like what you find, whatever your tastebuds crave.",225NDJ7-g3ncEcv5-Lyc8w,1,0,5,RADQ4Ynq-3-FJ54FSATsAw

I was served  two scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone. There were three small bowls with it. In them was chocolate pearls, chocolate sauce and something I couldn't identify. I think it was browned coconut. I wasn't impressed at all. The chocolate was to fancy for me I guess. If I'm going to pay $8.00 for an Ice Cream cone I would like it to be more spectacular.

Hubs ordered the strawberry waffles.

THE WAFFLES.  Oh wow...they came with piles of whipped cream and shaved white chocolate on top!  On the side were a strawberry honey sauce that was absolutely diving.  My stomach just growled thinking about it.  There was also a little shot of chocolate sauce on the side...fresh strawberries stopped the 3 small waffles.  Hubs really enjoyed the dish and said everything went together perfectly.

So, whenever I'm at Caesar's Palace, I make it a point to stop by Max Brenner to get my chocolate fix.  They're always busy.  I'm not picky as to where I sit and enjoy my chocolate so most of the time, I eat at the bar so I don't have to deal with shenanigans.  Or you can also go to the chocolate shop attached to the restaurant and grab boxes of chocolates, shirts, chocolate-scented bath stuff, etc.  I always get tin cans of chocolate-covered pistachios and chocolate-covered hazelnuts.

I've honestly never tried their savory dishes.  Who needs a savory meal when you can have chocolate for lunch/ dinner?  My favorites are:

Hazelnut Cream Banana Toffee Crepe:
A nice crepe filled with chocolate hazelnut and sliced bananas.  In a small beaker, chocolate sauce to pour all over the crepe.  Caramel ice cream. Chocolate wafer balls.  5/5

Banana Split Waffles:
Crunchy waffles with banana halves topped with vanilla ice cream. A beaker of chocolate sauce and some chocolate wafer balls. 5/5

Chocolate Chunks Pizza:
A pizza with melted chocolate on top then 2 toppings you want: peanut butter, hazelnut, marshmallows and bananas.  Or you can get The Works to get all toppings.  I personally like hazelnut and banana.  5/5

Fondue:
You have 4 options:  tempura, sugar churros, classic European and S'mores.  Of these, I like the classic European because you have a wider variety of goodies you can dip into chocolate such as cookies, marshmallows, sponge cake, strawberries and bananas. 5/5

Horrible.  It's like our server knew she was getting her 18% either way so she kind of ignored us.  She came quickly with our water.  After about 15 minutes waiting to order, one of the food runners said he would get our server.  I don't think he did.  We finally saw her and flagged her down to order.  That was the second time we saw her.  The third was when our food came after what seemed like forever and the last time was for our check.  There was one point when they were bringing our food out and we had asked one of the food runners for ketchup.  He brought us 3 little dishes of ketchup and then the other side of the table asked our server for ketchup.  She looked over at us and said, ""Are you guys going to use all that ketchup?"".  Seriously, you can't walk back to the kitchen to get more ketchup?  The restaurant wasn't that crowded so there was no excuse for this service.  Oh and then when we got our change back, she shorted us 64 cents.  When we asked her about it she said she doesn't carry change.  Even if you don't carry change, you don't short people.  It should be the other way around, give them extra.  Yeah, sure, it's only 64 cents but after the experience we had, it was just the icing on top of the cake.

The Food ---
The food was good.  I got the Max-ican omelette.  It came with Swiss cheese, salsa, black beans, avocado and a side of home fries, a biscuit and a dish of melted chocolate.  The chocolate was bomb, not going to deny that.  The omelette and home fries were also good but not outstanding.  The butter that came with the biscuit tasted like air so the biscuit was pretty dry.

Chocolate Chai- Came in a pot filled with actual chai tea leaves and a piece of biscotti with powdered sugar. It was light and flavorful and delicious. I loved it.

Slammin spicy chicken burger- Came with the chili/chocolate powder waffle fries and dipping sauce. My husband said the burger was good and I tried his fries and loved it. It was crispy and had that touch of spicynesss.

Guilt Free Omelet- My omelet had mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, onions. It was more like a scramble but folded into an omelet shape with the cheese melted on top. I though the cheese on top and in between was too much for me, but they didn't skimp on the size and amount of veggies in the omelet.

I took my sister here for restaurant week and we had a stellar lunch. I am still reeling from what a great deal we received. For $20.11 we got a three course meal with options. We ended up getting two meals and splitting everything. The first course was a Mediterranean dip and pita. You get a choice of Babaganoush, Hummus, or Roasted Eggplant. I ordered the last of the three options and it came with eight pieces of pita and some roasted bell pepper. It was thoroughly enjoyable. My sister got the Caesar Salad and it had massive chunks of avocado in it. The dressing could have used some anchovies or more citrus, but eating the salad without any dressing was just as good.

Second course was the entree. I ordered the BBQ burger with onion rings, tomato, and lettuce. My sister got the Most Awesome Tuna Salad Sandwich (their name) and it lived up to it's name. The crumbled BBQ potato chips mixed in does give it a unique flavor and texture. Sometimes you just have to ask if they were high when they came up with this stuff. Both came with a small serving of waffle cut fries. The serving was beyond generous. 

Now for the best part of the meal. Desserts are were Max Brenner truly shine. The Banana Tempura Fondue was fried to golden perfection. It kept its texture well, but even after drowning it in caramel and milk chocolate. The Chocolate Pizza with Hazelnuts and Bananas was too much.

I ordered the veggie conscious burger and it was delicious, lots of avocado. It came with waffle fries with chili and cocoa powder on them and a side of aioli, delish. Their BLT and spicy chicken pizza is also incredible and worth trying. But back to the reason I'm giving the place 2 stars, the service. My server went way beyond trying to just be friendly and made myself, and my family, completely uncomfortable. He told us that no one likes him and even shared that the restaurant is closing soon (who tells their customers that?!). I think after awhile he realized that he was making us tense and left us alone. After our meal, we decided to check out the small chocolate shop section within the restaurant. The girl giving out free samples of chocolate was incredibly rude. SHE asked ME if I'd like a sample and as I was about to try it she yelled out to me ""You're welcome!"" Implying that I was rude for not saying thank you. It actually shocked me a bit so I apologized and said thank you. Two seconds after, she did the same thing to someone else. I quickly walked out of there without expecting to ever go back. It's upsetting when you find a restaurant where you actually enjoy the food but their service makes you hesitant to go back. Oh well, they're closing anyways.",1WgU_94dK_2xgOEYvjOMVA,0,0,2,oU6l99KaQSMGBExfjSYhUA
5412120,2010-08-13,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Went here on a whim on opening day @ the Forum Shops on 8/5 coincidentally for my husband's b-day. At first, we had plans to go elsewhere, but after tasting the samples, we gave it a go for dinner.

The restaurant itself is really cool and reminds me of Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory with brown decor everywhere, and pools of chocolate mixing in the front and a tiny shop to the side. Just so happens that Mr. Brenner was heavily influenced from watching the movie to become a chocolatier, but that's beside the point.

We were seated in front and got to watch samples be given and shot into customer's throats, literally. It was funny. They have these chocolate syringes that cost about $5 and other little goodies such as cookie shakes and those lovely pralines to die for that they sell in front to reel 'em in. It worked.

Well, as for dinner food, I ordered the Asparagus Crepe and my DH, the Sesame-crusted Salmon, my 2-yr. old got the Crunchy Mac & Cheese w/ marinara in a syringe w/ a side of cheese (?). His was fairly decent, not out of this world. Mine plain sucked. I only ate half as it was pretty tasteless and barely had any asparagus w/ mainly cheese and spinach which made it all soggy. I however, adored my child's dish (which she barely ate and instead took my waffle fries) It was one of the best Mac&Cheese dishes I've ever had in a restaurant, crunchy on top, gooey inside, and just that right amount of sharp taste i like w/ the asiago cheese. The marinara complemented the dish well. 

Now, desserts are what had me give the 4 stars, (minus the one for the meals themselves). We ordered the combo w/ the Lava Cake, Chocolate shot, and ice cream w/ a side of chocolate sauce. For his b-day, they gave this measly piece of chocolate w/ a little tealight. (I was cool w/ that considering they had just opened and were very nice to us). The cake was awesome along w/ the ice cream which helped out the heaviness of the cake. The shot was very good but for me, that chocolate sauce killed it for me. I could have drank that whole cup alone despite it being a ""sauce"". It was like a melted milk chocolate bar! I swear. 

So overall, we were pretty satisfied w/ our experience as customer service went over and beyond to treat us well being it's first day. We asked the server if Mr. Brenner was there, and as we were walking out they whispered ""He's over there in the striped shirt in the back.""  We saw the bald headed man and wished we had sat longer as he was greeting guests when we left. Hopefully they can work on the regular food, but of course the desserts will remain the star of the show. I would totally not mind if it was solely a chocolate dessert shop as I have a feeling the restaurant part may not go well. That's just a prediction since it just opened. 

Recommendations: 
-DESSERT-that's what we'll go back for to try from the multitude of selections they had. 
-The Chocolate Shop-too tiny but so cool. Pricey but worth it. TRY the Chockies and the different Pralines. Our favorite was the Pecan and Almond. The Hazelnut was so-so.

For all you Chocolholics, it will be quite an experience.",gFharXEwonMiXaMP0Uk8uw,1,1,4,IgiMcfBOkZz_e24201-LEA

I can usually guess where we're going to eat by the direction we are driving, we have several ""usual spots"" but I didn't have a clue and when he pulled into parking lot of Caesars on a Saturday night, I didn't know what to expect. 

Once inside we headed towards the Forum shops and he then told me we would be dinning at Max Brenner's. I didn't quite know who that was but there was a familiarity to the name. Once I saw the restaurant I realized it was going to be all about chocolate! 

I started the evening with an eighties milkshake, it is milk chocolate ganache, vanilla bourbon ice cream, and a crunchy chocolate shell. It was thick, cold and yummy! 

Next we had Molly's White Corn Croquettes which was only four petite croquettes made of house seasoned white corn & manchego cheese balls dusted in panko bread crumbs & lightly fried. It was a wonderful taste but just that, a tease of a taste, left me wishing for a bigger bite. 

For my main dish I enjoyed Max's Sunday Mood Pasta with fresh tomatoes, spinach, ricotta cheese, tomato-pesto. It was a little dry but overall there was good flavors found near the bottom of the bowl.. 

We couldn't leave with some wonderful treats for desert, and that we did get, a chocolate sampler which was a tray of tasty sweets. A chocolate fondue pot that they light and keep warm, there were strawberries, marshmallows and bananas to dip. Also on the tray, a banana split waffle, fluffy chocolate sponge cake, crispy chocolate egg roll, with milk and white chocolate balls. It was the best part of the evening. 

I was surprised and pleased that my husband took me to a new place that would not only allow me to enjoy one of my faves, chocolate, but would also have me thinking about the next time.....",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,5,ipqVE6mpXO93MLZ0-FMWiA
5417605,2013-11-24,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Wow the place I think I have dreamt about since watching Charlie and the chocolate factory. 

This place is not for you if you are on a diet,  if you watch your carbs or have dairy,  nut or wheat allergies.  That is because everything is either ice cream,  chocolate,  waffles, crepes and more.  

As a vegetarian is was a difficult menu for me but there new menu had a pumpkin salad which was Delish but it had paramsan cheese on it which was not stated on the menu,  the waffle it was placed on was a take or leave it kinda addition. But I would for sure order this salad with no cheese again. 

We also each had a hot chocolate which was like drinking a liquid candy bar and was heaven.  

My husband had the crape pasta with raspberry and chocolate gonash and ice cream which was a cute play on spaghetti and meat balls.  The presentation was awesome and he loved this dish.  

All in all my diet restrictions made it hard to find a healthy option but my sweet tooth made me wander.  If you are a chocolate lover this place is a must.  They even let you choose milk,  dark or white chocolate for most of the meals. 

We never had desert but the Sundaes looked epic.

5424453,2011-12-11,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"I had been wanting to try this place out for their hot chocolate and was recently able to finally give it a try.  There is a counter outside where you can order their Italian hot chocolate and some other items, or you can go inside to the bar where they have more options for you to choose from.  After getting a sample of the milk chocolate Italian hot chocolate and not being too impressed with it, we decided to go inside to get our drinks.  (FYI their Italian hot chocolate is supposed to be thick but it wasn't at all; it had the consistency of regular hot chocolate.)  We love having marshmallow in our hot chocolate so we ordered a milk chocolate hot chocolate with melting marshmallows and a white chocolate hot chocolate also with melting marshmallows.  I was pretty disappointed with the first half or so of the drink.  It was really runny and flavorless.  It wasn't until I got to the bottom that I started to enjoy my drink more.  All the marshmallows were at the bottom so it added more flavor to it.  If not I would've had to give this place a lower rating!  

I had read about the chocolate chip walnut cookie so we had to give it a try.  It's a pricey cookie (about $5) but it's huge and worth it!  It is thick and ooey and gooey and warm with delicious chocolate flavor!  We bought it at the counter and the guy working the counter and outside dining area was awesome, so helpful and friendly.  He was MIA from the counter for awhile but then again he had double duty, taking care of both the dining customers and the walk-up customers at the counter.  The bartender inside the restaurant though, not so friendly, but she was slammed with dessert drink orders.  

In all the hot chocolate ended up being okay but I have definitely had better.  For people in northern California, Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento has the best hot chocolate, full of flavor from first sip to last and marshmallow flavor from first sip to - and especially with - the last.  Monique's Chocolates in Palo Alto has the next best hot chocolate in my opinion.  Their white hot chocolate tasted like the Nestle Alpine white chocolate bar which is my favorite white chocolate.",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,0,0,3,dE94P2il92eORsm7FClxxg

I had the:

- Chocolate Chai Hot Chocolate which was perfect to the T! Light, creamy and full of so much flavor! The chai gave the hot chocolate a hint of cinnamon spice which was lovely!

-We were greeted and seated promptly-great!
-Drinks took a bit to get [smoothie and a coffee with chocolate came out fine] water took a bit longer. Straws to drink the water even longer. CHECK even took longer. At one point our waitress was out on the patio singing and dancing and we were looking for ketchup.
- Music is definitely eclectic can't say I liked it but it was interesting
- I really wanted fish tacos, but they make them with CATFISH -blah, gag, gross, no thanks [again see my seafood kick]
- We ordered 2 sandwiches to share:  the Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato and the Pulled Pork (get that one)

The BALT or whatever is called was drowning in dressing b/w the bread. It was so much so that when asked how our meal was by the manager [PS this is a rarity so I will give  1/2 a star just for that] we mentioned that the sandwich was no good. We were told someone was training in the back and maybe was over doing it. SUGGESTION-get the dressing on the side for this one or don't order it at all.

The Pulled Pork was amazing, their BBQ sauce was really really good. Both sandwiches came with 2 pickles that were rather uneventful :(

So you can see how excited I was to find that there was no need to be in nyc to try  Max Brenner! Yup, it came to VEGAS!

Unlike Serendipity3 which is located at the outside of the Caesar's towards bellagio, you can locate max brenner at the Caesar's Forum Shops. A little tip? I noticed after getting seated that 2nd floor of  max brenner is actually prettier than the 1st floor for those of you who are into ambiance. 

For the newbies like me who didn't know that they also offer food, that can be an option for hungry shoppers! As for me, after much debating, we ended up ordering one hot & one cold drinks: Italian thick hot chocolate & Pure chocolate truffle granita.

Since you have the option to choose the type of chocolates, whether it be milk, dark or white chocolate, we ordered italian thick hot chocolate with milk chocolate & pure chocolate truffle granita with dark chocolate.
A little tip (which is more of a personal preference) is that if you like sweet but not too sweet, I definitely recommend dark chocolate base because it was just more enjoyable! 

My favorite part more than the actual drinks was the presentation. 
Hot chocolate comes in their famous ""hug mug"" & their cold drinks comes in an alice cup that says ""drink me"" (isn't that so magical? i just really appreciate whimsical details like that)
I mean, even the check comes in a nice chocolate tin can! It's so cute that you almost want to pay. . . .not that you have option not to, of course;;
In fact, I love the cup so much that I ended up bringing back a pair of these hug mugs & a bag of milk hot chocolate back home ;)

I was admittedly disappointed by the decor.  They have these pipes labeled ""Chocolate"" that run through the bar and look like they are depositing chocolate from some untapped source a la Willy Wonka to their chocolate dispensers.

Trust me, all you have to do is bring her to Max Brenner. Them fly chickas love that chocolate. After that, all is forgiven. 

Personally speaking, this chocolate place does very little for me. The chocolate shakes don't taste like they have any milk in them. It's straight up mainlining chocolate into your system. 

Service here was also pretty shitty when I went. But the rest of the group was dope with it, I guess. They have chocolate covered ice cream sundaes or some shit that were off the hizzy. 

While those chocolate fiends around you go into a trance like state of euphoria, you can look around and see that they have a pipe of chocolate rolling all over the building.

5553387,2012-09-02,45,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Itching for some more Vegas sweet sins, a family friend & I ecstatically walked, shuttled, & scrambled from the Marriott to the 2nd floor of the Forum Shops.  Chances are that once in the Shops, it's 99 in 100 for Mr. Brenner to be easily found; otherwise, he'd be sort of opposite of 3-story tall H&M. Quite surprisingly, we had no wait to get seated & be treated with splendor from our inviting & ebulliently informative waiter, George.

That said, out of the dessert menu plus the savory option & wine list, we agreed to share 3 different entities: a shake, a savory (for our ""balanced"" meal :P) & of course one chewable, sweet temptation.  Like many of my foodie friends she didn't mind taking turns with, firstly, the Hazelnut Shake ($7.95).  For that price, yea that milkshake better be damn delicious, and I was more than damned with that perfectly sweet & thoroughly nutty taste, with the venti-sized consistency that was in the middle of In-N-Out thick & borderline watery.

Food sort of aside, I do want to get into nitty gritty details with service.  Not only George naturally delivered those aforementioned traits, but his warm confidence w/ our decisions brewed our trust in him.  His recommended Black Sesame [Crusted] Salmon ($18.50) was rightfully delicious with its moist cut-like-butter texture, added with generous amounts of that flask-used soy sauce & eensy weensy bit of the superbly tasty wasabi aioli that it will NOT AT ALL elicit that nasal side effect.  More impressively w/ overall service was that after George candidly asked us if our entrée should split w/ a separate plate, we didn't expect that BOTH of our 1/2 portioned, perfectly cooked 'lil salmons were already beautifully & thoughtfully presented, unlike bringing one whole entrée to cut it ourselves.  My filet was frankly diminutive, compared to the amount of veggies, but I was fine w/ it, so that we could save much more tummy room for, of course, what we came for the most.

Additionally we trusted George with his 2nd opinion of our desired chocolate treat.  Oh, emm, gee we also made the correct choice with that O.M.G. Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($9.95)--so awesomely presented in a platter that looks like graphing paper.  This saucer-sized cookie alone had the textures that I've totally dreamed of in a perfect chocolate chip cookie: crumbly & chewy on the outside, moist & absolutely chocolaty on the in, WITHOUT going insanely absurd with sugar, and with effortless hints of walnut chunks & noticeable brown sugar flavor.  THEN the O factor came through when I added that luscious & choco-gasmic sauce in a flask; the M was for encompassing the ripened berries (including my favorite, Yelp buds ;D); and when I dashed that assumingly house-made whipped cream, the G factor strongly excelled & stimulated my choco-chip cookie crave.

Understandably the money marks might be quite high for such foods, but Max Brenner deserved a 4-star savory WITH the aioli, 4-star shake, & an absolute 5 for service & for that dream-come-true heavenly--or should I say hellish--Cookie that frugal me retorted to my friend, ""Uhh eff it, I worked this much to [use check card instead of credit card] for this dinner.""

I'm pretty sure everyone has an occasional sugar craving once in a while.  I get so frustrated when I'm all out of my white chocolate macadamia nut or hot fudge energy bar in the morning.  If I get my sugar rush innocently, I always think about Max Brenner's icy cold chocolate milk shake, yum!!  Once I read an article that a recent research suggests people in general who prefer sweets are more likely to be compassionate, nice & friendly, and yes.., SWEETER :P

One night, I went there for the HH.  I sit at the bar and ordered a martini called, 'Intoxi-Cake'  Basically, the main ingredients are the cake flavored vodka, frangelico, and your choice of chocolate.  I had mine with a white chocolate and it was amazing!
If you have a sweet tooth, you will enjoy this cocktail.  Otherwise, some people might not liking it too much for their taste.
All cocktails listed are $6 including a Mojito, Margarita, and Wine.  The Beers are $4( these drinks price are only during Happy Hours)
I also ordered a 'Banana Tempura Fondue $6' as a small appetizer.  It came with a couple of slice of fresh strawberries, milk chocolate dip, and toffee sauce.  I ended up bringing it home because the portion was more than enough to share for two.  But, I had to get one more of 'Intoxi-Cake' for the night :)  
If you love Lindt's white chocolate bar and a cocktail with a taste of dessert, you should definitely go for Happy Hour & enjoy all sorts of chocolate cocktails.  Oh, and I was very pleased with the service at the bar.  All I can say is that this place is a heaven for chocolate lovers, mmmmm.",h0wxG2EiDLhgKjIzI8j2Mg,3,4,4,tzIe5fOJK38n-xcMSfx-Ow

After seeing Elton John's inaugural show for the new Million Dollar Piano show, my girlfriend and I wandered through the Forum Shoppes for some tasty food and drinks. We ended up here for a few reasons, the primary two being (a) I have a thing for bald men, and (2) chocolate is never a bad thing... What better way to indulge in both after a diva-liscious evening than kill two birds with one stone over at Max Brenner?

Wait, there's a 9pm and later happy hour?

*swoon*

Bald men, chocolate, happy hour... TRIFECTA!

Sit at the bar and you have a full menu of drinks, tapas/appetizers and desserts that are only $5.00 each from 9pm to close.

Drinks:

* Satisfaction Guaranteed - The name is no lie. Chocolate milk with peanut and caramel liquers... #drinkgasm in a stemless martini glass, served with a side of candied peanuts. It was almost a forget-the-food moment when we tucked into this one. This could easily be dinner and dessert rolled into one. Sweet but not cloying, rich with the milk and liquers, and a layered taste sensation for the picky palette. Beautifully done. We ordered 2.

* Berry Nutty Professor - Generally good, but not our favorite. In fact, I have to admit, there was a slightly Pepto feel to it, a chalkiness in the back of the throat. The berry flavor was bright and good, but something about the combination didn't sit right.

* Max's White Russian - Strong, amazing, and perfectly executed. The white chocolate (the white part of this Russian) was delivered in a little glass sipper/pitcher of sorts and you mixed it in yourself. Tasty, unique in taste, texture, and presentation; easily the best White Russian either of us ever had. Ura!

Food:

* Chicken Cobb Sliders - A slightly spicy, lightly breaded chicken filet on a beautiful bun (that I was told was tasty), seved with a tasty, tangy, crispy Cobb salad topping including bacon and really fresh greens. Definitely a new favorite!

* Bacon, Cheese, Chicken Bites - Chicken and cheese wrapped in bacon and served at the end of toothpicks. Perfect, tender, flavorful, creamy, bites of wonderful... on a stick.

* Philly Cheesesteak Sliders - Two words: Cheeze Whiz. In down-home-Philly-phashion, the meat was tender, the flavors were spot on, the creaminess reminded me of being in Philly, and the bread (I don't eat it) looked amazing (were those real Amoroso rolls?!).

* Hummus w/ cocoa dusted pita chips - Fantastic texture, but the flavors were just OK. An enjoyable snack, for sure, but not something I would come here to order. Good, tasty, but not standout.

All of this for $40. Large portions, too (3 each of the cheesesteaks, 2 of the sliders, 4 chicken/bacon bites, etc.)! 

Yeah, that. We even skipped dessert - at the chocolate place! Oh darn, a reason to return?! (As if we needed any more?) I can't wait!",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,10,5,5,3e-7CcdzU8ElFhJ-S-6dIQ

Seated right at opening! Yeah! 
Service was good, we ordered the granola fruit bowl - yummy bananas/strawberry/blueberries/blackberries/granola/yogurt/ and chocolate bits to top with warm honey on the side and a powdered biscotti on the other side of my big bowl.

So let's get down to the food:

White Hot Chocolate- My favorite drink! I got this in NYC as well.  I added an amaretto shot just because it's Vegas and it was delish. 

Mexican Hot Chocolate- Also a great choice--creamy hot chocolate with a bit of a spicy kick to it.

Chai Tea- Came in a self-press kettle for extra freshness. Was amazing as well, but I would personally go for a chocolate drink

Chocolate Pizza- I know this is what they're known for, but I definitely DID NOT like it :(...  It was waaay too rich and tasted like I was eating 3 bars of melted chocolate at once.  Definitely a must for the experience, but never again.

Sugar Banana Waffle- This is the second waffle I've tried here and I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their waffles. My favorite part is the small Erlenmeyer-like flask of chocolate that comes with it.

Brenner Burger- Your typically restaurant burger.  Good for a burger, but not anything too special.  The waffle fries dusted in cocoa powder and the sauce it came with were my favorite parts.

Things I love about Max Brenner other than the food: the service, the hug mugs, the alice cup, the restaurant's design (100% pure chocolate pipes everywhere, the ""you look good today"" mirror in the bathroom, the menu, etc)",tnxnWK1wlxGwDLSWwJZhqg,0,0,4,O7okdsnzsewh32vNqqq16w

Eating and visiting here is a treat. The ambiance is fun and the food (sweet and savory) are both delicious.  For our meal, I was able to try the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet which is filling and comes with a delicious dusted sugar buttermilk biscuit to dip in chocolate sauce. For breakfast, this is a nice combo for me as I always enjoy having my eggs and sweets in the morning! I was also able to eat the Brenner Burger which is a good burger too. 

If you're here, make sure to order a drink with your meal! This is the whole experience and is the most fun.  I ordered the Mocha (cappuccino with hot chocolate) which came in their cute ""Hug Mug.""

We were seated by our hostess, and my friend ordered poached eggs.  He wanted the yolks soft, and tried to make clear what he wanted, but the waitress couldn't quite understand what he meant.  It was as if she was unfamiliar with poached eggs.

To ensure that he received soft yolks, he changed his egg order to ""over easy.""  She tried to confirm his order by asking if he wanted them ""over medium.""  My biggest complaint was that the waitress was unable to grasp a simple egg order.  I guess I expect more when paying $15 for a routine egg breakfast.

This was definitely a Willy Wonka experience for adults...though, with less of the fat German kid drinking from the fake brown water river that was supposed to be chocolate and more of a dessert wonderland feeling.

It was sort of dead which I guess always puts a damper on the whole experience but things did pick up.  Inexplicably, they offered us a table behind the exterior menu board so we ate constantly with a shadow over us.  And I'm pretty sure we photobombed a bunch of people taking their pics with the menu board.

It took a while to decide but I ordered a dark hot chocolate in their adorable hug mug and their scramble (one of the few savory breakfast items they have on their menu) while hubby went with their Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes.

Our food was pretty darn awesome.  My scramble came with a large piece of baguette and along side it, a little crock each of butter and chocolate.  FOR MY PIECE OF BAGUETTE.  How sinful is that??  I'm not going to lie - butter and choco sauce on bread is to die for.  Wow.  

Hubby's pancakes were also probably (we both agreed but he said it first because he took the first few bites) the best pancakes we'd ever had.  It was topped with fried bananas and served with a white chocolate and milk chocolate sauce.  The pancakes didn't appear chocolately but they were still delicious.

Kind of like my Las Vegas Serendipity experience, I couldn't help but think that both my experiences were better in New York.

The store inside Caesar's Palace is a smaller low-key store. My friends and I stopped in for some lunch and once again taste that amazing hot chocolate. I ordered the Chubby Smoked Turkey Club that came with waffle fries that were dusted with chili and cocoa powder, my boyfriend ordered the Buffalo Chicken Slider appetizer and Oven Roasted Tomato Pizza, and his friend ordered the Max's Sunday Mood Pasta.

It might have been that we were starving, but the service seemed to be seriously lagging and there weren't even a lot of people in the restaurant. The food did taste great however, and we ended up getting the hot dark chocolate with marshmallows to go because we were in a hurry to get back to our hotel. But I definitely recommend sitting down and enjoying it from a hug mug.

I also thought Max Brenner's restaurants to be more of a chocolate experience, and I had never had a meal from Max Brenner and have always gone for chocolate and other desserts. Maybe if we had come just to buy a box of truffles and drink hot chocolate and order a fondue it would have been a lot more enjoying instead of coming in for a quick lunch and taken a hot chocolate to go.

5650992,2010-08-11,1,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"Make no mistake, Max Brenner serves food, but it is only so you won't feel guilty about eating their chocolate desserts.  Hence they have a reminder on their menu - Food first then dessert.  Any place that gives you syringes filled with warm chocolate ganache to squirt in your mouth is a place worth visiting.  

The regular food menu did not have anything that really enticed my tastebuds - sandwiches, burgers, etc.  So we ordered some appetizers that sounded good.  Mac n cheese with marinara on the side - don't ask, that is a new one for me.  It was very cheesy, a bit salty, some bacon added, but nothing that great.  The waffle fries which are supposedly dusted with chili cocoa powder were run-of-the-mill.  I could not taste the difference with regular waffle fries and the dipping sauce they came with overwhelmed the dish with saltiness.  The hummus sampler was ok, a bit too bland, but the pita chips had a great crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

The black and tan beer battered onion rings are worth a special mention.  Most beer battered onion rings I have had at other places are overfried and bland.  When you take a bit into these, you get a wonderful hoppy, malty flavor and aroma from the beer.  A bit of a surprise if you are not expecting it, but a depth of dimension you cannot find elsewhere.

Now getting to the desserts.  The sharing tasting menu is a good starting point for those who can't decide.  It states on the menu that it is good for two but you can actually have 4 people share.  There is just wayyy too much chocolatey goodness for just 2 people.  It is comprised of :
chocolate banana waffles
chocolate crispy eggroll
milk and white chocolate bar
chocolate sponge cake
crunchy little chocolate pearls
chocolate fondue with grill and fruits and marshmallows
and chocolate ganache to drizzle over everything.

The chocolate fondue is very fun as you can toast your marshmallows then dip into the melted chocolate.  After sharing this plate, I got a shock of chocolate euphoria which resulted from the the endorphin rush.

An absolute must have is the suckao.  Although the name makes it sound like a porno term, it is a combination of suck and cacao.  It is like the hot chocolate drinks that you can find in Europe.  You basically get a little container of milk (I recommend whole) which is kept heated over a little tea candle.  Then you also have a choice of what chocolate you want - dark, milk, or white (dark recommended).  From here you add the chocolate to the milk to your liking stirring with a spoon that doubles as a straw.  As the chocolate melts and combines with the milk, you get a rich chocolate beverage, essentially chocolate ecstasy.  You are technically making your own miniature ganache and drinking it.  Few things in life can produce such joy.  If you are not use to such huge amounts of chocolate, take caution as it will literally give you a high.

We started with a dark chocolate drink served in the HugMug.  It was very good without being overly sweet.  For dinner he ordered the Brenner burger, and I had the vegetarian burger.  That was, without a doubt, the best veggie burger I've ever had.  He really liked his as well. The service was nice and efficient.

For desert we ordered the waffles, chocolate, and banana dish.  Absolutely worth getting.  We almost had to lick the plate clean it was so tasty.  I highly recommend this restaurant for outstanding food and a fabulous experience with chocolate.",AplFnbf2JKVr1bLWE0YA9g,2,0,4,AM4dkCNksSuawa_pCtfD5Q

I also ordered the dark chocolate hot chocolate in a ""hug mug."" I'm really not into the ""it will warm your heart"" presentation pieces.

Chocolate is my weakness. I give it up every year for Lent & every year I fail. This year will be no exception.

Enter Max Brenner. The chocolate possibilities are only limited to your imagination in this modern day version of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Since we already had dinner, dessert was in order. What we had:

Eighties Milkshake: milk chocolate ganache, vanilla ice cream and crunchy chocolate shell. Delicious!

Italian Hot Chocolate: thick hot chocolate with vanilla cream. Best hot chocolate I've had hands down.
https://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/ZpDYtsaXYrLg3xE1slVigQ/l.jpg

Both were divine. The Italian hot chocolate is served in a ""hug mug"" and the milkshake in an ""Alice"". Loved the aesthetics of these mugs and ended up buying an Alice to take home with me. Service was gracious even though we came in an hour before closing time after our drive in from San Diego. I absolutely love the decor and the staircase that looked like it could've been carved out of a block of chocolate.

I'll definitely return for my chocolate fix the next time I'm in Vegas!",DfOj2Jf4MlTQiF5TMHCm2g,8,8,4,PLHIVum-ga7BfH2NDrNAkw
5677983,2012-05-31,0,w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg,"My husband and I actually made a reservation for lunch here since every restaurant we seemed to walk in to for lunch or dinner had an hour and a half wait. We went on a Wednesday at 1 pm and there was hardly anyone in there. I love chocolate so I couldn't wait to try this place. I will say up front that I did not end up getting dessert because of what I ordered to eat and because of the service so I wanted to get out of there.

First off, the service was super slow and since there were hardly any other people there, it was surprising. Also, the hostess sat us at the closest table to the entrance which I thought was not cool since we went out of our way to make reservation. After we placed our drink our orders (iced tea and a beer - not a frou frou mixed drink) I asked where the restroom was. Some waitress said theirs was broken so I had to go use one out in the mall. No problem, but later I overheard a woman ask another person where the restroom was and she told her it was upstairs. So, were the toilets not broken or did you just happen to fix them in the next 20 minutes?

So back to the awesome table we were placed at. After we had our drinks, a group of people came a plopped down right next us and sat there and talked about how hungover they were and how tired they were with no intention of ordering anything. This girl literally sat on top of me while I was looking at the menu. The hostess even came over and asked if they were going to order anything or if they were ""hanging out"". They replied they were just hanging out and had no intention of ordering food or drinks and the hostess decided that was perfectly fine. The group of people decided to move on eventually but that's when I asked to move to a table away from the entrance and not in the ""I'm not a paying customer, I'm just gonna hang out"" zone. Our waitress was really nice and accommodating and moved us to a table slightly further away near the bar.

Like I said, I did not get dessert but I did order the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes. I figured a meal and dessert in one and that's exactly what I got so there was no need to order more dessert. My husband ordered the Lazy Breakfast where you get 2 eggs and 2 ""add-ins"" and a biscuit dusted with sugar and chocolate dipping sauce. The add-ins he requested were tomatoes and bacon. Apparently that meant loads of cheese as well. My husband can't eat cheese so he had to send it back. Once again, the waitress was super nice and apologetic and I think she threw in some chorizo as a bonus when they redid his food. The other redeeming quality of this experience was that the waitress comped his meal for getting it wrong.

If we went back, I would just go for dessert and skip the food. Ask to sit at the bar or away from the entrance because at the end of the day, this place is in a mall and people are going to treat it like they are stopping at the food court and apparently, there is no problem with that. Paying customers are not treated any better than people who want to take a load off inside the restaurant and text their friends. I expected more from the reviews that I read previously but I was pleased that at least the waitress had the thought to comp my husband's meal when she didn't have to do that.",xDougrTAnE8bWDkeiAy7Tw,0,0,2,s0WN3BKX9rsz6RXaTlGnRA

What was I thinking? This was on my To Do List before arrival and I almost deprived myself of chocolate heaven! So, I went and ordered myself a slice of chocolate pizza and I was not disappointed one bit. The chocolate was just the perfect balance of sweetness vs bitterness. The crust was just thin enough, yet still chewy enough as well. 
The slice could maybe have been a bit bigger. But for $7 and an energy boost which I needed to keep me awake for my 11:30pm flight I won't be greedy. I know I won't wait until my last day in Vegas to eat there next time in their sit-down restaurant to try something from their menu and save room for more Chocolate Pizza for dessert. 
I would have given it 5 stars but there was no one at the take-out counter to take my order and a small crowd grew before someone finally showed up to serve us.",tKCVcw59eH1-JtJNiK7LhQ,1,1,4,C7MJtou1SVBHtB4lNHUPwA

We eventually decided to share the ""melting chocolate truffle heart cake and shake"" which is basically a tiny lava cake.  Even though it's small it is very rich and filling.   My sister and I could not finish it because we were just too full.  But oh was it the most amazing chocolate piece of heaven!

They were listed as part of the Small Business Saturday promotion -- where you get a $25 credit if you use an AMEX card at a participating small business. So of course we had to take advantage and get breakfast before heading back home.

My wife ordered a standard 2 egg breakfast and while it was good, it paled in comparison to my french toast. Of course, it wasn't any old french toast. It was apple cinnamon, white chocolate truffle french toast covered with toasted pecans. What?! 

It just sounds really sweet just saying that and your teeth might start to ache. But it wasn't too sweet at all. All the flavors just balanced each other out.

If you come here and are somewhat interested in the fondue, get the sharing fondue because that option comes with the little flame to make your smores and you get all the same elements (chocolate, marshmallows, banana, etc) plus a bunch more desserts to sample and dip into their chocolate! 

Ugh, don't you guys hate when you don't order correctly at a restaurant?! When in doubt, always yelp. ALWAYS. But there was no service (freaking Sprint) so I was outta luck.

Not that the smores weren't good, but they weren't spectacular. So run of the mill I don't even know why it's on the menu. This is a restaurant with a mission statement dedicated to chocolate, a key player in the dessert world, so I expect every dessert to be superb. 

Anyway, their shakes are super decadent and tasty but also really heavy. I didn't want to move after a couple sips of my friend's hazelnut shake. Definitely a place to share dessert or you'll be slipping into a chocolate daze for days :D (no pun intended)

We did appetizers.. and all had bacon in them. Bacon is not my fave, but I was just going along with it. We had the ""best macaroni and cheese,"" chicken skewers, and another got a BLAT: bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato. 

I don't think this was the best macaroni and cheese, or whichever that was called. Yes, it was good, yes it was cheesy, gooey, creamy... but maybe I am biased because of the bacon that was spread throughout. 

Chicken skewers were tasty. Placed on toothpicks and wrapped in bacon, with a dipping sauce that I didn't focus on enough to distinguish. 

As for the dessert, which i will be back for next time... Screw the food!! 
I think the milkshakes are incredible and have a little Alice in Wonderland story to go along with them.. I have never had a milk shake like that before, this is a must get! 

We also shared a fondue with dark chocolate, caramel, and milk chocolate. The fondues came with brownies, choc chip cookies, marshmallows, strawberries, and bananas. Also, a little grill for roastin and toastin!

Let's start with the shake.  My son ordered the salted caramel shake & it was the most runny, thin shake I've ever tasted.  Also way too salty.  Portion was very small.  For $9 you should get a nice sized shake with the tin can.  On to my banana split waffle.  Let's start w/the positives - the chocolate & caramel was outstanding.  The problem the chocolate comes in a container that probably holds 1/2 an ounce if your lucky.  This is stingier than your boss giving you praise for a job well done.  Then they put a 1 1/2 inch baby scoop of ice cream that is smaller than a child's cone at baskin robbins.  To make matters worse the waffle is so stale it tastes like it was made in the dark ages.

Based on the Yelp reviews,on my first visit, I ordered the B.A.L.T. sandwich and an Apple Pie Cinnamon Waffles (white chocolate cream, vanilla crepe flake ice cream, candied pecans) for dessert.  On my second visit, I sat at the bar and ordered the Brenner Burger and upgraded it to Pure AmericanKobe Beef, a Hot Dark Chocolate drink, and ended my lunch with a Butterscrotch Chocolate Cream Milkshake (dulce de leche ice cream, toffee sauce, pure milk chocolate).

The B.A.L.T. sandwich was good, but I thought there would be more avocado.  Otherwise, it was tasty and pretty easy to make at home if you are so inclined. The best part is the waffle fries.

Apple Pie Cinnamon Waffles - one of their composed desserts.  I have a sweet tooth, but even this was a little too much sugar for me.  The waffles was okay, and for me the best part of this dessert was the 2 oz scoop of vanilla ice cream and the warmed and dilluted condense milk that you can pour over the everything.

The Brenner Kobe Burger was very good.  And was also served with those waffle fries.  It was juicy, has a good flavor, and I totally recommends this.  Can get a little messy eating this, but nothing a good wipe on the napkins or a little soap and water will not fix up.

The Hot Chocolate (Dark Chocolate) was served in the ""hug me"" mug, which I thought would be bigger, but the hot chocolate was served in a cup sized ""mug"" but has rich chocolate flavor.  Worth a try, if you love chocolate.

Butterscrotch Chocolate Cream Milkshake - a sweet milkshake perfect for the sweet tooth.  But it is not a unique dessert concept that you can't find anywhere else.  But it hit the spot for me and was a yummy conclusion to a good lunch.

The waitstaff were all very friendly and attentive. 4/5

After taking a closer look at their menu displayed in the front, we discovered they serve food too! Finally ate here a few days ago....

I loved the layout of this restaurant, it really felt like sitting in a chocolate factory! There were big jars on the walls filled with pieces of chocolate, crates on the floor filled with cocoa beans, pipes on the ceiling with flowing chocolate, etc. 

My husband and I came in for a light lunch. We ordered:

Max's Pizza - Meaty, Crispy, Cheesy & More: not really a fan of thin pizzas, but this was great! Very tasty, can't go wrong with pepperoni and bacon, which are my two favorite pizza toppings! I also liked how they cut it into bite sized pieces.

Southwestern Caesar Salad with Chicken (individual size): I know this sounds boring, but this was THE BEST Caesar Salad I have ever eaten! Good quality lettuce, good grilled chicken, all the ingredients were cut small so it was easy to eat. Very tasty and loved the creamy Mexican Caesar dressing too!

Pure Chocolate Truffle Granita: they were giving out samples of this in the mall, we both liked it. It was thick, not overly sweet and came in a neat ""Alice Cup"" with a metal straw.

Service was okay. We didn't wait too long for our food. The waitress didn't seem too excited about her job though, maybe she was having a bad day? But she did take time to explain things on the menu and checked up on us a few times.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  It was just that good.  Seriously, my experience here blew my mind.

Made a reservation via Open Table after leaving a filling but highly unsatisfying dinner.  The mood was chocolate and lots of it.  We were seated quickly at an isolated table near the back (and near the servers computer station).  We could easily see the pipes of chocolate that his restaurant in NYC is known for, and our table was large enough to accommodate the extra person who unsurprisingly arrived a bit later.

Since we came just for dessert, I'll comment only on that.  The menu is fairly large, there's plenty to pick from and everyone had a hard time deciding; but all were able to pick something that met their tastes.  I had the deep fudge chocolate cake and shake dish - in addition to being highly adorable when it arrived: the shake was in a shot glass, the cake was warm, ice cream was in a separate dish, and the fudge came in a container of its own; it was delicious to boot.  I was unable to finish the whole thing, but we could attribute that to my eating off the plates of others and the large dinner beforehand.  I wanted to take it home, but as I was traveling, it wasn't an option.  Let me go back to the ice cream.  This ice cream was maybe the best vanilla based ice cream

The Maxwich was awesome.  After ordering (two of them were ordered at the table), the chef that night came over to our table to apologize and ask if she could substitute other cookies in - the answer was an easy yes, but then she returned a few minutes later with cookies in hand.  She'd taken them out of a different case where they were being sold just for the making of the Maxwich.  Phew.  The dessert came as intended and was an ice cream cookie sandwich of oooh-y (and aaaaaah-y)goodness. 

Tasted a crepe (also good, but bananas aren't my thing, so I had a small bite) and had a sip of a hazelnut drink which was in their own Alice and Wonderland inspired cup.

Waitress was friendly, and fast with waters, the food and the bill!
Prices a bit high, but DEFINITELY worth it.
A bit inwards once you're in the Caesars shopping area; so give yourself enough time to get there if your reservation time is important.

They've since changed the menu a couple of times and added a neat little daily happy hour at the bar. Oh and the Hostess was very nice and was actually smiling! On to a great start here!

Nikko and kay-? They were both awesome. The drinks were delicious. The chocolate martini (made with real chocolate), max's White Russian, and the cake drink are dangerous! Best chocolate martini I have ever had. Did I mention Nikko makes killer drinks?

I go here for desserts primarily, so I'm not one to say anything about their normal fare, but the little snacks I've had were good.

Now on to the desserts. I've had the shakes, fondue, pizza, and finally decided to try the banana split waffle. Best decision ever!

Molly's White Corn Croquettes 
house seasoned white corn & manchego cheese balls 
dusted in panko bread crumbs & lightly fried

We LOVED these...delicious!  Perfectly fried...an excellent combination of sweet from the corn and slightly spicy.  Fortunately our shared sandwich arrived to keep us from fighting over these.

Sliced & Diced Steak ""Pillow"" Panini 
 certified angus beef ®
char gilled & thin sliced skirt steak tossed with 
diced caramelized onions on a bed of asiago cheese crisps. 
baby spinach, roasted tomatoes, red pepper aioli

I came here with my coworker and fellow Yelper Stacy A. We made reservations just in case and although it wasn't busy when we arrived it was packed soon after. 

I had the Chicken, Bacon and Cheddar Rolls, the Spicy Tuna Sandwich and the Chocolate Pizza with toffee, banana and chocolate to end.

Not surprising for a place that specializes in chocolate, the desserts were amazing and I look forward to coming back to try more of them soon! I only wish the crush of the pizza was a little more cooked. It was a little on the doughy side, which I'm not partial to. The appetizers were delicious. The Mediterranean dish was probably my favorite. It was a pretty good size and the flavors were great. My appetizer was delicious as well. Not really what I was expecting, but I guess I don't really know what I was expecting. Crazy good though, despite it's tiny portion. My sandwich was very basic. Again, not exactly what I was expecting but still tasty. I wish I had ordered the burger instead as that looked very appetizing. It was a huge tower of a burger with onion rings and their special BBQ on top. Both our meals came with their special crisscut fries which were spicy and delicious!!!

Overall, great experience and I'm glad I finally got to check it out for a meal instead of just an event.

I ordered the tasting for two despite I was only one person. How else was I to sample a little bit of everything? I really had no shame. Included in what looked like the last meal of my life was fluffy chocolate sponge cake, which looked like a brownie but lived up to its name perfectly. I had the one crispy chocolate egg roll with spicy peanuts inside. It may sound unusual but it was very, very tasty, with a little kick. It also came with a whole fondue setup where I picked dark chocolate to dip my roasted marshmallows and strawberries. There were also some white and milk chocolate barks which I took to go(a strategic move on my part). But the most unique thing in the tasting was the Banana split waffle. It was this tower of waffle and caramelized bananas with toasted rice crispy chunks and bourbon ice cream. It comes with a itty bitty glass jar of warm chocolate to drip over it and tiny chocolate crunch balls. I mean, seriously delicious. My mouth is watering again. This place is a must for me.

Food:
1) Huevos Rancheros Sunrise Breakfast burrito was soo good! Eggs, spicy chorizo sausages, tomatoes, pepper jack cheese served with home fries. This was one of the better spicy chorizo sausages that I've tried. The home fries were uh-mazing! I only wish the portions were larger for the price we were paying.

It didn't taste any different from the scrambles I've tried elsewhere. The only thing that really stood out from other establishment was the home fries, which I mentioned above. I'll probably try something or the burrito the next time I come for breakfast.

It was decadent and it simply just blew my mind. Considering the ingredients, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, which is quite an accomplishment.

The steak panini wasn't as good as we had expected it to be according to the other reviews.., it deserves three stars out of five. 

The elevator smells ridiculously funky... Do not use it to get to the upstairs bathroom. The bathrooms were so gross.... There was only toilet paper in one of the stalls and that stall had various toilet papers and other paper trashes strewn on the floor.. The towel dispenser was broken as well so I had to air dry. 

I got the omg cookie for dessert, the cookie was a brittle/ crunchy cookie, instead of the soft cookie I had expected, but it softened up after I drizzled the chocolate sauce on the cookie. Overall, it deserves something like a three stars. 

My bf got the s'mores concoction on the sweet icons page of the dessert menu and   Seemed to really like his dessert. 

Both were really sweet though. 

Three stars because it was only the Mac and cheese that impressed us that night, and because we were seated in an obscure corner of the restaurant even though there were plenty of better tables free as well. 

I liked the new York max brenner restaurant I had visited much much more than this one and will go there instead of here if I ever feel the urge to forge on chocolate again!!",n-XBn3KPRJ9uqIeVivP01Q,1,1,3,5W65WkZuPbzaVTeyImk-hQ

Max Brenner....yes please!  You know a cookie is Out-Of-This-World-Incredible when you are still talking about it 24 hours later.  This little chocolate stop in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace caught me by surprise.  Chocolate Syringes, Chocolate Pizza, the best/richest Hot Chocolate ever made, and the BEST COOKIE I have ever had are just a few of the things this place had to offer. 

By the time a person is 28, they have had a lot of cookies.  I have had hundreds of store bought ones, ones made from friends and family, ones I have attempted, and lots from different restaurants and shops.  Now for me to say that this is the BEST COOKIE I have ever had....that is a huge deal!  

A $5 cookie just sounds ridiculous but that place is going to see many bills coming out on my wallet for years to come.  Max Brenner is a must-visit place for me forever.   That heavy, warm, gooey cookie stole my heart and I want more!  I could go on forever about it but you just need to get there a.s.a.p. and find out for yourself.  Happy Eating!",PjoSwmHj3QL5U5lDtjM3KA,2,0,5,fcw3ff6qQqiCD7f4G53amw
