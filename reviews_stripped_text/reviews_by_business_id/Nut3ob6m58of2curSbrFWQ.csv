99963,2015-09-28,0,Nut3ob6m58of2curSbrFWQ,"Tired of the breakfast sandwich routine, I stopped at this Don Tortaco location on Saturday morning to get a breakfast burrito. It was very filling and exactly what I expected. It was massive and filled with eggs, cheese, sausage and potatoes. Piping hot and very satisfying. 

The menu isn't as extensive as other similar places but they have the typical taco shop goodies. The place is very clean and the salsa bar is well stocked. I love that they have an agua fresca fountain which has HORCHATA. Mexican food + horchata is the way to go. I don't like having to go up to the counter to ask for a refill so this is definitely a plus. They get an extra star for that. Check out their specials board for some great deals.",GLp5vueztLtd8HtcvqvhBw,1,0,4,CWJ3DVPP08wQ_Q35A13wiw

I also tried their beef nachos; the beef they used on it was tender and flavorful, and they used real cheese instead of nacho cheese which made it good. But the guacamole was average and not that seasoned and their was an over abundance of beans on it.

We ordered our food and afterwards we watched the same lady put trash bags on the existing trashcans in the kitchen.  I expected her to wash her hands but instead she put gloves on and started cooking the food.  We left in amazement because the lady taking our order had a tag on that displayed the Clark County Health District.  I thought wow now I can't eat that.  Fail for Don Tortaco and The Clark County Health District.  Obviously these employees didn't learn a thing.,Ix4omDKVL73yL14QhIeieQ,2,1,1,TLF03oFSUAtgYVUo5Vx1Ng
2911431,2014-03-03,2,Nut3ob6m58of2curSbrFWQ,"Yay! I am definitely a fan!

After waking up craving a breakfast burrito, and coming across a long ass line at Lauritas, we decided to finally check this place out. 

I opted for that breakfast burrito w/chicken(egg, potatoe, cheese, and chicken), while my friend opted for nachos with carne asada. We both were impressed with how tasty all that food was....and there was plenty! I love how they aren't cheap with the meat here....HUGE portions!

The service was friendly and the place was really clean. I don't think a long winded review is really necessary. It's a taco shop, but a really good one! I can't wait to try more items on the menu here! Being less than 5 minutes from where I live, I will be back often!

Seriously, the steak, man.... ooo, it's so good! 
AND 24 hours! It's the perfect night good! 
Pricing is totally worth it for the HUGE portions and freshly cooked meat! I always have left overs for the next day.

Erika took my order today but was not making the food, but her personality and friendliness was amazing.  

She loves her job and the customers and makes you feel welcome when you walk through the door.

Because of Erika, I would go back to this location plus the fact they have specials every day and if you go to their site through Yelp, there are specials and discounts which is another plus for this place.

If you have not been to one of these locations find one a go.  Most are open 24/7, this location closes at midnight.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,5,4,4,RHyLXDQDRKPpINkpEtwaRA
4654338,2018-02-13,0,Nut3ob6m58of2curSbrFWQ,"Came in here the other day since I'm in search of my NEW favorite Mexican to go joint since my old one now sucks and this place isn't my new favorite or even close to it BUT it's honestly not horrible either. 

The customer service sucks when you walk in their door, No smile or what can I get for you, Just  kinda a blank stare and off ya go with your food. No thank you and come again, But they do have a tip jar!!  Ha ha. I guess that these guys haven't figured out yet that you need to have decent customer service skills for people to want to give you FREE money for nothing....  whatever. Anyway. 

The carne asada on a scale from 1-10 is about a 5 or 6 as there is no flavor. They don't marinate their meat overnight properly like some other places do and let the beef absorb flavor from the seasonings to taste like something other than a chopped up leather belt!!  

I'm from so. Cal and almost all the Mexican taco shops know you have to marinate to get flavor. I'm wondering if these guys even know that you have to remove the seasoning from the bottle and add it to the meat to get the beef to taste like something? I'm thinking maybe they think that since they bought the seasoning and as long as its in the same vicinity as the food that it'll MAGICALLY season itself!?  Ha ha 

The salsa bar IS good though. Lots of jalape√±os and carrots and onions and it has good flavor. 

The red and green salsa has good flavor and you can tell it's NOT canned. 

The tacos are mediocre at best. Their just flavorless beef with guacamole (watered down guacamole) and pick de gallo. As long as you cover it in lime juice, salsa and salt than it's good but nothing close to south of the border and these guys English isn't so great so you'd think they could make better tacos but they don't so whatever. 

The breakfast burritos are ok and fairly priced. 

The taquitos are pretty much just rolled up corn tortillas with VERY little meat. 

If you're craving Mexican and you're nearby than try it for yourself. The restaurant is clean. The prices are ok. But don't make a special trip from the other side of town or you'll be disappointed. 

Still in search of that GREAT Mexican to go joint but still haven't found it but I will!!

Also there hard taco shells are BEYONG hard and almost shatter your teeth and are like tearing a piece of leather to break a piece off because I think
The shells are fried dats in advance",-6hzTZbyE_vAnlLe4lEkpA,1,0,1,0MxxlUTrzMI0e1vcXlwJYw

4767507,2017-08-28,0,Nut3ob6m58of2curSbrFWQ,"Let me start off by saying that the food is good. I've had the carne asada burrito, the carne asada fries, tacos al pastor, and a torts al pastor and they were all pretty decent. The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because I feel that there is room for improvement. Especially with their tortas. I've had tortas at other places and they usually come with some beans, sour cream, and a little bit of guacamole. The tortas at Don Tortaco come only with meat which makes them seem a bit plain, and not to mention,  hard to eat. When you're trying to eat it, the meat falls out because their's nothing in it to hold everything together. My suggestion to the cooks is that they add at least some beans and sour cream to help keep the meat in place. Until they improve the way they make their tortas, I will not be ordering it again. Besides that, I think that the meat tastes good and the service is also pretty good. I will continue to go, but no more tortas for me. I think I'll stick to their tacos.",YkJVjGJ-Eq7AN4ruJTXdKw,0,0,3,SJpjqgR4owTf-laZfbSiyg

The place was dead and was being manned by only 1 person.  No worries though, the server/cook/cashier was quick and banged out our chimichanga in no time at all.

Chimichanga was cooked nicely and the outer layer was a nice balance of being very crispy but not oily.  Topped in guacamole and cheese, the chimichanga really hit the spot.  Additionally, the rice that was served on the rice was prolly one of the best rices I've had a Mexican joint.  Super impressed for a quick meal.

5 stars for the horchata on tap tho.  Neverending horchata???  Come on, this kid will come back simply to exploit the wonder-machine spitting out the cinnamon-milky goodness.",_b9CQb4fPUo0sM0tdmhq5A,0,0,4,ZD8dXSeYc2dz0Wcgtu3tcQ
