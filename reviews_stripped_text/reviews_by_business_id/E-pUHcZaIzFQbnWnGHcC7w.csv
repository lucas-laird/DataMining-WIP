The manager first said she would fix the order by having me pay the difference for the wrong items. So don't put the receipt in the bag and/or review the order.

I had to wait for the someone to even acknowledge me standing and pushing the button I found it odd that I would have to pay more for cold food.  I suggested to the manager she take back the wrong items and give me the items I ordered. She agreed to  that but I open the chicken sandwich and it is burnt. I did not want any additional food from this place. 

The manager continued to play the victim because I just had enough and wanted to leave.  Like she was trying to fix things but I had to suggest the right thing to do she only wanted more money for her staffs mistakes.",fTyE8UGWb_4Q05fd_H6YPg,1,0,1,R4bSeG5kvFFqTmnPD4dObg

I hadn't been to this location for quite a while; not since my last drive-thru nightmare here (look under the tips).  I was in the area tonight and craving a pineapple malt, so I thought I'd give them another shot... Waited  in the drive-thru line 10 minutes without moving, and fled  - If you want Sonic in this area, save yourself time and drive to the one on Pecos and Flamingo... I guarantee the drive will still be shorter than the wait here.  I give it two stars, only because the food and malts are excellent here, once you finally get them; and the staff is usually pretty pleasant.",f9fkXl3Cyyc1Mg18rumPBw,1,0,2,Mrt-56tDaQvlFMItVBgi6A

I seen one of the workers come out with my order. I waved her down, she looked at me then turned around and skated back into the doors. When I got out and asked what was wrong, I was told that it's against policy for them to serve a car that's backed in because they fear that the person may drive away without paying.

This made me annoyed because for 1). She could have come by and told me instead of looking right at me and turning around. For 2) You think a $6.19 coney is worth me robbing you for?

I could clearly see the manager sitting and goofing off with the other employees (including her there were 5 I could see) and she was actively engaged in shooting the breeze instead of paying any attention to customers. The guy helping us was super abrupt and really seemed not to care about the extended wait. He was more interested in bumping his crotch against a female coworker (I wish I were kidding, but I'm not). He was pretty rude, too. I got the new croissant dog and while the bun is advertised as buttery and flaky and it was a regular doughy hot dog bun. It was not good. Usually I love Sonic but I'm sorely disappointed. This one is right near my house and I doubt I'll ever go back there. It was an awful experience.",0hIXZap1f2h0NYn2ji8Vng,0,0,1,_Zts0YxNf9vo76dZsh8Fyw

This Sonic closes early, around 9 I think. The next closest one is the corner of Flamingo and Pecos, witch stays open until 11pm. Makes no sense, since you would think this one would be about the same ""busy-ness"" level.

They are the world's slowest Sonic, I swear. I have done both the drive thu and parked at the drive in. It takes forever to get served either way. No joke, one night, I sat in the drive thu for like, 15-20 minutes!! C'mon, seriously? I should have got a discount for the gas I wasted in idle.

I have read reviews were they say sometimes it's fast, but I don't come enough to compare. I'm just talking about the three times I have gone.

Everything I have ordered has come out perfect, so that's good I guess. But with that kind of wait, it had better!",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,4,2,2,Q2In08AYpjoagN28LG1zxA

Cherry and Blue Raspberry dont taste anything like grape s I also paid for the extra flavor that I obviously didnt get. The cashier was just plain not friendly. Seemed like we were bothering her. She handed us our drinks and said here ya go. I said thank you and she just kinda looked at me, so I said have a good day and then she responded while have a good one.
