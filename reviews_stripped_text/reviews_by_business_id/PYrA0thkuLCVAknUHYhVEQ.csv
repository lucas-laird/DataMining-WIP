Yelp community you've disappointed me...I hate to put a bad review on a resturant/food thats of my culture but WOW the food was HORRIBLE!!! I got the jerk chicken dinner for my husband and oxtail dinner for me. The jerk chicken DOES NOT taste like jerk chicken, TRUST! The chicken was so dry and didnt have the jerk, hot, charcoal, grilled taste...at all. The rice and peas eeehhh, the cabbage had a milky liquid to it... whatever that was and the festival dry. My husband who is American even said it was bad. He ate a few bites, threw it away and went to Farmer Boys. My oxtail was just as bad. It was filled with lots of fillers as in carrots and sauce for the lack there of oxtail and the oxtail did not taste like Jamaican oxtail. Again, the side of cabbage had a milky liquid, rice and peas ehhh and festival dry. The ginger drink was good though. I guess Yelp community gave it such a high rating because there are like 4 Jamaican resturants here, excluding Bahama Breeze. Las Vegans hear me!  Bahama Breeze for Caribbean food is the Taco Bell for Mexican food. Listen to a Jamaican, if you want real Jamaican food with a HUGE amount of portion given go to Paradise Place Jamaican Cuisine. I've yet to get the jerk chicken there because every single time I've gone its sold out!!! Thats a sign Las Vegans, like seeing Asian people eating at an Asian restaurant you know it good and close as can be to authentic. Also, the oxtail is prepared like it should along with the rice and peas. They also sell Jamaican sodas, patty and coco bread. The food is like what you would get in Miami (my hometown), New York, Canada anywhere there is a big Jamaican community. I excluded Jamaica because of course the food tastes a million times better in Jamaica. Im sorry Big Jerk :-(",w8rOqeKZCPtDu-DXXSZIwQ,0,0,1,cltdDfdSxG_WMZwC1ahnhg

The jerk chicken is roasted and has lots of flavor and just enough spice to kick it up a notch. The oxtail was so tender, flavorful, and juicy, I went back the next day and ordered it again along with the shrimp curry. The shrimp are a nice size and this dish reminds me of Thai shrimp curry...maybe because of the coconut milk. I didn't take any pictures of any dishes because I was ready to eat. All the food is delicious!!! Next on my list is the brown stew chicken. You will not be disappointed and the quality of food is worth the price.",UsLnsEHFWf6PvkEmz67Ygg,0,0,5,R5A4hG3vCtD09sYRw8xGvg

I've gave two other ""jerk"" restaurants here in Vegas a try and I've been disappointed at them all. I'm from the Midwest and jerk there is not like jerk out here. From the way the jerk is made to the sauce, cabbage and rice. The rice in the jerk dinner was dry the Mac and cheese was dead like it wasn't no cheese very dry. The jerk sauce was more like gravy.

I ordered the 3rib 1chicken combo plate with one side and a drink for $17.50. They have a variety of sauces to compliment the proteins but I tried it ""naked"" first...the chicken was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, and the flavor was perfect! I tried to pick up a rib but they fell apart as soon as I touched it with my knife which, in my humble opinion, is EXACTLY how ribs should be prepared!

1617470,2018-05-03,6,PYrA0thkuLCVAknUHYhVEQ,"I missed these jerks so much, I drove across town to see them again. Previously a food truck, Big Jerk hooked me with their amazing oxtails shortly before closing to prepare for a brick and mortar location- which finally opened in the Henderson area. Clear across town for me but worth the drive, particularly since we have so few Jamaican restaurants in Vegas.

FOOD:
The oxtails remain my go-to, huge portion and super-tender. The jerk chicken is also solid, and their new pepper steak dish was also very tender. I prefer my ribs a bit saucier, but that may just be a personal preference. They have a couple of fusion-style burgers, for the less adventurous. Their sides are also on point, their mac and cheese is a must-order for me. Yucca fries, greens, and spinach are also good but the rice and peas isn't as consistent. When it's just right, it's amazing. They also have Patties, similar to empanadas, with various fillings- the beef is classic, and my favorite so far. They also recently added an all-day brunch menu on Sundays!

SERVICE:
It's a walkup fast-casual spot, not unlike how their food truck was set up. Service is friendly, owners and management will often check on diners during the meal and they are open to feedback. Location is super clean and staff remembered me from my first visit, which is always great. Some of the newer staff are unfamiliar with the menu but the OG guys from the truck definitely live up to their ""nicest jerks in Vegas"" reputation.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,15,4,sOnTirNo1DtJI5M34zGbZw
1745439,2018-06-21,0,PYrA0thkuLCVAknUHYhVEQ,"OK.  More of a BBQ joint than a Jamaican/Jerk place.
Had a combo, with a chicken drumstick and 3 ribs; sweet potato fries as the side.

The meat was well cooked and had good flavor.
Served with sauces; sweet & a hot one.  When eaten together as served, its BBQ.  If you ate just the chicken or ribs; good but not Jamaican.  Needed more spices to stand on its own w/o the sauces.

The sweet potato fries would have been good if they were crispy and not limp.  Tried the mac cheese.  OK.  Not spectacular as other reviewers have said.",ZcLaiOcWRKBztaHkWuEUmg,0,0,3,j6qeFcudFocAhHARKPqTXw

I had the Jerk chicken, my wife had the fried chicken.  Both of the dishes were absolutely great.  The rice and peas was on point.  The steam veggies were perfect.  The pineapple Ginger drink...best non alcoholic drink I've ever had.

My mom wanted to try jerk and curry. On the jerk she wanted white and dark meat and had some other specific things she wanted to do with her combination plate. They explained that they'd never created a plate like it but worked with us and got it accomplished. 

We went and sat in the car in front of the stand and when it was done, they walked it out to the car for us. Came out hot and fresh. 

It was incredibly tasty and very impressive. The little breadstick they put in there was sweet and savory, the veggies cooked in coconut milk was delicious. The chicken was very moist.

I had the oxtails with Mac and cheese. The oxtails were perfect with the perfectly seasoned brown gravy and potatoes. I even sucked the bones to make sure I got everything. You can judge but I don't care. The Mac and cheese was the bomb as well and they served this sweet cornbread on the side. Then there was the plantains which were amazing especially the crispy ends.

Friendly staff. Fresh food. Gives you a real taste of Jamaica. Reasonable prices (although I have had Jamaican food in other parts of the country that had more budget-friendly price points).

The jerk chicken was seasoned perfectly. The ribs were delicious: a little ""well done"" for my taste, but tasty just be same. Rice and peas (can't go wrong there)! And the mac and cheese, though not Southern style like your grandmother used to make, was still very good: they used macaroni shells, but still very cheesy. 

So, why only 4 stars? The curry chicken was nothing as I expected and have had at other Jamaican eateries. A true disappointment as it tasted more like chicken breast chunks in a curry paste vs. true curry chicken.",eq3_JEuCS0liJc-T7_gYlg,0,1,4,99vGa8hkwZ5aDqu5sDVsLQ

The young lady at the cash register was very helpful and knowledgeable of the food and company overall..I had a Jerk entree w/ rice and peas, veggies and Yukon fries and a price of plantain. Which was all included in my entree, (excluding the extra side which was only an additional $1.50)
My jerk chicken was awesome! Well seasoned and moist. The rice and peas and veggies were ok. The veggies were nice and crunchy but the rice and peas could use a little more of 2 Secret but not Secret ingredients which are already a part of the recipe. The plantain was nice, sweet and thick. The Yukon fries were yummy and brought a bit of creativity to the menu. I had a side of both sauces which were both good. My only disappointment was that there was no Jerk Sauce for me to pour over my chicken and rice. There sauces were good but nothing is like Jerk Sauce. I look forward to going back for more. I think I'll have the Snapper next time.",do2uC5aWjY2gY2vB4QiUDQ,0,0,4,LDTZiVnVBLxLKNHeNyupPg

The oxtails were a bit chewy and sweet not the typical Caribbean heat and not tender.   The cabbage served with it had nothing on it, no dressing just plain shredded cabbage and it's considered a side dish 
With the meal.   It's more like a garnish

The hand patties(pies) barely had any filling in them.mostly just dough.   I'm use to big fat hand pies loaded with filling.  

the Caribbean crawler appetizer just came with lobster, no yucca fries, no plantain and the lobster was lost in the coating and heavy black pepper, it could have been tofu and you wouldn't have known it.  

Not sure if we came in a bad day as the reviews were what made us come here or perhaps the patrons just simply haven't had Caribbean food in the Caribbean to be able to compare to Caribbean food in las vegas.   Sadly our search continues to find a Caribbean restaurant that tastes and reminds us of home/vacation

Jerk Dark Chicken Combo with Mac n Cheese; OMG THE BEST M&C EVER!!!!

Jamaican Fried Dark Chicken with Spinach; very crispy and well seasoned fried chicken :) loved it :) Spinach had no flavors sadly so I had to add salt and Japanese Dashi powder to make it edible lol but it was perfectly sautéed. 

They made a mistake with one of our orders but no big deal, the server checked inside the boxes before handing them to us and caught the mistake. Ya we had to wait extra minutes while they made the correct dish again but no big deal; the service was nice and they corrected their mistake :)

Their Jerk Sauces (two different styles?) were super delicious. This was personally my first time trying out Jamaican food and it was a good one.

Food - My jerk chicken wings came with 6 wings and the plantains came with 4 pieces. The flavor of the sauce was soooo tasty! But I was really disappointed with the size of my wings for the price I paid. The size of the wings were nothing compared to wingstop or bww. It is A LOT smaller. I was really disappointed in this. I've never had jerk sauce before, but the sauce that comes w/ the wings was tangy and sweet. It wasn't spicy at all. But if that's how jerk sauce taste like, it'll get it every time! BUT the plantains were delicious. Their plantains are different than the ones I usually get at El Salvadorian restaurants. The plantains here has a crunch to them. I'm not sure if it's the burnt sugar or what, but that crunch in every bite was the best of it.

Being from Miami and having spent a lot of time in Jamaica, I consider myself a connoisseur of Jamaican cuisine, especially jerk.

5289890,2018-05-24,0,PYrA0thkuLCVAknUHYhVEQ,My son and I went to Big Jerk tonight for dinner and was very happy with our choice. I ordered the jerk chicken and ribs. The chicken was so tender and the flavor was amazing and the Ribs were awesome too. Even the plantains were delicious. We are going back Friday to hear the reggae band and I am already looking forward to more delicious Caribbean food.  If you like jerk chicken or Caribbean food this is a must try. Lastly the staff was very good and friendly. Thank you big jerk you really made my night.,6l787K7GA77hV8Ym8yXlqA,0,0,5,3SGi3HWS0Q40cpntjniFEw

The much raved on mac and cheese was smooth, creamy, flavorful and cooked in a familiar yet new and exciting way. We ordered take out and got one of almost everything! The plantains were cooked phenomenally, smooth and yummy. The chicken was LIT! It had a nice rub that was zesty and the meat soft. The ribs were huge! They also had a spicy kick. The oxtail was perfect. Portions were huge and definitely shareable. I can't wait to actually go in and check out the establishment. Cheers!",dEz2UFdllf3jONMZQgJuWQ,0,0,4,Ln2AyJVqsl2q3jLhWtFjyw

I order the Jerk Chicken and the seasoning was amazing, it's on the spicier side but well worth the struggle of taking breaks in between every few bites. The guy behind the counter has awesome customer service, he took the time to explain the menu and gave me recommendations on what to order. I will be back to try the oxtails!",pvBqha00bnJkCAbKUaG91Q,0,0,5,0Lo0xFyBNwinbi54zFchqg

The people are so nice and friendly. It was so good I had to order something for dinner before I left. So I ordered the oxtails, I will let you know how they are. I would have given five stars, but I think that the chicken pieces were just a bit small. But that will certainly not stop me from coming back every time I am on this side of town. I beg you to please open One in the Northwest after you become super successful here. And I know that you will.",G_AgCfpYj4pBHauR4fwYJg,0,0,4,j9SDKsAyVOey0wRGJzHvMg

The jerk sauce was decent, and i loved my rice and peas! The cabbage was good too. It is a great little spot to kick that Jamaican food craving. They did a good job decorating and the bathrooms are clean!!! I can't wait to come back and try some more things from the menu.",ocC1kDdcWg6hVaTDJssM-Q,0,0,4,Oi9yFeL3JwH6S0azsBNhyw
