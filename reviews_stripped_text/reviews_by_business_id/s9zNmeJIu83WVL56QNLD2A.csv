There was only one person behind the counter and she was assisting a large order.  There were two other employees but they were socializing with people in the dining area.  I stood there and waited five minuted to be served.  

Once served, the lady basically disregarded everything I said.  She stacked the food on top of itself so the sweet fire chicken was covered with the green bean chicken.  She scraped the bottom of the pan instead of getting the new tray behind her.  I pointed out the new tray behind her, she looked at it and continued to scrape the bottom of the tray to get every last ounce out.  God forbid I get any fresh food.  I stood and waited because I wanted pot stickers, she walked by and rung me up and seemed disturbed when I said I was still ordering.  By the way, got no pot sticker sauce but that's no surprise.  She rang me up and as I paid another employee yelled something at her to the extent of ""I guess you are in charge now.""  She rolled her eyes and went back to providing me with no customer service. 

Stay away at all costs. No customer service to speak of. 

It was funny because the Cafe Rio near this Panda was packed and I didn't have time to wait.  Next time I will wait at Cafe Rio.",pGxMmHxJoeKUQjlXW8cmfQ,0,0,1,7OKrHOOo6diagvDzHO1lgw

995755,2017-07-10,0,s9zNmeJIu83WVL56QNLD2A,"July 2017 update. I decided to give this restaurant another try. I ordered orange chicken and fried rice. Ate it at 9 pm and was deathly sick at midnight. So far this has cost me two days of work, a hospital visit, and the cost of medications. I've never been so sick. This tells me I'll never eat there again. In fact the nurses at the hospital I went to said they won't eat there again either. 


Previous review - This place has to be run by someone who simply doesn't care about the customers. I've eaten at numerous Panda Express restaurants before and have never been treated like this before. The sign says they close at 10:30 pm. At 9:50 they said the kitchen is closed and the only reason they stay open until 10:30 is to sell the rest of the food that was made. 

Look I get trying to have less waste. No business wants to make food and throw it away. The problem here is that they are out of the most popular item (orange chicken). Maybe smaller batches should be made after 9 pm. I don't know, I'm not the manager. What I do know is that if I was, I would have it clearly displayed on the door what the true hours are.

In other words, kitchen hours versus dining room/drive up hours. Just be forewarned that if you want some Chinese food after 9 pm, and this is your choice for a fast food pick me up, you may be stuck with the last two Veggi Rolls because the rest is gone.",p0yc1ZF5T_4oukj8xrgXWw,0,0,1,bhW850BA0ksnE5mHi1urkg

Service is pretty quick and you get your food pretty fast. This is something that is expected from a fast food restaurant. It to avoid going in the night time thought because the food served are usually pretty hard and chewy as I'm sure that they have been sitting in the pan all day. I'm normally a big fan of orange chicken but not the one that panda express serves. I think that the smell is too powerful. I do however love their shrink based foods such as the walnut shrimp and the new five flavor shrimp. I just wished that they're a little cheaper. The shrimp are usually pretty soft and its full of flavor. If you are craving fast Chinese food, don't expect anything fancy or anything that will make you go, ""wow"" from this fast food restaurant.

I love Panda Express and have been eating the  food since I was a kid. I will NEVER come back to the location on Blue Diamond ever again. It's not because of the service which I've excused many times before because you can not expect much from a quick service restaurant but I got food poisoning from my recent visit. I ordered to-go a 2 item combo with Orange chicken and chicken and string beans. When I got home my food was room temperature at best. Except for my Chicken and String beans which were cold. Like they had been sitting out for over 2 hours untouched on the kitchen counter cold. I took two bites of it and was done. Now I know people say you don't know if it was the food...well I do. My boyfriend and I eat the same thing together every day. On this particular day he wanted something different. By midnight I had terrible food poisoning symptoms and he did not. 24 hours later I am ok but I will NEVER EVER eat at this Panda location again and I hope this review saves someone else from what I had to go through.,59kbw6i9b-JLL-N_Hf1mkQ,0,0,1,uy8uY07JEsiFCvnb-kBktw

Yesterday, Saturday, at 5:30 in the afternoon we again bought our takeout from Panda Express, and everything was awful. The chow Mein noodles were dry and tasteless. The orange chicken was dry and had hardened into nuggets that were hard to bite into.
      I question the Panda Express definition of ""side."" I ordered the two-entrée, one-side plate. They place the order in a box with one large compartment and two smaller ones. Guess what? The ""side"" goes in the large compartment, and a REALLY small portion of each entrée goes in the two smaller compartments. In other words, the cheap noodles make up half my order. Actually, my other entrée was the honey walnut shrimp and I was hard put to find a walnut or two, and only four shrimp.

Well we went today on 4/18/2018 one hour before closing and everything was back to normal the only thing I didn't like is that i order there new dish steak and shrimp and you pay $1.25 for it and you only get 2 shrimps and two pieces of steak now I don't mind paying the extra money but hey guys aleast give up the steak and shrimps and make it worth the money and leave out the potatoes add more greens and peanuts and carrots not POTATOES that's not a good combination with the shrimp and steak sorry you get more potatoes then you ask for and 2 shrimps and 2 pieces of meat not fair for what your paying the extra $1.25 for and everyone was very friendly tonight but I think the main ownership was there that's why everything was running smoothly and as soon as you walk in tonight even the cooks were saying hi welcome to panda express but once again that's because the main owner was there once she leaves it'll go back to not having food on the line again and people slacking again.

3870719,2014-10-29,0,s9zNmeJIu83WVL56QNLD2A,"I recently went through the drive thru at the Blue Diamond Panda Express location. When I got home and opened my food (which was supposed to be string bean chicken with brown rice) what I found was absolutely repulsive. Old, mushy rice. Wilted, slimy green beans. Stuff that wasn't even supposed to be in my dish like mushrooms and zucchini. And absolutely ZERO chicken. They obviously serve the drive thru customers the old disgusting garbage that the walk in restaurant customers would never accept as palatable, digestible  food.  The reason why I'm leaving this review is because this is not the first time this has happened to me at this location. Obviously, they make it a practice to serve up questionable food to their drive thru customers, most likely in order to reduce food waste and keep their costs down. When I called I spoke to the ""manager"", Summer, who apologize to me but offered me no solution whatsoever. Perhaps the General Manager of this location should  rethink who he or she decides to leave in charge, and should serioisly think about re-staffing this restaurant, because it is obviously staffed with individuals who think it's ok to serve up this type of trash to their customers. What is going to happen is somebody is going to end up getting sick and this business is going to end up being sued for negligence. All in all, I drove 4 miles and paid over $6 for a bowl full of hot garbage that I would be ashamed to serve to my dog. The only reason why this Panda Express location is getting a one star review from me is is because there is no negative star option on Yelp. I think I will choose to spend my hard earned money at the Teriyaki Madness that just opened nearby. I would not set foot in Panda Express again if it were free.",Tl38LR3s2YCCB6r5nwvkhA,0,0,1,Rrf2ItcUA_1oPDQmwbraxA

Honey Walnut Shrimp, Beijing Beef and Orange Chicken. Comes with your choice of fried rice or chow mein, which is not like any chow mein I have ever seen before. I always experienced it with saucy vege mix and dry crunchy noodles. This was closer to lo mein. Wasn't too bad though. Shrimp was good, beef and chicken were meh. For fast food Chinese at $10, not too bad. Would prefer a real Chinese restaurant, but those don't seem to exist here in Las Vegas.",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,0,0,2,nUW53U7M3PHAT3DOWn3r3Q

Lately my husband and I have had been coming here quite often for dinner; the food is delicious and the quality/quanity is fair for the price! However the customer service and perhaps management needs to be closely evaluated. The sign on the door said opens at 10am (this was a Tuesday) at 10:02am they still were not open (see attached photos) the lights weren't even on! They didn't open the doors till 10:05am (causing me to be running behind by 5minutes now) they finally opened the door however there was very little options as they didn't have all their food ready and stocked...

When I walked in, I was the only customer. The lady behind the counter offered me a sample and I took it. As I put it in my mouth, I moved down the food case to see what they had. 

Just as I got ready to place my order, a blonde woman walked in behind me. The employee asked if she wanted a sample. Blondie said no and proceeded to order FOR FIVE PEOPLE. 

Now, common courtesy (or one hour of customer service training) would have dictated the clerk say something like, ""Excuse me, let me get this person's order first, as she was here before you."" Instead, she looked right through me and proceeded to fill all five orders while I stood there looking like a dope. 

Someone from the back came up to ask me if I had been helped. I told her I got a sample and then the other woman cut in front of me, so, no, I was still waiting for service. She said, ""OK."" and returned to the back without offering to help me. 

Miss Clorox was still building her order, so I went to the bathroom. When I came back, she was STILL ordering while the clerk filled to-go box after box full of food and stacked them into bags. 

I stood there and watched the drive-through people scamper around for a bit, then decided I'd just leave. As I turned to go, the lady from the back came up again, rolled her eyes like, ""Oh, you're still here,"" and asked if mine was to go. I was so excited to be visible again that I went ahead and ordered. 

I got the vegetables and the walnut shrimp. No, I didn't want rice. No, I didn't want egg rolls. No, I didn't want cookies. No, I didn't want those fried wonton thingies. No, I didn't want another entree.  I guess I didn't order enough, because she kept trying to sell me something. She finally talked me into getting some iced tea.

Sat down. Ate. Wish I'd left. It's basically pseudo Chinese-McDonalds. Not worth the effort. Oh yeah, and there were no towels in the bathroom. Fail.",OueXAik2P-eUcXbd1qGXKw,0,1,1,1gjrFU2uHJnfXM8nH2zanw

Not only were the entrees wrong, but the Rangoons we ordered were not even there, also our pot stickers were missing one. 
Funny thing about the pot stickers is they made him wait as they said they were making fresh. 
So I had to get in my car drive all the way back so I could get a refund because at this point I wanted nothing from them.

Every time we come here it is an issue
Either they forget to put an item in the bag, or they give us the wrong item.
