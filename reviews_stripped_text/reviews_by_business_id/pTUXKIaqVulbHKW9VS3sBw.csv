Back in the corner of the plaza between a vape shop and an electronics store is Kaldi's- more like a neighborhood convenience store inside than a typical coffee shop, but coffee is their specialty. All of the staff and much of their clientele is from Ethiopia, and they exclusively use Ethiopian beans.

Menu is small, with a variety of coffee and teas, some bottled juices and sodas, and a limited selection of store-bought pastries, but they newly introduced sandwiches made to order. You really can't  go wrong with the coffee, though- my vanilla latte was strong enough  to power me through a workout and then even keep me up late, and my guy enjoyed the Americano I surprised him with.

Service gets better each time I go in and I like that their hours are consistent- open daily from 9AM to 9PM. In addition to the food and drink, they have a small pharmacy section and a selection of gifts. I always grab my order to go, but they have a couple of tables both inside and out. Hoping this spot has enough coffee-loving regulars to stick around despite the hidden location- I was stunned to hear they've already been open 6 months!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,16,4,WM8_-WW-8ubKRmH8IG2tcw

(Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) We were in the area and seeking coffee. This is a very simple, casual, simply decorated shop. It looked like a former office deli that got converted. Simple menu serving lattes and coffee.

ENTHUSIASTIC BUT CLUELESS BARISTA
You could tell he had a passion for Ethiopian coffee. This was more obvious when we ordered a plain iced coffee and plain iced latte- he was surprised and commented that icing coffee waters it down. More so because he then brewed our drinks and 'iced' it down by merely adding ice. Naturally when it arrived to us the ice was melted and the drinks were still pretty hot. 

PROBABLY BETTER FOR THE ETHIOPIAN COMMUNITY
To the side are decorated, low seats and ornate table for coffee ceremonies. I'm not sure how often or when those occur. Overall, this seems like a good, unique place for the Ethiopian community to gather and conduct ceremonies - as well as get a HOT brew- but as a place with general knowledgeable baristas, I'd seek elsewhere.",nlQGyti20c07rpTSYYoNZQ,1,1,3,11xFM8OJSJZRwg15JKLC1w
3983558,2017-08-24,0,pTUXKIaqVulbHKW9VS3sBw,"Awesome coffee shop. It's owned by an Ethiopian pharmacist, that is SUPER friendly! All their coffee is imported from Ethiopia, roasted, &a freshly brewed. My girl got a chai tea latte, that tasted amazing. I got an iced caramel latte which tasted good, but a little bit too sweet/milky for my taste, it could have been a little stronger. Maybe I should of taken it with an extra shot? However, overall cute, quiet coffee shop. It would be a perfect place to study, with free wifi! The prices are fair drinks range from 3-4.50, however extra shots of espresso is $2.00, which I think is kind of pricy, but understandable since everything is fresh and imported from Ethiopia. Would definitely go back and try other drinks :)",U_ocWuKYVev4OvcA7xIGwQ,1,0,4,ghb9tp20wuUH2nxGIq_tEg

The lounge & dining area was quiet, intimate and comfortable, the barrista knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  Most importantly, the coffee was delicious.  I had a caramel macchiato-type drink, and it was sweet, creamy, aromatic and very satisfying.  The location was difficult to locate with just a street address, but the extra effort paid off.  Damned good.. go there as soon as you can!",CLtrKHnJeIuxsGmrGm1tUQ,0,1,4,gydcM5-rdRFCwAk30hzhWQ
