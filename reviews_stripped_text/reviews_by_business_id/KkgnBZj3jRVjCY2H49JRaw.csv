Thus, I ordered food from Angelina's 2 to 3 times a week. The last time, the delivery boy delivered my pizza sideways, and all of the cheese had fallen off the pizza and glooped against the edge. The establishment refused to refund my money. All they were willing to do was send me another pizza. After all the business I gave them?! This is how they treat loyal customers. I have boycotted the establishment ever since...and so are my loved ones here in Vegas.",iQumZ9swx8WRU1aWMb38rg,0,0,1,9574yHaQ2SnrIQzS3VsOTg

The lady on the call said I could come pick up another pizza or just get the next pizza free. I said ok. I recently patronized this restaurant again, ordered the pizza to pick up, however I was told they couldn't honor the free pizza because the lady who took the order which they confirmed didn't work there anymore and she did not write comments in my acct. I then said ok but how about giving me the pizza at the $9.99 price instead of charging me for the pepperoni, the lady said no I can't do that either. 
I probably ordered pizza from there twice a month for my kids but I will not be going back........",gG-ZPnJB6to5o1cbPOmTTQ,5,0,1,9c5_fU3SvTqYniBTOC5BKw

Of course I was not given my pizza, I thought it was in the bag since it was small, but nope. And on top of that the food was pretty much cold. And being as busy as they were I was nice and patient called back again, on hold again. Was told they would call me back, nope. Called again, asked if I wanted the pizza still and that the driver said he gave it to me...nope! Asked to speak with a supervisor, no supervisor call back tomorrow. Called back, still no supervisor. Called the next day, spoke to Nicole a supervisor from corporate, she said call mypizza they can't really do anything. Struggle after struggle. They credit me for the pizza :/ yuck! I call her to say don't and to take me out of the system and she has the audacity to say they will put notes on me in their system if I should ever try to order again. NO Nicole, that will never happen. And what's more you guys put me through BS and of course after 3 days of BS I'm going to get irritated and not be that nice. You guys need to learn organization, time management, and you need to have supervisors working everyday. And for deliveries, and I know this because my father in law owns an Italian restaurant out here, take only 2 orders a time when delivering that way the order stays hot and all the food gets taken to the right place. That or your drivers just could care less. Sorry so long but gezzz...

In addition he proceeded to tell me that they do not like dealing with medical professionals.  When I called the manager she acted like it was no big deal and essentially defended this type of customer service.

808873,2017-11-03,1,KkgnBZj3jRVjCY2H49JRaw,"The most poorly managed ""restaurant"" I have seen in some time. Every report of uncooked food you see in these reviews falls squarely on managements inability to actually manage. I feel for the poor employees who have had to deal with ineptitude on such a scale, not to mention the customers. The only reason this place get's repeat customers (if you exclude the bar regulars who would clearly order from whatever ""restaurant"" was attached to the same building as their bar) is because on those rare moments when everything get's cooked to completion, and the managers don't F up the employees ability to actually provide good service to the CUSTOMER, the food is actually pretty good. However, it is shameful that the employees have to deal with upset customers and even be fearful of losing their ability to provide for themselves and their families because management, and as a clear extension ownership, has no effing clue how to treat PEOPLE, the MOST important facet of the service industry. Good management requires consistency and honesty, clearly concepts these managers lack the aptitude to grasp.

  Angelina's should be reported to whatever powers that be for creating a hostile and unfair work environment as well as putting their customers health at risk for consistently allowing unsafe food to be served. They are a blemish on the service industry and I sincerely hope you choose NOT to patronize their establishment.",r1BYqZT6hHqwAEtwUiQolA,3,0,1,paULdnlONdmVpRtSglfBhQ

Just like that with no pause or hesitation hung up. Never called to tell use they couldn't deliver, never offered a refund. Just took our money and hung up on us. When I called back she called me hun over and over again with a snarky attitude. She still would not offer a resolution as in delivering the order that was now 2 hours passed or a refund. She tried to blame it on everyone and everything yet would not take responsibility for it. She even admitted to hanging up and didn't care. She said her name was Yurie and claimed to be the manager which I hope is not true. Do not order food from here unless you like donating money to girls with bad attitudes. Since they were unwilling to do anything we called one of their other locations(Charleston) who was willing to make the food and delivery it to us. Thank you Charleston for helping us and following through on what the other store would not. Why the Cheyenne location could not call us and refund the order I will never understand. Heck why did she have to hang up on us without letting us say a word is beyond me.

When I called to find out what happened to the pizza, the lady over the phone said that the delivery guy had already come by and knocked on the door and that he said my phone number that I gave them didn't work. I asked her why he didnt try ringing the doorbell, and she said he knocked and that knocking should have been good enough. When I told her I had received no missed calls and asked her when they could try to re-deliver the pizza, she said we would have to wait ANOTHER couple hours because the driver had already come out once and that we were going to be put at the end of the line. When I asked to speak to the manager, she of course said that the manager had already gone home for the day. This woman made no effort to make this right. 

I told her that waiting another two hours was ridiculous because we still hadn't even received our pizza. We cancelled our order and decided to never use Angelina's Pizza again. What's to boot, is that we got charged over the phone for a pizza that we never even received.

After dozens of trips to Vegas to visit family we had always seen this place nearby, as well as ads at the in-laws' home, but none of us (including the in-laws) had ever tried it. We were interested in getting a Stromboli and were considering the 4 Kegs, our old standby. Glad we went here, as their Stromboli was DELICIOUS! Sorry 4 Kegs, but we will get our fix here in the future unless the quality of the food was an anomaly. The Stromboli was larger and the crust was thinner, and the ingredients thick and loaded. 

The atmosphere was great, integrated with a small sports bar setting within the same building. At least here we felt a little safer, although I always pack heat while in Vegas, not having to be viewed on a camera and buzzed in like at 4 Kegs. The beer was cold, although that aspect was a little too pricey ($9 Blue Moon on tap). The service was excellent, also, with attentive (but not annoying) waitresses.

The order arrived super quick, the chicken fingers were good and a lot of them. This time however the salad was a huge disappointment. It was wilted and so so sad. Nothing about it was the same fresh delicious salad that I had the first time........ 
Torn between two and three stars. The salad was so good the first time I didn't want to give them two stars, but his place seems kinda hit or miss...... I am not much of a gambler.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,2,1,2,sZwz3XTyQPNNOEKo7-3QgQ

It was nearly impossible to get through to the Angelinas to find out if the food was coming or if we should just give up - it was a Friday night, I get it's busy - but getting hung up on twice while on hold was disheartening.

   I've tried three of their ""gourmet"" pizzas and their white pizza is by far the BEST. Lots of garlic and ricotta. And the second goes to their BBQ chicken pizza, although if you don't like green bell peppers I'd avoid this one, there's A LOT.  Lastly, I tried their pesto and I was disappointed in it, wouldn't order that ever again.
Their chicken fingers are very good, so I would recommend them, and they have good ""money saver"" specials for those and pizzas together.
As far as their appetizers go, the garlic balls for the price and quantity are your best choice. I've had their calamari and fried zucchini and you can tells its just prepackaged and all frozen. Which I understand, but the flavor is really lacking.

The pizza was a bit on the cold side, I'm curious as to their methods of keeping pizzas hot while waiting to be picked up? It was so much so that the box wasn't even warm when held from the bottom. The boneless wings sat in sauce rather than being coated in them, about average in taste but also cold in temperature. 
However in my opinion the pizza was indeed very tasty, although the sauce didn't seem to be too present visually, the taste was spot on. The crust was also very enjoyable. 

All in all I may order from here again, but I would recommend waiting around and picking up your food once it's finished to avoid getting a cold product. However I just don't think the food and service is worth the money spent.",MwOO7zQGfUbZ4ikLgjopuw,0,0,3,sdU9gu7T-HmEfVN_m3um_A

I called and asked them to deliver the 3 ranch dressings, sour cream, marinara sauce, medium buffalo sauce, ketchup mustard and mayonnaise they forgot. The female who said she was a manager, simply said ""No"" and offered a $2 credit ( I paid $3.50 for extra sauce)

I told her I paid xtra for sauces and the items were not edible without the dressings for salad and dipping sauces for the now cold appetizers and burger that included fries but I had no ketchup, mustard or mayo. I told her it was their fault. I have worked in F&B my whole life and that a $2 credit wasn't acceptable. She asked for my address and name, simply said ""OK bye, next time I'll give you $2 credit"" and hung up.

So our $62 dinner went untouched and I called my credit card company and disputed the charge for services/products not rendered. I understand drivers forget things, mistakes are made but how management chose to handle the situation was unacceptable and the business is less than 2 miles from my home.

This is my usual pizza place and the food is pretty decent, but there is always something that goes wrong that really makes this place a hit or miss. I've gone to pick up, arriving after the estimated wait, and still having to wait a good 10 minutes at the restaurant/bar. And when I'd have already paid online, they would still ask for a payment when I got to the restaurant. When I would tell the waitress I had already paid, she just said ""oh"" and nothing else. So if you knew? Why would you ask me to pay again? And if you didn't, wouldn't you at least have to verify it was indeed paid? Something was missing there. And then of course more than one occasions they've gotten my order wrong, only to have discovered it when I did get home. Today, instead of wings, I got chicken fingers, which I did not care for. The pizza was also unusually dry and lacking enough cheese, and I never had any problems with their pizza before. Very disappointing to say the least.

Two things that made me give this place 3 stars: Service and quality of food. 
On service: They seem to take a very long time on delivery. It took over 2 hours the first time and 1 1/2 hours the second time when we were told within an hour. The last time we ordered, it took an hour and a half and I had to contact them to get the status. When the pizza and wings came, the pizza was cold. 

The food:
Garlic knots/bites. Delicious. If you've seen my other reviews, you know these are one of my favorite things. Buttery garlic bread. With hot marinara. If you don't like this, you're missing out. I ate about 10 of them. It was worth the pain. 
The pizza: Merh. It's good, but I think it has a lot of sauce vs the toppings and cheese. I like a good even amount. My boyfriend loves the pizza, but it's not my favorite. 
The wings: They are very tasty AND they offer more than just the buffalo sauce! They're not super meaty wings, but they're good. 

The pricing here is pretty decent. They serve VERY large pizzas if you'd prefer and their prices on them are very reasonable. The last time we ordered, we got 12 wings, garlic bites, 1 14"" pizza with 2 toppings and 1 18"" pizza with 1 topping. I think we paid $65? Which was a shit ton of food. 

Overall, this is a pretty good place to order. They offer online ordering for your convenience and again, they're open so much later than the other places that deliver which is always nice when you run out of food for parties.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,7,5,3,2gn2NWYEnf7sYedjK2O3Jw

I have a dairy allergy so I had ordered the margerita with no cheese.  After waiting patiently and still feeling oh so thankful for food, my order arrived around 220AM.  Being in the industry and understanding this was pretty late I even gave the driver a $12 tip on top of my order of $29 ($5 for grubhub- $24 for my pizza).  So after a total of $40 for a late night za, I open it up to see it covered in cheese.  If not extra cheese.  I was upset because I can not eat dairy (and no, I can't just pick it off- I will break out in hives).  Being it to late to get a new one because it was past 2, I never ended up receiving my proper order.  I even called up around 215 to see if perhaps I could credit or anything but no one answered.  Pretty upsetting experience over a simple mistake but I work in the industry and we get orders all the time, no justification for missing the instructions with the order.
