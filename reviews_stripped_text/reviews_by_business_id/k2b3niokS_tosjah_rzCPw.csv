1173,2017-04-21,0,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,I should have checked the box before I got home. I ordered for pickup. I understand this is a pizza place but I paid over $10 for 5 burnt chicken fingers and 10 burnt fries. I LITERALLY counted 10 fries. How was that acceptable to serve on a plate as a cook and then as a cashier how could you let someone walk out with that? I was so hungry and too pissed to go back when I got home. Extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location.,gmr8Rl17Zh_xCwdl2bN_2g,0,0,1,Dm5tU_e86c6K0hbBrw_Ldw

I was surprised to see that we only had one server. It took about 15 minutes for drinks, another 5 for bread, 15 minutes to take orders, and then 45 minutes to actually receive our food!!! First the most part the food is great, but they forget to mention that their thin crust is just thick crust just not as thick as the ""metro"" way. You have to ask for extra thin crust for something nice and crunchy...they will not offer it to you. Also one entre of meatball sliders came out with cold centered meatballs. You could tell our waitress was annoyed, which was uncomfortable...but I couldn't blame her...no one should have to handle huge parties by themselves.

225750,2013-10-24,1,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR A TAKE HOME ORDER.

My significant other was at this establishment for a work function. I asked him to bring me back an order, since he was having dinner there. (why cook when he already ate?) I had him order the spaghetti with meat sauce. 

I was stoked for him to arrive home. I immediately fixed a bowl full of spaghetti. I ended up eating it because I knew I needed to eat, since I skipped lunch. :( It was still hot (coming from the west side of town, to the east), but I've had better. I guess I'll have to tough it out and finish the order over the next two days. I hate wasting food, especially at that price.

The portion size was pretty generous. It came with a big portion of salad, and a bag of some bread. The bread wasn't too great, which could have been due to the time it spent out. (a little hard on the outside, and a tad too chewy on the inside. Not a great combo). 

I wonder if the pizza would have been a better choice. But for the take out order of spaghetti with meat sauce, I was not impressed. It lacked great flavour/taste. It tasted generic. 

For a small chain, I expected better. Nothing beats home made spaghetti, but when dining out, my favourite ones are from Buca di Beppo and Olive Garden.",Gvv5hQR8BYj5f-APtKwImQ,1,0,2,Z6b6aVypStPpZznhlSdTxw

310765,2014-08-25,0,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"We've been going here since it opened, and with each visit things have gotten progressively worse.  First I have to say that TISH is the BEST!!!  She is a wonderful waitress, attentive, funny, helpful - she certainly should be working somewhere else.  She is way over qualified and too professional for this place!

We liked the pizza when it first opened and therefore kept coming back.  But in the last 3 months it has just gotten to be terrible... portion sizes have gotten smaller... food quality is virtually non-existent and the only thing consistent about this place is that it is inconsistent.  Our bread came to the table raw inside... all 4 loaves... I mean, come on people, this is a pizza place with a bakery next door.  You should know how to cook bread!  French fries were soggy. And the pizza - barely edible.  Now, I have to tell you, we order NY thin crust cheese pizza.  If you load your pizza with a bunch of meat/veggies, you probably won't notice a change.  But we did... sauce was tasteless!  I had to request garlic and oregano and still it tasted like dishwater on bread.  The response?  Well, it must be a new cook. Hmmm.... bad answer from the kitchen.  Manager never bothered to come over to the table to address the issue.  Next day - two people in our party had the gurgly stomachs, etc....

It's too bad - the place has a nice feel - well decorated and good location.  But that doesn't make up at all for the lousy food and lack of concern from the owner/manager.  Restaurants don't run themselves....  

Fortunately they aren't the only place in town - in a city this big with the vast array of options the owners should care.  But it's evident they do not.  Just like a former reviewer said, they change things and do not notify people and they just don't care about their customers.

The menu is so extensive it took us ages to figure out what to order!  But that's actually a good problem to have.  We only got to glimpse the inside of the restaurant while we waited a few moments to get our order and pay.  It was large and spacious, kid friendly, and full of warm-colored Italian decor.  It looked very welcoming and I wouldn't mind if we ended up eating here some time.  

The food was pretty tasty.  I split the Tuscan salad and the Milano pizza with a friend.  The pizza was pretty good, although I imagine it would taste better if it was straight out of the oven and not reheated by the time we got home.  The salad was also good.

I'm knocking off a few stars because they messed up quite a few parts of our order.  We ordered bleu cheese on the side for a number of our salads and they didn't get that right.  And I remember my friend stating that twice while ordering on the phone.  They also handed me a box covered in what I will assume was chocolate frosting.  Just a bit weird.  Then they gave me the weirdest looks when I asked for a napkin to wipe it off my hands.

The teamwork was very evident as servers from other stations are constantly helping each other and paying attention to the whole restaurant instead of just their tables.  The quality of the food is very high and even though the owners were not personally walking around or even at the restaurant the customer feels like they are right there because of the family feel and the importance they have showed to detail in the overall organization of the restaurant.  It feels like one of ""those"" neighborhood secret pizza parlors but in fact they are a local chain with numerous locations.  Thank you Metro Pizza!  We will be back frequently.

579625,2013-01-31,0,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"Wow...these guys really built one classy pizza joint out in the northwest boonies! And I mean CLASSY.  Beautiful free-standing building.  Inside spacious, bright, with large tables and comfortable booths. A large, inviting looking bar took up most of one wall, and the open tile kitchen with the visible ovens is another touch of class.  

To call this place a pizza joint isn't really accurate because they have a fairly extensive menu.  But of couse, it all comes down to the food and service.

The day I was there, both were very good. My wife and I ordered a house salad and large saugage pizza. I'm a pizza minimalist...to me a pizza is New York style, topped with sausage or pepperoni, plenty of cheese and sauce, and thin and chewey crust.  And that's what I got.  Its almost as good as the pizza in Metro's Decateur location, though it was slightly sweeter and less spicy.  I'm sure it'll all even out in time.

Service was fine even though our server announced he was ""In training"". All in all, a delightful dining experience and I'm sure they'll be seeing more of me.",s8WGHRc-Gs5O3n34-6Twfg,0,0,5,0Hb8-_E7CtMQlVtiCpl5mg

The pasta was bland and not worth the money. I had booked the party through the catering manager.  The manager never came over to see how the refired food was or how our party was going. I have been in the restaurant business for over 25 years. As a manager I always touched every table to make sure things were good and made a point of checking back several times on tables that had problems. The manager never checked to see how things were nor did the catering manager check back to see how things were. I guess spending $200 at a pizza place doesn't rate a call or followup. I will never go back. We tried to fix the pizza at home and we couldn't get the dough cooked. The server was great and tried to flux the problem, but the management, kitchen and catering staff failed. I will never recommend metro pizza and have told my friends who are also in the business about my experience and they won't go either. I like little small places but not this one.

We ordered on separate checks and that was to blame for the rest of the events.  Our order was nuclear fries, and 2 small pizzas.  Our friend's order was garlic knots and 2 small pizzas.  We ordered at the same time, from the same waitress.   We also ordered another round of drinks with the food.  2 beers and a wine - same beer that had been ordered for the 90 minutes we had already been there.

The beers arrived and were a different color - the waitress said they were what we ordered.  No, they also tasted different so two new one were brought to the table, they were the right color and flavor.  The waitress tells us that she put in our order correct.  Hmmm.

The nuclear fries show up -stick with pizza, not fries.  They were literally frozen fries with some cayenne dried spice sloppily sprinkled on top.  Another order of fries show up, we said we have our, waiting for garlic knots.  Our waitress brings the garlic knots and extra fry order, tells us she put in the order correct, not sure what happened.  Okay, humm.

Our friend's 2 pizzas show up.  We wait...conversation with our waitress after 20 minutes is that our pizzas should be out shortly, not sure what is taking so long because she put our orders in at the same time.  10 more minutes, the manager comes over, our pizzas are going in now, friend's pizzas are now cold because they were waiting for ours.  He was totally professional, took back their pizzas, made fresh ones so all 4 could be served together.  More beer is ordered while we wait.  Just before 10pm the 4 pizzas arrive.  Our waitress asks if everything is okay, and doesn't know what happened because she put in our order correctly.  Enough already!  Still waiting for beer now.  

We all taste a slice or two of our pizzas but now it's late, we're tired (we're in our 30s so we can't stay out late like we used to) and we want to go.  Because I was so hungry and didn't get food until so late, it was all a blur and all I can really remember is how our waitress had no idea what was going on because she did everything correct.  

Whatever, it is what it is.  Of course we'll go back because we purchased the 2 for 1 gift certificates they had on special last week.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,3,0,3,HlVbvY8xKmrXHF0jypSjZA

I recently had a small problem at one of the restaurants; but the customer service by John, one of the Las Vegas area co-founders, was unparalleled to anything experienced previously from any other LV restaurants. What was most impressive was that he reached out to me and was proactive about taking care of me and my family and making sure we were satisfied with Metro Pizza. Not only am I extremely impressed, I'm very thankful. John's concern was genuine and he earnestly took care of us.

The prices are high, but the amount of pizza you receive is unbelievable. It really is like eating two pizzas. Plus, the bread you receive before your pizza is to die for!

The joint is always very clean with kind and intelligent employees and is nicely decorated on the inside. They offer takeout and delivery and have a gelato case.

Tips:

-- Between 2 and 4 PM Monday through Thursday, pizzas are half price for dine-in customers. We always order a large and take the rest home. Slices freeze well when wrapped individually in saran wrap.

-- At 7 AM on Black Friday, the store opens to sell gift cards at 50% off. There is always a long line so be sure to arrive early. Each person can buy up to $250 in gift cards (an $800 value). When they sell out, they sell out and the rest of the line goes home disappointed. 

So, if you get the 50% off gift cards and go between two and four Tuesday through Thursday, you're getting a gigantic pizza at only 25% of the price.",7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ,0,0,5,LOe7I9s1EZMTh1U_6uvmEg

Decided last night to grab dinner there.  First thing that hit us was all the Hawaiian decor and music.  No one ever explained what was going on, but people at several other tables were going to spin a wheel for prizes so we figured it must have been a marketing promo.  The bar menu is awful.  Bud no Bud Light.  Coors Light no Coors.  Craft beers.  I ended up ordering a glass of white Sangria that came in a wine glass the size of a tea cup with ice and a slice of lemon hanging on it.  For $5.95!?  The fresh bread that came was really good but came with the single serve plastic cups of butter you get in a McDonald's breakfast tray.  We ordered calamari (which was greasy) and fried mozzarella which had so much breading and seasoning it ruined it.  My husband's meatball sub was good he said.   Unfortunately my eggplant parmesan was made with a thick layer of ricotta cheese!  Ricotta on eggplant parmesan?  No thank you.  The sauce on my pasta had separated to a big lump of tomato paste and a pool of liquid on my plate.   Took 3 bites and was done.   The service was awful and the marinara ""blah"".

1551902,2014-04-20,0,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"This is a review for their food and delivery service.

I ordered their stuffed pasta pizza. Everything in it was spot on. It was not greasy, which is really common when it comes to pizza and especially with stuffed pies. It's a really thick crust that had a bit of sweet to it, something that I love in pizza. It reminds me of pizza from Northern NJ and New York City, where I'm originally from.
Now as for the chicken wings. They are among the best I've had. Again, it's not greasy even with the sauce on. The wings are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I had the mild sauce and it was pretty spot on, just enough kick to it. 
Metro is a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum but you see it in the quality of the food you get. The delivery fee to my area was $3, which is average compared to all other delivery places. Really good service, had extra sauces for everything included.

After finding a way to enter this pizza place (it was a bit confusing navigating the entrance of this place), we were rewarded with an awesome dining experience. Our waiter, Ed, introduced himself to us. He was friendly and very helpful with suggestions, since this was our first time eating here. We decided on Garlic Romano fries & Nuclear fries for appetizers, both of them were very good. The Nuclear fries had a nice heat to it, and went nicely with the ranch dressing dipping sauce (that came with both fries). We also got the Steinbrenner calzone which was very delicious. The eggplant parmigiana in it was perfectly done. Along with a large Skyline stuffed pizza, which was both tasty and very substantial, the meat sauce on it was perfectly seasoned and not overly sweet, while the crust was very good. Sauce and crust are the most important things on a pizza and they nailed them both. For desert, we had the Spumoni pie and Cannoli. Again both were very good, but we were so full by then that we had to take it to go. We highly recommend this place and waiter Ed for a great dining experience.

1597541,2016-04-22,2,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"The hardest part about ordering from Metro Pizza was deciding which of the amazing-sounding dishes to order. While I was tempted by the pizza and pasta, I ultimately chose the Ranch Chicken Salad because 1) I had a heavy lunch already and 2) I read another review that raved about their ranch dressing. I'm known to be selective about my ranch so reading the review that claimed that their ranch is nothing like Hidden Valley (because that is NOT ranch...bleh!) sealed the deal. The salad was huge and plenty for two meals, if not three, for me. It's topped with chicken fingers, tomatoes, mozzarella, cucumbers and croutons and comes with a hunk of (sourdough?) bread on the side. I asked for an extra side of ranch and was so happy I did as soon as I discovered the absolute wonderfulness of the ranch. Definitely one of the better ranch dressings that I've ever tasted and I'm very thankful for the other reviewer for describing it in such a perfect way. This is true restaurant quality ranch. 

My only slight complaint is that in addition to the lettuce, which is stated on the menu, the salad also included spinach. I can't stand spinach and had to created a reject pile on the side of my plate as I uncovered spinach leaves. Also, I'm not a fan of cucumbers but thought I could easily pick off the slices so I didn't make any special requests. Of course, though, in this case the cucumbers were finely diced and more difficult to remove.

Although we ordered our food to go, the restaurant looks like a charming place to eat and I'd be happy to make this a regular stop if I lived in the area.",hHgNg6u9P_Ym5wLXmnoBcw,8,4,4,lFm4HAc2PfpJ8SXoKXjK3g

It's not about the hat, it's more about the policy of honest employees and an arrogant manager by the name of Evan who doesn't know how to handle a customers request.",ZdVWeS_uVWez_xl3e7ccwA,5,0,1,FdlJAkXfgTXsDPOiu0r_uw

Let's start with the good stuff... Well we ordered some sausage overload pizza OMG soooooo good.. 

Next our waitress.. After asking three times for plates I finally got up and stole it from a table. Not to mention her lack of personality and poor attitude. 

The food... Calamari came with two different sauces no one would've guessed that if I hadn't said something. Aren't you supposed to explain to a guest what you're dropping off at the table?! My parents ordered a meat lovers pizza with thin crust... Except they brought a Hawaiian that wasn't even close to thin and the waitress argued that was the thinnest even though mine was incredibly thin. Waited ANOTHER 20 minutes for the new pizza and SHOCKER they rushed it so hard that it was undercooked and doughy. Waitress continues to argue with us and it takes a manager a good 10 minutes to come to our table to resolve this.

Long story short.. The pizza was taken off, the waitress forgot about a box for the pizza after asking multiple times and got herself a well earned tip.",tEy1MNP7tHJlZgP7xqF4yA,1,0,3,taz5rF5U-unyqnMTO7Nrqw

We got there at 2:30 right when happy hour started not many people inside my daughter ordered a kids meal individual cheese pizza with light sauce.

Our waitress came up with a crazy excuse of the pizza cook did not time it well. So me and my son were already finished with our slices of a large pizza and my little eight-year-old still waiting for her kids meal. When the kids meal pizza came out it had extra sauce on it, so we told the waitress and then had to make her another one. This is where they should've comped The kids meal and a manager should've come over and apologize for the mishap. They didn't do anything, and it was a really weird experience. Not the type of Service I expect at Metro Pizza. I frequent this place often, and this is the first time that something like this happened. The pizza is amazing. I believe the waitress forgot to turn in her order, or the the pizza chef just forgot to make it and she came up with some stupid excuse about his timing being off. I mean how can a large pizza come out 25 minutes before an individual child's pizza? And then when it comes out it has extra sauce instead of light sauce?? Today it seems like a lot of people who are working in the kitchen or just constantly talking and not paying much attention.

Upon tasting it it was odd tasting and had dark chocolate chips in it. We asked the waiter and he said they were out of ice cream and used gelato instead.  We voiced our displeasure and he said sorry but didn't offer a refund or substitute item.

How about having some integrity and letting us know you are out of ice cream when we ordered it. Then when we voice our displeasure how about taking it off the bill.

The people were very nice, but the pizza was not impressive AT ALL!  We ordered two pizzas and some chicken fingers, totaled $65. for a pizza costing $25, I expected a lot more flavor! Anything. Ok, we ordered the Honolulu - ham, pineapple, bacon, onion, green peppers, we asked that half the pizza had jalapeño instead of green peppers. And it was marginal. The green pepers were in chunks and dried out, the sauce blah, the bacon bits were in a nice row across the pizza so you only had a few bites, or were completely doused, depending on which piece you got. 
The second pizza is what I use to judge pizza by as I always have this style. It was a large Mott Street: sausage, peppers and onions. Ok, first off this is a $27 pizza, for WHAT! That price is absurd. The crust was soft and doughy, and didn't add much flavor. The sauce was tasteless, as was the sausage. Peppers were dried out and the onions were barely there. I was extremely disappointed. Now, I'm Italian, and lived in CT where we get our sausage from the little Italian ladies down at the corner shop, and have eaten at the Wooster Street pizza joints in New Haven. This was just plain bad pizza. If this won best pizza for nine years in LAs Vegas, people here don't know what good pizza is. I'm sorry. I would much rather go to Blaze pizza and enjoy a less expensive pizza that has a tasty sauce, with a flavorful sausage.

I know it wasn't metro's fault but we were parked in their handicap parking {we're both handicapped and hung our sign up} trouble with this metro  their parking lot is way off to the side and far from the restaurants entrance so yeah makes easy target to vandalize patrons cars.called police filed complaint and talked to metro's manager on duty.advised him to maybe put camera out in parking lot and for him to call police so they can watch parking lot when cruising the area. told me he will have owner give me a call. of course that never happened! yesterday evening ended up making this the most expensive pizza we ever had.typical owner could give a damn about trouble we had outside his restaurant!!! we will never set foot in metro pizza ever again.just a warning to all the public be wary of eating in this establishment cause your vehicles will be at risk when you park in metro's parking lot.,meNwwy5rQlGFl6oD3qpZBA,0,0,1,cdGklNuYBc0Prwty8iD3ZQ
2680088,2016-09-04,1,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"Voted Best Pizza in Las Vegas by the Review Journal 9 times and I can see why.  They have all well know regional styles of pizza, like NY, Chicago deep dish, along with other great food offerings. 

We had the Pantheon, a white garlic cream sauce pizza topped with spinach, artichokes, and grilled chicken. The thin crispy crust was delicious with this ingredient combo. We also had the Triple play, and thin crust triple portion of sausage pizza cut into squares. Yummo!  Sausage could have had more of a spicy kick but I guess that's why they make crushed red pepper.

From the pizzas I've tried here, they are one of the best in the valley. They always have great specials on a monthly calander the prepare in the restaurant. They change the theme of restaurant weekly, daily and monthly which adds some fun to the dining experience.  Check the back of your Smith's grocery store receipts for 25% off your dine in check over $25. Deals can be had here if you are a smart consumer.

3016570,2013-05-24,2,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"I have been going to Metro Pizza since I was a wee young foodie, and I have always loved the food and the service.  There is no question why their pizza wins Best of Las Vegas  nearly every year.  Having said that, the family and I went to try the newest edition located in the northwest off the 95 between the 215 exit and Durango.  The experience was less than stellar overall.  

The ambiance and the appearance of the new Metro is wonderful.  It is very open and inviting, and the seating is well spaced.  The decor is great, with a mix of old-world Italy and sports banners hanging in the bar area.  After being seated, we were greeted in a fairly good amount of time (within about 5 minutes) and the server started out on point.  That is where the point became a jagged line.  After our drink orders were in, we asked for a kid's cup for our son, and never saw it (after asking two additional times for it).  The lack of attention continued for us throughout the meal.  I did run to the restroom to verify that I was, in fact, still visible to the human eye just in case there was an anomaly, but alas I was not transparent.  The orders were finally taken and the food did arrive to the table in a more than reasonable timeframe. 

The food is still exceptional, and even though this is a new location the quality is still very much the same as I would expect from Metro.  The service, on the other hand, continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate.  After receiving our food.  We did not see our server again until nearly 20 minutes later.  We had to ask another server for a refill of our beverages, and there was never a follow-up from our server until that 20 minute mark.  When she did finally show up, my wife asked for to-go containers and a slice of their carrot cake for our son.  The boxes did show up, but we never saw the carrot cake, or even the check for that matter!  20 more minutes passed and the server was seen checking on other tables and completely ignored us.  

This was the final straw.  We called the manager over to express our frustration and concern over the missing cake that our son was now asking every 3 seconds for (never keep a 5-year-old away from his dessert).  The manager was very courteous and did state that he had noticed the poor service (which is the first concern I have.  If he is aware of the poor service, why wasn't he out there to begin with?) and wanted to make sure that we were taken care of.  This was a very disappointing trip and one that I will have to think hard about returning to this location for. 

This restaurant's only saving grace is the food is fantastic and well worth a normal wait.  I hope that they are able to correct their poor service issues.",ucp0ZDl0qe8PxRGP01iMJA,5,0,2,wmjGWsiVhnb8okWDfP22YA

We waited anxiously for this location to open and since opening day, we've been there quite a few times. While I love Metro, I have to give them only 4 stars, mainly for consistency issues...

Let me talk about the food first though. By far, my wife and I's favorite pizza here is the buffalo chicken. It is just flat out good. The chicken and blue cheesed mixed with onions are celery are a perfect combination. And the buffalo sauce they use is great, super good buffalo taste and its not too spicy but not too mild either. There other pizzas are really good too. From the not so usual seafood pizza to your standard pepperoni, they just make good pizza! 

Appetizers are mostly good too. We can't talk about Metro without bringing up the bread. When you get it hot and fresh, it's hard not to get yourself nearly full on the bread. The garlic knots are a must try! I also really like the meatball sliders which they use garlic knots as the bun for. If you're in the mood for wings, Metro has decent wings also. The only thing I don't like too much are the fries. They use a great spice on the nuclear fries but the fries themselves just aren't quite there. 

Like I mentioned, Metro has some consistency issues. We went opening night and I can tell you it's gotten way better since then, but they still have some kinks to work out. We've had some not so great service and sometimes the pizza doesn't come out like it did the last time. Less toppings or sauce, whatever it may be. The other thing that bothers me is the bread inconsistency. Since we love the bread so much, it's disappointing getting a burnt loaf or one that's cold.

Metro is a must try in my opinion. They are a little on the expensive side but the monthly calendar with daily deals are great. And if you can make it during a weekday for the 50% off deal, its a perfect way to try it for the first time.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,2,1,4,W2YhqyYMvlqd9j-eWHnD3w

My husband got a small stockyard stuffed pizza and he said it was great and the sausage was very flavorful. I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was pretty good as well. We also shared the chocolate cake and couldn't even finish it. That's definitely a family size dessert! Our drinks were never empty and the restaurant was kept very clean.

Metro Pizza always has amazing service I am rating this in regards to my take out order on 05/25/18 we ordered a pizza with a few salads along with wings and the garlic fries!

It was about a 30 minute wait or so for all the food to be completed and avalible for pickup. After the time had passed we went to go pickup the food and the cashier at the register was polite and very nice handed my food in exchange for my money and I then proceeded to head back home. I didn't even think to check and make sure the order was correct as I assumed they would get it on the first try. 

After arriving at home we started to go through all the items and noticed that the garlic fries were not inside the bag. I then immediately called the business and let  Them now that they forgot the garlic fries at which time she asked me if it's with the wings I looked in the Box of wings and could not locate any garlic fries. I then let me know the were not and I'll be back enroute to pick them up.

I went back grabbed the fries as they were made fresh and she advised me that when she talked with the cook he didn't see them on the list although they were and she was sorry for that.  I let her know that it was ok and I picked up my items and left. 

The parking situation where I was at was pretty small although it does look like there is extra parking nearby the restaurant itself appeared clean and the employees are really  polite and nice!",r714xl9E-R62gO5K5pBspQ,0,0,3,18_xIJlFXyPlSrVlgcTo4Q

The pizza is so darn good that we would drive across town to the Flamingo or Trop location because it tasted that good. So, to have one after all these years right in the neighborhood is just such a bonus!

I will say this. The parking is odd. They have 2 separate doors. One is for take out orders and the other is for being seated inside the restaurant to eat. It isn't well marked so either door could look like either door. We parked near the take out and were eating inside. We needed a handicapped spot. The curb you step onto from the parking lot to go inside is very high. Please be careful of this anybody could easily trip and fall. I believe it could be meant to be a ramp for wheelchairs but when walking you have no choice but to step over it and it could easily be missed if your talking or looking around.

The inside is huge! There were tons of staff hustling around inside. They have a bar so you can just pop in for a drink or even have a drink before being seated or waiting on someone. There is a hostess stand where you wait to be seated and we were greeted and seated right away. A moment later a bread basket was dropped off at the table. Yum! The server came to take our drink orders and she was very friendly, nice and took great care of us. 

We ordered some ""Garlic Knots"". Delish!  They have meatball sliders that I have had in the past and they use the garlic knots for the bread you should give those a try!

I had the ""South Side"". It is a stuffed pizza and SO good! It has 3 cheeses (mozzarella, ricotta, romano) and came with a side of sauce. I love their sauce! I ordered the individual size but let me tell you it is so stuffed with cheese that this is a sharable or a take home for another meal kind of a pizza! 

The inside is very clean. The moment after someone leaves they are wiping down the tables and everything on it. 

They have a monthly calendar that has daily specials. You can get one inside any restaurant or directly from there website. You can also follow them on facebook.

We were very pleased and will for sure be back!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,11,8,5,f9sI-Sh_Nxk0a4efptLRyA

I have taken the pizza class with my meet up group 3 times. My experience yesterday may warrant a change in Pizzerias. I ordered 1 large cheese and mushroom and 1 large cheese, sausage and bell pepper for carry-out. They brought my pizzas out and he had me check them. This must have been the skimpiest pizza from metro I've ever had. When you order a pizza with just one or a few toppings shouldn't it cover the pizza just as much as if I ordered a pizza with lots of different toppings like a combination? A large has 8 slices. I could have taken all the mushrooms off the pizza and it wouldn't have covered  2 slices.  The same for the sausage and bell pepper. Okay, I get it...sausage is more expensive and may not give  them a higher profit margin in their food cost but seriously, mushrooms and bell pepper? It crossed my mind at that moment to not pay for them and express my dissatisfaction but I actually had out-of-state relatives waiting for me at home. If their ""buy 1 get 2nd half off large pizzas"" are at this subpar quality would I have received a pizza that had generous toppings if I paid full price? No thanks, I'd prefer the latter.

The WEST Side location reminds me of Miami Vice with its fun decor.

We decided on the Lg. Gotham Pizza. It was fabulous. Scotty said it was one of their popular pizza's. Everything had a perfect balance. The al dente red peppers to the cooked fresh mushrooms to the just right sauce and perfect meat combo was so good.

Scotty is an asset to your company and we will definitely be coming back.

3971648,2015-08-24,5,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"For about three hours, ten or so of us got a lesson on the history of pizza making along with a live demonstration of how to do some by Metro Pizza chef/owner John Arena.  He teaches a semester course at UNLV in this same subject so we got the condensed version.  During the time we were there, he shared with us some history, methodology, good stories, and great food.

Food items we tasted:

Meatball sliders
Pompeii pizza
Sicilian pizza
Grilled pizza with razor clams
Bruschetta with sausage, peppers, and caramelized onions on Semolia
Pasta pie
Steinbrenner calzone
Modesto pizza with sliced mozzi
Brioche gelato--pistachio gelato in brioche buns

There was not one thing I ate that didn't register a high mark from me.  The meatball sliders were moist and the buns were topped with garlic.  Learning how the Pompeii pizza was made thousands of years ago--pre-scoring the dough before baking and then topping it after baking--was very informative and the pizza was quite good.   

If I had to pick standouts for the evening, I'd go with the Sicilian pizza and the Steinbrenner calzone.  I like thick crust pizza and the Sicilian here is a thick crust that is soft and not crunchy like some I've had.  Chef Arena described the fermenting of the dough and the twice baking so the dough is soft and the ends are blistered.  The calzone was one of the lightest calzones I've had.  It had very little dough and a proper amount of filling.  This was not a lot of dough with a little filling but the opposite.

Our group had this private lesson and pizza tasting in the Lulu's Bread and Breakfast section of the building.  Helping out with the breads was Chef Chris Decker.  

This was a wonderful evening.  While our selection of foods and Chef Arena's lesson are atypical of the normal customer at Metro Pizza, I know that the food is excellent.  It's excellent because of the years of experience Chef Arena has making pizza.  With that experience, he has learned a great deal.  His passion for his craft comes out in both his class and the taste of his food.  We had the good fortune to be taught by a master pizza maker!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,11,5,b5pVrzCPl-64CK1d4--Aug

4253703,2018-02-20,0,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"I was very excited to try metro pizza as I had heard great things. I viewed their menu and saw they offered a stuffed pizza. Being from Chicago, Giordano's stuffed pizza is literally my absolute favorite pizza. When I called I asked if the pizza was similar to the stuffed pizza from Chicago, the person answered that they actually have a ""Chicago"" stuffed pizza (I did see it listed on the menu and it was a spinach stuffed pizza) not answering the real question of what the pizza was like...so I figured she had never had the real deal and I would go for it.  I asked about the sizes, it was to feed two of us, and she said well the small
Only has 4 pieces. 4 pieces sounded so small and we unfortunately opted for the large. I definitely should have realized a large stuffed pizza is very very big BUT it was early in the day and I was hung over so I though leftovers wouldn't be the worse thing. Unfortunately if you are looking for a Chicago style stuffed pizza (giordanos, Lou malnattis, unos...) this is not the same. We ordered a cheese and there is a definite crust completely covering the cheese with all of the marinara on the side. A true stuffed pizza does indeed have a very very thin crust topping the luscious cheese in the middle
But the marinara costs the top and is baked with the pizza. The crust is deep and crispy and I always use it as a breadstick. This crust was much more reminiscent of a typical deep dish pizza and didn't have the crispy texture or thickness. Super super super disappointed and unfortunately the rest of the pizza went to waste after the first 2 slices. 

Seems like I probably ordered the wrong type of pizza and my expectations of a Chicago stuffed pizza were out of line with reality. Now that a giordanos exists on the strip in Bally's if I am to spend $30+ dollars on a pizza I've learned a valuable lesson of where to order.",Mf4q6jEFuNxp7eZhOQpiYQ,0,0,1,Cd5O1Lm1ZsmFOCHstGKX6A

Albertsons had a coupon for 1.99 24pk of bottle water, so I dropped off three packs - got three cheese pizzas that barely made it out and into my truck I chomped them down.  
As it was for the month, I probably had a dozen pizzas, supporting the water drive.

The area I parked was for a business in the same building but it was closed. I walked around the building to the ""front"" and found the door labeled ""metro pizza pick-up only"". I was confused! I stood there (looking dumb) and a man walked up. He explained the ACTUAL entrance was around the corner but that I could cut through the ""pick-up only"" area to reach the full-service restaurant. How utterly confusing! I think that they need a lot better signage!

I was joining a geocaching group for a meet & greet so I found a table with 2 people (the entire group encompassed about 8 tables). The people at my table had finished eating already and their dirty plates were sitting at the end of the table (ready to be picked up by staff). No one brought me a menu so I went to an adjacent table where there were extra. A waitperson came and took my order and picked up one of the pile of dirty dishes (1 of 2). The calzone came out and the lady started to walk away. I flagged her down and asked for silverware.

I had the CHICKEN HERB CALZONE and it was very good. I enjoyed everything about it! On the down-side, I felt the accompanying marinara sauce was watery and bland.

Additional comments: Pro: pleasant atmosphere, good for groups, reasonably priced, good portion sizes, tasty food. Neutral: customer service was a little sketchy but I get the feeling that it was b/c it was a group event with people arriving at different times. Con: the second pile of dishes never got cleared even though waitstaff walked past our table repeatedly. Finally, I was never served bread even though some tables had 2 plates of bread. I didn't request any b/c I knew the calzone would be adequate but they really should have provided the bread since EVERYONE else was given it.

4655318,2013-04-12,3,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"What I miss about my New York heritage is the food that I grew up with. Especially the egg plant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. Metro Pizza has reunited me with the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. The majority of the time that I dine in Metro Pizza this is what I order.

   This location is the newest Metro Pizza to open in  Las Vegas. Ever since we drove back from the Spring Mountains this previous summer, I have been anticipating the opening of the restaurant.

   In a way, this Metro Pizza is roadside architecture. It stands at the northeast corner of US 95 and the 215, where the spaghetti bowl of the northwest valley will probably be built. At the time that I write this, the motorist has to maneuver through a maze of roadways to access the parking lot from US 95. Once in the parking lot, you are looking at the back of the building. You have to walk around the building to get inside. When you get to the front of the building, there are two entrances. One is a take out entrance in a room that sells gelatos  and other foods. The second entrance is for dining in.

  The dining room is large, and I feel nicely themed. To the right is a bar with flags of colleges hanging above. Toward the back is a mural of popular pizza families. To the back left is the open kitchen. And to the left is the take out room slash bakery. Throughout the restaurant is sufficient seating.

   Before entering Metro Pizza my mind was decided on ordering the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. At a cost of around $10, it is worth the money. Especially when it includes french fries. For the most part, I was happy with the hero. I do have a tiny weenie complaint. The hero could of been warmer.

  In general the service was good. Yeah, there was a wait for the food. I expected that on a Friday night. Our waitress was on top of the complimentary dinner roll refills. By the way, I ended up filling up on them. Toward the end of the meal, the waitress probably had a brain fart. This would be one of the strangest moments I experienced dining out. It was material for a Sinfeld episode. When the meal ended, my brother and I ordered coffee. A few minutes later, our waitress returns to the table. She goes up to my brother and says this is the last of the coffee and we are brewing more. I am thinking, ""Excuse me. Am I invisible? Could you have asked if one of us wanted the coffee, or let us know that more coffee was coming on the way?"" Feeling like the ghost of Metro Pizza, I sat there watching my brother sip coffee for what seemed like a good five minutes. When I returned to being a physical being again, the waitress presented me with coffee served in an Izzy cup. I was under the impression that they brewed their own coffee. They serve Izzy coffee. My taste buds regard it as decent. If I had brought it in a coffee shop I would of added a flavored syrup to it. 

  I will return to Metro Pizza. Their egg plant Parmesan hero is a product that keeps me coming back.

But it is the method for which the pizza is placed in the box and steam to death I guess. Out of all the pizzas I have ordered all over this country, this was a new one for me. I had spoke with a manager (Chris) there before and he was rude as all can be about it and very challenging. As a customer, if I pay you good money for quality and you fall short, then stand behind your product and make things right the next time. Leave out the confrontation or ridiculous compromises. Do as you say, deliver as you promise. 

I don't think I will keep my business with Metro going forward. Too many pizza options in Vegas to deal with bad attitudes.",EoE6FzB6LXY5LfZ5UZEPRw,0,0,3,y51ySRf7t0moXUKuGnu3vQ

The beer offerings were adequate and was served fast and cold. The dinner salad was the worst I've ever had. A seriously 'why bother' experience. Iceberg lettuce, stale dull croutons, a couple of cucumber and sad tomato slices. If you can't make it right, don't make it at all. Wouldn't take that much effort to make it so much better. The main event, pizza, was much better. Good crust, not thick, but not too thin either. Very good sauce and generous toppings.

My wife is the Store Manager of a national chain retail store and frequently treats her staff to lunch. On many occasions she has ordered a total of 6 pizzas to be delivered to the store the next day and it has never been an issue. Unfortunately tonight was different.

She asked the girl behind the counter for an order to be delivered tomorrow to the store but was told ""wouldn't you rather order tomorrow so it would be fresh?"". I am not sure if she thought we wanted it cooked tonight and delivered tomorrow but that was not the real problem. She went to the back to ask the Manager on Duty - Paul if they could deliver tomorrow and was told no. Since my wife has done it many times before she asked to speak with the manager. Paul came out and began to make excuses like I don't know how many delivery guys I have tomorrow, the other store may take some of my delivery guys, I already know I have one order,etc. If you already have an order than apparently you do what we were asking.

Since this is the age of reality shows, and Metro was actually on one, don't you think that customer service should be crucial to a manager's duties? Paul made an issue out of a normal request. We than left Metro without placing the order and proceeded to another pizzeria and placed the order with them, no issues and no excuses.

I feel, if you're going to rate somewhere and it be a deterrent to others to visit, you should have better reasoning other than the petty reasons people are listing. Just because you're having a bad day isn't a good enough reason to give a shitty review. Base it off of the food, service, cleanliness, etc. If you're in a bad mood, I'm pretty sure you're going to try to find the shittiness in everything - even though you shouldn't. 

I liked this place a lot. The service was fast and friendly and the food was very good. 
I would say that the prices are a little above my liking and that's the only reason I won't go here as often. But, I will pay extra when I want good pizza. I hate most American chains and I don't ever order from them. I don't care that it's cheaper.

We had - 

Milano Pizza - it's their version of a white pizza. It was probably the best I've had in town. Very garlicy but they always are, and I dig me some garlic. Highly recommended if you like garlic too. 
Half pepperoni/half sausage and olives. It was very good. Sauce was perfect, crust perfect and toppings were very good. The only thing is there was a hell of a lot more olives than sausage, but I'm not picky. I love both. 
Hot wings - very delicious. Their buffalo sauce is very good here and it had the perfect amount of spice. They fried them perfectly. It wasn't too thick of breading, it was light and crispy.

I would highly recommend if you're in the area or if you tire of the normal pizza joints.

Not quite as banner a year for Las Vegas Pizzaiolos as 2017, though the continuously growing Expo once again set attendance records for a city that now enters the conversation of America's Pizza destinations with regularity, it was just past noon that a table was set in front of ovens where John could tell of Metro's history as well as stories of countless Pizzerias across the world, his praise of others constant  and unyielding  whether the person has been doing it for decades or if they are just beginning and willing to learn.

Planning the visit based on one travelers assertion that John Arena's 718 Calzone is amongst the best things she has ever eaten, the fried pocket of Whipped Ricotta and fresh Mozzarella plus a bit of Ham almost impossibly light despite a quick bath in hot Oil, it was while John and Chris were working side-by-side that Beverages were served alongside Metro's complimentary table Bread plus four Garlic Knots and Fries, the former sliced and centered by tender Meatballs plus Sauce and melted Cheese for about the same price as just the Knots at some Las Vegas Boulevard venues.

Going off-menu from here, a plate of housemade grilled Bread served with imported Salami, Burrata and top-shelf Olive Oil, it was straight from the hands of Chef Arena that a golden-brown Pie featuring blended Flour plus toppings of Cream, Pancetta and Pistachios impressed all by being light and crisp yet appropriately chewy, the supposed ""second ever"" Grandma Pie from Chris inspired by watching the team at King Umberto hot on its heels and nearly sheet-pan thin yet rigid with nothing but the basics allowing no room to hide any mistakes, though as expected there were none to find.

Whipping up one last novelty before popping next door to Lulu's Bread & Breakfast for a special request, a bi-layer Pie stuffed with Nutella and reduced Blueberries eating not unlike a Galette and inspiring a story from John about the history of ""Dessert Pizza"" both at Metro and elsewhere, it was finally in a steamy slice of Bread Pudding French Toast riddled with Peaches that Lunch came to a conclusion, everything about  the visit as educational as it was delicious and each guest exiting smiling as broadly as the two guys who really seem to live the quote ""Find something you love to do, and you'll never work a day in your life.""",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,5,YkDtdPM-1EkIfP6tEMZdTQ

I wasn't surprised by the still mediocre food give to us. First off, the cheapest large pizza this place has is 17$. That's just for a cheese pizza, and it goes up to nearly 30$ for specialty ones. Luckily we came here during their half off time- which is nearly everyday at a certain time. It should be a warning when a place has  half off their food nearly everyday;  it is ridiculous to pay full price for this food.

It's very bland, in my opinion. The sauce tastes like glorified ketchup, and the cheese is tasteless. The garlic knots were only good because of the cheesy powder they are covered with, but again, the sauce that comes with them is not very good. I hear a lot about the crust, but I don't see what people crave about it. 

Service was alright, there were only a few tables occupied (which is strange since this place is so big and SO popular) and we waited a long time to be seated and served. 

Overall this place is ok, if you pay half price (8$) for their cheapest pie, but other than that, you won't see me here.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,11,5,2,_hehBgUPubT55j5E-lF1Zw

OK, so I'm a fan of the Ellis Island location. so I figured why not try out this location as well.  I love the buy one get one large pizza deal they have at Ellis (Sundays) so I confirmed with the person taking the order on the phone that yes, they have the same deal as Ellis Island buy one get one.

So, I arrive and go into the takeout entrance to pick up the pizza.  When I go to pay, ""Brit"" tells me the total is $31 and some change.  I said, ""hold on, you told me it was buy one get one when I ordered on the phone so total should be around $21"".   She starts to argue with me and says, ""I never told you that, our deal is buy 1 get one half-off"".  So I said, ""I would have never ordered if that was the case because you said it was the same deal as Ellis buy one get one"".   We go back and forth a few times.  Obviously, she doesn't know what buy one get one means.

Then, I couldn't believe this, Brit, snatches the pizza boxes off the counter and acts like she is gonna put them away back in the kitchen.  With major attitude, she snaps, ""Well do you want them or not""!?  I should have asked for a manager by now, but instead pay the $31 cause I'm starving and figure I'll speak with manager from home.

The 2 large pizzas were not up to normal standards for Metro. Just soggy, salty, and just plain sad. Nasty!! 

So I call back 2x and am put on hold for almost 10 minutes, then she says our manager will call you back in a little while. Ok fine.

Receive call back from manager Jen who was actually helpful and apologetic. I explained the situation and told her that if an employee of mine acted like Brit, she should be fired on the spot.  So I got a $10 credit for my next trip.  But don't think I'll ever return.  Best off that I stick with Ellis Island Metro Pizza.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,2,1,1,C48BB0zm4-sFYpziEf1gVQ

Showed up at 8 and our server has the largest party. No clue why they didn't sit us elsewhere so we could be served faster. 8:20 and we finally got our order in because he was busy taking phone orders in the icecream area. 

Hopefully the food comes out hot!

FAIL! Meatballs came out cold. 
Side salad was full of non green lettuce. 
Needless to say I'm not rushing back.

The northwest needed a nonchain and nongaming restaurant like this.

The place is very roomy and open inside.  It has a welcome family feeling to the atmosphere here.  I have been there twice and the service has been good.  Also, they have specials everyday.  They had a special for the Rebel game, and in this town that has little support for the basketball program, this deserves a high five!

The garlic knots were really good.  The bread they bring out to the table tastes great too, I would buy a loaf to take home.

This time we ordered a spring street pizza with regular crust.  Meatballs, ricotta, red peppers, green peppers and topped with fresh basil.  The basil was a nice touch because the aroma gets the taste buds going right away.  The sauce is tasty - not too sweet but a nice fresh tomato taste.  The crust on their regular pizza is somewhat thin but still holds up well to the heap of toppings.  The crust had a nice crunch to it too.

They have a thick crust option and stuffed pizzas too.  The prices are reasonable especially if you consider one pie could fill up 3-4 regular eaters.  I was stuffed on 2 pieces.

This place just does what a restaurant is supposed to do: good service, they take pride in their food offerings, clean and welcoming atmosphere and fair prices.  It makes it obvious why some places are busy and some places close down...",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,1,5,NT2--J_Np8SwsQZTZ06rIA

5837913,2018-01-27,2,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,"This time around, despite knowing that ample stomach room was needed to address a large pizza to come, fresh Pizza Dough Bread slathered with butter just could not be completely resisted.  At least I limited myself to just 2 slices!

A bean-studded Small Minestrone Soup differed somewhat in ingredients from previous versions but was still packed with fresh mixed vegetables & pasta.  And a Small Dinner Salad graced with Metro Pizza's own formula for a zesty, tomato-based Italian Dressing was another great starter, along with a cheesy Mozzarella Stick.

But, as usual, top-notch saucy and cheesy New York style pizzas were justifiably placed squarely in the spotlight.  A Large Ham Pizza with Extra Cheese greatly pleased Diane; a Small New York Pepperoni Pizza satisfied my two dining companion friends; and I was quite happy with my order of a Large The Gotham Pizza with added cooked sliced Tomatoes, which was already studded with a whopping six included toppings: Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, crunchy Green Peppers, Ground Beef, and Onions, and featured a perfectly executed supple crust.  If I were to order this pizza again, I would have reduced or eliminated the Onions, which were just more dominant than I prefer.  But this is more of a quibble than any real complaint.

Seating at two joined tables was comfortable; the casual Italian ambiance authentic for a pizza parlor; and waitstaff service swift, accurate, and commendable.

This pizza was 30 bucks and by the way no pepperoncinis! I could have ordered 4 mediums from dominos, paid less and had my dinner tonight!

We came to the North store and we were promptly seated. Ordered the Eggplant Parma and salads with garlic knots. The eggplant was cold???  So were the garlic knots???

When we tried to find our waiter, hardly ever came by the table, to let him know of the issues, we had to grab a bus boy to go find him. Told waiter to box it up so we could go home and microwave it. 
Our water glass remained empty as well.
Sad day for Italian.

Ok, things got a little better,  as we were leaving I saw a man whom I believed was a manager. I asked him and he was.  I relayed my above review and he was surprised that staff told me he was to busy. He wanted to refund my check and I told him I just wanted him to know.

They have several promotions going on daily to save money which is always a plus. When we were there it was Disney weekend. If you had on Disney attire or dressed as a character, you received 25% off your bill. You can also get a free spin on the wheel of prizes for every large pizza you order.

The service is slow.

But this is what got me. I went in for lunch with a friend on Tuesday. My friend and I split the bill. We each paid around $15.00 with tip. The waitress took at least 20 minutes to bring us our check.
The next day I checked my back account and noticed I was charged twice two different amounts.
I called and spoke with Chris(manager) who told me it might have been because the waitress pressed the wrong number and tried to cancel the transaction and it should be reversed by Friday. I called Friday to tell him the charge was not reversed. He looked into it and told me the waitress charged we wrong because she forgot to take off the free cannoli for our birthday. 
So she charged my card again after removing the the cannoli. 
Before I could get my money back j had to prove to him that my friend paid(thanks corporate), which she did. 
So after a week in a half since my original visit I finally got my money back. 

Chris did a wonderful job handling this situation. He stayed in contact with me for every step and was sincerely apologetic. He's the only reason this store didn't get one star.",5bI67_CVxFy8PPL7E3BLqw,1,0,2,65-KzkwWRIf6Bb9-DNbCyA
