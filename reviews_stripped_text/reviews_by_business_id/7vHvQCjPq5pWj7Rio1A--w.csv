Glad it is because I was completely satisfied with the overall visit and have been back several times since the first. Fresh, clean flavors. They don't serve Blue Fin Tuna though, at least that's what they told me. Courteous and attentive staff. Lots of dining space to accommodate any size party. My kids enjoyed it also and they'll adjust the menu to take care of finicky tastes buds. Prices are fairly standard sushi prices and they have AYCE, which is all I'll do. It's all or nothing for me!

I came here for the AYCE, my first impression was the decor is nice and open not cramped and dark. After getting ignored by the host I finally was able to put my name down. When she called our name she went to seat us... at the bar... I don't mind sitting at the bar sometimes but this time I was on a date and wanted a table normally they ask if you want a table or if the bar is ok however she did not ask me just started sitting me at the bar, I politely asked if we could have a table instead I don't mind waiting a little longer to have a table and she obliged and got me a table within minutes. After sitting us down at the table I had no other interaction with anyone after about 15 minutes I asked a bus boy (you could not tell who were the bus boys or the waiters) if we could get some drinks and he said he will get us some he came back promptly with our drinks and took our first order or sushi for us. We received our first 2 rolls fast and they were delicious but this is where it got even worse.

After we finished our rolls we picked our next, and waited, waited some more, since we didn't have an actual waiter visit our table I had no idea who was a waiter or a bus boy or who our waiter was or anything. After 30 minutes of people walking by over and over and waved one down and asked if I could order some food he said ""of course has no one taken your order?"" I said no, everyone just walks by and looks at our empty table. He took our order and the chef then bought us our food, well some of our food we didn't receive everything we ordered. After another 30 minutes I waved down the same person and said can I order some more. He gave me another surprised look that no one had taken our order again. Long story short it took 2 hours from being seated to get just a couple rolls. I gave up in the end, I left hungry I did not want to wait any longer for half of what I ordered. It is the most unorganized place I have ever visited. It seemed like no one knew what they were doing, no one had sections to serve everyone was just all over the place. 

Would never come back here, would never recommend it to anyone. They need some major leadership skills.",q-DtyUV1_LUonngyVMHp7A,0,0,1,ypumwC3kKZ8My1szEgUgkA

364501,2013-03-04,0,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"For me, this place was just A-OK.  I came on a Saturday for lunch, by myself and sat at the bar.  I was pumped and ready for AYCE sushi.  For me, ""sushi"" means rolls - I just don't have much interest in the other foods.  For my starter roll I always like to order a spicy tuna - as a judge for my comparison to other places.  To their credit, the Spicy Tuna roll was the largest roll I have ever seen.  I later learned (though it is not listed on the menu) that I could order half-rolls.  Honestly, one roll in and I was starting to feel full - ARGH!  It was a good roll.  

Next, I picked one of their fried roll specials - the Mexican roll.  Now this was new to me.  I've never had a fried roll.  Honestly, it just wasn't very good to me.  I should have stuck to what I know best and not deviated too far.  The roll was larger than the first one and each piece was too large to eat by itself.  Bummer.  I couldn't finish the roll - it was just too much. 

So my AYCE excitement was crashed when I could only finish one roll and a half.  I didn't get to try anything more.  Call me lame for sticking to rolls at a place like this, but it's what I prefer.  

I will add that the place just felt weird to me.  There were about 6 men working behind the counter and the kitchen - and only 3 customers.  Several of the men came out to ""catch a glimpse"" of another female customer eating by herself.  Kinda creepy.  

I wanted to really like this place, but my experience just didn't do that for me.",JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw,2,0,3,5_wfE73M3pdqORu1-M65gA

The catepillar and tempura spicy tuna roll were just what I was looking for. It went downhill quickly from there. Every subsequent roll was just plain bad. Maybe I'm just not used to Vegas-style sushi (what is up with all of the wacky/sweet sauces--you're supposed to be able to taste the fish, people!), but I just couldn't deal with the weird combinations. The sweet/fruity/mayonaisey sauces that were on all of the other rolls were just disgusting. They overpowered the flavor of everything, so that all you tasted was the sauce. I eat sushi for the fish, not mayonaise. The cajun albacore? I can't imagine a japanese/sushi restaurant outside of vegas selling that as sushi. It was waaay too strong and there was not that all-important fresh fish flavor that you want from sushi. Everyone working there was super-nice and efficient, I just don't think I'm part of their target demographic.

The quality of the fish is top notch, and Chef Jin can make up some crazy combinations for you to try if you let him.  What I really liked is that the pieces of Nigiri style sushi weren't overly large like some places, and he for sure did not over rice on anything, which at an AYCE place is a wonder.

The service is very attentive and the place is small enough that even when it's busy the service doesn't suffer all that much. The owners are nearly always there cooking and watching over things.

For lunch you can't beat the two roll special for under $9. It comes with choice of two rolls from a list of 14, soup and a wonderful mixed green salad with yummy Japanese dressing. The boxes are around $7 and a lot of food for the money. My wife gets the teriyaki chicken box. There is soup, salad, mac-salad, Cali-roll, rice and plenty of chicken. 

For dinner I get the sushi platter that comes with 7 pieces of sushi, yellowtail, salmon, albacore, Eel, whitefish, choice of cali-roll or spicy tuna, soup and salad all for $13.95.My favorite rolls are the spicy yellowtail and Bluefin special roll. I have only had the all you can eat once about a year ago and it was good too.

The edamame is sometimes a lil over done and the mac-salad often has a bit too much black pepper for us. All in all the value, quality, service and experience are very consistent. We love this place!",RO_4PXpV2_KfzKmCkF0ayA,1,2,5,pMCDlAwVR34bCKfokLrsVA

Going to any restaurant in their first month since being open, I always get a little worriesome because there's so many kinks to work out. However, hearing from many friends and coworkers that the sushi was absolutely great, I had to make the trip out. The dining room isn't terribly large - maybe seats about 30 inside but there's a large outdoor ""patio"" which I could see myself sitting during the cooler months in vegas. However, the sushi bar itself seats about 12 and when I arrived for lunch, being open for only a few weeks, I was surprised but happy to see half the sushi bar was already taken up and few tables dispersed throughout.

 Looking over the menu, prices weren't bad at all with good lunch roll specials. Their hot foods menu was very limited but the roll list more than makes up for it. The chef recommended their ""Blue Fin Roll' and it was to die for! We tried a couple other rolls as well as some sushi and their tuna poke salad (yum!).  All the fish was extremely fresh and well cut. Most importantly, the flavors were so clean and well balanced. Something I appreciated the most. Service was ok - it was our waitress's first day of work - so nothing I'd hold them against. The sushi chefs were extremely friendly and quick.

Now here's the thing... in a land of ""all-u-can-eat"" sushi bar town, they don't do it. But it probably ended up being cheaper than an all-u-can-eat because their rolls are so big that i even had to cancel a couple more I wanted to try knowing there was no way my bf and i could finish them (and we're big eaters to begin with!) and the quality of the fish greatly surpassed most sushi restaurants in town. 

If you appreciated great fish and flavors I highly recommend this place! If you're looking to just fill up and don't care what it tastes like, I'd say you're better off sticking with any all-u-can eat in town.",bKGgPuuLg5aWrZVKxCD2hA,0,0,4,ZZsP7RPNu1ex4ZZnufd1-g

852493,2010-05-16,5,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"With so many AYCE sushi places in Vegas, the wife introduced me to Blue Fin Sushi, and I think our sushi cravings have found a new home in Vegas.   The fish was of better quality in comparison with other AYCE places.  The pieces fish were chilled (not warm, like in some places we went to) and exquisitely sliced in large portions (some places do a hack job!).  I think the wife and I are purists because we tend to focus on nigiri, instead of the rolls.  This is the main reason why I will come back...the sushi rice.  The sushi rice is amazing here. It has been seasoned so well.  The texture of the short grain rice flavored with the slight hint of sushi vinegar is absolutely perfect for me.  For example, when I take a bite of the super white tuna nigiri, I first taste that slight hum of rice vinegar from the rice on my tongue.  My tastebuds then witness the sweetness and slight creamy flavor of the fish as it slowly intermingles and compliments the vinegar flavor from the rice as I chew.  The wife and I also request that certain sauces should not be poured on the nigiri, such as amaebi.  I just want to taste the rice and the fish, and chew slowly so i enjoy every bit of it. yummm.  The other stand out item to order here is the soft-shell crab appetizer.  This is probably one of the best places that this is prepared.  They use a panko coating/batter and deep fry the think.  It's like eating pork tonkatsu, except instead with a crunchy and crispy crust covering a moist and  tender soft-shell crab.  Definitely, we will be frequenting this place more often.  Plus, I still need to go back to try some Okinawan beer.",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,11,7,4,47KUG1P9hADQ_3scTsc1QQ

Nor did my Miso soup, edamame, after asking for a 3rd time; we were done.

Everyone from the busser to the waitress to the sushi chef rarely smiled and did not engage us unless it was necessary. And by necessary this means coming back every 30 seconds to ask if I was ready to order (as I was clearly still reading the extensive menu). None of them wanted to be there. I don't know if something had happened there earlier, but everyone had a somber face. I actually missed work while I was at lunch because everyone at my office is happy! We had empty glasses of water and dishes sitting at our table for about 15 minutes before they realized they should probably come over and provide whatever service they provide. 

Blue Fin Special( In: Cajun Albacore, Cucumber / Out: Tuna, Salmon, yellowtail, shrimp and avocado with Chef special sauce) --- I am SOOO glad I only ordered a half roll because this was just not edible. It was the mushiest thing I've ever had the displeasure of eating.. loaded with sauces that mask the natural flavor of the fish.. I only had one piece out of the 4 because I wasn't about to force myself to eat this despite the all you can eat policy where they charge you menu price for anything you don't finish. 

Johnny Johnny Roll (In: Mild Spicy Soft Shell Crab / Out: Spicy Tuna, Avocado with Yum Yum and Spicy Ponzu Sauce) --- This wasn't as saucy/mushy as the Blue fin roll, but it was equally as terrible. I ate two out of the four pieces.. There was just nothing special about these ""special rolls."" The fish didn't taste fresh and the sauce was just overpowering. 

Spicy salmon hand roll & salmon skin hand rolls: These were good. They're very basic rolls though, so they're hard to mess up. I actually had these before anything else, so I was very excited to what was to come.. only to be disappointed!

Baked green mussels --- this is served in an escargot dish.. They really skimp on the mussels.. instead of getting a whole mussel per spot, they cut them in half.. so you're eating a tiny bite that might as well be considered nonexistent considering the amount of cheese they cover this dish with. You seriously might as well ask for melted cheese, because this is what it was. I was highly disappointed by this dish, as baked green mussels are one of my all time favorite things!

Scallops --- omg. this was fried to shit. It almost tasted like they reused oil to fry this.. couldn't even taste the scallops! 

Chicken katsu curry --- this was fairly tasteless.. the chicken was bland and overdone. This solely served the purpose of getting rid of my hunger -- It was uneventful and forgetful. Boooooring.

I was more than happy to pay the a la carte price for all the sushi I did not finish because it was so sub-par. However, they were gracious enough to not financially or digestively punish me in this situation. They simply removed it and hopefully gave it a proper burial.

HOWEVER, the highlight in this discovery is that this would be a great restaurant to take your companion if you wanted to break up. It's private, everyone's in a bad mood already, and the parking is close.",eLxR9WkbmMfRKLOKDabr_w,4,2,2,bbIjUfJSfWtG83fjMFYzrg

By the time I finished the small bowl I had removed almost a full jalapeno!  (I was starving or I would have complained).  My lady ordered a mixed fish roll that clearly didn't have what it supposed to on the inside ($13 roll) but she was also starving so nothing was said.  We were both still hungry so we ordered a Kari roll (pretty sure I spelled it right)  on the menu it said it had soft shell crab in the center (and only soft shell crab)  We got the roll and dug in.  First bite I noticed it tasted like mayo (overwhelmingly ... also a $13 roll) and I looked at it.... sure as shit it was full of crab stick!  We ate the fish off the top and left the rest.  Our waiter came by and saw this and asked if everything was okay....  I proceeded to tell her the roll didn't match the description on the menu.  She then spouted off and said ""we always mix in crab stick in all our soft shell crab.""  Which i replied that it should say that on the menu like it does with all the other rolls.  I told her I didn't enjoy my poke salad either because it was overwhelmingly hot.  She kept looking at my lady like I was crazy then brought us our check....  no manager came to apologize or anything... $45 later we left upset and discouraged.

After about 30-40 minutes later, they said it was burned and asked if we wanted something else (as if to say they were sorry). We wanted to get the tempura ice cream anyway. So we ordered it. Final bill came in and they charged the tempura ice cream. Other restaurants would likely have done that at their expense to redeem themselves from the food burning. Not Blue Fin.

As a hardcore sushi fan, I only order nigiri and sashimi when I eat out so this review is not for their rolls if you're a roll lover. Point to note: this restaurant does not have sashimi on their AYCE menu, but I've never been to such a place that insanely does that.

I ordered the following nigiri: salmon, mackerel, red snapper, unagi, albacore, and amebi (sweet shrimp). The unagi was delicious, but the rest were mediocre. The amebi should be called ""a-mini"" at this place because it was the perfect representation of Japanese related entities as depicted on Family Guy-- indeed it was ""tiny everyting."" The sushi rice was unseasoned and dry, but was edible because I had waited until 3 p.m. to eat lunch. I also ordered a seaweed salad, which was not bad and tasted like all the seaweed salads I've ever tasted. 

Like I said, the staff was nice, but even at 3 p.m. when not many customers occupied the restaurant, service was slow. I appreciate the sushi chef though because he kept motioning the 5 or so servers to speed up.

I personally have to be in the mood for deep fried sushi, but when I am - this is the spot! Also, they have azuki bean (red bean) ice cream!

Fish was fresh, rolls were tight, rice was correctly portioned, and even better than all of the above was the service.

Where to start?  I lived at the apartments by that intersection and EVERY SINGLE DAY after school I had to make a decision. Make a left to go home or make a right to Blue Fin.  Let me tell you, 8 times out of 10, Blue Fin won.

Their lunch special portions are great for the price.  I usually get the 2-roll lunch special and end up not having dinner.  In the event that I go for AYCE (which is quite often), I LOVE their ikura (I think it's the best in Vegas) and that one roll with the guacamole (I KNOW, right?

It may not be the most traditional sushi joint ever (especially since I have been spoiled by Little Tokyo in LA), but it's sushi with a little 'fun' mixed into it (without being too far out).

The staff has always been awesome and very attentive. I've never had a problem there. Once and a while I'll take my notes with me to study while I sit and eat yummy sushi in the patio area. Also, whenever my family comes to visit me from California, I always take them to Blue Fin.

We tried Blue Fin because it was closer to my neighborhood than my go-to spot. The reviews on Yelp (thanks guys -_-) seemed great, so we decided to try it. How can I put this...Blue Fin is like that pathetic ex boyfriend that you refuse to waste your unlimited text messages on.

At the start of our meal, we were greeted by a smile-less ""have you been helped already?"" Now keep in mind this is a sit down sushi restaurant, not a fast food establishment. Shortly after sunshine took our orders, the appetizers arrived. It must've been fate or something because I've always wanted to try really chewy calamari! The kind where you take one bight, and the whole thing comes out of the skin because it was cooked so well! How did they know?!! 

Then we received our rolls. Are you people effing kidding me? Yes, the rolls are big, but I prefer quality over quantity. They are made with too much overcooked rice and last week's catch of the day. So gross. So once our first roll came out, we decided  to be brave and try other things off the menu since we ordered the all you can eat. Where was our server? In the corner, staring blankly at the t.v above our table. I was staring at her, said excuse me, sent a pigeon, and shot a flare gun trying to get her attention...NOPE. 

Our busser was great! He took our drink orders, cleared our dishes, took the majority of our food orders and wait...where was our waitress?? Standing in the corner of the 10x10 box, (in which they call a restaurant) staring at the t.v and checking her phone. You could tell it was the type of place where they shared tips, otherwise I would've would've only gave 10%. I really hope he got my tip because she didn't deserve it.

At the end of our meal, she just drops off the check. No smile, no ""thank you"" nothing. So that's when I asked ""were you our server?"" She said ""yes"". To which I replied ""really? Cause the busser took most of our orders while you were just standing in the corner watching tv."" ""Then she said  ""the bussers are supposed to do that, whoever is closer. I did not watch tv at all."" ""Do you feel like you did a good job? Cause I did not."" Her response was ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" Thank you for your backwards apology sweetie. I really appreciated it. I'm sorry too. I'm sorry that not only was the food disgusting, so was your attitude.

I started with salmon sashimi, not the best piece of salmon ever but not the worst either and came with a pretty radish garnish. 

The server brought out edamame, a nice gesture and not commonly complimentary at sushi places. It was dried out but can't complain too much for the price.

Salmon skin salad was hefty, a whole lotta skin to go around. However, there was too much sauce again. The vinaigrette was overwhelming and permeated the greens completely. Imitation crab was just sad (a big let down after being in Maryland where there is shellfish aplenty), especially for a sushi place. Don't even try this at home.

Caterpillar roll also was drenched in eel sauce and it was impossible to taste the actual eel in it. I did like the generous amounts of avocado wrapped around it, but all I could taste was rice and sauce.

We had the AYCE option and got multiple orders of nigiri; several orders of yellowtail [probably too many, but it's the boy's fave and sooooo good], salmon, tuna, uni, unagi, amaebi & octopus/tako. All were fresh, tasted sweet and the uni, unagi and amaebi were especially fabulous. The uni was the freshest I've had at any AYCE, with a glossy sheen and a lovely buttery, creamy texture and sweet, subtle flavor. Unagi pieces were large, supple, served warm with the sauce warm and thick. Normally not a particular fan of unagi, it looked so good that the boy couldn't resist. The amaebi were like the photograph, with a gorgeous sheen and transparent, tender flesh, as well as having the deepfried heads to the side. The boy was impressed by how the drops of batter on the end of the shrimp's whisker/spine looked like a flower. :} I ate the heads, and they were great- had a good flavor and were cooked perfectly. We also tried the Rock n' Roll and the Bluefin Special roll. The Bluefin special was the better of the two, with a great spicy sauce studded with lots of masago and herbs. Very flavorful & quite a big roll. The Rock n Roll was tasty, but it lacked the sauce that makes it truly outstanding. We were still happy to see it on the menu, though. At one point, we asked the chef to create a special of his choice for us and he made a roll with lots of yellowtail, masago, crab, herbs and other things. Very yummy. Tried the calimari tempura and baked green mussels as well. The calimari had a light crispy coating, not too greasy, and had a nice springiness without being too chewy. My boyfriend was particularly enamored with the presentation of the mussels, in a small bowl with little indents to hold the individual mussels in a bath of flavorful mayo sauce. Lastly, the poki salad was good. It was a combination of tuna, seaweed salad, shredded daikon, lots of herbs, and a flavorful sauce- and was another favorite of the boy. There were many layers of flavor, and it was different from the usual poki I run into. It was actually the first thing we tried and we were both rapidly impressed. 
It was quiet when we went, so the orders were prompt and we were given ample attention. As soon as we finished the waitress cleared the path for the next order, and both sushi chefs were friendly and chatted with us while we ate. Two other groups ate during the time we were there, which makes me glad because the food is GOOD, and this place needs to prosper!

During prime dinner time be prepared to take a seat and wait, but I promise you it will be worth the wait. They do have an all you can eat lunch/dinner special, personally I have never done it for 2 reasons. #1 - they will only serve you one roll at a time and will not bring you the next roll until you finish what is on your plate (I like to take my time and try a few different ones all at the same time). If you don't finish you can't take anything home and you will be charged for the full roll price. #2 - Between my husband and I, we will order 4 rolls (normally 2 specialties and 2 normals) and we are stuffed. Kicker is, we pay less than the all you can eat special, and that's with 2 beers. So doesn't really make sense for us. I'm sure if you came with a really big appetite you would eat your $$ worth.

And they were willing to customize everything, which was impressive.  Eric ordered some great salmon nigiri with avocado that was not on the menu.  You can order half rolls if you don't want to commit to a full roll. My favorite was probably the garlic tuna nigiri.  Yummy.  I could eat that all night.  We also had red and green tobiko.  Very Christmasy.  The only thing I will avoid in the future is a crazy yum yum sauce.  I should have taken Lisa's advice and got it on the side.  Too mayonnaisey. (I'm just making up all my words today!) We got some special rolls that were amazing.  One with chopped up soft shell crab and salmon.  Sooo good.

The other nice thing was that they have a variety of desserts and you can get as many as you want for the AYCE price.  Most places it is just mochi.  Their strawberries jubilee with caramelized strawberry sauce, vanilla ice cream, and a warm beignet... amazing!  

I did enjoy the fact that my dining companions did not have sushi phobia and didn't insist on ordering everything fried or with cream cheese like some of my other friends do.  That makes AYCE miserable for me because then they can't eat it all and look to me to help, which I don't want to do.  Service here was excellent and they don't enforce the 60 minute time limit or eat everything rule too strictly.  But still, it's rude to order a ton of food and then leave it on the table.  No worries with this crowd.  Great time, great place.  I'm definitely dragging my husband here.  He hates AYCE, but I'm sure he'll love this place.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,6,6,5,x9x_fF2o3tPJajlFG77Piw

First off the rice in the nigiri was a little bigger than i like, and seemed to be old, possibly reheated, but I guess thats to be expected at all you can eat.

The fish: they did not offer toro, but the Super White Tuna (Escolar, Walu if you're from Hawaii) more than made up for that, super soft, tender and buttery;  just don't eat too much, (google it, you'll see why) 1 or 2 orders per person should be fine.  Hamachi, Hirame, Tai, Salmon, unagi, were all good.  Spicy tuna hand roll was packed full to the top and is an attempt to copy the spicy tuna of Hawaii's genki sushi (the gold standard of spicy tuna).  It has sesame oil and tobiko for some texture.  The owner is from Hawaii, so i guess he would know.

I'm not one usually for rolls but i did get a few just to try.  I highly suggest you try the Yuri roll, a california roll placed on is side covered with avocado, scallop dynamite, and eel sauce.  Rich, fatty and delicious!

Appetizers, and desserts are all you can eat too!

I like their hours, 11 - 11, they don't close between lunch and dinner, so you can go whenever.  No ridiculous lines (at least for now), Friendly and attentive service.

The nigiri had very thin slices of fish and way too much rice. Every roll I ordered was drenched in sauce, perhaps to mask that the fish isn't very fresh. Again, waaaaaay too much rice! I feel like they want to stuff you with rice so you don't order so much for AYCE. I don't know why there are such fabulous reviews about this place. Perhaps because others haven't tried Goyemon or Yama or Sushimon.

I thought they were closed when we first walked in because we were literally the only couple there. We walked through an entire room of empty tables and were sat at a table next to the bar. I don't mind that at all - it helps the food come fast! The place filled up as we are, sort of. It was still half empty on our way out. We may have just come at a weird time but it was around dinner. 

Thier sushi is good, their fish is fresh. I don't have any complaints about that portion. Their rolls left something to be desired. Again, as usual, I ate everything but wasn't blown away by anything. Their service is average, which isn't a problem if your food is great but if your food is average you should at least make it up in service. The selection of appetizers is lacking. The only appetizer that I loved was the soft shell crab. The mussels tasted like cheese, and I know cheese normally comes on baked mussels, but this was not my style. I could hardly taste the mussels it felt like I was just eating melted cheese. 

I love that fried ice cream is included in the price, the normal sushi place I go to makes you pay extra for anything but mochi. We got vanilla fried ice cream and it came with chocolate syrup and whipped cream and was easily the most delicious and satifsying part of my meal.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,8,5,3,qzR8jSAZNoPN0vfNLTNv6w

Small bottle of sparkling water cost about $4, which I feel is insane, knowing this place is not a fine dining establishment.

We typically go to Yama Sushi, but since the word is out of what a great place they are, it's hard to get in there on any night for dinner, so we have been going to Blue Fin! Their AYCE is $25.99 per person I believe for dinner and includes everything on the menu. My favorite item on the menu is the garlic tuna and super white tuna. I'm still a sushi newbie for the most part, as I just began eating fish a little over a year ago for the first time in my life, so Nigiri/Sashimi is a little intimidating for me, seeing a big hunk of raw fish on a small round of rice. However, both are so delicious! Their super white tuna is so silky it melts in your mouth. My favorite rolls are the Royal Philly (deep fried philly roll), the Hawaiian Roll, and their new one called an Italian Roll.  It has (forgot what type of fish) but a balsamic oil on top of it. YUM!  
Also, if you like green mussells, or mussels in general, try their baked green mussels. My BF ordered 4 of these the first time he tried them, and the other day he ordered 3 of them. We even got a first time visitor to Blue Fin to rave about them.  They're shucked pieces of mussel in a tiny round dish with about 7 little wells each with a piece of mussel. It's then covered in what seems/looks like butter and/or mayo, and then some kind of cheese and baked. My BF loves it!  No restrictions on how many either. They also offer tempura ice cream in either green tea or vanilla. We had it last time and they had carmelized strawberries on it. Sooo good!  Definitely check it out!

No really. Just come here. They have AYCE sushi. AYCE sushi is top secret code for we love feeding you sushi until you burst. They have some amazing sushi. 

Speciality sushi rolls are all the bomb. Ultimate blue fin, volcano, and *** are just some. Some of the rolls are loaded with sauce so just ask them for sauce on the side or ask for half roll as is.

I even did the hand rolls which comes in a stand that can hold 3 hand rolls and sometimes they're so big that the stand can't hold it so no stand is used. Try the salmon skin hand roll its good.

For nigiri all excellent choices. I had lots of nigiri uni with quails egg, tako octopus,... Get the garlic ahi nigiri drool.

The poke salad was ok. It was stretched out with lots of non-ahi ingredients like some of the other sushi spots here.

They didn't have oysters on the AYCE menu and I didn't order shrimp tempura but everything else was amazing enough to make me not care about it. 

For desserts they have red bean ice cream, not small scoops but regular size ice cream scoops. Mochi and fried tempura ice cream. All that are also AYCE.

So good that I almost did AYCE lunch the day after I did AYCE dinner. When's the next time. I'm actually craving sushi today. Next time has to be tonight LOL

The cons: $21/lunch, screaming o was covered in watery mayo, tuna poke had sliced carrots (but I like the seaweed salad addition), baked mussels were covered in mozzarella cheese, fried soft shell crab was a ball of fried oil, crab ""meat"" still looked like imitation crab (I've never pulled meat from a crab that looked like that), mochi was overly frozen

Overall I always order nigiri so I wasn't too disappointed by the things that I didn't like, I just prefer the traditional take on baked mussels and tuna poke. I will come back because it's near by new job and my sons preschool.

We honestly thought it was closed because the parking lot was nearly as empty as the inside of the restaurant. However when we got inside we were guided to our seats at the sushi bar and greeted by a very exuberant sushi chef. We perused the menu for a moment and began the ordering frenzy. AYCE be damned, we were going for the gold.

After several rolls of varying shapes and sizes we began asking for suggestions. The chef is very amusing, often tempting us with other people's orders and simply saying ""don't be shy, order more!"" To which was happily replied, ""oh we will... we will.""

And we did this, through several different rolls. I have a couple of favorites:

White Tuna Nigiri: Super clean and fresh. Cut superbly and just melts in your mouth.

Unagi Hand Roll: As good as you can get anywhere. Definitely fresh and the sauce they drizzle on top is great.

Blu-Fin Special Roll: Perfection. Just try it and you'll understand.

The staff is super friendly and eager to serve. 

All in all, we ended up with: Rainbow roll, Tiger roll, White Tiger roll, Red Dragon roll, Caterpillar roll, and the Wet Dream roll, plus vegetable tempura. All of is was fabulous! The White Tiger roll is very garlicky and amazing. The Red Dragon is a must for tuna lovers. The Wet Dream is ultra rich and should be eaten while you have plenty of belly room. The only roll I didn't love was the Caterpillar; the eel sauce at Blue Fin tastes very caramel-y, something I don't love. 

The AYCE selection is really, really great. If you can't find a handful of rolls, hand rolls and nigiri that you like, you clearly don't like sushi as much as you think. Anyway, here are the details I couldn't find beforehand: AYCE has an hour time limit. There's a separate menu for it. They say that they'll charge you the full price of any roll you don't finish, but we didn't finish one and weren't charged for it. I don't get the impression that they're sticklers for the rules, which is great (as long as you don't abuse them!). Its $25.99 for dinner, $21.99 for lunch.

(I did circumnavigate the building trying to find the front door...cuz I'm cool like that) For almost the whole time, we had the place to ourselves and that was great. Filled up later with obvious regulars. 

Now, I'd been waiting all day to chow down and try to thank Lilz for saving my life (AYCE = the international symbol for ""I love you, man"") and we were two chicks with a mission. We had: edamame, teryaki veggies, super white tuna, hamachi, salmon, halibut, tuna, & uni nigiri. All were very good: I really liked the fish:rice ratio and the rice was delicately flavored and held up nicely. Can always tell I'm loving my sushi when I don't even pour soy sauce. Mmmm. Neither had interest in the mayo/funny named rolls: instead Lily suggested the Salmon Skin hand roll ""Sunnyside Up"" (chef referred to adding yummy quail egg this way) This could be one of my new favorite things!!! So delish, textures & flavors galore. We finished out with a cucumber roll, both readying to throw in the towel. Those last few bits of rice were hard to manage: but we are badass!!! 

Of course all of that ""I can't eat another bite"" disappeared when I spied my kryptonite = strawberry mochi :))) Lily had the green tea tempura ice cream, which of course I HAD to taste and it was light and refreshing. 

The sushi chefs and servers were quick and friendly and even brought a whole pot of green tea to Lily while keeping my water full. Only a couple of misses: gyoza we did not order appeared and left, and they brought vanilla tempura (didn't ask which when she ordered) but cheerfully swapped it out. 

Only gave 4* because I didn't eat as much as I have @ UYE/I can't move feasts, but the quality of food and service lead me to believe I'll bump up on future visits. And there will be future visits when I'm lamenting my bud being in the City by the Bay...or just in the mood for some great eats with matching service.

My husband and I have been here twice, and both times have had no wait, and sadly, not very many people. People are missing out by driving out and waiting for an hour for a table at Goyemon. The fish here is SO fresh and their pieces of Uni are always big, overflowing, and fresh. The fish to rice ratio is fair unlike some places where I have to take out the rice from my nigiri (and then pray I don't get charge). When my husband and I came last, we ordered a ton of nigiri and a sushi chef would always give us cuts of sashimi on the side of that fish. It was much appreciated!! 

Although my husband and I often order nigiri (our favorites are white tuna, spicy tuna, halibut, sweet shrimp, and UNI!), we also tried some of their rolls. The white tiger was very yummy and so were the fresh rolls that I don't remember, but they have some very yummy and appealing rolls on the menu.

We usually go for dinner and always do the AYCE which is $25.99 per person around that time of day. You definitely get your money's worth when you do the AYCE versus ordering à la carte.

The good thing about the AYCE option is that things like appetizers and desserts are also included in the menu whereas most AYCE joints in Vegas only include the sushi or are very limited to what you can choose from. The appetizer menu includes the usual edamame, Miso soup, shrimp tempura, and vegetable tempura. We always order a few to tie us over while waiting for our sushi, which comes out pretty quick! We've never waited long. As for the sushi... Wow! Blue Fin has a wide variety to choose from, which makes it so hard to order! Every. Single. Time. A few of our favorites include the Red Dragon, CM 4 Ever, Tiger, and the Fire Cracker which is a deep fried roll. The fish is always fresh and sliced to perfection! Each whole roll is 8 or so pieces which is definitely enough to share! (Or not) Some rolls are even available in half portions if you ask! If you have room for dessert, the tempura vanilla ice cream is a must. They also offer different flavors of mochi ice cream too!

The bland baked mussels were topped with a nasty rubbery cheese, swimming in oil and presented like vomit on an escargot plate. Also, what's going on with the rock & roll? It looked nothing like any of the pictures on yelp - we were served a brick of imitation crab and a dot of tuna smaller than my pinky nail and a side of gross thick mayo (cream of sum yung gai) that tasted like artificial sweetener. Same thing with the screaming orgasm - their sweet mayo default is awful! And of course the orange salmon roll was stuffed to the max with imitation crab meat and garnished with a paper thin slice of salmon. Regrets! I have them! 

The proof is in all of the pictures I uploaded. Absolutely disgusting. I was extremely offended by every single item of food that was brought to us, all of it. We ended up having to spit out a ton of rice into about 6+ napkins and we left upset and unsatisfied.

Also to top off an awful birthday dinner in BFE, our waitress had attitude for days. I read several other reviews that mention rude service from a women here - probably the same atrocious lady. Why is she even in the service industry? Serving food?! Why!!??? I seriously can't stand this place. Get me out of here!

PRO TIP: if you care about quality AYCE sushi without all of the cheap fillers - I highly encourage trying our top spot for AYCE sushi: Sakana (on Maryland) it's like night and day compared to this place.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,89,77,1,QVRvLU8YFI73qR7WxcUXzw

Ok so fast forward almost a year later, I wake to see them comment on my post on their page. I figured it would be a generic comment like, ""I'm sorry you had this experience please come back and let us try again"" type deal. No! The person from Blue Fin shamed me for leaving a comment and accursed me of being a paid troll by the competition. I couldn't believe it. They touted all of their other five star reviews and that there was no way they could get a one star review. I get that a lot of people like this place which is why I went.

It was a fun night out with friends with lots of laughter.  The service was excellent, granted it wasn't crowded at all which surprised me for a saturday night, but the entire staff was helpful and worked together well keeping our glasses full and the food coming out efficiently.  
We started with the Screaming orgasm appetizer, and the tuna poke.  The sauce on the screaming O was different but still very good, the poke came with seaweed salad and had a nice kick with flavorful spices.  
We ordered a bunch of rolls as we all got AYCE and just went family style.  From the red dragon roll, to the rock and roll, the sunset, johnny johnny, and the tokyo express were the only ones I remember someone ordering.  I didn't taste them all but the ones I did were great and flavorful and I know everyone else was happy and satisfied.  My favorite was the rock and roll as no rice and so light and refreshing.  The cucumber wasn't overwhelming the fish either.  
No five stars as the rock and roll is the only one without rice and you can only order one Screaming O and poke per AYCE.  Also compared to some other places we have all been together the dessert choices included were only average.  One of the guys even said the mochi was very dense.  
But we made it fun and enjoyed a good meal with lots of laughter.  They only have one bathroom though so be careful how much you drink as we were waiting for someone who drank too much!

The Volcano roll was probably my favorite. It was lightly fried on the outside which gave it a good crunch and it was different from all the other rolls we tried that night. 
One thing that I did notice is that blue fin uses a lot more sauce than most other sushi joints- we got an Over the Rainbow roll which is your typical rainbow roll but it was served with the chef's special sauce which was plentiful and a little overpowering at times. 
Also- I didn't think the tempura ice cream was too successful. The tempura part did not cook right and was just too soggy. I've had this at other sushi restaurants with much better success. But I did enjoy the green tea ice cream",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,0,0,4,4C5D1NTW3-yhVIOtautncw

The waiter comes back with the 007 for you. What I would recommend for the waiters is maybe put numbers on the table to help memorize which sushi belongs to which table. Back to the sushi, one word: Amazing! We had the all you can eat and we had nine rolls of sushi. Those rolls were 3 California rolls, Tuna, Spider, 007, Royal California, Sweetheart (I think that's what it was called), and and another roll (I forgot what it was called).

While there is certainly an ACYE option, which looks great, my man and I trust Jin, sushi-chef extraordinaire and proprietor, to surprise us every time we eat at this fine establishment.  To his credit, he never disappoints... and surprise he certainly does! His handroll creations (his spicy yellowtail with special sauce and shiso-tuna handrolls are our favs) are excellent.  But, his take on a sashimi salad (one specially named for me) takes the cake.  I'm admittedly biased - wouldn't you be if you had a salad named after you?  But, then again, you can't be all that biased when this particular sashimi salad is made up of a spicy tuna poke nestled in fresh greeens, a medley of generous cuts of salmon, tuna, yellowtail (and whatever other fresh fish is at his disposal that day), and a dash of truffle-oil! We are also big fans of his cajun albacore sashimi, which is spiced to perfection, and his signature Blue Fin roll (it's the cilantro flavoring that gives this roll its extra boost).

The staff at Blue Fin is friendly and extremely family-oriented.  In fact,  Jin and his lovely wife, Yura, often work side-by-side to ensure a great resto experience.  The rest of the staff is also pleasant and always aim to please.

My girlfriend and I arrived here on a Saturday. Plenty of parking spaces available, parked right by the door. Inside was pretty much the same. The sushi bar was full, but there were plenty of table seating.

The decor has some elements that make me presume that this was once a small French bistro. The doors for the individual male and female restrooms have characters wearing berets. An outdoor patio has some decorative lamps that certainly isn't Japanese inspired.

Seeing as how there's a 1 hour time limit, we set our timers at 12:30pm. We probably stayed a slight but longer than that, and they weren't strict about kicking us out.

The target audience of this restaurant is aimed more towards local Las Vegans than tourists. There are some good things to be said about selecting this place over casino buffets. All you can eat sushi. Certainly cheaper. No fighting for parking. Friendly service (our waitress was always around). Clean facilities. No waiting in line. No gasping for air because of smokers.

BUT... it is far from the Strip. While the cuts of the fish look aesthetically appealing, the quality of the fish is spotty: some great (yellowtail), others okay (super white tuna, tobiko, masago), others not (salmon, ikura, shrimp).

There were a few items that weren't included on the lunch menu, such as uni, sweet shrimp, and something called the ""Screaming Orgasm"". I mainly don't go for the specialty rolls, so I can't really speak out for those. I did order the One item that stood out for me was the crab meat sushi. Mmmm, that's not something you normally see. Wished those were more common.

Lunch is $21.99 and dinner is $25.99. Decent price. Noted on the menu is a charge if you leave leftovers.

Service is good, as our waitress kept coming back. One sign of good service is never having to ask for your own refill, and she certainly was attentive to keep checking our table. Which isn't hard since we were pretty much the only occupied table. Not that I'm complaining, just making an observation.

Dessert items are also included with the sushi gorging, which includes several variations of mochi and ice cream. As we got our bill, we were also served with orange topped with plum juice. 

That being said, the place isn't bad at all. I ate my fill and then some. But speaking as an out-of-state visitor, it might be worth the trip if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so.",D3kM83KJ-0TceDEOyqKflA,2,2,3,Cgh53JmH_c5xHS4pDKcocw

For about $20 you get an hour of AYCE sushi, which includes rolls, sushi nigiri, appetizers, and dessert. The only limitations were that a few pieces of fish are not offered during the lunch hour. Rolls can be requested to be made as half rolls, except for fried ones. Options for appetizers include edmamme, fried tofu and miso soup. Dessert options included oranges, ice cream, mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream!!

The cucumber salad was just ok, but the boyfriend loved the crab meat on top! The seaweed salad was over dressed. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_...)

I think what happens is that the trend reviews really skews reviewer's perception.  Either that or I just went on an off day.

In regards to overall atmosphere, appearance, quality of food, and variety, Blue Fin doesn't come anywhere close to Goyemon.   This is coming from someone who believes that Goyemon has been on the decline of late.

I left Blue Fin full, feeling sick, and wanting my money back.  What the hell is in the sauce on your eel and rolls.  Do they put cornstarch in there to thicken it?  The Udon soup tasted foul as well.  The fry they use in their soft shell crab and agadashi tofu was definitely not japanese.  

The only saving grace of this place was their salmon skin salad which was delicious.  Still, there is no reason for me to come back.   There's probably 100 sushi AYCE places in Vegas and I would rate Blue Fin as average.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,8,2,2,9rt-L4YKemsID8JS5eCYbw

I don't know whose brilliant idea it was, but the server brought everyone at our table a complimentary appetizer created by the chef. The appetizer was a mix of rice, tuna & seaweed slivers all mixed together with a drizzle of truffle oil and some other seasonings. It was yummy. 

I ordered the Sushi Special Combo- 7 pcs Sushi- Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Albacore, Eel, Shrimp, White Fish with California or Spicy Tuna roll and miso soup and house salad. I opted for the Spicy Tuna roll. I never got my miso soup, but I didn't mind because the complimentary appetizer was far better. The sushi, itself, was okay. The fish tasted fresh, but I didn't really find the rice to be good. I've had better sushi elsewhere.

This was my first REAL sushi experience because I always thought I was allergic so needless to say I was terrified! I was really nervous that I wasn't going to enjoy it and insult the chef by spitting it out or choking it down (You dirty birds).  Quite the opposite happened. Not only was it completely tolerable, but I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! 

We did the AYCE and I don't recall everything I tried, but here are some of the highlights: 

Ahi Tuna Salad- This was the first thing I tried and was surprised by the delicate texture of the tuna combined with the crisp cucumber. Off to a good start. 

Rock n Roll- My favorite roll there probably because it had some sort of mayo on it and rice which are both on my cheat list usually. It was all wrapped in cucumber. If I wasn't dieting I would have ordered more. This is the roll I fantasize about the most. 

Spider Roll- Crunchy goodness. Nuff said. 

Teriyaki Chicken- Hands down the best I've had. It was so moist and not overwhelmingly sweet or greasy. What a perfect option for those non-sushi eaters(FYI- You are on the wrong team!) 

Lastly the sashimi.....OMG. The chef sent this over special for us because I was with one of us that eats here often. It was yellowtail simply drizzled with truffle oil and melted like butter on my tongue and that's when Blue Fin and I had a moment..... Up until then everyone at the table was watching the nonfish girl eat fish and I was trying to be graceful about the chewing, etc. . Not now. I wanted to eat it with my hands like Animal from the Muppets. Animal like sushi!!!! Being the lady I am, I contained the inner Animal, but it was still apparent to the table that this was my favorite. Probably the drooling noises gave me away. 

All of the fish was so fresh and the presentation showed the pride they put in to each dish. Five star experience from start to finish and I highly recommend it to everyone I know and don't know.

We've never been here and everything on the menu looked wonderful so we asked the sushi chef what he recommended. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, as well as what fish was freshest, and was able to recommend two rolls that we LOVED: Their signature Blue Fin roll and the Wet Dream.

I absolutely love naked fish sushi bar but it's on the other side of town so I've been desperately trying to find a place that can come close. I always drive passed this place so I figured I'd give it a shot, definitely regret walking in. A few things:

-it was freezing inside
-the tap water had a weird taste. Maybe it was the glasses? Stil, yuck.
-Service: ok once you ordered but until them they stare at you and constantly come over to see if you're ready. Note, their menu is HUGE. It took me almost 10 mins to look thru the menu. 
-menu caters to AYCE ($26 dinner) because the prices are so high. All rolls are over $11. You can half certain rolls btw.
-rainbow roll: unfortunately I halfed this roll, it was the better of the two rolls I tasted but was nothing special.
-happy ending: far from it! Weird flavor combo. A vamped up Philadelphia roll with lemon slices and garlic ponzu sauce. It was mainly a garlic and lemon roll since they over powered the rest of the roll and left a bad taste in the mouth.

They are very friendly and attentive here, which if you read my other reviews, is a major thing with me.

The all you can eat sushi is really a treat, huge variety and everything is fresh and well prepared. Service for lunch or dinner is always prompt, but it can be a bit too much service if that makes any sense. Tonight we came in around 7pm and it was not very busy, just a few other patrons having dinner. We were seated right away, served right away and finished plates were removed from the table within seconds of taking the last piece! Super service to the max. Sushi is always fresh, (although we did have one occasion where we both got a bit of Motezuma's revenge, but we will overlook that somehow). Yeah, I know, but no one is perfect and we won't hold a grudge.
There lunch specials are just right in portion and the price is about the 10 dollar mark, which is really good for a decent sushi lunch with soup, salad and 2 rolls that come out on a sushi boat dish.
The place used to be tiny with just a few tables, but now they can handle a good size group if they have to and  often there are some large parties being served. Overall, minus a star for the overly eager service and the non traditional music they play gets a little distracting and does not really fit the decore or atmosphere for dinner. The all you can eat is a grear value and I am sure some big eaters can really do some ""damage"".

I cannot completely write off Sin City, because once you have Young's garlic sauce, or his mussels, you will seriously crave them for days after... but, Blue Fin executes all their dishes delightfully well.

Jin, the owner (I believe) is from Hawaii. The first night I went with my boyfriend, it was a quiet Sunday night. We were served by a young woman who was also from Hawaii. Service was fast, friendly, and extremely patient!  Blue Fin has an exceptional selection of rolls, appetizers and nigiri.

My boyfriend and I usually get a lot of nigiri, and that night was no different. We had garlic tuna, hamachi, ika (with salt and lemon), amaebi, cajun albacore, tako, and a bunch more.

Great fish to rice ratio, and the few rolls that we did try were a good size (*PLUS, they do half rolls!*) 

They have awesome appetizers. I love mussels, but the mussels here are a little different from everywhere else. So just be aware that when ordering mussels here, they are already off the shell, and come in a special dish. We also had their tuna crab cake, salmon skin salad, and ""poki"" ( i always spelled it poke.. hmm)

All came with shredded beet and carrot toppings. I don't like beets AT ALL, regardless of what Dr. Oz says about the nutritional value they possess, it detracted from what would have been all together delicious, again, my own personal opinion.

Anyway, the restaurant setting and my overall experience here leads me to conclude that this restaurant is a solid 4 stars. Their quality of fish is on the higher end as compared with some other popular names in the AYCE sushi world.

My wife and I were the ONLY ONES there for lunch

We did AYCE as usual, did some nigiri, tried specials, tried different rolls, and we enjoyed the Chirashi(off the menu) so much, from attending Lisa L's UYE, we asked if we could order it...Jin wasn't there, but the other chef, Ynot was. we showed him the picture told him about the Yelp event,etc. so he checked with Jin's wife if it was possible.

This is what she said:

""Oh, this takes longer to prepare and this is for VIP people only.""
I couldn't help but mumble to my wife, ""F--K ME, I guess we're not considered VIP"".

We were willing to pay
we were willing to wait
WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE

Chef Ynot sensed that we were pissed and disgusted, our orders stopped, and we just couldn't believe she had the nerve to say what she said...SERVICE IS PART OF THE DINING EXPERIENCE!

immediately chef Ynot made a roll on the fly and named it the Sylvia 
Roll. Thanks, but too little too late. As a business owner, every customer should be treated as a ""VIP""

We finished the roll, thanked Chef Ynot and walked right out the door.
Thats the last time we'll ever go there....Thank goodness for Wayne's, Sushi Mon, and Sin City, Places where we're ALWAYS treated like VIPS....ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,16,12,1,G788l0F5MNJLkoyB1CB4cw

They're all so very nice and attentive. A local, small business and gets their fish shipped in daily to ensure you get the freshest of the fresh fish we could get (say that three times).

My fave:

YELLOWTAIL COLLAR: Super fatty full of flavor, slightly sweet with a smokey taste. All yellow tail and barely any collar bone.

SPICY POKE SALAD: sssooo good, refreshing, and light with slight kick to it. If you are looking for a light meal for lunch or dinner to pick at ala carte. This would be a fine choice (that is if you're choosing between the seaweed salad and the poke salad)

SUSHI FAVES: Rainbow Roll, Caterpillar, Volcano, Fire Cracker, and Over the Rainbow.

Kyle was such an amazing company the first time I came, and our waitresses (both times I came) were marvelous. The first time, Kyle took us to a different sushi journey and whipped up a concoction of his own. I wish I could remember what he named it, but you can request for his signature dish. Kyle also gave us some of his famous ""secret lychee ice cream"" which unfortunately no longer a secret (sorry Kyle!). I asked for some the second time and it was nice of the waitress to check.

Plus, they have an affordable lunch special menu that include a miso soup and chef salad with all the dishes. I always order the Sashimi Special Combo for 15.95.

The place is not too big and they have outdoor seating but I enjoy my sushi at the bar.  The chefs are personable.  Well, one more than the other but the quality is beyond good of that other AYCE sushi places.  They have specialty items as well and most people don't know the difference but I can taste it.  Big eye tuna for example, hello!  Please continue to serve people the all you can eat grade sushi while I indulge on this delicacy.  

To me, it's also apparently clear they do not use short cuts when it comes to the fishes they use to serve their guests.  One of the main reasons why their Saba, mackerel, is good is because they take the time to cut and marinate it before serving it.  Unlike Kaze Sushi who buys it in blocks and ready to serve, bleh.  Then again, not too many can taste the difference.  But if a sushi place has belly's of salmon, yellow tail, or bones of mackerel, then you know they take the care to prep their own goods.  Bravo.

Depending on the volume of customers in the restaurant I try to plan my visit while it's at their lowest capacity.  I would like to thank the Queen of Blue Fin Sushi Lisa R. for introducing me to this place and continually posting pictures up because this is one place I am not shy about using my phone and showing the sushi chefs pictures of what I want.

Just keeping up with the Jones'. Just another sign that Blue Fin is the way to go.

I had a couple of items for my AYCE venture;
-Nigiri: Yellowtail, Salmon, and the Garlic Spicy Tuna
-Rolls:  Tried their Rock and Roll, which is a cucumber wrapped roll with crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail
-Hand Rolls: Spicy Crab and the Crunch Shrimp

Everything I've tried was delicious and fresh. I thought that the Nigiri's were small, but it's all you can eat. Order more if it's not enough.  I did just that, I ordered and ordered until I was able to erase my last poor experience in San Diego.  To be honest, the food was so satisfying here that just my first nigiri already made up for it.

This review cannot end without commenting on the service. 5 stars for service alone. Even though I was just one of about forty that was eating here, they made me feel like a rockstar (no, not the energy drink).  Watch these guys in action. Rolls, bowls, and shashimi's ordered and delivered with the quickness. All it takes is some eye contact and they're ready to take your request.

My only gripe about this place...it's on the opposite side of town from where I am normally at. Guess that's not their fault. 

On a side note...thanks to all the fellow Yelpers that either gave suggestions for next time or wished me a good lunch due to my experience over the weekend. You guys rock!!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,14,13,4,LrWKr6Q6sBy-1r83gzsLVQ
4052753,2013-02-27,1,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"I have been to Blue Fin a few times since my initial review and sadly, each time I go, I am less impressed by both the service and the food. When I go to my other go-to spot in town for sushi I always walk out stuffed and happy, even if the service was slipping a bit (which seems to be happening more and more these days). When I walk out of Blue Fin lately, I am full but wishing I had gone somewhere else...

My favorite thing to order at a sushi spot is hotate nigiri (scallops) however Blue Fin does not offer up hotate, only ""yum yum scallops"" which is scallops chopped up and mixed with mayo. Gross. No thank you. 

Blue Fin does not offer up half rolls. For me it is sometimes difficult to enjoy a place that has AYCE but does not offer up half rolls as an option... Some of my favorite dining companions either do not eat sushi at all, or do not eat enough to warrant paying for AYCE, and I have found that I personally can not get my money worth if I try to go the AYCE route at Blue Fin. 

Part of that is due to how oversized some of the menu items are. As others have mentions, many of the rolls are so large they have to be eaten in multiple bites. I was taught sushi should be eaten in one bite. Some of the appetizers are oversized as well, the cucumber salad I had on my last visit was ridiculously large. Sometimes, bigger is NOT better. 

Some of my favorite Vegas Yelpers love Blue Fin, people that have recommended other places I love. Perhaps I need to go to Blue Fin with them, to see if they are ordering things I am not and perhaps that is my problem? Until then, I am going to hold off on Blue Fin for a bit as there are numerous other places in town where I can get my need for sushi met.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,1,3,NCAV-Smc7qHESHgSA4C8ZQ
4068551,2011-07-13,1,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"Love this place. I don't usually eat sushi because I can not handle texture of raw anything. And FISH? When my friend invited me i was not so sure about it. But I am so glad i went. I had a buffet dinner for 25.50$ I think its pretty reasonable. I started with green ice tea. I am a tea drinker. I know when the tea is good.  They have so many dishes of cooked food for people like me. I started the meal with a seaweed salad. i like it a lot. Miso soup is too thick for my taste though. They use different type of miso paste. The Salmon killer is amazing. I can't smell or taste anything like raw fish at all. The fish is cured and so fresh. Hand roll are so awesome as well. I tried spicy crab and the crunch which is shrimp tempura. I had greentea icecream for dessert.
I definitely will go back and recommend this restaurant to anyone.

The lunch was quite satisfying overall. One thing that I didn't quite remember from last time was that the appetizer portions are all pretty large. They're definitely shareable if you come in a pair or more. I enjoyed the ""pizza mussels"" again, and the tuna crab cakes were a worthy substitute for the dinner-only soft shell crab. The salmon skin salad was nice and crunchy as well.

Moving away from appetizers, the salmon, super white, and cajun albacore nigiri were all really good. I could order those over and over all day. The unagi nigiri was also good as expected. The salmon lover roll and the Mexican roll (not the royal Mexican, didn't try that one) both won me over at first bite, and the white tiger was pretty good if you like the garlic kick. I liked the Blue Fin lasagna roll too. Heck, a lot of the other menu rolls sounded really good, and I really wanna go back and try those.

The only issue is that there was quite a bit of wasabi sandwiched between the fish and the rice on some of the nigiri. Finding these wasabi bombs is not all that pleasant if you're not a wasabi person or if you've already put a decent amount of wasabi in your soy sauce. Obviously I'll have to skip the wasabi next time, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it as much as I want to then.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,1,4,LMzk_Sd_g4hrYIixBViEBw

The redeeming factor of the night was that the sushi chef made us a special roll with bean curd skin and various fish. That was tasty. The nigri (salmon, garlic tuna, albacore and yellowtail) was pretty good and I was pretty impressed that sweet shrimp was on the menu which we did order.

4271368,2017-03-20,5,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"OKAY I know I'm from Japan so I have high expectations for sushi, BUT that also means I've eaten at every other sushi restaurant in Vegas so I know what's ""good"" for Vegas and also what's bad. Well, I thought I knew what was considered bad, but I really didn't until I tried Blue Fin. I've had better sushi rolls from the grocery store deli. And the nigiri? I won't even talk about that because it was on another level of bad. 
Baked green mussels: I've never seen mussels served this way. Mussels are the umbrella term for a groups of molluscs that have a common shell. A common SHELL. The mussels here weren't in their shells!!!!!! They were served in an egg carton like plate with the meat de-shelled and placed in each cup with 5x the amount of sauce melted on top of the teeny tiny piece of meat. I felt like I was eating spoonfuls of sriracha and mayo with a topping of mussel. 
Rolls: As a 5 person party we ordered a lot of rolls. The rice was dry in every roll and the seaweed had that wet but tough consistency where you had to eat each piece of the roll whole or else you wouldn't be able to tear through it with your teeth. Oh, and the raw fish was like that too. Rubbery and difficult to tear with your teeth. Yuck. I tried to stick to cooked rolls after that, but it wasn't much better. 
All sushi restaurants have that ""if you leave sushi on your plate we'll charge you,"" clause on their menus, but that has never been an issue for me until Blue Fin. There were a couple of pieces of nigiri that were so bad no one in our 5 person group could finish it. We had 4 pieces left on our table and the waiter instructed us that they would not clear our plates until we finished it and if we didn't they would charge us. I understand that AYCE sushi restaurants need to have rules like this, but the nigiri was so bad there was no way any of us could finish it. Sorry we wasted those 4 pieces of very low quality fish you purchased. 
There was no one Japanese working in the restaurant....... But I think that goes without saying. ;) I wanted to tell everyone eating at the restaurant that what they were eating was NOT sushi. Please don't come here and think this is what we eat in Japan! It hurts me to think that people think this is Japanese food :(",8XKSiMpMxgdwI3qjuqmXFg,13,3,2,7OusP_MGItdRRwA1l7EjQw

The tuna was fatty and the rolls way to big to fit into a bite. They don't offer half portions and come with the standard AYCE warning about being charged menu price for unfinished sushi. However, we left sushi on the table but were not charged. Staff was very friendly and accommodating so I feel bad going off on the sushi but can't give an honest review without mentioning that I was disappointed. Garlic tuna had wasabi on it which I do not care for. Most places usually stick to just garlic & sauce and let customers put wasabi on it themselves.
I would recommend smaller bite sized rolls and half portions so you don't commit to something you don't like. The Screaming Orgasm's special sauce was underwhelming and lacked that tangy punch I was hoping for.

I always ignored this place for one reason of another, probably because it was on Sunset and I would rather stick to solid sushi. Nothing is worse than chucking $25+ on subpar sushi.

I love the ambiance and the side of the building is quite tidy, but still spacious. I love the service and have never had a bad experience. Even though I'm quite the sushi snob I still have a horrible time remembering most names of rolls.

But any place that has a solid roll that has Garlic Ponzu (see Kan Pai Sushi) gets major points. I always try the shrimp, albacore and unagi. Solid, Solid, Solid. It's only until recently I remembered I can order pot stickers AYCE as well, definately try it.

All of the Blue Fin Specials (tempura or standard) are rock solid. I don't get the 2 or 1 star reviews, it's solid overall and I'm quite picky in regards to sushi.

You only get 1 hour to order sushi for AYCE but that's more than enough thanks to the fast service. This is a good alternative or complement with Yama Sushi. The menu is a bit smaller but I feel they have a wider variety of tastes compared to Yama.

With the rolls is really up to you on what tickles your fancy but everything here is fantastic in not a huge fan of the yum yum sauce so I substitute for eel but regardless I just cannot say enough good things about this little spot absolutely great the only reason I just can't give it five stars is because their drink options are fairly limited but even so if you are looking for a great date lunch or dinner spot this is going to be a great pick I promise you.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,1,1,4,eKMQ8a-vHTRGqZqWkDCUvw

I just left now and it sucked balls. Hard. Sat a a table in the main room. Skimped on every possible item from avocado to tuna. Slathered crappy sauce on everything.  The screaming O sauce was just watery mayo no flavor. 

The final straw was that this place had THE most piss poor service I've had in any type of restaurant I can recall.  From the cocky water boy/food runner who could neither bring water or bring out the right rolls. Bro, there are a lot of people that would be happy for a job right now. Lose the attitude. Moving on to our waitress who at one point I thought would need to be carried to our table to take our order. 

Didn't get a few items we ordered.  Including soup to just stay warm in that meat locker like temperature they kept the restaurant at.

This is hands down the best sushi place in Vegas.  I grew up eating Gulf Coast sushi in Houston and always thought that was the freshest, the best...but seriously, Chef Jin gets fresh fish daily, and gets his hands on anything exotic.

Last night he treated me to madai, Japanese snapper, a fresh fish he sliced off the filet during dinner.  He is always creating new things.  I just go and never order - he makes whatever (knows what I like and what I don't), and he and his wife (the outstanding waitress and hostess Yura) are so kind.  I get matcha iced tea without asking.  I have a favorite seat.  They put on sports on the flatscreen when I come in.

Honestly, I worried when he added all-you-can-eat because the quality is too good.  You can get any roll, any appetizer (including hamachi kama), any salad, any nigiri, handrolls, ikura, uni, sweet shrimp, tempura, mochi, you name it - for $25.95.  I only do all you can eat on a rare occasion because I usually just eat nigiri and maybe a handroll or interesting creation.  Rolls are too filling for me.

In summary, the food is great, the service outstanding, the atmosphere quaint and casual, the prices reasonable, the green iced tea yummy, hot sake ready, and for the special occasion, I get the chocolate souffle for dessert.

Well Blue Fin's got some sort of deal worked out and they are getting great fish and shellfish. My friends and I opted for the all you can eat option which really put a lot of things on the table in terms of ""i wouldn't get this normally but what the heck"". For their all you can eat you can get uni (sea urchin) and hamachi kama(yellowtail collar) which aren't super common in a lot of places and were both pretty good. I've had better hamachi kama but that's not to say theirs was bad, just average.

Give their mexican roll a try. It's sort of like a philadelphia roll in a tortilla and the fried. I know it sounds crazy but it was actually good. and this is coming from someone that doesn't normally like cream cheese all up in my sushi.

Finally my last recommendation would be that if you get all you can eat, ask the chef's to make you a hand roll with whatever they feel like is good. Those are some smart guys that a few dishes into your meal will probably have a sense of your palette and will be able to put something special together for you.

anyways, the service was great, folks were nice, yadda yadda yadda if they had one in washington dc where i now live you'd probably see me there once a month",Eypq5gLLjCapBVVnMw_MyA,1,0,5,ja3bH8kd4JJ1it9i8bEKoA

It's nice and pretty but when I asked the server if chef Tony is here, she gave me a weird look and told me she don't know anyone named tony. Now I'm scared if the good will taste the same. On the first round I ordered my fav appetizers and rolls to see if there's any difference. I'm always excited to eat baked mussels here, they have a distinct sauce that is not like other places; but I got disappointed big time... It tasted bland and not all in any hint close to their previous taste. 
I'm trying to keep an open mind and not think that it's a different chef. The coco roll was still good, I'm guessing they still have good quality fresh ingredients. Other 5 rolls I ordered are also not bad, but I notice more rice now and too much sauce. The baked scallops were too tiny and covered with so much breading you can barely see the scallop inside. 
I don't know what happened here but if they read this review I'm hoping they will contact the old owner and get in touch with chef tony. This place is now just like any other AYCE sushi places I've been to... And honestly I'd rather go somewhere else ... 
The server aside from giving me a weird look and didn't want to take my order until my other orders arrive; I'd say I will give her 2stars.

Although my girlfriend thought the restaurant had a bit of a fishy smell, I have to say we all thought the food was fresh and quite good. They have an ""all you can eat"" sushi for 24.99 which is a great deal if you want several sushi items . However, sitting at the counter, I was never asked if I wanted to do this offer or not. It was not until the bill came that I saw the ""all you can eat"" price on it. I was not doing the ""all you can eat"" and had just ordered one item and salad, which came to a total of 15.00. 

I definitely recommend that you tell whoever takes your order, (whether it be a waitress or the sushi chef behind the counter), if you do or do not want the ""all you can eat"" offer.  Apparently, if you do not say anything, you will be charged for it. 

Competition is tough, with many followers liking I LOVE SUSHI, SPICY TUNA, OR MOMOSUSHI.

That may sound anti social, but really, the sushi here is good enough that I'll dine all by myself and not have to worry about sharing.  Not that you have to worry about sharing, it is AYCE after all...but most of the time, doing AYCE is a group affair.

The fish here has been consistently fresh during my visits.  There are always different specials on the chalkboard to try out.  The rolls here are creative enough that I don't mind ordering one or two (I've very much become a nigiri and hand roll kind of guy).  You can also do half orders of rolls to make sure you get as much variety as possible during your meal.

So perhaps the last paragraph can apply to numerous spots in town...but the one thing that I think does it for me at Blue Fin is the sushi rice.  It is delicious, and I do not mind ordering nigiri in lieu of sashimi.  I like the rice that much.  It may be a little thing, but it makes my tastebuds happy.

Location Overview:
First impression is everything. Walking into this location I was a tad bit worried about how small this building was. It is actually quite a small place for sushi. There are only about 6-8 tables inside. And about another 6-8 tables outside in a little patio section. The place is clean and in this situation size is not everything.

Customer Service:
Customer service here was on point. The guy serving us came out to our table just about every 5mins to make sure we had enough drinks and had a new roll ready for the all you can eat. Walking in we were greeted by all staff as well as leaving. Never had to wait long for our waiter to get something. 

Food Quality/Quantity:
The quality of the food is a lot better than what I was expecting. (After being worried about a small business in such a small building) I was more than impressed with the size of the menu. I of course did the all you can eat which is about the same price as every other sushi restaurant. The quality of the sushi was great. With the awesome designs on the food it made it fun to eat. The taste of each roll definitely fit the names of the sushi rolls. The quantity was more than enough for each roll. I noticed that they actually cut a couple more sushi pieces into the roll (not sure if it is the same size or not). The food came out at a decent time. never waiting longer than 15mins for anything to get to us.

Second this place doesn't know how to do AYCE sushi right.  they have huge portions for salads and appetizers making me think they don't want you to be able to finish so they can charge you extra or they don't want you to eat much. Not allowing you to get your money's worth. This is made more apparent by the amount of rice used in their rolls which for me is borderline hard to eat.  If the owners or management reads this I urge you to do smaller portions. It's all you can eat people get a grip. As a chef I can only assume you have massive food waste. Smaller apps smaller rolls even not only will you be happier but your customer will too trying more rolls and thinking they ate more.

Interestingly enough the AYCE menu applies to rolls, appetizers, salads, & desserts and comes equipped w/ its on separate menu. Believe it or not it also includes ayce chicken teriyaki. That's different - iv e not seen that before. It was delcious. 
the blue fin roll was my favorite. The ahi poke salad was really good. as was the red dragon. this was the first time I'd ever gone w/ the AYCE sushi option. I always just order one or 2 rolls and then get charged the AYCE price b/c of who I was sitting with. I hate that. So.. i decided to let myself be included and try the funky rolls since I get charged for it anyway. 
This place had pretty fresh tasting ingredients and as a note it had a 60 minute rule. i also ordered the volcano - but I wouldnt order it again. to be honest my bf ordered that for me - it wasnt my fav.

4974360,2010-04-23,8,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"Another review goes out to Lisa L.! 

We are always on the lookout for great AYCE sushi - and we're bigger fans of the fish itself and not the rolls.  Blue Fin Sushi definitely impressed up with the quality of their fish.

First off, Blue Fin is a small restaurant - more like a mom and pop's place.  It's almost better to keep this place on the down low because I would hate to have to wait for a seat here.

Our party of three plus toddler went for the AYCE dinner option at $25.95/pp.  

First off - uni, limit one order per person and dinner only.  Because of the weather in California, they did not get their shipment.  Oh.  Would they be willing to give us an extra order of amaebi then?  Yes.  Sweet!  And when it arrived, it looked just fabulous and tasted good too!

We went to work ordering a bunch of nigiri and was pleasantly surprised with how they came out.  More often than not, AYCE sushi places just shove as many pieces on a plate as they can.  But they actually presented it quite nicely for us, which we appreciated.  We were especially impressed with their super white tuna, which I am certain was escolar.  (Super white tuna usually means albacore, so escolar is definitely a highlight!)  

Their version of ikura was a bit different - it actually seemed like they made it themselves since the eggs didn't separate and were still within the sac, if that makes any sense.

Another highlight was their spicy rolls - I'm not a fan of the Sriracha-based kind and this was mayo-based.  Yum!

We also really enjoyed their Soft Shell Crab Tempura (limit one order per person, dinner only).  It had a nice batter and was definitely tasty!

The Husband ordered the Grilled Yellowtail Collar (limit one order per person, dinner only), but hoped they had forgotten since he was getting full.  When it did arrive, it was a huge piece!  It looked like the equivalent of two collars usually served at other restaurants!

Another highlight - unlimited dessert! Green tea and red bean ice cream, mochi ice cream, and tempura ice cream are available.  The tempura ice cream is a huge scoop and we were surprised with how generous it was.

Service did take a bit long, and we were there for a good while, more than the hour time limit.  But there was only the only waitress and the restaurant definitely was filled to the max while we were there.  In this case, we didn't mind - but if it was just the two of us, we might have gotten a bit anxious.

Overall, Blue Fin Sushi is a place I would recommend for good quality sushi.  I can't comment on their fancy rolls, but we liked what we ate and would definitely go back!

There are outdoor tables, but I'm not sure it they open them up when the weather gets better or not.

Lunch (11:00 am to 3:00 pm) $21.95/pp
Dinner (3:00 pm to 11:00 pm) $25.95/pp
60 minute limit

Update! (05.12.10)

Went back for a return visit and we were both pleased with our experience there.

Only a handful of customers sitting at the sushi bar, and that's where we chose to sit as well.  Ordered a bunch of nigiri and they had uni this time as well.  The soft shell crab was served up on a nice bed of salad greens with a sauce on it this time, which wasn't a problem since we asked for no sauce the next time.  Overall, we took our time and was out within an hour.  They didn't disappoint on quality at all.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,18,15,4,QSHBH28IGfo9PeHeFGZFVg

I came with a friend and a baby so we sat at the tables. I know what puts this place over the edge is the specialties of the sushi chef and I always believe sitting at the table puts you at a disadvantage unless you're already a rockstar customer. Just ordered strictly on menu things- those were all pretty good. 

Out of the appetizers I really like their big panko breaded soft shell crab. I'm a sucker for those things. Also got the baked mussels which were baked pieces in a escargot  ceramic instead of the shell...a little too cheesy/mayo-y for me. 

Nigiri wise- tried a bit of everything but the mackerel, the albacore, garlic tuna were standout lovely. The rice to fish ratio is proportional so no complaints there! I tried a bit of my friends rolls since she's a roll person and even the fried, mayo=y, cream cheesy rolls here weren't bad. . I had a Italian roll since it was the oddest roll on the menu with balsamic dressing and grapes on it. It worked actually and pretty good with the panko crunchies for some texture. I think it was because everything wasn't too heavily sauced that I was able to enjoy more rolls here. 

Service from the waitress was friendly and decent. She came by often to check on the baby, haha. 

I do get why this is a AYCE favorite as it is quality. I think the huge hype though is all the specials which I didnt really experience. For that, I must be back to get off menu things my Yelperazzi seem to really enjoy.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,6,4,J4ZPesL7smOmy7wxioDCag

I must say i was a bit disappointed.  Hate to do this but i must write about my experience.

So a friend and I decided to give this a try for lunch since everyone has been talking about this place. Not to brag or anything but my friend and I know what good sushi tastes like cause duh we are Asian, we have it down to the texture to the temperature and to the flavor.

I'm not sure if the food was just horrible just because it was lunch? But we were in shock how horrible the food was.

From what I remembered we ordered the baked mussels. We were like ok this is cool it's on little plates rather than on the shell. As we were chewing the mussels we were about to vomit. NO joke or exaggeration. For starters the mussels were not hot enough. It was not baked long enough so we were chewing cold mussels.

We decided to ignore that and try the other dishes.

We ordered the Ahi poke salad, that i must admit was really good, it was spicy and different than all the ahi poke salads we tasted. My friend enjoyed it as well.

Then we ordered the Shumai, Ehhh it was ok nothing too good.. Shumai is shumai they all taste the same in all the sushi places..

I decided to order the crab cakes since i have not seen crab cakes on the menu in a sushi place. I was disappointed. The crab cakes were cold and they tasted old, like they were sitting in the back for awhile.. no joke.

Decided to ignore that as well and we came to the ultimate test. The Nigiri and the Sushi.

So from what i remember we ordered the salmon nigiri. It was just ok. The temperature was not right it was too cold, and the rice was weird like it was old. I have to give them props at least the texture was good their was no veins at all in their Nigiri.  Same went for the tuna nigiri and all the other nigiri we had.

The sushi rolls were ok, kinda sucks they didnt do half rolls, I usually order half rolls to make sure i like the sushi.

Also during lunch time they didn't have Uni ( sea urchin) lunch is 22$ and dinner is 26$ something like that.. a difference of 4$ what does a difference of 4$ do, just add the sea urchin and all the other stuff not included in lunch, that's on the dinner menu.

Overall wasn't to fond of this place. I wouldn't mind giving it a try during the dinner time maybe dinner is much better than lunch.

Service was great the waitress was on top of everything and the cooks greet you when you come in and thank you when you leave.

I would give this a try again since i was in total shock of the ratings for this place, maybe i just caught this place on a bad day.",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,8,6,2,fFFSnKvGlLNBwjzzQZLRaQ

Had lunch with my kids here and was not impressed at all unfortunately. We were sat at a table with no settings and had to ask for every little thing because our server didn't feel the need to do it on her own without us asking. Made us feel like a bother which I definitely don't like doing. As she brought out a few plates we had to keep asking her for chopsticks, napkins, soy sauce, ginger, & wasabi bc she kept forgetting. Smh 

The quality of the fish was ok but the Uni & Ikura tasted funny. It had a weird sweet after taste which I didn't like. The Udon was too salty too.

So midway into our meal we realized that some of our orders didn't come out so we had to actually ask her 2 3 times if it was still coming. Apparently she forgot to put it in. In the end we still never got our some of our orders and son's spider roll so said forget it. She was a horrible server. She later disappeared and was nowhere to be found. If it wasn't for the other guy that was there who was very nice and attentive to bringing out what we needed and taking over we would've made a complaint which we NEVER do. I feel bad because I can't remember his name, think maybe it was Omar or Carlos? He was the only guy there and maybe mexican.

5094740,2011-10-10,2,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"Gotta love AYCE sushi.  Sure, its not super fresh air flown fish.  Dare I say its seen the inside of a freezer but it makes up for it by offering a lot of creativity and big taste for a bargain.  At around $25, Blue Fin is an exceptional value.

Multiple visits.  Sometimes ordering just a single roll, other times for the AYCE to really put this place to the test.  Since everyone has their favorites, Ill simply make generalizations:

- Shrimp tempura rolls - The shrimp is what you would expect.  A little oily, overcooked, chewy shrimp that works really well in a roll.

- Unagi - Decent quality, perfectly broiled with a very tasty sauce.  Usually served on the outside of a roll so its sauce adds to the entire sushi.

- Soft shell crab - Previously frozen but deep fried to a oily but crispy goodness.  Just like the shrimp, a little oil in the sushi is a good thing.

- Spicy mayo (for scallop or tuna) - Spicy for sure and really good

All of the rolls are beautifully made and look incredible on the plate.  Best of all, they taste great!

Sushi aficionados, feel free to pay five times the price to enjoy the best on the Strip.  Just remember, good eats come at all prices.

Baked Green Mussel with parmigiano in an Escargot style serving dish! Pretty good! Dare I say too cheesy??  It was a little difficult to eat, as the cheese melted together on top in a solid form, and I had to rip parts of cheese to eat with the mussels as they sat naked underneath, vs it being a melted goo of goodness.

I went last night with some friends, and had a good experience.  Not spectacular, but pretty good.

The restaurant itself, is beautiful.  They've expanded since the last time I was in, and they now have a very large, spacious dining room, that is separate from the sushi bar area.  There are still tables near the bar, which is where we sat. 

We had a couple of servers taking care of us, and they were all polite, and very helpful.  

The prices for drinks are pretty good.  I had an iced green tea for $2.50 with free refills, and a small bottle of hot sake for $3.95.  My roommate had a LARGE bottle of beer for $6.95.  Not bad at all.  I could have had a large hot sake for only $2 more, but...I was trying to behave myself. ;)

Now...the fish!
My favorite specialty roll here, is the Royal Unagi (made without avocado).  Its a baked roll with eel, cream cheese, a bit of tempura, and eel sauce on top.  It was just as delicious as I remembered, only...SO rich!!I really really wish that they would do a half roll, but on the baked/deep fried rolls, they don't do halves.

The Spicy Garlic Tuna...for a girl who is NOT a fan of spicy, this was too much for me to have more than a piece of.  So why did I go back for thirds?  SO delicious...the flavor was incredible.  So incredible, that I didn't care how badly my mouth was on fire.  
The Unagi:  Perfect EVERY time.
The Ebi:  Really good...perfect texture.

From the appetizer menu, I LOVED the gyoza.  these were delicious!!  I'm a big gyoza fan, and really enjoyed these.

Everything else we tried  was good, but didn't blow me away. Super White, which is my absolute favorite was GREAT the first round, but the second round was ""meh.""
Also, the rice fell apart quite a lot at the beginning of the meal.

I will say this, though, the service was great.  We sent two dishes back, and the only questions asked were simply quality control. 
One we sent back because it had a ton of creamy ""yum yum"" sauce, which is not mentioned on the menu...if it was, we wouldn't have ordered it (my friend has a texture thing with creamy sauces...and I didn't care for the texture.)  
The other we sent back, because my friend is pregnant, and the baby said ""NOPE!"" (Don't worry, her doctor said it was fine as long as the fish is cooked, and we triple checked everything with the servers.)

All in all, pretty good experience.  I've had better at Sushi Mon, but I would definitely come back here again.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,2,3,4,dTUfEpHJbB1t2ewC0V_J3w

The standout were the chef's special creations off the menu! He's very creative and great at putting flavors together. The one called ""Sianara Happy hour"" (or something like that) was AMAZING.

The yellowtail nigiri was fresh and tasty, but avoid the yellowtail in the Arizona rolls. The ahi poke was cool - a nice seaweed + poke mixture. Delish! Most of the rolls we tried were great - I'd probably recommend ordering with light sauce, many were too sweet and saucy for my taste.

I have been going to blue fin for the better of 3 years now and each visit has been nothing short of a pleasant time.  I have never had trouble with their service and their sushi men and staff have always been extremely welcoming and friendly.  I have been to many sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and California and have still to find a place that I enjoy more than blue fin. Their rolls have combinations of sauces that make the rolls new and refreshing everything time, such as the Johnny Johnny.  Their salads are the best I've had and I that is coming from someone who never orders salad.  Their nigiri and fish they use have always been high quality and fresh. Some of the bigger names such as goymeon,janga, sushimon  lack this freshness and this high quality of fish and is one of the main reasons I continue to come back to blue fin. Being someone who has continuously been visiting bluefin I can confidently say I have yet to find a better ayce who provides overall freshness and a huge variety of rolls and appetizers that help top off the fish.

My husband and I were looking for a lunch spot near the Galaxy Green Valley theater and Yelp led us here.  

For an AYCE sushi place, Blue Fin definitely is above par.  I'm pretty sure if you googled ""cozy"" there'd be a link to this place.  It's quite quaint. There is a great selection and variety of  nigiri and clever sushi rolls. My husband does not like fish but loves veggie rolls. He was thrilled to see a baked veggie roll on the menu (he's never had one before). He loved it. 
I had salmon and hamachi sushi (my faves) and I also had the rock & roll and the blue fin special roll. All were delicious and all fresh.

The sushi chefs were extremely accommodating and courteous, and the wait staff were attentive. Service all around was great. The chefs also made a special off the menu veggie roll for my husband that he absolutely loved.

The big plus here, that sets it apart from standard AYCE places, is definitely the freshness and the variety.  I am absolutely coming back and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great AYCE spot.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,3,2,4,FT7OV6GLjFNnWjqnHYJRMw

For the most part, the wait staff is pleasant.  However, almost every time we eat at Blue Fin, we have to wait a considerable amount of time for drinks if we are at the bar or service at all when sitting at a table.  

We are sitting here now, and we were finally asked for our next order after waiting ten minutes after our dish from the previous roll was cleared from our table.  Waiting a few minutes between orders is fine, but one of the servers was talking with some other customers during a long part of the wait FACING US AND MAKING EYE CONTACT.

Dining with Lisa L. was a great experience because I gave full ordering rights over to her. My only duty was to enjoy the opulent flavor combinations as they danced across my palate. The tako nigiri with a drizzle of sesame oil and a slice of lemon was fragrant and exquisite. The ika with some kind of leaf (was it sesame?) was another ambrosial blend of flavor. Finding a sushi lover that avoids rolls, cream cheese, mayo, while creating unique blends in nigiri was everything I could ask for. The only thing I disliked was my own fault. I have never liked mackerel, but was stubbornly wanting to give it another try at a different restaurant. Yep, over twenty different places and still not a fan. Tried it cooked, raw, Japanese style, Korean style, in several different countries. Safe to say it will not be part of my diet. Yellow tail belly, on the other hand, is perfection. Kevin P., be prepared, it might get heated if it comes to a battle for this fatty cut. 

To eat with someone who enjoys the slow dining experience has greatly deepen my love for each individual fish. No more placing eight orders in at once and swallowing it down. A relaxed pace is needed to allow for moments of appreciation. The two and a half hours went by in a blink of an eye.

Upon walking in we were greeted and sat at our table. The first thing I noticed was that the menus were updated. 

We ordered our appetizers, soft shelled crab and screaming O. Both were meh, I think the screaming O has too much sauce. If they go a little lighter on it, it would be delicious. 

Next we ordered the baked bay scallops but when those came it they were drenched in bacon and cheese. We sent it back because we thought it was incorrect but it wasn't? Which was confusing cause there were bacon scallops on the appetizer list as well. 

We moved onto the Nigiri Sushi and that was SO GOOD! We ordered the garlic tuna, spicy garlic tuna, and super white tuna. Do yourself a favor and try all of those, the super white tuna is the best! Like melt in your mouth best!! 

I then ordered my go to sushi, Uni. It was awful, I had high hopes for it. I ate one piece and sent the rest back. They looked slimy and dark and they had a smell to them when they got to the table. I typically judge a sushi establishment by their uni, they failed. It was not fresh at all. 

After the Uni, I was over it, I ordered a miso soup and then mochi. 

The service is good, they are attentive and our server was very pleasant. The restaurant is clean and not very noisy. The update to the menu was cool and the nigiri was delicious. Taking away two stars for the Uni, that should be something that is FRESH FRESH FRESH!

The fish and rice were delicious and service at the sushi bar was just fine even though the chef was busy during the middle of the lunch hour.

There were only 4 seats left at the sushi bar when I arrived at noon and the dining room was about 75% full which means the place is full at peak times and I will plan accordingly for the next visit.

Although he did forget to make an order of unagi for my last order, but that was OK because I was starting to get full. The servers also did a good job of removing plates but I had to spend a couple of minutes to track one down for my check.

The nigiri and hand rolls I had were my standard and Blue Fin passed the initial test. Mackerel usually isn't a regular order for me but I ordered it here and it was actually the best cut of fish I had. It's usually a little to oily and funky smelling, but this mackerel had none of that going on.

Flash on over to the food. Boyfriend got the Happy Ending roll, which was okay. Lots of flavor going on to the point of overwhelming the palate in just a bite, and then your mouth is covered in cream cheese. I wasn't a fan. He didn't finish it. 

I ordered the rainbow roll, and again, it was alright. Nothing to shout about. I also made the mistake of ordering the spicy yellowtail roll...it was chewy. Emphasis on ew.

So, we didn't have the bar experience, which I have grown accustomed to.  But, the service was quick and friendly.  I like the menu a lot, and was able to get out of my comfort zone a bit.  I am still a sushi rookie, but I kind of know what I am looking for in a good roll.

The first thing we ordered was the poke.  I had a couple of pieces but, it's not my thing.  Everyone else at the table loved it.  Anyhow, we started to order rolls after rolls.  Now, I don't know the names, but know that they were good.  Screaming O's, spicy tuna, and a roll that I will probably crave for a while now, that had guacamole.

We also had an interesting experience, and no fault at all to Blue Fin, a customer must have had a little too much Sake and was puking her guts up in the bathroom.  But, as soon as she was finished the staff went in quickly to clean up and sanitize everything.

My mother was in the mood for sushi and I talked her into going here instead of Oyishi.  While I don't get to do sushi often due to my husband not wanting anything to do with food that is remotely fishy, I wanted to try Blue Fin because I knew the chances of me going out of the way to go here from another part of town was pretty remote.

I prefer hand rolls and sashimi/nigiri mostly so I went in that direction, as many of their regular rolls did not seem that appealing to me, and found the fish to be fairly fresh and tasty.  However, compared to my previous AYCE excursion at Oyishi, I found that Blue Fin goes heavier on the rice, which I was not fond of.  There was also some issues with ordering, and a few times when we ordered one item, we received another item.

I do want to also give them props on their salads and their teriyaki chicken.  The seaweed salad was one of the freshest salads I have had in the area, and the chicken was the best I have had so far from the AYCE joints.  I was not happy with the teriyaki beef and how heavily breaded the soft shell crab was, and found many of their hot items just okay.

I wouldn't go out of my way for sushi in general here, as my favorite is still Spicy Tuna, but for AYCE, but I found it to be pretty good with some hits and misses.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,1,2,4,sJpJ7iIM8Vo3EDA-PyDcZA

They were good but the CYY was drowned in a spicy sauce and you couldn't get the fish flavors while the Dragon was bland.  The softshell crab was good and there is plenty of choices on the menu, even sweet shrimp which is often extra on an AYCE menu is included!

The place was packed for a uye so the questionable service we received (it took 45 minutes to get our food while people who ordered after us received theirs in minutes) and harried staff can be partly excused.

I will go back on a less crowded time and hopefully have a better experience.

5792551,2011-06-14,2,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"Damn.  I traveled over 20 minutes to get to this side of town and was damn excited to try a new sushi joint offering AYCE.  Every aspect of my wanting to come here were supported by the fact that 1.) I was starving and working up quite an appetite, 2.) was encouraged by all the yelp reviews and outstanding 4.5 star rating, and 3.) the pictures were freaking enticing; it definitely played a role in my excitement and subtle impatience for dining here.

Now, I haven't yelped in a while but felt the need to write about my experience because I was horribly disappointed.  You can't imagine my despair upon leaving that restaurant.  As I mentioned before, I was really saving my appetite for their AYCE so I made sure not to eat anything  beforehand.  My group ordered some of their appetizers but focused mainly on nigiri.  We weren't shy about what we wanted and ordered everything almost instantly after being sat.

Let the disappointment begin.... Our first dish was their seaweed salad.  I was taken back a bit because the color of the seaweed almost blinded me with its bright ass neon green.  It looked really artificial and not appetizing.  Moreover, it was overwhelmingly spicy and this coming from a person who's all about spice.  Now, onto more important things, the nigiri was ""....."", i'm speechless.  Imagine a thin slice of fish served on top of a fat ass pile of overcooked, terribly seasoned, almost inedible rice.  I was beating myself up for ordering that much nigiri, knowing that I couldn't even eat the rice accompanied with it.  I almost died and by the end of the meal we were literally forcing each piece down our throat.  I just threw up a little thinking about it.  YUCK!!  This was by far my worst AYCE experience, ever!  To top it off, the pictures that were posted by fellow yelpers were no where to be found on the menu.  I was so bummed out about that....

Let's sum things up: service was friendly and attentive, although there were only two other tables dining as well.  The fish was of okay quality, it was good but not good enough for me to go out of my way and certainly not good enough to go through the hell of forcing myself to chow down the rice it comes with!!!!  I can't stress this enough and I cant imagine how other yelpers don't find this bothersome or even acceptable for sushi, but the amount of rice they pile on each piece of nigiri is freaking ridonkulous!!  I'm sure it's maybe their strategic way of stuffening you up quick, but damn they're not shy about it and are definitely not subtle!  This place is a no go!  I'm more pissed off about the gas I used to take me there... there goes $10 i'll never see again. blah.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,3,0,1,JXqtOYTqGcvupAy168U90g

5837402,2011-12-20,7,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"***December 1, 2011 UYE ***

Well, here goes a review on fine sushi from a novice sushi reviewer!  It is based on the impromptu UYE that followed the kickoff of ""Shop Local!"" at Sunshine Coffee where a number of hungry Yelpers decided to go for AYCE sushi after the kickoff ended.  I didn't know what to expect but I had heard that the sushi here was one of the best in the city.  It did not disappoint!

I love Miso Soup, so even though it is filling, I ordered a bowl and was pleased to hear that it, too, is considered part of AYCE here.  In fact, unlike some of my savvy tablemates, I did not realize until I read Holly C.'s review after the event that unlimited desserts were included, as well.  But, my stomach hardly had room anyway after I finished my refreshing Mango Mochi at meal's end.  

I didn't count them, but our table likely consumed close to 20 rolls before we split, plus a few other odds and ends like Raw Tuna Poki Salad and Calamari Tempura.  I positioned myself next to Tony T., so I had someone to translate the offerings and describe the ingredients of each foreign batch that arrived.  The Miso Soup was good but overly salty.  Ahi Tuna was smooth, cool, and richly flavored.  The Rainbow Roll was excellent, as was the Tokyo Express that contained a mixture of tuna and salmon on each large cut-roll piece.  The Italian Special was good and creamy.  I even liked the Crazy Yum Yum for a time, but after awhile the very mayonnaisey (Holly's word) sauce became cloying.  Tubiko I found to just taste okay, but the red and green fish eggs were certainly pretty and helped usher in the Christmas holiday spirit on this first day of December.  As many avocado lovers know, avocado can vary in consistency, color, and taste, depending on how ripe it is.  Here every roll that included a slice of avocado offered non-stop delicious bites of  perfectly ripe and green avocado entwined with the raw fish.  Cool and tasty every time!  

I didn't love it but found the Salmon Roe to be better tasting than the Flying Fish Eggs.  Calamari Tempura was different than Calamari Fritti but good in a more subdued way.  I tried to stretch beyond sushi that was safe and mild like the California Roll (which no one ordered), and succeeded to a degree, but found that I still had my limits on what I would put in my mouth.  I regarded the Amaebi (sweet shrimp) with fried heads quite skeptically, although the shrimp part of the dish glistened and beckoned to me, so that I developed a slight interest in it.  And, after being coaxed by Tony T. and Lisa L. to try this weird-looking dish, I finally acquiesced halfway and chewed on the raw shrimp.  Surprisingly, I found it to be tasty and somewhat creamy in texture.  But, I stopped there.  I'm not yet ready for fried shrimp heads.  

My stomach also turned as I faced a dish that featured a quail egg nestled next to what looked like brown brains.  I continued to only look, and let my fellow diners enjoy whatever this sushi beast was.  When I was almost full, I realized that I had forgotten to order my favorite sushi: a Spicy Tuna Roll.  So, not to piggishly over-order and leave anything behind, I asked for and received a half-order of Spicy Tuna Roll.  It was as spicy as I recall previously experiencing from a Spicy Tuna Roll, to the point that my nostrils felt like they were smoking, and I had to modulate the spice with a bite from a much milder Caterpillar Roll before I launched in again for more bites of the super-spicy roll.  I did finish all of it eventually.

I believe everyone present had a good time.  We did converse, but almost exclusively about the wonderful sushi spread before us that kept coming and coming until we called it off.  We were all there principally to eat, and that we did!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,7,5,CKd-k1g8ZiFPbNJcE4_Pxw

5918706,2010-08-28,1,7vHvQCjPq5pWj7Rio1A--w,"Finally was able to go and give the much recommended Blue Fin Sushi on the SE side of Las Vegas a try.  I was there because of an UYE Lunch event hosted by Jessica R, plus also in attendance was Lisa L who organized the last UYE dinner event there. And it was totally worth skipping the free meal at Aria's employee dining and shelling out the $25.95 (dinner AYCE price, because I wanted to order the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama that is only available during dinner AYCE).  Not only was the food we ordered as good as I imagined it to be, Chef Jin (the chef/proprietor of Blue Fin) also made some special (off menu?) treats for us. 

The ""Shiso Special"" would make an excellent amuse-bouche at much fancier restaurants up and down the Strip. It is diced sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) flavored with fresh herbs, sesame seeds, Chef's secret sauce, covered with fried shiso leaf, garnished with masago (red, and green), ikura (salmon roe), and truffle oil. 

To start off the meal, we ordered a lot of nigiri (yellowtails, salmon, uni, amaebi, halibut, red snapper, bunch of spicy tuna and hamachi hand rolls), and Chef Jin hooked us all up with Yellowtail Belly (not part of the regular AYCE menu).  All the sushi were fresh and delicious. Our waitress did her best to try and take orders from all five of us, and some of the items we tried to order was left out, but it was no biggie. The food we were served were great and we ordered more in our second round.

Recommendation:  If you go for AYCE, even during lunch (11am-3pm), and you enjoy uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp) or hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), it is worth it to pay the few extra dollars for the dinner AYCE price and be able to order those item.

The restaurant is relatively small, so if you plan to go with a group it is best to call ahead and make a reservation.

The iced green tea looks great and is probably healthier than plain iced water.

Come hungry for AYCE :)

Rating breakdown:
Service - good
Food - excellent
Ambiance - nice, plays cool musics (some 80s) but not of Japanese artists.
Interior - clean, limited seating.
Price - about what most other AYCE Sushi restaurants charges.
Location - great for those living in the SE Las Vegas or near UNLV, but worth the drive if you live in other parts of Las Vegas.
  -  Out of Town Visitors - It is worth it to rent a car if you plan to venture off Strip to this sushi restaurant. Your cab fare back and forth would probably be more than 1 day's rental rate.

I feel this restaurant really earned a 4.5 Yelp Stars in my book.  And next time I will see if Chef Jin needs anyone to stage at his restaurant, because I would enjoy learning from him.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,8,5,_Cje79jUO42Eko0HPNqGgg

We came here today because my fella was craving some sushi. I insisted we skip our favorite AYCE sushi, Goyemon to try this place across town. From the first bite, my fella was disappointed. After every bite I got that look from him like, ""see, we should have gone to Goyemon,"" I enjoy sushi rice, but this was just so overwhelmingly vinegary. It's the only flavor we could taste. I like to taste the flavor of the fish, but all I got was overwhelming flavor of vinegar in every single bite. I was very disappointed. 

I ordered a little of everything. Plenty of nigiri, salmon skin handroll, green mussels, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, tempura calamari and a few other items that I can't remember. The seaweed salad was really sour and not my favorite version I've ever had. The salmon skin handroll was pretty good. I like the salmon quite a bit, that's usually one of my favorite things to order at every sushi place. The only thing that was annoying was how flimsy the handrollls were put together. They fell apart so quickly and made a total mess. The calamari, tofu and mussels were all pretty tasty, although I prefer my mussels in the shell. I would order all three of those again. All the nigiri was fresh and really good, but I had to dab each one to remove excess vinegar from atop it, to make it more palatable. The desserts were pretty good. My fella felt vindicated a little when he ate the tempura ice cream with green tea ice cream and then quickly ordered another to finish up the meal.

Service was pleasant and efficient. I hope this was a one off for this resataurant, since I see so many great reviews from Yelpers I respect.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,6,2,miSGP-jP-Vx0ZGNgD2mwRQ

Granted the servers seemed to be moving but not even an acknowledgement!?!  
The greeter/cashier watched us walk out without even saying a word.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,5,0,1,-Wdha8-JmuOWH3JDCWngTw

Have a saki bomb with it.  Great stuff!",76x8OINBxjS4o1k_VJiA6g,0,0,5,y9nx7EcOjUGbhbdWTYlr1w

The nigiri is exceptionally fresh and tasty. The sushi rice is well vinegared, tasty, and the rice to fish ratio is superb. I was a huge fan of the super white tuna, which was just fresh and clean in taste, and the unagi, which was this delicious sear on the outside so it had a yummy crunch to it. 

The rolls were exceptional as well. I love that they do half rolls of almost everything. Descriptions are very accurate, and again, the rice to fish ratio is excellent. The rolls aren't rice heavy and each one was tasty. 

The baked mussels were delish and came in a cute little dish that had a spot for each mussel (minor detail, but I loved the dish). And the ahi poke was on point. Also, all our servers spoke English and were able to tell us what each item was accurately, unlike some places I've been to. 

I can't wait to go back! This is definitely a place I'll recommend to friends without hesitation.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,2,5,_WhOUpz27-agLtXF57Q5wg
