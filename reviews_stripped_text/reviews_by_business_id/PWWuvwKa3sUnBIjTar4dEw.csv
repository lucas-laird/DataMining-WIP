152357,2014-03-09,0,PWWuvwKa3sUnBIjTar4dEw,"So I stopped by this Burger King to grab some food really quick, the slowest service I have ever gotten at a ""FAST FOOD"" joint. We got up to the order board within a few minutes but then spent almost 20 minute just getting up to the counter then had to wait another few minute at the window. The gal at the window still never acknowledge us or even turned around, after waiting a little longer we finally left because it was a completely waste of time!",sFhwiOdhzkjpPxg3ZYi41w,0,0,1,wcQ7RZuo101PtK35BdSabw

976018,2008-01-02,10,PWWuvwKa3sUnBIjTar4dEw,"I went into this Burger King, as I do every day for lunch, to get a quadruple Whopper meal with a King-sized fries and XXL diet Chocolate shake.  When I ordered, the person behind the counter took my hard-earned money and came back and gave me what looked like a BIG MAC!!!!!!

What the fuck???  If I wanted a nasty, processed, non flame-broiled Big Mac, I'd go to Wendy's.  I eat Burger King and ONLY Burger King.  So I politely asked the man behind the counter ""What the fucking shit is this, you faggot???  I axed for a Whopper so get your head out of your Mom's cunt and GIVE ME A MOTHERFUCKING WHOPPER NOW!!!!!""

Just as I was about to throw a molotov cocktail at the fry cook rather than order something else on the menu that is exactly the same as the Whopper, I saw none other than ""The King"" himself come from behind the counter with my delicious fat-free Quadruple Whopper on a plate made of solid gold.  I realized that I was part of a hilarious hidden camera gag and loosened my chokehold on the girl with Down's syndrome who was refilling the ketchup and moved the shard of glass away from her jugular.  I chuckled and promptly apologized to the employees and customers who I had scared with my voice-raising and tard-choking and happily took my food to the parking lot to eat in my Honda Del Sol as I do every day.  I took my first bite of the Whopper and realized - THERE ARE ONLY THREE PATTIES ON THIS THING!!!

By then it was too late to raise another fuss and I had to get back to my job at Chick-Fil-A.  I am, however, currently trying to build a super laser so that I can vaporize that Burger King for fucking up my Whopper.  I will never forget.",1QGOzd4d3auzorVEvS9LxQ,1,1,1,mKXkkdgYiSkWkImjNhYOqg

2521197,2016-05-06,0,PWWuvwKa3sUnBIjTar4dEw,"The overall order process and repetition of my order was fine. I paid and received my change with no issue. After I received my food in the drive-thru I went home with confidence in what I had received because I had never had a problem with this certain store or food chain. I paid for 2 20 piece orders of chicken nuggets and two chicken sandwiches. Even though it was less Han 20 I expected to be at least fulfilled completely. When I got home I realized i only had only received 20 chicken nuggets but had been charged for 40 and the chicken sandwiches, which were under cooked. It was really disappointing. I was never asked if I wanted sauces for my chicken nuggets and didn't receive any offer of them. It was my mistake for not saying anything at the time but it's still a rob of my money. I didn't even eat anything.",Krqu0QDgPX_hF8jt5MB_qQ,0,0,2,EdyBphtjruAGyAlN4Cd5cQ
2628912,2014-09-07,2,PWWuvwKa3sUnBIjTar4dEw,"Ordered a double whooper with cheese which is my usual when I rarely eat at Burger King. The food was good but the ambience was quite ghetto. I walked in to an old man in a wheelchair asking people for change as they came in. While I was waiting on line to order my food some 13 year old giant decided to play jungle gym on the line queue cattle guards. It was very annoying considering he was less than 2 feet away from me. The cashier was very friendly and took my order promptly, my food was ready within 5 minutes. Overall the food was good but the location as said earlier was ghetto. Undesirables shuffling in and out that weren't customers, not to mention the 300+ pound female sitting at the table directly across from me with her asscrack showing.",A8TRpa--43-mbig73xfhrA,0,0,3,rluTNVcF8m2Ssc-PpbAouA

There are no 'cards'), I do believe that one of the cooks spit on my hamburger.  I saved the burger but I am too grossed out to look at it again.  I didn't even give it to my dog it was so disgusting!  I am not only going to Yelp this, I am going to write corporate and let them know.  I know it's only BK, but I'm spending my money there just like I would at Maggianos.  Customer service should be the same everywhere; GOOD!",996axDvF9P8zxB9MJA52Xg,0,0,1,aU1HBHcHxIn-73vc8x-tQw
