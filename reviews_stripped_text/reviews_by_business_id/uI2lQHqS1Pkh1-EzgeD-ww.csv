She called me back a day later to say her manager still didn't get back to her but she went ahead and found my information then reversed the charge.  It's been almost a week now and I still did not get any money back.  If you cannot deliver orders that are less than $10, your online system needs to be set up so it doesn't allow you to place the order until you hit the minimum.

This place was 0.9 miles from the delivery location so we weren't expecting to wait so long. At around 11:30pm, I called to check the status of the delivery and the woman who picked up said the food is out for delivery and should be there soon. The place closed at midnight, but I called again a few minutes before they closed to check again and someone picked up only to hang up on me. I tried calling twice again, but they let it ring both times until it went to voicemail. So now it's been more than 2 hours since I placed the order and I just disputed this charge with Seamless directly.

Tldr; Don't bother ordering from this place and expect a timely delivery or a delivery at all. Ended up starving for the night.",Jn-JiTralsuVqmyZ7sw15A,2,1,1,qg8oplDJu9IVAn925e_cfA

Ordered through Yelp so Eat24 ... delivery rstimated 45 min to 60 mins. Okay no biggie it New Years day in Vegas. An hour comes I call to get an ETA on our order and the lady at the resturant was clueless after holding for 5 mins I was told the girl driver just left and is on her way in less then 10 mins. 40 mins later the order gets here and the pizza is cold not even luke warm cold. The ranch for the salad was for a small side salad not the nice sized dinner salad. I called the resturant to let them know of the issue but all I got was oh I am sorry, no let us get a hot pizza out to you right away nothing. Called Eat24 and they refunded me my money. Sadly I will never order from this pizza place again. I understand warm food but cold food is unacceptable.",8fRNiBpb5cR01I0FvLLHbA,0,0,1,QMmK3NHNpAKnXDVfLOQehw

Nope, driver left and I opened everything with no silverware. So ended up having to get dressed and go to first floor and scrounge for silverware. By the time I got back meal was cooler than when received. I called and the lady tried to tell me they put silverware in there. If they had why would I be calling? Totally ruined the takeout delivery experience because I still had to get up, dressed and go looking for silverware. First impressions are key in business and this was not a good first impression. Lady did not offer anything in return. Said she would send driver out once back. Food would have been cold cold had I waited for that. Fail...",43lZh9A6h436G4g237OioQ,0,1,1,CbaQ1TtbV4bCwaE3YIw8OQ
