She said it was pretty good, and I went to try it for myself, and have been going back ever since then, and that was more than 5yrs ago. It is a little hole in the wall, but it is undoubtly my favorite Mexican Resturant in Vegas, and I have tried more than half in the city. The staff is always smiling and friendly, and I love their chips and salsa, usually with a glass of iced tea, their Chicken Burrito with rice and beans & Green sauce is my absolute favorite, but they also have good chicken taco's and their chimichanga is delish! Everything on their menu is good, I have taken many family and friends there, and no one has complained yet! You have to just go by there and try it for yourself. I really like it, they have had the same cook there in the A.M. for all these years, and he sooooo kicks ass! You will probably leave there with a smile on your face and a very happy and full tummy!

351089,2011-05-14,1,1ME-zOtZ9HApzJUOpR0-vQ,"In complete contradiction to previous reviews, El Herradero is exactly the very mediocre kind of place you would expect to find hidden in a strip mall. The clear plastic tablecloths and no-budget décor accurately reflect the food quality. A stale basket of chips complete with an errant and quite ancient looking French fry arrived at the table accompanied by a slightly sweet, less than fresh salsa. The chilled ingredients dominated the Carne Asada Burrito making for a cold dish even though it was Enchilada style and heated before served. Pathetically weak Enchilada sauce tasted like something watered-down from a can. The tortillas seemed store bought as did the commercially shredded cheese. Average fast food, neighborhood-Mexican? Maybe. 5-star Mexican restaurant? Definitely not.",F4YcwhgC8bziV856IruVaA,1,1,2,VCWWfjv4GyFwcW9bmUQpQQ

We ordered the macho nachos and the carne Assad burrito. The nachos were dry and lacked flavor and I didn't like the pulled beef that came in it. The salsa they gave us with the chips I had to put on the nachos to try and add some type of flavor and moisture. The carne Assad burrito with every bite I bit gristle and eventually had to stop eating it. The rice was over cooked and mushy in the burrito as well.

The girlfriend and I were looking for a traditional Mexican restaurant that served breakfast before 11am. This came up on Yelp and we decided to go.

We both ordered the Chilaquiles with steak and, my god, was it fantastic. The spice level was perfect (not too white, but it also won't take the enamel off of your teeth), the steak was tender and grilled exactly the way it should have been. Their coffee was strong and fresh, and the chilaquiles was blended like an artist has done it. The tortilla chips in the meal weren't too soggy, but they weren't to dry either, there was plenty of cheese, the egg was exactly as we ordered it (over easy) and the grilled onion finished off the deliciousness excellently.

The service was also friendly and fast. Based on this one experience we will definitely be back for many more meals here. This might just be my favorite Mexican restaurant on this side of town.

It's a small family restaurant, the staff is very friendly & polite.  
The chips & salsa were great (all salsas made fresh in house), we ordered the Chile Verde with nopales which was hot but good, and the Carnitas which was sooo good! Both came with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, fluffy delicious rice & beans that were not overly smashed. We went back a second time because it was that good!!

The same lady helps me every time I go in, and she is a total sweetheart. The decor is basic, this isn't a place you would take a date for a special occasion, don't go into a hole-in-the-wall establishment expecting fine china or 800 thread count table linens... If you have ever been to Mexico, you know that it's the flavors of the food that make it authentic, not the décor! 

The chicken soup is fabulous. Great broth with lots of chicken, potatoes, carrots and rice. It tastes extra yummy when you are hungover. I also like the chicken tacos and taquitos. Basically anything with chicken is going to be great. 

The free chips and salsa you get when you sit down are also tasty. The salsa is mild, but that is how I like it... They have a small salsa bar as well for those that like it hotter.

I love that! The couple are as sweet as an be, and you simply cannot be in the place without hearing a customer comment on how delicious the food is. And they are all so right! It's always a preference thing, but my preference is to have fluffy Spanish rice and well cooked but not soupy refried or whole pinto beans. I also like the option of a very hot salsa. That's exactly what you'll get here. And I love the addition of grilled onion to the al pastor tacos (in addition to the raw ones in the pico). It really adds another level to the already delicious taco. My other favorite is the #9 caldo de pollo with pico and avocado. Personally, I don't like chicken on the bone.

The food arrived along with a bag of tortilla chips, a side of guacamole and some pico.

The tostada's were very soggy and soft almost like a cooked soft taco, not a crunchy tostada.  The Tacos were really good and the chimichanga, I've seen much larger, but it was good.  

The chimichanga came with rice and beans.  The chicken was very tasty and well seasoned.  The side of guacamole was awesome, really surprised at how good it was, very impressed...great tasting chicken, guacamole, the Tacos, wow.

The rice and beans were the down fall as they were very bland.  The rice lacked seasoning and the beans also were just very bland.

I would order from here again but not get the rice, beans or chips as none of these were very memorable.  I guess the only memory of those 3 items were BLAND.  Everything else was amazing and I would try this place again.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,13,6,3,7HFrqDt-SiIALbs-HHWYjg

It was more like the nachos from Taco Bell, except I like Taco Bell's version better. I was starving so I doused it with lime and hot sauce and went on my merry way.

Having worked in a Mexican restaurant for three years. Keep your jokes about the role reversals to yourselves. That is probably one of the reasons why I am not that fond of food from south of the border. I am the minority in a group that loves Mexican and Tex-Mex food. 

Located behind the convenience store, this place is easily overlooked if you are not searching for it. I almost didn't find it even though I was on a mission. 

The restaurant was empty, so we were the focus. It probably would have been the same if there were others there as well. The lady working the front was friendly and quick to check up on us. As soon as we sat down, we were given a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa. Both are bottomless. They offer a salsa bar, but none of the other salsas taste as good as the pico de gallo. 

We had ordered water to drink, but when she came back I was surprised that she brought bottled water. It is a dollar, if you don't want to pay, make sure to clearly state tap. This just added to the authenticity of my visit. I pretended that we were in Mexico and it was unsafe to drink the tap water.

Thanks to a friend, every time I go to a Mexican restaurant I wonder how their carnitas are. I ordered the slow cooked pork in a burrito with guacamole and asked for it smothered in the green chili sauce. The burrito is large, stuffed with meat, rice, beans, and a good helping of the green stuff. It was fantastic. The pork was juicy without being too fatty. My only complaints are that the carnitas were overly seasoned and none of the salsas packed any heat. If not for the other ingredients, the burrito would have been extremely salty. My friend had ordered the vegetarian burrito with the same extras as I. She loved that they had sauteed cabbage in addition to the normal peppers and onions. 

For both of our meals, it came out to twenty one dollars and some change. I would not think twice about coming back here again.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,4,aEBBZigyYXlXkDsr_7YR_w

I opted for the three taco lunch special which comes with three tacos of your choice and a soda. They have hard and soft shell options. I chose the hard shell chicken taco and two soft with carne asada and carnitas, just to get a little sampling of a few options. My dining partner ordered the burrito special with chicken. The chicken and carne asada were pretty good, I was a little disappointed by the carnitas. All the tacos could have used a little more flavoring as they seemed a little on the blander side, but there is potential. I added some of the salsas they offer at their salsa bar, which only consists of three varieties (medium, hot and verde) and that helped. My coworker said her burrito was just ok. She had hoped it would be a little on the cheesier side. 

Overall, I had a pleasant meal and I look forward to giving this little shop another chance soon since their prices seem pretty reasonable and they have a relatively extensive menu.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,3,7mmbu5o_2ZqvFZz3nSz4Ag
