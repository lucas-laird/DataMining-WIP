214304,2010-02-21,0,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"Went on Valentine's Day for dinner. Chose this establishment because Brand is open to the casino and didn't have the ambiance we wanted. 

The wine selection is interesting. More so by what they didn't have, such as Riesling, Gewurztraminer and Lambrusco. 

Ordered both of the veal dishes, salmon penne and lobster ravioli (special). The veal dishes were excellent, and decent portions. The penne was barely filling, and the ravioli was comprised of about 8 little pieces. I filled up on bread. 

Food is expensive, but was prepared well. Service was more than adequate. Attire kinda business casual.",9bLqGAjpAZAfsUfLjr8KLg,1,0,4,76jl450is_po1Ri43ap97g

It was a slower weekday and they were able to accommodate us in the back away from most people in case the kids were loud, which was great for us since we didn't have to ask. The meals were delicious and they were reasonably priced as well. They bring out a baguette with some marinara sauce to dip it in and it was nice and hot, fresh out of the oven.

Our server was attentive and helpful and the service was quick as well. We ordered the ravioli, the Alfredo and kids pizza. We all came away full and satisfied. We definitely will check this place out again during our next visit if we stay at the Monte Carlo again.

For the main course we had some kind of pasta with Italian sausage (sorry for not remembering the exact dish). It was very delicious. While the food servings were kind of small for the prices, the taste was great. What took our experience to the next level was the service. It was amazing. Everyone involved in providing us with something that night was courteous, on time, and made the entire experience enjoyable.

We started with a family style salad and some appetizers: calamari, meatballs, and bruschetta.  They were all quite tasty - the sauce on the meatballs had a nice kick to them.

They had great breadsticks that we all loved - they couldn't refill it fast enough!

Everyone had something different for dinner: pizzas were excellent, pastas were excellent, steaks were good too.  Everyone was quite satisfied with their meals.

Most of the table ordered desserts - most people were disappointed with their desserts.

Service very good. Atmosphere horrible. They piped in some very loud and annoying music that I even heard other diners complaining about.  The lighting was too bright and the blue checked paper-topped tables killed any chance for atmosphere that may have existed.

My husband and I first tried this restaurant in January 2012 during our anniversary stay at the Monte Carlo. We were amazed at the fantastic customer service here. The Bucatini with meatballs won my husband over (and he's pretty picky about good food). Fast forward to 2013, we were back for more to celebrate our anniversary again. Why mess up a good thing, we've been waiting a whole year to come back to this restaurant. Nothing had changed, if anything, it got better. The customer service was just as superb as we remembered it. Our waiter, Joe, was very pleasant, gave us all the specials, made eye contact, was consistently checking on us (but not being pushy whatsoever), always refilling our water and beverages, we never once felt rushed. The restaurant manager himself, Robert, himself seated us the moment we saw us at the front. We praised him for such wonderful service and food, told him how much we love the restaurant and how we were celebrating our anniversary there for a second year in a row. Husband had the Bucatini of course, and I tried the classic fetuccine alfredo w/perfectly seared chicken.

Bottom line: 
-Our food arrived right away and it all tasted GREAT!
-Service was EXCEPTIONAL!
-The decor and interior is super clean and mod
-Prices are not overcharged
-Overall, we LOVE our little gem and will definitely be back again!!

And thank you again, Robert, for our anniversary apple crostada that we were surprised with at the end of our meal!",OzNV_yhZYKNc8XOXSTeWvA,2,1,5,zjrsQRXFWcU2qYslhW1zKA

The Tuscan Bean soup was delicious, the beans were the perfect consistency, the pancetta was a good size and not over cooked.

The stuffed zucchini, was horrible.  But it was free with a check in on four square so I can't complain.

The rigatoni with sausage was amazing.  The noodles were cooked al dente as pasta should be.  The sauce was reduced to create a fantastic thickness. The sausage is chunks and  had great spices, not hot but spices.  And it was topped with a dollop of ricotta cheese.  Highly recommended.

The tiramisu was acceptable, not great not bad.  And the coffee was good, I like to have it black because you can taste the actual coffee.

The server was named Daniela and she was amazing.  She was on top of the entire meal and the timing of the meal done well and I always had everything I needed.  If she is available definitely get her.  Thank you for a great meal.",DQMSVcggn4o2jQ-MXOllBA,2,0,5,5lSDN5ubmAl7p3ubkpAGpw

1112676,2017-02-03,0,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"Came hare couple of nights earlier when i was in vegas . Was looking for an italian restaurant to try and wahla....found this one on yelp. The price seems reasonable and it has good review. Anyway, my yelp searches based mostly on my intuition of the pictures sent by the reviewers. Like how Andrew Zimmermern said it ""if it looks good, eat it"" so yeah...

When we came the restaurant was basically empty and only had one table occupied. Heard it was a slow week in Vegas. We were greeted by the server who was nice and friendly. Was shown couple of ""extra menu"" and menu of the day together with the pricing. Great we dont want to eat and suddenly got blinsided with the price that left us in debt for the rest of the month. After much consideration, i choose Squid ink pasta with sauteed shrimp and squid...sounds good to me.

While waited, we were given 2 huge breadsticks with a dipping of marinara sauce and a goat cheese. It dint take long before we got our order. It looks yummy...yum yum...and as i took my first bite, its indeed was delicious! tell you, this is my first time trying squid ink pasta as they are very rare for you to see part of the menu on any so called italian restaurant and gosh...this pasta was something else. They cooked it al dente..has a nice bite to it and the lobster sauce was creamy and tasted delicious together with the shrimp and squid they had a good chew to them. I was enjoying my dinner every minute of it..knowing this will be my first and last before i leave vegas.

Like i said, service was great, the server would asked me and my partner if they was anything we need and i felt i being acknowledged. Most of the times they would just ignored me and would just asked my partner as if im invisible. Here's the tip for all the server out there, it might seems you guys forgot whose the boss here haha....my partner might be paying the meal but im the one who made the decision where to eat. so if i dont like your service you guys probably wont get our business in the future haha....

anyway, the dinner was out of this world and we left happy with all that was offered and here's the thing with so much restaurants to choose from on the strip there are alot of italian restaurants that are pretty reasonable in price and still has a damn great menu. Im definitely will come back to this place again the next time im in vegas.",BzSgU62VJmxYFBmWg9PueA,0,0,5,jza6THJsbTML71O2ws4tqw

Upon being seated, we were instantly greeted by our wonderful server who informed us of their evening specials (neither of which we tried) and their featured cheeses for an appetizer. We ordered the cheese plate to start and it was amazing. 
I ordered the Lobster Ravioli, Mother In Law had the Lasagna and Husband had the Canilonni. Our meals and dining experience exceeded our expectations. Everything was absolutely delicious. We were so stuffed from drinks and dinner that there was no room for dessert.

We chose D Vino because it was nicer than the other on site locations such as the Pub and Diablos and less pretentious than Andres Steakhouse.

We liked D Vino except it was too close to the gaming floor and we could feel the bass and hear the music blaring. I usually don't mind this type of thing, especially in Vegas, but it was a special occasion.

A nice bonus was they accepted our $50 dinning credit that the hotel gave us. We used that on a $48 bottle of wine (winning). It was the cheapest one they offered (womp, womp). 

The menu was priced well. We got a flatbread pizza, which was more like a thin-crust for $13 and then some fried calamari for about $12. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive and the place was not crowded. Would recommend but not for a quite meal.

Our server (who may also be a manager) was very attentive, got our order correct without writing it down (which usually drives me crazy, but hey, if you've got that gift, go for it!), checked on us regularly and was truly a gem to deal with. The bartender was a doll also. We got the meatball sliders, chicken parm sliders, the cheese board, bruschetta and fondue, each for just $6. All of the food was terrific, especially the fondue. I wasn't too excited about one of the cheeses on the cheese board (a port wine cheddar of some sort) and our server noticed. Without making a mention of it (there was plenty of other food!), she showed up with a nice size piece of a different cheese that was absolutely amazing. She said, ""I brought you another cheese as you didn't seem to be enjoying the one."" We then made a joke that we didn't get a cherry in our second drink, to which she responded with a small water glass 1/3 of the way full of cherries. That is someone who actually cares about their patron which is a far cry from some of the other Vegas establishments, unfortunately. It just made for an enjoyable time.

The linguine with four shrimp scampi was cooked to perfection. Al dente, tasty, and not too oily. The meat ravioli could have been hotter but they were housemade and sauced well.

So we got Calamari as a starter and it was burnt. literally. burnt. We returned it and i dont know if im just spoiled or not but the manager never came out to talk to us. I thought that was common practice but o well. watever. the next batch to come out was good not great but we ate it. The only thing that saves this place is the fact that my wife loved her dished but i hated mine. If you can stay away from this place.

D'vino is located toward the end of the casino floor, so it's not really too crazy right outside of the restaurant which is wide open to the gaming area.  There are dining areas away from the gaming area if you need to get away.  

Love the hot giant bread stick they start you off with.  Should have asked for butter instead of relying on the marinara sauce they provide.  The tomato and mozzarella salad was great and so was the grilled shrimp appetizer.  My portion of sausage and beef lasagne was huge and I was amazingly unable to finish it.

2011334,2012-12-11,0,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"I'm perplexed as to where in the world the mediocre ratings are coming from, this place is AWESOME!

I stumbled upon this beautiful little hideaway a year ago when I saw they were having a sort of oyster-fest (which they don't carry all the time, unfortunately) and found a new favorite Italian place in the process!

The interior is elegant with clean lines (which we all know I love) and a very friendly vibe. I knew I'd love it as soon as I saw it.

I've been here several times and have just loved it every time. I have no idea what the complaints are about because I rank this as a top spot for both dropping in for a drink as well as dinner.

Stopped in last night for my favorite beer, Chimay, and a little appetizer before heading out for the night. Ashley the beautiful bartender is sweet and engaging (and a fellow yelper!) and doesn't make you feel like you're one of many customers. I'll go back just for how nice she makes the bar experience. 

While there at the bar I had the meatballs al forno, a favorite dish of mine, and they were perfection. They were half pork shoulder/half veal, I was told, and that definitely contributed to their supreme tenderness while the pork held them together perfectly. They were in a mildly spicy tomato sauce that was a perfect accompaniment. Really, really enjoyed these.

I've been here before and had the olive oil and bread and the pasta and pizza and I really, really, loved them. The service was excellent even at the busy  time of night that we went. 

I went back again (had the meatballs AGAIN - still delicious!) and had the stuffed zucchini as well. It was the perfect size together for a small meal. The zucchini had a great flavor and I really liked the mozzarella topping. For dessert I had the tiramisu. Oh. Wow. I really loved the SUBTLE flavor of espresso. Sometimes you can get a tiramisu where the espresso just overpowers the other flavors but this was just right. It was a nice size and melted in my mouth. I highly recommend.

I suggest you really go and give this a chance. I really am so surprised at the negative reviews because I've been here and have only great experiences.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,5,1,5,Iqk6Xvnd_RPfUSbwbtmWZA

Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.

While talking about our dining options, I often heard: ""It's expensive!"" ""Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!"" ""That's such a small portion!"" ""Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!"" ""Umm...where else can we go?"" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.

PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is ""scallopy"" a word? Well, it should be!

Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.

OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!

TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.

PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.

SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, ""She's busy."" Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.

I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.",HCP1pR_44Pw5_BiWAp47-Q,39,38,3,IAMRXETWwWHBk9o9nMRUCA

Our entrees were both pastas and were tasty. The carbonara was good as was the squid ink, although the squid ink could have used a bit of salt or some other seasoning to help with the richness.

Our drinks weren't good by any means. Both mixed drinks that tasted like straight syrup. The manager was very helpful with responding to our comments complaining about the drinks though.

(I EVEN  hand him the plate, TO help jump start the process since he was obviously dropped on the head as a baby)

-HIM, while holding the plate ""What would you like me to do with it?""

-ME,   Stunned... ""WELL I AM CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO EAT THAT, SO YOU NEED TO MAKE ME A NEW ONE""


-HIM, looks at me dazed, than stares at me for another 15 seconds
 ""uhh, you want the same thing?

-ME, YES!!!

KEEP IN MIND, HE NEVER APOLOGIZED!!!! OR EVEN OFFER ME SOMETHING WHILE I WAITED!

OR EVEN CAME TO OUR TABLE LIKE A GOOD BOSS WOULD AND APOLOGIZE ABOUT HE EARLY MEAL, & LACK OF QUALITY SERVICE.

ALL HE DID WAS WALK PAST OUR TABLE AND SMILE, AND SMILE..

HE MUST HAVE BEEN DROPPED AS A BABY AND AS AN ADULT CAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY DEFECTED ABOUT THIS DUDE!

BY THEN WE WERE ALL QUESTIONING MY REPLACEMENT MEAL CAUSE BY THE WAY HE WAS WALKING NEAR OUR TABLE, AND GIGGLING WITH HIS EMPLOYEE'S IT SEEMED AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING UP HIS WHOLE DAMN ARM, AROUND HIS BACK, AND DOWN TO HIS DAMN FEET ! F*CK THE SLEEVE!

So, as soon as he personally brought out my replacement meal, the last time i checked I KNOW i have perfect vision okay, my optometrist even said so! SO when i asked him why the NOODLES HAD all of a sudden gotten larger he DENIED IT AND CLAIMS IT WAS THE SAME EXACT NOODLE AS BEFORE!!

SO HE LEAVES, I TAKE A BITE, AND EVERY ONE AT MY TABLE ALSO AGREE THAT IS IS NOT THE SAME NOODLE STRANDS.


I THEN REFUSE TO FINISH MY MEAL, THAN ASK THE SERVER WHY THE TWO MEALS I ORDERED WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?

HE THEN SAYS ""The noodles you have now are not regular spaghetti noodles, they have a thicker texture with a hole in the middle""
he also told me what they were called but i forgot!

SO THERE YA GO!


-EVEN HIS EMPLOYEE could tell the difference and he couldnt?
OR IS IT CAUSE HE DIDNT WANT TO LOSE ANY PROFITS IN MAKING ME A NEW DISH?



THIS RESTAURANT MADE MY FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE AT MONTE CARLO A REAL NEGATIVE ONE!! 

I WILL NEVER EVER DINE HERE AGAIN!!!!


-I SPOKE TO THE HEAD OF THE HOTEL AND LUCKY FOR THAT DOUCHE, THEY CAN'T DO MUCH SINCE IT IS PRIVATELY OWNED!!!
TRUST THAT IF THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO HAVE HIS POSITION JEOPARDIZED. IT WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


STAY AWAY.

2870846,2010-05-28,0,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"Arghle.  I wanted to like d.Vino so badly, with its adorable kitschy little posters all over the Monte Carlo of a pin-up riding a Vespa on a red checked background.  I'm a total sucker for stuff like that.

A quick note: If you're the guy at the $25 blackjack table playing $50 a hand, you can go ahead and skip the rest of this review because you are for shizz not going to have the same problems at d.Vino that I had.

The night started out promisingly, with a cute little area at the front for our party of 9 to wait (and a teal Vespa on a pedestal behind the bar) , and a just-right round table where we could all see each other.  We were brought the d.Vino ""house water,"" which comes in clear wine bottles and which, at first, we were not sure was free.  Our server explained that they sterilize wine bottles to serve their triple-filtered tap water, and to their credit, it was very good water.  (Weird, I agree, but a nice touch.)

A couple of us ordered the soup del giorno, a cream of artichoke and sweet corn garnished with a quenelle of ricotta and a drizzle of olive oil, and it was incredible (although the puree was sort of an off-putting non-color).  They brought out baskets of several kinds of yummy breads with fresh pesto and little cigars of butter drizzled with something tomatoey and salty.

Things went downhill from there.  The Caesar salad is $12, and a few in our party split a couple for appetizers.  They're not for splitting.  They're salad-sized square glass plates with a couple leaves of romaine, two small sheets of parmesan, and maybe five or six croutons.  I don't care how good your salad is (and it wasn't great), $12 for the ingredients on that plate is beyond outrageous.  Worse, two in our party ordered salads plus chicken as meals, and the meal-sized salads, while $5 more, were no bigger.  Just, there was also some chicken.  WTF?  The rest of the entree portions were similarly deplorable, employing the Big Empty Plate aesthetic that I despise so, so much.  

I had the chicken parmigiana, easily the largest entree on the table, and it was average.  The breading was overly herby and quite spikey, not quite fine enough, which gave it a weird texture, and the mozzarella was giving off a ""they just opened a bag of Kraft"" vibes.  However, the sauce on the accompanying spaghetti was a light, buttery pomodoro that was the highlight of the plate.  There was just nothing about it that was worth $22.

One of us got the prix-fixe meal, which came with tirimasu that was similarly average.  It was small, mostly ladyfingers, and served with two ladyfingers as garnish.  Maybe it's me, but ladyfingers are useless cookies unless they're soaked in espresso and smothered in marscapone custard, and they were just too dry to eat.  We didn't finish the tirimasu, which would surprise you if you knew my family, and should maybe surprise you anyway since I'll remind you that there were nine of us.

Worst point of the evening was the service, which was grumpy and lacking.  They seemed understaffed, but the place was sort of empty.  When we realized that they had tacked on 20% gratuity to the bill, it became clear that our server knew she wouldn't have to work for a very decent tip (came out to be like $56, pretty nice for an hour's work) so she just didn't bother.  We were sort of disgusted by the tip issue... it's not surprising to have a tip added to a large party, but it's almost always mentioned verbally or on the menu, and it's never more than 18%.  The food wasn't worth the price, the service wasn't worth the tip.  Go to the Cafe instead.",PcTKD5172Yer60ZBiev4rg,0,0,2,VghsZSQQla7ONRlURpAyXA

2921453,2011-06-29,0,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"D.Vino is nside the Monte Carlo and situated right near the front  with the restaurant entrance right on to the casino floor.  I sat at the bar, which isn't really this places scene, but I was by myself and they probably wanted me away from the more distinguished clientele.  The service was fine, the bartender was more interested in chatting up the middle aged woman sitting next to me than myself, but I wasn't hurt too badly by it.  The free bread that comes with roasted garlic and some sort of parsley olive oil was good to great in my book.
I ordered a large glass (they have 3 sizes) of the cheapest chianti and it sucked, and then I ordered some other red (maybe a cab) and it was decent.  Prices were a bit high for the cheap end stuff, but if I was looking to drop some serious bills on my wine (always a better decision) the list looked pretty good.
For my entree I think I had some sort of chicken parm. dish, that was large and well cooked.  It came with some eggplant that was okay, but the real surprise was that it was a LARGE plate of food, given that usually Italian places always leave me wanting more.  Add to that it was delicious and you have got me sold.
I was looking to spend 40 and ended up dropping closer to 60.  D.Vino is a good spot, but not sure if it can compete in the 60 bracket, but in the 40 bracket it is a 5 star to be sure.",-pm-6Ma8PxYYE1ef0B7fKA,1,0,4,NosQ4e76eGezFHxeNwdQfQ

They wanted a $500 non refundable deposit to hold the table which is ridiculous since there was maybe only 10 other people in the restaurant while we were there. The waitress, Angela, acted like she didn't really want to be there. After bringing me a coffee I had to ask for sugar and a spoon (she brought me a soup spoon). I was never asked if I wanted a refill on the beer I ordered. At the beginning of the meal she spilled my friends red wine all over her. There was no apology or even a comp on the wine! She received a generous tip from the 7 parties but really didn't earn it. Food was nothing to write home about---macaroni grill quality but smaller portions. The chocolate cake I ordered for desert was very small. Prices overall were high for the quality of the food.

As nothing is too classic in Vegas, this Italian restaurant accomplishes that with unique twists on a very poised and well done menu.

Service was prompt from the beginning, though the hostess was a bit abrupt.  Our server, Tiffany, was excellent, thorough and quick to refill a beverage.  The food however, was bland at best and misleading at worst.  We went with the fixed menu (possibly the first mistake) and were very disappointed.  The Caesar salad was bland, but not terrible.  The entrees however, were awful.  I had the lasagna which was fine except that they had evidently layered two slices of american cheese (though white) over the top and had not taken the time to properly melt them.  It really detracted from the taste.  My boyfriend had ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, which came with ""garlic toast.""  Upon receiving the entree, he asked about the garlic toast.  The server said that it didn't come with the meal.  So we asked our server, Tiffany.  She brought over the menu and when we pointed out the actual words on the menu, she told us that this meant ""toasted garlic in the sauce not garlic bread.""  She was as friendly as possible about it, but could obviously see our unhappy expressions.   Then, to top it off, dessert arrives--a dessert we ordered on her recommendation.  It was supposed to be a custard topped with strawberries.  The custard came, and the strawberries were missing.  When I asked, she looked embarrassed and said that they had just run out of strawberries.  At that point I was just fed up.  Instead of letting us know that they were out of something so that we could change our order, they tried to serve a half-assed dish and hope that we wouldn't notice.  To compensate us for our ""trouble"" they took 25% off the bill, which afterwards was still $72.   I think it was highly overpriced, mediocre food, and I will not be returning, nor will I be recommending it.",yxo5-2wG9FDGY94NRlrD0Q,0,0,1,Oi2H72lfDli8U-0GWQ-V1Q

Our server was lovely and was very helpful in narrowing down our selections from the menu (I wanted about 6 things and she reeled me in).  We started with the meat and cheese plate which at market price ran at $30. It came with toasted bread, 3 different cheeses, 2 chutneys, pickled veggies, prosciutto, salami and bresaola. It was delicious and huge and was definitely not the right choice for only 2 people to share who also had intentions of eating entrees that night...I still don't regret it.

My fiance had the penne Ala vodka which came with crispy bacon. He said it was good but that he wished there had been a more substantial protein in it. He also felt that the pasta was not a fresh homemade pasta (it was missing that slight gumminess that let's you know it just came out of the pasta roller).

I had the chicken saltimbocca cannelloni. It was wonderful. The pasta did not disappoint and was clearly fresh. There were 3 very large tubes of it stuffed chalk full of a delicious roast chicken, ricotta and spinach blend. It came covered in cheese and piled high with prosciutto (like I needed any more after that meat plate!).  The only thing I wish there had been more of was the jus to slop it around in.

It was a great meal and considering the ambiance, level of service and the quantity AND quality of the food I was pleasantly surprised by our bill! We'll definitely be back on our next visit to Vegas.",0ppWaUaQu7JvzoMr3fUtjw,0,0,4,jIWpYMJXU0Jx9MeSmSwgQw

We then moved on the cheese plate -- a good selection of cheeses & prosciuttos and served plank-style with the fruit & honeycomb,etc.  Delicious cheeses and a great proscuitto with even more bread, etc.

Service was ok -- fortunately we knew what the cheeses were because our waiter, when questioned about the cheese options, told us that he hadn't learned all of them yet because he was lactose-intolerant.  Wow -- TMI!  Anywho, other than that faux pas, he was attentive and eager.

Wine list was ok, with a decent mix -- should have gone with a wine by the glass, the bottle we had was fine (wine wise), just not my favorite enough to finish a whole bottle.

Would have felt much better about it if we had spent $40 - $50 for the cheese plate & wine (BTG) instead of almost $100 for the cheese and bottle of wine (that we took with us & I ended up pouring out the next morning when we checked out of the Bellagio).

3954970,2011-09-04,1,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"Unlike some of the other reviews that I've seen for this place, I actually enjoyed the menu/my dining experience.  I actually thought that it was a pretty good meal. 

We came here since I wanted to try out the menu for restaurant week.  So, I got there before the boyfriend and had a seat at the bar.  Yes, I was promptly greeting by a smiling host and hostess.  Afterwards, i was helped by the bartender, and ordered some wine while waiting.  

After my boyfriend showed up and we were seated toward the rear part of the restaurant (for a more private dining experience), we had some water and focaccia bread (with an olive oil/herb dipping sauce) while figuring out what to order.  I decided that I didn't need to be drinking and stuck with the regular water (which was refilled by the wait staff on a regular basis), while my boyfriend opted for a glass of red wine.  

For our first courses, my boyfriend had the stuffed zucchini with tomato and mozzarella, and bread crumbs, while I had the mussels that were in their own tomato broth (a little spicy) with onions and 2 crostini.  Both were so delicious, but they were also quite hot (which we found out after basically burning our tongues).  

Next, he had the Tuscan bean soup with white beans, veggies, pancetta, and red chard.  I, on the other hand, had a really small Caesar salad.  When I say it was small, I mean that I finished the salad in almost 4 bites.  His soup was great, though, although quite hot to begin with.  Again, his soup was delicious, while my salad was, well, a small salad.  

For our third courses, we both opted to eat the beef.  Could we have decided on different entrees?  Yes.  However, I already knew that I didn't care for trout or chicken when there was some steak (prime sirloin) that I could have and thoroughly enjoy.  I'll admit that we both got our steaks medium rare, complete with a selection of vegetables and tiny potatoes.  Were we pleased with our decisions?  Of course.  The steak hasn't been the best that I've ever had, but it was quite juicy and cooked to my liking.  

For our final course, we both decided to order tiramisu, our favorite, instead of the vanilla panna cotta berry compote.  Again, why mess with what you know and love?  So, when our two slices of tiramisu arrived, we ordered a coffee and quickly devoured the goodness.  Honestly, I've had quite a bit of tiramisu in my day, but I did enjoy eating this particular one--they didn't overdo the shaved chocolate on top, and I thought that it was quite moist and juicy.

All in all, a great time, and I definitely want to come back here again should I have a tiramisu craving.  I enjoyed my dining experience, really appreciated the staff's friendliness and attentiveness.  True, we got there at about 5:30pm and it was relatively dead, but I'll admit that I thought that the staff handled us well (even after more customers started showing up).  

I'll definitely come back here, should I have another opportunity.",QiDtS54JwTGeH81c-a84WQ,1,1,4,L80uI7MQNVeovtGnHqJmHQ

Once we arrived, the host sat us immediately. The restaurant was empty for a Saturday night. We were greeted promptly by our waitress, who was friendly and groomed well. 

We ordered a glass of Cabernet and a cucumber Tini. The martini was extremely refreshing and a def. try!

I asked about their charcuterie options on the menu, and our waitress had no idea the meaning let alone what their own menu offers. It's ok, we diverted and ordered the mussels in a tomato breath to start. It was tasty but very small mussels. 

For our entree we had the bacon wrapped tenderloin. It was very good and the the risotto it was placed on top of was made on point. 

We also ordered clams with linguine. NO FLAVOR. I literally had to ask for two portions of red pepper flakes to add some flavor in it. I would not recommend this dish at all.

Overall the prices were good, ambiance was very homey, and service was ok. One suggestion I do have is a dress code. We noticed patrons in pajamas, booty shorts, while we arrived in business casual attire.

My friend order the caprese salad and the bolanese, and I had the wide noodle with arugula, and prawns.  My dish was really good and I enjoyed every bite.

My friend had a cappuccino as her dessert as well.  The bill was pricey, but hey, it's a restaurant on the strip...what do you expect?

4049070,2009-12-09,0,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"Had an hour or so to kill before we headed down the strip for dinner reservations, so we made our way through the sad, smoky casino, which was nearly deserted on Thanksgiving weekend, towards the ass-end of the Monte Carlo. The location of d.Vino is hidden at best (though strategically positioned right across from the theater entrance).

We sat at the bar for a drink and I scanned the menu expecting to find yet another uninspired, sad-sack wine menu put together by some flunkie. Oops, I was wrong. Some pleasant suprises on there, including several more obscure italian reds, and an interesting assortment of beers from the same.  Anyone familiar with Italian beermaking knows that for years the best we've been able to procure in the states is Peroni or Moretti, neither which are worth the cost of shipping it over in the first place.  Imagine my surprise when they  had a good half-dozen microbrews, including a $15-a-bottle chestnut ale.

Well, I love beer and I'm a sucker for chestnuts, so I ordered it (got their last bottle). While we chatted up Brook, the bartender, we realized he was one of the very few that gave half a damn about the propagation and preservation of his craft; we discussed everything from the history of cocktails to the impact of different gins in a mixed drink. 

Our conversation meandered to the usage of bitters, and I lamented the fact that so few bars stock an ingredient necessary to my favorite libation: an Old Fashioned. He, produced a bottle of Fee's Orange Bitters from under the counter with a flourish, ""You mean this?"" SOLD. Yes, bad idea to mix drinks but finding a barkeep that doesn't screw up an Old Fashioned is a rarity. His was one of the best I've had, ever. 

He also challenged my  wife's assertion that gin drinks taste terrible by whipping up an ominous-sounding cocktail called ""Satan's whiskers"" and offering to toss it and make something else if she didn't LOVE it. Well, he lost no money on that wager. She's adding it to  her permanent rotation. 

We hadn't the chance to investigate d.Vino's food menu but it looked varied enough. It's on our list to try in the future, even if we won't stay at the hotel next time.",8RamU2tsOai1MIokiYqC1w,0,0,4,db1cjCeitVCLr6CQeFY55Q

Way too much food (but it was nice to have some munchy food for our walk on the strip later).

Overall a good experience. Drinks were expensive however ($12-$15 each) and they didn't list the prices on the drink menu so beware.

So we were looking for a place to dine that was conveniant and on-property. We decided to eat at D Vino because it is located across from the theater and we both love Italian food. The restaurant atmosphere itself is nice. We sat down right away and was served bread and garlic/pesto oil. The bread was good. Our waitress had a luke warm attitude though. She didn't seem overly excited to explain anything when we asked her questions about certain drinks or entrees on the menu. I settled for the mushroom ravioli while the BF ordered linguine w/clams.  I also ordered a glass of wine that came in a champagne flute because they supposedly ran out of wine glasses? I guess not too much of a big deal though...I was still able to enjoy it. The entrees however took forever to receive. Thank god for the bread basket because I would have passed out from starvation.  When I finally received my ravioli I was very disappointed. Not only was the presentation bad (soupy noodles soaked in watery looking marinara sauce) but it tasted bad as well. I've had better tasting ravioli coming out of a can of chef boyardee ??(spell check that).  The BF's  linguine was bland and had no flavor as well. I tasted a couple of bites of his entree and the clams were very rubbery. We finished our meal and raced out of there in time to catch the show. Fast forward 2 hours later after seeing the fabulous Jabbawockees show......the BF was not feeling well at all. To make a long story longer.....he spent the rest of his night in the bathroom .....suffering from food poisoning....bad stomach pains....throwing up....etc...

We actually came to eat here for lunch twice during our stay at the Monte Carlo because of the price and quality of food. The menu gave you different options per course to mix and match which gave us the opportunity to try different meals each time. 

We started with bread that had a parsley spread which was amazing. You can taste the light balsamic vinaigrette accompanied by a good amount of chopped parsley. 

I ordered the Cesar salad as opposed to the soup because it was hot outside and I really didn't feel like eating soup. You can't really mess up on a Cesar salad, but this one was pretty tasty. The dressing was light so that every piece of lettuce was lightly sauced but not over bearing. I especially loved the Parmesan shavings!! I love cheese and there were enough shavings for every bite! It was soooo good I had it twice! 

My main course on day 1 consisted of Skewered beef and the Penne Pesto Pasta. The skewered beef was dry and tasted like cow.. not in a good way. The Penne Pasta, however, was amazingly delicious. Dipping the meat in the pasta sauce made it taste better. 

My main course on day 2 consisted of Chicken and Spaghetti Pomodoro. Both dishes were scrumptious!!! The chicken was tender and saucy. It came with capers as well that complimented the white sauce. The spag was flavorful and you can taste the fresh tomatoes. 

Ambiance: Classy and sophisticated. Despite the Vespa propped on top of the bar.  The walls were lined with what looked like a wine cellar theme/book case of wine.

But, for the first time in my entire life, I left a restaurant without leaving a tip.  Let me tell you why...

The BF and I were in the Monte Carlo because we were seeing the Jabbawokeez show.  When we picked up our tickets at will call, the ticket agent asked if we had eaten yet, and offered us 20% off coupons for d. Vino, and the Asian noodle place next door.  We decided on Italian because he said they could definitely get us in and out before our show that started in just over a hour.  

Things started off well...we were seated immediately, and our 'server' greeted us after a few minutes to take our drink order.  We both stuck to water.  Then she left, presumably to give us a few minutes to look at the menu...and never came back.  We waited a full 15 minutes, and when the manager saw me doing the 'look around for my server' thing, he came over to see if everything was okay.  When I told him we were ready to order, he took our order.  

So, let me set up the timeline for you...from the time we gave our order, another table was seated next to us, ordered their food, ate their food, paid their bill and left...all before we got our food.  I swear i am not making this up.  Also, in the mean time, no server has returned to our table.  Only the busser with some bread...which was really good, btw.  

When our food arrives, there is no steak knife for my bf, and no one checks on us to see if we need anything.  I then have to walk up to the host stand, where the manager is standing to ask if we even have a server, bc no one has returned to our table since he took our order, other than to bring our food.  Yes, he got us a steak knife, but his lack of apology, or action to our poor service was incredibly frustrating.  

As far as the food goes, my shirmp and scallops meal was good, the BF's steak was bad, the spinach was good.  

When it came time to pay the bill, we chose not to leave a tip, because we honestly did not know who, if anyone, our server was!  I refused to leave even a sub-par tip that would go to someone we never saw.

5006965,2012-02-02,0,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,"I liked my seafood risotto and I liked how they added a lot of seafood to my dish, but the texture of the rice was a little raw for me. They still have some sort of a crunch to them. I like my risotto a bit more creamy, the perfect rice texture for me would be when it's not too chewy but still have a little bounce to each grain. It's kind of hard to describe rice, okay?

Server is nice, fills up our water whenever he sees necessary. We got seated on the ""outside"" area which is outside of the dining room, but still inside the casino. I felt like either the manager or the owner of the restaurant was a little rude. Not because he did something to us, but because he never came over to greet us. Even though he kept on going over to the table next to us to fill their wine, checking up on them. We were literally only about 3 steps away and it never occurred to him that we are paying customers too and a ""how's the food?"" would make us feel a little invisible from him. Two other tables around us also got the missing attention so shame on him for being selective-people pleaser.

The bill came out to be a little bit on the costly side when I didn't feel like the quality was worth it. I've had paid for fraction of the cost for something better. Although, if you go over to the box office, they have a 20% off coupon for you to use. Which was what got us to try this place in the first place.

Vino since I love Ravioli and they have a veal stuffed one on the menu.  I should have been tipped off when we waited for over 3 minutes at the front before a waiter noticed us at the front.  He did nothing.  Finally we walked toward the bar and asked the bar tender if he could get us a seat.  He nodded and nothing happened.  I figured it was just a shift change but 5 minutes later -- we should have left but just then a waiter noticed us and found us a seat.  10 minutes later another waiter appeared with menus.  So, we've been onsite for about 20 minutes and finally get a menu.  From there on the service was smooth.  We ordered and 20 minutes later our Ravs and Pasta arrived but no salad.
Excuse me we ordered a salad.  Opps, do you still want it? This is one of those questions that you could use in a comedy act - no I ordered it because I didn't want it.
Skipped the salad.  On to the pasta.  One fine and then my ravs - cold veal in the center.  So now we've been on site for an hour.  The good news is that the server never asked how the food was other than ""would you like to take the rest to go?"" No, it was cold when I got it.  Oh, I wished you had told me I could have gotten you something else.  He then left and returned with the check.  I should have made a fuss about the food and service but I'm just not that type.

From what I have heard the restaurant has changed chefs (if there is a chef) and you can tell as this place has an identity crisis. It is stuck between a formal Italian restaurant and a modern trendy restaurant which just leaves it as an awkward ambiance. 

We went on a Thursday night and sat in a side room they had. The night started off on the wrong foot with our waiter who made it apparent that he was not sure what he was doing by how he was acting. 

Things continued down hill as we received our appetizers. We ordered an olive plate, shrimp, muscles and calamari. It all seemed too prepared in advance and came out modestly warm. When our entrees came out we had the same experience. The food tasted alright, but nothing to think twice about. 

We also ordered desserts including ice cream and fried custard. From the reactions at the table, the ice cream was good and they do have a lot of different flavors, but the fried custard was not what i expected. I was expecting more of a Mexican fried ice cream, but received warm fried custard with pistachios which I was not expecting. I will give this dessert the benefit of the doubt as I bet some people would have enjoyed it.

As we were eating, the general manager came around to speak with us. I learned a few interesting facts about the restaurant. It is part of a group of establishments including Dragon Noodle next door and Morel's at the Venetian. The pizza dough is flown in from Napoli. The last, they use Kahlua in their tiramisu.

As we were waiting for our appetizer, I had ordered a cocktail. I forget the name, but it uses Kai lychee  vodka, creme di cassis, and orange bitters. It was on the sweet side. Fresh bread came out and the chimichurri that comes with it makes it that much better. A few minutes pass and the arancinis came out. The crispy outside and the creamy risotto center was good, but the bolognese sauce underneath makes it better. What this tells me is that the chef understands that the basics are fundamentally important. The sauces are flavorful and do not need to be drowning out the rest of the meal. The lasagna and pizza both had the right amount of sauce to enhance the dish and that's it.  At this point, I could not pick either as my favorite and that is not meant as a negative criticism. Our meal would not complete without dessert. A slice of tiramisu and a cup of coffee was calling my name. One piece was enough for us to share.

Obviously, we keep going back for a reason. But there are different reasons every time. Sometimes we hit the happy hour menu for wine and tapas in the front, sometimes we want a nice meal in the main dining room. Whatever we're looking for, d.Vino has it.

I tried the lamb sirloin on a recommendation from the waitress this past trip, and it was a great choice. M's salmon was cooked perfectly. The prices are right, the service is very good. 

If I have one beef with this place, it's that they bring out the breadsticks at a temperature just cooler than the surface of the sun. I'm not even sure how it's possible to get them that hot without them spontaneously combusting, but they seem to manage. And it wasn't a one-off thing, this literally happens every single time we go there.  So now we get the breadsticks and M and I stare at them like ""Are you gonna try that first?""  Eventually, one of us builds up enough courage to grab one, and laugh when we cheat death yet again.

Finally, it's moderately annoying that they won't credit your MLife account at the restaurant. They claim they can't do it, and you have to take the receipt to the MLife counter at the other end of the casino floor, wait in line, and have the desk physically add your points.

I have never, NEVER, been treated with such HORRIBLE customer service in my entire life. I literally wanted to cry, and there wasn't even anything wrong with MY food. 
SO, we came to D'Vino on our last day in Vegas September 4th. 
First of all, we walked in the resturant and we were literally the only customers there... which should have been our first clue, but we stayed anyways..... Long story short... It took approxamately 30-40 minutes to bring out our food when we were the only people in the resturant and it was lunch time, The waiter actually came out and asked if any of us speak spanish?!?. 3 of my friends meals were unsatisfactory. By the time the waiter got around to bringing out a spread for my friends sandwich and some mustard I was finished eating.  The mustard he brought was seriously some of the hottest mustard i have ever had, and he didn't even let her know. He also brought my friend some nasty red pesto aioli because they didnt have any mayonaise and their sandwices were so dry they couldn't eat them. So I asked to speak to the GM.... bad idea.... he came out with the worst attitude, I told him the problem and he then told us that was "" going to go scream at his kitchen staff"" 
then he argued with us about the mustard being hot, which he actually called ""yellow stuff"" he then told us this is the first complaint he has even gotten. I then told him that 2 of my friends were not going to eat their sandwiches and he said ""ok, what do you want me to do about it?"" so I said he should probably take them off the bill and to that he replied ""uh, well, I'll see if I can..."" 
Then he went in the kitchen and took 10 more miuntes to bring me my bill. Then he came out and sat at the table next to us while he called someone telling them exactly what we had said  while also yelling "" they didn't like it! NO they didn't like it"" So basically we wasted  2 hours on our last day to get yelled at and given a guilt trip. I will NEVER NEVER NEVER !!! Go back to D'Vino! and considering I left my phone number for the food and beverage manager with the concierge to call me and he never did, I probably will never be staying at the Monte Carlo again either.",LQTkbiGkEV5G4cNvXquuwQ,4,3,1,EygdjiPrCimBWVSMxDJmPQ

 - Appetizers didn't come out. They were just lagging big time. We had to wait almost 30 minutes to see the first plate of cheese and then another ten to get the second plate that was ordered. 

 - Entrees were no brought out at the same time. Like the polite group we were, no one ate a bite until the last plate hit the table. By the time it arrived, my food and majority of our parties food was luke warm. 

Here are the one pro:

 - The manager offered to take off one of the bottles of wine we ordered since he knew we had been waiting long for the food. 

I tried not to fill up on bread waiting, but it was really hard not to. I really wanted to finally like this place.

Service was below mediocre and the pizza I ordered got me sick that night. It was extremely heavy and crust was tasteless. My husband raved about his linguine with pomodoro. I noticed that the portion was incredibly small but the price was high. When I say small I mean it was portioned enough for a kids meal. He didn't seem to care because he said it was that good. 

The next night my husband said he wanted the linguine pomodoro again. I hesitated but decided to go for it. I was so happy that I did! Our waiter was awesome, attentive and was quick with ordering, bringing bread and bringing drinks/refills.
