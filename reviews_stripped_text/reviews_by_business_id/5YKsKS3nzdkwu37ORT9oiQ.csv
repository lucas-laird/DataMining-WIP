Biggest inconvenience is that due to never-ending construction, you have to walk waaaay far around to get to the bathrooms.

750223,2013-06-19,2,5YKsKS3nzdkwu37ORT9oiQ,"Despite quality toppings, the pizza is terrible because of the crust. 
They use a dough sheeter to flatten (stretch) the dough.  
They dock the dough (using a roller with protusions to put dents in the dough)
The dough is placed on a screen and then put into a deck oven.
Consequently, you get a dough prepared the same way a franchise pizzeria does.  No artisan pride in making pizza.  No chew to the crust.  A sad, sad, representation of what a dough should be.  It's a shame to put quality toppings on a dough this bad.
The décor is lovely and the wait staff attentive and friendly.  I'm shocked that this company could have more than one location.",HAa4ytf3zK-oRvmHgJQypA,2,0,1,EL6059oRX09l3AJKjw4tWg

Service - Jarrett was our server and he was fantastic.  Extremely personable, knowledgeable and really in sync with the menu and the establishment.   Especially astonishing given the fact that this place has been open for less than two weeks.  

Food - One large pizza, half Grilled Chicken Farm Goat and half Cheese Basil Chicken Sausage.  Soggy crust, bland sauce and unremarkable.

Drink - A port wine and almond soda concoction, the name escapes me (as I think I intentionally erased it from my memory) that tasted vaguely like a Hi-C drink.

Being a native of both New York City & Boston I check my finicky East Coast pizza munching history at the door when I know I'm about to order a West Coast Artisan Pizza.  But even by those standards the pizza was a fail.  Unfortunately we weren't hungry enough to order some of the things Jarrett suggested and the salads & wings (from afar) looked great.  My drink choice was also a fail, especially considering how many wonderful craft beers I had to choose from.

Atmosphere is very nice, they have two bars, one observing the kitchen and another the actual bar. They offer a decent amount of wines and some good beers too... 
We ordered Calamari as an appetizer which was fried nicely and the sauces were good too. My wife and I split a large pizza and had some to take home. There menu consists of a large variety of craft pizzas which all sounded appetizing and were not crazy combinations. The pizza had a good crust and the chefs were continually prepping ingredients to keep the product fresh. We also had a dessert which they bring in from a local bakery.
The server we had was very attentive and the manager made some small talk with us since we were one of the only groups dining. The place is new so I overheard some quality control checks, but it's good to know they're holding to their standards.

We happen to show up on a night where the place (an obvious KPC rip-off) was operating with ONE server for the whole establishment. That is not the servers fault however our table and the surrounding table were very dissatisfied with the experience. What the main issue is with MGR. Ken who eventually offered to make up for our displeasure by eating the bill and offering my wife a piece if chocolate cake and ice cream. However, Ken was seen sitting the entire time talking and focussed on his cell phone as the employee was spinning their wheels as best possible. ""KEN, YOU HAD A SERVER CALL IN, GET UP OFF YOU *SS AND HELP OUT!"" I know a little about the food business and guest service...do the right thing as it reflects on the owners investment!

2230282,2014-03-15,0,5YKsKS3nzdkwu37ORT9oiQ,"Eh. Only okay. The food is alright. The service is ho hum. There was nothing spectacular about our experience here. 
When we arrived we were the first table to be seated. It was myself, my friend and our 2 kids. Everyone moved at a glacial pace, never smiled and made us feel as if we were inconveniencing them by being in the establishment. The kids were well behaved for most of the visit, until the pizza had not arrived for some time. It was lunch time, they were hungry- so I can't blame them. I smelled something burning and I told my friend ""that's probably mine."" I was right. Gluten free crust is thin, I didn't order cheese so there was no need to leave the pizza in a long time (no waiting for it to ""bubble and melt""), so you have to watch the crust. By the time it arrived, my daughter was starving so we just ate it.
No one came to check on us to see if we needed more drinks, dessert, how the food was. I had to search out a server for our check. Again- I was made to feel as if I was an inconvenience.
I'm always excited when a new establishment opens (especially one that serves gluten free anything, since my DD has severe allergies), but unfortunately, I am not sure I will return.
Decor is beautiful though.",w3UMfW-XuIyKkgXEvK8N8g,1,0,3,p5TIwln8a94FeTFN5WQv5Q
2235896,2013-05-07,4,5YKsKS3nzdkwu37ORT9oiQ,"Flatbread Lounge just wouldn't have the same ring, but the latest addition to the ever-changing options at Tivoli Village is probably not the place to satisfy a craving for greasy, thin crust pizza. The pear-gorgonzola flatbread that I ordered here had a great balance of flavors, set off by a drizzle of balsamic syrup. However, the flatbread-style crust was slightly thick, chewy, and a bit dry-- not the most desirable vehicle for the delicious toppings. My personal-sized pizza, at around $10, was big enough to serve two people. The calamari salad ordered by my husband was also a generous portion. A  side of hand-cut french fries arrived coated in an addictive seasoning blend. The menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches is broad and great for sharing. A group could definitely enjoy an affordable night out while sampling a variety of Pizza Lounge's fare.

The vibe is dark and classy cool, but the tables are way too close together, which takes away from its appeal as a date night destination. The outdoor seating looked very nice, but the weather wasn't cooperating for this option. We prefer booth seating to accommodate a baby carrier, so we were seated tightly with groups on either side of our table. I may have been glancing at the progress of their meals, hoping they would be leaving soon. I can recommend Pizza Lounge for large groups-- if you are going to be right in the middle of others' conversations, you will feel more comfortable if you know these people (especially if you're tempted to grab a slice of pizza off another table!)

The photo of the chocolate pizza is what made me bookmark this location and give 
Tivoli Village another chance to impress, so we had to order that for dessert. Topped with Nutella, chocolate syrup, toasted almonds, dried cranberries, and whipped cream, it just needed a better base than the same flatbread used for every other pizza on the menu. The service was attentive and very friendly, so I won't hesitate to give four stars to the Pizza Lounge, and a special thanks to the young man (appeared to be a manager) who offered to store our baby stroller inside the restaurant while we enjoyed our meal.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,13,9,4,GSq4zi0bj51sgwdC2EILBA

I'm a huge fan of the Veggie Delight (hold the mushrooms), and have ordered it a bunch of times.  The ingredients are fresh and high quality and they don't overcook the vegetables, so they still taste like vegetables.  

Also, this is right next to the newly renovated playground at Tivoli Village, so it's very convenient to let the kids go play while the food is being prepared.

Most happy hours end at 6 around town, so the extra hour until 7 is nice. 

We split a California pepperoni and sun dried tomato goat cheese pizza. I paired mine with a Deschutes IPA and my wife had a great Pinto Gris. The pizzas come in a rounded rectangle shape. The crust was thinner, which we like and the sauce was really tasty. Especially the plumb red sauce. The goat cheese pizza had a white sauce which was pretty great too.

Well designed not only for aesthetics, but functionality.  The low glass back to the bar makes the kitchen noise almost unnoticeable.  The lighting is beautifully done, settings inside and on two outside areas are great for conversation.

The music on one visit was sophisticated background theme, went well with decor and ambiance.  Another time it was sappy 1970's love songs turned up to a.m.-radio-at-the-lake levels.  When we asked to change the music, they put on something like Deadmou5, and we thought we were supposed to jump up and down by a hotel pool.  We finally got them to at least turn that down.  They were willing, but didn't actually know how.  

The place seems very well thought out as to design and menu, but understaffed and undertrained on the wait side.  One inexperienced waitstaffer served us regular pasta as gluten free.  It's nice that they offer a gluten free pasta, but it defeats the purpose if the staff doesn't know the difference.  Thankfully we did, on sight, and sent it back.  They were very apologetic and picked up the tab for the gluten free pasta, which was shows some sophistication at the management level.  The server was new and she was doing her best but  seemed to need more backup.

3517325,2013-06-11,1,5YKsKS3nzdkwu37ORT9oiQ,"You would think that any restaurant that has the word ""pizza"" in its name would make a great pie, right? That's not the case here. It was average at best and I can think of at least five places off the top of my head that make a better one. 

Pizzas come in three different sizes: personal, 14"", and 18"". My kid and I tried a classic cheese pizza and a chicken pesto pizza. The personal size is a narrow and elongated flatbread shape. The cheese pizza wasn't bad, but the crust was just too thick. The chicken pesto had the same type of crust and was surprisingly bland considering all the toppings on it.

We also tried the gorgonzola and fig flatbread appetizer. The delicate and crispy crust was similar to a cracker crust. Topped with plenty of gorgonzola and fig, it made for a delicious app that was plenty big to share.

The flourless chocolate cake ended our meal. The dense cake had a raspberry spread between the cake and the icing/topping. It was another dish meant to be shared as its richness was too much for me to finish on my own.

They've got plenty of items on their menu so I'm sure I'll be back to try some. But chances are I'll skip the pizza.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,3,3,fTOLR0AIi1PAC1JM1X5dTw

Food is solid.  They have some weird sounding pizzas here, but they are delicious.  My favorites so far are the peach and gorgonzola pizza and the chipotle shrimp pizza.  The pizzas are fresh and made with quality ingredients.  The chipotle shrimp pizza had HUGE shrimp on it, not tiny litle bay shrimp.  That impressed me.

I think they're still ironing out some kinks.  They have a nice happy hour going for them, but when we ordered some things from it, the waitress had to come back twice to tell us she had given us wrong information about prices/selection.  No biggie to me, but it was just a bit disorganized and frazzled and I thought, ""FIX THIS!!""

It's tiny inside, but they have a lot of patio seating (always a PLUS in my book).  I'll be a frequent pizza eater and beer drinker here.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,3,0,4,rFbI2832tBdoPOaL4BUepw

4001678,2013-06-23,1,5YKsKS3nzdkwu37ORT9oiQ,"I visited the Pizza Lounge in April for a co-workers birthday lunch.  I thought it was really good, so much so that I told my wife I would take her.

We decided to go there last night, 6/22/2013 for dinner before our movie.  I ordered a glass of wine and she ordered a sparkling sangria (not on the menu but they were happy to make it for her).  I received my wine and the glass was filthy.  There were several chunks of hardened food, inside and outside of the glass.  I showed the glass to the waitress, and she agreed that it was bad and took it back (I did not even have to ask; I cannot remember the last time I sent something back to the preparers).  I watched as she told the bartender.  She walked away and when the sidebar was clear of the wait staff, the bartender looked at the glass, and then just poured the wine into a new glass.

Really?  If it was one little spot on the outside of the glass, I could maybe see doing that at my house to my own glass, but never a guests (I would be mortified if I served in a dirty glass).  But give me a break.  That glass was filthy and you just pour the wine into a new glass?  Thanks but I really do not want to get sick.

The waitress picked up the wine, and brought it over.  I told her what happened and that I wanted the check for the drinks, we were going to leave.  She apologized, asked me to hold on and went right to the manager.  She spoke with him and she came back and apoligized again.  They did not charge us for the drinks.  We left and the manager caught up to us outside and apologized again.

I beleive the watiress and manager did everything they could, but I had no confidence in anything coming from that bar, and honestly, I could not even eat there even though I did not experience a problem with the product from the kitchen.  It just creeped us both out.

The owner contacted me on Sunday June 24th and apologized.

I am going to give the Pizza Lounge another chance in the near future; the owner, manager, and waitress all demonstrated that they care which I appreciate.",FPEDwrWxK-CPjlgJM8r3fQ,4,1,3,AECi_OmkJhoDn_88EttxRA

Immediately, I was impressed with the large variety of beer and menu items. Lots of craft beer, cider, fruit beer etc. Excellent. I had the seasonal kronenburg. It was light, peachy, flavorful. Yum. 

The menu has loads of choices including apps, 15 salads, 30 pizzas, pastas and more. We are family style and shared a pear Gorgonzola spinach salad, Caesar salad, caprese pizza, meat lovers pizza and a peach, chicken and Gorgonzola pizza. Everything was delicious. Flavorful. Crust was crisp with a slight chew. Salads were big and great to share. Small complaint- salads were not dressed. Dressing was drizzled on top and we had to toss them at the table. What the heck? Just toss the salad. What's the point of sort of dressing it?

Pizza did take awhile. We didn't mind because we were drinking and enjoying the weather. But it did end up being a 2 hour lunch. 

The prices were surprisingly affordable. $7 for a glass of Chardonnay. $10 for a pizza or $20 for a giant pizza. I will definitely go back to enjoy another al Fresco afternoon with good beer and good pizza. 

Also, the pizza lounge is right next to the playground so you can pop over to entertain your little one while waiting.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,1,1,4,wMQRWKYyXjRR-Iy4D10LgA

We were greeted right away by the hostess who was really friendly. She was more than patient with us while we were trying to round up the other half of our party, who was too busy with the balloon animal guy. We ended up outside, the weather was gorgeous. My friend and I sat and right away our server came over to offer us drinks while we waited for the others. His name was Zack, he was very attentive and knew the menu well. We finally had everyone sitting at the table and we ordered a personal pepperoni pizza for the baby, while we all decided what we wanted. The pizza came and there was an issue with it, the server immediately came over and handled it. We didn't send it back because it wasn't that big of a deal, however the manager came over and said he did take it off the bill and was very apologetic.

We ordered a BBQ Chicken Salad, the medium Garlic Chicken and Feta Pizza  and the Pepperoni Breadsticks as an appetizer. It was more than enough food for the four of us. We ended up having salad and 4 pieces of pizza left over. The salad had the perfect amount of dressing, the pizza wasn't doused with cheese and sauce like most places and the Pepperoni Breadsticks were AMAZING. Everything we had was delicious, there wasn't one thing that I would have changed about any of the food. Aside from the small issue we had in the beginning, it was a good experience both food and service wise, I will definitely be going back.",2KXR93JrBu2FOjFIhy0QzA,1,0,4,gdz6Sv_j38OVw-sLv8QbbQ

We asked if we could sit there but she said another party that had just got there was going to sit there, Even though she knew we  wanted to be inside.  We  ended up sitting outside but didn't get any water or service for another 10 minutes when they tell us that the table inside opened up so we walk inside and wait another 5 minutes to see the server and bus boy arguing about who is giving us water cups. Just pathetic. We went ahead and ordered the meatballs and hummus as a appetizer, the pear and gorgonzola salad, and a large pizza for 4 people to share.

The restaurant interior is very nice, with flat screen TVs showing aquatic life. Good alternative to having and maintaining real aquariums, and pretty relaxing to watch too. 

We ordered a medium pizza, with half chicken pesto and half meat lover's. They were both good, but I liked the chicken pesto more because it was lighter and less greasy. A medium pizza is definitely a good size for 2-3 people. 

Also, they have fruli!! My favoritest strawberry beer in the world! 

Service wasn't too bad except for one thing that kinda annoyed me (and hence, minus 1 star).

pizzas:
chicken, peach, Gorgonzola pizza- this by far was the table winner. recommended by the waitress, this pizza was so RICH and SAVORY it didn't compare to the rest of the pizzas. don't get me wrong the other ones were good, but this one outshines it by the savoriness. WOULD DEF RECOMMEND TRYING

three mushroom pizza- portabella, shitake, and porcini mushrooms with garlic and mozzarella. not exciting. the least favorite  out of all the pizzas. there wasn't enough sauce or flavor in this pizza.

chicken pesto pizza- grilled chicken, mushrooms, onions, sun dried tomatoes, herbs in a pesto sauce. i would say this one was forgettable. I've tired other pesto pizzas that were way more flavorful. this one was OKAY. 

Pros: offers flat/ sparkling water. allows half and half pizza toppings. outdoor seating.

We had about an hour for dinner so we looked at the menu while waiting to be seated. Once we were seated it took our waitress a while to come over. She said sorry and took our order. Food and drinks. We split the Caesar Salad and Meatball Pizza.

The salad was barely okay. Tasted like store bought dressing. The lettuce wasn't chopped very well either. If you're looking for a great Caesar, go to Dom Demarcos or Vintner Grill. 

The pizza took FOREVER to come out. About 40 minutes. Our waitress kept telling us ""just a few more minutes"" every time she came to the table. Finally she came by and told us it would be ""four more minutes"" so we told her we actually needed to go soon so if she could bring a box out with it and the check that would be great. She got all panicky and told us if we were in a rush we should have told her and that the pizza oven was really backed up. We told her we weren't in a rush, but we didn't think it would take 40 minutes to get our pizza. And every time she came to our table she was apologizing and telling us we should have told her we were in a rush. It was kind of weird. Almost like she was blaming us for the slow service. 

The manager ended up bringing out our bill and apologized for the wait. He paid half of it and said he hoped we would come back. We would have if the pizza wasn't so horrible...

The crust wasn't very good. A little too thick for my taste. The sauce was really sweet. It tasted like it came right out of a jar. The meatballs had to have been store-bought, frozen meatballs. Everything about the pizza was just bad. It tasted fake almost. It was so weird. We had high hopes, but unfortunately, Pizza Lounge didn't deliver. My friend said she would have rather had a Red Baron Pepperoni Pizza from the freezer section and I couldn't agree more. 

The place has a great atmosphere and really nice staff. But at the end of the day, it's about the food. And this place definitely fell short.",Xl3z-QuX5IGNT2pdGldjkw,3,1,1,ez6Dbu4yLceeAm0oR_Sv6Q

I've been twice now for hh, and everything on the hh menu is a great value and delicious!  My personal favorite is the mini pizza duo.  The pizza flavors change daily depending on the specials of the day.  The last time we visited, one was a chipotle shrimp and the other was a caprese. 

When I first arrived at 4, the place was sparsely populated, but by 6:30 it was packed like sardines.  My only gripe is no bathroom.  It was cold the night we visited, and you have to walk outside to the Tivoli restroom facilities.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,4,1,5,vHx6itTgNTQ1ClM2_SHJ6A

The small cheese pizza was also not particularly good. The sauce was too sweet and the cheese was of low quality. Lastly, the pasta dish ordered was uninspired. They charged $4 for a few shrimp thrown on to the pasta. There is no way that we will return to this restaurant. Due Forni is MUCH better.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,2,oJvpd-fXn6k3988yJ7-xdw
