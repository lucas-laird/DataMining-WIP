Die junge Familie ist sooo stolz auf ihr neues Restaurant und das mit Recht. Authentische Küche mit interessanter Würzung. Eine nicht so große Karte deutet auf Frische und tagesaktuelle Zubereitung hin. 
Ein Tandoori-Ofen ist natürlich auch vorhanden. Das Lokal im Oberstock ist einfach, aber gemütlich eingerichtet. Indische Musik macht Atmosphäre. Uns hat das von der Inhaberin selbst entworfene Logo gleich angesprochen.

Herrlich das wunderbare Naan-Brot, auch die Vorspeisen kreativ. Es gibt täglich ein günstiges lunch Gericht, und Fleisch und Fisch nach indischer Rezeptur.  Insgesamt speist man hier preiswert. Auch die Desserts entbehren nicht einer kreativen Note. 

Viel Erfolg der jungen Familie! Und den Besuchern viele schöne Geschmacks Erlebnisse. Ja, und das mit den leuchtenden Augen stimmt auch!",M1PbFiAPdoE6P7RJIPa5GA,0,0,5,6DUmwRClM0WpO1Odcm75aQ

I saw some good reviews and stopped here for lunch. For lunch they have pre-fixe thali options, we tried the Chennai and Lucknow thali. Since this more of a South Indian restaurant, do highly recommend the chennai thali. Lucknow was good too but no match for the chennai thali. The chicken curry in the thali was really authentic, I live in New Jersey and there are very few places here too which have such authentic chettinad curry, not too spicy just perfect. We ordered extra breads which were fluffy and soft. We also tried their Lassi(flavored yogurt) and as in most Indian restaurants these days you have the mango lassi option , but they also have a strawberry option which was really good.",hFrx_x3x1QD8Gl7F3rOuMg,2,0,5,rcWFlYShbokUNwHixfMZuQ
133882,2017-05-27,0,5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q,"I am going to start by saying my husband I came here and we were very hungry and excited to try a new Indain place with great reviews. We tried so hard to give this place every chance and they just kept under delivering and showing us they did not care about the customers. With a total of twenty customers in the place and most who had food when we arrive we simply do not understand why the service was so bad.We arrived for lunch around 12:30 and left around 2 unsatisfied. 

Around 12 we arrive. It started out okay we sat down and the woman set our flatware and water glasses. She brought out a carafe of water and our menus and left. No red flags yet.

About 5 minutes later she came back and got our drink order of a mango lassi and chai tea. We got those around 15 minutes later and she left. Did not even ask us if were ready to order. (red flag 1) So we flagged her down a couple of times and she kept pushing us off. (red flag 2  and 3) She kept telling us she would be by soon but she never got close to our table. Around 30 minutes later she comes by to take our order of two Kashmir Thalis.  

Around 15 minutes after we finally ordered we got our cold food and no naan. The naan took 5 minutes extra to come out room temperature.  Not 1 dish was hot or even warm. The Chicken Tika and Lamb Rogan Josh are typically hot or at least warm. Not here they are both room temperature and salty.  The greasy cabbage? dish was also room temperature. Rice was room temperature. The Ratia was cold which is normal. The Halwa was also cold but 90% water and 10% rice. I did not realize Halwa meant watered down rice pudding but at Indian Curry House that is what you get.

Despite all this we were both hungry as we skipped breakfast and we still could not find enjoyment here . So we ate enough to tide us over until dinner.

After we finished eating we sat for awhile and since the waitress never came to our table we walked to the front to pay. She was in a phone call taking an order which took another 5 minutes. I am not upset about this because someone has to answer the phones. I am only upset about bad service and cold food. The bill was 28.12$ before a tip which was smaller than my standard 15-25%. 

We wont be back and we recommend any of the various Indian places in town over this place. You can get better food and service at any of them

On the bright side we are going to have lunch at a great Indian buffet tomorrow which always has hot food and good service.",Kr8GVDf5UupHTozB0em_fg,1,0,1,PjYp5JUgEMLfIjPB1xGM0w

We tried yet again to come and it was probably the worst experience at an Indian restaurant. There was no one there but us and their buffet menu is no buffet, you still order from a lunch menu for their ""buffet style"" lunch orders. We sat and ordered our food and it was cold, with very little food in each bowl in the platter. Maybe one or two pieces of meat. The rice was terrible and had zero flavor. We never heard dishes clanking or any type of indication that the food was being made fresh. It all tasted like frozen prepped Indian food.  They didn't even offer us a drink besides tap water in a glass. I told the lady serving us that it was cold and all she said was don't eat it. Then she went in the back and started gossiping about us in her language to another worker. We paid for the food and left very hungry because we couldn't even eat it.

Kashmir thali had chicken curry, lamb rogan josh, rice, Roti, raita, papad and seasonal veg. Not a bad deal for $10.50. We also tried dosa and veg biryani both were ok. Masala lacked salt, dosa is not crispy and chutney is very runny and very tiny portion.

The woman who works here is rude and hostile, and actively lies to customers and Eat24 staff. All low reviews have poor service in common. Come at your own risk.

FIRST VISIT: Placed appetizer order via Eat24, notified order would take 45 minutes. Arrived after 30 minutes and female cashier flipped out on me, rudely stating there was no way it would be ready within an hour. When I clarified that I'd only ordered an appetizer, she went off on a rant about the ovens. The cook silently brought my order out from the kitchen literally five minutes later, cashier and an apology were nowhere to be found. Tandoori wings were good but samosas were the tiny frozen variety from the grocery rather than the larger ones I expect at restaurants.

SECOND VISIT: This was a wash, because I placed an online order for pickup again only to get texts from Eat24 about how my order wasn't available. I guess it happens sometimes, but I ordered the most basic of Indian dishes, saag paneer. There's a grocery store literally in your parking lot. How does this happen? Strike 2. 

THIRD ATTEMPT: Placed an order for mutton biryani. Came in to pick up, same woman said she didn't confirm the order with Eat24, handed me their lunch menu and said I could order now. When I asked about my order, she said it's not her problem and to call Eat24. I asked why she chose not to fill my order knowing I'd be coming in to pick up food and get nothing, essentially wasting my time. She then backtracked and said she didn't know I had placed an order, she was just guessing. She was talking over me and interrupting as I tried to work this out, extremely unprofessional. It seems they're regularly refusing to fill Eat24 orders over some beef with the company. Not my problem, but after wasting my time twice, I will never be back.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,3,1,NAKgL2pljZoU8p0w3tJeMA

We had the samosa chat as an appetizer and both with a bit of embarrassment said the same thing to each other, which is we could lick the bowl.  All the other appetizer dishes looked good as well and will be tried on the next visits.

The Paneer and Vegetable Skewer was also tasty and with a good portion, not over the top.

Lastly, we had the Classic Chicken Curry which was also a perfect portion, good texture, and mix of flavors.

Some may argue for more choices, but it seems quantity in portion size and menu offerings sometimes overshadows quality.  The menu here is not cluttered, simple to choose from, and seems to stress the quality of each dish.",qlU83VEwgHd8RXkIn-VSkQ,3,1,5,0BQG0vVcLd_vhUe_z_oytQ

2045487,2017-05-15,1,5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q,"We stumbled upon the Indian Curry House by accident recently. We had  gone to another Indian restaurant that we discovered is now closed, so we were headed to an established restaurant in the Pacific Asian Plaza. Upon pulling into the area, we saw the sign for this new place, so we gave it a try. Glad we did! As others have said, if you want FLAVOR, come here! 
We started with the chickpea fritters, and they came out hot & crispy, with a plate of delectable dipping sauces. Make sure you keep those sauces to dip your naan into later! My husband ordered classic chicken curry with  heat of 6, and it was pleasantly tingly without being overpowering. The rice it came with was super fluffy and fresh (this makes a difference...you know how some places serve clumpy or dry rice that's barely edible!). I am not a big fan of turmeric, so I ordered grilled paneer in a sauce that reminded me of Butter Chicken sauce...it was sooooo fragrant with ginger, coriander and other lovely scents. I ordered it with a heat of 4, which was just enough to know the heat was there. Mine came with naan, which was the best we've had! We got piggy and ordered more naan, and a dish of raita so we could try that...later we found that we weren't charged for the extra bread or the raita that we requested! 
This family really know how to let their spices bloom...everything was just bursting with scent and flavor. (I am an impatient cook, and my curries sometimes have a ""dusty"" texture from not letting the spices blend long enough. At Curry House, their sauces are soooo smooth.) We even found room for a dish of kheer (rice pudding), which was perfectly flavored with cardamom, just sweet enough, and very cold--which is how it tastes best, in my opinion (although my Indian college room-mate always gobbled most of hers before it cooled down, ha!) My husband and I were in a state of pleasant shock, knowing we had just discovered a gem.
I cannot finish without mentioning the friendly service. The only advice I have to this family business: some Indian music playing softly in the background would enhance the experience ;-)
I wish them luck...please support this family restaurant...your tastebuds will thank you!!",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,1,2,5,gl_5acCuAO4iDuIz_PWeTA

Located in Chinatown, in the plaza of SF Chinese Supermarket (they are on the second floor). Tips: better to park on the second floor and walk right to the restaurant so you don't have to take the stairs. 

What I love about this place is they are not a buffet, unlike other Indian lunch. They prepare the food as you order it so there is no waste, or all day re-heated food. Healthy portion and if you need more, you can always for more bread (naan) or basmati rice. 

We were here for lunch. On the side note, they open for lunch from 11-3 and open for dinner from 5-10. They close from 3-5 for dinner prep. 

They have five combo of lunch specials! Two of them are Vegetarian options (one of the two is Gluten Free option). I ordered the combo with the chicken curry. The spicy level was spot on. Lunch combo comes with naan bread and papad (crispy, grain and gluten free bread). Delicious, crispy and tasty! It also comes with vegetable of the day. Today they had a spicy green beans with onions and lentil. Yumm. The desert that comes with the lunch combo changes everyday. Today I had Gulan Jamun (a berry sized milk ball dunked in sugar syrup). 

Price is reasonable. Lunch combo starts at $9. It is plenty of food for the price. 

Place is a bit small and sometimes the service can be slow during busy day. Today I had a great service since it was not busy.

When I sat down , I was approached by a very nice lady who took her time and made some suggestions and answered my questions as I like Indian food but I am not familiar with some of the dishes and accompaniments. I decided to have the chicken briyani and the lady asked about my preferences in regard to spiciness . I told her that I wasn't sure as many places have different ideas what spicy is. She also said she would bring me a side of yogurt to tone down the curry sauce if it was a little too spicy for me .The food came and it was a large portion for what I thought was a reasonable price. The rice had a good texture with some nice pieces of chicken and some onion with chicken curry sauce on the side It was a little spicy but delicious and it turned out I didn't need the yogurt to tone it down. It was just right. I will be making more trips to Indian Curry House.

1. While I ordered using Eat24 - the restaurant seemed to cancel that order and instead insisted on a ""cash"" transaction. It seemed unethical. When asked they said ""oh that's for promotion "". 
2. The restaurant was completely empty - another big concern. 
3. The food was far below par:
A/ paneer tikka had 4 tiny pieces, and to our surprise, a small piece of chicken. It seems that the cook scooped out the chicken and added a few paneer pieces. I think it is a cause of concern, specially since vegetarian folks may have certain expectations. We are not vegetarian however. 
B/ the Chennai goat curry was inedible because the meat was tough. 
C/ even the gulab jamun was hard and extra sweet. 
D/ the rice ""Kheer"" was bland and we did not touch one of the 2 we had.

1. Walked in the front door. Nobody came to greet and seat me after waiting for a few minutes. I walked to the front counter and said ""1"". They seated me at a dirty table. The lady brought the menu and water to me but I asked her to first clean the table.
2. I ordered the vegetable curry bowl. The waitress said that only a small bowl of rice comes with it and asked if I wanted naan. I like naan and as a first-timer at this place I thought I would try it.
3. Food came out - surprise - small curry bowl compared to the price. Yes, the rice bowl was small. 
4. Naan was okay - not great and not bad.
5. At first I thought the curry was tasty but after a while I was greeted by a constant salty taste. Too much salt? 
6. Now the FUN part begins.
A. I had to ask the inattentive waitress to bring my check.
B. I handed my credit card to her and she took it to the counter.
C. She soon came back and mumbled something that they cannot accept my business Visa card because the service fee is too high and asked me for a debit card or another card. I told her ""no, that is my only card"". See did not seem to care and I did not want to cause a commotion so I paid by cash.
D. My change came - intentionally she gave me a stack of singles expecting it would make it easier to give her a tip.
E. NO TIP! If your policy is to reject my Visa card upon payment because it is a business type and the service fee is too high then my policy is ZERO tip!

My usual Indian go-to is (or was) the Mount Everest buffet on Valley View & Sahara, but I think Indian Curry House tops that, even if it isn't buffet. My party of 5 arrived at lunch time and we were a little surprised that it was empty. We sat down in a booth that only sat 4 people but I was okay being the 5th person at the edge. They were very polite and accommodating and offered to pull up a table next to the booth, but I kindly refused. 

The lunch menu is simple, offering 3 different combinations. Each comes with 2 main courses and 3 sides/desserts. If you're feeling adventurous, go with the one that comes with lamb. I generally don't like lamb because of its gaminess, but they cook it well here.

When the food came out, which took just a little longer than expected considering we were the only people there, it seemed like it wasn't enough to fill me up. Boy was I wrong! The naan bread really helped. The chicken masala was the best I ever had and the side salads worked well with the other dishes. I also tried the mango drink, but it was super sweet. It was like mango yogurt with extra sugar.

I was still standing outside after the posted opening time, with no end of their puttering around in sight.  I understand that sometimes small businesses like this have late starts, but even so they need to learn that they can't let customers simply stand outside waiting for the place to finally open.  Again, I saw no sense of urgency from either of these two gentlemen to get caught up with whatever caused their late start.
