The food is great and this Lone Star is very consistent in its quality. I order my steaks medium-rare and they're always cooked to the exact same standard.

For appetizers their Lone Star skins are amazing. Crispy with soft starchy potato and cheese, just perfect. The Taste of Texas sampler is a pretty big plate and has Lone Star Skins, Buffalo Chicken Tenders and Onion Rings. 
The Texas Rose is a huge onion  cut and deep fried like a rose. It is very heavy and while it might look good it's sheer size and greasiness only make it viable for parties of 6+ people.

Their salads are nothing extraordinary but their ranch dressing is perfect: tangy and creamy, I wish I could buy it in the grocery store!

 The steaks themselves are quite tasty and very juicy. I wasn't very impressed with the Porterhouse, It is a big steak but wasn't as tasty as I expected. It does fill you up though and you can't go wrong with it.

My top 3 choices are:

San Antonio sirloin for a relatively lean steak

Peppercorn Ribeye has an amazing sauce and the ribeye itself is very tasty

Five Star Filler mignon: probably the leanest cut they have, this is very tender and juicy.

You get to order 2 side dishes with your steak. Most of them are excellent.

With steak I always get the baked sweet potato with cinnamon-sugar and butter, it is a divine combination and i highly recommend it,  in fact I always have this with my steak!, Simple: YOU MUST HAVE IT!.

The lettuce wedge is a nice addition too, it has just the right amount of blue cheese  in the dressing to spice up the letttuce.

Creamed Spinach was somewhat bitter when I ordered it. I'd prefer it ""creamier"".

The mashed potatoes are lacking in taste somehow, they don't have that starchy creamy taste. Make sure you get it with bacon and cheese, makes a huge difference.

For dessert, the big brownie they have is extremely indulgent, it is a big size, easily feeds 3 people (maybe more) and the classic combination of the hot moist brownie with the cold ice cream makes this dessert the highlight of your Lone Star experience.

Every time the service has been amazing, when I go to Lone Star I usually have a certain server who has proved to be the most friendly and attentive I have seen in the valley so far. I'm not sure if Yelp allows to write a server's name so I can't mention who he is. Definitely A+ for service.

Overall a traditional steakhouse with good quality and consistent food, great service and decent prices. How can you go wrong?",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,2,2,5,Qxy-milaP5yeTubYUIT0Gg

When we walked in the hostess smiled at us, but instead of greeting us reached to pick up the phone. The food was mediocre if that. I had a sorry excuse for tenderloins wrapped in bacon, and one of the steak fries on my plate had a big black spot...they couldn't have just thrown that one out? I'd been to this location a couple years ago and I remember everything being much better. What happened???",Gv_-mtOKhWFtCjn9xFe0SQ,1,1,2,WuiYOIrW68Amx5bdRyVa1w

Great salad and bread and the steaks are a good size and pretty tasty.  Not a huge selection of beer though.  You get alot of food for a pretty good price, you'll definately be full after you leave, not sure why they even have a dessert menu.",27acvVAW1hlaXHF92IXUOA,0,0,4,5l3G0SlH24Rg7_raFuCUnw

When we arrived at 8pm it was DEAD-on a Friday Night-so sad:(

Service was fast & friendly, 

I love the hot bread loaf & butter they bring out so we didnt need any appetizer instead we had salads -a house & a wedge.

We then ordered Entrees

Delmonico 10ox Ribeye with Salted Baked Potato
Texas Melt hamburger with grilled onions on Ciabata bun

The steak was fantastic -cooked perfect-fat trimmed and the baked potato was great too SALTED with LOTS of butter,sour cream & chives!!

The Texas Melt  burger was a completely different experience. The burger was from a frozen patty the cheese wasn't melted at all because the grilled onions were soggy & cold PLUS the bun wasn't grilled/toasted either.

I still gave it 4 stars for being FREE but its NOT likely this place with be open next year on my birthday!!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,5,4,4,qx1xUZNk02SuVoXEmn59ew

The wait staff was extra friendly (could be that famous Texas hospitality)

The portions were Texas sized. I suggest trying instead of mashed potato/baked potato - try the Sweet Potato. It was amazing and much healthier for you than that of the white potatoe...but Try this place - it is just east of the Vegas strip. 

Beats sitting at a noisey high price strip restuarant having to put up with sloppy drunks and cigaret smoke.  ENJOY!!!",ad7F8ebMU33i4cOHNff4mw,0,1,5,qofvqT3l24mtaTYWIw_q4Q
