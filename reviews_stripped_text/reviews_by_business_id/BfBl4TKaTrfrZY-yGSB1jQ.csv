My friend and I sat at the counter, and it took a minute to order since the waiters were in the middle of dancing! And even with my starvation, I was able to be amused enough by their rendition of Stayin' Alive to wait. When you sit here to eat you get lunch AND a show!

The main reason I love Johnny Rockets is because they are totally vegan friendly. I got the Streamliner with a Boca patty, and I added grilled mushrooms. SO tasty! Definitely hit the spot. I love that you can substitute whole what buns and Boca patties for any of the burgers. My friend had an egg salad sandwich with a side salad, and she raved about the egg sandwich.

This location is in the Meadows Mall. I purchased a $6 for $12 groupon which ended up making me feel better because I wouldn't pay regular price...ever.

The menu at this location is limited so don't expect the regular JR menu if you want to eat at this one. I ordered a rocket double without lettuce or tomato and fries. I really enjoyed my burger and fries. They were both made fresh to order. My total was $12.92 for just the burger and fries, no drink.

Maybe at wolf gang pucks restaurant. Will never be going back here again. Over priced ridiculousness and it wasnt even good food. How do you charge that amount of money and then still give your guest a buzzer to pick your food up at the counter when your already sitting down. Your corporate needs to get it together and realize most people go out to dinner and pay that and want to actually be waited on. And includes a tip but when no one brings refills or food a tip isn't left. Unfortunately corporate is ruining there employees getting extra money.

I ordered chicken tenders from a woman who seemed to not like her job very much. She wasn't very pleasant at all. After ordering, I sat at the counter to wait for my meal. Several employees walked past me, without acknowledging me at all. When my food was delivered, I didn't receive napkins. The employees were again, zooming past me until one nice gentleman asked if I needed anything. He provided me with napkins, and I asked for the supervisor. Turns out the supervisor was the woman who took my order. She apologizes for the lack of service and I'm guessing warned her staff to acknowledge me. After my encounter with her, nearly every employee spoke to me. 

The chicken tender were good, hot and fresh. They are a bit pricey at $7, and you don't get fries. I probably wouldn't order them again, just because of the price and my experience. If you have the Groupon, it might be worth. Get it to go though.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,4,2,2,6AdbJw8Pc6yj5UKP7d-Aaw

Pretty awesome deal, but not convincing enough to make me give this place anymore than 2 stars.

In the past when I've gone to Johnny Rockets, I wasn't in love with the burgers, but I still thought they were very good. When we got our food today, it looked and tasted like they really downgraded their quality. Look how boring and lifeless my Route 66 burger looked: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ewjc4OdQ5_ENVV5dUtoN_g/l.jpg. The buns looked like they were kind of smashed and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese inside (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6EO2CMyCBaEiSAYIMjGHjg/l.jpg). The only thing I really liked about my burger were the fresh mushrooms inside. Majority of the fries that came with our meals were undercooked or soggy.

We sat down and we're approached by Jesus for a drink order, as I'd just sat down and hadn't looked at the menu I asked for a moment, not even 30 seconds later he's back, still hadn't opened the menu!  After a few mins he came back, we ordered the tater tot nacho things, Chicken bacon sandwich and sliders.  Tot dish was disappointing to say the least, picture showed fresh guacamole, chopped tomatoes and crispy tots, reality was soggy tots, mushed tomatoes and guacamole that looked brownish and came from a tube, too many jalapeños and cheese sauce, didn't eat half of it.  Moved to burger and after bite or two realized no bacon in my bacon chicken sandwich, could not get Jesus attention so waited several minutes for someone else to notice me and come over.  He asked if I just wanted to wait a few minutes for them to cook some bacon, ah no I said I'd prefer it was just recooked for me.  Took few minutes for new burger, came out juicy and fresh.  Sliders were nice.  
Personally we did not enjoy the service from Jesus, I prefer a server that's more genuine and authentic and does not linger too long, also it bothers me scooping ice to the rim then adding a squirt of soda, few sips and it's gone.

Banana milkshake was thick with chunks of bananas and I love that. Plus the fact they had a veggie burger there for me to eat was a huge plus.


Only negative thing is the burgers don't come with fries. He asked if fries were ok with my burger. I assumed like any normal place the fries would come with the meal. Well me and my partner were charged for tots and fries. If I knew they didn't come with them I wouldn't have gotten them because they aren't the best to start with. So an extra 9$+ on our check wasn't appreciated. You should let them know it doesn't actually come with the burger and they will be charged. Never been to a place that does that and not tell their guests. Been here three years and this is the only place I've been to where fries aren't included....

I'm not a meat & potatoes girl (more like chicken, fish, turkey, and produce), but when I want a burger, only a few places come to mind immediately (red robin, islands, omelet house). This is one of them. 

Been to the paradise location many times, but this was a first at the meadows mall. The atmosphere is a little different, since it's on the edge of the Food Court, upper level. The three people working there (in 1950s uniform and hats) were really nice, attentive. The decor is 1950s  (just like the others) and the seating options are (1) on the stools/bar surrounding the semi-open kitchen (2) order for takeout (the line for this option, is on the right), sit elsewhere in the food court (tables & chairs- which means, more room). We didn't have to worry about the stroller being in the way because we were on one side of the restaurant. 

We all ordered burgers and then when we saw one person in our party's milkshake, we all ended up ordering one too! The burgers are really good, juicy, and not greasy (not messy on your hands, yuck). Here, the fries come with the burger (at the paradise one, the fries are ala carte), so my husband said that the prices even out. 

This is one of the newer locations, so the place is spotless. (The one at the Fashion Show Mall opened up before this one.) 

A dependable spot for burgers & shakes. It might be a little pricey compared to the other eateries in the mall, but I've been to a few of those places (meh, alright, so/so), and paying the extra $ is worth it.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,4,1,4,LbxzdV3vsZvaD7V27jcJAw
4346099,2014-01-31,1,BfBl4TKaTrfrZY-yGSB1jQ,"I tried their Chicken Club with sweet potato fries and it wasn't bad at all, just can't say it was really good. The chicken was grilled, which I prefer rather than fried and the bacon was crispy. I got it on rye bread. Being able to have it made the way you  like it is nice, but the sandwich had 3 pieces of bread which I think is unnecessary. Why not just top the chicken with bacon and lettuce rather than squeezing a piece of bread in between? Sweet potato fries was super soggy by the time I got to work so I was a little disappointed, I'm pretty sure it would be amazing if I had it right away. 
Service was good, my food was made pretty fast and the lovely lady was very friendly and polite. 
The counter was very clean but it way of been because I was there around 11am on a weekday. It may be more packed and crazy over the weekend or in the afternoons, being that it's a mall.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,1,0,3,2KfZsFZnruGWo2BAIjaO6w

What a great idea.An actual diner in the food court here.

 It has that Great 50's greasy spoon feel & taste. 100% authentic.

They also have a counter to eat at, they all wear the traditional uniform and have the jukeboxes at the counter too. 5 cents per song!!

I love their burgers/oozing grease-ask for it well done to get the crispy edges/, also the shakes & malts and  The wings are great too.

Such a great upgrade from McDonald's here in the mall.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,4,5,5,KEonBXnoJalsMO0YcSO3Fg

Although being hungry I stumble upon a know classic burger joint Johhny Rockets. Not only did Esther take care of me and my friend. She made the experience of something that could have gone wrong into something that she made totally right. I ordered my meal and upon arrival I tried it and noticed my fries were not ""fresh"" or ""warm"". Esther not only did not charge me for the fries but took care of removing them and my beverage off the bill and just charged me my burger. She totally made it right because of my concern and that is something very admirable from a consumer point of view. Thank you again Esther and I let Diana know how I felt with your great service.",7F-A7IHzBeqAlmLai9S9Sg,0,0,5,f6U_r-yMvzUAnvjJaUxEjA

4658038,2013-12-17,0,BfBl4TKaTrfrZY-yGSB1jQ,"I had the Smoke House, which is smoked bacon, onion rings, cheddar cheese, and BBQ-ranch sauce. Patties are 1/3 pound. I probably didn't need to have the double for lunch, but oh well. $10.95 for the single is a rip off, so I went with the double for $12.95, which was still pricey, but less of a rip off. Both come with fries. Even soda was pricey. $2.95 for a regular soda is ridiculous.

Using a Groupon only makes eating here fair in price. Don't expect it to be a deal. In fairness, the food was good. It's on par with a burger you would get at a diner, even though this is a chain.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,1,0,3,dOH_M_u6SK_7BgbcHjyF6g
4891693,2015-12-30,5,BfBl4TKaTrfrZY-yGSB1jQ,"I'm so WOWed!!! I'm not one to frequent a diner type of joint but we didn't really like anything else the meadows mall food court had to offer so we decided on something new to us. What a great decision! 
We sat at the counter and our AMAZING waitress came over and took our orders. She warned us that it was going to take about 25 minutes for our orders to be ready but we knew how busy it was (the day after Christmas) and we were just fine with that. 
     For a Food Court restaurant they definitely tried to keep that counter dining experience...I liked a lot! But I just felt like I was too far away from hubs and daughter we could barely hear each other. Expect 50s/60s decor and nickel jukebox menus at the counter...not sure if they worked cause I don't normally carry cash or change on me but it would be so awesome if it does! 
      We waited and observed the staff...it looked like they were short staffed by at least 2 people. I saw the bit of frustration and fluster from the ladies but when it came to serving the patrons they ALWAYS kept a cool calm demeanor!!! Our server always checked in on us to make sure we were ok and always with a smile like we were her only customers! Now THAT is amazing customer service! 
      I ordered the smokehouse burger with half and half onion rings/fries...the burger was ridiculously juicy and the onion rings were perfection!!!! Heaven in a burger it was!!!! We scarfed those things down and it was so worth a $45 tab for the three of us...not like the disappointment we had at The other food court experience we had...I'm still a little bitter about that pathetic sized drink. 
     Well the burgers are AMAZING! And service is AMAZING!!! This is the place to chose out of all the restaurants at this food court! 
     P.S...they no longer have a tip line on their bill due to the new chip thing in cards...so make sure you bring some cash if you plan on letting these amazing people serve you! We were so sad we couldn't tip via card we went ahead and found an ATM and returned back to the restaurant to give our waitress $20 tip...she was worth the $3.99 ATM fee! My daughter says it was the right thing to do and she walked away with a ""fluffy feeling"" in her heart! We could have easily just left and not tipped, even the server was ok with that...but AMAZING service deserves to be rewarded! I wish I could remember her name I hope she reads this and know how much we truly appreciate her kindness! So be good to your server, eat good, bring some cash and tip well!",_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ,7,8,5,ljWkzgtxfPjdKUcOZ9Ovsw

The fries were okay but I preferred the cheese fries. They have pepsi products which I prefer coke products. Paid over $20 bucks for 2 meals and wasn't satisfied for what I paid. The gentleman at the counter was friendly so no complaints there. Overall I wasnt thrilled and it wasnt terrible.,eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,0,0,3,YPWn8gV44kGHhOhj4W38nA

We tried to keep it near the $12 Groupon which was very difficult as the prices aren't cheap.  Ended up splitting a single burger, fry and large drink and still went over a buck ad a half.  Burger was very good, not overlooked.  Fries were o.k., a tad limp.  Free refill on the drink was nice. Lot's of competition out there in this price range, or cheaper.  Probably won't go back unless we can snag another Groupon.",a-02Rln64uUTXQKdc2dt4g,0,0,3,RJqKZ8DYAsPZH9TpMZ3FIA

I could've gave the oil to chicken now in the mall next to this place to fry their chicken with. I don't get how people who live here think this is good when u can go to the strip and get steak for the same price. Way too expensive and disgusting quality.

Poor guy running register sweating and doing his best to keep up.  
One more guy just showed up did check one half of counter to see if had been helped yet but bypassed the other half after clocking in or back in. Hopefully things speed up a bit. Others walking away from ordering because the line. 
Food arrived about 5 min after I got my float and it was as expected. Seems rush is over or it was break time when I arrived. Guy apologized for not being able to hit chat, which makes this an ok visit. I understand he was busy.",H5Asta4LpiKmRhSjWaogIg,1,0,3,DxshuNznyo7v6uhuCnhoXw

5918665,2014-12-23,2,BfBl4TKaTrfrZY-yGSB1jQ,"The phone number listed on their Yelp page and on their official website for this Meadows Mall location is in fact used for their fax machine. So good luck trying to reach a live person over the phone to see what time they close.  (I had to check the business hour of Meadows Mall for that day to avoid arriving after the mall has already been locked up for the day.)

But as far as the guest experience goes at this location compared to the other Las Vegas Johnny Rockets locations I have tried thus far, it is light years better.  Maybe it is the way this particular location is setup, with counters you sit at and orders taken right there, instead of a walk-up counter at all the other fast food restaurants where you place your order and come back later to pick up your order. Of course if you are placing a to go order, the cash register is ideally the spot to head to to initiate this transaction.  So if you have a choice between the various locations throughout LV, and this location is not much further away, then by all means come here!

Even though I have read somewhere that the menu is limited here, and I do believe that to be the case (based on what I can remember seeing on their burger menu vs the full burger menu I found on their official website), I still usually just go for their Smoke House Single or Double and their Hershey's® Chocolate Malt.  So limited menu or not, what I want is still available, thus made no difference to me whatsoever.  And the order came out quickly, so I was only able to distract myself on Clash of Clans and Snapchat for a minute.

On my most recent visit here, during the Christmas shopping period, the mall was bustling and there were only a handful of open seats at the JR counter.  So this place can get busy.  But the young man who took my order was on point, and the entire crew handled the holiday rush like badasses.

The price point is the only downer for JR.  Which is the main reason I don't stop by here half as often as the number of times I shop at Meadows Mall.  Groupon promotions are good, but might as well share some of that marketing dollars that Groupon receives and lower the price for all their customers.

Anyway. Decent burgers, good shakes/malts and efficient friendly crew at this Johnny Rockets.  I would come back in the future. Just not sure how soon that would be.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,2,4,3,Kx1eSXBOIz-zkQkHAzR_dw
