I was craving Italian that day and lucky me they had it at the food court.. this place is like a Sbarros, but I think its better.. my favorite is Chicken Parmesan and they actually had it!! Altho I didn't get it, last minute I changed my mind and got the Baked Ziti.. it was pretty good.. nice portion and it came with a big side of garlic bread.. yummy..for only 6.75? I think thats def worth it!! They also had lasagna, and your assortment of pizza, and stromboli, a friend of ours ordered.. was pretty big..Good food, and good prices.. they take card..you should def. give this place a try.. My money was well spent...",GKAYdhI2W8ueicaUZtCYgw,1,1,5,-Kr85bq6fhkid0-HPCrP4Q
1242310,2011-12-16,1,nRNWaEuPtfcyR8pI-LnASA,Not terribly horrible for food court standard. A slice of pizza fresh out of the oven was actually decent. Sure beat some of the greasy oily pseudo Asian food.,41HLwXnR0Lm3NUp01cIOQg,1,1,3,Enl-rbnPE96zhA8b4BBzig

The workers are very hard working, and very efficient.  Their pizza was good, although they could be a little less stingy with the toppings, and the prices were not that bad.  I also ordered a salad, which had little itty bity bits of chicken (which was okay with me cause i didn't really want it for the chicken) but they had feta on it...and it was actually good feta, not too salty.  So that was a plus.  I would order here again.",XAHW6O7Ti-03vBIP0dUW_g,0,0,3,r4ujQgZjQAxSmDA2Q5_fEg

I got a slice of the veggie which came stacked high with broccoli (I know, broccoli on a pizza!! :D), tomatoes, black olives and cheese. Because the fresh ingredients had been sitting there for so long that they had to re-heat my piece before serving it to me, the crust was completely soggy, I had to attempt to eat it with a fork and knife. The flavors worked nicely, but the texture was all off. My husband got a slice of pepperoni and was happy with it, but he would eat anything shy of cardboard. 

The beautiful garlic bread was quite intriguing, maybe we'll give it a try next time around, but I won't spring for a slice again.",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,0,0,2,KZdcWzZZYMy0gAVYGfujUw
