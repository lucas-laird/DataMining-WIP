'ho-hum', if you will. Not terrible at all, just nothing special. Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy-schmancy experience. I recommend on those terms. Good price.",IduEiOzDSIMlAGnOMPfSvw,1,1,2,3DkfkxiyqtZtaKlJGlyw2A

The food was gross, the service was slow, and it was the worst 25 dollars my bf and I have had the misfortune of spending on food. Seriously, we barely ate anything and when we asked to speak to a manager, he offered to comp our sodas... that's it. 

Worthy of a health department inspection.",mySDXsBhY3u0yI-G2oVDkA,0,0,1,BmazDfgjIKGZH4hnJ49zAg
