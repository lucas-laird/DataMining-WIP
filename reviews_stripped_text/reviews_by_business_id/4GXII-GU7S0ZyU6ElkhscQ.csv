7037,2011-04-14,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a bachelor's party, and Hooters is where they guys wanted to stay. Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. 

My feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. 

I'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings.",9QrE24JaemD3TLFihmTKxg,2,0,2,BVLnZXjkUFyEoXnnVJjBbQ

I stayed at hooters on Dec 7th my rooms were bought through groupon. after the trip we discovered hooters had charged my account for the rooms with out my autherization. Contacted hooters, after 12 hours of bs phone calls we finally get a manager on the phone named ""H"". She was very rude and unconcerned and basically said call groupon they messed up. No YOU ×_×^!&@&$ up you ass. Long story short after fraudulent charges have been reported to my bank they did it again today it's been almost a whole month sense I've been in vegas. I assure you don't stay here spend the extra 5 dollars and go somewhere else. These people ALL of them will ruin your trip.

We have stayed there in the past that is why we booked there again.  We won't be going back there ever again.  The hotel room was so run down.  Beds were horrible with a big dip in the middle of each bed.  Our sinks were clogged had to call maintenance.   Water pressure well there wasn't any.   You couldn't get wet if you tried.  My son is 24 and was not impressed.   He said he wouldn't even stay there again.  Not sure what has happened to the hotel in the past couple of years but obviously the hotel owners aren't interested in fixing up the place.  I gave it 2 stars for the somewhat convenient location and the wings were excellent.

Then she laughed at us for being upset. Her name is Imelda. She offered to take off one day of resort fees ($15) and asked if that made us happy. Obviously no was t my answer so she remarked back, still chuckling, ok then I won't do anything. Unacceptable service. Unacceptable to laugh at your guests. I told her all of this and she finally explained I could call the company since the moves are all managed by a 3rd party and they would most likely refund me. It's a hassle to have to do this but she could have told me this before she started laughing at us.

Apparently though, for this place, the type of salad was unnecessarily ""high class"" with its actual greenery, but I liked it - I always like a better salad than just romaine. 

But Hooters gave us live entertainment in the form of  a cover band and boobs. What else do you really go there for? I ordered chicken wings (which were good, though I couldn't finish them), whereas chicken sandwiches and Caesar salads were the other main courses for my friends, and there weren't any complaints to be had. 

I go to any Hooters because I like the atmosphere and it seems to be on my bucket list - I've been to quite a few of them. If there's a Hooters, I'm there. At least once. And because you don't expect much, you get a lot more.

The lady at registration gave us a room for 20.00 more because it was a walk in. Still not bad so we took the offer and gave us a room on the third floor. As we walk up to the third floor the hallway smells like dead fish. It's a very uncomfortable smell and I immediately started not to like the place. We walk in the room and it smells even worse, it felt like no one had been there for awhile and left an open fridge full of meat inside. So I walk to open up a window and sure enough there was moths everywhere and jumped up on me ! (There was at least three huge moths) I freaked out and locked myself in the bathroom. My bf tried killing them and insisted it was ok but we both agreed to walk back down and get another room.

They also did not tell me about the resort fee when the room was booked so finding out it was going to be an extra $100 when checking in irritated me. The room was awful it had a smell to it when we first arrived. If you opened up the window then all you head was the air conditioning sounds for the casino itself so you couldn't really hear anything else especially if you were trying to watch tv. The air conditioning unit in the room just added to the noise. There was a weird stain on the carpet in one of the corners of the room with what looked like white powder on it but never cleaned up. The bathroom was awful the shower curtain was way too short to cover the whole area so one end or the other was open spraying water all over the bathroom. The shower head barely worked and it took longer than normal to take a shower. Don't leave your change out because it will disappear when housekeeping cleans up your room. Downstairs the bars were nice with good wait staff and good bar staff but if you went into the restaurant the service went way down even if they weren't busy.

The front desk did PROMPTLY switch rooms's for us & when I had a dealing w/ cafe management they were alittle rude to me ... It made my vacation not a good one..

The last trip we stayed at the Tropicana, quite the nightmare, but nothing compared to the ABSOLUTE SHITHOLE that is Hooters Hotel and Casino.  
The elevators don't work most of the time.  The A/C never works in the hallway.  The place smells of mold, ass and old cigar smoke.  The rooms are on the smaller side and make sure you stay away from the bar stools in the corner as they are a death trap waiting to happen.  Just trust me on this one.  The rooms are also dirty, especially the bathroom.  My favorite are the little notes around the room.....

Note #1 - We are trying to conserve power and energy, therefore, we would really appreciate it if you would use the same towel twice before we replace them.  (WHAT?!?!??  That's just gross, maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I didn't find blond hairs all over the bathroom.  By the way, those of us in this room all have dark hair.  Black more specifically)

Did I mention the three tempature escalating shower I was introduced too.  Nice, Cold, HOTT!!  Nice, COLD, HOTTTT!!  and so on.....

Note #2 - Again we are trying to conserve power and energy and would rather not change the sheets on every visit.  Face it, you don't change the sheets at YOUR house everyday, do you?  (Well no, but I also don't have left over blood stains on my comforter either)

I understand the saving energy thing, but not in vegas, we are at a casino for fucksake.  Lights on and blinking 24 hours a day, yeah, way to save Hooters!!

The food, well, disgusting, but it's Hooters what more could you ask for.

Just a side note, I learned at Hooters that the gals, in the black shorts with their Hooters uniforms are the pregnant ones....I've never seen so many pregnant Hooters bitches in my life.  I just don't know how I feel about that.

When all is said and done, I still give Hooters two stars for the $800 I won gambling, (did I mention I'm not a gambler) and the bartender ""Guy"" at the bar to the left when you walk in.  He was an awesome guy and a great bartender!!

The best part of all, was knowing I only had to stay two nights, because my last two nights would be spent in a suite at the Venetian!!",xdbm8yK3iUoAiKnZXmxzZg,2,1,2,k56YonhaVtSB0-u49-Q6dQ
200885,2012-01-15,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Staying at hooters on the winter offer in Dec 2011 was a great decision. I received $200 free promo play, 2 free steak dinners including steaks/unlimited texas toast/fries or mashed or baked potato, $10 bonus slot play, $10 table matchplay, a free mug, and a free tote bag all along with a $19.95 room rate (also a $9.95 per night resort fee charge and $25 security hold per night).

What made the deal even more spectacular were the rooms. Comfy beds, well-appointed, nice tropical decor with a cute faux plant, 2 complimentary waters every day, several outlets (often hard to find even in high end hotels I have gone to but they had outlets right on the desk top), wifi, brilliant bathroom, relatively clean and just plain comfortable. Was not a big fan of the woody-plank-looking things throughout the property but it could be tolerated with all the other niceties.

What made the deal even better was the pool. It's a very nice pool at that rate. It has a pool bar (which I was not opportune to use in Dec weather), a nice hot spa jacuzzi, 3 pools (though they were too cold in Dec), a waterfall, tropical landscaping, a little sandy area, hot beds, fire beds, comfy day bed lounge chairs, a nice sitting/laying area in the pool....quite a bit of features for a 24/7 year-round pool (not sure any other hotel has their pools open at all hours)!

What made the deal even sweeter was the casino. Yes, it's tiny but the slots were doing well for me, not super harsh. I had some fun at the craps table too. It's also nice to have $2.50 roulette (50 cent chips) and $3 BJ right under your nose. Also, I hit several small wins (like free wings and free shows and even a $50 bonus slot play) on the promo slots with my $200 free slot play but I kept playing through the wins trying to get a promo jackpot (of $1000 cash) reaching up to about $20,000 in free promo slot play...before losing it all. I got 3 hours on that slot...certainly wished the promo play counted for comps!

What made the deal even more intriguing was the facilities. The gift shop has my favorite tollhouse cookie ice cream sandwich! The steakhouse (formerly known as Mad onion) has a wonderful and comfortable decor and open all night long. Food here was OK with me. Did not get a chance to go to Hooters but had the 25cent hooters wings at the bar and it was so nasty (tried them again in new Jersey and they still were gross). Taxis were always available outside. At least they have shows (which not all off-strip hotels do)! Internet kiosks abound. An arcade (though limited hours). And nearby trop and mgm are also nice, fun (more refined) casinos. I also like taking the 201 bus from in front of the hotel down to Tropicana Cinemas on trop ave for $1.50 second-run movies. 

Granted, the bright oranges and wood plank thingies everywhere can be a tad overboard. And people might find Hooters *not* as grandiose and impressive as other Strip casinos but it's fully comfortable and decent. All in all, however, Hooters is a hotel and casino with a very nice and fun vibe with great value especially with a good offer.",fHOBGmtI1VdGKWIxrFH0kA,5,0,4,jtuoGa5ZN1I2_m9Ti_C_gw
201182,2014-03-14,1,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"The Bad:  This hotel is old.  The rooms have a 26"" tube TV.  The bathrooms are comparable to a Motel 6. They have two places to eat...Hooters...wings and burgers and the Onion something.  People smoke weed in the rooms which stinks up a whole floor. The fixtures etc all seemed to be replaced but with repair/apartment grade stuff.  Big dings in the drywall.  Old rugs that you don't dare walk on in bare feet, (sleep in your socks if you get up at night). Real, real basic accomodations.

The Good:  Really cheap rooms. Regular people in the bar and gaming area.  Easy to get in and out of out front, not a zoo.  Kind of a fun but controlled frat house atmosphere in the small casino area. Right across the street from the MGM if you want all the fluff and $25 crap tables and $25 black jack tables.  The in-room coffee maker was good.  made shaking off the morning cobwebs a little easier.  No place for breakfast that I could find.  All the staff was great and very friendly/helpful and the ""Hooter's Girls"" working the casino area were very easy on the eyes and nice.

Like everything is this world, you kinda get what you pay for.  If you want a cheap place to crash or don't care about the fancy schmance casino, this place will work.

Rooms are on par with a Motel 8, so if you're looking for a discount room, these may fit your need.  There are no real frills in the room, it's very basic.

303264,2013-05-25,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Have been here before and had a great time so we decided to book for our honeymoon. We booked for 11 nights. This time we get to our room and discover there is no fridge in the room. They tell us none of the rooms have them and they are $25 dollars  day to rent (very very small fridges mind you). For an 11 night stay thats $275 dollars to rent a less than 2 cubic foot fridge. Pretty ridiculous. We happened to drive so we went down to walmart and bought a 3 cubic foot one for less than $100, which we can now take home with us. The $13 dollar a day 'resort fee' which supposedly includes internet includes only one internet connection per room (we have two laptops) and the cord extends only about 6 inches so sitting at the desk is the only option if you want to use it. Connection speed is very slow. We complained and they sent someone to bring us another cord who begrudgingly told us it would be very very slow bc the connection is already terrible. When room service cleaned they did not take the used coffee k-cup form the machine and decided not to make our bed at all because we had one of our own blankets on top of it. (there are no comforters on the beds only a very thin blanket and sheets. We called to order room service and after failing to be connected 2 times they told us the front desk would have the restaurant call us. Never Happened. Called front desk 2 more times before finally being connected to the hooters restaurant manager who then proceeded to tell us they would not remove the gratuity charge (which is mandatory and in addition to a $2 service charge) even though it had taken us over half an hour just to get our order in. We would have gone down and picked it up ourselves but kept being assured they would call us. We called to get some extra coffee cups for the room since we had not had room service that day and had used ours and they told us they charge for them. They then called us back and brought some up for free. They must have thought we wanted k-cups for the keurig in the room.(Which whould have been free regardless since we did not get the ones we would have recieved had we had the room cleaned that day). The hotel room is okay and the pool area is nice. Food at the restaurant is decent. The mad onion no longer offers a breakfast buffet. And all of the service numbers connect you to the same person which is pretty annoying. Overall the hotel itself may be a three or three and a half star but the service is terrible. They don't seem to care at all about their customers (even though we were on a long trip which is well over the average stay at a vegas hotel). Will not be coming back. Which is a shame because last time we really did have a good time. Oh and we were in a smoking room but had to call and request ashtrays. Next time i'll just ash on the floor like all the people before us obviously have.

Felt I should add to this review that we woke up this morning (Memorial Day weekend) to not having any running water.

I loved the location, for an off-strip hotel, you are pretty damn close to being on strip. Walk across the street and go into the MGM, or walk 2 minutes next door into the tropicana and voila on strip. 

I found our room to be dated, but perfectly clean and comfortable. I'm not sure what most other reviewers problems were, I don't tend to book a hotel for a trip to spend all my time in my room, and I never go to vegas with the intention of only staying in my hotel. 

I enjoyed the prime rib deal at the mad onion, I just wish they had  more selection for restaurants in the resort. 

I think your outlook on these places all stem from what you expect. If you're expecting the lap of luxury for $20-$50/night then you need a reality check. If you expect a nice clean but dated room to retire to after a long day on the strip, then you can't go wrong with the rates here.

When switched to ""better"" room it was exactly the same, but in a minimum acceptance condition. I would rather have a sliding. Door that won't close or lock that a peeling shower backing.

Also I think two elevators that work for a 10+ story hotel isn't too much to ask for. Also the rooms claim to be have recently redone, from what I can tell that must mean new paint and curtains.

Went back again and told them that since the room smelled like an ash tray, we would be looking for a new hotel and I assumed I could get ALL my money back.

So first impression was not good (0 or 1 star).  Second person at Registration was nice and found us a new room, and second impression is that it is a nice room (3 stars).

Averaged it out to 2 stars.  It might be a craps shoot to get a good room.

Update:  A couple of things.  One day, they only half cleaned the room.  Only made one bed, and didn't give us fresh towels, though we still had a couple of unused towels from the previous day.

If you stay here and wants to have a good time gambling, i suggest just walk right across MGM Grand although getting to the sidewalk requires you to walk more than you are suppose to. The next time we go to Vegas, we'll pay the extra 40-80 dollars more charge for a different hotel by the strip.

I stayed at Hooters a couple weeks ago...booked online with what I thought was a great deal.  Booked directly from their website, because I didn't want to deal with any weird hidden fees from a third-party site like Hotwire, Orbitz, etc.  Went through the process...clicked my dates, saw the rates, saw the taxes and resorts fees...no problem!  Then I saw that they offered an additional AAA discount, so i was feeling pretty good!  Then when I got there and checked in they said they had already applied the AAA discount.  Not sure how that was possible.  I never inputted any code or anything, so how did they know I had a AAA membership?  The site says they offer a AAA discount when you show proof at check in.  So I tried to explain to two females (one said she was a manager) the situation and they looked at me like I had 25 heads.  They insisted the discount was already applied to my rate when I booked.  I insisted it wasn't (because that was the truth)!  I understand things get messed up, but their behavior toward me was ridiculous.  At first they were very nice, then when I politely explained they were wrong, they both got very defensive and tried to make me feel like an idiot.  Then I got a little upset because a) i was right b) they were wrong c) they insisted I was wrong and d) they were rude.  

The rest of my stay was fine...decent room for the price, not a far walk to The Strip, cheap tables, etc, etc.  

However, I'm big on customer service and this place has NONE.  Never going back there.  Oh one other thing, they said there's wireless Internet...Not in my room.

503657,2014-12-13,2,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Dear Hooters Las Vegas,

I have always enjoyed my stays at Hooters Las Vegas. Unfortunately that was not the case this weekend. I checked into the hotel on December 5th and was given room 263 in the Bungalow tower. The room was nice as I expected. The next morning on Saturday December 6, my boyfriend and I noticed the hot water was not working in the shower. I called the front desk and they said they would send somebody right away. After waiting half an hour nobody had arrived. I went ahead and left the room and went to the front desk where a gentleman named Marco assisted me. Marco said that he would give us a separate room to shower in. He offered room 448 in the OCEAN tower. I thought that it was completely ridiculous to walk all the way across the casino and take an elevator just to shower. When I complained they said we could just keep the  ocean tower room to stay. (Why did they not offer that in the first place?) the manager also reversed my resort fee which was very appreciated. 

After packing up all our stuff we switched rooms at about 12pm. We left the room for the day to visit the strip. We came back to the room at about 530 pm and took a nap. At about 820pm my boyfriend woke up to take a shower. As he closed the bathroom door I HEAR THE DOOR TO THE HOTEL ROOM  OPEN. Keep in mind I am in a t-shirt and underwear laying on the bed! I look up and see a glimpse of somebody walking away quickly and closing the door. Confused I call my boyfriend asking if he left the room and he said no that he was still in the shower. I was completely frightened because someone was able TO OPEN MY HOTEL ROOM DOOR AND WALK IN.  About 5 minutes later someone starts to furiously knock on our door, I open it and a lady in a blue shirt and a man in a black jacket/maroon shirt start questioning me. They state I was supposed to check out today and should not be in the room. When I explain the situation about switching rooms they ask to see my ID. When they check my ID they said thank you and did not even apologize. After a few minutes I walk down to the front desk asking why someone opened my room door without knocking, the manager named ""H"" (who was also the lady in the blue shirt who checked my ID) denied that anyone opened the door before they knocked. I was extremely upset at this because I know what I saw and heard. She completely denied that anybody opened the door without permission. I am extremely upset at this situation as hooters violated my privacy and also did not take the liberty to update their system to acknowledge my new hotel room. I would like a refund for my weekend.",tcZElwusx3IulsTVqF4qqw,4,2,1,Nnfyd3EZfQlhUi6n2vUfTw

First, our rooms smelled like chicken wings-- gross, especially when you're hung over.  

We got locked out of our room because the battery on the door went out.  I had to run back and forth about 4 times from the back of the hotel to the front desk to keep having my key reassigned because they said it was my fault for keeping the key too close to my cell phone and/or credit cards.  
So, I finally got in the room (after having no luck with the maid's key or mine) by punching the lock a few times.  They still sent up someone from engineering to change the battery, after which, the lock never worked AT ALL -- ever again. 

As I waited in line at the front desk...again, to find out what was going on with the key, I met a couple who were having issues with their key, and they pointed out another couple who also couldn't get into their room.  It's an epidemic at Hooters!  

From then on, they told us we would need to have security escort us to our room any time we needed to get back in.  Finally, they said they would send someone up to fix it, but it would be a while because they were changing shifts, and by the way, someone would have to wait in the room because engineering wasn't allowed to fix the lock without us present.  

So, here we are, chained to our room, waiting for someone to fix the lock-- did I mention, the engineer from earlier told me their programming equipment to fix the lock was broken, and they probably wouldn't be able to fix the lock until the next morning. 

We called the front desk to request a new room.  After being told they were full, we talked them into giving us a suite.  Once, we got into our new room, the remote for the tv was broken, one of the lightbulbs in room was out, and there was a freaking cricket making a crapload of noise all night!.  AND the room was directly over the garbage, so all night i heard garbage trucks and had the pleasant aroma of rancid wings wafting in the window. 

The absolute only good part about this hotel was the nice bell person, Sean, who took our bags to the new room, and the really nice craps dealers who made losing money a fun experience!

Basically I like to refer this hotel to friends by calling it a glorified Super 8.  The location is great right behind the Tropicana and across the street (and kinda behind) the MGM Grand, legitly a maybe 5 min walk from the strip.

I paid $25 for the night I stood, but honestly wouldn't pay more than $50 since I know how cheap it can be.",g3bvJsoWVMKvOYJsz85Teg,1,1,4,Wt-33wCoxzV1n-vhzvoCaw
598602,2011-11-02,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"When you think of Las Vegas, you think of bigger and over-the-top, but prepare yourself for disappointment upon entering the Hooters Restaurant in the Hooters Casino.  To put it best: it's an ordinary Hooters restaurant that happens to be in Vegas, as opposed to being the ""Vegas Hooters.""  Expect your typical Hooters experience but in a drearier setting because the Hooters Casino is a bit dingy, and with so many other places to visit for cheap greasy food this place is usually very quiet.

In my opinion, Hooters should consider putting more money into the location and making it a Vegas destination.  There are other places with better looking waitresses and cheap food/drinks, so why limit one's self to this hole in the wall location?  In Vegas, there are too many options for attractive waitresses to be stuck at this place - that's the feeling that I got during my visits.  There is nothing wrong with the place and it is your typical Hooters experience, but shouldn't the expectations be higher in Vegas?  

I have been to several Hooters restaurants throughout California, and have been to the Vegas location 3-4 times.  I actually stayed at the hotel on one occasion during a last minute Vegas trip when my usual places were booked, so I have a thorough perspective of the hotel, bar, casino, and restaurant.  The Vegas Hooters isn't bad but it really can't compete with the other Vegas options.  The casino and bar area is sad and depressing, but the rooms are super cheap and better than the local roach motels.  

I'm a guy that likes wings, beers, and stealing glances at the waitresses, but in Vegas, there are so many nicer places for the same cost, that I can't really recommend the restaurant unless you've never been to a Hooters restaurant before.  It's not bad, but there is no energy and the vibe is nonexistent.  This location is average when compared to other Hooters locations, but less than average when compared to other options in the area.",-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,1,0,2,DJmquUd4xS1tBsMvjjQpWA
610352,2015-01-31,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I recently stayed here for a tradeshow I was attending nearby. First off this is my first review on yelp. But I also have to state that it was also the first time I've ever been stuck in a elevator. Actually both of them at some point in the 4 day stay. 
The casino floor is small but had everything we were looking for in the gaming category 
The room on the other hand left some things to be desired. Throughout our stay I had one shower that could be considered warm the rest were at most Swimming pool temp with the cold turned all the way off. Upon arriving in my second floor room I opened the balcony door(which had no way to lock) after watching a roach crawl from the roof into my room that door wasn't opened again. The carpet has seen better days and judging from the particles on the floor so had their vacuums.
The staff for the most part was decent and polite but some of the bartenders should choose a different profession. While putting money into the machine at one of the bar areas for over fifteen minutes I realized I hadn't seen the bartender the whole time. The reason being she was too busy talking to a coworker about her day. When her attention was gained it seemed a incredible strain for her to pour my drink. I'm in retail and always thought the customer came first!
I hate to complain but as a retail buyer and former worker in the hospitality industry I have stayed in many places throughout North America and would say this was one of the worst.

The girls are not meant to be swimsuit models, otherwise they wouldn't be working at Hooters.  The point is, if you are going somewhere to drink beer and eat wings, you may as well have a girl with big hoo-hoos serving you.  She doesn't have to be a 10 for her to make it a more pleasant experience than getting beer and wings from some hurting girl somewhere else.

So get over it, stop with the criticisms and enjoy yourself.

Wings = good and cheap.
Ham & cheese sandwich - surprisingly edible.
Beer - same as everywhere else.
Boobs - well above average.  Plus the view of the pool patrons while you are eating is a plus.

A few friends and I were staying at NYNY, and decided that we would try and find some cheaper blackjack tables to maximize our table time. We'd heard that the relatively new Hooters Hotel had $3 BJ tables, so we made the half mile or so trek from our hotel. What a waste of time. The way Hooters advertises it (giant banners down the side of the hotel proclaiming ""$3 Blackjack 24/7!""), you'd think they would at least have several tables at this price. Nope. They had two $3 tables (both full of course), and all the rest were $10 and above.

In sticking with the company slogan of being ""delightfully tacky"", the casino area itself looked pretty low class. This is coming from someone who is most definitely NOT a high-roller, but for a fairly new hotel on the Vegas strip, this casino looked and felt out of place.

Hooters is a very affordable, very decent hotel.  I'd go so far as to say, much, much nicer than its price point.

The rooms are pretty darned spacious.  They're clean and neat.  Bed's comfy.  A/C works well.  Everything about the bathroom's fine---nice space, good shower in the tub/shower combo.  Housekeeping seems to take pride in doing their job well.

I like the casino, mostly.  Pay attention to the pay tables if you play video poker.  Mostly good, but a few are horridy.

Basically, two restaurants.  Mad Onion is good.  The other places all seem to get their food delivered to you from Hooter's.  

Pros:  Good, solid hotel, that's quite affordable.  $4 beers (or free while playing video poker) is a big thumbs up.  Location is great to the Strip and airport.

Cons:  Really only 2 restaurants, with Hooters serving food to all outlets (I think) except Mad Onion.  Between the 2 restaurants,  if you want something that does not involve fried food or steak, you'll have few options.

That said I am an outdoors type of guy and I adapt to things quickly. Hotel and room has an odd smell near the pool. I either got use to it or it went away because I only noticed it during check in. Bed was clean and room was tidy. AC is pretty loud and I can see how it can annoy guests but I slept well anyways. Pool is 24 hours and people seemed to be having fun(I didn't go in person) throughout the night. You can tell that the casino and room are older I feel they do make an effort to keep it clean and maintained but have given up on renovation. First time I flushed the toilet it seemed clogged so I emptied a trashcan filled it with water and got it to work that way but after that no issues with it.

I booked a night here for obvious reasons (the ridiculously low price)

Upon arriving I was greeted by an unfriendly valet attendant. 

Checking in was a long and unnecessary process. It seemed they were using a software program that was not very user friendly. 

I was under the idea that all the girls would be dressed in uniform.... That wasn't the case at all.

They gave me a room with two beds because a king room wasn't available.

Upon entering the room I was disgusted by the smell and overall cleanliness of the room. It looked dated and unkempt.

The TV looked like it belonged in a thrift store, the picture was fuzzy and it had a horrendous selection of channels. 

The bathroom was disgusting. The tile looked very old and the shower was uncomfortable. 

The linens and towels felt hard and cheap.

I can forgive a lot of things, but being one of the biggest chains in the restaurant business and taking pride in the esthetics of their restaurants I expected a lot more from the ""remodel"" from it's previous property the San Remo.

The poker room was pretty small, only one table going, and the tournament starts at 10 a.m.  so I never made it.

The table games were also about a 3.  Some of the dealers are inexperienced.  I never played at the hooters girls as dealers tables either so  that wasn't the reason.

The bar people were pretty friendly though, and gave comp drinks while you played video poker without making you do max bets like some of the other casinos.  Oh, also they actually do comp red bull and vodka while some other places charged for the red bull.

910893,2010-06-14,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"This was our first time in Vegas and we decided to stay here mainly due to price and proximity to the Strip.  I imagine we read 200 reviews of the place from multiple sites and were ready for the worst.  Surprisingly it was not that bad...if you go in expecting a 1st rate rat trap!
We stayed in a basic king room on the 9th floor of the second tower (not the one labeled Ocean).  The room was clean, had a great view of the strip, and had a cold AC.  The hallways leading to the rooms appear dirty - mismatched wall paint and stained carpets (but we read this in multiple reviews so we expected it).  The decor was ""tacky"" Florida - but that's part of the Hooter's slogan.  Our room was missing the Hooter's bar stools and table that they claim on the website.  The bathroom was acceptable.  Large vanity, great shower (never ran out of hot water).  They provided us with face soap, hand soap, shower cap, and lotion.  My wife said she saw shampoo and conditioner on the housekeeping cart, but we did not get any.  WIRED internet service was like $12.50 a night...however, we found at least 6 unsecured wireless signals that we could pickup at no cost (mainly from nearby hotels).  We found in Vegas that you really don't spend a lot of time in the room - so everything was OK!  Good enough for a quick nap then back out!
Pool - the pool is open 24 hours and we went out at about midnight one night.  The pool with the waterfall was to cold for us - but the other pool was about right.  We also used one of the two hot tubs.  We packed beach towels, but the 24 hour gift shop next to the pool gives you small hotel ones to use (I'm sure as part of the resort fee).  There are also ample lounge chairs if you would rather sit and watch or enjoy the weather.  There was only one other group of people out when we used the pool at midnight...it was like having it all to ourselves.  Pool bar was busy and it took forever with only one bartender to get a drink.  Also advertised as ""swim-up,"" I can assure that it is not!

Casino - my wife and I probably had the most fun at this casino.  The drinks flow very freely and we never had a problem finding a cocktail waitress.  We mainly played penny slots and always had multiple runs ins with a waitress (remember to tip good). Its small enough that you can't get lost like some of the others on the strip.  We played some table games for the first time and had some very friendly customers teach us the rules of the tables.                  

Restaurant - We got a package deal that included two tickets for 10 free wings, 2 drinks at the pool side bar, 2 show tickets at the casino, and $100 in free slot play.  We ate at the Hooters inside the casino and would only rate this as subpar.  1. Our waitress was an idiot and had broken English.  She kept giving us napkins with her name on it and said just yell if you need me.  We were right near the bar and it took her 10 mins to get us our beer.  2. We tried to use the two 10 free wings tickets - but were told that we could only use one per table.  It does not say that anywhere on the tickets.  We ended up giving our other ticket to a couple next to us, just because we didn't want to eat wings for multiple meals 3. We ordered medium wings, but it seemed like they put nothing on them.  We ended up putting the table hot sauce on them to add some flavor.
Show -  We used our free show tickets and saw the Dirty Jokes show with Todd Paul, Geechy Guy, and Mickey Johnson(?).  We almost used the tickets for just the Todd Paul show but realized that his tickets were only $9.95 and the Dirty Jokes show tickets were like $30.  The show is on the second floor in a tiny conference room.  There were maybe only 30 people at our Friday night show.  Seating is not assigned and an usher will escort you to a table.  We lucked out and got front row - but all seats would have been good.  Geechy is hilarious, Todd is OK, and the other guy is forgettable.  Their performance was kinda like when the 4 guys of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour sit on stage at the end of their show together and tell jokes.  I like to heckle and was disappointed with the lack of audience interaction - its mainly them telling scripted jokes.  Worth it for FREE...I might pay up to $15.00 for this.  Our tickets included a free drink at Dixie's Dam Bar downstairs.
Complaints - 1. We wanted to walk around on the strip with drinks because not many places let you walk around with open containers.  We stopped at the bar right at the entrance to grab a couple drinks.  We asked for 2 Bud Light Limes and the bill was $11.00 for two 12 oz bottles!  Tip- you can find 24oz/32oz cans about a block away by Walgreens for $8.00 for two!  2. The promotional slot play is a scam (in multiple reviews)  3. The owl rewards card is a scam...you must have to gamble like $300 to get to the 200 point minimum for the free t-shirt  AND you have to do that in the first 24 hours of signing up.

I've been ""chosen"" to stay at this hotel several times over the years, simply because it's one of the cheapest hotels in Vegas that's still in close proximity to The Strip.  It's definitely a lower-end hotel, similar to the ones you'd find in Downtown Las Vegas.  If there is any need for you to project a sense of wealth or affluence, this isn't the hotel for you.  If you need a hotel with clean rooms and a reasonably nice casino that is in close proximity to even nice hotels with far better casinos, this is the place for you.  

The last time I stayed here, I had a room on the 9th floor.  It was a very clean room with comfortable beds.  Depending on what side of the building your room is located, you're either going to have a view of the MGM Grand to the North of you, just across the street, or a view of the pool area and the City of Henderson way off in the distance to the South.  The wifi connection was easy to pick up.  I don't like hotel rooms where even the quickest of showers will cause the bathroom to turn into a giant steamy mess, and this is exactly what it's like here.  You can tell that the wallpaper and the paint in the bathroom has had to endure the brunt of this constant steam.  

The casino itself is very basic.  There aren't a huge variety of slot machines and table games.  The advertise $5 blackjack tables, but there will likely be only one of these tables in operation at any given time.  If you like the whole scene at Hooters restaurants, you'll like the scene in this casino.  If you're looking for the opulent side of Las Vegas, you won't like it.  

I think I paid $25 for one night in this hotel, which is a great bargain for this hotel.  I gave this hotel three stars instead of two because the quality of the hotel pretty much matches the price.  I've stayed at much worse places than this in Las Vegas and paid much more.  I'd say this is the best hotel in Las Vegas for this price range.",n6n3RnhXjdFKxVntanRGWw,0,0,3,Pi3GnriVI10dIsNgNIfLcg

First we had drinks and then she even asked us when we would like to have our onion rings. Before or with our dinner. We thought that was amazing!
Our dinner came and yet more friendly comments. WOW!
Our chicken wings were amazing and exactly how we ordered them. Once again more friendly chatter.
After dinner she asked us if we would like to take our leftover food home with us. We said yes of course.

Positives: Among the best, last minute booking, price available so close to the strip. Within walking distance to the blvd. It is ,by comparison, worth the price. The view on the 18th floor was good. We checked in hours early and they were very flexible. Staff were friendly and respectful. Rooms were decent. The complimentary breakfast for 2 and the free $10 voucher for gaming is a plus. There were no issues, loud noises or other complaints. There is a small safe, iron & board, modern coffee machine and plenty of closet & drawer space.

Negatives: the room decor isn't bad but it is partially outdated. Windows were spotted with dirt. The tv was still the tube type.

Taking over the old Hotel San Remo property, Hooters had just opened on February 2, 2006, so quite simply, it gave us a good excuse to eat and stay there. Even though we got there fairly late (around 9PM), there was still a pretty hefty line wrapping around the side of the restaurant. The wait wasn't too bad though (we were let in less than 15 minutes later) so if you really want to eat here, stick around for a bit.

The interior of the restaurant was bright and spacious, with color televisions sprinkled all around, and a definite & recognizable wood theme. There was even live music, trickling in from the bar next door.

Wish that was the worst of it, but no. The worst was the raw sewage they pumped out of the place 20 feet from the rooms. The putrid stench got into every pore and was the most disgusting thing you could ever imagine. Vomitting for all the wrong reasons makes this place a health hazard.

Then there were the elevators that left you out on the wrong floor, that is, if they happened to be working at all.  It was a guessing game because Hooters never put an out of order sign up. Wanna guess how long it took to get up to your room since only 1 elevator was serving 18 floors of rooms in the Bayview Tower?

Taking a shower was a hoot too. About every 40 seconds you would get blasted with a scalding shot of hot water, or an absolutely freezing shower of water. It turns out this is a long term problem they have known about, but refuse to fix. (That goes for the elevators and raw sewage issues too. They know, they just won't fix it.)

Hotels I have stayed at in 3rd world countries haven't been this awful. To think this is an experience out of Las Vegas, NV is unimaginable.

What a HORRIBLE experience !!!I would not stay here again if they give me a free room. Sat morning.. Called  for early check in 30$ lmao What????!!!! Ok.. Never mind we will float around until 3pm.
So we get to Hooters at 2:53 pm get a room on the 4th fl and as soon as we opened the door a bad smell of mildew hit us and with some having asthma and allergies this is a no no. Called for a manager we got the head of house keeping.. (1 st joke ) she said we just cleaned the carpet .. Huh? ok, we need a new room so we had to carry everything back down and wait back in line we get a lady name H (later found out she is the manager) she put us on the 18 Th floor said it was new carpet and new bed ? ( not sure about that but, we will take it )
Room  was ok . We leave to go out and long story short one friend went back to the room 3 of us stayed out, came back to the room around 1am got to the 18th fl and our key would not open the door we hear a lil noise ( thought someone was having adult time) didn't pay it any mind continued to try and get the door open and we hear yelling and screaming and some talking that was in Spanish and a door slam then stop, help, I can't take this anymore needles to say her man was beating the shit out of her .. We get scared thinking that maybe he would come out and see us trying to get in out room and start trouble with us so I'm trying to google the hotel for the number so I can call for help  and my friend got her phone and called our other friend that was in the room sleep. We get in call for help from our room .. They come about 10 min later ( maybe more 2nd joke ) I go out and tell them what happen and we are scared they say go back in the room they stand by the door to see if they hear anything and they started again the men was beating her .. Smh .. So they say open up he did and they say miss are you ok ( I didn't hear what was said but the two guys walked by our room as they left and said code 4 I guess that means clear problem over . 3rd joke) but at the end of it all no one from Hooters called our room and even asked if we would have liked to be moved. we all slept with one eye open and checked out at 730 that morning  this was the soonest we could. at this point we had enough and was just ready to go home . While checking out we could not get any type of refund ( because the manager H wasn't in till 2pm 4th joke)so I walk over to talk to the security ( because you have to go though them to make a complaint Hooters is private owned) while telling them the story one guy says was he BLACK HUH? What the fuck does that mean? Only black men beat women ? Smh (5th joke)but this really has to be a joke.) Ok ok it's really time to go , head of security knew nothing about this I wonder why.Please never stay here 100$ is not worth all the shit you will go though and after all of this my friend is still trying to get our money back .

As a disabled guest I asked on booking for a room that would be easy to get to i.e that I wouldn't have far to walk from the parking lot to my room: not only did they put me in the room FARTHEST from the elevators, the parking garage has been closed off and the valets have 'claimed' some of the disabled person's parking spaces for their own purposes (not letting disabled guests use them) and we had to park in a regular space (so I had great difficulty getting out of the car not being able to fully open the door) which was so far from the nearest elevator that I was in much more pain than usual by the time I reached the room. This parking situation also means that any disabled people having to use the rear parking lot will have to use the rear door which is very difficult to open (if you have a physical disability) and have to negotiate their way around stools and tables in the bar that you have to go through in order to get to the main areas (anywhere other than the bar actually). Half the staff seem to be on a kind of 'automatic pilot' so if you ask them anything more complicated than, ""How do I get to my room?"" you get a vague response that's not helpful at all.

1023067,2011-09-29,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Oh Hooters. Got love them right? I stayed here for my 21st birthday because it has the best deal on i4vegas.com. There are good things about this hotel and there are crappy things about this hotel. 

I will start with the negatives only because the positives may or may not out weigh the negatives and I kind of like leaving people with a happy note. 

So, first of all, if you stay there and you park in the parking garage, be careful. The garage itself contains creepy people and I may have seen a security guard on his little bike once just riding around not really looking. Also, the elevators that lead from the parking garage to the hotel are probably the scariest elevators I have ever been in. They are old and rickety looking/sounding, I was like ""We are going to die in here, just saying,"" I was a little nervous cause I was not about to get stuck in an elevator before having a drink first. 

Sitting at the bars were not all that great, the staff at the time were not very chatty with people. It was more like, ""What do you want and tell me now or I will keep ignoring you."" So, I stayed clear from the bars there. I just figured the alcohol in my room would suffice. 

The hotel portion was nice and all, but I can see why I got a good deal for the rooms. If your looking for class, this is not the place. However, the beds were comfy! I loved sleeping there. Orange lamps were kind of cool too. 

Now to leave you with some positivity. The restaurant itself was pretty cool. They were able to accommodate my group of people in a quick time too. I saw tons of people there and we were seated pretty quick. The food is always great to me. I use to go to the one in Ontario and will always love Hooters food. The ladies were nice as well. My waitress was hilarious so it made for a good night. 

The Mad Onion restaurant was really good as well. We ate there twice, dinner and breakfast and I loved it all. They were open late nights and it was pretty cheap. I think prime rib was around $10. They also do a champagne brunch deal too. Love me some champagne with my waffles. 

Finally, I will say that if you have heard of the Men of X show, please laugh with me. I have seen Thunder Down Under before and I thought the Men of X show would be like it and their tickets were only $16 and not $45. So I let my mom talk me into it. It is only 4 dudes, who pretty much just dance their booties off. I laughed so hard during the whole thing, just because it was so cheesy! I think if you want a good laugh $16 bucks is pretty good.

Honestly, this is the worst hotel that I haven't seen anywhere else like that before. When I came to the room, it doesn't have any shampoo and body wash. I meant it was not the big deal for me.

Everyday the bay tower as a whole smells like human sewage, so I'd recommend ocean tower. Had to get about 12 keys made because the life expectancy of the room card is about 3 hrs. The front desk people will tell you to keep it away from phones and blah blag...4 had their own pocket, inside the holder they give you. 

 So now on our last morning after finally getting into the room after yet another rekey....its 7am and some hooker is screaming in the hall outside of our room, kids trying to sleep. Security is standing there, front desk won't help with anything and I'm up because this place and it's staff are horrendously under managed/unsupervised.

What a dump !  Avoid staying here at all costs.  Im giving it two stars only because the casino has really low limits on there tables.  And the pool actually looked descent.   So i requested a Non smoking king bed room in their tower for a pretty good deal.  This is how i was lured in (low prices) we were working with a budget this trip.  I get there to check in and they tell me they don't have a non smoking king room in the tower.  (even though i had called a few days prior to make sure it was reserved)  Idiots !!
So i settle with a smoking king room on the 3rd floor.  Get in the room and the first thing i notice is the industrial AC unit for the whole casino/hotel is outside our balcony and its humming like a tractor. FUCKKK NO !!  so i go ask for a new room right away.  Finally a different guy gets us a non smoking room w/ king bed in the tower on the 10th floor.  much better, but still the rooms are only a step above motel 6.   

Tip: you end up spending more money taking cabs to the strip every night than it would cost to upgrade to a nicer hotel/casino.  Spend the extra cash to get a better room at a better hotel.  

The food was ok, takes a long time for a ""to go"" order.
beers were cheap.

It's also right next to the MGM Grand so you're pretty close to wherever you would want to walk to.
I LOVE this place!  We got a rate of $16 per night on a weekday of course but still--- could not believe how nice it was for the price.  We stayed in the bungalow and the tower and they were both great.  The bungalows are smaller rooms but you are right next to the pool.  Ours also had a balcony. Our tower room had no balcony but offered a nice view of Excalibur and MGM Grand and it was a much bigger room and bigger bathroom and also included a vanity, which is nice if you are a girl.

their pool is GREAT.  we went on what happened to be a windy day but it was still great...there is a beautiful waterfall and three pools, depending on what temp you like.  the pool w/ the waterfall is the coldest, the middle pool is middle temp and the pool furthest from the waterfall is the warmest.  nice jacuzzi too.  also, the pool is open 24/7 - which is great.  I know some hotels close their pools at 6 or 7pm...which I find crazy because this is Vegas!  Hooters is open all the time.  My boyfriend loves their $1.50 cup of beer and I have to say that their fries are amazing!  you can eat by the pool too.  they also have a gym which sadly, we did not have time to use.

the casino is one of the smaller ones but its nice and you actually know where you are going, not like the larger casinos where it can feel like a maze.

There are many off strip small hotel/casinos that are close to South LVB. This may likely be the worst as it's completely pretentious. Simply because at a glance the appearance seems nicer than some of the classic old school spots say Gold Coast, The O'rleans, or Downtown. Yet, it isn't. Aside from the reg overpriced drinks, the wings are only good if the fryer grease has been frequently changed. Doesn't happen often. 

Service is mostly young, inexperienced, (maybe not their fault) ladies who's training doesn't seem to go beyond a robotic ""wait in line here for a table in the new lounge"" to "" your table is ready. The cocktail girls at the gaming tables are slower than average. In the lounge their more attentive.

There was VERY LOUD construction going on and when I inquired about it, they said it was construction on the pool. So not only could I not sleep but I couldn't even go relax in the hot tub because it was all closed!
Late that night, when I got back to my room and wanted a midnight snack, I was informed that their ""24/7"" kitchen was closed, so no room service.

The drains in the bathroom do not go down so when you take a shower it turns into a bath. Which is kind of disgusting because you end up standing in all the dirt and soap you just washed off. Parking is free which is a plus. The rooms are definitely not sound proof you hear the music blasting even 8 floors up from the pool area. When I got here there was no toilet paper in the bathroom.  Was I supposed to provide my own? And they have a Keurig in the room but no coffee to put in it. Kind of pointless. One of my lamps did not work.

My room was clean and comfy with a nice view. My bed was comfortable, nothing cushy or posh, but comfortable. The only things I would change would be to replace the carpet because it's old, brighten up the hallways a bit, and update the elevators. Other than that it's a cool little hotel.

I had a wedding to attend at the MGM Grand and was trying to find a deal. Hooters was right across the street and much cheaper. I got lucky and caught two free nights on my Hotels.com app so this was an easy decision. To start I paid about 150 for 4 nights. After reading online reviews i was skeptical and expected just bargain motel fare. But the room was suprisingly huge and comfortable. So the value was in the space. Sadly they don't have Wifi but wired internet. I was lucky enough to bring my laptop so it worked, but i was relegated to the desk. The casino was small but did have $1, $3 and $5 blackjack tables which is my fav game. The food was usual Hooters fare, fried stuff, and the other restaurant was ok. I went next door to cOco's for cheap breakfast and was always a hop skip and a jump from the MGM grand and the strip. The pool was small but quiet and the only one i knew in the area that was 24/7. Overall Hooters is a bargain and you're never too far from the action. I blew the extra money i saved at the tables of course  :(",g-eSXhnrs9dSyMHJ-9ZJTw,3,2,4,EE_Gk5xjtXIkIQuxvcmAuw

She ordered that to be healthy and we all know there are lots of calories in dressing. We also ordered the caramel fudge cheesecake. Its was ok, the fudge on the bottom of the cheesecake was a little overwhwhelming for me. The chocolate syrup swirled on the the plate would've been enough chocolate for me.

Even though the pool was entirely out of commission we were still charged an additional $22.50 per night for a ""resort fee"", something ALL of Las Vegas has stooped to in order to inflate their ever growing prices.

Right, so how much time do you spend in your room when you're in Vegas? If you're like us, next to none. As long as a there's a clean bed, hot shower and enough room to spread your clothes all over the floor as you struggle to find that one t-shirt left in your suitcase that doesn't require ironing you should be fine. Hooters has all of that. Sure, it looks dated and you probably won't have much of a view (that car park we overlooked sure was pretty!) but we paid $25 a night for our stay so you won't hear a word of complaint about the room from me. You can barely get a decent lunch for two people for that price!

Hooters is off the strip, but only barely. It's a five minute walk or so, and it's also directly opposite the monorail station at MGM so it's pretty easy to get around from here. It's usually pretty quiet inside, meaning it's pretty easy to get a drink if you're gambling. There was never a line for a taxi and always a taxi outside waiting, while across the road at MGM there seemed to be dozens of people waiting for one. There are plenty of bars inside and places to grab a quick bite and it's small enough to not be ready for a nap after walking from one side of the casino to the other like everywhere else.

First of all, let me highlight the FREE PARKING!  That is just truly amazing.  All parking spaces were conveniently located near an elevator entrance too.  After a long, hot, too-much-information-gathering drive, a quick exit to our future weekend home was highly appreciated.

2. This one of the more affordable places to stay.

3. Although, it's not on the strip. It's close enough. The MGM is across the street.

The cons:

1. The wait/restaurant/bar service in this place is ridiculously bad. It's either no where to be found or provided with very little personality or a sense of annoyance.

2. The rooms here have always been a bit dated, but it seems like the staff has just given up. The carpets are stained, there is very little furniture or even drawers, the TV is about 30 years old and the hallways either smell of weed or mildew.

3. The food subpar and overpriced. As a guy, I get that you're generally paying for ambiance at Hooters, but lack of customer service and food quality doesn't make up for the price. The one reataurant (Mad Onion) is rarely even open.

4. As for any kind of entertainment... nada.

They don't try to pretend to be anything they're not. And that's what makes this place perfect.

The casino is tiny. The limits are very low. The dealers (generally) are a lot of fun. The cocktail waitresses are always on their game - I don't think I've ever gone more than 20 minutes in this place without being offered a(nother) drink. The rooms are cheap and clean - not overly comfortable, but when you're collapsing into bed at 4a (or later) who really cares?

Was staying next door at the Trop and decided to walk over to Hooters for lunch.  Was seated quickly and the waitress took my order quickly as well, so far so good.  The problem was they messed my burger up three different ways.  Follow this:  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, no tomato, with mayo, American cheese.  Seems simple right?  I got a bacon cheeseburger, with tomato, no mayo, cheddar cheese?  Wha?!?  Waitress disappeared so I took the tomato off and walked over and got mayo from the bartender.  Ate the burger, and when the waitress came with the check she asked me how the meal was, I told her how they messed up three different parts of one burger order.  Her response?  ""Oh, you know how the kitchen can be"".  WHAT?!??!?  NO I DON'T KNOW HOW THE KITCHEN CAN BE I DON'T WORK HERE!  Jesus nice customer service.  No effort to make things right, just a dismissive comment about how the kitchen can be.  I give this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 because the fries were good and the burger was at least cooked, but holy hell, learn some customer service (or just learn to make the orders right to begin with)",b7-cPXCB_Ym5YLBC6j41gg,4,1,2,AHZpvKyFyYXXUFbvl74w_w

1395188,2011-05-19,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Not really impressed with the actual Hotel part of Hooters. I stayed here one night under a comp from work, probably wouldn't go back on my own dime though to stay here. 

The front desk staff was pretty nice and quick about getting us our rooms, but once i got up the room i was not impressed at all. The room is outdated (expected it from pictures online). I do like that, for the most part, it was clean. I found the bed to be decent at best, definitely not anything to rave about, but it wasn't disgusting by any means

Downstairs in the casino area is pretty fun though. They still had the $1.50 Bud Light special i heard some friends talking about when i got there so i had a couple of those and then some fries to snack on downstairs. Not the best place to grab food i must say, but you can't beat $1.50 beer! The bar tenders are always nice too, very quick and efficient and they don't screw up anything. Always checking up to make sure my group didn't need anything as well. 

Looked like lots of people were enjoying the pool, which did look pretty cool, especially at night. It wasn't a bunch of rowdy drunks either, most of the people seemed to just be relaxing and having a good time poolside with some drinks. 

The location of the hotel isn't that great. It's just slightly off the strip, the MGM is right across if you want to take the monorail, but you'll probably need a Taxi to go to any of the bigger hotels. But then again, that's why this hotel is by no means pricey. 

All in all, i think the Hooters hotel is a better place to hang out, gamble and have drinks than it is to stay. If you want a budget room than this hotel isn't bad, you'll get a decent room at a really good price. But this is definitely more of a party and bar place then it is a hotel to me.",Z_FfuvXEjMEoa4IiAIzYoQ,0,0,2,c4RtlJgHmsgu4yqO50Z1ww

Including charging $20/day for a 'resort' fee when their pool was closed for construction the entire stay, they had no accommodations set for their guests as far as a set up with a neighboring hotel for their pool, basically no solution or option. When questioned about the other including factors for a 'resort' stay, their response was 2 complimentary water bottles and a cup of keurig coffee. Once my friend and I got to our room, it was the wrong room and not what was paid for. When we called front desk they said if we came back down with our own bags they would move us correctly...

So we left a message and our room number and contact #s to answer our questions and concerns. Two days later, never heard from her. Our last night there, we found baby roaches in our room which was pleasant. Upon check out we were hit with surprising daily fees for staying in a ""RESORT"" room.  We requested to speak & handle issues with the manager. She claimed that she never received any voicemails and apologized for MISCOMMUNICATION and took ONE resort fee off only because we were checking out a day early... She did nothing further and made no wrongs right. My sons father is a manager of a 5 star resort in Scottsdale,az, so to me, this ""hospitality"" was horrendous. There was absolutely never a time that this hotel made us feel like valued guests what so ever. So Hooters hotel and casino, you have no value to me. After leaving the hotel an hour later after checking our bank accounts we had to call the manager back to speak with her about a couple $100s overcharged to our accounts. She only then apologized for the impression and mistakes her unorganized, unwelcoming, rude staff had made. Her resolution??? A whopping bite sized percentage off if we date to come back to pay money to stay there once more. The percentage was enough to cover taxes. My advice? Pay the extra $25-50/ night to stay in an actual resort on the strip, it's worth the convenience and service you're paying for without cockroaches spending there own nightly stay in your ""resort room"" on your vacation.",g8i5z0d6p34CQjS1XVFXbA,0,0,1,fTG-2oVqLG8N7Q6LHglL5w

$100 FREE PROMOTIONAL SLOT PLAY! = All or nothing. If you win the ""top prize"" at the slot machine you're playing (think 7-7-7) then you get $100 cash. If you get anything else, you don't win a penny. Promotional play is a creative way to sucker people into the casino but doesn't pay crap.

I have to say this place ROCKS!

PROS:
$1.50 BEERS:  At every CASINO BAR including $1.50 drafts at the POOL BAR. Also, they have recreated a mid west style bar where you can sit all night with cheap beers watching sports, playing video golf and placing bets at sports book 10 feet away. (FINALLY SOME ONE GETS IT!)

POOL AREA:  Open 24/7, No BS security (as long as you use common sense and aren't a jackass).  Down to earth staff, & guests.

BEDS!: VERY COMFORTABLE MATTRESS. Lack of bedding made me desire a little, but good night sleep.  Rooms are clean and AC ROCKS, sometimes too much; but hell it's freaking Vegas. I'd rather have too much than none!

LOCATION: I enjoy me some walking strip action, but HATE dealing with mega resort mazes. This place is quick, easy to find and a $10 cab ride way from the madness. 

MAD ONION: $.25 WINGS AFTER MIDNIGHT. Great drunk food. Gotta wait like 20 min, but once in.  :)  Plus i hear they have other signature meals for $9.95 (Prime Rib). 

CONS:
PORCH DOGS BAR: Avoid this place like the chick with mouth sores! They consider it a restaurant and no $1.50 beers. Plus you have to be seated for food, & although I love me some HOOTERS grub. This place is off the mark. STAY AWAY FROM PORCH DOGS.

RESERVATIONS: Great people, somewhat good prices; but you really have to look closely at $ on check in / out. I found a pricing error  (On line Summer of Choices promo pricing of $59.00 for Friday July 8, 2011. Was charged $99. I brought this to the check in gal's attention. She was VERY polite and a phone call later to confirm & pricing was corrected.  Now, most guests would have missed it..

And let me tell you, I would have much rather spent the extra $10-$15 for a hotel on the strip. Yes, it is located close to the strip but its not worth the money you spend on this overpriced hotel room.

The room was eh but the wifi is HORRIBLE. You pay $100 resort fee but you can't even get decent wifi service. I have sprint and had 0 service in my own hotel room. It was an absolute waste of money. Also, you would think with this hotel being in Vegas and knowing that temperatures get to well over 100 degrees, you would think that the hotel would provide some sort of mini fridge to keep drinks cold for hot days but they didn't. In addition, a few outlets in our room did not work (most importantly the bathroom). 

The ONLY positive things that came out of this hotel was 1)cheap gambling 2) the employees were super nice and 3) they have a steak n shake in the casino.

I would highly recommend splurging on the additional fee for a hotel on the strip. Next time, we will not be coming back to this hotel.

Toilet worked, shower worked and bed was comfortable. Room was clean, free wi-fi, pool was nice, and if you're into women, large breasted beautiful women were serving you drinks and food.

It's right across from MGM and right next to the Tropicana. Takes less than a minute to walk to the strip. Location and price is what sold it to me.

Casino is on the smaller side, and not as crowded.

Pros-The Beer was cold and fairly cheap compared to other places we visited, facilities were clean and the wait staff were fairly prompt.

Cons- My wife and I went here for wings and ordered the Spicy Garlic which we both love.  Every other time at every other Hooters, these wings are very strong with Garlic flavor with a little spice.  These wings were just the opposite.  They were overpowered with heat and almost no garlic flavor. 

My wife and I could not finish a 10 piece that we were sharing and she likes much hotter foods than I do.

Very shortly after I hung up the phone, I had two employees, one staff and one enormous security guard come to my room threatening to charge me for an extra night, and requiring that i leave the room immediately. After complying with their request, I did not want to stay another night, they refused to leave the front door when i told them I would leave right away because I needed to pack my belongings.

1538360,2006-05-01,8,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Regardless of where I was in Vegas, there was always that questionable orange Hooters tempo smacking me upside the cornea.  I look out my hotel window, my view? The hulking Hooters Casino. Walking down the strip, minding my own business, trucks with huge Hooters billboards beckon at every stop, not to mention 3/5 taxis have some form of Hooters advertising on them.  So after 4 days of constant bombardment, before heading off to the airport on day last, I decided to give Hooters a try.  It was dining misadventure.

I was seated at the bar near a group of 4 guys that came in 1 minute before me.  30 minutes later, they had almost finished their wings and I still didn't have my food.  The bargirl who took my order re-assured me a couple of time that my wings+fries would be out soon. Rrrrright.  Honestly she was more interested in checking her cell for text messages and slacking off than getting me my food.  Shortly thereafter, I just walked out, hungry & disgruntled.

1553126,2013-06-22,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I've read a lot about this place that, ""You get what you pay for,"" but that doesn't mean that I should be inconvenienced multiple times because they don't know how to run a business.  Part of running a successful business would be to make sure their customers are happy even if it is at a more ""reasonable"" price, right?

Check-in was easy, but once I got to my room, it wasn't ready.  It looked pretty trashed and the maid was just starting to clean the room.  I could understand if I got there early, but their check-in time is 4:00 and I was there about 4:30-4:45.  I went back downstairs with all my luggage and waited a good 10 minutes to be waited on so I could tell the girl at the front desk that the room she gave me was not ready.  She at least upgraded me and waived 1-days worth of the resort fee, but she was pretty unapologetic, but I was okay with it.

So with that, here's a list of good/bad/what to look out for:

Good:
-Inexpensive
-Wild Onion (I think that's the name) is pretty good and so was the service.
-Hooters Restaurant, my first time dining at one.  Wasn't too bad, but it's what I expected.
-Pool is okay to just lay out and relax.  Not like one of the party pools, but I was there during the week.
-Hooters girls at the restaurant and pool were friendly.
-Bed was comfy and decorations are okay.
-It was actually better than the Hilton (surprisingly a horrible hotel).

Bad:
-A lot of broken things (like elevator buttons or the lights to know which elevator is on its way)
-I paid a little extra for drink vouchers by the pool and $10 discount at Wild Onion.  They didn't give me the vouchers and when I asked for them they didn't ""see"" it on my reservation and wanted to see my confirmation.  I wasn't going to go upstairs AGAIN for it.  I got them after speaking with the manager, but again unapologetic and didn't really seem to care.
-AC in room was crazy loud.
-Bathroom wasn't that clean (hair still on the floor).
-Sink was clogged and a horrible screeching sound from the shower that sounds like a tea kettle once the water is boiling.
-Not enough people working in valet, so a lot of waiting around for them.
-Casino is really small.  I think they're adding on to it.
-Hotel front-desk staff are not so friendly.
-Incredibly loud if you wind up with a room with a shared door!  

Hopefully, once they're done remodeling (why they didn't do that when they opened?!) it'll be better.  But I came to find out I wasn't being picky.  During a conversation with other guests in the hotel, they noticed a lot of broken things and one said that the place is a POS and it's his first and last time staying there.  

I might stay here again, but I think I'll save next time and stay at one of the nicer hotels/casinos.",i7MOWyVWbX4rSAeQF8I9-Q,1,0,2,xjv8RH42vKA784MSffitRg

It's a regular 'ol casino/hotel w/ nothing more than hard working ladies taking care of their customers. Hotel is SMALL (which is good): everything is accessible without having to run around a maze of slot machines/shops to find a bathroom. It's easy to navigate & clean. It's DATED: meaning it's not fancy/modern. Which is TOTALLY fine with me, especially for the affordability! What I was not a fan of is the elevators: they are in dire need of repairs. We were given a 15th floor room (very nice view of the mountains in the distance & the pool below). 1 of the times in which i was in the elevator going up, it dropped by a few feet. SCARED ME TO DEATH! I avoided that elevator from then on out and told the hotel people about the incident. Hopefully they will fix/update the machinery soon, 'cause the weird noises are a sure sign of worse things to come! Besides this: the hotel is great! Unbeatable location if you are looking to be close to the south end of the strip. The MGM (which is a billion times more expensive per night) is directly across the street. Granted, the MGM has more amenities, but if you are just looking for a clean/comfortable place to sleep while in vegas, without spending all of your budget on the hotel room, stay at Hooters.

During my 4 night stay, I had the opportunity to interact with several employees. People who work at the front desk, restaraunt, maintenence & engineering and phone operators. I did not gamble and I don't drink.

It wasn't until the day before my flight that I decided to read some reviewsand all I found was negative things. it spooked me, but still, everything was already paid for so I followed through. 

I learned on youtube how to inspect a room for bed bugs when you get there. And how to prepare your belongings before you leave. Thankfully all was good. No bed bugs. At least, not in my room.

However!

When I got there my toilet was backed up. Gross! Picked up the phone and dialed 0 for the operator. There was no waiting time or music. An immediate answer. I like that. It only took the maintenence guy 5 minutes to arrive with a plunger. He had a good ense of humor about it. But the plunger wasn't enough so he went back out and in only another 5 minutes was back with a snake. Mission accomplished! He'd fixed it. He even insisted on finding something to make it smell good. More importantly, it stayed fixed. 

He did return on Friday to replace the air conditioner that was only blowing hot air. It took me 2 nights to realize it because I rarely spent time in the room and so I hdnt tried to use it. Agan great service making the call, quick response time and a quick replacement time.

The restaraunt was great. I only ate at The Onion Grill because I'm not into the greasy party food places. And so yes, The Onion Grill had decent food at a bargain price. I'm consistenly focused on improving my eating habits sincee I've been engaged in working out with P90X, Insanity, RevAbs and now moving on to Body Beast. All available at FitnessCompensation.com And being that I was on a budget, it seemed just right for me. The service was always better than Id expected. Seated quickly and never felt rushed while I was at the table. The food tasted great and was delivered quickly.

Oh.. Before I forget..
The room had a few large stains on the carpet. Looked as if the room had been rearranged or renovated. The wood lining on the walls, the mattress and boxspring under it and the wooden furnature was all new. The rug wasn't new though, and I noticed it.

In a nutshell..

A few weeks ago I went to Hooters for the first time in years and was surprisingly impressed! Parking is free which is a rare commodity on the strip. 
It was free to get into the pool area which is a huge win for me because I skip pay for pools like the plague when I don't spend much time in them. There was plenty of seating, an open area for the bar but also cocktail girls to wait on you if you didn't want to walk up to the bar. Mojito, margarita and hurricane pitchers were only $20, that's a bargain on the strip! Buckets of beer were also reasonably priced. There were a variety of games, a bit of a hipster vibe and it wasn't packed, all impressive attributes to have.  
Something happened and a few security guards showed up and continued going to the same area that no one was sitting in, seemed a bit strange but we never felt unsafe and continued about our pool day. The pools weren't too big but good enough to hop in, refresh and get back out. There was music playing and videos on a projector screen.

As for the gambling... well, I don't really gamble, but I did watch my friend turn 60 bucks on a craps table into much more, so that's good.

The Hooters Restaurant at the hotel

I've had the not so distinct pleasure of visiting a few Hooters restaurants in 2 states. While they're not known for their culinary prowess, they at least have nice eye candy. Not in Vegas of all places. We had an unattractive, pregnant server who was fortunately not in typical Hooters garb. She was also a shitty, unattentive waitress. The place was not crowded, yet she barely visited our table to ask how everything was or refill our drinks.

Surprisingly, the maids at the hotel were much friendlier. They would always say hello whenever I'd walk by. I thought this was very nice considering they're probably making slightly less than minimum wage.

The rooms -- they're not so grand, but they're decent enough.

All in all, this is a decent place to stay if you want to save some money and be close to hotels like the MGM, NY/NY, etc.",QZIKBwlPSMpzXo0GxamwTA,0,0,3,btl-uNKLta0SAXgLag9iGw

So I was in Vegas with some friends for Thanksgiving weekend and kind of booked at the last minute so everything was kind of expensive. We decided to go with the cheapest deal available and boy do we regret it. I remember seeing specials on Groupon for $20 a night at Hooters (plus a free prime rib dinner!) so I thought how bad can it be??? I've stayed at budget hotels and casinos before like the Imperial Palace (before it changed to Linq) but this is more like a trash casino than a budget hotel. First of all, the rooms are extremely old and outdated. They need to be cleaned and renovated. The carpet is old, the beds are clean but look so old and worn out. Also the place looks like it was about to fall apart. The toilet took a while to flush, the iron was busted and broken, the ceiling walls were peeling, the shower did not have a shower mat, the room did not even have a chair for the desk or a small couch inside even though there was room for one. The hallways look outdated. I did not feel like I was staying in a hotel or casino, it was a cheap dirty motel.

I won 40 on slots which is more than I ever win anywhere so I was happy.

Just fresh towels.  There was a very small balcony (not big enough for a chair) and when I opened the sliding door, it came off it track.  The room was not bad, but was in bad need of an upgrade.  Chipped tiles, rusty drain, things like that that need to be replaced.  The casino itself I like because it's small and easy to find your group.  But the customer service isn't the best.  Long waits at the bar or on the casino floor to get a drink, and about 75% of the wait staff did not seem very happy to be there.  Bottom line, this is a great hotel if you're young, don't have a lot of money, are just looking for a bed to sleep in and want to have fun in Vegas.",_31bDVZvlY7abxLt0zJh-g,0,0,3,0T_J3TI9dva1RB5NvUg6yg

Pros: Right across the street from MGM Grand. Easy access and not a far walk to the strip. Traveling to and from the hotel by car is very convenient. 

Cons: The hotel was very dirty. The carpets didn't look like they've been vacuumed. Ice machines did not work, and I had to go up one floor to get ice. When we first entered the room, I noticed upon entering the bathroom that the toilet lid in the back wasn't even closed. Drains do not work. No ice bucket in the room. When we called housekeeping to bring in us an ice bucket, they said it would take 15 minutes. 1 hour later, we still didn't get our ice bucket so we called again. Also, room doesn't come with tissue. I had to call housekeeping again for an ice bucket and tissues. Second time, housekeeping brought our stuff pretty quick. 

They have a parking structure, but the spaces are very tiny. People also tend to double park and by night time it's very difficult to find a spot that you can fit into.",XZzQgarw1RdQ9DOnFOkIhw,0,0,2,XbgylwrRyV72PnxVKBL6Jg

I thought about giving one star, but decided to give two, only because it is affordable.  I didn't expect much either because of the affordable price.  you shouldn't expect much either.

CANCELLATIONS - a few nights before, we almost had to cancel our plans to vegas .... I called really late evening (around 1130pm) to cancel our reservation, and the operator was plain rude.  we reserved through expedia and expedia gave us their confirmation number and the hotel confirmation number.  my confirmation email specifically said to cancel through the hotel, and when you click the link, it takes you directly to hooters and gives you hooters number to call for cancellation.  it also says to cancel before midnight to to avoid any other fees.  I call at 1130pm, but the rude operator told me reservations are closed at this time and I'd have to call back in the morning??  she also told me rudely that i have to cancel through expedia, and after i told her expedia directed me to hooters, that's when she told me to call back in the morning (to speak to someone who actually knew the answers).  whatever ..... thank goodness we found out our plans came through, so VEGAS HERE WE COME!!

CHECK IN - we checked in on a thursday around 5pm.  not busy at all.  of course, the girl (not lady) at the front desk didn't seem happy about working here.  not welcoming, no smile .... again, whatever .... WE MADE IT TO VEGAS!! 

HOTEL APPEARANCE - filthy elevators (garage and hotel elevators) .... the elevator doors to your hotel room are just nasty.  like housekeeping hasn't wiped them down in years .....I thought it would be wiped down by the next morning ..... nope!  filthy the whole time.  garage elevators seem like they will drop with you in it any time .... again, whatever .... I wasn't expecting much for an average $56 a night ..... 

room is ok .... comparable to motel 6 .... one of the mattresses obviously needs to be replaced ...... the first thing we noticed was that the mattress was sunk in like an elephant sat on it for a month .... 

NO HOT WATER!!!  we're trying to get ready on a saturday morning around 9am to start our day.  FAIL!! I called housekeeping/engineering .... yes, they were aware the hot water wasn't working, and advised someone is working on it.  I asked how long it would be .... ""that, I don't know""  .... again, RUDE .... at least throw in ""I'm sorry, I do apologize, but we don't have that information at this time"" .... after almost another hour of wasting the day away, I requested to use the shower in another tower (at least!!) so we can start our day.  thank goodness they were able to let that happen.  so, on with our late day in Vegas!

CHECKOUT .... I didn't bother accompanying my husband to check out just so I can encounter another unhappy employee, but I did notice on the bill that we were comped our room service and daily service fees, which made me consider 2 stars.

OVERALL .... you get what you pay for. like I said earlier, we didn't expect much, but I at least expected a decent experience.  no, I wouldn't come back, and I wouldn't recommend staying at this place, unless you like filthy establishments and rude employees.",saXYvONNMn2TKT0dyAg8OQ,0,0,2,1Gl5V60AV6qYwWxPQxfx3Q

They gave my friend and I the absolute WORST service we ever had EVERY single time we went to either of them. At least the food was fantastic.

We chose to have a smoking room so I'm assuming that's why our room looked extremely old and outdated. We only had two electrical outlets in the room; one in the bathroom and one by the end of the room near the window. Everything was unplugged as well, and being that we had limited outlets we had to sacrifice light for the sake of having our cell phones charged.  We also had no way of plugging in our TV so that option was scratched. The cheep beer made up for our frustrations, but come on..this need to be worked on.

After a few minutes of ignoring us a manager comes over to say that if we want to be served we should move because he doesn't have anyone to serve this area. So we sit there contemplating good no somewhere else when a waitress mistakenly tries to serve us 50 wings. Then another female manager comes over and asks if we've been taken care of, so we tell her no, we'd like to sit here and be served. 

Then a waitress was kind enough to come over on her own and serve us.

There is only one right answer to this question, and the answer is...NO.
Unless your answer was: MORE beer, MORE wings and MORE tittays. That answer gets you bonus points. 

This review is for the Hooters restaurant and Casino. I did not stay in a room. Nor would I, because the wood paneling and the bright orange was just too much! I imagine this elegant motif carries itself through to the rooms. Much much too demure a place for me to handle staying there. 

Hooters remains true to their motto. They stay tacky. And they own it, which is why I actually like it. The waitresses still walk around with their logo tank tops, nylon covered ass cheeks, LA Gear tennis shoes and tube socks. It comforts me to know that I experience Hooters the same way patrons did when the place first opened.

I like their wings and fried pickles, although I will admit, the food here, no matter the location, is always mediocre. Hooters keeps thier expectations low so you don't have to. Just kidding, you do. I do love the cheap beer and smorgasbord of different shapes and sizes of boobies on their best push up game. Never change Hooters.

The ONLY reason I stayed at Hooters was because it is right across the street from the MGM where I was attending a hockey game last weekend. Trust me, pay the extra $$ to stay somewhere else!! Somewhere that doesn't have stains all over the carpet, a tub that drains or cigarette burns in the duvet cover!  

The girl who checked us in was not very friendly, but the girl who checked us out was.. so it's hit or miss with the staff. Also, I thought Hooters girls were supposed to be hot?? Guess it's slim pickens in Vegas, all the hot girls are working at the Wynn I suppose.

Also, pieces of the laminate hardwood floors in the lobby and hallways are all broken up or cracked and I stubbed my toe really hard on a piece where the shitty floor meets the nasty ass casino carpet. OW! goddamn piece of shit Hooters!!

The elevators are rickety and scary sounding just as other people's reviews say, it's no lie.

The pool is tiny and the towels they give you are an absolute joke! They look like the towels they use to wipe down the bar with! and they are TINY! I'm an average size chick, I had to use 3 towels just to equal ONE normal size towel, also there are black stains all over them like some was just cleaning a car with them EEWW!!

I'm a vegetarian, so we ate one night at the restaurant ""The Mad Onion"" in the hotel.. grooooossss.

Chicken fried steak for like 3 bucks or something. A-ok in my book. My only real gripe. . . NO WIFI. none.

 Not sure in which world this qualifies as three stars. Honestly the only time I would stay here again is if someone paid me to stay...and even at that point I may have to decline. I would have to be more than vegas drunk to pay to stay here. Period.  The first thing I noticed was how MUSTY this place was. It felt like I was in a sauna. It was hot yet damp....the hallways were dark and smelled of old gym socks and cold fries.  There was all kinds of old sheets and plates, trash, etc all along the outside doors of the hallways. Like it was a ghost town. The carpets were stained and dirty. 
 Even the carpet in our room was old and dirty. I would not take my socks off and walk on this floor in fear I'd contract a disease that science has yet to discover. ...our bathroom floor was no better. The tiles looked old and stained, and the toilet was so vintage that the acrylic was peeling off inside the toilet. I didn't dare sit on that toilet, I did some serious hover action. Who knows when it was cleaned last....the shower also had some hair in it.  And the shower water  literally would go from Arctic temps to boiling water  in a matter of seconds.

Once, it was for Fleetwood Mac.

I bought my tickets for Fleetwood Mac and had the option of having a courier deliver the tickets.  The day of the event, I checked in with the front desk to see if there was anything for me on 3 separate occasions throughout the day. They all seemed either annoyed that I was asking them to work, or completely confused by the request. I was told to ask the guys at Valet because they had nothing. I call Vivid Seats to check the ETA and they inform me that the courier confirmed delivery and tell me the tickets were signed by a Brian. I go back to the lobby and ask for Brian at the front desk. It was one of the guys I had spoken to earlier in the day and he promptly hands me an envelope. This was a half hour before the show.

We had company here from out of town and he really wanted to eat at Hooter's, so we indulged him.  I had never been to this location and I won't be back.

First off, the hostess kept us waiting for about 10 minutes while they ""cleaned off a table"" (mind you, there were only 4 of us).  As we were being seated, there were plenty of empty tables so I'm not sure what that was all about.  We interacted with three different hostess/waitresses and all were very rude.  The food was terrible.  One guest in our party had the steamed shrimp for $11.49. There were maybe 12 smallish shrimp on her plate (no side dishes for this price by the way) and shelling the shrimp seemed to be a lot more trouble than it was worth.  One guest had the fish and chips - he said it had no real taste at all.  I tried the chili (which I have loved at other locations) and here it was very bland and the texture was more like a can of cat food.

All this was after a 32 minute wait for our food.  I know that because by the time we finally got seated I started worrying about the flight our guests had to catch so I was watching the clock.  Not once during this time did a waitress come to refill drinks or let us know our food was on its way.  In fact, we didn't see her at all until she brought the food out.

I tried voicing my concerns about the food and the wait but the waitress looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language and dropped off our check and walked away.  I usually give people and restaurants the benefit of the doubt but I really think unless you happen to be staying at this hotel and don't want to bother going somewhere else, steer clear.",6wzppBxKwGkIo09ndNCHyA,1,0,1,p36A2qDhGd39jmXaJZOxKg

Pros: 
it's just on the backside of the strip, not far from MGM and Tropicana. If you don't mind a little extra walking, it's in a great location, especially for the price.
The rooms have improved tremendously and are nicely redone. Spacious as well. There are also some joining rooms.
Clean
New pool area is great. It's smaller than many in the area, but they make up for it with games (beer pong, throwback games like hungry hippo, cards against humanity, and many more). It's full service and has indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a DJ from 1-6 on the weekends. 

Cons:
The AC in our first room sounded like it was going to bust. It clanked and was awful.
We ended up in a second room (couldn't stand the noise and wanted to be closer to our other party, as they were on a different floor). AC was fine, but our room reeked like weed. It's legal in NV, but they are no smoking rooms. 
The entire 6th floor smelled like weed the entire stay (7 nights).
Our party moved because they had an issue with moths coming through their vent. They had a dozen in one night. 
There is no fridge of microwave in the rooms, but there was before the remodel. Now they have to be rented per day. A fridge was $25 alone!
You can't bring any outside beverages or food to the pool. You have to purchase theirs. 


The customer service was okay. They moved us no problem and our other party, but they didn't really seem overly concerned about anything. They offered to let us move with the whole weed thing, but that would be room two, so we opted not to.

The front desk ladies are rude like they hate working there too but have no choice.

Pros: check in was quick, pool was nice, one bartender was awesome when he looked at me and said,""looks like you need a Bloody Mary and a breakfast burrito""(hungover), it was delicious. Low pice on rooms with a hotel walking distance to the strip. Decent bed with clean sheets. Casino is small but has everything you need. 

Cons: it's run down, old. Needs some renovation, updating, demolition. Wings? No good (to my taste) you'd be better with cooking frozen wings in a microwave. Food is mediocre (other than the breakfast burrito). If you're in a room over looking the pool, hope you enjoy noise. Tube TV and a game cube for ""entertainment"". Bathrooms are what you'd get at a cheap hotel. Sinks drained SLLOOWWWW...waiting for a taxi? It's quicker to walk to the MGM Grand and wait there. 

All in all, it's what you pay for. Most of the time you're not in your hotel room, so I guess you can say it's alright for the price. Although I'm gonna upgrade to a better hotel.",r_OETRG7fzrALrtZq8qQQw,0,1,2,15YZhb8uazhFex9pUc7-fg

The hooters restaurant and bars in the hotel were clean and good service. The casino was smaller but I really enjoyed the atmosphere and simplicity of it all. It was much quieter than major casino and super close to the strip and across from MGM and monorail. We cabbed or Ubered to most strip places for under $12 each time and split between 4 people it was well worth it than walking in the miserable heat. The one day/ morning we hung out at the hotel, we went to the pool and it was low key but ambiance out there was fun and super relaxing. They had games spread out and a great bar.

WRONG. This place is completely misclassified. Bathrooms are old/grimy, outdated decor, smelly sheets. The first room had a deck door/window that was unattached. Literally not attached--you could have picked up the huge panel and threw it off the roof (or have a kid run into it and push it over the balcony). There was no track to put it back on. Nothing to stop air/bugs coming in. We asked to move.

Second room was slightly better; the tv stand looked less like a $20 yard sale find, but it was still a motel-quality room.

Then we saw a bed bug. A very hungry, teenage bed bug. Sadly, I know way more than I ever want to know about these creatures, so I killed it and compared it to pictures online. It was 100% a bed bug.

We were OUT OF THERE.

We brought the dead bug to the front desk, who just kind of shrugged, said ""we normally charge one night if you leave early,"" but agreed to give us a full refund. Still haven't seen the refund (Priceline has to coordinate with the hotel).

They also give you a $100 bucks in slot credits. They put $100 bucks in a $5 machine and the max bet is 10 bucks. If you hit the jackpot, you win. If you win anything else, you get nada.

Last May 2016, Friday, around 6pm ish me, my husband and cousins checked in in this hotel. We just stayed in the room in less than 30 minutes just to settle our luggages. Since we drove far we decided to grab some dinner. When we came back to the hotel room i noticed that my SLR camera inside it's own bag was missing. I thought my husband left it in front desk while we are check-in. So we decided to run down immediately to asked the personnel in the front desk but unfortunately they said they didn't have it.

My husband can't believed that we just left all of it in the lubby since he personally handled down my back pack in the room before we left. So we run down again to the front desk and asked for help. They asked us to just report it to the hotel security. The hotel security was not also a help. They just asked me to make a report of the lost items. I asked them if they can check the hotel cameras near our room but unfortunately they said they can't do that since it was a weekend and i have to wait until monday morning and all the managers and hotel security head will come back on monday morning. We were so scared and we felt that it is not safe in this hotel since someone can sneak in anytime in your hotel room. So my husband spoke with the front desk officer and transferred us to a different room but even though we were in a different room the feeling of NOT BEING SAFE in this hotel was still there and our weekend vacation became a nightmare.

That night i send non stop message to the ipad until the person ""who said he bought it to someone"" was able to text and call me on my cellphone. The following day, i showed it to hotel security and informed them that the guy who has my ipad was willing to returned it. The head of the hotel security showed that day and assisted me to talked to the guy who returned my ipad. They videotape it while i was dealing with the guy. They promised me that they will help me since it's proven that someone sneak in in our hotel room. They gave me a phone number straight to the head of the security so i can call them to follow up my case. After that encouter, i've decided to go straight to LVPD to file a complaint. I tried to be in contact with hooters hotel head of security after we left LV but unfortunately they were not answering any of my call or even calling me back. I kept in touch with the LVPD detective but after a few months he can't give me any answer since he said he tried to go to the hotel and kept on reviewing all the security cameras near our hotel room but unfortunately the only one that was on the floor was too far from our room.

I stayed in the hooters hotel and it was 4am so I decided to order the chipotle honey wings and try something different. It was bomb.com!!!! Crispy yet covered in sauce not at all soggy. Sauce was on point and the wings were meaty. Well worth my purchase for an average restaurant.

2160989,2010-04-08,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I have been going to Las Vegas since Hooters was known as the San Remo, even though I may not been gambling at the time. When the hotel changed over to Hooters, it was actually a really fun place. It really felt like you were at Hooters restaurant just with gambling. Loved the casual atmosphere, fun girls and frankly, this kind of feeling felt perfect for Vegas. 

Now the resort was never anything special. The rooms were, and still are very small but when you were only spending three hours a day in them and you were either sleeping or showering, you did not really care. 

But now, it seems that this hotel has taken a hard turn for the worst. The fun atmosphere seems to have been replaced by people who are always angry, from guests, to pit bosses to dealers. The vibe in there is bad and you mix that in with a below-average hotel, you can see why no one stays there anymore. 

I also use to win there a lot, at odd hours, but if I played between 2AM-6AM, I can almost guarantee winning, not anymore. Not that I blame the casino for, it's the risk I take but overnight my luck seemed to have changed. Given that the hotel has had to lower its rates, you get a lot of amateur blackjack players in there now that will not play the book and frankly will screw you if you play at the same table. 

You could get an awesome craps game there if you have a cool dealer or two. 

One of my major complaints about the resort is the constant changing of the restaurants. It use to be Dan Marino's and now it is like The Angry Onion, but basically the same menu. One time a friend and I went to Dan Marino's, they got his order wrong about 4 times. I had finished my dessert before he began to eat his steak. It seems like the resort is trying to make amends to me for it and invites me back with coupons or free dinners, which is fine but they still manage to screw up the meal most of the time.  Hooters the restaurant is also there and one thing about it is that the wings seem better there than at most locations and this is coming from someone who does not like the wings. 

One benefit to Hooters is the pool is open 24 hours, which on a hot, drunk night in the summer could be a lot of fun, when the pool gets crowded, it gets crowded. The pool itself though is very beautiful, with a waterfall and fire pits. You could even stay at a bungalow near the pool, which I recommend, instead of a standard room. 

The parking at Hooters is still an issue, with valet taking a while to get your car back and self parking being in a parking lot that is way too small with way to small parking spaces. 

Hooters used to be a fun whole in the wall off-strip casino, but now it seems it is definitely going down hill.",Bkc9GEDZgOFwI2C1ky3jhA,0,0,2,v1weOwWK_ZXnuCsS83n3AQ

I've actually experienced worse. But I will express my feelings on towards a ""mediocre"" time - which is simply an A-OK for fun, food, and functionality.

Quick Note: This place will work for you and your pals if you are on a budget. Believe me, in Vegas takes your breath away as well as your cash, so for the location (which is on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana) its close to the MGM to grab the tram, New York New York to ride the coaster, and is at the beginning of the strip to begin your Bar or Club crawls. It is worth the price and accommodation of making it an affordable stay in Sin City.

My previous review is still very much valid. I will say the Pool and the Restaurants have changed. Restaurant is still OK food. The pool hours aren't 24 hours, but if you are a guest in the hotel you do have the after hour privileges. Oh and I do enjoy the Taxi Cab waiting area.. takes around 3 mins to get a cab here! Bravo! Thank you.  A+ for the cabbing efforts!!

2175090,2007-07-29,3,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Things I love about Hooters:
1. Wings. 
2. classy decor, with the signature logo (which is universally known as a sign of sophistication) and the surf-shack meets small town strip club theme.
3. Hooters girls manning the table games and wandering around the place like lost little aerobics instructors - omg, those socks make my heart race.
4. Pool - three pools of differing temperatures, sweet waterfall, and premixed tasty tropical drinks (with admittedly less alcohol than I would like). 
5. Rooms - are nice, clean, orange and have comfortable beds.
6. The Dam - A diner with a very educational theme- the Hoover Dam. Hey, it's a big deal, ok. Its an exact replica of a rocky mountain diner experience, complete with cracked-out looking waitresses in ugly gray uniforms serving decadent burgers, and they got you covered for breakfast with a great buffet. But what happened to the frosted flake french toast???
7. Sense of humor - dont go to vegas without it. While most other hotels try to convince you that simply staying there and spending your money on their casino, overpriced rooms and nightclubs make you a sexy celebrity, Hooters does not front. You know you like scantily clad, cute but not TOO attractive girls serving you onion rings and dealing your blackjack. Hooters has a sense of irony and doesnt take itself too seriously and that makes the Vegas thing more relaxing and enjoyable.
8. Did i say wings?
9. Gift store- bring the old lady home a t shirt and she'll forget about that hooker you accidentally killed during a bachelor party.
10. Dan Marino Steakhouse - need I say more?

things i could live without - dudes at the pool bar whistling every time a girl walks by (even me, so you know they arent even picky), long waits at the Hooters restaurant, room rates have increased significantly for the weekend since last summer.

Reading the reviews here kind of put me in that mind set.  However, I really enjoyed my stay here.  The room was clean, the shower pressure was good, and they cleaned my room after I left for the day.  They had clean towels on hand when I needed it and had some great complimentary stuff like water and free slot play offers. More bang for my buck: I stayed 2 nights for $32.50 a night. By far one of the lowest rates for a hotel right off the strip.  I also enjoyed the fact I could get wings from Hooters any time of the day 24 hours a day.  If you sign up with the Owl club there you can get wings for 25 cents after midnight till 6am.  Tacky and unrefined? Yes.  But if you don't mind the orange color and Florida style room this is a great place to crash at for such a low price.  I heard they filed for Chapter 11 recently so I hope this place makes it.  It really is a little gem of a hotel.  Oh yeah...they also have a great looking wait staff aka the Hooters girls.  You got to watch the introduction to the hotel on the TV when you get there...its cheesy and entertaining at the same time.  I think I watched it at least half a dozen times.

As I pull up the man ""working"" the valet was alone and he was facing the doors, back to he cars and on FACEBOOK ON HIS PHONE.   He didn't acknowledge anyone or myself or any cars.   I finally get out and walk up to him and ask if ""he's working or not?"" He scoffs and rolls his eyes, puts his phone away and takes my key.   I start to walk towards the Lyft waiting for me.  He asked if "" I want my ticket or not"" and I take the ticket and continue walking   

He then saying I can't leave the property at all.  I laugh and ask if he's serious.  I say "" I'm late for dinner, that's why I'm not going in, I have a car waiting"" he responds with "" I don't care I'll tow your car and call security"". I said "" if I was 10 min earlier, I would have gone in the casino and back out, I'll walk in and out if that makes you happy, I just have to get to dinner! "" he says "" NO.  IM GONNA TOW YOUR CAR THEN IM NOT PARKING IT!"" 

I go inside irate as all hell and raise hell.  The manager confirms we are staying here and apologizes and tell the guy to valet it.

I get back to the hotel, we talk a bit and then I  start to head out to get my car to go home.

*** I JUST took my car to he dealership and had everything checked out everything was working perfectly.**** 

I go to retrieve my car myself, and the DICK that parked my car purposely left my car on Accessory mode which was using my battery the ENTIRE time I was gone.

All of management just pointed fingers at each other to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  Finally after raising enough of a scene they called the manager that dealt with me earlier  and he told them to have someone come jump my car.

All I can say is, Wow!  I never would have though that they could have made a hotel so much like a restaurant!  The signature orange colors and wood flooring are seen throughout the casino, restaurants and rooms.  They've even got small tables and stools in the rooms like they do at the restaurant!  I never would have believed it!

The pool area looked nice, although a little rundown.  This was in Dec 2008, so it may have just been that the cold weather and the winds that were blowing through were keeping things from looking perfect.

I'd equate the rooms to a Red Roof Inn or Days Inn.  Nothing at all fantastic.  Standard, uncomplicated bedding.  Chips and scratches in the paint and signs of being somewhat rundown.  Nothing too scary, but noticable.

From what my buddy said the ""free slot plays"" are kind of cheesy.  You're required to use certain machines to play, have to play with higher amounts, and can't really make too many choices for yourself.  He was not particularly impressed.

We did nosh on the breakfast buffet on our last day (thanks 2-for-1 coupon!) and it was decent.  Much what I would expect a Hooters restaurant to serve if they served breakfast.  They also had great buffalo wing deals after 12 midnight, but by the time we were done hitting the town we pretty much just crashed as soon as we got back, and never made it to the tables.

Basically I'd say that you get what your pay for.  My buddy paid something like $39/night for the room and understood that that wouldn't be getting him a stay in a 5-star joint.  But when you're out on the town most of your trip and don't spend too much time in your room, is an expensive room worth it???",bMh2EjK8brIdU6fuw-cK9A,2,1,3,vvhF8xdJj3zAP-b8tqebwQ

I don't know why people are talking poorly of this place.  You really do get what you pay for.  It's not the MGM or Mandalay Bay - it's Hooters.

There was just a sheet and a thin quilt on the bed, so maybe more sheets would have made it better.   The room was not a mess at all, and it didn't seem like it was falling apart.  It looked older and could be renovated, but it was still nice.   All except maybe the air conditioner, but it worked just fine. 

The only bad thing was the lifts in our tower were not working, so you'd have to hike it to the next tower.  A little bit of an inconvenience, but not too bad.  I guess I wasn't drunk enough.

And there was Hooters. I found it online and the rooms were going for about $50. So we booked and were in. It took another hour for the reservation to come through and they tacked on like another $7.50 for service charges but still far less than the $150 I expected to pay elsewhere.

Our room had a nice view of the strip looking at MGM and Tropicana. It isn't a fantastic room, but it's not a bad room either. Seemed a little neglected here and there in condition but overall no complaints! The walking distance to the strip was awesome and we were soon exploring in no time. The room was just a place to crash and shower and get up in the morning to go exploring more.

I didn't bother checking out much of the Hooter's casino or restaurant. It's pretty basic and nothing exciting. Looks like a regular Hooter restaurant. Lots of good looking women of course. We checked out the next day but after a while decided what the heck? And booked another night. We wound up in a different part of the hotel and it was okay, I think the bathroom sink leaked and I am kind of OCD about the worn sheets, but again the price was more than perfect. 

I'm sure rates are even lower during the week. I would be open to staying here again. Tropicana is next door and has a lot more entertainment going on, but Hooter's has the hotel deal in town for a weekend!",dvu83QWKsnnbGvNVQ3mv7A,2,0,3,O3VupyuL_paxWZf4xC4anA

*  SLOOOOOOW check in.  There is a sign that says guaranteed same day check in.  I was beginning to question that.
*  The carpet of the hallways of the bay tower are in dire need of cleaning... last time must have been sometime during the Clinton administration.
*  The room was large.  The decor was minimal but included a cracked lampshade.  It went hand in hand with the cheap pine accents  and the dusty potted plant in the room.
*  I have no idea who their soap and shampoo vendor are but I suspect it is a bug pesticide company given the smell from both.
*  The carpet in the room was gross.  It must have been last cleaned during Bush Seniors administration.
*  The door would would not lock.
*  The sliding glass door was open and allowed the smell of fried chicken come into the room very strongly.  The bonus to this was it masked the musty odor of the room, well... at first.

Check in: Not too bad, no line at the time i came. My room was ready and i was on my way.

ROOM: Actually i upgraded for a small fee to a 1 bedroom suite with 2 full baths. The room was spacious and had plenty of seating. There was a refrigerator with complimentary water. The room had a balcony just large enough for you to step out and enjoy the view. Cleanliness was not really that big of an issue with the room i stayed in, everything still seemed in great condition since the renovation.The mattress was new and very comfortable. I will warn you about the shower though- Vintage building = vintage plumbing so the water temps fluctuate pretty unexpectedly and pretty frequently.

FOOD: I thought the food was pretty darn tasty. Prices seemed pretty reasonable as well.

SERVICE: There seems to be communication issues between departments, but overall the service was pretty gracious. There's was one guy at the Front desk in the morning who really went out of his way to show he was in the business of customer service ...

It wasn't my fault though because I booked through Hotwire. If I could go back and stay in a motel, I would choose that instead. I booked through Hotwire's ""secret deals"" so I was told my hotel was going to be a 3-Star hotel. T-h-r-e-e stars?? N-O. 

Upon entering, the hotel smelled old and had very outdated decor. The receptionist was not welcoming (I won't mention names, but you know who your angry self is). We frantically rushed to our room on the fifth floor (because I had to get ready to leave right away). Guess what? Our AC wasn't working and we let it run at least for 30 minutes. Had a maintenance guy come in to try to fix it. 110 degree weather and I had to sit in my own sweat along with this musty ass hotel. This guy was probably the nicest experience of the hotel (and why I added a star): he was friendly and assured us it'll get fixed. Okay, so I literally lost 40 minutes waiting for things to get fixed. But low and behold, our AC wasn't going to be fixed for another hour--so we opted for another room. The maintenance guy told us to not judge the new owners and that the whole hotel will get renovated soon...

The room had a funky smell. The toilet made noises when flushed and even the sink. I felt like the toilet water was going to be regurgitated out of the sink. The carpet had many stains and the tv was a blast from the past. I don't care what people say about getting what you pay for.

The Bellagio even had a better customer service for anything I had my baby's stroller by a gambling machine and the guy security came by and as nice and so polite if I could of moved because it was to close to the area kids couldn't be and even helped with his baby bags!

Price

Cons:
Resort fee - latest Vegas scam that is meaningless
Outdated - 27"" CRT TV
A/C is not temperature controlled - it's either on or off

The room was standard, but since we only spent about 3-4 hours in it altogether the whole weekend, it was okay. I got a bit aggravated when the cocktail waitresses would only come around every 30-40 min at the tables, but they were busy so I thought what the hell.

First I did not stay by choice, a special friend booked on priceline and messed it up and got this place for the ever awful price of $80 a night. Epic fail. Parking is a mess, there's a shady lot across the street that is also open for guests. 

We got a double room, went up, it smelled like mildew and the carpet was wet in spots. Seriously? Tile around toilet was multi-colored, not in the good way. It looked like pee stain around the base of the toilet, but it was the messed up tile color. Hole/crack in the sink, way ghetto. We complained, they ""upgraded"" us to the 15th floor, same room, and gave us some drink coupons for the pool. Tiny beds, halfway between twin and full. Two small Asians in the bed was uncomfortable. Tub/shower clogged and took forever to drain. Cheap tv, no flat screen. But the carpet was better.

First time going out we were going down the elevator and this two white trash guys get in with us holding a blunt. Reeked of weed, they start harassing my friend who's on the phone with her family. I tell them to back off and chill and all I remember was them yelling ""Merica."" Really? Nice clientele. As we were walking out of the casino behind them, one of these classy gentlemen mooned us bare ass and all. Nice. 

The only saving grace about this place was the pool. Surprisingly nice, and the free drink we got helped. Get the rum frozen drink. Nice and strong.

So I was originally going to stay at the Sahara... that's where I usually stay... it's cheap, easy, and on the strip.  But I saw the prices were comparable here (average of $50 a night, holiday weekend) and decided to give this place a try.

Things I like about this place:

~ You actually win in this casino.  My only thought is that it's like that because it's not on the strip.

~ The $1.50 Bud/BudLight/Bud Lime!  The best thing about the whole place.  The other beers cost $5.50. Yikes.

~ Photos of hot chicks everywhere.  Funny tho... I didn't actually see any hot chicks.  Except the one chick running cocktails to the gamblers... but she was the only one.

~ The beds are pretty soft and comfy.  Pillows leave something to be desired tho.  Bring your own if you are picky about your pillows.

~ The view I had... I was in the Oceanview tower and I wasn't facing the pool... I was facing the strip.  So I had this great view of the Luxor, New York New York, MGM, Excalibur... it was nice.

Things that left me wondering ""WTF?"":

~ The drainage issues, as mentioned in other reviews.

~ The batting in the comforter on the bed was all weird... it's like it was a duvet that wasn't properly attached or something.

~ The parking garage elevators.  I swear, we thought we were going to die in those things by falling through the floor or something.

She continued to talk with multiple customers as my food was sitting there in front of her. She easily could have said here's your food but made me wait an unreasonable amount of time for some bizarre reason. She obviously didn't like me or something even though I was extremely polite with her. I never write reviews but this girl's behavior was just ridiculous and unacceptable.

Now, let's get this out of the way to begin with:  The whole idea of Hooters is pretty offensive to my sensibilities to begin with.  My expectations were pretty freakin' low when I got pulled in there behind 2 of my more machoesque male friends.  I was strangely nicely surprised.

Yes, there are Hooters girls everywhere and I could do without the little orange shorts.  It's also really, really bright in there thanks to the amount of orange everywhere.  It's just a really orange place; aptly enough, the club there is called Orange as well although it would probably take roofies to get me in that place.

However, it had 3 things that I really liked:  1) The martini bar.  It was great!  The atmosphere isn't the exact thing I always go for, but I felt comfortable there.  Happily enough I discovered a college friend was the manager so I got some free libations.  2)  The pool!  It was February and we made our way out to the pool just because and to our delight found a fire pit set back from the deck with seating around it.  It was delightful!  3)  There was a bar inside with dueling pianos.  Not as impressive as the ones at the NY, NY but less crowded and with less expensive drinks.

We left and once we came back we got stuck in the elevator packed with people for about an hour! Couldn't get any air! The moment we got out they asked if we were okay and sent us back to the room and offered to give us free breakfast. As we go upstairs to our room there's FRESH blood on the sheets! We specifically told room keeping not to enter our room and then our sheets are covered in blood! We called manager and they changed the sheets and covers however they forgot to leave the extras we had ordered. Then i call for them to bring back blankets. They rudely denied my request and hung up on me. At this point i just wanted to leave. To top it off the AC made a loud noise and stopped working.

My fiance and I had were staying one night, since we had Friday + Saturday off. He bought the room off of Groupon for about $100. Anyways, upon arriving to the room, I noticed the room had a nice view of the Strip. Once I opened the curtains, we noticed there was a large crack/hole on the window along with some lipstick kiss marks on it, too. EEW.

We ignored it, since we are just staying one night.

Once we left and arrived home, I decided to go through my bank statement. To my surprise, I noticed the hotel charged me about $162. Now, he payed for the hotel with his card and I payed a $20 fee with my card, so whats this charge about?

When we called, they said it was for the broken window, WHICH WAS NOT OUR FAULT!!!!

We explained to them what happened, but all they did was give us attitude, mute us, put us on hold while we were still talking. We eventually spoke to the manager, Lily, and even she gave us attitude, basically saying ""Do you want me to help you or not?"" . All they did was give us a number to contact some guy, but we have to call on Monday to get everything situated .

The room was pretty bad, but like I said, we weren't going to complain since we were there for 1 night and leaving in the morning, After this ordeal, I have to complain!!

The bathtub was slightly stained, the broken window with no screen, the tv was those old big box ones with a fuzzy picture, there was even a carpet stain next to the tv entertainment center, the sliding door for the closet wasn't event attached properly. 

Unbelievable!! How is it that no one noticed the broken window previously??? The customer service was HORRIBLE !!!!!!!! I understand that we were upset, but the fact that they did not try and help out is unacceptable. 

Pros:
- Right off the strip. You can walk there.
- Cheap

If you can get a good deal on the rooms, it's a pretty sweet value (check on Groupon or Priceline). I highly recommend asking for a King room if you're only traveling as a pair - the Double rooms are considerably jankier, no idea why. Spent one night in each and it was like night and day. 

It seems to be overlooked by many reviewers what the theme of this hotel is. Yes, hooters, but also cheesy 1980's decor - the clock radios your parents have, the Zenith TVs, and the wood-paneled headboards are part of the kitsch. Were you expecting the Wynn? LOL You're in *Hooters*! The girls are still wearing white sneakers and orange shorts, for crissakes. 

Speaking of which, I didn't actually see very many Hooters girls, maybe two the entire trip aside from the girls running the tables. The casino floor stays busy, even at 5 am, and people are rocking the pool during the day, even in January. A few too many families with little kids for my taste, but what can you do. Maybe Hooters has finally eclipsed Disneyland.

In a pinch and with a deal, I'd come back in a second. Walking distance to the south Strip, right across the street from the MGM Grand for shows, etc., and has a couple decent restaurants inside. Check it out!",d8z9uG3SHTgkCNj5iVcG8w,13,6,4,WYSuemtnwQyWv7D9V-wQNQ

This stay was one of the worst I have had, and as a professional hospitality review writer, I can say I have hundreds of experiences to compare. 

Hooters Hotel and Casino has the lowest service standards. The staff over at front desk do not acknowledge guests upon arrival nor do they engage in friendly conversation. They do not smile or greet the guest, neither for check in, for any request, or for check out. They assume the guest should know the drill, as they do not explain anything in the process, and limit themselves to directing orders, ""Credit card and ID"", ""Initials here, sign here and here."", ""Room number"", and ""Your room is not ready, come back after 2"". Resort fees were not explained (although I knew about them), nor stated in the check in form signed.

Check out process was fast but unfriendly. I was not asked to which card I wanted my room settled, so they charged my personal card on file rather than allowing me an opportunity to put it on my company card and expense it, so I guess this stay is on me. I was given a receipts only for the resort fees, but the staff never mentioned anything about how to get my final receipt for the room. They did not allow me to verify the charges before actually checking me out and charging the card. Staff should know about hospitality, friendliness, smiling, acknowledging, and treating the guest in a respectful way.

Room 708. The room was overall in bad shape. In the restroom, fixtures were in decadent condition, looked dirty and ill maintained. Every time the shower was used it leaked water and flooded the bathroom. The toilet was not operating correctly and the guest must verify that after flushing it, the lever would return to its place, or actually do it manually. Water pressure in the shower was below standard. The shower head was not operating correctly. In the room, walls were dirty. One of them had dried snot over a 1 X 3 feet area at a visible location, at head level. They were not removed during my stay. The TV as air conditioning units were old. The TV malfunctioned, had snow, static noise, and sometimes no sound at all.

The restaurant had terrible service as well. The ladies working it have no sense of good service. They are actually rude and never smile. Service was slow and quality of food was substandard.

The price paid for both, food and lodging were too high for the overall experience and quality of service.

It is sad seeing that most employees appear to be bored, frustrated, unhappy, and annoyed. Going into Hooters Hotel and the restaurant is like walking into doomsday or purgatory.",Asih9_etVzxY919GMiq_DQ,0,0,1,lTKmds08dwt19q31eaqsQw

The room had the basics: looked modern, nice big flat screen, and was clean. 

The coolest part was the outdoor pool area.  I might choose to stay here again based on this. It had so many awesome games. There was pool for $2/ game. And free ping pong, beer pong, giant beer pong, giant connect four, foosball, and cornhole! It had a huge tv playing football and my gf and I enjoyed our time out here in between gambling and partying. When we checked in they gave us two free drink tickets at the pool, too.

Location: it's truly right off of the strip, and a great area. The MGM is literally right across the street, about a 4-5 minute walk door to door. I would say about a 10 minute walk to NYNY or Excalibur. It's also way easier to call an Uber here than the other hotels, and a lyft line was only $3.30 each way to the Venetian and the Mandalay Bay.  Parking is included in the $26 resort fee 

The casino: I couldn't find any pics online and I was worried it would be small and/or sketchy. It was as big as you need a casino to be honestly. They had everything.

We'd think of something we needed, then it was like she read our minds, and two minutes later it was on our table the next time she stopped by to check up on us. No matter what it was, straws, forks, plates, to-go boxes, the whole nine yards, we didn't have to ask for a thing. even the bartender checked up on us a couple times, and asked if we needed anything, but there Tammy was right behind her with whatever we needed.

We were attending the Pac 12 basketball tournament (Go Cats!) at the MGM Grand and so therefore the location was perfect.  The price was pretty impressive too considering it was spring break and St Pattys Day weekend.  

The rooms were spacious and clean, nothing spectacular, but that was expected coming into it.  For the most part things were quiet and had no problems relaxing in the room.

A couple negatives were that these bright lights shined on the hotel right outside our window at night.  The lights were the ones that shine on the hotel itself.   We actually had a pretty impressive view of the strip but was somewhat ruined by the blinding lights that flooded our room.  Luckily, great window shades were provided.  The other negative was the TV was rather outdated.  Having a flat screen put in would have been nice.

Me and my boyfriend stayed 4/4-4/6/15, I got a groupon deal that included free slot and table play and also a buy one get one free breakfast along with, I think, two other coupons. It was a good deal. 

It's rather close to everything, literally right across the street from MGM Grand. It's a small hotel but everyone's pretty friendly. I didn't have anyone ""stalking"" me and my room wasn't dirty or anything. Some appliances were old but you get what you paid for. We had no problem with the sink or the tub so maybe we were the exception. 

I liked the vibe, we had some good luck at the slots, as well as the tables. They have $5 blackjack as well as a $3 table hidden inside of the casino. 

I'd advise against shopping in the convenience store as it's a bit over priced. Stop by a liquor store or find a grocery store to get your water or goods. 

I LOVED the wings. I've never tried Hooters wings and it was my first time but I was happy. They were nice and crispy and nicely sauced. I tried the spicy garlic and chipotle honey. The spicy garlic was good but SOOO spicy the chipotle was perfect. I probably lived off wings that weekend I was there, hahaha. I also tried their soup, broccoli cheddar which was eh, really soupy not thick like other places. 

For sure, I want to try the Mad Onion next time I'm there. 

To be honest, we weren't in the room a lot, just when we were sleeping and resting from the endless drinking and gambling or after shopping.

We ate in the hooters resturant like we usually do when we visit the casino. So we ordered out food, Curley fries with cheese sauce for an app, Philly Steak and Cheese no onion for my girlfriend, and 10 wings breaded mild for myself. 

About 20 mins after we ordered all the food came out at once. The fries were ice cold and hard as a rock, my girlfriends sandwhich had onion on it and my wings were over cooked as per usual on a slow night. We have to stop a hostess to find our waitress ( who was horridly miserable) to come over. My girlfriend sent her food back and after about 10 more mintues she get her food. 

She goes to move her pickle out from under her fries (because come on who puts a cold pickle under fries right?!), and much to both of our surprise there is a 3 inch long piece of black hair stuck to her pickle. So we call the manager to come over. 

We explain the situation to David, and he offers to remake the food for a third time and claims to see no hair after I pick up the pickle and show it to him. We say no we dont want to we want to leave. So he says were more than welcome to leave our food has been comped. 

So we leave as we are leaving, I see David talking to another guy who keeps looking over at me, and nodding his head so I stop. David walked back over to me, and I asked what the problem was. He said nothing but you are more than welcome not to return to the resturant. I asked him why he said oh because we obvisiouly cant make you people happy. Ok fine. 

I go back today and speak with Bill the general manager. He also tells me every time you people are in here theres always an issue. You are always talking to a manager or complaining about something. It would be in your best interest not to come back.

The first was when the USA 7's International Rugby Tournament was in town and the opening night party was at the Hooter's pool. They did a good job of accommodating all of the wild partying. They even set up long tables for beer pong, flip cup and the like. Despite the freezing temperatures and the need to huddle under the outdoor heaters or in the hot tub, Hooter's did a good job keeping everyone happy.

The second experience was the next day when I went up to my friend's room (we were staying at the Motel 6 next door... see other review). I was expecting a trashy room with Hooter's orange all over the furniture. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, clean and did not smell like too many bad nights. The dark oak furniture and modest bedding gave the room a much classier look than the hotel's name would suggest. 

Fast forward 4 months when a friend and I booked a room at Hooter's for a 2-night stint in Sin City. We arrived mid-afternoon about an hour after check-in. We were checked into a room on a high floor with a partial mountain view and full pool view. After a long trek down the hallway to the very end, we couldn't get the key card to work. The lights on the door wouldn't even light up (red or green). We tried slow, fast, leaving it in, everything imaginable. 

Finally, I went down to the front desk and asked for a new card. Same problem. I went down again. New card. Same problem. My friend went down. New card. Same problem. Finally they sent a security guard up to help us. He tried our card and had the same problem (duh). Then several other guards showed up to help. So if you have ever wondered how many security guards it takes to open a hotel room door, the answer is 4. Our room key still didn't work so he finally tried his universal swipe card and gained access without a problem. He said that they have been having problems with this door all week. -Isn't that something? They knew the door didn't work but still decided to assign us to the room. - He then wished us well and started to leave. ""No, wait!"" I shouted from the bedroom area. I explained to him that we would still be locked out of our room without a working key card and door. We had no intention of staying in the room all weekend. We needed a working key. He seemed surprised like he hadn't thought of that. He said he would go down and take care of it. We hung out in the room and started getting ready for our night out as we were still in our comfy driving clothes. 

He returned 20 minutes later with a luggage cart and new room keys for a different room. He asked us if smoking was okay and we reluctantly agreed after we were assured that the smoke smell isn't that bad. 

He helped us haul our bags down to the new room and made sure the new keys worked. However, the room was practically dripping in cigarette stench. The whole ordeal had worn us out and the security guard was already going above and beyond his job description so we kept our mouths shut and thanked him.

They should have upgraded us to a suite for wasting our time and trying our patience but they insisted all of the suites were booked. I actually believe them because they only have a few. They are not a mega resort with entire floors full of suites.

The room was not as nice as the one my friend had been in despite the fact that it was the same rate level. Oh well, whatever. The shower was nice.

We finished getting ready and wandered down to the Hooter's restaurant. Not our first choice but after 5 hours in the car and 2 hours getting into the room. We were in town for my friend's birthday and the waitresses sang to her even though she asked that they didn't. Serves her right for even mentioning it. The server we had was the token pregnant Hooter's waitress. She was very nice and friendly. Her being pregnant and not trying to flaunt her sexuality (they even have special clothes for the preggo chicks) probably made her the best server because she focused on the customer instead of just exploiting tips from horny, drunk guys.

After that we didn't do much in terms of using the hotel or casino. We went to other pools for our daytime lounging and other casinos to feed our addiction and other clubs to dance the night away. We slept and showered at Hooter's but that was about it.

Oh yeah, the parking garage is the best bet when parking although the elevators down to the casino are very dirty, smelly and frankly - just scary. The valet is very slow and definitely not worth the effort. You can stop in the valet station and no one will acknowledge you for 10 minutes. I swear. It has happened to me 3 times out of 3 attempts.",FpTuy9U92NKcr9YI__TT1g,0,1,3,wlARBeqinx35JYBu7ZTk0w

The hotel and casino are relatively small so everything is conveniently located, just a hop, skip and a jump from your room to the casino to the pool or parking garage. The prices are a hit or miss, sometimes they have really great deals and sometimes they are just downright terrible. They have a 24 hour gift shop (located next to the elevators of the two towers of the hotel) that has munchies, moonshine and gifts, which is nice. They have a few restaurants which are open a little late but do close so if the tummy starts to growl after a night of partying you might want to grab something to eat on the way back to the hotel or you'll starve. There really isn't anywhere to party in this resort. It is more of a gamble, sleep, repeat kind of place.

Having said that, while the girls here are very attractive, they're definitely not as engaged as just about every other Hooters I've been to. That's a big one since part of the Hooters experience is how friendly the girls are. While the wings are just as good as the other Hooters, the menu does not give you the option of having your wings Daytona style, another thing that separates Hooters from other wing places. All in all, the only thing going for this Hooters is its convenience and proximity to the Strip.

For one king bed. So for two ""queen size beds"" (it's actually full size beds), we had to pay additional $10 a night plus tax AND resort fees ($35 a night). So be aware of this if you're using Groupon!!

The room itself isn't bad! I wouldn't mind coming again. The beds itself was comfortable, the AC worked perfectly fine but it's super loud, the bathrooms were outdated and had a hard time keeping its water temperature. But it had a TV with good shows! We had the strip view, the view was okay not worth the extra money but I'd rather choose strip view over pool view as it's louder cause of the music at the pool! 

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again. It is definitely a FAR walk from the middle of the strip like Caesar's palace and Bellagio.

-Cheap Rooms
-Walking distance to the Strip
-Perfect location if you are going to see a show/eat at MGM or go clubbing at Hakkasan 
-Can eat wings anytime of the day

Improvements:
-The rooms are quite outdated, but considering the cost of the room (about $22 per night on a weekend), the outdated-ness didn't really bug me. In fact, the rooms were surprisingly nicer than I thought they were going to be! 
-The room was fairly clean. Not sparkly clean, but definitely clean enough to stay in.
-The elevators were quite old, especially the parking lot ones. At times, my friend and I thought we might get stuck. 

Would I recommend?
-If you are planning a last-minute Vegas trip like my friend and I did last month and will most likely be out and about and not in the room, then I definitely recommend you staying here!

Off the strip prices, on the strip hotel. Very affordable casino, great for the budget minded partier like me. Cheap beers, low limit card tables, fast cocktail service (don't forget to serve these cuties tip!). After doing my typical casino tour of the nice hotels when visiting Vegas, this place surely stood out (don't call me Shirley!). 

The craps table had a dingy orange surface, the leather around the table was ripped, there was dust accumulating between the craps board and the dice cushion, the floor boards were falling apart, and the list goes on. But after a few drinks I didn't mind. The dealers were down to earth and friendly, the seats were comfortable, and the waitresses were prompt with my drinks and cute in their short shorts. 

I like to sit at the $10 Pai Gow table which is right next to the bar where the waitresses get their drinks. Granted it was a slow night but I must have got 5 drinks in 15 minutes, even turning down a few drinks! 

2-stars if you're sober, 3-stars if you've taken advantage of their drink specials. 2.4-sounds about right. I wont tell my friends I look forward to coming here, but Hooters will always be in the back of my mind.",iCnEsWkoAkda5aunpXm1iw,0,0,2,RgTAZBK-rGDp9e6Yeuwhgw

Hi,
I refused to give 5 stars due to the ladies employees at the front desk looked at me as I entered the hotel and yet they did not acknowledge me (it was 3am they were too busy with their conversation). Once I walked in front one lady I asked is there a way I can pay extra for an early check-in? She stated ""yea about 7am that reservations come in at 6am"". She offered no gel or assistance at all. 

However, I ended up walking over to the Hooters restaurant where I met Krystal! When I say that my time spent was well worth it, this is one of my best restaurant experiences. She made sure I was satisfied with my order, if I wanted anything else, she continued to check on me as good 
waitresses should. Her customer service was over the top, she was awesome. 

Room Update: 7/9/15
The room all summed up that was given to me was horrible! The Manager was not on duty but I will contact him/her. I did however speak with Dinora (Hotel Sup) about my experience and the room. She apologized for the inconvenience and the removed fees that were charged for the room. This hotel should not have a resort fee at all. I try to to find the good in anything and after staying here... I just can't wait to get home and shower. Hopefully if anyone is planning on staying here come after September 2015, they are supposedly renovating.

The casino part is small. I played for a couple of hours and the employees I encountered on this end we're very polite and great personalities.

We only got a 10 piece with the Daytona we know we like, but would've ordered more if we had that option! We had the buffalo dip too. The food was really good, no problems there, but just for the absolutely terrible awful service you get one star. It took forever for us to get greeted, we sat down and I went to the restroom & when I got back my fiancé still hadn't been gotten to!! I don't think our waitress smiled once, and she only came to the table to take our order & give the check. She never checked to see if our food was ok, and we left cash because I figured if we had to wait for her to run a credit card we would've been there forever.

Stay away from the casino.

Cheap is nice but I've been disappointed. I spent some time and money at the craps table today and I think they might be playing dirty pool. I was about 10 minutes into a roll, shooting for an 8, when I made the point. The dealer paid out myself and several others on a clearly marked 8, however as we are reaching for the money another manager told him to take all of the money back as one side of the table was marked with a 6 and our side the mark was on 8. No further explanation was given. On opening roll I was told the point was 8, dice read 8 on the first roll, I rolled an 8 for the win, but the casino didn't pay out.

The pool area is easily the best part of this hotel. It's so relaxed and calm, even if the occasional airplane or helicopter flies overhead. If you're done gambling and drinking, this is a good place to chill and catch some rays.

Could be a brand new business grad (or pre-major student) running that place for the service we got.

Pretty much it was always ""What's next?!""  Most staff just really didn't care and also didn't have adequate resources.

-Signs pointing to other parts of room floors were ON PAPER WRITTEN BY HAND lol
-Toilet hadn't been flushed when we got to room.  I had to kinda push to get any kind of compensation for that disgustingness & the front desk didn't go out of their way to be sincerely apologetic.
-Toilet flushed *really* slowly
-Sink barely drained at all. Would overflow if you let it run.
-One day, maids only cleaned bathroom and didn't even make the beds or empty trash.
-Everything in bathroom was in short supply.
-Asked for more towels-never delivered

-Room windows seem like they were picked out of an on-sale catalogue.  They were sliding glass doors.  Ours opened easily..onto what looked kinda like a roof area but did have a balcony-type wall--not an edge-- that looked down into the pool.  It was weird, but hey, the door opened and there was no sign anywhere that said we couldn't be there.  Sure enough though, my buddy gets yelled at by security for being ""on the roof,"" so he goes back inside, and immediately we get an upset call from the front desk about it.  At this point we were both a little frustrated & short tempered w/the service and my buddy hung up on them.  Moments later, two security guards knock on our door about it-one of them's menacing, and my buddy tells them he doesn't want them coming into the room to fix it (turns out Hooters' solution for using sliding glass doors instead of windows was to put one little screw in that locked them-somebody else must've taken our screw out)-get us a new room at this point.  The jerk security guard tells us it's ""fix it or you're evicted!""  So I call the front desk and get us a room change for all the difficulty already.  In the mean time, my buddy closes the door on them while I make the call, and the jerk one says ""You're lucky these doors don't slam or you'd be evicted!"" Also patronized & accused me of lying/being an idiot about not knowing we weren't supposed to be out there.  The door opened freely man and we were out there for 2 minutes!  That goes on till we get a new room, and they bring even more security guards.

-Got a package delivered to hotel-even emailed Hooters ahead of time about it-and it took them a whole day/night to get it from where it was delivered to the bell desk where I could pick it up. What!? Ridiculous and unacceptable. Staff made it seem standard.
-Bell desk didn't always answer, would go to a standard cell-phone type voicemail that hadn't been personalized/recorded at all. Voicemail went unreturned.  
-Want clothes laundered? Deliver em downstairs yourself! No slip or pick-up in room, even though the room guide says to the contrary.
-TV only worked sometimes.
-No fridge
-Doors didn't close fully on their own-dangerous.
-No button for front desk on phone (had to request extension from operator), staff had to ask for my room # every time, & different desks weren't on the same page about who was going to have my package.
-Food options very limited.  To Hooters pretty much.  Got the same menu item twice-once was really good, next time not very.  Fried pickles were terrible & I love fried pickles.  Service in restaurant bar area was very (light) hit or (hard) miss.
-Bar area music the first afternoon was so depressing that we changed our order to to-go.
-Late check-out only offered with a call AFTER 7 AM, and by the time I made the call in the AM, they said no.

Positives:
-Blackjack tables & low minimums.  Some dealers still were so-so or straight moody, but the cute ones tended to be a lot of fun personality wise AND yes, as eye candy.  Find brunette, (white) Jennifer!  She made me money literally every time I sat down with her.  REALLY fun dealer & gave me the best blackjack run I've ever had.  Like I said, Jennifer: Tiffany's or Jared's?  You're the only one for me!
--Even there though, some of **the other** dealers and floor staff were having issues.  More dealing flubs than I'd seen & some weird table security (I think) drama going on.
-Restaurant cover band ROCKED IT
-Friendly, helpful bell desk guy",-YMEqXEONX4KIRA4kJXClw,1,0,1,yOugyhFUtXCiz0bTdL3ZZg

Stayed here for two nights because of an internet ""deal"".  

There is a view of KLAS airport on one side and construction on the other side of the hotel.

I got the room for only $20.00 per night and  the ""resort fee"" of $8.00 per night.  I still don't get the ""resort"" fee!  What resort????

  Hooter's is everything you might expect and more  If you're expecting a place that is  grungy, dirty and lacking any class.  Hooter's Casino is run down and in my opinion really gives their restaurant chain a worse reputation.   

   The biggest reason for the low star rating is that the room I stayed in (1233) was INFESTED with bed bugs. 
  I've never  seen bed bugs in my life until this stay.  The bugs got into my suit case and clothes.   I had bites all over my body.   I had to go through ALL of my things including my suitcase and shoes and have them bagged and washed before returning home.    The carpets had stains and the room smelled bad.  There was pubic hair on our ""new"" sheets!

 I would  only consider staying at this hotel again IF you paid me $2000 per night!  That way I can hire a cleaning service to replace the bed, bedding, carpet etc... and have a bit left over.   I don't want free wings or a room comp etc...

The hostesses do not know anything. We were told that we could bring alcohol in but then the manager came up to us and impolitely mentioned we are not allowed to open anymore beer bottles. (Which we had purchased from the restaurant early morning.) I don't know the hiring process at this restaurant but they should reconsider the people they hire. I work at a very upscale restaurant and I can promise you we would never treat our guests the way I have been treated here.

3254946,2012-10-16,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"If your looking for a clean, low budget place ""on the strip"" this place isn't too bad. Just don't expect a lot from a old hotel ""renovated"" to look like a Hooters restaurant (A little Vegas trivia, Hooters Hotel and Casino used to be The San Remo).

When I go to Vegas I usually look for a few things in my hotel: Easy access to other casinos and activities, a clean room (clean sheets, floor, bathroom) and close walk to elevators.

Other things I like in my room that are nice but not necessary: Wi-Fi, a nice view (strip, the pool, etc), flat screen tv.

Hooters Hotel and Casino isn't exactly close to any other casinos other than MGM (across the street but still a 10 min walk) and Tropicana (next door)

The room, although not fancy was clean and comfortable, small tv (no problem, I'm not in Vegas to watch TV), wired internet (no wi-fi in the rooms or casino) didn't even work (not too big of a problem, but when you have to pay for a B.S. ""Resort Fee"" that includes internet, that all the hotel/casinos are charging these days (except Caesars (Harrah's) brand of hotels in Vegas), I'm not too happy. My friend did, at the end of the stay, talked to the front desk about getting the Resort Fee taken off because our internet didn't work in the room and was successful in doing so. 

The casino downstairs is very small, The dealers (dressed like the Hooter girls you see in the restaurants) are fun and make it a fun place to play on a small budget. They do have a $3 Blackjack table, which as the one and only $3 table can be hard to get to sit down on especially on a weekend.

As a frequent visitor to Vegas, I won't be staying here again anytime soon, but if it was my only option, it's not too bad.",DJWvvie6YTka5ylcqMIXvg,1,1,2,XATvE4aF0jmAMKVQTwLxAA
3255208,2017-02-27,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"The room is what you would expect for the price.  We stayed in a King size, non-smoking room in the Bay View on the third floor.  The room was clean and spacious.  We had view of the pool out the sliding glass door and realized that the sliding door could open if unlocked.  Not sure if that was meant to be opened, I'm pretty sure it could be a safety issue, even though it was only the 3rd floor.  But back to the room...The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really soft. The was a Keurig Machine with 2 K-Cups, full-size ironing board, plenty of towels, a blow dryer. My biggest complaint was about the 1.5 inch gap underneath the door that separated the our room from the next.  You can see light peering underneath and you can absolutely HEAR EVERYTHING that the people in the next room were doing.  There must have been about 4 people in that room and they were having some kind of wresting matches and listening to loud music. In most Hotels, the sound would have been muffled or absorbed...but not this room.  I'm pretty sure if I would have peeked underneath the door, I would've been able to see what was going on.  I threw the extra blanket on the floor, for my own privacy, but it did nothing for the sound.  
There is supposed to be $1 Blackjack here, but there are only like 2 tables.  Most of the people that work here are friendly and look like they want to be there.  One issue with Valet was when we came back on early Sunday morning, around 12:30 a.m., they told us they didn't have any parking spots available for our van....what? Why do we even pay resort fees for? There was absolutely no parking anywhere, and after seeing how annoyed I was, they quickly found a solution to leave it parked outside near the Hooters truck.  

Overall, the hotel is decent for the price. It's clean and the beds are comfy. One more thing...this place does not have a cancellation policy. You basically lose your money if you can't stay on the night you reserved.  You cannot change your date, you cannot get a refund. This is probably the main reason I will not stay here again.  They were not very accommodating in that area.",uPlspWGOMWh1DF0E5ACYag,2,0,2,izHmP3MCOPj7oea3ZIWbmw

The pool area is a blast. Nothing like getting some hot wings & laying out in the sun! So refreshing. 

The only thing I didn't like is when we were checking in, the receptionist was not so nice. There was a mix up in booking the room under my husband & we have the same last name & everything, I was able to show her the email on my phone, & my husband was still required to fax his ID after speaking to her on the phone himself when it was already so late & we had work so early the next day.

Where I have seen the biggest improvement is the rooms ! They are equipped with Kureig coffee machines, and Bath and Body Works toiletries. Everything seems updated.

The only thing that bothered me was the hallways and the elevators- as they look like they haven't been updated since the 80s.

The Girl, her parents, The Boy and I are in Vegas- I insist on going to Hooters for dinner one night because I'm tired of all the foofy places that have been being suggested. We have a minor with us so we have to wait for a table in the kid's section, no big deal- I had no problem waiting.

What sucked was our waitress- I guarantee that she thought that because we weren't drinking and because we were sitting in the family section that she wasn't going to make money off of us- what she doesn't know is that I am a notoriously generous tipper...she should have tested the water instead of ignoring us, getting our order wrong and then trying to scam us.

They tossed The Boy's wings in the same sauce as mine- I ordered 3 Mile, he ordered BBQ- HUGE difference- when I pointed it out she didn't even apologize- just whisked them away and brought new wings. TWICE I had to go find her to bring us refills on our drinks- and then at the end of the night she charged us for things we didn't have and brought us some imprint of my credit card to sign...she brought me a BLANK imprint of my credit card to sign- no total, no nothing, just a blank license to take as much money as she wanted from me. I don't think so darling.

It is pretty cheap and close to the strip, but the hotel itself and the rooms are pretty old and not very well maintained which is the main issue with this place. I would say that it has a lower than average price/quality ratio since I believe that you can find better deals in Las Vegas.

The hotel amenities are acceptable, but it lacks a club and a day club which most other hotels on the strip or close to the strip do have. The fact that it is close to the strip partially offsets that, since it is pretty easy to go to the MGM or to other hotels that do have clubs and day clubs. The casino area in the hotel is also very small compared to other ones on the strip or around downtown Las Vegas.

The parking lot is free, like any other one in the strip area, but it is a little far from the hotel's entrance so I would definitely recommend using the bellboy for your luggage.

The Food: Eh, it's okay. I did try the Hot Wings and I really don't understand people's obsession with them.  The greasiness really just overtakes the chicken flavor. I really disliked that they charge $1 for side-sauce. C'mon! Wings + ranch is a must, therefore they must be sold together, not separate. For shame. 

The Service: Was on point! Our waitress Karen got everything out on a timely manner & was really nice to us ladies.  

The Girls (because isn't that why men come here?): Not as bad as I imagined.  After going to the Tilted Kilt, the Hooters uniforms are saintly. I'm not sure whether a man or woman designed the outfits, but I'm guessing a man did because they're definitely a throw back to the 90's.  The girls looked like my 90's barbie dolls, you know, Theresa, Barbie, Staci with the scrunchy socks and high waisted shorts.

Their minimum bets were 3 bucks. Luckily i had 30ish dollars and that let me gamble for quite a while; about two hours.

The service was really poor even though there were six seated (I had to add the word seated because an employee said I was lying by saying 6 tables) tables in the entire restaurant. I swear the sauces were canned from Sysco and the onion rings are frozen. I am truly amazed that an establishment like this can stay in business!
Follow up... I was contacted by the hotel informing me it was recently sold and scheduled for renovation.",8w9EalPi60iI_0XgQShalw,0,0,1,UPCqoPlrHLQyQyGRb9mzJg
3325845,2010-05-27,3,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Okay, we went here for one reason (in January 2010), and that reason was that it was cheap at the time for a Saturday night, vs the Palms where we were staying the night before.   So there wasn't a big expectation and Hooters happily enough obliged in not making one.  

 As a previous reviewer noted, the parking garage really is a good indicator of what this hotel is about.   It was smallish and cramped when driving up to find a spot there were great puddles of water on the floor, never mind that the floor we stopped at was about the 4th.  We parked away from the elevator to ensure we had plenty of space and got in the little death trap of an elevator that takes you to the casino.  I say death trap because it rattles, groans, creaks and really does a great job at making you feel like it's going to drop any moment.   Then when we got off the elevator and avoided being smashed by people looking to scurry away from here, we found that it was a modest sized hotel, with bored waitresses, dealers, and a rather rude security guard. Hotel staff seemed not to be enjoying their jobs either; the cleaning woman seemed to be the only one enjoying her job.

We went to the other set of elevators to the tower rooms and the somewhat dingy hall to find our room.   Window by the elevator had a cool view of the airport.     Rooms looked exactly like the ones on the Hooters website, if you look closely enough.   Nightstands are really just table tops and otherwise, it's the garish no frills room it's made out to be.   We had a 17th floor strip view room, which had pretty killer views of the Tropicana, Luxor, and Exalibur, and a side view of sorts of the neon green glow of the MGM, so definitely no complaints about that.

The casino floor had a decent assortment of slots and the gift shops had the usual Hooters merchandise available.   The club there had Prince and Snoop Dogg music blaring loudly, so lots of p***y control and that type; not what you'd call family friendly but perfectly in line with the kind of tackiness that Hooters is.   

So not a bad place and compared to other casinos, I think you get what you pay for here.",asoUInYtHoO0ANRKlta9DA,2,2,2,M_nSuhGhPsNsJ2W7PGn3Xg
3326203,2008-05-05,18,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Damn you, Priceline!

Don't get me wrong, I love a good Priceline deal.  Most hotels I found through Priceline have been cheap and better than expected.    However, in this case, my experience was a big fat disappointment.  It is partially my fault, because I failed to read the disclaimers.  You see, about 12 months ago, Priceline changed their hotel ""zones"" from ""North Strip"" to ""North Strip & Vicinity"" and from ""South Strip"" to ""South Strip & Vicinity.""  Oh boy.

The last two times I was in Vegas (Final Four Weekend and Kentucky Derby Weekend), I was unfortunate enough to have been relegated to the ""vicinity.""  I am talking about Hooters Hotel and Casino, formerly known as San Remo Hotel.  The Hootel, as I like to call it, is located just behind Tropicana and just across the street from MGM Grand.  The location is really not that bad.  Besides, I only paid $69/night, which my friends found to be hilarious in itself.

However, was it a good value?  NO!!!!

The Hootel is worse than you can imagine.  Only one of the two elevators in our tower worked.  The Hootel seemed to have a shortage of hand towels and regular sized towels.  When we called housekeeping, they promptly brought us more bath towels.  Hmmm.  The towels weren't even all that white.  Hmmm again.  The latch on my balcony door wasn't working.  Hmmm one more time.  The walls are paper thin, so you can hear a lot of what's going on in the adjacent rooms.  Hmmm and shrug.  We stayed on a non-smoking floor, but the ""no smoking"" designation must have included tobacco only, because the distinct smell of marijuana emanated from the hallway (I am talking to you, obnoxious guests in Room 1008).  Hmmm and sniff-sniff.

The room itself is a sight to see.  It's not your average Zach and Cody's suite at the Tipton Hotel.  It's more like Hannah Montana's after-school Malibu hangout . . .  if she and her friends wore orange shorts and served you beer and chicken wings.  (OK, even I don't know where this analogy came from).

Have you ever dreamed of having your own Hooters Restaurant in your house, without the women or chicken wings?  Well, your fantasy is realized right here, in your very own Hooters hotel room.  Your room decor will feature tables and backboards made of unfinished wood, bright orange lampshades, a painting of a Hooters restaurant on the wall, a fake palm tree, and ... an orange bar stool and a bar table right in your room!!!  Score!

Unfortunately, no amount of orange decorations could make up for the white trash appeal of this hotel.  The clientele of this Hootel is unbelievably white trash.  Never in my life have I seen so many Harley Davidson and Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirts on a casino floor.  Every group of frat boys checking in had a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon or Bud in tow.  Women had questionable tattoos and wore Daisy Duke shorts.  Casino featured neon lights and an original Alan Kulwicki's NASCAR vehicle.  I kept hearing Jeff Foxworthy's ""You might be a redneck if . . . "" routine in my head.  'Nuff said.

I love a good bargain, but this isn't it.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $10-30 a night on a real hotel room.  I am never staying here again, EVER.",Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ,6,2,1,5rFXtgeUzRhIdR68wB-_JQ

We were given a room on Bay Side, facing the pool on the 8th floor. The pool/jacuzzi is open 24 hours which is VERY convenient, so bring your bathing suit!! The bathroom could use some TLC and so can the carpeting in the room. Everyone that worked in the casino were very nice, we were constantly greeted.

I am surprised by how few people there are gambling here. They had only half of a craps table open, but if I walk across the street to MGM the place is RIDICULOUS!!! The whole casino here feels sleepy. This place has a downtown feel to it. It would fit nicely next to Golden Nugget or Four Queens and it would be ""classy"".

The elevators felt run down and there's signs of neglect (broken decor, faded paint). The room is about the same. It's big, but feels run down. The buffet was very unimpressive. Bacon, eggs, cereal and yeah... that's about it.

Pros:
Inexpensive
GREAT location!

Cons:
A little grudgy
Boring casino

Recommendation:  This is an inexpensive place to stay and I wouldn't stay here for any other reason. At the same price, I would choose ANY on strip hotel, but those will all be more. This place has a great location if you wanna be close to MGM.",bvoR3u9-vQanpUq13zVypw,0,0,2,iHDsf03fDjx1ohPZiNjbSQ

The rooms were about what we expected. They were simple but clean and definitely adequate. The hotel also has a really nice pool area with a bar. The Hooters restaurant is good, but predictably overpriced.

Service at the hotel is pretty poor. We waited in line an inordinately long time to check in. When I called housekeeping to request more towels (we only had two, and there were four people staying in the room), no one picked up the phone and I had to leave a voicemail message. No one ever got back to me. When housekeeping cleaned the room on Wednesday, they didn't replace the toilet paper or shampoo, and we were clearly running out of both.

As others have noted, the atmosphere is a lot like that of a frat house. Hooters is a good place to stay if you a want a really cheap hotel room, but don't expect much when it comes to service.",jdMiLnfC5cDR_PDObmecog,0,0,2,kk51Rf8cSTEjIX4bJFGnhA

Value:  for an average of about $22 a night plus resort fee ($11.15), it's an excellent price. Other cheap hotel/casinos in the area charging in the same range seem to be The Riviera, The Stratosphere, and Circus Circus.  I prefer this for the location as it's easy to walk to the MGM, New York New York, Planet Hollywood, and The Cosmopolitan. Plus, it's not as lame.

Room:  it's a nice place to sleep, the bed and pillows are comfortable.  If it wasn't Hooters, the decor would be kinda tacky, with the orange chair and lamps, as well as the green, yellow, and orange leaf designed comforter.  You can easily hear every sound your neighbors make though, which was really the main downside.

Casino:  it's really small, you can't get lost here.  Everything is within eye sight.  Some of the girls working as dealers do have the Hooters outfits on, but like I opened up the review with, nothing smoking hot really.  The casino is pretty low key.

Gym/Pool/Resort Fee:  most of us have accepted resort fees, but they don't give you much for it here. You get two 12 oz. water bottles daily.  The gym has 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 bikes, and some free weights and about 7 machines/benches combined.  There was hardly anyone ever at the pool, but it was nice enough.  WiFi was a plus.

Staff:  the guy working the Bell Services most of the time gave the impression he was always being bothered, as well as the chick at the front desk.  When I called the phone # listed for assistance, no one picked up the first 2 times. Maids did a good job though.

Dining: with lots of great places in walking distance, I did not eat at the Hooters restaurant or any of their other restaurants.

I only rated 3 stars due to the value.  As I had a 6 night stay in Vegas that was a deciding factor.  For the value it's definitely worth it.  If I was staying somewhere else I wouldn't stop by the casino or restaurants here.  In fact, I really didn't even when I was staying here.",fG-K5NglgWxHg8PNu62afg,6,1,3,5ZhI0Zp3shzBXqEIfM1MYA

The rooms are very old with a noisy air handler that you control from the unit by the window. Cool or hot, high or low. That's it.

This is the former San Remo Hotel, which I used to love for their authentic Sushi restaurant, but in Vegas tradition, which is, there is no Vegas historical society really, it was torn down and built into this dive.

I have to agree with other reviewer, parking lot was totally scary, dark, no security, totally open spaced to walkways, especially scary for a woman walking into an entire building dedicated to the hatred of women.

One star only because of proximity to Strip and surprisingly  the cocktail waitresses are some of the most covered up and conservative that I've seen in Las Vegas. Other hotels have the chicks walking around in g-strings and I stand WAY too close to their asses on the casino floor, but here they're wearing little shorts and a little jacket.

I noticed the other show they offered was of a disgusting comic that was very 1950's sexist racist, so it is consistent with Hooters theme.

As a casino, I like the slots they have here. You can make lower bets than at other casinos. They don't have that many tables though. 

As a hotel, it wasn't fun at all. I was on crutches with a broken foot and they gave me a bungalow room on the 2nd floor with no elevator. Horrific. A wonderful employee named Destinee got security to help me switch my room to the towers, where there were elevators. They got me a handicapped room which was nice of them, means it's closer to the elevator.

I don't know when was the last time someone was in there. The comforter was dirty. The magazines said Winter 2009 - it's May 2010 guys... And I watched a bug crawl over my pillow.

I was also told that I was going to get a credit from moving to Bungalow to Tower since Bungalow costs more.. But when I was checking out, there was no notes in my account regarding it. Also I called down for help with my bags since I was on crutches and nobody came to assist me.

True, the Hooters casino is as poorly cleaned and maintained as one of their restaurants, but the rooms were not quite so bad as the typical Hooters restroom and one has to expect a certain griminess to go with the low room costs - that could potentially be some of the fun of the aesthetic that Hooters touts, I suppose.

We came to the Hooters casino because some friends were already booked here and we wanted to spend some time with them after we had rested some, and enjoy exploring Las Vegas.  They, my partner, and I had just spent a week first on a grueling 1900 mile road trip from Austin to northern Nevada and then camping in a barren desert for the Burning Man art festival - and figured it would be nice to spend some time with each other just decompressing.  So we decided we would pay ahead for a room with a bed big enough for both of us, knowing that it would take all day to drive through Nevada from Black Rock Desert to Las Vegas.

We paid ahead for a room with a King size bed for three nights, got up at 7:30 am and drove all day from Burning Man in North Nevada, got in around 11 pm exhausted and haggard, looking forward to nothing more than just crawling into a clean comfortable bed with each other and relaxing, before spending  - and they tell us that they will only put us in a room with two doubles and told us in a bored voice, ""too bad, even though you paid ahead for a king room, it is first come first served.  Tough, there is nothing we can do, that's policy."" In effect, you can only get what you paid for if you come at checkin time - paying for the room ahead of time does not actually secure it.  

Our friends were, of course, screwed over by the same policy and were no happier about it.

Avoid any business that does not deal honestly with its customers like this - this is worse than what you would reasonably expect from Hooters and Las Vegas combined.  I expect trashiness from Hooters and sleazy business practices from Las Vegas - but bait and switch is outside the bounds of any business claiming to be reputable.",FYjQm_BQRlQZRFto43FXsw,2,1,1,ARmjkVvaV6-2sPhKhdkwmw

I stayed here while working on a fighter and he had connections to this hotel so I gave it a whirl (it was free).  As a ""VIP"" they brought up a gift basket containing a cheap bottle of wine and 4 Bud lights with peanuts and a Hooters 50cent wings coupon.  Really?  OK my expectations where floored after this.

The room is a typical Howard Johnson/Ramada Inn type of room with Tommy Bahama theme.  Nothing special but the Tower rooms were new and clean with a window air conditioner.  The Bungalow rooms were horrible.  The hallways stunk and were dirty, the rooms were old with sliding screen doors from the 70s.  They all had the Tommy Bahama theme but these rooms and floors were in trouble and need to be torn down.

Drinks were horribly overpriced and watered down, and I didn't find the waitresses to be much to look at either; would have thought Vegas would be the cream of the crop.

So, here's the story: We booked a great bargain at the Hilton, but it was only two nights. We needed a place to stay for our last night in Vegas, and we wanted something cost effective and close to the airport because of our ultra-early flight out. Hooters fit the bill. It's at the far South end of the strip, so the cab ride to McCarran is quick. It isn't fancy and there are cheap rooms to be had, so we tried it. 

The guy at the registration desk couldn't have been nicer. We asked for a nonsmoking king on a high floor, and he delivered. We had an amazing view of the Tropicana, Excalibur, and the roller coaster at New York New York. The room was BASIC, but OK. 

You can walk across the street to the MGM and that's what we did for most of the day. 

In the evening, we went back to the Hooters Casino, and guess what? We had a blast!!!! The minimum bets are LOW, so playing feels like PLAYING. It's not as serious as at the high-end casinos.

I thought; ""I just might have to visit them and see what sort of deals they have."" This was not my best idea while in Las Vegas.

First off, the Hooters Casino is a bit off the Strip, so you'll need to take a cab. Second, the casino floor is not clean. Third, the crowd here has a trashy vibe. If you want to play craps with a father and his daughter, then here's your casino. Otherwise, order a drink, bet the don't, and take stock of your life. That's what I did.

Some of the dealers and croupiers wear the Hooters costume. The men and some women, wear traditional casino uniforms. Minimums are low at table games and blackjack tables, but you could probably do better at the downtown casinos if you wanted to bet on the cheap, especially these days.

I don't know if this place will survive until my next trip to Las Vegas, but I won't be making a return visit, and I couldn't imagine staying here with the fancy casino hotels offering great rates on great rooms.",_q_z9bIwYg2q0mSNbwxmGA,2,0,2,RhRlCRiiWUo4i_FM9NoZIQ

3627649,2010-04-05,3,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Here's my lil' adventure at Hooters Casino Hotel.

We had been in town for 2 days and were staying at T.I.  On our trip 6 months ago, my wife and I went to hooters and enjoyed playing on the cheap 21 tables.  My wife suggested, ""Let's go down to Hooters and try the chicken wings again (to see if last times SHITTY wings was a fluke) and play some cheap tables.""  It was a plan, we filled up our yards we bought from Wal-greens and started walking to Hooters.  Once we got there the line for food was about 45 minutes.  We had no interest in waiting that long for another possible let down.

Plan B.  Cheap tables it is.  Although the cheapest table we could find was 10 min.  At this point we were happy to just be able to sit next to each other at the tables and play.  We really didn't wanna play that much per hand, so we laid down 20 and said, ""screw it!""  Welllllll, about  two hours later we were both up to 200+ dollars each.  We were so shocked we just had to keep going!  After losing a few and winning a few and feeling DRUNK, we mutually agreed it was time to cash in and mosey back towards the T.I. where the bed was much closer.  

From the point of getting colored up to walking to the cashier I blacked out for about the next 10-11 hours and was out of commission about a day and a half.  I didn't remember a damn thing from walking out of the doors, to getting in a cab, to walking to my bedroom and passing out.  It turns out at some point it was RUFIED.  Now please understand folks, I can handle my liquor quite well, and often wake up early the next day outta habit and because of my daughter.  The next day my body was absolutely exhausted, my wife told me my pupils were blasted, and I simply ""did not feel right"".  This was no hang over that my body was trying to kick.  

As fun as it was to win money, the fact that someone had a different night planned out for us was kinda disturbing.  Now here I am posting my review and I'm feeling like an ass for not yelping this place before I came here.  You dont see too many reviews as bad as this place has.  And for damn good reason I see.

Raymond B. mentioned he was getting ""eyed"" the whole time for giving his wife money right?  The pit boss at the tables was giving me and my wife the ""Eye"" after we started winning that much money. Almost giving us a feeling like we shouldn't be winning money anymore!  We played $10 tables at the T.I a few nights later and had equally as fun of a time and played till 6am.

Second, I had asked for utensils delivered to my room. NEVER CAME. Called FOUR hours later & room service kept connecting me to housekeeping. Why would house keeping have utensils?! Don't know why this task was so hard to do. 

Lastly, the woman who checked me in had a huge attitude. I have stayed at multiple hotels on the strip & cant think of one time I was greeted with an attitude at the front desk. You would think that people at the front desk should be approachable & friendly but she was the complete opposite.

I stayed here and i was definitely skeptical because it based on a restaurant theme and I wasn't exactly confident based on the yelp reviews i was reading. 

The Good
The Rooms were affordable. 
Their customer service was excellent. We had a problem with a door on our first room and they upgraded us no problem. 
The Rooms were clean. I saw pics online with wood and I thought i won't look good but when I got there it looked great and clean. Kind of like a Miami or Cancun beach hotel. 
The Swimming pool is 24 hours. Big plus for us since we got there so late. People were swimming at 2 in the morning. VEGAS baby. 
Beers were cheap $2.50
Walking distance from the center of the strip. The location was the main factor we choose this place. 

The Bad
They charge a Resort fee whether you use their pool, gym and other amenities.
The Gambling wasn't that good. I mean their gaming selection wasn't that amazing. 
The Vibe of the hotel is more beach hotel than classy stay so I looked out of place coming out to my car in a suit. 

Overall I would definitely stay here again.

First off, their hotel was advertised on a magazine, and was suggested as one of the pools to experience. So my group of friends thought to try something different. We get there, not only do they tell you that you have to rent a room to go in the pool (because ceasars and hard rock let the public swim for free without having to rent a room), but when they advertise the 25 cent chicken wing deal they hide the actual terms in fine print as if they were sleazy salesmen. You have to first, sign up for a players card to get the 25 cent deal. Then, you have to buy a 10 wing minimum. Then after the bad service and EXTRA and I do not exaggerate the EXTRA greasy chicken wings you find what you thought was a deal turned to be a hefty check after they ring up $1 PER RANCH SAUCE, $1.50 PER NON REFILLABLE DRINK, $1 per to go box which can only limit ten wings per box. If you have 15 wings you HAVE TO GET TWO. So I mean at the end of the night, you lost your appetite for good wings, and you walk away with horrible experience because the service was bad, the people were rude, and the charges were ridiculous. I mean its not even a top rated hotel. Obviously.

Walk through the lobby trying to follow the neon signs pointing to the room elevators,  get lost,  ask a near by worker for help,  she didn't know where to go! We get in our room to find a leaky bath tub and a hole behind the toilet. There is no fridge unless you want to pay $25 a day. Woke up at 3am this morning hearing something rustling around in our bags on the table,  there's a MOUSE!!!! We called the front desk to get help and they say they need to verify there's a mouse. We search all over the room and find it in the closet and corner it in there. Operator calls saying ""do not disturb"" sign is on the door so they left. I'm like get them back up here!! Maintenance comes in sees it and says ""yup there's a mouse"". We're like is that it?!? They go outside and when we called them back in because we're doing all the work watching it they say ""we called pets mart, they should be here soon. And sorry we're fully booked so we can't move you"". In the mean time it runs out the open door into the hall way and they just laugh it off saying it's the halls problem now. I'm like seriously it got in once,  we do all the work to watch it so they can ""verify""it and they just let it run out and that's that. Later two more guys knock on the door asking if we killed it already or still need them to get it,  I'm like no its been gone and who knows where now. They just say ok and leave. I never went back to sleep,  it got in once it can come back. The manager waived our resort fee and offered a discount for our next visit.

The sliding door was off its tracks so we couldn't close out partying and outside noise at night - lots of outside fighting and the guy out with  dust pan and broom scraping across the ground at 6am was a bit ridiculous. We were told we could come down and change rooms but we'd have to pack up our stuff and stand in line again. Really? The small vanity mirror was broken off the wall. The room was dark, not enough lights. And we found half a joint on our balcony. The carpet looks like someone has puked on it many times and it wasn't cleaned properly. There was toothpaste still on the bathroom faucet, wasn't ours! Calking needs to be replaced in the bath tub. Even the bathroom sink is cracked with black in it. We paid WAY too much for this room.

3755731,2017-06-29,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I selected Hooters Hotel and Casino after receiving several bids on hotelplanner.com for an annual reunion of Air Force Veterans.  The issues started as soon as one of my members who has medical issues did not have a refrigerator in his room for his medication after calling several times prior to his arrival.  He was assured that his room would have a refrigerator.  When I arrived I also did not have a refrigerator.  When I inquired with the front desk staff, they said their policy was to only place refrigerators in rooms upon request.  Are you kidding me???  Every hotel I have ever stayed in has had a refrigerator in the room save for maybe motel 6.  Not to mention, why would a hotel in the middle of the desert not have a refrigerator in each room so that their guests could enjoy a cold drink.  
After my first shower I noticed the tub in my room was clogged.  After reporting it to the front desk I returned about ten hours later after being in the 117 degree heat wanting to take another shower only to find the standing water still in my tub.  After another report to the front desk they final had the water removed.  I say removed and not drained because I don't believe they fixed the clog.  The next time I took a show the tub was still clogged.
Next came the day of our reunion meeting.  When I called the sales staff to find out which meeting room we would be in for our reunion meeting, the sales staff told me they did not have us scheduled for a meeting room.  I spoke with the sales staff and they informed me that they were unaware we needed a meeting room for our reunion meeting.  I reminded her that the meeting room was one of the reasons we selected their hotel for our reunion.  I reminded her that we spoke at least once a month for 7 months about the meeting room and the need for a podium and each time she advised me that everything would be provided.  She stated that she remembered speaking about but she didn't think it was confirmed.  After explaining to her that we were scheduled to have a surprise wedding ceremony during our meeting, she then suggested I look at a few different options for our meeting.  Not of which were viable, (Suite guest rooms???), the Mad Onion Restaurant which would not be private.  She stated that they would be able to turn the music down during our meeting but would not be able to turn it all the way off.  
In an effort to accommodate the hotel I suggested we could move our meeting to the following night at the same time and she stated it was not available.  I then suggested we would further accommodate the hotel and move our meeting to three hours earlier to give them time to set up for the next meeting.  She advised me that they could do that but it would cost our group three hundred dollars.  Needless to say, the poor planning by the hotel and willingness to make good on their mistake and then attempt to charge my group for a meeting room that was supposed to be included for our group staying at their hotel has left our entire group very displeased any future reunions held in Las Vegas by my Air force Veterans group will not be held at Hooters Hotel and Casino.  
Being former police officers in the Air Force we were able to adapt and hold a version of a meeting and wedding at the bar outside by the pool so all was not lost.  

Bottom line, if you must go to Hooters, I would suggest it is only to stop in the Hooters restaurant and bar.  The staff at those locations was very helpful and accommodating 180 degrees difference from the hotel.",49YevTePTO4OmKeMOKaGBA,0,0,1,qM8Pb2sd0eJCaDlpVxUvHw

3769320,2011-08-18,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"After a 5-6 month long sabbatical I have returned to Yelp, and this time I'm back with burning rage for Hooters Casino & Hotel. Boy oh Boy where do I even begin... 

As this was the first time to Vegas for my friend and I, I did a tremendous amount of research on the lodging options. After heavy consideration we settled on Hooters, because of the ultra cheap price... I will admit that the reviews I read on the place had me worried, but honestly how much time do you spend in the hotel? 

Having that been said let's get down to business...

Before I slam these people let me discuss the positives. 

For starters the 1.50$ Bud/Bud light 24/7 was a great deal (honestly that is what sealed the deal on whether or not we stayed there).

The rates really are dirt cheap, you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere that close to that strip any cheaper.  

25 cent wings from 12am-6am. Who can say no to that? 

Sign up for the Hooters reward card, and you get 200$ in free slot play (promotional only slot area, at 10$ per spin), free steak dinner at Mad Onion (with purchase of 1.50$ beverage per person, and with 1.50$ charge for any add-ons IE. salad, toppings for your potato, onions and mushrooms (which were awful))  

I think that about sums it up for the positives at this place....

Negatives.

The Bathroom was kinda nasty.. The tile, and fixtures were old and grimey. 

The AC did little to nothing in our room...

No AC in the hallways, stupid hot walking to/from the room. 

Excruciatingly long check in/ check out times.

I noticed the painting on the elevator door was peeling off, and they were just like ""fuck it... let's not fix it"" 

The painting in our room was peeled off the canvas... Noticing a reoccurring theme here. 

I'm not one to harp on the attractiveness of staff, but the Hooters girls were less than stellar in the department. I go to Hooters for the wings anyways, but for others that may/may not be a big deal. 


In all fairness I will say there was a noticeable difference in service between daytime and late hours at this place. 

I've noticed something in common with most reviews on this place, people are mentioning the fact that the waitresses/staff are very rude to patrons. Very true! Two stories to share about this one.

1. About 5:40am my friend and I walk into the Mad Onion looking to sign up for the VIP card (so we can get the 25 cent wings) nobody was in line, and the restaurant has less than 10 people inside. The hostess ""Crystal"" Ignored us for a good 3-4 minutes as she did whatever it was that she was doing behind the counter. Not a single glance... Nothing. When she finally graced us with her presence, she informed us that the person responsible for registering people for the VIP card was on break, and would be back in about 10-15min (25 cent wings end at 6am) and we should just hang around and keep checking back for this person.... 
Come to find out from a bartender NOT the hostess, the VIP person already left for the night. Sorry no 25 cent wings for you. 

2. Mad Onion (again) around 3:30am. Crystal seemed to be in a better mood this time around....

While waiting in line to get a seat (we decided to secure a VIP card for the cheap wings earlier in the day) we notice a large amount of people just walking past the line, and heading into the restaurant. My friend decides to inquire about what is going on at the hostess desk. He asked ""What is going on?"" (very calm, very collected,) and a gentleman behind the host desk (doing VIP card registration I think) simply responded with ""I'm not affiliated with the restaurant."" 

After about half an hour wait we get sat. (Be aware that with about all the promotional specials offered, you have to buy a 1.50$ drink (alcoholic/non alcoholic) in order to receive the offer.) I order 20 spicy, Bud Light (in order to satisfy the drink req.),  2 blue cheese cups (1.00$ each), and an order of fries my friend follows suit but without the fries. 

Food arrives, all but my fries... No problem, server said she would have them right out. Fries never came out?!?!? When it came time for the check, we politely reminded her not to charge me for the fries because we never got them. She scoffed at us and stormed off! REALLY?!? 

We compare checks, and notice that my friends bill is higher than mine. He asked for a to go box, and was charged for the box 1.50$ and they charged him again for the wings he didn't finish 2.50$! 

At this point we are fuming! How are you going to charge someone twice for food already ordered? It was as if he was leasing the wings w/ the option to buy if he chose to take them off premises... LOL 

Needless to say a major scene ensued, and they finally took the charge off. 


That is all I care to write about this place... 

While I plan on going back to Vegas very soon, I will NEVER stay at this place again!

2 stars for the 1.50$ bud, and the shot at getting 25 cent wings.

3789548,2008-11-03,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I came to Hooters this weekend with a preconcieved bad attitude about the hotel. 
Maybe it was the old San Remo Hotel location and the roaming gang of thugs that would steal stuff from peoples rooms ""in the old days.""

Maybe it was just the name and the concept of ""Hooters"" ......

But  $79.00 with added buffet coupons and ""free slot play"" on a Saturday night did not seem like a bad deal.
I wondered how the hooters chain could have improved the hotel after taking over from the San Remo.

I was very much surprised a how nice the room was. The ""Ocean view"" rooms sported a California beach look with  wood planking and beach looking furniture.
Hey, the bed was OK, so no problem.......
Bathroom was standard with no problems, so once again - no problem.

The 200.00 in free slot play is a scam. You go to ""special promotional machines and if you hit the big jackpot on three reals you win a 100, or even 1,000. Otherwise nothing else counts .....
It is kind of like the free pull machine at the four queens casino downtown. 
You know you are never going to win, but you keep doing it each time you visit anyway. 
I doubt very much if they pay off one or two hundred a day.   
But that is another issue ......

I normally stay at the Hilton, but they were sold out due to a conference so my friend and I picked the cheapest hotel. After all, we weren't planning on spending that much time in the room so we figured it couldn't be THAT bad? Well, we were wrong. 

1) Check-in: If you're looking to get greeted with a smile, go elsewhere. The woman that checked us in was far from friendly. Perhaps their HR department should put a little more effort into hiring people that are going to be interacting with guests or put a little more emphasis on customer service?? Come on, it's not that hard.
2) Elevators: If you have any fear whatsoever of elevators, don't stay here. I'm terrified of them and these are the WORST!! Not only do the elevators from the parking garage to the hotel rattle and nasty, but the elevators inside the hotel aren't much better. If you stay here, prepare yourself for some shaking and loud noises.
3) Hallways: As soon as we walked out of the elevator, it felt as if we walked straight into a frat house. The carpets are gross and the hall smell like weed.
4) Room: As my friend and I made our way to the room (after exchanging multiple looks of ""is this really happening to us?""), we entered our tommy bahama themed room only to discover that there's another door inside our room that connects to our neighbors room. Yeah, this is common in some hotels, but there was a three-inch gap at the bottom of the door. REALLY!?! I didn't even sleep under the covers. Instead, I put towels down and slept on top of them. If I'm ever going to get bed bugs from a hotel, this might be the place.
5) Bathroom: Oh my lord....clean the bathrooms please. The showers were disgusting and I decided it was in my best interest to wear shower shoes. Do you look forward to staying in hotels where you can relax and take a bath? Dream on. Not happening here. 

I have not a single positive thing to say about this place. If we hadn't booked our room through expedia and could get our money back, I would have checked out the minute we checked-in.

I would stay at a more expensive resort for a special occasion or leisure trip where I would enjoy more of the amenities, but my needs are fairly spartan for short overnights.

There were 4 outlets next to the bed, which in an older property is difficult to find. I was concerned about cleanliness after reading other reviews.

I would prefer the bed and pillows were a bit softer, but for under $60 with taxes and resort fees I won't complain. I was very happy to see a Keurig coffee maker with 2 pods in my room.  The internet was included in the resort fees along with 2 bottles of water. Beware the food and drink prices aren't inexpensive, but the strip is right there, and Grubhub and Postmates deliver.

Once we finally made it to our room on the 9th floor, THE NON SMOKING ROOM SMELLED LIKE A SMOKING ROOM!!! We stepped out for a bit,only to come back,and have KEYS THAT DID NOT WORK TO OPEN DOOR!!

Being that we had teenagers with us,we decided to stay in,order food and watch one of the OVER-PRICED MOVIE,but we couldnt, BECAUSE SOMEHOW THERE WAS A BLOCK FROM THE FRONT DESK THAT THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO REMOVE! We picked up the house phone to call for help,BUT THERE WERE NO DIAL BUTTONS ON THE PHONE!! What the hell?? I wasn't aware of the BROKEN PHONE when we PAID $563.00 A NIGHT FOR THIS ROOM!! All bad! I decided to walk downstairs to Hooters ro ask for some paper plates,and one of their pretty waiters was VERY RUDE in even answering my question, so I helped myself to the to-go containers since she was clear that she was too busy to help me with something so simple! We did get some help with the movie issue, a ENGINEER was sent up to our room to figure out what was wrong,oh wait,but he didn't even know what he was doing,I'm not sure why the technician would be the one called for this situation! Sadly,at this point, the kids gave up on trying to watch a movie!

Oh did I forget to mention the part where we physically handed the tip to the room service runner,but he TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO STILL CHARGE A TIP TO THE CREDIT CARD ON FILE!! I CAN'T COMPREHEND why he would freely swipe our card when I handed him cash for the tip! I don't get it.

The sports bar in the back is filled with cliched men literally hooting and hollering at each dramatic turn of the basketball game being aired.  Guy's guys carrying on and enjoying the holy trinity of sports, alcohol, and women.  I definitely felt out of place.  The nightclub was especially theatric with the female bartender climbing the rack above the bar and hanging upside down serving drinks to the largely male clientele.  She even did a number where she hung with her legs suspended and invited men to place their head between her thighs from the backside so she could give them shots individually.

If you want some flavor order the hot, which were more like a mild. Ranch or blue cheese on the side was $1 extra. Totally not worth the 30 minute wait or the horrible/slow service.

Afterwards we ordered the honey chipotle wings with bleu cheese and a side of curly fries. The place was fairly busy, but it seemed that everyone was getting taken care of. Lots of birthdays were being celebrated so there was lots of singing.

Our food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. The wings and fries hit the spot and went down well with the Blue Moon.

The restaurant is very clean, and able to accommodate larger parties. What's also great is the food is affordable. Yes the location is on the south end of the strip, but if you need some good old wings, you can't go wrong.

Two words that accurately describe Hooters!  I still have the marks to prove it!  Still itching after my horrible stay!

I came to Vegas to attend a convention at the MGM and Hooters was inexpensive and convenient since I can walk across the street to MGM for my workshops.  After the first night of staying at Hooters, I went to my workshop and was scratching throughout the day.  Another night's stay at Hooters and it got worse.  The room we stayed in was infested with bed bugs.  We were on the 12th floor.

We called them to complain and apparently Hooters knew they had bed bugs on the 7th floor.  Apparently they didn't know they also had them on the 12th.  You'd think if they knew they had bugs on the 7th, they'd really try hard to make sure none of the other floors were infested.

They were in my suitcase (don't EVER leave your case on the floor) and clothes.  I had to decontaminate everything including washing out my suitcase.  They little buggers hide in cracks and crevices and I had to make sure none of them hitched a ride home or my house would be infested.

Yes Hooters was inexpensive and convenient but NEVER NEVER will I stay at this place.  I'm seriously still itching from the scratches.  My right arm had a total of 11 bites.  My left arm had a total of 7.  My right leg had 5.  My left leg 3.  Back five.  Face, one.

In A Sentence
(The) Small casino-hotel where all the hooters are bulging out. 

Quick Review
+   Location. It is conveniently located in prime S. Strip land just a block east of the boulevard across Tropicana from MGM Grand.

-   Only a decade old under the Hooters® brand, it appears older and more worn that its neighbour Tropicana. (It has to be much older than ten years; educated assumption: it has to have been rebranded from another existing casino.) 

------------------------------------------

I think I'll bring back storytime*. (*Pointless anecdotes that are useful to no one.)
 
Storytime
I'm helping this guy. He's staying in a suite at TI (back when it didn't suck). Eight hundred thirty square feet of pure Vegas bliss in loud ass red. What does this have to do with Hooters®? His electronic mail address is at Hooters.com ....

Naturally, I am perplexed. I'm a curious person and I always like to be learning -- even about things I have no business knowing -- so I ask. Do you work for Hooters? Whoa. Really? Wait. Can't you stay at Hooters for free? Oh ... yeah. Hahahahaha! You're probably correct about that. 

This man -- some mid-level executive at HQ -- apparently doesn't lie. His words (paraphrased): that place sucks. I wouldn't stay there for free. 

True story.

I've been here for shows. They are held in the most bizarre sardine contraption of a room upstairs where it takes a long ass time for ingress/egress. First place I heard Geechy Guy perform his stand-up after having heard of him for ages. 

Geechy Guy and Hooters®, a match made in hell.

Pro Tip:
Parking is free.

I stayed in one of the pool-facing ""bungalo"" rooms, which I'm sure in the summer are a great place to be. Not so much in February, when all you have to look forward to is a long walk to the casino (or in my case, the front door and the rest of Vegas). The peeling shower/tub didn't drain and the in-room safe proved nonexistent, which bothered me. For some reason, this felt like the sort of place I might actually want or need the safe.

The casino IS on the smaller side, but I'm not quite sure what earlier reviewers hope for. More slots? Because whenever I walked into the newer, larger casinos, that's what I saw. Row upon row upon row of slots. It's a smaller, slightly off Strip hotel, so for the traffic, the casino is plenty spacious and there's sufficient variety of gaming as well. I did, however, feel like the $10 craps table - usually the only table operating - was a bit high relative to other casinos of it's caliber, but whatever.

The restaurants aren't great, but if you're looking for an inexpensive Vegas room and don't want to break the bank, plop your butt at the nickle slots and suck down a few comped drinks. And if nothing else, Hooters provides a nice launching off point for the rest of the Strip.",30l6PviyQqfH0qVC5Vu7MQ,2,1,3,UxjmNybyH_YKAGlE45D8Vg

Got inside our room, old t.v., trash can was so stained and old it was so gross, the water in the shower kept going super hot to super cold, the t.p. was so thin we went through two rolls in one day, the walls were patched everywhere, our bathroom door handle didn't work, the air conditioner was a wall unit (old), also we could hear the people in the next room through the bathroom vents.

I gambled in the Hooters casino for 1 1/2 hours and never once saw a waitress so I was unable to get a drink.

3997081,2018-04-16,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"If I could give Hooters Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas a 1/2 star rating, I would!  It was the worst hotel experience I've had in my entire life. Not only does it smell like urine in the rooms, the front desk Supervisor Ashley displayed horrible customer service skills, and should be required to complete conflict resolution training or demoted. Her behavior was unacceptable and I am shocked that she holds a position of leadership.  I can only assume that she has friends in high places that just gave her the job. Or maybe providing great customer service isn't a priority at Hooters. Either way, Ashley ruined our vacation with her lack of professionalism and evil mentality. 

 After dining in the Hooters restaurant while waiting for one of their shows to start, my family was accused of trying to basically steal food from the hotel after we had paid over $150 for it. Here's what happened....

Due to receiving our food late, we had to pack it all up and take it up to the room so we could get to our show. We returned to the room to retrieve the food and housekeeping had taken all the food (who knows what was done with it).  We went to front desk to inform the hotel of what had happened and faced opposition at every turn. The front desk Supervisor Ashley was very defensive and did nothing to resolve the matter. She was belittling and very condescending to my family. She not only lied and told us that housekeeping said they did not clean the room or take the food, she lied and said that the video tape didn't show us taking food to the room.  After arguing with her for over an hour and requesting to speak with her supervisor, the housekeeping manager Patricia came to the front desk to de-escalate the situation. She told us that a new employee was in training ( a girl name Taylor) and thought the food was trash. She apologized and told us that she would do everything she can to resolve the issue. 

If you are African, African American, or Russian do not stay at this hotel. If you are a Police Officer, Paralegal, HR Director, or a Mortgage Closer/Real Estate Broker don't stay at this hotel. My family and I are all professional law abiding citizens who experienced stereotypical treatment at it's worse. Ashley treated us like trash. The appalling part of the whole situation is that ""supervisor"" Ashley never apologized, even after being proven wrong and exposed as a liar. 

The following day we spoke with the Hotel Operations Manager H Hernandez who tried to smooth over the situation by refunding two days of resort fees, but the damage was already done. Oh I forgot to mention the fact that she had a male employee stand next to her for protection, as if we were going to hurt her. I will never stay or eat at another Hooters establishment again.

When I went to check in the guy behind the counter was a complete a$$hole and told me that hotels.com faxes in the reservations and that it hasn't come in yet (he didn't look) and told me I would have to come back in 45 minuets. I told him that I've never seen it take so long and asked him if e could check the fax because I had to get showered and dressed for a dinner meeting and he told me he was too busy??? WTF??? So after my dinner I went back to the hotel to check in and dealt with another guy that was cool. Now they told me about a $15.00 ""resort fee"" that I would have to pay on top of what I paid for the room. I was really excited about being at a ""resort"" and asked him where I can find the awesome resort part of the hotel that I would have to pay more for and he laughed and said the pool must be it and he thought the resort fee was BS too.

When I got the key to my room I headed to the elevator to head to my room. When the elevator doors opened on my floor I almost crapped my pants at how nasty the hallways were. I've NEVER seen such nasty carpet and was thinking I made a huge mistake staying here. When I opened the door to the room I was surprised at how clean the room was after seeing the hallways. 

After my shower I headed back out to the NASTY hallways, down the elevator and off to the tables. This is where things got better. The dealers were great (but they took my money), the waitresses were great and my late night meal was good. With the waitresses on top of their game and keeping the drinks coming all night long I didn't even notice the NASTY hallways on the way back to my room.

Overall I had a good time but will not stay here again due to the first guy I dealt with and the ""resort fee"". If they just charged $15.00 more for the room I would be cool with it but to try to hide it from you and then hit you with it when you show up is BS (not to mention this place is resort-less). It just makes me feel like they are ripping me off and I'd rather take my business to a hotel that is up front with the price.

When I finally got her attention I ordered a beer and 10 boneless wings with 2 different sauces which she said I could only get 1 sauce. (Every other Hooters I've visited has offered 2 sauces with 10 wings bone-in or boneless).  I had 3 other customers next to me, already there and new arrivals who could not get Victoria's attention. She stayed on the other side of the bar and in the back of the bar. After 10 minutes or so, the male bar assistant approached the guy to my left and took his drink order. The service for the guy on my right wasn't any better.

I was supposed to be staying in the bungalows which once you look at them just look like some variety of run down apartments and/or those little hotels across from Disneyland... My friends got there at the end of their honeymoon... so a couple days before us... and they were having a... get this... ""cricket infestation"" in the bungalows so they had to ""upgrade"" us to a regular room...  ahaha.. upgrade.. I guess so... 

It was a regular ol room with two beds, the rooms were renovated which apparently entailed putting orange lamp shades over most of the lamps, changing it to a Florida feel, putting a little bit of wooden accents, and adding a hooters orange barstool.  All in all, nothing special but it did the trick... the elevators on the other hand were creepy and one of them broke once or twice the weekend we were there.. that's a no go!  

The service was ok, we could track down the cleaning ladies for towels in the morning... when we went to pick up our baggage from holding it took a good 20 minutes before I was able to reach over the desk, grab one of their walkie talkies, and finally press enough annoying buttons to get someone to notice what was going on...

4044518,2008-09-19,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I have to say, for being my first time in Vegas, the Hooters Hotel and Casino was a really good place to stay - it didn't have the wild experience, and it was at the end of the strip.  Next time I probably would want to be more in towards the middle of the strip when I stay in Vegas, but this place did me just fine.  

The room we were staying in at Hooters was pretty screwed up though.  We had issues with the bathroom from when we first got there.  I had just driven 5 hours in from Phoenix (after a quick stop at the Damn) - and wanted to shower.  We took showers, and noticed that the water wasn't draining in the tub.  So I told the front desk that this was happening.  They said they would be sending someone up - so we left, went and walked around - had dinner, etc and did the nightly Vegas thing.

We came back, went to bed, woke up and went to take showers only to notice that the shower was still doing the same thing.  I went back downstairs, told them the story, and off we went again, as they said someone would be back up to fix it.  We came back after breakfast and I checked the shower - it worked!  I flushed the toilet, and it didnt flush.. WTF Mate?

Anyway - I go back downstairs, now a little bit pissed (It takes a lot to get me mad, and If I'm frustrated, I get what I want).  So I went downstairs, talked to the person at the desk - didnt like the response of, ""We'll send someone back up..""  So I talked to a manager and told him we either wanted a new room, or we were going to another hotel - and we were upgraded to a better room.

Now normally this would look bad, but I like a place that actually listens to customers.  I never asked for an upgrade or a better room the first two times I went down there.. I really didn't want to move my bags.  So the third time, I just didnt want to deal with it anymore.  So we ended up getting an upgrade, and something like 20% off the entire bill, which I was completely satisfied with.

The rooms are actually really nice too.  They make you feel like you are in a Hooters (shocking, I know) and the hotel staff is generally very friendly and accommodating.  The pool outside looked great, although it was a bit below swimming temperature for me at the time, but again - it looked great with the outdoor bars and everything.

The casino is nice too.  A little bit cramped in some spots, but a nice feel to the place.  And again, its nice to be in a casino and see hooters girls a plenty!

As for the incidents regarding the black prostitute at the pool area, security asked her to get out of the pool for swimming in bra and panties but did not escort her off the property??? (also stated to my wife and daughter that she was a known prostitute) I contacted the Director of Operations (Lisa Krasn) and also the general manager (Mark Sterbens) via email and phone calls in regards to this horrible stay in hopes they would handle this properly. Sadly all they did was say they were going to refund the $147 we paid for the 2 night stay. In my opinion as a guest, if this is how the ""shot callers"" handle these kind of incidents at their hotel, it doesn't make me feel safe for my family, or comfortable staying there. I'M OUT!!! There are so many places to stay in vegas where you are treated as a valued guest and treated like you matter. So if you want to get bitten by the bed bugs and have your kids see a real live prostitute in action...HOOTERS is the place to go.",tnRBHi9VNbRYhqqgjBKfJA,0,0,1,v0mkUSMFvFH7hcldhEKojg

First of all let me tell you that I walked there from the middle of the strip( Flamingo) ...it was pretty warm, and I was getting tired of walking all over Las Vegas, coming up on the side of their property where the parking lot is there is so much trash and garbage it's disgusting.
In my opinion whether or not it has something to do with their establishment or not, it's close enough to make them look really bad. So your first impression is an over-all feel of run down/ from the hotel ( yuck) to the entrance to the lack of a hostess when you walked in, in fact not one employee  was even anywhere near the front of the place and no one was in there( maybe 10 people total) 
I was so thirsty I would have paid $5 dollars for a glass of ice water at that point, but hey were at hooters some cute little girl will take care of us in no time flat right? hahahaha lol...........Wrong!!
Wouldn't you expect from hooters to be greeted at the door by at least one hooter girl/ who was outgoing, friendly and made you feel welcome? 
I see two gentleman in suits and they guide me back to the new member sign up counter.
you're roped into a little cubicle area that has about 10 machines that they have rigged to play to their speciifications. ( I know this because I personally played a machine, double/ triple 7 red white and blue $5 dollar denominations and I know what the payouts are.
And I can tell you they aren't top prize of $1,000, which incidentally  is the only prize money you can keep if you hit on.
So any way two very unfriendly non-hooter girls ( very non hooter girls) run this area, they tell you to get on a machine and they put 2 $100 dollar bills in your machine which you spin out at the set 2 credit spin.
Where normally if you hit $250, you would have the option to cash out well not here in fact that's not even enough for a free coke.
It's a joke. Oh and by the way I'm still friggin thirsty, I did not see one cocktail waitress, not one person asked us how we were doing if we would like a soda, water ,drink etc....
In fact on the way out I was so turned off by the place that I wouldn't even ask the bartender( who's kind of up front by the doors) for a glass of water, because I was so over it.
So I knew going in it wasn't going to be great, but it was much worse then I expected, I've only been to the Hooters in San Francisco and that place is so awesome/ warm and friendly, it's really night and day.
Seriously they ouught to give  a real 10 or 20 dollar free play, give good customer service and take those hundred dollar bills and clean up that parking lot and their run down rooms that should have been redone at least 25 years ago.
I give it a 0 but that wasn't an option.",1t7vGW5s5guMMe8c9LyDkg,0,0,1,MpZqAPswn6AvkSfNcqFmoA
4063508,2017-03-17,6,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"This review is only for their Hooter's Restaurant.

When I first moved to Vegas, I was really excited that they had a Hooter's restaurant as I'm a big fan of their wings, fries and fried pickles. Located in the Hooter's Hotel at the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Boulevard, this restaurant is comparative to most Hooters. 

Decorations, girls, food and drink are pretty much the same. Just different location. They obviously are looking for a certain look of girl when hiring them. They don't have to particularly nice, just got to be skinny with big boobs. I came to this location several times in the two years that I lived in Vegas and was waited on my a different girl each time. Some seemed nice, but most of the girls were just blah..no personality at all. They are your typical stuck up Vegas girls. 

Food for the most part was always fresh and tasty. Wings are a hit or miss. Taste wise, they are always good, but sometimes you get big wings with lots of meat and sometimes they're tiny and hardly no meat on them. Their curly fries are delicious!! Fried pickles are another favorite of mine, but unfortunately this location didn't do a good job at making them crispy. I would always ask for extra crisy, but they'd still come out soggy with tons of grease at the bottom.  I liked how their kitchen is open, so I was always able to see the guys cooking up my food. Food usually came out fast, even when they were very busy. I think I only had to wait once for a table. 

Overall, this is an okay location. If you want a fairly cheap place to eat wings on the Vegas strip, I'd recommend this place.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,11,11,3,uFGTVdcmYmHxU8vn0c-afA
4071936,2012-08-13,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Where to begin. I've been coming to Hooters Hotel for years, my last visit having been a couple of years ago. I've never expected much from Hooters as it's always been a cheap but decent place to stay and play. Unfortunately in the last couple of years they've really let the place go. The rooms used to be a decent place to sleep, and unwind after a day of getting your butt kicked at craps. No longer. The rooms were absolutely disgusting. Missing chairs, filthy carpets with stains from God knows what on them, moldy bathrooms, rusting exposed pipes, fecal matter left in the ""clean toilets"", towels that were thread bear and reeked of unmentionable things (ie: they weren't well cleaned if at all). It was literally vomit inducing. 

The common areas have not fared better in recent years with missing ceiling panels, failing air conditioning, elevators that are barely functional and reek of weed and urine. The Hooters restaurant in the back of the casino is still the same as always and is what you'd expect from a run of the mill Hooters, but unfortunately the fairly nice Dan Marino's restaurant up front has been replaced with ""The Mad Onion"" which is just best avoided. The staff are a miserable bunch who seem generally upset to be working there, and the food isn't even deserving of the name food. I had the turkey dinner and my companions had the brisket and mozzarella sticks respectively. Not one of the meals was even half finished. They were all barely edible. The McDonald's over at Excalibur would have been a classier and more palatable choice. 

The only place it looks like they've spent any money lately is on the casino, unfortunately that too was wasted and not for the better. Most of the table games have been replaced with electronic counterparts which are just not enjoyable like ""old fashioned"" blackjack, roulette, etc... 

It really pains me to say this as I've been a big fan of this casino and hotel for years and made it a point to stop by even if I'm not staying here on a particular trip. But after my most recent visit I will not be returning. They've really let this place go to the point where a Motel 6 looks like the Ritz by comparison.",OQw6BTAvFwI-WwHEJFeOqA,1,0,1,0hWyQdY-IWloZYH0kuYqjg

4080286,2013-06-03,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Not bad but not great.

Booked this hotel through www.lasvegas.com three days before travel for Memorial Day weekend 2013 and got an amazing rate. I guess the reason the rate was so good is this hotel and its tiny casino is in pretty severe need of a refresh and deep cleaning. The whole place just seemed dingy.

That said, the room was a pretty standard Vegas hotel room. Ours had two full-sized beds (they called them queen but no) and a 25"" old-school TV (tube). There was no mini fridge. Nice coffee machine, though, that uses the coffee pods for making individual cups of coffee. 

Shower had decent water pressure which was nice but they only supplied us with a total of two towels so if we had had kids with us we would have needed more. The sample-sized shampoo and conditioner bottles are tinier than any I have ever seen so I suggest you bring your own from home.

The beds were more comfortable than I expected.

There are a couple restaurants in the hotel, one of which I will review separately. 

The pool area is not especially large and there are not nearly enough lounge chairs. There were a LOT of families staying there with children running all over the pool area. We were somewhat irritated by the security guards telling us that we could not drink our drinks that we had acquired while elsewhere on the strip while laying by the pool. These drinks were in plastic containers. We were told that we MUST purchase our drinks from the pool-side bar. This was rather annoying given that one of the hallmark experiences of Vegas is that you can walk about with alcohol in your hand. That really soured our experience overall with this hotel.

The casino's poker room has ONE table. I didn't play any poker this weekend but would probably not play there unless the antes are low. There are a few gaming tables and quite a few slots including many of the latest ones. 

The hotel is walking distance to the strip which was a key reason for selecting it. 

All in all this was not a bad place to stay but was certainly not the best. Given that they are NOT right on the strip I would think they would try harder to have a better experience for their guests. I sorta felt like we were unimportant to them.",W8zauC9YPUURGeBU3dyxSA,1,1,3,dOnu6QQDmJn9XkVX8pmvEA

We go down and see where everyone is seated, and another girl tells us to take a seat at the end and points..ok at the end of which side? We pick a side and take a seat ""at the end"" and another waitress tells us we need to be seated by someone in order so sit..that's what we thought but she just pointed..so we sat. We order and get our food and we asked for HOT instead after we originally asked for MEDIUM and informed her and she snaps back with ""no you didn't.

The carpet looked filthy, the walls needed paint, the mattress was horrible, and the shampoo was half empty. The furniture was also in poor condition. The night stands has graffiti carved into the wood. Also, during our stay we were walking back to our room and a housekeeping employee behind us started yelling obscenities to another employee down the hall. She startled us so we turned around and looked at her. I think she realized what she was doing and stopped but we thought that was a little unprofessional. Needless to say we were very disappointed with our stay and will most likely not return. We also had friends staying there and they confirmed that their stay was just as bad. My opinion of the hotel is that it needs a lot of maintenance and staff training. And definitely shouldn't brand it as a ""resort"" with ""resort fees"".

4101694,2010-12-22,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"This was my first experience with staying at the hotel and will be my last and it's all because of the check-in staff that made my trip start off on the wrong foot. 

You get good bang for you buck if you stay it since it's not too far if you don't have a car, it's across from MGM, next to Tropicana, which is across from Excaliber and NY, NY. Maybe, not the my extravagant hotels on the strip or the newest but it's affordable gambling to lose your money at blackjack, craps and roulette! At least you can spend hours here and not mere minutes.

No reservation that was prepaid! On top of that, there was nothing the staff wanted to do about it except charge her a night's stay until it was straightened out in the morning. I don't think so for 2 reasons:

1) She had the confirmation email saying it was confirmed from Expedia
2) I had my own room, why would I have her pay when she could stay w/ me?

I think this person has cheap friends because she told me it wouldn't be fair if I let her stay in my room without having her pay anything since I paid for mine already. 

She was lazy because she wouldn't call Expedia herself so we did right in front of her who called her as we were looking straight at the her. It took about an hour to check in and I was one grumpy NY-er.

In the morning, the housekeeping lady knocked on our door at around 10 a.m.  Checkout was at 12 p.m.  We told her we didn't need it but she opened our door anyways using her own card and barged in....talk about rude!  We told her our checkout is at 12 p.m. and she left.

Tip:  Remember to sign up for the player's card.  You get $10 worth to play on the slots (if you put a dollar in), $5 worth to match your $5 on table games, and a $5 off food items from Hooters or Mad Onion (another restaurant that is in there).

Also, if you check in on FB, you get a free pint of beer (I got Blue Moon).  If you text a specific number they give you, you get 10 free wings.  Lots of freebees but they don't let you combine all of the coupons together.

So, the food finally comes and even before cracking the crab open I could tell it was over cooked. We crack a leg open and it looked like the crab was put in a food dehydrator as to suck any last piece of moisture and flavor out of it. It was actually inedible. I ask the waiter to get the manager. I explained that I don't often complain about the food but that the crab was inedible. He explaines that he'll ""comp"" it like he's doing me a favor.

1: I stopped by the receptionist to let them know that the shower started to leak after we used it, apparently she was to busy to inform their maintenance people because it never got fixed.

2: The TV look like the one I used to own back in 1990, not to mention the fact that it's not even big enough for the size of room we have.  

3: Every hotel I have ever stayed in has some sort of complimentary something or other, not this place.  Forgot something and had to go find a store because there was no way I was to be the ridiculous price for it at their shop downstairs. 

4: Somebody threw up by the elevator so I thought I would call them about it, yup, you would guess right if you would think it was still there in the morning.

5: I would have preferred to sleep on the floor but was afraid I would catch something from the filthy carpets.  So I had to settle to sleeping on bed.

6: The furniture looks like the same kind that's in my 12 yr old room.

I spoke to several people who told me that this is somewhat of a shady place, wish I had known that before.  This place is due for a major, major and I mean major renovation.

Hooters is extremely close and convenient for when I get off of work around midnight. My friend and I went there for some cheap prime rib, assuming the Mad Onion was still open. Unfortunately, even though it was Friday night, the Mad Onion was closed. The only thing open that served food was the Hooters bar and restaurant so we dragged our feet there, expecting the worst.

Usually when I go to the 'open all night' restaurants in the casinos, either the food or service is terrible, and I just assume it's because of the late hour and the servers and kitchen staff have already mentally checked out.

We were actually pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich with teriyaki sauce and fries and my friend got a cheesesteak sandwich. I can't convey enough how much this wasn't your typical late night food. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. My friend said it was one of the best cheesesteaks he has ever had.

The service was even better. Given the hour and locale, we just expected sub par service. Our server, Karissa, was pleasant, enthusiastic and very helpful. (She obviously loves her job. Getting served by someone who hates their life is never fun.) She checked on us regularly and made our Hooters experience that much more enjoyable. Someone get that girl a raise.

Good:
-Two nights for $100
-We had a bungalow room reserved but they gave us tower room without us even asking 
-Clean rooms, nothing fancy but also nothing gross to complain about. Although, the walls are kind of thin, we woke up to some girl yelling at her bf the next room over. Kind of amusing but not at 3 in the morning. 
-Small hotel which means less walking to and from the garage and our room, woohoo!
-Not smoky! I hate walking through the big casinos and having my eyes sting afterwards because of all the smoke. This can possibly mean no one likes to gamble at Hooters but hey it worked out for me!
-Close to airport and freeway (we had a car). Probably not the most convenient place to stay if you don't have a car since it's at the end of the strip unless you love to walk.

Bad:
-Elevators to garage are old and in desperate need of repair, be sure to hold on

If it had not been so damned cold we would have walked everywhere - but considering most mornings/nights dropped to around 30F we ended up driving more than expected. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel room and casino quality (considering the price point) and would gladly return here again for a cheap room in the off-season. I've read in other reviews that their rooms are usually $30 a night and that is a great deal.  

Our room was on the 7th floor and had 2 double beds, a great view of their pool, free wi-fi and some cable TV channels (for the record - watching Law & Order SVU when drunk in Las Vegas is extra disturbing). Room service is available if so inclined. 

The CONS in terms of the hotel room: Bathtub had an issue with draining properly and you'd end up standing in the soapy water after a few mins. The beds were a bit springy. No mini-fridge.

The casino was a step above anything you'd see on Freemont - not fancy but not run down either. The bar served $4 draft beer which was quite nice. They also have those famous hot wings and a cheap prime rib dinner. I didnt eat here but my partners in crime enjoyed a breakfast of steak & eggs and a brk burrito with good reviews. 

Overall, three star quality hotel but five star value.",JkBXgBwTy-2ePe3flkJiOg,4,1,3,n8o6PNMJRYyX9711iHWD5w
4252150,2013-04-03,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Delightfully tacky, yet unrefined. Indeed.

I actually liked the small casino area and sports book.
Even though it is technically ""off"" the strip I felt it was just about as convient to the strip as I could've needed. It would've been nice to have something further north, but it's closer than you realize. The opposite of Aria, which is further than you realize (technically ""on"" the strip but a half mile walk to get there).

The pool area was mellow, and I liked the set up out there as well.

I didn't have a problem with the strange urinal puck smell in the hallway. Or the old stained carpet and worn tiles in the bathroom. Or the minimal decor and the old tube TV. Or even the cheap material beddings. I expected all of that.
It's not that the place was that bad. I had low expectations and the price was right.

What bothered me is you couldn't help but feel as though they'd given up. That feeling of if they'd spent the time keeping up with shampooing the carpet, and fixing the worn out tiles in the bathroom, and fixing the broken wobbly lamp on the nightstand... it would have made it a far better experience.",lqbMdUXmkotKcojzSwyTVg,1,0,3,6w8Vtg6t_MuXZxKvaJQRTA

4268648,2013-10-21,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Some people on Yelp are making unfair comparisons regarding Hooters. 

I stayed here on October 18 & 19. The hotel / casino is older, and the rooms are in need of a remodel. The price of the stay, however, was very reasonable. One can't compare Hooters to, say, the Cosmopolitan, but $400 plus per night was not in my budget. If you want a beautiful room in a fantastic location, stay at the Cosmo. You get what you pay for.

Plus side: Hooters is within walking distance to the Tropicana and MGM Grand, which makes it a convenient location. They have 24-hour security in the pool area and, of course, in the casino. I felt safe while staying there and walking around with $500 cash in my pocket.

Another plus: I gambled in the casino and especially liked the $3 blackjack. Impossible to find on the Strip.

Overall, I'd give Hooters 2.5 stars. Two stars is too low, and three stars is a bit on the high side.

Check-in at the front desk was bad. The young lady was not kind at all. We requested the highest floor possible and she told us she only had the twelfth floor available and said everything else was occupied. We had some friends meeting us so I also asked if there were more rooms available on that floor close to each other. She said that they did have rooms available and all our friends needed to do was request the same floor. Upon entering our room there was a horrible stench and lots of nasty stains on the carpet that looked like dried up vomit. The lamp shades where all broken and the A/C was old school and made a lot of noise. When our friends arrived they were assisted by the same woman who assigned them the nineteenth floor after stating she no longer had available rooms on our floor. She lied to us about not having rooms available on a floor higher than the twelfth! Not that big of a deal, but nonetheless annoying. Besides that it took about an hour and about three phone calls to get our luggage up to our room! 

The Hooter's restaurant had roaches climbing up the walls!No joke!Even the staff saw them and didn't do anything about it. This hotel/casino is pretty run-down. The only positive side to my stay was the pool area. There are three pools in the same area with a waterfall which were clean and comfortable to swim in. They also have a DJ who plays cool jams. I don't plan to stay here again and neither should you. Save yourself from the disappointment and waste of money.

Travel agent was meant to book my daughter and me at Harrah's. My former in-laws live in Vegas and I just wanted a halfway decent, inexpensive hotel to stay while I picked her up and visited. Going through Priceline, they must have gotten their H's confused, and I ended up booked at Hooter's. Non-refundable. No exchange. A-HEM. I called Hooters, and said, ""Listen, I'm traveling to see former-in laws with my 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, boobs is not what I intended for her to get in her mind as a career choice and this booking was a mistake"". They insisted they are ""FAMILY FRIENDLY"" and would not refund. 

Family friendly, my ass. Tito and Jenna Jameson the Porn Star were all over. Boobage to the max, like staying in a filthy huge frat house with a four year old. Plus the undisclosed $15/day resort fee, ummm, for what? 
So I can sit in Dan Marino's Grill and order a kid's hamburger for 10 bucks? Or so I can sit in my shabby, moldy smelling room in which the air conditioner broke? The A/C broke, people. We are in the flippin' DESERT. An entire day and half a night without A/C. 
The engineer guy came up finally and fixed it in the middle of the night while my daughter was sleeping, and fortunately whatever blasted out of the vent didn't give us Legionnaire's disease...BUT...then....there was no water. The next day...full day was completely without water. Again, this is the DESERT. I called downstairs and was reassured that it wasn't just *me*, half the hotel was without water. Oh thank God, I thought I was hallucinating. I feel so much better. 

So to distract myself from the fact that I am getting the shaft, I decide to go online, check email find games for Little Daughter to play. They say it's free, but when I tried to log on from the room, it's another $10! Oh man, if I didn't have high blood pressure before, I certainly have it now. I called downstairs, and they said, ""Well, it *is* free - some places around the pool you can catch a signal from the Motel 6"". So I was envisioning myself with a little tinfoil hat trying not to get my laptop splashed, walking in circles til I picked up Internet. They do thoughtfully provide electrical outlets right next to the pool in case you want to plug in and have some drunk trip over your cord and yank your new HP laptop into the pool.  Or perhaps they are offering do-it-yourself electroshock therapy (you supply the cord -they supply the outlet and water) to rev up that heartbeat.  Takes Vegas entertainment to a whole new level. 


Little daughter splashed around in the ICY COLD pool until a sparrow somehow took a nosedive into it. It must have been shocked by the temp, as it couldn't seem to flutter up and out over the pool, and the waterfall kept buffeting it underwater. Suddenly, it got sucked into the drain thingie on the side of the pool. Maybe that's how Hooter's gets their wings. Anyhow, it was too far to reach, so, I couldn't let Little Daughter down by not saving the bird. I jumped out, took a few steps to uncover the closest filter lid and managed to reach birdie before she drowned. YAY! She dried off under a bush for a few minutes before flying off. That's my only happy Hooters story, and it's all about me saving a little bird. 

Let me get back to flipping  the bird to Hooters. In the end I got stuck with a bill over $400 for total CRAP. NEVER AGAIN. 
ZERO STARS. 
I hope it comes crashing down and all the boobs deflate like flaccid balloons. 
Everytime we pass a Hooter's, Little Daughter points and yells ""Mommy - that means boobies!  Why are yours small?""

All this place has got are some plain Jane girls in orange leggings and a Dan Marino Grill. The much-promoted $3 blackjack table is literally ONE table on the floor. Unsurprisingly, it's also the most crowded spot in the joint, so good luck pulling up a seat. I sat at the video poker machines and dropped $70 in about 20 min and the goddamn waitress didn't come by once to keep my blood alcohol level high enough to not start getting pissy about my losses. That fact alone will keep me out of here for a long time. 

One marginal positive note is that they have $0.25 wings from 12am-6am, although if you've ever eaten wings from Hooters you know that means you'll probably spend only a couple bucks to get high cholesterol, the caloric equivalent of 5 Whoppers and a long bout of diarrhea.

Positives:
Since I didn't actually partake take this with a grain of salt - cheap gambling, hotel rooms, food & drinks.

Negatives:
Somewhat disinterested staff, had to ask three different people for help before actually getting any.
Parking lot right out the front door (which foot traffic has to cross to get in) was beyond stinky - dont think I set my bar that high either on that.
They have two eating establishments, one casual and one restaurant style.  The ""casual"" one was shut down and the ""restaurant"" one had a 45 minute wait.  Let me be clear, there where two people waiting in line ahead of us and it was a 45 minute wait.  
The supposed promotional gambling deal they had going on took 15 minutes to locate and the place isn't big, then it ends up that it is roped off and you have to sign a list to utilize it.  The rest of the slots and tables had about 3 people on them.

It was hypnotic, and there is a strong possibility that the sign may have even winked at me (or maybe that I just needed to get some more sleep).  So I got a couple of people to walk with me across the street on an adventure to the Hooters Casino. 

From the outside, it looks like an oversize Hooters.  On the inside, the casino is tiny and smaller than anything I have seen on the strip.  We were able to walk through the entire casino in less than a couple of minutes.  There wasn't very many people in the casino, and there seemed to be more employees than patrons on a Saturday night.  All of the dealers were Hooters girls, deck out in their white and orange gear.  The theme of Hooters was evident and well maintained throughout.

When we got to the back of the Casino, I went into the store to check out what they had.  They had some cute Hooters branded cloths, and I found a jersey top that I liked to buy for my wife.  After that, we took a look out the back door of the casino to see the pool.  It was pretty sad.  There were just a bunch of dudes hanging out, and not a Hooter in sight.  The pool looked like a giant sized Motel 6 pool, and did not look like a fun place to hang out at all.  So we headed back inside towards the front of the Casino.  We passed two restaurants on the way.  One of them being a Hooters, of course.  When we got to the front there was another store that I did not notice when we first walked in.  This store had lots more cloths and Hooters paraphernalia, so I went in to check it out and ended up buying more stuff.  They had a special in the store that if you buy $35 of merchandise you get a free gift.  The clerk at the registered informed me that for a $1.50 I could buy a sacky bag.  I thought I was a $1.50 off of hitting the $35 mark and so I agreed to get the bag.  It turned out that the bag was another promotion, and that my free gift was actually a Hooters girl calendar...from 2010  :I

After buying all of the cute Hooters gear for my wife to wear, we went on our way.  Now that she has all of these cloths I don't have to bother going to Hooters anymore to check out the girls in the itsy-bitsy outfits.  I look forward to Val making me a Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich in one of her new Hooters outfits, and I'm pretty sure I won't go to this casino again.

I said ""Are you kidding me?"" I suggested going to Chinatown and getting some good, inexpensive food, like Thai, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and I had a car to take them all out there. But since it was 3 of them versus just me, it was Hooters.

Hooters Hotel and Casino is exactly like their restaurants. Girls in white Tees and little orange gym shorts. You would think that here in Vegas, this would be their flagship location and they would upscale it in decor, amenities, and staffing. 

Nope. 

Even though it is a hotel and Casino, it has the same look and feel of their restaurants. What do they call themselves? Tacky? They got that right.

Plus, Hooters has awful food. Deep fried, tasteless, unimaginative. It's food you might find in Talledega at the NASCAR races in the picnic coolers of the baseball cap wearing HVAC and Cable repair men. Only warmed up a bit. 

In Vegas, with all the beautiful women working here in the various service venues of shows, casinos, gentelmen's clubs, etc., Hooters has got to be the bottom of the barrel.

This is located in the Hooters hotel and casino. My cohorts and I were hungry and hungover so they wanted some chicken wings and what better place than to have some at Hooters?

This probably would not have been my first choice as I wanted to go somewhere new and different but my cohorts insisted on coming here. My cohorts order the chicken wings while I was the oddball and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with potato salad and mozzarella sticks as appitizers. While everyone else were drinking beer, I was too hungover to drink that soon so I got raspberry lemonade along with a glass of water.

The mozzarella sticks were delish as was the chicken sandwich. However that potato salad was awful. Just bland and no seasoning at all. I should have stuck with the baked beans. The raspberry lemonade was way too sweet. My cohorts enjoyed their respective meals, so they didn't have any complaints.

The restaurant as well as the hotel was too hot. Very uncomfortable eating our meal, especially while we were in recovery mode. The waitress did a good job overall. Overall we enjoyed our meal for the most part so I'll give this joint three stars.",oMCunvPAP2olnSMXCi5DWg,2,1,3,f59gqkIcQJ9HU5R7lmBozA

4373945,2015-11-11,3,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"This review is specifically for the HOTEL part of the property.

This place doesn't even come close to the 2.5 stars its rated on Priceline. Unfortunately we booked through PL so we had no recourse in the absolutely horrible experience we had here!
For starters, we check in at about 2 AM, yet still get charged for a resort fee which staff said was for the use of the pool (which was closed), parking (the garage was closed, we had to park in the Tropicana's lot), wifi (slower than cell tower, if you can connect) and 'other amenities'. I just drove 7+ hrs and wasn't in the mood to argue so I signed off on it, knowing there wouldn't be a hotel mgr there anyway. 
We get up to the room and upon opening the door, the room already had a funny smell. I've stayed in a lot of hotels, some nice, some not and this was BY FAR the worst. M6's in the middle of CA are better than this place. I walk into the bathroom and immediately I noticed the toilet was dirty as well as the vanity top/sink. The shower appeared clean but who knows... Once into the room we noticed it had once been flooded by a previous plumbing issue, obviously not properly repaired if the carpet was stained and peeling away from the wall. At least they repainted the drywall. There were enough stains on the carpet that the wife and I both didn't feel comfortable not wearing shoes in the room, ALL the time. The fan, or lack thereof in the bathroom was 'inconvenient' to say the least when one needs to 'take care of business'. The shower pressure was just 'ok'. But what was REALLY annoying was the fact that the temperature would swing, from cold to hot, while using it. Talk about annoying!! As soon as you'd get a good temp adjustment it would get cold, then you tough it out for a few seconds and it would get hot, then back to cold. Just an uncomfortable cycle. Try to adjust it at the wrong time and you're jumping out of the water before it scalds you.
We turned on the A/C since the room was stuffy and it emitted quite a noise, so we had to run it for a while before bed because there was no way one could sleep with it on. The sliding door to the outside, facing the pool area would not seal properly and let in excessive noise. This place is close to the airport so the noise was well above what would be considered 'average'. We were on the fifth floor, so maybe that's why they didn't care that the door couldn't be secured...I don't know...but the door couldn't be locked likely due to the fact that it wouldn't even close properly to seal out noise and weather. At this point I'm surprised the TV works! The clock radio was old and turned out to be a disappointment. It had an 'aux' jack on it so you could use your i-pod or phone for music, I thought 'that's cool'! It had such a humming noise it was unusable. The lamps looked like they all came from different hotels in Vegas that had closed, not one of them matched and they were all falling apart (leaning, nearly inoperable switches, etc). If I haven't painted the picture for you, I'm not sure how else I could.

BOTTOM LINE: Don't stay here. And I strongly suggest not booking the area in which this hotel is located on Priceline as you will be stuck, just as we were!",4qXTMirb3noPUosWj_Pfvw,6,1,1,Me26Iwfh2gWVXbUAbyIRJQ

We walked into the hotel to check in and after searching on the computer for a few minutes, the girl at the front desk says ""I can't find your reservation."" I didn't really understand because I had my confirmation number and email in hand...she said ""This happens a lot, it's not our fault..it's lasvegas.com's fault."" So we waited 30 minutes for someone in the back to contact lasvegas.com, but they finally found it. She was apologetic and gave us a room with a balcony since we had some trouble...

Walked to the elevator to go up to the room..got in...the doors shut and then it didn't move for a few minutes and the doors wouldn't open....Got stuck for about 5 minutes and when the doors finally opened we jumped into the other elevator and it actually worked. The next day there was a caution sign in front of the broken elevator to warn people not to use it but no one attempted to fix it, leaving only one working elevator for that whole side of the hotel. 

Upon walking into the room and seeing our ""balcony,"" I had to laugh to myself. It was only wide enough to step one foot out onto it and on the way to walking out, I noticed the sliding glass door was covered in fingerprints and an unknown substance, and when I slid the door open, it fell off of the tracks and remained that way throughout the remainder of our stay. 

Walked into the bathroom and noticed that everything was very old, outdated, and falling apart. There was a used wet washcloth (not ours) still hanging on the shower rod from someone else. Gross. Went to hang my clothes in the closet and found one, just one, hanger and the closet door track was filled with dead bugs, food and whatever else. 

Went to go to sleep for the night and noticed that the lock on the door didn't work. Went to crawl in bed and found that the bed frame was broken at the end....decided that was the least of our worries. 

One good thing was the room service. It was cheap and quick and very good.

The hotel / casino is off the strip so its a small drive...we figured it was worth the drive for a deal like that.  As you may know most of the big casinos offer free slot play to people who join their individual player clubs for the first time so it seemed like a great deal.

After driving and parking we waited in a big line to get our players club card and were instructed on which slot machines we could ""play"" our free slot money.  Turns out it was only on a small bank of ""promotional"" machines that you would only win a small amount of money if you hit one of those impossible jackpots.  The whole time we were there no one won anything.  Just like some other people have posted here it is pretty much false advertising...at least compared to other casinos.  

We also got a bunch of random casino coupons...one of them was a match play coupon for blackjack...I put 50 bucks down on a hand of blackjack with the coupon, won the hand and left the hotel with that money in my wallet.

4394659,2012-11-25,10,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Despite the 2.5 stars given on Yelp, we decided $42/night was a delightfully tacky, yet unrefined situation we were willing to dive head first into. Vegas served as the launch pad for our 5 day Southwest ""tour,"" so when booking our Vegas hotel the day-of we weren't exactly worried about splurging for a Bellagio experience.  When we scrolled across Hooters shocking $42 ticket price, giggled for a moment and then said ""what the hell.""  We were feeling so fancy, we splurged for the tower room for an extra five bucks.

The saying ""wine on a beer budget"" comes to mind when I decided upon my star rating for this hotel.  For $42, my top concern was two things: decent location and clean rooms. And ya know what? Hooters did a pretty darn good job in both categories. The hotel is located right at the end of the strip across from MGM, New York New York and Excalibur. The room isn't anything fancy - ha, in fact it has a few (definitely tacky) touches of Hooters with orange lampshades, knotty pine wood trim and Hooters artwork (not tatas; however, this would be more entertaining, but a sketch of a Hooters restaurant). 

The location is very easy to find off highway 15/Tropicana Avenue. Parking is free and plentiful.  There are times when I look for a hotel that is bubbling over with character and others when the hotel is serving one purpose: safe/clean place to rest my head. Vegas may not be my cup of tea, but Hooters will most likely serve as my launch pad the next time I'm here.

The room I stayed in had one power outlet and it wasn't by the desk.  The bathroom door didn't fit through the door frame for some reason so it wasn't able to shut.

I gave a star for the room service ladies and gents.  They were always greeting me and offered towels galore.  The second star is for their mini 24/hr convenience store located by the elevators and pool entrance.  Everything you need is in there.  

Speaking of the pool, it doesn't look like what it does in some of the yelp photos.  I think they renovated it and now it's just two pools. The waterfall and two ""mini"" pools are gone.

I wish I would have just stayed at the Stratosphere the whole trip. If you can afford another 100 bucks for a week please go elsewhere. My first room was a god damn mess. I've stayed at hotels way cheaper and have had way better accommodations. The staff was helpful in moving me to a different room, but the bed in my second room was even worse then the first room.

The food is gross, you can tell the quality is bad when you're up all night because you can't stop burping. I will never stay in this establishment again, nor will I ever eat in a Hooters or recommend them to anyone I know(funny, I never actually ate at one before this trip). I am extremely disappointed in this company, and expected at least a 3 star experience. Instead, I've been given a -1 star experience, right off the strip that has soured my first vegas experience.

I recently stayed at Hooters and let me say, don't be fooled by the exterior, its actually not that bad inside. Its spacious, and an average looking casino at best. (A lot of men stay here). 

One thing I must mention was the smell. As I arrived at Hooters, my palms began to sweat, because i didnt know what to expect. This was my first time staying here, and I was anxious to find out what my experience would be like. 
As I exited my vehicle, i immediately got punched in the face by a Mayweather hook. The odor that filled the air was the oder you smell in big cities walking down the street. It was sewage! The air smelled like crap! It was awful. 

As i held my breath and walked inside the casino, I hoped that the smell would be better in there. It was. When I walked in I noticed the layout. It was open, they had a few tables in the front and had loads of slot machines towards the middle-back of the casino.
 Check in took about ten minutes. The service wasnt the best. The individual who helped me seemed bored, and was a little rude. She handed me the key and pointed to the direction i needed to go towards. I don't even think she talked to me aside from that.

My room was very small, and really outdated, but i did have a lovely view of the strip. (Or part of it)
The bed was very uncomfortable, and I had multiple bad nights where tossing and turning kept me up. (I just couldn't get comfortable). 

The food was pretty good, if you've been to a hooters before, then you know its just average wings at best. 

The plus side to Hooters is the 3 dollar blackjack table, and the drinks. Drinks are real cheap. Furthermore the pricing to stay at Hoooters can't be beat. I found great deals on their website :)

Overall my experience was an average one. Its not the worst casino but far from the best... I probably won't stay here soon, i might give it another shot in the future though, depending on whether or not I can find better deals elsewhere.",MavUXBo4Kk0K8Kk-b3_F9w,2,2,2,H1iL9_AlSLLv1HV-jifvIw

We rolled in on Saturday evening, with plenty of time to find a place to crash for the night. We weighed our options and decided our hotel of choice would need to fulfill three of the following key factors:

*affordability
*location 
*high percentage of cute girls

After stopping at Barbary Coast, The Rio, and The Palms, I remembered my time working at Hooters Grand Avenue in Milwaukee, and we all realized there was a fairly new Hooters Casino that might just fit the bill. 

Well, it was affordable, at just $110 bucks on a Saturday night, and they didn't require a two-night minimum like some places do on a holiday weekend. So far, so good. 

Turns out, Hooters Casino Hotel is located next to the Excalibur, New York New York Hotel, and the MGM Grand, so there was plenty within walking, er stumbling, distance. 

At this point, Taylor's judgement seemed to be the least impaired (he was driving) as he didn't consume any road sodas, so it was up to him to verify the last key factor in our search. After further review, how could we *not* love the girls in their sexy Hooter girl uniforms? Didn't see any sausage, either. Only sexy ladies dealing black jack, roulette, craps, you name it. 

We weren't in Vegas for an hour, and we'd already hit the Jackpot.

We checked in promptly, and headed up the room for to get settled in and form a loose plan of action for the night ahead. 

After drinking and dancing at the Piano Bar and Coyote Ugly in the New York New York Hotel, we hit the gaming floor at Hooters where the cocktail waitresses kept the white russians stiff and flowing ALL night long. We didn't stop gambling and drinking until well after sunrise, my buddy Brian rolled in at 9:30 a.m. up a c-note and still drunk as a skunk.

Otherwise, it is a 2 star, if that.  To those who are complaining here...SUCKERS!  The internet can be used for things other than porn...and Yelp.  Moving on...

The man and I had an impromptu ""let's get the hell out of Dodge"" moment and we seized it.  We stayed here Tues, December 29 - Thursday, December 31.  We picked this place because it was cheap and close to the Strip (even though Downtown is better).    Based on the reviews, we were willing to risk some things.  So here is the summary:

* Yes, we did witness the parking garage elevator not working.  But it was only once out of 4 times using it and we were not hauling our bags in or out, so we were fine with walking 4 flights of stairs to the car.  To the poor ladies hauling out kids, bags and strollers....sorry.

*The bed was stiff as a board.  I can handle firm, but there was no bounce to this bed at all. 

*The plumbing system is old, but works.  Slow drain sink, slow flush toilet.  

*Our room was not dirty, just dated.

* We got hot water all the time, just fine.  I even took a shower around 11:00 a.m. and there was still plenty of water.

*Our room was missing the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign, which we only learned about when we heard the maids coming around and we needed to act on it.  I went to get one from the maids, but they did not have one.  I ran into one downstairs and she did not have one.  Another employee told me I had to get one from reception, so fine.  I asked for one and was told she would call someone to bring it up.  Totally inefficient and it does not make me happy when I have a hangover.

As for the casino...

*The free $100 slot play promotion is definitely one of those ""too good to be true"" things.  After you sign up for the lame Player's Club (I lost my card somewhere in the casino), you get a voucher and you walk into a roped off area.  An employee will insert a $100 bill into one machine that you choose.  They are $5 slot machines and you have to play the max (so $10 a pull).  If you are lucky enough to get to 1700 credits, you get $50.  Other than that, you are screwed.  Total lameness.

*Takes the cocktail waitresses FOREVER to bring you a drink.  I hate getting sober when I am waiting to get hammered.  

*Beware of the slow dealers that come on shift at 2:00 a.m. -- they may put you to sleep.

Overall, take heed of the reviews and make the decision yourself.  Will we stay here again?  Probably not.  But we do not think we made a bad decision since we went into it informed.",sRcrwanu_MpbanyKplTQoA,10,6,3,oB-nHlHhmtE-LHbJbAoGTg

The casino was very small, but all of the dealers and waitresses I had were nice. This casino is too far from the center of the strip, I will definitely consider a closer hotel.",z-R-_pNPK8FqHFSfC422SQ,0,0,2,hMhbCh_umD936LzKyrVu8Q

Half of a star because the hotel rooms come with that Hooter's orange colored lampshades, and that is kinda cool. Another star because I looked down from our window and saw that the hotel's pool had a waterfall and a big sandbox area. HAHA.

Part of me wants to give this place the benefit of the doubt because we did, in fact, cram 12 people into one standard hotel room. That's right, 4 people in the two beds, 8 people on the floor. The second night, two of our friends got a seperate room and said it was a million times better and cleaner. It might have been the lack of 10 other smelly drunk people around.

The room:
- The toilet broke the very first time it was used.

- On the back of our door, written in permanent marker read ""I'M WATCHING YOU :)""  uh.

- Mysterious basketball-sized red stain in the corner of the room.

- They actually have a little ad thing on the dresser between the beds that starts out in big print, ""Do you REALLY need clean sheets.....?"" followed by a description about how you shouldn't request to have clean sheets unless you really, really need them. As if any hotel's sheets aren't disgusting and questionable enough, the classy establishment that is Hooters is asking me to drunkenly pass out on some previously sexed-up vomit bed? Pass. (I ended up doing it anyway)

-NO HOOTERS STATIONARY. Wtf am I supposed to steal for a souvenier? I just want a Hooters pen, god.

The actual hotel:
- The elevator is the scariest elevator I've ever been on. And smells of burning rubber. And sounds like you're about to die. Squeeling elevator noises and shaking = bad.

- I got so lost just trying to get the fuck out of there and onto the strip.

- I didn't eat at the restaurant, but some of our friends did and said it was disgusting (coming from growing young dudes who will eat anything)

- The Hooters girls don't have hooters. I'm a girl and even I was a little appauled by this. They're just right-outta-high-school uggos that need a job. Lame. Have some dignity and get a boob job.

The staff all have negative attitudes. The customer service is none existent. The room I stayed in had an AC but it was extremely loud. Housekeeping didn't come until about 10 o'clock every night. I never put the do not disturb sign on my door so, it's no reason that they didn't come at a decent time. My shower was clogged the second night I was there. I called the front desk to see if someone could come fix it because we were about to go out and I needed to take a shower. They said they will send someone right away. A hour and a half past and no one came. I called back and it took about another 30 min for them to send someone. Furthermore, my room key stopped working and it was 4 in the morning. I was exhausted, So I called the operator to see if they could send someone to open the door for me. She placed me on hold and never came back to the phone. 25 minutes later I decided to go down to the desk and Tell them what transpired so they could give me a key. One of the ladies at the desk,the only nice one, Said she would a credit $30 to my account to use towards one of the restaurants at the Hooters Hotel. The next morning I checked in with one of the people at the front desk and proceeded to use my credit at steak and shake. The lady at the desk only says to use my credits and then check out. After I use my credits I went back to the front desk to check out. She told me I own $1.57 and when I asked her why she said because they do not comp tips which she did not tell me prior to ordering from the restaurant. I told her well just take the tip off, the only reason I even tipped was to make it $30 even. She told me she could not do that.

Yep... there's nothing special about Hooters honestly, but the real deal-sealer for here is that it was CHEAP, and since we were never really in the rooms, it wasn't a huge issue.  The hotel is located off the strip across from MGM, and parking (like everywhere else in Vegas) is pretty generous.

Rooms were small.  There were two queen sized beds for you and a friend to share. Ice and vending machines are available on each floor for your convenience (we definitely had a bath tub of liquor to start).  There is a pool outside that is open 24 hours, but be sure to have a shirt on when you come back in.  The staff doesn't like people who go in and out shirtless.  And another bad part... there is no wireless internet available. (shute, even Motel 6 down the street has wifi!?)

As for the Casino, it wasn't bad, although the Hooters $100 free play in slots is pretty deceiving.  I blew all of that in 12 rounds, so it is highly unlikely that you'll be making much money.  Although I did learn how to play craps that night!  Dealers were pretty legit.

The last time I visited I paid under $300 for six nights by booking in advance.  That's hard to beat anywhere.  They do charge a resort fee but, I've found that pretty standard in most Vegas hotels. 

The hotel is older and a bit worn around the edges.  Think an older Comfort Inn/Motel 6...  I have found that it is generally clean and the staff is helpful.   The beds are comfortable, the water pressure is ok and the AC works.  I don't know that I'd bring my wife there but, it's ok for traveling alone.  You really can't ask for much more than that at the prices that they charge.  

The location is great: directly across the street from the MGM Grand,  next door to the Flamingo and maybe a 5 minute walk to the strip.  

I agree with the previous reviews about the parking garage.  It really is a dump.  However, there is an ample sized parking lot and I never had a problem finding a space.  

I decided not to stay there during my most recent visit to Vegas as they filed chapter 11 bankruptcy in early August.

The restaurant has that familiar wood paneling look with plenty of TVs all around to check out the game.  We got here around 3ish so we had no problems getting seats.  We got our menu and it's your typical bar and grill items here, so we're talking about burgers, sandwiches, strip steaks, chicken, and of course their most popular food item, Wings.

We decided to get a couple rounds of beer and also some wings and their chili cheese fries.  The service was a bit slow, but when we got our food I have to say they were generous.  The wings were pretty big and we got a big pile of chili cheese fries.

I don't know how they cook their wings, but have to say I always thought Hooters had some of the best wings out there and this has lived up to it's reputation.  Nice juicy wings with a crispy out side.  The fries here were also very good.  Plenty of chili with nice chunks of meat with a ton of cheese just made for good greasy junk food to watch college football.

The eye candy here wasn't quite what we were hoping for.  When you think of Vegas and Hooters, you have a certain image in your mind.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations we were hoping for.  But no matter, the food and the college football games were still good.

As to ratings, to be honest, the Las Vegas Hooters is really no different than any other Hooters I've been too.  I wasn't expecting the Sapphire or something, but was hoping for just a little bit more ""Las Vegas"" to it.  Overall, the food hit the spot and the wings were good but honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to coming here when you will get the same experience at any other Hooters restaurant across the country.

First of all, this hotel isn't upscale at all, nor does it pretend to be. It's pretty no-frills, with the main attraction being that Hooters concept. It works just fine, as the place is just very beach-y without being dumb. I don't know if that makes sense when I write it out, but it makes sense when you come to this place. 

As a local, I appreciate that this resort is near the Strip without it being right there in all the action... that is, I like that I can go in right after leaving UNLV and then heading back out on Trop without hitting too much Strip craziness. 

Now, on to my review of the Hooters restaurant: I love the restaurant. I love the wings. I love that the girls are flirtatious. I love that the beers are always ice cold. I love that there are no crazy vegan options to clutter the menu. The restaurant is clearly geared toward dudes, which makes it even more appealing to me. The wings here, though, are the main show. They have different levels of hotness for you to sample from, and none of them disappoint. Even the hottest ones are still super delicious. Plus, the waitresses are really on.

Other casinos make you feel like you are in New York, or Paris. This one makes you feel like you are no longer on the Las Vegas strip. On the plus side, the rooms are cheap. They have a pool.

Review of Hooters Casino Hotel

Reviewed 1 week ago via mobile

I stayed at Hooters from May 21st through May 25th 2018. This is going to be a little longer than usual review but worth it if you read it.

Let's start with the cons first: 
1. The room sink drain and tub drain was clogged. So I ended up taking showers for 4 days in standing water. Maintenance came through to fix it but it did not work they told me they were coming back to snake it but that never happened either. Maintenance told me this was an ongoing problem with the pipes.
2. I stayed in room 546 when the room above me showered the pipes rattle as loud as you can imagine the problem was it was 2am in the morning.
3. Had to wait to check in till after 4 when we got to the room to our surprise it was still dirty see pictures below.
4. The music by the pool was good until we found out it was one CD that played over and over and over again my God please just turn on a radio.
5. The room air conditioner was broken and loud when it came on but blew no cold air. Yes that's right no air conditioning in Vegas.

Now let's talk about the pros: 
1.I got the room at a discounted rate$28 a night with a 25$ a night food voucher so basically I paid $3 a night for the room.
2. The food was good and there was no limitations on the vouchers. Yes you can even buy alcohol.
3. During our stay they must have been training new bartenders we got a lot of free drinks so that was cool. 
4. The staff in the Hooters restaurant we're fabulous great job. A couple of the waitresses by the pool disappeared it was hard to get a bucket of beers.
5. The weight room was excellent. 

As far as strip hotels go Hooters is the Motel 6 of the big resorts. NO; I take that back I would not want to insult Motel 6. Let's face it people Hooters is a very big brand name so my expectations were high. Remember the title mixed thoughts what I stay here again? It's me and the boys were going out for a weekend trying to save money with food vouchers I would give it a try. If I was taking my girl to Vegas I would just take a few extra dollars stay at the Rio or the stratosphere or some other recently remodel Resort. If you're the kind of person that parties 20 hours out of the day and not in your room that much the environment at the hotel was cool. 

It is very clear this hotel is understaffed throughout the day so this reflects on the hotel manager and those who are in charge of filling positions the cleanliness of these rooms gives Hooters a disservice based on their...

4615377,2015-03-29,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Honestly, you get what you pay for, so it cracks me up when I see 1 star reviews for staying here. 
I stayed here back in October 2014 for Frozen Fury to see the LA Kings play at MGM Grand Garden Arena. Because of the weekend the rates jumped up to $92 (with taxes and resort fee through Travelocity) a night. It was the best deal out there!! We stayed one night, and I was pretty please with the hotel. The checkin staff were very friendly. Checkin is 4pm, but our room was ready a hour before, so it's good to ask!!! The girl was very quick with checking us in, and by 3:15 we were in our room. The room itself IS somewhat outdated, but it's Hooters and the theme is wooden Florida atmosphere. We had a nonsmoking double beds, which was perfect. The room itself was pretty clean, so I never saw any stains or anything. Their casino is small but it's nice cause it's quick to find where you need to go! The casino staff were very friendly as well. We ate at Hooters for lunch and also for breakfast the next morning! Sign up for the play club, because you get free play (I didn't win though, I suck at gambling) and $5 off a meal! Lunch was fine and pretty quick! I had a buy one get one wings, and basically it tasted like Hooters wings! The fried pickles were the best I've had at any Hooters. Breakfast was really good surprisingly as well! I had a Bloody Mary with mine! The convenience store is open 24/7, so you can get your Krispy Kremes and beer when you need it. Prices aren't bad at Hooters and the store. The Hooters girls are pretty friendly, except there was one who had a terrible attitude who worked in their Hooters merch store. You could tell she hated her job. Other than that though it was fine.
Location is great because you are across the street from the MGM entrance. We spent a lot of time in MGM honestly. Fat Tuesdays is there also, along with 2 monorail entrances. Also very close to Luxor and Excalibur. 
I am returning in mid March for spring break and I am staying at Hooters once again! I scored an awesome 2 night deal through Travelocity for $85! We will be spending time at Hakkasan and some other places! It's just a room honestly, and how often are you in it? It's cheap but saved you money for drinks and going out!",S5i1OxyRjkAI_EXOYHVb5g,1,1,4,sSLN1cetv8Fc5_UVihwjMg

It's so near the strip, and especially if you're just looking for a clean enough place to stay, it really does the trick. The food downstairs (Steak n Shake, Hooters) is really convenient, and the tables are pretty decent. The $1 blackjack was great.

The servers in the Steak n Shake were pretty slow for our breakfast, but otherwise, the employees in the hotel are very nice and very helpful. The dealers at the tables are all quite friendly and fun, as well as the security and the servers in general.

4632638,2013-03-17,1,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"this is the letter I sent to the casino manager and food and beverage manager:

I just completed a 2 night stay at your Hotel. It was a memorable stay but for all the wrong reasons. I got there early and was allowed to go to my room earlier than the 4pm check-in time.SO that was nice. However I noticed things after looking around that were not the best, Room 526 had a huge seam in the carpet that shows it needs replacing as well in the far corner of the room it looked as if someone deficated in the corner was wiped up not actually cleaned. The bathroom looked to have tile missing around the toilet.

Beyond that my food and beverage experience was equally disappointing. Seeing as this was the basis for the company it really saddened and quite frankly made me angry. First off on Thursday at midnite...Primetime for casinoes, there were 2 servers for the casino floor. 2 SERVERS!! The tables were full and the back where the machines were while not as packed still had people there. At the next table there were guys complaining receiving drinks for an hour!! The girls were being yelled by the patrons because of slow orders. Even one of the pit supervisors acknowledged that they had to wait that long. THAT IS INEXCUSABLE!!! I never got my drink and told the bartender that I was leaving to go to the Tropicana to play and maybe get a drink or two.That was Thursday.

Friday night the drink situation was better but still could be improved. However when I decided to get a late night bite and go to the restaurant, I took a spot at the bar. I sat there checked out the menu and figured someone would be along to get the order. The couple next to me had finished and one the bartenders gave them their check, it got paid and the bartender went on her merry way. Meanwhile I am still sitting there not being served. After 10 minutes of waiting at a half full bar, I am finally acknowledged by a busser, I ask the busser for a manager and explain to the manager the situation of my waiting and his only solution was to do a drink order. Not happy and that was Friday.

On Saturday. I go and find out I have enough points for a meal so I decided to try again and get food. Get sat and acknowledged this time, but this time I am near a bussing/drink station. The staff was going back and forth regarding a lack of coffee available. AT 9AM!! And what I was hearing was not fun as both the bussers and waitresses were giving major attitude towards each other.

I myself am in the travel industry and am in a leadership position. I know when my agents go out to deal with the public that they are on stage at all times. And if there is a breakdown its not only a reflection on them but the company they represent. You have a chance to save your image and save business by addressing these issues. As far as I am concerned even though I am a budget minded consumer, I will add to my budget if it means no longer staying at your property,",q1CSVDQOHz-kSnME-6wXeA,0,0,1,w29ZPAJORdnyAV2nK1Y__w
4636627,2008-01-22,2,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"This place is dirt cheap!!! The parking lot is scary as heck.  There is a very small self-park lot out front and a garage adjacent to the hotel.  The garage is very high - maybe like 7-8 stories but is so freakishly small.  After spending 10 minutes try to find a parking spot on the 7th floor, my friends and I enter the elevators and pray not to die as the shaft is shaking and making funny weird noises.  Besides praying for our safety,    we are holding our breath because there is a smell combination of vomit, urine, and shit - no kidding!  Anyways, besides the parking situation, the casino is small and decent.  They were running this suited blackjack promotion where if you got a suited bj, you got a free Rush Hour 3 DVD.  My friends and I ended up winning around 10 and selling them to tourists from Canada for a few bucks. 

Moving on, I did not stay in their hotel rooms but based on the casino, I would much rather go somewhere else unless its free.  There's no reason to come to Hooters besides to eat their fat inducing hot wings.  There is also no ""eye-candy"" here... if you want to see very beautiful cocktail waitress go to Bellagio or Wynn.",MuhUC0v3qBBTj6D2DO0H_w,2,1,2,XFNeW6VSOhEz5oQiFAMmHA

I would characterize it this way...If you are expecting 5 stars, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for an alternative to the strip and save a few bucks, there is a reason why it's cheaper. I did not have any bug or shower issues. I did pay the extra money for a 2 room jacuzzi suite upgrade, since the rooms are pretty cheap to begin with. Ended up on the top floor with a strip view. I would say that is the best way to make this a much better alternative. Top floor jacuzzi suite anywhere else and you would be broke. Food was good but not a lot of options. Too cold to check out the pool, but it looked nice passing by. $1 blackjack tables and $10 beer buckets are nice. I joined the slot club (ALWAYS join the slot club, you never know what you'll get for signing up) and was amazed at how fast the points added up. Never been anywhere even close to this speed of accumulation. Easily had enough points for free wings, breakfast or a small bottle of liquor from the shop after about a half hour.

This place has the worst customer service and food compared to other Hooters locations I've been too. The sauce they gave us (medium) looked like butter or cheese. I confirmed it with the lady and she said it was medium sauce. It wasn't good.

4715121,2017-03-25,1,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Basic hotel, incomparable to other hotels/suites I've stayed in Vegas. Nothing much going on really. Our hotel room is clean okay...but plain and dull. Also no microwave, need to pay extra if we want fridge in the room. We have tiny patio but we are directly above their generator (I think) so it's noisy when we go there. Basic pool area, no character. It's somewhat cheaper that most hotels. But if you think about it, just adding $20-$50 a night you get a nicer-looking hotel with better location.

Anyways, it's good that it's near MGM monorail, also their hotel staff are accommodating, no complaints about that, plus free valet parking. Complimentary bottled water every day, has coffee-maker, hair drier, iron, and decent-sized table. So all in all still gonna give them 3 stars!

Review #31:
this place will surprise no one; if you take Hooters, and build a casino around it, voila!; it sort of has a semi-beach-joint, Margaritaville-type vibe, but I suppose so does the restaurant chain sort-of/kind-of; there is actually 1 other dining option here, but get your damn ass into the great big Hooters (no pun intended) restaurant and order up some damn chicken wings!; overall, I was disappointed that there were not scantily-clad buxom servers everywhere in the casino, so set your expecations accordingly; this is definitely a low-to-midscale type of joint with not a heck of a lot to recommend it.  It should maybe get 2.5 stars, and I originally had rounded up for the sake of boobies everywhere, but upon reflection, I can't give this place more than 2 stars, considering the competition in Las Vegas; best craft beer bet = ha! it's Hooters, so at best it's a bottle of Sam Adams if you're lucky",sg3wRRtKMfugbO7A3AX4Ew,1,0,2,hqk2M6P83ikya-N0tPKcWg

If you go online, they have room deals that give you coupons - including $25 gift cert for Dan Marinos.  

Dan Marinos is not fine dining, but pretty good for a hotel restaurant.  (I recommend the ribs)  The Dam is a great place for breakfast or lunch.  The Hooters Restaurant is the usual (but I dont eat at them anywhere else ...).  

There is the Bait Shop, where you can get coffee, sandwiches, salads, fruit, etc. quickly and easily.

My girlfriend and I stayed in the ocean view room. but we got the strip view instead, 7th floor, amazing for the price we paid, avg. $35-40/night + their suite w/a Jacuzzi was about $90-120/night, and that was sweet as well.

The room is clean, Strong shower head and soft bed. I don't know why people are complaining about stained carpets and urine smell, our room smelled like Pina Colada with a Carribean theme. 

We got $100 each for their promotional slot machine deal. 
24 hour room service, but if you dine at Mad Onion from midnight-6AM, they have sweet deals on Breakfast + Wings. 

The dealers are friendly, and the bartenders are super nice.

Plus, the location is awesome, ""off the strip"" but walking distance to Tropicana, Luxor, MGM, & Mandalay Bay.

Here are some things you should know:
-the parking situation is a kind of annoying, lots and lots of rough speed bumps
-if you have a lot of luggage, its annoying to transport it from the parking garage to your room. 
-the elevator from the parking garage to the hotel is creepy, but the elevator from the casino to your room is alright.

- Price (usually one of the cheapest in the area, I once got $30 a night rooms over a weekend, in the off-season). Suites and jacuzzi suites (REAL jacuzzis, not sad, fancy bathtubs that 2 people can't sit in) are pretty affordable too! Those also have wet bars with minifridges.

- Location, just off the strip!

- 24/7 pool and jacuzzi

- Friendly service

- Spacious, clean rooms

Cons:

- Room service food is pretty shitty. Nothing has any flavor, and they always miss something ( a spoon, more coffee cups, etc).

- Not much of a variety of restaurants

- Although they're clean, the facilities are pretty old, and run down in some areas.

- Bored, overstaffed security who do things like question you if you go outside in the alley to talk to a friend in private. 

- Inconvenient parking with scary elevators

Once I get to the front desk they have no idea what I'm talking about and Marco front desk tells me there will be a wait for my next room. I informed him I was told a room was already being held for me. At this point I start to get frustrated and ask what happen to the room that was promised. He pretty much told me he can refund my money and I can find another hotel. I reminded him that all hotels are booked and its march madness right now. He said again he can refund me to go somewhere else. At this point I ask for a manager. Imelda comes over and again reminds me she can refund my money to go somewhere else. Nothing they promised me was followed through and now I'm pissed. I finally give up and ask for names and let them know I will be filing a complaint. Then I give my phone number to them to call me once they pull their heads out of their asses. As I am walking to the elevator Imelda calls me and said she has a room ready that's a suite with one bed and a pull.

We should have gone to the Orleans and partied with the senior citizens, since they have more brains and personality and they have a poker room. 

I don't even recall the last time I have given a 1 star to any business or ever at all. This Hooter's hotel and casino is not what I remember going to over ten years ago. They lack the amount of gaming tables such as craps and there is no longer a poker room (A blackjack dealer told me that their old poker room did not attract any players)...not hard to imagine why. 

This hotel and casino is your destination if you want to be depressed. The Hooters girls could care less if anyone is there. The only exception is Iris. Iris if you are reading this, you are too good for this place. Find another place that suits your lovely and caring personality. Because this establishment does not care. 

The room we stayed in had a weird smell and the floor was gross. I kept my shoes on for the most part. The bathroom looked like it wanted to fall apart. The shower temperature kept changing on me. I hated it! The TV is so old and our remote control was falling apart. Not a lot of outlets to plug phones for charging. The beds seemed ok. Just ok enough to get a few hours of shut eye.
The next day, when we came back to our room, the beds were even not done and we were only given new towels. 

Customer service ranged from sorta good to bad and somewhat ok. The good is some employees. Brenda helped me with the slot machine rewards card. The bad is the one manager behind the casino cage that hit the decline button on accident when my friend tried to get a $500 cash advance. She tried to play it off and tried to pass it off to him like he declined it. My friend saw her hit the decline button on her end! The best that they could do for him is a $20 bonus slot play. WOW! What a compensation! My friend was assed out of his $500 and all the best they could do is give him a $20 slot bonus. Super incompetence and no compassion at all. Their management and whoever is controlling this business is heading in the wrong direction. There is so much potential. Beautiful girls that could deal Poker and Craps...What a combo! However, no one wants to even try over there. How about bring in John Taffer to fix this place!

Ahead of checking in we requested a non smoking room away from the elevators and got 1147 which was an awesome room in the Ocean Tower with a great view of the strip. The room was clean.

I tried to come when it wasn't rush hour so I was always seated immediately. There are two sides of the restaurant, one for adults 21 and older and then the family side. I have been seated on both sides, but prefer the family side as it's more open and has a lot more light. I don't like eating in the dark!

Food is good here, probably the best thing about this location. I've had the wings, chicken sandwich, fried pickles and curly fries. All delicious. Food usually comes out quickly. The girls that work there are your average Hooter girls. Skinny and boobs. Most don't have a personality, they just do their job and that's all. Some will smile, some will make conversation, but it seems like the girls are nicer to the people they think will leave them a bigger tip.

It was reasonably clean and comfy, however the bed frame was broken and sticking out from under the bed and it cut me. After complaining and doing an incident report we were moved to a room on the 17th floor. This room had more floor space but looked beat up. It was very dirty, part of the wall was broken, and the sink and shower were backed up. Also this room had a coffee maker but no coffee, only sugar and cream packets. Lame. So finally after settling into our second room we got a rewards card for gambling. When we signed up we got a coupon book for a total of 10$ off our meal at Hooters, a 15% coupon for the gift shop, and a couple of gambling related coupons. 

The pool was descent. There was a DJ, beer pong, ping pong, corn hole, a waterfall, and a bar. I was stoked at how cheap the bar was. Vegas charges up the ass for drinks but this bar at the Hooters pool was great. 

The rooms were some of the cheapest on the July 4th weekend and the location is great, hopefully won't need to stay there again though.",zb7VvE0zy9Ph3Bj_G2oc9Q,0,0,2,K0ahY5ibiDSgIgzzWpI2CA

You know, the one with the dead coyote being picked apart by the Vultures. Yeah, that's the one. That would seem like a suite at the Ceasar's during a free money give away to every room compared to the hell hole that is the Hooter ""Hotel"". Right when I get to my room, I think it's not to bad. Little view of the pool, 2 beds, and a door. Functional right?? That's where the good times ended for that room. Right when I went to open the ""balcony"" door to have a look over the pool, the door was already off the railing. Luckily my buddy and I were able to place said door back on the railing. So with our door from finally closed, we decided to turn on the A/C as it was hotter than the Devils asshole after Indian food night in hell in our room. Low and behold it doesn't work. So after tinkering (flipping the knob until something happened) for a while, it goes from summer on the sun to a nice cooled room that now smells of antifreeze. So we let it blow it's little heart out when it decides that it had an epiphany and decided to change its lifeless being and become a fire breathing dragon. So here we are back to summer on the sun. I can't help but laugh as we turn off the demon spawn of Elsa and Trigon (Comic book villain). We decided, the next morning, to head to another casino where our friends were at thinking that at least we'll have a clean room to come back to. Wanna guess what didn't happen????? You got it!!! No one came to clean anything. I know that we're grown men and we should be able to keep a clean room (which we did for the most part), but I mean come on. Same towels in a pile on the floor. Same way the beds were left. Not even as much as an eyelash was moved. We clean up the room, wash up (face towel after my shower) and headed out. Next day, we decided to see if something would change. Oddly enough it did. Someone came up to our room and made one of the beds and left some water bottles. Towels were still in a pile though. We start laughing and brush it off. Decided that it's not worth talking to management over as I'm leaving anyway.

I honestly think people need to take into consideration that at Hooters you get what you pay for. If you are paying $20 for a hotel room in Vegas do not expect to get a 5 STAR, luxury ""Wynn"" experience. 

What we got for our $20 per night was the following:

1 clean, very basic hotel room.
20 free wings at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel.
2 free frozen drinks at the pool bar, plus one additional drink because it was ""ladies week""
2 free ""American"" breakfasts at The Mad Onion.

In addition to all the freebies, we received excellent customer service from everyone we interacted with at Hooters. All the hotel bars have $1.50 Bud/Bud Light if you are looking for cheap beer. Room Service will deliver Hooters wings to your room. The pool is open 24/7. There is a pretty decent fitness room/gym. If you are so inclined, there is a tattoo parlor in the hotel. The location is good...It is a very short walk to the Las Vegas Strip from the hotel.

Yes, the service at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel is slow.
Yes, the parking garage and elevators are a little dingy.
No, it did not smell like poo, urine, sewage, raid, or anything else that people have complained about. 

Two items of note:
There is an $8 resort fee per day.
There were many people on our floor who sat outside of their rooms, in the hallway, and smoked. So FYI, your room may be non-smoking but the hallway is not. 

If you are just looking for a cheap, clean, no-frills place to crash, Hooters will serve the purpose. If you are looking for anything more than that, this is not the place for you. Move along...nothing to see here.",QmH5O1JHDOBvUqzr4vz5-Q,22,9,4,yTx4DxGmEHLos_Ge9IjPig

Only one person working, but another gentleman came out on the floor and ask if anyone was just signing up as he could start the process.  Since I only needed a replacement card and redeem the coupon, he couldn't help me, but it will still nice to see someone paying attention to the line.  

The machines are mostly a few years old, a sprinkling of newer ones, but not very many.  This casino is a good example of ""Here's an empty corner - let's put another slot here!""  That doesn't really both me, but paints a picture of what the casino looks like.

We lived in SD and decided out of nowhere to bid on room on priceline. If we got it, we were coming to LV, if not - we'd stay home. Friday night 5 pm- we won our bid @ HOOTERS HOTEL & CASINO. Not quite exactly how I envisioned my 1st time in LV, but I made the best of it. 

BUNGALOWS: WOW.. If you can, stay in the tower. I never got to see those rooms but anythings GOT to be better than this. The room itself was ok but felt like a room in the 80's in Miami. Like something out of Miami Vice. THe boards didnt quite meet together in the restroom, there wasnt a blow dryer? oh wait, found it in the closet. It too was from the 80's. But worst of all, there was no elevator to the 2nd floor in the bugnalows. THERE WAS NO ELEVATOR TO THE 2ND FLOOR IN THE BUNGALOWS. What the... We had to lug our luggage up the stairs. Glad I didnt pack the way I normally do. The bed wasnt that comfo but lets face it your 1st time in LV you're not spending that much time in your room. It was a great economical way to enjoy our LV trip. I'd give one star for the rooms alone. Literally Holiday Inn Express is nicer than this. They get an extra star b/c of Dan Marino's. 

Great location! right across from the MGM and NYNY -you're entrance to the great strip. I think thats why I have a secret love for MGM. That and it reminds me of Tupac. I still miss that fool. 

DINING: Well we got in super late so we ate here @ Dan Marino's. Pleasant surprise! This place was freakin good! There was a long line of people waiting to eat and we thought wow, that's a long ass line, must be really good so we picked this place over the Hooters rest. in the back. Well turns out the line was waiting for some wing special at 11 or midnight that you get an obscene amt of wings for a low low price. We saw some lady walk out w/ literally 3 completely stuffed white strafoam boxes-- to the brim w/ wings. no shame - and she was by herself! 
I had the small ceasar salad w/ grilled ckn, super cheap like $7.99 and it was delicious. prob. 2nd best I've had next to Outback. thats another review!
My bf had the steak special and he loved it. SO much food for such small price $9.99. It was quality food too. not the left over meat they shovel out to you like @ Longhorn. I'd def. add this to my rotation if I was in the area more.'

HOOTERS REST: blah. I've had better I've had worse. One girl insisted on jump roping w/ a guy @ the table and since I was the only gf there w/ 3 guys -(not my idea btw) she chose mine. He was upset I didnt stop it but it was a dbl edge sword. If I stopped it I'm THAT gf. If I didn't he was upset @ me for letting him look dumb. Oh well. I've been to several Hooters and this never happened. 

FREE $100 in slot play huh? Its a $100 bill they give you to play the roped off slots that are rigged not to win and you bet $10 a hand. No, nobody wins with this. Its funny. We've never been back since this.

I could of pulled out more money(which my boyfriend had in his had) or I could of waited for a new shoe or anything I wanted.

Frank had no right to ask us to leave. We are spending money there, not him.

So there are some great positives...
1) The casino is small but because it is not huge the smoke is kept to a minimum and you arent walking through large clouds of smoke
2) Their pool is very nicely organized and great for kids
3)  $29 rooms are simple and affordable. No bells & whistles except for the coffee machine and TV. Which usually doesn't matter because all you do is sleep in them
4) Free parking & Valet with room . You may not think this is important but it is huge.
5) Just off the strip but close enough you can walk easily
6) HOT showers

Some meh's
1) Despite being close to the airport you really cannot hear the airplanes so dont let that be a deterrent
2) The room is like your college dorm. 4 Walls, a TV, beds and a desk. I had to ask 3 times for a chair to the desk. Do not expect a refrigerator and if you want one it will be $25/night. Considering we paid $29/night for the room, we just brought coolers and used their free ice. Saved a lot of time and money.
3) Our beds had no bed bugs. yay!
4) Thermostats were solid
5) The TV is an old Zenith style..no HDMI for cheating on the laptop with movies

Finally, of course, negatives...
1) Free, albeit slow compared to what you are used to, WIFI
2) Resort fee of $15/night NOT included in booking.com regardless of what booking said (this is for the wifi, parking)
3) Not a lot of hang out options and no buffet option
4) Cell service in the rooms is terrible. I was gonna cheat on the wifi by hooking up my cell to the lappy but it got worse coverage. Again you probably dont care since you wont be in the room too often
5) DO NOT believe booking sites. We asked for a king bed and got 2 queens. 

Here is the real thing: it's $29/night .So if you are looking for an inexpensive place to crash and plan on doing things elsewhere, this is a good deal. If you are looking for the extras like a spa or resort you will be very disappointed.

It's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. 

The drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. 

They sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. 

It wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... 

Every shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.

Sadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.

In the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. 

I paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. 

If you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.

4983051,2011-01-29,1,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I will admit, the idea of booking a room at a hotel from a company that makes their money by marketing hot wings with big breasted women seemed a little bit scary, but with a smaller budget than usual, and a huge hankering to go to Vegas, I crossed my fingers and went with it...and was immensely pleased with my decision. 

The total cost of my room (split with a friend of mine and without the stupid resort fees) was 88 dollars for 2 nights. Now I don't know about you, but to me, that is a steal anywhere, and especially in Vegas. Again, I was worried that I had just thrown myself into a trashy, rundown dump of a place but again, I was wrong. The room was clean and comfortable, complete with a sliding door and dinky little patio, not good for anything, but great for airing out the room and letting in some fresh air. The beds were also came as surprise. They weren't the biggest beds I've ever seen in a room, but they were incredibly comfortable, and clean. Sheets were soft and felt washed. (I've stayed in other hotels where the sheets were ""Clean"" but smelled old and  musty). Even the bathroom was a nice once. Big shower, nice long counter top, comfy toilet. Only bummer was there was no fan to keep the air fresh, but then again, I was in the room so little, it didn't really come to my attention.

I was worried about location as well. It's off the strip, down Tropicana, but even then, it's only about a block from the main drag, and an easy block at that. It may be the last real ""Casino"" on Tropicana, but it's amazingly close to MGM, New York New York, Excalibur, and Luxor, all of which can be walked to in less than 5 minutes. 

The Casino itself is on the small side, with fewer tables and slots than most larger ones, but they do have 3 dollar blackjack 24/7, even if it's a little difficult to get on the table at 11 pm. But I'm not a huge gambler and rarely gamble at the hotel I stay at so the small atmosphere didn't bug me in the least.

Not too many complaints then other than some of what others have said. Parking is easy to get to and close to the hotel but the garage is oddly designed, and covered in random places with annoying speed bumps, the outer elevators are, as someone else stated, creepy: they're dirty, scratched, and oddly cold, kinda like a horror film (but then again the ride is like 10 seconds each way, and you're in the actual car for so little, you forget these things as soon as you enter the casino). And finally, while the garage is close to the casino, the elevators are all the way in the back so if you have a lot of luggage, be prepared to lug it all the way from the rear of the casino to the check in counter all the way at the front. 

Simply put Hooters is the best value for your hard earned cash. Sure, you could go spend 200 or 300 a night on a room at the Aria, or Caeser's palace, or you could save all that money for other things and book a cheap cheap, quality room at Hooters.",DgKw46Xo1U38zXI7FN5Vsw,0,1,4,bB7Dt9r7u8fRElRw9TrByA

There were lots of poor reviews for reasons mentioned more than once and it made me really apprehensive about my stay. Because my reservation was unrefundable, I decided to give it a shot. We were greeted by very friendly staff, the gentleman checking us in made us really feel at home. The restaurant was open 24 hours along with the sundry shop, the pool was private and beautiful. There was also a nice little fitness center. There were some downfalls as far as the actual shape of the hotel, due to how old it is, but it was a small sacrifice to have privacy and low maintenance neighbors. Nothing is more annoying then having a million eyes on you all the time to make sure that we aren't the ""reckless group of hooligans in Vegas that will tear the room apart"". The staff was very relaxed and friendly from the guy at the door to the cleaning lady, to the waitresses and bartenders and the casino floor staff as well. The dealers were excited to make us some money, and was nice to see a lot of them had been there for years. There was a sweet Asian lady working the floor and always reminding us to use our rewards card which was really easy to use at all the slot machines and tables.

-Clean cheap rooms
-Great view of the Strip
-Horrible parking garage
-Casino and Hotel aren't that big so you don't have to walk far in those heels to get back to the elevator.
-No much to eat (See Mad Onion review).
-Close enough to other Hotels so you can bounce around

-Casino floor staff are annoying as hell! While playing a slot machine I was ID ed about 10 times.

Daily ""resort"" charges are exhorbitant.  $29 + 13.38% tax!  Also, they charged me $22.68 for early check-in fee.  We checked in at noon rather than waiting until 3PM.

Check in was 4pm and my rooms were not ready till after 7pm.

So we wait, and come back an hour later. Room is ready.. Good thing was we got upgraded to a tower room as opposed to a bungalow room.

Otherwise, the casino itself, was pretty nice.
Other thing that happened, was the next day after waking up from a drunken slumber at almost 2pm, we left at around 3pm to meet up with some friends, and called room service to have the room picked up and cleaned by the time we got back.

So I get there, empty bar, but no service to be found. I wait five minutes, and finally the bartender acknowledges me and I get an overpriced bud light. But that's the least of my worries...

The real reason I came there was to get some wings. So I went to the restaurant, and there were two hostesses who seemed more than annoyed with my presence (like who is going to seat him / where are we going to seat him, when the restaurant was more than half empty). 

But again, that wasn't my problem... After 15 mins of sitting there, and knowing the whole time what I wanted to order (recall that I had that whole time walking there to contemplate life) I finally went to the bartender, told him I'd been there forever, and said I'd like to order. The bartender looked at me like I was an idiot, and accused me of seating myself. So that tassel went on for a while, and we finally resolved that issue after he went to the kitchen to yell at the only people who were actually doing their job. (Side note, the bartender was actually really nice / doing his job too, and an innocent victim in all this).

The real problem was the waitress who showed up twenty minutes after the fact. She instigated that I was going to order and run without paying. Wtf, what is it against brown people and this restaurant? Well after this argument, and me presumably winning, she finally took my complicated order of ten regular wings. Another fifteen minutes went by...and at this point I thought I'd make a simple request for water (I guess they had expected me to eat dinner dry).

End of story, I had my wings an hour later (which were great, don't get me wrong). But, what the heck was up with the service? Between the two hostesses seeming annoyed to seat me (why the f it takes two to seat one person to begin with, I don't  know), and then an hour to order one plate of regular wings (and having to put in the leg work myself), I regret my hour long Harold/Kumar-esque journey 

And I wouldn't remember the waitresses name, except when she all of a sudden became attentive after handing me the check. At that point, she made sure to show up three times in the span of minutes. Thanks Franki

Oh!!!! And I forgot!! So the staff actually felt bad and apologized, and gave me an order of fries with my wings. But Franki then came moments later, and said ""you didn't order this,"" and took the wings. Thanks",2Q-voEsSwNbO_Ph0ffyzLQ,1,0,1,3Iy7-7_DQkF-XHTrKmwa7g

When we got into the hotel room we received a knock a few mins later by maintenance to replace a light bulb in the restroom in which we didn't call for so I'm assuming there already was a work order in. Why would you check a guest into a hotel room that has an open work order?!? Shower water temp was horrible. First shower of the day the water fluctuated between ice cold, to scorching hot, to warm and back to cold. There was not a consistent temperature. My daughter took a shower next and there was no hot water even if turning all of the cold off. So she had to take an ice cold shower. I called the operator and they sent maintenance. However, it was a bit of an inconvenience because my family and I couldn't get ready until he was finished fixing the water issue. Later that night around 10 I took a shower and the water was still fluctuating between temps with scorching hot being the main temp it fluctuates to.

When my husband and I went to the casino to play a few slot machines we decided to eat at hooters. We started off with one waitress and then out of nowhere we had a new one that was just horrible. She was more worried about conversating with people than doing her job. While the food came out rather quickly we sat there just looking around for at least 15 mins because we were done eating and wanted the check. When she finally came to our table we asked for the check in which she went to the register I thought to get our check.  But, versus bringing us the check she decided to wait on a few tables while we were still waiting. So we sat for at least another 10 mins. She finally brought us the check and we had to wait another 15 mins before she finally came back to get my payment. But before she did I asked another waitress if she could help and explained how we had been waiting a very long time. At that point she said no sorry. So I asked if she could call our waitress. We sat there and she NEVER called our waitress. I finally had to pull the hostess aside and explained to her what happened and asked if she could please get my waitress. I wish I would have gotten her name because she was VERY helpful. My waitress finally came over and I was able to pay and leave. My waitress name was Tiffany and the worst waitress I've ever come across. If you were at all concerned about customer satisfaction something will be done so this does not happen to future customers.

But it's not a total loss.  For a certain group of people, this hotel & casino would work just fine.  Sadly, ours was not that group.

Book ahead of time to get the best rates.  I paid $160 for three nights over a weekend in September and that included taxes.

Apparently the best rooms are in the Ocean Towers.  I saw a friends room in the other tower and it was even worse than mine.

The rooms are bad but not horrible.  My room didn't have a bedspread but no big deal.  I lived without it.  Internet is via ethernet cable but is slow.  On the 10th floor of the Ocean tower facing west I received 4G on my phone during the evening and 3G during the day so I just tethered to it.

The rooms are very dated, carpets stained, and walls show a little damage with bumps and scrapes.  There's a safe in the room but mine was inoperable.  

The bed sheets were sterile white along with the pillow covers so sleeping in the bed was actually quite fine.

The A/C unit sounds like a broken chain saw but stayed ""on"" the entire time so I used it to drown out noises from the hall and adjacent rooms.  Yes, the walls appear to be paper thin.

Old ""box"" style TV's in the armoire.  Two dozen channels and mine were mostly ""fuzzy"".

Everything is fairly cheap when compared to the other hotels.  The little store by the elevators sells pop, water, chips, beer, etc... It's very reasonable.  They pour mega-strong drinks at the bars and they have $3 and $5 black jack tables on a Saturday night.  It's small and easy to get around in.

The sports book is laughable.

It's a 5 minute walk to the Tropicana, 8 to MGM, 12 to NY NY, and 15 to the Monte Carlo.  

Plug your nose as you reach the sidewalk going to the Tropicana.  The bums have made a home on the NW corner of the Hooters property near the sidewalk and use the small wooded area there to vacate their bowels.  It smells like a Mexican suburb in July.

If you like Hooters in your hometown, you will love this Hooters! This is an old Howard Johnson's hotel from the 70's, but over the years it has been owned and remodeled by several different owners with the latest being Hooters. You may want to get there quickly if you want to visit because the hotel is up for sale, which is unfortunate because it is really cute, fun and inexpensive for a hotel just off the Las Vegas strip. It is decorated in a ""Florida-tropical"" theme with the two hotel towers and a large outdoor pool area with three pools and three hot tubs, as well as a bar. The hotel and rooms are very clean and adequate. There is a tv, but no mini-frig or microwave. I would have given this resort and casino 5 stars had the rooms had a refigerator, microwave and newer flat screen tv's. Being that they filed and emerged from bankruptcy in 2012, I can see why they are being careful and frugal with their hotel. That being said, the location is great. It's right next door to the Tropicana and right across the street from the MGM Grand. A traffic light allows easy crossing to the MGM Grand casino and access to the monorail, so you can get anywhere on the strip from this hotel. There is also city bus service at the Tropicana next door if you want to take buses, which are way cheaper than taxis ot the monorail. They are on-time and come by frequently. A taxi will cost you $10 plus tip to go around the corner to the airport, while the bus in $2. The Hooters restaurant inside the casino has a special (not on the menu) of 3 chicken tacos for $3 and they are really great. They come mild, medium or hot. The only way you know about this special is a sign at the front door of the casino, so you have to ask for it once inside the restaurant.. The rooms are inexpensive compared to other hotels on or near the strip, so it is a great value for a basic, clean room in a great location. There is a Prince review there called Purple Reign, which we did not see, but people we talked to in the casino loved it. It was not showing the nights we were there or we would have gone to see it.

We walked into the lobby and we were not overly impressed, definitely not what we expected from a Vegas hotel. We check in and carry all our luggage in to our room.  Before we even get to our room we noticed an awful smell in the hallway, it reeked of weed. We set everything down and I run in to the bathroom. I notice that around the toilet it is disgusting. While washing my hands I notice there is dirt/filth all over the hairdryer and light switch. As I come out of the bathroom my husband asks me to come look at something on the bed. I did and it was pubic hair. Upon closer inspection of the comforter we found 3 different places where there was pubic hair. We immediately called the front desk and requested a new room. As we sat waiting on someone to bring us keys to the new ""upgraded"" room we noticed what appeared to be pee stains on the carpet in multiple spots around the room. Also, there was a ball of what could have been fecal matter in the corner of the room. I did NOT inspect it any closer than absolutely necessary. It took about an hour before someone showed up to our room with the keys to the ""upgraded"" room. Not once did anyone apologize for the filthy room or the inconvenience of having to switch rooms. (I do want to add that the Valet that eventually brought us our new key was great. He helped us with our luggage and was very nice.) we get to our new room and while it's cleaner it's still not what you would expect from a Vegas hotel but we made due. It was definitely not an ""upgraded"" room. The view was supposed to be of the pool but since the pool is being remodeled (something we were not informed of prior to booking or checking in) the view was of a bunch of dirt and a construction area. Our bed, while comfortable enough, was sagging a substantial amount in the middle. After the hour and a half ordeal of checking in and getting into our room we decided to go downstairs and have a drink. We met a great bartender named Jackie. She is very sweet, very a consisting, and makes hanging out at that bar more enjoyable. We also met the DJ, a fun, spunky girl that is very entertaining. They both turned our mood around. The next day we go to get ice and the ice machine is broken. It was still broken when we checked out 4 days later. We were supposed to get $10 free play and 2 free drinks during our stay, that never happened. The hotel itself is run down and neglected. There are so many easy fixes that could be done to make it a little nicer. The smell outside the hotel is absolutely awful. Think raw sewage on a hot day. It is gross. The upside was the Hooters restaurant served the best wings I've ever had and for the most part the employees were great. Our last complaint was we had housekeeping walk in our room without knocking on 3 separate occasions. All before the 11am checkout time. I called the front desk in our last day to tell them we had been walked in on twice that morning and was offered a late checkout of 2 pm. We took it and went and had lunch before we checked out. When we went to go get the last of our things out of the room our keys were deactivated. We went and found housekeeping and asked to be let into our room so we could grab our things and go. She refused and told us she didn't have a key. Ummmmm, how exactly does housekeeping not have a key? We asked if she could call down to the front desk and she flat out said no that we could just go down ourselves. She was rude and it was uncalled for. Bottom line, it you want a nice hotel, don't come here. If you're on a budget go to motel 6, you'll probably have nicer accommodations there and better customer service.",BlkQu9I-yixzs61K4f6TPA,1,0,1,sXZ_652U0OyA5GuupIURBw

The really bad part of this place is the restaurant. I had very low expectations and the restaurant failed to meet even them. I'm not sure why we decided to eat here, with so many better options. I think it was proximity. Or being too tired to walk farther. Either way eating there was our third mistake. 

First we were seated on rickety stools. And then we were completely ignored by our waitress. It wasn't even busy. It took thirty plus minutes to get a drink.  At least 45 additional minutes to get our food, after a long wait just to place our order. And then when the food did arrive, it was cold. Not just ""not warm"" but cold.

I've always been a fan of hooters wings and curly fries. So, after seeing a show we stopped here to eat. My husband and I both got wings. They were cold. Cold enough that they could have been cooked and put in the fridge. 

This is the only hooters that hasn't been spot on with the wings. 

Service wasn't great either. We got our food and no one came to check on us for 20 minutes and I clearly wasn't eating my food. 

At least the curly fries were good, and warm.

My friend was staying in one of the largest rooms they offer, and it had plenty of space for us to hang out for a while.  There was a mini fridge and small bar area which was nice for drinks, but Hooters definitely feels dated compared to all the other more expensive options in town.

I also ate at the late night cafe restaurant they have here, and it is still one of my only 1 star reviews I've ever written lol.

I would recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap place to crash, but if you are looking for convenience, scenery, posh decor, or anything besides somewhere to sleep, you may leave disappointed.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,3,0,3,pxiAIQIXcB6U3Pc4nsLpiA

First of all i reserved a room with double beds which was unavailable (isn't that what reserve means?) so being that they didn't have my requested room available they put me in a room with one bed and had the nerve to say it was 10 extra dollars!!! Wth?? because supposedly it was strip view which that was an understatement then they asked for a $50 deposit the keys kept not working making it where i had to keep going down to the front desk then when we checked out on the 11th they deducted $8.67 from my $50 deposit stating that it was for their amenities (pool, phones, etc.) which i never took advantage of so now that i know that they are full of it NEVER AGAIN!",XpG-pUbJc9r0uzA8qta81Q,0,0,1,ZWMPOSQmfd-RxKO1b2e0UQ

The poker room has three tables. I don't mean, three games running usually, I mean, three tables total. They are, however, in the process of expanding the room, so that's good. They do have a daily tournament for $25, with a $10 ad-on, and a $5 rebuy. Unlimited rebuys in the first hour. It's just so darn hard to beat. I got close a couple times. The last time, I got knocked out on the bubble. I pushed all in with A/K, got called with A/J (nice call there, buddy) and the guy makes QUAD JACKS. At the end, the dealer says to him, ""Geeze, anything else I can do for you?""  ,': )

The food is, well, Hooters grub. They do have fried dill pickle chips, though, which I absolutely love.

The room we stayed in was much nicer than I'd expected. The beds are only full-sized, but incredibly comfortable. And the service was excellent -- I called down for more soap and shampoo one morning, and it was at my door before I hung up the phone. (That's an exaggeration, but it was pretty darn fast.)

What truly amazes me, though, is they have the Hooters poster girls working the table games. You can actually sit at Ms. Hooters International's table and have her deal to you. Reckon they gotta find some way to keep them busy in between photo shoots.

The staff is always very friendly, and the pool area is really cool. Couple pools, couple hot tubs, a few sand pits, and two fire pits with seats arranged around them. I'll have to check it out now that it's warm enough to sit outside without the necessity of hot chocolate (or a hot Toddy).",9zoQR_pQ5SgIixQFyhBDhQ,2,0,3,xg8YAjIc7Jil80h0w9tB7w

5183399,2011-09-25,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"This past weekend, spent 4 days in Vegas. The trip was great, outside the hotel. We originally booked the hotel through Hotwire.com over 2 months before the trip, so didn't know which hotel we were committing to, but it showed as 3 star hotel, on the strip, with 3.5 stars on TripAdvisor, so we booked it. Was going on a golf trip with 2 other guys, so Hooters was fine when we found out. 

Problem started at checkin. They didn't have our reservation, and said Hotwire didn't fax it. The girl at the front desk said, nothing they could do, ""next time book directly through us"". Seriously? I ask if they can call Hotwire for me - 'can't do that'. I was surprised at the attitude and inhospitality. I asked to speak with the manager - she wasn't available to talk to us. I ask if they can at least get us in a room, I'll give them my credit card number - I have confirmation number, reservation number, everything Hotwire sent me to confirm I went through and paid for this room already. 

While at the desk, I called Hotwire, where I was on hold for over 20 minutes. When someone finally came on, they transferred me and refaxed (they said their records showed originally faxed in June). They couldn't stay on the line with me, so waited (all the while, I'm waiting at the registration desk). I waited for another 10 minutes, it never came through, so had to call Hotwire again (again Hooters tells me, nothing they can do, I need to call them, and ask them to fax it again). They said they didn't even have Hotwire's phone number. While on hold, ask to speak to the manager again, this time she was available, this is where things started to really fall apart. She essentially said ""that's what I get for booking through a 3rd party"", I didn't even know how to respond to that. She said nothing they could do. When I finally got Hotwire on again, they again refaxed (I can't believe they're doing all this via fax). This time the Hotwire person stays on the line with me. Another 10 minutes later, Hooters finally gets it. 

Just to upset us more (it seemed), the counter person checks in the next group in line instead of us.

All in all, I get into the hotel room over 2 hours after we got to the Hooters. No apologies, just a bad attitude. I would have been fine if they were polite about the whole matter, I understand things go wrong with technology. But to blame me for making reservations not directly through them, to be rude (not just from staff, but from the manager), unbelievable.

For example, the lady who got bitten by a bug and all of a sudden thats the hotels fault because she was on thier property at the time. But how do we, or anyone, know that you didnt get bit outside of the hotel? And  if you did in fact get bitten at the hotel, is it thier fault that our world has a large population of insects? You cant possibly think anyone is capable of keep ALL bugs out!
That review as well as others are unfair. She was probably looking for a refund and didnt get it so shes having a tantrum on yelp. 

 I stayed this week in room 453 and checked out on the 21st. We had a great time! We ordered room service 3 times. The wings were great and breakfast was delicious. Large servings. We were stuffed. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. The staff was very friendly. I called the hotel multiple times for random questions and they never got annoyed. The pool area was very relaxing. It was cold out side by the time i got there so i didnt go in the pool. But laying by the pool was nice. We recieved 2 free drink tickets at check in so we used those. Of course you cant use them on more expensive drinks. But you can get like a jack and coke or a beer. The casino was small located in the lobby. Its nice that its small so its not too over whelming when youre trying to get to your room. 

This hotel is right off the strip so its easy to get around. Theres no fridge or microwave but we brought a cooler to keep our drinks cold so no biggie. 

A few side notes :
DO NOT go to fremont st! The pictures look cool but its VERY dirty and full of all kinds of people you really dont want to be around! We were told it was nice so we went, its 15 minutes away from the strip and again VERY VERY dirty. The street is layered with trash and dirt. Everything looks abandoned. The casinos there reek! Its all bad.

Leave the room clean housekeeperswork hard, dont make it worse. Also, dont ask for room service everyday  dont act like a princess and demand your sheets changed everyday. Yall know you dont do that at home so stop being high maintenance. Its really annoying. 

Last thing, yes the hotel charges a desposit of $100 on a card and resort fees per night because ITS LAS VEGAS! PLEASE READ READ READ EVERYTHING BEFORE BOOKING!!! i dont care what anyone says, i booked with expedia and EVERYTHING is laid out for you! Its youre fault for not reading. 

If youre gonna uber around, use uberx NOT uber pool. If you do the pool, the driver will constantly have tostop and pick up new cutomers. Its not his fault, we picked uber pool to save a couple bucks. Not worth it. Just do uber x so you get towhere you wanna go.

5205540,2011-08-13,9,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"My group was drawn to the $20 a night special like, well, like thrifty Asians to a good deal I guess.  Seriously, $20 for a night plus 20 free wings, buy-one-get-one-free steak dinner for $10, and 2 free drinks at the pool bar were too good of a bargain.  My grandparents in Hong Kong would have crossed the Pacific Ocean for a Vegas deal that good.  A discount so prime that it almost masks the decrepit halls of this tacky establishment, home of daytime escorts and resting ground for strippers that just couldn't cut it.  If you came to the casino floor for pretty girls, prepare to be gravely disappointed at the selection of just grotesque herd animals you've ever seen.  They keep the prime stock in the Hooters Restaurant.

But seriously Hooters Girls, some of you are hot, but don't give my group fucking attitude while we order and act like you have so many important places to be in your empty restaurant.  Your unresolved issues of Daddy touching you inappropriately and that oh-so-interesting theory that hardcore porn is the ""gateway to Hollywood"", while amusing, should be checked at the door.  Although the blonde at the bar was especially nice to me and the gf.  You are an gentle-lady and a scholar.

The $3 Blackjack tables that they advertise like the saggy boobs of their older staff actually consist of ONE, yes ONE, table that is always full.  Comped drinks come at an excruciatingly slow pace since the table limits are so low they need to make money somehow, amiright?

The $.99 wings they advertise are also only available to hotel guests and only with the purchase of a drink.  Although you see $1.50 bud lights being hawked on the floor, the price increases in restaurants like Mad Onion where the wing deal is offered.

Overall, the rooms were okay.  Not the worst that I've stayed in Vegas.  Twas fairly roomy and felt like a retired grandpa from Florida decorated everything with a tropical theme: a grandpa with debilitating Alzheimer's.  The beds were kind of musty, but sheets and room were cleaned daily.  Bathroom was kind of small and old, but what do you expect for $20.  It's a pretty alright place for being right next to the strip.

1. Imelda refunded 2 days of resort fees. 
2. Older male security guard was nice as hell. 


As you can see the cons out weigh the pros. Yes, there are more expensive hotels, but I expect decent plumbing, a comfy bed plus to be treated like a person and not just a dollar sign.

5211701,2015-11-02,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I read several reviews and some were not that great but I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Here is what I liked.  The room was clean as were the hallways and elevators. The people at the check in desk, Player Relations , Player Rewards desk,cocktail servers and bartenders were really good and very friendly. I never was a huge fan of Hooters' food but there were options like 24/7 breakfast at the tavern and that was good as well. I absolutely love the location. Hooters is within walking distance from several casinos like MGM, Tropicana , The Luxor and Excalibur . The monorail is right across the street at MGM and that was really convenient as well. Security was visible at all times but not intrusive or rude. There were a few things I wasn't thrilled with. Like most casinos check-in is mid to late afternoon and if you want to check-in early there is a fee. If the room is available don't nickle and dime your guests just let them check in early because they will probably spend that money at the slots or tables anyway. The cocktail service on the slot side is almost non-existent during the day. That is probably more of a scheduling issue with management more than the severs not working that area. From what I understand Holiday Inn will , at some point , take over the hotel but leave the Hooters restaurant. I look forward to going back next year .",YV_klD-okNHZ8PuNbBdMvg,0,0,4,Ur6qO1nbQbJzTyL9z_LGFg

The staff was rude & the girl that checked us in audibly call my friend & me ""whores"" when we walked away. We were not inappropriately dresses in any way & if we were, the staff should've reserved their judgments. We should have turned around the moment we pulled up & saw a small colony of transients in their parking lot, but the room was non-refundable.

   My friend & I were too scared to walk ANYWHERE near that hotel & ended up having to take taxis everywhere bc we were consistently hassled every time we stepped foot out of the room. One of I taxi drivers was genuinely concerned about dropping us off at 'that sh*thole'.

We opted to stay here instead of a hotel on the strip because it is the cheapest place during the weekend, but it is not worth it. The entire place is dirty, outdated, and run down. Our floor had a water leak and the floor was sopping wet which caused the entire level to reek like cat urine. The constant lingering smell of weed in the elevators was a classy touch as well.

I don't think this hotel has been updated since the early 90's; still a huge box tv, outdated decor, dirty showers and floors. The shower was so incredibly frustrating I almost just gave up on showering...it literally took 5 minutes to get the temperature to a degree that didn't cause me to have third degree burns; if you moved the switch even the slightest amount, scolding hot water. There was also this thick red fluid on the shower curtain that has obviously been overlooked by housekeeping. 

Even though our room was disgusting, the thing that made this experience the worst was the HORRIBLE customer service. Our hostess for the Hooters restaurant was one of the rudest i've encountered in a while. We were waiting in line and a group of men proceeded to cut in front of us; the hostess seated them and came back to tell us it was going to be 'a long' wait because all the seats were occupied....this is after she allowed them to cut in front of us. When we confronted her, her response was simply ""whatever"". We ended up getting a $50 voucher because of her rudeness, but that hardly mattered because the treatment we got from the Saloon staff was just as bad. They knew we had a free meal voucher so apparently this meant we weren't worthy of even having our waters refilled once nor did we deserve to be asked one time if we needed anything. Terrible service. 

This place is so cheap that all those posters that advertise a ""free"" 6-pack of pepsi after earning so many player points are complete lies; we had a ton of points and saved them up to get our free 6pack once we checked out but the customer service agent said those points were invalid and that only points that were earned in one day were able to be used. Hmmm. After being treated horribly and spending hundreds of dollars in your casino, you can't give us a free six pack of pepsi that cost no more than $4.00?! What a joke of an establishment. How is this even allowed to be in business? Every worker I encountered here was miserable.

My total price just to book the stay was over $500 not including the $78 I had to pay once I checked in for ""resort fees"". There was also a surprise $100 deposit that was spring up on me when I checked in. Now granted I would get that deposit back once I checked out, that's still quite an expensive surprise when your on limited vacation budget. 
Now on to the rooms. So unfortunately I only read the reviews after I booked the room. Yes, the hotel bragged about ""newly remodeled rooms"" even on the outside signage. There are three things a hotel should be on point with: comfort, cleanliness, customer service. First the comfort of the bed was fine no real complaints there. The a/c was weary. Though it worked it was unbelievably loud and sounded like it was going to break at any moment. The unit was old and I mean it had to have been at least 20+ years old I am serious. If your going to claim newly remodeled rooms make sure your appliances are up to date. Second, the cleanliness was lacking in the bathroom. The tub was stained and shower head needing a deep calcium/lime removal. The caulking was shoddy and the plumbing always sounded as though it was straining after usage. Third the hotel pushed its menu for in room service pretty hard as well. You would think being known for food and having a hotel/casino in a city that is known for all night fun there would be room service 24 hours but no. The hours for room service was from 6am-11:00pm. Now I attempted 3 times to order breakfast after 7:30am and received no answer from room service. Which makes it worse when there is no coffee pot or refrigerator in the room either.

First off, they recently renovated their rooms and are currently renovating the casino floor.

The casino is really small with a few table games and a few slots.  

The rooms are very bare.  There is no cool art on the wall and there is plenty of empty space.  The bathroom is not like a hotel bathroom, but rather like an apartment building.  Seriously.  On the toilet, you have to hold the flush down for a few seconds so the water actually goes down.  This is something I'd expect from a Motel 6 in a random town. But I guess Hooters goes in that category as well.  Also, outside stuck to the door was a flyer for pizza.  Yeah, seriously.  It must be an apartment building.  I don't know why the hotel stopped using the hotel key card to access the rooms when getting on the elevator.  It would provide some security to guests and prevents unwanted people from entering the room floors.

I was immediately appalled by the fee of 148-158 dollars. So, I asked what this ""convenience fee"" was and it was for the smallest bottles of water in our room and valet parking. Really Hooters? What a JOKE. I ended up paying it and went on with my Vacation.

Secondly, They only had one elevator working the entire weekend of edc! I seriously waited 25 mins just to go up and another 15 mins to head back down when needed. After speaking with one of the Employees there they said, We going to repair the elevator and that there are no stairs to our rooms. Which I think is BS. What if there's a fire? We just all going to wait patiently for the elevator as were burning to a crisp? 

Last but not least there Valet sucked! There were times where I waited outside for Valet to come get my keys for 30 mins. One time they also brought out the wrong car to me. Seriously?

They had several open tables, but not enough coordinated staff to sit us.

5364513,2015-01-07,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"My family and I took a vacation from. 12/29-1/3 and it was the worse hotel experience we've ever had. We called soon as we landed to see if our rooms were ready and they said it was. We get there and 1 room isn't ready(we had reserved 3 rooms) so we wait. No one at the front desk is friendly, no smIles. It's like you're bothering them. We get up to our rooms and room#833 which my son and family was given was horrible! The door didn' close good,it looked like someone tried to kick it in,the closet door was off  track, the sliding door didn't lock. They drilled a screw into the medal piece to keep it from opening, but the problem w/ that is you can screw off the screw. So I had my son w/his wife and 2 children (5/6) move to my room #849. Then we discovered that the TV remote didn't work. The shower wouldn't drain and even the bathroom sink. My daughters room #831 had the same problem as #833 w/ the shower and sink. When we booked our rooms online, we thought we were getting flat screen tvs.Well guess again,these were old TV. 

So I complain about my room (833). According to the Asst Manager she would compensate me for it and send maintenence to the room. Maintenance came to room, looked at the door and said he couldn't touch it and had to call security.  And as far as the sliding glass window, he said ""Oh, your grandchildren would have to be tiny to fit though this!"" I asked him,isn't this a safety issue and he responded by saying he will call security. Then security comes up and asked us how long as the door been like this? I responded by telling him that we checked in last night. They acted like we kicked in the door. According to security, no report had been made prior to our call. I told him that I know for a fact that when a room is checked out, you have to make a full report of that  room. Of course security did't say anything. We decided to go downstairs to check out the slots and when we returned we couldn't get into our room. It wasn't the key card, the actual door was jammed. We called downstairs and complained. My husband and I literally sat on the floor waiting for the Asst. Manager to come. When she came she was very apologetic that I thought she actually cared. There was no available rooms at that moment . I did get to move to a better decent room later which the supervisor said just came available. That same night, we hear hammering so I open the door and they are fixing the door to room#833 and the next morning we notice a do not disturb sign on the door.

Well, we weren't comp for the issues w/ our rooms or the inconvenience. The asst manager said we would be, but didn't. Never again will we stay a HOOTERS! And I will tell family and friends.....that they'really better off going to Motel 6.

I had a cheddar bacon burger, pina colada, buttercup pie and potato salad.  The only good thing was the potato salad. The burger was bad....lots of bbq sauce but no actual flavor. Hooters girls need a major reality check, just cuz u are wearing really short shorts and a tight top with a push up bra doesnt automatically make you hot or give you a perfect body especially not with all the flat asses walking around.  All the girls were wearing drag queen make up and most had false eye lashes.  Some of the guy cooks were actually hotter than the female waitresses, lol!  The pina colada was severly watered down.

Honestly, I don't know why people are hating on this place so badly! The Casino is on the smaller side and a little older but it is clean and staffed by super friendly people who are more than happy to assist you with anything you might need. For an extra $10 a night I upgraded to an Ocean View room overlooking New York, New York and the Luxor. Not awesome during the day but gorgeous at night. As you can see by the photos, the room was light and spacious, very clean and the decor was super cute! The bathroom was a little on the older side and not great lighting for makeup but that's going to happen in an older hotel. Bed was comfortable and sheets were clean.

I don't gamble but I did head to the bar next to the pool for some drinks and the bartender was awesome! She made us some really strong Scooby Snacks and some tasty Moscow Mules. The bill evened out to $104, split down the middle to $52 each which wasn't too bad. My friend and I sat by the pool and played giant Jenga which I thought was a really cute touch and definitely would love to come back and swim during one of the day time pool parties.

I really liked Hooters, it was basic but clean and friendly. The free parking and Uber pickup from front door was definitely the icing on the cake!",r0PIAIRRsaxpF7z9SRCT1g,8,4,3,TksvO3EH_9g6KGy4ToFn9Q

Once it was confirmed we walked up to the desk to check in. But they told us that it will take a few minutes for groupon info to be transferred to their system. So after a few minutes we tried again. Then they told us that we need to wait for 30mins. Then 45 mins...which turning into a whooping 1hr 20mins.We sat on the ground because of the lack of wait seating. 

The service was awful. Right from the start the employee gave the ""well that's too bad"" attitude. It was clear she wasn't so pleased with her job and was not afraid to show it out on to the customers. When I expressed my frustration of waiting for so long the employee look at each other and have the shoulder struggle of ""okay so what?"" & ""It's none of my concern"" look. By the end of the exchange, she even started raise her voice.

Who gave these women jobs in hospitality? And how are they able to keep it? They obviously have absolute no idea what hospitality is...The employee even gave speeches of how grateful we should be that she is willing to deal with us. 

Finally after a 1hr and 20 mins, the system was up. They try to charge us with early check-in fee and hotel resort fee. If you make a customer wait a 1hr and 20 mins at least to take off the resort fee or early check in fee! 

Overall, no matter how affordable this hotel is the trouble & rudeness that comes along with it is not worth it.

BUT there is a common ""customer service"" factor that should exist within every hotel be it a cheap or expensive one.   My friend and I were there for a 3-day music festival, so we were rarely in our hotel room, which gave housekeeping plenty of time every day to come into our rooms to tidy up. This only happened once and on the day before we were checking out.  The bell man who helped us to our room with all of our luggage was extremely smug and you could tell that he hated his life. Sorry dude... get a different job, don't bring me into your dislike for what you do, I didn't force you to work here.  We ordered room service a couple times.  One of the times an extremely snotty girl named Marian was more than awful to my friend and I, not only did she get the order wrong, but when we called to get it fixed she argued with us and told us that they took pictures of every order leaving the kitchen... if that was the case she would be able to see that it was wrong, but proceeded to argue before finally sending someone up with the 2 items that we needed to make it right.  Another time we were walking up to the host stand to get a menu to take to our room and the girls at the front kept saying how drunk they were and were giggling too much to pay attention to us standing in front of them.  

On the plus side, the A/C works really well, the blackout curtains are a gem, and the water pressure in the shower was really on point.   We did have an older bell man that helped us take our luggage TO our car when we were leaving and that man was super helpful and friendly.  He even helped us with directions on how to get out of Vegas from where we were.

I booked 2 rooms without any problems and couldn't get over how cheap 2 rooms for 3 nights was!

With that being said, we were fully prepared for a cheap hotel experience and weren't expecting anything like Caesars or The Venetian. We were pleasantly surprised at how ""nice"" the place was. If you need a comparison, think of a Days Inn or Comfort Inn. The main lobby has all the gambling and blackjack tables as low as $3.

Checking in was quick and staff was courteous. In line just Ahead of me was a young woman who looked like the what-happens-in-Vegas-stays-in-Vegas girl. The woman for the evening or two. The dude paying clearly was the employer.

Housekeeping was very pleasant. We will tip her.

Ankle deep water standing in the tub as you shower and no grab bars for safety. I used flip-flops because it didn't look   but maybe it was as clean as it should have been. Remodeling or replace the tub's plastic unit but please repair the drainage problem.

The atmosphere was upbeat and relaxing at the same time.  Our waitress was nice and took good care of us, always checking if we needed anything else.  They seemed to be very busy while we were there and we enjoyed ourselves so we decided to come back and eat the next time.  

When we went back to eat it was for lunch and it had just opened so it wasn't that busy.  We both enjoyed our meal, I got the Chicken strip and cheese sandwich and my husband got the Fish Sandwich.  They were both on sourdough buns and soooo good.   We had a very nice waitress that was expecting and  I thought it was neat that instead of the normal uniform warn she was wearing a t-shirt that says ""Baby on Board"" !!

As always we saw quite a few families enjoying themselves and the one family got their children's picture taken with the waitress and the children were smiling from ear to ear.

Just landed from coming in from Hawaii for EDC2011. some of our friends wanted to go out that night but I was dead tired and didn't want to go anywhere except to eat and sleep.

I asked my sister who lived there for many years and suggested a place on where to eat. She said go eat At Terrible's Cake in the hotel with the same Name.. Its cheap & no frills food. The people I was with didn't like the idea of a restaurant named Terrible's so they suggested Hooters.

I was like okay that's fine, since you cant really mess it up right?

We get there and we have to sign up for some Hooters Card thingy to get the discounted chicken wings. I'm like okay cool. Then after about 20 minutes later, we are signed up and seated.

I just wanted some wings and a side to suppress this stomach cramps i have been having because of nothing to eat. The wing special they have is for some really cheap amount, i forgot how much it was, like 10 cents or 20 cent wings?

But here is the catch, you need to buy a Soda, and a minimum purchase of wings. The wording was really complicated but we had to ask the waiter and she explained it to us.

I get wings and some onion rings and a Diet coke. It comes out fairly quickly. I was hella hungry so didn't even bother to assets what i was eating. I just went chowing down.

After eating all the minimum order of the wings. We leave the restaurant. But then a little bit after, about 20 minutes or so after eating, my start to get stomach cramps again and had to use the restroom at our hotel.

Seems like I got food poisoning from the Chicken. When I think back about it. the chicken was really cold like it was sitting out side for a while already. I asked my sister about it who also works in the food service industry and she also said she got food poisoning from there.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll pass on Hooters. there is so many better places to eat.

I'd dropped by the $3 blackjack table on my last two trips to Vegas and had a good time.  I decided to try taking advantage of their winter deal when I knew I'd be back here.  When I read some of the reviews below, i was nervous but went forward with it.  I'm so glad I did.

Check in was quick, I received my deal benefits easily.  I love how small the place is.  I don't have to walk two miles to get from my room to the front desk, a restaurant, and casino games.

Everyone that I have encountered on staff has been very helpful and gracious.   It's a bit cold for the pool, but it looks like it's fun in the summer.

One of my favorite things to do in Vegas is spend a couple hours in the morning playing $3 blackjack at Hooters.  if I came in before noon, I've never had a problem finding a seat and normally am up a few bucks when I walk away.  The game staff has been great, helpful, and kind (this morning Bill and Fangsu were great.. the floor manager Joe was also a treat).

Last time I stayed in Vegas, I was at the Mirage.  Fancy place, but I felt that my room and bathroom were way smaller than the one I'm in right now.

Compared to RESORTS, this hotel is probably a three star, but according to Yelp, four stars is ""Yay!  I'm a fan!"" which is definitely true and five means it's as good as it gets.  For this price, it is as good as it gets and all of the staff that I have encountered has been great. I'll be back and suggest it to friends. It's a good hotel to hang out, play a little, and check out Vegas.  It's right off the strip and my room had a great view of Luxor, Excalibur, New York, and MGM.

So expectations weren't too high for the hotel being it was Vegas and reading the reviews before we booked the room. Sometimes I think maybe that one customer just had a bad experience and it won't happen to me too but just in case we decided we would take sanitizing wipes. We booked the room 3 months in advance and kinda forgot about the reviews until we got to the hotel. We got here at 2pm and check in wasn't til 4pm. We asked if we could check in early. They told us it was a $20 fee to check in early which we didn't mind because the weather outside was 108° and I just want to go back out just yet. We got asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for a better view and it would be $10 a night (for 2 days it would be $20 more). The receptionist saw I hesitated and she said if we upgraded she would override our early check in fee. So we went ahead and got the ""ocean view"" and got a view of the pool. We got to our room and immediately cleaned the bathroom with our wipes. The bathtub had rust, the toilet had weird streaks and the bathroom floor had bits of false eyelashes scattered everywhere. Besides knowing the room wasn't 100% clean our stay wasn't too bad. The mattress felt on the newer side and was very comfortable. There are 5 elevators that go to the rooms and 2 were down during our stay, I personally didn't mind walking or waiting for an elevator but for some, it would be an inconvenience. The water temp in the shower would fluctuate too much for my liking and I would have to spend too much time playing with the handles. The vent in the bathroom connected the the room next to us and you could slightly see into the other bathroom. So if your dropping a load you can be sure the other room can hear it. My husband was in the bathroom and he could hear someone peeing in the other room. We booked this room for the price point and we pretty much got what we paid for, good thing our expectations weren't too high. The casino has $2 shots and $3 beers so that's a deal. I think next time we'll pay that extra $30 a night to get an actual clean room and a hotel with full functioning elevators.

I'm ashamed to say that I actually walked into a Hooters.  What is funny is I was here to see Todd Paul's show (completely underrated and the best value on Vegas right now), and I was hungry and had no time to go across to MGM and find something better.  Hooters, was really the only choice to go except for the Mad Onion, which had horrible reviews so I was scared to go there.  So here I was, embarrassed to be waiting in line to try supposedly good wings.

I ordered 10 wings hot, but weren't in the slightest bit hot and were breaded, a big no no with me.  I didn't find out until after that I could have gotten them without the breading, but oh well.  They weren't that good.  The chicken itself was moist and would have been great if it had been naked and with an actual hot sauce.  They charge you extra for blue cheese which is in a small prepackaged container (99 cents), and for celery (79 cents).  However, the most pleasant aspect of this meal was the celery as it was the freshest, most delicious, and huge portion of celery I have had served with wings.  I loved the celery so much I had them take away the wings and I devoured the entire plate of that good crunchy healthy celery.

Also had the curly fries which were good.  I don't normally eat curly fries because they have seasoned salt on them but I liked these.  Husband had a grilled hot dog that didn't seem grilled and cheese sticks that he said were decent.  

Would we go here again?  Doubtful, but we will be back in the casino to see Todd Paul.  I was utterly floored when next to us there was a table with a woman who was celebrating her birthday with her husband there and two friends.  I'm guessing it was the husband's idea to go there.

Walking to my room there was this smell emanating from one of the restaurants. I'm not one to really go over the top about bad smells, but this was really really bad. I literally gagged and had to cover my mouth. It was like a mix of vomit and old wing sauce. It lasted all weekend too, so it didn't seem like a temporary problem.

However, when my flight got cancelled and I was not sure what to do when I had to stay the night, this place was cheap and affordable! Though it is an older hotel and it is noticeable it is clean. The food downstairs is still great wings like hooters always has! In addition, tables are cheaper (which is nice) than the other spots. It is not on the strip though around the corner from the strip. And being across from the MGM and next to Tropicana you can just walk through them to get to the strip too. 

The hotel is also quiet compared to most others including others that are off the strip.  It also has free wi-fi. The customer service is ok, some are beyond nice, such as setting up a players card, in the restaurant but the hotel management is not always the best. But in that sense you are still getting a deal with what you pay for. 

Defiantly would stay again not the first place but if I had to stay cheaply or got screwed  again by the airlines I know I could get a room, quickly too, and it would be clean and a good place to sleep as well as continue to gamble and be close to the action.",rB-oL2Q97ni15YsEfnlSkg,0,0,3,QawpqG13OyJTxHye5_YwDA

So I decided to just walk up to the bar to get my own drink where I was met, eventually, by an ill-tempered gal who did nothing more than raise her eyebrows when I asked for a beverage.

Where else in Vegas can you go swimming at 3 AM, get Hooters wings delivered to your door for a few bucks, and then make your own coffee when you wake up? 

It's not the Palazzo or the Bellagio, and for the prices I wasn't expecting anything grand. If you are, it's time to wake up and smell the freshly brewed coffee from your in-room Keurig. 

The Mad Onion is ok for the money, Hooters food is always good (except for the long lines every night), and the bars are average. 

The service can be horrible. A bartender ignored me for 20 minutes because he was busy hitting on one of the girls across the bar, bellhops can take an hour or two, and the valet wouldn't even open the girlfriend's car door (it's easier and faster to park your own car anyway). 

On the other hand, another bartender went above and beyond in making us happy with our drinks, the front desk clerks were almost always polite, and the dealers managed to put up with my neophyte gambling skills without screaming.

I had ordered wings from the waitress as well. And when I asked the security guard, Michael, if I could leave my wings and my jumper on my seat while I go get a margarita because I did not want the wings to be thrown away. 

I went to the $1 margarita bar and bought back two margaritas and a water. The security guard parked where the room entrances near the pool was told me not to spill them because it was apparent the three cups I was carrying was a hard task for my small hands. He did not mention this policy to me, both times I had exchanged eye contact with him in the two hours since. 

I came back to my seat and was putting my drinks down and putting my towel up on my seat and that's when the same security guard, a new security guard, the cocktail waitress who had served me, (who I regrettably tipped 20%) all swarmed up on me and told me that I can't bring those drinks in here and that they were sorry they did not ""catch that"" earlier. They said I would have to speak to the bar manager, which I did. I however had a purse, three drinks, and a to go container of wings with me that I could not carry on my own. One of the security guards refused to help me with carrying my belongings to the pool bar, which is where I would have to speak to the bar manager. 

I spoke to Matt the bar manager at 5:30 and explained to him that I'd been there for two hours already and brought a $1 margarita and a water into the pool area already. He poured both of them into one cup and let me go back out there to watch the game. Why was it SO hard for them to just remind me of the policy when I was out there and just let it go this time? I've spent over $25 on wings and drinks including tipping the bartenders and the cocktail waitress 20%.

The other visit was with Arkady G. this past weekend when he came to visit. This is going to be a review combining elments I experienced during both visits.

Ok, so the parking garage is really yucky. The elevators are janky as hell. My boss said ""Oh, I thought we were in the Wynn"" when we stepped inside. Yeah, they're the most filthy ghetto elevators ever. 

One thing I really like about this casino is that it's very small. It feels fun and intimate at the same time, and it's not freaking loud at all. LOVE. I hate hearing the electronic poker slots clanging and I didn't notice either time at this place.

The pool is ok, but the surrounding area is kinda busted (aka the bar area) I like that you can lounge out and nobody checks to see if you're even staying there when you walk out to the pool (which could be a bad thing.)

The bathrooms here are decent, not totally nasty. I wish the doors were push doors instead of having to touch door handles from the bathrooms. Bleh, oh well, I use a paper towel to open it, whatevs. 

So Arkady went to play black jack. Me being the overly frugal person, I demanded he give me half his chips when he sat down because he already lost $80 at the craps table at the Paris earlier that day. I got to sit at the table, even though I wasn't playing, and I got free drinks (I'm not a beeotch, I only asked for water) and he ended up making $125 in about 15 minutes while we were waiting for our table at The Mad Onion. Not bad at all. The dealer, who was an older white woman was really nice and friendly, in a mom sort of way.

Club is over and hangover is coming?

Go ahead and visit The Hooters Casino Hotel!

The Hooters Casino is literally a giant hooters restaurant with hotel rooms upstairs.  From 2am-6am Hooters is the most affordable thing to do in Vegas.  Although this isn't the best hotel or best Hooters for that matter, it is an alternative when there is simply nothing left to do and you have that last lonely $20 in your pocket. 

$3 BlackJack and .25 Cent Day Old Wings!

Maybe I am used to staying at like Mandalay where when you walk in, the check in desk is like 2 feet from the poker tables but thats okay. So we waited FOREVER to get helped just to check in, then we get to our floor we were staying on and as we walked down the hall there was a awful smell. As the weekend went on the smell slowly lingered through the whole hallway, i was convinced there was a dead body in the room next to us or something it was that bad. They knew it too because they put a big fan in the hallway like that would resolve the issue? Our keys kept deactivating as for our friends staying too so we constantly had to go back downstairs for the to reactivate it so we could get into our rooms (waiting forever to get helped each time) and our bathroom was gross, our view was of the backstreet and the ""break"" area of the workers so we could watch them smoke, lucky us! When we were getting onto the elevator a cockroach went running across the floor! Some workers were walking by and I said, umm, theres a cockroach!! and they laughed and said, Im not getting it! and kept walking. They were VERY concerned. The pool was nice, small, but nice!

There were stains in so many random places throughout the rooms and hair in the bathroom. Our rooms did not look vacuumed and the bathroom was not wiped down.  We were so disgusted. We also requested a refrigerator but they charge $25 a day for a refrigerator in your room. We also called for more towels one morning because we used one of the towels to wipe down our bathroom head to toe and they never came. I guess they figured they would just do it anyway later during the day. Whatever the reason, we had to use our personal beach towels so that sucked. I will post photos later. My girlfriends complained to the front desk when we left and they got their resort fee comped so that was nice. The pool looked nice but we rented a cabana next door at the Tropicana which was much better and where I wanted to stay at to begin with but the Tropicana rates went up and down so we should've booked asap. Lesson learned. Another thing that we were not happy about at Hooters was that they were working on the parking garage so our vehicle had to be out by 11 am. One of the nights when we came back  to the hotel the parking lot was packed full. Our driver decided to park our vehicle down the street instead. Honestly, I felt pretty bad for the valet workers. One of them mentioned where the Hooters employees had to park and I felt sorry for them. I thought that by staying at that hotel we would at least get coupons to use for their restaurant in the hotel but we got none of that. Overall it was a very disappointing stay and we will not be staying there again. We are paying the money for a better hotel next time no matter what kind of deals Hooters offers with everyone's flight packages. Don't stay here.

The hotel is nothing like the pics you will see on their web site, I'm sure they are photo shopped to hide the dirt and add in furniture that you wont find. The pool pics might be from when the hotel opened about 15 yrs ago, the pool is a disappointment. 
Just two stars. The hotel is old and dated. A frig was an extra $25 buck a night, so that puts you in a much better hotel for $25 buck more. What is up with the stupid resort fees? where was the resort? another location?.

noun
noun: maintenance
1. the process of maintaining or preserving someone or something, or the state of being maintained.

The staff are polite and when they knew, helpful. Too many staff did not know answers to how the club cards work, how to play points, or cash in on comps. 
The pool area is 24/7. STOP THAT! Clean it UP!
Now food was good, for the type of food, bar food. 
Their $10.99 Prime Rib was very good.

These ex-prom queens with nothing else going for them until they fall apart at 35 don't make up for a place that has crappy beer, crappy service, and crappy wings.

5712634,2017-06-29,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I recently had my first trip to Las Vegas with my BFF, who booked us a room through Hooters at the strong recommendation of a coworker. We did book a flight/hotel packaged through a third party site, so I'm not entirely sure what the prices are if you purchase through Hooter's directly. I was initially reserved to stay here, not knowing what to expect. Overall, I had good things to say: this hotel recently went through a remodel, and while nowhere near as opulent as some of the more well known hotels such as The Bellagio or the Cosmopolitan, it was nice to have a bit of a sensory break. The rooms themselves reminded me very much of a Motel 6- you aren't going to get some of the higher end hotel amenities, but I personally found this to be a bit refreshing after the visual onslaught of the strip. If you're trying to do Vegas on a budget/want to let your senses take a break, I would recommend this place. 


The pro's:
*Hotel staff, from front counter staff to housekeeping to bartenders, were friendly and efficient without being overbearing. 
*Free WiFi: while initially spotty the first day, it was overall fast and reliable. It was a little slower in mornings, probably when more people were using it. 
*Conveniently across the street from MGM Grand and not super far off the Strip. 
*Yes, they have a Hooter's restaurant; on site, and it is open 24/7; the restaurant was open 24/7, but you could even get it roomserviced up to your room till 11PM if your hangover was that bad. . 


The con's/could be improved:
*The deadbolt lock on our door wouldn't actually lock when we were in our room- when we would open the door and try it, the deadbolt would work no problem, but it wouldn't actually go into the frame of the door. 
*Shower water temp was weird- the temperature of the water would fluctuate during a shower, I would get hot, cold, and then mostly tepid before the water would again fluctuate. That was weird. 
*AC unit in room was a bit noisy and the room didn't get quite as iceberg cold as I'd have liked, though this particular bit is me nitpicking more than anything else.",9xwQiocYclFSzLfunNoAxg,6,0,3,SmH1fy1P6fdmf1qi-ki_8A

Once you walk in you can feel the sadness of this hotel. It looks absolutely ran down and just about ready to close its doors..

We came to the restaurant and set at the bar thinking we just want a quick bite and move on with our plans. Once we sat at the bar we noticed that the bartenders were fighting and yelling at each other about something and needless to say, completely ignored us... Another waitress walked into the bar and we tried to get her attention so we can order, she rudely yelled at us that she doesn't work behind this bar and walked away. Meanwhile, still to acknowledgment from the other bartenders. We lost our patients and got a manager that apologized profusely and comped everything besides the wings.

Refrigerator is $25/night. Really?
Extra bed is $15 per night and when you lie on it, it sinks to the floor. Might as well put mattress on the floor.

Our group got a pool level bungalow.  An otherwise nice view of the pool which is partially obscured by the bars that are part of the security gate.  The inside of the rooms are pretty antiquated and in some cases run down. Our room had a CRT(old, Non-flatscreen for those technologically impaired) Television, rust/corrosion stains and chips in the sink and bathtubs, some of the hardware (faucets) loose and a couple crickets and roaches inside.  Luckily the air conditioning worked because it was a good 110+ degrees our entire stay. Also on the patio and even in some areas of the pool (waterfall area) there is a weird sewage stench noticeable in the air.  Not sure what that's all about. 

I didn't eat at the restaurant but a few of my friends did and while they enjoyed the wings, some of them didn't enjoy the other food options offered.  The little gift/snack shop also offers donuts, coffee and sandwiches.  The sandwiches for $6 could be a lot better though, very plain and basic and honestly not a great value. I found myself walking over to the local gas station to buy one of their sandwiches just to save myself about $3 for about the same quality (maybe slightly smaller). A bottle of water was also still $3 so the gas station was also the alternative for that.

I didn't spend much time in the casino but it definitely felt ""old"".  They did have a sports style bar which was usually pretty empty but did have plenty of televisions.

The pool was actually the best part of this hotel and was probably the only thing other than the AC, that made this place acceptable. There are two main pools, one with a waterfall which runs a little cooler, another which runs a little warmer(and is more popular as a result) and some small Jacuzzi style pools. It's open 24 hours which is perfect for hot summer nights.  They have a DJ playing music, security and hostesses walking around and a bar right by. Plus if you have a bungalow you can go through the security gate (with key card unless it is left open) and get directly to the pool. They also held a beauty/swimsuit contest with the hooters girls by the restaurant area next to the pool which was great. All of this would have brought the review up to 3 stars except for on the last night (Saturday) after coming back from a long walk up and down the strip, we came back to find that the warmer pool had been closes and taped off.  Not sure why but I fear that some drunken frat kids maybe contaminated the pool ""somehow"" or perhaps it was something far more sinister.  Bummer.  The pool was considerably less busy as a result but nobody felt like going in the cooler pool that late.

The staff I encountered was actually pretty nice so that's one thing I can't really complain about. So kudos there.

The fact of the matter is that this is a cheaper hotel, so expect that.  If you don't spend a lot of time in a room in Vegas and you don't mind the location of this towards the end of the strip then I suppose it is for you.  It is nice that they have a pool which is [usually] open 24 hours.  The rooms are pretty run down, their televisions are antiquated and ours constantly lost signal and you might find a couple bugs here and there.  So if you are looking for ""nice"" rooms just pass.  Otherwise, on a budget, this place might suffice.

We responded that we will pay for everything else but not the wings.Finding those hairs ruined our appetites and we did not feel like it was fair to pay for something that disgusting. Also, while we looked over at the kitchen we noticed that none of the cooks who had long hair or beards had it covered. The manager then called security on us and we were trespassed for refusing to pay for wings that had several human hairs in it. Me and my family were humiliated and treated unfairly. I felt as no matter what we told them and even showed them, that they did not care. I am disappointed with customer service and hospitality that hooters has given me and my family.

When you read this review, please note that I am in no way a huge drinker or gambler and did not get the chance to enjoy the slot machines except for the blackjack slots. 

I was pretty excited to spend the weekend in Vegas with my family and friends near the holidays as we normally do during that time yearly. This time we decided to keep it cheap, so we decided on the Hooters Hotel and Casino. Here are just a few things:

The garage elevator was the scariest experience of my life. I hate elevators to begin with, they make me claustrophobic right off the bat, but this one, the doors didn't even open up all the way to let us out and I felt like we were almost in between floors when this happened. I didn't use this when we needed to return to the parking garage on the day we left either, I opted to use the stairs instead, all 5 stories of them. Whatever, I could use the exercise. 

I know that casinos smell like booze and cigs for the most park, but just walking through the casino nauseated me. The stench of cigs were just so potent. I felt like I was consumed, seriously, and we visited plenty of other hotel and casinos and did just fine with the smoke. My hair smelled for days after that even after plenty of shampoo applications.

It's sort of disturbing when you see a pregnant Hooters girl at their Hooters restaurant inside of this hotel waiting on tables with all that smoke going around. In fact, we took this trip a while ago and we are still talking about that. 

This is located a little bit off the strip, so its sort of a walk to all the main attractions, if you don't mind all of the cons mentioned above, then just the amount of money you save on a room is sort of worth it to stay there. 

The rooms were extremely cheesy. Adorned in Hooters paraphernalia, as it was expected though. The coat hanger in the bathroom was ripped off and not replaced, the beds were so so and the view from our room was....errrr....fantastic (insert sarcastic remark here). 

I do have to say though, the Hooters casino waitresses don't disappoint. The one time I sat at the slot machines with my sister, they were very prompt to serve us our free drink. Chintzy on the alcohol though, as I guess that's expected given this isn't exactly a 5 star hotel, and I'm not a huge drinker to begin with. Needless to say, we have passed on staying here since this trip. If you're looking for a really cheap hotel that's close enough to the strip and you don't mind pregnant waitresses waiting on you in heavy cig smoke, then Hooters is your place!",BjHK42BK2TV7CCBRFxW3Ew,2,0,1,OSNzjFrNnhnRfBJxED48Tg

These are all the questions that might cross your mind while you are staying at the Hooters hotel in Vegas. 

Let's be real here though. There are only a few reasons you are choosing to stay at Hooters in Vegas. 1. You spent way too much money getting there and doing activities that you didn't have enough money for a good hotel or you planned for the hotel way too late in the trip and this is one of your only options. 2. You want to see women with big breasts everywhere you walk and you don't get enough of that just walking down the strip, going to night clubs or strip clubs everywhere in the city. 

So if its reason one and you are doing this for money reasons then honestly it's not too bad. The rooms aren't great. They are really motel type rooms with two beds and the bare essentials of amenities. You are just kind of happy to have walls and a door here and hopefully you will be at other places on the strip so it's not too bad. It's better than Riviera because at least some of the things they promise you actually work. Also if you are going with a large group or don't really want to do much on the strip this is a good option because it's the cheapest option that is someone technically still on the strip. So if you are here for a conference or event and you don't mind Hooters showing up on your invoice then it's not the worst. 

If the second reason is the reason you came to Hooters hotel then enjoy being in the mecca of scantily clad women and bad decisions. It feels like a hooters restaurant that you can stay in. Really though I would recommend the playboy hotel or you know just going outside if you want to see women that badly. If you are looking to be on the strip and party and have the option please just go ahead and fork over the extra 50 to 100 dollars a night and stay somewhere on the strip. If you don't care about any of that then this isn't a bad option. 

This is that next day conversation with the one night stand you regret sleeping with. You knew what this was when you signed up for this. You aren't happy but you aren't really sad either. You had fun and you really wouldn't tell anyone else about what happened or why you ended up here.

We booked our weekend (Sat & Sun nights) online for NY NY but I screwed up and booked Sun & Mon and noticed in time to cancel, and changing to Sat & Sun was so much more expensive, and we had plans that would be keeping up pretty busy the whole time, so we decided to skimp on the hotel this time.  

My feeling is that it's just a bed, so I can spend my time where ever i want, and crash out in the hotel, who cares if it's not the best hotel?  But, that's not totally true.  I do like a nice, high end hotel.  This just was not the weekend to do that.  Last time we were in Vegas in Sept, we stayed at the Delano Towers.  Hooters is the polar opposite of The Delano Towers.

The hotel is old, it's decorated just like a Hooters restaurant.  Lots of pine paneling, tacky orange and brown stuff everywhere.  The hotel is the brick and mortar version of the Hooter Girls uniforms.  Old school, tacky, cheap....yet fun.  

Our room was not anything special, but it was clean.  It was old and the whole place needs a major overhaul, but it wasn't like the worst place in the world. 

We spent some time at the Hooters bar on Sat night after getting in from the UNLV game, that was pretty fun.  Trey was the bartender and kept us entertained.  

I am not sure if we will stay here again.  It's off the strip, but that is convenient for us since we have a fair amount of activities that involve visiting my bf's daughter who is a UNLV rebel girl, so we go out to the football stadium, etc, so being off strip is actually better for us.  It's not that far from the strip, anyways.",rMwMXCEMn9i1wpAJj1S3dg,5,4,3,CPaRVGgZBf5DeAzcIBkXJA

At about 10:15pm on 5/25/18 my husband and me were leaving Hooters hotel and casino and were walking thru the parking lot when the driver in the picture starts to drive thru the crowd almost hitting multiple people including a bride and groom and their family members were simply trying to take a quick picture to celebrate the moment. 

The driver becomes irrate and starts cussing at people (one of them being my husband who is in a wheelchair thank you very much). He puts his self between the crowd and the bystanders to protect them from being hit. 

An argument begins the driver and the family and my husband and a few of her friends start jumping in.  

This quickly turns into a much larger group of people and at this point there is still........

NO HOTEL MANAGER/STAFF OR even SECURITY intervening. I even scream out for help and NOTHING is done to help. You're deaf if you can't hear everyone yelling. 

The driver accuses my husband of being drunk ALL because he was holding a beer he had been drinking in his hand. FYI: IT WAS GOING TO BE THROWN AWAY BEFORE ENTERING VEHICLE. Pissed off my husband throws down the beer. She then reaches in her vehicle and uses mace on my husband and moments later she also maces me and almost maces my service dogs.

Now mind you we have done NOTHING to threatened her or harm her in anyway to warrant being maced so I immediately call 911. By now staff and security are outside but doing NOTHING to de-escalate the situation. While on the phone with 911 the argument is still continuing and STAFF and SECURITY have done NOTHING to call for help or ensure our safety or anyone elses safety. Medics WON'T/CAN'T do ANYTHING they claim to treat the mace. LVMPD has still NOT responded to the 911 call. 

Feeling threatened by STAFF and SECURITY we leave before LVMPD can get there. OH!!!! And hotel  MANAGER/STAFF have allowed the driver who attacked us to leave BUT had NO problem reporting my vehicle. 

OF COURSE.....I got her license plate before she could leave and will be filing a police report and other criminal charges on HER and the HOOTERS HOTEL and CASINO.

HOWEVER:

1) Summer special when booking online - $32 for the night, not including resort fees (about $14) and taxes.  This included:
a) Two free frozen alcoholic drinks 
b) Platter of 10 free wings
c) $10 free slots play 
d) $10 free ""match play""

2) Sign up for a free card to play in the casino (necessary for your free slots play), and you'll get another coupon for $5 free ""match play"" and $5 free (price of a beer) at the restaurant.

3) Check in offer at the bar - a free beer of your choice if you check in on Facebook or Twitter.  Sit at the bar and everyone in your party can check in apparently.

4) Sign up for text messages from Hooters, and guess what? Another free plate of 10 wings!

5) Sit at the bar when it's almost show-time, and there's a possibility a hypnotist will run by and hand you two free tickets.

Hooters is not a luxury hotel and does not pretend to be either.  Hooters is located just off the strip, across the street from the MGM.    First, it was inexpensive.  Second, the rooms were clean and large.  And finally , it had everything you could expect in a hotel- multiple swimming pools, multiple restaurants, parking, cable tv and good water pressure.  Hooters is a short walk from the action of the strip.  Las Vegas is a great tourist destination which you can't experience from a hotel room.  Therefore, Hooters is a great place to sleep, shower and change before you head out for your Las Vegas adventure.

Any ways, I hated staying here, it wasn't my cup of tea though there wasn't anything inherently wrong about it. I'm just picky I guess. But I really enjoy the ambiance on the casino floor for casual fun. If i'm feeling fancy, I head over somewhere else, but when I'm romping and stomping with a big group, we usually end up here at least for a bit. I'm a big fan of hooter's restaurants already (love hot wings) and this is like one big hooters restaurant, but with slot machines and craps tables.

I actually managed to come up 190 bucks on a hot table here (later lost on poker in the Aria) so I enjoyed it more than usual. Even if I lost it all it would of been ok since we had some fun with friendly and totally wasted strangers.

I give Hooters a hard worn and battered 3 stars because of the spartan decor in the rooms and the pool area. The rooms were adequate and nothing special.

The casino area itself was a bit cramped to me.  The slots, blackjack tables, and the bar near the entrance are too close to each other and that eliminated the illusion of space that many Strip hotels strive for.

The hotel is very run down. Maintenance is in over their heads and housekeeping seems to overlook even the most obvious details of cleaning a room.

In order to open the jammed door to our room, you had to lift up and push. The door had broken pieces and dents near the door knob, which makes me believe someone attempted to break into that room at one point. Management apparently doesn't deem this a necessary fix.
The bathtub was filthy... Nothing a good scrubbing couldn't fix, but it had a ring around it... As if housekeeping repeatedly bypassed scrubbing the bathtub. It's the first bathroom I refused to use due to uncleanliness. The floor was sticky like it had been mopped with a dirty mop, so I chose to keep my shoes on.
My ""non-smoking"" room was DEFINITELY smoked in and it smelled moist and musky.

The TV didn't work, but maintenance came and brought us a new cable to get it working again. Someone had stolen the cable to the TV.

My partner woke up in the middle of the night with a sudden breakout/reaction on both of his eyes.  The DIRTY BEDDING caused this. We left immediately and did not even finish our nights stay.

These rooms are in the attached two story building out by the swimming pool. We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street. 

Did not have a secure feeling as it felt like anyone could walk up from the street and have direct access to the sliding glass door. The rooms are all nonsmoking in the Bungalows so the sliding glass door was good for lover boy to go in and out for a smoke. That was the only good thing! 

Thank goodness I had my lover Sean with me for protection, otherwise I would have been sleeping with one eye open. 

We only stayed here one night as we attended an industry VIP open bar event and showing for ""Purple Reign"" who performs at Hooter's. We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night. 

This room sucked balls, and not the good kind. The bathroom tub was moldy and the water did not drain, seriously I took a shower standing in half a tub of water! The walls and floors had major mold as well. 

The room was very small, and had one outlet for electricity which was occupied by the lamp and TV. We had to reach behind and unplug the TV just to charge our phone, ridiculous.

Yes! You get what you pay for in Vegas when it comes to hotel accommodations! It was $27 for the night (weekday) we stayed on a Tuesday. 

Crappy rooms, moldy bathrooms and no outlets for charging your cell will leave you with a stinky taste in your mouth by staying in these rooms! 

Hooter's is a huge let down, it is obvious they have given up and are not going to put any money into keeping this property updated. What a shame! 

I normally complain when something is this bad, luckily for the front desk we had partied so much and just wanted to jump in bed and get busy. 

I later sent an email to Hooter's ""Customer Service"" with the complaint details of our stay, did I get a response? Of course not...lol I knew that was a waste of time.

If only that were the truth.

Let's see....  We got there and:
1) The elevator from the parking structure is out - so we hoof it from the 4th floor all the way to reception with our bags in tow.  

2)We got booked into a smoking room when we specifically asked for a non-smoking room

3)We got transferred to a non-smoking room (after a few hours) with a view of the Airport.... well, there would have been a view if the windows weren't so damned grimy

4)Uncomfortable Bed

5)Tube TV that kept cutting out every few minutes, which wouldn't have been bad on its own, but the batteries on the remote were dead.. HAH!

Okay, at 25 bucks a night, I might have agreed that we got what we paid for and it might have been a So-so 2.5 to three stars.  MAYBE.

We have always known its not a 5 star hotel (Hotwire rates it a ""3""... really?!) and never expected it to be, but we kept coming back because we really like the location - right near all the other big, popular casinos , how easy it is to get to your rooms, and loads of free parking. Realistically, it should now be 1 1/2 star rating.  Here's why - the air quality in the rooms is horrid, the bed smelled bad, the bed sheets smelled nasty, the carpet is stained and smells moldy.

Maybe I'm being too harsh, a group of homeless people liked it enough to set up camp on the northeast corner.  They were nice - I mean the one passed out on the only sidewalk to get anywhere from Hooters moved out of the way quick enough when asked.  

The sidewalk (past the homeless people) you'll discover a gauntlet of trash, pee, hundreds of nasty cans, bottles, dirt, clothes, shoes, and food.  I know its not Hooter's responsibility to monitor this, but common sense should kick in here - it's THE ONLY SIDEWALK OUT and if I were in charge I'd send my own people there to clean up the trash and steam clean the sidewalk.

Hooters will hook you up.  Seriously, I've stayed there twice: once I paid $35 per night, and the other time we took advantage of a friend's free two-night stay promotion that came in the mail.  And when they say free, they mean it... no small print or extra fees, just a kick-ass time set to the timeless beats of Prince's Purple Rain.  (I mean it, they must have played through that entire album like five times throughout my three-day stay... and I am certainly not complaining!)
 
Okay, so the rooms aren't fabulous... they've been known to have some unidentifiable brown stains on the carpet and I'd prefer not to imagine what other horrors would surface with aid of a black light. The casino is small and the cocktail waitresses are often old and jaded (but don't worry guys - the mandatory uniform still includes tight orange booty shorts)... However, in my opinion, all of this simply adds to the character of the place! Hooters is close enough to the strip, and to the shuttle that takes you through Excalibur, Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, that you can easily get your fill of the flashier money-pits that make Vegas what it is... and then, broke but too drunk to care, you can meander on back to Hooters at 5am with no trouble at all. Maybe even stop at Coco's on the way for a Lumberjack Breakfast.  Honestly, it's kind of a relief to be back in a smaller, less overwhelming casino after hours navigating the endless mazes that characterize the monster hotels... I mean, they are designed specifically to keep you in.

After more than 12 trips to Vegas in 3 years, I still had never stepped inside of Hooters. 

I can't remember how it happened. All I know is there were three of us left at the latter end of a corporate retreat that kept us in Vegas 2 days longer than we initially planned. We were feeling all kinds of adventurous (I mean, intoxicated), and some random person told us the roulette machines at the Hooters had better payouts.

So we went.

The short version: NO.

Outdated (vintage?) roulette table with similar payouts to the rest of Las Vegas (even on a weekday), except without the screen that displays where the ball's been landing so unless you 1.) have got excellent memory that doesn't get easily impaired or 2.) don't rely on probability or statistical propensity at all.. it's no fun.

Also, the standard machines are super old and aren't touch-screen. Most of those machines should be in a museum.

They don't even try to get you inebriated enough to think you might be enjoying yourself.

5973322,2014-10-24,1,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"Having stayed in the monster casinos, I now really like and choose Hooters. Not for the Hooters and the Wings, for the fabulous convenience. The Hotel is so inexpensive, and still clean and well kept. It is worn a bit, however the maintenance and upkeep is fine, just fine. It is easy to get in and out. I can self park and be less that 50 feet from the elevator and once inside it is a quick turn to the hotel rooms elevator. Unlike the giant casinos where you MUST walk and extra mile through a maze of a casino on every entrance and exit! This is so wonderful to have convenience. Next i can walk across the street and get on the LV monorail and presto I am at the convention center and it is a simple down the escalator and I am in the south hall. Fabulous! So for me as a convention goer this is my favorite choice. A block off the strip and with my monorail pass. the strip is right there and no car to drag along or try to find later. And it is next door to the airport for those who fly in!",3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,2,1,4,LiuA9OJfJm8IIZzaRf62Cw
5977753,2016-02-15,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,Got bumped from my original reservation. This was the only hotel available. Customer service was excellent! Management was awesome they were very helpful. Love the buffalo shrimp at night. You have to try the breakfast burritos here in the morning...off the charts. had some problems with my room but the management took care of it. Thanks!,ZHv-gs57nNKOnwci9dpJYg,1,0,4,sVErKl5r1SaTuExXT0PqWA
5982991,2012-09-27,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"First off, ""It ain't the Wynn and if you want the Wynn, stay at the Wynn!"" This place is not fancy or pretentious. However, if you want an affordable, casual and fun place to stay, then this is TOTALLY your destination.    I had concerns based on some of the reviews about what was to be expected. I am happy to reassure to all of you that this place rocks! The rooms are clean but a little beat up. I spoke to the General Manager who told me they were in the process of updating everything. The food was good and affordable, especially breakfast at the Onion!  The casino is a gem. The tables are affordable and the dealers are enjoyable to talk to, joke with and they are good with advice if you are new to gambling or not sure what to do. However, the best part of this destination are the people.  From the Pit Bosses, to the waitresses, the desk staff, and housekeeping, everyone was delightful and really wanted to make our stay special! It is obvious that the management team knows about service and is making sure that everyone is focused on doing the right thing for everyone.  The casino is a little small, but it gives you an almost family feel which was completely unexpected. I strongly recommend this hotel and casino and will definitely be going back!",iAtZM8PGfmelxMW54gmiAA,0,0,5,wX1zroq-ggNDNaR-vJJjhQ
5985904,2009-12-23,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I stayed here for 4 nights during Halloween this year and it was a pretty good experience. We arrived on Thursday afternoon and while Hooter's doesn't have their own shuttle, the airport has shuttles going anywhere on the strip for a fair price (I think mine was $12 round trip). We checked in and the guy at the front desk was really nice. I told him we were there celebrating my birthday and he upgraded us to a tower room on the 18th floor! Very cool, especially since it seemed like there we a lot of people there already.

The room itself was pretty standard. I kind of felt like I had gone back in time though. The room screamed 1976, but then again, you need to remember what hotel you're in. One thing I wasn't crazy about was that they had this great vanity area for getting ready, but someone forgot to put outlets near them... Everything was clean, but the beds had this comforter thing made out of funny material and it was that and the sheets on the bed. I thought about calling down to see if I could get a normal blanket, but decided it wasn't a big deal. 

The casino is somewhat small, but the slots are kind of loose. My first day there I won $150 on slots alone. They advertise 24/7 $3 Blackjack, but I never saw any tables. 

The walk to the strip was about 10 minutes from our room to the front of the MGM. Not too bad, but don't forget anything at your hotel because it sucks to walk back. I spent more on cabs than I wanted to, but if you think about it, Hooters pretty much paid for them with the money I won.

I don't know if I would stay here again. I think I really would have had a better time if I was on the strip. I might stop by the slots here next time I'm in Vegas though.",FEiGViDkyGPM5jp6cy-F4g,0,0,3,1QIggTumb2A2p4NrKPic7A
5986245,2012-10-29,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"There wasn't one issue with this place! The room was very clean and didn't feel dated, it's not that far from the strip, we got free late check out easily, and the pool scene is not as crowded as the other big hotels. I would definitely recommend this place",jGsHLsLwrkpxY53v0_yVmg,2,1,4,84iflk0sBF--se5tG8VHBQ
5987412,2010-06-27,1,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"I am now a fan of this place.  When I first stepped foot in this casino and wan not impressed and thought it was kind of ghetto, but after staying here for the weekend, this place really grew on me.  I like the fact the casino floor is smaller than the others on the strip.  That allows for a more intimate gaming experience.  I have always been a fan of the Hooters wings and like the close proximity to the restaurant when a wing craving hits.

The room quality is not the greatest, but the quality fits the price.  I rather save a few dollars on a room that I will hardly stay in while I am in Vegas.",uwpzu3w7wMYhfgBfBZ2j2w,2,1,4,EKCEn0ecTwac0T2Yqybi3w
5991724,2015-07-21,0,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,"This review will be mirrored on Groupon also.
Ordered a Groupon hotel deal for Hooters Casino Hotel on May 22nd and paid in advance for the room ordered. Checked into the hotel on July 15th with no problems and was charged the infamous Resort Fee as specified in the fine print. The next day I checked my bank account and found that Hooters charged my debit card an additional $259.34. I called front desk and was told that Hooters had not received the funds from Groupon, but upon further checking discovered that the funds had arrived and that they would release the hold on the $259.34
Checked out of Hooter Casino Hotel and was given a final account billing for incidentals, but found out that Hooters Casino Hotel never released the hold on the $259.34 charged to my card in error and made an adjustment to the held funds to cover my final billing. The problem is because Hooters Casino Hotel did not release the funds as promised I incurred several Overdraft Fee's on my account. When I  arrived back home I checked with Groupon and was told it was not there fault and that I would have to take the matter up with Hooters Casino Hotel. I asked my bank for assistance and confirmed the dates of the inappropriate transactions and will have to do battle with Hooters Casino Hotel for which I do not believe will be very cooperative or sympathetic. 
A better option to use in the future is the Hotel Tonight App, which I have used on occasion as a last minute hotel room purchase and have never had a problem with, even in short notice events.",FQ7gm4nW5Hf1jjg5QUDbEA,0,0,1,JpjrkUpDhQBXubz3AeX26Q
