The service was less than mediocre. Brianna who brought our food knocked my sons drink all over him and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. In fact she said she didn't do it when clearly she did if other customers said they saw her do it. It was obvious that there wasn't supervisor presence in the establishment. It's going to take customer service for this place to survive on the strip. You get what you pay for here. Good burgers and no customer service. This proves it is is hard to find good help!

I ordered the Bobby Blue as a salad (because I don't think my stomach could have handled another bun) but I totally wished I didn't! Not because the salad wasn't great, but I wished I had the whole burger experience! The patty was freakin' delicious! It was moist and tender and very flavourful.

Bobby I hope you will read this one day and correct this problem with the french fries after all they are an essential part to a burger. Just check out the pictures that I have taken and you'll see what I'm talking about.

According to my man his crunchy burger was juicy but it tasted salty too and the chips in between just made it more  saltier.  They must have placed too much salt when they seasoned their burgers as well as the tomato/salsa of my griddled cheese sandwich.

We went around 3:00 on a hot day so there were not many people dining at the time. I ordered a turkey burger with the fried egg on top. I shared an order of sweet potato fries with my cousin. Our food was very good. My burger was juicy and I loved the sesame bun. I was disappointed that that staff had not cleaned some of the tables because they were not that busy. We sat at table near the window so we could see the street.   Someone had started cleaning the table but had left a dirty table cloth on the table and the napkin holders in several chairs along with the condiment containers. This took up several chairs along the window. We were in the restaurant over an hour.Other employees saw this but never addressed it. This made the restaurant look dirty. I will try some of the other burger restaurants during my next visit.,KpeM6xV34A9oXQvQOwOnag,0,0,3,bWMqxYR-cs2V-HmWBLVxSg

327505,2014-06-01,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"The infamous BBP. The complete standard of the gourmet burger chains in the US. Shall I make you my first review on yelp? 

So I've been to BBP in Philadelphia, NY, NJ and DC and all of them are pretty consistent on their ""service"". Which brings me to Las Vegas and is why it gets a 3 star rather than the 4 I would give the others. Maybe it's management but the employees don't seem as motivated as the other locations.

The food was still to standard. I found that they've added the brunch burger and the Vegas? to the menu. I always lean towards the LA burger ""crunchified"" with the sweet potato fries (BECAUSE THE ONION RINGS ARE HORRIBLE) and that darn chipotle ketchup. There were many times that I've been close to stealing a bottle of it.

What I do think is a flaw is the tipping process throughout the chain. Since there's no tip line on the card receipts, the staff relies on cash. We, as customers, refill our own drinks and help ourselves to the condiments when they aren't around which makes us feel like we don't really have to tip the 20% for server ""unnamed"".

She had the classic I had the L.A which was chicken, tomato, avocado relish, watercress and cheddar. We both really liked the meal in fact, we raved about it to each other  for most of the trip. She had sweet potato fries and I had regular and a chocolate shake. Couple little thing would have put this experience at an excellent.

1.) my fries were good but quite salty.
2.) the shake was good, flavourful and thick but it was a regular 250 ml plastic glass for $6.50 which was a bit pricey in my mind. It's not fancy with whipped cream or cherries or big glass or anything like that. Just a good ol milkshake but if it was at a more reasonable price point my sister would have had one too.
3.) the biggest issue: the service sucked. We went in around noon and asked when they closed that night and were told midnight. So round 9:30ish we go over thinking we'll have plenty of time. We were one of 4-5 people in the restaurant and the staff seemed to be closing up. We were there for maybe 45 minutes and at the 25 minute mark things felt super rushed. The plates were taken away without being asked it we were done, the stink eye was given.

I expected more, especially for the lofty price. What we got was a couple of decent burgers, but nothing we couldn't get at a dozen other burger places, honestly I think Johnny Rockets has a much better burger. I got the Bobby's blue, and I am shocked to hear myself say this, because I love cheese, but this had too much cheese. Could not taste the juiciness of the burger it was so drowned in cheese. My wife had the classic which looked to me to be a fairly run of the mill burger. 

We also ordered a half and half fries and onion rings and were presented with an anemic order of fries that was barely enough for 1 and TWO onion rings. The onion rings were not even the same size, bringing the spectre of conflict into the picture as the two patrons must then choose who gets the bigger one. C'mon, two freaking onion rings? This was a $5 side order and was supposed to be half and half. Perhaps the other half dozen onion rings were MIA, I don't know. 

Service wise, the place was empty, but somehow our burgers came out 5 mins in advance of our drinks. Unacceptable. As for drinks, I ordered a strawberry shake, which taste wise was fine, but here again, the glass was not very large, it didn't come out with the metal carafe with the rest of the shake, and for 9 bucks I would have expected a hell of a lot more. 

Summary, unless you are absolutely dead set on trying a Flay spot, pass on his palace, its extremely poor value, mediocre service and palatable but rather ordinary food.

Edit: I did get an almost immediate response from the BBP social media person promising they would address the shortcomings in my review with the LV location management.

We got the fries/onion ring combo along with the premium margarita and the cactus pear margarita.  

The burgers were excellent, both cooked perfectly to order.  Crunchifying each burger seemed unnecessary as they were pretty rich to begin with.  I thought the New Mexico burger was slightly better because it had a nice kick of spice with the green chilies.  The fries and onion rings were awesome as they have a few different sauces you can try including chipotle ketchup.  The only reason for 4 stars is the cactus pear margarita wasn't that great.  The premium frozen margarita, on the other hand, hit the spot.

I came in with my boyfriend today at about 4:30 for a quick bite since we were staying right next door at Aria and also I'm a fan of Bobby Flay. The ""manager"" (and I use quotes because we'll, I'm using that word loosely) was sitting next to us, not working but instead talking to a tall dark handsome customer who I'm pretty sure she knew. The ENTIRE time we were eating our meal, we sat there listening to her loudly talk shit about the employees and as well her manager. Apparently her manager wanted her help to rent a party bus of sorts but then he backed out and now he's an ass for doing that.. According to her. After she gave him the price he told her it was too expensive and didn't want it but her opinion was, why take your family on vacation if you can't afford it. STFU! It's not your place to say those things and you work in a fucking $10 burger joint so don't act like you have room to tell other people how to spend their money. Also, I had to eat my meal listening to her tell the other customer/friend how one of the workers is lazy and she always has to keep an eye on him. That's fine, but any manager with a little sense in their head would know to not do that in front of customers who are trying to eat their lunch. I was really turned off by how unprofessional she was and it's sad that the other workers have that kind of a person they have to answer to...or that they're being talked about behind their backs In front of customers by their manager ..how embarrassing. 

Brunette manager working Saturday 9/20 afternoon shift get a grip! I was 2 seconds away from telling you off but my boyfriend stopped me, thank god for your sake... You need to be embarrassed just like you did to your workers. You really struck a nerve and I hope this review comes back to you. These 2 stars go out to you.

A ""Numbered"" stand is provided after you placed order then you proceed to find your own table & place the ""Numbered"" stand on your table so that a staff will bring your food when it is ready.

The LA burger tastes blend; I have to add chipotle ketchup; bottom part of the bun is flat & soggy.  But the meat patty itself is perfect - medium rare - crispy outside - nice & juicy inside.  Use brioche buns would be much better.

The burger of the month - Cheyenne burger is very good but the bottom part of the buns is flat & soggy as well.

The Super Kale salad is okay but a bit on the salty side.

Blackberry & Pomegranate and Blueberry & Chocolate shakes are way too sweet for our palate.

So I got the burger of the month Cheyenne Burger grass fed beef with sharp cheddar smokey bbq sauce topped with buttermilk onion rings and bacon. Washed that down with lemonade which wasn't housemade just Simply brand and a combo of reg and sweet potato fries. Sounds delicious right!? Well it was kind of a let down here is why #1 when it was brought table side no onion rings on top!  #2 my bun looked toasted to the eye but it was soggy once drenched with the gobs of bbq sauce #3 it was room temp. I ordered it medium so it was cooked to perfection  but I didn't care for the bbq sauce I've made better at home. The burger itself would have benefited from some good ole s&p and the fries were good but those onion rings were the star they were absolutely phenomenal and gave the burger the flavor it needed. I'd return just for those onion rings! Another friend ordered the same and it failed to impress her as well but another loved it so aye. Also another patron ordered bacon cheese fries which is on the menu with scallion but neither received. So the kitchen needs to pay attention to small details. I'm not naive enough to think just bc its Bobbys restaurant we should have perfection bc it isn't him cooking just his name. However I definitely expect some standards which I didn't see.

All the reviews said to try the sauces? Hmmm their are no labels on them. I had to get a employee to explain the sauces evidently your labels rubbed off the bottles? Are you kidding me? Get a new system! 
The drink choice are also poor. Get with the system and get some better upper end sodas and not a soda machine I can find in any fast food restaurant.

The location and atmosphere were great, i sat at a bar style seat looking onto the strip, it was nice. The burger was great! I got the classic crunch style and the meat, bun, toppings were delicious and clearly high quality. One note, I've heard this place compared to In-and-Out or Shake Shack... Not a fair comparison... These burgers are more gourmet and better compared to Red Robin or Five Guys, and I think it was better than both of those.
Part 2: we went back in the afternoon for refreshments and Nora was our bartender. She was awesome, just outstanding on every level! I got a Margarita for $10 the was strong, delicious, and all around wonderful. The wife got the Little Raspberry which was $12 and her favorite drink of the trip so far.
Tip: go with a friend, sit at the bar, split a burger and fries, and get strong delicious drinks from Nora!",UKec3Heio5Ii-Nmj1NsyqA,1,2,5,0wwRpOHQJBT5awaFQANP1Q

Sat down after ordering.  I noticed that cleaning was in progress on the island I was sitting on.  There were dirty countertops on the island as well.  

My burger came almost immediately after ordering.  No way it was cooked to order and while it was medium as I ordered it was barely warm.   Onion rings were ok.  First two were tasty but the bottom few were a greasy mess.  They arrived after my burger

Cheese on my burger was cold and gross

Bussers never cleaned the area around me ( was there about 20 minutes).  Also a busser dropped some frys on the floor and then picked them up and threw them away.  He then grabbed some towels and wiped his hands without washing and went back to his job.  I could see the dish area from my seat. 

Restaurant seemed heavily staffed in the kitchen and the dining area but I found the restaurants pretty dirty and the food pre-cooked.",nrnCnSr7cxqGqMBi5QuO2Q,1,0,2,L7yL5RBqc9mm4869s3AlBw

Solid Dark Chocolate Milk Shake and the mix of sweet potato fries and regular fries.

The cons: I got the Crunchburger and it was made just like any other burger. My burger was accompanied with a slice of American Cheese and a handful of potato chips. Yes, it was good, but it was not special. It was not memorable and and the burger was dry. I added some chipotle ketchup to it (which was one of the five sauces that was placed on the tables), and it added some flavor to it. The burger seemed overpriced for the mere simplicity and blandness of the overall burger. As for the sweet potato fries, they were a bit limp and bland as well. It was accompanied by a honey mustard and a ranch dipping sauce, but neither matched well with these fires. A sweeter ketchup may have been a better match to these fries.

My mint chocolate chip shake had a very strong, pleasant vanilla extract-like flavor.  The mint was not super strong, but was a nice aftertaste.

Not a fan of the communal seating, but it wasn't crowded so I could be by myself.  There was construction on the front half of the dining area, where one of the employees said they were going to install a bar.

It's a really cool setup. Lots of unique lights and fun wave shaped counters. The chair were uncomfortable though. And far away from the counters.  You order at a counter and then find a place to sit.  Someone will bring your food out. 

I ordered the Brunch Burger cooked medium. Angus beef, over medium egg, American cheese, and bacon. Pure deliciousness. And actually cooked to a medium!! (They have a burger temperature chart at the register when you order. Smart) I have found that the bacon on burgers usually isn't all that great. This one proved me wrong. My egg was actually still runny, the way it should be.  And the cheese... It was actually melted and delicious.  It seriously like exploded in my mouth. 

My boyfriend ordered the Vegas burger and raved about it forever. He loves his burger medium rare, but usually doesn't receive it this way. For once, he did. It was still dripping and all. His mom ordered the New Mexico burger and also loved it.

They have a bunch of different sauces at the counters: chipotle ketchup, burger sauce, jalapeño hot sauce, fry sauce, etc.

The only thing we didn't enjoy were the fries. Both the regular and sweet potato fries were overcooked. We did 1/2 regular fries and 1/2 onion rings for one order. It only came with two (delicious) onion rings :/ 

Bobby Flay himself was there. We went over and said hi.

Service was extremely attentive. Plates were cleared quickly, refills were offered even though it's self service, etc.

It's more like a 2.5 for me but I'll round it up because Lola our waitress+bartender was doing a great job attending to the 8 of us. 

I had the Brunch burger which was a burger that consist of egg + bacon + chips(if you want it to) and of course the patty. Bobby's burger palace makes their burger more into a classic american burger. It kinda left something to be desired for. I would say that the patty was actually juicy but everything else in my burger was so so. The egg was dry, I thought it would be yolky... the bacon wasn't crispy enough. The chips taste like lays but never had it in a burger before(which was aite). Kinda nice to have that crunch that the bacon lacked. The bun was most disappointing. 

We had the combination of fries + onion rings. I thought the onion ring wasn't bad. The fries could be better but it wasn't terrible.

I probably wouldn't come back but I still kinda prefer this place over shake shack. The price is around $10 per burger. With that said, I probably wouldn't return to either one.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,1,1,3,Q-sV_iouM77fBB49dxpoMQ

Love his shows and I've taken my wife to eat at his Mesa Grill restaurant in Vegas, which by the way was excellent. With this current visit to Vegas with my wife we made it a point to eat at BBP. As we started our walk to the restaurant from the NY NY we passed by one burger place that had a line out the door. We both said ""wow, its a busy night tonight"". When we reached BBP and walked in there was only a handful of customers eating. Didn't think much of it at first and we proceeded to place our orders. I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger and my wife ordered the Maimi Burger. As we sat there waiting for our order to come out I immediately noticed the floors looked like they hadn't been swept for at lest a few hours. Straw wrappers, bread crumds and used napkins littered around the tables. There is a view of the cooks who seemed to be muching on food as they worked over the grill. Not good. The wait for the burgers wasn't an issue but the first thing I noticed when it came out was the size. For a $10 burger I was expecting something big. It was average sized, comparable to something you'd get from Wendy's. Immediately disappointed. Well it better taste amazing then. It was again average, nothing special. It wasn't bad but I was expecting Chef Flay amazing. I was starting to understand why BBP was pretty empty with customers and the place just down the road was packed.

Great that you can choose ground turkey or chicken breast, in addition to the angus beef, which was a perfectly juicy medium-well.  Loved the various sauces Bobby Flay's known for: spicy jalapeño, creamy BBQ, smoky chipotle ketchup, sweet mustard, and even the ranch was the best I've ever tasted! The onion rings were crispy with a nice, peppery crunch. I also got the frozen pink margarita- it had a very smoothly blended ice texture, and was so delicious! My burger was a scrumptious balance of sweet, tangy, and spicy. Total tab without the tip for two burgers, regular fries, the ""can't decide"", a bottle of water, and margarita, was $42. I'd say this place seemed really kid friendly, could be a cozy date place, and the long tables were great for large groups of family or friends.

Listen I'm a Bobby Flay fan!! Every Throwdown or showdown he competes in I always want him to win, I mean he's Bobby Flay!! He made Foodnetwork famous, he is great on every show, Brunch with Bobby always makes me hungry.

As for Burger Palace, it is good. It's convenient, and very casual.  Not the fancy prestige of Burgr (which I love) So if you are in the mood for fast no fuss food, it will deliver.  But this is Vegas, so you expect a little glitz and glam, not here. The most glam they offer is a multitude of sauces on the table.  I enjoyed the sweet potato fries and their honey mustard sauce, I also had a feta salad which was interesting and generous on the avocado, all positive aspects. But onto the burgers, the best way to describe them is as a good burger from your friend's backyard BBQ. You know the charred, slightly dry taste, on an underwhelming bun, but you eat it and enjoy it because you are in good company, that's how they taste. 
We also got a black and white milkshake, again it was good, about as good store brand vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup will taste.

The food came out relatively fast, however, the meals in our group came out staggered with a few minute delay in-between.  It also seemed like some meals   spent way too much time sitting on the counter under a heat lamp.  I spied my burger and fries sitting there for about 4 minutes, which is disappointing when you're hungry (and want freshly cooked food).

Overall, I was relatively pleased with Bobby's Burger Palace.  The burger meat reminded me of Fat Burger, which is fine.  The bun (out of the bag sesame and sort of flat) needs to be improved.  I have a hard time believing Chef Flay put his stamp of approval on this style of bun. In a prize fight, the stiff competition from across the strip, Gordon Ramsay's burGR bun would easily kick butt on Bobby's flyweight bun.

The fries reminded me of In-N-Out, but were more seasoned and less crispy.  The price is reasonable (for Vegas) and the location on the Strip is user-friendly (and within easy walking distance from Aria & Mandarin Oriental).
 
Mildly related was a towering celebrity sighting outside of BBP on the strip of Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond Fame, who gave us a quick nod as we locked eyes and he ambled off with stilted legs to his comedy club gig at MGM Grand.

Epilogue - Alexandra Niakani (PR for BBP) reached out to me via Yelp.  I promptly send her an email response with my contact information to discuss my experience at BBP (which she acknowledged).  7 days later, there's no response from anyone associated with BBP Las Vegas.  So, in all fairness, since your claim of taking reviews ""very seriosly"" didn't happen, I dropped a star from my review.

New Year's Eve we needed a quick bite to eat.  I decided to give Bobby's Burger Palace a second chance.  This time, the service was very good.  The cashier/host, Nathaniel, hooked us up and there was a manager on the floor who was working hard to expedite meals to diners.  It seemed like a completely different operation from the last time I was there (with a prbable shake-up of personnel).  Finally, my burger (The ""L.A."" topped with avacado relish) was very tasty.

Me personally, I like good food and don't give a shit who's cooking it.  The place is clean, the menu is short, and the product is simple in a fantastic way.  It's like people don't understand that this is supposed to feel like a blue plate special/simple lunch counter/diner style. 

The burgers come with a variety of toppings, all of them fantastic (that blue cheese, holy shit) but are presented simply because they want the beef to shine through.  You can tell the quality of the beef in every perfectly-medium bite.  The bun is nothing special, but that's ok because it's essentially treated as a vessel to deliver that amazing beef to your mouth.

It's not gimmicky and it's not flashy but damn is it good.  Take the lines at BRGR, I'll stay here.",2es7AT3Q7tg1KGkUXXDTyg,3,1,5,YPDQ0De_JrsF-w3QmWW2pg

1763964,2017-08-14,28,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"I'll start this off by saying that my rating for this place is really 3.5 and if we received our burgers cooked correctly it would have been a solid 4. 

This place is super casual and it's a true burger bar. You order as you walk in and the menu is straight forward. Burgers, shakes (regular or spiked), salads and sides. There's also this thing called ""get crunchified"" for FREE and they'll put crispy potato chips on any burger for you. They also offer ""the undecided"" for anyone who can't make up their mind on which sides to try and want to split different ones. I thought these touches were very cool. 

After you order you seat yourself anywhere that's open. 

We ordered a crunchburger that came with American cheese and potato chips on it and a brunch burger with a fried egg, bacon & American cheese. We were also undecided on the sides so we chose onion rings and sweet potato fries. We ordered medium burgers but received well done ones. That always sucks because we really enjoy juicy patties. My egg was also well done and no runny yolk :( Didn't send them back because it was late and we were really hungry and exhausted. To the positives, the burgers were very flavorful as Bobby is known for that and everything was well proportioned. The onion rings were cut quite large and I prefer smaller cuts as its always a pain in the ass to bite into them but the batter was also falling apart before you could get it into your mouth. Sweet potato fries were great, at least the ones on top that were nice and crispy but everything beneath them was mushy as they sat around too long in a narrow container and couldn't breathe. 

I'm a huge fan of Mesa Grill and I know that Bobby has the skills so I hope someone can come in here and make a few tweaks and regroup the kitchen staff. The flavor profiles are great but the execution needs some work.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,46,41,3,4VliHW9Hg_SSL1ldOXG53w

1766562,2015-10-01,30,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Bobby Flay seems to be everywhere these days. Unaffected by his recent tabloid exposure, his empire of restaurants, TV shows, signature sauces and spices, cookbooks, and kitchenware are ubiquitous.

I even dreamt that Bobby came over to barbecue with us the other night (note to self: cut down on late-night Food Network binges). I am a fan of his big bold flavors and southwestern-style food.

We look forward to discovering a life-changing restaurant or meal each time we visit Las Vegas. This trip, we made reservations at Giada's. Our second choice: Bobby's Michelin-starred Mesa Grill @Caesars. The main reason we chose Giada's was convenience, as it's is a short walk from our City Center hotel. Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) was not even on our radar.

But as we walked out of our hotel in the middle of this hot, drought-stricken desert city carved by time, tradition, and the mob -- right there in front of us -- a mirage? NO. Psychosis? NO. Standing tall: a BBP!!! The skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked a bit like Cat Cora chanted...""hallelujah"".

I got on my OpenTable app and dropped Giada faster than NBC dropped Bill Cosby's fall sitcom, choosing BBP instead (sorry Giada D!). Note to Giada: Since you and Bobby are such good ""friends"", you should be okay with this.

What I knew about BBP is that it was created to serve food that Bobby himself likes to eat when he's done working in his kitchens. Simple burgers, fries and shakes with his signature gourmet touches. Until recently -- the locations were all on the east coast. But now open for your west side Flay-fix, the largest Burger Palace ever -- at City Center in Las Vegas.

Designed more like a hip lounge or bar, the place has brightly colored lime and brown furnishings, sweeping curved counters and walls, ample window seating, long communal tables, whimsical light fixtures, and striking neon signage. Bold design to prepare you for some bold flavors ahead.

I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger. 6 full ounces of 80/20 Certified Angus Beef with perfectly melted blue cheese. Bacon, lettuce and tomato on a soft sesame seed bun. ""Crunchified"" of course - topped with crispy thin potato chips. Took a bite... OMG... the skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked like Cat Cora chanted...""hallelujah"".

Combined with the transcendental golden-brown Vidalia onion rings that taste as good as they look, and the LIFE-CHANGING cream-a-licious ""mocha caramel"" shake, this was a meal that sang together in beautiful, perfect food harmony. The burgers, rings, and shakes I've been eating my entire life are now totally meaningless. 

I would gladly eat at Bobby's Burger Palace regularly -- but as of now there are no California locations. So I guess its back to the Food Network and Cooking Channel we go....

Protip: If you can't get a regular Flay-fix because you aren't on the east coast (or Vegas), you can take any of the house-made sauces home for $6-$10. BBP Fry Sauce (tangy mayo, roasted red and adobo peppers), Burger Sauce (think steakhouse sauce, thick and rich), Chipotle Ketchup (smoky and fiery) or the Jalapeño Hot Sauce (green chilies for heat).

The menu looks great. Wonderful variety, reasonable price point for Vegas Strip dining. You order up front and are given a number. There are no tables, booths or comfortable options for seating. It is all bar stool seating and only counter options. Basically you dine next to everyone else. I wouldn't care if I went to a bar and expected that, but not while having lunch with my husband. Luckily the place was almost empty, but it was a major bummer. 

Forgive me for forgetting the names of the burgers we got, but basically they were super forgetable. Messy, onions way under grilled, cold bun, chunky lettuce that was more rib then greens and thin meat patty. Even adding sauce did not improve the lack of flavor. My husband said his was 'okay', but mine was plain awful.

Onion rings were fine. Nothing interesting to report. The bacon cheese fries were super delicious. Fresh fries, crispy bacon and super melty cheese. A perfect side. The shake we ordered, black and white, was fine.

First off, getting there can be a bit tricky. I'm sure there's an easy way but since when do I ever do anything the easy way? Haha! (Sorry I'm getting off the point). So my advice, don't do what I did which was self park at The Aria. You'll do quite a lot of walking thru the casino to find it and unless you're specifically looking for it, you won't just happen to stumble upon it. 

Lines are long but they move quickly. And in that time you get a chance to go over the menu. The employees manning the cashiers are very efficient and friendly. That's always a plus with a busy location. 

So I picked the burger that jumped out at me. The L.A burger of course. Can you guess why? ;) I get teased quite often for my love of avocados. What can I say, I'm a sucker for all things green. ; ) After the first bite I realized there was nothing I really liked or thought was outstanding about my burger.

All parts of our order came out at seperate times. 

Fries first for my husband and daughter..I expected HOT Crispy fries.. instead they were barely warm and definitely soggy.... then my salad which was missing the Feta cheese that should have been on it.
Then my husband's very underdone burger which was ordered for medium well but could be classified as medium if he was lucky. IS THIS NOT A BURGER PLACE???

Last but not least we were able to witness an employee argument between cashier and person who clears table.

First of all let me begin by saying that I am a long time yelp user although I have never contributed to any reviews before. Tonight, I went to Bobby's Burger after reading scores of positive reviews, and the fact that I was starving and my brother who works across the street was waiting for me to pick him up. I also want to add that the the burger and fries that I was having was absolutely fantastic!! 

It all started going down hill as I was finishing around half my blu cheese burger when I needed a refill on my soda, so I got up to get my self refill and by the time that I got back all of my food was taken away by one of the servers!! When I got back to the table another server saw the look of astonishment on my face and asked me what the problem was so I explained and at least he offered to cook me another burger but at that point I was already getting texts that my brother was waiting for me so to wait again for another cooked burger and then to sit down and eat again was not an option!! I even made a complaint to the cashier and he just gave me the ""oh well"" look. Needless to say that I left very upset after paying over $17 for what really was a great burger and not being able to enjoy it, I honestly felt (and told the cashier) that I was being rushed out of the restaurant as I thought maybe they were closing and just wanted to rush me out.

Honestly, like I said before, the burger tasted great but now I'm not sure if I would return to this establishment again and if I do, either I would need to carry my 1/2 eaten burger and fries with me to refill my drink or sit right next to the soda fountain.

They don't have a kids menu but they we opted for the griddle cheese sandwich which was also good. A tad pricey for its size (almost $8 or $9 for sandwich size bread) - but it's Vegas right? Kids also had 2 milkshakes - the vanilla & chocolate & the dark chocolate. Both were very good - dark chocolate the better of the two if u want ur chocolate fix.

1939076,2015-02-20,3,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"BBP is a more fast food style place than other strip gourmet burger stops. Its about 1/2 the price of Burgr or Holsteins, and I would say better than 1/2 the quality. Could it be better-yes. Is it a good value for the price- yes. 

The real standout item here for me was the shake. I got the black and white and just picking up the glass and feeling the weight I could tell it was going to be a truly thick shake- not a thing, soupy glass of nonsense. It is 6.50 for a shake- if Quentin Tarantino saw that he may roll over in his coke binge. But its a REALLY good shake. 

The burgers had very high quality meat. They appear to use that technique where they grind the meat and keep the grains for making the burgers so they are fall apart in your mouth tender. I got the Las Vegas and it was pretty spicy and very flavorful. I will say the bun was a bit of a let down- seemed pretty cheap/and was totally bland. The burger was not served searing hot which I would of preferred- nothing tastes better than 3rd degree burns- but it certainly wasn't cold.

The fries/Onion rings- we got the 1/2 and 1/2- the onion rings were very good. The fries weren't very crispy so I would take off points for that. The fry sauce and chipotle ketchup are both delicious.

Frozen Cactus Pear Margarita- yes please. 

Overall, this place isn't Mesa Grill- you can kill yourself with food for 20 dollars and you get a quality meal for that money. If price is no option and you have time to wait I would say go to Burgr, otherwise BBP is prob the 2nd best cheap strip burger behind, ironically, Strip Burger IMO",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,4,5,4,gcAUyuplH4JUMLaLWoQ4Gg

The beer battered onion rings were not the business... I seriously saw LUMPS of salt adhered to each piece. I only had one piece and couldn't finish the rest. These were $4 for about 5 pieces...

The service was great, but I don't think I would be back to Bobby's Burger Palace unless someone's treating me! Haha. I ended up spending a little under $20 on a burger, fries and a small fountain drink... I pay about $11 in Los Angeles for the equivalent at Hook Burger, sans the potato chips.",B1m44jSEkCCyH6Hnyt4f1A,2,2,3,MVoYifo900Fsr7viAO0BjQ

2095849,2017-11-15,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"I was extremely excited to try this place and looking very forward to giving it a good review. Sadly, Bobby's palace turned out to be similar to the ice palace in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for me. It enticed me in with promises of endless delight and then crushed my dreams. At least no one turned to stone, though.

The best thing about this place for me has to be the location. We were hungry after walking the strip and it was easy to get in and out with direct strip access. It was all downhill from there.

We ordered a variety of menu items and found out they couldn't be customized. We asked for additional items on burgers and some to be removed from other burgers and were told they were limited and couldn't add or remove items. Bobby's Palace, Bobby's burger. I realize that a chef crafts a meal to achieve a certain result, but this is a casual burger joint. There isn't even wait staff.If I want a tomato on my burger is that really a huge deal? When I asked the reason for the controlled menu I was given a response that if the burgers were customized by patrons Bobby couldn't be responsible for how people review them on Yelp because it ceases to be his recipe. Well, here you go. Once I pay for the burger doesn't it then becomes mine? If I want a tomato than I feel like that should be acceptable. It's not foie gras or any type of fancy gastronomical creation.  

My second critique would be the price. I get it, it's Vegas and it's the strip. I should expect to spend more than standard prices, but I fed my whole family at the Cheesecake Factory at Caesars Palace for the same price with tip. 

My third downside here may be an upside for some people, but I am not really a fan of the communal seating. It feels like a cafeteria to me and not a restaurant. It's not private and not particularly kid friendly since your kid may be impacting the meal of patrons surrounding you at the tables. It is also hard to talk or have an intimate conversation. 

The most personal disappointment for me here, though, was the salad. It was tiny for the price, the produce was less than fresh, and I did not enjoy the mix of flavors. I had the crunch salad and the bitterness of the radicchio, cucumber, and feta combine with the vinaigrette was overwhelming. The flavors built on each other to amplify that bitterness and the avocado, romaine, and chickpeas were not enough to balance the flavor.   

The only thing I really enjoyed here were the onion rings which were fairly good.",4P1Z7pUGC8aQjNRImEXiqw,3,0,2,HYluYy-ztxyB7bPH-3RLTQ
2102065,2016-10-24,3,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"I must first start by saying I am a big fan of Bobby Flay, so it hurts my soul to write this review.  This establishment was filthy!  Food on the floor, spots on the floor, and dirty chairs.  I saw crumbs all over tables,  I witnessed a server rake a few crumbs from the table on to the floor, then she must have realized there were too many so she took the menu and gathered them into her hand.  More crumbs still remained on the table, and at no time did I see a server actually use a towel to wipe down any of the tables.  I saw a patron come in and use a napkin to wipe the table she was sitting at, and I observed a server watch her do it and did not step in to clean.  

If the front of the house is like this for all to see, I cringe at what may be happening in the kitchen.  Three stars because I enjoyed the LA burger that I had and the Margarita was tasty too.  Please, I ask that more attention is taken to cleanliness.  It was not crowded so there was no excuse for the condition of this place.

He was being a super trooper, following me around as I window shopped from one end of the strip to the next. I thought a little reward was in order so we found Bobby's and were happy! He loves burgers and we like Bobby Flay so why not. 

Procedure: Walk in, order and pay at the counter. Take your number and find a seat. You can build your own or choose from a list. You can also pick the way you want the your patty cooked. 

What we ordered:  
The LA Burg, sub pimento cheese = DEEE-RISH-CIOUS! I remember watching one of Bobby's backyard cooking shows where he made a burger with pimento cheese so I decided to try it. The gentleman taking our order was so nice in helping me make the substitution. Avocado relish wasn't sour- tasted like avocado with a little seasoning. The pickle that comes on the side with the burger was really really good. We easily split it in half.

Bucket of mixed fries = Too much! Granted, we ate White Castle about 3 hours earlier. I can't see myself eating a whole burger plus fries by myself. Russet potatoes for the regular version and sweet potato. They lose their crunchiness if you leave them out. I suggest eating these prior to the burger to guarantee optimal freshness. 

I would like to come again and try another burger. It is a gourmet burger joint and meant for those who don't necessarily want a ginormous Guy Fieri sized messy monstrosity.... Though you can order a huge burger if you'd like...",ceC9qIoD6MDCmENjN11_mA,2,1,4,QIZ3dtAUI9aoYF0ivfPbLA

On the positive side, everyone was friendly, the gal didn't complain about getting me a burger that I paid for.  Place was clean, bright, airy.  But, none of us would return.

1. I don't care for burgers
2. I'm a cheapskate

This place greatly exceeded my expectations. I love Bobby's cooking shows, but I know from experience that a famous name doesn't equal quality food. 

You place your order at the counter and then take a seat with a number. The seating is very comfortable and decor is cool and upbeat. I ordered the Carolina with onion rings and a cactus pear frozen margarita. 

Once your order is ready, the servers bring it to you from the deli style cook counter. 

My burger was absolutely incredible. The patty was cooked and seasoned perfectly, the cole slaw provided a great crutch, and the sauce was subtle but added a delicious flavor to it. I swore I tasted a horseradish note  but it wasn't listed so maybe I just imagined it. 

The onion rings were perfectly seasoned as well and had just the right amount of breading. Sometimes it can taste like an onion sandwich, but this added flavor but yielded to the onion. I don't care much for ranch, but it was great. 

During the meal I commented to my wife ""ok, so I like SOME hamburgers"" as this honestly the first good burger I've had in years.

Service is always very good - very friendly and helpful staff. Food is brought out promptly and well prepared. 

My most recent visit was no different. Two circa 5th grade friends were in town for a girls weekend (aka BAEcay because we crack ourselves up...) and staying on the strip. 

We had a round of their prickly pear margaritas....because hot pink!  The server said not to let the color fool us, because they weren't sissy drinks...he was correct. I love the color, and they don't skimp on the tequila. I usually order one each time I go. They don't necessarily taste much different than a traditional frozen margarita, but I am a sucker for prickly pear flavored anything. 

Our burgers were great, I believe everyone in the group was pleased...I was too busy people watching and inhaling my burger to notice if they weren't. I like the burger with the chiles and white American cheese, and I crunchify it, I can't remember we what it's called but unless the burger of the month can't be resisted, that's my standard order. The fries are always great too- started out ordering them to share but have since learned my lesson on that...get your own fries! 

Best burger in Las Vegas? Nah...best celebrity chef burger on the strip? I feel comfortable saying yes.

The green pepper sauce adds a little heat to a burger or a twist in your ranch for your onion rings. The chipotle ketchup is amazing.

Dallas Burger $9.50

Philly Burger $9.50

The Undecided (onion rings and fries mix) $5

Blueberry-Pomegranate Milkshake $6.50

My burger was pretty good. The coleslaw's acidity helped mellow the sweetness of the BBQ sauce and the richness of the cheese. My wife said her philly burger was good also. The onion rings were probably the crispiest ones i've ever tasted with a nice, thick batter. The fries were good too and not greasy. The milkshake was great! It was rich but refreshing at the same time. I though at first that the milkshake serving was too small for $6.50 but when we finished it, I was stuffed.

Overall, this place is a good ""cheat day"" resto. I think what really makes this place good are Bobby Flay's sauces/condiments and its prices. I really enjoyed the jalepeno sauce and burger sauces as they really add another layer of flavor to your burger. And for value, I think its noteworthy considering Gordon Ramsay's burgers are around the $13-$18 range. Oh ya, you can ""crunchify"" your burger (add potato chips) for FREE!

The burgers come out stacked tall instead of wide, which lets you have the satisfaction of smooshing it all down into a juicy condensed meat puck. 

You can order any of the burgers ""crunchy"" which means they add potato chips to the top (whoop dee doo). It's more gimmick than anything but hey, who doesn't like potato chips?

I wasn't a huge fan of any of their specialty dipping sauces.

The burger itself is cooked perfectly. You can tell them exactly what type of done-ness you'd like and they get it on the mark. The meat and fries are both perfectly salted too, not too salty nor too drab. Good job guys.

The interior is super cute and fun, with room for groups big and small. 

Burgers  are pretty big and you can ""crunchify"" them, which means adding potato chips. I forgot to ask for my Brunch Burger (Sunnyside-up-egg, bacon, and American cheese) to be crunchified, but my friends had to smash their burgers to fit it in their mouths because the chips made it so tall. I probably would get it crunchified and just eat the chips instead of paying $4 for fries.

Both the regular and potato fries were super delicious! One of my friends got the regular & onion ring combo and it was plenty. Some yelpers are complaining that there are only 2 onion rings, but they're literally the size of my fist, so I wouldn't want more that 2! 

You can get a shake for $6 or spiked shake for $9. Only thing is that they're pretty small from what I saw, so I didn't get one. 

They also have like 6 different sauces, but NO RANCH! When we asked, they said a lot of people ask for it, so I don't know why they don't just add it in. Of their choices, I like the chipotle ketchup the best. 

Overall, I would definitely come back and probably split a burger and fries with a friend because I almost exploded after attacking one on my own.

2451040,2017-11-03,1,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"We are Bobby Flay fans so we stopped here for lunch on a Monday on our recent trip to Vegas. Sat at the bar and had excellent service from the bartender! He had recommendations, made sure we had what we needed, and we had some friendly conversation with him.

For drinks, my husband tried a local beer from Tenaya Creek, a brown ale. He enjoyed it, said it was very similar to a Newcastle. I had a cactus pear frozen margarita, which was wonderful and a fun bright pink color! They use a higher end silver tequila (Casamigos) and the drink isn't too overly sweet like many frozen margaritas can be. They have a lime flavor also, the bartender let us try a sample and it was great too, even less sweet.

The menu is made up of several burger styles (different toppings/sauces), then you choose beef, turkey, or chicken. You can also order any of the burgers ""topless"" style, which has the patty and all the toppings on top of a bed of mixed greens. They also have a few salads, some sides, and shakes on the menu. 

We started with an order of onion rings. The order had just 6 rings, but they were BIG rings, about 1.5 inches wide. Served in a tall stack, with a side of garlic & celery infused ranch to dip. The breading was light and flavorful, perfectly crispy. Yum! My husband ordered a secret menu item the bartender recommended, a beef burger ""Bobby's style"" - green chilis, a few other toppings we can't remember, and crispy potato chips on top. The patty is a mix of filet mignon & chuck. He really enjoyed the burger! I decided to try the veggie burger topless style. The patty was made up of mushrooms, chickpeas, & quinoa - it had a unique, almost nutty flavor. The smoked american cheese on top had great flavor also that worked well. The bed of mixed greens was actually full of mixed greens (not just iceberg lettuce like some restaurants serve), which I appreciated. The downside of veggie burgers is that they don't always hold together well after you start eating them, so I liked that I could get this as a salad and eat it all mixed up with a fork. Less messy for me!

Overall had a great experience here. We talked about making a second visit but weren't able to squeeze it in before we left for home. Next time! Thanks for some top quality, delicious food Bobby!",MgTtMcZ-DpAXhyvxzWDOTg,1,1,5,bovI97ifLydrG2wPNpuAFw

We split the fries, which came with a ""special sauce"", which was nothing more than a spicier McDonald's special sauce that comes on a big mac, however I ate all of it. The fries were good for what they were, I'm just not a fan of kettle cooked style fries. The ambiance of the place was alright...modern take on fast food. I guess my only complaint was the jackass who delivered the food and his piss poor attitude.

My friend really loves In-N-Out Burger, so I figured she would want to try other good burger places.
I came in here on a Tuesday in April around lunchtime before my flight back home. No line in front, didn't seem like too many customers sitting down.
I went ahead and ordered the  Classic Burger with a strawberry shake to go. They claim they have ""The World's Best Shakes"", so I had to try it out right. I requested my burger to be cooked medium rare, as I like it a bit on the tender side.
Burger came out within 10mins, and I took it back to my hotel at the Excalibur to eat in the dining area upstairs. I took a bite out of the burger and from the first bite I could tell that it didn't really meet my expectations. I guess it really isn't meant to be eaten like a regular fast food burger, but the patty was a bit charred on the outside and it was extremely salt, like it was sitting in salt water.  I didn't want to waste my money, so I did eat the whole thing. 
The shake on the other hand was pretty good. World's best shake? Probably not, but it was pretty good. I think Shake Shack's shake is a slightly better and a little bit cheaper. Why the hell are the shakes so damn expensive here? Probably because they're on the strip. I still think In-N-Out and Shake Shack have better burgers as well..
Well, sorry Bobby, but I won't be coming back by myself unless I get dragged in here by my friend.",13L_l5JE_tYqt4UpmCNm1g,1,0,3,jAMNPX3rnj3i6fud_C-Fvg

After i received my food i confronted them asking what time they closed and she once again said 11:30 and i pointed out the sign and yelp stating midnight and she decided and give me the excuse that it was weekend only but nowhere does it state that.
The following night i called and asked to speak with a manger and asked what time they closed and was told midnight, I then asked what time they closed yesterday and was told midnight and then i told her that i was told 11:30 the night before and they once again gave me the excuse that it was misunderstand like how do you get a misunderstanding when I asked what time you close and then you look at the sign and continue to tell me 11:30 and use the weekend excuse like that is no misunderstanding as well as having a second person to come out and repeat that you close at 11:30.

2647901,2015-01-02,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"First time here so here we go...

I ordered the New Mexico crunchified with half sweet potato and onion rings. I also ordered a Bud Light to wash it all down. 

The burger looked great when it arrived. I couldn't wait to dive In. However, the bun bottom was soggy and I couldn't pick it up easily.  Then I noticed the cheese melted over the bun,which further made it an issue. At this point, I would use a fork and knife, but they didn't have that. So after I had a firm grip, I took my first bite. Immediately the heat from the green chiles was noticeable. Very tasty indeed with a kick. It did have pickled onions and I really wasn't feeling that. It actually detracted from the flavor of the green chiles and everything else in the burger. 

With my half and half (sweet potato/onion rings)  I received two onion rings and the rest sweet potato fries.  It came with a honey mustard dipping sauce. The sauce was good for the fries, but not the onion rings. The second issue is no ranch for the rings. I get Bobby wants a sauce with flare, so why not chipotle ranch or jalapeño ranch.  You can't have onion rings without ranch. I even tried the chipotle ketchup, jalapeño sauce and BBQ sauce, but nothing did it for the rings. 

I was 3/4 into the burger and loving it. The last and final issue arose. Because the bottom bun was soggy, the burger just fell apart. So I ate just the patty and called it quits. I left the soggy bun behind because I wasn't going to eat greasy bread. 

All in all, the food is in the same category as Smashburger, Five Guys, Habit, In N Out.   I'm not sure if that's what Bobby intended, but that's reality. So with that, I can say I've been there, done that.  Moving on...",D20iRsFVbO8AA2TvvELaBA,0,0,4,Tgbc1VXqCHKUZCAf5PFQpw

Located right on the strip at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Bobby's is the perfect place to people watch. The menu is small and the burgers are somewhat basic. All of the burgers have the FREE option of being ""crunchified"" by topping them with crunchy plain bagged potato chips. on the side you can order Ala Cart Fries and Onion Rings. The overall price is about 25% less then the majority of other celebrity burgers on the strip.  The best part....the Burger is actually very good. I ordered the basic classic all American cheese burger with double cheese, bacon and all topped with the potato chips on a Sesame Seed bun. When my burgers were brought to the table the Bacon was missing so I let the server know. Not only did he immediately bring me the bacon for the burger but also extra bacon on the side to make up for the mistake, SCORE !  My burger was cooked just right. Medium well, moist but not pink with a nice crust and flavor that reminded me of burgers my mom would cook me in the cast Iron pan growing up.  On it I had a choice of Ketchup's and Mustard's. The Classic Hines or some that were house made. My favorite was the Jalapeno Mustard which was slightly sweet with a little heat.  I had some very good crispy fresh fries on the side that were perfect for dipping in the mustard. The onion rings were not as good, as they were a little less crunchy and a little more greasy. Next time I would do fries only. Simone had a Carolina Burger that was topped with Honey BBQ Sauce and Green Onion Mustard Slaw. She also had a perfectly cooked burger which she really enjoyed. I thought the slaw was a little overpowering with the flavors of the onion but she loved it. She also had chips on it and borrowed some of my extra bacon to put on it. So overall this is one of the better places for a burger on the strip and its much easier on the wallet then most.  I would definitely recommend Bobby's Burger Palace.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,0,0,4,WbzZs1BLlIZkYtHZg9T7Sw

My first impression walking in is the bartender, she was SO RUDE. I had asked to wash my hands in the bathroom before I placed my order, she says no that it's for customers only. I told her I am about to place my order I just need to wash my hands (it's Vegas and we all know the door handles are dirty), she says you have to buy something to get the bathroom code on your receipt and walks away. I should have just left at that point, but we decided to try it anyway since we came for the food and not alcohol. The woman who took the order was not even the slightest bit nicer, yet for some reason we stayed.
I order an LA burger, medium well, fries and a tea. We sit down to a table to wait for our food and see the tables are all cleared of dishes, but still dirty despite the place being mostly empty. I took a photo of the napkin dispenser because the whole top was so dirty that wiping it off didn't remove the dust/dirt. I expect clean from all establishments let alone one with an iron chef's name on the front. 
We waited a long time for our food especially considering the place had maybe 10 people in it, looked over to see our food sitting under the heat lamp while 5-6 employees just stood next to it chatting with the cooks. About 5 minutes passed before they brought our food over. 
The burger was both boring and had the most salty patty! Some bites were so salty they were barely edible. There is a basket of sauces on the table so I had to add some aioli to make it more flavorful, but chose carefully to pick the least salty. The burger patty was barely cooked at all so the middle was barely warm (I ordered medium well). The fries were ok, the sauce that comes with them was ok too. After all that salt I needed more tea, I looked around and I couldn't find an employee. I looked again and finally saw them all in a huddle at the back of the restaurant chatting away again. I walked over to ask if there were free refills on the tea and the girl says ""oh, yeah, sorry"" and lazily walks to the front of the restaurant to get the pitcher. Seriously!!! We left feeling upset with ourselves for choosing this place. NEVER AGAIN!

2734274,2018-04-09,14,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Bobby's Burger Palace, oh my!!

 I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay. I love his shows on food network and he knows how to cook. My favorite is beat bobby Flay where contestants compete to make dishes that will or will not beat Bobby's. 

 This restaurant is located near the veer towers and Mandarin condominiums in Las Vegas. It is outside on a side street without parking. You may park in a parking garage somewhere on the strip and walk here. You can't miss it, the sign has a colorful bright rainbow lettering. 

 The food: there are various burgers on the menu which is what this place is known for. Their burgers are unique in that, they put potato chips inside the burger. They call these burgers crunch burgers. I typically order their original crunch burger which contains: a beef patty, sesame buns, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onions and a layer of potato chips. The cheese is an American cheese; however, you may substitute the cheese for Swiss, cheddar or other types. You can also add in extra bacon, avocado or other types of toppings. I personally wouldnt want to pay extra for these. The burger is standard on the menu and is good on its own. I felt that the burger was on the greasy side. It leaked with oil as I took a couple bites. The last time I came here, the burger was less oily. There are also other salads and other various items, but I have never tried them.

 The price: the burgers are about $8-11. I found them to be moderate in price. The fries are separate and are about $5 depending on what kind you want. You can choose to have cheese on these fries or bacon bits. You may customize it to your liking but will cost quite a bit more. 

 The service: above average. I felt that the servers served the food well and the food came out in about 5-10 minutes. You are also able to see the people cooking your food. 

 The inside: it is unique. The tables are curved like a snake and the lighting is also curved. There are condiments on the tables like salt, pepper and other various sauces. There is another section where there are television sets and a bar station for alcoholic drinks. The lighting in this area is different. It is moderate to noisy during the night and there are no bathrooms available. The wifi is not free here too. Overall, my experience here was good. The burgers are pretty greasy and the fries cost extra. The prices were pretty moderate for me so if you want affordability, this place barely cuts it. Good place to take a significant other on a date? Yes, this place caters to couples. May I take my family here? Yes.",o1QAhT9-HOVzyso46he00w,30,33,4,WI5t1Uscngtpz1pgtHD3zg

Service was also good, friendly and efficient.  Eating area was funky and nicely designed.  Makes for great pics.
Why settle for mediocre Wendy or McDonald burgers when you can upscale for a couple of bucks and have a great burger.  
Yam fries were nice option also. A bit crispy on a couple of occasions but still quite a nice change from regular fries.
Note to allergy sufferers:  the buns have eggs in them although the first two times they said it was egg free.  We were suspicious as our son had a mild reaction on the first two times that we were there but didn't put two and two together as we were ""assured"" of the egg free status.   On the third occasion, the manager actually caught this and let us know that it had eggs and omitted the bun.

2835462,2015-06-18,1,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"About three weeks ago, I had two friends in town and we were all DYING to try Bobby's Burger Palace. It was 11:25pm and we were leaving MGM so I said to them- let me call and see what time they are open until. I called and a girl , who was clearly dead inside, said midnight, so I said - great! We are coming now!!! Yay!!!! And she said ""uhhuh"" and hung up.
So we made it through the seas of humans as if it were the running of the Bulls, us being the bulls, and we got there at 11:35. There was no one at the counter for five minutes, and meanwhile two more groups of people came in after us so there are about 12 people just standing and waiting. 
I finally found an employee with her back turned to me, I said ""excuse me"" 3 times until she finally turned around and I pointed to the registers and I said we've been waiting for about seven minutes and there is no one there.
She went and got someone else who finally took our orders.
I was first. I ordered two different burgers because I couldn't decide, I knew I would eat one and take one home. I ordered the Carolina burger with extra cheese (smoked american sounded really unique and delicious to me) and the girl enters in extra smoked cheddar- I asked why she did that and she said because that's what it comes with and that's what you asked for. The menus are everywhere- in giant font! I said no, it co ew with smoked American and she said no it doesn't. I said read the menu, please. She said oh. I think this was dead inside girl.
Anyway, my friends ordered along with the other two groups of people and we all sat down . There were people who had still been eating inside as well.
Everyone was served their food, but me- which, hello- I was first.
Half way through eating, all of a sudden the music was blasting so loudly that we couldn't hear each other speak, and again, Ihad to say ""excuse me"" to that same girl who doesn't like to be bothered, and my friend said- what's with the loud music? It's so rude, and she went and turned it down. 
Again, we were not the only people in there.

The next day, I called and asked for a manager. I told her what happened and she was VERY apologetic. She said that she would like to send me a gift card worth three meals. I said that I appreciate that very much and I get that stuff happens, but it's how management deals with it after, so I thanked her .

THE GIFT CARD NEVER CAME AND ITS BEEN THREE WEEKS.

Price: About $10 per burger and $5 per order of fries. ADD an extra patty for $4.

Food: 
First of all, I have to note that the patties are thick and juicy which also makes them filling. I ended up sharing the New Mexico adding an extra patty and an order of fries. It was the perfect amount. The New Mexico burger was good, but it did not have any heat to it.. which was disappointing as it was the only burger on the menu that promises heat.
TIP: Don't forget to ask for crunch!
 
Drinks: full bar!

Service: Good. Fast and friendly! Fast food style.
Honestly, this place has pretty dope burgers and a good selection of sauces but what makes this place :( is no spice or hot sauce at all!",JSJSk90GRUeqBdQxzQ3jUg,1,1,4,37cgXnTWeJ-9vVhHUfFRUQ

Almost four years later me and my friends stopped in to grab burgers. The burgers or burger I ordered tasted ten times better than the last, somewhat making me eat my words. That tends to happen sometimes haha. 

The Louisiana is the burger I chose. We ordered at the register then grabbed seats at the bar for a round of beers. James was the bartender who took care of us that night. Really cool guy with good knowledge of the beers on tap. He poured me up a Sculpin stating you're not going to find this anywhere on tap at this price. After thinking about it for a few seconds I agreed. I wasn't going to get a Sculpin on tap anywhere under $5, nowhere I knew of at least. Shortly after joking it up with James, the food arrived. 

In contrast to the last burger I had here, this one was juicy and its patty well seasoned. The pepper jack was nicely melted, the slice of tasso ham on top of the patty was crispy and the burger was completely sauced up with both spicy remoulade & red hot sauce adding more flavor to the meats. 

This was a huge improvement in taste and quality. Sadly it was a burger of the month, not one of the permanents on the menu. Sucks because it was delicious. Me joking with James I told him about my experience with the New Mexico burger and stated Bobby Flay should toss that one and put the Louisiana in it's place. Jame's response...""hey hey, don't you go knocking the New Mexico. What kind of a mad man are you?"" My response...""ok ok, maybe I'm being too harsh on that state. I'll give them a chance for redemption next time"" haha. Mentioning it again, James was cool and offered some good laughs. You have to have heard it in the tone he used upon saying it which made it hilarious. 

I plan to give the New Mexico another shot just to be sure. However I am looking forward to another burger of the month. Hopefully any burger I order in the future (burger of the month or permanent) will be as enjoyable as this one.

We have Burger Bar, Strip Burger, KGB's, BURGR, and many more I haven't mentioned. All of them have a good quality burger, and everyone has their favorite. 
I am happy to say the Burger Palace can easily be added to this list! 
Decisions are the hardest on a first visit. We went with the Brunch burger and Philly burger both crunchified. (Added homemade potato chips). A fries, and onion rings, and a pistachio shake. 
The shake was delicious and I will come back for that alone. 
I like my burgers well done, and I like when a place successfully still makes a juicy well done burger. I'd say this needed about 2 minutes less cook to be perfect but it still was good. The sauces on the table were great, but the real winner is the honey mustard horseradish that you have to ask for. 
All the ingredients on the burgers were fresh, and you could tell. The cheese was high quality and melted off the sides of the burger. 
I ate every bite, and was perfectly full. 
Also, they give you a points card, where every dollar spent is a point and at $100, you get a free burger. We spent $40 so within a 3rd visit you will earn that burger. It is free, so definitely worth it. 
Can't wait for a second visit, and this I would choose this place over at least half of the other burger joints in this city. Great food, service, and prices!",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,8,7,4,SMBVne5Hu2t1Xs5dN2S4hg

Hat's off to Mr Flay!  Mind you the prices were on average $2.21 more than what the email menu I received from Bobby's news letter was but at $9 per burger that is still cheap in Vegas terms :)

The location is mid sized but makes good use of space with cool cafeteria style bench seating.  There is probably room for around 100 people or so.  The ordering system is cafeteria style as well, ordering at the register and then having your food brought out to you.

The menu is fairly basic other than the 5 or six gourmet burgers offered.  I think there was a grilled cheese on the menu, sweet potato fries, regular fries, onion rings, milk shakes and frozen alcoholic drinks as well.

We sampled the following:

La Burger: about a 1/3 pound super juicy burger served with your choice of cheese and a avocado relish.  The burger was tasty and filling $9.00.

Crunch Burger: a cheese burger served with potato chips inside. My daughter loved this burger saying it was one of the best she has ever had.  You can ""crunchify"" any burger for a small charge.  $8.50

Dallas Burger: a cheese burger served with coleslaw and bbq sauce.  Juicy tender and cooked to perfection this was a good burger $9.00

Onion Rings: super wide cut onion rings in a light batter.  The rings were very juicy when you bit into them but didn't come with any special dipping sauce and could have used more seasoning in the batter $4.00

Sweet Potato Fries: a large portion of tasty fries served with a honey mustard dipping sauce, could have been crispier but they were good $4.00

Dark Chocolate Milk Shake: a thick tasty shake, but not worth $6.50

Overall we really enjoyed this place.  The burgers are not the best on the strip but they are certainly the most affordable gourmet burger on the strip.

I ordered it without onions and medium, which came out perfectly. Service was attentive at the register and the food came quickly once I had found a place to sit.

I'm a fan of putting my own condiments on my food since I don't like when things are over-sauced, so the condiment carousels on the tables are awesome for me. I was able to put just the amount of ketchup and mustard on the burger that I wanted.

Extra points for the sesame seed bun. I've heard Bobby Flay talk about this on his shows and how the seeds add something extra to the burger, and I definitely agree!

Great taste and great experience. One of the few places it seems where you can get a decently sized meal (i.e. not giant) and for a decent price. Next time I will try some fries on the side.",tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,2,0,5,5tFUPAJL-j6OWfrDnrdZeQ
3051264,2015-06-15,4,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"We needed a break from hotel catering food or pricy foods in the hotel restaurant. I actually really wanted In n Out burger that was only about a half a mile walk; however, I guess it was in the sketchy area and it was too hot to walk. Bobby's Burger Palace was next door to the Aria, and it became more attractive by the minute since it was close and I have never tried it before.

There was a time when I thought Bobby Flay was pretty flay for a white guy. Then, he got on TV way too much and exchanging toothy smiles with Giada and divorced my fave prosecutor Alex Cabot aka Stephanie March. Not flay. Not flay at all.

However, the burger palace was aaight! First off, looking at all the prices of the burger at $9.50, it was very refreshing. They could just put one price on the top that all burgers are $9.50 instead of listing the same price on each burger. It's pricy for burger but it's Bobby Flay right? Plus, around here, it was a bargain. It's probably the only thing under $10!

My business associates were buying lunch though I insisted on buying. Now, the price got even better for me. I was sick of red meat so instead of getting half a burger, I actually tried the turkey burger LA style or California style. I forgot truly but it was that type of style with avocado, tomatoes, etc. It sounded light for a burger; thus, it sounded good to me. My two colleagues got the brunch one and the blue burger.

We ordered upfront and it was awesome that you could order beer if you wanted to. We were eating during work so we couldn't drink but that was great that we had the option. Oh, they also had Fanta ginger ale on the soda machine. Nice!! 

The ambience was slick and modern, with communal table. Though I have never been a fan of communal table, this one was okay as it was pretty spread out and spacious. The tables had a meandering type of design to it with a good flow and not just a big rectangular picnic table type.

The order was done pretty quick and soon we got our burgers. The sides were huge so I would recommend sharing. The two guys I were with couldn't finish theirs and we actually gave one untouched onion ring order to people who sat next to us. Oh, communal eating...

My burger was tasty and juicy and it was quite flay for a white turkey burger. I loved it though the bun actually didn't look so appetizing. It was pale like Bobby and if it had hair, it would have been red. I prefer those golden glistening with butter toasted brioche or potato buns. This sesame topped bun tasted good but looked just okay. My colleague devoured his brunch burger and didn't say much except mhmh. Jerry, my other colleague, was a hard nut to crack and he said he liked this better than In n Out. He went there yesterday without asking me and he said he preferred Bobby's any day. Whoaa I was surprised but they were kind of different burgers. Jerry's burger came raw and blood was dripping all over though he ordered medium well. He wasn't pleased but he just ate it and he still said it was awesome.

The sweet potato fries were really really good as well as the onion rings. The malt looked good as well. I wish I ordered some but that would put me to sleep during workshops in the afternoon.

Not bad, Bobby. I guess I wouldn't ask for a throw down or try to beat Bobby Flay, unless it is with a paddle.",UrOofvcBl0gAbKPAEaj83A,3,5,4,dMQX7GVAgLgOSrIA5do4jw

Yes that's just something on the burger along with the other condiments. So sit back and let the burger tantalize your pallet and senses.  While in Las Vegas my wife and I decided to do a burger tour.  Bobby's was just on of the stops we made and it was well worth the walk to this restaurant.  After a horrible visit to Guy Fieri's burger joint (see my review there, not good) we almost didn't go to another celebrity restaurant.  Good thing we decided to check out the Burger Palace.  The onion rings...well they were special with a lite coating of flour and rice flour made the crust very light yet the  onions were completely cooked; a perfect combination.  Usually union rings have a very heavy and thick crust and when you bite it the onion slips out of the crust because the onion is not cooked.  Not these onion rings.  The pair of the burger and the rings is one of the best we've had.

The burger, one of my top favorites, is one I would recommend and I will visit again when we are in Las Vegas again.  The milieu was upbeat modern and welcoming with the windows facing the Strip, perfect for people watching and who doesn't like that.  This was a relaxing place to enjoy a great burger, a tall soda and people watching.

2) Philly Burger, crunchified $10.25 - this was great; packed with flavor and they layered on the chips super high. I had to remove the chips and just eat them separately since you cannot possibly get your mouth around the burger at all

3109018,2016-07-21,25,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"This was my first time eating at a Bobby Flay restaurant, and I'm glad we decided to go the casual route as opposed to something more upscale like Mesa Grill. 

We could tell from Yelp pictures that the seating is communal (a severe anxiety for my introverted husband), so we made sure to be here when they opened which worked out tremendously as we had nearly a whole seating area to ourselves. 

You order at the counter and it was by far the cheapest meal we had during our trip. For two giant burgers, a side order of fries/rings, a margarita, and a fountain drink, the total came to a little more than $40.  

A friendly server came by to explain the table sauces and brought our food out about 10 or so minutes later. The sauce I remember most was the chipotle ketchup because it was AMAZING! I would put that on just about anything. 

My husband had the cactus pear margarita which I took a sip of and thought was just okay. The color was beautiful but it had an odd chalky taste. Everything else about the meal however was perfection. 

He ordered the Dallas burger medium while I had the LA burger medium well without tomatoes. The LA burger has a delicious avocado relish, watercress, and cheddar cheese. We both made sure to get our burgers crunchified which is their signature style of simply putting potato chips on top. It adds great texture and kick of salt to each bite. How did I never think to add potato chips to my burgers before? Genius. And the best part is it's free of charge!

The sides here are generous so one will be enough for two to share. We wanted both fries and rings so the indecision was great. They served them with chipotle mayo and garlic ranch dipping sauces that were both divine.

This completely lived up to the celebrity chef hype for me. We splurged on other meals while in town that paled in comparison to the overall dining experience we had here (both in terms of price and food). Awesome place and I will 100% be back again next time Vegas and I cross paths. I really want to try one of those incredible looking shakes too. 

Side note- Be sure to ask the cashier for the code to the bathroom if needed. They are for customers only and the door won't open without keying it in.",niTdjI2tBGiZJLhNWtyqdw,34,34,5,GvMbwkfuOQgJM-XiqyBgqA

I also ordered a shake and it kick butt however the onion rings were like onion rings that had been served and were not eaten so they battered then and fried them again.

The place is currently under some type of renovation with yellow tape roping a lot of the dining area off but there was plenty of room and the burger and fries were edible.

Burgers were cooked perfectly, were juicy and the toppings were just the right mix...crunchy, gooey, savory and sweet.

the Philly burger - with hot peppers, provolone, and grilled onions - was excellent. a hefty size and wonderfully juicy. try the sauces on the table. hell, try them all! a sweet jalapeno sauce, a smoky chipotle sauce, the burger sauce, ketchup, and mustard. chipotle was my favorite.

3167908,2014-02-24,1,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Surprise, surprise! Bobby's Burger Palace is serving up delicious burgers, on the strip, and not charging crazy high prices! Is this real life?

While they may be going for the ""gourmet"" burger category, it isn't quite like any other gourmet burger spot on the strip. When you walk in, there's a huge menu on the wall and a counter to order at. Unlike a lot of other spots that are full service, at BBP, you just order and they bring it out to you.

There are several options on the menu for burgers. If you're not the burger type though, you can order any burger style but swap out for a different protein. Alongside the certified angus beef, they offer ground turkey and whole chicken breast. The rest of the menu features sides, salads, sandwiches and beverages. Since they're on the strip, they're also serving up beer and spiked milkshakes.

I decided on the Crunchburger, a simple burger with double American cheese and topped with potato chips. I've gotten in the habit of trying just the meat every time I get a burger somewhere and BBP's was great. The meat was tender and seasoned very well. It seems like they are a little heavy on the pepper but I actually enjoyed it like that. I wasn't a huge fan of the bun though as it was a bit dry. Altogether it was a great burger but I'd like to see them use house made chips to top it. I could be wrong but they sure tasted just like plain ole Lays. It also needed a sauce but luckily each table has a few to choose from and their jalapeno hot sauce really set the flavor off.

We also ordered The Half & Half sides with fries and onion rings. The fries are delicious. They actually fry them a bit on the harder side so they are a nice, crispy brown on the outside but still soft inside. I'd like them to be a bit saltier but they are served with a really tasty fry sauce anyway. It's a mayo based sauce with red pepper that is creamy with a very slight bit of kick. I think it would actually be really good on a burger.

One of my favorite parts about BBP was several little signs they have up front indicating how they cook their burgers. I ordered mine medium, my wife ordered hers well done...they cooked them right and exactly how it says on those signs. To me, that's a great thing, it saves a lot of headache, and possible stomach aches. And even though they aren't full service, everyone was very nice and happy to get anything you need or answer any questions. To top it, we walked out of there for under $30.

Visited this place on a saturday afternoon and there was a short line, overall not too packed.

Menu is very easy to maneuver, on the wall to your left are all the options. You can also view the menu online and order ahead online.

I ordered the Crunch Burger, Brunch Burger, and Fries. The total was about $26 which is pricey for just burgers and fries BUT the quality was superb.

Although it may be pricey the quality is higher than average and I think it is worth it for the price. Burgers come with half a pickle to munch on. Beef patty is thick and juicy. Definitely good quality beef. Sesame seed buns which I think would be better if toasted, but good.

Crunch burger was very good. I don't like too much veggies in my burger so I love how they had this option which is plain with meat, sauce, and potato chips.

Brunch burger had a fried egg which cooked well. Not super runny. 

Fries were ok, too greasy for my liking. I feel like it depends on the batch as well because ours might have been the last of the batch that's why it might have been more oily and crunchy.

At the time we placed our order the line was out the door with 15 people behind us. Great idea of having separate lines for ordering in dining and take out. It definably reduced the overall wait time.

My choice was the Vegas Beef Burger cooked medium rare. My wife's choice the Classic Beef Burger cooked well done. We also shared an order of Onion Rings. The onion rings have a nice texture and are cooked perfectly. One order is enough for 2 people 
Bobby has the bases covered. You can order your sandwich with beef, turkey or chicken. You receive a number when ordering then choose a location to sit. The food will be delivered to your table.
Wait time was acceptable and the wait staff explained the sauces available on the table. During our meal a server stopped by and asked if everything was OK and if we needed anything else.

Both burgers were cooked just as ordered. The Vegas Burger has cheese, BBQ potato chips and red chilis on the sandwich. The chips add a nice crunch and are a nice twist. The Classic comes with lettuce, tomato, cheese and sliced red onion. Also the burgers are served with a nice crisp pickle.

The restaurants décor is bright and colorful. The seating arrangements are good for groups as well as individuals. The wait staff continues to make the rounds to remove the plates a clean the tables.

I was surprised at how casual it was and that it was not full service. That's fine, though. I told the nice lady at the register that it was my first and, in all likelihood, only time I would ever visit (I don't get to Vegas often). With that in mind, what should I not miss? She set me up with the Brunch burger, fries and a banana and Nutella malt.

I knew things would go my way when I sat at the table to find a carousel of sauces. I'm a sauce kind of guy. There was ketchup and mustard (nothing special) but also a jalapeño hot sauce which had a nice tang to it, a smokey chipotle ketchup (my favorite of the bunch), and a curiously named ""burger sauce"" which was peppery and sweet like molasses.

The burger arrived stacked high with a perfectly medium and juicy patty, quality bacon, a fried egg whose runny yoke was beginning to fill the bottom of the plate, gobs of American cheese, and potato chips. At first I was disappointed to find that the chips were simple bagged style but as I started into the burger, I changed my mind. Kettle style chips would be too much. These provided just enough crunch and salt to really compliment the egg. The pickle that accompanied the burger was thick, cool and crunchy. A welcome addition.

You guys. This is the best burger I have ever had. Seriously. The only thing that could (and did) make it better was a squirt of chipotle ketchup on every other bite.

The fries were equally impressive. I really got the feeling that some care and culinary science went into the preparation of these. They were flavorful. Crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. With just the right amount of salt.

The shake did not disappoint either, though I felt pretty guilty after crushing the meal and chasing it with such a heavy desert.

I know I said I would probably not be back. But I've got a few more days here. I might make a point to return.

Job freaking well done!",wUOqa62hLf1hMxchuS_BtA,1,0,5,6ucw08rZHPBZKoXwGVjChg

3257239,2014-09-04,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Overall, BBP offers extremely tasty food at a reasonable price. The wonderful food, ambiance, and wide variety of burgers leaves me wanting to come back. 

Price - $9.50 for all burger styles and no extra cost for turkey burger or chicken breast and you can get the burger ""crunchified"" for no extra cost. The shakes are pricier at $6.50 and seemed slightly smaller than normal shake sizes. Sweet potato fries are $4, but feed two people. We got 2 burgers, 2 shakes, and 1 fry for $38, plus a small optional tip at the counter and table. 

Food - BBP offers a wide variety of burger options. The two we tried (Carolina and the classic) were amazing. What was most notable was how ideally cooked they were. They allow you to select from rare to well done. The sesame buns held the burgers and toppings together making it very easy to eat without the loss of any toppings. The  shakes were some of the most flavorful we've had. It is apparent that BBP is using the $6.50 to invest in quality ingredients and not skimping on them. Our coconut shake and pistachio malt were achievements in subtlety and over the top flavor, respectively. You could chew the flakes of coconut...mmmm. The sweet potato fries served two people and came with horseradish based dipping sauces. The fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and had flakes of mild salt coating them. 

Ambiance - There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor dining area is large and very modern and funky. There is S-shaped counter-style seating that zig zags across one side of the room. You can see through a wide openings to where they are preparing the good. The vibe is casual, but is fun to look. 

Service - The service was efficient and friendly. The person who took our order at the counter made sure to guide us through our order and offered complementary water cups. The food was brought to us quite quickly. For being informal, fast-service dining, the service was very attentive checking in on us and the food.

It's clear that the sincerity of this place goes far beyond slapping a celebrity chef's name on the shingle.",UjOj9iuALjeYCpTQxOYANQ,0,0,4,SsUHvdmcgy4g_IUhNAhnVQ

Not really enough french fry sauce to dip in.

Ate here recently while on vacay in Vegas. I ordered my burger medium. My husbands was perfectly cooked but mine was very rare and undercooked. 

It was hard to catch a waiters eye to request my burger be cooked further. When I finally spoke to someone, I got a very strange reaction. He seemed annoyed by my request and did not respond but appeared to walk towards the kitchen and I think he asked them to make me a fresh one which they eventually did. I was waiting a while to get it and I wasn't sure what was happening. I asked the same server if a burger was coming. It took about 15-20 minutes for another burger to arrive. I felt awkward and left in the dark due to the fact the server never told me what exactly was going on.

3469120,2014-06-10,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Bobby's is by far our favorite burger place in town. You order in a fast food style where they take your order, give you a number, grab your drink and grab a seat. The seating is kind of weird where it's a whole table wrapped around with a bunch of chairs so you MIGHT end up sitting with someone else, but hey, maybe you can make some friends! :)

We have never had to wait in line a long time to put our order, even if there are several people ahead of us. They're usually pretty quick to get everyone through the line. The wait time for the food to come out is pretty standard, but we like to sit by the window and watch the people walking the strip so it makes the time go by quicker.

My husband and I usually both get the LA Burger and it is fantastic! So juicy and full of flavor. We have been there 5-6 times and the burger has always been the same quality. 

The fries are awesome too (haven't tried the onion rings yet) and the fry sauce is really good. Usually fry sauce is just a mix of ketchup and mayo but this is so much more and has a little kick to it. We also tried a coconut shake once and it was filled with flavor and even had little flecks of coconut in it.

This is a fabulous place to eat. The staff is friendly and the food is definitely worth the price. I would suggest looking on the website first to see the hamburgers, some of them are a little different than normal hamburgers.",SaFe2sl7E_xhAn2z0kZT9A,0,0,5,G-56ECpUq_qgigGacrJjfQ

I ate at the Las Vegas Location on May 25th, 2016......a major insult to the Palate. The table talker stated that each cook is trained to make a   burger EXACTLY the way Bobby Flay would make it.

Shame on Bobby, and Shame on the food industry for supporting this assault (or a salt) on the senses.

As you enter, all their burgers are listed... the only one I remember is the one I got, which was the Crunch burger. It consisted of burger, cheese, potato chips, and from what I remember, I requested red onion, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise. We also ordered a side, ""half & half."" Half fries, half onion rings. 
We sat ourselves in a huge cafeteria like setting. Bright green and all... there were a variety of sauces at the table. From bbq sauce to a jalapeño sauce.... 
It did not take too long to cook, it was out in less than 10 minutes. The burger looked great. Potato chips stacked high, cheese melted to the burger patty, lettuce, beautiful red tomato and red onion. The mayonnaise was on the side. The half & half came with only 2 onion rings and a hefty amount of fries- I would hardly call that half. 
My first bite into the burger, I noticed how juicy the meat was, as well as how salty. It was very salty for me. I took one more bite, and still the same. So I flagged down the girl who brought out our food and told her it was too salty for me. She informed me that, ""that is the Bobby Flay way"" and that they could remake it without the added salt. Which made me feel WONDERFUL! 
While they did that, I asked for ranch for my uneven ""half & half."" 
Bobby Flay doesn't believe in RANCH?

Sad.

The 2 onion rings I got tasted good... the fries were pretty good too (but to pay a $1 more for half onion rings & half fries was not worth what I got.)

My new burger was out in less than 5 min. Looked as good as the one before. I mayo'd it up and bit in. Soooo much better! Still tasted the salty flavor from the grill, which was ok enough for me. 

The staff did a great job. The burger was great-without the added salt, and I think it was a delicious and unique take on the potato chip burger.",W0I0kYa9-qAvWJW92CjObg,4,3,4,ijR3b3_d4WdNycie7F_BGA

My friend & I were in Vegas for the weekend.  We had plans Sunday night, but of course we wanted to grab a bite to eat first. We didn't have a ton of time, and since we were staying near Bobby's and Yelp reviews were pretty good, we decided to try it out.

We walked in and the line wasn't too long. It was a little slow, but I was being indecisive on what I wanted anyway, so this gave me a little time to figure out what I wanted.  The burgers are on the gourmet (if you will) side (though you can get something more simple, I'm sure).  I opted for the Bobby Blue -- blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, & tomato -- crunchified (with potato chips on it).  I always order sweet potatoes when they're an option, so that was my side.  I wanted to try a spiked milkshake but didn't; maybe next time!

After ordering, you take your number and can pick your own seat (They do have carryout as well.).  The decor is clean and bright; I really enjoyed the look of the place.

This place is not in a casino or hotel so the prices are not super inflated.  We ordered the onion rings 4.25, Dallas burger 9.5, Palace burger 9.5r and a soda.   The batter to onion ratio was good.  The onion rings were thickly cut with a fried chicken coating.  This might sound good but consider that chicken is bland and needs a flavorful coating.  A cooked onion is sweet and only needs a subtle flavor to complement it.  The fried chicken batter totally overwhelmed the onion.  The accompanying sauces were all too salty except for regular ketchup.  Onion rings typically go well with ranch. Consider it Chef Bobby. 

The burgers were way to salty.  One was inedible.  I looked into the kitchen area to see what they were doing and saw them streaming salt from a shaker onto the flat top.   There was more salt coming down than what usually goes on a batch of fries.  Note that a batch of fries serves dozens.   Each burger only needs a pinch of salt.

you order first and find a seat. the food will be brought out to you. you get to choose between three types of meat (beef, chicken & turkey)

ordered:
*bacon crunch burger $9.95 w/beef - provided very little potato chips inside. it did not look anything like the advertised photos. 
*brunch $10.95 w/beef

the burgers were overly cooked and dry. lacked flavor, you would think that if bobby flay has his name on something then the food must at least be flavorful. presentation wise the burgers looked like i made it at home with no culinary experience. 

the inside was a bit dirty like they had a crazy rush and not enough staff to clean the place. when i arrived they had customers but i wouldn't say they were packed. they needed more staff around to clean the place up for sure. food took a hot minute to arrive. would this yelper return to BBP? sadly, nope! i was so disappointed at my experience that, my calories and hard earned money will be dining elsewhere. BBP is definitely a tourist trap. 

tips:
*restroom available
*high chair available
*free refills as its fountain drinks
*cash and credit card accepted
*indoor seating only

This bacon has been breaded in something mystical, to create a cohesive taste experience that you have never before felt. Then resting on top of that bacon is onion strips that sting your mouth like a biting Python. Then drizzled on top of that beauty is a barbecue sauce. This is a slightly above average barbecue sauce but when you add the burger sauce on it, it turns into a sauce that makes you smile with glee as it coats the inside of your mouth.

The regular fries were alright, but got soggy pretty fast. The sweet potato fries were great though! Both fry sauces were good too. 

Compared to Gordon Ramsey's Burger, Bobby's Burger Palace totally blows it out of the water. The prices are better and the quality of the food is the same, if not better. We definitely liked Bobby's a lot and can't wait to come back!",nXXoCiolNhtShV-Caj8g4g,0,0,5,tzbins8rw7MGWnqGvVYO7g

Burger was yummy. Loved the ""Avocado Relish""! I was satisfied for sure, but definitely nothing to write home about. I wouldn't dream about or crave for this burger. 

The onion rings get two thumbs down! NO flavor at all and cut WAY too big for my liking. (Holsteins has the BEST, hands down!)

Cons: It can be a little pricey for a burger and side but I think it's worth it.

I came here yesterday, Monday 5/25/15, with my boyfriend for a quick lunch. This is my second time at Bobby's Burger Palace (the first time was last August, while we were pretty buzzed and wandering the strip for a place to eat... stumbled upon Bobby's due to the nice big sign and bright enticing lights inside). Upon arriving (sober this time, by the way) it was a very short wait and we were able to decide on our orders before the people in front of us were done. Their menu is blown up and displayed on the wall so you can conveniently choose a meal -- divided by burgers, sides and drinks, nice and simple. I ordered the Brunch which consisted of a fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I chose certified angus beef as my protein (there's also ground turkey and chicken breast). I also got a half and half side -- fries and onion rings. We sat at these cool curvy diner type tables next to another couple. It took maybe 10 minutes for our food to arrive. You can watch the cooks through an opening between the kitchen and dining area. I knew which burger was mine as soon as the cook placed it on the counter. They have different sauces at the table that you can try. I tried them all on my fries and really liked the jalapeño sauce. The burger was cooked medium well, just like I like it. My boyfriend and I each got our own sides but decided in the end we could've shared one because they're pretty big (I took our left over fries and snacked on them at the penny slots).

The fries are really nothing special, I was hoping for better since the seasoned fries at lunch at Bobby's Mesa Grill in Caesars are so good. These taste like every typical hot dog stand.

The shakes are good and thick as well. We feel like the prices are slightly overpriced for what you get, and the fast casual atmosphere. But its Vegas, EVERYTHING is expensive!

3946420,2014-11-21,2,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"I had the Crunchburger and fries. It was basically a cheeseburger with potato chips. No lettuce, onion, or tomato. In fact, you add the condiments yourself so I guess it's similar to Fuddruckers in that respect. 

Let's start with the good. I thought despite the simplicity the burger tasted alright. The beef was on par with the patties at The Habit which is OK. It came with two slices of American cheese. I know some folks frown on that but I like American. It melts and engulfs the burger which I dig. The fries are good. They are like bigger cut versions of In n Out fries I suppose. 

Now the bad. A tad overpriced. Almost $9 for the burger, $4 for fries, and $3.50 for lemonade. As a guy that has paid upwards of $13 for a burger at Umami and BURGR I'm not against paying a premium for a hamburger, but I do expect premium ingredients if I'm going to do so. How about some grilled onions or some fancy sauce that'll knock my socks off? I'm not asking for 100% Prime Minotaur beef or anything just something other than potato chips to make the food stand out.

If the food was priced lower like say, The Habit then I would have given a 4 star rating for sure. I realize that celebrity branding is a reason for the high price but that also means high expectations from the consumer. 

Overall I'd be willing to give BBP another shot since they have lots of other burgers. Plus it's fun to sit there to eat and people watch. Go with a friend and watch dudes walk by with a girl and try to guess girlfriend or prostitute.",vCqHamH09P2I9OcDaYW0Tg,0,0,3,6VBT2oh1KS-C9cHjdYgiHg

For a restaurant on the strip just ending lunch, there was NO ONE in there. Should have been a warning sign for me.

I got the Philly Burger, the concept wasn't bad. But this is where my issues start. I ordered the burger, medium rare. When I got the burger it was closer to well. I also ordered it ""crunchified"" but there were no chips in my burger. The onions were cut too larger and when I bit into the burger, the whole onion came out. The bun didn't taste as fresh and the burger was just, meh. Biting into the burger the bun was a little hard and broke apart and the burger fell apart when I ate it. I ordered onion rings, which tasted pretty good, but they were HUGE! like way to big, it was like eating half a whole onion. I only got like 4-5 pieces. 
I did like the chipotle ketchup, it complemented my burger, since there was no sauce in my burger. I got my burger to go, so I didn't see any of these things until I got back to my hotel.

4018461,2017-05-14,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"The food is delicious as one would expect from a restaurant named after Bobby Flay. I expected superior service also but after 2 visits that has not been the case on either one. In fact it has been just so so both times. 

The ordering process here is simply way too slow and needs to either be redesigned or a manager needs to step up and hire and train enough people to handle the volume of business that comes with the name. My guess is that there is some type of licensing arrangement because I can't imagine Bobby Flay being a part of anything so off the mark. 
Today, on a Saturday afternoon, they were out of Coke at the self serve fountain machine. That of itself shows poor management. When I pointed out the problem to a bartender after pouring and drinking the distasteful remains of the coke she told me they were out of Coke. And then did nothing to let customers know about the lack of this core beverage either at the fountain machine or the ordering counter. This clearly demonstrates a lack of interest in the guest's dining experience. I might expect this at a fast food burger joint but not at a high end palace like this. 
To be clear and fair, every employee was polite and friendly. The crunchburger and fries were so superb that I will no doubt be back to give it another try. It just feels like this is a ship without a captain bobbing around aimlessly, not a burger palace operated by a world renowned chef like Bobby Flay. 
UPDATE: I came back for the crunchburger and fries and was not disappointed as both were superb. The service was the same as on previous visits. They do have some nice workers and some of them seem to care. But it takes way to long to place and pay for an order, ridiculously slow process that could be fixed overnight. 
Today I saw something that I still have trouble believing or understanding. While I ate my meal the bartender also ate a meal, while on duty behind the bar, in plain site if everyone. This is very unprofessional and probably prohibited by health department regulations, plus just a little bit disgusting.

While having two lines for eating in and take out is great.. if you are not manning the ""take-out"" line... you better have some kind of signage that points that out to people!

Starting off 5 minutes later.. we ordered, I went with the original crunch burger, and the girlfriend opted for a more ""spicy"" option of the Vegas burger (when in Rome right?)

We took our seat and enjoyed a bit of some great music, and the food arrived in a suitable amount of time.

Not incredibly impressive for what we paid (almost 30 dollars).. my burger was a lame little burger with plain potato chips on it. I know.. Bobby Flay tries to paint it as more.. but it's not much else. The giant pickle is the most impressive part of it.

The girlfriends was much of the same.. a pathetic little burger with a stack of BBQ chips on top... 

It was an interesting concept.. but really I feel like I could do it myself like that for much less, and might even taste better. My burger was just an unseasoned beef patty, and the chips just overpowered anything else with the amount of salt on them. Just meh.

My girlfriend, a couple of bites in.. started to complain about the heat of the burger (spiciness)... and took the Fresno red chilies.. which (and I love heat) were uncomfortably hot. It hurt somewhat to chomp them down for her.. but we did finish them off.

Came here with my family and we all ordered different burgers and they were all delicious. I love how they were named after cities/states. 

You can choose how rare you want your patty and they actually serve it to you that way! I'm so used to having over done burgers. I prefer mine medium rare and I always get close to well done.

I order the Miami (pressed with ham, swiss, pickles, mayo, mustard) and it was the juiciest burger I've ever had.

They give you the half/half option when it comes to sides. But the portions for fries/etc are a bit small. There is also a variety of sauces on the table, all yum!

My sister ordered the pistachio milkshake, because we love pistachio anything, and it was great. Not overly sweet and just the right consistancy.

The decor was very modern and had that southwest tex mex feel that attains to Bobby's cooking style. Fast food feel, where you order up front, but they bring your food to you.

I was instantly impressed with the layout of this joint. The tables were in a semi ""S"" shaped style, which made for interesting dining. The tables were large and held about 10 people. The entire setup of the restaurant was fun and creative. No one walked away from our table a stranger. 

The line was long but went quickly. We waited less than 5 minutes from the time we walked in until the time we placed our order. I approached the cashier knowing exactly what I wanted. I was quick to order and to pay. 

The Bill: $22.16.....ehhh

The Brunch Burger - certified Angus beef, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I like my meat a little pink to keep the flavor so I ordered medium. The burger was nicely cooked but on your typical sesame seed bun. The egg and bacon was amazing, really who could argue with a fried egg and smoked bacon?? The burger was good but not the best burger I've ever had.  Not sure it was worth the $9.50, but I knew walking in I was paying for the name behind the burger. 

The Half and Half - you can order one side for $4 each or combine 2 sides for $5. You have the option to get french fries, sweet potato fries or beer battered onion rings. I decided to go for the the regular fries, with the all amazing BBP Fry Sauce and the Beer Battered Onion Rings. The fries were tasty, crisp and all around the perfect fries. No complaints. I was a little disappointed to only see 2 onion rings come with the half and half. I mean really, those rings were perfect and you're going to tease me with only 2? 

Beer - Miller Lite. Yes, BBP has its own decent selection of beers, drinks, wines spiked milkshakes and margaritas, I stuck to my roots and went with a Miller Lite. After all, they didn't have PBR. 

Overall, the food was good but nothing about it stood out to make my mouth water as I write my review. The staff checked on us regularly and even made sure we all had beers when we were getting low.

Such a disappointment considering it is Bobby Flay's restaurant.  Long version: Not impressed!  Everything is ala carte.  The cheapest burger is $8.50. This is the cheeseburger with lays potato chips on it.  I had that and added lettuce (no extra charge).  I ordered the mixed regular fries and onion rings $5 ($1 extra), black and white malt with double malt $6.50(no extra), a soda $2.50.  My husband got the regular cheese burger $9.50 (go figure, it was $1 more than the chip burger).  It was supposed to have lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle.  First the malt came out.  It looked like chocolate milk with some ice crystals in it.  I flagged down the girl that took our order (she was cleaning tables in her down time from taking orders).  I asked her if that is how the malt was supposed to look.  She frowned at it and said ""no"" and said she knew what I was looking for and would make sure it was right. She took it and came back little later with another one that was slightly thicker, but still far too running to call a malt.  So I explained how thick I thought the malt would be and she agreed and said it was the double malt that was causing the problem.  She brought another.  It was a little thicker, but more of a thin shake than a malt.  I gave up and just kept it.  Then my burger, fries, and 2 onion rings (yes I said 2 onion rings) cames out (my husband's did not).  Maybe 5-7 mins later, his burger came.  They brought him the same chip burger that they brought me!  At this point, we weren't sending it back.  The burgers didn't have condiments on them and it didn't taste like they had any seasoning on them.  On the table is there their signature burger sauce, Chipotle ketchup, mustard, and regular ketchup.  The burger sauce was EXTREMELY salty and the Chipotle ketchup was vinegary (I know, I just made that word up).  I didn't like the fries, but my husband said they were ok. The 2 onion rings were good.

The burger, although salty as fuck, had a pink middle and a bit of a char for a properly cooked medium slab of meat. 

The American burger was the same thing minus all of the flair. Salty. Just another hunk of meat between some bread for $10 bucks.

The fries were okay but a little, you guessed it, salty.

The burger was the star of this show.  Although I ordered mid well, the burger still came out juicy.  All the toppings and the sauce came together really well.  It remind me of a burger you would make in your back yard.  (Opposite of what I had at Gordon Ramsay BurGR).  Negatives?  It needed a pinch more salt and it was on the small side.  

The fries on the other hand were terrible.  1/2 the fries were old and grease filled.  They were most likely reheated old fries.  

So would I return?  Maybe if a friend wanted to try.  But if it were just me, there are many other burger places to try in Vegas.  Sorry Bobby, you lost this showdown.",4shObKx859r99ypXbdEVyQ,0,0,3,EP3M0CGAmk7ZpMnaQBOBYQ

I got the lemonade, you get a tiny cup and free refills, but you have to find someone to fill it for you. Mildly awkward when it is slow in there, I can't imagine what it would be like when it is busy.

4270988,2015-01-22,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"A friend and I met here for lunch.  I was nursing a hangover and thought a burger would do the trick. 

On entry, the colors and bar-counter & stools and booths make it more like a fast food place than a restaurant.  We sat down first and staff told us to go to the front and order and they would bring us our food.  

I ordered the Bobby Blue Burger.  It had Angus Beef, Blue Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato, cooked Medium Rare.  Growing up in the midwest, I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers and this was a good burger.  I thought I would eat only half and ended up eating the whole thing.  I did not try the fries nor did I get chips added to the burger.  I drank a water to hydrate, while eating my burger.  However, while I was ordering my burger I noticed they had Spike Milkshakes.  I had asked the clerk, which spike shake was the most popular and her response was the Vanilla Caramel Bourbon.  

As I was finishing my burger, a staff member asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered the Spike Pineapple Coconut Rum Milkshake without whipped cream.  (I thought it was funny that I could order and pay for shake while seated, but when I first walked in, I had to go to front register to order and pay for my burger).  The shake was thick and sweet (I could barely taste the booze), but there was no way I was going to finish it.

While sitting there, 2 other friends walked in.  Because the seating style has stools on both sides of the bar, our friends could sit across from us to chit chat.  Nice.

Finally, as I was leaving, I was planning to leave the shake there when a staff member asked if I wanted to have my shake placed in a to go cup.  Yes!  Glad they offered and I could take it back to my room.",VlyHGaMz3gbbQz5hytCeGA,1,0,4,VuVP0lyT9Xbk-QBFBFf-XA

So you'd think  that if Bobby is going to slap his celebrity name on it, that the food would be great --- ha, far from it.   The two $9.00 burgers the wife and I order were pathetically small --- AND COLD !!!   Did I say cold?  Yep --- bodies at mortuaries have more have more heat than these burgers.   And the fries and onion rings that we each ordered --- yep, you guessed it --- COLD, COLD, COLD.    

And COLD, COLD, COLD is what you get when you try to complain via good ole' Bobby's corporate website.   Not only do they have NO electronic method to send your comments, but they insist you write them a letter.   So basically, the COLDNESS starts at the top and funnels it's way down to the locations.  

Save your hard earned $$$ folks while in Vegas, and find a place that serves good food.   There are sooooo many others to chose from.

First it's very easy to find on the strip next to the Aria hotel. (Best hotel ever)  You can order online if you're in a rush, there always seems to be open seats due to the unique seating layout. And the food, hey, it's Bobby Flay's joint.  No need to even ask if he's using quality ingredients.  What was kind of a surprise was how well executed the rest of the restaurant concept was.

First, every customer is greeted by a friendly energetic face.  Options are well explained and after you order you're given a number to place on the table and when your food is ready it's brought out to you.  So, lots of places do this, but Bobby takes it a step further.  You can view the open kitchen which is always a good sign of a quality restaurant.  Another cool perk was that every order that comes out of the kitchen and placed on the oversized service window ledge can be viewed easily.  Cool way to see what others are getting, gave me ideas for next time actually. To my surprise almost everyone is getting chips on their burger, not just me!  Thought I was being a little daring but in Bob we trust.  Bobby says chips go on burgers then only thing I could say is hook me up with a crunch burger now!

The hamburger was delicious and quite unique.  More specifically it resembled a steak in flavor more than just a regular a burger.  First you have to squish down that top bun then open wide and ...to borrow a colloquialism from Emiril...BAM!!  You just had a bite of best burger in Vegas!!  Fries were excellent too and the food is made fresh to order which takes a few more minutes than the Ronald McMoney scene but it's worth every second and remember ...you can always order ahead!

4365647,2016-12-22,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Bobby Flay was never my favorite celebri-chef, though I always respected how good a loser he was on Throwdown and the not-good Iron Chef (aka Iron Chef America). You may laugh, but on Throwdown he was not only going up against people who were the best at what they do, he was always playing ""away games"" on THEIR turf - he had his work cut out for him and did a respectable job considering, and was never a sore loser or a dick to people. That said, I never liked him as much as Gordon Ramsay, who made his name out of being a dick to people.

But Gordon spoiled my illusion of his mad chef cred with his shite burger joint at the PH. Despite being a fast casual rather than a gourmet sit-down restaurant, Bobby's place blows BURGR out of the water. After the fiasco that was BURGR we almost didn't come here, but I'm glad we took the chance as it was right outside our hotel (the venerable Mandarin Oriental -- racist name, plush hotel).

The LA burger was decent - it was no Lucky Devil's American Kobe burger with crack sauce and crack bun, but it blew away the Gordon Burg(e)r o' Shame, and was cheaper to boot. It was a bit messy because it did not skimp on avocado. I ordered it rare and it was actually served rare! (This should not be that hard to find but sadly most places can't cook a rare burger, even if they say that they do. I'm not going to sue you, so unclench. Srsly.) They even offered to cut the burger in half for us to share, and gave us the potato chips on the side.

Cons: the burger was a bit on the small side, the bun was kind of McDonald-y, and the tomato was the sad pale bullet-proof kind.

I wasn't a fan of any of the sauces, but it didn't matter because neither the burger nor the fries needed it. The regular fries were surprisingly good, and I was pleasantly surprised that the sweet potato fries were not ""enhanced"" with extra sweetener like powdered sugar.

The dark chocolate milk shake was surprisingly not too sweet. The whipped cream was fresh, though a tad too sweet, but was perhaps a good balance with the dark chocolate, less sweet than regular chocolate by nature.

3.5 stars for food (A-OK+), 5 stars for service.

It was weird that you could only see partially into the kitchen - I spent the whole time watching a bunch of burly chests go back and forth... Not that this was necessarily a bad thing, mind you! One of the chefs complimented my husband's Unabomber beard - of course this from a man with his very own spectacular mountain man face muff.

I feel like the logo may purposely evoke the classic Burger Time video game. I also feel it maybe should have just been called Bobby's Burgers and had pun-ny names for the different burgers like the cartoon -- ""The Bobby Flayed Alive Burger: comes with pork cracklins."" :D

I didn't see any of the problems with service or cleanliness other Yelpers mentioned. Surprisingly no tip line on the check, even though there was partial table service (just not full service). Too bad, I was so impressed I wanted to tip them 50%, especially after the horrible service at the full service BURGR.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,0,1,4,xDy5-ftHuFdQm-sqyLHNxw

The staff are very friendly and offer suggestions which sauce to use on my burger and providing silverware.  There are mostly counter feel shaped in a S shaped or rectangle counters like a communal feel.  They also sell milkshakes and beer along with soda.  I would come back again.

I got the Brunch burger which was pretty basic even with the egg. The fries were ok.. definitely heavy with the cheese and bacon. I'd get that again.

Huge amount and a small was more than enough. Plenty of dipping sauces which I always love. 
Parking- Use Valet at the Mandarin Orient for easy access. It's right out the back door and I wish I would of known that before I made the trek.

While the menu is creative in combination of options appealing to many different tastes, the actual burgers are not cooked to the standards one would expect from Flay.   Ordered a medium rare, and the temperature was bordering on medium / well.  It does appear they cook to order, but hard to imagine they haven't mastered the combination of grill and high oven finish to hold in flavor and moisture.  Buns were dry and ""blah"".  With a thick burger the last thing you want is hard dry bun -- makes it impossible to eat and get a full bit of the burger.  We also tried the turkey burger - stay away from that. 

The counter order concept and service was great, but hearing folks sitting next to us also commenting on how plain and dry the burgers were confirmed Bobby needs to spend a little more time in this kitchen if he wants to protect his brand from ending up in a supermarket chain frozen section.  Several other celebrity chef burger places in Vegas have way exceeded this place.  It is still new, so we could attribute this to the ""teething process.""

First off this is simply above a Carl Jr's sorry to say but it is, and you get served off of plastic plate, interior looks super hip and cool, but when your burger is brought out, it reminds me of going to a weekend BBQ gathering served by uncle Fred who has been drinking beers and cooking your burgers. 

We ordered the NM Burger obviously residing in NM we thought heck lets give it a try, the condiments over killed the burger itself and the presentation was very juvenile and it made me feel like I said ""Uncle Fred"" made it....... the meat itself was pretty bland and quite small even for the low cost definitely not worth it. The price is good, but I would rather pay more to get a quality burger that is culinary inspired and using good quality condiments. 

The staff was friendly and attentive but when asked what we thought, we replied okay, she said well you order a burger right, so that is what you got a ""Burger"" they all taste the same there is nothing to it.

The onion rings are not quite excellent however. They are fresh and a nice size but the batter is too highly seasoned.

4655500,2015-02-27,6,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"My brother and  I had spent a few hours hanging out on The Las Vegas Strip when we decided to have dinner. I like trying new places and decided to try Bobby's Burger Palace. I was impressed with Shake Shack and figured that Bobby's Burger Palace was worth trying. 

  Bobby's Burger Palace is in the modern day Kingdom called City Center. It sits at the Corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Aria Drive in the shadow of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. 

  On the Saturday evening that we visited Bobby's Burger Palace was not too busy. We walked right to the counter where you order in the left side of the building. I decided on the beef Philadelphia burger ($9.50), onion rings ($4), and fountain Coke beverage ($2). After paying, the nice lady at the counter handed us a number that we'd place on the table. 

  Bobby's Burger Palace is a relatively large restaurant with counter and Dutch style seating (large tables). The south facing views overlook the open kitchen where you get to see the action going on in the kitchen. The east facing views overlook the Las Vegas Strip with the Hawaiian Market Place. The close-up views overlook a burger and onion rings that I will talk about. 

Beef Philadelphia burger: 3 stars

    I expected a burger that brought my taste buds to the similar sensation of a Philadelphia cheesesteak. The major ingredients were beef, onions, provolone cheese, and hot peppers. It is my understanding that there is a celebrity Chef named Bobby Flay that is the architect of the burgers here. My taste buds are indifferent to celebrity chefs. Regardless that the burger was made from quality ingredients, in my opinion it was good and not great. There just wasn't much flavor to it. The hot pepper was the overwhelming taste of the burger. From my experience eating on this part of the Strip, I have had tastier burgers at Nathan's in NY-NY, Outback's, and Shake Shack. 

Onion rings: 3 stars 

   The onion rings were giant size. Looking at them was impressive. Eating them was a different story. Because they were so big, it was annoying eating it. I'd bite the onion part causing the batter to separate. I've had better onion rings. 

Conclusion: 3 stars

  Bobby's Burger Palace, in my opinion is good yet nothing spectacular. When I pay nearly $20 for a burger, fries, and Coke I prefer a meal that is spectacular.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,13,3,q75OonfsQ9AD3ZFmT-0Rpw

All together we ordered 6 sandwiches, 5 burgers and one chicken sandwich and all received great reviews. 

We ordered a couple of orders of fries and a couple of milkshakes. All were very good but the reason for the 4 star rather than 5 is both the fries and milkshakes were overpriced for their value.

I had the Vegas burger which consisted of a beef patty, white american cheese, fresno red chiles & BBQ crunch (potato chips).

One of my favorite burgers is called the ""Vegas"" which has ""bbq crunch"" on it (aka bbq chips). Another unique creation i love is the ""Miami"" which is pressed (panini style) with ham and made up like a cordon bleu.

I got the Brunch burger and it was very good. Lots of flavor and the egg yolk was nice and runny. I tried the Burger Sauce on the side and didnt care for it much but thats on the table as an optional condiment. 

My wife got the Burger of the Month, which was a Greek Burger. Her only complaint was it didnt have enough tomato but she's a tomato freak. She loved it and we both wanted to order another burger simply cause they tasted so good. 

The cashier suggested only ordering 1 order of fries that they are enough for 2. That's true unless you're a fatty like us, next time I'll get 2 orders of fries as they are very good as well.

4820033,2014-07-20,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"My fiance and I came to Bobby Flay's burger joint because of me. I actually believed a celebrity chef's place would offer the best burgers in town. Well let me say we were both disappointed, and my fiance kept saying ""You said these burgers would be good.""

Well first off we were here once before for the Kahlua Vodka Mocha milkshakes. They are so good, so this time with our shake we decided to to try a burger and fries. 

Our burger arrived without the fries.  When I looked at the receipt, i noticed we were not charged for it, and by the looks and the taste of the burger, my fiance, said, ""forget it now, it's too late, and they probably will not be that good either.""

The service is horrible all around. We watched our milkshake sit on the chef server counter for at least 10 minutes, and still none of the staff brought it to me, so I decided to go up and get it myself.

The burger was on a lousy cheap small bun, the kind you would get at McDonalds. The size of the burger was not much bigger than a regular burger at McDonalds either, but for almost 10 bucks, not including the fries, which are $4 extra.

No use thinking about the fries that we didn't get anyway. Let's go back to the burger. It was very salty and skimpy and someone in the kitchen has a heavy hand with the salt.  
There were two guys sitting next to us who were also disappointed in the same way. They said they came because of good reviews on Yelp, but after seeing the size of the burgers and then tasting them, they claimed that the Yelp reviews were BS, and they must be staged, as part of some marketing ploy by a marketing company posing as legitimate patrons, or employees of the restaurant.

You would imagine that Bobby Flay would give his patrons a good thick juicy burger that is perfectly seasoned, considering his reputation and the price, but no! 

Maybe he wants to pretend the joint is in Paris, but even in Paris at good burger places, you can find a much tastier bigger burgers.

I asked the staff if Bobby Flay ever comes to the restaurant to check on it, and they claim when he does he works in the kitchen, so I am not sure if this is his recipe done correctly, or how he runs his restaurant, or if it's a case of the ""When the cat's away, the mice will play.""

I have not tried anything but the Kahlua Vodka Mocha milkshake and the burgers, so I can't say anything for now about the french fries or onion rings, but if the burgers they serve is any indication of what the rest of the food would be like, my fiance and I both agree, save your money and go somewhere else, especially if you know good food, this was a complete disappointment. 

Bobby Flay or no Bobby Flay, this restaurant will not stay in business long with the horrible service and the quality of the burger and bun.

It's right on the strip in front on the Mandarin Oriental, so very decent location.  The decor is kind of a throw back, but very cute.  Communal tables and chairs, kind of lunch counter/dinner type setting, very neat.  

The menu has a vast array of different types if burgers, a brunch burger that adds an egg, crunch burgers where you can add chips to pretty much any burger and so on.

Bobby's Burger Palace (Las Vegas) was far less than I had hoped for. It was my first visit, so I decided to try the ""burger of the month""; The Canadian Burger. Unfortunately, it was the most disappointing burger I've had in a very long time. A mediocre, diminutive burger with an unremarkable meat shingle, garnished with a slice of cheese and a simple piece of Canadian bacon. At $10.95, it was certainly not worth the price and the taste was ... meh.
I also tried the bacon-cheese fries; again, not a good experience. The fries were oily, and the ""cheese"" was, well, cheese sauce (think nacho cheese sauce). To crown the experience, the fries were sprinkled with bacon bits. Bacon bits that made me wonder if they were real bacon.

4980389,2017-08-27,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"First off, I am a HUGE Bobby Flay fan. Maybe my expectations were too high. A Palace, it is not. One half of the restaurant was a walk-up order counter in front of a dining room sort of sorts. The other side is trying to feel like a sports bar, but misses the mark there. All of it presents a cafeteria style, completely out of synch with the high-end shops and restaurants in the area. The Brunch Burger was underwhelming. I was waiting for those big bold Bobby Flay flavours to explode and instead, it was quite bland. The patty had no sear of any kind and was not seasoned well. Like a Grandmother's meatloaf sort of a thing. The egg was raw. Like, I completely understand egg yolk as ""sauce"" but the white should be firm and the yolk should be warm and runny not cold and watery. Oddly, the bun was a highlight - light and airy, not dense, just right. The cheese fries... NOPE. I envisioned real, melted cheese, not liquid fake-ish cheese that you would expect out of a machine at 7-11 for nachos 20 years ago. I mean, maybe the cheese sauce there was house made with the finest ingredients, but.. I doubt it. Tasted like melted Velveeta. Fries had no seasoning and were limp. The lack of crisp was made worse by the ""cheese"" sauce - soggy. Honestly, the highlight was the fact that we were eating at Bobby's place and we had a friendly bar-tender to take our order. Otherwise, a let-down. I would put any of my own home-made burgers up against what I was served here with confidence. I may not be able to ""Beat Bobby Flay"", but I bet you dollars to doughnuts I can beat his minions that run this joint.",Jb2l-8uTLHbuEvV3W6Xq5g,0,0,3,V7OmMWAUwxaJLuYSogORGg

Hey range from the higher end Wolfgang Puck to the super casual Guy Fieri.  So we're craving a burger and Bobby Flay's joint popped up.  After viewing a few pics of highly stacked burgers, we were in. 

Located on the street level in front of Mandarin Oriental, it's a partial service burger joint. 

You walk in, get in line and study the menu on the wall.  Place your order with the cashier and she'll hand you a # to place on your table.  They bring the food out once it's ready, and will clean up the table when you leave. Everything else you get yourself. 

Our order:

* LA Burger w chips, avocado relish and watercress. 3/5. Good but the avocado overpowered everything else. 
* Bacon Crunch Burger, essentially a bacon cheeseburger w chips. 3/5. A bit salty & cheesy. He bottom bun was soggy & flat. I had to flip it around. 
* Undecided, which is the name of side order of any 2 items.  We chose fries & onion rings. Three
Onion rings sitting on a small bed of fries, they looked crunchy and seasoned but immediately fell apart at the slightest touch. Batter quickly became crumbs. The fries were mostly short pieces and dark in color (i.e. leftovers) had to depend on the BBQ dipping sauce, which was actually good. Fries were not.  2/5
* Blueberry cheesecake milkshake, a small cup of nicely made shake. Not too sweet but quite small for the price.  3.5/5

It's a spacious area, able to accommodate many. All seating are on stools and all tables are long communal types.  High ceiling with modern lighting, positive quotes and obviously staged photos of Mr. Flay trying to look candid make the decor very fitting of a Vegas vibe. I just wish the food was better.",n8YKNoz1xJHJDe-_jxfbcQ,7,9,3,X-B_IOTSHzcI8fnDHj9OUw

Both my friend and I ordered the Crunch Burgers with her getting the beef medium well and myself getting the Turkey Burger along with fries and the Cactus Pear Margarita.  This was by far the best Turkey Burger I have ever tried as it was fresh and juicy and the potato chips gave it an extra kick.  My friend stated the same for her burger.  The order of fries were more than we expected as we did not finish both orders and wished we would have opted for just 1 order.  The sauces that were on the table were an extra treat and we tried almost all of them.  This visit and food was so good that we tried it a 2nd time on Sunday.

5012024,2014-05-19,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"My wife and I are big fans of Chef B. Flay. We have had several meals at Mesa Grill in Las Vegas before moving here. Being from The San Francisco bay area, we haven't traveled to NYC to try his other restaurants. We were pleased to discover that he was opening a Bobby's Burger Palace on the Strip. We made our way into the spot, located on the Las Vegas Blvd (Strip) in front of the Aria hotel and casino at Harmon Blvd. 
 We were smart and went in on a weekday afternoon between lunch and dinner. There was plenty of seating, and the decor was as expected of Chef Flay. I would say our first visit was within the first few weeks of opening. As expected the menu was big, bold, and easy to read and make a decision. 
 My wife ordered the New Mexico burger, I had the Carolina burger. We ordered the sweet potato fries, and I tried a dark chocolate shake.
 The burgers- 5 stars, perfectly cooked, great condiment pairings. The fries were very good, the Honey Mustard Horseradish sauce for the fries could make a flip flop tasty. The shake was amazing...the flavor was rich, bold, and pure chocolate heaven. Our first visit was 4.5 stars!
 
 Last month a good friend flew in for a afternoon between stops, I picked him up and we only had time for a quick bite, then back to the airport. I told him he had to try these burgers. Again the wife and I, our friend headed to the strip. The restaurant was far busier than our first visit, still plenty of seating. 
  The burgers and fries again were a 5/5 stars. Our friend was pleased and also impressed with the quality of food.
  The 1 star deduction is 100% related to service and dining room this time. The server who took our order did not look pleased to be employed in this day of economic status. She was distracted, in a horrible mood, and was not paying attention to the customers. Her appearance was frumpy (dumpy) very lazy. The dining room floor was quite messy, and there was plenty of staff working that could have spot swept the floor. I will say the tables were clean, the table top condiments were full and clean. I just observed the floors were covered in debris. 

  If you want a quality burger experience, then head to Bobby's Burger Palace! You will not be disapointed...Its pricy for a burger, but you taste that quality, and I have no problem paying for GOOD food.

5012832,2016-02-26,2,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"We were walking along the strip checking out the different casinos and saw Bobby's Burger Palace!  It wasn't open yet but we planned to stop here for lunch on our way back down to our hotel.  I'm mildly a Bobby Flay fan, as in, I love to hate him.  We came back just before opening and waited outside until 11am.  A few other people were waiting as well and the employees actually opened a little late.  I ordered the New Mexico burger which comes with white queso, roasted green chiles and pickled red onions, medium well.  My boyfriend ordered the Bobby Blue burger, which has blue cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato and got it ""crunchified"" which puts crunchy potato chips atop your burger (free!).  He ordered a side of onion rings and I got cheese fries.  We realized after we ordered the order taker hadn't asked how he wanted his burger cooked, so he had to go back up and tell her.

Once you place your order at the counter, find a seat in the very spacious dining area.  The little bar stools were comfortable and I found the decor appealing.  Our receipt had a bathroom code on it and I realized after several people came in just wanting to use the bathroom, why that was the case.  The women's restroom was dirty and unappealing, I had a feeling Bobby wouldn't be pleased - especially since they had just opened.

Our food came out a decent time later, and the server educated us on the house-made sauces provided on the table.  I tried each of them but honestly liked none.  My burger was excellent!  So flavorful and everything on the burger really complimented one other.  I could taste that the meat was good quality beef and well-seasoned with lots of pepper.  Cheese fries were rather blah and the cheese wasn't very cheesy.  He did not care for the meat in his hamburger and found the peppery flavor to be overpowering.  It did have quite a bit of pepper on it when we opened the burger up.  Onion rings were awful, I put one in my mouth to try it and immediately upon it touching my tongue I could only taste the overpowering flavor of flour.  No seasoning at all and no flavor.  Yuck!

Really good Onions rings!
a lot of sauces for fries and burgers
creative flavors and decent burger
really friendly service overall and the place itself is unique
pick any temperature for your burger
The bad: 
Expensive: For a fast casual boutique setup I think it is pretty steep to be spending over $20 for a Drink, fries and a burger.
The bun is way too small for the burger size

Part of a growing chain (18 restaurants in 11 states).  It's not fancy.  No build your own anything.  Make a ""concept"" selection, choose either burger, chicken, or turkey.  For beef burgers, choose a doneness level.  Opt for plain or ""crunchified"" (silly addition of chips in the sandwich).  Done.

The décor looks like a burger exploded.  Ketchup red, mustard yellow, golden bun, grilled beef brown.

Burgers are cooked to order, relatively juicy, decent beef flavor but grossly under seasoned.  Not good for mild burgers but welcome for spicy creations which are SPICY.  Toppings are fresh.  The Philadelphia Burger (provolone, griddled onions and hot peppers) packs a spicy punch but is good eats.  The LA burger (avocado, watercress, tomato and cheddar cheese) is so mild the burger is lost.

Definitely NOT a fan of the ""crunchified"" burgers.  The addition of chips adds a distracting textural contrast and nothing to the taste.  

Simple sides.  The beer battered onion rings best of the bunch.  Fries just OK.  Soggy at times.  The mayo, roasted red pepper, chipotle sauce it's served with is spicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries with honey mustard horseradish sauce is a better choice.

Very good, rich milk shake with pronounced flavors (the pistachio is worthy!)

Excellent service.

New Mexico Burger ($9.50): Queso Sauce, Pickled Red Onions & Pickled Jalapenos. This was very good! Initial juices flow out on the squeeze, the burger was cooked perfectly (MR), and the toppings added lots of flavor! Wish their Queso sauce was a bit thicker like their Mesa Grill counterpart....which this reminded me of strongly.  A pic for comparison :

French Fries ($4) with BBP Fry Sauce. These were cooked well-done+...not sure if they are supposed to be that crispy, or if mine were cooked too long. The fry sauce is good, kind of like a mayo/chile aioli.  Wish they were seasoned a bit more like Mesa Grill's Southwestern Fries...those are delicious!   Or at least give us an option for a seasoned fry :)

Vanilla Bean Milkshake ($6.50) with Whipped Cream. This was very creamy and rich...easy to drink! Wish there were adds like Nutella, Chocolate or Oreos though!

When you walk in, you order at the counter. We were greeted by a nice girl, I think her name was Lala? Anywho, I didn't see a burger that I really wanted on the menu (I usually order the bbq, onion rings, and cheddar cheese kind of burgers); but Lala was more than happy to try and accommodate me! She started with a basic cheeseburger and just asked me what I wanted to add. Ended up with cheddar and bbq sauce, which works for me. 

You are given a number and pick from any of the open seating. They bring you your food when it's ready. A nice guy (I forget his name but he was tall and bald) came to our table and told us the food would be out soon and proceeded to bring us silverware napkins etc. when our food came, he brought us a thing of all of these different sauces and explained the Flavors and ingredients in all of them! I was pretty impressed by this place thus far.

Our burgers were sooooo juicy and delicious!! I can't even begin to describe it. My burger had a seasoned kind of crust on it that was so good.

The fries (we had both the sweet potato and the regular kind) that went with them were also homemade and delicious... we loved the different ketchups and dipping sauces available to try with the burgers and fries.

5171977,2018-06-18,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"As a recent Vegas resident and lover of all things Bobby Flay, I was super stoked to find Bobby's Burger Palace on the strip to try out. In fact, I only discovered this after I watched a ""Beat Bobby Flay"" episode where it mentioned his restaurants in the credits. I looked it up...and sure enough!

First off, hardly a line for ordering and plenty of room to settle in at 8pm on a Friday night. The menu is large and viewable from the strip as you're walking by. I decided on the Veggie Burger and onion rings while my husband ordered ""the Brunch Burger"" of fried egg, bacon, and burger patty, along with regular fries.

Pros:
1. Fast food delivery from food order to table delivery
2. Great options for the vegetarian and carnivore alike :)
3. Modern atmosphere
4. Cool sauces to try with your burger at each table 

Cons:
1. Cleanliness (that particular night there were uncleared tables spotted everywhere, including the people next to us who had left 20-25 minutes before their places were cleared)
2. Average tasting food. Great ideas and options, nothing to be named special. (I expected more with Bobby Flay's name on it)
3. Hamburger buns are basic sesame seed buns
4. Customer service is.....ehhhh.

Am I being critical? Maybe. Would I eat here again? Maybe. For a cool place to try on the strip, it's worth it. Although, I'd recommend Strip Burger if you're wanting a really delicious place for burgers in Vegas.",JtpO11gSYxIMORHx7OumJw,1,0,3,1zhshHnWjx4h_70dk5X8HQ

I ordered the brunch burger medium rare which came with burger, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese.  Added lettuce, tomato and pickle at NO extra charge then crunchified it, also no charge.  Came out quickly and cooked perfectly.  The server that brought it to me said, ""Good luck,"" which I am guessing is because I created a huge burger.  I pushed it down to allow the egg to crush and the chips and then dug in.  The meat was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The flavors were all perfect together.  The bacon was crisp and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  We also ordered half fries and half rings.  Best onion rings!  Crisp, perfectly seasoned...just delicious.  The fries were great too.  All of the sauces on the table were tasty and fun to try.  I got to try Bobby's BBQ sauce, jalapeño sauce, Chipotle ketchup... all great with the rings and fries.

5228824,2014-05-12,10,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Oh Bobby's Burger Palace...I've been dreaming of you since January, when I came out for a tasting with Yelp, and I finally was able to make it out this weekend, to try you out for real.  No Yelp banners guaranteeing great service...the wonderful anonymity of being just a regular patron.

I had been raving about Bobby's since January.  
The tasting that I attended with Yelp (my first EVER Yelp event) was so wonderful, I kept looking for excuses to drive down to the strip to try the burgers again!  
I love going to events, but I always wait to review a place until I've been back as a regular paying customer.  That way I can review the food and service without any bias.

So, oddly enough, after another event on Saturday night, my fella and I met up with a friend in town for dinner at Bobby's.  

We perused the menu, and decided on our burgers, beverages, and fries.  The girl who took our order was sweet, and polite, and very friendly.

We sat down, and within a very short time, we had our drinks:  An IPA for my love, a Cactus Pear margarita for me (where have you been all my life?!) and a spiked milkshake for my friend. (it did not bring all the boys to the yard, however.) 

The service was great, we were checked on frequently, but not too frequently that we were annoyed.

The margarita was strong, and just as amazing as I remembered.  
The spiked milkshake, though...WOW.  We had the vanilla, caramel, bourbon shake, and it was heaven in a glass.  Those could be dangerous!!

The burgers came out, and they looked amazing.  
Mine:  The New Mexico Burger: with Queso sauce, roasted green chilies, and pickled red onions:  I remembered this being one of my top two at the tasting, and this did NOT disappoint!  Spicy and delicious, with flavorful beef!  It was cooked perfectly. 

BF: The Bobby Blue burger: blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato.
I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I didn't try it, but judging by how quickly it was gone, I think he liked it. ;) 

Friend: The Brunch burger: fried egg, smoked bacon, and american cheese.  I did try a bite of this one, and the egg was perfect and runny, with delicious crisp bacon!  

We also did the half and half, with sweet potato fries and french fries.  Both were awesome.  
The boys tried all of the sauces, and decided that the favorite was the Burger sauce.  

For 3 people to have a burger each, split fries, and an alcoholic beverage, it only came to $62.  That is SO reasonable.

And now for the blasphemy:  
I think I prefer Bobby's to Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  
They were both great, but Bobby's just felt like a more authentic, tastier American burger, and for half the price.

The interior was different and fun...liked the layout of it.

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.

I. Ordering
Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Philly burgers - provolone, griddled onions, and hot peppers ($9.50) crunchified (which means with potato chips). We also ordered fries ($4).

II. The burgers
We actually asked for double crunchified and it was awesome! It seemed gimmicky at first, but everyone really enjoyed the potato chips. The burger patty was cooked perfectly to order, but they were a little on the dry side. There was a meaty flavor, but not matching some of the beautiful meatiness we've had in other burgers. The patties were seasoned heavily with black pepper, which gave it a great flavor. The peppers and onions were cooked well and despite the multitude of seeds in the peppers, they weren't overtly spicy. They gave a great little kick to the burger. The provolone seemed to fade into the background and seemed unnecessary on the burger. They didn't like the bun because it got soggy with all the juice from the onions and peppers, but I like that it has sesame seeds. They also give you a giant pickle spear! Yum!

III. The fries
Fries are good, pretty standard. They were cut a little thicker, but not too potatoey.

IV. Miscellaneous
This is located in the city center area. If you're getting dropped off by uber or lyft, get dropped off at the Mandarin Oriental entrance. It's really close to Bobby's. They have a bathroom code that you need (printed on your receipt). They have bottled and tap beer. They have some cool looking lights in the restaurant and the tables are shaped interestingly. A waiter comes by and gives you utensils and stuff, but you order at the counter before you get seated. They also have ""to go"" if you wish. The waiter told us they make 25 homemade sauces, but they only have 3 of them out for your dipping/topping pleasure. The woman who took our order, Valerie, was hilariously funny. She was great; the self proclaimed bathroom nazi.

V. Value
Value is pretty good especially because you can crunchify your burger for free! You definitely need to crunchify your burger!

VI. The verdict
The Philly is definitely not their best burger. I would recommend the Miami or the Dallas instead. However, these ratings are based on this particular burger: 3.1, 3.4, 3.7, 3.7, 3.8.

Surprisingly, I was disappointed by my meal. My friend and I were joking that the water was the best part of the meal because the burgers were so salty. For me, it was the giant deli pickle on the side. I ordered the Dallas Burger ($9) which has coleslaw, Monterey Jack cheese, BBQ Sauce, and pickles. The burger itself was pretty good. I also tried some of the Brunch Burger, which has smoked bacon, American cheese, and a fried egg... but I agreed with all three of my friends who ordered that burger that it was way too salty.

I like that you can ""crunchify"" your burger, which just means they add some thin potato chips inside your burger to add an awesome sounding CRUNCH. The chips add extra salt to your burger so watch out.

The sweet potato fries ($4) were underwhelming (but the perfect amount of salt) and its honey mustard dipping sauce was super watery and did not go well with the fries. Speaking of sauces, I liked the Chipotle sauce with my burger, but stay away from the Burger sauce, ironically.

Lastly, the Cactus Pear Margarita tasted... interesting. Maybe it's because I don't know what actual cactus pear tastes like. It looks super cool AND you get to keep the cup, but I would not recommend this drink unless you are feeling adventurous.

Chocolate syrup blended with vanilla ice cream. This is an old recipe and you just can't go wrong with this. 4/5

The shakes were of the right consistency - not runny, not too thick. You have no options to be creative and add toppings/ fix ins with them though. The service was alright. The place is bright, modern and clean. It just doesn't have anything worth coming here over and over.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,5,3,hPlJ37gL2Vi3NBn-8tfh1g

5333683,2017-05-09,12,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"There is no other street in America like Las Vegas Blvd. ""The Strip,"" that I can think of that contains some of the most popular burger chains in America. The variety of selection in the past few years has exploded on the strip. This includes huge outpost for In-N-Out, Shake Shack and White Castle. Plus celebrity chefs with their take on burgers prepared their way. So I was really looking forward to trying Bobby Flay Burger Palace. 

The atmosphere is very modern and good for large groups. Pretty much order at the counter and get served at your table. I was quite pleased with the service considering there was a line but the staff was helpful and the whole process of ordering and receiving was great. At the time of my visit, the dinning room was organized and clean. 

Onto the the food, I ordered the Brunch Burger (Fried Egg, Smoked Bacon & American Cheddar) with an order of half & half (Fries & Onion Rings). The burger was ok and wasn't that mind blowing. I personally didn't like the seasoning of the the meat patty and was on the oily side. My order of fries was on the soggy side and could've use more seasoning but I did enjoy the onion rings. A cool thing about this place is the condiment caddy and the various sauces at each table. 

Would I come back, it depends if I'm in the immediate area with family or friends who wants to check this place, other than that it's not something I would come back for. However, it's worth checking out and maybe catch a glimpse of Bobby Flay!

5333747,2014-12-21,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Gotta say, I was pretty impressed.  We're locals and figured we'd give it a shot since we rarely go to the Strip.  Had the Miami burger - its a Cuban Sandwich (ham, swiss cheese, dill pickle, mustard and mayo) on top of a burger.  I was brave and got my burger rare (I figure its Bobby Flay's place - he's got a reputation to uphold!).  Damn, it was good, very rich and just the right size. Burger was super juicy and tasty. My friend got a basic cheeseburger (medium-rare) and said it was absolutely delicious.  

Clearly they have been listening to the Yelpers, because I was worried that the fries would have too much salt (i'm careful about how much salt I eat) - the fries were gorgeous; crispy and  lightly salted. My friend ate most of the them - he loved them!  It was okay though, as the burger was so filling that I couldn't have fit in anything else. Service was prompt and very friendly - the lady behind the counter was genuinely cheerful and very helpful explaining various items on the menu.  She clearly was well-versed on their menu, which is always great. Was a little pricey, but I'd definitely go back - I dare say it would be worth fighting the tourist crowds for this burger and fries..",Kh95vaUIj_NCSbYmWMAiyQ,0,0,4,VD_IFVtDwpGlh7fK_smVZg
5335475,2014-07-10,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"The burgers here are great, but except for the ability to ""crunchify"" them (add potato chips) upon request, there's nothing really special that distinguishes them from the ones at other gourmet burger spots on the Strip. 

The sauces for the fries and onion rings, however, are a completely different story. They're clearly the stars of the show here and definitely worth the trip. The sweet potato fries are served with a horseradish honey mustard while the regular fries come with a chipotle aioli spread. Each table also has bottles of jalapeño sauce and chipotle ketchup, both of which are highly recommended. It will set you back $4 for an average-size side of fries, but the cost is well worth it just to try these assorted sauces.

The other appealing aspect of Bobby's Burger Palace is the option for tourists to walk in directly off the Strip sidewalk. But if you're a Vegas local or a tourist with a car, I definitely suggest parking at the Mandarin Oriental valet (which is directly next door just a few feet away). You'll save yourself a long walk and the possibility of having a yardstick of beer spilled on you by a drunk and stumbling tourist.

In summary.... If money is no object, you don't mind a wait, and you're looking for the best-tasting burgers in town, there are other burger spots I would recommend more (especially if you're looking for more of a restaurant than a fast-casual place). But if you're looking for a quick bite to eat at fairly reasonable prices (compared to other gourmet burger restaurants), you could do a lot worse than Bobby's Burger Palace. I personally prefer it over I Love Burgers (Palazzo) and BLT (Mirage), which are a bit overrated in my opinion.",vJ9UB9QpSbSkvTZnS-dsyQ,0,0,4,jqFfMbdanGFLYUNUvqubqw

I am glad to be wrong in cases like this. The food was cheap for food on the strip. Just slightly more expensive than shake shack for example. 
We got the brunch burger and LA burger. Wife and both liked each alot. I would have preferred the bacon on mine a little more well done. We also ordered the split side option where we could get half onion rings and half sweet potato fries. It only gave us 4 onion rings to share but they are huge. We didn't finish them all. They were awesome. We also ordered a vanilla bean malt. Delightful. I actually preferred this malt to the shakes at burgr. The ones at burgr were just too rich.

You know it's bad when you're sitting there wishing you were eating a McDonald's Big Mac instead!

Even the burger I had at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill, which I thought had a weird taste to it, tasted better than the burger I got here, which was just ""meh.""  Didn't like the bun, didn't like the meat, therefore didn't like the burger.  Also, the vanilla shake I got was just ""ok"" at best.  I like my shakes thick but theirs was on the runnier side.  Definitely can't compare to the delicious shakes at Gordon Ramsay BurGR!  Or even Jack in the Box for crying out loud! :p  I tried to eat as much of my food as possible though - $40 for a burger meal for two and it's not even a sit-down type of restaurant?  Yikes!!  Note, if you get the combo of sides and choose onion rings as one option, you get only two onion rings!  (They are big ones though.)

The place was already busy at noon on a Sunday of a holiday weekend when I went, and half an hour later just about every table was taken, at least outside.  If you do sit outside, they will bring condiments, napkins, and silverware to you.  Also beware of the flies/gnats out there.

My burger was delicious and the overall first impression was good enough where this location will always be considered when looking for a burger when we're on the Strip.

Once you find the restaurant just in front of the Mandarin Oriental on Las Vegas Blvd, you can order from the counter, take a number, and the food will be brought out to you. Your choice of proteins for your sandwich are Angus beef, ground turkey, or a whole chicken breast, which you can choose to crunchify. And your choice of sides are sweet potato fries, hand-cut fries, and buttermilk onion rings. If you're not in the mood for a burger, they have a griddled cheese or salad as an option. For drinks, there is a soda fountain with Coke products. They also have shakes and a small selection of beer and wine.

After we ordered, we sat on the rail close to the bar where we could still view the televisions and our food was brought out in exactly 10 minutes. Other than the rail where we were sitting, seating is at longer straight or horseshoe shaped community tables. The temperatures of the burgers are cooked to order and my wife's Palace Classic with bacon was cooked well done to her liking and was finished without a problem along with our side, The Undecided, which we chose regular fries and onion rings. There's nothing significant to say about the sides, but that's not what I was there for. My New Mexico had a nice, juicy Angus beef patty sandwiched between a lightly toasted sesame seed bun and was topped with queso sauce, roasted green chiles that provided a little smoky heat, and pickled red onion that added some acidity and crunch.

We were pleased with just about everything except my Modelo definitely had some skunkiness to it (the college frat boy in me drank the beer anyway) and someone started cleaning the rail next to us after the previous customers, but didn't finish the job, which was kind of an eye sore but none of these things are major deterrents and wouldn't keep us from coming back.

Flat out one of the beast burgers I've ever had, especially for the price. To start it was perfectly cooked at a medium rare temperature. You would be surprised how few places can get this right, including higher end burger joints. I would say this place is more of a fast casual dining experience. They keep it simple here, American cheese on most of the burgers and a simple sesame bun that is soft and delicious. Now, I hear people scoffing at the American cheese, but there is nothing wrong with it on a classic American cheeseburger and it in fact has the best texture and creaminess for a great burger. 

The fries were okay, nothing special. The onion rings were good, maybe a little to big to eat. The burger sauce is what I would recommend. The chipotle is way too strong, if you opt for this sauce you might want to cut it 1/10 with normal ketchup. Even though the shakes are $6 I def recommend. I had the basic vanilla bean and it was one of the best I've ever had. Vanilla gets a bad rap, the word being almost synonymous with boring. This is quite unfair. Vanilla is one of the most complex flavor a out there and deserves a chance to shine.

My boyfriend had the Vegas burger, which was definitely more unique with red chilies and BBQ chips that gave an extra crunch. I ordered the LA burger with chicken breast, which was topped off with guacamole and the usual fixings. The chicken was cooked really well, but the cheddar cheese reminded me of sliced grocery store cheese. Somehow the bun also got extremely soggy on the bottom, so I was holding onto mush by the end of my burger. Overall, the burgers were satisfying but nothing particularly special. We also ordered the half sweet potato fries and half regular fries, which came with great dipping sauces (chipotle mayo and horseradish sauce). They also had a great array of other sauces for your burger or fries, including a chipotle ketchup and jalapeño sauce.

Also when it comes to service I have to mention ""Enzo"" our server, what a wonderful knowledgeable, polite and empowered guy! He knew exactly each sauce ingredient and recommended some great ones, he explained to me the whole cooking process and even mentioned that Chef Bobby Flay visits the place at least 4 times a year! He made us feel like Royalty.
Need I say more? A unique burger with creative, original, innovative, imaginative and ingenious mix of flavors and excellent balanced sauces. Bobby's Burger Palace in Las Vegas is no joke! You have to visit this joint if you come to Vegas, trust me! and lastly between burger and onion rings is around $18.00 !!! Excellent deal for the strip Specially if you compare it to my prior reviews of other Burger joints at Vegas.

The tables were set up in a c kind of bar way that promoted conversation and also made for a lot of setting.  There were pictures interspersed with different quotes on the wall which made for a nice touch. 
The menu itself was simplistic, pick your type of burger and then what meat you wanted. They also had some salads and different kinds of fries and onion rings that you could order.  My mom and I chose to split the crunch burger and the indecisive side which was onion rings and fries. The burger was a burger patty with cheese topped with potato chips. Even splitting it it was more than enough. It was juicy and great flavor. The onion rings were huge and lightly battered. Obviously handmade not the kind that comes from a bag. While the fries were fresh cut and flavorful. One of my favorite things was the variety of sauces that were on each table that you could try. The burger sauce was good. It had a smokey flavor that wasn't overwhelming. 
The food came out fast and hot which was also a huge plus. Even though it was a fast casual place, people still came by to make sure everything tasted alright and how you wanted. I was impressed.

When you walk in the place, there are no servers to help you and no signs explaining how the system works, so we just grabbed a seat. A minute or two later, a waiter told us to go to the front to order and *then* sit down. Well, great, but couldn't there have been some indication of this somewhere?

Anyway, I got the Philly (""Provolone, griddled onions, hot peppers"") and asked for it ""crunchified"" (which just means they stack plain chips in there). We were attempting to decide between fries and onion rings when we noticed the Undecided option, which allows you to get a combination of two items from: Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and Buttermilk Onion Rings. It's a pretty sweet deal for $5.

The food arrived about 10 minutes later and it was good. Really good. The onion rings, sparse as they were, rank among the best I've ever had, while the fries were definitely above average and the accompanying dipping sauces were a perfect accompaniment. The burger itself was surprisingly delicious and impressively cooked to medium (it was pink and juicy in the middle). I guess my one complaint would be that the onions and hot peppers were cut a little too thickly for a hamburger, as several bites were just dominated by these items (while other bites didn't have any at all, essentially).

I also ordered the Milkshake of the Month, which was Dulce de Leche and it was glorious. Rich and creamy, it contained an intense caramel flavor that was impossible to resist.",iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,2,3,4,H88MIMDJG_HwSmZADaqBZg

I ordered the Carolina Cheeseburger, and although a truly original and outstanding sauce offering, I was dismayed to learn that the burger lacks any traditional vegetables.  It's a patty with cheese and sauce.  The tastes? Great.   But to me, it is still incomplete as a burger without traditional garnish.  The onion rings were good, superior to Burger Bar's and still not as good as Top's and TwoHeys (Pasadena/Alhambra). The milk shake? Small, but not bad.

I had to ask for Thousand Island or an equivalent sauce for the onion rings. I had to ask for a slice of tomato and lettuce from the help.  What came was a lifeless piece of romaine and a tomato that for all intents appeared to have a bite taken out of it.  No taste. I'd expect nothing but the freshest and finest tomatoes and lettuce at a BF establishment, as would you. The patty was  excellent.

The air quality is low.  The stench of burger grease permeates the air.  Somehow, this is a turn-off, and I don't care if it is a burger place.  Cafeteria style seating didn't work out well due to people desiring privacy.  The bathroom wasn't really tidy either. 

What the place needs is for the owner to come back and candidly (somehow) sample the recipes and fine-tune the entire offering.",gADzVWGY41IxvU2O8VvK3g,0,0,3,m9DfsUSTwIPlMkDdPX-Y9Q

If you're opening a burger joint with a chef as famous as Bobby Flay, I'd think you should be able to get the burger basics pretty much perfect.  Not so.  My son ordered a medium well basic beef burger with American cheese, pickles and lettuce.  Pretty simple, right?  Not only did the cashier have a REALLY HARD time with that basic order (we had to repeat it three times as she tried to find their closest signature specialty burgers and then figure out what key ingredients she needed to remove-- nightmare) ... but my son's burger was medium RARE (not nearly medium well as ordered) and no lettuce to be found.  Also, the fries were all messed up--clumped together, leaving them inconsistent in texture (some clumps were raw while other fries were damn near burnt).  My L.A. turkey burger with avocado ""relish"" was O.K.  First off, don't say ""avocado relish"" if you're just going to place one sliver of fresh avocado on top.  That's called ""a sample of freshly sliced avocado"" ... and the turkey was not well seasoned as you might imagine.  My love's salad was pitiful (could have done better at a cheap buffet) ... but if you're not going to have a signature veggie patty at a burger joint, then at least have a couple of really solid salads with some decent proteins.

On a positive note, the sweet potato fries were terrific (along with the dipping sauces) and the presentation was fabulous (along with some creative ambiance and seating design).

The veggie burger looked promising on paper. Chock full of mushrooms, and didn't have egg or milk ground into the patty? YES PLEASE!

Arrived at my table, and it looked delicious! Bit into it, and initially it didn't have much flavor, kept chewing and my face contorted into the ugliest expression I could possibly have formed. There was such a horrid chemical aftertaste. It wasn't just the patty either. The tomatoes and lettuce tasted off as well. Even the sauces at the table had that chemical taste!!! Perhaps the whole damn restaurant tasted like a chemistry lab. Bet money if I'd licked the floor, it would have that same unappealing flavor.

Seeing as how the veggie burger was the only thing on the menu suitable for my dietary needs, I know I for sure won't be back. Well, maybe if you paid me $50 I could change my mind.
Perhaps it was just an off day, idk.

It did not disappoint - I had the Texas, which comes with seasoned patty, pepper jack cheese, coleslaw and pickled (which somehow I missed on the menu as I hate pickles and should have had them removed!)

The bun was a fresh sesame seed coated one (if only Five Guys could have a bun half as fresh as this one).

It was very tasty, spicy and crunchy, cooked to a perfect medium rare - which is hard to find at many restaurants.

We shared a coffee milkshake which was also very good, not too sweet and a good coffee flavor.

The onion rings are also very good, they come with a dipping sauce which I think had chipotle in it.

There are 4 sauces to try on every table - jalapeno, mustard, chipotle ketchup and burger sauce - all are good to try with the onion rings.

5727672,2017-04-06,1,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"In Las Vegas this past Monday and wanted to try this place. If you know Bobby Flay's strengths they are in quality ingredients and he is the master of sauces and flavors. I went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. He has about 10 burgers on the menu and my wife and I tried three, all were outstanding, the Palace Classic, Bobby Blue and Philly.  All three were excellent however, the Palace Classic was the clear winner. This burger is simple in it's execution, the beef is fresh and seasoned perfectly however not pressed to a thinness that is overwhelmed by the bun, the beef is the star believe it. By simply adding to the supurbly cooked beef patty American cheese, lettuce, tomato and a slice of red onion on a sesame seed bun that holds together better than most, the Burger sauce, Chipotle sauce only enhance the flavor of the burger. It's amazing what Bobby can do to a burger,  probably one of the two best I've had period. Add a Vanilla Caramel Bourbon shake and it's simply magic. The manager, Sean keeps this place running smoothly and he engages with customers easily and he represents the brand well.  If Bobby opens one of these in Hawaii, Teddy's Big Burgers, Five Guys or any of the others will have a problem as his product is superior in quality, taste, execution and to top it off, after eating you just get up and walk out, the staff clears your table for you.

We are back for work and stopped by while walking the strip.
This did not disappoint.
The burgers have a nice char which give them the perfect crunch. Ooh you can add chips, now it's a double crunch. 
Bacon Crunch Burger. Well double crunch like I said and crisp bacon. Now it's triple crunch, booyah. 
Beef Brunch Burger. You can not control were the yolk flows, bushy beards beware. You take anything that is good and make it better with a runny yolk dripping over it. (OK I would not put an egg on my ribeye) 
Onion Rings are buttermilk battered and there is lots of pepper in the batter. This could be an award winning southern fried chicken batter.
The burger was perfectly seasoned, but you add the bacon and it was to salty for my wife and boarder line for me. If not for this it would be 5 stars.

You stand in a line (almost no wait for us) and order, they give you a number and bring it out when it is ready.

I chose the Bacon Crunch Burger (Bacon, American Cheese, Potato Chips) and the Shake of the Month Cherry Blossom. My co-worker and I shared an order of Undecided (French Fries & Onion Rings).

The burger was a perfect Medium Well and has to be one of the top burgers I have had. The seasoning was very good and Bobby's Burger Sauce was a good addition. The bun was fairly mundane.

The only problem we ran into was my shake was apparently given to the wrong table and had to be remade. It took longer than I thought it should, we actually started to think that they had forgotten with a staff change.

I am not sure what was supposed to make the Shake Cherry Blossom flavored. I tasted plenty of cherry flavor and it was quite good. Not too thick, not too thin.

We would eventually break up, Bobby falling in disarray because he lost the love of his life, and I would have custody of Nacho. 

*insert thinking emoji* This has absolute no relevance to my review but I guess those dreams somehow led me to eat a burger at Bobby's Burger Palace.  Wewt!

I must say, I was kind of underwhelmed.  For someone who so passionately loves burgers, how can the beef be so under-seasoned?  The cook on the meat was a perfect juicy medium-rare but most of the flavor from my burger, the flavor of the month: Napa Valley Burger [goat cheese, Meyer-lemon honey mustard, and watercress], came from the Meyer-lemon mustard.  It was too sweet for my liking.  I got mine Crunchified because I figured I needed some texture.  I did enjoy a bite of the Bobby Blue + Bacon Burger [blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato].  If you love blue cheese, you will love this burger.  To be shared was The Undecided [half order of onion ring and half order of sweet potato fries in our case].  I was excited to be able to try all his sauces as well.  The jalapeño hot sauce was fire!

Decor looks like a fast food joint.  Gourmet burgers or fast food?  * scratches head*

My overall impressions?!  Worst burger experience I have had in vegas!

Bobby Flay is known for potato chips layered in his burger.  Fine!  Adds a crunchy texture.  Crunchify works so add points for that idea!

How did BBP lose me?  All of my group's burgers were extremely salty!  Can I get some beef with my salt, please?!  Shocked at how salty our burgers, we watched as the cooks lathered up other orders with an avalanche of salt.  Oh boy!  I would assume cooks would know when too much is too much...

In addition, my patty was overcooked!  Ordered medium but received medium well...  You have one job, make burgers!

Can you customize your burger at BBP?  I didn't see pricing for that... =(

Ending this review on a positive note, the shake was delish!

I had the Dallas burger (medium well) and the sweet potato fries. Both were delicious! Burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were more full than I expected. Plus the honey mustard-horseradish sauce they served with the sweet potato fries was tasty! I spent about $15 for my burger and fries. I don't think that's terrible considering its Las Vegas. 

The burger was terribly messy but that didn't phase me. It was amazingly good!!

This is definitely a place I would go to again on my next Vegas trip.",lQYJXpzzB98zDVkCQzFoSQ,0,0,5,Lz_f3ZRQXUJTSGv_y0LGVA

5915310,2015-10-23,1,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Background:
Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) is easily my favorite celebrity chef burger chain. I was introduced to BBP from his locations in Maryland so naturally i was excited to see one pop up in Vegas. As of right now it's the only one west of the Mississippi River.
Anyone who has watched the food network in the past 10 years knows that Bobby Flay is known for his sauces and his moniker ""the sauce is the boss"" this bodes true to life with the food at his burger palace. 

The food:
I've had just about every burger on the menu and my favorite are the BBQ based concoctions: the Dallas and the Carolina. However, no matter what burger you decide on it's always better when you add bacon and crunchify it! It's so crazy that it took a world renowned chef to make famous what we all did when we were kids and put potato chips in our sandwich. 10yr olds idea but a $1,000,000.00 one at that. 

At each table there is an array of Bobby'ssignature sauces ranging from chipotle ketchup, barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and of course my favorites; the fry sauce and burger sauce. 
I almost feel guilty slathering the burger in all the different sauces because the burger taste awesome all by itself. They are always well seasoned and cooked to medium perfection each time I've ordered them. 

I love this place..

Crunchify my brother!!",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,2,1,5,y7fdAq_6nbn3C4muX1n4JQ
5916610,2017-06-22,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,Solid Bobby Flay Burger Place. We lived across the street from his first one in Smithtown NY. This matched that one and pricing was about the same based on memory. $10-$11 for a solid burger - not bland fast food. Tip: fries are large enough for two to share. Shakes are very good too.,X5QK8jt58A-_jHRZWRC8QA,0,0,4,luQkKtJ-a9Q9HYHHeLvM9w
5918962,2014-02-11,6,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Prime location (right in the front of the CityCenter campus), celebrity name recognition, quality ingredients for another gourmet burger spot right on the Strip without the extravagant pricing = Win, Win situation for Bobby Flay and his customers, especially those in the vicinity of Aria and the surrounding properties.

If you have a MLife Rewards Card, show that to the cashier when you place your order and you will save yourself 10% right on the spot.  Instant gratification for the win!  And don't get too excited and distracted and forget about the BBP Rewards card, where every dollar spent equals 1 point, and you can redeem 100 points for a burger, sandwich or salad.  Not too shabby!

Before I get into my review of the food, let me just say that the waitstaff here are amazing.  We are not in a fancy smancy gourmet restaurant, but that does not stop the waitstaff that roams the ""patio"" and the restaurant from delivering that much appreciated authentic friendly and upbeat attitude for all the customers.  Great job of selecting fantastic employees and providing top notch training.

Now the burger.  I was going to get the New Mexico Burger, given that the description was very enticing, plus the flavor profile seems right up Bobby's alley of culinary expertise.  But I was swayed last minute by the little Burger of the Month signage where you queue up to place your order.  So I ended up getting the Canadian Burger (White Cheddar Cheese, Canadian Bacon, Maple Mustard Sauce for $10).

The burger itself was cooked perfectly (I asked for Medium Rare, and it came out juicy and red in the middle).  Presentation was simple.  The burger itself was not large and definitely not pack with too many competing ingredients and flavors.  But I would have preferred it served with some lettuce and sliced tomatoes.  The sesame seed bun was okay, probably better than what you get at McDonald's, but it is not at the same level as a fresh oven baked brioche either.  But for $10 it really is a great deal for this neighborhood.

I also ordered the Vanilla Bean Malted Shake with real whipped cream, it was good, but the portion was underwhelming and will set you back $6.50.  Personally I would just order two different burgers and be done with it and find dessert next door (PinkBerry or Starbucks).

Other details:  you have 3 choices of proteins (Certified Angus Beef, Ground Turkey and Whole Chicken Breast), no vegetarian options, and at the tables you have condiment racks filled with your typical salt and pepper, ketchup, yellow mustard, and Bobby's gourmet sauces (Chipotle Ketchup, Burger Sauce, and Jalapeno Hot Sauce).  I tried all of the gourmet sauces and all were good, but I preferred the Burger Sauce the most.

So definitely a great, relatively inexpensive spot to stop for a bite to eat as you stroll up and down the Strip or wondering inside Crystals or Aria, especially with the great friendly service (that alone bumped it up to 4 stars in my review).

I loved the different burger sauces they provide at every table and the Chipotle ketchup fry sauce is delicious.

5941816,2015-11-14,0,iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,"Pretty good burger overall, although with the reputation of Bobby Flay you almost expect something out of this world. The restaurant space is inviting with a modern fast casual vibe. The menu is themed by burgers representative of various cities in the U.S. I ordered the LA burger, which had a nice thick beef burger patty, avocado relish, watercress and tomato. The medium well burger was cooked properly and the toppings were abundant, particularly the avocado. The only real critique was the burger itself was under seasoned, which other reviewers have indicated. Something underestimated about the burger was the bread was in the right proportion (just enough to fit the ingredients, but not more). The accompany burger sauces were a pleasant surprise. The jalapeño sauce had a nice mix of heat and sweetness and the chiptole ketchup was a nice added kick from regular ketchup. The fries were crispy and salted well. Everything was fairly priced, particularly given the location. All and all a good experience and I'd eat here again.",OmQvpZKv31wFcDoifqkpyQ,0,0,4,ZIjOV-nWtcuTnTK5v4ryHw

The line was pretty long, but went quickly. I ordered the brunch burger and I grabbed some fries from my friend's order. The sides were enormous, so definitely share if you aren't starving.

My burger was good, nothing amazing, I had hoped for a little more flavor. The burger was cooked well, but overly salted, as were the fries. 

Service was nice. They had staff walking around cleaning tables and offering refills and grabbing to go boxes.

The adult milkshakes (caramel bourbon) was tasty but just to rich to finish... Between two people...

Line was short, service quick. Seating plentiful and the decor was bright and fun. Burgers were $9.99 each which, although small, I thought was reasonable for the heart of the Las Vegas strip.

We split an order of sweet potato and regular fries and the group devoured those pretty quickly.

I would be back more often if Fuku burger wasn't across the street (see review) and if I had plans to go to Vegas anytime soon (I don't... For a LONG time time...)",UyKVmpHUcsk_tjcspIWUow,0,1,4,VQP_tyB2LaArPmtGsLFQJQ
