41448,2012-08-14,0,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"During a recent stay at the Rio, my girlfriend and I decided to do Martorano's for dinner.

We are vegetarians, so there were only a handful of options for us,  but enough that we felt there was at least some choice.  She had the gnocchi which was quite good,  I had the pizza which I also greatly enjoyed.  I expected a 10"" pizza as most places have for single servings... but this was a 12"" and half of it was our breakfast the next morning.  The meals were good, but the prices for the food and wine were very Vegas, and by that, I mean over priced.

We're both very snobbish when it comes to food, so while the meals were very good, they were certainly not the best we've had.

Dessert was another story.  We decided to split the tiramisu... we were not prepared for this.  Previously the best I've had was at a hole in the wall in Rome where the staff did not speak English (a requirement if I'm going to a sit-down restaurant in a city with lots of tourism).   This tiramisu was leaps and bounds better.  Perfect is an understatement.  When I return to Vegas, I'm coming back to Martornao's just for this, and you should as well.",5phw9GfYYzsl96n5KNi1YQ,1,0,5,x4w5g0Bto2BhFUyjbSMW2w

The food is not typical Italian - it's Italian, but with a South Philadelphia flair.  Everything was very good - I don't know how much else I can say.  The tomatoes in the Caprese tasted like tomatoes.  The cheese (both Mozzarella and Ricotta) are made in house.  The meatball is to die for.  The desserts were good.

I personally am not a fan of violence so when the music was lowered to turn up the volume on the movies playing I did not enjoy watching and hearing people get beaten up.  Again I could overlook that if the food was at least good.

We went to have dinner there after my brother got married. we waited for about 45 min for a table, considering we didn't have a reservation that was ok. when we finally sit down at our table, wow we couldn't even hear the waiter ask us what we wanted to drink. Then when we finally order the time to get our food was average wait time I guess. the waiter brings out our food except for my new sister-in-laws food, she ordered her food specifically a certain way, about 10-15 min after we all had our food the waiter comes up and states there was a mishap with the first order so they had to re-do the order. when they finally bring her food out to her it was totally wrong and had ingredients that were not even asked for (allergies toa certain ingredient) that just made it worse, he then offers her a salad instead, she respectfully declined. 
My aunt's food needed salt, and all they had was sea salt, with her medications she can't have sea salt, so he states let me see if there is regular salt in the kitchen, the idiot waiter grounds the sea salt and puts it into a bowl and brings it out to her and claims it's regular salt. we all looked at it and it was sea salt, had she used it she would have had an alergic reaction and would have gone into shock.
Most italian restarauts i go to they always have nice music playing very low where tou can hear the person across the table talking in a regular voice, this music was on like if we were in a club, and we had to yell to the person across the table and they still couldn't hear you. this was just such a horrible experience, and will never go again.

I would not recomend this place to anyone even if it was the only place open in the casino.",aH62lCC8kOFT4Q4RptNpRA,0,0,1,6Snx-8ybK_8su-rUIcPN-g
64064,2015-07-01,1,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"What an excellent Italian restaurant!
At first, though, you have to absorb the mixed atmosphere of a disco ball, tv screens, music and wall of glass overlooking
the pool.
Once you adjust to the atmosphere, you realize that the owner Steve Martorano is sharing with you his background of food and culture, and it's quite good.
But the most important point here is the quality of the food.
Fresh mozzarella with prosciutto- excellent.
Meatball with salad- excellent.
Homemade lasagna- excellent.
The special ""pescatore""- excellent.
Then, of course, an Italian dinner isn't finished without a homemade ricotta stuffed
cannoli and cappuccino.
Also, I want to give a big shout out to Tara
the restaurant director.  She answered all of our questions and her passion for the food and restaurant was obvious.  
Our server was attentive and made us feel comfortable while we were eating our wonderful meal.
So if you're looking for delicious tasting italian food, white tablecloths and a lively
atmospere, you gotta' come here ""yo cuz!""",SxZurP-9-Zw56Kqjp9Empg,1,1,5,Shog3MNHGZSXdXRbYiXCyA
74385,2014-04-24,0,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"I ate here back in June 2013, the night before I competed in a World Series of Poker tournament.  Since it was located at the Rio, it looked like a good choice.

Having been in the air for over 12 hours that day, I was looking forward to eating something not in a box.  Martorano's really piqued my interest is I am originally from Philly and so is the owner and namesake.  I've tried New York, and the Boston North End, but the Philly Italian restaurants are supreme. Will Matorano's be the same? 

After a consult with my very helpful and friendly waiter, I opted for the $50 prix fixe menu, which was Caesar salad, Veal Cutlet, and dessert.  I also had to try the Meatball appetizer, the true acid test of a good Italian restaurant.

Everything I had was outstanding.  The veal was tender as butter and was seasoned perfectly.  But the meatballs were the high point of the meal.  The blend of meat and the succulent marinara sauce were exquisite.

The server filled me in on Steve ""Cuz"" Matorano.  He is a character -- like something that fell out of a Rocky movie -- but his food is the real deal.

Although I busted out of the poker tournament the next day, I still felt like a winner after eating at Martorano's.",2zpE2DoBibATONhcBCaVCg,0,1,5,vQcmlsufxRNvSYDBil-rog

195415,2015-02-17,0,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"Let me premise this review with the following: (a) my wife and I regularly eat at fine dining establishments; and (b) we ate here on Valentine's Day.  We came to Martorano's with what we thought were realistic expectations based on the restaurant's own comments as well as others.  We knew it was going to be a loud, fun atmosphere, and we knew that the chef himself markets the restaurant with the tagline that he is not a celebrity chef, his food is ""just famous.""

Well, the restaurant is loud.  We were surprised that for Valentine's Day at 6pm it was not crowded.  However, it was still loud.  TVs all over and music playing throughout.  Not really romantic but we expected this.

The wait staff was very pleasant.  We truly did enjoy our server.  The food, however, was only average.  We tried the meatball appetizer and while the meatball was good, it was not the self proclaimed ""best in the world.""

For dinner my wife had the lobster and I had the fish of the day.  My wife originally wanted an item which was listed on the menu online but the waiter said they had removed it from the menu.  Her lobster, while tasty, was a half tail portion the size of her finger.  My fish was very good, but again, for the price, not worth it.

Our dessert was probably the best part.  Cheesecake was marvelous.  Fortunately for us, the waiter directed us to this.  When we were stuck between two choices, he mentioned that the cheesecake was ""100 times better"" than our other choice.

All in all, it was an average meal, but for $250 (we had wine) and on Valentine's Day, in retrospect, I would have passed.  Disappointing.",ten2NnSxIWcAEVUBL8t73A,0,0,3,xDUXNSx1TzXa4YC4Iw8Q5Q
233046,2011-08-04,0,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"I ate here last Saturday night.  While the food was all tasty (we cleaned our plates), I cannot say that I was amazed- I have definitely had better Italian food.  I did appreciate that you could see right into the kitchen, and they even had seats surrounding the kitchen area if your heart so desires.  This gives me a little more confidence that I am eating quality food that was not premade or thrown around in a dirty kitchen.

For me, what really killed this place was the atmosphere.  There are TV's surrounding all the tables which play scenes from famous mafia-like movies.  The restaurant blasts (I repeat, BLASTS) iconic tunes from these movies, but will occasionally put the sound clips of the movies for particularly vulgar scenes.  If the incredibly loud music/clips does not prevent you from having a conversation, the fact that you are surrounded by distracting TV's certainly will.  As a side note, please do not take children here- the restaurant has made the poor decision of  showing very violent scenes (yes- while people are eating?) and does not bleep out the curses when they play sound clips.  Not very tasteful if you ask me.",TgNr6qvg1NK-wf-T2gr1cg,0,0,2,p_-gftvx6Uekp-XSPkiO_Q

284289,2011-11-15,4,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"If you've stayed at the Rio then you've seen the posters for Martorano's.  Big guy, shaved head, tribal ink, and a scowl.  I stay at the Rio 4x or so a year and it's their posters that have helped me resist eating at the restaurant.  As a marketing guy, it was clear that the strategy was to promote this guy's persona and DJ skills rather than focus on the food.

It was a free sample that drew me in.  I was waiting to check-in when a pretty girl came around offering samples of a Martorano's meatball.  I was shocked how good it was...really good...the best I've ever had good... and it was certainly enough to make me want to give the place a try.

Thirty minutes before dinner, I began to have doubts. The reviews for this place were so spotty, I have never heard anyone say anything good about the place, and I wanted to have a great dinner.  Should I risk it? Maybe I should take one more look at the menu.  It all looked good and I was fired up to go there again until I read the end of the menu: ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGES OR SUBSTITUTIONS. JUST LET ME DO WHAT I DO AND DON'T BREAK BALLS.  The ""balls"" thing was kind of Philly-clever and I liked it, but the ""absolutely"" thing reeked of immature hubris. If you're giving it to me, I'll accept that, but since it's my nickle and if my request is reasonable, then it's my way or the highway.  Despite this nagging ""don't do it"" feeling, I decided to give it a shot. Should I have listened to my instincts?

The entrance to Martorano's opens to the bar where it's intimate with a clubby feel.  Before being seated I took a look at the dining area.  Gone was the low light and rich feel of the bar and instead you're treated with a stark open plain and uninteresting room. There's nothing noteworthy about the decor other than there really isn't any. Pretty bland open room.  What I gather is supposed to pass for some kind of industrial minimalist effect simply looks unfinished and incredibly boring. The awesome news is that the dining room blares dance music at ~2 little notches below club volume.  The other reviewers weren't joking; it's loud.  The only other time I've heard music that loud at a restaurant was at a ""rock n' roll"" teppanyaki place where the cooks fling rice at the kid's mouths. BTW, that restaurant sucked as well so I opted to sit at the bar.

Wow, only one other customer at the bar and he's getting his check.  I'm gonna get great service, right?  Hang on....the bartender...let's call him ""Dick""...wants to bus the guy's area before he acknowledges me.  A long 4 minutes later, Dick comes by to get my drink order.  I get my drink and my menu and try to decide what to eat.  I had a few questions about the menu, but Dick is still really busy...intensely focused...tending to his empty bar.  I called out my questions and he yelled back his answers OVER HIS FREAKIN' SHOULDER.  You see, Dick was far too involved going thru the day's tickets and lining up glasses etc to actually look my way, let alone stand in front of me. Clearly I was an interruption to him.  If I hadn't been starving I would've bolted, so in an attempt to minimize my time here I decided to have just an app  - the meatball with a salad.

While I was waiting for my food, Dick continued to amble about behind the bar, not once coming by (and the waitstaff wasn't keeping him busy). The food came. I ate it.  Dick continued to personify his nickname while doing his busy work.  Wait...2 girls just sat down...busy work is over and he's got all the time in the world for a 10 minute flirt session.  Ah...Dick wasn't that busy after all, was he?!  He was just being Dick.

The meatball was again really good, but a gristle in a meatball is JV and I found a gristle in my last bite, so it wasn't that damn good after all.  I got the hell out leaving a far too generous $2 tip...wish I'd left the goose egg.

This is an odd review but it's an odd restaurant.   The dining room ambiance is such an anomaly that the only crowd I believe this restaurant could appeal to are perhaps some teens and young twenty-somethings that like the loud music and probably haven't had a lot of (any?) fine dining experience.  I'm certain this place thrives on Vegas first-timers and unsuspecting others since I can't imagine anyone enjoying an expensive dinner in their dance floor environment.  

Trust the 1 and 2 star reviews.  The bartender appeared to be some sort of manager and with his kind of skills, I'm sure the rest of the food sucks as hard as the service.

A final note:  this is definitely NOT a $$$ restaurant.  If a couple each has a cocktail and splits an app, has a salad and a mid-priced entree with a glass of wine and no sides and no desert, it will cost upward of $180 before tip.  The only way to get out with the $$$ rating is to have no alcohol or under-order.",u1C6Qf5DN5qoqlPFAaSr3g,8,0,1,dYZ1di7n96kVmbwT6pGF8w

437267,2014-09-25,2,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"Overall, horrible experience, but let's break it down:

Food - good.
Ambience - horrible.
Waitstaff & service - slow and unrefined but responsive.
Value - 0 stars.
Bottom line - never bring a large group here.

My job had me in the Vegas area and we (about 10 people) decided to go for some fine Italian cuisine on a Tuesday night.  The guy heading up the evening's plan picked out the place.  I had miss-givings about the ratings on Yelp, but went along.  At around $50-$100 a person, our expectations were for a trendy but refined Italian dining experience.  We dressed in suits and expected a 3-4 star dining experience (formal dining rating system).

Ambience - promised to be great, but collapsed.  Initially, the light effects, soul / R&B music, and classic Casino movie were all positive.  Upon seating, I noted to my wife that we overdressed for the restaurant (2 stars on the formal rating system).  As the evening progressed the ambience went from interestingly artistic to overwhelming and lewd.  The music got so loud we couldn't hear the waiter.  The movie changed to something that should have been X rated (lots of bare breasts and explicit sex scenes.)  There were 5 TVs in sight; all playing the same show.  We all commented on how distracting it was.  The lighting was so dark that they gave out pen lights to read your menu with.  Between the darkness, overwhelming sound volume, and explicitly distracting TVs, the cacophony was at best poor taste.

Wait staff and service - responsive but not refined.  We made reservations for 7:30 and were seated at about 7:45 (not bad for a group of 10.)  The waiter took our drink orders and explained the specials using an iPad (all good.)   The drinks came and we ordered our meals.  About an hour later we noticed that the bread was gone, the wine and water were empty and still no food.  A little after this the waiter came up and apologized for the delay.  The establishment was not busy, but we were a group of 10, so we were not upset - these things happen.  What happened next was odd:  the waiter brought out 9 of 10 entrées.  The missing meal had accidentally been delivered to the wrong table.  We waited 15 minutes for us to all have food before starting.  At this point the ambience was also starting to collapse (see above).  Once we all had food we started to eat and I ran across a 10 inch hair in my otherwise tasty lasagne.  I lost my interest in eating my entrée.  The waiter was apologetic, made my entree complimentary, and offered free deserts for the table (good comeback move).  He also offered drinks ""to compliment the desert"".  The volume level of the music made us mistakenly think he said ""complimentary"".  Unfortunately, it gets worse.  My desert came out first ... then we waited for 15 more minutes for the rest of the deserts to arrive.  We were not amused.  At this point it was 10:30pm.  The evening was shot.  We left around 10:45pm having paid over $900 for the evening's disaster.

Food - good.  Even though the rest of the evening was pretty horrible, I thought the food was good tasting.  The appetizers were tasty with a nice twist and the wine pairing complimented the lasagna nicely.  The deserts were authentic and also good.  Unfortunately the food's taste lost focus when it became cold from waiting and I ran across the hair in my entree.

Value - bad deal.  For a meal in the $90 range, I am looking for a good experience and great food.  Loud music, porn, and clumsy service heavily detracted from what had potential.

Bottom line, don't go here with a large group or high expectations.",zQXg7N7NxM4OJIR7qJr4Sg,6,0,1,THGWly9hJUaXUTy85Jwzzg

Some reviews here seem to disparage the place with insinuations about off the shelf ingredients, etc. I don't know and I don't care. The food was top-notch. Three of us each tried different pasta dishes. Ravioli with hot/sweet peppers, the Pork Gravy pasta, and a veal dish. Each was excellent. Larger portions, but not overly so. Also had the calamari with spicy peppers/sauce. Best version of calamari any of us ever had. Excellent wine list for Italian wines.

I rate the food 5 stars, but deduct one star for the ""ambience"" factor. The restaurant in the Rio doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Nicely spaced tables with white tablecloths, fresh flowers on each table. Pretty classy, but then you see all these flat screens everywhere you look playing gangster movies (Godfather II was playing while we ate), and Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin blaring in the background. We didn't like that.

So, we're in the waiting area, and we see two different parties walk out within 10 minutes.  Within those 10 minutes, we see another couple walk in.  I couldn't hear whether or not they had reservations, but they went right in.  After waiting another 5 minutes, I decided to just stand at the hostess station, thinking that maybe we had been overlooked or forgotten.

Oops, a family comes in (three small children and their paternal units), and gets seated.  I'm standing RIGHT THERE, no meniton of a reservation.  I walk to my wife, sit down, and tell her what happened.  I'm telling her that I'm ready to bounce to eat anyplace else, but she's pleading that we're already there, and to just give them a few more minutes ...

And here comes the hostess, ""We're ready to seat you now."" Really?  You mean a table just somehow opened up?  Would it be next to that lovely family that just came in?  Because I would love to use some colorful metaphors.

Bottom line for me was, the front of the house really spoiled my appetite. As the first person to greet your mostly out of town guests, why would you want to want to alienate even one?  Is the place really that fiscally sound that they can blow off customers?  Since then, my wife asked me once if we could go eat there but I told her I refuse to go back.  First impressions, indeed.

Our server was so terrible.  He was visibly frustrated with us when he asked whether we wanted extra plates and we didn't answer right away (because we were both in the middle of eating).  Our meals came out at different times, so my husband sat and watched his food cool off (I told him he could eat, but he's polite enough to wait).  Then my plate arrived with fingerprints along the edges.  My waiter just stared at me while I wiped down my plate and acted like he was doing me a big favor when I requested another napkin.  At the end of the meal, I mentioned that being served on a plate with fingerprints all over it was very unappetizing, and he just mumbled a completely insincere apology as he walked away.  My husband backed me up by leaving just enough cash to cover the check.

On principle, whenever I don't tip, I always talk to management.  I explained that when you're charging $25 for spaghetti and meatballs, the meal should be served on a clean plate.  I also said that I could even get over that, but when the server doesn't care whether you had a good experience then he doesn't deserve a tip.   I felt better for speaking my mind, but still not so good about dropping $100 for such sub-par service.  Another pretentious restaurant in Vegas.",Eb9p5UOu6G3wCI7AchagGg,5,0,1,mJwuWNhrJazapKLhoqGMzw

769331,2010-05-15,6,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"I have lived and dined in Vegas for over 10 years now, and I have never experienced such a complete joke of an experience as I had when dining here.  I don't believe for an instant that I can adequately convey how disappointed I was or how many horrible attributes this place has.  The nightmares started when we first sat down and didn't stop until we were out the door, and unfortunately there was a long gap of culinary torture in between.

Most of all, this restaurant is the epitome of a ""tourist trap.""  It features an extensive yet grossly overpriced menu and a service staff that was obviously hired based on looks rather than on ability - the two main ""tourist trap"" requirements.

The atmosphere is unlike any place you've ever been, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  It's different because nobody in their right mind would ever build a restaurant like this.  Loud, overpowering music and movie tracks that keep you from being able to have a conversation (and likely designed to also keep diners from being able to complain about the food) combine with disco lights and uncomfortable chairs to make sure there's no way anyone could ever experience a moment of peace while dining.  It's like trying to eat in the middle of a dance floor of a Vegas club, except that people on the dance floor would notice you more than the staff at Martoranos does.

Incredibly slow service, requests that went unanswered, one entree served cold and another served only half-cooked (pasta too, not meat) and all the while an unbearable atmosphere that made us all want to jump up and leave at a dead run.  We should have, because when the bill arrived it was completely outrageous even after they took off the half-cooked spaghetti.

If you go, bring earplugs, aspirin, dark glasses, $200 more than you would expect to spend on any meal, a microwave or warming plate, an air horn (to get the attention of the staff or the person across the table from you) and, most of all, bring a whole heck of a lot of patience. 

I love the Rio and everyone and every place in it, or at least I did until they put this dump in.  Let's hope people start realizing it for what it is and the Rio replaces it with a real restaurant that's not run by an egocentric maniac who thinks that people want everything his way.  Don't believe me?  Look at the menu carefully (both comments and prices) then ask to walk through the ""dining"" area before you agree to sit down.

I was with 6 of my girlfriends, and we sat down at a beautiful table, it was quiet, there were a few other people in the restaurant... and all of a sudden BOOM! Disco balls came down from the ceiling, GREAT old school jams were playing, the waiters were wonderful and super fun, the FOOD was amazingggg (make sure to get the eggplant stack as an app).  

Then, two men came up to our table, chatted with us for a bit, and then bought our entire meal, multiple patron shots, and 2 bottles of wine.  All we had to do was give our waiter a great tip.  It was a fabulous time, great food, and I am going back in a week.

The Caesar salad was a very large portion and excellent. It was a little heavy on the EVOO but that seemed to be a trend here. Granted it is a very good quality oil, so I did not mind. 

The service was real great as well! Table was kept clean, staff was very knowledgeable of their menu, and the remaining staff kept busy and even though it looked a little slow they were working (setting tables, etc). 

The decor and location are why I gave it 4 stars. If this restaurant moved to an on-strip location like the Bellagio, Cosmo, or Venetian/Palazzo I think they would do much better.

They devote a whole portion of their menu to a mozzarella bar. The mozzarella in our caprese was the best that I have ever had. Generally I would say the menu isn't all that revolutionary....lots of fried options and the portions are alot bigger than celeb chef run restaurants (like B&B in the Venetian). I ordered the bucatini all' amatriciana which was perfectly al dente and right on point sauce wise. 

For dessert we got bananas foster with waffles and tiramisu. Both were good but oh my god the bananas fosters with waffles sounded disgusting to me (on the menu) but it tasted really good. By the time I got around to taking a bite of it (we were doing family style among the whole table for dessert) the waffles was soaked with the butter from the caramel of the bananas foster. It was like a waffle with seven layers of butter!",R-g0F6N3ROTdAONBAJpY0A,3,1,4,rsQBOOFnbKAVvK99NKmIDQ
1785564,2010-11-14,0,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"I dined in with my gf on a whim at around 8pm on a Monday night and most certainly regret it. We we definitely not dressed in the typical business casual/business professional attire like the rest of the customers were. I was in jeans, t-shirt, and baseball hat. My girlfriend was in a hoodie and jeans. And let me tell you, our waitress definitely treated us as if we didnt belong there. She glazed through the menu and the specials for us and asked us for our drink orders. We ordered some martinis off their featured list. 10 min later our drinks arrived and she arrived to take our orders.

We decided to do the tasting menu they had available so we could try a couple different things. The Caprese salad came out relatively quick. We both really enjoyed it. It was flavorful and plentiful. Now came the really annoying part. We sat at our table for over 25 min before our entrees came out. The entire time without even a check back from our waitress to see how we were doing. We could see the server station from our table and watched her just sit there talking with other servers and cooks. I got the penne with broccoli and she got the Ziti. My pasta was horrible, no flavor at all. If I wanted pasta with light butter I would have made it at home and saved the $17. The Ziti was much better than my pasta, it had good flavor but was way over portioned with the peppers. I will re-state that even up to this point we still had not seen our server again. There was another waiter (not a waiters assistant) that had to stop and get us refills and check if we were ok. It wasnt until 15min after we had finished with our entrees that she finally came back over and asked us which dessert we wanted to get. 

We ordered the canoli. They were decent but you could tell they were not fresh and the outer part was way too hard and slightly stale. 

Overall the service was definitely the part that completely ruined my experience at that place. Just because I wasnt dressed in my business attire, does not mean we should have been treated any different than those who were. I will never go back and definitely never recommend this place to anyone.",deUPtPgtnZzLvpJIgp1ucQ,0,0,1,LWDXzGK02rY8Vl7XwsGnnw

Date of visit: 5/23/08

We went to Cafe Martorano based on rave reviews from one member of our party (there were 5 of us) who had been there previously. The experience we had was awful. It should also be said that my friend (the one who had been there before) agreed that the experience was awful and the polar opposite of what had happened the last time she came. I have joined Yelp specifically to post this review and hopefully save people from an expensive and altogether disappointing experience. You would be better served spending a similar amount of money at any of the top-class restaurants on the Strip. One big red flag went up when I saw the chef-owner had written on the menu (and I quote): 

""Absolutely no changes or substitutions.  This is how I cook.  Please enjoy and don't break my balls!""

I don't enjoy references to testicles on my dining menu. 

-Initially, they made us wait about 10 minutes for a table. Not bad--until we realized the dining room was empty. Why make the party wait? Another red flag that something was wrong when on a Friday night, there was almost no business.  

-We were invited to wait by the bar, but did not want to have a drink until we sat down--at which point the bartender asked us if we thought we were ""too good for his bar."" As a customer, I don't appreciate being questioned as to why I want or don't want a drink. 

-Upon sitting down, we were asked if we wanted ""sparkling or flat"" water--and wanted flat (or rather, TAP water), not realizing we were buying ourselves bottles of water. Later, the waiter sounded irritated when we asked for tap water, although he did give it to us. 

-We were never offered drinks or dessert. Luckily, by the time we got to dessert, all we wanted to do was get out of there. 

-The wait staff never really checked on us (aside from the one time they refilled our water. when they did come over, they made some snide comment to one of the people in our group. Wait staff was incredibly rude. I guess our first waiter's shift must have ended in the middle of our meal; he just disappeared. I understand that he had to leave, but in most (good) restaurants I have been in, the waiter will at least let you know that they are leaving and someone else wiil be taking care of you. We only realized it when at the end a different waiter brought us our check. (We were not ""checked on"" frequently--or really, at all--as in other establishments.) Customer service is obviously not their forte here. They could take a cue from the bartenders at the casino floor bar downstairs. (At the casino bar, we had wonderful--and fun!--bartenders.) 

-The prices are exorbitant. I understand that in certain fine dining restaurants, you expect to pay significantly more...however, $23 for one shrimp appetizer? That only serves ONE person (according to our waiter.) We would have needed to purchase 5 appetizers (or, $115 in appetizers) to have enough of ONE appetizer for everyone at the table. Maybe I'm wrong, but this is what the waiter told us. I have dined in many fine restaurants all over the world and have yet to feel that I've been so ripped off as I was in this restaurant. Needless to say, we skipped the appetizers. 

-and, for these prices (heck, for McDonald's prices) the service is severely lacking. I hope this point is getting across. 

-and it is, as most people have pointed out, very loud. I liked the music, but it pretty much killed any dinner conversation. Screaming across the dinner table is no fun. 

-the food is actually good, but given everything else that was going on, it was difficult to focus on that. i enjoyed my perciatelli ($23) which was maybe a touch salty but overall tasty with the pancetta. 

 -The kicker: we gave a straight 15% tip because of the poor service--no extras there. They honestly deserved no tip, but in principle our group didn't think that was right. Imagine the shock when my friend who charged the meal checked her online statement and found that they ADDED an extra 5% to the tip--totaling approximately 20% gratuity--despite what she had written as the tip and signed on the receipt. She is complaining to her credit card company today to get the additional charge reversed. 

Bottom line: Stay far, far away. Food is decent, but given the complete lack of service and high prices, you can get a much better experience at other restaurants. Hopefully the Rio management wises up and realized that either this restaurant needs to get more customer-friendly or it needs to be replaced. Hope this helps.",RRvKa87GkVsN5Gu_wzVF9A,5,3,1,L2hJ2TsbRCEKBnkTBtPHRQ

I was with 3 other people and we weren't on any type of budget for dinner so my review is primarily about service and quality.

We got there about the same time as a large group but nonetheless that is no excuse for our entrees to take over an hour to receive.  Our appetizers came out in a timely manner and were very delicious (the meatballs do live up to their rep and the pizza was probably the best I've ever had) but our main courses were a different story.  After waiting for over 30 minutes and seeing smaller parties who ordered after us receive their food before us we were more than displeased.  We spoke to our waiter and he explained that the large group had higher priority than us (I think they just forgot our order).

Our entire dining experience took nearly 4 hours and because of our displeasure, they offered to take a few drinks off our bill.  The money wasn't the problem, it was the service.  Our waiter hardly ever checked on us and we constantly had to ask other staff when we had questions.

Believe the hype! You need to order the MEATBALLS with the Martorano's salad! Please, I beg you. If you're in Vegas and reading this - I'm jealous because you're much closer to heaven in your mouth than me. The salad is magnificently acidic and the meatball is perfection. The other item you must order is the FRIED MOZZARELLA because the spicy San Marzano tomato sauce is absolute crack. I'm addicted! We had these appetizers both nights. They are not light! You could fill yourself up with just the meatballs and mozzarella - you've been warned!

I had the chicken parm my first night and although delicious I couldnt finish. If i ate a quarter, I'd say that was a lot. The second night i had penne alla vodka and although delicious i also couldnt finish. You'd think I learned my lesson. I highly recommend the chicken parm. It doesnt come with pasta but note that it's a massive chicken cutlet. 

Beautiful news: you can order a bowl of sunday gravy so you can soak all of your food in it before you go into your food coma. You must order the bowl when you order your food.

They more than compromise, except on the 3 course fixed price menu, which is more than understandable.
 My wife had the ceasar salad, which was light, but still had the sardine flavor  one would expect. Although, they do not have a children's menu, the appetizer pizza was more than enough for my 9 and 13 year old to share.

I have eaten at some of the best in Vegas as well such as Nove. A restaurant should be judged on a few main categories. Food, Service, Ambiance, Uniqueness.

The reviews about the movie clips playing is just dumb. First of all, don't bring your little kids to a place like this. If you want them to eat somewhere nice then bring them to chain like Chicago Grill or McCormick or any other run of the mill fancy place that you can bring kids to. The movie clips are part of this places character and I think it is awesome to be quite honest. This is a cult classic Italian restaurant with a little bit of punch in the face too it. That is what it is going for and if you want some delicious Italian at a place out of the usual boring run of the mill fancy Italian place, this is where you go.

It seems to me the people reviewing this place poorly have no character themselves and enjoy being bored. Go somewhere boring if something different is not your idea fun.",sqE1aGIzFcapYnSjxE_qPQ,2,2,5,9kISGpO9pShMEVihdQ3VXg
2427050,2013-08-12,2,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"Disappointing to say the least. This is the second time we have been here and I was left not wanting to go back. The service was decent, but the food and the price were really surprising, and not the good kind. We started off with the calamari in the chili sauce, which I think there is a photo on yelp of this dish. The calamari was fresh and so tender, but because it was breaded and then drenched in a TON of sauce, it left it mushy and overwhelming, we couldn't even finish it. Why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish? Usually, you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari, which this doesn't seem to be the case so I just don't get it. It would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle, or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish. 

Next the entree, I ordered veal parm, which was decent but nothing spectacular. The side of spaghetti I got was remarkable, I must say, it was some of the best spaghetti I have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane. Not something I would be willing to drop another $200 bucks on. Again, value for money and while I get this is Vegas, I think so many places in touristy spots don't need to count on repeat business that they don't really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the Rio (where this place is located) the next day.",hnYLAljaNBJQV997tEGj6g,4,1,2,yEzTI1NvHTaLVOqDtDTbtA

After reading an article (years ago) about a woman's search for truly fresh mozzarella, I motivated to find the product of which she spoke.  I order this cheese everywhere it indicates ""fresh"" on the menu and until this dinner, I had not experienced this culinary bliss.  Order it before it is pulled, at which time it takes on the texture of which you are probably more familiar.  It changes the taste, you want the pre-pulled, just drained goodness.  

The meal was very good and deserves more stars than I awarded.  The late seating (New Year's Eve) had us eating at 10-10:30pm, which is just too uncomfortable for me.  However, the reheated Chilean Sea Bass was stupendous.  Portion size of the fish was impressive.  It was served with risotto and saute spinach which were good but otherwise unremarkable, the fish was the star of this plate.  

My low star marks evolve from the atmosphere.  Clearly this turns from restaurant to club around 10pm on most nights.  The sound system must be automatically set to turn up, way up, at this hour.  I could only nod and smile at comments made by my table mates as I could not hear them.  Given no conversation was going on other than the person seated immediately to my side, my attention often drifted to the movies showing on multiple screens.  WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?

I know why.  First of all this is the coolest place to eat. The dining room is surrounded by large screen TVs playing clips from the best movies on the planet. The will have music playing then all of the sudden you hear the best lines from Pulp Fiction, Casino, The Godfather, No Country For Old Men, etc., and the whole restaurant stops eating and joins in.

Awesome. Then comes the food. I would highly recommend tossing the menu aside and let them bring you out a sampling.

Makes for some great atmosphere.

3196132,2014-09-24,1,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"Ok, let's start with the important stuff:  Martorano's food is outstanding.  I am from South Philly (as is the owner) and I have to say that his ""gravy"" and meatballs were excellent.  The service was very attentive and, since I was the only one in my party, the waiter was very kind and patient - willing to answer any questions. 

I started with an appetizer of Italian Meatball and Salad.  I wanted to try both - and if I did it separately, it would have required me to get a second mortgage:  $18 for the salad / $15 for the one meatball (about 1/2 pound).  Both, together, was something like $20.  And both did not disappoint - the meatball was excellent and salad fresh and very well prepared.  (I'll discuss price later.).  Next, I had the Rigatoni ""Sunday Pork"".  This was so good, it brought back memories of the Sunday dinner's where the pork was cooked in with the sauce ($29),  I was too full for dessert.

Now, there are two issues to be aware of:  Pricing and Ambience.  With the price, come on Chef, one meatball for $15??  Anyone from South Philly believes they have the best meatball, including me, and I readily admit yours is excellent.  But, $15??  It was a good idea to pair it with your salad, but, still, an app for $20 is pretty hefty.  The price for the Rigatoni was pretty steep as well.  I know this is Vegas, but I didn't think I would need to go back to the Wheel of Fortune slot to replenish my wallet.

Here is the biggest issue I had (which almost got me to lower to 3 stars):  With regard to the ambiance, I would consider the restaurant area to be romantic - if not for the HDTV's.  There were 3 TV's side by side.  The middle played a video made by the Chef (OK, though a little narcissistic), but the other two were showing the movie Casino!!  UNEDITED!! With subtitles!!!  Which means that, in this dimly lit, romantic room, I'm being treated with videos of blood, brutality and vile language.  Not what I would have chosen.  Really, if you want to show a video, show Italian scenes or something.  Don't show movies - it's not Chucky Cheese!",HVX9cSOIVZ5AeKnnHN4b2g,1,0,4,ln2XN1EUb4H0bLLo2sk9Sg

For a main course, I had the veal marsala.  It was a huge veal chop which was so tender and good.  The gnocchi that came with it were nice and fluffy.  And the mushroom sauce was great.  

My wife had the lobster francaise which was very good as well.  The risotto that came with it was kind of salty and didn't really taste all that great though.  But overall still a good dish.

They made us wait a half an hour for the reservation, and when we went down to the restaurant, had us wait in the bar for another 15 minutes. The bartender was rude and we had a hard time getting drinks. We were finally shown to the dining room, which was about 25% full. Right.
Things LOOKED promising at first: three separate servers came up to our table to say they were part of the ""team"" waiting on us. Then one waiter berated another for talking to us. We asked for a wine recommendation, and were poured an absolutlely AWFUL 2007 Chianti that, if it wasn't faulted, really should not have been on the wine list. We are NOT people who send back food or wine, but there was NO WAY we were going to drink this. We ordered a bottle of California wine that we knew was going to be good.
Then it took a good 20+ minutes to get anyone to return to our table. Our ""team"" of waiters was no where to be seen. We finally flagged someone down to beg them for bread--which we were CHARGED for! 
My BF and I split a Caesar salad (which was the best part of the dinner by a mile) but were brought no extra plates. Nice.
I ordered the pork chop special, which, while cooked properly, didn't have a lot of flavor. Interestingly enough, my BF, who ordered the Red Snapper special, had the SAME salty sauce on his fish! REALLY? Our friend who ordered the Chicken Parmigiana got a piece of chicken with cheese & what appeared to be canned red sauce slapped on the plate--no pasta, no veggies, no presentation whatsoever.

That's how the hotel pushes it's marketing: ""go to our Carnival World Buffet"".  I don't think too highly about the buffet.  In the 90s, it was the buffet to experience because of the quality and price.  Now it's only about the price.  Well, surprisingly, I was surprised that the Rio has one hell of a restaurant on site.


Martorano's!!!!!  I went with three picky eaters.  We normally stay at the higher end casinos like The Wynn or Caesar's.  But we had to stay at the Rio due to Business reasons.  Well, we were tired so we chose this place.  What a great surprise.  In fact, it was the best meal I had during my 3 day trip, although the Wicked Spoon Buffet also ranks up there!

My friends are picky but they all three decided to have the Meatball Salad.  What a weird choice.  Meatball Salad????  But they LOVED it.  It was so memorable that we spoke about it weeks later.

Me on the other hand, I don't like to follow everyone else so I decided to order something else.  I ordered the Bucatini Carbonara.  I love Carbonara.  I've had it in some of the best restaurants.  Beverly Hills, Paris France, New York.  Well, hands down, this was the BEST Carbonara I have ever had.  Wow.  It was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture but my friends would have laughed at me.  They are obviously not a foodie like me and my fellow Yelpers.  The Bucatini, which is a thicker spaghetti, was al dente.  Perfectly al dente.  The Carbonara was delicious.  It had a raw egg yolk on it and you had to pop it.  It goosed out and made the Carbonara authentically delicious.  I added some fresh ground black pepper and it was PERFECT.

I actually think about it.  I recently had Linguini Carbonara at two fancy places in Los Angeles and was disappointed.  Martorano's has set the bar very high for me and has ruined Carbonara for me......unless I'm willing to make the trip to Las Vegas!!!!  This is one instance where ""What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas"".  No......spread the word.

We were one of 5 tables that were occupied in the quiet place at 8p. But that's fine, I understand. 

The meatball was drier than expected, the pasta was undercooked. The chicken parmesean was good, but it was just okay good. The sauce is still awesome. 

I find it interesting to see that almost all of the positive reviews of this place include a mention that Steve was there. Could that improve the quality? Possibly. I watched him inspect just about every dish that left the kitchen at the original location. That definitely didn't happen here.

We started with Martorano's Salad and moved into some apps that I don't quite remember but recall being very happy stuffing them into my face hole. A stack of fried mozz with fresh tomato...more please. The meatballs were heaven, the chicken cutlet (City Chicken Stack or some such thing) was divine and a few others were also wonderful. The one glitch was the underdone rigatoni but no matter. I didn't love the trout scampi style but I'm no fan to cooked fish.   

There are several big screen TVs to around the room showing Italian genre mob flicks like Goodfellas, Casino and The Godfather so that's fun but it is a little loud and obnoxious if you're hoping for a more intimate experience.

First up were their meatball for an appetizer, which you can order with or without a salad, we ordered without & that was one giant, meaty, tasty ball of meat!! For our entrees, my Partner ordered the scallops & they were probably some of the freshest, most buttery, large scallops we've ever had!! Perfectly moist and perfectly cooked! Just, DAMN good!
I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass & let me tell you that was one perfectly amazing plate of food. Fresh, tasty, buttery, flavorful, meaty & perfectly cooked! The Bass was topped with 2 giant grilled shrimps that I believe were some of the best shrimp I've ever had!! The risotto on both of our plates were spot on!
When you're there, disregard the disco lights floating around but while you're at the bar, ask for Nathan, he was the AWESOME Bartender/Server!",sfQXLZGk6beiSuNZYb8iSQ,1,0,4,xEWxpeV9MnFv3i344tOSUA

We didn't have a reservation nor had any expectations, we were here to see the Penn and Teller show at 9 am and want to good eats nearby....also to celebrate a friends 60th birthday that evening.  We thought we give Cafe Martorano a try...glad we did.  The food was delicious and the service was even better.  We each ordered from the prix fixe menu which include a started, main and dessert.  Also order a bottle of red wine and two expresso....all for about $200.00!! That is considered a good deal since food on the main strip can run you more than $75 for fine dining. 

Food:  Ordered their Meatballs, they're suppose to be famous for them (pic).  The calamari with the peppers was delicious (pic), I would go back just for this dish alone!  We brought in our own cake and the server presented with our cannoli.  Made the evening even more special for my friend. Regular menu items are reasonable as well (well reasonable for Vegas anyway!)

Ambiance: White table cloth with five star service, but you can also come in casual as we seen people in flip flop and shorts.  You get the same service.  Overlooking the pool, open kitchen.  Unexpected: The ""Godfather"" was playing on three screen (or maybe more) in the restaurant, which was a little odd, but other than that it was fine as watching a younger Pacino and De Niro was an added bonus to the evening.

I ordered the special which was the Sunday gravy with ravioli which are two of my favorite things! Initially I was just going to do the Sunday gravy with rigatoni but then Yuri came over and told us about the ravioli special. There was no doubt about it I had to try it! My sister got the lasagna which was great it was such a huge portion that she couldn't finish it. And the bread was so crusty and fresh which is great for dipping!

Staying at Rio it's hard to imagine a really good restaurant embedded in this old world Vegas casino however Cafe Martorano surprises you when you dine there.

A clean upscale looking design with fa very friendly staff greeting you at the door.
You immediately get a more hip vibe as your shown to your table. 

Disco music was blasting, Godfather 2 was playing on the video screens ( my all time favorite film so right away they got me) and white cloth tables await your arrival.

The menu is old school Italian fare with their signature meatball at the top. We chose to go with a series of appetizers and salads for dinner.

Here's the scoop on the food

Meatball with Ricotta cheese - great and lives up to the hype

Eggplant Stack- pricey but was by far my favorite dish. Can share between 3 people

Martorano Salad - good crisp lettuce, excellent slices of pecorino Romano, light dressing

Fresh mozzarella with prosciutto - nice dish, not buffalo mozzarella but fresh and served with Prosciutto drizzled with olive oil

Baked clams - they have a bit of a kick with red pepper flakes, not my favorite dish

Cannoli for dessert was very good

Two issues I had with CM was extremely loud environment where even the waiters have to scream to be heard and all our courses came out at the same time. I know we ordered a bit different by ordering all appetizers however it should have been paced a bit.

Overall though, great food and great friendly service overcome the two shortfalls. And oh, Godfather 2 playing, well that just makes the whole experience even better.",vNviupO1hQPaCaaeWM6wnQ,1,0,4,4peyYEvLPhadTUL97LcP3Q

My stomach is still unsettled from last night's dinner.....And so are the stomachs of the other three I dined with.

My suggestion - Go elsewhere in Vegas - anywhere.  For a suggestion as to where to go:

Piero's is far better experience (upscale food and ambiance)  for about the same price.  It's located right off the strip and has been a favorite here for over 30 years.

We are a local Las Vegas family that eats out at good fine dining restaurants regularly.  We know good food when we experience it - and when we don't.

We didn't experience good food here.

Boy were we surprised when the bill came.  I never saw $300 coming.  Now we pay more than that regularly, but never as a surprise.  Here is what we had:

Appetizers:
-2 salads $16 each
- Mozzarella appetizer special (average appetizer price on menu $18)
- Eggplant Stack $23
- Rice Balls $16

Entrees:
-  Plain pasta with tomato sauce (as main dish for one person) $19
- Veal Parmesan $28
- Veal Picatta $30
- Seafood special (Sea Bass with two shrimp) (average entree price on menu $28)

One glass of wine $17
No dessert.

Using prices from the menu for items ordered above, the bill should have been $211

So how did they get it to $300?  (That's 50% more than we expected to pay.....)

The bill was filled with extra charges - for items that the server made sound were included.  For example, I ordered the Veal Parmesan, and asked if pasta came as a side.  When I was told yes, I asked for penne, and was told the chef does not allow substitutions for side pastas.  But they charged $10 for that side of pasta - which I did not eat as it was horrible.  I would have sent it back and asked for it done right if I knew they were going to charge.  

They also charged for extra sauce on a main dish.  I've NEVER seen that happen - EVER.  

And the specials were way above the average price on the menu.  Both Appetizer and entree were $20 each above average menu pricing.  Fine dining restaurants ALWAYS price their specials around the average price of their menu, and tell you when they have something extraordinary that deserves higher pricing.

The service was non-existent.   We were constantly looking for our server when food was missing from the table.  I waited at least 30 minutes from when others received their appetizers to get mine.  No acknowledgement of delay, no explanation provided - until I pointed it out.

And the atmosphere - well what can I say.....Large TV's throughout showing the ""celebrity"" cook on a TV show (he obviously was not in the kitchen).   And about 8 speakers hanging from the ceiling - each the size of a large person - with music so loud that no one could hear each other talk.

Again - avoid this place.  Go anywhere else for better food and an overall better dining experience.",ajvdBbm6TR9KKTBiuv0E8g,2,1,2,7TZPsg7yvp4gSTPsD8VZEQ

In general, though, it was a fairly average Italian restaurant. Prices were a bit high, most likely because the restaurant is in a casino. 

We made reservations both nights and were seated promptly - we definitely chose times before the dinner rush started. Service was similarly prompt and attentive. The wait staff helped with menu selections and based on their recommendations we split the chicken parm the first night. When paired with a side of spaghetti (which was incredibly overpriced given the portion size) and a salad it was more than enough for the both of us. The next dinner we both tried the meatballs, which had a nice taste to them and were accompanied with a light sauce. 

Another benefit to eating ""early"" (6-7 pm time frame): The music was at a tolerable level. We were worried about the noise when we first read the Yelp reviews, but it wasn't an issue when we were there. They apparently gradually turn up the volume as the evening draws on, so if you want to be able to chat with your dining companions, you might want to dine before things get too loud.

They do have a person going table to table asking if you would like your picture taken. That might be a turn off to some people, but it didn't bother us. The woman was very friendly and we chatted for a while. From what we saw from other tables, she wasn't high pressure: Tell her ""no thanks"" and she is off to another table.

I'm a foodie and know for a fact I could cook proteins better than the head ""cook"". I know for a fact there are better tasting pastas from Sysco. I also know when I can taste a marinara that has a base of canned tomatoes yet it's called ""homemade"".. I know for a fact that Lipton style instant Iced Tea out of a plastic bottle doesn't cut it as a drink in a restaurant of this price range. 

I've traveled Italy, ate at some of the best Italy has to offer and I have a moderate respect for the cuisine, but even if I do over look the under cooked pasta and a horribly dried out meatball and bring it all down to flavor, this place still just doesn't cut it and dont even get me started on the service.. 

We tried this place on a whim before the Penn and Teller show as it looked to be the closest thing to fine dinning at the Rio, but we should have known better when there are TVs playing the God Father all over the place.. The Rio really needs to up their dinning game.

THE ROSES: Fun concept, especially in the bar. There are a battery of large TVs above the bar that offer you a selection of sports and better gangster flicks to watch while you wait for your table. While I was there, I enjoyed scenes from ""The Godfather, Part II"", and ""Copland"". Given the noise level in the bar, it would be nice to have the closed captioning turned on, though; there is no way in heck you're gonna hear the dialogue. Food is actually quite good; served family-style (at least on my visits), everything was uniformly quite tasty and well-presented. Service is quite good as well.

THE THORNS: Very loud; not the place you want to go for a quiet, intimate meal. The other big thorn is that while the food and service are quite good, I honestly do think the prices are a bit steep for what you're getting. Unfortunately, this is the New Vegas Model; where the casinos used to offer great dining deals to get folks in the door, these days the larger casinos apparently have no problems packing the suckers in, so they can charge quite a bit. I dined on an expense account, but if I had to pay my own way, I'd have gone elsewhere, as I honestly felt the value for (my) money wasn't there.

THE VERDICT: Loud, boisterous, fun place with great food, but steep prices create a poor Value Factor and so I have to detract at least 1 star.

If you're dining on someone else's dime, have more money than you literally know what to do with, or if the Rio is comping you, by all means go; otherwise, as they say in the mob movies, 'fugheddabboutit'!",BaOFMm3cs-yEnOdTej3jDg,2,0,3,mZFgnloMlvm-FIghNJO5MA

4484289,2010-07-28,3,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"Muscle man Steve Martorano serves overpriced East Coast Italian food at his restaurant in the Rio, where we dined with our foodie friends on Sunday evening. Although nothing we had was bad and everything was well-seasoned, I still left with a bad taste in my mouth due to the prices and the atmosphere. Let me give you a mental picture: disco balls, neon lights, over-sized outdoor garbage cans in the bathroom, and blaring music only turned off so you can watch an equally loud scene from the original Ocean's Eleven on one of six flat screens. The light/video/music show is all orchestrated by DJ Martorano himself, who spends more time annoying his customers with noise than paying attention to their food.

His menu is as beefy as his arms, so I would advise vegetarians to stay away. I actually give him credit for his unabashed use of meat, which he prepares well. Since we were a group of four and didn't feel like eating a ton of food, we ordered a bunch of appetizers to split. Their meatball, which they are famous for, is light with balanced meatball elements. It is served with tasty marinara and excellent ricotta, though these features can't justify the $14 price tag (or $18 if you want a microscopic salad to go with it as we realized after the fact).

We then ordered pigs feet, a dish I would say was the highlight of the meal because I don't generally eat pigs feet and they seemed to be prepared well. But it's also possible my enjoyment was due to the abundance of that San Marzano marinara or the relatively inexpensive price ($10). The feet themselves were not terribly meaty, but the accompanying rolled pig skin stuffed with pork was quite enjoyable (if eaten only a few bites at a time) and tasted like thick, chewy pasta (if pasta was pure fat). 

Other above average options included; the eggplant stack, which was crispy but heavy, and not served hot ($19); the gnocchi side, which was light enough but not terribly interesting ($14); and the hot peppers stuffed with veal that I enjoyed, but felt had a bit too much crushed red pepper ($18). He also offers an interesting take on carbonara, which he sent to our table gratis because we are locals (Always tell restaurants on the Strip you are local when making a reservation. They usually do a little something extra for you). I can best describe his preparation as spaghetti (though the waitress called it buccatini) tossed in a white bean hummus. The flavor was fine but it had an off-putting mouth feel, and was not worth the $24 price listed. I'm not sure how he can get away with these prices for dishes that are essentially superior preparations of adulterated versions of real Italian food... 

P.S. Don't let the waitress talk you into a specialty cocktail. They taste worse than a melted tropical concoction from Fat Tuesdays. And, if you still want to come, do so before 7:30 or you won't even be able to have a conversation with yourself.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,4,4,3,3LB0p3CXCyRisqynW119EA

Facility:  it is inside the Rio. I liked the decor...it seems a little more high end than it is. It's pricey, but they show casual movies and clientele are in shorts, t-shirts, and tennis shoes.  All tables and chairs and some bar seating. 

Service:  the hostess was rude, treated us like we were bothering her, and ignored me when I was talking to her.  Great first impression!!!!  
Our waiter, Ben, on the other hand was amazing!!!  He was so friendly, helpful and professional. 
The manager came over and asked how the meal was, and as I told her the pasta was a tad under al dente, she talked right past it. Why ask of you don't care?!

Food:  Well, hmmm...what to say.  It was decent.  Some things amazing!!!  Some things not so amazing. 
Bread and oil - 5/5 loved the fresh warm bread and different choices of oil and butter. 
Spicy Calamari appetizer - 5/5 the best!!! I loved the flavors of the sauce on this dish. The calamari flavor was overpowered, but they were crispy and I don't care, because the sauce is so good. 
Meatball and ricotta on bread - 3/5 it was good, but not amazing. The flavors just didn't impress me and this was the signature of the place....the meatballs. 
Carbonara - 2.5/5 the waiter raved about this one. He said people from Italy say it's comparable - nope!  Italy is waaaayyyy better. It was bland to me.  It needed salt and the pasta was undercooked. I like al dente, but this wasn't there yet. I did love that they left the egg yolk for me to stir in. 

Overall - nice place, food was decent, but not sure I would be happy to pay $100 without the comp for what we got.  They do have 25% off for locals, so maybe I'll come back and try something else.  But not anytime soon.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,5,3,3,2BmlT7-dFRUOxA3meLenaA

My mouth waters for them even now. Their spaghetti had a wonderful marinara with great toasted garlic and chili, it was top notch on every level .
Staff was great and attentive. I spent years mocking the owner because he looks like a juiced up guido from the jersey shore, and I thought what does he know about food?

Arriving to the same look and feel from their other two locations in South Florida, I have to admit other than poking my head inside at the Hard Rock Location, I had not yet tried any of the locations for a dining experience.  I have read mixed reviews from everyone and spoken to many persons in and about south FLA who either swear by the place or think it should be black listed. I thought I'd give my own opinion after this event. Arrived as stated Sunday night 9PM very empty for a Holiday weekend, and I'm guessing the Rio Location is the cause. If this place was in one of the more mainstream malls you probably couldn't get into the place.  After some drinks with Bethany at the bar, we moved to our appointed table 5 of us to dine this evening. 

Scott our friendly waiter gave us a rundown and we ordered up some appetizers that showed up in no particular order or together but this is the way it's done as I understand everything fresh & hot.  Homemade Meatball with gravy and ricotta cheese $14, South Philly Cheese steak with caramelized onions and American cheese on a crisp Italian roll $16 and Eggplant Stack with homemade mozzarella, tomato and arugula $23 were the 3 appetizers we chose to share.  Bread was hot and fresh and every single one of the above were 100% on the money. 


We decided on 4 entrees for dinner to split for 5 persons. First was Shrimp Scampi Bread with butter, garlic, tomato, peas and bread crumbs $18 which was an appetizer order that we asked to be bumped up to 5 jumbo shrimp one for everyone.  Veal Cutlet Parmigiana with tender cutlet of veal and fresh mozzarella $30 a Linguine and Fresh Clams in light red or natural white juices $25 and the absolute last but not least Rigatoni with a Sunday Pork Gravy made with fresh pork, San Marzano tomatoes and ricotta cheese $28.  


All I can say is there was not one single solitary thing left in any plate, the food was absolutely delicious on every level, and although I was told family style meant large portions (They aren't) it was a sufficient amount of food to go around.  Two bottles of wine were consumed on moderately priced list, and the 70's disco music in the place was absolutely perfect.  Scott was an Excellent server and giving my own unbiased opinion this was a winner from every vantage point that I can find.   A definite repeat for me on my Vegas runs and will give the Original South Florida location a go when I get a chance.

Also, we weren't really prepared for a nice meal at a candlelit table, so this was just fine. (We were misleaded by the CAFE in the name). 

We ordered a Ziti with Hot and Sweet Sausage and Penne and Vodka. (from Rio webiste; official website does not have updated menus). Both were very good with big portions. We also had a side of bread with some dips that were interesting. There was the usual olive oil, but there was also a spicy dip, kind of like chinese spicy hot sauce (weird, not really my kind of dip). The service was spot on... the bartender would refill our water glasses when needed and checked on us periodically.

Service was adequate but not what you would expect for the prices on the menu.  The atmosphere was not appropriate in our opinion; the music and the movie clips (bloody scenes from Casino and other mob type movies) just did not make any sense to us for a place to feel comfortable eating.
Caesar salad was well dressed with a good dressing and croutons, and was a very nice sized portion, enough to share.
We (tried to) split the stuffed clams appetizer, but only 2 of our party could eat it because it was so greasy and way too spicy.  I love stuffed clams but have never tasted any with quite as much red pepper as they put in it.
For the main dishes, one person in out party ordered the Chicken Parm.  It was a decent sized piece of chicken, but for 24 dollars it comes all by itself on a plate, no side of pasta or anything.  I have heard of the a la carte menu items on a steakhouse menu but would it really be hard to add a little mound of pasta?
The chicken marsala and gnocchi were pretty tasty, even though the chicken was on the salty side.  They are very heavy-handed on the salt and cheese, especially the ricotta scoops they put in the bowls of spaghetti and meatballs, which a few of us had.  The pasta was cooked nicely, the sauce was very one-note in my opinion, and the 'famous' meatball was just average.  My mom has been making it better for years, and everyone at the table agreed.

We were told the way would be 25-30 mins are were surprised when barely 15 mins went by and we were seated in the loudest restaurant I've ever been in. There were five of us and we sat at a large round table and could not hear each other other across the table without shouting and making hand signals. It was ridiculous, although we made the best of it and mostly just laughed at each other trying to understand what the person next to us was saying.

After asking the server to repeat what he had said six times we asked how he managed to keep say in a place so loud. He said he used to wear earplugs. I asked if people complain often, and he said yes, but the chef, this Martorano guy, apparently says if people don't like it, they can just leave. Great business model. 

What was even stranger was the movie breaks that came on the TV. A loud, obnoxious song would be playing, and then some iconic clip from a movie would start playing and it was so, so distracting. Don't go hear if you'd like to have a conversations with your tablemates.

The service was okay, but not great. Our server forgot to give us the specials menu after we asked for it and came to take our order and we reminded him of his error. He also forgot an appetizer we had ordered. Who knows if he was just forgetful, or couldn't  hear us.

The food was good, but over-priced, even for Vegas. It didn't blow me away and I could get cheaper, better made food on the strip. I don't need to pay $18 for a meatless entree with canned tomatoes, a leaf of basil and a few cloves of garlic.

We started with the Calamari in sweet chili sauce which I thought was horrible.  It was a really easy way to ruin calamari.  Two of my friends liked it, and one thought it was edible.  I guess the deal with this restaurant is that Mr. Martorano knows Italian food and he makes it the way he likes it.  I am NOT rushing to eat dinner at his house.  It was a very Northern Italian style that was heavy on the meat.  His famous meatballs are a mixture of veal, pork, and beef.  I don't eat veal and I'm not really a pork eater so I was not interested there.  The rest of the menu was really lacking.  There was no gnocchi or risotto, only one fish option, and really no salad.  I think if I want some spaghetti, I can make that at home (and better).  So most of the entrees are around $20-$25.  When the waiter said that there was a special of Chilean sea bass, I decided to go for it.  It did come with some awesome spinach with huge chunks of garlic and the herb crust was good, but the sauce was drowning the fish.  It was really heavy.  Although it was my fault for not asking, I was REALLY surprised to see that the sea bass was $48.  The service was seriously lacking as well.  We told our server that we had show reservations and needed to be in and out quick, but he was really slow and often seemed confused about what was on the menu and maybe even just life in general.  He also did a weird crumb relocation rather than cleaning before the main courses arrived.  He started to scrape up the crumbs, but just left the piles he made on the table.  He also started to tidy up a little spill, but half way through just left it.

The bread and variety of dipping choices was yummy, the presentation of the food we ordered was beautiful and the complimentary scallop that the cute waiter brought my daughter for her birthday made me scratch my head.

I told my daughter to smile and say thank you, its not every day a girl gets a scallop for her birthday - even tho she is hella cute!

I find that when I dine at fancy Italian restaurants that I'm hungry not long after - the food is very good but they don't really give you hearty portions.  Or, perhaps I'm just a pig.

This place is expensive so don't be bringing your friends who would have rather had McDonald's here - I swear if I see one more person in my daughter's party roll their eyes at me over the price I'm going to throw a scallop at them!

Cafe M - work on your mixed drinks for me - my twins will be 21 in eight years and I'd like to actually catch a buzz over dinner next time I'm in town.",PrqhlhGVjq5FuaM9pW6Enw,3,3,4,VuOZTyswLxcJeNrragOf1g

Seriously.

Who are you people that are leaving 5 star reviews for this joint? Saying it's the best Italian food you've ever had? Seriously?! Are you from Iowa? Have you ever actually had Italian food at somewhere other than the Olive Garden? How can you possibly say this is the nicest restaurant you've ever been to?!  So many questions.  Look, maybe I'm a snob. Ok, I'm probably a snob, but what sort of witchcraft is happening in these reviews? Dangit, that was another question. 

Tonight, I'm staying at the Rio, so a friend came by and we decided to hit up the most delicious place ever for dinner: Hash House A Go Go. Alas, the Rio Hash House isn't open at any reasonable hour (despite the lies Yelp spreads), so we had to improvise. Italian sounded good, so despite the kind of high prices, we decided to give Martorano's a shot. 

First thing's first: it's a Monday night, not Saturday. I see open tables with my eyes. The girl up front asks if we have a reservation, we say no, and she says there's a 30 minute wait. But. . . there are open tables. . . right there. . . ok, fine. 

We wait. We wait 45 minutes. They finally sit us down.  We order some waters and sodas. The waiter brings back our drinks. . . and tiny plastic soda bottles. You know the ones you put in like, a kid's lunch? The little shorty, half size soda bottles? That. No free refills, because our sodas came from tiny little bottles (THAT THEY CHARGED US $3.50 CENTS A PIECE FOR). 

Fine. Whatever. We  go to order dinner. I tell the waiter I'd like the 'Chicken Downtown' and he immediately asks if I'd like to order something to go with it. I ask what he means. ""It just comes with like, you know, a big chicken breast with stuff on it. Nothing else."" Oh, so you're charging $30 for a literal piece of chicken with nothing on the side. 

Needless to say, I switched over to pasta carbonara. The bread they bring is good, the olive oil is nice, but the pepper olive oil they bring is. . . not good. It was simultaneously needlessly spicy in a not flavorful way and kind of dull tasting (don't ask me how that makes sense). The Carbonara was alright. We both agreed that had our entrees been $15-$18, we wouldn't be complaining. . . but it was $27 for a bowl of carbonara.  The food isn't bad-- don't get me wrong-- but it ain't great. 

The service was meh. The waiter gave off a definite 'bro' vibe and wasn't very attentive. The guy who handled bread and water though was phenomenal.

The decor is very. . . look, you can tell the owner used to be a DJ. Probably in the 90s. It's just a weird vibe. Flashing lights in dated colors, Godfather posters, disco balls, and then tv screens playing The 300 (???). Look, I can dig Vegas tacky, but if I want that kind of Vegas tacky, I'll hop my butt over to the Fireside Lounge in the Peppermill, thank you very much. 

Now before you think I'm some sort of tasteless pleb, I assure you that I've got no problem paying much more than even that for diner. . . if it's worth it, but this place is NOT worth it. Not by a long shot. And in Vegas of all places? You have so many more options in that price range. 

I'm Italian American and I love quality Italian food. . . but this place ain't it. Don't waste your time and certainly do NOT waste your money. Not in Vegas, not when there are some of the world's best restaurants (even at this price range!) right down the road. 

You want some good Italian? Take a cab to Nora's on Flamingo (#1 on Yelp and half the price!). Or if you want the real good stuff, take a cab a little farther to the other side of the Strip and hit up Sergio's on Tropicana. It's kind of old and tacky and ridiculous. . . but holy mother of goodness, it'll be the best vodka sauce you'll ever have. Oh, and they even refill your sodas for free.


EDIT TO ADD: Sorry, I'm deducting a star. Both me and my dining companion ended up sick today (the next day). She actually threw up, I just felt like I was going to for the better part of the day. I literally ate nothing else yesterday but that dinner + some Starbucks in the morning, so it pretty clearly made us ill. Blech.",Ll_IZTr6GnZC8SfpEU-dKg,16,5,1,UY96KC59ieKct6xMxErwjw
5535814,2015-04-28,1,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"Wow...this place should not have almost 4 stars.  First off this place was had to find, in the corner of the rio, and empty when we arrived.  Should have gone with our gut and left based on how empty it was. 

Ordered a couple drinks to start, including a dirty martini and an old fashioned.  Two very standard drinks but could tell bar tender was an amateur.  Very poorly made.  

Before dinner we ordered the Ceprese tomatoe salad with warm mozzarella.  This was the only redeemable value the restaurant had to offer.  

For dinner my wife and I split the veal.  This entree was horrible.  It was a very thin layer of veal, topped with a huge amount of bell peppers covered in cheese.  It was like bell peppers with a hint of veal.  Just gross. We ordered a side of gnocchi but the brought spaghetti instead.  Realized there mistake and within 5 minutes brought out the gnocchi, which was disgusting.  Very chalking tasting if that makes sense.

After paying over $140 for two people....we were not impressed at all.  I also didn't like the fact that had bottle of wine and marinara sauce placed all over the bar that was for sale.  I hate when restaurants try to up sell.  Especially when it's not good.  Definitely wouldn't come back, one star all the way.",8Lq0UFN3az60KZIAwQHJpg,1,0,1,HYJIyZYWK6YiJJAoavN3Ow

I liked the trendy atmosphere very much. We were by the window with a view of the Rio pool. They have TV's there which were showing old movies and the videos of the owner showing you (what looked like) cooking lessons.
Our waitress was friendly. She showed us images of the specials on a tablet- which was a big help, and probably the first time I didn't space out when someone went over the specials of the day.

The food was great. The bread brought before the meal was excellent and since we got there right when it opened, it was nice and warm.
I started with fried calamari (San Marzano version) and thought it was great.

I had chicken parmesan, and again, it was excellent. Though, after the bread and the fried calamari, I was stuffed. I might not have a starter next time.

I also bought some of his marinara sauce which is sold by the hostess desk.

Sure, my review is probably biased. I ate for FREE.
Sure, my review is probably biased. I ate FOR FREE!!!

Then again, perhaps my review ISN'T so biased, as I would actually pay my own money to go back here.

Since I became old enough to gamble, I was a fan of the Rio. Why? I don't know, but I just had really good luck gambling at the Harrah's casinos (back when it was just Harrah's and Rio in the lineup).  Of course, with lady luck shining down on me with all her glory, I'd up my antes and win even bigger.  With that came the VIP treatment, for shizzle. After my second trip, I was somehow put in touch with a host, and thus began my long and beautiful relationship with the Rio.

Okay, so Rio sort of lost its charm as I got older, but my all-star host Derek was so great that I couldn't be disloyal and stay anywhere else.  Then again, he DID give me free rooms all the time.  Minor details, I promise.

Derek has moved on to bigger and better things, so I haven't actually been back to the Rio in awhile, but the last time I went, Derek treated me to an AWESOME dinner.  Usually, we go to the buffet (because I used to love the Carnival Buffet), but that particular visit, Derek was incredibly insistent on taking me to the new Italian place that had just opened.  Beggars can't be choosers, so I decided to just roll with it.

And boy, am I glad I did!  Again, I don't know how much any of the dishes cost, as I didn't pay for any of them, let alone look at the menu.  All the wait staff knew Derek personally (apparently, he dined here often), and were quick to serve us up with everything we could possibly need.  Derek just said, ""Bring us all the good stuff,"" and like that, magic happened at our table.  Three different kinds of pasta, a little steak something for me, random meatball thingies, and I don't even know what else.

Here's the thing.  I don't like Italian food.  I generally find it too heavy.  And another thing.  Derek himself is of Italian heritage.  When Derek first sat me down, he said, ""Look, I NEVER eat out Italian because nothing compares to my grandma's cooking. But this place is THAT good.""  Did I believe him?  No. I thought this was some weird promo that he was pulling on me (which is unlike him).  But no. After my first few bites, I was TOTALLY SOLD.  Everything was scrumptious, tasty, and definitely not too heavy.  As Goldilocks once said after eating Baby Bear's soup, ""This is JUUUUUUST right~""

The appetizers, entrees, and desserts were ALL amazing.  But the piece de resistance of this place is the DECOR AND AMBIANCE.  Holy cow!

At first, I was confused when the lighting changed from violet to blue.  Were my eyes playing tricks on me?  I was too busy savoring my meal to care if I was going blind.  Then the blue light changed to red.  What the???  That's when I realized that the lighting in the room continuously changes color, dissolving slowly from one color to the next!  It adds a totally colorful and fun element to the whole modern decor, and jeebus, the movies!  Okay, so I'm not a classics-enthusiast in general, but it was really cool to have the music and the lighting interrupted periodically for a short showing of classic scenes from classic movies like the Godfather and whatnot!  Totally a cool and unexpected touch!  The DJ played good (if loud) music, and the staff was totally friendly and enthusiastic!

The best part?  I got to go to the kitchen to see where the magic happens.  Derek introduced me to the chef (he looks incredibly like Vin Diesel - another Las Vegas impersonator?), and he was totally friendly and exuberant.  Just my kind of guy!

This place was freaking awesome.  The experience was freaking awesome.  The fact that it did zero damage to my gambling funds was freaking awesome.  When (and I don't mean IF, I mean WHEN) I go back, there is no way that I'll be able to afford such a varied sampling (I think we had like 10 different plates on our table at one point) of all the scrumptious goodness, but I will be sure to try something different every time, just to get my fill!

Are you thinking about dining here?  DON'T HESITATE.  DO IT.

5838499,2008-05-30,5,NRn6yqCq3yAh7NtKBt79xQ,"Based on the reviews, it seems you either love or hate this place.  

That's what originally drew me to it, i had just checked into my hotel some firends and family to celebrate my 21st, and in amongst some downtime and getting unpacked, i immediately started thinking about where to go prior to the nights out that were soon due to come.  So i opened ""THE BOOK"" in The Hotel and while flipping through the pages i noticed an add for an Italian Cafe that had the picture of a big guy (Vin Diesel Looking) and a 2 paragraph dissertation on how his cafe became.  

The long and the short of the ad, is that he loved to cook since he was young, so he calls himself a cook not a chef, and does things his way.  Basically the story said;
 A customer came in once and was insisiting that he turned down the music, and he politely said ""Sir, this is the image that my restaurant upholds and what we are, so i'm sorry i cannot do that."" The customer became extremely mad and began to demand and yell at the owner, and the owner told the man to get up and GTFO!  As soon as i was done reading that, i was sold, ""This was a place i must check out"", mainly becasue it's rare that people and restaurants now a days still have a backbone, and don't let people walk all over them.

The theme of the restaurant is his way or the highway, where from 5-7pm music like sinatra is played, then from 7-8pm it's 80's music, and then from 9-close is club style hip hop since the restaurant turns into a 1/2 club at night.  And throughout any of this, the music will pause, the lights will dim and all of the many plasmas on the walls will show one of his favorite scenes from one of his favorite moives (casino,the godfather, knockaround guys.....) and then quickly before anything gets too gory the music resumes and the lights come back up. 

The food, is the best hands down italian food i have ever had and 1/2 of my family is from a little family owned city in northern italy called consa.

We ordered the chef's choice which is an (5 course) assortment of food both on and off the menu, and whatever the owner/cook feels like making.  It was a bit pricey ($125 pp for chefs choice) but i know there are other things for sub $30 and $40 on the menu, plus it's vegas, what isn't pricey if it's not good, i mean really good.  You get what you pay for and you're not in vegas all the time, so indulge a bit.  We also had a personal wine concierge that helped us select wine throughout the meal, and our waiter who's name was meatball was extremely helpful in preparing us for what we were about to experience (the most food in one meal i have ever seen).  One of my personal favorites was the crab and lobster stuffed shellfish (that was not on the menu).  Holy mother that was good!  They also have a more than capable bar, and you can take a photo with ""the cook""

All in all, it was hands down my favorite place to eat in vegas, and i will definately be returning when i go back there.  If you want some killer italian food, and a memorable atmosphere, you must make a stop here.",3AOuFaEvafDQ9W5Lr2WQXw,7,7,5,6mWVzjz3xAaHFQ9_1OzIEA

They closed the restaurant to accommodate over 200 of us.

It over looks the swimming pool.

Here's the rundown:
The Best Meatball & Salad ""Signature Martorano Meatball"" I have to say, the meatballs are really good. It  was serve with ricotta which made it taste better. The salad it came with was just okay. 

Fried Calamari w/ Sweet & Spicy Chili Sauce   This dish was my favorite of the night. Nice size calamari. Perfectly fried. That sweet & spicy chili sauce was dynamite. So good. Thinly sliced Serrano chili rounded this dish nicely

Fried Mozzarella Stack ""Tomatoes, Prosciutto di Parma, Aged Balsamic Vinegar & Extra Virgin Olive Oil"" This was another winner. A thick piece fried nicely and tasted great with the prosciutto and balsamic vinegar. Yum!!

Rigatoni Pollo ""Diced Chicken Cutlet, Hot & Sweet Peopers, San Marzano Tomatoes & Reggiano Parmesan Cheese"" the rigorous was a bit too Al dente for me. The taste was good, just not pasta part for me. 

Chilean Seabass Scampi Style w/ White Wine, Garlic Butter, Peas & Cherry Tomatoes. The Seabass was just so buttery, melt in your mouth delicious. The white wine sauce complimented this dish 

Chicken Downtown ""Chicken Cutlet, Ricotta Cheese, Spinach, Mushrooms, Vine Ripe Tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella"" a nice well rounded dish. Crunch from the chicken cutlet and a very flavorful sauce.

Red Velvet Cake. The cake was very moist with a cream cheese frosting. A nice way to finish our meal. 

The service was excellent. Sparkling mineral water was refilled constantly. Plates cleared efficiently. Dishes explained as they are served.
