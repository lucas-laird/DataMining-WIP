The guy I always see behind the counter always has a smile on his face and offers samples of the newest menu additions. 

The Smoky Bros is my go-to with smoked cheddar and a two meats, similar to a club. They also offer hot sandwiches and a variety of wraps for low-carbers- I heard they're still perfecting their lettuce wraps though, which is what I'm really holding out for. Check back in soon, they're adding rolled ice cream to the menu.

The restaurant is nice and clean with a screen t.v and music playing in the back ground. We ordered the Italian sandwich on white bread. The bread tasted very good I know it was homemade bread when I tasted. I also tired the macaroni salad it was also very delicious. We ordered the ice cream rolled and it didn't disappoint us at all. Overall everything was very spectacular. I will definitely return to this restaurant and try out other menu items that this place offer.,UX5z0n2dJT4mY03u533evA,1,0,5,BkXR5eEFvzeoxmekiRrafw

The owner was super charming and gracious as he handmade icecream in the spot for each of our group with his anti-griddle setup. Watching the icecream being crafted in front of us was such a fun experience. The chocolate was outstanding and the cookies and cream was so lovely and the texture is so perfect.
