The  Good:
Wonderful restaurant,  the food is  delicious.  The juice bar is on point.  The  tress leches whole cake is wonderful (8 inch 16$)!  We actually have come here to eat a few times this past couple weeks already!  The meats and produce are very reasonable. They were recently having a sale with 4 cases of coke for 11$.  Yes this market is competitive with prices.  The store is also clean, and organized.

The  Bad:  
Well such a wonderful spot is sure to draw a crowd, and it does.  The line to order food can run a long while, and after ordering you have another wait time, in all it can take up to 20 mins to order your food and then wait. This usually is in the afternoon, when I have seen it most busy.  Also the line in the meat department can be pretty intimidating. I went there and was going to oder some ranchera meat,  saw the line and turned the other way. 

Overall, yes I love this spot to eat, but if I was going to go grocery shopping I  would probably come in the early opening hours or before closing to avoid lines.",6vtS_KYtFFnJny0o8haEuw,3,0,5,5zemM_we92EKbmPik86CEA

I went home and put in my fridge. On Sunday morning when I went to get meat out something smelled really bad. I opened the other meats and they were fine but the chicken reeked so disgusting. I can't believe they sell their meat about to go bad. Maybe health department needs to go inspect their facilities.  I don't believe I will be going to back to this store!!,uTLdtYe4vFhIyr1FhSgVHg,0,0,1,5efAgoGZhYDKjUo4HIHpYQ

1643266,2017-08-21,0,CyU3l-0QfH2boVmYAP-o1A,Gringo review inbound. I like this market because it's so needed in this neighborhood. The closest Mexican super market is 16 minutes away and that's too far! The meat counter here is supreme. For white folks that are intimidated simply speak English promptly and every worker will speak English with you no problem. If you're not Mexican do yourself a favor and acquaint yourself with the different types of prepared carne asada and jump for the one you like when it's on sale. I've seen some of the cheapest meat and produce prices in town here. It's worth a shopping trip for sure.,5Q3J19sYxOMqXtQklNo50g,2,2,5,QQJjZOo2CqEkltV9nOlnsg

I love Latin supermarkets. For the most part, the prices are on par with Asian markets, but the places are usually much cleaner, and the staff more helpful, plus no surly attitudes. I don't mind the attitudes, as I'm used to it (it's just kinda our culture) but it's nice to see some smiling faces sometimes.

My favorite parts of these types of markets are always the bakeries. They have so many kinds of Mexican sweet breads and all the ones in the big case are only $0.60 each. They have about a dozen other kinds that are priced higher than $0.60 and those are in the cases.

There's also a large ready made food to go counter, a juice bar, a salsa bar and plenty of seating. I have yet to try the ready made food but they have tons of options. Next time.

For sure don't forget to check out the produce section. Today they had the hugest Fuji apples I've ever seen, 2 lbs/$1. As I walked by I thought to myself, ""Damn those are some big apples! I should get some."" Then a girl came by and said, ""Wow those apples are big!"" And then another guy, ""Shit those are huge."". LOL Yeah they're big ass apples.

For opening weekend, they were pretty busy, but parking lot was easy to get in and out of, and checkout lines were plentiful, and wait minimal.

This is a great option if you live in the North West part of town, and previously Cardenas near the Meadows Mall was the nearest good Mexican supermarket. We'll be stopping by again soon for sure.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,5,3,4,vysqw3e-qhQezAblQWLBNg
2263286,2017-03-05,8,CyU3l-0QfH2boVmYAP-o1A,"We love having La Bonita so close to home! My first trip here was just to check it out and buy some bolillos and queso fresco, but I came back with my husband a couple days later to stock up for the week. If you're looking for deals, there are plenty to be found.

I haven't tried anything from the hot foods area because meat is definitely the focus, but I really like the juice bar. I've enjoyed aguas frescas and fruit salad here and they also offer fresh blended juices. The mixed fruit bionicos with apples, melon, kiwi, and strawberry (no banana!) was so good that I got the mixed berry version on my next trip. Every department looked ready to close by 9pm on Saturday night and the store closes at 10pm, so get there earlier for full service shopping.

The store is brand new and very clean. My only concern is a freezer that seems to be malfunctioning because all the Goya tropical fruit purees had melted. Most of the Central and South American products are stored in this freezer so I had to pass on the Peruvian choclo and ají amarillo.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,11,12,4,8f51nGyPI1VwVmG2HYZgqQ

The Mexican sweet bread and rolls are immediately to the right next to the door so there was a small crowd of people to get thru to get into the store. Seems a little hectic to make your way past people to pick out your choices of items. They were soft and fresh. I priced some of the canned goods and teas and they were a little high compared to what I pay for them at the other Markets. I bought a few produce items and although they were priced competitively, I probably wouldn't drive here for their sales as I can obtain the same items closer to home.",9qBP4jYrhZVrXd-b4Tr6mw,0,0,3,KkZu17SLG1bwDUNnb8HGFA

Produce area is top notch, always well stocked. Huge spice area as well as bulk candy area, which I really enjoyed. Separate seafood counter always looks inviting, clean and well stocked.

First off I love being able to get off work (grave) and stopping in for a some fresh pan dulce and bolillos,(Amazinggg) nothing better than a fresh cup of coffee and a concha!!! They open at 6:00am perfect for me to stop in and get a little groceries... hardly anyone at this hour! Quick stop!

The customer service is alright, I think they can work on that a little more. They do greet you as you enter, but they don't seem to take the time to ask if they can help you with anything.

4315985,2018-04-09,0,CyU3l-0QfH2boVmYAP-o1A,"Tre-Bon!  I like this for the produce sales, and carne availability.  Bakery can barely keep up with demand for my specific items :cream cheese pastry, apple filled pastry, etc.  

I either go for the cafeteria, or specific sales.  They take AMEX, so until I get a better cash back card, I use AMEX.  Some stores just don't take it.  (SAMS).  

So, bring a good attitude, cuz traffic lanes don't exist, produce is crazy cheap, and the meat counter, bakery, and cafeteria barely speak 'Merican.  

Food: 
- The cheese quesadilla is hot stringy, cheesy
- Nachos are huge
- I like the option for whole beans
- bread is made that day for tortas, probably for tortillas too. 
- ask for a roasted chile (jalapeño) with combo -free. 
- Salsa is always available.  

Ups: 
- lotsa parking.  
- lots of cards
- sale paper comes in the mailbox

Downs:
- no fresh salsa for sale without onions (marianas does)
- no chips container readily avail for easy chips and salsa
- aisles are tight for shopping carts",5Wg5OanfZ4-2dCxEo-qjsw,0,0,4,BDkp4eB2QnIjZQ0VzdoGzg

I purchased only fruit yesterday for a fruit bowl I was making for a Fourth of July party. I purchased what I thought was fresh fruit or somewhat near that and when I went to cut the fruit today almost half of the fruit was rotten or spoiled. The majority of the strawberries I purchased had mold on it as well as the blackberries. Not to mention they are a little overpriced for their produce.

The one thing I like about these stores is that you can also buy food that is already prepared and cooked ready to eat. They have good specials and it's very inexpensive to eat there. 

They also have their own bakery, and have a section were you can pick out freshly cut fruit trays.

They also have a wide selection of meats, fish, and poultry.
