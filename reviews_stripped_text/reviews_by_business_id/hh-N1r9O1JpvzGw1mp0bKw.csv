Came here the other night (maybe it's been a week already? dunno) with my mom. She was worried  that because it was close to closing time they wouldn't be warmly receptive. Boy was she wrong.

I consider this place very Bay Area-esque yet in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, YAY  
Really fresh food. 
Fresh fresh salad with absolutely KILLER homemade dressing. Completely exceeded my expectations, I want to go back & try everything on the menu. 

Can't get over how flavorful my pasta dish was, man their food is so delicious!
Lemon bar just unreal. The flavor! don't know how to describe that, you have to taste it, was much more intense in a good way than any other Ive ever tried before.
And quite big, it was twice the size of what I've seen before (that's how I got to try some because I got the chocolate cake myself. Yum, super super moist) 
Small but very clean, very cute place with absolutely GREAT food, professional, caring nice owners, good prices for really good food!

644076,2014-05-09,0,hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw,"This is a tiny hole-in-the-wall place without the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. The menu had fun 80's and older song name for the dishes i.e. Paradise City, Buffalo Soldier. Incredibly small dining room though, a couple of tables and a couple outside. We sat outside which was nice except we were right next to the bus lane so as long as you don't mind bus patrons staring at you - then you are golden. I would have given this place four stars for the food but the lack of service knocked them down to three. 

Also for a dish made out of macaroni it seemed a bit pricey at the $11 price point after taxes, that being said I tried both the Buffalo Soldier (blue cheese with chicken nuggets with Frank's Red Hot Sauce) and the Sweet Home Alabama (Gouda mac'n'cheese with chicken nuggets with bacon and bbq sauce). 

I liked them both but for blue cheese the Buffalo Soldier had a very mild flavor, I preferred the Sweet Home Alabama (with my own added hot sauce of course). There was not a lot of sauce i.e. cheese but there was enough for flavor and the chicken was perfectly cooked, not greasy, with a crunchy light (panko?) breading. The portion size was decent too and we both left with left-overs. 

Also, tried the Fat Bottom Girls (cream puffs) one with chocolate and one without. It took quite some time to get our food, despite there only being one other customer that was already eating, so the cream puffs became our appetizer. 

My other complaints for service included when we went to get a take out box there was no one at the counter, my friend waited a good 10 minutes or so while trying to strain her neck to see if anyone was in the back before someone helped her. Also, we ended up bussing our own table - I supposed we could have just left everything outside but considering the area we didn't want anything to happen to their serving ware - so considering the lack of staff we decided to help them out. 

My friend ordered a soda and they forgot to give her the cup, she finally asked for it. 
Bottom Line - I enjoyed the comfort food and I think for macaroni and cheese they have some great flavor profiles, however the service was practically non-existant, and the prices weren't cheap, not expensive, but not cheap.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,2,0,3,Grf-lkqAvFINVkbYvWKrrA

First off, the parking situation is atrocious; no street parking and only 4 spots at the restaurant. Next up, seating. They only have 4 tables inside and can only accommodate 12 people. If you are lucky enough to get a seat, the constant flow of traffic in and out of the door will ensure that the A/C goes unnoticed.

But enough about that other stuff, how was the food? My honest answer: not good. I was looking for an Asian inspired dish and went with the 'Everybody Wang Chung Tonight'. The noodles were crispy, but everything else was disappointing. The sauce was very sweet and almost tasted like a marsala wine sauce. The 2 small pieces of chicken I did get were unseasoned and tasteless and the broccoli was tough and tasteless as well. When the cashier asked me how I liked my meal, and I gave her my honest answer, she agreed with me! She said that she had the same dish the day before and the sauce is just not right.

I'm always excited to try a new restaurant in downtown Las Vegas.  This is truly the most exciting discovery in more than seven years.  

Not being a fan of heavy meats or even chicken, nor breads nor fried foods I suppose I'm considered a picky eater.  This is the first place where I choose a dish not by process of elimination but I have to flip a coin throughout the menu to narrow my choices.  The people arewilling to substitute chicken with jumbo shrimp which helps me in my predicament.   There are beaucoup snappy vegetables on each plate for lots of taste and texture.  

I avoid lunch hour because there are less than 10 tables and I'm not a fan of delivery.  Once I get settled in the afternoons I'm always happy with each recipe.  A big plus is that the eating area is captures natural light which helps me enjoy our short winter days.  

Don't expect to find on-street parking on 3rd which is one-way going south.  Try one block west -- its an easy walk.",c1heytWKPHtMBMYJ0lTJvg,1,0,5,vsUgX2Mvdh7Bduiv6KTxIA

So when we do order we have at least 3-5 dinners that we order.  We have loved the food and talked to others about how good it was.  Today I went to place our weekly order and was told the delivery person was not available.  I did state that was to bad because we had a large order and do order every week.  Before I could even ask the phone person when will the delivery driver arrive since we are working til 7:30 and would still like to place an order.  The phone person said I don't care and hung up.  Now that is terrible service and because of that we as a business will no longer order from there at all.
I am adding to my original review because Abby the chef did just call us to apologize which I thought was very professional and I appreciated the call.

It's a small place, w/ amazing food! It only seats about 14 people. Not sure if or when it gets busy, but when we arrived we had the place to ourselves. I had the Sweet Home Alabama (Creamy smoked gouda macaroni and cheese tossed with purple onion and bacon. Topped with buttermilk marinated popcorn chicken and a swirl of barbecue sauce) & my friend had the Great Balls of Fire (Not your average spaghetti and meatballs, our pork and beef meatballs are bursting with flavor and heat from jalapeno and red pepper. Served over spaghetti with zesty vodka sauce). 

My dish was so rich & flavorful. The minute you have your first bite you have an idea of what it's supposed to taste like. Ten you have that first bite & it's even better than you thought. SO GOOD! I got to taste my friend's meal. The spaghetti wasn't anything new to me, but those meatballs are what made the flavor of the dish. It's got a bit of a spice to it. When you take that bite you taste all that meat, then comes the heat. Very well done.

I didn't notice until i had finished my meal :( Hope it didn't hatch that many. Restaurant offered me a refund and dessert. Dessert, really? I took the refund. This is probably an isolated unfortunate incident, but seeing how the shaker was bottled tight and the holes were not big enough for a fly of that size to crawl in, i can only assume it had made its home in the shaker for a few days, nesting and feeding till it grew large enough not to escape.

I was most looking forward to the buffalo, but ended up liking the Alabama a lot more, it was more savory and just better overall sauce and consistency. Buffalo solider wasn't bad but it wasn't even close to what I expected, tasted a bit artificial. That I got drunk and added mayonnaise to make it more creamy and less artificial tasting, and then it was better. The kid order of the ""return of the Mac"" was insulting, it was suppose to be served with ground beef and diced bacon, hmmm I think I saw ONE piece in the WHOLE thing, it was otherwise just a cheesy mess. Honestly frustrated by that, don't advertise it as one thing to bring a customer something completely different.  Don't be lazy. They forgot my Coke with the delivery as well. The only reason they're getting 3 stars is because of the sweet Alabama pasta and because the customer service over the phone and with the delivery was awesome, good attitude and timely.

Located on 3rd St off of Charleston, this place could be very easy to miss. The parking behind the restaurant is cramped and limited. Fully expect to get blocked in which happened to me when someone decided to park directly behind me while I was parked in an actual designated parking spot. 

The restaurant itself is very small with maximum occupancy of 14. They have two four person tables and two bar tables that seat two each. The decor is a fusion of very elegant and laid back. The furniture is accented with comfortable pillows while the walls are adorned with various rock n roll album covers.

The menus are located at the counter and that is where you place your order. They also have silverware, additional sauces and other condiments at the counter as well.

Both days I ordered Buffalo Soldier pasta along with Teen Spirit fries.

 Buffalo Soldier fries are exactly what you might infer from the name - creamy blue cheese macaroni topped with boneless buffalo chicken and buffalo sauce. 5/5
Smells Like Teen Spirit fries - Really, really, realllly delicious fries tossed in herbs and parmesan served with chipotle aioli. The portion is huge for the extremely reasonable price of $3.95  5/5
Born on the Bayou - I tried some of my sister's order and was thoroughly impressed by the quality and the quantity that came in a half sized portion. This had the works :chorizo, andouielle sausage, bacon, smoked ham and chicken jambalaya served over orzo pasta. This is a very filling option and I'd strongly suggest on going with the half order option. 5/5
Knights in White Satin - I enjoyed this option as well, it is linguine pasta in white whine sauce, lemon juice, heavy cream and white truffle oil with mushrooms and shrimp.  I found the sauce to be a bit watery, but the overall flavor was solid. I am not sure if they skimped on the shrimp or my husband ate it all before we made our plate switch (I suspect the latter) so I can't really comment on the quantity and quality of the shrimp. The half order of this is slightly more expensive than the rest due to more expensive ingredients I'd imagine. 3.5/5

The staff is super friendly and accommodating. It was also very refreshing seeing them lug in locally purchased food products and ingredients when the owner came by with a car full of stuff. No Sysco trucks in sight for this little gem. 

They also offer beer, solid salad options, and dessert. In addition, they deliver and take out is available (possibly preferred due to limited space).

Pasta is cheap and easy to make, so I usually don't order it at restaurants.   I was invited here by others.  

I ordered a happy hour glass of wine,  which was $9.19.  Very expensive for a glass of happy hour wine.  

I ordered the buffalo soldier.  It did have a buffalo kick, which was good for me, a spicy gal.  the chicken, also had some spice, but not too much that others wouldn't enjoy it.  So I would say the flavors were developed and defined.  It was a bit shy with the bleu cheese.  It had shaved fresh carrots and celery as garnish and added a texture.  The toast was good, but nothing unique.  Would have been nice to be elevated a bit for a place trying to be trendy.  


I believe the space is being expanded and is a fun vibe with records on the wall and colorful.  It was warm in the room and even a fan circulating the air would have added more comfort.  It seems they are still expanding and will be a nice casual dining place.

Two of my friends had gotten this Hong Kong style noodle that's crunchy but gets soft with the sauce. I stole some bites teehee and it was ok as well.

Pasta dish was a good-sized portion with delicious gouda sauce, 7 pieces of barbeque popcorn chicken (a little dry inside), and some red onions.

Very pleased with my order.

My friend and I were here with a Meet Up group and we all shared dishes, which is good cause I pretty much wanted to order everything on the menu, no seriously, everything. Half orders are still large, but who doesn't love leftovers?

Ray of Light
Penne pasta tossed with pancetta, pine nuts, asparagus, white wine and lemon juice, finished with a heaping handful of fresh spinach and parmesan cheese.  
- I wanted to love this but for some reason I didn't, the execution was great, pasta al dente, but it didn't do it for me.

Sweet Home Alabama
Creamy smoked gouda macaroni and cheese tossed with purple onion and bacon. Topped with buttermilk marinated popcorn chicken and a swirl of barbecue sauce.
- Dear lord, this is heaven and hell, heaven for my palette and hell for my waist line. So good, go get it! The chicken was breaded wonderfully and the chicken was still moist. 

Nights in White Satin
Linguine pasta with white wine, lemon juice, heavy cream and white truffle oil, with sautéed mushrooms, jumbo shrimp, a kick of red pepper and fresh herbs. 
- I wanted to order one to go after I tried a bite, spicy and delicious, plus anything with truffle, I'm sold. 

Buffalo Soldier
Creamy blue cheese macaroni topped with boneless buffalo chicken pieces with julienned carrots and celery. 
- I don't like blue cheese, like seriously am against it. However even though I could taste it, it wasn't over powering. If you love blue cheese, get this one, my friend does and she was in love.

Everybody Wang Chung Tonight
Hong Kong style pan fried noodles in a rich broth seasoned with shaoxing wine and oyster sauce with thin sliced chicken breast, carrot, broccoli, shitake mushrooms and julienned scallions.
- So good! The noodles are super crispy and the flavor was amazing. Try it, you'll like it.

Bang a Gong
Authentic chicken tikka masala, a creamy tomato sauce with garam masala, greek yogurt and cayenne pepper. Served with sautéed spinach and cilantro over orzo pasta.
- I love chicken tikka masala, however this version I wasn't into, I'd rather have the real dish.

Overall love it, yes parking sucks, yes its super tiny, but the staff is friendly, the music great and the food is amazing - if you've been thinking about going - go do it!",5LE-pxvIqxFtJxRg-qpCHQ,3,1,4,uLvfFrt6j8ubGtaPw3UI1w

I order the Buffalo Soldier. I love buffalo sauce and the bleu cheese turned me off at first, but like I said ""This place is amazing.""
Life changing meals that are cheaper than a psychiatrist! 

The only CON about this place is the amount of bread you receive with your pasta. Call me a snob or picky. I truly don't care. When it comes to pasta, bread is an essential partner in crime for this dining experience. I receive roughly over a pound of pasta whenever I order the Buffalo Soldier. The only thing I can compare this horrible strategy of service is the way chicken wing restaurants distribute their ranch. It's a stingy move and very annoying. There is going to be that moment where customers are going to be hungry and THEY WILL compare the destinations of interest. The little scrap of bread you provide with your pasta will not go unnoticed. Fix it, please.

Want to know why I went with 4 and not 3? THE PORTIONS!! Holy mother of Italy who needs that much pasta!?! By no means is that a complaint either! I love when I can enjoy leftovers of a great meal! Especially carbs. 
A place easy to miss if you're not paying attention. Also, a place that can pay its rent in one First Friday if they play their cards right. I am all about adding family friendly establishments to downtown. This one fits that description perfectly. A small, ""hole in the wall"" with the walls plastered in album covers and the dishes named after songs. IE: Great Ballls of Fire, Born on the Bayou, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Return of the Mac. Such a corky concept that fits in the unique, younger, artistic culture downtown has grown accustom to these last couple of years. 
To me the food was average other than the Smoke on the Water salad. This is a salad you would think has meat because of the smoky flavor but it indeed is vegetarian. Its a huge portion of baby greens, tortilla strips, tomatoes, corn, avocado, and a smoked chipotle vinegar dressing. I did NOT need to order a pasta as well, but the blue cheese in the Buffalo Solider did not disappoint! I could tell the food was fresh, but I am not sure there is anything that blew my mind where I will be left in craving mode. Don't get me wrong, I will totally eat here. Again, and again. Hopefully next time I will be ""wowed""

We came around 730. There were a few people sitting in the booth... So we opted for the tall table. Lots of people were coming in to pick up their food, so I'm assuming it's a popular to-go spot. Please note: the space is really tiny. It's not a spot for large groups, but perfect for a few friends or couples. The decor is pretty neat... They are definitely rock and roll themed. An entire wall is dedicated to nothing but plaques of different eras of rock and roll. It's actually a really great idea.

The menu... Well... Everything including the menu is rock and roll themed. We ordered the ray of light: Penne pasta tossed with pancetta, pine nuts, asparagus, white wine and lemon juice, finished with a heaping handful of fresh spinach and parmesan cheese.  Full $10.75 - Half $6.75.  We opted out of the cheese and pancetta to make it vegan. We shared a full size, as it was definitely enough for two. It was delicious... I'm not really a pasta person...

I was a little afraid of too much blue cheese but it was just enough in sprinkles on top of the mac. They only gave me two small chicken bites which at first I thought... come on but after I cut them up it ended up being the perfect amount to pair with this dish so the buffalo did overpower it.  Super creamy and tasty. I also love that you can get half portions because I hate to waste food and in vegas I dont wanna carry around mac and cheese all night. I almost didnt finish my half portion but it was too good. My mom got the great balls of fire which is a spicy spaghetti. The meatballs were really tasty and this was great for a spaghetti but depending on your preference it needed way more spice.  This place is tiny! Maybe 4-5 tables for only 2-3 people each inside and a few tables outside. They do have a good wine selection now.. i read a review earlier that said there was no alcohol.

Rock 'N'oodles is definitely one of those good finds! I don't live or work anywhere near downtown and would have probably never seen it otherwise. It's a small building right off Charleston on 3rd Street that would be easy to miss if you were driving by. The restaurant itself is very small and can only seat about 12 people plus a couple outside tables. I love the décor though, it's simple but awesome with an entire wall covered in great albums they've got in really cool little frames.

When it comes to the food, you'll quickly realize why it's called Rock 'N'oodles. All the dishes are named after songs like Great Balls of Fire, Californication & The Devil Went Down To Georgia, just to name a few. Two of the ones we've tried so far now are Buffalo Soldier and Sweet Home Alabama...which I can only describe as versions of mac 'n cheese on steroids! The Alabama is a gouda macaroni topped with popcorn chicken and BBQ sauce with some bacon and onions tossed in. With the Buffalo Soldier you get blue cheese macaroni with carrots and celery topped with buffalo chicken. Now, like I said...steroids! Flavor is spectacular in both, pasta is cooked perfectly and each bite just keeps you wanting more! 

I've noticed some reviews mention small portions. I can only assume the owner/management are paying attention because these are definitely not small plates. We've also tried Born On The Bayou and Paradise City...I was only able to finish my entire plate once. On top of that, the customer service is great and even after my son accidentally spilled his Sprite all over the counter, we were met with smiles and a friendly attitude!

Know that it's a small spot so I definitely wouldn't recommend bringing your whole squad and their mom all up in there, but I must say they do offer some of the best tasting pasta I've had in awhile. Pretty unique as well. I love how they have that guessing game with the song lyrics. I'd cheat though so I decided to just buy the drink haha. Everything on the menu seriously sounds too good. I actually shed a tear because I wanted to try them all, but I guess it just gives me a reason to come back! I ended up picking the Devil went to Georgia and I didn't regret one freakin' bite. 5/5 The pasta was cooked a perfect al dente and every part of that bad boy was spicy and tasted of fine, fine quality. Definitely a bang for your buck on the freshness level of ingredients and the sizing of the portions. The garlic bread only had a minute appearance. After that it was inhaled 5/5. Only thing that was a little lackluster was the cheesecake 3/5. Something about the flavor or the texture was def off but I'm coming back to try those cream puffs. Mark my words. I really might just have to bring the whole squad and my momma too though, shoooo. Love that board supporting all the local businesses and events as well. Such a sucker for those!

I saw the reviews here on YELP for Rock 'N' oodles. Shared them with the wife and we agreed to give the place a try.

Very small place on the southwest corner of Charleston and 3rd steet. I only mention this because the place is THAT small. Inside are a few tables, that seat up to 14 people. Outside are two other tables that can seat 8 more people, if you litteraly want to eat on the sidewalk. We arrived 15 minutes after they opened for business. By 12 noon the place was packed!

But what Rock 'N' oodles lacks in size, you gain in service! The lady at the front counter was polite, helpful explaining the menu. When she noticed me trying a hot sauce with my meal she offered a few others, and explained why she was offering those. On to the food....

My wife had ""Buffalo Soilder"" which on the menu is descibed as a creamy blue cheese macaroni topped with boneless buffalo chicken pieces with julienned carrots and celery.

I had some ""Sweet Home Alabama"" a creamy smoked gouda macaroni and cheese tossed with purple onion and bacon. Topped with buttermilk marinated popcorn chicken and a swirl of barbecue sauce.

My wife says her meal was a bit on the extrea creamy side, almost like a soup. I agreed that mine was the same way. Her Buffalo chicken was great, but a little too spicy for her, so I ate the last few bites for her. 

My meal was good but I think I could have used some more spices on the chicken.

We also had an order of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", described as crispy french fries tossed in fresh herbs and parmesan, served with chipotle aioli. They were fine.

The decor in this place, in my opinion, is number one with a bullet! A wall complete with nothing but record albums. As I looked at each and every album, I would say BINGO to any performer I have seen in concert. Just a fun game my wife and I play when we are driving and listening to the radio.

Quotes written on the walls. A collection of hot sauce on display that people can use for their meals. I tried the Jimi Hendrix, Purple Haze sauce. It was okay. Even a selection of magazines for people to look at.

The food was okay at best, the decor and service was the best. Again it is obvious that deep thought was put into every aspect. I highly recomend Rock 'N' Oodles and hope to see them in a larger location one day, they deserve it!",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,1,0,4,rZZvt7POrXYbv3G2ff9erQ

First off, they have tons of variety. If you want to come to with a group of people and don't necessarily want pasta, they have plenty of options to choose from. The pasta types have such an incredible range of flavor profiles. You could have anything from an upgraded Alfredo style pasta to a pasta with truffle oil, lemon, cream with perfectly cooked shrimp. 

The place is small right off of third and Charleston. It has a small parking lot but there is plenty of street parking available. When you walk in, you really feel the ""rockn"" vibe. There are records on the walls with some cool paintings. You order at a walk up counter(sometimes it's nice to not worry about having a server!).

Saving grace was the cream puff. Both the regular one and the chocolate covered are excellent.

I, initially, felt like this place was on the small side because the counter is very close to the entrance & there are only a few 2 tops on that side & a few more tables on the other side. But, during my 2nd visit I realized just how big that other side was!! It can easily accommodate a decent size group. 

The service is excellent. The decor is casual and fun. Records and photos are fun to check out on the walls. The music playing is, also, pretty great.

Brien was at the counter. He was really helpful with answering our questions and making suggestions. All the dishes are named after songs, another fun nod to the music concept. Brush up on your song lyrics! If you can guess the artist & song title for the weekly mystery lyrics, you can win a free beverage, but I'm currently 0-2. You order/pay at the counter, sit where you like, and they bring it out to you.  We landed on Crazy Train & Livin' La Vida Loca.

Crazy Train is their version of chicken picatta, which is a favorite of mine. I thoroughly enjoyed this version. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the chicken was nice and tender, and the sauce was flavorful. And, unlike other versions, this Crazy Train was somehow light while still being filling.

Livin' La Vida Loca was fantastic!! A creamy Pepper Jack Sauce, Carnitas, Jalapeños, Pico, Black Beans...sort of like a Mexican Mac n Cheese, yet so much more. I want to explore the menu, but it will be hard not to order this every time. It is definitely the kind of dish I will get a craving for and go just for this.

On my 2nd visit here I switched things up and went for the Rapper's Delight. This was a generous sized wrap loaded with fried chicken, lettuce, cheese, siracha ranch, peppers, & onions. Served with fries. Another winner. My friends had Sweet Home Alabama, Ray of Light, Buffalo Soldier, Great Balls of Fire, Knights In White Satin, Walking On Sunshine, & Smoke On The Water. Every single person in a party of 14 raved about their food.

I love that most dishes can be ordered in a full or half portion. And, I really love the BOGO beer & wine during Happy Hour! Even though this is mainly a ""noodle"" place, the menu is diverse to accommodate whatever you might be in the mood for...American, Asian, Mexican, Italian, Greek. They have both hot & cold pasta dishes, salads, sandwiches, beer & wine, desserts. Something for everyone!

Prices are affordable. A  1/2 order is around $8 while a full portion is about $13. I almost want come here once a week until I've tried it all!! Please check them out.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,2,4,4,1H4f7mrxb4ACSIXFiDtH1A

Upon entering Rock'N'oodles is a wall of classic records you'll recognize (if you have good taste, LOL). It's a pretty small space, but regardless of that, it's set up well and decorated tastefully. The lighting is superb! The chairs aren't bad either--there are throw pillows for the booths. Oh, and the restroom is clean--that's an automatic thumbs up in my book!

Parking is limited, and it's separate from the Downtown Project and Fremont St. but it's only about a mile away, so if you are in the area for that, it won't be too much of a bother to head on over!

Now, for the food! That's the important part, right?! It's unfortunate for me to admit, but I've only had the sides here! My party had already eaten before exploring the downtown area and stumbling upon this joint. But when we entered out of curiosity and read the menu, we could not leave without ordering something.

The menu items are named after hit singles; we had the Space Oddity (beer battered pickle spears and sriracha ranch) and Smells Like Teen Spirit (fries with parmesan, herbs and a chipotle aioli). I've never had combinations like this before. They were both so delicious! I'm not big on condiments at all but these sides were worth the adventurous try! The chef served it to us and was incredibly polite. It was truly an awesome experience! 

My party and I have already decided to come back for a full meal! Definitely looking forward to trying the entrees and desserts!",KAIG8_R5vcBt-CGUi4bkPA,2,1,5,pVi7HE-Q8NzF8LnWXKjKkg

Good luck with that...but if you do get lucky and find a space step inside to a little spot with 4 tables and a very interesting menu that's packed with some interesting combinations and flavors worth exploring further. 

I've tried several items on the menu now, and Knights in White Satin is the one item I've ordered more than once. Also I have to recommend the Smells Like Teen Spirit fries...I was like a hungry teenager and left none of them behind. 

Pricing...this isn't the cheapest lunch in town but I considered it priced right for the quantity and more importantly the quality of what they offer.

The owner was very nice and helpful when I asked for suggestions. He even offered to let me sample the soup of the day. 

Only down notes are that it has very limited space in their parking lot and it was slightly to noisy in there with the loud music and the TVs on.

We first went with our good friends and fellow Yelpers Dyanna and Brent. After that time Joel and I both had agreed that we should have gotten what they had. So on a recent visit back we did! Since it was like 8:30pm and they close at 9pm we decided to take our order to go. Joel ordered the Sweet Home Alabama. It's like Mac and cheese had a baby with some barbecued chicken. He gobbled it up! And quickly said he couldn't wait to have it again. I ordered the Smoke on the Water salad and added chicken and also got the Wind Beneath My Wings. By the time we got home (since we live all the way in Henderson & they are on 3rd st) I was ready to tear open the bag. The smells coming from the brown bag were glorious! When I pulled everything out I found we were missing my wings. I was so sad. I quickly called Rock N Noodle and talked to Brian. He was very nice and apologetic. He just did not hear me when I ordered the wings. But he did say that when we come in next he will give me a free order! Very cool! Now the salad! Mmmmmm yummy! You have to try it! It tastes like a rib in a salad. But there are no ribs in this! Just lettuce, tomato, red onion, wonton crisps and avocado. I added chicken too! The dressing though! Wow! It just makes the salad. It has a smokey, spicy, Bbqing quality about the salad dressing. Like no other salad that I've had before.

I'll be back soon for my free wings and another salad. Wish we lived closer I'd be there every week. If your craving pasta and killer salads hit Rock N Noodle up!!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,3,3,4,CysFFLf1G7MmHV2uoK6Phw

This spot does creative pasta toppings and has a Rock N Roll theme with the names and vinyls on the wall. Funny, but I heard not one rock song while there. It's a small spot with 4 tables so not really a place for a big family dinner. 

Even though we were given a table and menus, we were then told we have to get up and order and pay at the counter. It is a DIY drink fountain situation as well. 

The fiance and I shared: 

Sweet Home Alabama - this is a smoked gouda macaroni with bacon, onion, popcorn chicken topped with BBQ sauce. The flavor of this was pretty good, I did like the gouda cheese sauce, but it was sparse on the bacon as I got 2 bites where I noticed it. I'm all about don't put a sprinkle of something in a amount that doesn't do anything for the dish so either place a solid presence of bacon flavor or leave it out. The popcorn chicken was a bit over fried though as it was dark in color and dried it out.

Livin' La Vida Loca - pepper jack penne with carnitas, beans, pico and jalapeno on top. The carnitas topping is really good, nice flavor and tender but the pasta sauce was lacking in flavor and needed some seasoning as it was just straight cream. Our friend also got this. Both these were overly sauced as well. I like generous sauce but it looked like soup when all the pasta was picked out.

You get a garlic bread slice with each pasta and it was standard, but good. 

The pasta comes in two sizes- full bowl and half. We got the Sweet Home as a full and the Livin' as a half. I took a picture for comparison of the bowls. The small is deceiving as it's still a good portion. 

The place has potential. It's all in the execution details and little tweaks that can take it from ""a'ight"" to something solid good. I'll maybe give them another try at a later date.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,1,3,Q863nqId9ZqmTa0KM79ltg

I love the creativity of the pastas, not only do they make pastas from different cultural backgrounds they also name them after famous songs, it goes with the theme.

The pastas are scrumptious and made from scratch!
The portions are great for any appetite, full plate and/or half plate.
Occasionally, they will invent a new dish so it's good to follow them on social media.

The decor is very nice, they have plaques of famous music artists on the wall. 
Unfortunately, that was the only awesome thing to look at because the restaurant is small about 12 people at a time. They have seats outside but it's summer in Vegas right now, it's best to call ahead and confirm the waiting time. Parking wasn't difficult to find I just parked across the street.

Rock'n'noodles is a cute little spot in the Arts District. Serving up unique noodle dishes, wraps, and excellent baked goods.

The dishes are cooked fresh to order, so there's a little bit of a wait before your food arrives, but it's a huge portion and it comes steaming and hot.They all have really cute names Nights in White Satin, Sweet Home Alabama, Livin' La Vida Loca, etc.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting or living in Vegas.",d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg,1,2,4,WPakrgFsIspCoD-IlsPu4g

We tried two dishes, and each was just the right size for sharing. I had the Red Red Wine, which is braised beef short ribs with vegetables (hand cut). The noodles were cooked just right, and had just enough chewyness to mix with the other ingredients on my palate. We also tried the Nights in White Satin which is a tasty dish of linguine with mushrooms and jumbo shrimp. The truffle oil really didn't distinguish itself in this dish, and left us feeling like we didn't get to taste its full potential.

It's a rockin restaurant, so try to find your favorite album cover on the wall. Fans of the 70,s and 80's won't be disappointed.",p--eA6PhrYU5SeMAXRq6Pg,0,0,4,W0gnPVd-6XwZDwOajtzoMA
5659924,2014-06-20,4,hh-N1r9O1JpvzGw1mp0bKw,"I vaguely remember seeing somebody check in to this place months ago. My friend Maria A. suggested dinner Downtown at Container Park (100x NO) so I countered with this place on 6/19/14.

Definitely pleasantly surprised. Parking is horrible, and is surrounded by shifty looking apartments and other buildings that look like a 2nd world barrio. I ended up having to park at one of these apartments. 

I didn't realize how small this place was, so I am very happy we were able to grab a table. We both ordered the Sweet Home Alabama. She ordered hers sans bacon because she keeps kosher. I ordered mine ""with her bacon"" because I gave up kosher specifically to eat bacon. I don't know if the bacon is made into the sauce because I didn't see any on either of our dishes. 

She had a cream puff that she said was great and we split the brownie that I ordered. It was good. Maria ordered fries for us to split - they were pretty salty.

Anyway, back to the pasta. AMAZING. Really delicious. A full order is definitely enough for 2 meals, which is why I took half my food to go. Will definitely be back and... you know how much I hate giving anything higher than 3 stars, so you know you can trust this review.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,6,7,4,4fPnhERfEJLL0JCaOq3WVQ

The restaurant is decorated with old music albums and all the food has a cool music-related name.  I immediately got good vibes from the young man who took my order.  He was whistling the whole time he was helping make the food and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job.  I like that.  

$34.88 got me a ""ray of light"" pasta, a ""rappers delight"" wrap, a ""bitter sweet symphony"" salad, and a lemon bar.  Two delicious pieces of garlic bread, ketchup, some grated parmesean cheese, greek salad dressing, and some tasty sauce was included in the bag without me having to ask.  

$11.25 ""Ray of Light"" had penne pasta tossed with pancetta, pine nuts, asparagus, white wine and lemon juice, finished with a heaping handful of fresh spinach and parmesan cheese.  My eyes were bigger than my belly so I ordered the full portion and had a lot leftover.  The flavors were delicious and light.  I found the pasta to be a bit toooooo al dente for my taste and wish it had a little sauce but it was still mighty tasty.  

$8.50 ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" salad is a traditional Greek salad with tomatoes, Kalamata olives, red onion, and feta cheese which is served with warm pita chips.  Their tangy vinaigrette was not my favorite but thank goodness it came on the side.  The romaine lettuce was fresh and crispy and there were lots of delicious toppings.  My favorite part was the pita chips on top which were undoubtedly deep fried yet chewy.  

It was ridiculously fast to get a to-go order (about 10 minutes) and it's right on my way home from work so this is dangerous.  I'll definitely be back to try all of their dishes!!!!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,20,15,4,HIT3NvGp3nX756TTEJImEQ

Unfortunately they were out of greens, so I couldn't get the smoke on the water salad; they switched to a special pasta with veggies (I think I overpaid by a dollar since the pasta was cheaper than the salad). The pasta was ok, nothing special--cooked more on the al dente side, with a fairly basic flavor profile. I don't think the choice of veggies added much to the favor. Overall, a forgettable dish.

Who knew that you could jazz up the carbohydrate tubes in such a wide variety of ways?! Well, they sure do it right at Rock'N'oodles.

It's easy to miss while driving by, so bookmark this spot. They have a very small parking lot that can fill up fast, so you might have better luck if you find street parking nearby. It's fast-casual counter service, so make your way in, grab a menu and order away. They now offer beer and wine, so grab yourself a cold one while you're at it.

My favorite, so-far, is the Buffalo Soldier. It's like hot wings with a twist. The noodles are tossed in a creamy hot sauce that is too die for with a sprinkling of blue cheese. The chicken is battered and boneless. Perfect. I haven't had a noodle dish that I don't like yet.

What holds me back from that fifth star is the cleanliness of the space. All but a few tables were covered in crumbs and trash. It wasn't busy, so I would have liked to see a bit more effort to keep the open seating area a little on the cleanlier side. Just my preference.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,22,19,4,0etJpB-VuNlEEakyc0eeDQ
