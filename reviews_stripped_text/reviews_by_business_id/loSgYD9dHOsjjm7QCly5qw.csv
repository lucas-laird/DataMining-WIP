    I ordered the Cobb Burger and Sweet Potato Tots and a White Russian. I would agree with some other posts that there weren't a lot of ""original"" pre-thought out burgers to choose from, there were a lot of options to build your own, however, I prefer to taste what strange creations other people think is a great burger. That said, the Cobb was very good. Best I've ever had? No, but still worth it to me. The Sweet Tots were a strange idea to me, but incredibly good. I do wish they served some sort of aioli sauce or something with them but that's not a huge deal. The White Russian was large and very good.
    Overall, it was slightly spendy but there was a LOT of food, too much, really. My wife and I could have probably split the meal n still have been satisfied. Plus, since we were so full, we had to miss out on the Cap'n Crunch Shake, n that makes me sad.

We ordered a build your own burger, with brioche and Kobe beef. The beef was not as marbled as expected for Kobe beef. The texture was so so; I asked if they grind their own meat and they don't. They bought patties from suppliers. I guess that explained why it doesn't taste outstandingly. We are actually surprised that a celebrity chef owned burger joint doesn't grind their own meat.

124291,2012-08-27,2,loSgYD9dHOsjjm7QCly5qw,"Even though I have about two dozen places on my to-do list, once in a while I need to revisit a previously reviewed location due to either reader feedback or in the case of KGB, the lack of pictures and just a downright awful first review. So it was with great hesitation that I ventured back to Harrah's last week to see if Kerry would be any better to me this time around. Was he?

I won't speak much to Harrah's as it's outdated, smelly and attracts some not so savory patrons. The restaurant is fairly cool, almost a slightly more modern version of Burger Bar or something. One gripe I had last time, and I still maintain after my latest visit, is that the music is completely loud and annoying. There are a few different seating areas, luckily this time I was seated in the main area closest to the kitchen which is a bit more inviting. The menu seems to have changed since my last visit, as they now offer a few predesigned burgers and is a welcome sight.

With some advice from the waiter I went with the BBQ Bacon Burger: all natural beef patty, homemade BBQ sauce, applewood bacon, lettuce, smoked gouda and crispy onions on an onion roll. Once again I will initially say that it was way too big; too tall, too wide and just a giant mass of stuff. The meat had a not-so-great flavor although it was cooked to order. It was super bloody at first but dried out far too quickly, and I found myself searching for the inconsistently placed BBQ sauce throughout the last half of the burger for some relief from the dryness. The onion strings had ok flavor on their own, but even with giant piles of them on the burger they seemed lost. The bun was fresh but flavorless. And just like last time there was way too much lettuce. Overall this was just not a good burger; little flavor, dry and way too big.

Just like the burger, the fries didn't have great flavor and were totally cold on arrival. They were just your typical generic fry with almost no seasoning and no creativity whatsoever. $15 for just the burger is absolutely way too much, and the $24.27 I paid with my iced tea and tip is about $20 more than this meal was worth. While I gave my first meal here a score in the high 70's, I'm going even lower this time now that I have plenty to compare it to. Harrah's as a Las Vegas property isn't really worth visiting as it is, and this is one burger that's definitely not worth going out of your way for.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,1,8gqGvPsVAOlnOfmoTHqHWw

We were seated quickly and it wasn't busy at all.  We noticed a special which included a burger, fries and a drink...now, we were a tad intoxicated and we can't really remember the cost of this 'special'.  We think it was in the 9.00 range.  Not too bad when it comes to Vegas.  We decided to split it and they charged us 2.00!!!!!  What??  To take 2 extra seconds to cut the burger?  One slice of the knife?  I would have done it myself you jerks.  I could have bought...well, nothing in Vegas for 2.00, but you know what I mean!  I was drunk and the burger wasn't even that great.

295819,2014-09-08,1,loSgYD9dHOsjjm7QCly5qw,"Dined here for lunch. The Rolling Stone magazine dubbed Chef Kerry Simon the ""Rock 'n Roll Chef"".  I ordered the Burger Cobb salad.  It was made with Romaine lettuce, a mini burger patty, bacon, egg, avocado, green onion, tomato, thousand island dressing or dressing of choice.  $11 for Harrah's rewards card holders, or $12 without.  The salad was pretty good.  The mini burger was full of flavor and really made this salad delicious.  It left me wishing I had a full sized burger on that salad.  The burger was truly the best part of the salad.  If you're hungry I'd suggest asking to substitute a regular sized burger for the mini.  

The service was a bit on the slower side.  It took a while to get the check and we were on a schedule because we had tickets for a show.  You're gonna laugh because our waitress was a bit on the snobby side but I couldn't tell if that was all part of the KGB act or if she really was that way (From Russia with tough love) I'm going to guess that it was a little of both.  The uniforms were stylish, sort of a Boris and Natasha kinda thing. It's a pretty cool place to eat but as to be expected a bit on the pricey side.  

Other family members ordered Salmon which they said was okay but not fantastic, and others ordered burgers and fries.  The burgers were well liked and a great reason to come back,  but the fries were nothing to be remembered.",K9CkzddqI3YiiNDqFhQx2A,4,0,4,q20vmD93MobnNJwe05xexQ

We ordered a sandwich, with the intention of splitting each: 1) short rib sloppy joe, 2) fried chicken and waffle sandwich. If i remember correctly, with each sandwich we got a choice of either tots or fries (there might have been one more option). We ordered one of each.

Sidebar: Kind of an odd thing, but if you order a side of regular tots, they're the same price as a side of sweet potato tots. But if you try to substitute them with your sandwich, they upcharge you $1.50. Damn if I let the man screw me, so I decided to just get an extra side of the sweet potato ones too.

In this case I was looking for an upscale burger joint. I think I found it.

We enjoyed an appetizer, a salad and a chicken burger, all of which we found delicious.

The appetizer was the Waffle Fry Nachos. They were described on the menu as ""cheddar cheese sauce, sloppy joe, jalapenos""  for 6 bucks.

When the nachos showed up, they could have been a meal in themselves. A heaping plate of waffle fries with a mound of ""sloppy joe"" (which seemed a lot like pulled pork to me) covered in cheese sauce. Next time I think I'll stop the the nachos. $6 was a good deal.

My wife ordered the Burger Cobb salad. After the waffle fry nachos, she really didn't have much appetite left but she soldiered on. She asked for and got the dressing on the side. It looked delicious and she agreed. But then, how can you screw up a salad? At $9 it was a good value.

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken breast sandwich.  The bun was HUGE. And the check breast covered the entire bun! I'm impressed. The tomato slice, shaved onion (sliced thin enough to be almost transparent, about 1/16"" thick), bleu cheese dressing, lettuce and pickles. The pickles looked to be scratch made (fresh cuke sliced and marinaded in vinegar) a real plus in my book. The sandwich was fantastic. I would have skipped the bleu cheese dressing and gone with just bleu cheese crumbles because the sandwich got really soggy by the end, a minor annoyance. Served with fries for $12 it seems like a reasonable price for the strip.

Only criticism, no beer on tap. Granted they have a humongous selection of bottled beer, but nothing on tap.
 
Overall, I would recommend KGB to my friends visiting Las Vegas.

Our waitress ignored us for ten minutes even though it was not busy.  Eventually, we flagged down another waiter who took our order after checking with our waitress to verify it was OK to takeover her table.  

We ordered two bacon cheeseburgers, two sodas, and a large onion ring for over $30.  The food was better than McDonalds but not as good as quality burger chains, including Five-Guys and FatBurger.  

According to the waiter, KGB management would not honor the KGB ""buy two burgers for the price of one burger"" coupon that Harrah's provided us just hours earlier during our check-in, because the KGB management wanted to limit the coupon to just specialty burgers though the coupon did not state any burger type restriction.",kG0UZ3i5wSnT51gdjQ8GEQ,3,1,1,M8oqfFOtcWAvIP8ak6aA5g

Since there was no bar area we were seated at a table right by the host. There were a few $3 drafts available and I went with the Happy Camper IPA by Santa Fe Brewing Company. No complaints about a tasty IPA with a 6.6% ABV for $3 a pop! During happy hour, all of the ""snacks"" with the exception sliders were $5 an order. I put snacks in apostrophe because they really were much larger than your average snack.

I figured I'd go with the tacos to start and order more if they were tiny. Holy guacamole! The tacos consisted of chipotle chicken, shredded lettuce, pico de gallo, cilantro and an avocado crème fraîche. They were huge! I'm talking this could be your meal, huge! They were extremely tasty as well and I had to stop myself before ruining my appetite for dinner. The extra taco that I took to go did wonders as a late night snack later that evening.

The portions here are huge, almost wastefully so, but I feel like I get my money's worth which is a good feeling to have at any restaurant in a Strip property. KGB offers your standard burger and toppings and then your not so standard burgers and quirky toppings. Amongst the defectors are lamb, salmon, veggie, short rib and chicken, some of which are nice options for non-beef eaters as well as a variety of cheeses, mayos and dressings. If you really want to get crazy here they have salads too.

I've had the fall orchard turkey burger (I think that's what it was called)-it had a nice combo of apples, pickled onions, brie and a sweet, likely mayo based sauce. Their sweet potato fries are killer and worth the upgrade. I've also had the buffalo chicken rolls which are a fun take on spring rolls with a blue cheese dipping sauce. The iron chef sliders are great too. I'm not big on desserts, but the captain crunch milkshake is nostalgically delicious. It's really like drinking frozen captain crunch milk!

As mentioned, the service can be a little dicey, but on my last visit they appeared to be understaffed which can be damning for a Saturday night. Our waitress was doing her best though and was friendly, so I can't really blame anyone but management.

I was the only one at my table to order something different. The rest ordered the American Standard with fries. My girl said it was in her top three of best burgers she's had. I called shenanigans and blamed that nonsensical talk on the Goose. Nah, the burgers were pretty good though.

Awwww), pico de gallo and a myriad of other stuff that I normally don't find on a burger. Super messy.

There are interesting artwork and Russian esk themes on the wall.  I didn't really look around but next time I'll have to take a better gander.

To start off we had a group of 8 that they sat in the high chairs facing two tvs so everyone at the table had a good view (football game was on).  Drinks to start us off after a night of dancing and drinking a captain crunch milkshake. mmmm. it's been awhile since I've had a decent milkshake where it comes in a glass and the extra in one of those metal tins. It was delicious, sweet,and ice cream-y and yet I felt like I was eating my childhood favorite cereal.

The burgers are huge.  I shared the Thanksgiving turkey burger and we still had extra fries left.  Normally they charge a plating fee for splitting plates but our server was cool and instead brought out smaller plates and said there was no plating fee if we cut it up and split it ourselves. AWESOME stars for that =)

The turkey burger was moist and tasted.  I enjoyed the gravy and stuffing in it.  I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the cranberry sauce.  I'm not big on the sweet and salty mixed together but I am sure people who love that will love this burger.
The fries were oddly addicting and one friend was dipping them in her captain crunch milkshake and LOVED it.

The decor is quite nice. Soviet style WW2 pin up girls on the walls. The waitresses had sexy uniforms that resemble soviet era military uniforms and a lot of them are REALLY attractive. 

The food however...I agree with Paolo D's review. It's good but over price. Now if you're a tourist this may not be so bad for you as it's something different from the normal everyday selection of fast food burgers.

For an appetizer, I had the buffalo chicken spring rolls. They were very good. Great crispiness, mellow spice, and an excellent dipping sauce. I would definitely order them again. I also tried the mac 'n' cheese sticks, which were ok, but nothing particularly interesting. The waffle fry nachos looked really good (and such a huge portion).

For the burger, I opted for the short rib sloppy joe. I really enjoyed it. Most every sloppy joe I've had in a restaurant as been a pretty significant fail. This one, though, was quite delicious. Very tender and nice flavors. The fries that came with it were just ok.

I would definitely give this place another try, especially since I haven't had a traditional burger here yet. And I am big fan of the concept and Simon in general.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,1,0,3,bxRCV7PoQCvCfbQaxVyg-Q

The choose your own burgers sounded delicious, but we ended up getting waffle fries and the buffalo chicken sandwich.

I wish the waffle fries were more crisp, but I love that that come with pulled meat, and jalapenos.  The toppings were delicious.

The buffalo chicken sandwich was great.  The brioche was crispy, and light.  It looked voluminous, but really  wasn't.  It was a nice amount of carbs for the sandwich.  The chicken breast was crispy, and the sauce was good.  I love spicy.  It had just enough bleu cheese to add to it, but not overpower it.

I loved the atmosphere, the lighting, and the way all the cooks looked.  I asked the waitress if I could get a photo with one of the cooks because he looked so authentic in his costume.  When she asked him, he blushed.  So adorable.  They let me take a picture, and he looks so KGB!

Some guy was having a custom made burger with lettuce instead of bread.  Looked really healthy.  Looks like they are accommodating for people on special diets.

Also, either the hotel or the restaurant made the mistake of charging an order to our room, when I paid with credit card, but they were nice about it, and it was taken care of.

The story was unusual because the Russians are supposed to be our friends now, and can obtain sensitive information just by asking.  Adding to the mystery, the spies wern't even connected to top secret information.  They were gathering mundane information.

Crap. I am full of mundane information.

I stumble upon KGB Burgers, and am led in by a hostess wearing hip-high fishnet stockings.  She is boobs, legs, and a cute little hat.  There may have been more, but I didn't notice.  Be happy I saw the hat.

She puts me in a super comfortable booth, tucked away from most of the restaurant.  I see more waitresses walking about in the same outfits, and I am truly in my happy place.

Lulled into complancency, the interrorgation begins.

""Are you having  good day?""
""Where are you visiting from?""

After giving up a couple of bits of mundane information I suddenly realize: I am a prisoner of the KGB.  And they are going to pump me for all the seemingly ordinary information they can get.  Their questioning continues:

""Would you like anything to drink?""

I am onto them, and I fall back on my CIA training I would of recieved if I ever was a member of the CIA.  I counter their questions with questions.

""Do you have Stoli Elit?"" (My favorite vodka)

My defence plan works as she ends the interrorgation ""to go check"".  Most waitresses would know this information.  KGB spies would not.

My captor later returned and said they did not have my vodka of choice.  Apparently the KGB is on a budget.  They resume the interrorgation, but I am an unbreakable rock with my counter questions.

Are you ready to order?
How big are your Iron Chef sliders?

She claims 2 oz.  They are listed as appetizers, so this seems believable.

Will that be all?
How big is the cheeseburger soup?

She leaves, and clearly I am winning.  They try to lower my defenses with a martini, and then bring out a bowl of the cheeseburger soup.  Think cheese soup, with about 1/4 - 1/3 lb of ground beef, loaded with french-fry-like cubes of potatoes, a bunch of bacon, and a little cheesey crouton ""bun"".  It's like a cute little hat for the soup.  The soup is much larger than the waitress claimed.  Then again, she indicated the size with her hands, and I wasn't looking at her hands (I was looking at her hat, remember?)

Then they brought me the sliders and the Macaroni and cheese sticks.  The sliders were 2 oz each, times 6 of them.  Thats 3/4 of a pound.  And they were awesome.  Tiny bits of bacon cooked right into the patty, served between the best burger buns I've ever had (they were glazed in butter).  The Mac and cheese sticks were no joke either, but it was enough food to feed me for 4 days.  It was so good, I could not stop untill I was painfully stuffed.  I had to place my arms on the back of the booth in an attempt to stretch my stomach capacity.

My interrorgator returned, and I could no longer resist.

Would you like dessert?
no, thank-you.

Would you like a box?
sure.

They cracked me.

As I write this review, I sit in a pitch black room.  It is 5 am. 9 hours have elapsed since my ordeal, and I am still painfully stuffed.  It may be possible to die from eating too much meat.

A few of the waitresses there looked like they didn't want to be at work, but we didn't deal with them directly.  Speaking of the waitresses, their outfits are a bit much for a burger place.  I mean, corsets and shorts shorts?  Is that necessary when you're serving ""gormet"" burgers?  Not really.  I know it's Vegas, but c'mon!  Polo tees and shorts or slacks would have been fine.  Maybe that's why some waitresses looked miserable.  There are a few TVs so we were able to watch the hockey playoffs while eating.

Every time I mention this place to friends, they have no idea what I am talking about.  I first saw this place featured on the Food Network and on one of my many trips to Vegas, I put KGB on my to do list.  Ever since my lips touched those burgers, I have always come back for more. 

My favorite item on the menu is hands down the, Thanksgiving burger.  Every bite is filled with goodness.  You get the sweet and the salty taste and even a little bit of pilgrim! Just Kidding about the pilgrim, but the combination of turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy, and stuffing really hits the spot!

My most recent experience was by far, the best.  We had JJ as our server and right off the back he asked if anyone has been to KGB before.  My party of 8 sat there in silence and I raised my hand and said, ""I have.""  Being a big fan, I always bring my friends to KGB to not only bring awareness of this awesome place, but so I can get my CAPT'N Crunch shake in after a night of drinks and dancing.  JJ kept checking in on our table and made sure we were taken care of.  The manager Micheal was so thrilled to hear that I'm a fan of KGB that he gave me the shake on the house!  In addition, he didn't charge us for splitting plate fees.  

5 stars, reasonable Vegas prices and great service.  Only downside, is the location of this place, it's all the way in the back of Harrah's.  You'll have to ask dealers and cocktail waitresses to lead you in the right direction.  If you haven't checked out this place, you're missing out!

(Also, I must confess a bias for Chef Simon just because I really don't care for Cat Cora, no flames please!)

So after seeing KGB featured on some food show for their waffle fry nachos my boyfriend mentioned that he would like to try them out. After passing through the smoke filled casino (has Harrah's always been that smokey or am I getting old?) we were greeted by the cutest hostess I have seen to date. I have to say I really did like the ""Russian"" uniform with the hot pants and fishnet stockings. She seated us and asked us if we were on vacation and how we had heard of them. Kudos for pleasant demeanor. The chefs in the kitchen were also wearing green ""Russian"" uniforms and there were provocatively dressed comic book drawings on the walls. And it is amusing to see Stoli chillin' in giant blocks of ice.

Being the little piglet I am, I had the milkshake trio. The captain crunch milkshake was the bomb! My bf had a sip and said to me, ""You have to figure out how to make that at home."" It was like a childhood dream come true. Memories of letting cereal get soggy, then slurping up the sweetened milk, ah, happiness. Moving on, the strawberry was very good but I kind of gave up drinking it because I couldn't get it through the straw. I mean, it IS a drink. The chunks of fresh strawberries were so big it was more like a fruit smoothie. Liquefy that sucker. Also I noticed my love for chocolate seems to be waning as I get older. The chocolate malt milkshake was good. Way chocolate. Way chocolate enough that I couldn't finish the little glass it came in. But still good. Certainly a go for lovers of the cacao bean.

As for the waffle fry nachos, I would really really really recommend this as an appetizer for a table of four. Especially if everyone plans on having an entree. The plate came out heaped a good half foot tall. The waffle fries were covered in oozing melted cheese. After attacking it from the side I managed to dig into the creamy cheese and pulled pork in the middle (yes, I deftly avoided the salsa and slices of jalapeno). So good, so rich, so taking home about three quarters of it. Our (huge) burgers arrived and we began to nosh on those as well. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and my boyfriend had the Double Cheeseburger. My burger was good, I really liked the onion bun. I think they cooked it a little closer to medium rare then the medium I had asked for. The bacon was adequate and the fries were tasty. However, I think I will stick to Five Guys. My bf's was a perfect medium. He commented that it was good, but he would probably have liked it better if he had just built his own.

I think there were only two things I was irked at the entire meal. One was all the food pretty much arrived at the same time. The app was brought then the entrees arrived like three minutes later. The second thing is wiggle room. The plates are tiny. I know that presentation goes a long way but I would like to be able to cut my burger in half and not worry about my fries falling off my plate. I think if I were to go back I would mostly likely sample things other than burgers on their menu. Things like fried mac and cheese . . .",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,0,0,3,W-CRAkoIo1QIFdm52nSsGg

On Friday last week, I had been dying to eat a burger and with all the popular burger joints popping up in Vegas (did a mini trip here before heading to the East Coast), I decided to skim through the local list of best burgers in town. 
We ended up picking KGB because it was the closest to us (we were staying at Paris) and well, I'm Russian so why not visit my comrade. Unfortunately, there was a line but only a 15 minute wait but some obviously rowdy ppl were out and about (I'm assuming for Labor Day weekend) and I felt really bad for the Host, Tiffany, for having to deal with ppl yelling in her face and bitching about the time. Apparently, there was a server on break and even though there was multiple empty tables, not enough wait staff to help out. 
Personal Note: For how busy it was and how busy I overheard it gets, think about hiring extra wait staff.
After we were seated, we had to wait awhile before our waiter even came to us and had already had a huge 10 top of drunk men to take care of before us. When we did meet Eddie, our server, he was obviously extremely busy but was still patient as well and suggested a few things, taking the time to point out different items. I thought this was awesome that he was calm even though he was completely bombarded. Let me just tell you there was A LOT of unhappy patrons here waiting for to give their order and waiting for their check.
J and I ended up ordering the Double Cheeseburger to split with a side of coleslaw and the Captain Crunch milkshake. We asked for it medium rare and when it came out, it was perfect (non pc term: F*ing Amazing!). Eddie had suggested putting the Russian Dressing on the side so the bun wouldn't get completely soaked which was a great tip. The coleslaw came as a big serving so I was definitely happy about that.
Although service was slow, I cannot fault our server for it too much since he there was a lot going on but the time we had with him was great. And another huge shout out for Tiffany who even came to check on us later after we were eating to make sure we were okay and even dropped us off complimentary tickets to the Improv show upstairs (which was HILARIOUS!) This woman needs a MEDAL for dealing with drunk frat boys, sobbing women and obnoxious couples who can't wait 5 minutes for a table.

I had a craving for a very good burger.  I happen to come across this place.  After looking at the menu it looked very good.  I ordered the barbecue bacon Burger.  I was extremely disappointed.  I am not a sauce person, so any dish that I order I always ask for the sauce to be put on the side.  This means the meat needs to be seasoned and flavorful.  After taking 2 bites out of my medium burger I discovered that the meat was dry and not seasoned.  It was on a toasted onion bun, with bacon and crumbles of onion rings.  Sounds great but it was very bland and lacked any flavor and all.  I sent it back. 

After that I tried their chicken tacos, hold the cream sauce.  So it was chicken, pico de gallo, and the shell.  Being very consistent like the burger, the chicken pieces lacked any seasoning whatsoever.

So I ordered two dishes from this place and I left the restaurant still hungry.  Very disappointing. If you're a sauce driven person and depend on the sauce to make the flavor of your meat, then maybe this place is not so bad.

The one thing that keeps this from being a five-star review is that they brought the burger out over-cooked.  They say they cook to order, and I asked for medium rare, but got medium well.

The burgers are creative, tasty, and pretty sizable with everything seemingly made with high quality ingredients.  I really enjoyed the fries, but didn't try one of the exotic milkshakes.  There is an option to build your own burger, but I opted for a predesigned one with all sorts of fun toppings.

Gourmet burgers? 
Cold-War Era Soviet Theme? 
Oh yes! We are going! 

A five minute walk from the Venetian to Harrah's and we were there. Where to start? 

KGB was a delightful experience. I must admit that I expected more from the theme; the decor was decidedly Soviet Union inspired in a comic-bookish sort of way, but less so than I thought. Actually, they struck a very good balance with their art -- anything more would have likely been over the top. The Cold War theme added just the right amount of ambiance without over doing it. 

The food was delivered by a pleasant girl who appeared to enjoy what she was doing and made us feel well at home. My charming companion's analysis of their serving staff pointed out that they too had a theme (or rather each came with a pair of significant themes). How do you say ""Hooters"" in Russian?

Famished from a day of walking up and down the strip in 115 degree heat, we both ordered the BBQ bacon burger (not that we need an excuse to order a proper burger, mind you). Now I swore I would never diminish myself by typing ""OMG"" . . . but . . . OMG, these burgers were incredible. Neither the burger or fries were greasy, and the flavour was phenomenal. I haven't any fancy words to describe what we had, but simply stated, we loved it.

Sober or not, do check this place out. Service is wonderful just as their food!",B7hq00MpWCZPSeixaz5fqw,1,0,4,Q26NuUVok9HM1r24y2KXog

This place is about burgers ! You can pick from their favorites or if your feeling dangerous you can build your own .They have some out of the box burger selections here ,  like lamb, short rib, turkey.

I went with the Cobb Burger $14(Bacon, blue cheese, avocado, tomato salsa,red pepper mayo, sesame brioche bun) and comes with a side or fries. 

When  the burger arrived it looked like a burger photo shoot . I ordered it cooked medium and surprise they cooked it just right, so many places ask then just cook it however they want. I was skeptical about the ingredients , specially the salsa. But after tasting  it. It  was perfection! All the flavors melted in my mouth, man great, best burger I have had in a long time. The bacon in the burger was finely chopped up, so the avocado, blue cheese and salsa were mixed into every bite. I used the fries to pick up the errant bacon bits that fell out  of the burger.

KGB however, should be interrogated and beaten or at the very least sent back to Russia until it can figure out what decent food is.
 
The premise is kind of cool.  Celebrity Chef Kerry Simon decided to do a gourmet burger joint and using an acronym with his name call it KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burgers).  The waiters and waitresses all look like comrades and the joint is decorated if Andy Warhol produced communist propaganda.  But like communism, my enthusiasm waned after but a short time.  

I should have known we were in trouble when the waitress taking our drink orders upon my friend asking for a vodka and soda asked if Pepsi was ok.  I mean I could understand such a ridiculous question elsewhere but this place bills itself as a VODKA bar and she asked if Pepsi was sufficient for a Vodka & soda.  Much like the Soviets invading Afghanistan, this was the beginning of the end.  The menu was interesting enough with a mix of burger specialties and the a build your own option.  The burgers they had were unique and so I opted for the Thanksgiving one.  This was a turkey patty with stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy on a hamburger bun.  I thought like a Bobbie at Capriotti's.  My friends ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandiwich and a Cobb Salad burger as well.  We also started off with this Buffalo Chicken roll appetizer which inspired one word out of me...nyet!

Besides being greasy, which usually I dont mind, there were some vegetables frozen in the center.  Really Mr. Simon, frozen vegetables?  Then the burgers came out and my Thanksgiving option was a mess.  I understand that such a combination will not exactly be the easiest thing to eat but the bun was already soggy by the time it got out to me and eating it was as fun as spending a year in a gulag.  Fries do come with the burgers but the portion is relatively small and they're nothing to write home about.  The hamburgers tasted ok I suppose, but it was hard to tell what I was ingesting because it had become one giant mess after a few short minutes.  

The burgers arent cheap here, 14 bucks give or take, and its on the strip but if the food is going to be so uninspired at least charge us in Rubles.  I now the restaurant is young and its still might be going through some growing pains but man, I havent been this disappointed since Police Academy 3.  Maybe there is a reason Simon's places keep closing down...all I know is that if KGB doesn't make some changes, there might be revolution.  

There are so many other great burger places in Vegas, I have to say KGB isnt worth the time.

The prices were ""stripped priced"" and the food and drinks were, well to be nice I will say just ""eh."" For being a vodka bar you would think they have vodka specials. That is not the case. I ordered a russian apple (10 dollars) and asked the waitress to make it not so sweet. I don't think she understood me because it tasted like a virgin russian apple. so sweet it gave me a headache. I drank half way before I had to order a shot of vodka (6 dollars) to pour in there. It didn't help much. My boyfriend did a custom made burger and we shared some sweet potato tots. Now I don't want to say i have had better sweet potato tots because those were the first time I have had them, but I have had better sweet potato fries. The burger was alright.
I did enjoy sitting at the ice bar and watching the food being prepared. The busboys were nice and checked on us more than our own waitress. It was just  my boyfriend and I sharing a meal with drinks and our bill came to $43 dollars. (not including tip.)
I don't know if I would make the drive here but maybe it is worth trying something else to change my mind.

The service as everyone else says, dicey, the waitress was nice enough but she (or the kitchen) didnt get much of our order right.  My husband ordered the chocolate shake which he said was good, and I got the captain crunch shake which I was disappointed in.  First off, I dont know about you all, but the best part of captain crunch was the crunch berries.  I was expecting the captain crunch shake to have some berries or something, and it turns out that its made out of the other stuff.  The flavor was ok, but the texture was wonky because it had pieces of soggy captain crunch in it.  Weird for me since I think shakes are supposed to be smooth.

Then I ordered the Macaroni and cheese sticks, they were really good.  Then we ordered our burgers.  My husband got the bbq bacon burger and fries, he liked them.  I ordered the Thanksgiving turkey burger and sweet potato tots (because of the yelper reviews for the tots).  The burger was good, but they forgot to put the cranberry sauce on it...then I tasted the sweet potato tots and they were DISGUSTING to me.  Overly sweet and the texture was like underdone sweet potato mush.  If you are the type that likes sweet potatoes sweet with cinnamon and sugar you might like it.  I like my sweet potatoes with salt so this was just overly sweet for me.

I was feeling saucy and so ordered a double cheeseburger of some kind with jalapenos and fries. Suz added an order of buffalo wings. The wings were wee little guys, but had a pleasing crispness; the sauce was pedestrian but I liked the tanginess of it. 

The burger was gargantuan. Well, it seemed so anyway because I did not finish it, but the fact I'd earlier eaten a bone-in ribeye at Mastro's may have had something to do with that.

The cheese was melty and good; I vaguely recall the beef having good flavor and while it was a bit sloppy, it held together pretty well considering it's girth and height.

My kid thinks it's a treat to go visit the ""big city"". Before heading to a magic show we grabbed lunch at KGB. The place was empty so they sat us in a big, comfy booth.

Their kid's menu isn't advertised on their website, but they do have one. It's full of typical kid's stuff and my kid got chicken tenders, of course. For $8 he got a basket overflowing with fries and topped with four large chicken strips, with a side of BBQ sauce and ranch.

I went with a BBQ bacon cheeseburger. It's larger than burgers at some other gourmet burger joints and it was much better than expected. The onion/poppy seed bun was soft, squishy, and thin, which I liked. The patty was thick and tightly formed, but very juicy. Their BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy but didn't detract from the beefiness of the patty. The bacon and onion strings on top added to the deliciousness. Make sure you have extra napkins handy because it's messy. The fries would have been much better if they laid off the salt a bit.

KGB might not be as good as my other favorite burger places on the Strip, but the tasty food makes me think I should give it another try.

When my salad did arrive, it was a big portion. They forgot to give me extra ranch dressing instead of balsamic and when I mentioned it to our server he went and got the ranch. The salad had a mixture of greens that I personally didn't prefer, tomatoes that were sad, 3 dinky little cucumber scraps and shredded carrots. It just wasn't a salad I'd eat again. For dessert we ordered a ""KGB S'Mores"" and was presented nicely. The rice krispies treats were rock hard making them tough to eat. The marshmallows on the top and chocolate sauce that was underneath tasted good and the single strawberry garnish, but that's about it.

Situated inside the out-dated and run-down Harrah's, I didn't have high expectations; we ate at several pricy eateries in Las Vegas earlier in our trip and found all of them marginal. We wanted to eat at Range steakhouse (now closed, Ruth's Chris will go in) and ended up at this place. The atmosphere is decent, cool comic book inspired mural on the walls, the giant block of ice with vodka bottles looks pretty nice.

I got sliders with sweet potato tots, my companion got the Caesar Salad. Who the heck goes to a burger place in Vegas and orders a salad?  Beats me, but it had been hard to find places that did vegetables well. The waitress brought French fries, but promptly brought a whole (not side) order of sweet potato tots. My sliders were outstanding, so were the sweet potato tots. But the best thing was the Caesar salad. Seriously, best Caesar salad I've had anywhere. The dressing is definitely home made and fresh, the flavors are so balanced. The romaine lettuce was served in a wedge and impeccably fresh, like it was harvested to order. Garnished with fried polenta cubes, this salad blew our minds. We loved the dressing so much that we started dipping fries and sweet potato tots in it. 

The only disappointment was the poor beer selection. Highlighting vodka for a burger joint is gimmicky. If I'm eating juicy greasy burgers with fried sides, something bubbly and hoppy really helps cut through the grease.

3758513,2011-09-30,6,loSgYD9dHOsjjm7QCly5qw,"I went to KGB for a really late night snack at around 2:30am.  It was actually a tough decision for me to eat here considering that at this point of my trip, I already had eaten Burgers at other spots on the Strip and didn't really feel like having another one.  I looked at their menu and did see something that caught my attention..... their Bacon Waffle and Fried Chicken Burger.  What the heck??

I've had my fair share of Chicken and Waffles from Roscoe's, to FarmerBrown, and Hash House A Go Go, and even Bouchon, but I've never had them in the form of a sandwich.  So when they brought it to my table, I couldn't help but crack up because it just looked ridiculous (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/loSgYD9dHOsjjm7QCly5qw?select=uznWQt-KgYXi3OEBfGbXJw).  Basically, you get two Bacon Waffle ""Sliders"" with Fried Chicken that comes with a funnel of Tater Tots and your choice of either Maple or Jalapeno Syrup.  I opted for Maple because I thought that Jalapeno Syrup just sounded so weird.  Maybe I should've opted for it though since the dish was strange enough already.  

I really didn't know how to eat this thing because once I put the syrup on the Waffles, I was no longer able to eat it with my hands.  I ended up taking it all apart and just knife and forking it.  I think the execution fell a little flat since the Bacon Waffles were a little overdone and the Chicken was dry.  The Syrup only helped just a little bit to counter the dryness.  I do applaud Kerry Simon for trying to be creative with this dish though.  At least the Tator Tots were good!! 

I guess it's not really fair to judge this spot based on their interesting take on Chicken and Waffles since it's a burger joint after all.  I do appreciate that they're open really late (till 6am).  I'll probably drop by again so I can try their burgers or Kerry Simon's famous Iron Chef Sliders and hopefully have a better experience.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,9,5,3,bxupPMmiBEhlByxkjL9Xow

When we were seated, there was some kind of deliciously tart, sweet, strong Cranberry-Pomegranate-Caipirinha on the table. Unfortunately, the smokey casino left me parched with thirst and I slurped down waaaay too much of that stuff prior to getting anything to eat. Whoa - baby. 

Chef Eli came out to greet us. A nice fellow who told us a little bit about the place, the food, the philosophy, etc. Thanks for the prezo Chef! Onto the food!

I started with the Mac and cheese sticks.  Oh Lord. It was the creamiest, cheesiest macaroni and cheese, chilled (I'm guessing), and sliced into logs. Then coated in some type of breadcrumb, and deep fried to perfection. These mac and cheese sticks were served with (what else?) cheese dipping sauce. I must have gone to heaven. OMG. So delicious. This is enough for an entree for me. Especially after I swapped tastes of other peoples appetizers (the buffalo chicken egg rolls, the sliders, the waffle fry nachos, and something else I forgot), I was basically full.

But I had to order a burger. In fact, I had to go totally overboard (thanks a LOT Cranberry-Pomegranate-Caipirinha!) and order the Short-rib sloppy-joe burger. Imagine the chef, slaving away all day over some short ribs cooking in the oven. Basting them. Checking on them. Tending to them with the utmost care. Then, when they're ready, he CHOPS THEM UP INTO BITS! YEAH, CHEF! Do that thing with the meat cleaver! yeah! Oh excuse me. That was one of the Cranberry-Pomegranate-Caipirinhas talking again. But that is essentially what the short-rib sloppy-joe burger was all about. It came on a poppy seed bun topped with some kind of crispy little dill pickle rounds. Oh Lord.

Um. The fries. Yeah. Take two great big potatoes from the green market. Huge ones. Peel them. Then put them through one of those french fry machines so they come out all uniformly fry shaped. Dunk those potato pieces in hot boiling oil until they are golden brown. Shake off the excess oil (we DO want to exercise a LITTLE restraint here, ha ha!). Generously salt them down. And throw them in a basket beside your short-rib sloppy-joe burger. That is your serving of fries. Huge! Gigantic! Enormous! Wow!

I had a lot of food to eat. But I couldn't concentrate on eating because (what?) of (did somebody pour something into my glass?) the (...make that slurping sound...) Cranberry-Pomegranate-Caipirinhas. Mmmm! So good.

But wait. What is this? Like 2 dozen tiny little cupcakes being delivered to our table? What the....?! Oh Lord. You know I had to eat the one with the KGB emblem sticking out of the top. So fun! The emblem was edible, too! So yum!

The waitresses here wear the ""sexy KGB"" uniform. The lack of length of the skirt did nothing for MY appetite. And she actually seemed quite happy in it. However, she soured a tad bit when we asked to divvy up the bill. She did it and we were happy! Especially with the reasonable prices. (When will they ever realize they get more tip money that way?)

There are Soviet era knock off posters of the proletariat.  Most of the female servers had short, leather shorts that evoked a police state couture.

I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I messaged a good Yelp buddy and asked if he wanted to join me here before our Yelp event last night and use the Groupon.  He has been there before but this was my first visit.

I ordered their southwest burger which the menu describes like this:   avocado, cilantro, lime-marinated peppers and onions, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, avocado crème fraîche, jalapeño-Cheddar bun.  I ordered it rare.  The burger comes with fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly and it was very juicy but none of the avocado was there.  Pico, yes, and cheese, but there was no taste of avocado.  

Service was good during our visit.  Since the place was almost empty, it should have been.  The price was in line with Strip prices.  At first I thought the burger was over-priced but when you factor in the fries served with each sandwich, it is comparable to other burger joints on the Strip.

Little did we know that the burgers are double lunch portions. While I finished mine, I definitely felt that I had a bit much for lunch. Ideally, splitting one of these $12-15 burgers with someone is a decent and cheap lunch on the strip.The burgers themselves are pretty good. They probably process the meat in-house so you can order them rare if you like them that way. I feel like they need to cook them in slightly higher heat since my medium-rare burger didn't have a good sear on it. The fries are good, crunchy but soft on the inside, though a tad salty.

Service was good. No complaints there. And the decor is pretty cool with plenty of tasteful, fake cold war/KGB propaganda styled art.",D9IMOsV39BvoDNb08N9myQ,0,0,4,DE9tvVVX8v4GcvMqBDhIxg

After a night of cleaning up dog food, our group was hungry! Luckily, the DJ took the K9 back in his car and we were relieved of our duties. I had the Orchard Turkey Burger. It was pretty good but the patty was cut in two which resulted in a critical malfunction when I picked it up for the first time! 

Our whale of a gambler secured a $20 discount on his room the next time he's in Vegas (to the tune of (probably) $900 in gambling losses) AND a root beer float. The whale started drinking his float and then declared the price was too high. It must have been good because he started eating the cardboard design they put on top of the whip cream on the float! 

LMK was very impressed with the chef's mustache. After confusing the group (and waiter) about whether the chef made more money because of his mustache, it made sense hours later when we realized he looked like Stalin with the mustache and would make more money by having a Stalin-like mustache. SPOILER ALERT: he doesn't make more money! 

It took me a while to figure out why so many dominatrix's were there. It turns out, they work there as waitresses so don't ask them where there whips are!

Inside Harrah's casino you'll find this place. Although it was unexceptional in feel and overall taste, it was nice to see brie as an option for a turkey burger I had. 

Red Robin's burgers although mass-produced are always assembled cohesively, like the ingredients were meant to be together. My turkey burger minus bacon however, consisted of a flat patty, uninteresting seasoning and the baby greens were haphazardly thrown on. There were two standard-sized slices of brie in the middle of the burger only :/ The fries were fast food fries.

They did have sweet potato tots and they were really sweet--almost like candy. Odd. Very odd. But I'll tell you, if I could handle milk, I would have tried their Captain Crunch milkshake; it just sounded good! Maybe it's because of Momofuku's cereal cookies that makes it sound appealing. And we ordered the macaroni and cheese sticks. No complaints about them. 

The thing that is supposed to set them apart as a burger place is that they are a vodka bar, and they had about 16 to choose from. I like vodka, but if average-at-best food is supposed to be married with fine vodka, I think I'll step off the train at this stop.

We thought it would be funny have her stand next to a Grey goose bottle because they had a massive size bottle by our booths and the darn bottle was actually an inch taller than by niece. 

My family had already ordered and on the table they had onion rings, tater tots, deep fried shrimp and milk shakes. I'm not a huge milk shake fan but KGB's milk shakes were the bomb. 

The menu was quite impressive. There is a section where you can build your own burger so I decided to add an egg to my burger since it was still sort of breakfast at the time we went.

There were a few vodka cocktails (but aren't there everywhere?) and there were pictures on the walls of Russian looking stuff .The servers and cooks were wearing uniforms that I'm assuming were supposed to be from the Soviet era but that's where the theme stopped.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that KGB is not only a Burger Bar, but a Vodka Bar as well. Interesting, Vodka is my favorite toxin. Here's where they lose a star...

The service was a little confused and untrained. I ordered a Moscow Mule and they ran around frantically trying to find out what I was ordering. You would've thought I asked for the combination to the safe... I think our server was new, so in her defense, she tried. I almost went Gerard Butler in 300 on her...""This...Is...VEGAS!"" but no. I remained calm. After two servers and obviously the bartender could not decode the mystery of my order I determined that Las Vegas bartenders have no idea wtf I am talking about when I order the Mule.

She's a petite one, and bless her for battling with this behemoth of meat, pepper jack, avocado slices, spicy avocado cream, lime soaked chili peppers on an Onion bun. It was huge and delicious. Tater tots were ok, but not as much flavor as I hoped for, the fries were a little better. 

My burger was good (3.5), but not as delicious as the Southwestern (5). Maybe they are better at perfecting the items that do not rotate off the menu. Makes sense in hindsight.

THE Cheddar Cheeseburger:  It's plain but the cheese on there is fricken GOOD.  They make that cheddar super crispy and it is just awesome!  I wish there were more fixings on it since all the put is basically the cheese and burger.  

Orchard Turkey Burger:  The turkey burger was nice and moist.  But overall this burger was lacking some flavor but it was a really nice combo of ingredients.  It had apples, red onion, mixed greens, brie, and apple mayo.  Couldn't really taste the apple mayo, wish they put more.

Lamb Burger:  Again not enough sauce!  Was pretty good but a little dry.

American Standard:  Yep just you're plain old burger.  I usually like going for those crazy unusual burgers but my dad loves his plain old burgers and this one was actually really good.

Cali Chicken:  This one was surprisingly good too!  It's not beef but the chicken was super moist and flavorful!

Southwest Burger:  Had a lot of stuff in it but despite all the fixings, still lacking SOMETHING...I dunno.  Maybe not enough sauce again....

I think a lot of them were skimped on the sauces and maybe that's why I wasn't super impressed by some of them.  You can ask for an extra side of sauce so my mom got more tzatziki sauce for her lamb burger and it made it a lot better.

The service at KGB was good.  Our waitress was nice and helpful with the menu items and Harland (I believe a manager) was great.  He actually ran our food out to us and even made some suggestions for our Vegas vacation.

The 2 stars is just for the food.

Turns out, later that evening we needed something quick and decided to give I Love Burgers a try.  Really loved it!! I was much happier with I Love Burgers.  The flavor and the ingredients were far superior to KGB.

So my friends and I were going to see a show at Harrah's at 7 PM and wanted an early reservation. Now I realize it's Friday night but we wanted a reservation for 5 PM. Who's eating at 5 PM?  My friend got the runaround with Caesars reservation line so I tried OpenTable. In a strange turn of events I saw something on OpenTable I've never seen before. It said that the restaurant had no reservations within eight weeks of my requested date. So one would think when we got there certainly the restaurant would be packed. That couldn't have been further from the truth it was not busy at all. And for a restaurant that was fairly not busy the service was less than attentive.  Now the food that is another story. During happy hour all of the appetizers are only five dollars. Since we thought the restaurant would be so busy we got there before five and were able to order the mac & cheese Stix the waffle fry nachos and the fried pickles. Now here's a little tip on the fried pickles they are fried in a Tempora like Batter which is very good but they're very thick spears.  I like my fried pickles as chips.  The waffle fry nachos were fantastic because they had short rib meat on them very delicious. The mac & cheese sticks were also good and came with the cheese sauce which made them very cheesy. For the entrées we tried the turkey burger as well as the cobb burger both were very good.  If this restaurant can get that weird reservation issue worked out as well as work on the service it could be great but until then it's got to be just a three-star.,m96igVtonhN98jfF63lr8Q,1,0,3,em70-ny5i_InmBqmpm-AHA

   Las Vegas is gradually evolving from the buffet to the gourmet burger capital of the World. It seems that every mega resort now includes a gourmet burger restaurant with a few of them owned by celebrity chefs. Inside the Harrah's casino between the Flavor's Buffet and Fulton Street Food Court is KGB: Kerry's Gourmet Burgers.

   My dad, brother, and I were up to something other than a buffet and different. My brother came up with the idea to try KGB.

   The friendly hostess gave a positive first impression. She apologized for inconveniencing us by explaining something to the people in front of us. She led us through the Russian themed restaurant to the lower dining room that overlooked the open kitchen. From that point forward the friendly waitress took over.

   It was difficult deciding on what gourmet burger to order. I could of done the build your own burger option from the menu. But, when I dine in a celebrity chef owned restaurant, I go for the creativity. I ordered stuffed spicy burger with fries ($15) and a soda. The good sandwich featured quality beef with roasted jalapenos, jack cheese, crispy onions, spicy mayo between the jalapeno cheddar buns. It was so filling that I did not even think about a Captain Crunch shake.

  In this Russian themed restaurant, classical music was not the soundtrack.It was rock 'n roll music. Rock 'n roll is only fitting for a restaurant owned by the celebrity chef that Rolling Stone nicknamed ""The Rock 'N Roll chef."" When I looked at Chef Kerry Simon's that were displayed throughout the lower dining room, I saw a man that looked  like Jim Morrison. The plaques also helped tell the Chef Kerry Simon story: ""Kerry has traveled the world developing and opening or overseeing restaurants in Las Vegas, New York, Hong Kong, London and Chicago for Jean-Georges Vongerichten."" 

   In my opinion, KGB is a good gourmet burger restaurant. For reasons out of my control, my chances of returning here are infinitesimal. Sadly, due to Chef Kerry Simon's battle with Multiple System Atrophy, KGB could be closing in the Spring.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,5,6,3,Xu9HYtXHjpV8AfY2Wb8PeA

I got the American Standard burger, cole slaw, and the apple pie shake which was the shake of the month.

It was all pretty below average. Nothing tasted anywhere near as good as some of the more recent hotel burger places like BurGR, and it wasn't even as good as In N Out, Five Guys, Fatburger, etc. I had the $24 lunch grouppon so I added bacon, and grilled onions to the burger. The bacon was kinda limp and chewy. The onions tasted like they were cooked earlier in the day, reheated real quick, and put on the burger. I asked the burger to be cooked medium, and it came out as such. It was cooked well without being dry or tough. The burger automatically came with fries, but there was a option to upgrade to other available sides for a couple of bucks extra. I wanted to try their onion rings, but I was told that they were frozen and not made fresh, so I just stuck with the fries that came with it. It ended up not mattering since the fries were barely warm and looked like they came frozen and out of a bag. I was excited to see that they had cole slaw on the menu, but the sauce just tasted like your average out the jar cole slaw dressing.

I had a couple extra bucks to spend for my groupon, so I ordered their apple pie milk shake for a dessert. I was hoping this would be a highlight of the meal, but I was once again disappointed. There was no point while I was eating the shake where it actually tasted like any flavors associated with apple pie. No caramel, cinnamon, buttery crust, or even apple was ever tasted. The little bit of apple that was in it, didn't have any flavor, and just had the texture of soft mushy apple from a can of pie filling.  The most textured thing in the shake was some type of cookie crumble, and that didn't have any taste either. The whip topping on top was straight up cool whip and not some awesome scratch made whipped cream. So while the apple pie milk shake did not taste anything like a apple pie, it just had a cheap vanilla ice cream taste to it. Ice cream that was only made with imitation vanilla extract. At least the burger I ate earlier tasted like a mediocre burger. There is no reason why a 6 dollar apple pie milk shake should taste like some econo-brand soft serve vanilla ice cream.

The service I received from the waitress was very good. My order was taken in a timely manner, she was helpful in explaining the menu and got my order correct when I customized my burger. My cup of water stayed full, and she dropped extra napkins on my table even before I had to ask.

I was very disappointed in the food that I ate. A office BBQ could have made a better burger and it would have been free. There is no reason for a burger to cost 14+ dollars and the quality being as poor as I experienced. Frozen onion rings, frozen french fries, out the jar cole slaw, and the worst milk shake I have ever had.

It was on a Wednesday right at noon, and the place was nearly dead.  It has a cool feel to it, kind of modern.  The kitchen is open to the restaurant, which was nice.  The chefs actually thanked us as we were leaving, which was appreciated.  We were approached immediately and our drinks were also brought promptly.  I had the Stuffed Spicy Burger, a juicy lucy type burger stuffed with jalapenos and jack cheese, topped with crispy fried onions and spicy mayo.  It's served on a cheddar jalapeno bun.  I loved this burger. Juicy, but all the toppings stayed inside the burger.  A juicy lucy can tend to explode, so that was nice that everything stayed put.  The bun was soft yet stood up to the toppings.  The burger didn't fall apart on me.  This was a 4 star burger.

BUT, I didn't just have the burger.  We also had sides, which is why I gotta give KGB 3 stars.  The burgers come with fries, but I wanted tater tots and my buddy got onion rings.  The tots were a slight step up above those available at your local Sonic.  They weren't as greasy as fast food tots, but they did not appear to be homemade to me.  Same with the onion rings, the breading lacked flavor and they did not appear to be freshly made.  So, great burgers, but what appeared to me to be frozen side dishes.  This was surprising.

First off, the decor was pretty cool with ""1960's Russian propaganda posters and thematic fixtures"". Very modern and hip feel. Our server was cool and fast. A few women servers were dressed in sexy military attire (wish one of them served us). haha.

On to the food. There's a nice selection of house special burgers and a ""build your own"" section. I went and ordered a house item the Cobb Burger. Has bacon, blue cheese, avocado, tomato salsa, red pepper mayo and a sesame brioche bun.

Once i got it....i was like...hmm. The burger was put together kinda sloppy and i wasn't diggin' the basket presentation. I cut the burger in half to see the layers of all the ""goodness"". Still wasn't looking ""wow"". My medium ordered cooked meat looked more like less than medium-rare. So after the visuals i decided to go ahead and take a bite...

Oh... this is pretty good. I wish it was cooked to medium, but  i got the flavor of the bacon and blue cheese and the mayo. the areas where the meat was cooked to my liking was tasty and flavorful. I liked the chopped bacon which is a change from other burgers that have slices. The bun was good, but for some reason it was really filling, And the fries were just ok.

Overall, it was good, It wasn't ""wow"" and a few disappointments. But I'd give this place a try again. Maybe pair a vodka with a burger. hmmm?

I know people complain of prices, but heck. it's Vegas and it's a famous chef's restaurant. Live it up. ;)

All I can say is Kerry F'in Simon has torn down that burger wall! I had heard that Kerry opened KGB Burger at Harrahs and had to check this place out. As there are so many good burger places in NYC I needed to compare. It did not disappoint. 

Walking in you notice the Cold War era decor and industrial look with fun paintings and caricatures on the walls. Upfront area has some high tables and stools, and main floor has many tables and booths. I was drawn immediately to the bar overlooking the cooking station as it is lined with a long block of ice that has holes cut in it to house the fine assortment of vodkas on hand. Very cool and I had to sit there.  

They have about a half dozen signature vodka cocktails and I went with one called The Contract. It is made with Chambord Black Rasberry liquor, Absolut Citron vodka, pineapple juice, cherry and pineapple wedge. Nice strong drink as they don't go light with the vodka here!

Now came the burger. Oh my! Meat, meat, meat! Yay - I was so happy as I bit into this taste of heaven. I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger. Homemade BBQ sauce, Applewood bacon, Smoked Gouda, Crispy Frizzled Onions, all on an Onion Brioche roll. This burger was cooked perfectly. Thick slab of meat, juicy, tasty, and with just the right amount of pink in the middle. French fries on the side were crisp with a nice seasoning on them. I savored this meal and actually ate it very slowly rather then wolfing it down like I normally do!

There are so many burger combinations that look good on his menu. People also told me the Captain Crunch shake here is terrific. I might have to drop in again just to get that!

The burgers were ok, not the best thing I have ever tasted.  If you dont order one of the ""burgers in the black box"" (chef designed) you have to pay per extra on your burger.  They charge for lettuce, tomato,  cheese, mayo, etc.  I thought that was not cool.  The sweet potato tots were a great side and I recommend them.

For dessert we got their famous Cap'n' Crunch milk shake.   it was disgusting.  It tasted like Cap'n crunch that was sitting in milk for a hour.",rlI_yWGmUeJBHN2Bn5LRyg,0,0,2,_1FmQtoyhv5m04o1QQK0PA

For some reason, about two years ago, the world caught up with me and realized the awesomeness of the gourmet burger as well, and lots of places became suddenly part of the awareness of foodies nationwide.

So when my boo whisked me away to Vegas for a long weekend, we took in a Cirque show (the Beatles' Love) and suddenly it was 11pm and we were famished. Nothing sounded quite so good as a big juicy burger, and he'd been to this restaurant in the past and loved it... so off we went.

Service was, honestly, a bit of a mess. We were seated and waited about 15 minutes before anyone paid attention to us. We were toying with leaving as a waitress suddenly realized what had happened and apologized profusely, then doted on us for the rest of the meal. She was very sweet and funny and really remediated for the bad first impression.

The burgers were very good. Honestly, I've had better... The Counter in West Hollywood, Fez in Phoenix, and Hash House just up the road (and in San Diego) still top the list. But it was a B+ burger, an amazing cosmopolitan, and a sweet server.

If you always order a burger cooked medium with bacon, guac and swiss, the only real variable is ingredient quality. This kind of dining gets boring to me real quick.

So why am I giving Kerry Simon's KGB four stars?

Mostly on the strength of one dish - a single appetizer that is an unholy Frankenstein food you'll have dreams about. It's the Waffle Fry Nachos, as seen on Food Network's ""Meat and Potatoes."" Housemade, seasoned waffle fries are topped generously with juicy short rib sloppy joe (!!!!), shredded cheese, queso, pico de gallo and fresh jalapeno rings. The short rib and the fry seasoning are the tastes that hold this deal together. Yum.

Because of my attitude towards most create-a-burger places, I focus mostly on the appetizers here. The Iron Chef Sliders are bite-sized versions of the dish that helped Kerry Simon defeat Cat Cora in Battle Hamburger - patties spiked with bits of bacon, onion and mushroom, topped with ketchup and cheese and nestled in brioche buns. The mac & cheese sticks are way too rich, especially when you dunk it in the accompanying cheese sauce. They also offer the sticks as a burger topping.

Like Samantha G's review, this was more of a 2 star restaurant for me, but my husband mostly liked it so we're averaging at 3 stars.  My husband who works with the government, where the cold war threat is still alive and kicking, found the Russian theme amusing and kind of cool.

We were here with a large group for a Yelp event before the Mac King Show at Harrah's.  We were given a choice of four appetizers, and since no one seemed interested in the waffle fry nachos, I went with those, assuming since they were complimentary that they would be small plates.  Nope, I got a huge pile of waffle fries with cheese sauce, shredded cheese, short ribs and fresh jalapenos.  It was overwhelming to look at and it was difficult to eat, especially when there were burgers also coming to the table.  I was not down with the short ribs and wished they were left off, but my husband loved them.  My favorite part of this monster of a dish was the fresh jalapenos, so much that I picked many of them off the dish.  I could barely make a dent in this.

As for the burgers themselves, while I found them interesting, and was happy they would allow us to order our burgers medium rare, they came out pretty much raw in the middle.  If the beef is good quality, sometimes I don't mind this.  However, the flavor of the meat just wasn't as good as other casino gourmet burger joints, such as Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay.  It kind of reminded me of eating something on par with Farmer Boys, but more than twice the price.  My husband on the other hand, had the Cobb burger and liked it (sans avocado and veggies because he hates healthy stuff), but thought that the way they serve bacon was kind of odd.  Instead of putting bacon strips they literally grind it into a grainy spread.  While I understand why this is done (to get bacon taste in every bite), but neither of us found that it enhanced the flavor of the burger.

Overall as others have said, if we were staying on the property, this is a good choice to eat at.  As a local, I don't think this is worth going out of the way for as there are better options.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,1,3,bhD8JcAcZ-BuN0qsiWD_Tw

The manager, Kate,  said she was very sorry she could not change the price it was out if her control.  What is she the manager of  then????

I do know that Jennifer, my server, is built closer to the first description and was pretty attentive as well, without being overly suffocating.  She gave me helpful suggestions about what to order, puts the order in, delivers it and leave me alone to enjoy my food.  

Besides that, I also know that ordering the Double Cheeseburger was a great idea, and very satisfying as far as burgers go in Las Vegas.  I ordered mine Double Cheeseburger cooked medium rare, and the kitchen staff prepared it nicely.  Even the side of fries that came with the order was tasty.  I unfortunately also learned that Kerry's special sliders are the worst sliders I have ever had in Las Vegas.  Food trucks served better sliders than the uncreative sliders you can but should definitely not order here.  The Captain Crunch Shake was decent, but I felt that it would be better if the cereal is blended into finer bits in my shake.

Recap:

Double Cheeseburger - if you are hungry, get this.  The fries are good, but paying $2 or 50% of what these fries or onion rings cost to substitute it is pretty lame.  But you might as well gouge the tourists and locals that ends up having a meal here while you have the opportunity.

Sliders - the first one I tried tasted like the meat was going bad.  The after taste in my mouth was day and night difference compared to the all beef patties in my 2x Cheeseburger.  Plus with just a small piece of cheese and small slice of tomato in each slider, I am thinking I would probably enjoy a cheeseburger from Burger King more.

Captain Crunch Shake - just vanilla ice cream blended with milk and the yellow Captain Crunch.  Not bad, but I will save the $6 and get something else to satisfy my sweet tooth in the future.

Also, be sure to stop by and get yourself a Total Rewards card if you plan to dine here or the other Caesars properties.  Those $1 savings on each menu item here can rack up quickly to offset the taxes owe on your dining excursion.

3 stars.  Would be higher, obviously, had I not been hungry enough to order them lousy sliders after happily polishing off the fantastic Double Cheeseburgers.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,5,3,VZ9oHrNID3DQi9uHOfTI5w

We came upon KGB and since I have an unnatural obsession with all things communist, soviet and burger I was into the idea of trying this place even though the Yelp reviews weren't raving about it.

Let me begin by saying before we even decided to head over to Harrah's I had it shoved in my face by advertisements galore that KGB was the brainchild of ""Celebrity Chef"" Kerry Simon who I'd never heard of before. I didn't think anything of it since it's common nowadays for ""celebrity chefs"" to have restaurants all over Vegas. However when I saw a framed picture of him the instant we walked up to the restaurant I was a little put off. As the hostess walked us from the hostess stand through the dinning room I couldn't help but notice how poorly designed this restaurant was. What ""celebrity chef"" thought this was OK? It felt awkward with various secluded corners that were empty. Next, to add insult to injury we were seated at a table right next to a plaque praising this ""Master Chef"". Really? Come on guy.... get over yourself. 

I kept looking around at the cartoons painted on the wall unsure what to make of this place, the waitress was half naked and half in uniform. I don't want to see cellulite jiggling on someones ass as they carry food around. 

The worst blow came when I saw the menu and realized that for the most part this was a build your own burger kind of joint. I had a similar reaction to Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay except his place was very understated and his face and name weren't so blatantly plastered everywhere. The menu also featured a captain crunch shake. Come on.... I created a Cookie Crisp shake when I was 8 can I put my picture up in a frame now? 

I don't have a problem with fun kitschy places like this that serve burgers and shakes, but spare me the ""celebrity"" and ""master"" mumbo jumbo.

The burger I created was delicious!!! I chose a beef patty well done, on a whole wheat bun, with caramelized onions, a beefsteak tomato and herbed goat cheese. I also ordered a side of sweet potato tater tots and a side of pesto aioli for dipping. I loved my food so I would eat here again.

However...I still don't understand why chefs are so proud of their burger restaurants when their creations and concoctions aren't the main event and customers are essentially building and creating their own burgers!",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,0,3,Cw89-hY0BEZg7y7HaE-s5g

She was everywhere, running foos, sweeping, seating, taking drink orders!!! Definitely needs a promotion! Her service made my great burger absolutely phenomenal!! Thanks KGB'S!",YfKxfIsxCkoVlDrdqou1Sw,0,0,4,Vzn05zO2qxpDPsccycufag
