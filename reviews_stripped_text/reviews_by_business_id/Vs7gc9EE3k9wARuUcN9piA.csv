15728,2011-10-25,0,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"We were disappointed given the 4.5 star yelp rating, and such a long drive from the strip to get there.

Aside from the entrees which qualify for the $ rating (around $9, add another $1 for a small bowl of rice), our appetizer and soup were definitely $$$.  Shrimp Tom Yum soup for 5.95 was a personal serving size; we ordered two portions for the four of us, and it was two strips each of red and green bell pepper and a total of 7 shrimps (I should have asked if one portion would be 3.5 shrimps).  

Curry and pad tai noodle were of good flavors, but beef was overcooked and the dishes are definitely not 4.5 stars standard.  Afterward we became convinced that because the merchant had a paid-advertisement on yelp that it had gotten bonus points by yelp.

Oh and, the place has an open kitchen, so you will smell somewhat when you leave. The first impression of it is a fast-food joint.",vEBjNDJpy3XhI_6VgWBQWA,2,1,3,h-E_-jipLr0FsaadYHz9mQ

I heard good things about Pan Asian and finally got to try it out when I was on this side of town.  It's in a little strip of buildings, next to nothing in particular and we almost drove past it.  When we got inside we knew it was our kind of place: small, homey feel with super friendly owners.  I don't need some stuffy restaurant on The Strip- give me a place like this any day!

After being told they could make many of their menu items vegetarian, we decided to let them call the shots.  I wanted a curry and a noodle so David (I think that was his name) said we should get the Massaman Curry and the Stir Fried Linguini.  

The curry was made with veggies and tofu and had a nice flavor to it.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I only wish that it had a little more spice (we ordered medium) and some more veggies (it looked a little soupy, even for a curry).  The noodles had a good amount of heat (also medium), lots of flavor, and were packed full of fresh vegetables.  I was actually pretty surprised at the amount and quality of veggies I was given.  This was my favorite dish of the two.  

We also ordered a Thai Tea and Fried Ice Cream.  Both were good, but I have favorites elsewhere.

In all, I felt like I was invited to someone's home for dinner when I was here.  The owners are very warm and want to make you are as happy as possible while providing great-tasting and comforting food.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,2,4,3AIKqs6x6mruHsICJbwU2w

The Wonton soup was amazing. The broth is well developed and delicious. The dumplings were juicy and tasted great!

For entree my fiance got the Rad Nah Noodles and I got the Drunken Noodles. I tried her dish and it was awesome. The vegetables were cook well and not soggy like you find in some restaurants. It was a play on Beef and Broccoli but way better. With the Drunken Noodles I got them with Shrimp. The server let me know their restaurant is the hottest when it comes to spice level. I got 5/10 since it was my first time there. OMG SPICY! The noodles were perfect, shrimp great flavor, but it was incredibly SPICY. The server was awesome though, he saw how I was struggling so was diligent about filling my water. I jokingly said to him to just leave the pitcher and he did!

The Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad was incredible until I ate a piece of Shrimp. I personally didn't like the grilled taste because the charred pieces really throw off the rest of the salad. If the shrimp was sauteed, man oh man I would order this all the time. It's a perfect blend of sweet and sour. Now I love Basil fried rice and this comes to a close second for best Basil fried rice (Archi's). The yellow curry was surprisingly good as well. 

I only saw a couple issues with this place. 1) if you come with more than 3 people you have to sit next to the door. The day we went, we had to sit next to the door. No bueno. 2) Their spicy rating scale is scaled way down. Ordered 8 & 9 but tasted like a 2 or 3 to me. I had even toned it down for the people accompanying me to dinner, normally I do a 10 plus add more hot sauce. 

The owner is awesome and it's fun watching the chef do her thing. We did the Yelp deal and um we spent more than we thought.

We finally travelled  to that side of town to celebrate a friends' birthday dinner.  Sadly, I wasn't that impressed and several members of our group went home that evening with stomach troubles.  

We tried a variety of dishes and the ones that really stood out to me were the Malaysian Roti and the Tempura Cheesecake!  The roti was crisp and not too greasy.  The curry sauce on the side was full of flavor but I wished it was a tad thicker.  I didn't expect the cheesecake to be as good as it was - the batter was light and the cheesecake was nice and tangy.  

Some other dishes we got were: shrimp salad, fried tofu, basil fried rice, pad see yew, and panang curry.  IMO everything was on the salty side as I feel like I had a gallon of water while I was there.  None of these really stood out to me.  I've had better versions of all these dishes elsewhere.

I see a lot of other reviews mention the spiciness, but David does a good job of mentioning the spiciness of each dish before you put in your order.  Guess he's paying attention to these reviews.

Pad Thai:  Good, not too greasy like other restaurants.

Massaman Curry:  I've never tried this type of curry before but as an Avocado fan, it was great to have avocado in my curry.  My mom normally doesn't like curry but she liked this one.  My favorite dish of the night.

Drunken Noodles:  I've never had drunken noodles before but this was pretty good too.

The massaman curry is a must for curry-lovers. It's on a whole other spectrum of curries. Sweet and spicy; the vegetables are super fresh. 

The beef noodle soup, their version of pho, had a wonderful broth. It has an added flavor that we just couldn't put our finger on...

The beef salad was THE best we have ever had. Less salty and more tender than our usual thai orders.

Looking at the menu, most of the dishes are Thai, with a few Chinese and Vietnamese twists here and there. I ordered the Stir-Fry Linguine with chicken and my friend ordered the Pad Thai with chicken. At other Thai restaurants I would usually request a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the spice level for my food, but the owner told me that their level 5 spice was the equivalent of 7 or 8 at other places, so I ordered a 4. Thank god I did because my linguine came out to be quite spicy! There was an abundance of chicken meat, peppers, and asparagus in my dish, and the flavor was great without being overbearing. I had a taste of my friend's Pad Thai and it was also tasty, but because my friend didn't add any spice to it, I didn't enjoy it as much as my linguine.

I can't say that I have been to any other Asian restaurant that consistently tastes as bright and fresh as the food prepared here. I love spicy food - but I have to say, this place knows how to add some heat. I can easily eat a level 9/10 at other establishments, but here, I can only tollerate levels 3 to 5 depending on the style of dish. 

Top picks:

Crying Tiger Salad w/ Beef
- I would order this at a lower heat level than you would traditionally order, since the acid in the salad amplifies the spice level. 

DW Fried Rice
- It's the best I've ever had - and if you're not adventurous, this is a great first dish for you. 

Massaman or Red Curry
- BOTH are perfection. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and if you like heat, add it here.

Drunken Noodles
- I have yet to find a better pad kee mao in town. Delicious!

For dessert, you'll have to order the mango w/ sticky rice, or the fried bananas. Both dishes are only offered when the produce is perfectly ripe and in season. If it's not - they won't serve it!

Secondly I was in the mood for soup so there are two locations you can find them on the menu. I was told the ones under the Soup are ""appetizer"" size and the ones listed under Noodle and Rice are considered the large portions.

I decided to get the pork rice noodle soup and if you like pho and if you like garlic then you'll love the rice noodle soup they have. Broth was full of flavor, taste like it had fish sauce in it already. The roasted garlic complimented the ground pork and fish ball, yummy. My only complaints are that the sprouts were already in the soup when they served it, which made them partially cooked and less crispy and also, I found a lot of garlic skins in soup which I had no intention of eating.

Overall I was very happy with the meal for the price. It's a unique soup and I will come back to have more.",OvHYa3jg6ZJceNH1XU772w,1,0,4,DVIbGC8G4WDxY1px15lVLQ

I've tried take out here before - chinese food - but wasn't all that impressed. Went back to dine in tonight and strictly ordered Thai food. Much better than initial impressions.

Service was a little spotty. We didn't have all our place settings and they seemed to always forget about my little guy. Just because he sits in a high chair doesn't mean he doesn't drink water or need a plate for his food. Other than the occasional reminders, waitress was attentive and owners filled in when necessary.

Ordered the massaman curry, shrimp mango salad, pineapple fried rice, spring rolls, chicken pad thai, and satay - all without any spice due to the kids' sensitive and picky palates.  Every dish was excellent and tasty. The salad had a tad too much fish sauce for my liking but I think all Thai salads have too much fish sauce.  This was a lot of food for our family of five but I happily took home leftovers.

Not sure I would eat some of the Chinese food on the menu again, but I am definitely coming back for Thai.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,1,1,4,o7vFOJap9p-aUYO9zBVlJg

Everything I've tried here has been outstanding.  Pleasant presentation, complex flavors.

The owners are very kind and take great care in making sure the customer has a good experience.

One last thing:  be careful with the spice levels.  I had to convince Mr. Wong into letting me have the panang curry at level 5.  It was probably the equivalent of a 7 or 8 at other places in town.  My parents had take out recently and ordered at level 7 - that couldn't have gone well!  :)

After a whole day of shopping with a friend of mine, I choose the restaurant for dinner and loved everything I ate (granted it was only two dishes).  I ordered a chicken garlic pepper and my friend ordered a chicken red curry.  They asked both of us what level of spice we wanted and they made the spice to the tee!  Her's was a 6-7 and mine was a 3...It reminds me of my parents restaurant they used to own in Dallas, very personable, small and friendly!  It was the mom, dad and daughter!  The favors were very unique, unlike most Asian restaurants I have been too, where they just sloop on soy sauce and call it Szechuan sauce, black bean sauce or garlic sauce...everything had a very distinct favor to it!  Which made the meal even more savoring and worth going back again and again to try all the dishes. 

I loved the food we had that I ordered a red curry with chicken to take home.  The only thing that was a bit difficult was the place was a bit hard to find.  But I know where it is located now so I don't think it will be a problem.

Honestly it was the other reviewers pic and comments that enticed me to go and try. I was looking forward to seeing/meeting the owner David because of all the compliments of how nice and hospitable he was. 

We went in on a Saturday around lunch time and there was another couple in there. I was surprised and a little excited to see that David was in fact there.  He seemed very polite, there was any unnecessary hostess or waiters, just him.  Which I liked. I had my two children with me, one in which is a 3 year old and David paid extra special attention to them. 

Another great observation was that it had an open kitchen as to where you are able to see what and who was cooking the meal. A real plus for me because I like to see the cleanliness of the kitchen. 

Everything I ordered was purely based on yummy pics of precious yelpers. This was what we ordered:

Appetizers: chicken satay and Vietnamese ravioli

Entrees: XO pork spareribs, pad seeyew with chicken, and the DW fried rice

Dessert: deep fried cheesecake

We loved everything except the ravioli. Prices weren't too bad.  My fave part was when David came over and asked my kids if they wanted ice cream and of course they said yes. It was complimentary of course. And I loved that. The cheesecake was heavenly!!!! The fried rice was the tastiest ever!!!! We shall be back soon!!! Go and try it!

Food was good, had tons of flavor. Things we had:

Malaysian Roti: Not amazingly good, but I was impressed with how it turned out especially since the person that ordered it had no idea what it was. The contrast in texture between the crispy outside and chewy inside was very enjoyable and the sauce was quite nice.

Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad: Can't say I was too fond of this one. The shrimp was still raw on the inside, though for a salad maybe that's how it's supposed to be? The main detractor for me was the copious amounts of mango on it. The mango flavor overwhelmed everything else.

Singapore Noodles: Definitely one of the best dishes we had, was well cooked and flavorful.

Garlic Beef: Advertised as ""1000 times better than broccoli beef"" by the owner himself. Granted nothing can be 1000 times better than broccoli beef, it didn't disappoint. It was heavy on the salt and pepper, probably too salty on it's own for most people's liking but not me. Fortunately it comes with a side of rice that I highly advise you use.

Pad Thai: Perhaps the most disappointing dish. Not very authentic if you ask me. It wasn't sweet enough, was PINK, and had no peanuts. Nonetheless it was still pretty tasty, though it's pretty hard to make Pad Thai not taste good. The only Pad Thai I've had and didn't like was from Buffet @Asia.

Probably the worse thing about the restaurant is the lack of staff. There's one person that stays in the kitchen and cooks, and then the other triples as a cook, server, and cashier. When my water ran out, I didn't even want to ask for a refill seeing how bad the customer:employee ratio was. Seeing how Tom knew the owners and he's a regular, I hoped we'd get some sort of a discount.",W3PPwr4cNh3RJIK7JtUIlQ,0,0,4,dtbRpnA6qBgB_B1AbwY9SQ

1555148,2013-10-16,0,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Wow! I was intrigued by the huge number of reviews on Yelp, and the 4.5 star average at our venerable site, of Pan Asian Restaurant. Since it is just a few miles from home, we went there for my birthday dinner. The charming owner and his gorgeous wife, who does the cooking, were intent on making our visit a superb experience. They succeeded with a fresh, five-star meal served in clean and cheery surroundings. The place is intimate without being dark, a rather unique feature for Las Vegas. The ceiling is a fashionable black with light-fixtures built into it that resemble shoji screens. Being a Pan-Asian establishment, I was able to order a delightful chicken-based gyoza appetizer and one that featured beautiful, architecturally-sound chunks of deep-fried tofu that were both prepared in the most appealing ways. My husband enjoyed his chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce on the side, which I also tasted and thought were ideal. I like very hot seasoning, so I packed my own heat in the form of crushed, dried Japanese chiles, in case they did not offer my favorite condiment, Chinese-style red chile oil. I was pleasantly surprised when Mr Wong, the owner, brought a full panoply of elegantly presented hot chile condiments in a black porcelain caddy.. I didn't miss the red chile oil, as he had included sriracha, two vinegar-based red chile sauces, jalapeños and a dry Japanese pepper mix, something I use regularly at home. 

My main dish was something that caught my eye because it contained beef with fresh greens of various varieties, and had the jazzy name, ""Crying Tiger."" It was a voyage of discovery, every bite containing the various components in different amounts. Its thinly-sliced beef was exquisite; next time I shall ask it to be well-done, because it seems that the cook aims to please. In fact, as my husband pointed out, within that one dish there was something to reward any beef-aficionado, because some slices were more cooked than others. The freshness and flavors of the health-promoting were most impressive, but to describe the assemblage fully here would be to deprive other diners of their own adventures in good eating.

My husband ordered the pineapple fried rice, without the shrimp component. He was delighted that the gracious cook customized it to his taste. I had a bite, and it was uniquely delicious.

Pan Asian is a friendly, pitch-perfect place where I intend to try some of the other fresh, lovely offerings soon--pad Thai comes to mind.... After all, the place is called, ""Pan Asian Restaurant""!",FhmErJANfSlct6DbmYnJWg,3,3,5,p7ni8m5I2009hn1FcdhvrA

It is a 25 minute drive from where I live to the restaurant, I have to drive through Chinatown to get there.  Its worth the drive.   David and Lisa are husband and wife and the owners of the place.  The kitchen is open so you can see exactly what is going on.  It is very clean.  They will make you feel like family.  David makes it a point to know everyone by name and the next time you come in he will ask about the people that were there last time.  The food is top notch I have eaten at several Thai restaurants including one in town that is a favorite on the food network channel, there is nothing that is close to the quality of food that Chef Lisa prepares.  She will vary the heat according to your taste.  I like an 8 on most things, in the soup it is a slow heat that builds.  She uses fresh Thai peppers and they do not release their heat immediately, so be careful.  I normally order one of the soups to start an entree and then dessert.  The Fishball and Beef Noodle Soups are both excellent.  They are always asking us to try something new, that isn't on the menu.  The Red and Duck Curries are incredible.  Each of the ingredients maintains its individual flavor and yet they all work together.  Sometimes they have a Key Lime Pie in a small cup it is yummy.  Maybe if I mention it enough people will ask for it and they will have it all of the time.  It is the perfect compliment to the spicy food.  The Sticky Rice with Mango and sesame seeds is very nice.  There is a little bit of sea salt that accents the warm sticky rice and the ice cold mango with coconut milk. If I find something that I don't like I will let you know but so far everything that I have tried I would eat again.  it is getting tougher to get through the menu as I go back to what I have eaten before.",iyhsmIqCFTy9paRN-SZnHw,0,0,5,oEdKXyzsQoKjbXHMakXGTg

We followed up with the chicken Panang curry with gorgeous green beans and bok choy. The ingredients weren't submerged in sauce, which as David explained, is how they do it where he is from in Thailand. Instead the dish is nicely coated with a healthy helping of curry, which wonderfully united the textures and flavors of the fresh vegetables and chicken.

4.  Spicy Basil with chicken - Yummy stir fry with a bunch of different greens 
5.  Black Pepper Chicken - Similar to the spicy basil stir fry but more black bean sauce.
6.  Pineapple Fried Rice - This had a very pleasant aroma of curry and pineapple. Delish!
7.  Red Snapper - Delicious seafood in a non-fancy restaurant?  It sure it.  It was deep fried with tangy sweet and sour sauce.

I have enjoyed everything that I've tried so far , especially their chicken satay and Massaman curry. I really like flat noodles so you can never go wrong with their pad see ewe or drunken noodles (aka pad kee mao) for entrees. We have also tried their red curry w/ duck (one of their daily specials). Their red curry has eggplant and pumpkin in it ! I'm used to just having bell pepper and bamboo in my red curries but eggplant and pumpkin made the dish so much better. The duck was a bit more on the dry side but I think it complimented the curry. 

Their spice level is from 1-10 and it's very accurate. A ""5"" is definitely mild and ""10"" must be insanely spicy since we ordered an ""8"" on our second visit and it was super spicy that we were sweating. It was a good kind of spicy though but I think if I got a ""10"" I would probably cry LOL. 

Seating is alright , feels like a spot between a sit down restaurant and fast food place. I like that they maintain this place pretty clean though and they have an open kitchen.

RIGHT!

Picked up asian takeout for three tonight for just under $30- seafood soup, beef pad se ew, and chicken masaman curry, extra side of rice. Portions were okay but were split among three, pricing was fair but seafood soup could have been larger. Good for $7 price, but not a meal on its own. Curry was heavy on the potatoes, so with the rice it was pretty starchy, but that kept it from being too spicy. Pad se ew was among the best BF has had, and it's the main thai dish he gets everywhere we go.
Side note about the soup: pick out the green pepper pieces prior to eating unless you want to spit out your soup in spicy surprise. Otherwise, the mix of crab, mussels, shrimp, and octopus is delightful.

Service was good. Ordered to go, just a few minutes prior to close, and was helped with a smile and the order was out quick. Saw a few pictures of dishes above the counter after we ordered, but did not find them on the menu itself- shrimp and fish ball soup, duck soup, etc., unclear whether they're special features, by request only, or no longer on the menu.

The gentleman working there (Owner?) was extremely friendly. He asked if I had eaten there before. When I said no, he asked it I eat Asian food often and If I would need assistance deciding what to eat. I found this to be very thoughtful.

I ordered chicken Pad See Ew which was ready in well under 10 minutes.
WARNING: I got #2 spicy and it kinda kicked my ass.

I docked them 1 STAR for giving me A CHOP STICK, which as far as I am aware, are supposed to come in pair. Not their fault, but when I want to pretend that I came being ""cultural"", I need the right utensils :)  

THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY!!",rdysF0ymVkMX82Bu_8x3nA,0,1,4,MkYDhQ0IpzT6sydrrK-s6w

However, when I purchased won ton soup ""to go"" for lunch, I was disappointed in the quantity of won ton and portion of the soup.  I would of thought I would at least have more soup base, but didn't. It was very small bowl, and only FOUR won tons. For $5.95, that's pretty steep in cost for the over all portions size. Usually a tiny small bowl like that I have seen in other restaurants were between $2.95-$3.75.

The soup was good, but didn't enjoyed the experience as I was a bit annoyed on how much I paid for such as small portion.  It's not like it's a 5 star restaurant which I would expect it to be pricey.  

The next time I want soup, I better off going to Chinatown or Panda Express.  Better value in my money and 3x as much soup and product.",7HAaQMMN8zvxW2-q2oZ7oQ,0,0,2,uJnWtKr0PvuYj93ZUue4Qg
1924763,2011-08-08,1,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Thursday night and my sisters and I were looking for a place to eat.  We were thinking somewhere different yet worth it.  I didn't want to go too far and i didn't want to spend a ton of money either so I suggested Pan Asian.  I had been there before, but my sisters had yet to experience this fabulous little restaurant. 
     We got there about 7 and were the only ones in the restaurant.  We were immediately greeted by the owner.  He told us the specials, a whole red snapper deep fried and served with a sweet chili sauce, and crispy duck served similar to Peking style.  While looking at the paper menu, I couldn't help thinking that the specials sounded amazing.  So we ordered the green papaya salad, the red snapper, and the crispy duck. 
     We ordered the green papaya salad with a spicy scale of 3, but when I tasted it, it seemed spicier.  It was really good, with great flavor and a nice crunch, but we couldn't get pass the spiciness.  Chef Lisa apologized and said she used a fresh chili and could see that it was spicier than normal.  She said she would tone it down a bit for the red snapper.
   The red snapper came out and looked beautiful.  It was sitting upright on a plate with lots of veggies and a nice sweet chili sauce.  I normally do not eat fish, but the snapper was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it so well.  I couldn't help but have some.  We ended up eating the whole thing.
     I love duck and was not disappointed with Chef Lisa's crispy duck.  The crispy duck was served with flour tortillas and 3 different sauces: mango, hoisin, and curry.  Along with the several pieces of crispy duck was crispy duck sauteed with bok choy in a black bean type sauce.  The duck was crispy on the outside and so tender and moist on the inside.  It had a great anise/five spice flavor that is common in duck.  All of the sauces were great with the duck and I thought the tortillas were a nice change from the buns you normally get with Peking duck.  The sauteed crispy duck with the bok choy was equally amazing with lots of flavor.  If this was on the menu by itself, it would be worth ordering as well.
   The bill came out to where I expected it to be.  The food was well worth the price.  It was gourmet, but in a place where I wasn't afraid to use my hands with the duck or the fish.  I will definitely go back to Pan Asian and I'm looking forward to trying other things on their menu as well as any other specials that they may have.",EOKn-R0VENWdHybgnVPBpg,0,1,5,i-Toi5MStJBL_lHJ9A4-LA

1939630,2011-05-26,15,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Food cant be this good. Nothing on this universe tastes as good as food from Chef Lisa. It shouldnt!! It defies some laws of physics!!

So here are my theories on why the food is so good or how it was made:

- The Restaurant is actually a wormhole or gateway to a parallel universe where food is always that good. If this is the case i want to journey to this parallel universe and never leave.

- Chef Lisa is a robot or an android or a cybernetic being sent from the future to help us fight against crappy food. This would explain how she got three orders to come out all at the same time without aid

- Chef Lisa is a wizard, she conjures up food using magic, wizardry, spells. This would explain the fast service and magical taste of the food.

- Chef Lisa is an alien that uses advanced technology to create food that will blow us away. 
If this is the case then her intentions are not clear but may include but are not limited to
 + studying our social habits
 + fattening us up for invasion/dinner
 + observing mating rituals
 + set us upon one another and destroy the very fabric of society in search of that oh so good bowl of noodles

The food can only be described as 'supernatural'. Regardless of how and why it came to be i will willfully and happily return again and again.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,4,5,5,v_z71yHCkWvyKYhYDYP52Q

Food is great. We tried 8 different dishes on the menu and you could not go wrong with any of them. The pineapple fried rice was definitely savory and packed with flavor.

I stumbled upon Pan Asia, and oh my!!! this is by far the best Thai food I've had. I have been going here for about a year now (2-3x a month), it is worth the 8 mile drive, their food never disappoints me. 

I normally order basil fried rice, mango salad, Thai lettuce wrap, and fried ice cream. I have tried other dishes as well.

Watch the spice level!  1-10 is not the same as other places... so when they warn you, please take heed.  

I really like Pan Asian.  When we went on Saturday- we were the first customers in the joint.  They accommodated our party of 9 + a baby.  It's not a very large place.. We literally took up half of the restaurant.

Our waiter was very polite, as was the rest of the staff.  He made a lot of good suggestions, warned us about the heat levels.... and immediately took our order since we had some time to look at the menus .  

I don't even remember what everyone else had.. but i remember what I had. ha! 
I started with the malaysian roti because I love that stuff... and Pan Asian did not disappoint.   The yellow curry was creamy and full of flavor.    My entree: was MORE CURRY! Massaman, and I love it!  

*What I do remember is my daughter ordering the vietnamese shrimp ravioli and marking the heat at 1-- and it was WAAAAAY to hot... even for the spice lovers at the table.  

Next time we are ordering with 0 spice.  hahaha.. seriously.  If this place wasn't so far I'd be visiting as often as we visit our favorite local thai joint in our area.

I was on the hunt for spicy food, some of my fellow yelpers recommended this place so I decided to give Pan Asian a try. 

As a starter we ordered the Gyoza, it was good, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. 

For my main meal I ordered the linguini noodles with chicken, my palate is very sensitive so on the scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness I ordered a 2. Let's just say I'm ordering a 1 next time. The noodles were amazing though, they were packed with a lot of flavor and a great amount of kick, my nose was running like niagara falls the entire meal. I'm not sure what noodles my husband ordered but he did order the noodles a level 8, he said he liked them as well but was expecting the noodles to be spicier, he's going with a level 10 next time. 

For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake, it's like a slice of Heaven in your mouth, its so rich and creamy and it's served with whipped cream and ice cream.

We chose the roti for an appy and the crispy duck (today's special, $19.95, probably one of the priciest items on the menu).  The roti came with a lovely curry sauce, more sweet than spicy.  Our duck was lovely, crispy, and meaty.  Accompanying the duck were three sauces: curry, hoisin, and mango (my fave), along with stir-fried bok choy, steamed rice, and tortilla wraps.  I'm so glad I shared the duck, as portions were generous.  

David came by several times to refill our water glasses and to admonish us to ""share our food.""  He also looked at my husband valiantly nabbing julienned slices of carrot and told him: ""don't waste the food.""  :)

The restroom was spotless, definitely a great sign for a restaurant.

We came here for Sunday lunch on the recommendation of my friend and I was definitely not disappointed. The prices are reasonable and the selection of choices have your usual favorites of Thai food. The waiter warned us as we were ordering about the spice level (from 1-10)...we were told to get about a 3-4 as that would be spicy enough. It had a good kick and after eating the entire meal, I could feel the spice, but it was not overwhelming. I can only imagine the burning of a 7-8. HOT STUFF!

We got a nice selection of food...started with the Crying Tiger (Thai Beef Salad)...we were asked how much do we want to cry (spice level). We didn't cry that much. And for family style entrees to share around the table, we ordered the Red Curry (chicken), the garlic pepper stir fry (pork), and the drunken noodles (beef). All had a nice amount of spice and really good flavor.

The delivered food has been just as tasty as the items I've had in the restaurant.  And the food keeps really well.  Right now, I'm having some of the basil fried rice and grilled octopus salad for breakfast from the night before. :)

They may be running out of proper to go containers because occasionally I get rice in a strange container (making me think upon first inspection that they forgot the rice) or the liquidy curry in a standard foam hinged carryout wrapped in a plastic bag. They usually pack it in a soup container. But it's all good because the delivery folks are pretty careful with it.  More careful than I would be.

The salad not often really high on any salad dish but this one for sure so hearty and full of flavors I could do salad every day in life. They use organic mixed greens (not common head lettuce or romaine or bland salad greens), the dressing is divine (If could steal that salad dressing; sign me up!), the tiger shrimp cooked perfection not dried out moist with nice grilled marks, the MANGO for me that the star of the dish so FRESH (Mango in most restaurants over ripe or under ripe) could eat Mango by itself, and combine everything together toss it together salad ecstasy. Truly appreciate about this salad it many components it has every EVERY part be like plate of Mango, plate of shrimp, etc. Amazing! I could get plate of each. The chicken panang was excellent too! I enjoyed everything but not only the sauce has nice depth too it besides nice little kick. The vegetables in it. Green beans nice fresh, and bell peppers nice crunch or al dente bite too them. Tien great recommendations on both dishes! So many more dishes without doubt be coming back for more.

The spice level at Pan Asian no joke. I have been too my share of thai restaurants there times that each place spice level never know what too expect if its truly 6 or above. Not that I mind because I enjoy spicy food. It nice change knowing that if want get some heat get it. I had the 3 on the grilled shrimp mango salad. The owner warned me not go above 3 or 4.

This dish is one of the best looking (and tasting) bowls of noodles I've ever experienced. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the dish is wok seared in a light soy-sauce with spice level dialed to request. The veggies are bright and fresh: red/green bell peppers, white onions, sliced tomatoes and asparagus. This is THE dish to crave, and Chef Lisa describes it as her 'favorite' as well. First-timers are making a big mistake not ordering this one. 

The woks are perfectly seasoned at Pan Asian. No weird aftertastes from cheap sesame oil or five-spice here. This is something to take note of anytime there is a wok involved.

The menu is an interesting mix of various Asian foods, from Thai dishes like pad see ew to the Singapore specialty of Hainanese chicken rice.  We had the crying tiger salad, the special of duck with red curry, the volcano chicken and the glass noodles.  The salad was probably the best salad I have ever eaten.  It was fresh, a little spicy, had some texture to it and the beef was delicious.  The duck was excellent as well.  No gaminess or greasy duck texture, crispy skin and tender inside, with an interesting red curry with grapes, pineapple, cashews, and peppers.  The volcano chicken was similar to an orange chicken, but not as sweet and cheap like you are given in most ""Chinese"" restaurants that serve that **** for American tastes.  It reminded me of Dumpling Inn in San Diego and their orange chicken.  Good hunks of white meat, and good flavor.  The noodles were also tasty.  Several shrimp, with a good mix of veggies.  For dessert, we had the tempura cheesecake, which is just as it sounds.  A hunk of ice cream with whipped cream and a tempuraed piece of cheesecake.  Decadent and delicious.  

Overall, a superb addition to the rotation and a great meal.  The gentleman who served us (the owner?) was awesome.  Super friendly and hilarious sense of humor.  The décor was also nice and the inviting.  One of the best restaurants I have found in a long while and we will be back...soon.  For 3 entrees, the salad and 1 dessert, plus a thai tea, it was $68 including tax.  The duck special was the priciest item at $22, otherwise everything else was around $9-$11.  For two of us, we could have made do with one less entrée also, and I eat a LOT, so we could easily see coming in around $50 and being very happy for 2.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,0,0,5,bFigxCTlcwvvoCmPWNe10w
2338821,2012-01-25,0,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Holy crap! The other Yelpers aren't kidding when they say this place is great. 

Pan Asian is tucked away in a strip mall and it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. But it's definitely worth seeking out! The owner wasn't the friendliest which usually stands out in my mind, but the food was so amazing that I quickly forgave and forgot.

The restaurant itself is very small with limited seating and has a sort of ""fast food"" feel to it (maybe like a step or two up from the atmosphere of a Subway restaurant.) Although, I believe they do offer waiter-service if you choose to eat inside. It's also very clean and the kitchen is wide open, which I thought was neat. Overall, it's a perfect lunch-spot but certainly not somewhere you'd take a date.

I ordered my food to-go and went off the menu that's posted on the wall. I ordered the fried calamari, the stir-fried linguine and the crying tiger salad. 

The calamari was very bland and the dipping sauce didn't help it out much at all. But the linguine and the salad made up for it with flying colors! 

I ordered the linguine at a spicy-level of 8 which is perfect for me at every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas because I loooove spicy, but Pan Asian does not mess around. An 8 set my mouth on fire, but the dish was still so freaking delicious that I ate it anyway, gulping water in between each bite. I will definitely order it again but probably at a spicy level of 5 or 6 next time.

I ordered the crying tiger salad for my husband (at a spicy level of 3) but it seriously had to be the best salad I've ever had because I couldn't stop stealing bites from him. I don't know how they made the dressing but it's incredible. I truly believe that even people who aren't huge fans of salad (like me) would love this. It's just drenched in flavor. That's the best I can describe it.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in the area. Two thumbs up for Pan Asian!",FycUYNTz4fswU8PE62Ybtg,3,2,5,x_yxfg11S3QNUAQtNsCFdQ

It wasn't the Tom Yum Goong I was used to. The shrimp mango salad tasted fishy. I wasn't sure if they put too much fish sauce or if it was from the shrimp.

For my most recent visit. I went with their $5.95 pho. I ordered a spice level 5 which turned out to be too spicy. Call me a wimp but I couldn't finish the broth because it was too spicy. I enjoy a little kick but not too much to the point where it's painful to enjoy and eat. That's why I ordered a spice level in the middle. Their Thai version of pho was not my thing either. I'll just stick with traditional pho. Note, the $5.95 bowl is kid size. You'll probably be hungry after.

The lunch specials does not include soup, egg roll, and a fried wonton like the other Thai restaurants so that's another negative for me. Service was slow the first two times and OK the last visit.

I'm no fool, but that is a great deal!  My hubby and I dined here for lunch on Saturday, March 3rd.  Since we were the only ones dining at the restaurant at the time, we had the choice of sitting where we wanted to which was nice.  This place has a real mom and pop shop type of feel to it. The gentleman who waited on us (I think he may have been one of the owners) was really friendly and helpful.  My hubby and I ordered their Chicken Satay, Garlic Pepper chicken and their Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad and hot tea. 

CHICKEN SATAY:  I loved how they used white meat chicken for this.  It was moist, juicy and flavorful.  The peanut sauce tasted fresh and was delicious.  The best peanut sauce ever!  The cucumber relish was also very fresh and complimented this dish very nicely.

GRILLED TIGER SHRIMP MANGO SALAD:  OMG!  A MUST ORDER!!!!  This was probably one of the best Thai style salads I have ever had.  It has baby greens, cashew nuts, mango, red onions, sweet peppers, Asian herbs and chili lime dressing. I loved how it combined the sweetness of the mango, with the spicy, tanginess  of the dressing.  Definitely a flavor match made in heaven.  According to our server, their dressing is homemade.  DAMN!  I wish I could take a bottle of it home!  A warning though, we ordered a spice level of 3 for the salad and the heat sneaks up on you!!  LOL!  Though my tongue was on fire, I could not stop eating it as it was that GOOD!

CHICKEN IN GARLIC PEPPER SAUCE:  Another winner.  If you love garlic, then this is definitely a dish for you!  Full of flavor and just plain yum!  Again, I loved how they use white meat chicken in this dish.  

HOT TEA:  Very good.  It has a unique, floral taste to it.

My Favorites?...The Yellow Curry and Drunken Nooodles...

The staff is incredible.  Ultra friendly and so helpful!  The kitchen is open to the view of all...thumbs up!

Wherever  the cook came from, she is a GOD. All the orders are made FRESH to order, you can see her make all the food from scratch, and uses only the freshest ingredients. I had the Tiger Shrimp Mango salad and I have never been more in love with a salad EVER. The pineapple fried rice was also super mega delicious. Good thing is that everything is perfectly proportioned, so you won't end up with an entree that only has a two pieces of meat or whatever. They definitely don't take a cheap shortcut.

Restaurant is obviously new and very clean, the kitchen is balling and huge (the kitchen itself is bigger than the dining area). Menu is very clean and easy to read. Prices are a bit high but reasonable since they use fresh ingredients, cooked to order, and just taste damn good. You do get what you pay for, and every penny is worth it here!

Pan Asian where have you been all my life, I would totally ask the cook to adopt me so I can eat her cooking everyday. This place is a MUST try. I will definitely be back here many, many times.

If you come at night, the ambience is glaringly lit with fluorescents. This is a typical hole-in-the-wall asian eatery, lacking decor and using paper menus. 

Service is a bit overly attentive and with a smile, and it's not to their discredit but I don't think they understood anything we said. We received the wrong check, but got our water refreshed every 3 minutes, which was necessary with how FRICKIN HOT their food is. 

I ordered the Beef Rice Noodle ""Pho"" bowl ($8), and my boyfriend got the Massaman curry ($10). When asked if we wanted it hot (which we can usually handle in restaurants that practice humanitarianism) we said ""medium,"" thinking we'd get something palatably spicy but not ""hot."" 

I couldn't physically eat my meal, as it was laced with so much chili oil that my throat literally felt like it was bleeding and my lips were swelling up. My boyfriend went through multiple napkins for nose-blowing, excused himself for the restroom, and continued blowing his nose. I drank at least 2 liters of ice water during my meal. We swapped meals halfway through to diversify the flavor-pain experience. 

For the good of your clientele, if a Caucasian person asks for ""medium,"" just nod and give them ""mild."" Or explain the impending doom that's about to occur. Anything, please. Please god. 

Why three stars? I could tell that underneath all the chili oil that the food was actually very tasty. In the moments where I wasn't thinking about running into traffic, the meal was actually very enjoyable.

Used to order lunch WITH my Physical Therapy office. These were Pre-Yelp days for me. Apparently, barring spice level (a hard 8 is how I roll) my favorite dish: Massaman Curry with Soft Tofu is Misti's favorite dish and owner David was sure I was some under cover Yelper (when I'd never heard of Yelp!) It made for funny exchanges for a long time. David is quite a congenial character and cares about his business. 

Definitive of  a Mom and Pop spot in every way; with a  small open kitchen where David's wife Lisa cooks up a storm. The fantastic aromas that fill the air are intoxicating. The owners are very friendly, passionate and if you've been to Thailand, Lisa loves to discuss regional food and travel. Luckily that led them to trust pale moi when I order a True Thai 8 level spice; many places take a gander at me and knock the spice level down. Not here! 

The food is made with the same love that goes into running such a business, most of the time, David is your server. Small, no ambiance really. But Oh. That. Food. Three people can share a small feast for $10 or under if you eat family style. Since my bros would not TOUCH spice level 8 = I had enough take away for two more meals. Now that's delicious, nutritious and value packed eating! The Green Papaya Salad, Crying Tiger Salad, Drunken Noodles, Basil Rice are all standout dishes as well. Lisa will prepare any dish according to dietary restrictions/preferences. 

It is on Durango in a non descript Strip Mall, near the now closed (again) Carmine's. Very easy to pass. Between Sahara and Desert Inn, the sign says ""David Wong's Pan Asian"" and faces the car park NOT Durango. I got lost going: but always get lost and was working on a three day insomnia hell. Just look out for it, and by all means: GO! You will not be sorry. Great to see such a true family business thrive: very Yelpy.

2621890,2011-05-15,8,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Ding ding ding, we have a winner folks!  First of all, thanks to Misti and the crew for finding yet another gem.  This place advertises itself as an Asian fusion restaurant, but at its core it is a gourmet, mostly authentic Thai restaurant.  And you know how I love Thai food...  We ordered the Massaman Curry with beef, the Rad Nah with pork, and the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli.  After eating these, I am convinced that this is one of the top three Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, maybe top two!  (UPDATE: This is THE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas currently).

The Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli were quite interesting as an appetizer.  The presentation was very gourmet and beautiful.  The ravioli noodles were soft and sticky, wrapped in a shrimp that's cooked in interesting spices.  The flavor was perfect with a little bit of red chili sauce on it (I skipped the soy sauce that came with it).  Not Thai, I know, but definitely yummy.

I am not really a fan of Massaman because it tends to be sweet, but with all of the talk about it here, I thought I would try it.  This version was sweet, as it is supposed to be, but it also had a ridiculously intriguing and complex flavor!  There was a definite peanut flavor, but also another flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  The chef makes her own curries, so I attribute this complex flavor to the homemade curry sauce.  I probably would order this with less sweetness next time, but this dish was amazing.  It came with big potato slices, carrots cooked to perfection, bell peppers, and beef chunks that were nicely prepared.  

The Rad Nah here is extremely good, and won me over.  This is probably tied for the second best Rad Nah I have had!  The cook said that it was one of her favorite dishes, and so she takes a lot of pride in her recipe.  This dish smelled absolutely amazing.  Smokey, lightly sweet aromas.  The taste was just as good.  The pork was nice and juicy, and the Chinese broccoli was fresh and crunchy.  The sauce was slightly more rich than the other two great Rad Nah recipes I have had, which gave it its own character.  Not a lot of places can make a great Rad Nah, and Pan Asian makes one of the best I have had.  Great job, Pan Asian.

I am so glad to have this restaurant available in Las Vegas.  I will have to take some breaks from my usual spots to explore their menu some more.  The Thai food is mostly authentic, but they do have to Americanize certain dishes a little bit.  So, if you want the real deal, just order it ""Thai style"".  We rattled off a few exotic dishes that we like, and the chef said that some of them she can cook very well (very spicy Pa Cha).  I can't wait to go back!

Edit: I've been back a number of times and have loved every dish I have had (roast duck, red snapper).  One dish really stood out yesterday though, the red curry.  I had it with beef, spicy level 10, and it came with fresh peppers and pieces of pumpkin!  It wasn't as sweet as the other curries, so you non-sweet curry lovers will enjoy this one!  The sauce is homemade, and full of fresh flavors.  I believe that it may be the best red curry I have ever had.  Dave said that this is how the royal family eats red curry.  I don't know about royalty, but if this dish isn't fit for it than I don't know what is!

Second Edit: recommended dishes for Thai food lovers, may not be on the menu: the Red Curry dishes (served with fresh pumpkin!), Pa Cha with tilapia, Red Snapper, Duck curry, fried banana.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,19,11,5,Pk6k40SvZ5XCW-8ZrUO8Iw

Unfortunately, we moved much further South and wasn't as nearby anymore. On Valentines Day, after a morning filled with Pokémon Leagues & Gymnastics, we ended up here with our 2 crazy kids around 2PM. It was surprisingly full considering the time and our server seated us very promptly. We went kind of crazy on the ordering considered there were only 2 adults & 2 children (8 & 4) but we definitely left extremely stuffed.

We started with the Malaysian Roti with curry & crunchy shrimp spring rolls (per the request of my son). The Malaysian Roti was great! Puffy, fried roti with a wonderful curry that had just the right amount of seasoning. We will certainly order this again. The spring rolls were typical egg rolls IMO served with lettuce & sweet & spicy sauce. Onto the entrees! We got: drunken noodles, panang curry, crying tiger salad, & basil fried rice that had shrimp & chicken. Everything was excellent. My favorite was probably the crying tiger salad with its tender fall apart beef. I think what makes this place stand out is that they cook their proteins PERFECTLY. Barely anything has to be chewed because they all fall apart in your mouth. I wish their panang was slightly thicker, but the flavors were excellent anyway. Their basil fried rice had a bunch of basil leaves in it (my favorite herb) and made me happy. Drunken noodles had plenty of veggies which is just the way I like it. 

For dessert - fried cheesecake & mango sticky rice. Both were typical but still delicious. Overall, come try this hole in the wall Thai restaurant. You won't be disappointed with its cozy interior and family run service.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,2,1,4,SRU2Tu_1-ResJ71DSQ0BTA

How is it possible that every single dish we ordered tonight was an awful and tasteless disaster! They must of hired a new chef. That's the only explanation for this. Pan Asian, how do you go from having a near perfect review on yelp and start to slip this drastically? Everything was beyond unacceptable. You have been checked off on my list of the worst thai food I have ever had in my life.

First offense: The chicken pad thai was an unnatural pink? The chicken looked like dried overcooked salmon - it was pink! The noodles were beyond over cooked to the point where they were hard, all stuck together in blocks and then broke up into a million of little pieces when you would try to pick them up. There was no sauce at all, not even soaked into the pad thai noodles. It was so dry! So crazy dry. There was no flavor at all - not even a hint of fish sauce, sweetness, sourness, or anything! 

Second offense: The pad see ew with beef noodles were also stuck together like bricks, dried out and hard. Also, why did the only flavor we taste was oil and extra black pepper? Did they run out of oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce, sugar, fish sauce, all of the traditional ingredients that go into this dish? I could not handle eating oil flavored noodles with extreme black pepper. Into the trash it goes. 

Third offense: The green curry with beef had the consistency of tom yum soup. I don't understand how they can make a curry so watery! I did not taste any of the deep flavors you would typically find in curry, (no lemongrass, no richness, no sweetness) except for spicy. Spicy water would best explain this dish. To add insult to injury, they offered us a minimal amount of chewy beef pieces and loaded up on undercooked and hard vegetables. Cutting costs much?

What upsets me the most, was that the owner David Wong was there and he allowed these dishes to be served to us. That was his stamp of negligence. There is no quality or control here. 

We ate 4 bites and could not get past how incredibly shoddy all of these dishes were prepared. I'm seriously upset that we spent$40 on all of this dried out, bland food. The joke is on us.

We looked at a picture of the menu and decided on the Chicken Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and the Green Curry w/ Shrimp.  We placed our order over the phone as we wanted to utilize takeout and enjoy the meal from home.  I'm not sure if this altered the quality of the meal, but I think it has to.  I've NEVER had good Pad Thai takeout and this experience was no different.  Upon my arrival at home (10 minute drive), I opened the Pad Thai and it had a gelatinous casing like it was last night's Pad Thai.  I would have taken a picture but I don't think Takeout orders do justice for any establishment.  The Green Curry was OK, but they must be on the metric system w/ a high multiple as we ordered each dish w/ a ""2"" spice level.  They must have thought I said 20 because I was sweating after four bites of Pad Thai and a spoonful of Curry.  

The Pineapple Fried Rice was the standout (in a good way) as the sweetness of the raisins and pineapple went well w/ the rice and the overall cook on the rice was on point.  

The Green Curry was too spicy and overall was just OK.  I'm not sure if I would come back or not.",NppW9SFDMKioUAx_87QQhw,0,0,2,WZS4pALC9x4sUztIor3p1g

Me and the wifey wanted to try this place out finally after driving by it so many times. The one time I actually stopped by to try them was when they went on vacation for almost 2 months. I guess everybody deserves some time off especially if you have your own restaurant. 

After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The wifey was not all that hungry so she went with the Spicy Tom Yum Soup. Now back to my very first statement. Our server asked us how spicy we wanted the soup. He said choose from 1 to 3. Now from what I remember skimming on some of the reviews, their spiciness is hotter than the norm. So when my wife wanted 3 I politely interrupted her and said to go for a 1. Im glad we did because after tasting the soup, (which was awesome btw) my lips were burning. Combine that with the Chicken in Garlic sauce, wow! That in itself was spicy. Im glad my dish came with a bowl of white steamed rice because if it didn't, I would literally have steam coming from my head!

Now im assuming not all they have on their menu is burn a hole in your stomach spicy but once I was done with my meal, my clothes were all soggy with sweat, like I just came from the gym. Now if I can actually lose weight while eating here, then I am set! Who said multi tasking was hard?

As for service, we got our order pretty quick. But then again there were only two other tables being served. So next time the real test is when they are packed. Which means more trips to try other awesome food on their menu!

The only thing I thought that stuck out were the prices. We only ordered two items, but with tax and tip it was about 21 bucks. I think that's why lunch time is a hit here with the lunch specials.  Im kind of glad it was spicy because I probably would have ordered more food. Needless to say, we left satisfied.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,8,8,4,VgNAcV5iJBtiIifzMPX8ZQ

We love any kind of Asian food and are pleased to have a new place to go close to the house. When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car there and we were not sure they were open, even though the sign said they were. We tried the door and were greeted my David( the owner) with a warm hello. He welcomed us and told us about how he came here from Naples Florida and just opened a month ago. He assured us we would love our meal and he was right. He made a couple of suggestion and we settled on starting with the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli. We watched Lisa, David's wife and a wonderful chef, prepare the appetizer from our table. It is nice to see an open kitchen where you can watch everything being freshly made. For dinner I had the Red Nah noodles and my wife had the Massaman Curry. Both were outstanding, although I have to take my wife's word on the curry since I don't enjoy curry. The portions were good size and we even had a little left to take home. My only trepidation about writing this review is that Pan Asian is a small restaurant with only about 14 seats and I don't want to always have to wait in line for my new favorite local place.

Singapore noodles (tasty) 

All of the food is excellent except I would not order the spring rolls again. I think for around $7.95 for 4 small spring rolls it is not worth it. They are not any better than most Chinese restaurants that give them for free.

Entrees - fresh and plentiful. Flavor - perfect. 

My entree - Filet Mignon Pho Soup (with medium spice). Comforting with a nice kick. While my soup was cooling off, I took the meat out and cut it into smaller pieces (just a personal preference). 

I also ordered a Thai Coffee since it was a brunchy lunch for the hubby and I. Sweeter than I expected (which is not what I normally prefer) but offered balance to my somewhat spicy soup. It turned out to be a nice treat :)

Hub and I split the Pineapple Fried Rice (mild) with chicken & shrimp, which were the right texture, flavor and size. 

His entree - Drunken Noodles - medium - with added chicken. Large portion with nice flavor & texture. I ate some of the veggies. Fresh and not over-cooked. 

We wanted to give the Thai Donuts a try since it added to the brunchy feel.

Small place that is run by super nice folks!
I went as part of a huge group.... NOTE... not really a place that can do huge groups (12+) but they pulled it off.

Food:

Massaman Curry...Wow! I'm not a curry fan.... but this one.... Yea Baby! Would never think that Avocado would go in a curry... but it was Great!

Pad See Ew... Could have continued eating this even after I exploded.... So Good! 

Papaya Salad.... I tried my friend's dish... I have no idea what number of hot she ordered... but this had a nice kick.  It was cool and fresh and then BAM the spice sneaks up on you... but I went back for a couple more bites.  

Hotness Rating:

I like a bit of spice/heat... but not too much... I actually like to taste the food I'm eating and not just hot spice.  So our Massaman Curry and Pad See Ew dishes were 1.... but I would have preferred to bump it up a step to 2.... but not too much more than that.... for me anyways.

They scale their dishes 1 to 10.
My other friend ordered a 3 on a veggie stir fry dish... and she was visibly sweating and she was LOVING the food. I don't know if she sweats easy... but she really enjoyed it and said it was ""hot"" but that it was perfect... so my guess is their 3 is more like a 5 or 6 other places.  So, I can only assume that their 10 is off the charts.

As I went over the menu, I couldn't help but hear the table of 6 across from me talk about this place and ""their spice level"". One guy said how he won't go over a level 5. 
If you know me, and spicy, I was instantly intrigued! I ordered some pot stickers (some of the best I have ever had) and the order of garlic and black pepper chicken, level 8. The boss/server guy looked at me and said ""here, level 8 is very spicy, not like other Thai"" I simply looked back, smiled, and said ""GOOD.""
When my plate arrived I could see the spicy. I started to get a bit nervous but then brushed it off. I was there alone, and I just told the boss I can handle it, can't wimp out now! 
It was perfection! Yes I may have ordered a 2nd Thai iced tea, and my eyes may have been a bit watery at times. But did I finish it? YES. Will I order it again? HELL YES.

When we came in, the place only had one server. There were mostly people phone ordered and picked up. We thought hmm... We tried many different variety of food but none of them satisfied us. We didn't even see the famous chefs, only other employees making the food.

I came he with my usual lunch crowd (we all work together) thus right off the bat we asked for separate checks and was told no problem. The special was volcano chicken so three of us ordered that and one ordered the yellow curry and the last ordered Chicken Pad Thai. Well the Volcano chicken was atrocious, it was sooooo overcooked I couldn't taste any chicken, I swear when I say it tasted like glazed pork rinds. My jaw hurt from crunching so much. Everyone that got the Volcano Chicken had the same issue. My friends Pad Thai came out pink?? And smelled and tasted like fish.. he took two bites and pushed it aside. When the check came they forgot to give us separate checks and a overcharge and refund later we finally got out of there.

Not sure if there was a new cook or the what, but this is one place that will not get a second chance from me, and I love Asian food.",M6uDHCxhZybBdngFuBmrHg,6,2,1,QvJEchdG7pwri37qpViAZA
3195293,2014-02-23,0,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Been here twice so far.

First visit:
Came here for dinner and ordered the duck curry on a yelper's recommendation. Absolutely love the duck curry. To quote another yelper, ""The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy."" This is one dish that I tried on that yelper's recommendation and it was superb. LOVE IT! Just be careful with regards to the spice level. If you can't take spicy, go mild. I think I had mine at level 6 or 7 and it was somewhat burning my mouth. And I generally have my food spicy. So you've been warned.

Ps. The duck curry is not on their menu. You have to ask for this dish specifically. Remember to check with the staff on the price. I remember I was a little shocked when I saw the bill.

Second visit:
Decide to come here and try out their lunch specials. Ordered the beef noodle soup (pho) and omg, bad decision. As we know, the broth is the backbone of any kind of noodle soup and my beef noodle soup was literally drowned in salt. I could feel the sodium kicking into my system and it did not go well with me at all. Other than the sodium laden broth, I honestly cannot remember anything else about my dish. My friends who ordered other dishes (I can't recall what their orders were now) were also complaining about their food, although i can't quite remember what their complaints were. Overall, none of us enjoyed our lunch experience that afternoon. 

Service was good, and that's probably why I gave this place a 3-star. After my second visit, I think I am just going to have to stick to only my duck curry from now on. That is how traumatized I've become after having that beef noodle soup.",LMJKMZOEiQpWNMBT2G2t_A,0,0,3,HNnJUlJBBJDHQ21Oo0b2sg

Food was delivered within 25 minutes of ordering which is not bad considering cooking time and a little over 2 miles away for delivery.  I expected such quality.  I can't assume a 4.5 star standing rating was only for dining in.  But because of the following, I'm really happy with:
- they have pumpkin curry
- rice is included with the dish ordered
- food is delicious
- they're close by
- pricing is comparable in average to local Thai 
- they have Yelp Eat 24 DELIVERY which arrived with edible hot delicious food

How good was it still?  The fried noodle stuffed egg rolls were crispy.  That's how good.  Pumpkin curry so yum.  I think I can handle medium spice next time.  The rice however had some hard pieces - the kind that stuck to my molars.

Let me start with the positive.  Service was very personal and very attentive.  Prices were very reasonable.  

The food was mediocre at best.  

Chicken Satay was not very flavorful.  The peanut sauce looked like it came from a bottle.

The Ravioli app was okay.  The wrap was good and the presentation was great, but the filling was over-processed and flavorless.

The Duck Curry was good.  The curry was a bit runny.  

The ribs were probably the best thing we ordered.  The XO sauce was really good but I felt that the ribs were overcooked.  

The beef salad was really bad.  Poor slices of beef...some cut with the grain and tough to chew.  The salad looked like the regular spring mix that you pick up at the market.  

The basil fried rice was especially bad.  This is a dish we get at all Thai restaurants and the entree we use to compare restaurants.  Theirs is heavy on the soy sauce and not very deep with flavors.

3254960,2013-10-27,1,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"This about the 4th time I have been here and their food is still consistently good. 

Always have their tiger shrimp mango salad and the crispy duck curry. The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy. Its such a great dish. Although, really watch out their spicy level. When they ask you your spicy level, keep in mind they are thai standard spicy, not amrrican standard. Go level 3 if you want mild to medium, I had the level 5 and its burning me inside out. But i am still swallowing more food with my sweat. And the mango salad is a slightly cooked salad, which I love.

I would say avoid their tom yum soup, they are alright and serve in bowls then pot. And tried their pork rib, they are favourable but too meaty for me. 

Overall it is a very good thai place out in the desert and even better than those in town. It is out off the strip but really worth going and to be away from the crowds and lines.",hQ87ZnXIhsF_B3ygXdQslw,4,2,5,kAusUl4OheyAZ9_GiIM0HQ

If you're looking for a spicy dish that is well made, come to Pan Asian. Usually at Asian restaurants when you ask for extra spice they just throw more peppers on the dish. Here they actually prepare the spicy level and cook with it so the entire dish has a nice level of heat. I ordered an 8 for chicken pad see ew and a 5 on the massaman curry. If you can handle heat, then 8 is just a nice buzz of spice; 5 isn't much.   It won't make you sweat but your mouth does have a nice paralysis after eating. Stomach will be fine but you'll know you just had a spicy meal. 

The curry was just ok but the pad see ew was excellent and actually a bigger portion than I anticipated.  The entire meal came to about $22 which is about average, maybe a few dollars too much. But based on location And the spice, I am very happy I came by and tried Pan Asian. I will be back for pickups in the future.

The negative aspect of this restaurant and my only complaint was the lighting and lack of privacy. Yes, the place is small so you have to sit relatively close to other customers which may be avoidable by dividers but not that big of a deal. However, something more pressing was the lighting. The kitchen is lit by big fluorescent lighting which takes away from the nice quint feeling a lot of Thai restaurants are offering. An easy fix but nevertheless an overlooked necessity here.

I've never had a single dish that was disappointing, and I love their Roti which I haven't been able to find anywhere else in the US.

I ordered Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp to share with my boyfriend while my brother orders Basil... rice? Or something like that! We also ordered Calamari and a bowl of rice on the side because initially David told us that the Pad Thai came with rice but then he told us it actually did not, so we ordered rice to sort of absorb all the oils from the noodles. Everything, to me, seemed to be in large portions so it's a good thing I shared my Pad Thai because I still couldn't even finish my half! David gladly boxed the rest of my food up for me.

Overall, the food was great! (Although the Calamari did taste a little plain) Everything was delicious and also presented very nicely. The service was exactly how it should be AND bonus points for not even batting an eyelash at my service dog with me!-- right now, they have cute simple Halloween decorations in their restaurant and the staff in the kitchen seem to be in a very good mood :) the whole experience was so good that you can count on me coming back here!",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,8,5,5,R5IOsXoIHwG5vv-x8CtIsw

The duck curry is a particular favorite, it is one of the best dishes I've had anywhere. Appetizer wise, the Malaysian roti is amazing and the calamari was great as well. 

Service was outstanding every single time. The owner (David) is a super friendly guy. We enjoyed talking with him a lot. Just great folks here overall really.  And keep in mind, when they say spicy, its freaking spicy.  Its not like some places where you can order a top level spiciness and skate buy, they don't play around here (to quote David).

I wanted to love the fried Basil Rice but it was just shy of fabulous! It was hardy with a combo of chicken, shrimp and beef.  There were a lot of veggies too.  It was decent but not fab.

The green curry was typical.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Again, I wanted to love it but it was pretty standard and was lacking some variation of veggies.  The dish did have healthy helpings of al dente green beans and a few red peppers but it was a little flat.  Thank goodness for the spice #5 to kick it up a notch.

The interesting winner of the evening was the RED CURRY dish.  My husband and I agreed that it was the best of the three.  It had unique ingredients.  Eggplant, Pumpkin, Green Beans, Tomatoes etc. it did have more going on but it was more flavorful too.  

Then on to Mango Sticky Rice! MY FAV! Blissfull sounds of joy in every bite! MY only complaint was the creme fresh that was laddled on top was pegged with SALT!? It was so overpowering that we scrapped it off the top and continued with our food-gazims.  

This place is not horrible but it wasn't spectacular! I really want it to be so I am going back to try some more menu items.  I think it's a very interesting concept to mesh all these types of asian cusines into singular dishes but sometimes you just want A-typical Thai or Singaporian food and this you won't find here.  It's a melting pot for all Asian types of cusine.  Once you can wrap your head around that idea then you'll appreciate it for what it is...

Was a shame as had decent ratings but was last there 6 mos ago. 

Tip would be to not try to put too much on the menu and focus on what food is your talent. Specialising in such a broad array of Asian food is signing yourself up for trouble. You will have better success narrowing down menu with your strengths and not throw items on you believe will be a draw for people when in fact it detracts.",XrRLaAeV20MRwdSIGjj2SQ,2,1,2,jnIEW_xWjQKrPE_D2EZbeA

I mean it, it is soooo good. I know she uses it in the Thai mango salad too. It tastes like regular basil, no worries that it would be weird, but WOW.

Weird, a vegetarian (95%, I went to Seattle and haven't been able to go cold turkey on fish since) who doesnt like tofu. The roti is so good. I've had roti before, but not like this. The curry sauce accompanying the roti is delicious. I wish I knew better words for delicious. Pan Asian is the place that allowed me to try the curry couscous at DW Bistro. If not for her yellow curry, I would be denying myself something wonderful. I can not say enough good things about this place. It's clean and bright, HUGE plus! The service is great.

The restaurant is quaint with a few tables. Interior is simple and understated. You can see right into the kitchen and see the chef in action. 

My husband and I were greatly warmly by the owner and he made suggestions per our request. The prices were fairly decent. Based on the quick tips on Yelp, we ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli, Crying Tiger Salad, Massaman Curry with chicken and DW Fried Rice. We figured we might as well order a lot so we can have leftovers for later. We devoured all of the food and there wasn't a grain of rice left to take home.

I loved all of the food but the Crying Tiger Salad pulled at my heart strings. The flavors were so distinctive and strong and I have never tasted a salad like it before. I always order Massaman Curry from Thai places; Pan Asian raised the bar for me. The curry had the right amount of sweetness and heat. It came with avocado and sweet potatoes, which I've never seen before in other restaurants, and they were cooked to perfection.

The chef came by our table to check if we enjoyed our meal. She was so sweet and we couldn't sing her praises enough.

Tom Kha Chicken Soup-not quite the flavor I was expecting.  Or, not quite as flavorful as I was hoping.  It was just limey.  Had better.

The service was prompt and friendly enough, with the chef coming and asking us if we were okay with the spice level a couple of times. Several times people came in and were known by name, always a nice touch for the regulars. If this place was closer to me, I'm sure I'd have been here many times by now.

Basil Fried Rice easily the best fried rice I've had since moving to Vegas it wasn't dry and it was full of flavor spice level 4. Pad Thai was delicious we ordered a 4 but ended up adding additional chili powder and hot sauce. We should've ordered a 6 or a 7 but once again the flavors were oh soo good.

Tried but didn't love it- Tom Yum soup spice level of 2, this could be just me but something was very bland about this dish compared to my local joint.

Pan Asian competes with ""Archie's"" Thai restaurant which is about a mile away.  Pan Asian's Pad Thai, is much tastier than Archies, being sweet, spicy, and savory.  However Archies curry has a far greater depth of flavor than Pan Asian.  

The one thing that sets Pan Asian apart is the feeling of personal service.  You can feel that they care about you as a customer and work hard for your repeat business, making you want to support this local restaurant.  

Due to the low volume of business that I have observed, I would be surprised if this restaurant survives.  However, do yourself a favor and visit the restaurant.  The menu spans Thai with a flare of Viet Nam.  Ask the owner for his recommendation, you might be introduced to a foodie treat that you've never experienced.",HEtJsyLYSkxOQiH0GUOuTQ,0,0,4,t6afoSpracl8v2SMuzbqpA

They make everything fresh and there is only one cook in the kitchen, so my only complaint is that the food can take a little long to come out, but it is well worth it.

The red curry has eggplant and pumpkin in it!  I was surprised at the ingredients since I'm so used to just bell pepper and bamboo in my red curry, but the owner told me that's how the royals eat it and he didn't want to put that ""cheap stuff"" in there.  I may have a hard time eating red curry anywhere else now!  The pumpkin is so good and unexpected in it.  

I've also tried their linguine dish, which was flavorful and tasty.  It really reminded me of Pad Kea Mow at Archi's Thai.  Their pho was ok, but I am so partial to Pho So 1, that it's tough to impress me with pho.

This place must be a best kept secret because it has been in business since 2011 and this is the first my wife and I have heard about it. Fortunately, someone recommended this business to us for good Thai food and we were not disappointed. The Basil Fried Rice ($10.95) came highly recommended as well. The recommendation was on point. The basil added a really nice flavor profile to what is typically a plebeian entree in most venues. Also, I ordered an appetizer of Malaysian Roti ($6.95). Let me start by stating that I had no idea what Malaysian Roti was. I sometimes like to roll the dice by ordering a dish or entree ""in the blind"" so to speak. It goes without saying that this can go one of two ways, but hey, this is Vegas baby. I was surprised in a good way. It came with what I would describe as flat, sweet pastries with a small side dish of yellow curry, potato and basil. I could have consumed a bowl of the yellow curry that came with this appetizer. This was more like dessert to me and I probably would not order this again. However, I am definitely going to focus on one of their yellow curry dishes on my next visit. My wife and I shared two entrees. I ordered a stir fry of Cashew Nuts with Pork ($9.95) and she ordered a special of Pan Sear Salmon with Mango Sauce ($21.95). We were informed upon ordering that their food comes very spicy/hot. So that a 4 or 5 elsewhere is typically a 2 or 3 here. Believe it. Where I might go a 4 somewhere else I would not go higher than a 2 here. Both dishes were very good.

The curry was also bland and spicy. I like spicy food, don't get me wrong but spicy bland? Ewwww. The curry was also watery like as if it has been watered down. Isn't Panang curry supposed to be thick and rich? This is definitely the worst curry I have ever tasted.

Although they don't quite have the selection as Lotus of Siam, they have all the classics. My personal favorite is the stir-fried linguini, which comes with your choice of meat, asparagus, tomatoes, and a spicy kick (there's no mild version). Other favorites like pad thai and pad see-yew are just as good. I love that the noodles are actually cooked to perfection instead of the typical half-assed versions that stick together at some other Thai joints. I also really enjoyed the DW fried rice if you're not feeling any of the noodle dishes. Their level of spiciness rates on a scale of 1-10 so if you're a first-timer, I highly recommend starting low (even a 3 is a bit too much for some people).

She made our first visit one that will be followed with many subsequent returns. 

The Beef Pad Thai at a 2 had a kick to it that might as well have been a 4 or 5 at other places, but of course, that's subjective. You might scoff at my weakness for anything spicy; I'm a timid,  quasi-white guy who can't handle a few drops of Tabasco let alone a 5 or 10. However, if you're daring, ask for a 30. YES. A 30! I imagine an inferno could ensue within your stomach causing you to squeal with every bite, therefore if it's your first rodeo, do everyone a favor and don't be that person who wants to impress everyone in the restaurant.

We were down in the area a week ago and Yelped for local eats.  We saw the deal going on ($10 for $20 worth).  I immediately bought the deal knowing that we would have to venture back soon (we decided to try a new restaurant that day).  

We made our way back today and tagged a newbie along.  The place was empty but it was only 5pm on a Sunday.  The owners were great just like the last time.  David even remembered us from our one visit (8 months ago) and my initial review on the place.  *blush*  Anyway, this is what we had:

Crying Tigers (again) - still oh so good
Pad Sew-Yee (or something) with beef/spice level 4 - very good, will probably go up to spice level 6 next time
Malaysian Yellow Curry with chicken/spice level 4 - very good, thought about getting another to go for later cravings (I do live about 25-30 from this glorious place).
Tempura Cheesecake - *sigh* so bad for the body but so good for the mouth!

As you can see my dedication to delightful and unique foods will force me to drive...almost anywhere.  I wish I could visit more often.  And the prices are just right.  An average plate is $7-$9 (I tend to round up when I see $8.95, just so you know).

The food is really good, fresh and a great value for the price. (Enough for dinner and leftovers) However, be very careful about the spice scale, cause it's nuts. My hubby usually gets like an 8 at most places, but he got a 4 here and it was BEYOND spicy. Like, he had to throw it away cause it burned so bad kinda spicy. I got a 1 cause I'm a wuss and it was perfect :)

You know that sensation when you burp up the great flavors of an awesome meal you just had? I enjoyed it all the way on my long drive home from this awesome restaurant.  It was the aftermath of a red curry with beef, which totally blew my mind in spite of my half-full stomach.  The star of the dish was actually the pumpkin, which works great in this sweet and savory environment.  My only regret was asking for a spicy level of 3, which was hot for me. Yes, I'm a wimp, but I had a 3 pad thai just fine at Archi's. This was like twice as bad.

We ordered fried gyoza for my extra picky daughter,red curry with chicken (minus the eggplant-alergic), beef pad sew ew, & Basil Fried rice.

I'm craving the Basil fried rice as I write this review. I loved that dish-The BF and I were just discussing how we love it when a dish is ordered and is seasoned well - so well that we don't have to add a condiment to the dish.
Basil Fried Rice=Yumminess!!!!
The Red curry was ok - the veggies in the curry were not to our liking. The owner guy (I'm guessing) noticed that we didn't eat all our pumpkin. We told him that we prefer potatoes and carrots. He said because they make  every dish fresh we can ask for them to put whatever veggies we want in our curry. I really liked hearing that-very cool!!!!
The Pad See Ew was yummy as usual.
The goyza was standard - I wasn't excited about this but this was all my picky child ate - so it served it's purpose.

we went in and the chef was in a frenzy because she was also the waiter.  I felt a little bad because 10 people came in the space of five minutes so, put her in an awkward spot.  I tried ordering an app the scallop one looked good and she told me she ran out of scallops. I asked if she could substitute it with something else.  I was told it wouldn't be possible because she was too busy between taking orders and cooking.

That seemed reasonable enough.  little disappointed but no fazed.  I ordered the chicken ravioli which is a misnomer because it's straight up chinese dumplings.  they were bland like the other yelpers mentioned. 

I ordered the linguini and red curry.  I asked for the red curry spicy number one.

I got the linguini and it was too spicy.  She took it back and told me ""you should know basil sauce is spicy."" 

no, i didn't know I should know.  

the male owner came by and said the same thing.  I told him he should mark it on the menu as spicy.  then he went on to say that each dish is authentic and they don't cater to americans.  that was the end for me.

but, the food?

the linguini that I had one bite of tasted like pad see ew with al dente pad thai noodles.  I don't get what anyone is praising it over.  I don't think using linguini noodles and keeping the traditional recipe categorize it as fusion.

the red curry was thin.  good flavor though.  i hate thin curry.  

my experience went from mediocre to bad.  I'm not trying to bash the owners but, mediocre thai food plus bad experience is a bad combo.

I rarely turn down a squid dish so I had to try the Fried Calamari. Its lightly breaded, or worded another way, it was very airy and crunchy. I prefer to have the squid more obvious but I understand the aversion many people have to squid so I guess I can understand the prominent breading. The chili dipping sauce tasted great and worked very nicely with the squid/breading.

The Singapore Noodles used very thin noodles, which was the primary ingredient. I ordered this dish because it contained bean sprouts, a food I also like, but there were very few sprouts even though its the first listed ingredient in the dish. The mushrooms, carrots, and bok chop were all very fresh and add body and flavor to the dish. This dish can be ordered with a spice level of 1-to-5, I went with 2, and at that level there was a nice subtle taste of chili spice.

The price was a bit more than I'm used to for picking up some Chinese, but we figured it was for quality and authenticity. 

When we got in, the guy there was SO friendly. It was almost closing time, but he was so enthusiastic about helping us. He even set us up with water while we waited! At this point, I was thinking how this place is shaping up for a 5 star. 

He asked about how spicy we wanted our chicken. I said I wanted mine a little spicy, my girlfriend said not at all. He asked ""0-10?"" And I said...6? He made a shocked face like, no, that's spicy! I remembered the reviews saying this place was spicy, and I said ok ok, 5. I like spicy foods, I eat them frequently, but I don't like to not enjoy eating something cause it burns. I told him ""not TOO spicy"" and he went off to make the food. 

We were impressed because we watched him slice up the fresh veggies for the dish, and everything looked really good. We got home, and my girlfriend tried hers... Delicious! I tried mine... And I thought, huh. This is a 5!?!?

After a few more bites, my mouth was burning. Bad. But whatever, I usually like spicy food, so I figured it was right at the end of my tolerance. I was wrong. After eating some more, my stomach started to bother me, and it messed my stomach up all night. It was SPICY. 

We were very excited to make this our local Chinese place. Although it was more expensive, it appeared to be fresh, the service was friendly, and we liked the atmosphere in the restaurant. However after this experience, I'm going to have to wait awhile before I go back. 

I see other reviews mention this spicy thing. I generally love a place that is brave enough to make their spicy actually spicy. However, if someone is giving you a FIVE out of ten, it shouldn't be so hot it's difficult to eat.

Great little mom n pop restaurant. Husband takes the orders while his wife works her magic in the kitchen. It is a bit of a drive (15 min) from the strip, but well worth the trip if you are in the mood for some Thai food.

4369927,2012-02-01,0,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Eating here was a good experience.  I bought the Yelp Deal: $20 for $10.  I've decided that Groupon mostly sends you to places that are having troubles for a reason.  That is, I'm usually disappointed with the Groupon experiences.  Yelp Deals, on the other hand, have turned out pretty good so far.  This place is a little far from home.  Usually, if I drive this far then I just go on down to Chinatown.  Parking was ok.  Upon entering I turned to my girlfriend and commented about how this was probably going to be a bad experience because the place was totally empty.  It was around 6:45 pm on Tuesday.  But, we settled in determined to give it a fair try.  I began noticing all of the nice things about the place.  It was nicely decorated.  I assume the owner did the decorating.  I describe it as contemporary Asian.  It was not high end Vegas strip decorating style, but more like well put together do it yourself style.  The kitchen was in full view of the dining area.  I always like that.  I cringe to think what goes on out of sight.  So many restaurant shows today let us normal people peek behind the curtain and witness the often disgusting truth.  Also, I was delighted to see Asian people making Asian food.  At least makes me believe I'm in for authentic flavors.  Modern music played lightly over the audio system.  It was pleasant.  I assume the man waiting on us was the owner, David Wong.  He was very friendly and attentive.  He did a really good job.  He tried very hard to give us a great experience.  Every item on the menu was under $11.  That's pretty good.  I like good food, but I enjoy it even better when I feel like I'm getting a good deal.  The menu had a variety of Asian dishes, as the name implies: Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, etc.  We ordered two dishes.  The first was Filet Mignon Pho.  It was a Thai version of Vietnamese Pho.  My Thai girlfriend explained that the abundance of roasted garlic was a signature difference.  The sauces were all added before serving.  The veggies were slightly different (can't explain) and the meat was filet mignon (Wow! Step It Up!).  The noodles were cooked just right.  I enjoyed the Pho, but there are way better places to get Pho in this town.  The second dish was Basil Sauace Stir Fry.  It had chicken, sweet basil, garlic, chili tomatoes, and long beans served with rice.  Spiciness was 8 out of 10.  It was really tasty.  I specifically enjoyed the fresh veggies.  My only complaint was that the dish had too much oil.  I realized just how much after we finished the dish and were left staring at the puddle before us.  It made me feel a little bad about something I had just enjoyed.  We were pretty much full, but wanted to spend at least $20 for the Yelp deal so we ordered another entree.  We had asked the server earlier what their signature dish was.  He recommended the Pad-See-Yaw.  So, that's what we ordered.  It was pan-fried flat noodles with pork, broccoli, black soy beans, and egg.  My girlfriend explained that this dish is commonly ordered by Caucasians at Thai restaurants.  She was surprised that I had never heard of it (we usually eat Thai food at her house, not restaurants).  It was very sweet.  My girlfriend and the server had a quick conversation in Thai.  He asked if we wanted a dessert.  We said no, but I thought the sweet Pad-See-Yaw was dessert.  After he left, my girlfriend explained that she told him it was too sweet and he replied that its how Americans like it.  I thought that was funny.  We were already full when the third dish came out so we tasted it and put it in a to go box.  The server came by and chatted with us for a while.  He explained that he had been open for about nine months.  Before that he had a successful high end Asian restaurant in Florida.  Articles hung on the wall behind us explaining it.  By the time we left it had become pretty busy.  The place had four or five more couples and a few take out customers came through.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The server was attentive and the food came out fast.  The menu was very affordable.  The decorations were interesting and inviting.  I really wanted to give it five starts, but  the food was good, not great.  Its worth a try.",tixImBjX6uTCBDYcg0JvuA,0,0,4,K4cQs0K-t0LgypEmBK4hNA

So far I've tried, Pork fried rice (which isn't on the menu as far as meat wise but David was more than happy to make it), Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Tom yum, Beef rice noodle pho, volcano chicken (house special) and stir fried linguine.  

Pork fried rice - literally the Cadillac of fried rice. Best I've ever had and I love eating fried rice from everywhere.

Pad Thai - heads and shoulders better than most Thai places here in Vegas.  Even better than my beloved Archi's.

Shrimp Tom yum - Spicy but wicked fresh.  Loved it.

Beef Rice noodle pho - This is what changed the game.  I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant that has had more than 1 item that I considered the best I have ever had.  There's not even words to describe how amazing it is. Just try it. Please. Like now.

Volcano chicken - Sweet breaded fried chicken with a hint of spicy.  Flavor was out of this world. 

Stir Fried Linguine - girlfriend got this and she hates linguine.  We figured if there's something that we might not like it would be this. WRONG. It was epic and now has me second guessing why I have never liked linguine.

While fluorescent lighting isn't my preferred ambiance for dinner, the food and David's ceaseless sense of humor far outshone the lighting.  

We brought a started bottle of wine with us, half-full because we didn't want to polish off a whole one, which we knew we could, and would. He promptly brought us wine glasses, and when he noticed us skimming ice out of our water glasses, he brought us a big glass of ice with a spoon.  Service was like that consistently.

We shared two entrees - the Musulman Curry, with Chicken, and the Stir-Fried Linguine, which for once I was able to convince seafood-challenged hubby to allow me the pleasure of ordering with shrimp.  I loved the addition of sweet potato and avocado to the curry dish; both blended perfectly with the sauce.  I would have loved it even more if it were a tad less sweet and one star higher up the spice ladder.

So I smiled and giggled, and enjoyed that Misti is like the fabric of the restaurant (well, there are brick floors but you know what I mean).

The massaman was unlike any massaman I ever had.  I am used to thick, dark, and sweet coconut-milk based sauce.  This sauce was savory, almost buttery, and thin.  I am not sure how I feel about the butter instead of the coconut flavor.  However, it was CHOCK full of big chunks of veggies (potatoes, red peppers, green peppers, carrots, onions), crisp peanuts, ripe avocado, and then of course, the tofu.

The spice was right on.  I told them I was going to Thailand and Cambodia for my honeymoon and wanted to keep up with the heat.  My nose ran, always a good sign.  Lisa's husband told me he lived in Cambodia, and Lisa told me about her travels in Phuket.  The lunch special came with a canned drink, which I found out after I got Thai iced tea, so I ended up with 2 drinks.  However, I got my can of coke served with a straw, and for anyone who knows I drink soda through a straw, that is pretty cool.

I definitely want to come back and try other dishes.  The atmosphere is pretty and clean, the owners warm, the food spicy and tasty.  And even if Misti isn't physically there, she is definitely ""there""!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,16,14,4,90I9jXzn3a8F1eqp2ldxVg

Volcano chicken:  Horrible. Over-fried, crispy, and couldn't taste the chicken. We even had 3 orders of different spicy levels.

Chicken Pad Thai:  Weird. The noodles were pink(??) and had a fishy flavor. The chicken was basically flavorless. 

Chicken Massaman Curry: Just OK. Nothing outstanding.

It also appears to be very clean and you can view the kitchen from the dining area. The service was also great. The dining area is small, so I would think it fills up pretty quick at lunch and dinner time.

The Pad Thai noodles were the best Pad Thai I have had so far. The yellow curry was good. They make it with white potatoes, sweet potatoes, peppers, and onions. I ordered it 5 spicy and that was pretty hot. I might go for 2 next time. The curry was good, but I still think Archie's yellow curry is the best around Vegas. The roti with yellow curry I did not care for. Actually, the curry was good. It was the bread that I didn't care for. They use a flaky bread that is deep fried. I am use to having baked bread with my roti. I'm sure it is good if you like fried bread, it's just not my thing.

I will definitely be back for the Pad Thai.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,12,11,4,W4_PMn_ijynw_W6YRHNF-Q

4620554,2011-05-09,6,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Pan Asian is a bit of a misnomer. This is one Asian restaurant that does not deserve to be panned. Good food. Great service. I'm definitely a fan of Pan.

The interior is pretty tiny. There is a meager total of 12 chairs in the whole dining area (which was 75% full while we were there). I'm not sure what kind of capacity they can achieve in that space, but if Dal Lat can squeeze in seating for 34 in their tiny restaurant, Pan Asian could probably at least double their current seating chart.

Anthony M and I both ordered the Massaman Curry - I went with beef while he got tofu. This curry dish is on the sweet side, but the heat balanced it out for me. It was a good serving size and I enjoyed everything about it. The large chunks of potato and carrot, the ample pieces of beef, and the flavorful curry all came together very well.

For some reason, the chef offered us some fried banana on the house. It was a generous gesture, but it strangely took a long time to come out and quite honestly, I didn't really enjoy it. It's probably a Filipino thing, but thanks to Turon, any fried banana that doesn't come with jackfruit automatically falls short.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely return to try other items. I was almost tempted to ""pull a Misti"" (yes, we are hereby coining a new phrase) i.e. I was tempted to come back for dinner on the same day. (I didn't).",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,8,6,4,FZ4DxIuOXODiJidteXQ-fw

For starters we got suckered into ordering the Roti.  Pretty tasty don't get me wrong but for pan fried dough with curry dipping sauce, I didn't think it was worth the price PLUS the oil intake i had to consume with it.  I can only take in so much oil a week and would much rather save it for fried chicken.

I had the crying tiger for my entree which turned out to be overcooked tough slices of beef drenched in strange spices in an attempt to make the beef spicy.  The beef was topped on a bed of lettuce and onions with absolutely no flavor at all except the overly used spices.

Friend ordered the curry which was mediocre but a bit on the sweet side.

And I searched the area for a good restaurant that is not expensive. I read the reviews about pan asian and got convinced to try it and with the $20 for $10 deal it sounds really good. 

We got there and greeted by the owner, very pleasing and smiling all the time, felt very welcomed. It's fish Friday so I ordered mostly seafood. Menu prices are all less than $10 but when the food arrived they look so fancy and elegant. I was really impressed and the taste is very good, not your typical Asian cooking where it taste good coz of MSG ... this one, their food taste good because it's fresh and true flavors of the ingredients. My hubby who is not a foodie like me was very impressed too and could not stop eating and after each bite he literally say ""this is so good"" in each bite he takes. 

Even if this is far from our house, we would definitely go back here and buy more of the coupon deal. Calamari is very good, crunchy breading that is just the right amount of coating. Pad Thai is amazing, not the usual yellowish flat noodles in other thai resto, but the flavors are so good together I can eat the noodles by itself even without the meat which means even if I order chicken or shrimp pad Thai I'm sure it will still be very good. Red snapper was very tasty and the sauce super good.

I hate vegetables, as my +1 Michelle (I will refer to her as this throughout the review because she refuses to open a Yelp account, but had a blast with me at the CYME) can attest to, but Pan Asian is the exception!

After reading dozens of 5-star Yelp reviews, I developed a craving to try Pan Asian.  When we pull up in the parking lot we are a bit taken back by the fact that we are the only ones here.  We enter the restaurant and it is empty.  During our entire dinner only one patron came in to pick up a to go order and I have to admit... it scared me!

First off is the Gyoza.  Fancy name for potstickers.. with flavor and texture!  This app came out inside 5 minutes!  David (of David Wong's Pan Asian) was waiting on us and discussed, in depth, the ingredients and its masterful cooking process.  The Gyoza had true texture, something I look for in all foods. At first bite it was crisp, then soft, and then an influx of flavor.  Our app was in front of us for probably six minutes then it was devoured.  I was actually criticized by my +1 for eating the garnish.  I did not know it was not acceptable to also eat the carrots that were artistically placed on the plate.  Party foul on Rich.

Almost immediately upon our successful conquer of the Gyoza, our main courses arrived.  +1 ordered Clear Noodles and Beef, I had the Basil Sauce Stir Fry with Beef.  As previously stated, I am not a veggies guy.  To be blunt (#YelpConfessional) this is my first stir fry... in my life.  The flavor was disgustingly good!  I was gobbling up bell peppers like there is no tomorrow. The onions were perfectly seasoned, the... whatever else was in there... perfect!  Truly, absolutely, perfect!  I agree with Tien's review.  How can food possibly taste this good?  No explanation here!

Michelle's meal... wow!  I was offered a taste, which I could not resist, and it was just as impressive!  I have never been a huge noodle guy, but for every rule there is an exception... this was it.  

My (our) biggest dilemma was the amount of mouth-watering menu choices and which we would eat.  We will be back (multiple times) and I cannot wait for the next visit.  As usual, the balance of Yelp is not wrong.  This place is freakin' awesome!  A true treat to eat, and the prices were incredibly cheap!  Gyoza, Clear Noodles and Beef, Basil Sauce Beef Stir Fry, 2 drinks... $28!

4786314,2016-04-07,1,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Thai style Asian food.  Unique flavors found no where else.

This is one of our favorite go-to mom & pop restaurant for the family.  Simple reason, and our son sometimes want stir fried noodle plates and other times get food envy and end up eating our entrees, we have to like most of the dishes on the menu in case he gets adventurous when he orders.

The spice scales here is serious!  Do not, under any circumstances, ever get beyond a spice level 4.  Trust me I'm Asian and I know these things.  

My favorite dish:  Beef Pho Noodle soup, spice level 2, with extra slice beef.  It is pho noodles, but the cut of beef is slightly different than Vietnamese pho and the spices are more Thai style too.

Husband's favorite: Fish Pad See Ew, spice level 3.  The sliced fish is deep fried in a seasoned batter before being mixed into the plate of noodles.  It has very good flavor and adds texture to a plate of soft flat rice noodles.

If your kid eats spicy, get them spice level 1 here.  If not, don't just ask for zero, tell them your kid can't eat any spicy food.

Service, seat yourself and be patient as they do a lot of take out orders.  Chef Lisa is the chef owner along with her husband David.  Food is obviously the best when she's cooking in the kitchen and when David is working the front of the restaurant.  We've been there when neither of them are there and food / service drops to about a 4 star.

If you come at night, the first thing you will probably notice when you walk in is the harsh and very bright fluorescent lighting over the dining area. Like space ship bright. It would be so much nicer if they dimmed or completely changed the lighting. For lunch it's not really an issue.

The atmosphere here leaves a lot to be desired. Thankfully the service and food make up for it. 

The service is excellent, waitstaff are super friendly and attentive. They are more than happy to answer any questions about the menu, suggest dishes, and honor special requests. The service is an easy 5-stars.

The food is really good. Here are my favorite dishes:

Mango and Tiger Prawn Salad 5/5
This is a very well balanced combination of flavors. It's sweet, salty, tangy, and savory. The greens and herbs were crisp and fresh, the shrimp grilled to perfection. 

Red Curry with Crispy Duck 5/5
This dish is phenomenal. It's not currently on the menu but it's almost always offered as a special. This is the signature dish here and you should not hesitate to order it. It's a little expensive compared to the rest of their menu, but you get a huge duck breast that is easily shared by two people. The duck breast is dredged in flour and deep fried to crispy perfection. Okay, fried duck breast and red curry sounds too rich, but they way the curry is done balances this dish perfectly. The red curry sauce is light, almost watery, and along with the usual vegetables it also has pineapple chunks and fresh grapes. It works perfectly with the rich fried duck breast. Very clever and highly recommended.

Green Papaya Salad 5/5
This salad is awesome, but be careful about the spice level. Even if you order it mild, it's still very spicy. The papaya is cut shoe-string style and comes with a fish sauce dressing that is delicious.

The pineapple fried rice was pretty good but not great. It has a lot of flavor but it's extremely salty. 

Overall, the food and service here are top notch. Ingredients are fresh and flavors are bold yet well balanced. The lighting and atmosphere hold this place back. It's not the kind of setting you want to be in for a romantic dinner and you would not bring a date or business client here if you want to impress them with a nice ambiance. Thankfully you'll forget about these shortcomings when you dig into the food, because it's delicious.",5rL-YgU3CXHbQA3Txzdd9g,3,1,4,n6Fsm4o8f2ysKhFMEBwPbg

Their panang curry has pretty much set the standard for Curry I Crave. The chunks of vegetables are huge, and everything is perfectly cooked; no mushy potato but crunchy carrot. Everything's perfect. Caveat: I am a big fat wuss when it comes to spice, so while it might be too mild for some, it's just mild enough that I can sweat through it, but actually finish everything.

Great place for takeout, too, since they are very quick!

They are a little on the steep side for neighborhood asian food, but they are so high quality, and so unlikely to make my tummy upset, it's pretty much worth it.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,1,1,4,KUK7lBZghIEUmBLQqrSLsg

Why, yes. This IS our new favorite ""I don't want to drive all the way to Lotus"" place. It's probably the only Thai/Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Malaysian place you're likely to find. If you can't find something to love here, McDonald's is right down the street.

Can't decide which particular Asian cuisine you desire? Well, Pan Asian has a little from here and there and it's all executed perfectly and...fine... I will say it ...""kicked up a notch"". There are some little hooks in the dishes that show that someone in kitchen really cares about the food's history and heritage, yet wants to add a little nod to taking it even further. 

I cannot wait very long before I go back for the red curry. There's something about pumpkin being included that just fascinates me. The avocado in my wife's massaman curry was out of this world. Once again, it's that little extra. 

When have I had better fried rice? Never. (I'm not  a huge ""fried rice fan"", so it's not something on which I can have any sort of a baseline as I do with pork chile verde.) It was plenty for dinner and lunch the next day. I ordered it  spiced ""as the chef would make it"". 

I am not Asian. I do not have to impress a cavewoman by eating blistering hot things and showing how manly her protector is.

The chef is a professional. This is kind of what she does for a living, so I trust her to add enough heat to complete the dish and not overpower the other flavors.

In this, she excelled. While it would have been too spicy for my wife, it was perfectly balanced.

Prices
$4.95 for a bowl of Filet Mignon Pho. It's not the ""bigger than your head"" kind you'll get from the places on Spring Mountain, but you won't be wasting any of it, either. It was a great size to split for an appetizer.

The owner/waiter is the kind of friendly guy that just rocks as your host. Attentive, funny, and most importantly, genuine in every respect. It's not forced. You're in his house and he wants you to have a great meal. The chefs do, as well and you can tell they honestly appreciate the praise they so deserve. 

Appetizers are $5 to $9. Entrees average about $10.  Some soups are $8. Most dishes are $10 and $12 for the ones with shrimp. Lunch specials are $7. (If only I had a job near this place!)

The table of six next to us all had amazing meals. We didn't see a single person that didn't thoroughly enjoy it there.

Over the 2 yrs that we patronized their FL location, they got to know us by name along with all of our family members.  This weekend they even recalled various family members favorite dishes - including ours.  We didn't even have to tell them what we wanted to order!

I am not an expert on Thai food or any Asian dishes for that matter.  I just know when something tastes good.  The food is always fresh and piping hot.  I can't take real spicy, so they have always prepared it on the mild side for me.  We have tried many of their dishes.  I encourage asking questions because David will do his best to have you order the right thing for your taste.  One of the things we have always liked is that the food differs from time to time.  That tells us it is made fresh and not taken out of the freezer and microwaved.

For the sake of full disclosure, we didn't know David and Lisa when we first walked in their FL restaurant - just wanted to try the new local restaurant that opened in our neighborhood.  We now consider them friends because they are such lovely people working hard to provide a good experience for their customers.

I came here last weekend, and I was quite disappointed. In short, average service and way over seasoned food. 

1. Red curry with beef. The flavor of the eggplants and pumpkins were fine. However, the beef was soooo tough. It was NOT Edible! It seemed like it was cross-rib roast or some part of meat that's meant for slow cooked. We left all the beef in the plates, and yet the waitress didn't care to notice.

2. Chicken satay. The quality of the meat or the way they cooked it was questionable. Instead of tender, the meat was chewy. 

3. Basil fried rice. It was way over seasoned that it was too salty to eat and the rice was too saucy. You can't taste the right texture of the rice. 

4. Tom kha gai. I did not enjoy the soup either. It was salty but not seasoned properly for tom kha. 

The only dish that I was able to eat was pad kee Mao, and that was a bit over seasoned as well. I will probably not return anytime soon.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,4,3,2,XrWHqfMLzI6CyAK6sB3Y4A

It's small and very casual but if that's what you're in the mood for- go here. The Tiger Shrimp & mango salad was delish! We were warned by the server/owner (?) that we should not order a high # for spice because it's not a cooked dish, it comes out really spicy. Holy crap, he was right. We ordered a 3 and it was SPICY and we can handle spice. So if you don't love spicy food- stick with a 1 or 2. We really enjoyed it though- if you don't like shrimp, it would still be a great salad without the shrimp- great portion size, 2 can share. We also ordered the Clear Noodles and the Basil Stir-fry. We were really happy with both of these entrees as well. 3 items was too much food for 2 people because the portions were generous so we had some to-go and no room for dessert. For 3 nice sized entrees and 2 bottles of water our bill was $32.

We Yelp'd!! around our area and found this place which came up first and had some great reviews.  We were super excited because we LOVE Thai food and curry is my favorite and the reviews for this place were awesome. 

It's kind of hard to see from the street - which is odd because it faces the street.  The sign is hard to read and doesn't really pop so for those driving by I can understand passing it on your first try.  We walked in and the place was cutely decorated, but kind of a divey place in my opinion.  There is no air conditioning running, so I couldn't imagine eating anything spicy there!! I'd probably die.  The owner, David, was very sweet.  He was excited to have customers and wanted to make sure he made our food the way we wanted - he warned us of the spice levels as well!  I got a 6 and it was just perfect.  My friend is a spice FREAk and wanted an 8, but he warned her to try a 6 - she regrets not getting the 8! 

I ordered the Massaman curry because of a review that said ""curry lovers must try this"" and my friend got the Panang curry (my usual fave) The plan was to half both of them and share.  To my dismay the curry was scarce.  It had great flavor, but when I poured it over the rice there were a ton of vegetables and barely any curry.  I was surprised because for $10 I feel like the container should be at least half way full.  I pay $8 at some places that give me 5 times what I got here.  It was very disapppointing.  I did enjoy the flavor, but I won't pay $20 for a full size curry.  Also, I love avocados so I was intrigued, but I don't think they belong in a curry.  Just an odd texture and flavor to mix...

We brought another plate of pad thai to go for my friends roommate and he says it was mediocre, nothing special.  Not to hate on this place, but just bein' honest :) It was A-ok.",mRD8eF_TkCZFqsvrBrHbHg,5,1,3,dQeDZL1blEJoc35_5E5gRA

Can't go wrong with some pot stickers and they were very filling and equally delicious.

After a few days visiting in Vegas, I was craving Asian food, found this place on Yelp and gave it a try. We were a little hesitant when we arrived because the place was empty, 0 customers (it was around 6pm on a Saturday). We gave it a try anyway and it was definitely the right choice. It's a small clean place, nothing fancy. It is very open so you can see the food being made as you wait. Let me tell you, the food here is awesome. Authentic, made to order, and full of flavor. 

We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was great, cooked perfectly and very tasty. I was in the mood to try something different so I had the Massaman Curry (avocado, sweet potatoes, onions, and coconut milk and curry) with chicken added. It was packed with flavor and aromas. A great balance of flavors and I would definitely order it again. The family enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (my hubby said it was good, not the traditional deep fried version), the fried rice (shrimp added), daughter loved it, and the pad thai (it was great as well). You get to choose the level of spiciness for all entrees. My son ordered the pad thai with the highest spice level and it was HOT!!!. We had the fried ice cream for dessert and it was super.

The owner was extremely nice and added a personal touch to the experience.

I planned to have lunch with my mom and grandma in law and they were suggesting to come back. They wanted the Stir Fried Linguini and Massaman again. This was definitely a test in consistency and it was right on and just as good. This time the massaman had avocado pieces which made it even better for me! I also tried the Chicken Tom Khar. Lisa (chef/owner) came and said it wasn't coming out the way she wants with consistency since she changed and tried a different coconut milk. I thought it was still good as the flavor of the spices came through and made up for a lack of creaminess from the coconut milk. 

I guess the BF felt shafted we went without him so we went for lunch the very next day. We had pork pad se ew which had a great flavor. The noodles were a little sticky, but I rather like sticky noodles than the usually greasy treatment of this dish at other places. We got chicken red curry. This is different than most reds I've had, less thick and a bit more watery but the flavor is much more complex. I loved the addition of eggplant and squash to this dish as those went well with the curry flavor. I love meat, but I equally love vegetables that are fresh so it's a big plus for me that the curries here isn't all sauce and meat. The BF and I had a good talk with Lisa about her food and a bit about their past restaurants and such. I loved that she said that since they don't have overhead they spend it on proper good ingredients because it's about the customers. That good food needs good ingredients to become a superior dish. If only every single business adopted that instead of cutting corners on ingredients they might have solid dishes and avid fanbases! And it's not like she is just saying that....we can see her cook and I see that their ingredients are quality (like our Thai Tea had organic Horizon milk) and fresh (herbs from their garden, fresh kefir instead of dried they obtain from LA, Melissa's produce). Considering the quality for the price, it is a steal of a meal! Many places charge about this much for much less quality.

 I LOVE this place! It feels so comfortable to dine here with how friendly they are. It's like being in the Wong's home. 

This is THE BEST Thai food I've had in the city and reminds me of some great Thai food giants in Los Angeles (if you didn't know- has the largest population of Thai in the US) solid Thai home cooking. I thought Thai Grill solved all my Thai food answers here in Vegas, but I think this has definitely bumped to my number one.

It's made with flat rice noodles, vegetables, and meat/seafood, I usually get it with pork or chicken but y'know, whatever floats your boat. TRUST me on this... you want to order this dish. It sounds generic, perhaps a little plain...yes, I know it does...it's not. In fact, when you do order this, you're going to want to punch everyone you know in the face for not telling you about it sooner.

Mr. Wong is the chef and he makes the best Pad See Ew I have ever had. I gladly sacrifice any chance at being in shape or watching my carb intake in exchange for the opportunity to shovel this stuff into my mouth hole. 

The restaurant is tiny, laid out weird and you can't help but watch what's going on in the kitchen as they prepare your food. This man is all about the fresh ingredients and quality food. I haven't had much else on the menu but it could be the one item and I'd be just as happy.",7rngkJ2lES5OthbMb4qe1Q,3,5,5,g2w_N-o8R1Z9ml3qK3-Cdw

I am happy to say, that it does not disappoint! Chef Wong has some very delicious cooking here! He was also very friendly and came to talk to us, and said he made the basil special just for us by cooking it and searing it...which really made it fragrant and added a nice consistency! I will ask for it like this next time for sure!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#JCVcxvcLGhlfJivt4Ceoww

The drunken noodles (pad kee mao) was my most favorite way I've had this dish! And I order this EVERYWHERE I go! Chef Wong was NOT afraid to add spice, so it was a good heat and excellent flavor, especially with that basil!

The ""Basil sauce"" (pad ka pao) was good, and also had a nice heat behind it, but I really like it when the chicken is minced into very small pieces...the meat really absorbs the heat and all those juices in the sauce that way. Since these were large pieces of chicken and there were tons of green beans in there, this wasn't my most favorite way of doing it, but still good!  I don't think I've ever had more green beans in a dish before lol :

And lastly, the pad thai was also good. It was a little on the sweet end, but we normally don't order this dish, so I can't really compare it to others in town. It seemed like it had a better taste though than we have had before.  It also had a great presentation :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ek0n6bBZNz8W77UAGB17JQ

Overall, this is an excellent place to check out, especially with their lunch specials and great food!  Prices are a little cheaper here than most in town, but the servings are a tiny bit smaller too, so it works out overall.

I am not sure if I can jump out and say it is my most favorite in town, but with them making the best version of drunken noodles I've had, I will be back again for sure!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,2,0,5,UpFHOvCmORH_TQf6YYWd4A

Looking at the menu, everything listed looked so appetizing.  I wanted to try them all.  My budget for that day for lunch wasn't more than $6 so I ordered Tom Kha soup made with coconut, chicken, some different herbs I've never seen or tasted before, lemon grass, and amongst other things.  

It was the exact kind of goodness I just needed on a cold windy day.  The sour taste was just perfect and not overpowering the whole dish.  Everything together was combined well.  The service was also comforting as the employees all were very patient, and easy to talk to.  It's also great to be able to speak with the chef.  It's rare that chefs talk to their patrons anymore.

It was then cultivated in San Francisco for 10 years when I moved there for work. So, I would like to think that I know good Thai food. I ordered the pad sew ew and the massaman curry both with tofu and at level 6 of spiciness. The husband, David(?), said this would be spicy...is that ok? It was, and they both were delicious. The noodle dish is my ""go-to"" Thai dish and I tried this curry dish over my usual go-to, yellow curry. The reason I picked this one is it had potatoes and peppers (like yellow curry) but, it also had....nuts, cashews I think, and ..... avocados! Yum-I don't think I've ever had avocados in my Thai food before-it worked.

They have other types of Asian dishes but, when I saw the Thai stuff, had to try it. I would definitely recommend as it was really good and we need to keep these good mom and pop places going in this crap economy.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,1,0,4,gLhRxRPu6xI3l6EjYKZf5Q

5279422,2017-10-12,3,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Tucked away in a tiny shopping plaza on South Durango Drive it is likely that many have driven past David Wong's Pan Asian dozens of times without even noticing the Restaurant is there, and yet in reality the kitchen has been serving the West Side of Las Vegas for over six years while also amassing a fairly large number of Chefs and industry folks who consider it a part of their regular dining rotation.

A Husband and Wife operation, he the business end while she does the cooking, it was as part of a group of nine including two children that several smaller tables were combined to form one large space on Saturday night just past 7:00pm, the arrangement accounting for more than half of Pan Asian's Covers on this particular night though at least three-fold as many came and went over the course of ninety minutes with call-in or online orders.

Called Pan Asian based on an embrace of several styles of cooking ranging from Vietnamese to Malaysian to Thai, the menu having undergone many changes over the years based on old pictures and reviews found via Social Media, Autumn 2017 continues to see David and Lisa largely focused on Thai dishes such as Drunken Noodles and several styles of Curry, a chalk board of specials hanging overhead adding another five or six choices to a double-sided laminate with prices so low that one wonders how the place continues to offer such large portions without having raised prices more than a few cents over the last few years.

Employing one additional server in addition to the Husband and Wife in the kitchen, her demeanor exceedingly pleasant as she kept up with water and share-plate requests effortlessly while also packaging and acting as cashier for numerous take-out orders, it was after a lengthy perusal of the options and accounting for two guests deferral of Pork that a two-course order of nine plates was requested, five Thai Tea's and three additional orders of Rice pushing the total bill to just $22 per adult including tax and tip.

Using good ingredients and working as a very small team, Mr. Wong joining Lisa at the stove to make sure everything came out as requested in a short amount of time, it was after no more than fifteen minutes of talk as one of the youngsters watched College Football on the television that the first five plates were delivered 2-2-1, the Green Papaya Salad starting things off with a good bit of heat at ""Level 6"" while the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli felt a little one-dimensional with Celery blunting the flavor of both finely ground Chicken and Shiitakes.  

Immediately happy that someone had suggested Thai Tea to begin, the Sugar and Cream helping to quell bold spicing when transitioning from plate to plate, it was immediately on the heels of the Ravioli that two plates of Flat Noodles were presented next, the Pad See Yew recommended by Carson Kitchen Chef John Courtney packing a lot of funkiness thanks to the fermented Black Beans but still letting the thin Beef show while the Drunken Noodles bested World Famous Lotus of Siam in terms of not only flavor, but also by possessing less oil and a lower price. 

Rounding out the Noodles with thin ""Linguini"" stir-fried similar to the Pad Kee Mao but with Asparagus Tips in place of Green Beans it was with share plates refreshed that a trio of Curries plus a generous portion of Basil Fried Rice were next presented, the Rice an all-around crowd pleaser with plump Shrimp and chunks of Chicken Breast hidden amidst Grains that were generally fluffy but occasionally crisp plus plenty of spices and good Produce.

With many at this point already starting to get full and family-style helpings decreasing dramatically for some it was nonetheless with wide-eyes that all took in the golden Duck resting in a pool of creamy Pumpkin Curry, the $21.95 daily special $6 cheaper than Lotus of Siam and far better executed with plenty of crispy skin and supple Flesh to go around, the sliced Beef in both Green and Panang Curries also very good though fairly similar to one another save for the fact that the Green version was a bit more spicy while the Panang was subtly nutty.

Finishing off the remaining Jasmine Rice with residual Red Curry, only a few spoonfuls of the Green returning the kitchen at meal's end, it was with most too full for Dessert that the check was requested, a shock to all when everything rang-up at just over twenty-dollars each including tax and a 20% tip for a lot of good food, attentive service and such a pleasant evening.

Called by two independent local Chefs ""a hidden gem"" while several at the table lamented having either never known about the place or having not been back in so long there is no doubt David Wong's Pan Asian belongs on the short-list of Las Vegas' best bargain dining in addition to receiving some ""Best Thai"" nods, though obviously both the size of the space and the menu indicate David and Lisa have no interest in challenging the likes of Lotus or Chada.in terms of breadth or creativity.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,5,5,T1U4N-f9rN2EMedJSxLnEQ

Pan Asian is quite a quaint place. It's not a huge establishment -- it's actually quite tiny. It has about 5-6 tables only so if it gets busy, it'll be real busy. 

The first time we went, I decided to go with their stir-fried linguini which had asparagus, tomatoes, bell peppers, garlic, chili, basil, and your choice of meat. For me, I decided to choose chicken with it. I guess you could say something like, ""That's not a thai dish!"" ""What?! Go to thai restaurant to eat non-thai dish?!"" Psh. Don't be a hater. And I have to say that ... it was not a bad decision at all to order the dish. 

You also get to choose your level of spiciness for your dish. The range goes from 1 to 10. On yelp, there is this tip from Roger that you have to go spicy or go home. So guess what I did? I chose level 10. No, I didn't do it as a challenge or for ""fun"" -- I mean, who does that for fun anyways? Let's set fire to my intestines so I can laugh while it's happening. I personally love spicy food therefore, I gotta go spicy or why am I even there?! The server was nice enough to warn me. She asked if I've ever eaten there and that their level 10 is really really spicy. I will not back down! You will not scare me! I still went for a level 10. Then a little bit later, the cook himself warned us about the spiciness of level 10. I love you guys! But give me my spicyass food!! 

The linguini .. was delicious! It had a very interesting and different flavor to it. I do believe that he uses satay sauce to stir fry the noodles and with the spiciness of the peppers, it was delicious. I just love how it's not huge chunk of pepper flakes in my bowl. A lot of other thai places will tell me to get a lower level of spice and if it isn't enough, I could add in pepper flakes myself. Gee, that just means one thing. You use pepper flakes to cook your food instead of using actual peppers. 

My friends, on the other hand, ordered curry and pad see ew. The curry didn't really catch my attention when I tried it. Their pad see ew was really good though. Very good aroma. Though, for pad see ew, I would probably suggest not making it spicy. It doesn't really do it much good. 

As for the second time we went, I was thoroughly surprised that the server remembered me. We decided to try out their tiger prawn shrimp salad and the server goes, ""What spicy level do you want? 10?!"" I was surprised but I laughed. She remembered me! I guess not a lot of people order level 10 there. But I eventually settled with a level 5 for spiciness. I know.. I know.. LEVEL 5 ONLY?! What! Why didn't I level 10 that !!?? Well, for one, salads are a completely different story when it comes to the spiciness level. It's almost doubled ... plus, I was sharing the dish with my friends. I'd rather not send them to the hospital with fiery intestines. 

The dish, however, was delicious. A level 5 was the perfect amount of spice. It gets that fire in your mouth going. The prawns they used also did not taste like they were frozen shrimps. They tasted pretty fresh and the way they lightly grilled them on the side was really good. Really yummy dish and I think it'd be perfect for summer!

As for my entree, I decided to go with a pad thai at level 10. I opted out for the peanuts and carrots cause I don't care for pieces of peanuts in my noodles and I just hate carrots. The dish was very good, but, I don't think it's better than the linguini in my opinion. There was nothing that sets it apart. It's a tinge of sweetness and I think because of the sweetness, it's not as spicy as it could be. Though, it is a progression of heat so as you heat, the hotter it gets. It's the best kind of spice :D !!! 

The only things keeping me from giving Pan Asian five stars is because I'm thoroughly confused. When reading the menu ... you kind of question yourself: is this a Thai place? A Vietnamese place? A Chinese place? etc etc. They have a dish or two from different Asian cuisines. They even have hainan chicken! What the?? 

The second thing is their thai tea. WAY too sweet. It had no tea flavor. No go! 

Overall though, it was a delicious experience. And I definitely will go back.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,2,4,eKrFicpnYkb-0Gj-1p5kVQ

We share the same philosophy of sharing food to maximize our chances of trying multiple dishes and sometimes to cut back on calories. We will even order one dish at one restaurant and move to another to try something else.

Not here at Pan Asian. We sat down and ordered enough to keep us full the whole day. They are running a special with Yelp, a $10 for $20. This is steal because you can get a whole lot of food for twenty. We started off with their famous chicken wings. 7 or 8 large meaty wings came out, fried to perfection, and NON-BREADED. I hate breaded wings because they get soggy fast. These were some of the best wings I have ever had. They come with a side of thousand island. My sister and I normally don't like mayo, but we lightly smeared on a bit. If that was not enough, I had ordered the level 7 Tofu Massaman Curry. It was no inferno, but it had the creep up on you heat. There is a genuine point to their scale. I am tired of ordering a ten and wondering where the spice is. The sweet potato were soft, the avocado creamy, and the tofu lightly fried. In the end, the sauce was all that was left and I ended up spooning that on top of the Fried Clear Noodles. My sister even ate a full bowl of rice because the curry was just that good. Most of the time she eats half a bowl and feigns being full. I am beginning to learn that usual habits will go out the window when you enter the door.

It was cool because we witnessed them filming a segment on local eats. Look for Doreen Fang's blog to watch the spot on Pan Asian. There were some delays in order being made because of it, but it was like being in the audience of a cooking show. Speaking with Doreen after was awesome because she is putting a lot of emphasis on local mom and pop shops.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,6,5,HZQndVziQDAnsZ5hLx-NgQ

Had mostly done take out in previous ventures there so decided to have a nice sit down meal which allowed me to explore some of their off the menu specials.

I didn't even throw out a number and simply said ""medium"" and was still clamoring for refills every few minutes.   That's by no means a complaint, but just a warning to anyone ordering for the first time (even though it's been emphasized several times already throughout the other reviews...)

Won ton soup:
The broth and vegetables were nice. Bok choy must be the prettiest vegetable on earth. The dumplings/won tons were not enjoyable, though, and they are the heart of the soup. I found them to be absolutely flavorless. 


Fried tofu: I've had fried tofu before, in tofu massaman.  Separately, however, I hated it!  I can't blame the restaurant for this- I may just not be a fan of fried tofu. It had NO flavor whatsoever. Thank goodness for the attractive, slightly spicy and very tasty sauce  that came with it, otherwise I might have thrown the tofu away.

Massaman:  The potatoes were fully cooked, and that's important, since almost every massaman I've had in restaurants included undercooked potatoes. These potatoes are attractively cut, too.  I also detected thick carrots and - possibly- sweet potato mixed in with a few pieces of chicken and bell pepper.  I was disappointed in the thin sauce, and wish the portion size had been a bit larger. The flavor was all right, but I've tasted massaman elsewhere that I liked much better.  My friend tried the pho and loved it.

Gyoza- pretty good, very crunchy and freshly fried.
Linguine- very flavorful and filling. Don't be fooled by the Linguine it's no Italian dish it was very much Thai flavored just with an unusual noodle choice.
Tempura Fried Cheesecake- lol I mean obviously this is gonna taste awesome but it's execution was a little off. The closer you get to the center of the cake the colder and harder it becomes since they basically just battered up the cheesecake and dropped it in the fryer.

I shared two dishes with Mr Tea' for lunch; Panang Curry & Crying Tiger 
The Panang Curry was really good and tasty.. I enjoyed having my Panang Curry not too sweat and it was just right! 
The Crying Tiger was a dish that I tried out for the first time.. It was a handful plate of green salad with lots of red onions and grilled steak. The flavor of lime, garlic, chili, and fish sauce were very strong. But I love fish sauce in general,, like often used in Vietnamese, Thai, or Korean dishes. I thought the dish was little bit salty to me since the main ingredient was a Thai fish sauce but,, honestly it was better in taste after try it out over the Jasmin Rice that we got it for the curry.

Firstly, it is clean.  It is always the first thing I notice.  This place is very well kept.  

Secondly, you can see the kitchen so it is an open concept.  Be wary of a place afraid to show you their kitchen.  The smells as we walked in were wonderful and tantalizing.  Made me even hungrier and I was already hungry.

Third, we were greeted by the prettiest little girl.  Okay young woman, but to a 49 year old she is still a girl to me. :-) she sat us at our table and was our waitress.  She answered all our questions and gave me suggestions when I asked for them.  She was very helpful.

I decided on Drunken Noodles with Chicken (heat level 3 - thanks to another customer she suggested I go for a 3 instead of a 4 - so thank you Ms. customer for your suggestion - you were right!) and my husband ordered the garlic basil stir fry with chicken (heat level 2).  Their heat scale is 0 - 10.  Just to warn - their 3 is more of a 5 to me but I am a white girl born in Nebraska so take that to mean what you like.  Just saying, maybe ask for a lower heat then if you want more heat you can always add to it at the table.

Now for the taste!  My husband said it was the best stir fry he has ever had and he hands down loved it.  I tasted it and he is right - it was really delicious.

I loved my Drunken noodles with chicken.  The veg (green beans, red and green peppers, onions, Thai Basil) was fresh and cooked perfectly - hot all the way through with a nice crunch to it without being the least bit raw.

Tonight, I ordered the boat noodles. As any boat noodle lover knows, the crispy pork skin is essential to the experience. It adds a sharp, textured contrast to the richness of the meat and the broth. 

I received my order to find the crispy pork skin missing. I inquired with the staff. Water, meet duck. They laughed it off stating that their supply was exhausted and they'd just give me ""a little bit more"" next time. What good does that do me, silly Pan? No explanation was given for why it wasn't brought to my attention when I initially placed my order.

For those who don't frequent Pan Asian, this was not a kitchen error left un-communicated to the front side of the restaurant. The cook is the owner and his wife interfaces between the front and the back, with another family member serving the tables.

Truly wouldn't have been an issue if they'd apologized right off the bat for a simple oversight. Instead, they dismissed it as a trivial matter and behaved as if they'd hoped I wouldn't notice the missing ingredient and ended up with their hands caught in the cookie jar. A disappointingly unprofessional experience all the way around. 

Pan Asian, I will miss your boat noodles, but time will bring us closure and soon you will be a distant memory of a good thing that was, but no longer is.

5918813,2011-05-10,3,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"Pan Asian is literally just down the street from where I am currently living at. It has been opened for only 2-3 weeks and without a splashy and eye catching sign, it may be easy to drive past on Durango unless you are really looking for it.

The restaurant has a large kitchen and prep area, but the dining area is comparatively small.  At the moment there are not too many tables and chairs setup (seating capacity is probably only at 16-20).  The interior is decorated simply but nicely.  The owner David Wong and his wife, the chef, are both super friendly.

After my first spontaneous visit after just having had dinner at another new restaurant that recently opened just down he street, mainly based on Misti Y's positive comments about this new restaurant.  So I was looking to see what their menu offers and try some desserts.  The Thai dessert looks interesting, but I was told that it was not available that day and to try the Cheesecake Tempura. It was regular slice of cheesecake that was cut into smaller pieces and tempura fried. It has a different texture and if you enjoyed fried desserts, this one is probably something you should try.

The next day I dropped by after a stop at the Costco Food Truck Fest #2, and tried the Massaman Chicken Curry.  It was tasty and the portion was generous. Before I left, the chef also gave me a large cup of longan tea (on the house)  that she brewed from dried longan that her relatives visiting from Thailand had brought her.  The flavor is sweet, as it was sweetened with brown sugar, and maybe that was why it also reminded me of the Winter Melon Tea that I used to drink when I was in Taiwan.  I really enjoyed the drink and the generous gesture.

Day 3, I had a Sababa Groupon to redeem before it expires. So after finishing the Sababa Special, which I thought would fill me up, I still had room for dessert and dropped in again to see if Thai Sticky Rice and Mango would be on the menu.  Lucky for me, the chef said if I was willing to wait a few minutes, she will make it from scratch for me.  It was a simple and very traditional Thai dessert served especially during the summer, when mango are in season.  And My T and his wife just happened to drop in for dinner.  

With a friendly couple that runs the restaurant and serving good food at reasonable prices, Pan Asian is already starting to get a decent Yelp following.  I know I will be back soon to try more of the menu.

Decor:  4/5  Minimalist decorations that just works for the space.

Food:  5/5 I enjoyed the food I have ordered thus far.  

Service:  5/5  The owner and his wife, Chef Lisa, are both super friendly. Can't have a meal prepared and served to you by a nicer couple.

Price/Value:  5/5  The price is fair and the portions are pretty generous. Lunch menu portion is the same as the dinner, so an even greater value.

Location is super close by, and even after I move a little further away, still worth the detour back from work or to satisfy a Pan Asian craving.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,4,5,wTZSIfiC5mFrTwc8hWVeJw

Most of their menu items are spicy, so if you are not into spicy food your choices will be limited, but the owners and chef are VERY accommodating and will try to cater to your specific needs. Oh, and yes dessert, we definitely had room for dessert. We tried the fried ice cream as well as the fried cheesecake, I definitely like the fried cheese cake better, although we did clean both plates, Hungry much? We are definitely coming back to this place, it is pretty small, but I like to call it cozy, oh & YES they speak very fluent English! You can see the chef, who is David Wong's wife, lovingly preparing the meal you are about to chow down. You can clearly tell that she puts her heart & soul into her cooking, even though this is a small mom & pop restaurant all the dishes are presented like a work of art. They take pride in their product that is why they give it their best. So if you are having second thoughts, banish those fears from your brain, try this place out and you will discover a gem in the middle of Sahara.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,1,1,5,GfA80UoQK8dJoPxyffE0sw

I love their curries. The panang and massaman have great flavor.

The stir fried linguini has asparagus, tomatoes, sweet pepper,garlic, chili and basil-need I say more?

My husband is a fan of the DW(david wong) fried rice and the Red Nah Noodles.(I am too)
 
If you like coconut shrimp you got to have theirs. As for a soup, I recommend the filet mignon ""PHO"".

While their pad thai is as good as any ones I've tasted, I much perfer to experiment and order other things on their menu.

Desserts, I hear they are good but I never have room.

They have added quite a few booths and seating options and can now seat quite a few more people comfortably inside the restaurant, plus the booths are sparkly and red. Nice.

Service and the food were still the stars of the show here. I tried the Red Curry, Roti and Filet Mignon Pho on this occasion. They were all fantastic. The pho is more of a Thai version and has a great heat. The Red Curry was pretty awesome, but I think the Massaman is still my favorite. Looking forward to trying some of their rice and noodle dishes on the next visit.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,5,QhO4lmWeotzQ-l8J8-CwIA

I am a HUGE fan of Pan Asian, and an even bigger fan of owner David Wong and his wife, Lisa, the chef! They are awesome people serving tasty, fresh food- hence the reason I round up. 

My first encounter was during lunch with my toddler daughter. We started with the Chicken Gyoza- and I could barely get a bite because my daughter practically ate the entire plate herself.  I also ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu- and it was probably the best I have ever had. And I have eaten A LOT of Pad See Ew.  

Came back for lunch yesterday, and as much as I wanted to order the Pad See Ew again, I thought I should try something new. I ordered the Massaman Curry that other yelpers have been raving about.  It was my first time trying this dish and I am sad that I hadn't tried it sooner.  The potatoes and carrots were perfect and the avocado, bell peppers, and peanuts gave it a nice texture. 

My husband ordered the Thai style ""Pho"" and the broth was BURSTING with flavor.  I am a huge fan of Vietnamese Pho and have very high standards, but I have found a new love in this Thai version. Even after my husband added spice to it, it only enhanced the flavor and made it even better.  This is one dish that I can't stop thinking about.  I can't wait to go back and have a bowl all to myself. 

My toddler daughter was being a tad bratty and wouldn't sit still to eat her meal, so David came to my rescue and bribed her with some ice cream (with my permission of course).  Well, she sat like a perfect angel and ate her lunch.  We also ordered the fried bananas, and like Paolo D., I prefer the Filipino version with jackfruit- but I must say that the coconut and sesame seeds in this dish was a nice surprise, and my daughter's vanilla ice cream was the perfect accompaniment.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,1,2,5,Z87j3rBmfT33xT48vtVsLg

We walked into the little strip mall, it looked like a dingy restaurant with old seating, but dont let the seating fool you this place is amazing.  It's run by a husband wife combo and boy do they know how to cook.

We ordered pad-thai and the Red curry.  Both were amazing.  I asked it to be extremely spicy because I love spice.  They didnt make it as spicy as I wanted it to be, but I dont care - it tasted amazing.  They make it to your taste if you ask them too.  It's like a home cooked meal basically.  The husband wife are from NY and are very entertaining and friendly as well.

We also finished off the meal with fried ice cream which was tasty.  Would move to vegas to eat here often. :)",M0yU5oNTKDPo51AlSDKNMA,0,0,5,RFPaubGO1U4R4A5wMnzz3Q
5981565,2018-04-25,0,Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA,"It was my first time ordering from this place, as it was close to my home. After searching through door dash and grub hub I decided to check the reviews on yelp of these places. This place had a nice rating score to reviews ratio. I decided to check the menu out and cross-reference any pics in the album. Everything looked pretty good and I kept seeing these noodles. So, I too ordered the chicken linguine noodles. The cashew veggie stir-fry with an extra side of rice. I was feeling really good so I also got a Thai tea. Everything was fresh and was actually really good. The Thai tea was a little extra sweet but that could just be me. The only thing they could improve on is the communication. I never got a confirmation alert. After about 45 mins I called to place to confirm and the lady said my order was out for delivery. Too bad for the drive not having change I wasn't able to tip. I would order again.",8Pf11okBaytx5LGsUkmwYQ,0,0,3,MMUI8PWJ_G26_2VnpwMi2g
