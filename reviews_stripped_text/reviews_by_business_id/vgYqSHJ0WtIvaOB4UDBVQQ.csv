So I thought maybe it's not working we drove around went inside, waited another 4 minutes no one.  We were about to leave and then someone came out... Then we placed our order for 3 root beer floats.  She left then came back... Said registers not opened, but could pay cash and she would give change? Really? Nope wanted to use my card... She just looked at me. I said never mind, sorry I inconvenience you and walked out.  Looked for hours they opened at 10am I was there at 11:20am. We went to sonic instead which was awesome! We will never go again to this a&w",WKf9Lfwbhbl-I5ydJ5m4yg,0,0,1,4agVAu3uFZ6krmX7fH7uMg

Nothing was stocked for drinks or condiments and there were no customers at all. The cashier never smiled not even looked at us while we were talking. And when we got our food it wasn't thoroughly cooked. The cheese was cold and the fries tastes like they had been sitting all day. 
I used to rave about A&W but this place is awful. I'll never be back.",KNfLQhNtTAwToLQUukIvJg,0,0,1,OOVFFpD8uWOyBGqdWgjGLQ
