This is something that they serve all day but you get smaller portions before 4. So it's not like they put the food away. This is the type of a decision that makes or breaks a restaurant. To many establishments look to say no so quickly but a yes goes along way.This was for going to be for 4 people from 4 different families. Now they lost business from 4 families who will tell others. Plus we cater in twice a month and was looking for a new Chinese place. Next time this place answers the phone at 3:55 for 4:00 deadline they should think twice about saying no.,Io-k0m5WiBr8Kd2GjIEYyA,1,0,1,I__TI1mskcXz6d13BT_eZg

I asked nicely for a box to be brought to the table, and the waiter shuffled my plate away, and when I asked for my plate back, and he insisted on taking it away and boxing it up in the back (pet peeve).

Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway - I won't be going back. China One does a *much* better job at Americanized Chinese food.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,5,2,2,PpO1bCqXOEUg5B8nYy261w

However, the beef broccoli was delicious and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.

Welllll, our delivery showed up over an hour later (we live 7 minutes from the restaurant) and the food was luke warm.  I had General's chicken and it was greasy, too much breading, a little grissley, and too much dark meat.  My husband had the kung pao chicken and it was drowning in sauce and not at all spicy.  The crispy noodle with shrimp and beef was ""eh"" but smelled fantastic (unfortunately the taste didn't match the smell).  Nothing stood out.

I don't understand why it has to be so salty. I've had Chinese food that is great and not too salty why can't they just decide across the board to add less salt?

I looked at the menu in the window and decided I'd give it a try sometime.

I ordered online through the Eat24 ordering available through Yelp checking a pick up time of ASAP.  I ordered one order of vegetable egg rolls (comes four to an order), an order of Singapore vermicelli, and an order of combo chow fun with a note requesting no shrimp.

The egg rolls were standard and OK.  The Singapore vermicelli had a pepper symbol next to it on the menu but there was little heat to it at all.  Since this was a take out order, I added crushed red pepper from a Thai restaurant I had leftover onto the vermicelli and I made it peppery on my own.  There was a fair amount of been, chicken , and good sized shrimp.  My wife's combo chow fun was good.  It had a nice tasting sauce and they did not add shrimp as requested because she won't eat shrimp.  

The take out order was packed well.  I had a 5 minute wait as they had two orders in front of me and my drive is just about a mile.  I was offered water while I waited and the staff was present.

I'll give the place another try.  I could see getting take out from the Chow Mein House from time to time.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,8,3,OGCPigxWoPiMhR938HidGw

BUT, they are putting in the effort, so I can't hate that. 

The menu has expanded and the lunch specials are great, though not quite the value they used to be. I don't care for the egg roll or the egg drop soup. The soup is way too thick and yolky tasting for my preference. 

The service is mediocre.....slow and impersonal. 

I LOVE the Szechwan chicken. 

I still need to try more of the offerings since they changed.

Overall, it's okay. I will go for lunch unless they really piss me off just because it's convenient to my work and a good value. It's not good enough to invest in dinner for my family though.",_j1FvCtYI0hPp_vsy-QuVw,4,0,3,bZzWuZS8Qekr-ZuQtAajQg

4026923,2017-05-03,0,Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA,"Nice dressy place with food being small portioned and meh flavored. In fact it does taste Smokey as if made by smokers who do not wash well after their smoke break.

     Worst service ever, I have eaten here quite a bit and being a local I had always dined in but for once I had family from out of town and I wanted them to try one of my go to places. You'd think seeing me over and over they would treat me as a regular and nice service. So I do suffer from a case of OCD so I order how I would eat my food and I started with an order of Hot and sour soup, ordered about $70 of food, he repeated my order and I mentioned he forgot about the soup and he said ok and wrote it down, I gave him my debit card and it got declined no biggie I carry cash so il just figure out why my card got rejected. 

    My card was part of a breach so it was cancelled another card was on its way. So I get my order and I got some of the smallest portions I have ever gotten at a Chinese joint especially for $75, well they forgot my soup so I ask for it and they charge me for it, that's fine ok il pay so I give them a credit card. Now when my card got rejected it was empty so no problem I know I got money I know it was some thing reasonable, by the time they charge me my soup now there are guest in the place. The waiter looks at my card and tells me ""are you sure your cards not going to get rejected?"" Really I just gave you a different card different color and just gave you $75 cash. I ask for a manager and he comes out and looks at me and begins talking in mandarin I believe to the other workers and they say he doesn't want to talk to me. I demand my money back as I felt disrespected in so many ways as I'm getting my money the ""Manager"" approaches the counter with 3 other workers and they begin to speak and laugh and point at me. 

    I mean really this is a business where someone pays so much for your small portion food and you make condescending remarks in a foreign language I mean if that's the type of business you support then please enjoy. There are so many other options for Chinese please support friendly caring businesses not places like this, if they do this to my face who knows what they do behind our backs.

Sizzling rice soup is bland with chicken that was graced with a bit too much cornstarch...avoid!

Pad Thai is FULL of red & green bell peppers and purple onions so for my pepper & onion haters out there, do not order this dish!!!  Chicken also tasted like it had been swished around a wok full of seafood....that or it was a day past its prime (I'll find out tomorrow!).  

The sizzling seafood dish (#1 house special) should be called swimming seafood stink dish because it is sloshing around in a soupy, dishwater grey sauce that is ick-o!  We picked out the shrimp & scallops to take home & left the rest of the mess (mushrooms that were bruised and probably too old to be eaten, carrots, zucchini, lobster bits & disgusting chunks of non-distinguishable fish). 

Service is not any better.  Waiter was impossible to understand, sizzling rice soup was sloshed all over the table cloth, wine glass had leftover lips on the rim, water was splashed all over when glasses were filled, plates were clanked and knocked around very loudly & main dishes were served about 10 minutes apart.

4484721,2017-07-16,4,Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA,"It has finally come down to this in our quest for decent Chinese food: either bite the bullet and drive to Spring Valley, San Francisco, or New York, or hop a plane to Beijing.

The only reason I'm giving Chow Mein House two stars instead of one is that I liked the minimalist modern decor - lots of white, a bit of light wood, and green bamboo plants for contrast.  But the food sucks.

We skipped soup, not surprising in 110° weather, but only because we couldn't agree on one.  I wanted to be able to compare the hot and sour with every other place we've had it, but my husband wanted a different one.  So we just ordered two entrees:  Beef curry and Szechuan chicken.  Unlike everywhere else, this fowl (foul?) dish had no ginger listed, so we asked for it.  We also added broccoli.  In the interest of full disclosure, we also asked that no sugar and no extra salt be added.  I realize that this might affect the taste, but the dish had no sauce whatsoever!  When I complained, the waiter said ""well, you wanted no salt or sugar.""  NO!  I didn't say I wanted no SAUCE, just no extra salt.  I've had Szechuan chicken maybe a million times, with and without the sugar/salt stipulations, and this one was in a class by itself.  And it flunked.

The vegetables in both dishes were undercooked.  One reason I love veggies in Chinese restaurants is because the crisp-tender results are something I can't ever approximate at home.  Oh, maybe I could if I wanted to use a wok at extra-high heat and then clean up the grease for three days.  Here, I almost broke a tooth on unexpectedly uncooked carrot.  

The beef curry had absolutely no taste of curry.  The kitchen remade it, and it was marginally better, but that margin was minuscule.  This dish includes potatoes; they were cooked, but with a texture that was downright weird, somewhat gummy, and they didn't taste like potatoes.  Here, too, the vegetables were woefully undercooked.

The final straw came with the bill.  I wasn't surprised or annoyed that they charged $1 extra for broccoli.  But they added another buck for ginger.  Note that they did not take off $1 for the sugar and salt they didn't add.  This was, IMO, beyond petty.  And to update a previous negative comment by another Yelper, the upcharge for brown rice is now $2, not the dollar he complained about.  But at least it's now listed on the menu.  In very small print.

4573763,2016-12-28,2,Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA,"Solid choice for familiar yet inspired dishes. Chow Mein House has been open about 18 months and has hit its stride, according to some locals. Went with a small group and ordered a number of things to try, with different tastes and requirements easily met. When you start with the lovely deep fried crunchies and red sauce, you're instantly able to settle into your seats.

The Corn Egg Drop soup is a good starter and great a chilly night. The potstickers can be either veggie or pork and veggie; steamed or fried. The fried were not greasy, and had a nice flavor, especially in the dipping sauce. Tried the Tempura Shrimp, too, which seemed out of place on the menu, but still tasty. Not exceptional shrimp, but the coating and perfect crispness won the day. 

The Chicken Chow Mein was a hit. We modified it by removing the veggies (I know, right?) but it was good despite our meddling. The scallops and asparagus special was very good; bay scallops and tons of asparagus with some carrots and black beans in a black garllcky sauce. Also had a nice shrimp and veggies dish (peppers, onion, cabbage and peas) in a eggy clear sauce. If you go with the Chicken Fried Rice, you won't be disappointed - but you may not be blown away. (Not that Chicken Fried Rice is the blow-you-away type dish in the first place, lol).

All in all, good family-style eatin'. Saw a number of couples, too, so the warm hospitable room makes a comfortable place for all parties. Chow Mein House is a great option. It may not have the razzle dazzle of PF Chang's, but it also doesn't have the three-hour wait on a Saturday night.

I wasn't expecting much since I've had my share of bad experiences with Chinese delivery (particularly in this area). This, however, was not one of them. Chow Mein House had good, quick service complimented by very well prepared food. Not to mention the place itself is quite nicely decorated. Not bad at all for your run of the mill Chinese place. 

I saved the 5th star only because the drinks aren't available if you order online, and though it is good quality Chinese, it's not out of the ordinary. 

I ordered over the phone around lunchtime and my doorbell rang in less than 20 minutes. I had the mongolian beef w/ fried rice (from the lunch menu), sesame prawns and a boba drink. The prawn portions were on the small side, but the lunch portion was healthy. The beef was soft and moist, not the usual tough and chewy. The prawns were tastey and nicely prepared as well. My prayers for boba without the 15+ minute drive have also been answered (finally!), and they make it soft and chewy like how I like them.",vQbe4by3B3ozveeYHWVx2Q,3,0,4,mG2nNsN1bDVmAzhuSrgHTg

I would say we probably waited for only 15 min max on our 4 orders - Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodle, Combo Fried Rice, Chicken Katsu (comes with white rice) and Combo Chow Mein. 

The food was just alright. The combo fried rice tasted a bit stale and for some reason kind of crunchy. I was also expecting the sauce of the chicken katsu to be tonkatsu sauce like it is pictured in their menu but it ended up being this dark sweet and sour type of sauce that was just okay. The best thing for me was the pan fried noodles and the combo chow mein was pretty good as well. Overall, it's a great Chinese food place if you're in the Summerlin area and don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown.

5766138,2016-04-19,0,Cl-xl1vTUwHeaGgBxzdTRA,"First off, be clear that while I have spent over $200 on their food, it has only been delivery, so I cannot comment on atmosphere or in store service.

The quick and dirty review is that i am going to continue to order from this location and highly recommend it!  Fantastic quality food, and in my opinion a very good value.  While they are a bit pricey ($10-$16 each for what I order), the portions are LARGE.  Not stupid large like Hash House a Go Go, just very good sized.

My problem has to do with consistency, which I assume has to do with delivery.  A couple examples:

The first time I ordered i got 3 fortune cookies with the delivery (which seemed appropriate as there were 3 entrees), the second time I got none.  The last few times  I have received 8 or nine.  Certainly not a big deal, but an indicator of consistency and standards.

The first time I ordered Mu Shu Pork they forgot to include the wraps (I ate it with rice and it was absolutely YUMMY).  The second time I ordered Mu Shu pork I asked the person on the phone if I could get 2 extra wraps because I did not receive any the previous time.  He said ok, and when it arrived, I did indeed get the 4 wraps it comes with normally.  But no extra wraps.  And I got charged $1 for the 2 I did not receive, LOL.  BTW, I would have been fine with the $1 charge for 2 extra wraps, as the quantity of Mu Shu Pork is so large it wont fit in 4 wraps!  Just goes back to consistency.  I chalk this one up to language barriers.

On a food note relating to consistency, the first two times I ordered the cashew chicken, the cashews were abundant (way more than I would expect being such a high cost item) and toasted/roasted/fried so they had that lovely buttery flavor with the outsides being just a wee bit black for even more roasted goodness.  This last time a bunch of cashews were thrown on top, right out of the can.  Bummer.  Probably because i ordered within an hour of their closing time.

A couple more food notes for the foodies:

While the Sizzling Rice soup is full of the goodies like shrimp, the broth is way too thin in my opinion.  Perhaps others like it that way?  And I LOVE the presentation of the rice crispies --- they are cut into squares!  Not sure what holds them together, but I guarantee it is not melted marsh-mellow :-)

I am afraid to ask how they do it, but the beef in the Mongolian Beef is tender enough to cut with a fork.

The lettuce wraps were kinda bland,  Perhaps I am just used to the spicey ones I get at other places.  And to be fair, there is nothing on their menu that would even hint that they were going to be spicy.  I simply ASSUMED....BAD BOY!  The roast pine nuts were a very welcome twist though!  I highly recommend this dish BUT!  Like the Mu Shu pork, they give you a very generous portion of food, but only 4 pieces of lettuce, LOL.  I suggest you make sure you have some lettuce in the fridge of your own, because once again, the portion will never fit into the 4 pieces of lettuce.

The Honey Walnut Prawns were not what I expected in the least.  While the prawns were indeed large, and I got 8-10 of them, the House Honey Sauce is a glop of mayonaisey repulsion.  I think they need more work on this one.  The menu makes it sound more like a honey glaze of some kind, but noooooooo.  Sweet mayo does not rank high on my gastronomical delights.  the glazed walnuts could use some work too.  Some were just straight toasted walnuts, glaze not included.

To finish on a good note though, I do recommend at least trying this place.  There is a dearth of decent - good chinese food outside of China Town, and I will continue to explore their menu because they have given me hope of finding some really good items.",UmRVEQPfZ3aHRFLTgI4Z5Q,3,0,3,ZEuMf98wfdB9Fl1-wfDudA

It was nice to have this service offered. So let's get down to the good stuff. My husband ordered the Generals Chicken and steamed rice while I ordered the Orange chicken also with steamed rice. We got a side of wings as well (I wasn't to sure while I was ordering but thought we would give them a try) So we head over to pickup at our scheduled time and the food was already set to go! Awesome! There was a young guy who greeted me and gave me my order. He was very nice and even a little playful. It's great to see happy people while they work. I had pre paid so I walked in and out, super fast, very pleasant and welcoming. When we returned home we were really surprised at how big the portions were. It could have easily fed another couple but since it was just us two we will save for later on (-: our mean was $12.99 because I always order white meat but even then it was totally worth it. There is enough chicken for two and enough rice for two in each meal. We really enjoyed both chickens but my favorite was the orange. As for the hot wings... I don't think I will order those again, they didn't taste bad but just didn't satisfy my taste buds. My husband wasn't a huge fan of them either so we will skip those next time. Overall I still give this place 5 stars because it was generally a great experience. Just because I didn't particularly like the wings doesn't mean someone else won't. We will be eating her again soon and taking my family when they come to visit! Oh yeah when we were checking out online it had a box for coupons and since we spent $30 we got 4 free cans of coke!

I will always rate in 3 categories and the rate I give is the overall rate of the 3 categories. However, it is not average. The 3 categories are: Ambience / Service / Food
1 Star means ""I do not recommend to people I love the most""
2 stars mean ""I do not like it, but some people might""
3 stars mean ""Not consistent, for example, food taste different if I have been more than once""
4 stars mean ""I would like to visit again, but to invite people I love could be risky""
5 stars mean ""I absolutely love it, I would like to visit everyday if I could, I'll bring my wife and it'll be the first restaurant to visit when friends come and visit""

-------------------

Chinese Restaurants are really every where, some are more affordable and some are expensive, a lot of them serve similar type of food, but in general the Chow Mein House was nice.

Ambience
For a restaurant that is not so big, it is well organized, with nice clean white table clothes. Also they do not have that typical Chinese restaurant smell.
****

Service
Many people's experience at a Chinese restaurant service isn't the greatest with dull tone and almost seems like shouting at you, but other than these general experiences, the service here is good. They pay attention on refilling water pretty well, they take the food away from the table to box it up for the remaining food and everything is quick.
****

Food
We ordered Mushu Pork, General Tsao Chicken and Mongolian Beef.
General Tsao Chicken was actually very good. It is kind of food that restaurants can make it salty or sweet, but the fried batter wasn't too thick, sauce was nice and delicious. On the other hand, Mushu Pork and Mongolian Beef was on salty side. Yes general rule of thumb of restaurant is that they cook the food little saltier than dull or less seasoning, but for us it was little too much. Hence we ate a lot of rice and as a result we had to box these two to go.
