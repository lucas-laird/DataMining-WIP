Went to a place down the street but it was so busy, we looked on Yelp for another. GO!KU popped up. Nice clean place and attentive staff. But, maybe it's me. I get grossed out when a server brings you water and grab the top of the glass, where customers drink from. He did bring straws but my friend did drink water without the straw. I use to be a waiter many many years ago and that's one of the things they teach you not to do.  Then we had to ask to get a water refilled. It wasn't busy at all, maybe two other tables. 
So now the food. It was good. Was it the best I've had? No, but it did hit the spot when you have a hangover. I ordered the Ramen with thick noodle and my friend ordered the Ramen with thin noodle. When it came out, they looked the same. Oh well, we're hungry. My friend also ordered tempura shrimp. When he asked for tempura sauce. They said they didn't have any. Mind you he's Japanese. 
Another oh well. 
Overall decent experience. It is clean and the has a cozy feel to it. Food was good but nothing to brag about. Now I wondered how good the other place we left is. Hmmm.",nqj9vqDkcAGRMpJ_8CgyqQ,0,0,3,sMn1SFNmRjyvipvzUZjCXw

WTF?

She didn't agree her fault. And she just said ""If you want I can change with another not salty ramen""

Don't be fooled by the GOKU name, GOKU is also the name of the protagonist in DBZ but the original meaning in Japanese is monkey. Although it's small and kind of hard to find, coming here was so worth it! However, be warned, this is somewhat of a self serve place. The Krazy spicy miso ramen was so spicy and tongue numbing but it still had flavor you'd enjoy from any spicy miso ramen. I believe they had put spinach in the ramen which is something I've never seen before, seeing something new addition was a nice touch. With the j-wrap, the only complaint I have is for the seaweed not being crunchy enough and by attempting to eat it, half of it had fallen out. Besides that, whatever they put on that roll was super yummy! Will definitely be ordering it again. Only giving 4 stars due to the atmosphere, they're probably in the process of designing the place to make it fit the feel of the name but other than that, great place!

Before continuing, leave your expectations at the door. Don't think about sushi or ramen. Coming in you're hit with a very cafeteria-esque, friendly type of feel. The woman in front was warm and friendly. She answered all of our questions and even directed us to the toppings bar.

I ordered the combination: tonkotsu ramen with butter, extra noodles, and 3 rolls. The ramen to me was very home style. Broth got progressively flavorful as you reached the bottom. The heaviness and fattiness wasn't too much of a problem because the bowl was topped with spinach. I liked it because my usual Vegas ramen spots serve ramen that fatigues my senses by the end of the bowl. I could continue eating after the ramen. The rolls were more like wraps. The fish and the rice were okay, but I liked how it used a bit of a saltier seaweed as a wrap. Everything had a good balance.

Wanted ramen after a long day of running errands and having tried ramen for the first time in LA, i was under the delusional impression that everyone makes a mean veggie one! My bubble burst quickly as I pulled up to JINYA, got on the the wait list to realize the wait for one was over an hour because couples get table priority over me. I was starving so I started making calls from Yelp and was 10 deep when I got a hold of these awesome folks. 

Their veggie ramen is plentiful and definitely fills you up. I do wish they were able to add miso paste for more flavor to the veggie ramen but I was told this is only available with their broths that contain pork broth. 

Nevertheless it was good, I don't know if as good as JINYA (haven't had the one out here yet though) but certainly of caliber that I would return for. 

My hostess/waitress was very sweet and asked me not to rush when I was the past patron after close.

We came during off hours so we were the only ones here. The lady was very attentive and since its our first time, she took the time to explain their whole menu and how it works plus their specials.

We all ordered the ramen & j-wrap combo. The J-wraps can come as a whole wrap or cut into generic sushi slices  which comes out to 3 pieces. If you prefer a more basic/blander broth, go with the Tonkatsu Broth. I like more flavor so I went with the Miso flavor. The chasu was very flavorful and yummy though. The ramen comes with spinach, 1/2 soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, nori and a good amount of spinach which I loved! Most places would not include it and have you pay as an extra topping. So this was a plus for me. They have 3 types of noodles you can choose from: thin, thick or the spinach one but cost 50cents extra. We all got the thick noodles which were cooked el dante. Yum!

The J-wraps were not bad. I got it with the A section and got avocado which has cucumber and imitation crab meat in it too. I didn't care too much for the type of nori they wrapped in it as it did have that soggy chewy texture but doesn't bother me too much. Still good. The tuna and salmon appears decently fresh & not too fishy. 

They had the shrimp tempura appetizer special today for $3 (normally $4.99) which came with 4pc. These I would have to say were yummy! Love the batter they used which was not overly battered and perfectly crisp! It came with a sweet/sour dip or tempura sauce but I do have to say the tempura sauce was not the traditional soup like blander sauce. It was closer to saltier soy sauce dip which I didn't care too much for. Also got a green tea ice cream which came in a cone, yay. 

Service was awesome. The lady would come and clean out empty dishes as we ate and checked on us ever so often. Then again, we were the only ones here at this time. Although I won't doubt she is like this regardless. Very sweet lady. Place is clean & lots of condiments to choose from! Parking is also plenty.

The ramen menu is low-priced with a huge portion, and I appreciate how many toppings are included without extra fees: the half egg, the nori, spinach, bamboo, and a slice of charsui. The spicy miso ramen was spicy, but it was also gritty and the spice covered up any flavor depth that the broth might have had. I'd go with a different option next time. The thick noodles were perfectly chewy and the egg was just the right amount of doneness.
The ""J-wraps"" are like uncut maki rolls, handroll-sized and uncut, with different prices for different fillings. The contrast of pairing a fresh fish roll with a hot bowl of soup was surprisingly nice. They also have a couple of special rolls, pricing on par with a sushi counter.

The different salts on the karaage are interesting but the karaage itself just so-so. The same with the takoyaki.

Maybe they used Chinese spicy oil to create the taste, since the top of broth shows the same oily film. That will definitely add salt to the taste. The presentation is very lacking....the spinach were just thrown on top.  I ordered thick noodles which were ok and not overcooked.  Noodle came with one fatty slice of pork.  Nothing special.

My personal bowl of choice is the Krazy Spicy Miso Ramen with Thick Noodles paired with Gyoza, Fries, Fried Chicken Bites, and one Salmon J-Wrap. It is mom and pop run so that's a plus, they really care about their customers and are prompt to roll out the orders as soon as they are ready to eat!

When we walked in we were greeted warmly by the owner. She was so sweet and helpful, making suggestions when we asked and explained the menu. We sat down and, with a very short wait, she delivered two huge bowls of Ramen.

I got the chicken, with the larger noodles and asked for a little spice to be added in, it was perfect! The chicken was tender, the noodles were perfectly cooked as was the egg and spinach. The heat was mild but gave a nice zip. 

The husband ordered the pork Ramen with the smaller noodles and it may have been tastier than mine! The broth had a rich, deep flavor.

Lady working there was super nice! Checked on us a good amount, but didn't bug us. Even chatted up a funny conversation. 

The price is worth it. My cousin got tonkatsu combo 1 with an oshinko j wrap for 9.99 plus tax. I ended up getting spicy miso combo 2 with a kalbi j wrap and a spicy tuna wrap for around 16 cause it's extra for certain wraps but 11.99 for ramen and 2 regular wraps. 

Spicy tuna wrap was okay, wasn't really expecting too much from it. The kalbi wrap surprised me. Like another yelper said, the kalbi was cold, but it tasted pretty good. Shocked at the flavor combo of it. I need to go back to see what was in it. (Couldn't take pics, old phone camera wasn't taking clear ones)
I got the spicy miso soup crazy spicy, (like Mindy B. said) ""good thing she put the crazy sauce on the side"" because it had a kick and was sticky, like syrup sticky. I put a little bit in my ramen and I LOVED IT! If you are trying to kick some sinus butt, get it. I wanted to take some of the crazy spicy sauce home and put it on everything. The soup for me was something else. For the first time, I actually wanted to finish the broth. I never try to cause I'm ""trying"" to be somewhat healthy, but couldn't resist. 

My cousin would have gave it a 3.75 star rating if he was going to do a review, but I've decided differently.

Go!Ku was formerly Misoya, but when they renovated the establishment about three weeks ago from today (1/14/2017), they decided to change the name. However, one of the employees told us their flavors and style of cooking haven't changed, even though their menu has been updated.

Staff was very friendly and helpful. One of the workers kept coming back to our table to make sure everything was ok. She even gave my fam updated stamp cards and told us she'll combine the old ones if we still have them! So sweet :]

When you put spinach in the ramen, I'm always hesitant to trust the dish, but the broth was strong and outstanding and the noodles, both thin and thick, were some of the best in town.  The spicy sauce, for an additional $1.50, is well worth the charge if you're a fan of heat.  This ketchup-like substance is chili oil to the max and will wake you and your mouth up for sure.  The chasu and tofu knock Goku down for me.  The meat is more like a pork chop than chasu - well overcooked.  The tofu on the other hand, just tasted basic and bland.  Still, seems like a very nice place for lunch and they have sake deals virtually everyday.  Goku is a fine spot for a cup of ramen and you can't go wrong with chicken or pork broth.  Cheaper than other spots in town with the typical bowl coming in at $8ish with the usual meat, egg, bamboo shoot included.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,EyBCRJmgQkAEHedz2wsZ8Q
3352543,2018-03-02,0,mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg,"Tried this place for lunch and the ramen was decent. Not the best I've had, but not the worst. I chose Tonkatsu style with thin noodles (they have thin, thick, and spinach noodles). The noodles were cooked nicely and the broth was not too salty. I like that they gave lots of spinach and was not stingy with the charsiu, but it's a different case with the seaweed paper. They literally gave me only half of a seaweed paper lol. The ramen was $8, so the pricing was not bad. I made it a combo by adding a salmon roll for $3 extra. I wasn't a huge fan of the roll, so don't think I'd order it again. They do have other add-ons you can choose for your combo such as gyoza, karaage chicken, and other varieties of sushi rolls. Add-ons start at $2.50.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,1,0,3,XTL5-eF2KFNmtDU-bs5Wgw

Had to bookmark and check new spot right away. I starved most of the day so I can come at night and order away. Very spacious inside and parking available outside. 

I ordered the combo 1 (9.99$) and combo 2 (11.99). Both orders were tonkotsu with everything. The combos will come with J-wraps but I addeded more $ to pick the higher tier choice like eel, rib eye and the spicy tuna. Service was superb, lady helped us order super quick, considering it's my first time here. 

Our orders came out very quick, sadly they mixed the thin and thicker noodles up with our orders. And the j rolls are delivered to your table. The tonkotsu broth wasn't very impressing. It didn't have a wow affect on me. 
The jwraps are served cold but even the rib eye are served cold, pretty awkward. 

Overall i like this new ramen shop. I would come back if the portions were bigger for that price. Finished my bowl in minutes from starting. Definitely if you have read my whole review it's up to you if you want to try it.

A good option if your craving for ramen without the wait times that are common at other places. They offer 4 styles of Ramen; Tonkatsu, Chicken, Miso and my personal favorite the Spicy Miso flavor. You have the option of thin or thick noodles and includes a descent amount of toppings with the option of adding on. 

They also offer various combo meals that include J-Wraps aka Maki Rolls wrap in Nori, that are refreshing and gives a kick to your standard ramen. Overall a cool counter-service option that is good and quick.

3826085,2017-08-11,0,mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg,"This review is LONG overdue!! 

I absolutely adore this place! It's cozy and you're always greeted with a smile and a how are you! The owners are SO delightful. Sometimes there is a wait here because of how busy it can get but if you're willing to wait you won't be disappointed. 

There are times when you crave sushi. Not enough for AYCE but just enough that a roll or to will suffice. This place calms that craving for me. That's actually how I discovered this wonderful gem. I wanted a simple roll of sushi and I definitely found it here! 

You can order j-wraps which are sushi rolls in a combo of 3 or 5. Or choose from their already selected combos AND get ramen along with a wrap. My boyfriend and I enjoy both. I can just eat the rolls itself and give him the ramen and we both are satisfied. 

They've recently changed their menu up a bit and to be honest I'd say it was for the better. I LOVED their menu to begin with but now there's more of a selection; new rolls were added different choices of fried rice, poke or salmon bowls and this new Matcha parfait that I can't wait to try. 

Ramen:
-I've ALWAYS ordered their Spicy Miso and that has always been delicious. Just tried their Original flavor and that was great as well. The amount of toppings and the size of the pork chashu is perfect. You have a choice of thin or thick noodles. I always opt for thick :)

J-Wraps!:
-I can't tell you how many times I've came in here just for these. There's a variety of rolls you can choose from and their cut into 3 pieces. My favorite 3 are eel, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. 

Specialty Rolls:

Crazy Spicy Salmon has to be my favorite. 99% of the time I order this with my order. It's not on the menu as it was a special on display before but this is a must try if you love spicy food. When I even think of this roll,...my mouth waters lol. Yea.. that sure is crazy huh!

Salmon skin roll, soft shell crab, all around the world roll and Dragon roll is very good as well.

4061563,2018-02-14,1,mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg,"I'm reviewing as a big fan of their lunch specials from 10:30 AM to 3 PM..

Go!ku Service:  We were greeted and seated immediately upon entrance.  We ordered 4 lunch specials, hot green tea and everything came out quickly.  Waters and the tea pot were kept fresh the whole time. Excellent

Go!ku Lunch Special: I went with the Spicy Red Miso (Big Noodles) added the Chasu Chicken Bowl, and it came with a salad.  The salad was fresh with lots of Spinach and the Chasu Chicken bowl was small in size but pretty big in taste.  The Spicy Red Miso pork broth was tasty and deceivingly spicy.  It was not uncomfortable to eat, but I was sweating slightly, excellent. The ""Big Noodles"" are made of egg and was fresh and prepped well.  I wish they were a little more generous with the pork chashu but it was flavorsome.  Overall, they Ramen bowl was put together well, filling and appetizing.

Go!ku ambiance:    On one wall, there's a handwritten calendar with their specials for the month.  On another wall, is a peg board with handwritten notes in the shape of a hand that were written by the customers. They have a small cafe vibe that almost feels like a mom and pop coffee shop with the personable decorations.  I dig it..

The Ramen bowls and lunch special offered great value for me in terms of price and the flavory food.  It's now a great lunch option and I'll probably be back to try more Ramen, sushi and other dishes.  But that's another Yelp tale, enjoy!  =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,4,3,4,FrB7xh3YzoyQRbvz-ShepA

We came in around 9pm and was told that they were backed up with their orders. But there were only about 8 people, so I'm not sure how that's possible. They also said that they were running out of rice, so they could only serve 4 rolls total for our 4 person group. Kind of strange for a restaurant that specializes in ramen and rolls to be backed up or run out of stuff only 1.5 hours before closing.

However, the staff were extremely nice to us. I really liked the cashier because he was apologetic and understanding of our situation. The, I think, owner was so nice. She checked up on us to make sure we were doing well and offered us extra condiments. She even brought us water even though the water was self serve.

The tonkatsu broth itself was really good. It was a good amount of saltiness and warmth (not too piping hot but warm enough to warm the soul). The pork slice was THICK, which was nice. Overall, pretty tasty. And for the price ($8-9), it was worth it.

We proceeded to sit down at two tables on the right side (from the entrance).  The place was empty.  They had a couple with a toddler sitting and eating and another couple at the register about to order.  Then a woman comes towards us and asks how many of us were there.  We responded 7 and a baby.  She then went to the couple who were ordering to ask them where they wanted to sit.  The couple said they wanted to sit at a lower seat rather than the bar top seating they had in the middle of the room.  When I heard this, I told the woman worker that we had children with us and we could not sit up that high.  She told us that the couple at the register wanted to sit here (where we were already sitting at this point) and I said ""okay so what do you want us to do?""  She said ""is that okay?"" Well no it's not okay but what do you want us to do about it?!  I noticed there was a room available so I asked if we could sit in there then.  She went back to the kitchen to ask someone and came back and said it was an office and they couldn't seat us there.  So we started gathering up our children and was ready to leave and she asked again ""is that okay?"".  I responded, ""no, but what can we do.  You can ask the other couple to sit there at the bar top since they are physically capable of and we could sit here, but you didn't do that."" So, we walked out and left.  

At this restaurant, you order and sit down, so why did this woman employee even ask the couple at the register if it was okay for us to sit there, especially when we had already sat down.

My poke bowl looked nice, kinda less... but I was hoping the taste make up for the portion. It did not. The tuna was really fishy.... My friend joked that maybe the server was sniffing my food to see if the fish was still good. Overall, I did not enjoy my poke bowl. I had better poke bowl before and I believe this is my worst one. The fish was probably not fresh? The poke bowl did not have all the ingredient that was listed on the menu. I did not get any sesame seed, omelet and cucumber. But my friends did enjoy their ramen.

The lady working behind the counter was extremely courteous and polite! I came in on Friday for lunch with a group of 6 and surprisingly we were the only party. The menu is just a tiny bit confusing, but she makes sure you understand it. Ask her what her favorite is!

I recommend getting thick noodle versus thin as the thick noodle has a good bite to it. All bowls come with standard toppings which are listed on the menu. The (tonkotsu) broth was nice and crisp; not as heavy as other places. I LOVE the bamboo shoots--very crunchy! The sushi is a pretty good size. Don't expect a typical sushi roll you get from AYCE.

Naturally I turned to Yelp to guide us to our destination. This place sold us based on the great reviews and the fact we could get sushi as well. Sweet!

We took a fairly quick Lyft ride off the strip and headed to a plaza close to some of my other fave Asian restaurants in Vegas. The restaurant is small and we got there just before the lunch rush began. They had a board up with daily specials and they even have free wifi.

They have great combo deals if you are interested in something more than ramen. We ended up doing an order of gyoza, 2 ramens and 3 sushi j wraps. The fried gyoza was good- freshly fried and presented with 2 dipping sauces (a ponzu and sweet thai chili sauce, I believe). We ate those so quickly because we were so hungry that I forgot to snap a pic. My ramen was the spicy red miso ramen with added bean sprouts and fried garlic. Pretty damn tasty. My friend ordered the Vegas style miso ramen but they accidentally brought her the veggie lovers ramen. She didnt make a fuss and ate it. The sushi j wraps were good. They were larger than rolls are other sushi places so we accidentally ordered more than we could eat. 

Overall we had a great dining experience. I encourage all tourists to take an opportunity to dine off the strip at least once during their visit. They are missing out on gems like this place if they dont!",zn49uoRL-KTsuvzdn47iCA,0,0,4,kijOcW2_3Nfoqi_LYD1xjg

Goku is a bit overhyped and overrated. I tried their Original and a Jwrap. Their broth is pretty flavorful, although nothing too special or memorable (unlike Toto Ramen in NY). Had the thick noodles and the texture was good. Their meat was what bothered me. It was a big chunk of meat, not thinly cut, and very little taste. The second time I came, there was a piece of hair in my broth...I told the waitress after having to flag her down and she showed the cook, and then she came back and asked if I wanted to keep my noodles and just change the broth or get a new bowl. I opted to get a new bowl, but that just ruined the experience. I still paid for it (they didn't offer to take it off the bill). The Jwraps are a twist from traditional sushi. A bit too much rice in those wraps for me. Overall, the service from this Chinese young lady was awful.",_c5k8C6aB8fOG5hRMpJYBQ,0,0,2,uv9VynJos_kt_ElfM0piaQ

Either the portion sizes are too small or they don't give you enough meat or side items to make it a meal.  Well this place solved all my problems. 

The deluxe goku is the game changer.  Large portion size,  2 pieces of chasu pork big enough to be used in another bowl of ramen if they really wanted to, one full egg, and a generous portion of the noodle of your choice (thin,  thick,  spinach). 

The food was delicious and definitely hit the spot during a cold windy day.  They do offer combos if you want some sushi rolls or gyoza with your noodles for those with huge appetites.  One thing I would suggest is to offer a more spicy version of the ramen.  I had the spicy miso that was not spicy at all.  Not even a tinge of spice on the tongue.  I want something that would scorch my taste buds.  Just some food for thought . I'll definitely be back",-PzjjXcXBCYyMUi69GF0Eg,1,0,5,47xcbYBDgDUWnu8MXggKUg

I drank all my soup too. It wasn't oily or too creamy tasting. The spinach also balanced out the flavors. The pork in the bowl was also different from other ramen shops.

-Tonkatsu ramen was amazing. At under $8 which includes a poached egg, pork and fixings this is the best budget ramen joint. I dare say its on par with Ippudo. The broth was flavorful, the thick noodles were plentiful. The best part is the pork. The first ramen joint where the pork isn't dry or tough. I'm overly impressed with how generous the cut was too. Go!ku definitely doesn't skimp
-Check in for free ice cream. We weren't given a choice as to which flavor. We were given mango and that was good.
-Salmon Skin J-wrap comes in 3 pieces. It has good taste and equivalent in price to a regular sushi roll.",WPl2gULxrrh_GoypMzHF-A,2,2,5,77THTsewaookVFd96mbB6w
5798909,2017-11-11,0,mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg,I've been a long time customer. This was the first time I've come in since the renovation. It looks great inside. They're definitely updating their look. They now offer sushi amongst other things other than ramen. Food is still great! Still my go to spot .,BM4DjBb7G9jOCGNcTXTTSQ,0,0,5,shmkBQLIpT9bweGeMdOZUQ

5836797,2017-08-25,0,mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg,"This used to be under another name, but also ramen. Good... but not on the same level as Monta and Ramen Sora. Service and interior were all nice and clean. Tried a few appetizers that were also good, but again, the ramen I will be going back for will be at the usual places. The broth here was as if it were watered down and yet oily at the same time? It lacked the thick cloudiness of real bone broth boiled long hours. I also felt like my mouth was pretty dry and thirsty afterwards. Either too much salt or MSG?",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,3,NhPWURxcY-Sl_6W68t1RUA

5908567,2017-04-12,0,mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg,"This is a decent new spot for ramen noodles, particularly for the value. I got a spicy miso bowl with a salmon roll for about $12. Tasty bowl, decent size, but a little light on the pork. The roll was kind of an afterthought. Not amazing, but was nice to get a touch of sushi for not a lot more. 

Service was mixed. There were only 2 employees working, including the girl at the front who was MIA often to help assemble some food in the back. Not her fault (she was very courteous), but you can't open a restaurant with only 2 people on the clock. She had a number of take out orders in progress and a table of 8 to serve. Seemed to take forever to order, but after that, the food came out quicker than I expected. Took 20 min to order and 15 min to eat.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,4,_GRKUUJPEC4U3dKYeoU1hg

Service SUCKED!  There were 2 tables occupying restaurant when we go there but they made us sign our name and wait for 5 minutes before they sat us.  Then another 20 minutes before taking our order even after I told her were knew what we wanted.  We accidentally spilled water.  She gave us the stink eye and didn't even give us another glass.  

Have to say though, soup base was very good.",Jm_YkweWzUUpf0Pb9qyZDg,0,0,3,EiGj_oCkC-IVIF0kZBUaqw

I put a coke can next to it to show the size it's still on Secret menu, you can get it before it's on the regular menu now",jJDEwznWHQIaT4Z0lIFl5A,3,4,5,CV_q0i6BRAE1lLcx-0Esnw
5990085,2017-02-20,0,mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg,"The person behind the counter was very nice. They have combo deals starting at $9.99 which includes a bowl of ramen and a sushi roll. The spicy tuna was a 50 cent upgrade but worth it to me. You can even choose what type of noodles you want, thick or thin. I also ordered the chicken karaage. I like that you can choose how many pieces you want. They also have different seasoning salts you can add. 
They have a self serve lemon and lime infused water and hot water. I can't believe the place was empty. I definitely recommend people to try here.",e2rUTql6lISqqir-uyS8_g,0,0,5,pVK-Bu2EgGByckDv4pO2oQ
