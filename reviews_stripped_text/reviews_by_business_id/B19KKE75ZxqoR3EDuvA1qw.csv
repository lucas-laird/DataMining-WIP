29003,2017-03-11,0,B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw,Cheap place to stop by and grab something to eat. Food is whatever. Stir fry was nasty.  Sushi was great. Workers are nice and don't neglect you.  But the short Asian lady messed up my drink order then got an attitude when I requested the right drink. But for 6.49$ can't beat it,skrp6wGLbqkdxz79nPZYbg,0,0,3,LSiES6bqR7iEo8ok55SDAg
170079,2015-05-12,1,B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw,The restaurant looked kind of dirty except the tables...not astetically pleasing...Walls were dirty lighting really funky...Not much variety in foods either....some of it not labled at all. ...Couldn't find the cocktail sause for the fried shrimp. ... And who in the right mind boils shrimp then stir fries it with the shell on it? That's complete laziness...you don't eat the shell stupid . The soft serve ice cream had a nasty taste to it like the machine hasn't been cleaned. Never got refills on drinks...they never asked,QmSGpPRyCjYfncPeoQ2MwA,2,0,1,EnaJQmCIrolR1-KgL8dFkg

She pointed to the wall. but she didn't tell me that my drink was extra. The guy serving my table made it seem like my drink was included and refilled my drink. Anyway, upon leaving my checkout bill was at $12.00 which is laughable. I have no problem paying for what I owe. But this place is a cesspool of bacteria. The place needs to be cleaned. Also, the lady at the counter had no customer service skills and the guy who said his uncle owned the place was just as rude. So I wont be going here again. They need to close down and get the place cleaned. I don't expect a bargain place to be decorated like the strip hotels, but water goes a long way. Clean up the filth guys. A dinning room needs to be sanitary and the food need to be the right temperature. Ewww  bugs wouldn't eat here. It just seems that everything was out of cans. And loaded with salt and oil.

612149,2014-02-12,0,B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw,"Short: Pass on it, go to Krazy Buffet or any other place. Sub-average food, bad service, terrible atmosphere.

I dropped by here because I felt a little tired of the other asian buffets I visit, and it was in the neighborhood. $6.48 for lunch for one. I walked in and was sat down promptly, but that was about it for service other than plate pick up. Crappy decorations--a staple of low-scale asian buffets--but absolutely no music playing to drown out the coughing, children's cries and random conversation. It felt like I was eating in a run-down restaurant on the side of a highway.
Food was cooked at least.... It's the typical spread you'll see at any other buffet, just not as good. All sauces were watered down to the point that one tasted like all the others. I'd guess that half of the selection of ""hot"" food was previously frozen, and the other half showed that it wasn't made very well. Half of the buffet is made up of soups, the worse of deserts, fruit and a pretty bad ""Mongolian BBQ"" side-bar. I wasn't tempted to try the sushi--though I typically risk it.


Bottom line: If you've been to an asian buffet before, this place will disappoint you. It's one of the worse I've been to, and I see no reason why someone should go here when there's a dozen others that are better in this city.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,1,0,2,Vg5ZNRxljdzY27dFMDyXUw

The entry inside the restaurant was full of their dead bodies.  The inside was never very clean looking and I often questioned the looks of the kitchen.   Needless to say, I've never been back nor did my appetite get restored that day.  It made me wonder if I was a star on that show ""Bizzare Foods with Andrew Zimmern"".  God help me.  The staff was never very friendly or clean looking and the carpet was full of grease stains and if you weren't carefull, you would slip on the floor covered in grease.  So as soon as we discovered the millions of dead cockroaches, we made an about face and left.  We went to Applebees next door but I didn't end up eating lunch that day.  Everything on the menu looked like a cockroach to me.  China Star needs a serious overhaul to make that place up to snuff.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had a rodent problem as well.

But wait....I paid what for this? 
In that case I'm getting what I paid for, this is how cheap food should look like so I might as well get my money's worth, and one serving of something that you like would put you there. Just like when you go to the Salvation Army  store, you just have to look around before you find something you like  and that is how I ended up with that sweet walnut shrimp that it was to die for. (not literally, I hope)
   Although they have a decent selection most of the stuff looked like it had been sitting there for too long, life had been taken out of it  more than once, I could even guess they get all their sea food all the way from the Dead Sea and nothing was ever really alive.
 There's nothing special about the decor of the place, just the basic booths tables and chairs to keep up with the theme of  cheap and tasteless. If nice and modern is what you looking for, Panda Express does it better ..but is more expensive of course.
  At the end I think this place is ok. You get what you pay for and is a good alternative for when you're broke or want to take a date that you don't really want to see again.

There was feces on the walls in the bathroom stalls of the women's restroom, overflowing wastebin and the supplies were not stocked, so obviously that means no one had been in there to tidy up in a while.

My partner and I despite having brought our lunches, thought we would venture out.  Never in our wildest dreams thinking we would drive done this culinary road to finally answer the questions, or better yet MEET the CHALLENGE off a totally random, off road lunch adventure.

With our first, second, and third choices socked in with the middle of the week lunch crowd, we ended up in the parking lot of China Star.

After breaching the front door, we were received happily enough.  I immediately took in the rows of standard Chinese buffet fare that lay before me.  Looked tasty enough......cheap enough.

We were seated next to a real life looking equivalent of some Marvel comic super villain, as he devoured his plate.  Many a dead plate lay before him, slaughtered and empty.  

While waiting for our drink order, it was then we decided to check-in on yelp and begin reading the reviews.  Some terrifying, others raving...it seemed the odds of not contracting an intestinal virus were in our favor.

With drink order made (Pepsi products) even though I ordered a Coke, we were off to see what awaited us.

Initially, all but a few trays were either full or half full. My first plate was full of coconut chicken, chicken skewers, General Tso chicken, Dynamite, Crab Rangoon, Lo Mein, and a few pizza slices thrown in for good measure.

While dining my partner and I constantly evaluated every entree and eventually settled on a solid Three Star Experience........This would eventually change.

Heading off for the second plate, I immediately noticed all but a few trays were totally empty.  I wandered around waiting and hoping they would be filled again soon.  But alas, this was not to be.  Every employee I locked eyes with attempting to plea for the trays refill, went ignored.  I picked through whatever I could find, resenting I was...as was everyone else......CUT OFF.  AFTER ONE PLATE!?  The partner and I thought this was absolutely a one star reduction.

All I can say, is what I did consume, I found tasty and it did not hold me hostage for the remainder of the day in the restroom.  I also felt a sense of satisfaction knowing what is at the end of the unknown road, I have passed a thousand times.  There is no need to go down it again.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,9,5,2,udX6caM4QZFsOPqH0NFEmQ

We don't eat the other stuff they serve on the buffet because it's all nasty and when you think about everything there is nasty. If your restroom smells like bad urine (disgusting) and it's next to the kitchen you would think they can try and have it cleaned  or even spray air freshener maybe even crack the back door open But that just tells you they don't care. Slice mushrooms for the grill are not wash guaranteed if you go just look at it.. it never fails lol. I will never be going here again also due to the little lady that has a mouth piece I felt she was being really rude talking in her language something bout Togo box and 2 soup cups make sure they get soup I'm guessing lol they had the nerves to come to me and touch my Togo box I had already paid for and explained to me that the box needs to closed. No sh*t! This is not my first rodeo.. she seen me plenty of times I'm not no greedy b*#%h.  But in front of customers you want to make a scene and embarrass me with your loud fob talking.. FYI I don't tolerate bs I know how I am and how I get.. So I decided to get back my hard earned money and left. Something told me to calm down and walk out nicely (I was going to act a fool) lucky I did because as I was coming out police roll thru parking lot... I was really trying hard not to slap the s&@? out of her I can see the fear in her eyes she got me f@&ked up. Went to Buffet Asia paid a little more which was fine food was great and I had better choices fresh and clean worth my $20 all day! Oh
And customer service was on point! Every staff there was happy and smiling.. best of luck to who ever likes china star thumbs down.. don't spend your hard earn money at this bs place and people who don't appreciate there customers and be littles a person.... spend your money wisely just please not here. We of all people should not support this business! If you have a few extra bucks is wise to spend it else where that appreciates your business!

 Upon entering, the atmosphere was nothing like the China Star on Maryland and not very inviting at all. I cant put a finger on it exactly and am in no mood to disect it at this time.

As usual, I arrived around 3pm still making it for lunch. The kitchen is visible through open glass & while I didnt inspect it or pay much attention to it, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. However, when I went to get some sushi, which is adjacent to the kitchen, the girl making it was giving me this look. I just looked back at her and said ""DAMAGE INCORPORATED"" taking a big plate of rolls. The ""seafood salad"" that I accompay my sushi with looked like it was opened from its container and placed in the bowl = no mayo and no attempt at all to cut it up or add ingredients to it. In hindsight THIS sets off some alarm bells for me.

The sushi was nothing special and the wasabi had a soup-like consistency to it. In addition to this, they offer your normal chinese fare and the stand out was the Coconut Chicken which instead of being all batter was ""all chicken"" in a light to medium batter and very good. The spicy chicken was just plain weird = orange, dry & not spicey at all. Everything else seemed normal and standard.

 As far as the service goes, they seemed freindly enough & I realize I get to these places when the help is having thier lunch and they have to eat too, but I still had to get up and ask for a water refill and that is NBD to me at all under the circumstances.

Overall it was what it is for the &6.50 price & that would have been the end of it and I wish it was. I would have done this review ending it here saying: ""It was ok but I wont go out of my way to return there as there are way better places as far as quality and more offerings like shrimp etc. for the same price"" and given it  2 stars.

But THAT wasnt the end of it as something followed me home and ""sat"" on my stomach giving me a queezy feeling all night. Then in the morning I woke with a fever and not feeling good at all and after trying to swallow a sip of my morning coffee began to puke my guts out. I was GLAD to get whatever it was that was making me sick out of my body!! I barely made it into work and the whole day I was lethargic and C0-workers could tell I was under the weather and not my normal self (which they all probably enjoyed!! LOL). I didnt eat anything until late in the day & it was a small yogurt and forced at that.

My guess is that somewhere along the line, as presented with the seafood salad, someone cut corners and compromised some raw food or something. All I can say is based on my own experience is ""BEWARE eating at this place"". I'm writing this 2 days after the fact & I still have no appitite due to the above outlined experience.

If anything positive I can take away from this and pass on to the reader is:

3236201,2014-09-14,0,B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw,"This restaurant reminds me of some of the typical buffet style Chop Suey houses we had in Honolulu back in 1980's. Though, the style of traditional Chinese menu items have change and become more Americanized since.

From the aroma as you walk in, the noise of all the restaurant patrons present, to the hustling servers, the atmosphere altogether is chaotic and amusing at the same time, and I like a little chaos.

The food encompasses many popular asian particulars and a wonderful selection of seafood fare. There is also a made to order stir fry chef for those who would like exclusive specialty dishes.

The dessert bar is simple maintaining a variety of ethnic pastries, cookies, fruit and jello molds.

For you soup lovers, there's a vareity of four options,  focusing on the more popular ones often typical in any American Chinese menu.

Good food, perfect for family or friends to gather and enjoy some easy ready chinese or American fare, definitely stop by.

If I was to recommend anything from the buffet line-here are my fave picks:

Char Sui Roasted Pork
Chicken Wings
Mongolian beef,
Pan fried pot stickers (Gyoza)

Take advantage of the stir fry specialties where the chefs will cook it on the spot!

For less than seven bucks you can't go wrong. It is what it is. Low cost, mediocre food in enormous quantities is what you are anticipating, right?

There was literally no wait and we were seated immediately. That's about where three stars ends and two stars begins. There was no broccoli beef, but a small amount of broccoli chicken. They did offer both egg rolls and spring rolls with some of the hottest mustard I've ever had. The cheese wontons were surprisingly good, as were the BBQ pork skewers. Well, the one skewer that was left anyway. We never saw another skewer and were there close to an hour.

I wasn't expecting top shelf dining at a Chinese buffet.  However, I was expecting to eat as much as I wanted. How can you when they don't have any food out? It was as if they were getting ready to close and didn't want to put out more food. This was 12:30 in the afternoon. It's lunch time for crying out loud and we are hungry. 

The service was decent, as was the food we could actually get ahold of. I have to go with two stars for the simple fact that a buffet should have food or at least make an effort to fill it up when it runs empty. Save yourself the two dollars and drink water, as the price does not include a beverage.

* A handful of superb dishes: coconut chicken, seafood rockefeller, fried chicken, all of the soups, black pepper chicken.

Upon entering you will find the host station to your right. IF you make a u-turn to your immediate right that is.

The staff was polite, I think. Most of the staff mumbled towards me wife and myself.

Food was okay depending on what you had. I love mongolian bbq and this time it didn't disapoint. Except for the order I put the hot asian sauce on. Just a tad too much. But that is my fault.

I also tried what was labled as ""black pepper chicken"". I took a few bites and the few that I took, each one was of cold food. 

What really is the cause for my low number of stars for this place is the cleanliness. 

The wife noticed ""dust bunnies"" along the ceiling fans. The kitchen had different style and patterened floor tiles. But what I type next is what really bothered my wife.

Near the kitchen, is a door frame with a ""blanket"" of sorts hanging in place of a proper door. The ""blanket"" looked to be quite dirty. Made my wife wonder when the last time it was properly washed.

Two people who work for China Star, were seen seated at a dining room table near the kitchen. The folks were seen snapping what appeared to be green beans without gloves on their hands. These two same people were seen serving guests, taking orders and such. Never were they seen leaving the dining room area to wash their hands.

Sorry China Star but I must say, in closing, what my wife and I once thought as a bright and shinning star, has becoming a falling star.",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,0,0,2,rs2eAur1inmLwDyQUZQWUQ

Yes, it's a super cheap lunch for around $5-6 but remember...you get what you pay for sometimes.  At this China Star it's not much.  The food is decent and you won't have any problems if you've got a strong stomach like I do.  There are your usual dishes like the fried rice, noodles, fried chicken wings, beef and broccoli, and won ton soup.  But I just feel it's all on lower standards.  A lot of the stuff on the day I went was definitely sitting under the heat lamp for a bit, causing a lot of items to be surrounded by a pool of grease.  Ever see coconut chicken after a long bath under a heat lamp?  Trust me you don't want to.  Things tasted rubbery and lackluster.  Soup was cold and the faux sushi was warm.  Wow, and I'm not usually very picky when it comes to eating!  Sad food make me a sad boy.

I'm not usually too critical of the atmosphere either since I've been to dives that were dingy but had good food.  But this China Star over here on Charleston?  It is a bit dirtier than I can accept.  Food bits stuck here and there on the floor, having to clear particles off your seat before you sit down, and sneeze guards looking a little bit questionable?  Aw, come on!  I like my beats fast and my bass down low, but the only thing I like dirty (occasionally) is my lady!  Going to the bathroom is a great gauge on how to tell if a place is clean.  Trust me, going to the bathroom here (which I did) may make you queasy!  There was a roach running around in there.  I tried to ignore it....but yeah, it was still there.  I said hello to it, but it just scurried along its way...probably going back to the kitchen to grab a smoke.  Ack!  I really feel sorry for the ladies that have to actually sit on the seat in the women's restroom.   

There's not much else I can say about this place for now, I'm getting a bit light-headed thinking about it.  Please, please, please China Star...clean your act up!

While I was attempting to have a relaxing dinner the staff was FIGHTING LOUDLY & would not stop. I had enough & walked out. VERY unprofessional. I WILL NOT go back.,kzrCTiMxXSkZ_kmxJLrypg,1,0,2,i5cM6td3vemWmOnW2w2aTQ
