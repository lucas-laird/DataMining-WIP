Chicken sandwich was soggy and microwaved. Servers were unprofessional and yelling at each other. Just won't go back here again",9Wj94NnM-duwxGOgMUqYnw,0,0,2,W6GIgIi2nQqGnZXmBFW9Hg
2250176,2016-10-21,0,o9thrb4UrI4NJ6CGOAXb5g,Order the smokehouse brisket combo. When I got home they put in a French dip sandwich and forgot my curly fries. This is the second time Arby's messed up the order and they were two different locations. Upsetting because the food is good but service is terrible.,-ze5cMOUne0362Ja-t6ZSQ,0,0,2,aBbAitxdEK-7VehUMZHdDA
2520942,2016-02-04,6,o9thrb4UrI4NJ6CGOAXb5g,"Again, general fast food rules apply here for me once again, no fast food restaurant can receive five stars, there's just no way the food can be of quality enough to warrant five stars. That's my rating philosophy, it is what it is. 

For starters, considering the area this restaurant is in, it is definitely incredibly clean and well kept for a fast food restaurant. Many others in the area are nothing short of disgusting, so I was pleasantly surprised to see this. There was a guy there doing maintenance when I was there too, so someone clearly makes sure this place stays in good shape. 

The staff were attentive, not particularly friendly though. No one smiled. No one was necessarily rude, but the two employees I interacted with were just rather flat. 

The food wait was a bit long. After ordering it took about 5 minutes for my food to be called out, despite the fact that I saw it ready the entire time I was waiting. They were a little busy and a little understaffed, so this may have been why. 

Food itself was typical for Arby's. Not mind blowing, but decent. Huge homestyle fan myself, but not going to lie, I get excited when a few curly fries accidentally sneak in the fry box. I'd come back to this location if I was in the area.

Arby's... my favorite place for fast food.
I love a good roast beef sandwich from Arby's.
Today I went to the one located on East Tropicana Avenue in Las Vegas.
Service was slow for my taste. 
I was a bit extra hungry so I ordered a regular roast beef sandwich meal with curly fries and a drink. I also ordered a junior size roast beef sandwich.
I got my order to go, as I was headed in to work for the day. 
I sat at my desk, reached into the bag and grabbed the ""Jr Roast Beef Sandwich"". Even for a ""Jr"" sized sandwich, I almost immediately said ""WHERE'S THE BEEF?""",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,0,0,2,Y7a6mCJikghpJFgw_D9IYA

3895026,2016-07-16,0,o9thrb4UrI4NJ6CGOAXb5g,Horrible service my first time ever going to an Arby's I was so disappointed they took for ever to get our order and they didn't even know what we ordered we had to tell them again they don't communicate with each other. Both girls were rude. They didn't know the menu. Will never have this again EVER!!,6_AugSHouBMud2ngS-RoqQ,0,0,1,YaVNLYxTrZOa-k6P-8fhig
4704012,2016-06-20,0,o9thrb4UrI4NJ6CGOAXb5g,"So Arby's has some classics but as far as quality goes I think most of us can agree, it has gone somewhat down hill over the years; however sometimes you just crave it. 

There are some certain specials I will stop by Arby's for and this one is near my house. The food is not bad and the fact that it seems to take long in the drive-thru I am OK with because I am hoping that means it is fresh! 

Uggg-the employees tho: No matter how nice I am, there is NO trace of happiness in their voice. I actually leave feeling bad for them like 'why do they hate their job and/or life so much?"". It's all mono-tone and almost like 'here, take your food and go.."". 
I don't go looking for cheerful employees I guess, I go for the food and I know working in fast food can suck but there are a lot worse places to work in the world. 
Maybe Arby's needs a better work environment.",P7Qt34VblZupUifRJ_5hbA,0,0,3,YnpFg-WgjxumY8pfbhQRIg
4728100,2015-10-17,1,o9thrb4UrI4NJ6CGOAXb5g,This location provides horrible service! I waited in the drive through for over six-seven minutes even though there was only one other car ahead of me. My food was cold (especially the curly fries) leading me to believe that they had prepared my food and then left it sitting while they prepared the order for the car ahead of me.
