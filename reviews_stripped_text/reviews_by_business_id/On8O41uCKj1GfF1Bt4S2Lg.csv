Being a New Yorker, I am often PISSED when I see the Sonic Commercials and then realize the closest one is an hour and a half drive from my house.  This means that when I have the opportunity to go to a Sonic, I do it.

This was the 4th Sonic I've ever visited (I went to one in NJ, PA, and Austin, TX before).  This was probably the worst one I've been to. Don't get me wrong, if you like Sonic you'll like this one, but it was subpar compared to the other ones.

The Texas Bacon Cheeseburger and Frito Chile Cheese Wrap were great, as usual. The onion rings tasted weird and were disappointing (I had them in Jersey a couple of months ago and they were excellent).  

Also, the people who work here aren't the brightest bulbs in the lamp.  I ordered a #5 with a frito chili cheese wrap and a diet coke and took them forever to figure out what was up.",sBa-YOrYCNlURx7U2PbbZw,1,1,4,BVFOyYiYHbFNi4sTj0LE9g

The chili cheese dog was truly awesome. The bread was fresh and the hot dog & chili appeared to be fresh cause they were both very very tasty.

I brought some grand marnier to vegas and added that to my slushy and it was pretty darn good and cheap!

I was just disgusted even more by the fact that my second sandwich tastes like it took a swim in the ocean...  It probably has a 1/2 cup of salt added to the eggs.  I will probably vomit in a few minutes.

We initially were going to find a Denny's or something, but upon discovering this great new thing that we've never had, we entered the premises. To bless Sonic with our first ever presence, we took two laps around the parking lot, ghost ride style (for those who don't know what ghost riding means, look it up on urbandictionary.com). 

We all parked and got out the car like we were supposed to eat inside. Unfortunately, the only thing open was the Drive-Thru, so we all got back inside the car and drove up to the window (keep in mind most of us were still intoxicated).

My order consisted of the following:
-Sonic Bacon Cheeseburger (For as fast as they made it, it rivals the Western Bacon Cheeseburger at Carl's Jr which happens to be my favorite)
-Popcorn Chicken Combo with a Strawberry Limeade (they make it much better than the ones they serve at KFC, The bites are larger and not as crunchy so you could actually enjoy the chicken. The fries are pretty standard, but go great with the combo)
-Sonic Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Blast (what a way to finish off a meal)
All this cost me about 10 bucks. Not bad at all.

We parked our car in the parking lot to scarf down our newfound meals. Upon finishing we went back to our hotel room, unable to sleep due to the fact we were all food comatose. When we finally did sleep, we woke up 8 hours after check out. That's a whole 'nother story though. =P

5 stars only for this location, being it was the first time I ever ate at a Sonic. I also wish they open up a location near San Francisco.",DNgzJO2ITL1Shzie2b6fPA,3,2,5,JFlMlcKy9PFxZ72yoqV_xw

I'd come here many times over for a middle of the night chili dog and tots and the next time I come I'll try the chili cheese tots, these would be my tried and true and I wouldn't stray to far from them.... The fries weren't good to me I like my fries crispy on the outside and soft in the center these fell short, the poppers were okay just wouldn't waste my calories on them again, I don't drink soda and I'm a iced tea pro and sonic did me proud fresh brewed added my own sweetener and was on my way. The only thing that disappointed me was the slushes I had such high expectations and they fell short. They were just super sweet no depth nothing to write home about I've had better flavors at 7 eleven.

There are medical marijuana dispensaries on both sides of this Sonic Drive Thru.  Check out the video!

They sell you pot, knowing damn well you are going to get the munchies.  They know you're going to end up next door at Sonic.  By the time you finish your feast, you need to burn again.  Back to the dispensary.

There is usually a line which is understandable, no complaints there. My issues with this location is the girl on the intercom asks for my order which is just a lime aid. I know it sounds petty but there's more. So she has my order and I get to the window and they asked what my order was again. So I tell her and they start making it. I paid with my card and I realized that they overcharged me because they charged me for the ingredients in the lime aid and the drink was the wrong drink. I called and let them and I got good ol Dana on the phone. She tried to convince me to go back and get another one and I said I can't because I'm back at work. I go there again the next day and order and paid for my drink and saw that the price was lower on this drink so I spoke with the manager-in-training, and told him what happened yesterday. He looked at the receipt and told me they overcharged me and he wanted to make it up to me and comp me some food. I kindly refused and he offered me a free lime aid on my next visit. I said ok, I can go for that. Well, that leads me to today. I was fortunate enough to get Dana at the window. I told her that the manager-in-training left my name at the register for a free drink. She then gave me the he free drink the shoves a coupon at me for $2 off and said that ""since I couldn't wait for her to send it to me, here's your coupon"" I was like ""wait hold on"". She said that I couldn't wait for her to send it and that she's going to have a talk with the manager-in-training because he was out of line in telling me to redeem a free drink. I tried to explain what happened and she still tried to belittle me and talk over me in front of her working peers. I called the store and asked for her and to further explain myself and it's still the same. She talks over me on the phone and is very argumentative.

The tater tots were decent but they also were soggy and slightly warm. The hot dog was nothing special as well. The restaurant parking lot was packed with a biker group being overlooked by a few cops. With so many people in the parking lot you would think they'd be serving up some fresh food.  

The strawberry slush was the best part of the meal since it had small pieces of real strawberries. But mostly just full of sugar and water. We never went back and probably will not.

We ordered the chicken strip meal with a sweet tea, a small frozen blue raspberry slushee and a small classic limeade slushee.

She got my bf's sweet tea right, but initially gave us another small sweet tea and I guess a regular limeade drink? We told her that we received another sweet tea, instead of our blue raspberry slushee. She came back and gave us another drink, that wasn't even blue, and you guessed it...it wasn't even right. She also didn't even look at us or say anything; just closed the window and walked away. She obviously didn't even care - so there was no point in trying again.

I completely understand if that particular location didn't serve the new items there, but we weren't told otherwise.

2. The employee had no business snapping at me when the system told me to wait.

The first time I tried their SuperSonic breakfast burrito at this location about 10yrs ago. I fell IN LOVE with it. It has everything except the kitchen sink. Sausage, bacon, eggs, cheese, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos & tater tots. It's pretty hefty too. I've honestly lost count how many times I've had it at this location. I've even gotten others to try it and some really like it too. I can't speak for other locations since this is the Sonic I've patronized 95% of my visits. I've had a couple other items too but the SS breakfast burrito is by far my fave.
Last week near the strip I needed to grab some late night grub. I felt a hankering for an awesome SS breakfast burrito. Initially I thought I got the wrong order since the burritos were considerably smaller than what I've known SSBB to be. Though it turns out that wasn't the case. I had ordered 2 of them. Inside one I found 2 or 3 tater tots, 2 jalapeno slices, a couple diced onions & tomatoes. If not for that I would've thought I got the wrong burritos. There was alot less of all the other ingredients in both of them. Both were roughly 1/2 to 2/3 the size I've known them to be all these years.
I decided to call back and ask the night manager on duty if perhaps my order wasn't done correctly. He explained that the burritos I got were how they were supposed to be made. They had to control rising food costs and were being overstuffed by the kids that work there for a long time. I had just had one there the week before and mentioned that fact. He said they just started correcting things.
Sure, the price has slowly gone up over the years. Which was ok, I was still willing to keep eating them. But I will not be paying $3.19 for an item that's suddenly almost half the size it used to be up til 2 weeks ago.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,2,0,1,GlNy-DHzPd2cOQBAeGTeeA

""SONICCCCC! Ohhhhhhh, make a U-turn and let's go!""

That's how the conversation went awry as my friends and I cruised through Vegas one hot summer night. We pulled up, parked, and looked over the menu. It was like the Land of Oz - everything looked amazing! And not because it was amazing, but because we just don't have Sonic in LA. The little carhop girls were skating around. Between the enticing menu and the roller skates we were all like ADD kids not knowing what to order or where to focus our eyes. So far, Sonic was cool!

Cool didn't last long once the food arrived. 1 word: salty! I swore I thought I was going to develop hypertension after eating here. The hot-dog was ok, nothing special. But the tater tots that we were oh so excited to get, were just littered with salt. We all thought there were just way too salty to enjoy. The cherry slushy drink was nice 'n sweet (which meant I might become diabetic also!), and overall the meal made for a decent late-night snack.

Basically, it was not busy at all, rather just an average- to less-than-average-sized fast-food crowd and a set of incompetent staff.
