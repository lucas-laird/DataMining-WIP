145588,2011-02-09,0,fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw,"I don't know what happened. 

I looked up Chinese food on my mobile Yelp and this was one of my two choices. This place got better reviews then Jackie Chan so I went with it. 

The Hubs and I ordered Chicken Lo Mein, Spicy Garlic Broccoli, Szechuan  Shrimp and Chicken Curry. 

They said it would be 45 min to an hour. Got there in 20 min. Great, we left them a big tip and got ready to dig in. 

Where did the meat go?? Considering I try not to eat many carbs, there was no meat in these dishes. I didn't try the lo mein but the shrimp and chicken curry had a few bites of meat and all veggies. Needless to say, I went hungry because I don't eat rice. The curry had a weird flavor. I haven't had tons of Thai curry so I am basing my comparison on Pin Kow which is yummy. The spicy broccoli was the only thing that didn't disappoint. When I am paying 9 bucks for a chicken dish, I expect there to be chicken in it. 

I will never order from here again. Waste of 40 bucks.",rONMYLVdSph8OQBb27wDKQ,4,1,1,BHOsu5GKWIdb80n7VN_BWg

Be EXTREMELY careful when you order here especially if you're taking it to go.  They will intentionally leave out certain items (egg rolls, fortune cookies, and such) and by the time you get home, it's too late (at least that's what they hope).  This has happened to me 3 times in a span of a month and every single time, it's been a to go order.  When we eat in, it's fine, every time.  Another thing to ABSOLUTELY look out for is the order accuracy.  I swear to you, over 80% of my orders have been wrong which is mind boggling! You will also notice people checking their orders before they walk out because everyone has been a victim of a wrong order or missing items which appears to be the norm.  Besides these shady business practices, the orange chicken is the only thing I eat here and that's OK when they actually make it right, which happens rarely.  Most of the times it's very mushy and soggy even when you're eating in so you need to MAKE SURE they fully cook it unless you want to eat mushy, moist breaded chicken.  Aside from the orange chicken, everything else I tried sucked.  I'm officially over orange chicken so I won't be going back to this restaurant ever again.  

Finally, if your order is wrong, they WILL FIRST BLAME YOU and try to send you off but DO NOT CAVE IN!",2XOqkw-8O0ldzXp7ta_Y6g,1,1,1,9LEuk-2IyihW0AK8T2c0Qw

So far I've gotten Orange Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Kung Pao Chicken which all include white rice, fried rice, or lo mein and an egg roll for about 6 bucks. The portions are HUGE! They give it to you in a jam packed styrofoam container as you can see in my pics. There's so much that it normally takes me two days to finish. No problem there because I love me some Chinese leftovers. 

The Orange Chicken is all white meat which makes it a little more dry than normal, but I still like it more than most other places because I prefer white meat anyway. My brother likes the General Tso's Chicken more though because he says it's less saucy than the Orange Chicken. The Kung Pao Chicken I tried today had way too many veggies. I know it's suppose to have a lot of veggies, but there was hardly any meat at all in there; I might as well have just gotten a vegetarian dish. 

Pros:
Cheap
Big portions
Free wifi!
Slushies and Thai Tea
Tasty food
Location
Nice staff
Clean
Free refills

Cons:
Too little meat in some of the meat dishes

The Mongolian beef I ordered was made with the cheapest, chewiest beef since I bought beef jerky at 7-11 a few years back.  The fried rice option for the combos is PORK fried rice only.  You can't get regular fried rice.  The pork didn't really go well with the beef, although I'm not sure it was beef.  The fried rice itself was very dried out.  The combo meal consists of a choice of entrees for lunch, plus pork fried rice, lo mein and one other option.  You do not get soup with the combo, and a drink is separate......so much for the great prices.  If you got the Mongolian beef, with an order of soup, and a drink, the price of lunch would be well over $10.00....hardly a bargain.",gyTYQo6Cn4BYB4z-McRDaA,1,0,1,Hlfsbb5lLEz2JcT3E253iA

Excellent dinner tonight!

Had dinner with my family, got the garlic shrimp lo mein, sesame chicken, sweet and sour shrimp, boneless ribs, potstickers. Everything was on par!

The boneless ribs were out of this world good. Reminded me of NY chinese food, except better! My dinner was delicious, the sesame chicken was tender and flavorful, and my mother loved her sweet and sour chicken. 

Also, the fortune cookies were hilarious. Mine told me that I would be a good lawyer (I dropped out of law school), and my mother's said she would take a vacation (she's on one). The other two were blank. Sidenote, wtf, blank fortune cookies?

4615537,2011-12-28,1,fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw,"This is a great place for dine-in, delivery, or take-out Chinese food! The restaurant itself is clean, casual, and provides a comfortable environment to hang and eat for however long. The prices are reasonable and portions are generous.

My favorite is their Szechuan garlic chicken extra spicy with white rice. They provide plenty of meat so that you're not fishing through too many veggies to find it. The chicken fried rice is also good because it isn't too greasy. I'm normally not a big fan of fried rice but I enjoyed the one here. I also recommend their wonton soup... hearty and comes with quality wontons (not the yellow, Americanized kinds), and the broth isn't too salty like most other places.

Staff is friendly and helpful... (we all know this is not the case for most Chinese restaurants). They're also lenient with menu modifications so if you like your dish extra spicy or enjoy baby corn the way I do, they will not have a problem making these adjustments. :) Overall I definitely recommend this place for a meal that's quick, cheap, filling, and enjoyable.",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,1,0,5,kgmR-cEQQg8F_GCvrpWiJQ
4655026,2017-04-24,9,fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw,"XO to their peppersteak with onions:

   If ""XO"" means hugs and kisses. Then I say XO to their peppersteak with onions. It is this XO to their peppersteak with onions that has brought me to the XO Chinese Restaurant (abbreviated XO) a few times the last couple of years. 

  XO is located in a shopping center at the southwest corner of Blue Diamond Road and Cimarron in the Mountain West community. Sitting in this location it is in the shadow of Exploration Park Mountain. It was after hiking up the Exploration Park Mountain (also called Shoelace) that I found out about XO. For the record Yelp was the guide that led me there. 

  I don't like repeating myself, however, I want to spread the word that the Chinese Restaurant lunch special is one of the best deals around. From the first time I visited XO after Exploration Park to today after Red Rock Canyon, I took advantage of the XO lunch special. 

  The XO lunch special, as seen in one of the pictures proceeding the review features fifteen different dishes ranging from $5.69 to $6.99. In my case, there is one item that I order. It is the peppersteak with onions (I will return to the peppersteak with onions shortly). 

  The dining environment is more Chinese Take Out with tables than full service restaurant. When I have ordered from XO, it was off a pamphlet outside the restaurant or at the counter. If I opted out of a pamphlet menu, I could order off a large wall menu that takes up a large part of the left wall. There is no XO to interior design even though it was closed a short time for refurbishment. With each experience, I'd order and pay at the counter, fill up my twenty ounce soft drink then wait for the person that accepted my money to deliver my food in a styrofoam bucket dish. While waiting for my food, I'd sip a Pepsi soft drink that I poured in the 20 ounce cup while overhearing the TV above. On today's visit I overheard ""Family Guy."" 

   Everytime, that I worked on the peppersteak with onion lunch combination ($6.59 plus $1.25 for 20 ounce soft drink), it was obvious that everything they served was outstanding. My styrofoam bucket plate was a representation of quality. Representing quality was fried rice, an egg roll, and the peppersteak with onions. Regardless of how diminutive the egg roll is, the taste is gargantuan. The fried rice exceeds the quality of quite a few Las Vegas Chinese restaurants. As far as the main dish, one more time I write ""xo to the peppersteak with onions."" Before wrapping up my experience with their food, I need to bring up that XO is one of the few Chinese Restaurant lunch specials excluding soup. 

  In conclusion, XO gives hugs and kisses to their peppersteak with onions and most likely other dishes. It is a hugs and kisses that has created exceptional peppersteak with onions that has been an afternoon delight that  skyrocketed my taste buds in flight during the lunch special. ""XO"" to their peppersteak with onions, fried rice, and egg roll.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,16,4,9GDI-_5kV9FNmoNW0VaNcQ

Up pops XO. Now, I have to say I definitely use yelp more and more now to determine where I am going to go and what I am going to do when I get there. The reviews for this place were high and XO did not disappoint.
We ordered a family dinner, so we could get some appetizers to go along with our meal and be more cost effective. So we ordered the BBQ pork fried rice with dinner which was excellent, won ton soup (also really yummy with lots of won tons unlike other places where with 2-4 ppl you get one won ton a piece usually), egg rolls, and chicken skewers with a nice lemony sorta sauce. We also got the Orange Chicken and the Crispy Almond chicken by Yelp recommendation as well. Id say the Orange Chicken was my fave in the dinner as unlike most chinese restaurants, the chicken was super crispy and covered in the orange sauce. My bff loved the Almond Chicken and sauce.
In addition to the food being awesome when we got home, it took less than 10 minutes from ordering to get our order. They also deliver so we will be checking that out next time. Thank you yelpers for such a great suggestion.

I was given the heavily breaded chicken which is used for their (sweet and sour chicken dish) just doused in general tso's sauce, making it quite soggy and unappetizing.

I held my plate up to the wall menu pictures pointing out the difference of chicken texture between the sweet and sour chicken and general tso's chicken dishes. He still insisted that I was wrong. I asked to order Mongolian beef instead because I don't care for the heavily breaded/fried chicken dish doused in general tso's sauce.. he took my plate and replied he will bring me a ""Mongolian chicken"".. I corrected him that I asked for beef and he told me I owe him $1.. SERIOUSLY DUDE?! I'll happily bring my business elsewhere.

5948007,2018-02-03,0,fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw,"I would have given them a better rating as their prices and portions beat China A Go Go by a long stretch but there are a few problems. Firstly I hate when Chinese restaurants advertise spring rolls as ""egg rolls"", which is a traditional Hunan dish that was Americanised and Europeanised (yes we have/had them in Europe too) but for some reason the tide turned against deep fried food and spring rolls largely replaced egg rolls. Egg rolls are deep fried, larger and usually have an assorted vegetable (chopped not stringy) and meat filling, usually pork. These are really hard to find. Reading ""egg roll"" on their menu made me salivate, literally-I love egg rolls. 

The next problem is that for me I love Lo Men (Chow Mien) noodles, they did an amazing job and this dish was large, in a traditional Chinese take-away box and absolutely perfect. 

I am trying to wrap my head around how what was once called ""Peking Ravioli"" became ""pot stickers"" but apparently in Nevada they are pot stickers. In Europe and I know on the East Coast in USA too the term Peking Ravioli still prevails, I can accept the change of terminology and they did a great job with these as well--PORK. I do not know why so many Chinese restaurants have gone over to chicken, it is not the traditional way to cook these nor is it good. They made really good ""pot stickers"". (BTW ""dumplings"" is another word that used to describe these, ie ""pork dumplings, fried or steamed""). 

Where they struck out was the Szechuan Beef dish. It was not my dish but I did examine and eat a bit of it as my husband said there was no meat in it all Chinese vegetables as filler-and he was 100% correct. Good luck trying to find the beef in that dish. To top it off it was not the least bit spicy. 

I would get Lo Mein and perhaps the pork dumplings again but would be hesitant to get much more.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,1,0,3,oNDOlzC3nRY20ZvLO5BB5Q

It's definitely not the strip in Las Vegas. The people were very cheerful and we're processing to-go orders like wildfire. I guess that getting it delivered can be a real Plus for some people.
