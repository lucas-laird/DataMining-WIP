But the bigger problem was that the gravy was very very spicy, which was not identified anywhere on the box, and which for me made it inedible.",966AO8pD3JGsfC54_oqbAQ,0,0,1,dBG-7LDrHagJKmrLzQimtg

At first, I was concerned on the portion size, but I just finished my meal and I am satisfied. The employee there was awesome and gave me the run down on how they make the food and the food change outs to keep freshness. Definitely pleased with the food and location is also great. Will recommend.",dq7V1W55R3Cut-bBSHnt7A,1,2,5,ZMPG4pVFgVKZpI42QRaGPg
1871254,2017-01-24,2,SMwXru_Ga-oFyNbA6YVuSQ,"Not a great first impression... I know that the store is new but the interior of the store was very cold and uninviting. I walked into an almost empty store with 2 black shelving units on each  of the side walls.  The guy working there greeted me right away but didn't really ask me any questions like if it was my first time or anything like that. He just said hi and then walked behind the counter.  Ambiance (1/5)

I walked and looked at all of the containers that were there. Some of them looked OK... But I gotta admit that the prices were all a little high for me. It was like the quantity didn't equal the price. I posted a picture of the Mac and cheese.... It was kind of hard to see in the picture but it was like 2 broccoli florets and seriously like 4 spoonfuls of macaroni for $6.35... Without tasting it...I can't say about flavor but honestly why does healthy always = $$$$? Value (1/5) 

I was excited about this place opening but honestly going to trader Joe's or whole foods or even glaziers and buying their pre-made stuff is a better deal. I guess if you are a true celiac and can't have any gluten this might be a good try but if you are a normal person like me just trying to eat healthier with very little time on hand I would look elsewhere.

I did end up buying 2 things... Ended up being $22.98... For 2 very little entrees. I'll update my review once I actually taste the food... Quality (????) Since this review is just mainly covering the ambiance and service

And oh at the end I used their bathrooms because they were getting some tables delivered and the guy was on the phone and pretty much ignoring me trying to figure out the table situation... And while I was waiting I used the bathroom and I guess it's not for guests... Cuz I was trying to close the door and he almost ran in saying that they normally don't have a bathroom....Uummmm...I guess I was just imagining the bathroom...:/ Weird how he could ignore me the whole time he was on the phone and as soon as I walk into the bathroom that is normally not there he saw me...

He did mention that if we see something on the menu that they do not have currently, we can request it and they could make it for us.

Unless the food is amazing... Which it didn't look like it would be...I don't see myself returning anytime soon.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,11,2,2,Hd7GfHpEokRrsBz00WH1RQ

1887335,2017-01-02,0,SMwXru_Ga-oFyNbA6YVuSQ,"Decided to come here and try this place out because I've been failing at meal prep. The setup is extremely simple but clean which I like. And vegetarian meals are separated from non-vegetarian meals. Since I was having a major sweet tooth I just went with the strawberry muffins with some type of yogurt spread. I popped these in the microwave like the instructions said and let me tell you these didn't even taste microwaved they were extremely fresh. I still tasted the strawberries.  Plus the macros were pretty reasonable in terms of protein, fats, and carbs. Which is another plus about this place. I love that they list macros rather than just calories! The only thing keeping me from giving this place a five star is the pricing. I believe it is a little overpriced since it is a take home and heat type of meal. I just expect pricing to be a bit lower because I'm sure meals are prepared In bulk and then pre-portioned.",CpEINVMeAHd3XCcLyAKrzA,3,3,4,CbSXyvqMjACM15mPiKulNQ

2201381,2017-09-09,3,SMwXru_Ga-oFyNbA6YVuSQ,"Cute little spot for some healthy eats. They are tucked away in a little shopping plaza so I didn't even know they were there. 

You walk in and the store seems empty. They have a small fridge area with fresh juices ans lemonades. Really good but pretty pricey. 

You can also order some food to go since they don't really have any seats. The food is also pretty pricey but I guess eating healthy does cost a Lil more.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,9,6,4,J9UAzqSL6KsFY6yZ5MSvIQ

2842865,2017-08-30,0,SMwXru_Ga-oFyNbA6YVuSQ,"Nice guy, but question the business plan.  They seem to be just a distributor, but their suppliers are leaving them short.  First time I went in, food was scarce and juice was non-existent.  He said, ""Juice will be in next week""

Second time I went in, a week later, there was even less food and still no juice.  We asked when the juice would be replenished and he said, ""next week"".  

They claim they make their food fresh, daily, but when you see the dates, they're at least 4 days old...

There is definitely a market for this...but no supply.

Run your business, man; we're thirsty and have money!",EkmBW1aq8AsxcaHA4pc4aA,0,0,2,arQz5KF51BokCIFblZWKgA

I previously used a chef service for weekly meal preps and it helped me tremendously in weight control, when added with exercise. When my chef moved back to LA I was eager to find another meal prep service. I don't have the gift of making healthy food taste good, so I wanted to try a few samples of the entree items. I purchased 4 entrees and ate the Italian Turkey Meatballs w/Spaghetti Squash this evening. I am impressed... tasty and healthy!

4851729,2017-06-12,0,SMwXru_Ga-oFyNbA6YVuSQ,"Let me start by saying that Health Binge has nutrition and convenience LOCKED DOWN. Payne was very helpful and answered my questions about the food itself. He talked about the Binge plans, which sound like an absolute winner to me.  Lindsey was also VERY friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. It is a breath of fresh air to find people like this, who care so much. Now for the food. The Ancho chile enchiladas are amazing. The cild pressed juices are DELICIOUS and EXTREMELY refreshing. I would highly recommend them to EVERYONE.",QKklJNxMq031Qlx0qdM8YQ,1,0,5,pHgHjwHUO3E7Ggx4c_gCNw
4954534,2017-05-31,1,SMwXru_Ga-oFyNbA6YVuSQ,"just ordered from the Health Binge on UberEATS, the portions are small for a dinner size, especially for my husband. Also it was delivered cold, not because the driver, but there was instructions to heat up in microwave. I needed something fast and ready that's why I had ordered on UberEATS. Granted microwaving is fast, but just not what I expected very disappointed. Won't be ordering again, Especially for the price I paid through UberEATS was expensive for barely any food!  


Oh and to top it off they cancelled my order 2x because they were out of order on the items I chose. So that was frustrating too.",ZVvt2qWigyfqPh0cvy6GCA,4,0,2,DwiYPGiJxGetVqMPfDR-Fw

5393402,2017-03-21,0,SMwXru_Ga-oFyNbA6YVuSQ,"Just to start we typically eat our meals from other meal prep places in town and are always looking for new healthy options...

My husband had the salmon with green beans and a quinoa/rice side which was good flavors but a little on the dry side, I had the meatballs and while they were ok, the spaghetti squash was raw and still had tons of seeds. The side was shredded lettuce which was strange as it completely got wilted during the microwave process, didnt really make sense with the meal to me. 

Overall unimpressed especially for the cost ($26 + tip). I'm disappointed as I was excited to have this option in such a convenient location but dont really see myself coming back.",OFGq70uFf_2PjDSX7nHQ6g,3,0,2,s6AEsKx1efKZy2NCqTcGbw
