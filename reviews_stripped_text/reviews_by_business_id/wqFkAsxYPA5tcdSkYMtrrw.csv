So you think that this place is healthy, ummm not at all. I went on their website at home to see how many calories was in the wrap and the protein shake I ordered, I immediately put the wrap in the refrigerator and only drank half of the smoothie. However, they do have shakes that are only 200 calories, which I usually get. 
The only good thing about this place is it's across the street from CSN so if you want something quick and on the go. They also have all kinds of different smoothies to choose from.

My coworker called tropical smoothie to speak to a manager whom didn't sound at all sympathetic.

So the manager took my coworkers name and number and promised to replace the sandwich.

HAD CHEESE in it so I told the girl at the register who took my order. She yelled back to the girl making the wrap  "" I said it has NO CHEESE"". So we waited again while the same girl remade the wrap.
She gave it to me and apologized. I told her no worries..and left. BIG MISTAKE. 
Got home, still had pieces throughout...and the tortilla had the same MELTED CHEESE from before.

When I arrived no one was there. A Sysco delivery driver with a large food delivery for them had been waiting a half hour already. I tried to corporate number repeatedly and it was busy. I drove to the next closest location - this one. Ashley, at this location, was flippant and said there was nothing she could do. I said there must be a number they have to call in an emergency. She reluctantly gave me a number for ""Joe"" but he did not answer. I had to try to get Ashley's attention again and she called this person who did answer for her. She said she'd try to get me another number to call. I asked if she could at least honor my order (you would think offering to do so would have been the first priority in customer service) but she refused saying ""this is a franchise so we won't get our money"". Wow. I'm sure that $7.01 would break them. Clearly the opportunity to gain a new customer by treating someone right was lost on her. While waiting on her to get back to me with another number to call, I tried the corporate number again and finally got an answer. The first number Ashley gave me did return my call while I was on the phone with them but left no message. Corporate and they are refunding my purchase and sending me a ""VIP card"" - we'll see how that turns out. Ashley never did reappear so I left - 45 minutes later, with no smoothie and late for work.

Went by late last night, I  got one of their superfood smoothies- the Mean Green(?), with kale and spinach and mango and pineapple. Get it with Splenda to save some cals, and the smoothie is a meal at 380 cals. Very filling, very tasty, very sweet.

Joined their website and got an email for a 99 cent smoothie with purchase of a sandwich or wrap. Before I got a chance to even print that up, another coupon came up for TODAY- $1.99 for their curry chicken salad or wrap, and it's decent. Don't know if I'd pay full price for it, but coupons and deals seem to come around often.


EDIT:
Apparently this location's management is now picking and choosing when to honor the company website coupons. I understand franchises are able to opt out of promotions, and the small print always states ""at participating locations"", but if they honor one they should honor all. And with all of the smoothie competition they have in this area, and my observations of the amount of business they do, they can't really afford to be turning away customers.
I'll be spending my money elsewhere from now on- getting turned away for a $2 discount coupon that is ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE was a total waste of my lunch break today (3/26/14).

Quick Review
+   Service -- in the morning -- is great.

+/- Smoothies are alright. Aaaaight. Service during lunchtime is hit or miss. Don't come here in a rush. Like at all ... 

-    Free smoothie during birthday was not honoured. Check the check-ins, yo. I ain't a newbie. They wouldn't honour a single birthday freebie for a stupid ass reason and I will never set foot in here again. One-star all up in yo' face! 

-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------

I am not necessarily proud of this, but I have tried nearly every smoothie and sandwich on the menu. Not every smoothie at some Tropical Smoothie Café® at some point, but almost every smoothie from their menu exclusively at this location.  

Why? Well ... ain't shit else open (besides McDonald's®) around here that early. And I need shit to eat early. It is right across the street from the CSN campus. 

Service is fine in the morning.

Now, what is my proverbial beef here? I've been here dozens and dozens and dozens of times (verified check-ins: 58, although I have been here more times than that) after all. 

I received a birthday email for being in their E-Club (which is worthless, by the way [not just because they won't honour what is sent, but because there is no point to it]) and printed it out like a good lil' soldier. 

Pro Tip: The E-Club is useless. Don't join it.

For whatever reason (I am not IT), my name did not print with the stupid email. I don't know. Don't really care. My name is on my ID card and I have the printed electronic mail. If one would go through the trouble of searching for the email template just to ... what ... photoshop someone's name off of it ... don't you think that you would just also insert one's own fucking name in there? I mean: seriously. 

Pro Tip: Photoshop your fucking name on there if it prints sans. 

No one accused me of photoshopping another person's name off of it; however, how else would it be nameless if they are insistent that they are never sent that way and they cannot honour it. The manager said fuck off in not so many words. 

I had been here over sixty fucking times in a relative short period of time. If they shit on a regular customer like that, what kind of service do you think you will get while going through the drive-thru or just dropping in one day. 

Possibly the second worst run Tropical Smoothie Cafe® on Planet Earth* ....

*Second last to the Red Rock Resort one.

I don't play games: enjoy your one-star from a long-time customer that will never patronise this location again. Cheers!

Pro Tip: Ask for the manager to be fired.

My friends and I needed some time to relax after our first class and decided to take a break from McDonalds and hang out here instead. It was fine and dandy and had an 'Einstein Bros Bagel' feel to it. 

I ordered a Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wrap and a Sunny Day Smoothie (to brighten up myself from the gloomy weather outside) For my sides, I chose the Sour Cream and Onion flavored baked lays potato chips. Despite the spiciness of the JJC Wrap - spicy food are my mortal enemies - I actually liked the flavor it had and would recommend it to anyone who's willing to be adventerous and try something new. Our next dish to try is the Buffalo Chicken and the Totally Turkey. 

Of all the things I wished this place had, it would be different sized smoothie cups. I had a feeling my order would be too much for me to even finish and I was right. My 2 friends had to help me devour the remaining wrap and I went on to sip at the smoothie the rest of the day.

 The Peanut Paradise....I would sell my Mother, and possibly two of the dogs for.  It must have almost 500 calories, so it IS my breakfast, but when it's that good, really, who cares?
 There are several Roberto's near by. I have NEVER driven PAST a Robertos for ANYTHING in my life, yet I find myself sneaking past, looking sadly at the pictures of Rolled Tacos, as I make my way BACK for possibly the second Peanut Paradise of the day.
 The staff are ok, no sense of humor, and a little slow sometimes. The Smoothies are NOT alwas the same consistency, sometimes almost too runny, sometimes so thinck I look like I am trying to suck a rat up the straw. A really tasty freaking rat that smells like Peanut Paradise.
 If you go during the off times the place is empty. During rush hour it is SLAMMED but still pretty quick.
 My daughter said the Bacon Ranch Chicken Sandwich was the best thing she had ever had in her mouth. @__@ Blocking THAT thought, she has had several Smoothies and liked them all.
 They even have an almost dessertish selection with coffee and carameley flavors, and you can get any of the them with Splenda, and add things like Energy, and Weight Management. Thank God, or I'd weigh an extrea 45 Lbs by now.
 I would be ok with that, find me a Chubby Chaser who liked Peanut Butter Breath.

I have been to 4 LV locations so feel pretty confident when I give this feedback.  In addition, I frequent their establishments at least 2-3 times a week.  I said I was addicted!!!  :p
