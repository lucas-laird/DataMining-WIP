I was there for a christmas party for a real estate company so most of my interactions were with those people, not regular patrons.  BUT, one of our co-horts sat down at a machine and hit the PROGRESSIVE ROYAL within her first $20!   Not bad...",PUdifmlsaUMIfPlhQnZbHg,0,0,3,GWiG5zWkSSi8RvMzgNk5Ng

Mourning having to put down my 17-year-old bichon that I've had since he was six weeks old I switched up my drinks to Long Island ice teas. I put $20 in machine and was losing until I hit four of a kind so ordered another drink. Had a ton of credits and I cashed out with $23. He paid me and said now I'm going to have to charge you $7 for that last drink. I thought how petty the casinos don't operate like this. Please join me in my boycott of Putters. I even tipped him. I would give 0 stars if Yelp wouldn't let me. Bartender needs to be fair and communicate. He said your going to keep playing and I did.,4AjocDGdZNPyhBLQpxpa_Q,0,0,1,IpdJsP-ANNRfDCl1pygxPw

Great bartender who was extremely welcoming & nice. 
A few pool tables & good music! 
Pretty sure you can order food from Angelina's Pizza.",P7Qt34VblZupUifRJ_5hbA,0,0,5,6SK923CVCue6dDcohwMLUg
