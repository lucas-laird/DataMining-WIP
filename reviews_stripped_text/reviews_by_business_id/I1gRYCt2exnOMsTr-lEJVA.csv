3606,2016-08-25,0,I1gRYCt2exnOMsTr-lEJVA,I took yelps advice and it didnt do me wrong . When i arrived i was greeted by some very friendly staff. I felt very welcomed. Means alot when your traveling alone. First thing i noticed about this place was the cute decor different but i liked it. Especially the use of different kind of chairs. They gave me time to figure out what i wanted and made great suggestions. I ordered food was good and i was full. Only thing that wasnt my favorite was the water but i think thats a city problem . I checked in with yelp to get a free mimosa. Mmmmm. Kinda strong but they dont play in Vegas. My bill was very affordable. The mananger was even nice enough to seat down and give me suggestions on what i can do here. Very nice and sweet of him. Go check them out.,O9c4P42hb-iSgx7tovndog,2,1,5,jUQun3eMRJlCVR_QBKttQw

94899,2016-09-05,1,I1gRYCt2exnOMsTr-lEJVA,"I came to this place because of the Yelp reviews, and I must say I was disappointed.

First of all, we opened the menu and were surprised by how expensive it was.  I normally don't expect to spend $15 for an omelette in a place that is located in a suburban strip mall where the basic decoration is shabby chic and graffiti. 

We ordered pancakes and french toast, which were okay, but not remarkable.  We had two different people aggressively try to sell us on their loyalty program. Our server gave us the hard sell in the middle of our meal.

We won't be back.",IDBmm77l1Tgf8oUY1uNhxw,2,2,2,G84rBpU6yS8rxa0Oslthsw

The ladies were all friendly and helpful. 
The food wasn't horrible. My husbands omelet was great! I got the eggs Benedict and it seemed like it sat for a while. The English muffin was so soggy it was beyond edible and the potatoes were crusty and old. I was very disappointed in my meal, but everyone else in my party was happy. 
When the check came we almost pooped our pants. $78 for 4 meals.  We would expect an expensive meal eating out on the strip but not at a place like this. Upon further reading of the check we realized all the up charges that add up quickly. For instance, When ordering we were asked if we wanted plain potatoes or cheesy potatoes. We all got cheesy without realizing it was an additional $3 per plate. 
Bottom line for me, this place isn't worth it. The food doesn't make the outrageous prices worth it. I can make the same food taste better in my own kitchen for half the cost.",Q7K7cysuyV87kIeLBWHp_g,3,0,2,5SMioW4o_DbAn8geTBtHUw

301416,2017-06-25,0,I1gRYCt2exnOMsTr-lEJVA,"Not a very good first impression.  Had wanted to check out this place after seeing the eclectic omelette selection. Probably the best thing was that they were able to seat us right away despite the crowd still being busy on a Sunday morning (around 1130ish). We got drinks right away, but when we tried to place our order, the person said she would notify our server.  Ok, fine.  Only our server never showed up.  When the server to the table next to us started taking their order (and they arrived well after us), I got out of my chair to ask where our server was.  And apparently it was the server at the other table. So that didn't leave a great first impression.  Our order was promptly taken after I raised a stink.   I decided on the patty melt with upgraded garlic fries and my wife had the special chipotle shrimp tacos.  In hindsight, we probably should've tried out more traditional breakfast fare, but neither of us were feeling like their breakfast items that day.  While the patty melt burger was good, the garlic fries were not edible at all.  It's like they took a fresh batch of shoestring fries and dumped some kind of garlic concoction on it.  Super disappointed and so I would not recommend the garlic fries at all.  The 3 chipotle tacos were very oily, little shrimp and the salsa that they had available hardly qualified as salsa (tasted more like a marinara sauce than a decent Mexican salsa).  Cannot recommend those either.  But the kicker is that all of these very unsatisfying food dishes were very expensive.  Do not expect to find any value priced breakfast food items here.  Patty melt was almost $13 (with the garlic fry upgrade) and the tacos were $13 as well.  I can overlook some food flaws if the price is right.  But at these prices, the good had better be amazing...and it simply wasn't.  I doubt I will return.",4BN6fq_Glvkgx6Su8dUiAQ,0,0,2,pxCNLwpXKHrBe_MAZp2YqA

Our serve was awesome no problems there. The problem came when we ordered our food we all order something different between breakfast to lunch options. We were waiting for about 30-45 mins after we ordered and no food yet then i seen at food window my dish and my daughters dish sitting at the window while a server(not ours) just standing there staring at the food and i was like or are you going to bring that to us or not and it sat in the window for a good 15 mins before being served to us and then we had to wait for my husbands biscuits and gravy to come out and then our server came over to let my husband know that the oven went out about 45 mins ago so couldn't make the biscuits and gravy (why wasn't this told 45 mins ago that way he could order something else) my husband was angry so he went to wait in the car for us while i tried to eat my pancakes and eggs and bacon it was cold and gross and my daughters burger was cold as well. we didn't eat the food at all we had to go up to the counter to get our check and the lady asked if we enjoyed everything and i completely went off on her about our horrible visit there, she stated we didn't have to pay the check, i did give our serve a tip just cause he was on top off everything else.

A friend of mine suggested we go here, so I thought I'd give it a whirl so I could at least see if I thought it was a place my fiance would like... OMG!!! 

As soon as we walked in, the hostess greeted us warmly with a smile. Server went out of her way to make sure we were completely taken care of. Ambiance was pretty cool. Bathrooms were clean. 

The menu, omg!! As a vegetarian, (and the fiance is a meat eater), I'm used to settling for a house salad, or some crazy, modified version of a menu item that takes the poor server 20 minutes to put in the computer, for it to then usually come out wrong. They have so many vegetarian options!! HUGE bonus for me. We had 2 mimosas, and ended up splitting the ""Buckin Buster"" omelet. (The individual portions are huge, btw). Comes with sausage (we got it on the side for him to eat), spinach, mushrooms, and Monterey Jack cheese, with potatoes and sourdough toast. Everything tasted absolutely amazing!! So flavorful, and, like I said, this is coming from someone who doesn't even really like breakfast food! I usually add ketchup or hot sauce to an omelet, but that would have been a serious injustice to this omelet. Absolutely sensational!

The menu is GIANT and I love all the ""pro tips"" for nearly every menu item.  I tend to narrow my choices down to 2-3 and then ask my server what his/her recommendation is, so I was very happy to have someone who wasn't afraid to share her opinions.  The Chorizo benedict (with the pro tips: add avocado and get the potatoes Otis Style - with grilled onions and melted cheese) was incredible!  And filling - I think we stopped in for brunch, and I was so full I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day.  Husband got the Jack Johnson Banana Walnut Pancakes, and they didn't disappoint (let me back this up with Jack Johnson's song banana pancakes was one of the things that brought my husband and me together, so we absolutely love banana pancakes and rainy days... and he's not a fan of walnuts, but LOVED his meal).

Entire staff was inviting, loved being there, and accommodating.  They have a rewards program, and I got a coupon for a free mimosa on our next visit!

1003600,2017-03-06,0,I1gRYCt2exnOMsTr-lEJVA,"Continuing our search for the perfect breakfast this place came very very close.  

The decor is a rather quirky mix of space-alien, graffiti and old barn finds.  And I'm not sure if they have two matching tables in the place.  Their name is appropriate to the open, tight fitting, but glassy and bright seating plan.  It was somewhat noisy, but tolerable.  

The menu is extensive and filled with usual and unusual selections which also have unusual and unexpected names.  But the food is excellent.  I had what  they call Zweifel (Zwy-full) which is a peanut butter omelet with apples and bananas, sautéed in butter and honey in an omelette with peanut butter. I also added bacon to run up the score. That combination might seem a bit strange, but it was delicious. This was one of the dishes that could be made gluten free by substituting corn tortillas for toast, but sadly that taste didn't fit.  

My wife had the Bombshelter Bacon Benny which is English muffin topped with bacon, mushrooms and sauteed in a wine sauce with three poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce and avocado slices.  She liked it so much she was still talking about it well into the afternoon. 

As usual we got there at just about the peak hour, but the wait for a table wasn't too long.  The wait for the food was a bit longer than I like, but all and all not too bad.  And the staff was helpful and courteous and kept our coffee cups full, which helped mitigate the wait time.

FOOD: If you're in the mood for a big meal for breakfast, this is your place. Their orders are all made to order with fresh ingredients. Their basic breakfast alone came with bacon, potatoes, eggs, toast, and a huge side of biscuits and gravy. Way too much food for me! One downside about this place is that they do not serve white bread. Their menu though is very complex with many original dishes that I have never seen at any other breakfast restaurants.

DRINK: If you're in the mood for a bloody mary or mimosa, I'll tell you what the waiter said to me, ""the drinks here are made with 98% alcohol and 2% juice."" They really aren't stingy with their drinks! I highly recommend the Hi-Mosa, cranberry-orange-champagne. There's also juice and coffee if you're not in the mood for alcohol;)

ATMOSPHERE: Aliens O.o There is literally aliens everywhere! The owner had a farm where he made alien statues and the neighbors would steal them and put them around other neighbors lawns. So the owner decided to bring the alien to this restaurant. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant has a bright and welcoming atmosphere.

First, check in and you get a free drink. Score! Both the BF and I got Bloody Mary's which were large and strong. 

The menu is pretty big, busy and a bit overwhelming. I went with the ""Racy Tracy,"" dish made famous because of Bobby Flay. The BF went with the ""Twice Baked Scramble."" 

I expected some good food but both dishes were pretty bad. The bacon in mine was way overcooked and I couldn't even taste the mushrooms, although I saw them in there. The omelette itself looked and tasted like it was from Denny's. It had an unnatural super bright yellow color to it and was so fluffy it had no taste. Like eating a bunch of airpockets.

The BF'S scramble was better than my dish but that isn't saying much. Same with his bacon. Just overcooked to the point it doesn't taste like bacon anymore. 

I don't get it. Based on the reviews, I really expected some good food but left very disappointed. I will say the staff was super nice and the place itself is cool. But that doesn't make up for the subpar food. Maybe it was just a bad morning?",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,1,0,1,IZwH9g-yhX67IGxvPKeeHQ

So you can imagine my excitement to learn that the business was expanding and coming down to Vegas! 

Upon my first visit I was amazed to see the atmosphere was the same as I remembered. Seeing bikes hanging from the ceiling and writing on the wall was a welcomed bit of nostalgia. The place is adorable with the unique traits and characteristics. It is more than a restaurant and more like that kooky aunt you know and love.

And while the character of the establishment is fabulous, it wouldn't be much without the excellent service and food. Andrew is one of the best servers I have ever had. He remembered my friend and I from our first visit a month ago. The other servers are fabulous too. Always smiling and willing to answer your questions. I don't believe I've ever had bad service at Squeeze Inn. Simply put, the people are friendly and fast, something that makes a lot of the experience. 

And the food, don't get me started! I always find a new favorite on each visit! The menu is also quite inclusive meaning you can bring your vegetarian and vegan friends without worry. And if you want to special order something, I always add or take out things, it's no trouble. Or at least, they act like it isn't.

But Squeeze In is a miracle for people like me who enjoy going out for breakfast. First of all, the place has a very comfortable vibe. You can walk right in an pick any table of your choice, indoor or outdoor. The theme and decor is also very adorable! It's fun to look around and point out all the things on the walls while you wait for your food.
Now for the food...THE BEST part of course. Their menu gives you plenty of options to choose from, insuring that no matter what you're in the mood for, they'll have something for everyone who goes. This place really is for everyone considering they have gluten free & vegetarian options. 
They have multiple omelettes, sandwiches, wraps, etc., and of course the normal breakfast foods like pancakes and such, but it's all home made! So it's all automatically 10 times better than any old Denny's or iHop. My personal favorite thing to get on the menu is 'Uncle Danny's Burrito' when I'm in the mood for more of a meaty meal of a breakfast.

If you're currently debating on if you should try this place for the first time PLEASE DO! You'll find yourself wanting to go every morning just to try something new on their exclusive menu, it's unlike any food I've ever heard of from a breakfast place!

The reason for the 4 starts as opposed to 5 is that the service tends to be a little slow at times and there have been mistakes made on the order. A lot of this can be attritubed to the fact that they are a new restaurant but are already popular and busy.  What pleases me is that the customer service is always on par and they address customer complaints. For example, there was a problem with my order and they had to re-make my meal. The server apologized for putting the order in wrong (did not blame it on the kitchen-huge bonus for me since the kitchen always gets blamed for everything) and took the meal off my check. I wasn't even upset my meal was delayed because I was so impressed with the customer service.

To start...No greeting upon entering, probably because it was packeD (this place has mostly standing room while waiting)... but I am always willing to wait and hope it'll be worth it... this was not.
Took a few minutes for our waitress to approach our table after we were finallY seated, just to tell us she'd be right back. 
We did get our drinks ordered (finally) by another staff member (ps. Check in for a free cocktail) which 2 of us ordered (that deserves the 2 stars)
I ordered the Manly Morris (nothing special about this good Ol breakfast...potatoes def need some flavor, simple seasonings go a long way) I also ordered a side of biscuits & gravy...which didn't come with the the rest of our food and our waitress noticed, because as she she sped by our table she mentioned it would be right out. By the time i finished most of my meal I caught our waitress to inquire about the biscuits and gravy, she again said it would be right out...I asked her to bring a to go box since I was full. She brought the food no box...she finally stopped by to check on our meal, I reminded her that I needed a box. She walked around with boxes in her hand but didn't return so i asked another server for boxes which somehow prompted our server to return with boxes and to let us know she comped our cocktails, I informed her we had already ""checked in"" for the cocktails...her response ""oh good""...the only person smiling that provided good customer service was the one refilling our drinks (I wish I caught her name). What a disappointment, I dont understand the great reviews, there were others visually dissatisfied, maybe they're not yelpers.

Service was excellent, no complaints there . 
I had the queen maggie. Which is ""stuffed"" French toast. Anytime I see this on menus I always order it and I was highly disappointed. So much so that I read all the yelp reviews on it. It is sliced cream cheese. Which I've never seen before. Not fluffy or whipped or soft. It didn't seem very stuffed but more so like an undercooked grilled cheese. To make an accurate comparison it was like slices of French toast with thick mozzarella slices in the middle. I've never had stuffed French toast with unmelted cream cheese, so that was a first. And not very tasteful. So I switched with my boyfriend who ordered Colins bossburger. I didn't like it at first because all burgers are cooked medium well, and we agreed but should have asked for medium. The patty itself was dry and had no flavor. After getting halfway through I remembered that it was supposed to come with sauce, so I reminded our server and she brought us a side of burger sauce. This definitely made the burger. It added flavor and moisture and just made everything taste better. We upgraded our fries to garlic fries and they were delicious! Definitely have a prominent garlic flavor. Overall, not sure if I'll be back. But the portions were very big so it made my Groupon very worth it!",xTimtxT3p1zKrtfP9JRuZA,0,0,2,DyBE78LgVguGhpI0sy7-EQ

I ordered the chilaquiles sub the tofu for scrambled eggs when my order came out after waiting for 20-25 minutes it was wrong , no eggs & still had tofu . They quickly brought me some undercooked scrambled eggs on the side . The tortilla chips were hard so it was more like nachos which isn't what I wanted . I took a few bites and didn't eat anymore of it . I didn't want to complain but it was pretty obvious considering I didn't touch my food . The server didn't ask about it she just took my full plate and handed me the check (still upcharging me for the eggs).

This place is popular and good for them. As for my own experience...it was ok but didn't leave me thinking about my next visit.

I wasn't interested in the dish that was featured so I ordered a simple egg breakfast because that's how I judge breakfast places (can they cook my eggs correctly?). Unfortunately my over medium eggs had a bunch of undercooked white goo. Potatoes, toast & turkey sausage were all good. My man's ham & cheese scramble was also good. 

I also got excited to see a free Yelp checkin offer for a cocktail beverage & decided on a mimosa. It was a hearty size but whatever store bought OJ they use ruined the drink and I only drank a few sips. Bummer! I think I'm spoiled by all the breakfast places that offer freshly squeezed juice. 

Now here's the part that bothered me the most, our table. We were sat at a outdoor type of table with a tile top that everything kept sliding around on. This just annoyed me and as I looked around none of the other mismatched furniture was like our table so I guess we just got unlucky. Just put a few doily's on this table and that'll solve that. 

Service wasn't very friendly either as our waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,44,40,3,WQ8fYtY_ZlI8fM-D_pB_IA

Everything was awesome. The ambience was like being in a beach place in California or your grandmas kitchen. You can write on the walls and there are aliens everywhere. Ask your server about the story behind that! Apparently the Morris family has a thing for the extra terrestrial!

All the staff was kind and attentive.

The food took awhile but it's because they make everything from scratch. And they are BUSY.

Number one complaint was how close the tables were to each other. This isn't a place for an intimidate breakfast.  But it is still fun and comfy.

The mimosas were very generous and free when you check in.

And at 4 large eggs each, they're also huge! I've rarely seen as much omelet variety on one menu as I do here, and it was hard to decide what to order.

My guy and I split the Racy Tracy omelet (mushrooms, bacon, and monterrey jack, topped with avocado, $15), which was stuffed with filling. The mushroom cream sauce complemented this well, and we upgraded our spuds to ""Otis style"" with cheese and grilled onions. The kitchen split our order and each portion was still enough that we didn't eat lunch!

Returned another day and shared a short stack of the Jack Johnson Banana Walnut Pancakes and the Bomb Shelter Bacon Benny- I'm not much of a pancake fan and these were decently fluffy but could have used more bananas and nuts, while the Benedict was delicious and packed with mushrooms and bacon. Again, so much food as to cover two meals, even sharing. 

Location has kitschy road stop decor like their original location in Truckee, including Sharpie graffiti walls and a random bicycle hanging from the ceiling. Staff are super friendly and I like that the menu has substantial lunch dishes (burgers, salads, sandwiches), healthy (under 500 cal) and vegetarian-friendly options, unlike most places known for their breakfast dishes.

TIP: Sign up for their loyalty club online before you visit, and you'll get a $5 off coupon in the mail (which makes their prices considerably more reasonable), plus $10 on your birthday, and champagne on your anniversary!

With so many popular brunch spots in town, its hard to get to them all. This ones been on my list for awhile, first thought...this place is definitely different in a very good way.

Let's start by the writing on the wall..literally, there is writing all over every wall. Want to add your mark? The sharpies are at the front desk...tag away. Now onto the decor, let's talk about complete randomness...snowboards, Elvis pics, more aliens, a curtain to the kitchen that's definitely from the 50's. Its awesome at how unique this place is. 

Let's move on to selecting your seat. Every table and chair is different! Yup! Talk about shopping for things that don't match at all. It's like they went to every garage sale they could find, bought one piece and creatively decided to use it as peice in the restaurant. I LOVED how the tables/chairs were all mismatched. 

Service, 5 stars! You definitely got the small family owned feeling with how attentive, friendly, down to earth the people were. It wasn't the robotic greeting, suggestive selling, touching the table and exit.

Breakfast and Lunch spot always peaks my  interest. On this day after full brick workout for triathlon training. I was in need of hearty breakfast/lunch. Squeeze In was the perfect spot!! One that see many more recovery meals in my future. 

One of the first things that stood out is the alien out front or the chicken chalkboard with the specials of the day. I was thinking (cause this was my first visit) something that see along famous Route 66. I never been just fyi. Once walk in got that total vibe plus whole lot more of everything. Different writing on the walls, vinyl cover albums, and just straight up melting pot of personality everywhere you look. I LOVE it!!! The personality not stop from the minute you walk in the front door. They welcome you with open arms, warm greeting, and definitely get the whole family run business vibe from the workers. The menu talk about personality from the different names for most part every dish. The sandwich I got if want break it down club sandwich they call ""Beautiful Bonnie"". The random alien in the menu. lol. Colorful menu, few pictures of the food, and alcohol list (not often see decent one at breakfast/lunch spot). The kitchen bottles old school in plastic bottle just one color red. Old school diner vibe throw that one in the mix. 

The food like mention went with the ""Beautiful Bonnie"". It truly was Beautiful!!!! The thing that for starter stood out nothing fancy about it but just look hearty, healthy, and hell of good. The waitress asked if wanted three or two pieces of bread. Tradition got go with three. Talk about lot of carbs. The thing that made this club stand out as the best one ever had in life. Not only just the freshness of all the ingredients. Adding the thin slice of carrots. It gave the club different texture. Crunch. Combine it with classic turkey (that add on), alfalfa sprouts, avocado, tomato, and mayo (they ask if want it or not). No bacon in it. It nice REFRESHING sandwich and really the best recovery sandwich any endurance athlete needs post workout. I got fries or could substitute soup of the day. Waitress recommended garlic fries instead. I was like first time why not. It was pretty solid. Not over the top with the garlic but just the right amount. I wanted bowl of soup so got the clam chowder. It was ok. 

I definitely will be back to try some of the breakfast items. I saw some of the pancakes coming out of the kitchen. They were looking really good. The french toast that just looks like da bomb. They have breakfast club program. Free. I signed up. It takes less five minutes and worth five minutes especially if plan on coming back. They have yelp check in get free drink! The good kine alcohol one!!!! 

The service is five stars without doubt. Everyone is super friendly, and it was my first time the upgrade with the garlic fries good call. I would never think about if my waitress not mention it.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,7,7,4,SUN2dEssfmL7XI9t5zu1JQ

I came here with a meetup group on a Sunday around 11 am. The place was busy yet they made sure we were accommodated. We had to wait a little for tables to clear so that all 13 of us could sit together, and they were nice enough not to grumble about us wanting separate checks.
The food was very good and I don't think anyone had anything negative to say, and we all said that we would come back at some point in time. I am excited to bring my Parents here next time they are in town.
I had The Sarge omelet. It had thin-sliced pastrami and melted cheddar cheese. The pastrami was PERFECT! Not salty, not dry. I had cheese added to my potatoes and they were also excellent.

But holy geezuz. I mean they can't even cook their potatoes right anymore. You ask for them a little crispy and you get them over cooked, uneatable. You don't ask for your fries well done and you get soggy nasty fries. DO NOT EVER ORDER THEIR WAY OVER PRICED BLT at this place! So I added avocado and garlic to my soggy undercooked fries, huge mistake on our now $forty something dollar breakfast! I knew I should've drove to Boulder City for my perfect BLTA for $7.99 and their $6 bloody Mary's with awesome bacon! So at Squeeze In you get 2 thin soggy slices of bacon, old mushy tomatoes, dirty lettuce, a dollop of mayo on your thick untoasted bread! What a joke! And not to mention I got the top nub of the avocado in my sandwich! Good thing I didn't choke on it! What a horrible experience. Oh and their nasty ""top shelf bloody Mary's"" are a waste of money!

The server Andrew is the only asset to this location .  Last week I received a Birthday card informing me that I was to receive $10 off a meal.  Today I decided to use the card.  Well I ordered their  eggs bennedict with bacon. The waitress was training another gal so it took a little longer. Since I know they serve their breakfast potatoes hotter than any other breakfast restaurant I asked for a little sour cream.  The meal came and there was a tablespoon of sour cream.  The food was soso.  When I was finished eating and ready to pay my bill I got out the birthday card and my Squeeze in member card along with my credit card. I watched as different servers walked my card, receipt credit card around the restaurant. Not a good feeling then I  was told their computer had crashed.  Finally after 15 min the server brought my card and the receipts for me to sign.  Would you believe they charged me $.79 for the sour cream.  That is just so dumb.  I will not be returning anytime soon .  NO WHERE ELSE HAVE I BEEN CHARGED FOR A TABLESPOON OF SOUR CREAM.

2625311,2018-02-18,0,I1gRYCt2exnOMsTr-lEJVA,"I'm actually feeling bad about writing this review because for the past year this has been my go-to spot for weekend breakfast (and quite a few weekday lunches, too!). The Squeeze In is conveniently close, offer a great variety of breakfast and lunch, mimosas and Bloody Mary's are poured with a little extra ""love"" (read:  strong), and the servers (Kim, Krys, Andrew and the rest of the gang) are awesome folks - super friendly and they take such good care of me. It's like Cheer's with food - everyone knows you and they treat you like family.  They have a great frequent diner program (Egg-head) which provides $10 off certificates, free drinks, and other specials to say thanks. 

In the past the food was super tasty with overly generous portions and consistent predictability. I knew what to expect when I ordered, and I knew it was going to taste good.  However, in the last 90 days or so it's been going downhill and the last couple of times it's just been so meh...  The server team is always SO awesome about trying to fix it that I always go back.  They've redone my food, they've given me discounts, they've given me a coupon for a discount next time, they've given me a piece of chocolate bacon.  All I really want though  is a good plate of food, and for the food to arrive so we can all eat together. 

Maybe it's just hope that eventually the kitchen will get their act together and it'll be back to the great place I enjoyed so much, but after my visit today I'll have to think long and hard about going back.  I ordered an omelet with chorizo, cheese, jalapeño and avocado. When I cut into the omelet, the inside hadn't cooked and the egg came running out all over the plate. This wasn't slightly undercooked - it was pure liquid!  The server saw it immediately took it to be remade - not even a question asked - she saw it and took it away (yes - great service!).  When the next omelet returned it was fully cooked, but just bad.  I don't know where the toppings were but there was so little cheese in this one that I couldn't find it, over half of the omelet had no meat inside, and there were more jalapeños inside than all of Mexico. Basically - it was a solid sheet of scrambled egg and jalapeño with fresh avocado on top. 

My recommendation is to try it yourself. Maybe it's been just bad luck lately.  After all, when you visit the same place as often as I go to the Squeeze In it's bound to happen that the kitchen makes a mistake - no ones perfect.  

Keep your eyes peeled - if I head back I'll update the review and let you know how things turn out.",EZEezH2Im29jXd6l0W3PfQ,1,0,2,e6nyIYpOmNr8xeJsTpyf1Q

We were greeted and seated.....that was the best part.....the servers all had a I'm to tired to be here vibe and were not very prompt about getting our order and refilling coffee and tea, keep in mind there were two other working tables in there with us and about 4 servers wondering around. The food also took longer than it should have considering the lack of patrons. The food arrived and it looked sad. The potatoes were cold, soggy and my eggs Benedict was supposed to have mushrooms sautéed in wine but instead were cold and uncooked and the bacon was hard burnt crumbles. My wife's omelette was cooked hard and was dry and tasteless . Whom ever was cooking had no idea how to cook and there is no one checking to make sure the food looks right before going to the customer.

I arrived at Squeeze In and was able to get a table while waiting for my friend. My friend ended being late for brunch so I ended waiting at the table for about 20 minutes. Waiting gave me an opportunity to browse through their menu with as it had plenty of options to choose from. I eventually ended up ordering before my friend got there, but it was nice not to feel rushed into ordering while I sat there for a good moment.

I ordered the ""Racy Tracy"" as it was featured on the first page and caught my eye. When my friend came she ordered the same thing. The meal that came out matched the picture. The portions were huge and it was a struggle to finish. We also ordered a pitcher of of their House Mimosa. Be cautious as it is accurate to its description and feels like there is only a splash of orange juice.

There have a rewards programs that we both signed up for. We were told they have special promotions where on certain days you can earn more than other days. Birthday and Anniversary promotions were also included in signing up for the program.

I order delivery from their Eastern location and it's fantastic, so finally trying it in person at the restaurant made me happy to know that it's just as tasty but hotter than delivery.

Love the food. You need to eat here. I suggest ordering one plate at first to share for two then trying another one if you feel like eating more.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,2,4,fWGDegueEqXedI3NKJsWGg

We were seated really quickly and the servers were very patient with us while we waited for someone in the party to come. If you order 2 mimosas or vodka drinks, its cheaper, by only a dollar or two. If you have 2 or more people, I would recommend ordering a pitcher (5 servings) of mimosa for $25. Everyone ordered 2 mimosas while my gf ordered the Mama's special juice (lemonade, vodka & a splash of cranberry) and I got the bloody mary. My friend did not like the Mama's special because she said she couldn't taste the vodka in it (but I did). I would not recommend the bloody mary... it was a bit watered down and I felt like it needed more bloody mary mix. 

The menu was a bit overwhelming because we were starving but I went with the Racy Tracy and shared the Queen Maggie. 
4/5- Racy Tracy: Mushrooms, cheese, bacon & avocado, served with your choice of toast & potato spuds. The potato spuds were SO GOOD. The entire table enjoyed the spuds. They were very crispy and perfectly seasoned IMO. 
3/5- Queen Maggie: French toast with cream cheese filling & strawberries and bananas. Not the best french toast I've had, but not the worst either. The cream cheese was hard. I think it would have been better if it was cooked longer and the cream cheese was softer. 

We did not pay attention to the time because of the time change and the clocks were an hour behind. Our server, Teddy, was attentive and didn't give us any mean looks even though we stayed past closing time. In our defense, there was another party that came in 10 minutes before closing!",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,0,0,5,EwXq3OmIuzXcFtm3xazwJQ

They sat us at a 6 person table because the tables for two that were empty, were filthy. There's no busboy obviously and the two people there are going crazy with all the responsibilities.  It took a while for them to take our drink order and asked for half and half milk and Splenda and never got it.  We couldn't understand why they wouldn't have that already at the table like most restaurants.   We got tired of waiting because we saw the waitress doing something else and we got fed up with the service so we just walked out of there.  Too many smiles from the staff but zero sense of urgency. Even when they saw us walking away they didn't stop us or ask us anything, they just didn't acknowledge it, they were probably thankful.  I don't blame the staff there but the owner needs to step it up and hire more people.

It takes a lot for me to give any place 1 star, but the customer service was horrible. After we got our drinks, it took 17 minutes (yes I kept track), before anyone came by to take our order. And it wasn't even busy. $22 for a crab omelet and $13 for French toast. Denny's even has way better French toast. Theirs was so dry and tasteless. 

I tip well and base it on service only, not the food quality since it's not them cooking and I would of given them nothing. But my boyfriend feels bad so he left a few bucks.

3455995,2017-04-07,2,I1gRYCt2exnOMsTr-lEJVA,"Where to begin.... I'm a bit disappointed in this place, considering the amount of great reviews this place managed to get. The service was mediocre to absent and the food was just merrrrr. I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict and my friends ordered a monoukian mind melt with sprouts and avocado ($1.49 extra) and cream of broccoli soup, twice baked scramble with no sour cream, and a Route 66. I'm not sure what was wrong with the kitchen, but no ones order was right except mine. 
My eggs Benedict was nothing special and pretty standard amongst all other places. My friends cream of broccoli soup was cold, which was inedible and cold enough that it looked as if had curdled. They offered to reheat the soup, but we kindly declined and instead asked for fries instead. The mind melt came with no avocado and sprouts, so we tried to hunt down a server. Looking for a server was like being a 5 year old child lost in the mall looking for your mom or dad. It took a while for the avocado and sprouts to come. I'm sure that they had to wait for the avocado to ripe, so that was probably the reason why it took so long.  My friend's twice baked scramble had sour cream on it, but at this point, we gave up. The Route 66, is now a literal statement on why it is called 66. It should be called route 666 because it tasted like hell. After almost finishing our meals, we still haven't received our fries yet. We had to remind another server to let them know we didn't receive our fries and ended up taking it to go. I know our server felt bad and he ended up apologizing. I don't think it's the server's fault, but the kitchen staff is really to blame for this disaster. I'm not sure what the excuse is because on our receipt, everything was on there as how we ordered our food. Until the kitchen knows how to read orders and make the food properly, I will probably not go back again. With the price point they offer, I feel as if it is way overpriced for food that you don't even fully receive. There are better breakfast places with competitive pricing and better quality food.

My favorite dish here has been the Eric burrito, however I do wish it was bigger since it's on the smaller side. I also like the Suzie's Chicken Sandwich for lunch. If you are looking for a healthier option, the DJ's So Cal Low Cal and the Shi's Super Food Scramble are pretty good and filling. 

The worst dish I had here was the Queen Maggie French Toast. Inside the flat pieces of bread were several chunks of plain cream cheese. I had to take them all out since I don't know anyone who would want to eat a whole package of plain cream cheese between two pieces of grilled bread. If it was a cheesecake mixture, it would have been much more palpable. 

The ambience here is usually louder and more energetic, and it's a place for bigger families and a younger crowd. All in all, this place is a good local spot, but it doesn't have any special dishes that I would crave or go out of my way to come back for.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,0,0,4,gkYoXf-BKHrW_Qo4GzXNqQ

The hostess was gracious in letting us order coffee to sip on while we waited. Even if there was a wait, it would be worth it. Based upon my breakfast travels in Seattle a couple of months ago, you know I don't mind a wait for an excellent meal.

The first time you open the menu, or when I was caught late last night in my home office, looking at my computer, with a smile and my eyes glazed over while looking at their online menu, you suddenly realize deciding what you are going to order could be an issue.

We ordered the Racy Tracy California style omelette and the Bombshelter Bacon Benny. The ""Benny"" (Eggs Benedict) had three perfectly poached eggs, yes I said three which is perfect because two eggs are just not enough.

We checked in on Yelp and got a coupon for a free ""Drink"" so we had the Bloody Mary.

We were fortunate to have Allie, the General Manager serve us today. She and her staff were dressed up for Halloween and she is just a joy to be around.

Next time around I am going for the king crab omelette and will finish the meal with the chocolate bacon. Yes I said chocolate bacon.

First off, our wait for a table was 10 mins but it took over an hour to get our food. We both got French toast. The wife had Kay's Frenchie and it was pretty good, not amazing though. She had a side of spuds and they were sad. Just tasted like potatoes...no flavor, no seasoning. That kinda blew my mind. 

I had the Queen Maggie and was pretty disappointed. From the looks of the pictures and the Food Network favorite endorsement I was super excited. It was some French toast, with a slice of cream cheese in the middle. Yes, a slice. Not stuffed and fluffy and creamy. And then some strawberries and bananas on top. I've had better stuffed French toast at ihop. I don't know how this is a Food network chef's favorite. 

The only saving grace was our server Chelsea. She was awesome! She was running around like crazy from the second we walked in the door. I forgive the hour long wait cause she was working so dang hard! She comped our mimosas and thanked us for waiting so long over and over. We loved her!

The decor is fun and I really wanted to love this place...but the sub par food will probably prevent me from coming back. I find it hard to believe these are the recipes being served at their original flagship location.",3vVyzNzz4zkvyWtGjJ37tA,2,1,3,aniKCs8EVQEuOt8IQqmfsw

Not only that but they had baskets with small toys for them to play with at the table! Genius!! I wish every restaurant did that! (My kids couldn't care less about coloring.) 

Our server Amy was the best! She didn't even bat a lash when my 1 year old decided that he wanted to start playing catch with his toys/silverware and the floor... the floor didn't want to play. 

We got our food promptly after ordering and the portions were big! My teenage daughter ordered the French toast and bacon and said it was delish! I ordered an extra side of bacon for myself and the toddler and we can attest to that!

My 4y ordered the grilled cheese (they make it just the way you like it with choices of bread and cheese) and a fruit bowl with melons and berries.

And I got the Cobb Salad. It was wonderful! It took my some time before I even found the lettuce underneath all the toppings!

I just can't seem to get behind an omelet that has sautéed apples and bananas in butter and honey and peanut butter sounds really crazy. I had something called a Donnie something or other. It was a pancake filled with fruit sautéed in butter and you have the option to include cream cheese and sausage inside it, I asked if I could just have the cream cheese in it and have the sausage on the side and I'm glad I did that. Sausage was pretty spicy they also have real maple syrup which is hard to find in these parts. I also wanted to try the chocolate covered bacon. I personally was not a fan it was very chocolatey and it was cold. Everything else I had was to my liking I would definitely suggest getting cheese on the potatoes because I think without it they would be pretty boring. I keep hoping that one of these days I'm going to like mimosas I had something called a hi-mosa which had orange juice cranberry and champagne together. In terms of Breakfast cocktails even though I just do not like champagne this was actually probably the best one I've had. My man friend had a Cobb salad which was pretty big and he had a bloody Mary very spicy and he drink every last drop of it. The couple we went with have been there several times and they always say the food is very good and they like their food as well. I have a party of four we went in at 11 we had a fairly long wait I feel but it's a really small place. Originally they were going to try to squeeze us at a really small table we opted to wait for a larger table in all fairness.  I wish I got the biscuits and gravy because they looked so good .

What prompts me to finally write the review is the experience we had today. We took our kids for the first time. It was quiet, since it was early on a Monday, so we didn't feel bad about subjecting our loud pre-schoolers to too many people. Unexpectedly our 4 yo daughter had a seizure, which we are used to handling. The couple next to us was surprised by it but very kind, and the servers were helpful, offering a cool towel and to-go containers for our food. A wonderfully kind patron even quietly handled our bill amidst the chaos.

First, service. Staffs here are impeccable. Welcomes you in the place as if you are invited into their home, gives you great suggestion, smiles at you even if you look like a hot mess...what a place to be. 

Food. I'm not fan of omelet of any sort but my friendly server suggested their top seller dish, Racy Tracy. Apparently it was featured on Food network so I wanted to give it a try. First bite in and I could not believe how good it was. Where have you been all my life? Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?  After half way of my omelet, my server had offered me three sauce options: creamy mushroom, tomato pesto or cheddar cheese. Are you serious? How do you expect me to choose from such selection. Ended up getting all three and all were divine. My favorite has to be the tomato pesto though.

Also got to try their chicken fried steak (not sure of its name on their menu). Love the home cooking kinda plate like this. Both gravy + chicken were on point.

Breakfast for lunch,
That's how I do it.
I dined at Squeeze In,
So I can review it.

All you can eat spuds,
and even the toast.
They're known for their omelets,
I liked the Hangover the most. 

Want bacon and sausage?
Oh Yes, please!
The Hangover's got it,
with a ton of cheese.

I really wanted to hate this place,
What did I just say?
If you're not happy with your omelet,
You don't have to pay.

That's their motto, 
I had nothing to lose.
They have a lot more to offer,
Just read the reviews.

They're omelets are awesome,
What else can I say?
It's definitely hearty,
and took my breathe away.

Krista my server,
was as nice as can be.
She kept my drinks full,
and took great care of me.

So, if it's omelets you crave,
Squeeze In's a winner.

My son had the kids combo with pancake (light and fluffy) and bacon (crispy, cooked perfectly, and very flavorful). I had the Racy Tracy omelette with avocado. My husband had the hangover Benedict, which was the special of the day.  Both dishes were flavorful and delicious. 

Our problem was not stopping there! We shared both the Nutella stuffed french toast AND their banana walnut pancakes.. Let me just say this.. Don't order either of these dishes and expect to ""just have a bite."" Both are so darn tasty, sweet and fat free (not fat free at all but that's what I told myself to justify eating both)! 

We are definitely coming back here. They have other locations but the service was great here. 
Their menu has so many options. It takes a while to decide what to try. My advice, sample a few dishes and share. You can't go wrong with any of them!

Serving a pile of dead flesh on top of a vegan order almost felt intentional! And, tasted like rot and barf in a single bite. My daughter received her vegan order, and our orders were placed together on the same ticket, so how does this happen?  Carelessly or intentionally! Obviously, you pretend to care about the animal welfare and the detriment to our planet caused by animal agriculture, but you're only trying to make a few extra sales. As I looked around the room, I saw nothing but unhealthy and grossly overweight patrons, schlepping about as zombies do, and that's when I realized, this is my fault! I will never trust another non vegan establishment. If your establishment really had any interest in making a difference, you'd at the very least stop selling cows milk, especially knowing all the plant based options available today! However, you didn't even go as far as to train your employees to do the right thing! Who really knows if your GF items are GF, who knows if you're serving up the vegetarian options on your menu??

4260061,2017-12-27,1,I1gRYCt2exnOMsTr-lEJVA,"If you want to splurge on breakfast, then, this the place for you! We went here for Christmas Eve breakfast. I wanted to use my birthday promo ($10 off breakfast or lunch- join the Eggheads club online, ***with triple points during our visit, yay!***). It's around the area of Fort Apache and Tropicana, in the corner of a small strip mall. There is seating outside.  

I checked out the menu (it's HUGE) several times online, and I was set to order a 'safe dish', biscuits & gravy with eggs, but then I saw the Garth Breakfast Sandwich @ $10.99, a triple-decker sandwich featuring sourdough bread with egg, cheese, and choice of meat- ham, bacon, sausage, turkey sausage, fat-free turkey breast, or chorizo, served with spudz (ENDLESS, btw, made in house). Mine was really good, so glad that I changed my mind at the last minute. And the spudz were delish. Seasoned and cooked to yummy perfection. Hubby got an omelet but turned it into a burrito (You can do that with any omelet- 4 eggs, BTW). Hubby ended up splitting, 'cause that's what we do (**but does not count as a split plate charge, fyi**). That burrito was so yummy. The salsa is made in house, too, and it's got a really good flavor. Our son got the teddy bear pancake, topped with fruit (he finished that first), a side of butter, and it came with a drink- he chose orange juice @ $6.79 (*for kids 10 and under*) for the whole shebang. I had a bite of his gigantic pancake, it was light & fluffy, just the way I like them. (Well, it was 4 servings, so yes, we had leftovers, and our son had them the next day, too. We also asked for Spudz to-go, yum.) So, yes, large portions here, and I think that the split plate charge is $1.99, includes additional side.  

Lunch looks like a variety of sammies, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and alcohol is served here (mimosas for breakfast).  

Our server, Andrew, was the best---he was super nice and attentive. He also asked us if we wanted to try some other sauces for the spudz- cheese, mushroom (this one was my favorite!). All of the other employees were nice, as well. There were a few other customers (OK, we were checking out other people's food), but maybe we got there before the crowd? We were seated next to the baking rack that had the markers to use on the walls, the little toys for the kids, and the (good kind) to-go containers. I went into the bathroom (single stall for each) to wash my hands, and it was really gorgeous (the colors of the tiles, kind of mediterranean). I didn't take my cell phone or else I would've totally shared a picture of it here.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,5,PJ7lnQBap4uTITu3QLzy6w

Each page gave a variety of pictures and detailed descriptions - making it difficult to make a decision. From the Racy Tracy to the Manly Morris there were so many options to choose from. I decided to order the Quintana (Foo) - eggs, turkey sausage with french toast and a side of potatoes. Although the turkey sausage was a little more greasier than I expected - the portion of the french toast was huge but delicious. The sugar was just sweet enough; the side of potatoes were crunchy. I was amazed by the huge portion of side potatoes I was given. The service was quick and polite. I ended up signing up for a card membership and was given a scratch ticket to use for my next visit.

Open for just over a month on Fort Apache near Tropicana, an import originally from Truckee California but since expanding to Reno, Sparks, Redwood City and now Las Vegas, Squeeze In promotes itself as offering the ""Best Omelettes on the Planet"" and having bested Bobby Flay en route to franchising opportunities a first look at the concept shows a restaurant willing to have some fun while still taking the right steps to be successful.

Differentiating itself from the pack by way of design as well as offerings, the menu one of those multi-page affairs that at first makes experienced diners cringe but quickly reveals itself to be intelligently crafted to use a limited number of ingredients in creative manners in order to create hundreds of types of Omelettes and Sandwiches plus some Skillets, Griddles, Soups, Salads and more, the décor at Squeeze In is best described as a ramshackle array of hippie nostalgia, everything from records and bicycles hung amidst road signs with cutouts of Aliens displayed prominently as customers are also invited to scrawl their own art on the walls.

Open at 7am daily and reportedly packed to capacity from nine o'clock until closing on weekends thus far, it was just after 7:15 that entry was made to the place where 70s and 80s rock plays loudly overhead and greeted by a cheerful hostess before being handed off to a young man named Andrew the waitstaff was unexpectedly excellent, the restaurant apparently already generating regulars greeted by name while everyone who entered was treated to service with a smile and beverages frequently refilled.

Not afraid to brand itself and embrace social media, the Egghead Club and #squeezeinfun prominently promoted with ""points"" offered for dollars spent, surveys and online reviews, it was after lengthy perusal of the menu that an order was determined, a $5 welcoming coupon plus free beverage by way of Yelp! bringing the total to just $25 after tax and tip for a substantial amount of food.

Joking with customers in a jovial way while pouring cup after cup of good coffee roasted by Reno's  Blind Dog throughout the stay, it was perhaps fifteen minutes after ordering that plates arrived from the kitchen and with Free Wi-Fi available to pass the time as everything from Golden Earring to The Scorpions played first bites of the ""Jack Johnson Pancakes"" more than lived up to the billing as the Buttermilk four-stack was still fluffy despite a liberal dotting of Walnuts beneath a layer of melted Butter and Honey-kissed Bananas.

Having brought 100% Maple Syrup from home only to realize that Squeeze In steps up their game by offering their own at a supplementary cost, Queen Maggie French Toast proved a bit less impressive than it could have been since the quick sear had failed to melt Cream Cheese in more than half of the six slices, though the dish still remained a winner based on the Bread quality and the Eggy Custard in which it was soaked.

Finishing up with a respectable oversized biscuit, the somewhat flattened oval in no way indicating a lack of flavor, though a lack of layering sees it fall short of the Valley's best, suffice it to say that leftovers are likely to follow most diners home from a breakfast at Squeeze In, an average family of four probably quite safe to share two entrees and be perfectly happy strolling out the door.

FOUR STARS:  Already out-performing several of Las Vegas ""best"" breakfast spots in terms of scene, service and selections, Squeeze In enters an already busy scene with big aspirations that it seems ready to pursue with diligence, a few minor tweaks likely all it needs to see continuing lines and ongoing success.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,6,4,zXMR7EqVcpm8TFRni2nSwA

The wait was 20 minutes - not bad. I think my only minor complaint was it was so bright in the room and you could barely feel the a/c - the 3 of us were hot the whole time. We all checked in so we got a free drink which was part of their yelp special. We ordered the queen margaret french toast with fruit and cream cheese inside, the montana spanish breakfast platter, the banana walnut pancakes, the eggs benedict and the racy tracy.

The first experience was good, a solid 3 stars. Food was good, service was mostly good. None of the hiccups were deal breakers so my friend and I decided to return yesterday for lunch. When I walked in, 2 ladies were working on something on the computer and it took them a few minutes to greet me and get me a table. Our server was a really gracious man and took good care of us, despite some issues in the kitchen. It took the food a long time to come out and when my friend got hers, it was completely wrong. Her turkey sandwich had zero turkey on it! We chalked it up to almost being closing time and people wanting to go home. All in all, this is a decent breakfast spot but the overall service has been spotty both times I've been in.

The menus is HUGE, I ended up only looking at the omelette section as that seems to be their claim to fame. I wanted to get the Racy Tracy but my husband ordered it. So I put myself out there and got the Cathy Who - ham, bacon, cream cheese and bananas sautéed in honey and butter. Yes folks, that was an omelette. I was skeptical but it was better than expected. It was actually good. I would say I prefer the the Racy Tracy as the flavors were more familiar and I'm a sucker for avocado.  These are 4 egg omelettes that are stuffed with ingredients. Absolutely STUFFED. We took leftovers home.

One of the highlights would be the mimosa flight, 3 glasses of mimosa with different flavors. We chose mango, orange, and pomegranate/pineapple. There was plenty of champagne and honestly each glass was the amount of a champagne flute. All for a total of $11.

The low for me was the biscuit. It was a biggest larger than my hand, but it really didn't have much flavor. I had one bite and that was more than enough of that.",zQk1bdjUXwktAyDUfrE0dA,0,0,4,LkbrsU-UHSeFFuqyI7EUZw

We really did love this place, but with its growing popularity came a severe decline in service, and taste.  The breakfast potatoes are flavorless, where they were once part of the highlights. The food wasn't hot - the cheese on my burrito wasn't even melted. They forgot the ham in hubby's omelette too. Every time we have a poor experience I convince honey to give them another chance. We even spoke with Andrew about our experiences last time we were in. I'm pretty sure, with the plethora of breakfast options out there, we won't be back for awhile.

The place definitely has a cool and quirky vibe to it like customer writing all over the walls and home-style kitchen tables that made it feel personable. 

Be prepared that the menu is huge - seriously so many different options! We ordered the Spanish Flay omelette with turkey sausage and the Queen Maggie French Toast. I'm glad our server let us know ahead of time that the portions are ginormous and that I would definitely have some left overs after (she was right lol.) 

We also checked in and received free mimosas with our order, which was a great perk! I got the Hi-Mosa (champagne, orange and cranberry juice) and my bf got the the Hibiscus (cranberry juice and champagne). I totally agree with another reviewer who said that the drinks are 98% alcohol and 2% juice; you can definitely tell that they are generous with the amount of alcohol! Haha 

Overall we had a great experience and the customer service was great. The food is definitely on the pricier side but still worth a try!",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,1,3,3,jOdW0YivMn9FK6yVmBna8A

Hubby had the chorizo scramble (something Aztec). Thryblet him grt all thrbdipping sides hr wanted. So he chose nacho cheese, tomato pesto, and green salsa. I had the special burger with swiss cheese, mushrooms, and avocado, and side of garlic French fries.

Both dishes were great! It was hard to eat my burger on account of everything always falling out of it. But hey, ""if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face"" reminded the hubby.

Even the wheat toast was super good. But probably because it was drenched in butter. You can never go wrong with buttered toast with strawberry jam. 

We ended up signing up for a rewards card or something. It gives you free cocktails next time and 10% off your next meal I think? But we'll be back. So we'll put the card to good use.",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,1,1,5,bVKg5eC0zx0gF2gELuOlZg

First, I love the ambience here. Writing on the walls, stuff hanging from the ceiling, aliens, vinyl records, my favorite music (classic rock and music from the 70's).

Second, the friendly and genuine staff. The wait staff is so knowledgeable about the extensively long menu and their recommendations have always been on point. 

Third, their menu which hit home as the hot chocolate features my sister's name (not a common name). During our last visit, our waitress recommended pineapple, mango with a splash of pomegranate for our mimosas. Glad we took her suggestion, knowing the staff has never let us down. A friend and I shared the Jack Johnson banana pancakes (short stack), two really large pancakes with melted butter, pecans, and, of course, bananas. The crunchy pecans gave the pancakes a wonderful texture. Impressive. For my main meal, I had the Huevos Montana and, again, took the recommendations which included cheese and onions on my potatoes. The food is so pretty, you almost don't wanna eat it. I definitely ate it. The recommendations to the plethora of choices makes this dining establishment even more fun and creative.

They do have an awesome atmosphere, great service and even toys for the little ones to play with!",gt_fQPHizea_s4jw6Whm7w,0,0,4,vP9BjJaa55wTJj72ZMEXWA
