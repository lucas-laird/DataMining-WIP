The Mrs and I stopped in after a movie. We started with spicy garlic edamame and spring rolls. The edamame was good and flavor was acceptable but nothing memorable. The spring rolls were fresh but lacking in flavor. The peanut sauce added to them but didn't impress. 

I had the tonkotsu ramen which was bland and didn't have any of the usual depth. The pork was lacking in flavor and the bamboo had no crunch at all. The soft boiled egg had been soaked in soy and was too salty. The Mrs had the pad Thai which was the least impressive she's ever had. The signature pork fried rice was the least flavorful I've ever had. Even the pork belly on top tasted like a generic piece of meat. 

The bright spot here was service. Our server was attentive without being pushy. He gave reasonable suggestions but overall just an overpriced let down. Probably won't return.",a88IGZ0P0YRXePKi0UKARw,1,0,2,lyLbXd0VRpgOu2jIIJWHQA

I've been searching for a restaurant that served good vermicelli in Las Vegas for two years. I found it! The meat is well seasoned, the portions are fair and the prices are good especially considering that they're located in a casino. This small noodle house serves not only Vietnamese but, Chinese and Thai as well. The decor is clever and eye-catching. I wouldn't recommend this cute little place for large parties as it only seats about 50 people. I rated this restaurant at a three because the service is SUPER SLOW! It really DOESN'T take 30 minutes to prepare noodles. Needless to say, I'd come back. Hopefully they improve on the speed.",oOlzp2cnVaDzRDazuSYPPg,1,1,3,-sPo3rfULZsvxT5vtpW8XA

Most of the dishes were all different types they had Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese. I went with my family after the movies. We ordered 1 noodle soup, pad thai, and pork fried rice.

The wonton soup didn't come with noodles so we had to add noodles. They tasted like the Ramen noodles. Even though there was a difference in noodle texture the soup was really good. The pork fried rice was much better, the pork meat was so soft and so tasty. That was something I would go back for again. The pad thai was okay I got mine with chicken. A great surprise for me it had tofu in the pad thai. The taste wasn't all there for the pad thai but it was okay for a place that is Asian fusion.

The service was great, the hostess was very friendly we got a table right away. The server Carlos was friendly, he checked on us more than 3 times which makes me happy.

272393,2015-02-05,3,-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ,"First off, I am not rating the food at all.  The food is 5 star, pretty excellent.  I always get the signature fried rice and the shrimp toast and it is pretty spectacular.  This review is for the customer service ONLY - WHICH IS ONLY GIVING A HALF STAR - LUCKY FOR THIS RESTAURANT THAT YELP WONT ALLOW JUST HALF A STAR.

I have been here 5 times, and the first time was the ONLY time that I got good (not great) customer service.  Since the first time was good, I brought my husband my next go round.  TOTAL fail on the customer service - they put out the entree BEFORE the appetizers and they did not bring both entrees as the same time either.  I asked to talk to a manager - the manager said that he will email management - GUESS WHAT - I never heard anything back.  This place is totally mismanaged.  The third time I was here alone for early dinner so I just sat at the bar.  I timed it - it took them 7 minutes just to get me a soda, and another 18 minutes just to get my signature fried rice.  Mind you, the place was not crowded. Did I mention that this place is mismanaged?  Just making sure.  Since the food is soooo good, I keep giving this place a chance.  My fourth visit I just got food to go - so I guess it wasnt bad since I didnt have to endure the poor customer service.  The last time was the funniest - I was there again for early dinner (like 5ish) so there was barely no one here - maybe 10 customers total.  I am sitting at the bar just waiting for my food - this couple walks up the hostess' bar.  GUESS WHAT - they wait there - I kid you not - for 10 minutes to be seated.  Guess what the hostess was doing?  Clearing tables and serving food.  The management needs to know about the poor customer service that this place has.  I mean, its at the red rock - one of the best hotels in Las Vegas and they have this?  THEY NEED TO REDO THEIR CUSTOMER TRAINING -MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THIS!!!!!!",Wpr_EbRY9ABBnqrHS0Ad2A,7,0,1,7t2o7McUh1lcW1mu0-8EGw

It's a small restaurant in the Red Rock casino and opened I think in December. We were seated promptly and the restaurant was almost full. It took about 10 mins before a wait staffer appeared but once he did he provided us excellent service, I watched as he was extremely busy, always on the move and never wasting a minute standing around as I noticed a couple of the other waiters doing. We started with the Mochiko chicken appetizer, it was very good with a slight crunch and mildly sweet garlicky flavor. Next was the Pork Belly bao which was delicious in a super soft bun and finally  I had the chilled vermicelli noodle bowl which was good as I find most of the grilled pork in these types of noodle bowls either not ""grilled"" or  too sweet, the pork was grilled and had a mild sweetness to it, the only thing lacking in this entree that kept it from being perfect was the fish sauce flavor, it had none that I could detect in the nuoc cham sauce. My partner had the wonton soup and found it to be good but not memorable and could have used a few more wontons in it as it only had 3.

I was really excited about having a restaurant so close to home that serves tonkotsu ramen but like so many others mention in their reviews, do not expect ""tonkotsu"" ramen.  It's definitely a shoyu-style broth not at all resembling what most would consider a tonkotsu broth.  Even beyond the broth, the chashu pork that goes with the ramen is not at all the melt-in-your-mouth texture it should be.  

On an opposite note, most of the fried rice offered here is delicious.  So during your visit, opt for the rice rather than the noodles at this... noodle bar?",bm8JuOM_H0QVostioA-PRw,2,0,3,fye7hlQiekSJwn0l2zagYA

Their pork belly was stringy, almost undistinguishable from the bamboo. Broth was incredibly oily. Servings were way too large -- definitely quantity over quality.

First off the hostess, the first impression you get of a restaurant, was unfriendly, didn't even bother to ask if we wanted to dine here as we walked up to the hostess stand, she just kept her head down and ignored us.  Only when we tried to seat ourselves did she actually noticed us and then just made us sit somewhere else.  Bad start.

Menu was as I expected for a ""Noodle Bar"", a menu trying to cover a vast number of asian cuisines.  We ordered the shrimp toast, gyozas, tonkotsu ramen and shrimp pad Thai.

Shrimp toast, well more water chestnuts than shrimp, they just drizzle it with a siracha aioli and straight up Japanese mayo....could've definitively done without ever tasting this.

Gyozas, filling was quite bland and I hate when they use the thick wonton wrappers they used here as opposed to the proper thin ones.

Ramen noodles only came as thin asian noodles not Ramen noodles.  Broth was straight shoyu base not at all tonkatsu.  And I'm pretty sure I had more pickled ginger then I had noodles in the dish.

Pad Thai was pretty dry and the shrimp and noodles were way over cooked.  

Besides the hostess the service was really mediocre having to wait extremely long periods of time between ordering, drinks, food and the check.

I'm looking through all the reviews and yes it's a new restaurant but for God sakes give it another chance....have to have an open mind! 

Ambiance-When my friend and I walked in I felt the hominess in the area, although a smaller place then what I expected, it still had that Asian theme that I liked, especially the  bars made out of bowls...pretty clever. We were seated promptly by the hostess who was very friendly and the service was top notched! I couldn't ask for a better service that was always on top of things and making sure we were taking care of!  Also, the manager and even the chef came out to make sure things were okay (which a lot of restaurants don't do). Give you BIG props for being so personable. 

Food-Wow! That's all I can say. I don't know about the reviews but I could tell they have improved a lot.  Time to list all the tasty food and comments below: 

Spring Rolls-Fantastic! It was rolled perfectly, ingredients didn't fall out when it was dipped constantly. And the sauce...great peanut sauce w/ a touch of hot sauce. Perfect balance. 

Grilled Beef Short Rib Bao Bun-Wow!! I'm very surprised at this dish.  Perfectly cooked beef w/ a touch of ginger saki sauce. It also had pickled red onion, it's pretty sweet for my liking BUT the balance with the sauce and meat brings out a sultry mix.

Pork Belly Bao Bun-Some reason this was my favorite! I think bc I love fat...and fat is good! Lol. I love the spicy mayo (although I dislike hot stuff) and that wasabi sprouts! Yum 

Signature Fried Rice-Okay....maybe this was my favorite! Lol. Maybe bc I love fried rice and I never experienced a poach egg on top! Great mixture w/ scallions and furikake.

Tonkotsu Ramen-Think this was one of the best ramen I have had in awhile....and that's saying a lot especially having quite a few here in Vegas at Chinatown. Perfectly balanced soup. Not too salty but just right. Ramen of course was fantastic and my favorite having poached eggs! 

Five Spice Beef Soup-I have to admit I'm not usually a big fan of the thick noodles, this soup kind of surprised me! Soup is well balanced and the brisket just tears softly and is like butter in your mouth. Definitely give this soup a shot even if you don't like the thick noodles! 

Drinks-I recommend the cucumber martini. Seriously.....don't ask just order and drink the night away! 

Overall, awesome experience and will definitely go back again! Great improvement from the reviews I've seen in the past.  Awesome staff, chefs and management.

The bibimbap was a fun dish with pickled vegetables and the best kimchi I think I've ever had. 

They have a few fun cocktails. I tried the cucumber martini - refreshing!

Because she sat some more before us. So our 20 minute wait turned to 45. When we asked the hostess about this she didn't remember seating those people. We complained to her about the situation and how we were upset and she did not care. My wife went to another restaurant Mercadito and asked if they could seat us right away and about are situation..

While she was doing that I asked for the manager. When the hostess told the manager that I wanted to talk to her she rolled her eyes as I was a bother. As I explained to her the situation and that we were regulars and how we have been treated thus far she did not once apologize. While talking to her she did even look me in the eyes half the time!  She didn't try to make it better she kept telling me she wasn't aware of the situation. She thanked me for my complaint!!  Maybe if she would come out of her office she would know!!

The broth was a bowl of thin liquid devoid of even the slightest hint of pork flavor in any spoonful. I swear it was simply tan colored water with a slight sheen of some sort of oily substance masquerading itself as the expected pork fat goodness one finds at an actual ramen bar. Even the pork belly itself was as flavorless as the broth...it had the texture of actual pork but failed to provide even a tease of flavor. The noodles were white...that's the best I can do with that. The eggs were there pleading to be released from the embarrassment of this $12 bowl of a ramen imposter. The only flavor came from a teaspoon of shredded pickled ginger haphazardly strewn in there where it most certainly did not belong.

We used to have to go all the way to the strip for a good bowl of noodles, now it's just right under our feet. We ordered to go so we could eat lunch poolside. I made a quick check in and my Mom and I went straight to the pool while my Dad ordered for us. Right before we went outside I noticed my check in got us free edamame, so we went back to get them. The guy taking my Dads order said that they only offered that for people who dined in, lame. My Mom was also bummed she couldn't get her lychee martini, she said she tried it on their last visit here and it was her favorite. 

We sat by the pool and Dad brought our lunch. I ordered the pork sauce noodles. I was kinda hesitant in ordering them because no one really talked about them in the Yelp reviews, but it just sounded really good and I love udon. Since it was to go the noodles and veggies were separate from the pork sauce. Once I put them together it was heaven in a paper bowl. Add some chili paste and kimchi and it was perfection. The pork sauce made the dish, it was thick and almost jelly like. It coated the udon noodles and made magic in my mouth. The fresh sliced cucumbers and green onions balanced out the bowl and brought much needed crunchy texture.  My parents got the pork steamed bao buns, which were fluffy, spicy and dissolved in your mouth. I am very surprised by all the low reviews.

FRESH SPRING ROLLS: Apparently they listened to the reviews about the pork spring rolls, now only shrimp is on the menu. The rolls are large with gigantic shrimp, and an ample portion of peanut-Sriracha dipping sauce. Could use more mint and less vermicelli noodle, but solid.
DUCK BAO: Server recommended this because of the crispy meat. I did not find the meat crispy but I did find the bao itself well-made and fluffy. This was a tasty small bite, order is for a pair of buns, but unfortunately you are not able to mix and match with other types on the menu (short rib and pork belly).
SHRIMP TOAST: I've never had this dish elsewhere but I wasn't a fan. A frozen bread-shrimp brick was heated on the flat top, topped with a barely-fried (runny whites, ew) egg and a few drizzles of sauces, and presented. Didn't finish this, wouldn't order it again, but it just might not be for me, as other reviews recommended it.

Waited for about 25-30 minutes on a dinner rush. We were eyeing the empty seats available at the bar and wondering why the hostess wasn't going down the line asking the guests how many were in their party to seat appropriately. Then about 15-20 minutes in the hostess went down the line and asked and then we were seated.

Menu is very straight forward. Appetizers, Bao buns, rice dishes, noodles, and additions.

My friend and I ordered the following:

1. Shrimp Toast - packed with great flavor! Not overpowered by the sauces. Great compliments to all the components. The simplicity of the dish made it felt homey and comforting. My suggestion would be if they served it with a knife to cut the bread if there was more than one person. But if you're dining alone go right ahead and use your fingers!

2. Shrimp and Pork Gyoza - due to us taking pictures it got cold but even cold you could tell these had great flavors. For those size queens and people that like to complain about size and the price, these are larger than the ones typically found in Asian restaurants on Spring Mountain. 

3. Duck Bao Buns - duck was crispy. I just wished there was more duck skin! Their housemade sweet chili sauce didn't over power this simple dish. Otherwise it was a good replacement for not getting the pork belly Bao because we were already getting the pork belly bowl. 

4. Pork Belly Bowl (added soft poached egg) - if you get this you need to please do yourself the favor and add the soft poached egg! That creamy yolk is a great compliment to the sauce that the pork belly was cooked in. Add a little bit of the furikake available table side and a little bit of soy sauce and you are golden!

Now for the ones complaining about desserts, yes it's not available (printed on the menu). But do you people complain about the hidden In n' Out menu? No right? So stop the complaining! Just ask politely ""Oh do you have desserts?""


1. Raspberry Crepe - sold out! Will try again next time.

2. Chai Tea Custard - the chai tea spice made this stand out! Very light dessert if you have the room. (I apologize both of us are falling in to a food coma so we are running out of adjectives and descriptions to use)

3. Mango Cake Roll - makes me want to punch you so much in the face! Nice light and fluffy. Compared to the other jelly rolls in Asian places this was the best I've had in a long time. Down side, mangoes are not in season but if they have this available when it comes in to season I will definitely be back to order this!",-RWHoFxUURZ4TvEdZRieiQ,10,1,4,zdB_veaQ8xVHTdQaRogcvw

Wait staff and hostess were very friendly and attentive. Table settings were lovely for a lunch meal. Fresh and contemporary feel.

I am a vegan and usually can find lot's of options in any asian style restaurant. There were 2 selections on a very sparse menu. I ordered the pad thai. This was probably THE WORST pad thai ever. They used vermicelli (thin noodles) for this dish instead of the customary wider noodle. My lunch partner had ordered the pad thai on a previous visit and asked the waitress about this. She said the thin noodle is what they always use. This was not accurate. The sauce was sweet and oily and tasted like it was out of a bottle and not freshly made. There was way too many onion slices which would have been more pleasant with the traditional bean sprouts (which there were very few in this dish). 

I would never recommend this restaurant because there are so few vegan options and the food was over done with sugar, salt and oil. So glad we had a coupon to cover the cost of this barely satisfactory meal.",gRBnMm0uB1-nekt8xyOyLg,1,0,1,VXng7Q-vdTxv1gFZ9wftMA

The Food: 
I love rich flavors so the pad thai and kimchi rice bowls were my favorite. I loved the bite size pieces of bacon in the Kimchee rice bowl. I wanted to see more Kimchee on top of the bowl for us Kimchee Lovers. 
I am also an avid broccoli lover and wish the pad thai came with broccoli, I simply asked them to add broccoli, exclude the added sugar, and add extra cilantro for color and flavor. Delicious!

The Service:
I am totally impressed with their flexibility in the kitchen and front of house. Not only did they custom make pad thai's to respect my gluten free wishes, they took the time to check in and the sous chef, Susan, walked to our table and spoke with us directly. She was friendly, interested and shared with us her knowledge of the food we were eating. 

The hostess and waitress also supported us as we switched from the bar to a table in the middle of our meal, it was easy.

it was past midnight and our options were few; cafe or noodle place.
noodle place it is!

this is what we ordered:

one each of the bao buns; crispy duck, pork belly, and short rib.
my favorite was the duck.  i really enjoyed the plum sauce, the duck was crispy yet tender, and the scallions were really fresh and flavorful.
the other 2 were also very tasty and paired well with their accoutrements.
i enjoyed the bao itself too as it was very fluffy, not at all dry.

agedashi tofu
flavored well but the breading was way too thick to be called agedashi.
it should just be called fried tofu.
still good though.

spring rolls
pretty standard here.
i like that they're made to order and not just sitting in a cooler so that's a plus.

special pork fried rice
this was yummy cuz it was dirty.
what i mean by dirty is that it was flavored with all the yummies from the wok.
that is my kind of fried rice!

all in all, it was a good meal and the service was good as well.
yes, it was a little pricey but it's in a casino so that should come as no surprise.

We were seated at 9:50 PM to a somewhat busy restaurant however much of the people had already been served, and we proceeded to order the gyoza, tonkotsu ramen, and the Peking duck fried rice. It wasn't until 10:30 PM that we received the $8, four piece gyoza which was actually quite good but by no means extraordinary. They were decent size and came with a ponzu sauce with a very strong and overpowering presence of ginger.

My friend who had received his tonkotsu ramen a little after 11:00 PM described it as ""pretty, but very bland"" and that ""the noodles were knitted together as if from a plastic packaging,"" which I witnessed to actually be the case. 

Nearly an hour and a half into the endeavor they brought out the Peking duck fried rice which the waiter had described having ""6 ounces of duck with some pieces mixed in and some more on top."" Unfortunately this was not the case. The ""peking"" duck was cut unrecognizably into tiny, chewy pieces without any seasoning or even a general resemblance of Peking duck. It could've easily been unseasoned, dark meat chicken and still tasted to same. The fried rice itself was very average for the price of the dish and I personally found it flavorless.

To be fair, I should not have expected much from a Peking duck and fried rice costing $14 at the Red Rock-- and in honesty, the large portion size was a bit redeeming. The only way to describe the overall meal and experience is ""bland and unfortunate"".

There have been times I've seen the crowds go through and kept the place fairly hopping, but I wasn't sure if it was the food, the drinks or the atmosphere. 

Well, now that we've made our second visit, we know for sure.  It's definitely 'all of the above,' but emphasis on the FOOD. A mix of Japanese and Thai cuisines, this place will become one of your neighborhood faves. It certainly fits that category for us now!

I cannot begin to rave enough about the apps.  The gyoza - great little tender meat dumplings with a killer crispy outer exterior; the crispy egg rolls, piping hot and full of porky goodness complimented by fresh slivers of carrot, cabbage and other veggies - and the steamed short rib bao buns...MON DIEU!  

It almost becomes too much to ask to save room for the 'main event' - your choice of several soup or noodle bowls.  The Five Spice Beef with thin, juicy slices of tenderloin and fat, chewy Udon noodles, in a tasty broth with Chinese Five Spice as its main flavor booster...that's just ONE of the choices you have.

Our waiter, Bobby, expertly steered us through our first visit, and made some excellent recommendations. We'd like to be seated with him every time we go, but even if that doesn't happen, all of the wait staff are great, and no worries about waiting forever for your food.  The cooks make it fresh to order, so you'll be pleasantly surprised at how quickly everything comes out.

Both were very good.  The shrimp toast consists of rock shrimp, fried egg, water chestnuts, scallions, spicy mayo,  and eel sauce.  An absolute delight and blend of flavors.

The 5 spice beef soup consists of brisket, beef broth, choy sum, udon noodle, cilantro, chili, and lime.  The 5 spice was a wonderful flavoring to the beef broth.  The chefs put the soup bowls in hot water before filling them with broth or noodles.

Service tonight was as good as it always is.  My server was Gerardo and once again, I did not have to ask for an iced tea refill.  My glass was refilled automatically.  Another thing of merit is that they coursed my meal unlike many Asian restaurants.  They waited until my shrimp toast was done and I had a few minutes to just sit.  Then my soup was prepared and served.  That really is a plus.

I enjoy sitting at the bar as I dine solo.  I can watch the cooks do their thing right on the other side and have a show with my meal.

Came to 8 Noodle Bar twice this past summer, the first time being on the July 4th weekend where we lucked out with a room discount at Red Rock Hotel &Casino.  For being the newest eatery in the hotel at the time, we just had to give it a try!

But eh, I've kinda had better Asian food.  At less fancy places.  

Décor at 8 Noodle Bar is nice, very modern vibes, with an open kitchen and dining area.  I like how they used the noodle bowls to decorate the front!  But, upon second glance and being seated, the dining area is a on the small side.  Some of the tables up against the wall are a a bit close for comfort when multiple parties are eating.  The couple next to us were so close we could hear each other's conversations!  Luckily they were nice people and we were able to exchange pleasantries with no fuss.

Back on to the food.  It really is a mix of sorts from all over the globe with the focus of course being Asian.  Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean cuisine is all highlighted at 8 Noodle Bar.  I love me my Asian food so I had a hard time deciding what to eat!  Wifey and I ended up sharing:

-Crispy Egg Rolls ($7) - pork, carrots, cilantro, and lime egg rolls served with romaine lettuce leaves, bean sprouts, sliced chili peppers, and various dipping sauces

-Grilled Beef Short Rib Bao Bun ($8) - ginger sake reduction, cucumber, and red onion

-Veggie Pad Thai ($10) - rice noodles, tofu, egg, bean sprouts, assorted veggies, peanuts, and lime

Everything came out on very well presented platters.  But for me, servings seemed so small!  Especially for the price!  You can give me a larger plate of food for less money, and keep your ambience!  That is my major gripe here.

Food overall was OK.  I forgot a pic, but our first orders of Crispy Egg Rolls we had to send back!  Upon my first bite, there was a long HAIR within my egg roll!  Yes, inside of it!  Besides totally being grossed out, it was immediately taken back into the kitchen.  Our server was nice enough not only to ask us if we were alright, but to ask if they could make us another order of egg rolls, hair-free.  Not only did they do that, they also took the charge for our egg rolls off our bill.  Good of them to do that.  That being said, our second batch of Crispy Egg Rolls were tasty!  There's only 3 per order, but they are a bit larger than ones you'd find in your typical Asian eatery.  They were good wrapped in a lettuce leaf and topped with some hot chili sauce, but I found myself looking for that amazing fish sauce/vinegar dip you find with Vietnamese egg rolls.  I also wanted some hoisin sauce as a condiment as well for these.  I probably should have asked.

The Veggie Pad Thai was also good, but again the portion size was lacking.  For the money I was hoping for more noodles!  The pad thai was flavorful, and had a healthy amount of broccoli in it (which isn't all that common in pad thai I know).  It was hard to pick out the tofu in it though which was in smaller amounts.  It had some great crunch though with the addition of the crushed peanuts on top.

The Grilled Beef Short Rib Bao Bun was the star of the night!  But, of course, I wish there were more than 2 on the plate!  These were delicious!  The short rib was fall-off-the-bone tender, and succulent with whatever sweet/savory soy sauce-based glaze they cooked it in.  The tart and crunch that came from the pickled red onion & cucumber played well off of the soft short rib.  The buns were nice and supple too!  I love me some supple buns!  Steamed just right, airy and not dry at all.  I could have eaten a half-dozen of these and been a happy man.  But at $4 a pop, these were some pricy buns.

Overall an average first experience at the 8 Noodle House.  I enjoy the fact that Red Rock Hotel & Casino is trying to cater to the Asian folks (no, Panda Express in their food court does NOT count), and it is a good effort.  There's still some kinks to work out, like portion size!

I had a light lunch here on Thursday, 1/14/16.It is a well lit and attractive space, directly adjacent to the Grand Cafe.The hostess immediately assisted me,asking whether I prefered a table or a seat at the noodle bar. I opted for the former.My lovely and pleasant server,Lilliana, took my order promptly.Her service was excellent. Menus were on the table already. Station should adopt this policy broadly since order taking at their Grand Cafes has been lackluster on more than one occasion on my current visit.

I ordered the Wonton Soup ($14.00) which arrived promptly with a nice assortment of shrimp,chicken, thin-skinned and well-filled wonton,mushrooms and broccoli. The restaurant provides a nice array of dry spice and wet condiments. I chose the chili oil. The broth was well-flavored, with a perfect balance between blandness and saltiness. The soup was delicious.I washed it down with a 20 ounce Sapporo Beer. It was smooth, tasty and a perfect complement to the soup.

The food menu is somewhat limited but the variety is great!  I will definitely return and look forward to bringing friends and family here when we visit Red Rock!

Positives
1) Food is excellent.  Recommend the Edamame and Crispy Egg Rolls for appetizers.  For main entree I chose the Signature Pork Fried Rice and it was superb!  My wife chose the Spicy Shrimp Noodle bowl, she was delighted!
We also tried the Hong Kong chowmein noodles, they were cooked differently than traditional chowmein but we enjoyed it.
2) Ambience and decor are very modern and well done.  
3) Service was top notch, friendly, and efficient.

Negatives
1) The dining room is very small so I imagine when it's busy the wait could be extensive.  We had lunch and didn't experience a wait but as we were leaving there were people lined up waiting to sit.  I can only imagine Friday & Saturday nights are crowded so get there early!
2) Location is right off the casino floor with an open wall so the noise level is on the high side let alone everyone walking by staring at your meal out of curiosity.
3) Menu is quite limited with selections so check out the menu on Red Rock website or before you get in line to make sure everyone in your party will find something they would enjoy.  It would be awful to wait in line only to find nothing appealing once you get seated.

This place, carved out of the Grand Cafe next door, is relatively small for a casino restaurant, brightly lit, pleasingly modern, with an open kitchen and a fairly limited menu.  

We usually don't order appetizers, but the couple at the next table were sharing an order of gyoza.  They looked delicious, so we did it, too.  (So much for New Year's resolutions).  The dumplings, filled with pork and shrimp, were plump, perfectly cooked, and very tasty.

My husband ordered the Five-Spice Beef soup - brisket and thick udon noodles in a delicious beef broth that was spicy, but not overly, and the meat was very lean.  I had the Spicy Shrimp over vermicelli rice noodles.  The shrimp weren't gigantic, but big enough so that the five of them filled me up.  I loved the noodles, too, but there was enough to feed a family of four, so a big portion of them came home with me.

Here's the first recipe I've ever published on Yelp:  The leftover noodles filled a 2"" deep pie dish halfway up.  I beat up 3 eggs, poured them over the noodles, and baked until done, about 35 minutes, at 350°.  Then I covered the top with a layer of satay peanut sauce (from Trader Joe) and put the dish back in the oven for another five minutes, till the sauce bubbled.  It made enough for two big servings (this time with a salad).  The $14 for this dish went a long way.  Such a deal!!  :)",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,4,4,y_Vnx5AuRWDokR1TiFmGrg

-Spicy Beef Noodle
-Tonkatsu Ramen
-Gyoza
-Spring Rolls

Not sure what they are trying to do here with the Spicy Beef noodle using udon? Please don't try to fuse a traditional Taiwanese dish using Udon. Only flavor that dominated the bowl was salt. Tonkatsu Ramen had a clear brown broth. Again, not the Tonkatsu I know......but then again, I'm not a ramen connoisseur but had different and tastier versions around town. Salt was again the dominant flavor. Before anyone says anything, I do realize Tonkatsu is salty, but in the other ramen houses, you do taster the pork flavor permeate. The best items were the appetizers.....sadly.

If you want a more flavorful noodle experience, go around the corner to Downtown Summerlin and visit Rice Republic. Or, you can walk 80 or so feet to the Feast buffet and get a bowl of the udon in the Asian section of the buffet.

I'm Thai so I love trying pad Thai in new places and it's not a real pad Thai but tasted amazing. Spicy shrimp is not too spicy and more moist which is weird in a good way because you'd expect try noodle to served dry but they serve it moost with a little bit of spicy sauce.

I am a stickler for duck. No matter where I go I always get it. Today I ordered the duck bao. Not very traditional Peking style since they do not have the capacity for it but great flavors. I will always get it. The skin is crispy and makes me wish they had duck skin as an add on! The sauce I'll always crave it since they make it fresh. Not overly sweet that it over powers the duck. A great compliment to the duck. 

Always a second must-have for me is the shrimp toast! I don't know what it is but it's a staple for me when I come here. Soft toasted bread with rock shrimp and the sauces (I feel bad for not having asked what they were) but I practically inhaled it! It's that good. Upscale homey and it works. Very comforting for this weather.

I know it's a noodle bar and I did not get the ramen this time. But I get it again and again: pork belly bowl with an enhancement of a soft poached egg. Dont get me wrong, their fried rice is great and all but I go for the simpler things: white rice meat and egg. The sauce that the char siu pork that is cooked in is always consistent. Great balance of flavor and perfect amount for the size of the bowl. To round it all you YOU MUST have the egg. My friend tried it last time without the egg but when I gave her my own bowl she ordered an egg to go with hers.

I had been wanting to try this place out for a looong time but hadn't been able to. So we sat and the hostess didn't really want us there. Then the server didn't really either, he wasn't rude but you can tell he had preferences between guests. He went to the people that were next to us about five times and he only came by us twice. Including the people to the other side of us. 

The food however wasn't very good we both had the pork rice bowls. The pork hadn't been cleaned whats meant to be trashed was in my plate as food. You cant also tell it was the cheap kind of pork. Eww. Terrible.  

Also had the pork buns which were actually good but again they weren't cleaned. Rather would've had the spring rolls or even the wonton soup for a the full dinner.

Its also not a thing of mine to review drinks but I had a mountain dew and that was $4 we had two of those. Which meant I paid $8 for 2 sodas. Ridiculous. Seriously, not worth it but good enough to try after all this time of wanting to come by here. 

Service was also very slow. No just noooo. I mean I really wanted to like this place but the pork sides really need to be cleaned off. That's disgusting. $44 for two people and would have been a lot less had it not been for the $8 sodas. Again stupidity to pay that much for two sodas. I would have stopped at the gas station and boughten a drink there for $3.50 less. 

Sorry yall to work on the prices and food. Also service wasn't rude but he was in the kitchen most of the time how would he know if his guests need anything if he's always in there. 

Also the place was small and you can tell they really force people in there. Need to take out at least 1 table per section. I could hear what everyone else was talking and eating they were about less then 2 feet away from where I was sitting. I could hear how much their dinner was lol...

Unfortunately, most of these options are nothing more than average. 8 Noodle Bar is no exception. It's a fun little set up and definitely has the aroma of a noodle stop that could be good, but alas it's largely forgettable.

-Shrimp toast. I see a lot of people saying this is good and I will say that it was definitely the best thing I had by far but still it's basically just an extremely salty piece of bread and eggs. It lacks balancing that's the key issue.

-Spring Rolls. You know when you get something and you see the plate right in front of you and you say to yourself ""I already know exactly what this is going to taste like."" That's exactly what happened. Spring rolls that were fine but indistinguishable from probably any other standard spring roll in existence.

-Vermicelli. This is where things really went south. This was a HUGE bowl of food and looked like it had potential. Noodles, pork, egg rolls, etc. It was packed. But man was this bowl a bland pile of nothing. It comes with a sweet chili sauce and boy does it need it. The problem then is that the sweet chili sauce is the ONLY thing you can taste. That's not a shot at the sauce that's a shot at just how flavorless everything else was.

I see reviews of all kinds of other items on the menu and some are very positive so I am willing to concede that maybe it was an off night or item. However, when there's a guy who claims his dish was better than what you can get in Hong Kong (looking at you Christopher N) it's hard to take the positive reviews seriously.

We ordered the pork belly bowl and it comes with only two pieces of pork belly no bigger than a hot wheel and rice. Of the pieces of pork we did get the quarters of the biggest piece was just fat. The pork belly is also not a traditional braised pork belly there is a lot of sweetness in it.

We also ordered the shoyu ramen which smelled amazing bur actually tasted very bland. As you drink from the bowl you think the soup will be amazing from the smell coming off of it only to be disappointed by its lack of flavor.  

Lastly we ordered the buns two each of the duck and pork belly. These weren't bad but different probably because I like more traditional tastes. Both had spicy mayo on them which made it really sweet and the pork belly was super greasy.

To sum it up, if your going to come here get a pork belly dish as the flavor from it will make your experience here more pleasant. If you're going to come late in the night they stop seating at like 11:30 though they choose at 12, but you can at least get take out.",yt77UjK4CQA8nvEKTEhptw,2,0,2,4togvFUPx3-rRFr9WJd3Rw

5845952,2017-11-07,2,-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ,"TL;DR:
Crappiest noodles/Asian food place I have ever been to in my life. Avoid this place like the plague. I have only thrown up from the taste of shitty food twice in my life. This was one of them.

This is the first time I have ever had Thai Ice Tea that is made from a powder. For $5 you get a synthetic tasting mud water. 

I thought it was a safe choice to go with salted Edamame, but boy I was wrong. They probably mixed batches of them in the back making the inconsistency of these Edamame's was unbelievable.  It is like playing Russian Roulette. I didn't know if I was going to get a raw, crunchy bean, or an empty shell. Either way I was going to lose. They only salted the first 4 pods on the top.

I also got the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodles. FFS this was the biggest disappointment of all. 
Cons:
1. I have never been to a place where you ask for extra noodles they put it in your soup until this place.
2. Tonkotsu Ramen should be creamy and rich, but the soup base tastes like it's from a god damn powder and browner than the crap that comes out of your butthole.
3. Chashu slices are thinner than any deli meat I have seen. How do they get it so thin? Their cost efficiency is off the charts. You do want it to melt in your mouth, but I think they got the wrong idea of how to do it.
4. The ramen noodles are whiter than a porn star's bleached asshole. Noodles tasted like it was overly cooked at a low temperature over a long period of time. Probably longer than the soup base.

Maybe they got the recipe mixed up and cooked the noodles at the soup base time, and the soup base is cooked at the noodle time? It would explain a lot.

Pros:

(Nothing)

*Side Note: It is sad that 1 hostess, 3 servers, and 4 cooks struggle to serve some 20 odd people. There is no busboy, the hostess busses tables. This place should apologize to every citizen in Fukuoka, every customer served, and the ramen itself for being a disgrace to tonkotsu ramen. Service was passable but not memorable.",Q3_SHSsOVwdgBzovw8Vy3A,2,0,1,iqTtaKD7eDXVf3Pz0znaYQ
5893061,2015-07-07,2,-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ,"After 2 visits here in one weekend, I can say with confidence that I expected more and was slightly disappointed. One standout was the shrimp toast appetizer, which was a refreshing surprise and quite tasty. Nice presentation with the egg on top. 
The fried rice with sausage & red jalapeno entree was fine but lacking that special flavor I was hoping for. For $8, it's a large portion and served hot & fresh. The second meal I had was the Shrimp Pad Thai and I asked for a 5 level of spice which it wasn't. I had to add chili sauce. The dish was fine but again lacked that yummy flavor I was hoping for! At $14, I was disappointed. I would return for a third try and see if the flavors improve!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,2,3,udtW7U-vUZUB0w7d5MHhjQ

The SERVICE however, horrible. I read reviews prior to this and it all made sense. Definitely not worth our time to wait forever and then to be seated and feel disrespected to. We'd rather take our money and hungry selves to a smaller place with better service. 

Work on it!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,2,0,2,eITRhbjMQ4usySFuDgnY_w

My drinks, the Bombay Sapphire based Cat's Pow (not paw) and Lychee Martini, were excellent. Try the pork fried rice and add pork belly and red chiles.

5919751,2017-08-16,0,-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ,Food is pretty tasty.  I've tried their chicken appetizer and it's very crispy and flavorful.  The spring rolls are come out fresh when ordered.  Their ramen is not quite up to par than the one I go to in San Jose.  It was a bit bland.  Their mongolian beef is served with rice and is not too bad.  The chicken teriyaki bowl is also not too bad.  If you check in via Yelp you get a free edimame appetizer.  The place is pretty busy so we've only sat in the bar area but it's pretty cool because you get to watch the cooks.,6eml0Mw8NglMn2GCyJzi-w,0,1,4,gVArKTuea5xArTv3kZMJ-A
5920820,2015-12-09,0,-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ,"Limited menu , artificial demand by long lines and waiting time to be seated or to order due to The poor design of the place ...
Long wait for the order too

The kitchen and the hostess are busy with 
to go orders galore. 


From observing They are short handed in this small space and the hostess works as a waiter too.  To go menu is over priced you better go to Panda Express  behind the corner food court.

We were served and stopped to take a bite due to mixed orders... Yes they are busy running after their tail


Ordered few entrées but lucky the whole room ordered fried wings so he divided in plates and got them out ---but rest of party had to wait...and wait and wait. It took almost an hour to be served so getting drunk on empty  stomach is an easy way...water refill is not on the list of required hospitality service ....over spicy food overall.


We been over an hour waiting but watching some other tables of people that came long after us
And they received their order in 15 minutes?


Be aware of the service as this is not a typical Las Vegas I know",BgTEmV6LRcbtb-TK9JI6vA,1,0,1,XPIXxlec2YY0NekdhfiH_w
5930320,2017-02-19,0,-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ,This place used to be my favorite spot to go to. But over the past few months it went downhill. They changed their recipes for a lot of the items on the menu and it just destroyed the quality of it. The food is not as flavorful as it used to be and now it just seems over priced for what you're getting. We just had a very bad experience with the waiter as well. He lied about how much money we gave him to pay for our meals and he didn't want to give us any change back. It's sad because like I said this place used to be our favorite place to go to eat at red rock. We are definitely not coming back.,yBrQpRq7cequDl7Xh0rNWA,2,1,2,XdmXW0mAyg_e6l3mCYrMfA
