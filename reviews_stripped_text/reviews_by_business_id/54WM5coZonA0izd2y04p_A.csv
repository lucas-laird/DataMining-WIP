The hostess was polite she sat us down.
Mind you, this restaurant wasn't even busy. It was a family before us. 
Back to the story. 
Our server was Marina, seemed scared to even talk to us. We ordered from the Happy Hour; Nachos and Rib Tips. My sister and I can't eat onion. We asked her does anything have onions, she said no. 
A couple comes in and they are sat down as well two tables down from us. The first family, my sister and I are just seating down looking at one another confused  what's taking so long. Well, our server and another server are just at that third table that got sat down. 20-30 min pass by we can't even get attention. Thank god for the hostess, she tells her, hey I think your food is ready... Our server yeah yeah yeah I'll get it soon. Hostess brings out the food and goes to the server, doesn't even move or grab the plates just pointes at the our table. Hostess gives us our food, sees I need a refill, server then comes ask is everything ok. Doesn't even let us answer sees I need a refill just leaves. So now the hostess and server bring me two cups. Its ok I'll drink it I don't care at this point. So rib tips are good up until my sister finds a hair. We get to the nachos looks like throw up. We go through it find onions. Im like wtf at this point. Servers are at this third table talking talking and talking. I want to leave at this point. So our server walks by I raise my hand and tell her can we have our bill please. This is were she acts nice oh please take your time.. I'm just like really? Anyways I know bad service when I see it! Actually you can feel it. It was wack, just because we ordered Happy Hour and water doesn't give you the right to treat us like nothing. What happened to customer service? Doesn't that matter nowadays?

I'd have to disagree, their BBQ is pretty darn good. 

The portions are very generous. On monday's, they've been having children's menu selection for $0.99 which is perfect for the little one's. Plus, you dont have to feel bad if they dont finish it. 
My husband and I split the ""que for two"": chicken, 4 bones,brisket and 2 sides. The brisket is YUM! Chicken and Ribs are just as good! We could not finish the meal, tastes just as good the next day too! =D

I do have to say that this last visit the service was lacking.. I'm not completely sure if the server we happen to have was new, but she took quite some time to take our order and refill our drinks. She actually had 2 tables leave right after ordering their drinks because of the long wait.

My husband & I (hesitantly) decided to come here for dinner. It's the location by 215/Flamingo next to the LVAC. There's lots of open seating & the service was very prompt. Shout out to our server, Mike?, he was so awesome & really took care of us.

We ordered the appetizer sampler that came with fried catfish, chicken tenders, boneless (or you can get bone-in) wings, rib tips, onion rings & 4 sauces (BBQ, blue cheese, remoulade, & a sweet chili). It was delicious... I think we made ourselves full from that alone.

There was a $3 off deal for the brisket plate, so I got that & hubby got the chopped pork plate. All plates come with a corn muffin & two sides, so we both got the famous fries & Mac n cheese with an extra side of potato salad. Let me tell you when the plates came out, it's a LOT of food! ... well as I mentioned earlier we were probably full from the appetizer, but it's still a good amount of food! Both meats sit on a slice of white bread & OMG the cornbread muffin was warm, steaming & deliciously sweet. The mac n cheese was packed w/ flavor, but I'm not a fan of the corn in it. Potato salad was just your average, not over the top amazing. And the fries were thick cut wedges.

On to the meats... they were MOIST, which is usually a big issue for pork. But they were super moist & don't need any BBQ sauce unless you're that person that likes it slathered. Very delicious!

Would definitely recommend coming here!

Review for 12/23 - Came here for lunchtime but brought the family along as well since we had such a good experience at DINNER. Sorry to say our lunchtime experience was upsetting. We ordered the Family Platter that feeds 4-6 people. The chicken was still bleeding & pink inside so we asked for the manager. The manager said, ""That's bone marrow.."" ... bone marrow is in the bone & isn't pink or bleeding. Anyway, our server kindly replaced it for some sausage links. To our dismay, they were burnt on one side. Again, we asked our server to replace it & he did while throwing in a few more corn muffins. 

Sorry, but the lunch experience wasn't the best & could use some work. Will be coming here for dinner from now on.",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,0,0,5,QfIMRxjpVTo43Cq_TkhsMA

Well I have to say from the minute we arrived I knew I made a good choice. The hostess was very nice. Even though our friends had not yet arrived we were seated right away. 

We ordered drinks, they kept checking back to see if we wanted appetizers or refills. 

The food was good. I am allergic to pork so I had to watch what I ordered. 

My BF and myself ordered the feast for two. It really is enough for 3 or 4. They put the ribs on a separate platter for us. BF said ribs were very good. I thought the chicken was good, loved the coleslaw and fries. The brisket was fork tender. Our friends had ribs and really enjoyed them.

I have ordered the mac & cheese, baked beans, french fries and side salad during my two visits. The side salad is about the only side that I have enjoyed. Perhaps it's just my personal preference, but I didn't enjoy the jalapeños in the macaroni, I didn't enjoy how runny the baked beans were and the french fries could have used a little seasoning. 

The barbecue chicken sandwich I ordered, however, was awesome! They have various barbecue sauces at the table that you can add as well. My lunch date had the ribs and I got to try those too... also really good. Oh! I almost forgot, the cornbread is pretty good too. 

I'm not sure what I was expecting... when I think barbecue I think of a fusion of southern and soul food. I had never tried macaroni with jalapeños, and was open to it... but once I actually had them I realized why no one that I know had made them. 

So! In conclusion... rhe service is great and the barbecue is bomb - which is why you'd be visiting Famous Daves anyhow... just have an appetite for some interesting spins on the side dishes.",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,1,1,3,jFHAiPEBa3QKQg4zWwTsww

I personally love their St. Louis style BBQ ribs, which is very succulent, and absolutely fantastic tasting.  The Famous Dave's BBQ sauce is also a lot sweeter and definitely one of the better BBQ sauces.  It's more like Kansas City and Texas, and less like the vinegary North Carolina style.

I applaud that the interior and exterior is decorated perfectly in an unabashed country backyard BBQ fashion! Typically there is a very short wait before you are seated and the joint is pretty big and able to seat quite a large number of customers.

The items I have had from Dave's include the brisket, ribs, jalapeno macaroni and cheese, corn bread, and I have sampled their brownies. I thought that the brisket and ribs were Dave's strong suit as they should be at an establishment such as this. The meat was moist and tender with just the right amount of BBQ sauce and of course if you did need more sauce, several different kind of BBQ sauce bottles are available on each table. As for the jalapeno macaroni and cheese I have heard everyone rave about, I was not that impressed. Don't get me wrong, it was good! Unfortunately it was not my favorite mac n' cheese I've ever had. The cornbread was decent and on-par with that of Cracker Barrel's, if I had to compare.

I got two dinner combos--a Georgia chopped pork with the sides of Wilbur beans and garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  The other combo was a Texas beef brisket with sides of potato salad and Dave's cheesy mac and cheese.  Both came with a corn  bread muffin.

We enjoyed the dinner, perhaps because it was a different kind of meal for us.  It was quick.  I didn't call the order in but went there and ordered at their To Go section.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Customer service was very good and I was soon on my way.

The only thing I regret is all the plastic used for take out.  Some recyclable, some not.  I think another time, I'd just go and eat there rather than bring home so much that will end in the landfill.

I'll be back but I need to try some of the other BBQ places in town including one recommended highly by Nelson Q.  He never steers me wrong.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,2,3,L1rtwa7Ug9P0resDarihkQ

At my work, we usually do our own thing for lunch Monday-Thursday and then go to lunch together on Fridays. This week, I got to pick where we had lunch, and I was feeling like some BBQ. So we decided to give this Famous Dave's location a shot.

I ended up splitting the 'BBQ for 2' meal with a coworker... $19.99 and got got ribs, chicken, and brisket plus french fries and two more sides of our choice, as well as 2 cornbread muffins. We got the baked beans and the fried pickles for our sides. I had never had fried pickles before trying them at Famous Daves. Wow, so good. 

When the plate of food came out I tried to grab a rib with my fork and the bone fell right off the meat, back onto the plate. I love that they have 5 different sauces on the table for us to try.

The menu is diverse and has a lot of American favorites on the menu from BBQ beef, pork, and chicken, burgers, fish options, and even salads.  My favorite items are the BBQ pulled pork and the catfish fingers.  YUMMY! I will almost always get one or the other almost every time I visit a Famous Dave's.  Hey, I know what I like!  They also have some great side items to add to your meal.  The spicy mac n' cheese is quite a highlight and delightful, if I do say so.

The desserts here are really pretty good as well.  My favorite new dessert is the Banana Pudding dessert.  It is really, really good!  I have to admit that it is at least as good or maybe even better than my mom's Banana Pudding.  Yummy for your tummy!
I also have to give props to Famous Dave's because they have Sweet Tea!  It is so hard to find Sweet Tea out West, so whenever I do, I am all over it like white on rice.  I love me some Sweet Tea!  Yummy!

St. Louis-Style Spareribs, a corn bread muffin, with two sides (we chose fresh steamed broccoli and grilled pineapple steaks)...  we were in hog heaven.  I normally can chow down a lot but was totally stuffed and we couldn't even finish our meal.  

Since it was our first time visiting, the server brought out a basket of potato chips and explained all the different sauces on the table.  I'm not a huge BBQ person, but it was fun to try all the different flavors and notice the nuances between each kind of sauce.

4500607,2015-03-02,0,54WM5coZonA0izd2y04p_A,"This is ABSOLUTELY the WORST Famous Dave's in town. Save your money and go to the one over on N. Rainbow; it's only about a 10 minute longer drive if you take the Summerlin Pkwy to the 95 N.  The staff over there is MUCH friendlier and infinitely more attentive.. the employees at the W. Flamingo location are beyond apathetic AT BEST.  

Expect to not have a single drink refill throughout your entire dining experience, oh and make sure you're well hydrated upon entry because it'll take them AT LEAST 15 minutes to get you your drinks in the first place, and that's only IF you're lucky enough to get acknowledged by your waiter/waitress within the first 20 minutes that you're there. 

I've been going here for YEARS now, and literally the past THREE times the service has been the worst of ANY restaurant I've EVER been to.. in a row!

1st time: I had a couple of friends in town from California and they wanted to go somewhere good for lunch.  I suggested Famous Dave's and little did I know that it would be the beginning of the end.  Not ONE drink refill throughout the entire dining experience.  We ended up ordering one of the share able plates and when the waitress could FINALLY be bothered to bring around our paycheck.. she charged us for the one that was more expensive!  My friend being the kind and non-confrontational person that she is, ended up paying the bill while forbidding any of us to make a fuss.

2nd time:  Came here with my girlfriend.  We were sat at a booth and waited for almost TWENTY MINUTES before ANYONE came over to take our drink orders or even acknowledge our presence after initially being sat.  FINALLY the waitress came over and took our drink orders; she wasn't apologetic at all.  We MADE SURE to order our meal along with our drinks since it was unknown if we would see our apathetic waitress again.  Our food came out, and since my girlfriend and I were parched we finished our drinks rather quickly.  There was a party of four sitting directly next to us; our waitress came and checked on them and proceeded to ignore us.  After we had finished our meal without any drink refills, we then sat around and waited for the bill for another FIFTEEN MINUTES before we finally decided to speak to a manager.  After explaining the absolutely terrible service, we then see our waitress approaching us with our two drinks, HAH!  Where was she 24 minutes ago?  It seemed as though she saw us speaking to the manager and ran back to the refill station as quick as she could.  The manager gave us a discount, and I wrote it off as a fluke despite the first incident.

3rd and final time:  We decided to go out to dinner yesterday after not having been to this Famous Dave's for a year (we were still traumatized from our last horrible experience here).  Upon walking in, the hostess/host was nowhere to be found, so we stood around waiting to be seated. We were seen by multiple staff members, and not a SINGLE person acknowledged us.  A family that had just finished eating their meal, whom had seen how long we had been waiting to be sat literally approached us and told us not to eat here.  Apparently their food was so terrible (they said it came out cold) that they had to send it back, AND they had terrible service on top of that.

I will NEVER go to this Famous Dave's location again.  I'm pretty sure anybody leaving good reviews are either friends/family of the staff, or the staff members themselves.

Save yourself the money and go to the one on N. Rainbow by the Best in the West shopping center.  You WILL thank me because while the staff at this location may be absolutely god awful, Famous Dave's food is still delicious at their other locations! :)",SYx7UXlCHyZSUwHiqF1YlQ,0,0,1,k-Ag7ZgAnUYp0N0I9ONmHA

I got to sample the different bottles of BBQ sauce with their homemade potato chips.  Loved the ""Rich & Sassy"" and the ""Texas"" sauce.  I ordered a sweet tea, and shared an order of the XXL Ribs (a slab of 12 ribs) with the mister.  For the sides, we picked cole slaw, mac n cheese, potato salad and it came with a cornbread muffin.  Mm--mmm...fall-off-the-bone, savory, and sweet.  We ordered the Famous Dave's bread pudding at the end of our meal.  (Not your average, sloppy bread pudding you see in the dessert section at a buffet).

Everything here is pretty good. If you haven't tried the Texas Manhandler sandwich (hot link & brisket) I recommend that you do. They come served up with these hell-fire pickles that makes any sandwich mouth-watering. (I made spam sandwich one day and ate it with some leftover pickles I had.. I ate about six of the sandwiches just because the pickles made them taste so good). The bread pudding is amazing. I don't even like bread pudding, but the one we have here got me craving for it ever since I first had it. Craved it so much that I couldn't wait til the next time I went to work, so I decided to try another place's bread pudding to satisfy myself. I took three bites but it was a no go. So i ended up getting one of ours that same night after my shift lol.

Anyway, I just wanted to write this review because on Father's Day, I heard one of my coworker's tables complain to her about how the ribs aren't fresh and how they come out so fast because we make them ahead of time.

Pretty much all the meats here are smoked, then thrown on the grill when its ordered. If you didn't know that.. you should have read the menu more. The smoking part is done ahead of time, of course, but nothing is really ready to serve until it is ordered. Everything the cooks do is in small enough batches that would be used up in an hour or two.. since like I said, we throw them out after the 2nd hour.

This place seriously serves up quality food. It's pretty impressive, especially because it is a chain restaurant. With over 3 years of restaurant experience, I've seen some questionable things done. Never once have I seen anything off putting here.",cYvO88wNlRc_gd03caBZ7Q,4,2,5,7W-SWw7-0CpNUl5OVEIhsg
4990871,2017-09-29,0,54WM5coZonA0izd2y04p_A,"Good food but excellent service. KOJO met my expectation as a phenomenal server and went above and beyond. He gave us a great menu tour and offered great selections along with with cooking techniques.

I did not feel like he was up selling me at all but instead describing very well and let us decide how we wanted to dine.

We went with the feast for one (1/4 roast chicken, spare ribs, and brisket) with corn on the cob, baked beans, Mac and cheese, corn muffins, and french fries. We also ordered the ""famous hour special"" (same as happy hour) barbecue spare ribs tips. 

KOJO started off by dropping off some homemade barbecue chips and proceeded to go through all of Famous Dave's signature sauces. From the sweetest to the most spiciest. I enjoy all of their sauces and ended up mixing their spiciest (habanero blend) with their sweetest for a nice balance. The chips were very crispy and well seasoned. KOJO also dropped a lot of knowledge and ingredients of each sauce... Creating an interactive experience.

Next our barbecue spare ribs tip dropped off. It was a very nice portion that came with fries for $6.99! I love how tender those pieces of meat where and kept dipping away in heavenly sauces.

Then bam! Our feast for one was dropped off. What a huge plate! Definitely shareable between two hungry people! The roasted chicken was crispy and juicy. No dryness to detect. The brisket was tender and served on top of a garlic toast. The baked beans were very sweet (a lil too much for me) and my guest loved the Mac and cheese (which had a nice jalapeño kick to it). The corn muffin was moist (not the best I've ever had) and the corn on the cob was alright. My only disappointment was the spare ribs were a bit on the drier side, not something I'd expect since the spare ribs tips and chicken were so moist.

After everything, KOJO suggested we take a survey to earn a free dessert which he was happy to pack to-go as we were too full to eat more. The banana pudding was delightful. 

Although we did have very few hiccups in food quality, I'd say the service has earned the 1 star from a 3 to a 4. Had we not receive wonderful service from KOJO, my rating would be a 3 star. I'd even go as far as a 4.5 because of KOJO.

I'll give it another shot in the near future!",f_z_JtNybp_0d0eWO75JUQ,0,0,4,aBjhZVf_k5CukZ7GUYD-uA

I looked at their website and the prices seemed good and I loved the side dishes so I figured I'd give this place a try today for lunch, and WOW I'm glad I did :-)  I thought this place was gonna have a walk up counter to order from and then sit down wherever you want, like any other fast casual place.  But I walked in and to my surprise it's a regular full service restaurant with a host, and wait staff.   The host pointed out today's special and when the server came over, she was pleasant but that was really about it. She wasn't rude or anything at all, but I mentioned I needed a little time to look over the menu because it was my first time here and that would be kind of a hint to her to suggest something really good or maybe tell me about the 5 bottles of sauces on my table.  I ordered the brisket basket with the mac n cheese and the baked beans. All I can say is yum yum yum.  My food wasn't drenched in bbq sauce (which is perfect for me.  I don't mind some sauce, just not a ton) The cornbread muffin was great, so was the juicy corn cob. I loved the 2 sides I picked. The mac n cheese had a little spicyness to it and the beans were flavorful.  The brisket was very tender and I even tried the mustard sauce they had on the table and that was the perfect complement to the meat.  I would DEFINITELY come back again. 

The only small drawback was, when I was finished I waited almost 5-7 minutes for my server to come by and bring me my check. She was no where to be seen anywhere in the dining room. I saw 4 other servers constantly walking around and taking care of their guests, but my server was M.I.A. As a restaurant manager I technically hold the other servers accountable as well because no one else came by to check on me.  

I always talk to my service team about always look around the dining room and help any guest in need and provide table attentiveness. This did not happen here.  But the food was great and I will definitely go back.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,1,4,cjsY-B55tg-O05xPnOsT0Q

We have been to Famous Dave's several times and I've always enjoyed their food. It's far from being the best BBQ but certainly not the worst either. Our last visit prior to yesterdays lunch was last September. My husband swears their burnt end appetizer is half the portion size they were before. Honestly, I don't remember but it certainly wasn't up to par to the $8.99 price tag. We usually order their BBQ feast that comes with a little bit of everything: Ribs, Brisket, Chicken, fries, coleslaw, corn, beans, and corn bread. It's plenty of food for 3 people to share. Normally I really enjoy the ribs and brisket but this past visit the brisket was really dry and unappetizing. The flavor was there but it sorely lacked the moisture and juices. The ribs and everything else were good though so I enjoyed that. The banana pudding is huge and definitely satiates.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,3,4,3,0kfhPI128d8PO6GIwg5sBQ

The fish was over-cooked and the ribs were tough while lacking flavor and tasted like they had been re-heated several times. Probably the worst ribs I have ever had.  Called the next day to report to the manager and they insisted that we bring the food back in for a coupon?  I obliged and after having the manger scrounge through our eaten food while questioning why there was not more uneaten food  I decided to take a pass on the coupon. Go across the street to Outback for better food and service. 

Not recommended.",FZqi9W6D8t9uqxFKhgvKzg,0,0,2,-8z1UeZS0QKJKQckekq8CA

The service was great and fast, and very friendly. The environment was comfortable and laid back. I always have a great experience here.",S2Y_oM0sBw6E729mxANEiQ,0,0,4,0S_429UpWUns2nib_omQZQ

They have a number of lunch specials, as well as day of the week deals. My mom opted for the full rack of spare ribs for $18,99 that comes with two sides and a corn muffin. For sides we chose grilled pineapple and garlic mashed potatoes. While we waited our server brought out their freshly made BBQ chips so we could sample all their sauces. She went over all the flavors and we sampled them all. 

Our meals arrived and the food was good. This is one of the better chains around and I would have no reservations about returning here for another meal if I'm in the mood for more BBQ, which is usually a rare occasion.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,4,gTuomZcWvn8NHRaQvA9qHg
