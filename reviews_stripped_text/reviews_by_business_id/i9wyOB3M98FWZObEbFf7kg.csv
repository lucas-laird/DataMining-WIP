Flanked by a waterfall, serving up cocktails, wine, beer, and typical pool bar grub  -- quesadillas, nachos, chicken tenders, burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, pizzas, salads, and fish tacos. All pretty reasonably priced -- $6-11.

Drinks are $10 for a 12 oz; best deal is to get a 32-oz in a sports cup for $15. Beer: $4; wine: $6.  Didn't like the Mai Tai, but mimosa and sea breeze were good. Also didn't like the kids' strawberry slush (plastic and fake tasting) Kids mojito was better ($6 for each is pretty pricer; $4 would seem more appropriate). 

But, it's great to enjoy a drink or bite to eat poolside on a hot Vegas day!

NOTE: Open to Tahiti Village guests only - you need a room key to get in.",Txa_sNMUSHfNzHwaV034fQ,5,2,4,0dWuQ6eFE3O2xrpMa6BqkA

I can see only having it open on weekends during the off season, but during summer (or when the resort is sold out) that should be open.  It's a real pain in the ass to walk down to the restaurant and get drinks there.",MuyG2pfN9KZTKyj1k33ITQ,0,0,1,rypdh5NyrQHfAO2Zc9HtWA
