The milk teas and flavored teas are balanced just right and are oh-so-refreshing! Their boba has the right chewy and soft texture and a bit of sweetness to them. Slightly different than your traditional shaved ice, their fluffy snow has its flavoring frozen in the ice, shaved into a mound of soft, edible snow, and then you get to choose toppings like fresh fruit and jellies. Never had their slushies or snacks, but I might give it a try another time.

197212,2010-03-30,0,0CB7YB1qRSWLQvMbHw3Fmw,"This place is very easy on the eyes. The decor is done in soft shades of blue and silver and looks very modern. I don't get to go all that often since I don't reside in LV, but whenever I'm in town I do make it a point to drop in. 

My mom really likes the Coffee Milk Tea and gets it once or twice a week on her day(s) off. She  first took my sisters and me to this place on one of our trips to LV and one of my sisters became instantly obsessed. She thinks that the Jasmine Milk Tea here is by far the best she's ever had. That's coming from someone who lives in the San Gabriel Valley and who has exposure to such drinks on almost a daily basis. 

I've tried a couple of drinks from here. The Honey Iced Tea and Green Tea with Aloe. I can say they are pretty good. They also have snacks to munch on. We've ordered the hot wings, popcorn chicken, and squid balls. My other sister thought the hot wings were really tasty. Their prices aren't cheap and each drink is onwards of $3 (I really can't remember the exact pricing.) They also give you the option of getting it in medium or large. I usually get medium because of the calorie content and to save money, but really just get a large! 

While waiting for your drink, you can peruse teen magazines such as Seventeen and Teen Vogue (both were staples of mine back in the day) along with the most recent Avon and Avon Mark catalogs. 

The workers are mainly females in their teens to early twenties. Unlike other boba places they speak English fluently so there definitely won't be any type of language barrier.

 This is just my opinion but the reason this place is good can probably be attributed to the chain having originated in Taiwan. After all, boba is most definitely a Taiwanese invention.",e7YqL66GjjTnKH3r0Na9IA,0,0,4,SqPMUWZdYpwAU0z7BdOJTg

My husband who has been disappointed by numerous local boba places over the past few years almost had a tear in his eye after the first taste of his drink.

Came here with my family on a Monday around 8pm. There were 2 girls working. We ordered a thai tea slush and a strawberry banana smoothie. We paid for our drinks, tipped the girls, and waited while our drinks were being made. 

When one of the girls brought our drinks out, we noticed they had made us a regular iced thai tea rather than a thai tea slush. We told her that there was a mistake - and she just had this look of pure annoyance. She didn't apologize for the mistake or even said anything to us after we told her there was a mistake. All she did was go to the register to ring us up the price difference - a whopping 11 cents! Seriously? You're going to make us pay an 11 cent price difference on a mistake YOU made AND after we tipped your rude ass already? Whatever - we paid the 11 cents and waited for her to remake our drink. After she was done making our drink, she just put it on the counter without saying anything to us and walked away. We grabbed our drinks and got the hell out of there. 

Seriously, I wouldn't have minded paying the price difference if the girl was nice about it. At least apologize for the miscommunication or something.

I don't know why their boba (tapioca) recently taste really bad.  I think it's not chewy anymore.  It's hard in the center and the exterior is soaked in water too long.  It's basically nasty.  I never get to eat fresh boba like what they used to make.  They probably changed the manufacturer of their boba.   I think i'm going to stop getting boba in my drinks and just get the usual mango green tea wihtout the boba. They used to charge 35¢ for boba now they charge 50¢ extra for boba as of October 2008.

They have tables there if anyone wants to study there. However I cannot notice the fact that they have white chairs and they never clean them.  You can literally see the black stains on the chair.  THis is a turn off for me to ever go there to study.  

Oh yea one more comment, the employees there are excellent.  They are very prompt when you first walk in, they will ask you for your order, and make it right away without hesitation.  They will stop doing anything and just serve the customers that walk through the door.  The owner which is a chubby asian female, doesn't have much customer service skills.  Often times, she is rude.  She doesn't smile, she doesn't say thank you.  All i ask is recognition of her customers, but i guess customers to her is just like............ the rush hour, GET IN and SHIP THEM OUT.

The Boba and various teas here are wonderful.  One of my favorite drinks would have to be the lemon-honey tea, because its a grownup-kid drink, like a Shirley Temple, full of booze.  

The store is quaint and clean, with some good music usually playing at an appropriate level.  On a nice day, you can sit at the table outside and enjoy your drink.  Service is fairly quick, and the plastic wrap on top of your drink makes it very convenient to take on the go.

Most decent boba shops are down Spring Mountain Road, which can get to be very congested and difficult to naviagte, but Easy Life Boba isn't too far away and the streets aren't narrow. 

I've been to the place enough times to deduce that the Thai Tea Slush is my favorite. Generally, I love the rose milk tea bobas but I think that the slush is better here. My friend also had tried the Lava Flow (I believe that is the name) and loved it because it resembled a piña colada with strawberries and boba pearls.

The only reason it's a four star is due to the fact that the snacks were alright. The shrimp ball was overly salted and the lobster ball wasn't as bad.

I know you're probably thinking, 'Why is she commenting on the snacks when this place is clearly meant for boba?' Well, that's because if they would like to put up the options of a snack then the snack should be pretty good but it was overly salty almost inedible. 

It might've been a fluke but the shrimp ball were just overly salty and the texture wasn't the most pleasent either.

Large Milk tea w boba and egg pudding and caramel- Let's start with the boba. It was not well cooked. It was mushy on the outside and hard in the middle. Definitely disappointed. The egg pudding was ghastly. It was way too soft. By the time it gets sucked through the straw, it disintegrates into a cottage cheese like texture. I almost wanted to puke. The milk tea had 0% tea flavor, it might as well have been water. And finally the cherry on top would be the caramel. They use the Torani brand caramel syrup. Yes, the same caramel syrup they use at Starbucks to flavor their drinks. I mean, come on. It was terrible.

I ordered their thai tea which was one of their top picks. It came out within a minute. The drink wasnt as cold. The drink wasnt as flavorful and tasted slightly watered down. Perhaps other flavors may save my review. Im definitely willing to go back to try something else and update this review.

The location is clean and the staff was friendly. I feel that the inside decor could find more of a central theme or character to draw customers in. 

I just feel like they have tons of potential to make this boba stop unique. Places like these should be upbeat and colorful. Id like to see this place really embrace what it means to be easy life for them. Seems like such a laid back kind of place, Id like to see more of that too.

actually, the thing that i am most enthusiastic about here is the customer service.  tonight i went and bought my usual thai tea fluffy snow and it came out messy and partially melted.  this didn't bother me that much so i just started eating it.  then.. the boss came out and took one look at my cup and started making me a new one (without me needing to say anything!).  i didn't know that he was already making me a new one until the meltyness started to bother me and i went to the cashier to complain.  with this kind of customer service, i walked out content and with two cups of thai tea fluffy snow in my hands.  yay!",Iqm6Ig0NcKXkwPsT2RyRwQ,3,2,4,YkoglGWfnbNCkZnaejG3fQ

I got the honey lemon tea, while he got the strawberry tea. My drink okay, not overly sweet, and had a hint of a rosy aftertaste, probably from the tea. His tea, however, sucked pretty badly. First they got his order wrong and gave him a strawberry milk tea. It would have been okay had his drink tasted good, but it tasted terrible. Despite him not wanting to, I forced him to take it back since it was their mistake anyway. They finally gave him his strawberry tea, but to his disappointment, it tasted like faucet water with an over abundance of sweetener. It was so bad that he threw his drink away after only a couple of sips. Maybe it's just us since we are used to the quality of tea we get at QQ boba in henderson, but this place really isn't worth coming back to.",75ZIgkBYYTvHdeUHcg3tMg,3,1,1,4yWc5mzc-ymH8zz__Qb95g

All the teas I've had so far have been really good. AAND you can get different types of toppings instead of just boba....like pudding balls or coconut jelly... And one of these days I'm going to try the Aloe Vera.

So located within a decent sized shopping area/strip mall lies Easy Life and go figure as we were picking up food at a restaurant next to this my wife yells ""BOBA"" and decides to Yelp it and from there the rest is history! 

I love how more and more the Vegas Yelp community is leading us to these hidden marvels and further away from dismal experiences on the Strip. Although the mom's and pop's of the world certainly need love too and heck most of the time they wipe the palette with world renowned chefs so kudos all around!

Although I didn't go in physically my wife kept rambling on and on about the variety of the menu and from looking at their webpage the menu does seem to include everything but the kitchen sink. Oh wait, I saw that on there as a slush with boba. Ha-ha! I do want to make an outing and try some of their snack items so perhaps this portion will be a pending review in the near future?!?

For the purposes of this review, I went again to what I refer to as my ""go-to"" drink, the taro milk tea. Quite simply, they know how to prepare this sucker right off the bat as it was one of the better ones I've had to date. I know with other locations back in California there is a disclaimer ""made to taste"", but it's more impressive when a place doesn't have to do that to pump out a drink. It was the perfect blend of sweet, but not overly sweet to give me the diabetic shakes. The boba itself was chewy which I admit I'm a fan of and the best think that stuck out was the freshness of the boba. At times I run into some that taste thawed out or maybe left out past its shelf life, but not here. 

If this is what the easy life tastes like then count me IN! This does make me feel much better knowing that when I am here in the summer months for one that there is a one stop destination for boba and boba accessories (I do hope someone at least gets the Hank Hill reference or I'll feel like a total nut case). 

I will see you very soon (mid April) for sure to continue with the bobalicious consumption and possibly a popcorn chicken/lobster ball outing as well!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,1,1,5,u7OflKcDxUQrBdiozc5mxg

No, not starbucks. (There will be a long ass line)
No, not Jamba juice (I have enough fruit in my life)

A boba drink! This is the only boba drink I enjoy. Most are over powering and syrupy. YUCK. I have found this place to make the perfect drink. 

You can get boba added to many of the different drink options. My favorite you ask? Chocolate shake with boba added. It only comes to 4 bucks and is crazy big. I NEVER finish it. Drink is always icey, yet creamy. They put a lot of boba but theres never too much. I still get a good amount of drink.

Favored drinks; medium is only 3 bucks and large is 3.50. They have many flavored drinks; Strawberry, Passion Fruit, Grapefruit, Orange, Peach, Grape, Kiwi, Lichi, Blueberry, Honeydew, Pineapple, Green Apple, and fruit tea. 

Milk teas come in different flavors as well; Jasmine,  Coffee, Almond, Pudding, Vanilla, Strawberry, Thai, Honey and more. medium is 3.00 and large is 3.65.

Slushies are better than 7-eleven. Probably because they have way more variety. Mediums is 3.25. large is 3.75. Next time I want to try the lemon. 

Whats best is they have a loyalty card. After so many you get a free drink. AWESOME

They have snacks you can munch on as you sit and drink or get on your computer. (yes free wifi) Popcorn chicken (3.99) cajun wings (4.59) chicken nuggets (3.99) shrimp ball (4 piece 1.99, 8 piece 3.89) Lobster ball (4 piece 1.99, 8 piece 3.89) Squid ball (4 piece 1.99, 8 piece 3.89) Fish ball (4 piece 1.99, 8 piece 3.89). havent tried them but they do look fresh and yummy.

That was a long bus ride for some boba and even when a car was procured - who had the gas money for that kind of trip on the daily?

I was a fool! I came back the other day for convenience when I was craving a treat and got my usual Jasmine Milk Tea w/boba and felt utterly blown away by how delicious it tasted. I had gotten so used to the taste of other establishments it was a completely rediscovered experience for me. I can't say they have the best boba ever, but I can say with absolute confidence their Jasmine Milk Tea is my favorite in Las Vegas. 

That being said, convenience is primary over atmosphere here! They really should have a drive-thru because they are not the first place I would want to stop for a chat. Usually, if I do stay and drink I sit on one of the two outside tables which are made of metal. Not ultimately comfy but good enough.

WHY: This is my new favorite boba spot! I have been convinced!

WHAT: After reading a couple reviews of this place, I opened up my google maps, and headed on a mission to get some 5-STAR boba!

I am a smoothie & milk tea with boba type of girl!! I have been looking for the perfect boba spot that I would call home, and I am going to have to say EUREKA, I FOUND IT! Haha.

The flavors I have tried so far were the mango slush, taro milk tea, and almond milk tea, and I stay satisfied! Not only were the drinks flawless, the boba was the perfect consistency!! Not too hard, nor too soft = just to my liking!

If you are extremely thirsty, there is a JUMBO size for additional $0.80! If that were me, it would take me an hour or so just to finish it! It already takes me close to an hour to finish the large sized drink!! The large also seems larger than other boba spots. The prices are really great for what you get back! Don't let your googly eyes fool you!! If the large and or jumbo is too much for you, it's okay because you can save it for later!

So I leave you with this- 
Drive, bike or walk there,
Order to your liking,

The atmosphere: You know, I think they should expand.  And advertise maybe?  I think they should become a place to loiter; not just purchase your boba then you're on the run again.

I really thought Kung Fu Tea had my soul with their oolong milk tea, but this Jasmine milk tea is serious competition. The jasmine flavor is steeped strong and very aromatic. Not bitter in the slightest with a wonderful floral aroma. The milk tea wasn't too strong or too watery, it was perfect.

My fiancé tried the original milk tea and it's tasty too! The boba was cooked fresh and still hot, so I sampled a little bit. Unfortunately, it was still too soft and mushy for my personal taste, so I opted out on the boba. I typically get grass jelly or herbal jelly to replace bunk boba, but they don't offer any jelly here, they do however offer egg pudding.

The drinks are awesome but my hugest complaint and why you don't see me frequenting this place is because their hours are terrible! I hate that they close so early - 9pm is just too damn early in Vegas.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,47,44,4,z78V4PNfbu-WwV5Sn9q_UA

I came in with my two kids for a treat and ordered a large coconut milk tea with pudding. The larges here are gigantic and really cost efficient. I love it! The three of us shared this drink and all got our sugary fix for the day.

The coconut milk tea was delicious and creamy and I LOVE PUDDING from boba places. I actually never get boba in my drinks because I'm not big on chewing drinks, but pudding has the most fantastic mouth feel and kind of just slides down your throat like silk. It's definitely pricier than boba, but really worth a try if you've never had it. I will be back, and my son will probably be able to try something with the fresh fruit he read about.

I order mostly from their milk tea menu, but sometimes get the slushies with milk too---it is not on the menu, but you can definitely order it. The fishballs are soooo good. I ordered them not spicy, but they still have somewhat of a tang to them.

I Ordered a Watermelon smoothie, a banana smoothie and a milk tea. All with boba as I love good tapioca. 

The Watermelon smoothie was pretty great. 
The Banana smoothie was amazing.
The Milk tea was slightly above OK. 

The tapioca was very good, not great.  At No 1 boba every time I have been there the tapioca is made fresh all day and has always been warm. This tapioca was still on the fresh side but didn't have the perfect consistency for me.  It was slighly tough.  I also find the fresh fruit smoothies(better fresh fruit to ice ratio) and milk tea at No 1 boba in Chinatown to be a notch above Easy Life. 

Where Easy life dominates is the service. It was friendly, they were cool and that  goes a very long way with me.  The menu and options are  plentiful  which is also a plus. The Tapioca and less than amazing milk tea are the key factors in giving it a solid 4 stars. 

I will be making a return trip to try out some of the teas and other items. I am a fan Easy Life I think  they can pick  their  tapioca and milk tea game with a little time and expertise, at which point I will be happy to update my review.

On a side note, I am so obsessed with the little plastic film lids they seal the tapioca drinks with at all quality boba spots. I see so many amazing uses for the technology. I would seal everything.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,1,0,4,6MLWcyekoKCxNUpBLyXPgg

I Yelped the nearest bubble tea spot and whaddya know, it's 5 minutes away with stellar ratings.  Well, long story short, I was not disappointed.

My avocado smoothie was perfect - fresh avocado, not too sweet, and perfectly cooked pearls (chewy and slightly sweeter than the rest of the drink).  I really enjoyed it from beginning to end, without getting sick of it.  I tried a variety of other options as we were ordering takeout for a large group, and every combination was good.  We also tried the strawberry banana smoothie, taro and pudding milk teas, and passion fruit with grass jelly.  All drinks were close to perfect and some ended up as great mixers as well.

My fiancé and I have tried both the almond milk tea and the jasmine milk tea. The almond has an almost artificial taste to it and I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, I'm just saying it's not for me. The jasmine milk tea on the other hand, is a home run and is truly enjoyable especially when paired with the egg pudding in place of Boba (we like our Boba a little firmer and it's  a bit on the soft and chewy side for me to enjoy.)

The staff here are always nice and never make you feel rushed even if you show up 3 minutes before closing like I have (sorry employees I get off work late.) I am interested in sampling more flavors that they offer during our next visit and I'll be sure to update my review accordingly.

My favorites include the watermelon slushie and the strawberry banana smoothie. Get a large as well! The price is only 50 cents more for a large in most cases.

Their snacks are also pretty tasty. They have noms from popcorn chicken to squid and lobster balls. They're called ""snacks"" for a reason, so don't expect a full on meal!

3426766,2012-08-28,3,0CB7YB1qRSWLQvMbHw3Fmw,"When I'm driving, I am usually very focused on the one task at hand; getting to my destination. However one day, while going through this area of town, I got a hankering for some boba. I made my boyfriend do a Yelp search on my phone, and lo and behold, Easy Life was only 5 minutes away. I clicked for directions, and was directed to a quaint little drink shop across from a large soccer park.

Now, I am a very picky person when it comes to my boba. The consistency has to be perfect. Cooked just right. Under-cooked boba will leave you with a gross, hard center. Over-cooked boba will be too chewy. But Easy Life got that part just right. 

So why only 3 stars, you ask?

Well, I usually only get plain boba milk tea, and if the particular place I'm at has pudding, then pudding is always added.  So what did I get? Pudding Milk Tea with boba, of course!

I was so excited to get one, I got the biggest size they had, to-go, and didn't realize that they used bowl-shaped cups that were much too big to fit in my cup holder :(  -- of course, upon exiting, I realized they used regular sized cups, as well, but I did not notify them I wanted that size. OH WELL. I poked my straw into the top and loaded myself, my boyfriend and that monstrous bowl... cup.. thing... in with me.

I took a sip, and... I wasn't impressed. Was it my selection? Not sure. I gauge a boba place by their most plain drink, the milk tea, my favorite drink, and I guess it just wasn't what I was used to. Don't get me wrong, the tea flavor was there, and the pudding tasted decent. And like I mentioned previously, the boba had great consistency.

Of course, it's just my personal opinion. I do not know what brand of tea, or boba or pudding they use, but, I just didn't care for it.

I did finish the drink though, because you just can't be wasteful in this day and age.

I would stop by if I'm in the area, but I'm still loyal to my Good Foot Boba in Chinatown. (They don't have pudding, but their milk tea is so good, they don't need it!) :)",voYIq2C9eAAeoQZaSyYQ8Q,6,4,3,rn7VZrRXYZpUBR0j04Md8A

My favorite part about Easy Life Boba Tea are the squid balls! Yup, I love deep fried balls with just a little bit of seasoning. They are the best I've tasted, even better than any other places I've tried in Chinatown.

I will happily WAIT for good food done right

I will happily PAY for good food done right

When you fail to execute what you're selling and charge me out the yin-yang on top of it?

Houston, we have a problem....

Snow Factory in Hawaii does snow Ice like it should be(CHECK MY REVIEW AND PICTURES TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE), Fluff Ice does their fluff like it should be...Just like cotton candy....Fluffy in appearance, and melts in your mouth.
I understand where people have an issue with the service. Longer than necesary wait times because your attention span is with your friends that came in to chat while you're on the time clock and not with the customers? How bout more training to put the FLUFF back in your product?

We ordered 2 small Fluffy Snow and a Boba Milk Tea which came out to just under $16...(Sm. $ 5.25, Lg. $7.25, Jumbo $ 9.25....WTF??? For Snow ice????)

We tried Thai Fluffy Snow with rice cake, tapioca, and condensed milk and the thai tea flavor was barely there. We also got Strawberry with mochi, bananas, and lychee jelly and condensed milk which they forgot to put. The straw that broke the camel's back was the texture. It wasn't fluffy at all, probably because all the toppings crushed the fluffy texture, kinda like when you take a nicely made cotton candy and smash the air out of it... and worse of all it was already melting....in an air conditioned room!?!?!? Honestly, this version is closer to shave ice and NOWHERE NEAR Snow Ice. Might as well catch Snow Ono for some bomb-ass Shave Ice and still have some $$$ in your wallet, seriously.

I had Fluff Ice at The Las Vegas Foodie Fest 3 times OUTDOORS and it didn't melt as fast!?!?!?

Yelpers, you have been warned, so if you go here to try it and come out disappointed, or thinking that its not all that, I don't blame you, you aren't getting snow ice like how it should be...ALOHA!!!

Real good boba these days use premium quality tea leaves and real milk and give you the option of being able to go completely unsweetened. These old-fashioned powdered ones are pre-sweeted with sugar and you're mostly just drinking artificial flavoring.

Originally, we couldn't use both at the same time in the same visit but somehow they were able to accommodate us which was nice of them because who knows when we'll be back in Vegas again to use the other Groupon. 

I chose a large size chocolate smoothie with boba. So delicious especially in the 3-digit weather... come to think of it, that was our weather in Sacramento too when we left. The drink was refreshing, love them yummy bobas!  If you are undecided on what to get they have a variety of drinks on their menu including milk teas, flavor teas (choice of green tea or black tea), slushees, iced teas, fresh fruit smoothies, hot drinks and specialties. You can add your favorite toppings (tapioca, jelly or pudding) with any of these drinks. They have a few snacks as well, not a big selection, but you have a sure thing... popcorn chicken!

We got our drinks quickly and off we went. Friendly staff and fast service. When in town we'll be sure to come back here for some snow desserts! And I read in one of the reviews that they also have coffee jelly here! Must try next time!

SERVICE
I was determined to get my Jasmine milk tea but was looking at the menu to see what other drinks they serve. Well...I felt the death glare. My cashier literally stood at the register like a walking dead and was giving me this ""hurry up and order or else I will eat your flesh"" look. 

I sat down after ordering and watched these walking dead pour their premade Jasmine milk tea in a plastic cup. He then sealed the drink, placed it right next to the register and walked off. I grabbed my drink and got the hell out of there. Made it out alive.

DRINK
Even though their Jasmine milk tea is premade, I still liked it. Floral and aromatic. It was too sweet for my liking but tasted better as ice melted and diluted the sweetness. I would say their Jasmine milk tea is similar to the one from Fresh Cup Café (I miss you), but more on the floral side. 

Boba is hit or miss here. It's usually on the softer side and bland. They do have other toppings like pudding and coffee jelly.

What makes Easy Life so great compared to Lollicup and Boba City Cafe? First and foremost the price! I was able to get a large taro tea with boba for under $4, which is about $1 less then the other places I have tried.  Add in the fact that they have a punch card and this is a great deal! 

Now, I realize that sometimes a cheaper price means you are sacrificing quality. Not here. This drink was just as good if not better then any other drink I have had with boba. 

Another reason that Easy Life stands out is the service. The girl that helped me was great. I let her know that I was somewhat new to the world of boba, told her what I normally order (honeydew milk tea with boba), and asked for a recommendation on another flavor to try. I have done this before at other locations, but Easy Life is the first place where I have been offered a sample to taste before I ordered. 

I was in and out in about 7 minutes. The only thing I would change about Easy Life is the location, and that is just for purely selfish reasons!",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,4,3,4,FDP2BeY0UyjYnV2QKyBeJA

Easy Life Bobba is located on South Durango and West Desert Inn, inside a small little strip mall between chase bank and the Pet Hospital.

Strolling in around 9pm I was surprised to see a fairly busy business. When ordering I was a little unsure of what to get as the menu is extensive with a wide range of options. You can see the time and effort that has gone into the menu which I respect.

I ended up with the Strawberry Fluff with strawberries, kiwi, banana with lychee and jellies on top. I also ordered a Milk tea with Bobba for myself.

I'll start by saying I had a sample of the Fluff and it wasn't to bad. As I only sampled a small amount I can't really comment to much but I will say the jelly was a little tough.

As for my milk tea, I had to throw it out. I don't like being a waste and it's very very rare I won't eat something but this wasn't even remotely good. The milk tea taste like powdered milk and the Bobba was so tough it seemed like it had been sitting out and dried up.

I was thinking 3 stars, 1) open till 10pm 2) variety on the menu 3) The yelp check in offer. But the milk tea just wasn't even close to being appetizing. Now maybe it was an off night, maybe my taste buds blew a fuse but as for now, it's not really a place I want to visit again and I can't recommend it to anyone.

Easy Life boba uses powder like most joints to make their boba but my experience was horrible. I don't know if it was mixed right but I wanted a boba milk tea. Simple right? well I guess the boba milk tea's are already made and they're chilled until someone orders one I guess. When I got my boba I noticed white chunks floating in my boba. This immediately turned me off, it looked like when milk goes bad and there's that white foam that turns into chunks. When they poured my drink the skim must've also fallen in my drink idk. It was just a turn off I stopped drinking it.

They put it on the side until my whole order was finished. I waited a couple minutes, more than five minutes actually! Eventually I asked for it and it already melted. I didn't ask for a milk tea. I asked for a slush!!! The ""company policy"", obviously needs changing. The boba pearls are just the usual boba pearls. And the taro is the usual taro. The flavor is there. But not enough to be like OMG... It was OKAY.

As for the eight lobster balls and the popcorn chicken. It was way to salty for me. It would've been great to be informed that you had an option for salt or no salt but then again... IT WAS MY FIRST TIME. So how would I even know it would be salty for my taste buds. But I do admit that the crunch lasted a while. I didn't think these snacks will get me full but the large drink filled me up so I couldn't eat the rest of the popcorn chicken and lobster balls. It was OKAY.

Overall, my whole experience... It was OKAY! This place is something to check out once. I'd probably come back again but after I felt like I've been insulted by the owner and the employees looking miserable. No way!",omzK_8C8RdZoulHbC8t3Ug,8,6,1,rV-cFfnf9Zdr8jp06VDNTg

First time came here for the fluffy snow (in Chinese Snow Ice)
I am always a fan of Taiwanese food so I've been hunting for a Snow Ice place for some time. The price is decent as it already includes certain toppings in the price and the consistency is similar to what you can get in Los Angeles but it could be a lot more 'fluffier'. In addition, it was a little sweeter than I would have liked it to be. Nevertheless, it probably is the only fluffy snow ice place in the Las Vegas Valley. So I would definitely come back and try it again.
The popcorn chicken is even better than other Boba places in the Las Vegas Valley. Just a note: if you do order it, make sure to eat it while it is hot. Once it gets cold, it turned really hard. 
Second time, tried the Pudding Milk Tea w/ Boba. I love their milk tea! The boba was cooked perfectly and chewy. The best part was the pudding. Their consistency and taste of the pudding is by far the best.",UX80mE44b-ObNif3cXRtGg,0,0,4,KqWtXoGMJtBUf5MzMBk_1Q

Besides that, I normally get my usual thai milk tea with boba, which is amazingly priced at $3 for a medium, but I decided to try out their honey milk tea with boba. One of my best decisions to date. The tea is creamy and refreshing without being overpowering and the boba was cooked perfectly. I also had their fresh fruit mango smoothie with boba on another day, which is also an A+++ in my book.

However, the staff was just horrible. They were very unprofessional and rude. They seemed too busy talking about their personal lives rather than do what they're being paid for. We heard them talking while waiting for our drinks, with a few sprinkling of curse words here and there. I understand that sometimes people bring their personal agendas to their workplace, but it is never okay to discuss it in front of customers, especially when you're speaking inappropriately. They had no regards for their customers. They spoke like they didn't care how they are representing the company.

There were about four girls working but it took about 10 minutes for us to get our drinks. I've had a much shorter wait time at other boba places with only two, or even one, worker. I don't understand how it took that long to make our drinks with that many workers on the clock.

And another thing.. when our boba was finally ready, we heard one of the girls yell, ""Okay fuck this, I'm getting off!""

4972937,2012-07-14,0,0CB7YB1qRSWLQvMbHw3Fmw,"As a regular of over six years, I have quite a lot to say about this company.

The first time I walked in this shop was when I was in grade seven. I had recently made two new friends in school, who were eager to show ""little white Bridget"" some Asian culture. I walked in from the scorching Vegas heat into the cool blue store and was amazed. Granted, it was nothing special, looking back, white tables and chairs, stainless steel counters, and blue walls that looked like water filled with air. And the menu! Huge, with tons of drinks to choose from, from teas to smoothies to slushies! Coming from a very secluded section of Indianapolis, I had never even heard of a slushie up until that moment. My friends (Heuna and Michelle) told me to get boba in my drink, and me, being in a daze, quickly agreed and got a black tea, something I was familiar with. And when I got my drink, they both watched me in awe to gauge my  reaction.
I pierced the sealed plastic top with the oversize straw and had my first sip. I was so happy that moment that I could die. The tea tasted amazing, the perfect amount of sweet and flavor. And the boba was soft and chewy. A very nice compliment to the delicious tea. That first sip began my love affair with boba.

Now it's six years later. I'm (somewhat) less naive than I previous was. I've been a loyal customer for all these years, spending my lunch money each day so I could get my fix of the good stuff, if you will. I've tried almost every flavor, and always stick with the teas. This shop is good at what they do, which is make great drinks and pretty amazing boba.
There's only one thing that has bothered me about this location. The staff. You would think that being a customer for so long, the entire crew would know my name by now, right!? While they are friendly when you first come in, over time, if you come in too often, it seems like they don't give a damn about you. I like to come into a store and feel WELCOME, not treated like I'm some loud mouthed little kid, out to destroy your restaurant, or some unpleasant interruption from your riveting discussion on how cute so-and-so looks today. If I want any sort of nice service there, I almost feel like I have to be a cute guy. If you're going to do a job, especially for as long as the majority of the employees have been there, don't half ass it. Do it right, treat each customer kindly and fairly.

Maybe I have different standards on how businesses should be run (which, by the way, I will be opening my own boba shop with my boyfriend in the near future) or maybe I'm still bitter about being told I couldn't work there, despite all the hoops and obstacles I had to go through just trying to get to the shop on my first day. Oh, I'm sorry, silly me, I'm writing a review of the business, not how rude the store owner was to me that day, and how I STILL go in there and give him my hard earned wages.

To make an OVERLY LENGTHY review short, yes, I would recommend this spot for a quick craving fix. They are good at what they do. They have great consistency in flavors and the texture of the boba. Just don't expect to be treated like you're anything special, despite the price you'll pay for the drink. I hope sharing my story was somewhat helpful to someone out there. I'll always hold a soft spot in my heart for this place. So many wonderful things have happened behind the doors of this place.

My one cousin got mango fluff ice with lychee jelly, mochi and condensed milk and that was much better. Flavor was good, but also was much more light consistency and was seemingly fluffy. 

They give you the option of a to-go cup or a plate. I suggest eating in and putting it on a plate where it wont get smashed and won't melt as fast. There's only 3 flavors available so not as much as other places, but still currently one of the handful of people who are serve up this trend treat.

I've also tried the green tea slush (which is now one of if not my favorite item there, SO DELICIOUS!!), coconut slush (good, a tad on the sweet side), kiwi slush (yummy), grape slush (REALLY good), and a peppermint milk tea which I did not like at all, too sweet and too strong peppermint flavor. I've also been told by people whom I've ordered for that the avocado smoothie, taro, mango and strawberry slushes are good but the passion fruit slush was not.

I've placed large orders here a few times now when doing a boba run for my coworkers and only once was there a mistake where one drink was completely missed so I had to go back to get it.

For those still with me... I like the fruity drinks. Some might say I should go to a smoothie shop, but then there wouldn't be boba in the drink damnit! 

Consider this stop 2 in my Las Vegas west side fruity drink boba throw down ! So far No 1 is still MY number 1 as their options for fruity drinks were infinitely better. Mango, pineapple-coconut, papaya, and durian are all things you will find at No1 boba that you will not find here. I decided on the peach ""real fruit"" smoothie today. It did not taste like real peach and it was $5.25 with boba ($4 for my coconut pineapple in the same size with boba at No1 boba). 

As for the bobas themselves... I didn't really notice a quality difference between No1 and Easy. I took the same dining companion with me both times so she could offer additional opinions... she didn't have a preference on the bobas themselves either. She tried the milk tea at Easy. It was a little too milky and a little sweeter than she would have liked, but overall a decent drink.

5260622,2012-10-14,0,0CB7YB1qRSWLQvMbHw3Fmw,"Having come from So Cal, I've longed for a place in Las Vegas to carry fluff ice/shaved snow.  Having tried many locations in the San Gabriel Valley area (such as Class 302 & Fluff Ice) my standards have been set pretty high.

This was the first place that I've heard of that served the delicious fluff ice so I was eager to try it.

They had only 3 flavors to choose from when I arrived: Thai tea, strawberry and mango.  I was slightly disappointed at the limited options as most of the other places that I've been to have 5/6 flavors to choose from including the original milk flavor which is what I typically get.

I ended up with Thai tea, red bean & lichi jelly toppings and condensed milk.  

Overall, the favor was there however the consistency and the look of the product was near dreadful.  I have posted a picture of what I received.  Having paid over $7 for a large, the cup was not even even 2/3 of the way full before the toppings were added.  The ice itself was not shaved to the fluffy consistency that I had missed so much.  It looked as if the blade on the machine was just set a tad too thin creating shaving that resembled the wood shavings from a pencil sharpener rather than thin sheets of fluff ice as one would expect.  This caused the ice to melt and desolve faster than it should have.  So when you got to the bottom of the cup, you were left with mush.  At other places, you are still left with sheets of ice even at the bottom that melt in your mouth with a smooth consistency.

I dont know if I went on a bad night for the store, but from what I had, I would say.... fair attempt at fluff ice.  With a few tweaks, you could have a much better and much more successful final product.",0fKCfLixNcnickTwCfwf0Q,0,0,3,O1lR0-FbNHVjolSHWPHHcQ

Caramel Milk Tea with Boba

Still sated despite the fact that dinner had ended nearly three hours prior but in a celebratory mood after The Kings Double-OT stunner in Game 2 of The Stanley Cup Finals it was largely a matter of convenience that led me to Easy Life Boba Tea, the small storefront a resident of my 'to do' list ever since a January visit to now-shuttered 9 on the Plate.  Purportedly open until 10:00pm on Saturdays but seemingly abandoned with chairs atop tables on my arrival it was not until I hollered ""Hello"" that a small woman emerged from the back and although quick to explain in a deterrent tone that orders after 9:30 were only offered to go I not only persisted but also doubled down, a yelp check-in shaving 50% off my second item with a total tally of $8.54 for an order taken curbside to enjoy.  Admittedly a novice but happy to experiment at such a low cost it was with sips of Easy Life's caramel flavored milk tea that my tasting began and with pearls of boba channeling up the thick straw amidst creamy liquid only modestly sweet I was modestly surprised, an opinion even more befitting a container of summer-fresh fluffy snow far lighter than that at Snowflake Shavery finding textural counterpoints in dense egg custard, whimsical mochi, and a light drizzle of condensed milk...the only bad taste of the evening delivered as I walked back to my car only to see a group of four Asian twenty-somethings seated at a table inside eating fluffy snow with the same young server who'd just sent me to the streets.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,2,K43r7Q8KGyiCBkJx8X06zg

1.)  They removed their stamp card program, like literally, a week after I had reviewed them.  I know why...in my opinion, there must be millions of boba addicts, such as myself now, roaming the streets of Las Vegas.  And with that, they'd lose money giving away so much boba teas in a week's time!  Just kidding, I don't really know why they got rid of it...probably because of just that, though.  We ""addicts"" would pay for the stuff anyway...doesn't have to be free!

2.)  Their little boba tapioca!!!  None can compare!  It's true!  Their boba is cooked to perfection, made just chewy right!  Not overly sweet, not tasteless like some other places...and trust me!  I've tried so many places within this 6 1/2 weeks time because, ever since my first experience at Easy Life, I have been jonesing for boba every.single.day!  So, I basically went anywhere nearby to get me some boba!  Sadly, like I said above, none can compare!

Chicken Wings- Still covered in the same seasoning as all the other food, which is quite tasty.  They were kind on the soggy side and the skin was all squishy and not crisp enough for my taste.

I'm always eager to get my fix of shaved snow (not to be confused with shaved ICE) wherever i can get it!  Inevitably, i'm always going to compare any shaved snow offering to Class 302 as that has set the standard for fluffy, snowy tastiness!

I got the mango fluffy snow ice with mangos (which were tasty and ripe!), strawberries, and lychee jelly.  I had also asked for some pudding but i guess they forgot about that request.  

Anyway, the snow ice was tasty, but i have to say i was a bit disappointed at the texture.  Yes, it's fluffy, but it's also got a bunch of little ice particles that take away from the fluffiness, adding a crunch that I didn't particularly like (and normally I like added crunchiness!).  It's as if they mixed shaved ice and shaved snow.  If you prefer the light, smooth fluffiness of Class 302's shaved snow, you may not enjoy this as much...

I think I was expecting something more like the snow ice at Icy Juicy, which I absolutely love and to which I am addicted.  This was definitely heavier in consistency and tasted good, but I think I still like snow ice better, maybe because you can start with just plain snow ice and then add the flavors you want to it.  I wouldn't normally order strawberry, Thai tea, or mango gelato or sherbet, so there you go!",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,2,3,3,ylbdet7maV6LLu5O_TbLQw

What is with the fact that you have to pay for a loyalty punch card, and you only get a punch if you spend something crazy like, every $20 (if I remember correctly.) Maybe if you were buying drinks for a family of 4 every time you popped in that would make sense, but no. Yeah, so no punch card for me.

I got my go to drink, jasmine milk tea but with lychee jelly and no boba this time. My drink tasted like water. No jasmine tea flavor. Lychee jelly had no strong flavor either.
Disappointing.

On a positive note, the place is clean and POPPING. Like, they get super, crazy, busy. Seating is ample so again, that's a plus.

Whenever I'm in the mood for my favorite coffee milk tea of theirs, I will usually make a stop before heading home.  It's nice and convenient since the location is prime, just being down the street and a quick drive from where I live.  During summers I frequent there a lot, in-and-out each visit with my to-go drink (and the occasional snack) in hand.

HOWEVER... I have dropped my rating for them by one star from my previous review.  Why?  For one reason only: Because of their new ""large"" size cold drink cup.....which is more like a bowl, instead of a cup.  If you have small hands, it's not the ideal size, unless you intend on holding your drink with two hands.  Good thing for me, I usually take my drink home, with no intention of carrying it around with me while I shop, or what not.  But even so, this new large-sized to-go cup/bowl does NOT even fit in your standard car CUP-HOLDER!  So WTH is the point in that??!!?

It works fine if you don't have a front-seat passenger, because the cup/bowl is seriously BIG ENOUGH to be placed on the passenger seat with the seat belt on!",nj0Ls0-lCgjNoH7kl_XHoA,0,0,4,YtzDf0ArbU6jbjUQ3Qadow

This boba place has always been very close to my past few safe houses.  In fact if you were to plot the past safe house locations on the map, Easy Life Boba Tea will pretty much be in the middle.  Just an observation.

Anyway, there has been some recent activities on the fluffy snow ice scene in Las Vegas, with one opened by a celebrity chef and another by individuals completely off the radar.  If you are an active duty Yelp operative, you will likely know their names, employment history, and what they did last summer.

My visit to ELBT is to check out how the fluffy snow ice measures up to the new competitions.  So here is my report based on my observations and my order of a Large Mango Snow with Green Apple Jelly, Strawberry and Mango with Condensed Milk:

Sizes (3):
Small ($5.25 includes 1 regular and 1 premium toppings)
Medium (No show. Must be out of this most average & popular of container sizes)
Large ($7.25 includes 1 regular and 2 premium toppings)
Jumbo ($9.25 includes 2 regular and 2 premium toppings)

The Small is perfect for a snack for one. Large is big enough for me, but it is pretty much a meal replacement.  Jumbo is suitable for competitive eaters, but best shared with a few friends that does not mind cooties.  If they do, they can get their own Small or have a friend administers a cootie shot.  

Flavors comes in three varieties (Strawberry, Mango and Thai Tea), so if just competing on that simplistic variable alone, ELBT comes in with the least amount of ""snow"" selections. 

Toppings:  8 regular (Boba, Mochi, Pudding, Red Bean, Lichi Jelly, Coconut Jelly and Green Apple Jelly) and 6 premium (Mango, Strawberry, Kiwi, Banana, Aloe Vera and Coffee Jelly).  

Flavoring (aka Sauce): 4 to drizzle with (Condensed Milk, Chocolate Syrup, Brown Sugar Syrup, Caramel Syrup).

Again, overall number of selection to top off and customize your ""snow"" order with is not bad, but falls short of the competition.  But ELBT have the majority of the stuff I would want to order normally, so I don't care if they don't have gummy bears, Cap't Crunch, M&M's, etc. on their list.

Texture & Flavor:  Texture of the fluffy snow here is decent. However, you can still easily detect the slightly gritty ice crystals in your mouth, but it is a vast improvement over the offering at Kuma, but still not as perfect as Frost Bites Shavery (recently re-branded SnowFlake Shavery and relocated to their new brick and mortar location on Spring Mountain/Decatur in late Aug. 2013).  Flavor of the snow is good (but not made from all natural ingredients), not too strong or mild, but just enough.

Service:  High schoolers behind the counter, so your service mileage will vary greatly depending on the usual variables (cuteness, personality, your kicks,etc.)

So when it is hot and you want something to cool you down, and flavored snow dessert is what you crave, apply sun block (SPF40+) according to instruction and drive/bike/bus/teleport yourself to ELBT for a cool one.

Greater than A-OK.
