Have been doing this for the past 4 years. This has always been a great place to grab a sandwich to-go and take it home. Generally, this is about 9:30 or 10:00 am, soon after they open. I went Tuesday morning and got one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had from any Subway. The bread was absolutely dry and stale and crumbled to the touch. The lettuce tasted as though it had been cut days before and was slightly gummy in texture... I almost gagged when I put it in my mouth. The meat and cheese were okay, but couldn't make up for the bread and lettuce, which ruined my appetite. I ended up just throwing the entire footlong in the trash. Yeah, it was that bad. The service from the young woman could not have been more unfriendly and I felt as though I was bothering her, though I was the only customer. Obviously, there has been a change in ownership or management. I won't ever go back to this store.... ever.",EruLYDd5XMWX--aT2l3MTQ,2,0,1,fv1qbC9caB_QVd6pUlgDxw

For no reason! Horrible employees! Slow! Always training employees due for the manager hiring the worst people!! Don't go! I don't recommend!,q-cVtRpG8alKgdjgs3PDUg,1,0,1,cYJtJLzRlucCIYD8YeAtBg
2379529,2011-12-18,0,Ad_-9GuDFTEjAsSQ3PXLOw,"I don't know why I don't think about Subway more often when I'm trying to think of where to pick up a quick, inexpensive meal. I have lived in the area for about 6 years, and only just recently tried this Subway. My mom told me Subway was running a special on $2 cold cut or meatball subs. I've always liked their meatball subs, so we decided to give it a try. I like that Subway now has a nice variety of breads to choose from. I got the Italian cheese variety. It paired nicely with the meatballs. I do have to say that the meatballs weren't quite as good as I remembered. However, it was still a good, affordable meal. The place was clean and the staff friendly.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,0,0,3,3AnEKAn4XVCkGPhfSIphoA
3031368,2016-06-10,0,Ad_-9GuDFTEjAsSQ3PXLOw,"I placed an order online for this store. The menu options included soup. I ordered 3 sandwiches and a cup of soup and paid for the order in full. When I went to pick up my order I was told that no Subway offers soup in summer. BUT....the store cannot credit me for the soup that they couldn't provide. I was told to call corporate. I called corporate and was on hold for 30+ minutes waiting to speak to someone about my refund. While I waited my hot meatball sub turned into a cold soggy mess that I ultimately gave up on. Now, corporate says that the owner of the franchise is responsible for rectifying the problem but the store told me that they never touch my card so it appears that NO ONE has a clue how to refund my money. The employees in the store couldn't offer a gift card (because corporate handles the Internet transaction), they offered me cookies. If I wanted cookies I would have ordered them.

I am not impressed at all. Definitely will not order online The website says that online ordering makes your meal more convenient but now they have my money for an item that they could not provide. It""s not the amount as much as the obvious lack of customer service at all levels. Now I have to wait for a call from the owner.",CBIJf_v41QOftjt_DG-Ldg,2,0,2,qjX1OtTzNPTK-wqE8ClXGA
3283260,2011-06-13,0,Ad_-9GuDFTEjAsSQ3PXLOw,"I actually swore off subway for awhile after I moved here from GA. Not because I didn't like subway anymore, but because on the 3 day drive here,  I think we ate subway for nearly EVERY meal. Apparently truckers LOVE their footlongs. :P By the time we got here, I was absolutely sick of subs, and fast food in general, really. 
Finally the craving for a tasty sandwich came back, and off to subway I go. Tastes just as good as I remember. This location was clean, the service good, the vegetables fresh, and they even had spinach, which is something that you don't find as often back home. Perhaps all the subways here have spinach, but I wouldn't know. 
Only thing that I didn't like, was that they didn't have sliced Monterrey cheddar, only shredded. Weird.",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,0,0,4,zSXVUIPwBGnslkj87OeZjA
3517905,2012-08-12,0,Ad_-9GuDFTEjAsSQ3PXLOw,"This is the best Subway location in Las Vegas. The staff is always friendly and right there waiting to help you and the line really moves along quick. Don't be surprised if you see a long line upon entering but like I said it moves quick

The veggies are so fresh. 

I asked for extra cheese twice and didn't even get charged. The store is so clean you could literally eat off the floor.

There isn't much more to say but try this location!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,5,3,5,eu7U8lNhViZY6EMCKWRFGw

Typical Subway set up. Nothing different. 

This is my new Subway location. The young man that works in here was excellent and made a great sandwich! He was helpful in making recommendations and really took his time with me. Much appreciated. 

Always good to see young people providing great service.",2_JZcBO_KLAgxDQosHnt5Q,3,3,5,yPZtTDbcOGBKFWNDjDTJuQ

This location was open late, which worked great for us. The 2 guys working there were very friendly.",_1nBbzvn9pIng-CqNziSzA,0,1,4,Dp6r9-Um0QZO6JJ5AZ8KPA

On a Friday afternoon near dinner time. Either this,store is poorly run or they don't want to make sandwiches with multiple ingredients. Went to another subway a few minutes away and they gladly nads my sandwich. Don't waste your time with this store.",H7bJDtGzhdg1fsmBL4KZWg,1,1,1,AK_PY-QBhfYqEpnDIrhCKw
5341016,2016-09-08,1,Ad_-9GuDFTEjAsSQ3PXLOw,"This specific Subway was very dirty the tables needed to be wiped and the floors needed to be swept.  A herd of children came in while we were eating and they were all given free cups and all stood in front of the soda dispenser blocking paying customers. 

The sandwich makers seemed to be more interested in something going on in the back of the store and all the kids that were coming in than they were of paying customers.  I would not visit this store again.",v8lAikL_W_99CTMMmfXeFA,3,0,1,HJuBzsLSHcTFRVJLyx0_QQ
