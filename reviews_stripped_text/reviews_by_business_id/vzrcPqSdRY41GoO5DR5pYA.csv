Well everything except the server crumbled all that. We were a party of four and ordered many appetizers, entrees and drinks without the cost being a factor. The crab which was ordered was dry the 2 ribeye steaks were dry as well and didnt resemble a ribeye,  and the other main course was an entree with shrimp and the shrimp were surprisingly small and few which didnt justify the price. Overall very dissapointed the only ok tasting thing were the dozen oyster which were served with 2 lemon slices and ofcourse had to ask for more which no one shouldnt have to.",FWnBczVXK_8j1RSG64VzMA,1,0,2,IwenHcocN7qENRi6YezysA

Upon sitting our server Maria came over before we completely sat down and asked us what we wanted to drink before we looked at a menu. She left dirty plates on the table. We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, which was great. Ordered the crawfish bread and gumbo, both HORRIBLE. Talked to Maria about the gumbo because it was supposed to be the Shrimp and sausage gumbo but no sausage was in the dish and the server said it doesn't come with it but the menu says it supposed to(very important to know your menu as a server).

98983,2015-02-22,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"I am from California and grew up having great sea food.  My husband and I live in Las Vegas now 10 years and I took him to Landrys for dinner with our children. I ordered a shrimp, fish, crab ,and oyster plate.   The food was horrible.  It was extremely fishy . Good quality seafood is not fishy at all.  The fried oysters tasted so bad I thought I was going to get food poisoning.  Everything is mostly stuffed this and that. Almost no pure seafood.  It seemed like it's was bad seafood the would just make into a patty or stuffing for the crab and other items to cover the lack off quality. It was also extremely salty.  I don't understand why they are in business  in Las Vegas . I think they get all of there business from tourists off the strip.  As a local I will let you know  Vegas is way better than this......   I cannot  express enough how bad it was .   I think it is the worst food I have had in my life.   I think the good ratings about the restaurant may have been posted by employees or the corporate office.   So please save your $120. Plus dollars and choose another location .  You are probably safe with any of the upscale hotels with seafood restaurants so you are insured a wonderful experience.   Also , our service was very slow and the watress switched  the  glasses when she brought  back drink refills and it wasn't  noticed until they drank out of the others cup and got grossed out .  If they take the cups for refills and don't bring back clean cups they better make sure they are going to the correct person. Oh, gosh we had to ask for place settings even after dinner was brought. The managers just stood around watching the disatisfied customers bit did nothing to help out in anyway. Over all they shouldn't be in business. I don't want to give them even 1 star.",phKVhpEt-ja2AdzK97f8kw,2,0,1,ymV5Qt2WYDyUm0oYsqRfvw

The decor hasn't changed at all from the time it opened that I recall, which made the lighting at the tables difficult at best (for aging parents). Service was standard, nothing special. Food was fair. I thought I had tried the lobster bisque before and enjoyed it. Not this time - way too much cream & no lobster! We saw a lot of fried seafood options and a lot of shrimp. The 'stuffed' choices turned out to be mostly stuffing and very little seafood at all. Definitely will not be returning for seafood again. I'd rather pay a bit more and enjoy the meal.

206846,2012-07-07,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"$70! For 2 kid size portions! My husband and I are originally from Louisiana, so we were excited to go to Landry's for some of our hone town favorites. However, we were deeply disappointed. I ordered the fried seafood platter and my husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips. My seafood platter was extremely small and unseasoned. I have never seen a seafood platter that small before. I literally had 5 French fries, 4 oysters, 4 shrimp, 1 stuffed shrimp, 1 small piece of Basa and a stuffed crab, a few strings of fried onions. This was for $23.99. Now way was this platter worth that amount. My husband was also very displeased with his amount for the price. We have visited Landry's in New Orleans, LA and Lafayette, La. The size of out plates there was enormous well seasoned and worth the price. We were completely shocked with the Landry's in Las Vegas. This is not the restaurant we once knew. Something needs to change because our experience is not the 4 star Landry's we experienced with the restaurants in Louisiana. The chefs in the Las Vegas restaurant need to take lessons from the chefs in the Louisiana Landry's. You must season seafood! It's complete garbage otherwise. For the price portion size should not be the size of a kiddie plate. Presentation is also a must! Out food looked like it had been thrown on a plate, no neatness at all. We defiantly would not recommend the Las Vegas location or visit again. Serious changes need to be made with this restaurants chefs/cooks. They need to be given instruction on how to properly cook and serve Landry's dishes.",RkVOrB1NTX2dvg5Agp8klw,1,1,1,V2G_DVfff2rKF8NVAdMuqg

364640,2014-01-13,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"Had dinner here this weekend.  I arrived a few minutes late for our reservation but our guests were on time so they had been seated already, almost 15 minutes and their drinks hadn't arrived yet so immediately we were concerned because the restaurant was maybe 25% occupied.  The waitress arrived and she was very nice and took our drink order, which was a bottle of white wine.  This particular wine is not expensive but was under lock and key for a manager to get so this took a good 10 minutes.  Concerned.  The waitress arrived with the bottle and glasses and apologized for the delay and it was fine with us as she seemed to be making an effort.  She took our appetizer order and we went ahead and ordered entree's not knowing what to expect.  We opted for the ""fried"" portion of the menu as that's why we went here.  Fried is not something we do, so we thought it would be fun and to allow the kids to try something new.  We had Gumbo all around, chicken and sausage.  They were generous, small bowls. and everyone did like it.  Salads were good also.  I had a wedge with blue cheese, which is something I may have once every couple of years.  It was good.  The fried shrimp entree's arrived and everyone again seemed to enjoy.  I'm from the gulf coast so typically I would order a fresh fish, blackened with vegetables.  We all knew we went here for fried.  I've lived in Vegas twice, totally 15 years and the only word I've heard about Landry's locally was on Yelp prior to making a reservation... Which is great, but if you don't hear some local chatter, that's usually a sign to maybe consider something else.  Our table got off to a slow start but got into a comfortable rhythm as far as food delivery. There wasn't a lot of team work to help clear the table as dishes were completed.  The first beer glass was still on the table when we left if that tells you anything.  
I will go back for sure.  It's a nice dining dining room.  The staff was friendly and the kitchen did a good job.  I may even attempt the fresh fish next time, or something a little more challenging for the kitchen.  
We all know ordering fried doesn't have much merit but it was fun food and we did enjoy it.  I know this restaurant has been here for years so I do believe they're doing most things right.  Would I recommend?  Yah, I would based on this one time experience, but I couldn't recommend anything outside my own personal experience as of yet.",fKccZhundlwqSjRGXhUa-A,0,0,4,4G54DWoj1TbtpLIVll-7qQ

530865,2009-05-27,1,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"Went with my BFextrodrinaire for dinner to compare & contrast our previous experience with Joe's Crab Shack.  Actually, the 2 places couldn't be more different, but our intent was to sample the lobster bisque from both places and see if we could arrive at a consortium regarding its preparation.  To start, I ordered the ""seafood stuffed jalapenos""...with ""Landry's seafood stuffing inside jalapenos with cream cheese and jack cheese"".  In a word, DELICIOUS!  Came piping hot with obviously scratch ranch dressing and crisp, not soggy onion strings.  I would definitely order these again.  Next, we both had the lobster bisque.  Hands down, Landry's beat Joe's in my mind.  More creamy, more real (not artificial flavor).  For the entrée, I ordered the jumbo lump crabmeat salad with pico de gallo and herb dressing.  My BF ordered the ribeye with a lobster tail.  He seemed to enjoy both of his surf & turf.  We shared the lobster tail and came to a draw.  In our concurrent opinion, Cappo's on west Sahara, serves the best prepared lobster (on special only) of all!  I tried a small sampling of the crab salad I ordered.  Was so full after the stuffed jalapenos and lobster soup.  I was so looking forward to the marriage of the lump crab and pico de gallo.  Unfortunately, all I tasted was crab and avocado.  Maybe the pico de gallo got lost in the richness of the crab or maybe the kitchen neglected to include it in the mix.  That and the measly ration of herb dressing, (along with a surplus of tomatoes...was that all they had in the kitchen for garnish) was enough to say that I wouldn't recommend this salad.

All said, my BF had an interesting observation.  As we waited for our appetizers, one look around the room showed the wait staff, obviously working in concert with the expeditors and bus people, a truly diverse work force.  I have no doubt, that a walk into the kitchen would reveal the same amount of diversity in the people preparing your food.  Amazingly enough, this diversity was also reflected in the demographics of the people frequenting the restaurant.  Not a one-note wonder from staff to patrons.  No one working there had to master a single language to transmit menu orders.  Kudos to the mgmt staff who recognize diversity and all that it has to offer.  While it's probably lost on most of their patrons, it was a memorable and noteworthy experience for me.  I should add, this place is ubiquitous or morphable., i.e. it could be your meeting place with your grandma after church or be a nice date place with someone special.  I really like this place for what it is and highly recommend it.",01prx46XR0mMJpNjpGeS6Q,1,1,4,mATfYd32ht75eJbfqeAJxw

567204,2017-07-29,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"I went to Landry's for lunch to try and give them another chance to prove themselves. Typically once a year I come into the restaurant to see if they have improved their menu items, the quality of the food or their prices. Sadly, every year I'm disappointed. I have to stop this self-experiment and just give up on them. 

The customer service typically has high marks, but the restaurant itself fails miserably in several other areas. The lunch menu is essentially made up of deep fried unhealthy food. If I  wanted all this deep fried style of eating I would just visit Long John Silvers. It is such a disappointment. If you want something fresh and grilled it will cost you an arm and a leg. If you want something off their lunch menu expect it to be fried. Prices are outrageous for lunch and the portion sizes are embarrasing.

Today I ordered the Blackened Mahi Sandwich..($16) of course the only side item options were either deep fried french fries or deep fried onion rings. I asked if they could sub a salad for the fried options. ""Of course,"" was the reply, but wait... It was going to cost $4 extra.

While waiting for my salad and sandwich I was presented with an undercooked loaf of garlic bread that when opened still contained cold butter and was not warm at all.

The meal experience was worsened by the arrival of my Blackened Mahi sandwich. The presentation was absolutely unappealing. The oversized plate (with the un-ordered fries/rings) dwarfed the appearance of the sandwich. But to my surprise it was not just an Illusion, the actual size of the fish was ridiculous. They should name the sandwich the Blackened Minnow to more accurately describe its size.

To make matters worse the sandwich was not even prepared as described on the menu. This led me to return the sandwhich and order the gumbo.

The gumbo was another sad attempt to make an appetizing dish. It was essentially a bowl of soup with a small dollup of white rice. The taste resembeled Campbell's Tomato soup with a few pieces of sausage tossed in.  Another disappointment. 

Overall, the annual trip to Landrys proved once again that they can't provide a delicious, unique lunch meal for a good value.",eyxUD1GWQWsG7b1tdDWLJA,4,0,1,PcoLY7D5V8CD9Tr0R5WexQ

I was apprehensive about the service in this restaurant because I had heard from many people that service was incredibly slow. However, it had been a few years since I had heard that so I decided to give this place a chance since the food was supposed to be good. 

As I walked in I notice a big blue marlin in the restaurant. It was dimly lit and had a very nice vibe. It took about 5 minutes to be seated because unfortunately no one had answered the phone when we called. We were seated and had a wonderful waitress, Amanda Prosciutto (like the ham). She was very friendly, bubbly, fun, and very attentive to our table throughout our whole dining experience. The food was a little slow coming out but she kept coming over to our table to keep us informed about what was going on with our food. 

We ordered the paired appetizer of spinach, crab, and artichoke dip and the crab and shrimp fondue. Both were good but the artichoke dip was especially delicious. For dinner I ordered the tilapia bianca. It was delicious - lightly fried, with artichoke hearts, tomatoes, shrimp, and scallops in a nice white buttery sauce. It was served on top of a cheesy risotto like rice, which was also pretty tasty although not very multidimensional. 

I also ordered two drinks. One was a caipiranha made with strawberry and basil. I thought it was delicious but my fiancée thought it tasted too alcoholic. I think that is probably just because he does not like caipiranhas. also tried a pomegranate mojito that was also pretty good. I would recommend this restaurant since our server was very attentive, the food was delicious and reasonably priced, and it had a pleasant atmosphere.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately met by the hostess, who promptly seated us, and that's where the good customer service ended.  I normally try to find something good to say about a restaurant when I right a review, but I HONESTLY say that Landry's was by far the WORST restaurant experience we've ever had!!!!!  Where to start: The server, who did not introduce himself, initially appeared to be a pleasant person, but as time went on, our initial perception was proven to be wrong.  He took our drink and appetizer order, and after a brief while he returned with our drinks.  While pouring my wife's drink, he spilled some of it on her; however, my wife didn't make a big deal out of it.  I specifically told him that I wanted a margarita on the rocks with salt around the rim of the glass.  He returned with a blended margarita with no salt.  Of course, I immediately sent it back.  Due to the fact that my wife's drink was horrible, she also sent hers back.  At this point, the negative attitude began to show.  Although he attempted to be cordial with me, it was obvious that he had an ATTITUDE with my wife.  We didn't feel appreciated at all.  Now, to make matters worse, if we had to rate the food, it would barely get a ""C.""  The overall experience at Landry's was a ""D-.""  The only reason we're not giving it an ""F"" is because we were seated promptly.  Quite frankly, we will never go back to this restaurant.  Overpriced, horrible service and sub-standard food.

982440,2016-07-28,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"Appalling. Awful. Terrible. I'll think of some more descriptors as I go along. This was one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. 
We arrived at about 6:15pm to try Landry' s on a recommendation by a friend, so I didn't check the Yelp reviews before we went in. Big mistake. 

There were only three other tables in the huge dining room that were occupied, and a large party in the back room that was pretty much done. Our server came over, and without a smile, asked what we wanted to drink. We checked out the menu, and the prices were fairly steep, so we thought it would be excellent. If I would've known that it was on par with a Red Lobster, we wouldn't have tried it. 

Anyway, he came back to take our order and had the air of a superior waiter at a 5 star restaurant.  Everything on the menu seemed to be stuffed, fried, etc., and I didn't see anything that looked good. My husband got the fish and chips, and I got a bowl of clam chowder with a side salad. The salad was pretty good. Our server seemed a little offended that we didn't order $30 entrees, but took our order anyway. 

The garlic bread that we got in lieu of an assorted bread basket was a cheap white roll with salty butter and garlic. My husband's fish was over breaded and was obviously frozen Sysco quality. I thought it tasted slightly rancid. Very substandard for almost $19. The fries were decent, but the onion straws were pasty. My clam chowder had a strange vinegary taste, and instead of serving traditional oyster crackers with it, it came with the cheapest saltines you can buy. I couldn't eat it and ended up sharing my husband's dinner. 

Our waiter refilled our water, and took off. Not once did he check back with us to see how we liked our meal, even though he passed by us a half dozen times and wouldn't make eye contact. When he finally came over when we were done, he asked me if I didn't like the chowder. I said no, that it was just a personal preference, that one of the spices was overwhelming, and my husband agreed. I the said it kind of tasted vinegary to me, and he replied in a truly superior tone: ""I can assure you, there is no vinegar in the soup"". I was shocked speechless at his tone, and even my husband was surprised. He was then very chummy to my husband, saying ""hey, guy, you did a good job on those fish and chips"". No offer of dessert, coffee, or anything. 

When he brought the check, he plopped it down in front of my husband and said "" enjoy"". VERY odd. I think he had pretensions of being a haute cuisine waiter on the Strip.  But here's the thing: he asked at the beginning if we were locals (which we are), and treated us as if we were McDonald's refugees. We always over tip for good service, because I used to be in the restaurant industry, but we didn't feel at all guilty in leaving him about 10%. 

I'm not sure which part of our visit left the worse taste in my mouth, the bad food or the horrendous service. Avoid this place like the plague.",lOOcQsJv3ZleM1zKj1SJDQ,8,0,1,WRMoj3zd0EEGnHpuImZ5Vg

It was very dry and also topped with way too much pico de gallo. Bummed.  I was surprised to learn they bring out a huge salad and bread for the table.  We were all unaware of this or we wouldn't have ordered the app.  The salad and bread were good.  I can't complain about that. 

I love seafood and could possibly eat it everyday.  But the entree of shrimp and grits is disappointing.  There were plenty of shrimp but the grits were way overdone.  The sauce surrounding it was too much sauce with very little veggies in it.  I don't know if that is on purpose but it wasn't a winner.  

I probably won't be rushing back here.  There are plenty of other great seafood restaurants in the area.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,3,1,2,dGKIPmDc3shhHgiIxQSk2A
1713598,2017-03-12,1,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"While my best friend was in town from Orlando visiting he wanted to get some good seafood off the Strip.  After checking Yelp we found Landry's and decided to give it a try.  The Yelp reviews are hit or miss for this place but thankfully our experience was a hit.  Landry's is located across from the Palace Station on Sahara.  Since it was a quiet Monday there were not many diners here.  We were promptly seated and our drink order taken.  

I opted for the ruby Cosmo and was very happy with my choice.  It's always disappointing when you get a martini and it's only three quarters of the way full.  This one was filled to the top and full of flavor...perfect.  Dinner comes with soft bread and a salad bowl for the table to share.  Our server prepared the salad at our table and mixed in their house made dressing (a balsamic with a lemon flavor.  It was good).  

For our main entrees we ordered the crab stuffed mahi and crab cakes.  The crab stuffed mahi had a light cream sauce on top and featured crab orzo and grilled asparagus.  It was light but full of flavor and delicious.  My friend raved about his crab cakes and said they didn't skimp on the chunks of crab.  

For dessert my friend wanted chocolate so the double chocolate cake was a must.  It had layers of chocolate ganache and chocolate frosting.  Definitely a huge piece of cake and beautifully presented on the plate.  He wasn't in the mood to share (some friend he is!) so I ordered the mini sampler for myself.  The mini sampler comes with a brownie sundae, bread pudding à la mode with foster and vanilla sauce, and crème brûlée.  

Everything tasted great and the service was fantastic.  Dinner isn't cheap at Landry's but for the quality and taste it is worth the price.  Sure there are more pretentious, expensive seafood places in Vegas but Landry's hit the mark for me and I will be back.  Total bill for 2 dinners, 1 cocktail, 2 desserts and 20% tip was about $120.",ziiMYejVJAjbkRjSeAzrbQ,1,2,4,yGVI76sPGBhCJocgyZJwpg
1730954,2015-03-18,2,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"I don't even know where to start.  If I could give them a negative rating, I would.

I was visiting Las Vegas with friends and family.  We were a large group -- 18 of us -- which they accommodated.  We arrived on time for our 7:30 reservation and they surprisingly sat us, even though not all of our party had arrived.  It all went downhill from there.

The food was just -- meh.  Ok.  I ordered the Snapper Hemingway, which I didn't even finish.  The food was just ok.  Nothing overwhelming, more underwhelming.  And then the horror began.

Our waiter -- whose name I did not get -- was clearly flustered, frustrated and annoyed almost from the moment we sat down.  While the appetizers arrived fairly quickly, the dinner took awhile.  But, you give people the benefit of the doubt -- we were a large party at 18.  But the restaurant was less than half full -- a couple of patrons at maybe five other tables.  10-15 people tops.  But hold on, the best is yet to come.

The big stinking mess started with the bill.  I will start off by saying that it took over an hour for our server to get us the bill.  I am not exaggerating-- over an hour!  Granted, the bills were separated by groups of 2, 3 and 4 but this was at his request, not ours.  With such a large party I assumed all the food would be on just the one bill but it was our server who said he could separate it in groups.  After a 40 minute wait, he finally arrived with the bills in hand, only to discover that he had put other folks items on other folks bills.  Then it took another 40 minutes for him to re-figure everything.  All.Over.Again.

At no point did the manager come over to apologize, comp us a drink, dessert, nothing.  My twin was so enraged she got up and had to go find the manager who had to be found like the Lost Ark of the Covenant.  Where she was God only knows while this now incredibly angry server is trying to refigure the bills.  I'm not looking for a comp'd drink or a comp'd anything but for crying out loud, go help the guy!  

And there she stood, with my twin towering over her, with a completely detached demeanor, defending the server.  She was nearly comatose.  I couldn't help but wonder if she was on some kind of medication.  Here's a tip for Landry's Seafood Las Vegas -- how about hiring staff who actually care?  And having an actual pulse might come in handy.

I was SO ready to leave the man a $2 tip but thought of Anthony Bourdain, the chef and host of CNN's Parts Unknown, who always, ALWAYS leaves 18% REGARDLESS of the service, and I plunked down my 18%. 

Landry's Seafood Las Vegas made a crap load of money off of us last Friday evening (March 14).  It's too bad I wasn't at the roulette tables.  DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  RUN QUICKLY THE OTHER WAY.",BniZUGEcnH1GACXBsOUCWg,2,0,1,RLJlEbcprasoBgOGcgeLBA

We had been interested in trying Landry's for some time. When we finally got in, we were quite excited. We were promptly greeted and show to our table. The dining room is REALLY dark. Our server was very nice. A little too casual, but he was doing okay. He knew the menu and the options, so I can say he was on his game as far as server professionalism. 

I had the Surf & Turf, which was good, but not great. The side of asparagus was over cooked and tasted like something gourmet that you tried to cook at home, but didn't get quite right the first time. 

I hate to be too down on the place, but it felt more ""cute"" than welcoming. 
About a week later, we had the same meal at a chain joint and it was twice the quality for 1/3 of the price. We spent the ride home comparing fine dining and casual experiences... it was interesting how we got there.

Landry's feels like a once great restaurant that has stopped investing in linens, silverware, and the accouterments of fine dining presentation.

The drinks were very reasonable and delish as well. I had the fried zucchini and the buffalo chicken sliders (don't ask me why I ordered chicken at a seafood restaurant..lol). The reason only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars was due to the sliders as they were a bit dry. Nevertheless overall for appetizers and several drinks for under $25 you can't beat it.

I ordered the seafood gumbo to start, which is something I rarely order out because I grew up on gumbo and it is not often you get that homemade taste at a restaurant. Now, I'm not saying it tasted like Mama's, but it was very flavorful and was filled with lots of seafood. I also had the oyster po boy. It was huge, thus making it really difficult to eat, but the oysters were seasoned well atop lettuce and tomatoes with a spicy remoulade sauce.

2194746,2016-05-09,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"I came here with my hubby, 2 boys (ages 5 and 6), and a friend. We sat down, and the menu was so amazing, we didn't even know where to start. We are not from Las Vegas, so we wanted to eat somewhere nice. 

The atmosphere is very welcoming, and laid back even though it has a fancy factor. We were dressed very casual, but there were also people there who were dressed up in suits as well. It was not busy at all, even though it was prime time for dinner. The restaurant itself is very clean, and the menu items are reasonably priced for the portion sizes. You could definitely share, and we ended up ordering way too much food. 

What we ended up ordering: 

Crab and Spinach Artichoke Dip: It tasted very much like the ocean? It was a little salty. It didn't taste really special? I was kind of actually disappointed. If I were to compare it to something, it would probably be tuna salad... nothing special here. 

Fish and Chips. They serve a lot of their dishes with fried onion curls that my kids actually really enjoyed. This dish however was nothing special, but it's Fish and Chips, so I didn't expect anything fancy anyways. Kids liked it... it was salty for the adults... 

Crispy Fish Sandwich. My friend liked it overall, but again, it was really salty... Enough to share though! 

Shrimp Jambalaya. They use Jumbo shrimp, so it is really satisfying, and it was spicy (yum) but in comparison to Bubba Gump's Shrimp Jambalaya, it is not as good. The consistency is more soupy, and the sausage was missing? 

Fried Seafood Platter. I ordered this, and it came with an assortment of fried seafood. 1. Fried oysters: I LOVE fried oysters, and this was sooo good, but overly SALTY... i picked the batter off and just ate the oysters. 2. Stuffed Blue Shell Crab: I was not impressed that it was stuffed with some sort of bread and they used cold water shrimp... I would have rather them use less medium size shrimp, but this was also really salty for me. 3. There were an assortment of shrimp, and it was served with fried onions and fries. The shrimp didn't make me go wow... it was just battered shrimp. One was stuffed, and the others were just battered and deep fried.  

All the dishes came with a house salad with your choice of dressing and complimentary garlic bread. Their garlic bread was good, but not I want seconds good. 

House Balsamic Dressing: interesting and unique taste... Not sure what kind of balsamic vinegar they use, but it definitely is not what I am use to being served. I liked it though.

They serve your food in courses. The appetizer came out first. The Salads came out second, and then your meal. I feel like they are going for the fine dining experience. The waiter was friendly, but did not refill my hot water for me. However, he did refill everyone else's iced water. 

They also offer a 10% Military Discount, but we did not get this since we asked after our card was ran. 

It was also my birthday, and they gave me a tiny Creme Brulee that you could probably finish in one bite. I guess I must be spoiled, cause RA gave me a giant deep fried tempura ice cream served with raspberry and chocolate sauce hahaha! 

Overall... I would not recommend this place to a friend, and I don't think we will be going back... I cannot speak for their other dishes. Maybe we just didn't pick the right ones?

2295544,2014-10-22,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"Exasperated by the long wait at Oyster Bar, my boyfriend and I decided to check out Landry's. It was about 7:30pm on a Saturday and there was no wait. The restaurant was about 3/4 full. Our server was nice and welcoming. The ambiance was great for a date night. 

The oyster bar trash is a great small plate but I'm warning that it is indeed a small portion. We are talking about a small pile of crabmeat and 5 shrimps with a small scoop of rice! However, the lump blue crab and blackened shrimp tasted fresh and delicious. Both went well with the lemon beurre blanc that accompanied the dish. The broccoli side dish was stir-fried with a lot of good flavors going on. It could make any defiant kid eat broccoli! The clam chowder was chunky, fresh and satisfying! The complimentary garlic bread went great with the clam chowder. 

My only gripe was that my Coronita came out after my food. The server didn't exactly update me on my drink either. I had to follow up with her and she said that the new bartender didn't understand the order. She assured that my drink will soon be on its way. She was genuine though so it wasn't a huge deal. 

I don't know if I'd return with so many dining options in Vegas. This restaurant is actually off the strip too. Perhaps if I wanted to try Oyster Bar but gave up again, or if I wanted a quiet dining experience away from the strip, I'd consider coming back here.

Sat in the bar for happy hour, which goes until 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays. We ordered the shrimp embrauchette and some cocktails, as well as a full meal each. 

The embrouchette was wonderful. Seafood-stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon with onion strings. $7 on happy hour. Definitely the highlight of the meal. I ordered the seafood pasta, which was pretty disappointing. My mussels were very overcooked and it was just underwhelming for $20. My friends fish and chips were decent though.

Service was 3 stars too. One lady by herself in the bar area and she seemed very nonchalant about everything. I think she was just ready to go home.

We started with happy hour drinks which were ok but then it jus went downhill quickly.
We ordered two appetizers, zucchini and calamari.
Zucchini was ok but calamari sucked and this was a seafood restaurant!!
Next we shared a seafood platter which came with a so so bread and so so salad.
On the platter was a seafood stuffed crab shell which was almost all breading, shrimp in a bad sauce, some kind of fish on the bottom of the plate and a portion of VERY bland white rice. 
My drink was never refilled and waitress sort of disappeared.

She did take six dollars off of a $49 bill.

I ordered the deep fried seafood platter. The dish was a little over done but not to the point that everything was dried out. The dish comes with onion rings - just too many. I would have rather have had more fries as these rings were like straw rings.

Will first give positives....nice quiet ambiance. Our waitress (forget her name) was pleasant and professional and did a fine job. 

I started with a bowl of lobster bisque and it was good. Loaf of bread seemed generic and the 'famous' salad was underwhelming. Not sure who deemed it famous, but nothing stood out. 

On to the entrees...Mrs got crusted tilapia Bianca. It was a lot of breading---looked like something you get at a fast food joint. It was smothered in a sauce and topped with a few pieces of shrimp (tail still on). Had marginal flavor at best. Not close to worth the $25 or so. 

I decided on the crab stuffed mahi having read descriptions of blue crab and reviews of wonderful crab cakes. Ugh. 

This is not real crab. As a native of Baltimore it's laughable. Horrible crab. Just not good. Not lump. Crab cakes have a little mayo, slight filler and some old bay like seasoning. This had none of that.  Then the poor Mahi has tough and dry- almost as inedible as the crab.

And in comes Landry's advertising their all you can eat Tuesday special. Quite pricey IMO at $55 a long cry from what Hush Puppies used to charge. It came with a quaint salad which wasn't bad and a side of mash potatoes which I put to the side, I WANT THE CRAB DAMMIT!

The first round was really good. The meat slid right out of the shell, sweet and thick. With lemon and hot butter it was delish. But wait in came the second and third round and I experienced something I have never seen before. A 2nd molted skin type layer after the shell. It was quite annoying (I posted a picture of this phenomenon) I eat the first few with this vicious layer, not to good on the pallet and fumbled for awhile trying to peel it off the rest of the crab. NOT FUN!

Service was good, sat at a booth by the bar. Server/Bartender was very friendly however seemed annoyed at another all you can eat customer due to his multi-tasking abilities I'd imagine. Each round came without asking, never really had to wait. 

I know king crab is supposed to be better than snow crab however with this 2nd layer molted shell I much rather have the snow crab, and at $55 I have to honestly say its not worth it. The ambience was nice along with the decor but they have a long way to go as far as crab quality, its was subpar to say the least.

We have passed Landry's Seafood a bunch of times, so today we decided to give them a try. Landry's Seafood is located on West Sahara Ave and is part of a plaza with shops, a bakery and David's Bridal. Once you come into the restaurant, you really get an idea of how big this place is, and it has a good set up for seating. 

We were seated, ordered our food, and it came out promptly. I ordered the Tilapia Hemingway from ""Chef Trilogy,"" which is Parmesan crusted with blue crab on top, this also comes with salad, rice pilaf, asparagus, and includes dessert- I got the Crème Brulee. The fish was cooked well, and tasty I feel like they gave a fair amount of blue for the price, the asparagus had no flavor, but the rice pilaf was good. The Crème Brulee was excellent, I could have gone for seconds and been a total glutton.

My server, while friendly enough, seemed quite disorganized. Instead of my salad, appetizer and bread all arriving together, there was at least a 10 minute interval between each. I got the impression  that because I was dining alone, I was an afterthought at best.

I got the 3-course meal for $20. The fried calamari appetizer was completely tasteless. For an entree, I got the shrimp trio (shrimp linguini, fried shrimp and shrimp rice pilaf). The shrimp were way overcooked and the entire meal  lacked any real flavor. I could just as easily have gotten the same quality of food at Long John Silvers for a fraction of the price.

We get there and see that the line is long, so we walk out and see Landry's across the street with, of course, ""OYSTERS"" written on the wall. So we thought, why not? It couldn't possibly be any busier than the small Oyster bar we attempted try.

The fist thing I noticed walking in, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. I would say out of 20 tables, only 2 were occupied. That was a bad sign, but I didn't let it get to me.

We are seated and our orders are taken. Our drinks are promptly served, and our appetizers don't come out too much later.

I had a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. It was one of the best Lobster Bisque's I've ever had. It was nicely creamy, with the hint of the lobster, and just enough ""umph"" from the spices. So, great job on that Landry's.

That's where the happy ending comes to, well, an ending. We start the waiting game for our other dishes / main courses.

I typically wait until more than one experience before writing a review, but honestly I am pretty convinced I won't be back. Unless it's an invite where the other party insists, because I won't be spending my $$ here. 
The reason there are 3 stars instead of 2, SERVICE. I can not blame the friendly hostess nor the attentive server for the lack in flavor. So by all means, credit is due in the hospitality department. 
I was in during a busy work week lunch hour. I was very happy to be seated at a booth instead of a table, even though I was dining alone. 
I ordered the fish tacos with dirty rice instead of fries. (small upcharge)
I also started with a cup of clam chowder. The soup was decent. FULL of clams, like almost overwhelming. However it would have really hit the spot had the consistency been a bit thicker. 
Still ate it all, so I approve. 
Now the tacos, probably the worst fish tacos I have ever had. Not what I expect from a place known as the ""seafood house"" Double tortillas as usual, but they were soggy. Like soggy and stuck together from either sitting under a heat lamp or even being re-heated. Same thing with the fish inside. You could tell at one point in time, it was a crispy filet. Now it was just moist and not appetizing at all. But where was the moisture coming from? I didn't seem to have this sauce that I read about in other reviews. Just cabbage, and a very very small side of avocado. I ate the avocado alone, it tasted better that way. I tried to eat only the fish out of the taco, but I couldn't do it. Flat out gross. 
To top it off, the dirty rice was at least 2-3 days old. Mushy like it had been in a rice cooker overnight. The flavor would have been ok had it been fresh. I could have put all the rice in a big ball and it would have stuck together easily. The 16 year old me would have thrown it back in the kitchen, but it just sadly sat on the plate. Untouched.

The boyfriend got a burger, cause he doesn't like seafood and wasn't a fan either.  We checked in on yelp and got the free stuffed jalapeno appetizer.  This was the ONLY thing that tasted good.

This place has about 50 tables of which 4 were occupied when we got here. Literally the whole main dining room had two tables filled. Our server was less than attentive. She was not friendly and everything we needed we had to call for her to come by. The food was anything but edible. The fried shrimp ( remember the restaurant name has Seafood House in it ) was over breaded and tough. How can a chain as Landry's mess up shrimp and fries especially at $22 dollars per plate. 
We mentioned it to the skill lacking server and she said she was ""sorry about that"". She got one plate removed from our bill but told me I had eaten to much of mine to have the manager remove it. I ate the fries first so the plate looked like I had eaten more. I am a local and this place reminds me of a tourist trap. Unfortunate as I have eaten at laundry's in other cities and been pleased.

We immediately started to have problems when our waiter came over, he seemed to be very nervous taking our table and he started sweating and his hands became unsteady. He took our drink and appetizer orders and after 15 minutes he returned only to ask us were we ready to place a drink and appetizer order. I said to him you did that 15 minutes ago and his response was ""I wasn't sure everyone was ready because everyone did not order a drink or appetizer  Then it went down hill from there. We placed orders with my wife getting the all you can eat crab legs and now it's 845 and they close at 930. At 915 my wife gets a plate of (2) TWO crab legs . 

Unacceptable,so we call the manager over and he says he'll fix it. 935 and still no crab legs delivered so at this point we are ready to go. We ask for our sever and we get a female sever saying she's going to take over and that we can sit here ordering crab legs until my wife gets full. 9:50 and still no crab legs.  They said the restaurant would stay open for us so that we can continue to order her crab legs. Not happening, I don't want a pissed off a cook making my food because he has to stay late.  Two hours of my time wasted and left here starving will never return! Not sure if our first sever was racist, high or something else but he clearly did not want to wait on us.

Unfortunately, they got lost and by the time we got there, the line was already 20 people deep. My dad suggested we try Landry's Seafood across the street, which is how we ended up here. 

The meal started off decent enough. The happy hour menu had some nice appetizers to share including the onion strings, calamari, and firecracker shrimp. My dad raved about how well-battered and fried the onion strings were. It was good, but I wasn't as impressed. I really enjoyed the shrimp, but there were literally only 7 pieces of the small, fried shrimp (making it $1 per shrimp). 

Moving on to the entrees, I got the crawfish étouffée and substituted my house salad with the lobster bisque. The bisque was literally 3 parts cream, 1 part salt, and trace amounts of elemental lobster. It was inedible. The saltine crackers were stale, which didn't help matters. On the flip side, I did enjoy the crawfish étouffée to an extent. There was bountiful amounts of crawfish meat, but not enough rice to go with the salty base. The fish & chips, shrimp po-boy, and burger that the rest of my family ordered didn't fare much better. 

While the food was lackluster and somewhat abysmal, the service was great. But, If Oyster Bar has a long wait and you're having thoughts of walking across the street for seafood, think again.

First off we were the only customers and service took way too long. If it was super busy I'd understand....My dad(not the pickiest eater) actually complained that his soup was too salty. They took it away but didn't return it with another or say sorry or anything. It was awhile back but the food was not memorable at all. 

Worst part about the visit was they told me the card couldn't be used this time. Every single time I and my co-workers used this type of gift card we Never had a problem. They had this long explanation that it had to be mailed and next visit they would honor the discount yada yada yada and some other confusing stuff.

-The fried platters are all rather bland.  Everything tastes the same and just runs together in the flavor category.

4.  I had the seafood pasta as entree, I forget the name.  It had shrimp, mussels, scallops.   I was sort of expecting a red tomato sauce, but my bad, I must have misinterpreted the menu, it was just spaghetti with diced tomatoes and mushrooms, there wasnt really a sauce on the pasta, maybe some oil. The pasta besides that was plain and without much flavor. I had to add salt and cheese.

The alcohol ranges from $2-$5- 28 selections; beer, well, & cocktails.

We had the Fish Tacos (2)  with shoestring fries $5, Buffalo Chicken Sliders (3) with shoestring fries $5, and Crab, Spinach, & Artichoke Dip (huge) with pico de gallo & tortilla chips $5. Everything was delicious. The fish tacos had chipotle ranch sauce, which was flavorful and zesty. The Buffalo Sliders (the server suggested this) had just the right amount of spice. The dip was huge and the spinach really gave it an extra touch. My husband thought the fries were better than ""In & Out"" - still don't understand the fascination with that place, but that's another conversation. Also, my husband had two beers. The bill? A little over $21.00. We didn't finish everything. Great service, although very busy, still tended to us.

Here we are on a Wednesday night around 8pm -pretty light crowd but the place looks like its trying to hard to be  ritzy for a chain steak & seafood place-you know formal but jeans are ok.

There's a bar off to the side and a small lobster tank with 2 pathetic looking lobsters right as you enter the dining room. Boothes line the wall and small 4 chair table fill the room.

We were seated immediately in a booth and after about 10 minutes our waiter-#Jacob arrived to take our drink order. We went ahead and place our entire order since we were hungry & thirsty!!!

We decided to try their spin on a traditional app-Crab,Spinach& Artichoke dip and then the wife ordered the CRAB FEAST with a little of everything crab-Legs,Balls,Cakes and more. and I ordered the 12 oz Ribeye and Baked Potato.

The food came out alot faster than the 1st appearance-1st they brought a house salad with house dressing and the dip came out quick too.The dip was great-not fishy as I had feared but rather rich and creamy not unlike regular SPinach & artichoke dip. 

The main course was FANTASTIC!! One of the best under $50 steaks I've ever had(actually ONLY $22) cooked perfectly mediem-rare seasoned well and smooth like butter:) You could literally cut it with a SPOON:)

The crab was less than impressive. ONLY 2 crab legs for $40!!! WTF!~!!! The Fried Crab Balls were awful-too much cornmeal or whatever and no flavor. The crab cake the same and the Au Gratin Crab Meat was just whack-Where's the CRAB,huh? Definitely a better deal to get a STEAM POT at Joe's Crab Shack or the Krazy Buffet all-you-can-eat crab for $15.

The rice had a weird wet texture that you can't tell from the picture. It was soggy which in my experience of making rice is not a good thing. 

The Banana's Foster was my favorite part of the meal. How could you go wrong with vanilla ice cream, caramel and bananas? It's one of my go to desserts that hardly ever disappoints. The service was also very good and prompt.

Additionally they put some weird sauce on the bottom of the plate which  I felt did not compliment the cakes.  My Freind had the clam chowder which she said was also ver good.

Without any reservations we were seated immediately. 

Lobster Bisque: 2/5 very few pieces of lobster which were very small. It was cold- not even warm. A lil too creamy and not too flavorful. 

Crawfish Étouffée: 5/5 **DELICIOUS** served w/ fluffy white rice & temperature was just right. Very delicious (did I say that already ? Lol) every night had crawfish and was seasoned just right. Consistent  was perfect !

Shrimp Grits: 3/5 The shrimp tasted old and stale. Grits were average and the sauce was a bit over whelming. There was just too much onions. 

Bananas Foster: 4/5 The sauce and banana was poured over the vanilla icecream when served. The crispy crepe dipped in chocolate was chewy and sweet. Perfect accompaniment. Sauce was not too sweet. Delicious ending to our dinner 

Our dinner included the house salad which was just your average mixed greens. The dressing was on the tart side.

They closed off the back dining area with partitions and since there were just 20 of us, there was a lot of space. The service was great! We had 2-3 servers and runners bringing food and making sure our drinks stayed full. It was a good time. 

Crab, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip ($13.75): Served with pico de gallo and tortilla chips. This was a nice dip. Good flavors and the crab managed to come through. 

Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms ($11.75): Roasted Cremini mushrooms, mushroom cream, and parmesan. The mushrooms had a lot of stuffing, which was nice, but I didn't really care for the overall dish.

Crispy Onion Strings and Jalapeños ($8.75): Really thin fried onion strings piled high with red bell peppers and ranch dressing. These were tasty!

Firecracker Shrimp ($10.50): Tempura-fried shrimp with a creamy sweet chili glaze. I think we've all had this shrimp somewhere. I've had it at Bonefish Grill and the clubhouse at Anthem Country Club. I don't think the dish even had different names and they always taste the same. Anyway, I know it's terribly unhealthy, but that glaze is delicious and it's fantastic with the tempura shrimp. I love it!

Famous Salad Bowl: Served with all entrees. I didn't see it on the menu a la carte. I don't know what type of dressing is used, but I did not like it. Plus, I hate when my salad is drenched with dressing. It's so unappetizing. The bowl was actually FILLED with dressing after the salad was removed. The contents of the salad were unmemorable.

Shrimp Jambalaya ($21.75): The usual suspects, Andouille sausage, shrimp, Tasso ham, okra; served with Jasmine rice. Ruben and I love Jambalaya and we usually order it if it's on the menu. This one was all right. I didn't like the broth which was sweeter than I prefer.

Ribeye ($32.75): Chargrilled and served with a Salt-Crusted Baked Potato. The steak was disappointedly thin. Not enough flavor. The potato was decent.

Bananas Foster: The sauce was placed in a separate container to pour over the vanilla ice cream; fantastic since I hate when the ice cream is completely melted. Although, the ice cream was placed in a thin fried bowl that was disgusting and inedible. It reeked of old, overused frying oil and whatever was fried in it (like our appetizers). I can't believe they would use the same oil to fry their seafood and their desserts. So gross.

Cinnamon Bread Pudding: The flavors weren't bad (mostly due to the tasty caramel sauce), but the bread pudding itself wasn't very good. The bread was really dense and didn't have much flavor or moisture. It was just a large cube of compacted bread.

Key Lime Pie: I found the pie much too sweet with not enough tang from the key lime. Which is odd since I find a lot of key lime pies too sour!

Accommodations were fantastic and the staff was wonderful. The food, on the other hand, left much to be desired. It wasn't my cup of tea.

We arrived around 6 PM and were promptly seated in a booth; however, we almost immediately switched to a table because the booth seats sink in quite a bit so you're almost eye level with the table! Throughout our meal the dining room remained quiet even though the restaurant was at least halfway full. 

Our server Tina was very professional and helpful throughout the meal. She suggested several appetizers and entrees without being pushy, and she was also able to describe several dishes that we asked about.

My suggestion: Get the lobster tail. WOW this is good and buttery. We got one to split between the three of us and we DEVOURED it. I also recommend the Landry's Gumbo (which my husband ordered), which is a spicy and savory soup made with shrimp, rice, sausage, and other delicious tidbits. I ordered the Coastal Seafood Pasta, which was HUGE and came with a multitude of different seafood. Don't order either the Gumbo or the pasta if you don't like a fishy aftertaste; however, I love seafood and enjoyed both. We also got a slice of chocolate cake to go, which was quite good but not as rich as I expected. 

My favorite part of the meal was my Captain's Punch cocktail, which came in a beautiful glass with a cherry and orange on the side. I could have easily put away a few more of those!

Perhaps Landry's is positioned as a family restaurant as quite a few diners were younger women with children. Not a problem for me, but add the odd music channel playing overhead at an unnecessarily loud volume and the ""sound stew"" became a distraction.

Stopped by this iconic seafood restaurant this afternoon for a little birthday lunch! I signed up for a Landry's club card years ago for $25 and since I faithfully receive $25 every year for my birthday! #Score

The crawfish bread $10.50 was amazing! Packed with flavor and the French bread had a nice crunch! Definitely a great appetizer to start with! 

Blackened Shrimp Fettuccine $16.90 The Shrimp was cooked perfectly and the blackened seasoning wasn't overbearing. Very filling!

My mommy dearest ordered the seafood platter which was pretty basic but at $18.90 (pretty cheap) I know why. The oysters were very small but my mom shared they were pretty yummy. The ""Basa"" fish served is in the catfish family also known as Swai. This fish is extremely controversial and very inexpensive hence the $18.90 platter. 

Overall lunch was great and I sincerely appreciate our server Brooklyn for being so polite and really knowing her stuff!

Came here with a bunch of friends on friday for happy hour which is from 3 to 7 I believe.  The place is cute but its not a date night kind of place.  Its like a family/old people fancy diner kind of a feel.  We sat at the bar and they have a good happy hour menu.  Select beers for only 2 bucks!!  How can you beat that??  Cocktails and wines for 5 dollars.  Food ranges from 4 to 7 i think.  Between us we got the edamame, the crab balls, fish taco, fried green tomatoes and the buffalo sliders.  

Sliders were huge portions!  Came with fries.  Pretty decent for the price.  The friend green tomatoes were just ok.  I was really excited about it but it tasted like fried firm tomatoes.  The crab balls were a little dissapointing.  It has a lot of breading and the crab tasted a little fishy.  The bed of onion fries it came on was good though.

I would also say that the fish taco was ok.  They gave you a tiny dollop of quac, which was pretty good.  Otherwise it was decent.  Nothing too special or that memorable.  

I was initially really excited to come here but after trying everything, I was underwhelmed.  Food is decently cheap but just lack flavor.  Atmosphere was meh... nothing fancy or sexy.   Service was good.  I think people just come here for the cheap drinks.  Would not come otherwise because dinner entrees are 20-40 bucks.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,3,3,OXGgR-x5vB4hc7iRY86ZzQ

Go for it!! I say and we walk in.  Nice live jazz going on in the bar, so we ask for a booth in there.  Our waitress was actually the bartender and she was super great.

Appetizer - Beef steak tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella -  buffalo mozzerella cheese, balsamic vinegar and purple onion.   This was soo flavorful and the cheese was quality. 

Salad - both our dinners came with a garden salad but our waitress was cool and UPGRADED us to a cobb salad for free.  That salad was good and waaaaay too big for both of us to finish.

Seafood Platter ( Hungry One's order) - fresh fish, stuffed shrimp, stuffed crab, shrimp & oysters all fried.  OMG can you say ""Hog Heaven""?? Wow he ate all of it folks!! I only got to tast a stuffed shrimp but my man said it was ALL good, not greasy or overcooked at all. I was afraid if I reached over I would come up missing a finger or something.

Chilean Sea Bass Madrid (my order) - Parmesan crusted with Mornay sauce w/ pine nuts, artichoke hearts & mushrooms topped with shrimp and scallops. This also came w/ parmesan risotto.

This meal was truly to die for!! I can not say enough about the flavor and the quality of the fish and toppings and that dang risotto rice was heavenly!!

First let me say that Rosa was one of the best waitress's I've ever had! Five stars to Rosa! She was so friendly and great-I can't wait to go back and see her! My steak was a 4 but all in all a good dinner. Loved the salad and garlic bread, my baked potato was perfect. For once my steak was cooked perfect! it's a chain restaurant  with  typical decor. There's a lot of competition in Vegas so that is hard for a older restaurant to compete. The blackened shrimp was yummy. On Tuesday they have crab all you can eat. We didn't order it but I noticed a lot of people eating it. Ask for ROSA!!!",YZbfmhKsWCqoq8P0_iFv9w,13,11,4,rAypmNCYDjL92mOfSGPbZA

We highly suggest one of the Chef Specials (usually in the lower left hand corner of the menu). My wife had the (Chef Special) parmigian encrusted tilapia which includes rice pilaf and asparagus.  Her meal also included salad and dessert and all for only $20.  I had the cedar plank salmon which includes salad and vegetable. Both meals were served with fresh garlic bread and delicious. 

Our waiter Dru was fantastic. He provided great guest service as he was attentive to our needs without being overbearing. 

Here are a couple tips:  1. Join the Landr's Select Club.  You receive a $25 credit towards your bill after spending $250.  You also receive a bonus $25 credit during your birthday month.  2.  Try their happy hour.  Great food and drink prices in the bar.",Igju-tNzMmIn4LRldU5WrA,4,0,5,cgloQN28H6zkD5PGwc6TLQ

5663562,2016-02-15,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"We dined here on Valetine's day and it was a busy place. We have always loved the food here and come quite often, usually for a couple happy hour drinks and apps in the bar before going to the dining room.  Since it was Valentines day there was no happy hour so we were able to go right to our table.  Our waitress Marcie was quick to the table to take our drink order.  We ordered teas but then decided to have a bottle of wine instead,  She happily switched out the teas for us.  Soon came that nice garlic butter loaf of hot bread they serve and we love.
Our order was taken and the nice large bowl of house salad and dressing was brought.  She topped it with fresh ground black pepper. Our meals came a little quicker than we liked because we had not finished with our salads when our entrees came out.  From here on out while our food was cooked and tasted perfect the service was downhill from there.  Marcie was hard to pin down as she was working 4 or 5 tables and really not able to give the tables the attention needed.  We kept trying to get extra sauces, refilled waters, a fork dropped on the floor and we needed a new one, more of that hot bread and even the bill took for ever.  Yes, it was probably one of the busiest days of the year but she should have been able to handle all the table.  If not for the service I would have rated it 4 stars.

The bar wasn't to crowded and had plenty of Happy Hour appetizers and drink specials to choose from. We ordered the calamari, fish tacos, lobster bisque soup and tempura shrimp. I must say the tempura shrimp was the best! They almost melted in your mouth! The lobster bisque was quite tasty as well.
I also ordered a mango mojito(not a fan of mango), but the bartender said I should try it even if I am not a fan of mango. I took his suggestion, and yes, it was very refreshing and the mango flavor was not very strong.
All in all, I had a fabulous time and the staff was pleasant and very welcoming.

5793417,2014-04-07,0,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"This review is for the bar service at Happy Hour:

Had the serious displeasure of being waited on by the female bartender (Joanna?). She rarely acknowledged my friend and I, but when she did it was with a very bad attitude. She acted like it was a big inconvenience to wait on people. We would have had several drinks here, but we just couldn't track her down, so we only had two. The appetizers were a big disappointment as well, cold and late. 

Long story short: Happy Hour would be a great idea here if it wasn't for such crap service and bad food. Better to leave this place to the Palace Station crowd who are too cheap to hit the strip.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,1,0,1,M7gfYsPLJEIgjNIIolQ_7Q

The last time was awesome and we were so impressed with the food quality that I wanted to go back.
The one meal came out completely wrong and had no taste to it and had very little seafood in it.
The managers response was ""It looks like it wasn't tossed correctly""
That meal was changed totally. 
The waitress we had was very friendly and polite the entire time and very apologetic.
The manager  knowing it was Mother's day offered a free dessert I guess to make up for the problem. 
I guess sometimes it's better to go to someplace you have been to more than once.

5837927,2015-03-19,2,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"There were ups and downs on my last visit to Landry's.  I liked the inside of Crab Stuffed Avocados that were stuffed with crabmeat but not so much the fried golden coating.  A bowl of New England Clam Chowder with bacon was thick and creamy.  Garlic Bread was great.  And Red Fish with candied pecans, roasted vegetables, and Lemon Beurre Blanc was moist, tender, and very enjoyable.

But while a Salad Bowl with Homemade Honey Mustard Balsamic Dressing was otherwise excellent, tomato pieces were few.  Diane's Lobster Tail was woefully undercooked, so had to be sent back for more heat.  And she initially received a Baked Potato with sour cream and cheese instead of cheese, butter, and bacon as ordered.   

Service was friendly and otherwise efficient.  And I received a free Creme Brulee for my birthday (which I chivalrously turned over to Diane).

Thus, 3-1/2 stars overall on this occasion, which is a 1-1/2 star drop from our last experience here.  Hopefully the kitchen just had an erratic off night.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,6,3,ij8LmCg-3i_OLmkYcMgj-A

The service is good, the ambiance of the restaurant is excellent. I usually sit at the bar this week I was with two small groups so I ate at the table. Got the crab cake both times. Super. It has changed from what I remember but is still excellent. A little bit more crab meat would be good but I still love it. The salad with house dressing is still as great as it always was. I went on Tuesday April 9th, 2013 the first time. My entree was the halibut which they said just came in. Now halibut was the first dish I ever had here about 10 years ago and it was so good. It was thick and just flaked apart when you touched it with the fork. On this day, it was about half the portion size, tough, and just didn't taste good. What a let down. The rest of the meal was great. I went again on 4/15 and had the crab cake again (super), salad and this time I had the Snapper Hemingway.  Absolutely perfect. I woke up thinking about how good this piece of fish was. Can't wait to go back this summer for more. Its also about 8 bucks cheaper than the halibut. Also the light beers in the tall iced glasses make everything taste better.  Bill first time for 3 people with desserts $190 second time for 2 people no desserts $110.

I guess I should have given 4 stars, but that Halibut was so bad and so expensive",nk8tKj3-V-7s2cbqGNwo1A,1,0,3,O1HCcWzMftay6tSsZkKyQQ

I've been a handful of times to this location (ya know, it's a chain right?).  They have a menu of mainly seafood items (hence the name...hello), easy/peasy quick lunches, and near fine-dining as the lights dim in the evening.

If that's not enough, they offer a terrific happy hour with all kinds of specials, and TV's featuring all the sports you can handle.

Service can be a little slow, perhaps it's the staffing levels vs training or caliber.  But, all the servers, managers, and hostesses have been super nice and friendly each time I've gone.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,6,2,4,tnErLlXzP4TDlhDT1m-5jQ

5992482,2014-07-26,1,vzrcPqSdRY41GoO5DR5pYA,"Came in for lunch with family. Food was great however the service today was not.  We ordered our drinks and it took the waitress about 20 mins to come back with them after she served a group of 6 that came in after us.  She had someone else bring us our drinks and it was probably because I kept looking around to find her.  When she came to take our order she seemed like she didn't really want to be at work or something because her response to our questions were one word.  I ordered the king crab with a baked potato and asked for the crab to be cracked and no chives on my potato. After placing our order, she tells us in a rude manner ""is that all"".  The complimentary salad was not fresh and taste odd. Once we received our order, the server placed a ""hot"" plate in front of my son and swooshed his hand when he attempted to touch it.  I understand not wanting him to burn himself but why place it directly in front of him if it's that hot?  The plate was not hot at all as the server mentioned and I was pretty upset with her swooshing my son's hand away.  When my king crab and potato came, it was not cracked and I had an overwhelming amount of chives on my potato.  I did not receive anything to crack them with, butter, or anything that normally comes with a crab lunch/dinner order.  I asked if they could be taken back and cracked and the server says ""oh I forgot to put that in the computer"". Not a problem. She takes them back and it takes 10 mins to get them back. We eat our meal, and our server does not return for quiet sometime. We see her waiting on other tables but she never makes it back to our table until I begin looking around for her again. She finally comes and ask if we need anything and refills our drinks.  We finish our meal, pay and leave. We have never had bad service prior to this visit, and I give 3 stars because the food was good as always. Service could have been so much more better. Hopefully next time we visit it will be great service.",oVkxQkUrJujd50AIpeS15g,1,0,3,7RCSeYvS5vR8QoWQzBNyjg
