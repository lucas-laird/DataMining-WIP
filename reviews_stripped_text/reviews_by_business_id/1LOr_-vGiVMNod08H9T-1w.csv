832277,2011-07-24,0,1LOr_-vGiVMNod08H9T-1w,"We order out a couple times a week. My notes on Sunset Pizzeria show that we have ordered delivery from them six times. Pizzas came hot and tasty but, wife would have liked it cooked a little more she likes the bottom crust crunchy. She orders a large (16"") with pepperoni. The pizza came with no extra flood of oil all over. The sauce was tasty with a spice twinge and the cheese was melted deep. Pepperoni was hat and snappy for what was a great pie.

I had eggplant bake and a chicken bake. Both hot with a very nice marinara and good stringy cheese with it's own flavor. Nice pieces of fried eggplant and some very moist chicken for the other meal.We ordered a Chef Salad to split. The meats were rolled and cut as pinwheels. There was a lot of cold cuts rolled on this salad. Our salad was also mixed with black olive sliced, some pepperoncini, some red onion, nice tomato wedges, a hard boiled egg sliced in half, and a generous amount of lettuce that was torn in good sized pieces. They suggested their own italian dressing that I found flavorful but, a little acrid. The ""Boys"" split an order of spaghetti with meatballs (2). Great marinara and a couple very large dense and well cooked meatballs. The pasta was well cooked for my taste I'm not a fan of real la dente. The portion fed the two boys and made their eyes roll. It filled them both up. We were supplied with plane crunchy bread and a small loaf of garlic bread that i managed to devour by myself.

All this was delivered in an hour hat and ready to eat. The delivery guy was very pleasant, helpful, and provided us with suggestions for our next order. 

I doubt that Sunset Pizzeria will go without at least one order a week from us ""Stay at Homers"". On the weekends we go out and during we order out a lot. You like Italian style food, You like Pizza, you like Stromboli???
Give the SUNSET PIZZERIA a try. You'll be going back again. See what you get for the price. You can't pass this up.",3WHmc6WQ_jk_fIp-dJDKyA,0,0,5,Gxd8g_EcegSEfGcBg01CKA
906220,2010-08-18,5,1LOr_-vGiVMNod08H9T-1w,"Yesterday was the second time I have enjoyed pizza from Sunset Pizzeria. I waited to after this last time to post my review just in-case the first time was a fluke. I don't give out 5-stars very easily especially since I am a Pizza Snob. Anyway, now I am now a fan. 

The thing that stuck me was lack of grease the pepperoni had. Usually when you order a pepperoni pizza, there is a huge grease puddle at the bottom of the box. Don't get me wrong, I used to love my pizza like I loved my women, hot, fresh, and a little greasy! Now that I am older and have more common sense, I still like hot and fresh pizza, but I can do without the heart-attack juice.",zFszUTKwfFIWK6EAYCyR7Q,2,0,5,kPnDyZk2cl9-Fzzr9TB-Gw
1166732,2012-04-05,0,1LOr_-vGiVMNod08H9T-1w,"We ordered this through eat24 online.  The menu looked appealing, but that was as far as the appeal went.

Delivery took the entire 60mins of the 45-60min delivery time, which they charged a $2 delivery fee for.  It didn't take long for the delivery man to ask for his cash tip, either.

We ordered a chicken and pizza philly cheese steak with an order of onion rings.  The order was thrown into a plain plastic bag with no structure.  This meant that the little plastic container with dressing(?I don't know what for exactly) had exploded and was all over the inside of the bag.

When we got to the food it was horrible.  The onion rings were fried in an oil that tasted like it hadn't been changed in a few years.  I'm not sure if they use real cheese on the phillys, but it doesn't taste good.  At first I thought that it was a philly made with thick mayo.  Nope, that's the ""cheese,"" you'll find out the hard way when you realize that it's cooled to be solid.

Not even the soda was good.  They need to have their lines cleaned, or their carbonation callibrated, the Diet Coke tasted like it had dirt in it.  The Coca-Cola Company would be sad their image is being smeared.

Don't waste your money, expect good service, or good food.  You'll have a better night if you heed my warnings.",U7KeVgZQ4AMdI8huLws50w,0,0,1,8e7E_QQWgMHr9e25e9yNyw

The sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. 
I had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50.

1549221,2012-02-17,2,1LOr_-vGiVMNod08H9T-1w,"Stopped in for a quick lunch after having passed it up about a thousand times.  Located inside an industrial complex, it would be easy to pass up if you weren't looking for it.

Went with two slices of the Sicilian and then tried a slice of the New York style. Not great, not horrible but a-ok. If I ever go back I would defiantly ask for ""well done, please.""

Beware of the quarter just outside the door that you might tempt you to want to pick up.  It's cemented to the concrete and thus unobtainable unless you have a jackhammer.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,2,0,3,6WzEXdP75VHoYpsdbRGxiA

1927126,2011-12-07,0,1LOr_-vGiVMNod08H9T-1w,"I have only had a few things on the menu, the pizza, and the Philly Cheesesteaks.  My favorite item is easily the Philly with peperoni on it.  Having peperoni added to a Phily is a phenomenal idea that taste soooo good.  Also the prices are pretty good, I got a Philly with Fries and a drink for about $8.50.  Also the pizza is pretty good as well and they have some cheap combos with like 2 slices and a drink for really cheap.  It may not be the greatest pizza, but it's good.  Some might consider it a litle greasy, but I actually like it the way it is, and it has good flavor to it.  People have always been pretty nice here.

Got the meatballs strombol/calzone whatever they called it but it was was the best one of those I've ate, right out of the oven (about 15 mins to make), everything from the dough shell that kept it all together, chunks of mozzarella, meatball, marinara, onions and pepper was delicious.  it was pretty good size too for about $8.  I ate half and was stuff, enjoyed it that much that an hour later i finished the rest no matter how full i was.  

They have a pretty good lunch special menu of 13 choices ranging from about $6-9 all including drinks.

Located close to sunset park, if i had more time i would've ate it at the park outside in the sun. Stromboli took around 15 mins to make so I would order by phone first. Everything else they usally make quickly.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,2,0,4,S_abPrC1k3RU_qG2QEb9lw
2668892,2010-09-15,1,1LOr_-vGiVMNod08H9T-1w,"Maybe the pepperoni has the same mind altering properties as magic mushrooms because there is no way the other reviewers are reviewing this pizzeria. 

The women behind the counter and the guy making the pizza were both very friendly and welcoming.  I picked up a menu (pamphlet)  while waiting for my pizza to come out and it reminded me of the Verrazano's Pizza menu in its style and a good portion of its offerings.  So far I was impressed with Sunset Pizzeria. 

A few minutes pass and my pizza comes out and was piping hot. It looked amazing. The cheese pizza here could pass for extra cheese at most other pizzerias. The first slice tasted pretty good. I'm not sure if it was my near starvation that made it taste good or that fact that it was molten lava hot so my taste buds were scorched from my mouth. The second slice I started to come to my senses and my taste buds regenerated. I could tell there was something  I wasn't a fan of. Third time is the charm right? Nope After the third slice I was convinced the quality was sub par and my hungry belly tapped out. 

Normally I can easily eat 4-5 slices in my hunger state but  Sunset Pizzeria your flavors or lack there of just didn't do it for me.  

It's not that its bad but its not at all good either. I could easily give the service 4 stars  and bump it up to a 3 star review but doing so would be a disservice to fellow Yelpers.  I find Sunset Pizzeria a place you could easily skip and your taste buds will thank me for it. 

If you must try it its near the bank across from  Sunset Park directly across the lot from Egg and I. The map on Yelp is deceiving.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,3,0,2,grOsrKhEyHEbybSZbK9Zxg

I usually just call & pick up or have them deliver, but yesterday I stayed and ate there. They checked on us multiple times, and were very polite.

We've gotten a plain cheese pie which is great and have also tried the pepperoni and mushroom. The sauce is yummy and a bit tangy not sweet like some other sauces. The crust is my favorite. Thick enough to hold together the sauce, cheese and toppings but not too thick. The whole pie is cooked until the crust is crispy but not too done.

The sausage and meatball pizzas were up to par with my standards of a real pizza.

The pepperoni... oh my... the pepperoni pizza was AMAZING!  Something about it.  First of all, I usually do not go for pepperoni pizza, but this one looked so juicy I decided to go for it!

Their pepperoni is not some thin-slized version, this one was actually noticeably thicker than others and the taste was so savory.  I found myself eating even the crust on this one.  It wasn't too greasy and it definitely hit the spot.  The dough of the crust was exceptional and cooked just right... In fact I think I'll have myself one more slice right now!

The place is hidden and has a no-frills pizzeria decor, but more importantly the food is good. I had the Philly cheese steak sandwich and my dining partner some pizza. The fries that came with my meal were thick cut and delicious. The cheese on my Philly was good provolone, and the sandwich bun was light and crispy. The thin cut steak with mushrooms, bell peppers and onions was awesome. The pizza was good too, albeit a little on the greasy side -- but that could have been the pepperoni.

I wanted a steak sub no cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, thats it...  I tried this Sunset Pizza today,,, at the corner of Eastern and Sunset, tucked away in the shopping center... I ordered the steak sub with fries and a drink for $7.50.  I have to say that i really liked this sandwich, there was a good amount of meat, the fries,, what made this stand out was the sub roll...

It was a great lunch for my son and I. Also I walked into the door of my house holding leftovers and ate another piece. I'm not certain if this is a matter of my bad habits or the great taste of their pizza.

I'd say that the crust is a little too sweet. The sauce is a bit acidic like I can feel the heartburn coming on. At least it's not that slap your tastebuds around nasty tang stuff. It's a good NY tomato tasting sauce.

The lady that works there is nothing like my mom, but she is so sweet I wish my mom were more like her. My 7 year old son loved the place, but that would explain why he was the one who recommended it.",UOM7K9g2aFUgi30H_oebPg,0,0,4,zLZOiwZzokJ2BWGe_9PrbA
