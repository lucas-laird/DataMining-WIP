I literally sat down for less than 20 seconds and didn't even have my purse off of my shoulder before our server was hounding us for a drink order. Having never been there, I had to quickly glance at the menu which listed Pepsi products, so I ordered a pepsi. She then tells me that they only have Coke products. (??) So Coke it is, fine.  She returns a minute later ready to take our lunch order and proceeds to explain the Manager's special is ""The Original"".  Again, 1st time there, so I order the special and she asks if I would like everything on the burger.  Everything BUT mustard, I tell her. My Husband orders a patty melt.  Food arrived and I literally had a mustard soaked burger.  We tell the manager, who apologizes (although I'm feeling this was not out of sincerity, but rather obligation) and offers to make another burger.  But I explain that I am on my lunch break and do not have enough time to wait for another burger to be prepared, eat it, and travel back to work.  The server also then comes over and apologizes.  Fine.  I ate less than 40% of the burger that had the least amount of mustard on it.  There was so much of it that it was literally on my rings, and my fingers were yellow, no joke!  Then the bill arrives and I couldn't believe that there was no offer of a discount whatsoever.  What a poor first (and last) trip to Johnny Rockets.

Very warm welcome for us, as a Brit & an Aussie we instantly hit it off with the staff and had a laugh.

Our first impressions when we walked in was that the place was really  clean, they had jukeboxes and it was playing 50's music.
I ordered their regular hamburger as well as an Oreo shake, which was recommended by our server.
Our food arrived in about five minutes and wow, this is not your average hamburger!!!!!
It was delicious! The shake was thick and well worth the money.
 I only wished the hamburgers would come with fries as they were all separate but considering how yummy everything tasted it doesn't matter!
 The manager was in fact the person who served our food, she was very nice and had a Russian accent.
 She was nice enough to even split our checks 3 ways after we got the receipt and told her we forgot to mention separate receipts.

It was refreshing to get out and walk here.  When we got there, we seated ourselves and our server came over and made us feel welcome and at home, though we were hundreds of miles away from home.  I enjoyed being in the 1950's diner vibe because those were the better days of food service compared to the more corporate feel you get today.

So, when it came time to placing our order, my friend and I each got Rocket Doubles and a side of onion rings to share and I got a bowl of chili for myself.  At first, we thought that we didn't order enough food and then it showed up and we began eating it.  Toward the end of the meal, we realized that it was definitely a lot of food and we were really hungry when we showed up.  We barely finished our burgers and then the last of the onion rings which then left us bursting at the seams.

Overall, the food was really good and something different from the offerings at HRH.  I think our total came out to $30 with tip so it wasn't that expensive compared to what you would get at most hotels.  Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back!",bSY04kIrbB3J9cyNBiKfcQ,0,0,4,dISjidt5SMjCypjuHr11qA

1648108,2009-08-31,0,CXxJkD62XtDrt3pRYNDspg,"I have always enjoyed the old malt shop feel at the themed burger restaurants. Ruby's, Fatburger (although not that themed) and Johnny Rockets. The first and last are more restaurants then fast food however. 

I have recently visited the Johnny Rocket's across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and like always, I thoroughly enjoyed my time. However, as some posters have stated, you do pay a premium for the atmosphere. This is not a ""quick and cheap"" burger like McDonald's, but more of an experience. Something you may only do once every two months. 

The woman that helped me was kind and courteous and I wish I could remember her name. She was quick and attentive and on top of her game when it came to refilling my drink. My last go at the eatery was a Chicken Club Sandwich, with 1/2 and 1/2 fries and onion rings. Splitting the rings and fries is great, but I sometimes wish I had more rings, so maybe next time, I will get the rings alone. 

I have also noticed some new menu items (at least new to me). One of these items is a cobb salad and I can see that as a big seller if people aren't interesting in eating red meat (or turkey burgers).

My friend reallyreallyreally wanted to check out UNDFTD during our last trip.  Since it was lunch time by the time we got there, we walked just a few feet away to Johnny Rockets, located in the same strip mall.

It was my first time eating here.  If I recall correctly, we were the only customers, but our waiter was polite and efficient during the entire meal.  I ordered a Coke with the chocolate flavor shot and a tuna melt sandwich (I don't eat hamburgers).  The Coke was interesting in concept, but the chocolate was only obvious (to both my friend and I) as an aftertaste.  The tuna melt was edible but extremely small.  I also tried the onion rings/french fries combo that my friend ordered.  Both of them were decent.

On a completely different note (and to no fault of any of the employees), the 50s music started to drive me crazy about halfway through the meal.  By the end of our visit though, seeing the pretty cheap tab that I needed to pay (for the both of us) more than made up for any of the audial ""dislike"" I had experienced just a short while before.

Three stars for JR - it's definitely not my favorite fast food in LV, but it's definitely not the worst.",E8Z5Aojv-a5pfKlEMKkulQ,0,1,3,2xTLsNDSImWHqSq9Ks91jw

I had never been to a Johnny Rockets before. Our group of 10 stopped in on a Saturday afternoon, when only 4 other tables were occupied.

Most of the drinks came out wrong... Even the waters went to the wrong people. Milk shakes were served in dirty glasses. The food ordering was disorganized. Then, the food came out, some 10 minutes later, others 35 minutes later. Many of the orders were wrong.

One person ordered ""No Onions"". The burger had onions. She asked to have another one with no onions... They scrapped them off and gave it back to her... You could smell it... It was honestly insulting.

I really assumed that a national chain, located across the street from a major resort would have some standards and/or some self respect, but no... They really just did not care about how anything was presented.

My chicken club featured a pathetic piece of meat, charred bacon and flavorless tomatoes. The sandwich was around $8 and included no side, no even a pickle.

Not to be vulgar, but I was in the bathroom right after leaving... So there was something in my sandwich that was no clean or not very natural.

I would not return if they offered me a free meal. It was that bad. Maybe they should close so a good place can open in what is otherwise a decent shopping center.",rdysF0ymVkMX82Bu_8x3nA,1,1,1,aWtgxzvJsfPH1h37s1zfpQ

I always loved their hotdogs, burgers, shakes and chili cheese fries!!! Well, today my BF and I decided to come by and revisit our childhood memories for dinner with an old fashioned burger, fries and shake. He ordered the smokehouse burger and I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken burger while we shared regular fries and a chocolate banana shake. Well, if you see the picture I uploaded of my burger, you can see the photo of how it should've looked like right next to it. 1, the menu said it was romaine lettuce...well it was iceberg that I got. 2. The chicken on the photo looked seasoned and amazing...the chicken I got was completely flavorless and barely cooked thoroughly I could barely tell if it was healthy so I didn't finish it. Good thing my BF enjoyed his burger and our shake was actually good. As for the fries... Let's talk about them while I also talk about the service. 

Service was very very slow. Food took look to make and then throughout the meal, when we would want our waitress's attention, she was doing other things keeping her from seeing us. Our waters never got refilled. AND we nearly finished our burgers and we had to question if our fries were on their way to find out she forgot them. After when we finished and wanted the check, it was so hard trying to get her attention, it took forever to get it. 

Overall, we were disappointed and will probably leave our great memories of Johnny Rockets as kids in our head and maybe not be back unless we're craving for a decent milkshake",X7zysG3Cja6G2blwDyE76Q,1,0,2,C6KbnEIgb0gADi765DnIbg

So I went over to where I wanted to sit and the husband followed. Once in the booth that was all mine I put down my coach bag and pulled out my phone and checked in and gave a tip on yelp.com then it happen.
 He walked over gave us menus and lord he was such a downer. Hello he said I said Hi. Can I ask you a question he said if a girl breaks up with you after you buy her a apple 5 phone and then text you weeks later and said she was thinking about you would you take her back?
 I replied NO you must love your self and anyone willing to drop you is not for you. But I can tell your gonna take her back because if you and I were on the same page you would not be messing with me doing my dinner time to bug me about some girl who don't want u. She texted you and said she was thinking about you not that she wanted you back. Find a church and something better to do with your time because this girl is not for u. He laughed and said other people have told him the same thing. So I took a moment to pat myself on the back. I told him hey other people and I cant be wrong. If a million people are telling you something must be some truth to it. 
After that he went on and on about this girl about 20 mins later He's using profanity like he's not at work and I said to myself he has 3 mins to get away from my table before I ask to talk to his manager. 
  I was able to get him to bring our burger fires and onion rings (Please see my pictures) Now the husband ate his food soon as it got their. I on the other hand had to see my food go from hot to room temp because skippie or whatever his name is ugh Is still going on and on about this girl and asking me about this and that. So he gets a clue to leave so...I eat...& Oh wow I was blown away at how good this burger is.
 I don't know if I have angered the God's this week or what but Boy with girl issues comes back and gives a ticket I'm like look I want apple pie and my husband wants a orange shake so he opens the ticket back up and bring us the sweet stuff and I'm like ooooo! Its got a tooth pick in my apple pie a la mode that's different. Now skippie gave me a fork I was like it's dessert love I need a spoon. I had enough of that boy to be honest with you. I hurry up and ate and ran to the car.

Ask for water.. And didn't get my water until my food came to my table. The burger had so much mustard and mayo.. It was disgusting! I told the server that my burger wasn't good.. He offer to issue a refund. Then, he brought my change back.. But, never gave me a refund but, actually gave me less money!!!!! I was totally shocked. I told him about the money issue and he kept insisting he gave me the correct change? I told him to check his cameras and continue to argue with me, from across the restaurant he kept arguing with me.

I was wrong as their prices were very fair.

Burgers are less than $10 but don't include fries.

I took my little bro and my cousin as they love burgers.

Both with big appetites they loved their meals.

I got a water, strawberry Oreo shake, and chicken fingers with the half fries half onion rings basket.

As the onion rings and fries were more to have a complete meal, we all actually shared just one basket.

The burgers were priced right for their size and the amount of toppings.

One of the boys was unable to finish his double western cheese burger and the other devoured their burger with jalapeños.

My chicken fingers were okay. 

I didn't like the flavor of the breading, it was a bit salty in an off putting way.

Everything was served hot and our waiter was very attentive with refills and bringing out our food together.

The place was pretty vacant which sucked but probably was probably the reason behind the great service.

FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:

- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.

- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.

- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.

SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.

ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.

RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.",2WNF5PiFkBmMlKFcxiijZA,29,28,2,cgECTNz5wWv-IjaAQC9gyA

Went there after doing some miniature golfing and got seated, and the waitress promptly took our drink/shake orders. She came back awhile later and asked us what we wanted to eat, all the while asking us again what our shake/drink orders were.

She then brought out our shake orders one every 5 minutes but not in any rhyme or reason. She took to sniffing every milk shake to see which one was which and still giving us the wrong ones. (which was a little scary cause we had someone allergic to bananas and one of the friends had ordered a chocolate banana shake). 

One of the glasses had food on the inside of it so we asked to have it remade, but pretty sure they just dumped the shake in a to go cup and added new whip cream on top. 

Then came the orders.....fries came out before actual entrees, people were getting the wrong burgers. Some didn't even get their burgers and we waited an hour. (there were only two other tables taken so there was hardly anyone there). They brought my order out and it had onions on it (which I said I can't have) and I sent it back. They brought it back out and it was the exact same burger! All they did was take the onions off! Seriously? You can't do a remake and make things right? 

By that point we had had enough as we had sent back three burgers cause they were wrong and two people still hadn't gotten their food. 

On top of that they were just a dumb staff and didn't know what they were doing. I wish that things could have gone better or that I could have liked their food but after all of this I really doubt that I will even give johnny rockets a second glance.",0b8Ucay5eMs3RsDrJAJQ9A,1,1,1,K-kqIdngZ1rdSzxG9xsYfw
