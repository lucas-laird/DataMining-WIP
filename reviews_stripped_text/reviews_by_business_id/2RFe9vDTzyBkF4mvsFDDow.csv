27174,2015-01-07,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,GREAT BBQ!!!  Great smoke!!  Portions are fair for the price.  Visited many times.  Will continue to be a regular customer.  The review of their take out was shortly after they opened..  Give them a chance.  They have continued to improve as their staff has become more experienced.  Have been to numerous BBQ restaurants in the valley.. This Dickeys is right there with the best!!  Yummy!!!,xHZwJaJZgONLD65g7zDPMg,1,0,5,NsdCfhSkxuUhyf2Rjb-y0Q

470591,2017-01-02,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"I placed an order with GrubHub for this establishment and I am in shock at how the food was delivered to me. 
First, I ordered a kids meal which came with a lemonade. The GrubHub driver showed up with no children's drink and his excuse was ""its not shown on his menu so I would have to take it up with Dickeys."" Now, the children's menu came with chips and the damn bag of lays chips was stuffed INSIDE of the carton with the ribs!  Also, EACH food container was COVERED in BBQ sauce. Please keep this in mind as I continue this review. 
I called Dickeys and advised about the missing drink and was advised that they weren't going to deliver it but that I could come to the restaurant to retrieve it. Well, I just paid for delivery so....not happening. THEN I mentioned the chip bag being inside of the rib container and all of the boxes being saucy and the dickeys rep says ""we don't package it that way so it must have been the GrubHub driver"" so basically dickeys is saying they allow the GrubHub drivers behind the counter to package food? Absolutely ridiculous and Dickeys certainly just lost a customer.

***I ATE AFTER I posted this review and the food wasn't even redeeming. The chopped beef brisket tasted EXACTLY like a slim Jim beef jerky stick and the mac and cheese tasted liked watery KFC Mac and cheese. Lastly, the beans tasted like bush's beans. NEVER EVER AGAIN will I eat from this restaurant. No Dickeys at any location! The $45 I paid for this crap was not worth it. Update, GrubHub was nice enough to provide me a $5 credit and Dickeys so generously refunded me $1 for the missing kids lemonade.

637542,2017-10-28,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"Food is always acceptable for a fast service BBQ.

650048,2014-11-23,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"So I've come here probably 7-8 times since it's opened. The food is actually pretty good. the service is whatever, and the portions well....yeah... I'll get to that..


For the food itself there are no major issues. The food is consistency tasty, the sauce is a pretty good addition, and the sides (I usually do fries or onion tanglers) are a delicious addition to the menu.  I have no qualms with the quality of the food.

The service is probably on par with fast food. You know there's orders from on top to greet everyone, etc, have dedicated signs of where to go, but this location just doesn't really welcome it well by physical design. You come in to a wall which obfuscates vision, and puts a lot of standing room, that doesn't really facilitate customer service. All of the places previously here (Shanes, Hog's Heaven, etc) All had cash registers right as you walked in, and it was a better service model. The building is planned for the other door (That leads to a patio that nobody EVER uses), that can only be reached to on foot, and it just doesn't facilitate anything well. The best bet would be to try and expand the store since it the building very narrow and hard to move around in. 

My last issue with this restaurant is the portions. They are so inconsistent I never know what to order.  I tend to get the 3 meat platter since I am a 1 meal a day person, and yet sometimes I've ordered the smaller meat plates and gotten the same amount of food. I've ordered 3 times this last week alone and one day I've gotten a plastic container full of fries and a few small slices of chicken, I've gotten a plastic container full of chicken and just a paper container of like 10 fries, and one of the 1 meat plates that got me somewhere in the middle.

I feel like I should just order the smaller portion and hope that fate decides to give me enough that I would consider enough food, but I tend to order the 3 meat given the difference is only about $1.50. I wish they could standardize this so I could standardize my order.

My only Nit-picks are I wish this place had different deals. You can get free Ice Cream, and kids can eat free on Sunday for Dine-In. You can also get a free drink for signing up for their email club. I honestly wish there were deals to lower the cost of the food, as my order for 1 can be $10-14 (Again depending on the portion size gamble), as I can get 2 orders of Canes for that price. 

Dickey's being a chain that has some grounding here in Vegas probably fares better than the two places picking it as their first location, but there are some issues that it needs to address before it can cement itself into the landscape of the area. It's the 3rd or 4th restaurant that has gone in to that location, and it'd be a shame to see a 5th there someday. 

EDIT: I've gone a few more times, and figured out a better way to order my meal (I found there's an option to order by the half-pound which is WAY more consistent if you're getting the same meat. The staff has been super friendly as well, and I feel they've ironed out a few of the kinks.",gUJE1jwzhCuYIYjyXHdqoQ,0,0,4,hbojK2F2mMsP9-bv7mYGyw
672208,2016-08-10,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"Let's start out with the good. The food? Not bad at all. The mac and cheese kind of reminded me of kraft, but the meats were nice and juicy, tender, slathered in decent sauce, and the coleslaw was okay. Although I didn't have one, it's pretty cool they had free soft serve ice cream cones!

That being said, the service was terrible. We were not get greeted nor acknowledged. When we approached the person working, they mumbled instructions on how to order, and continued to mumble in response to any question about the menu. It was almost like the workers were mad about something, judging by their facial expressions and attitude. I don't believe we were rude in any way, so I call the salty service uncalled for.

As far as price, quality, service and quantity goes, there are much better options not far away. Not to name names, but I'm particularly thinking of a place that rhymes will Null's Neats.",4sNBhoQ-4daVLdeLC3-t2g,0,0,3,vm_GusBGIx6svTFpyIC7kA

998832,2017-05-24,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"Went to Dickeys a couple of days ago, never been before. I did make a mistake though, I didn't check Yelp before, won't make that mistake again. To sum it up, WON'T RETURN EVER. It isn't the worst BBQ I've ever had, but it ranks at the bottom. As I have said before I am Texan and know BBQ, this is NOT it. The brisket had NO bark, no smoke ring and was burnt on the edges to the extent of being chewy.  I think they kept it in water or something because it was juicy, too juicy to be just cooked. As for the ribs, again no bark, and very little flavor. They must just put them in the cooker, not sure if it is a smoker, no smoke taste, with no rub, no salt, no nothing. The ""sausage"" was flavorless, and bland. I added some of their original BBQ sauce expecting a little zing, got tomato and more bland. Their ""sweet"" sauce tasted burnt and had a strange and unpleasant aftertaste. As for the sides, bbq beans, cole slaw and potato salad. Beans were ok, no significant flavors. Cole slaw bland, no flavor, tasted like cabbage with mayo. Same with potato salad, potatoes with mayo. Even the sweet tea was bland. I will continue my pursuit of bbq in Vegas having marked Dickeys off the list. Rolling Smoke and Famous Daves are still favorites.",GTxWR6Rc620CskoedmwukA,0,0,1,pQCBOsmaLuc8ye7RZr_2Eg

This place. Upon entry. Nothing. Upon ordering from the man at the counter he reaches inside what I guess is the warmer and literally throws the chicken way over on a counter. 
The taller white guy with dark hair was somewhat friendly. The one who cashed us out. 
No sweet tea and didn't want to ask since the guys behind the counter were cursing about tips and it made me feel uncomfortable. The African American guy who was at the entry went and leaned up against the drink counter while drinking something then goes behind the food area and proceeds to pick his nose with a brown paper towel.

They offer free ice cream, so while I waited for my food, I thought I'd have a cone.  Well, they were out of cones!  I'm a problem solver, so I put some in a water cup and grabbed a spoon.  It was average at best!  The ice cream is gritty with very little flavor.  I know, how is that possible, but they somehow did it!
Onto my meal!  It smelled so good!  I had grabbed some of their original and spicy BBQ sauce.  When I opened my brisket, I realized that I usually like getting the chopped brisket, but was so glad I didn't this time.  At least a third to a half of my portion was fat!  It was disgusting!!  What a waste!!  I had 4 half inch thick slabs of brisket.  Usually it comes thinly sliced.  I was really disappointed and this meal wasn't cheap!  It seems they've also changed their beans since I was last their.  Usually theirs little bits of meat in it, but nope, just plain beans.  The flavor was still good, but I like the texture and bit of extra meat I usually get.  The waffle fries were really good and crisp.

The spicy sausage was also good, lots of flavor and great texture! Onto the brisket, as our first time here it was a given for me to try the brisket, it was everything a good brisket should be except it was chopped/shredded and I could tell it had a nice smoke ring, tender, and flavor was there. When we sat down and were eating we overheard the servers give another customer the option to have their brisket chopped or sliced.  We were surprised as we told them it was our first time there and we were not given any option. I would have preferred sliced as that is what I prefer personally,  I would have appreciated the option as I didn't know there was one. So for your info if you dont get an option for the brisket you can just ask for your preferred cut. The mac n cheese was good, mac and cheesy goodness. The baked beans was also good but I had 75% liquid and 25% beans. I would have liked more beans. The dinner roll/biscuit on the other hand is just down right awesome. I would come here again just for that and the ice cream lol!

He handed me a box of sliced brisket instead. When I got home, I noticed the beef and cheese baker I ordered didn't have ANY beef (chopped brisket) and didn't have BBQ sauce or ranch dressing like I ordered and it was very bland.

We ordered meals for each person and tried out the ribs, sliced beef and pulled pork.  We were impressed that the meat was cooked just right and very tender.  The flavor was good and the bbq sauce was tasty and had a little bit of a kick. The macaroni and cheese was tasty, the waffle fries were good (but needed more salt) and the fried okra was tasty but a few were undercooked.  Overall, we were very happy and will return again!

My only complaint had been the fact that they are stingy with their bbq sauce. After all, who wants to spend $65 on bbq and have to go to the store and buy bbq sauce to eat with your leftovers????
We always order the 6 pack and an extra side of kielbasa to feed the whole family for a couple of days. Today after we placed our order, (including our request for EXTRA BBQ Sauce) they called because they ""were out of brisket."" Even though we were all disappointed, the brisket is EVERYONES favorite meat, we decided to go ahead with our order and substitute chicken instead. This wound up being a huge mistake on my part, because the chicken is fatty, and rubbery, and just not very good. Had I known I would have cancelled our order, or doubled up on something else that I know we like. Again we purchased over $65 worth of food and received 1 container of bbq sauce. A little larger container than last time, but not by much. I'm not sure we'll order food from here again or look for another place to get our BBQ that is more consistent with their quality and quantity.

2097689,2016-11-20,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"The food here was okay but the reason I'm giving this place a 1-star is because of the service. They were dishonest and charged us something they said was included. Check your receipt and the menu carefully unless you have money to spare. 

My husband and I went in and asked how it worked because it was our first time eating there. The manager started guiding us in the ordering process, he said if you get a plate then it comes with two sides if you get a sandwich then it does not. He told us about how much meat comes in each meat plate. When I looked at the menu it didn't say the plates came with sides so I asked him again to clarify, so if we get the plate it comes with two sides but if we get the sandwich it does not. He said yes that's right. So we proceeded to order a plate and two sides and went to pay. We had originally gone there because we have a coupon from the entertainment book but when we went to pay we couldn't use it because it was one entree, okay that's fair we said we'll just come back. The bill then came out to higher than what I was expecting and when I went to check the receipt my suspicions were confirmed, the two sides had not been included they were extra. So now I hadn't ordered my sandwich (which also would have allowed us to use the coupon), and we paid for two sides we probably wouldn't have gotten had they not been ""included."" Of course my husband went and talked to the manager about it and he tried saying he hadn't said that they were included. My husband is more of a pacifist so he let it got. I went back up at the end of our meal not wanting to spoil it and clarified with the manager that he should have been upfront and honest with us. That he lost two customers. He offered to give back the money, I told him no that it's fine but that we wouldn't be going back. We weren't complaining to get a free meal but fair is only fair.

The food here is pretty consistent and rarely too dry. I usually go with sliced brisket or ribs with creamed spinach, mac & cheese, and/or Caesar salad as my sides. My only gripe is that for the price, the amount of food you get is a little on the smaller side. But they have daily specials (except Saturdays or Sundays I think) posted which come with drinks, making it a little cheaper if you order those.

If you sign up for their e-club, they send out occasional coupons and offers but it's pretty scarce. If you regularly get fountain drinks here, be sure to save your plastic yellow cup because you get discounted refills on future visits instead of having to buy a whole new cup",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,3,RomiSLW6xcX7RBJGy1-Njw

3249875,2015-01-21,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"Well, I was excited to see another BBQ joint move in to the old spot occupied by Hog Heaven and I was confident that Dickey's being a chain would ensure a consistent dining experience.  Sadly, my first time eating here proved mediocre at best.  I ordered the 3 meat combo and chose ribs, chicken and a Polish sausage.  For sides I chose potato salad and BBQ beans.  As it happens, the sides were the best part of the meal - the beans were hot but really just a sugary, run-of-the-mill version of what could be bought in a can; the potato salad was chilled and had a pronounced but tasty dill flavor.  The meats, however, all came out lukewarm and virtually flavorless.  The lone exception was the Polish sausage which tasted peppery but was mushy and gray, not juicy at all.  No one told me there was BBQ sauce available, but after sampling the food I got up and started looking... I found 3 containers of different sauces and that made the meat more palatable.  Still, it's disappointing that the meat had no real inherent flavor of its own.  To round out the meal, a dinner roll was included, but it looked and tasted exactly like raw dough.  Even butter wouldn't have helped make that thing tasty, but not to worry - none was included.  Best part of this meal was the price... Only $12.50 for the combo, which is a bargain.  Unfortunately what I got for the price was less than satisfactory.",KKZjXdm4tYtqTXHfI5PQuA,0,0,2,NV6a15D35oZUbub6P454NQ
3254850,2016-12-22,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,Bullcrap service.  Looking at the menu for like five minutes or so tell the guy it's going to be a while. When I start the order he literally walks away in the middle of my order and the other guy comes up and asked me what I'm ordering.  First time at a dickies so not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but I don't really want to have to repeat my order.  Then I get down to pay and the second guy is ringing me up repeating back my order but he forgets half the things that I have to clarify for a third time if I got the sides that I requested.  And he asked if I want to drink which I had already told him I wanted to order a drink. Then he asked if I want two drinks so I have to clarify that I only want one drink per my request for a drink.  Feels like the worst $35 I spent at a restaurant.  Food taste good but the poor customer service leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  In their defense what do they care if somebody has to repeat themselves they get paid by the hour and probably barely making minimum-wage so maybe I'm the problem here.,9V94WpOXRd1rhUSnmn75sw,0,0,2,DC59VA1oQ_kRkF_aViXXqw

We called in a to-go order tonight and the girl who answered seemed like I was inconveniencing her and sighed the whole time we were on the phone. When I finished our order and asked what time it would be ready, she said ""We can have it ready whenever you want so when can you get here?"" I live maybe 3.5 minutes away and I didn't think they would have it ready by then and she finally said 20 minutes. We got there and I have to say, the guy who was actually preparing the orders greeted us and was ready to take our order but I told him we were picking up an order and he said ""Oh yeah, for Jessica?"" He finished packing it and we walked up to the counter and were greeted by the same phone girl who said ""Yes?"" as we approached her. I would have started with a ""How can I help you?"" or something similar. The food wasn't bad at all but I just felt like every interaction I had with this girl was an inconvenience to her. There was a mix-up with our meats. Unfortunately I didn't notice this until we got home and we just shared and remedied it ourselves. 
I can only speak for the food I ate, which was the chopped brisket, polish sausage, Mac and cheese, and the blondie. It was all really good. Another gripe is that I got a slice of pie for my Mom and instead of putting it into some sort of container they just wrapped it in Saran Wrap and stuck it in the bag. 
I'll have to give them a second chance because the food was awesome, but I was definitely disappointed in my experience with the service today.",vbG9-F7u-WUbY9lfvadIJw,1,0,3,rMDhcRcHka_3IwZ8bh756w

Ordered the Smokehouse Salad, which only *looks* good in person. It was served to me on a baking pan along with a small, stale bread roll. The salad had an incredibly rich and heavy flavor. Romaine lettuce -- much of which was wilted -- was topped with chopped brisket, which reminded me of overcooked corned beef. There were layers of ranch dressing, shredded cheese, and fried onion tangles to top it off. I couldn't bear to finish the whole thing.

My boyfriend ordered the two-meat combo that comes with two sides and no beverage. I feel like this shouldn't be called a combo if a beverage isn't included, but what the hell do I know? He selected the pulled pork, chicken, beans, and caesar salad. I tried the pork, which was bland; the sliced chicken was also flavorless. Dip these into some BBQ sauce and it's all too sweet. A bread roll also came with the order, and that was stale as well.

3654345,2017-06-20,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"I very rarely give one star reviews.  There is usually always one thing about a restaurant that is redeeming, but for this particular restaurant, on this particular visit, I could not find one.  To be fair, I did visit one hour before closing, which gives some reason for the behavior that I witnessed, but certainly does not excuse it.
I ordered the two meat combo, brisket, pulled pork with bbq beans and fired okra sides.  The first issue I had with the meat was the temperature.  Both items were room temperature at best.  They had both been over cooked, or at a minimum kept in a hot box way too long.  They had lost texture and were short on flavor.  The beans and okra were also disappointing.  The beans were a failed attempt of spicing up canned pork-n-beans.  The okra was frozen and the only flavor was of used fryer grease.  The roll that was served with the meal was quite a surprise.  It actually tasted like the plastic bag it was stored in.  This was a very disappointing meal from start to finish.
The real kicker of this experience was the staff.  There were three employees present when I visited.  A young man and woman working the front kitchen area and a slightly older male working in the back.  The older of the three seemed to be serving in some type of ""lead"" position based on him commanding the other two to complete various chores.  As the trio were cleaning up the restaurant, the ""lead"" person in the back could be heard cursing out into the dinning room and making disparaging comments about the restaurant.  He was telling the other two to ""turn the f-ing open sign off,"" we are ""closing this bitch down early."" ""Who wants to take some of this f-ing food home?""  One of the employees came over to our table several different times to inquire if we would be getting any soda, tea, ice cream, additional sauce, as he was wanting to turn off and clean these machines.
I understand the dynamic of young kids working shitty jobs, most of us have been there, but this was unacceptable.  Say, do and act how you want, AFTER all the customers have left.",qJXoA6sxmiJ357nLeAIlGQ,0,0,1,DjBeE-iZURb-_QKAlsrbRA

If you're not getting enough traffic into your dining room that is probably the reason why --the food is very good and people don't mind paying a bit more as long as they are getting good value,

Let's start by saying that we moved here from the south where barbecue reins supreme. We lived here for a good 4 years and couldn't find a decent rib to save our lives - so we relied on Famous Dave's to get us through the cravings. Fast forward to the glorious day we found Dickey's. 

Dickey's was spotted from across the shopping plaza, tucked away a corner like someone's dirty little secret. We gave it the ol' 'why the hell not?' and strolled up to the counter. The menu is INTENSE with so many options. I shot straight to the rib plate, because ribs are where it's at in my book. My husband got the brisket sandwich. 

The tray - yes, TRAY of food I received was overflowing with yum. The ribs fell off of the bone and were delectible down to the very last finger-lick. The fried okra....HELLLLOOOOOO yum. Thank you so much for doing this right! Perfectly seasoned, lightly breaded, crisp and not too slimy. Eff yes. The yeast rolls were tough (on multiple visits) and something I'd gladly give up for an additional side. My husband enjoys the beans, too - says they're just like home. 

The yellow reusable cups are awesome because they help to reduce waste, and my husband loves to use them for water cups here at home. The beverages are self-serve so there are endless refills. What we love to do is use the cup at the end of the meal to get our free soft-serce icecream, and then fill the cup with root beer for a delicious root beer float for the road :)

The crew at Dickey's is topnotch. These guys know exactly what they're doing, and their customer service is outstanding. I love that they interact like best friends while providing an awesome experience for the customer.

4451869,2015-03-05,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"Husband and I tried this place out a few nights ago as he overheard some co-workers talking about it. Being that it is on the North side of town, must be they get a lot of service members as the cashier asked my husband if he were military with no hesitation. We received a discount which is always nice.

Moving on, it is a quick-serve BBQ joint, which I wasn't aware of until we got there. You order what you want, move down the line, pick your sides and meats, and then get rung up for the meal. Three types of sauces and drink machines are centrally located.

I chose to get the two-meat platter. The brisket was kind of dry and did not have a really good smokey flavor I would expect. Most of it tasted more like a roast, which I don't want when I ask for brisket. If I want a roast, I can slow cook one myself. I can't make myself a brisket as I don't have a smoker - so this was a bit of a disappointment.

I also had the spicy sausage with cheddar, and my husband had the regular sausage - these were so, so good. I would go back for the sausage. My husband also got the pulled pork, which he said was good, but I did not have any.

As for sides - we got four in total: mac-n-cheese: hard to mess up, this one was fine. Baked potato casserole - basically mashed taters with cheese melted on top and chives, I liked it as it was very smooth, but with good flavor. Also had the BBQ beans - OK, nothing special, and the coleslaw - dry, it needed more liquid ingredient.

Overall for BBQ the price isn't too bad, but you aren't getting the very best quality BBQ. You can definitely find better BBQ elsewhere in the Valley, but if you want something quick and you don't want it from a sit-down restaurant this isn't a bad option.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,5,1,3,Df7M7cC9YEapxXX21okanw

4764566,2015-11-30,1,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"First time at this place wasn't a bad experience. I love the fact that I got to taste samples before I ordered. That's always a sign that a restaurant has nothing to hide.

We ordered take out and it took a few minutes for us to make up our minds on what to order. The server didn't rush us and he answered all of our questions. He was a pretty cool kid.

We ordered just a 2-meat plate. It came with two sides (we got Mac and cheese and bbq beans), a roll, pickles and a piece of onion. We got it all for $12.50. Not a bad price if the full meal is as good as the samples were (I'm currently writing this while taking the food out of the bag, so I haven't tried everything yet).

Oh and let me mention, we made free soft serve vanilla ice cream cones as we left. It's cold as heck outside, but I can't say no to free ice cream. They were pretty good by the way.

So, I'm eating now. I really like EVERYTHING, for the most part. The bbq beans are spicy and I like that. They are better than a lot of bbq places I've had recently. They are not all sauce, I actually have beans. Even with driving 12 minutes to get home, the beans are still really hot.

The Mac and cheese is really ""wet"" or ""runny"", but it's still okay. They added to much water for sure. It doesn't really have a taste. It's just plain ol Mac and cheese. Maybe if I had added salt and pepper, it would have enhanced the taste (I wouldn't know because I didn't add any and now it's gone). Nothing was going to help how loose it was though, except maybe the roll that came included. Maybe I could've soaked up some of the moisture. Too bad, I ate the roll first (It was good too lol).

The pulled pork was extremely good to me. I think it's the best I've had in a long time. It was one of the things I got to sample back at the restaurant. The pork reminded me of Jack's BBQ, back home in Nashville. I think I found a favorite place for pulled pork.

The polish sausage I ordered, as a second meat, was just as good. The server also recommended I taste it too, so I did. I'm glad he let me because I was actually about to order brisket. I'm not sure if I would have loved the brisket like I love the sausage. It's really good.

The BBQ sauce was good too. I enjoyed the flavor. It's kind of tangy and spicy. I would order some and just keep it around the house, if I could. I wonder if I can?

In all, I really like this place. I feel like, if they improve the Mac and cheese (which is already better than a lot of place) they could win an award for the best bbq, if they haven't already. I would definitely go back. I would have to get my owe plate though, because the plates are kind of small, they are not meant to be shared.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,2,1,4,dlyB7MQ6_Ty14oCFymr0DQ

4872917,2017-08-28,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"Here we are again trying to find something we haven't tried before and surely we found it at Dickies Barbeque Pit. 

We were in search of something different that set itself apart from most usual of flavors and styles out hear in Las Vegas. We saw a Geisha House which we already reviewed and then we saw something that cought our eye sitting in a lonely corner of the shopping center as we've never heard of Dickies Barbeque Pit before.

BBQ pit? Never been to anything like that. So Toni and I strolled in looking for something to fill us up and keep us coming back for seconds. We walked in greeted by two gentlemen working on meats behind the counter. We quickly scanned the menu for anything that would catch our attention and quickly found it.

From pulled pork sandwiches to ribs and brisket Toni and I began to order. She ordered 3 pulled pork sliders with BBQ beans and a large fountain drink. I decided to go the route of Ribs, Brisket and a side of potatoes salad with bread rolls that matched Toni's sandwich buns. 

Once we received our food we quickly turned around and grabbed our drinks. To my surprise, the ice machine dishes out small marble size ice which was a plus to me as I love chewing ice and it's more efficient at cooling drinks in this shape. On the other side of the fountain drink table, we saw the ice tea for those who choose a sugarless drink and a free ice cream cone dispenser for everyone to get a free dessert after, during or before your meal. 

The items that I recommend at the table were all the fountain drinks are seem to me are quired for your meal. The sauces change the entire plate in one little dab or dip. From sweet, regular or hot, they all cover an individuals favorite taste. I'm surprised that they don't come included but understand that the meat stands on its own merits. These sauses only complimented our meal and completely turned every bite into a new flavor. 

The ribs simply fell off the bone, the brisket had an almost sweet taste from the dry rub burned into the outer edges. The buns were fresh and soft and the potatoe salad topped me off to full. Toni enjoyed two of her 3 pulled pork sandwiches and allowed me to enjoy her last trying to dissect every bite and tie it to every sauce and the person who would typically enjoy them. 

The location, although in a corner, had a very lovely outdoor eating area for when the sun isn't out on a murderous rampage and the inside was clean and organized from what I saw along with the restrooms. All in all, it was a great BBQ experience and we could tell people enjoyed the atmosphere as even employees from the next door Geisha House came in to break away for something delicious and different.

Kids chicken nuggets are actually the store bought Dino Nuggets you can pick up at any local grocery store. Their waffle fries also  tasted like they came from the frozen food isle. If we knew this ahead of time we would have just stayed home. 

My husband and I shared the 3 meat platter and we were completely underwhelmed. We aren't snobs and we don't like to waste, so we ate as much as we could stomach and decided to test out everything so we can warn others. 

Their beef brisket was mainly fat and extremely chewy. 

Their chicken was subpar at best and lacked flavor. 

Their pulled pork was dry and needed to be drenched in sauce. 

Both meals came with a hard ciabatta roll. 

The coleslaw was soupy and the cabbage was not fresh. 

We also had the side of potato salad. It was ok. I usually down potato salad even if it's store bought and I just couldn't stomach this one. 

My kids got a free soft serve cone which was awful. Have you ever known a 3 and 5 year old to throw out ice cream!?!? 

We also noticed they made their lemonade from store bought jugs I saw once at WinCo but didn't get because of the insane amount of sugar and the lack of actual lemon juice. 

I gave two stars to the two employees who were at least friendly but obviously lacking in customer service etiquette, as one of the employees told another customer that they didn't have any ribs because they didn't make any today because someone forgot to clean the pit....  he gave her $5 off but it was just so unprofessional and didn't make us feel comfortable.",WaFj2O4V-pPICYLIjrUzpA,0,0,2,gVVczi9NUyL0qA5oT7DP0w

Brisket-- Insanely bad. This tasted exactly like a roast. There was so much fat on it. If you want bbq roast, then go for this.
Mac & Cheese-- Definitely nothing special

I had the 3 meat plate. I had Ribs, Brisket and Pulled Pork with green beans and bacon and mac and cheese. My plate also came with a roll, pickle slices and onion slices. The mac and cheese was good but not the best I have had. It tasted like it needed more love. It kind of tasted bland. Did not taste like those who put 3 or 4 different cheeses into their recipe. The green beans were good but I think they had like 2 pieces of bacon in the entire bowl. Green beans with bacon should have a little more bacon in it. The rolls do not look like they are fresh baked. Looks like they are just some store bought rolls. Would have been better if the roll was warmed up a little. 

Onto the meats. The meats had some excellent flavor and were very tender. The brisket pulled right apart like it should and was not a bit rubbery. Didn't have much of a smoke ring for smoking over night for 13-14 hours but was very good. 

The ribs were awesome. Meat pulled right off the bone. Had an excellent Texas BBQ flavor to it. They were nice and sweet tasting. You could definitely tell the smoke penetrated the meat on the ribs. They had a great smoke ring and color to them. I think they go best with the sweet BBQ sauce over the regular BBQ sauce.

Like the ribs, the pulled pork had a better smoke coloring to it than the brisket. Pulled pork was done just right. It also goes better with the sweet BBQ over regular BBQ sauce.

My chart placement of the meats would go like this: Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket

The customer service was good. Didn't seem to lively though for being such a new place. The guy that served up my dish answered my questions with no hesitation. I did not catch his name. The guy that rang me up was John and the guy that was working with him serving up the dishes was an Asian guy.(Sorry that's all I can describe lol) 


This place has only been open for 5 months and has the potential to be a really really good place. They just need to work on their sides a little bit. At least the Mac and Cheese and the Green Beans with Bacon. I also think the portion size could have been a tad bit bigger for the price. I was partially full when I was done but the food settled quickly. When it comes to BBQ, I want to practically be in a food coma with left overs for the next day.

Its awkward, but kind of fun. At the end you'll pay and get to eat some average bbq.",929r8bJ3dzW_d3jpwUxYVw,0,0,3,tXPR1Kwd8jlQdxQlmpaGhw

When I got home and opened up the sandwich all that was in there were two small dried pieces of meat and one small piece of cheese.

We got ribs, brisket, sausage sandwich, with plenty of sides. It was all dull, dry, and finger-licking good. Save your money and your taste buds and go elsewhere.

Went there tonight for dinner. Food was quick and yummy. Less than $30 for two people after military discount. 
Ribs-lil dry on the outside but inside was great
Love the warm bbq sauce and free ice cream
Waffle fries - perfect
Mac & chz- liked it. Reminds me of Stouffers
Sweet tea-awesome.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,1,0,4,w-hq9qZwnIY3q4ZGerx3AA

The ribs were too salty and are already coated in sauce you can not get them dry.  For sides I had the baked beans which were mushy and bland, and the green beans that tasted as if they were canned and from days ago.  A huge disappointment.",1aFD1LsjC2JbZ0KS-AQf1g,0,0,1,uRfJ9-jeyJAFp-BgDbFSVw
5818984,2014-11-06,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"We were so excited when this finally opened as we go to Geisha House (next door) quite frequently.  Live very close  and are always looking for food options.  Well....the excitement was deflated the moment we stepped in this location.  We ordered a 65.00 order for take out. We had family in town from Ohio and was hoping this was the best option for all of us.   I did this online at 3 pm.  Requested pick up to be 6pm.  We arrived at 5:50 pm.  Stood at the register for literally 5 minutes before we were even greeted.  Not a ""hello, welcome""?  The Manager saw us and seemed surprised that we had not been greeted.  There was a young gentleman working that was very apologetic and qutie pleasant.  Wish I could say the same for the Manager.  Told him we were there to pick up our order.  After leaving for several minutes, he returned to say they were out of chicken which I ordered.  Out of chicken?  Well...come to find out, he informed us that a large party came in earlier and whiped him out.   Wow.  So, we said to him, basically you gave away our order?  He offered another meat choice.  But of course, that would be expected.  Seeing as we had no choice, we opted for the turkey (which was underwhelming at the least).  He also ""threw"" in another meat choice.  I would have much rather had the chicken we ordered 3  hours previous, but that is what he offered.  Actually, would have much rather received a discount off of our meal or at the very least a gift certificate to try to get us to return.  Well, that will not be happening, sorry to say.   I am in customer service and have been for many years, and this experience has to rate up there with the worst.  Can you imagine going to pick up your pizza and they say ""sorry, we gave your pizza to someone else, but we have this for you!""  Have to say this is the first time we have ever experienced this in our lives.  Just had to laugh at this point.  Food was ok.  Not great, not terrible.  Hope they get it together or they will fail miserably.",tJe5EzGkPvfCNDFK5xerOg,0,0,1,SBi17bYyRNpKKiyyrcZSwg
5823465,2016-03-21,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,I took home the prize! A whole brisket with all the trimmings and full rack of BBQ ribs... Can you imagine my dilemma!? The brisket is really good. The chef cut them thick like my wife's legs.. and they are just as juicy. The ribs are moist and flavorful. I should have asked for more BBQ sauce.. sweet and tangy.  I am having eggs with the trimmings for breakfast and tortillas.. Life is good when you have a good BBQ joint close by.,C-UdxCmXMCRajhqHhffkPQ,0,1,5,SyYsf3BqCujxAWHE1CkVmw
5864042,2016-08-27,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"I got a salad with brisket and my boyfriend got a sandwich with Mac and cheese and bean. My salad was not good at all. The brisket was in a dry clump in the top of the salad. I tried taking some off and adding some ranch and bbq and it was still disgusting. $9 for the salad and it ended up in the trash. My boyfriend paid $14 for his with a small drink and he said it tasted like fast food.

Also the main guy who took our order wasn't friendly at all. He wouldn't even look at us as he was taking our order and was really rude to the two younger guys, probably in their twenties. The younger gentlemen was nice and friendly as he rung us up.

5945119,2016-06-29,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"Never knew this place existed, but glad I found it. We got the Tuesday special which was three ribs, 2 sides and a drink.  For $10, it was a great deal.  The ribs were really, really good and dumping a little of the bbq sauce over them made them that much better.  I got the green beans and bacon as well as the cole slaw as sides.  Again, both were great, which is important to me because sides at a bbq place should be almost as good as the ribs.

The further I got into the meal, the happier I was.  My only complaint is that there are no locations too close to us in Summerlin.

Staff was super friendly and offered recommendations on the sides.  A great meal was topped of with a free ice cream cone and I am already ready to go back for more.",ilq8Zjr_YLbyL-AhMRReZQ,0,0,5,4KrZLaWLWcawknDFwzYA0Q
5948329,2017-07-04,0,2RFe9vDTzyBkF4mvsFDDow,"I started visiting Dickey's because a coworker would bring in his dinner from there every Saturday night, and it always looked/smelled AMAZING.  I've patronized both the S Rainbow location, as well as this one.  The first 3 (2 to Rainbow, 1 to Decatur) visits were good........

I was given a gift card for Father's Day.  I attempted to use the card 2 weeks ago, and the cashier said ""there's nothing on this card"".  So, I checked online.  Dickey's system was showing the card wasn't active.  So, I asked the gift giver for the receipt.   Yep, showed the card was activated.  So, Target agreed to exchange the card for me.

I went to this location today in an attempt to get carry out.  I had the receipt IN MY HAND showing the card was activated at time of purchase.  Franchise holder happened to be in the store.  He checked the card....not active in their system.  His solution tot he problem?  ""You can get a $50 gift card for us at Lowe's for $40"".  WHAT???????  THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION????

So, I contacted Dickey's Corporate through their website, outlining my experience, including what the Franchise holder suggested as a solution.  About an hour later, my cell phone rings.  Not recognizing the number, I let it go to voicemail.  It was the Franchise holder.  Who stated HE DID NOT offer the Lowe's suggestion as a solution to the problem, it was a suggestion to avoid paying full price for another gift card.

ANY possibility of me visiting this location again went out the window with that phone call.  His first mistake was letting me walk out of the store unhappy (and without placing an order) and the second was LYING about what he suggested.  If he had ANY business sense, he would have let me order my food (which I would have paid for out of pocket) and thrown in a side dish or a drink as a gesture of ""sorry you're having problems"".  You simply don't let the customer walk out the door unhappy.  When they do, they tend to post negative online reviews (you know, kinda like this one).

I contacted Corporate office again....this time via phone, and left a voicemail for the customer service department.  I made it clear I DID NOT want to hear from said franchise holder again, but would gladly speak to someone from Corporate.",myAlEECVOc5vOyFO_EIQKw,0,0,1,XXm3k_ZUu21evCvn11QAIA
