food: BLT sandwich was nicely made, good portion of bacon in the sandwich.  Liquid defense juice tasted good.

I usually have their food truck where there is a limited menu , but I entered a drawing at one of the local LV events and won a $20 gift certificate. My brother was in town, so I decided to take him to this place. We went on a Wed afternoon and it was PACKED! I was surprised at the size of the place. It is really small, but the portions, prices, and service make up for the long wait. I also found out they have online ordering, which is always great. 

The food was fantastic. I had the veggie sandwich, my brother had a typical breakfast, and my sister in law had the burger. Portions were massive, and for 34 bucks(before the gift card) is not bad.

I also love the concept of this place. It has two sides of the menu; a HAPPY and HEALTHY. One side is healthy food, and the other is...not...so healthy.

Ahi Sriracha taco. Get it. Get it now.

124331,2013-11-11,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFats is located in an awkward, small office park on Dean Martin near Sunset with minimal parking and minimal space inside, so if you're planning on a weekday lunch be prepared for a bit of a crowd and nowhere to park. The restaurant is equally small but colorful with just a handful of two- and four-top tables, and maybe ten seats facing a high counter along the window. There are veggies and animals painted all over the walls, with fun metal corrugated ceiling tiles. It's a loud, lively space, and gets a bit hectic when it's crowded. The menu has a healthy and unhealthy side, both filled with quite a number of items for breakfast, lunch or dinner. On the healthy side you will see juices, snacks, gluten-free pizzas and sandwiches. On the unhealthy side, or happy side as they call it, you have choices of shakes, waffles, snacks, sandwiches, and more. There seems to be plenty of options for whatever you're looking for, and I'll certainly have to stop back in to try some more.

So as usual I came for one thing, and in this case it's their Cheeseburger Benedict: 1/2lb angus burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg and SF sauce. What came out looked great, but was kind of like the Rollin' Smoke burger I ate a few weeks ago; too damn large to properly enjoy. There's something to say of the spectacle, but the oversized assembly makes for a slightly inedible burger. The moment I picked it up and gave it a squeeze I could tell the bun might be a bit dry. The patty was sticking out from the edges of the bun so I was able to sample it on its own; it was of good quality and cooked well. The bun was indeed a bit too dry, and on first bite a bit too thick as well, but the burger quickly got messy so I saw the need for something with a bit more substance. The egg had good flavor but got a bit lost in everything, there was tons of cheese that had good flavor, although some of it still wasn't melted by the time it got to my table. The lettuce was prominent and proportionally just enough, and the pickles were also good. I knew the avocado was there because a few slices fell out, but I couldn't taste it within the burger with all those other flavors mixed in. If this burger was simplified and you could properly sample some of the intended flavors it could be really great, but there is just far too much going on to enjoy this. Does any burger really need a fried egg, onion, pickles, avocado AND a sauce? I guess many people would argue that this is what a burger is all about, but for me it's a bit much. Oh and as for that sauce, I don't even know what it tasted like, and for me that's the problem.

The truffle fries on the other hand were really good; almost all of them were cooked well and they were very flavorful. I found myself eating them well after my giant burger was done. Again, I feel like I have to defend myself with my slight disappointment; a massive burger is a great thing, but when you add too many toppings they start to cancel each other out. Maybe the solution is choosing only one or two of their offered toppings, which could provide a slightly simplified and very flavorful burger. For $10.50 with fries this really isn't a bad deal, I just found it to be a few too many items piled together. Still, the menu looks great, and all the food looks to be of very good quality, so I'll surely be back to try other items soon.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,3,1hHffdmPFzrL0M6fR1ydaw
125380,2018-01-02,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"First off the food is great, this was a solid 4 1-2 star experience.  There are a few things that would keep me from giving it a perfect 5.  I'm a local and the location is tucked away on Dean Martin, kind of hard to get to for out of town-ers if you don't know where you're going; thank goodness for GPS.

I would study the menu before coming here, because they have a lot of choices and you might miss out on something good.  I ended up going with a Cherry Popper Hamburger, fries and a drink.  That was $17.00.  Very pricey for a hamburger, fries and a drink but good!! 

This particular location is very small and not good for groups of more than 4.  It's open seating and you will struggle to find seating together, especially if it's busy.  So take that into consideration.

The service was good. You order at the counter, service with a smile, get your drink and wait for your food at your table. That's pretty much it.  No frills (except for the food).  Quality but kind of pricey. 

I would eat here again.  You won't be disappointed.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,1,0,4,44LoabGKWN9KF-RGdGVaDA

252153,2014-08-06,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Food is excellent.  The interior is slick. The help is friendly. But there are some glaring issues that need to be resolved:

1. The success of the business has led to occupancy problems. The place is packed. All the time. Space restrictions force you to plan out your visit there. You'll have to know what you want and bring a friend to scout for a place to sit while you wait in line to order.

2. The staff does not seem to communicate to each other very well and there seems to be little direction. During peak times I cannot figure out what each counter staffs function is other than to do whatever it is they feel like at that particular moment.  The only constant position I can observe is the person who sits at the register and take orders while everyone else chases their own tails. I cannot comment on the kitchen direction though as there is not enough open view behind the overcrowded eating area.

3. Don't bother trying to order over the phone. When they are red lining beyond the usual total chaos they will let the caller go to voicemail. If you do get through, plan on bring pissed off when you go to pick up your order. There is no separate pickup counter or window.  You'll have to sit in the line and wait to pay. I have on 3 separate occasions paid for the pickup and waited over 20 min for someone to bring the order up without apology. This is a direct communication error between front counter and kitchen staff. Particularly because there does not appear to be anyone responsible for ensuring over the phone pickup orders are tended to.

The menu here is a split menu, one side is some what healthy and the other is healthy. They also have vegetarian and vegan options. The menu is also flexible enough to accommodate any diet. I went full on vegan about a year ago and was ecstatic when the girl behind the counter told me that they can modify the majority of the menu to be vegan. Whohoo!

So the first day here, I had:
- mean bean vegan burger with garlic fries (minus the cheese) 
- frickles

429692,2013-12-16,4,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I do not get why any of you think the food is Good here .... OR HEALTHY!!! Where are the Nutritional Facts for any item on these menus? Anyone ever think about that. I was really happy to think there was a Healthy Restaurant here that was hip and fun but what I thought about this place does not represent what any of you went through.  The place is Crowded and smells Funny.  I ordered the Ahi Tacos and you can use some salt, Use sea salt for God's Sake.  It's Healthy and good for you.  Those were the driest nastiest fish tacos I have eaten in my life and I am very well traveled.  If you think no flavor means healthy you would be incorrect.  

My Boyfriend got their french fries so I tried a couple DISGUSTING they are drowned in a low grade Truffle oil and taste HORRIBLE! 

The Sweet Potato fries were just ok.  They do not use any Fruits or Vegetables in Season, so they do not seem to know much about what they are doing.  The food cooked there is MEDIOCRE AT BEST!  Why this place gets crowded is BEYOND BELIEF! 

Tell the cooks to learn how to cook out of passion and not out of routine. And put some nutritional Facts up about your food.  I want to know what I ingest and how much work I need to do later.  

And I got a Milkshake, It was so RUNNY it wasn't a shake at all. It was MILK! Learn how to make a milkshake. If I could give you 0 Stars I would have. 

If you go here thinking this is some good food obviously your Pallet has never been refined to great foods.  This place is gross.",VUblcMTg6ebcVjQTYedBuA,3,1,1,zxe5R335JdPYqvDycBL67g

572915,2016-05-25,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Haven't eaten yet. Ordered online for carryout and four of our five orders and one of our drink orders were wrong. I mean, the recipe is scratched out as if someone went down the list preparing the food and yet my filet burger had a big chunk of chicken on it.  The place is really small, so you'll be waiting for your food anyway. Though I highly suggest not coming in the first place. It's been two hours waiting for five meals, no food could possibly be good enough to make the wait worthwhile. The one order that was correct ( teriyaki bowl) tasted rushed, with dry tough meat, so I'm not expecting much. 

The worst thing is that the people who work here don't really seem to care that our order is completely wrong. 

I wouldn't risk wasting your time with this place, especially if youre just visiting and hoping to use your time wisely. Vegas must have better.

Update: representative of restaurant responded to my review in a caring and considerate manner, showing that the problems I encountered weren't down to a lack of caring, something I have no sympathy for. Still, its hard for me to recommend going here with a large group and little time. 

Oh and service frustrations aside the food was solid. Pita and hummus wasnt good at all, the toast they use is excellent, everything was fresh, the mix of ingredients were above average but nothing spectacular.

The food arrived promptly and exactly as ordered.  I had the Chickhumm with fries and a side salad. The Chickhumm was a large portion, with √ºber-fresh toppings and a super soft bun.  The fries were stiff and seemed saturated with grease - slightly unpleasant but edible.  The salad was ultra-crisp, like freshly ironed sheets! And the fat-free ranch was tangy and thick.

A steady stream of incoming patrons reassured us that we'd made the right choice for dinner.  And at just over $30 for two people, it proved to be a tasty bargain.

If you have ever tried to shake salt out of a cup you know that you only get sporadic clumps so that one bit has to much salt and then your next bit has none. It wasn't even salt for food it was pretzel salt like salt rocks and if you have never used this on your food trust me it ruins any meal. My bread was burned and so hard I could not eat it.

897728,2014-07-24,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Delicious, gorgeous, and oh so satisfying. We had a quick lunch here when in Vegas this summer and ordered The Classic (medium rare and juicy), a side of truffle fries (comes with The Classic), and the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (fried chicken breast strips over buttermilk waffles and syrup). 

Truffle Fries: The fries are regular shoe-string style and fresh, with lightly sprinkled truffle and cheese. It was slightly under seasoned, but the truffle scent and taste really shined. Delicious by its own merit or with a quick visit to the ketchup pond.

The Classic burger: The fresh bun is dwarfed by the amount of veggies, thick tomato slices, and enormous juicy patty; if you're a messy eater, grab a few napkins before you start. It was a perfect combination of healthy veggies and the gluttony of burger meat...

Chick-a-waff-a-dopolis: A few reviews mentioned that this was a ""secret"" menu item, but I saw it on the menu like anything else. Thick cuts of delicious chicken breast dipped and fried in an amazing batter. The chicken was well seasoned and had a kick of flavor. The waffles and syrup was great, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Overall, SkinnyFATS is a great escape from the binge eating habits most tourists experience on the Strip. It doesn't aim to be more than it is -- the perfect place for lunch.

Lack of fresh ingredients

Here are some examples from the food I ate:

Chicken - looked like precooked and sliced packaged chicken slices
Fruit - definitely mass packaged precut fruit
French fries/ sweet potato fries - frozen

951424,2016-09-08,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Ordered the G. O. A. T. salad. When asked how I wanted the filet mignon cooked, I said medium rare. When I got the salad and *tried* to eat it, the steak was literally so overcooked it was like chewing gum. I could barely cut through it, let alone chew it. So I took it back in and asked if they could make it again with the steak even more rare. I got my order again within record time with what I'm pretty sure had to be the same steak I just gave back to them (only less of it, since some I had started to cut up), and probably just as overcooked, or even less rare than last time, and closer to well done (no pink or red area in the middle at all). This is by far not a 4.5-star steak salad by any stretch.

The service and courtesy of the staff were fine, and everything else about the establishment seemed pretty high quality. But I could cook a steak better in my sleep than these guys could. Waste of $12 bucks. I ended up only eating the rest of the salad as I didn't want to bother going back in again to let the cook know he had no idea how to cook a filet mignon.

Bottom line: if you're going to bother asking people how they want their steak cooked, know how to do it right. Otherwise, you're just setting the customer up for disappointment. And this was not only a disappointment, but an embarrassment when I went in to ask for it to be done right, only to get the order again just as bad or worse than it was the first time.

Edit: the manager replied to my review and apologized, and offered me a generous credit for the next time I happen to be in the area. So they get credit for wanting to make things right, and striving to improve in areas where needed. 3 stars for taking the time to provide above-average customer service.",3uvSL06lFl40G2HE07DUAw,1,0,3,CV0IJjWM73ZDzNwUAdMtew

I specifically stated I am ALLERGIC to gluten and made my usual order which they have always been able to substitute for me. The staff was very helpful and seemed to be carefully understanding my requests. The chef on the other hand, not so much. The server brought out our food and announced 'gluten free' when he set it down. The only reason I noticed it wasn't right is when I requested a side of the sauce they don't use on the dish to make it gluten free (my partner does not have a gluten allergy) it was a very different color from what it has been in the past. It didn't register until after I took a bite of the food and tasted so different from how I remembered. I then decided to ask what was going on with this 'gluten free' dish and come to find out they did not use the correct sauce and I was poisoned. Our meal and our time here was ruined. As much as I love this place for trying to offer gluten free options I will not be dining here any longer. The worst part is I was told a manager would be getting in touch with me and no one ever followed up with me.

My husband and I went there for The Green Mile Juice (love, order when we eat there) at 9:00 am. I waited in the car while he ordered my drink.  My husband ordered The Green MILE with NO APPLE because I'm highly allergic to fruit (hospitalized twice). He told the girl taking his order I have a apple allergy.  Since, there is no other fruit listed in the drink, he did not give her a list of all of the fruits I am allergic to. He gave me the drink, but as soon as I took a sip I knew there was fruit in it. He took it back and explained my fruit allergies to the girl taking the order again.  The girl who made my drink came out of the back and took it upon herself state, ""There's no apple in it. I'm a culinary genius, I put in oranges and syrup in it."" Then, I went into the restaurant and explained, again, that I am allergic to fruit. She just gave me a blank stair and said, ""So you want only vegetables?"" I replied, ""That's what I ordered, right?""  Ultimately, the manager refunded our purchase and the drink was made correctly.  Every other time I ordered this drink, it was made without fruit.  Thankfully, I did not have an allergic reaction from taking a sip of the drink. People with food allergies know how serious an issue this could have been.  Employees in the food industry need to pay more attention to these issues and not change menu items on a whim. We enjoy eating here and are happy that steps were made to correct this issue.

I ordered a Chix on Broadway. My friend ordered the Cherry Popper.

He returned with my friend's food and said my food would arrive shortly. Her food was cold, so she sent it back. They immediately gave her another one (we assumed it was made for someone else). It took a total of 25 minutes for her to get her food and her truffle fries contained no truffle flavor. It took a full 32 minutes from time of order to get my meal.

You would have to use your phone to map this place out because it is on Dean Martin Drive in a business building plaza, not your typical location for a restaurant.

There are a lot of menu options, it is hard to pick just one to try for your first time. I ordered the Chix on Broadway, a breaded chicken sandwich with bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and lemon aioli. Your side options include truffle fries, sweet potato fries, or healthier options of fruit, brown rice, and salad. I chose the truffle fries, and they are delicious. I could taste every ingredient in the sandwich, including the lemon aioli that was subtle yet added to the flavor. Chix on Broadway was made well and all the ingredients complemented each other.

For a somewhat fast food restaurant, the wait was 15 minutes for my food to cook. This is only because it's cooked to order from fresh ingredients, making it worth the wait.

 The cran-turkey and side of fruit - served on a yummy grain roll, the patty is speckled with cranberries and also has a cranberry yogurt spread, so fresh and delicious

Tu-nuts- Any sushi place serving a dish piled with THIS much tuna would be $25, and here its just over $6!!! they really pile on the tuna. I normally dont care much for raw seafood but this was amazing, served on a bed of crunchy asian slaw and hollowed out cucumber, personally a better way to eat fish if you're craving sushi, the rice always leaves me with a bellyache. This is perfection.

Hot-mame- sweet and spicy, great sized portion. 

Beet juice, and a tea.. My friend got the beet juice, and said it was amazing. I got the black tea with lemon and sipped on it all day. They're served in awesome reusable branded cups with little smiley faces that fade into sad faces as you drink more of your beverage. both my friend and I thought that was adorable.

As for cost, well, you get what you pay for. The dish I ordered had many ingredients and all were fresh and high quality. They tasted like they were made there and not unloaded off of some truck in a freezer bag. This costs money. And I saw it in the food. I will stop back next time I'm in town.

I order the Chicken sandwich which comes with 2 chicken breasts with the sweet potatoes. I thought that the sandwich was very good. My friend ordered one of the breakfast items and it looked amazing.

I had just flown in to Vegas from back east and was pretty hungry by 10:30am local time. As I pulled up I thought my gps sent me to the wrong place because this joint is located in an industrial neighborhood, but it's right on the street and the location worked. 
There were only a few people there and I was able to order right away. I wanted the ahi tacos and ordered a skinny one and a fat one, along with an order of truffle fries I had seen bragged about on yelp.
The skinny one was a grilled ahi and came on a small wheat tortilla served in a small bowl. You had to eat it with a fork at first because it was so loaded. Don't get me wrong, they weren't big tacos, they were about the size of street tacos, but they were stuffed with ahi and veggies and sirachi. The fat taco was fried ahi with a creamy mango salsa served on a tiny taco bowl like the kind you get with a taco salad. 
They were both very different and VERY GOOD! I'd get one of each again if I went there again. Well done! And the truffle fries? Meh.. They were good but not OMG YOU GOTTA GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES good.
I like this place because it has a little bit of everything: breakfast food, burgers, tacos, salads, sandwiches, all with a skinny and a fatty version. Beware though, by the time I left around 11, the place was full and there were about 10 people in line. Yikes! I'd hate to see noon...",n5ipb2LSxUrICluvSbRq2A,0,0,4,SJd27DSH4b4r_5H7rVvUWw

Had the ChickHumm, grilled chicken breast with hummus, sprouts, tomato, and onion on a whole wheat bun, also added avocado (+$1). It was super tasty.

The eating area is kinda small but comfortable.  Laughed when I hit the restroom and determined the men's room is almost equal in size to the dining area.

The menu is a little confusing but the concept is simply  you got food for health conscious people and food for a fat ass like me.  we ordered:

flat chicken and greens ( $8 ) with a side of fruit ( included in price - not sure why ) 

Chicken and waffles ( $8.50)  - secret, off menu item

Nice to greek you healthy pizza flat bread/pizza ( 9.50 )

Maine Wedge happy salad ( $4.50 ) 

Highlights - well, basically EVERYTHING !  great value, well prepared and creative.  I can't believe i'm going to write this but I think the prices are on the low side for what you get - the wedge salad ( pic incl ) has large chunks of cheese and bacon with the egg and then you smash on one of the lettuce spears - Mmmmmm - good stuff ! and at $4.50 ??? are you kiddin' me !

The flat chicken and greens has a full chicken breast smashed done and grilled, seasoned perfectly with a bed of greens - the gf was happy.

I guess a slight ding is the chicken and waffles - the chicken need a little more seasoning ( salt ) but overall, we were very happy with the combo.

And heck, I even liked the healthy pizza.

total bill with sodas was $50.

I got my food in like less than 10 minutes of ordering. That was a red flag. My fiance got the smotherload and his food came out at the same time. My fries were not hot and they were really stale and cold like they were yesterday's fries. Burger was ok luckily my meat was hot but it was probably thrown in a microwave or something. The potatoes in the smotherload were still hard and not cooked all the way. The food was done half fast. My fiance ended up getting sick right after on the drive home.

The location is a little off, but I like that it is not in the mainstream areas of town and hidden in a little niche in the business park. I would never have expected to eat such good food there, but once you walk in they have done a really good job at creating an awesome atmosphere. You kind of forget that you are in an office park. 

The staff were wonderful! Lana who helped us with some recommendations was fun, friendly, and really helpful! It was kind of neat to talk to someone who was so happy about her job! You don't see that too often now a days! In my opinion, she deserves a raise! ;) 

Lastly, the food was superb! We went for my fathers birthday! Some call us picky eaters; We are not picky at all. We actually love all types of food, but we just really love good food! This place definitely knows how to make it happen! We had a few different plates and they were all magnificent.

My first impression was, ""this is the type of funky little joint you either love or it drives you crazy"". It's located in a business strip on Dean Martin Blvd.; be careful or it's easy to drive right past it.

Inside is quite small and there were 7 of us. We were allowed to move a couple of tables to accommodate our size. You order first and then have a seat. The menu is divided into a healthy side and a happy side, and have funky unique names; we settled on Apple Bottom, Cluck Moo, Berry Strong Pancakes, Chickawaffadopolis, Waken Bacon, and the pineapple pancakes (can't remember name), coffees, and an apple juice. We all enjoyed our meals, except for the Berry Pancakes. The flavor combinations on that were too much, especially the mint yogurt, for it to be good.

Staff/service is awesome, menu is diverse and very neat, overall concept is very cool, and of course the food is great!

My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick place to eat that wouldn't be out of our way as we were leaving Vegas. We happened to find this place without any idea of what to expect other than the fact that it seemed to have some breakfast/lunch options. I am so happy we dropped by. 

I love the whole concept and theme that skinnyFATS has going on. The way the menu is spread out is really cool - you have a ""healthy"" side and a ""happy"" side. The healthy side includes calorie information with lower calorie options and the happy side includes items that you'll want to indulge in. If you look at the two items side by side, they are very similar options (i.e. a low cal breakfast burrito vs a more caloric breakfast burrito). I got the wrap supastar and it was really good. My boyfriend had the steak eyes. Let me tell you, that gravy was delicious!

The only con about this place is that it's a bit tiny. Place gets packed and people waiting for tables are standing around blocking the walk ways.

1262471,2018-06-02,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"A really tasty spot.  I came here before I went to get my tattoo in Vegas.  Needed something hearty.  When you driving down the dean Martin street...first thing you notice is the big billboard sign that says skinny fats.  When you pull in...there's pretty decent size parking.  Unless the place is really packed...you probably won't have issues with parking.

Walking into the place, you notice how lively and colorful the place is.  So many different images and colors on the walls...the staff here are super friendly and helpful.  Medium size restaurant....two rows of seats and barstools along one side of the wall.  They have two different types of menu.  ""Happy"" and ""healthy"".  I ordered the cherry popper...a ""happy"" burger.

The burger was bomb!  The burger was ginormous, and the patty was juicy.  Cooked perfectly.  There was an over easy egg on top.  Wished it was more gooey...but the burger itself was delicious.  It came with truffle fries.  That was excellent too.  The fries were nice and crispy.  I ate the whole plate!  So good!

I would definitely come back!  Actually I did...came back after my tattoo .  I would recommend this place if you're in Vegas.",3JApsX8WRBnGD2ktE8KC9A,0,0,5,SlAZ4Nr3R224xsPwvwmpnA

There is a version of the buffalo cauliflower I have had that is to die for, and so this one was just okay by comparison.

The Thai Salad - I would have many times over as I loved this and a good size as well.

There menu is an overload of goodness that it took me a minute to decide what to eat. The cheerful staff members were happy to bring that overload to a boiling point by mentioning secret menu items they also had. 

Finally I made the decision to go w/ their version of nachos, the Hot Mess (Flour tortilla chips, buffalo chicken bites, pico, cheese sauce, jalape√±os, sour cream & jalape√±o ranch). Everything was SO tasty. I had my reservations about the chips, but I get that these is a healthier type of nachos. The size of the chips though was my main issue as they broke off while trying to gather all the ingredients on the chip. The chips were a bit bigger than the normal sized chips that come in a nacho setup. Other than that the flavors were quite tasty. 

I also got Hot Chix (Breaded buffalo chicken, bleu, pico, avocado & fried jalape√±o strips over romaine tossed in buffalo ranch) to go. Such a tasty salad. 

W/ so many options to choose from this place is def one I will be going back to for more tasty treats. The atmosphere is so clean & full of energy. Love it!",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,0,0,4,DMBjW8zM-UL-UDUGCP5z4A

I had the sweet cheese us, a philly with REAL b√©chamel sauce base, quality cheddar and pepper jack, cherry peppers, caramelized onion and portabello mushroom. The roll was perfect, sandwich not greasy. The steak shocked me since its not that super chopped stuff you usually get. The sandwich is a little on the spicy side though for you wimps out there. It's definitely one of my top 3 philly's i've ever had. Also, try the sodas. Never heard of the company until now, but i had the black cherry soda. Free refills!!

Their menu is split between a healthy and happy side. I enjoyed both. The meals I've had were the Smoke in a Bowl, More Cow Bowl, The Meltdown, and the Sweet Cheese Us. I highly recommend giving those a try. The bowls were full of flavor and filled me up. I did not feel groggy whatsoever. The patties that were used for The Meltdown and Sweet Cheese Us were light, fresh, and juicy. The pieces of bread used for the sandwiches were nicely toasted. The sandwiches came with a choice of a side and I was instantly hooked on their crispy sweet potato fries. I did try two of their appetizers: The Caulifire and Fats Pickles. Sadly, I wasn't a fan of either one of them. The sauce used for the cauliflower was too runny for my liking and the fried pickles were drenched in oil when I received them. After dabbing the grease off of two pickles the napkin was done for. Besides that, I did enjoy my visits to this restaurant.",ZTb2huIBFYqwZkpZw6Wxfw,0,0,4,IJnS8L_Jx8rLVXQ2j6aIRQ

Which by the way staff is super friendly, answers any questions and patient while you try to figure out what to order. 

I went ahead and ordered one of their healthy smoothies, sweet cheese us and the shareable caulifire.  First I really love the concept of this restaurant. They have the ""healthy"" side and the ""happy"" side. I was on vacation so I went straight to happy.  Their variation of the philly sub was sooooo good and it had plenty of cheese which definitely made me happy.  The fries were okay I think I would have preferred trying the sweet potatoes fries. They also had their own variation of ketchup which was neat but I just wanted plain ketchup which wasn't to be found. The caulifire had more of a kick than I expected but very good.  The smoothie was definitely healthy no added sugars which I loved.  Little different then most other smoothies but well blended and good taste. I believe I had the hangover cure in preparation to the night to come. They have other items on menu I'd like to try so if ever back in Vegas I may have to add it again to this list.",9lmClvXsfdwhZxw8JYUN-A,1,0,5,zCZoFJM5vZSHFbfEk0P09Q

Sometimes on the weekend or during peak times, there is a wait. At this specific location, it can be cutthroat to grab a table!

One side of the menu is their ""skinny"" side and the other is their ""enjoy yourself"" side. ;) You'll find there might be a menu item on one side with it's skinny/fat counterpart on the opposite side of the menu, which I like. Don't let any guilt dissuade you from ordering from the ""fats"" side as it's all so yummy. If you and a friend have to order from the skinny side, get something from the other side to share!

I would caution that if you want the egg ontop runny to always state the way you would like your egg cooked. I have gone in a few times and had the egg fried hard, instead of over easy. I don't always pay $12 burger for a burger, but when I do, I expect it to be cooked to order. ;) I When I brought the error to the attention of the server a new egg was made. The Cherry Popper is great and get ready to GET MESSY! The slaw provides some sauce which will in fact run down your hand and arm. The burger is always just as juicy! The sweet potatoe fries were fried to the excellent place of oh so crunch-EE and carmalized on the outside. Strawberry Lemonade is great but can be hit or miss and slightly watery. Don't forget to grab one of the three to four AMAZING cookies! You will NOT be disappointed!!!! Yummo! My daughter ALWAYS orders the Red Velvet Waffle and she LOVES all the fruit.

The cherry popper was good, had a tiny spice to it and was really sweet.

Will eating here make me skinny? Hahah, I wish! I'm so glad I found this spot though. It's in an unassuming lot and small. It's close to the 15 and the service is quick. You pay, wait for your food, eat, and leave. I like this kind of efficiency.

Portions are big, and juicy. I had the Smotherload, and was it a mother load...of deliciousness! There's cheese, pico, and tender steak pieces smothered with a delicious cheese on top. I won't get skinny off this, but I'll definitely come back for more!

Ii is in a hidden industrial center put well worth the extra drive to find it. Upon arrival, I realized that I had been here 2.5 years ago when I was in Vegas and just had not bookmarked it on yelp. 

There was only 1 other group eating in the resturant when we arrived and by the time we finished there was four other groups. Good decor on the inside which keep things interesting, however in the night there is not much lighting and it is very difficult to see everything but the lit-up menu. Staff was friendly and helpful in their recommendations. 

For food we ordered the Meltdown which was a half pend of beef with Caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, aioli and tomato between two sourdough pieces of bread, and then grilled.- So good. I also was able to share the Cherry popper burger which is a wee bi spicy with flavor nonetheless. I was not a huge fan of the coleslaw on it however, and next time might try a burger patty with other toppings. The third member of my party ordered the GOAT salad with Goat cheese, Filet Mignon, Infused pears, Walnuts and Strawberries over a bed of Spinach. A good salad, above ordinary but not the best I have ever had. 

I give this place 5 starts for atmosphere/art work, the quick service, and the originality of their food (as well as tastiness We found it just as good as when I had previously tried it in the past, no wonder it has so many good reviews on yelp.

Nice to Greek you was really delicious, it tastes great. I only didn't like Zucc It which was insanely spicy. We only took a few bites on that.

I drove by this place on my way home from another favorite place on the area and decided to stop for breakfast. The outside doesn't look much like a restaurant, you really need to know what your looking for, but since I had read about it on yelp, I knew it was there. The place is small about the size of your average subway shop but nicely designed, modern tables, modern chairs and newly designed classic meals. The menu features healthy and not so healthy options so there's surely something on the menu for everyone, it seems that we were there during fat hour. We ordered the phatty Philly with truffle fries (good) and the chicken & waffles from the secret menu  (good)  but the (wow) factor was missing. Still, a good meal for the price. Service was wonderful everyone here is very attentive and very friendly, if they were any more friendlier they'll be competing with the neighboring business. 
This is a good concept  and I'm glad someone noticed that there are two kinds of people.....yelpers and non yelpers.
I'm sure I'll be back, it seems that I drive by this place to often. It may not be on the strip but is right by the strippers.

For every menu category, there's a ""healthy"" side (which includes calorie listings) and a ""happy"" side (which does not). So there's indeed something for everyone!

Having just gotten off the plane at LAS, I stopped in to try the Pimp Shrimp, a shared plate of tempura shrimp over a hollowed-out cucumber ""boat,"" topped with pico de gallo and drizzled with a cilantro sauce. The flavors were quite nice, though I found that the pico made the shrimp lose its crispiness and warmth. I also had the STEAKation sandwich, which consisted of shaved NY strip steak, arugula, tomato, onion, and horseradish sauce on a wheat bun--the flavors of the tender, thinly-sliced meat along with the crispness of the vegetables was simply delicious! On every table, there was also a bottle of black pepper ketchup, which had a nice smoky-spiciness to it--a perfect complement to the beef. Every sandwich also comes with a side, and I got the cauliflower rice, a surprisingly flavorful yet simple plate of riced cauliflower. Nice!

From its location and size, you'd be convinced it was a commercial office space in its past life.  Though it is 'cozy,' the lay out proves the space is used optimally, and the artistic details make for a unique setting.

Order at the counter, then grab a number and a seat.  The menu provides an interesting take and variety on [namely] American cuisine.  Me and my late lunch date tried something from the 'healthy' side and the 'happy' side.  The Slow Boat to China is essentially a chicken & cucumber salad, with a few other veggies, nuts, and a glaze that most closely resembled eel sauce.  It is presented as a boat (thus the name), and tasted like a California Roll.  I enjoyed it, though questioned how 'healthy' it really was on account of the sauce.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, which were prepared to a crisp--and delicious! From the 'happy' side, we ordered the Benedict Burger with truffle fries.  It was rather well done, but still juicy, considering.  I am a sucker for eggs on a burger, so I liked it before I even tried it.  It had the usual veggie fixins plus avocado.  Not a burger I absolutely must have again, but a tasty, well made burger.  Likewise, the accompanying truffle fries were pretty good, but nothing different from any truffle fries I've tried before.  Granted, we were not so adventurous with our selections; We came more for necessity than foodie experimentation [and left very satisfied].  Next time, I will give one of their Philly Cheesesteak options a spin, as well as their loaded fries.  The photos and descriptions look amazing.

The portions are pretty large/definitely shareable.  Bonus points for flavored ketchup options! The jalapeno one was my favorite.  Service was great.  Staff is friendly.  I would definitely take friends and family here.",BakkcRVP_xIihFPtvhBDZA,2,0,5,kLaiZe-N7dyPcuSXjdCLCg

I was immediately drawn to the protein waffle with fresh fruit and turkey bacon (although turkey bacon made we worried). Overall it was fabulous and I ended up loving the turkey bacon!

My husband ordered chicken and waffle. The waffle was standard issue. The only critique was the chicken. Extra spices would have kicked it up a notch. Chicken was a bit bland without.

There is something for that. Do you eat gluten free stuff or are you vegan? Well, you're in luck! The young lady, Jocelyn working the register told me there is something for everyone here. She was very nice and was able to give some insight on the items. 

Since it was my first time I had to go with the Cherry Popper (you never will forget your first time, unless it wasn't done right, and I'm sure if it wasn't cooked to your liking they will make you another). Burger topped with an egg and some coleslaw, plus a little spice to give it a kick. I love the taste of a fried egg on top of burgers. Since I'm not real fan of French fries, I decided to go with the cauliflower rice. I was trying to balance out my meal and make part of it vegan. The rice was so delicious. They mix it with some garlic. You will need to try it. 

I was able to sneak a bite of the bacon and sausage from my bro's plate. He swore it was the best bacon he ever had. I thought it was good. I could not leave without trying some of their cookies. The cookies are on display next to the register. My will power was non-existent that morning. The salted caramel and snicker-doodle was recommended. I decided to go with it. The cookies are a bit pricey at $3/each but they were well worth it. 

The restaurant is easy to find since they have a huge billboard alongside the road. You can't miss it, right off Dean Martin Dr., located in an industrial park. The place is small inside. Think of a small starbux with lots of tables. Not ideal for large groups. I did notice one group of six and they were comfortable. Most of the tables sit 4 and a few sit 2. There is also a long counter near the entrance to sit and enjoy your food if you're riding solo. Water is available next to the cookies.

1438081,2014-01-25,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Its actually kind of funny how their name suggests pretty much is what on their menu. They have a healthy side and a fatty side. My friend and I have been hearing a lot about this place and been dying to find a time to try it one day. 

Luckily, our first chance as at a Yelp charity event where SkinnyFats participated and offered a few items on their menu as samples. Those samples were enough to make us want to go try the real place even more. Everything was so good ! Samples of chix on broadway sliders on hawaiian sweet bread, ahi tacos, two juices, and other things. 

Chance finally came when two friends from Cali came into town and we were lookin for a lunch place. To my surprise, the place was actually quite small. I could almost swear i saw pictures, somewhere, where it showed a bigger place. i must be dreaming .... When we came, it was lunch time and was packed, but luckily, by the time we ordered, two tables cleared out and we got a place to sit. 

As with most foodies, each get a different thing, and try each others food, and so we did...

Phatty Philly w/ Truffle Fries - This was what i had ordered. Steak, sauteed onions, peppers, portobello mushrooms, blue cheese & steak sauce on a hoagie bun. The ABSOLUTE FIRST THING you notice after taking a bite, ""OH MY GOD THATS A LOT OF BLUE CHEESE!!!"" wow what a punch in the face with the strong blue cheese sauce. I didnt expect it to be that strong. It actually covers a lot of the other ingredients flavors. Its great if you are a blue cheese lover, but being someone who not exactly like it nor do i hate it, it was surprising. Aside from that, the steak was super tender. great quality meat, juicy, and cooked to perfection. Next time, i would ask for some grilled onions and jalepenos too and switch out the blue cheese for something lighter like a provolone. 

The fries were nice and crispy. Finally a place that doesnt drench their fries in truffle oil. Its still noticeable but it doesnt kick you in the mouth. EAT IT WITH THE JALEPENO KETCHUP ! delicious ! 

Chix on Broadway - One of the things tried before, and fell in love with (at the yelp event). Breaded chicken breast on a brioche bun with cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion, and lemon aioli. Though bun is different, the sandwich is still as amazing as the sampler. One of the very few places who can actually cook a chicken breast and still keep it tender and juicy ! Lemon aioli sauce gives it a bright flavor melding the entire sandwich together. For some odd reason, red onions were more spicy than sweet. My friend took them out. She wasnt a fan on bacon either. MUST TRY ! 

Cheeseburger Benedict - 1/2 pound angus buger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, and a fried egg. This was what my friend ordered. I'm not a fan of burgers but apparently the burger was so huge, it fell apart while he was eating. He pretty much went fork & knife for the rest of the burger. At least the person who ordered it was happy? XD

Drunken Gypsy Toast - Came here after dinner with my friend who thought this place had more desserts. Apparently she saw the sunday sundaes. Oops? We shared this gypsy toast as a dessert. Topped with fresh cut fruit (strawberries, bananas, and blueberries), whipped cream, a side of syrup, and a few things of bacon. Her nor i being a fan of bacon, that immediately went to another friend. Upon first glance, the toast reminded me of the McD's hotcakes. just by the sheer shape and look. The toast was nice and thick but fluffy. Good breakfast item (as what it was designed for) lol o well. still good nonetheless. 

Overall, great place in an awkward location yet still so busy, and popular. Would love to come back to try other things, like the acai bowl !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,5,2fLjAoSjsawdXd3QWj76BA

But, the service needs a little work -- only due to the high volume of customers in contrast to the shack 's setup. It took me thirty minutes to order and once I did order, there was nowhere to sit. However, the staff is full of plenty congenial characters. Plain and simple, the ordering process is akin to Smashburger. The only difference is you're cared for more closely at this establishment. A waitress here named Ashley said that they're opening a new location, though she didn't know where specifically, so perhaps the setup at the new location will be better.",mpMt9wsacQ_wMEaM3xkjzQ,0,0,4,6MWN_BndB554urHLbqsbrQ

I love that there are two versions of the same type of meal... the healthy versus the happy. I've had the Drunken Monkey Cakes and the Rediculous (Red Velvet waffles), Ahi Srirachi, and Ahi TacoSan.. all of which were DELISH!  Obviously I prefer to be happy versus healthy, but I learned that you could kindda make your own version of both and mix up the happy and healthy. Best of both world, if you will.

It was my second time going to this location, and I prefer it over the Warm Springs location because it is more quaint and not as commercial. It's a cool place to meet friends and chit chat. It is on the smaller side, so large groups would probably not fare well. 

* Just a word of advice... Watch out for the sign. It's easy to miss if you're not paying attention. It's in a business park and unless you're looking, there aren't really any glaring signs like other restaurants. Also it is easy to get lost on the side streets if you're coming on the highway... there aren't any direct access roads to Dean Martin Dr. from the exits on the 15.",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,0,0,5,nCphtCa3TRnaupS1k7YH0A

I had placed an order online to give myself time to pick up food on the way to work. It was just one item off the menu and the order said it would be ready in 25 minutes which is exactly when I arrived. They hadn't even began to make the order upon my arrival and I let them know not to even bother because I didn't have time to wait which is why I placed the order ahead of time. 

Here's where everything turned around. While processing my refund, the cook quickly threw together their ""Smoke in a Bowl"" which isn't what I ordered, but they knew I wouldn't have a chance to eat until after work so they wanted to make sure I had something to eat. On top of the free meal, I received a phone call from I'm guessing the manager, or maybe just an employee, that I have a $20 gift card waiting for me the next time I visit.

It is a nice unique touch to the ""usual"" fast food restaurants. One side of the menu features healthy food entrees while the other half features not as healthy entrees. The food overall is pretty good. Its a nice place to go for 2 with anyone who is on a diet or is a health conscious individual and a food junkie in one restaurant. 

The girl taking the order at the register was really nice. She was the definition of delightful. I felt like ordering more just based off of her delightfulness. 

It is a fairly costly place as a downside but quality is something you always have to pay a bit more for right? One thing I didn't like was that the signing receipt was asking for a tip after I swiped my credit card...if this was a service place where the servers come to the table and ask me for my order, fill drinks, etc...then I would understand a tip area. 
Makes me wonder..does the owner not pay the employees enough that they ask the customer to pay for the food(customer covering cost plus profit) and the employee(covering owners cost) making the food as well??

My favorite thing about restaurants is the vibe I get when stepping in. Although this place is small, it's got a big personality. 

So on to the food. 

Here's what we ordered:
-Fat's Pickles
-Caulifire
-Smoke in a bowl
-Wrap Supastar
-The Classic
-Hot Chix

The Fat's PIckles were great! They were crisp crunchy and came with this delicious sauce that actually compliments that sour taste. These pickles weren't soggy; it kept its flavorful crunch.

Caulifire: Yum! That buffalo sauce tastes great on that neutral cauliflower taste; comes a bit of a pico de gallo mix on top. The sauce isn't necessarily ranch either. It's definitely a delicious alternative. 

Smoke in a bowl: The chicken was perfect. The flavors that stood out was the mix of the black beans, cilantro and pineapple! Talk about such a tropical burst on your palette! I loved it! 

Wrap Supastar: My friend basically engulfed this thing so that's all that's needed to be said about that. 

The Classic: So I was able to try my friend's burger; the burger is pretty good. I dont care much for burgers and sometimes can't distinguish the differences; I personally wouldn't order this again...maybe for the french fries though (Truffles yum).

Hot Chix: Loaded with a kick of buffalo sauce on chicken; this huge bowl of goodness is both aromatic and just a kick in yo face type of goodness. The blends of flavors of this dish is just perfect for those who like a 7 course meal that your taste-buds experience as you finish the meal. 

Needless to say, SkinnyFats provides a pandemonic awakening of your tastes buds. So please, do yourself a flavor and try them out. The service, the comfort, the friendliess, enthusiasm and the kick ath delicious food options is a must try!",_UczakmbJlCal7mCXuq7og,0,0,5,JusgLtfQenOflz0XkOkRDw

Getting to my review, be prepared to hear nothing but the truth. In all honesty, the place was just...fabulous. It's self-seating, so you order up at the counter and they serve to your table. Note: it is not very big, so a party of 5+ will not do! Great place for a date, though ;)

Nothing on the menu is overpriced. I got the Berry Strong breakfast, which entailed an uber-fluffy round waffle (that took up the whole plate!) topped with a creamy, berry sauce and fresh berries, a homemade, marmalade-esque, citrus syrup to drench it with, and two strips of tasty turkey bacon.  This dish was wholesome, fresh, and delicious all over! Ugh, if only words could make it appear again. 

Service was fine-tuned, the food came in no less than 10 minutes (I swear!) and the waiters were gentlemen. And cleanup crew was skillfully fast, because when we got up to leave, our table was wiped down so fast that a couple got seated there before we were out the door!

1585815,2014-01-06,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"My husband and I drove all the way from North Las Vegas to try this place. It was very good. I can understand all the reviews about the size of the place. It is quite small with approximately 8 tables or so. Despite the size, very trendy and inviting.
I LOVE THE REUSABLE CUPS!!! Great idea and forward thinking marketing. Next time I use mine it's great advertising for them. 
Since we drove 30 miles to eat here, I was very excited. I had previewed the menu online and read fellow Yelpers reviews before our journey. I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order. My husband ordered the Chix on Broadway and the Caprazy salad. I ordered the slow boat to China and the Chix Flats. 
Slow boat to China was Delicious! The sauces were delicious and the perfect sweet/salty/creamy compliment to the fresh cucumber flavor. The Chix Flats was tasty as well. The chicken was juicy and the salad on top was fresh and flavorful. 
My husband was highly impressed with the Chix on Broadway. It was a huge sandwich. He had to cut it in half in order to be able to hold it. I had a piece of the bacon from his sandwich, Thumbs up! The truffle fries were just ok... the balsamic ketchup was the perfect compliment to them. The Caprazy salad was good. Nothing all that different or special about it. 
The service wad excellent. Our food came out quickly and correctly. There was a very nice young man that cleared our plates and asked us about our meal. He was very friendly and we spoke about how far we had traveled. He was sincere in thanking us as we left and invited us to return.

1607027,2015-07-31,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFats is a restaurant that balanced out healthy food and happy food. Their healthy menu contains a variety of salads, sandwiches, flatbreads, and sides with healthier ingredients, while their happy menu contains the same repertoire with ingredients not as beach body oriented, let's say.

I went to SkinnyFats and was offered a ""secret menu"" item, as several appeared on a little monitor set on top of their cash wrap. What I ordered was some sort of turkey club-sequel sandwich, but way better. It had whole grain bread, fresh tomatoes and baby arugula, creamy goat cheese, crispy bacon, and the juiciest chicken with a side of fries, yes -- the not as beach body oriented ones.

The orchestra of flavors from the sandwich was great. The tingly creamy sourness of the goat cheese acting as an enzyme for the gamut of flavor notes that the sandwich had. The fresh tomatoes and arugula gave the sandwich a crunch and freshness that held you by the hand and walked you over to the juiciness of the grilled chicken -- and just when you thought you had hit the cusp of the flavourful ride -- there was that crunch from the bacon that just cannot be underestimated in a sandwich. The saltiness but firm flavor made it a grand experience, it just culminated in a subtle mix of sour freshness that was neutralized by the bacon and then layer with the tasty, toasted but slightly soggy from the veggies, whole grain bread.
My girlfriend ordered a tuna salad, with greens, berries, nuts, and dressing,  which I was unable to get to but I assume they were as fresh as my vegetables, and seared tuna. The tuna had a crunchy bordering which was citrusy and a bit crunchy. The texture was, as most raw tuna, slimy but the flavor had a slight hint of the spices used to sear it and its own fishy flavor. It was a delicious flavor profile but I bet it must have been better with the other greens and components of the salad.

Needless to say, I am definitely going back to SkinnyFats in the near future.",dNi1jsDygj1tdrol3I8wtg,0,0,4,7emzW_rdF7T3v-H6kO84AA

The entire menu is delicious! I ordered the 'Mean Bean' which normally consists of a housemade black bean party, spinach, red onion, tomato, avocado, spicy hummus, and a wheat bun (if is on the ""Between the Buns - Healthy"" section). They were very accommodating to my requests and exchanged it to be wrapped in lettuce with grilled onions and normal hummus. I loved loved loved it and have been craving it ever since. The black bean patty was yummy and I left feeling full, but like I had eaten something good for me. I also tried the 'Hangover Remedy' (a juice consisting of Apple, cucumber, celery, carrot, beer, spinach, and ginger - only 191 calories!). It was very tasty and refreshing, definitely recommend it. My friends ordered the 'Healthy Chicks' breakfast (3 egg whites, turkey bacon, fruit, and 9 grain toast). They loved their meals as well!

Stopped here for lunch and beyond thrilled that we tried this little hole in the wall eatery. 
The atmosphere is lively and fun. The service was quick and knowledgeable.  The restaurant was clean with great seating. 

By far the best flavors I've had in a long time. Both my appetizer and entree were layered in flavor. My taste buds were delightfully tantalized. 

First we had a signature entree called the Slow Boat to China. It was a Asian chicken salad ontop of a cute cucumber boat topped with amazing slaw, chopped almonds and a spicy sauce. 

For my entree I had the Cherry Popper burger. It was incredible. I've never tasted anything like this burger before. AHHHHHMAZZZING!!
It was a half pound juicy beef patty, topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg, pepper jack cheese, spicy slaw and a delicious pepper marinade served on a Hawaiian roll.

We also ordered a strawberry lemonade, which was amazing! The lemonade is made in-house and it tastes so fresh. 

Although the food did not wow us, the service was really good. I wish I knew the name of the girl who talked to us, but she was super helpful. She gave us a lot of suggestions and had a good attitude which I always respect. 

Honestly, I feel like this place is a little overrated, but I will return sometime so I can try some of the healthier dishes.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,3,1,3,50elZv_BJ8WYRLhaSKklug
1693754,2018-02-07,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"First the story.  I am in Las Vegas for business and that included Super Bowl Sunday.  I really didn't want to eat out so I searched for a nearby take-out that I could run to at halftime.  I found SkinnyFATS on Yelp, read the reviews and proceeded to place my online order.  The order was confirmed.  Right at halftime I went to pickup my order and they had closed early to allow their employees to go home and watch the game.  Bummer for me.  Now, as Paul Harvey would say, for the rest of the story.  SkinnyFATS not only refunded my money but gave me a credit for more than my original order had been.  Thank you, great customer service!

Now for my meal (the next day).  I again ordered online.  The food was ready at the designated pickup time and it was delicious! The order size was actually more than I could eat.",24e1SAOBBys9Z5U3DXI3Gg,2,2,4,gAeviLiydsDOCudtHcnuTA

What we ordered: 
- Wake 'n Bacon: ordered with egg whites instead and a side of fruit. The fruit wasn't as fresh as I would have liked, but the sandwich was really good.
- Vegwich: Made with portobello mushroom with a side of sweet potato fries. I could eat this every day. The mushroom was so perfectly grilled, very juicy. The sweet potato fries had the perfect crunch in them.
- Coffee: Freshly brewed and comes with almond milk if you ask.

Place your orders at the counter,  they will bring your food out to your table. They also make sure to check up on you if you need anything. Place is pretty small with tables jammed packed. Be prepared to be cozy with your neighbors. Overall, this is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch.

Be sure to try their own special (smoked or regular) jalapeno ketchup! Next time I'm definitely bringing a bottle back with me. Can't wait to come back again next time in town.",q841aGW6y2D3OwSRB6w6nw,6,5,5,f-mesavIp_j4fnl_ioEXOA

1728391,2015-06-27,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"First time at SkinnyFats in Las Vegas. The stars I gave this establishment speak for themselves. I wasn't even half way pleased. Arrived at about 4:45 on a Sunday, well before their 6pm closing time. First walking in, I noticed the drink machine was behind the counter. Oh helllll no. If I'm going to pay $2 for a small drink, I want to fill it up MYSELF when I want. I shouldn't have to go wait in the outrageous line just to have my drink filled. I proceeded to order the chick-a-waffa-dopalis (best spelling I could manage). It's their chicken & waffles. Lemme tell you, I love chicken & waffles so my expectations were high. I also ordered a side of sweet potato truffle fries. My chick&waff didn't take too long so when it got to the table I was optimistic. Good sized waffle topped with a good amount of boneless chicken strips. Unfortunately, I firstly noticed that there was barely any syrup AT ALL on top. I had to ask for a side of it. I first took a bite of a chicken strip... Delicious!!! The small amount of syrup was just enough to make the tender chicken have a sweet taste. This turned out to be the only part of my experience that I enjoyed. I then proceeded to try the waffle.... It was barely even warm. Borderline cold. Terrible. I had to take bites of the chicken and waffle at the same time just to make it seem like the waffle was warm. Oh and the sweet potato truffle fries?? Halfway into my meal and I still haven't received them, but my friend had gotten his. What's worse than that? I also hadn't received my drink half way into my meal. That's absolute horrible service. A lady walked by and my friend asked for a side of syrup and she quickly turned and said ok and I tried to ask for my drink but she quickly turned and hurried to the back. Very rude. So about half way into my meal, I have a completely cold waffle, no more chicken, no fries and no drink. Will not return.",NCROJbfbOS2dEkfA0qOzYA,0,0,2,uNiLHZHkUmbMIsUfAYW3Gg
1728894,2014-01-17,4,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Been meaning to come here forever! It was one thing or another that delayed me trying this place but finally I made it! Glad I did too! Lunch hour here is crazy busy! Good thing Mel & Terri R was able to snag a table for us since they got there early.

Everything off the Skinny /Healthy and Happy/Fats side sounded really good! I ended up getting two entrees! Bonjour Brulee a breakfast entree and Beets by Goat a salad entree off the ""Healthy"" menu side.

I chose the Skinny side not because it was the healthier choices but because I love goat cheese and arugula incorporated in my salads and beets too!  And when the Bonjour Brulee french toast topped with fresh berries, drizzled in agave was presented to me, I was impressed! So I had no regrets with my choices! Both salad and french toast were delicious! It also came with two silver dollar turkey sausage patties which I skipped.  I took a bite and didn't like it anyways. So I can do without that. The juices and shakes sounded good but were on the pricier side. As much as some of the entrees. So I can do without that too.

It's a fast casual restaurant. Place your order at the counter and they'll bring it to you when it's ready. I don't think the dining area is small for the space it's in. There's enough tables. It's just this place is so popular! That's a good thing though right?? The turnaround for a table here can be a while during the lunch hours then again, it's busy all day!

The line to order during the time I was there was out the door long! So I highly suggest you call or use the app you can get for your phone to place your order and pickup will be quicker. Yelp app or online has a place also where you can order for delivery or pickup!

Parking wasn't really a problem, that's if you park further away from their store front and don't mind walking a little more. 

Location in an industrial setting is pretty innovative if you ask me. What a great idea for a start up business, it's probably more cost effective to lease space here. I so would find it a bonus having a restaurant nearby my workplace. It wasn't too hard to find the place for me. Your visual cue is (NB on Dean Martin) the  ""Post Commerce"" sign on the corner of the industrial lot Skinnyfats is located. If your SB on Dean Martin, it's just past the railroad track crossing. Entrance to Skinnyfats is facing I-15.

From what I noticed all the people who were on their lunch hour, no one seemed to mind waiting for their food, waiting in line, or waitng for table or waiting at all! Must be they've ate from the ""happy"" side of the menu alot. Just know there's a wait, but the food is worth it!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,8,9,4,XYZkMh5OZWA003YrQW3Qww

We had burgers, chicken sandwiches, some kind of tofu dish, and salads, and everything I tried was wonderful. The chicken sandwich had thick, flavorful bacon on it, and the servings were HUGE. I loved the bread they used for the sandwiches, and they arranged the salad toppings into peace signs which was totally cute. I will say that the burgers were definitely rare, which I think is the best way to eat beef, but I think it bothered some people. HUGE portions, delicious food, and the catering staff was punctual, friendly, and efficient.

It is located a bit out of the way however it is definitely worth the drive because the food is just that good. The interior decor of this place is really nice to, definitely some interesting things to keep your mind occupied while you wait for your food. The aesthetically pleasing interior combined with impeccable cleanliness to this place made me feel comfy and at ease.

I was fortunate enough to chat with the owners a bit (skinny & fats) and these guys are super down to earth and stoked on any input from the customers. They are on site regularly and take pride in their food. They are constantly doing specials and making all kinds if secret menu items (chicken and waffles is a must). As far as the regular menu goes it is creative, well done, and most likely inspired by some pot smoking. 

The idea of choosing skinny or the fat side of  menu is a great edge to this spot and you can't go wrong whichever way you go. Also the employees here are great to, nothing but smiles from all of them!

All in all I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Yes it gets crowded and yes seating can be a pain and yes it's a bit off the beaten path.

There are two doors by the entrance.  One is glass and the other has their logo on it.  Go through the glass doors.  The other one leads you into their kitchen area.  Im guessing they probably don't want me back there.  Once you've chosen the correct door, it takes you into their dining area.  It is quite small.  Smaller than many places for dining in.  The employees are very good at cleaning the table off right away as soon as someone leaves.  

Service here was great.  The two girls taking orders were very polite and friendly.  The others who were brining out the meals were also very kind in making sure you had everything you needed.  Gold stars for the employees here!

They have a great variety of options on their menu.  Breakfast, healthy menu and happy menu.  There are also many kinds of healthy juices to try.  So I went with the TBLT off of the healthy menu.  Just like a regular BLT but with turkey bacon and whole grain bread.  Of course I had to try their sweet potato fries on the side.  I was completely happy with the healthy sandwich!  They certainly did not skimp on the turkey bacon.  It was so delicious especially with their awesome fries.  The fries were brought out in a bowl.  I had enough to share with my friend!

Both were fantastic! Saturday we decided to go back for the second time. The experience was extremely disappointing. My husband and I ordered the Phatty Philly and Ahi Tacos to split. The guy informed us that the deeper Fryer was broken so no truffle fries and no Ahi Taco. However he did suggest the sirachi tacos so we agreed to give it a shot because he said he liked it. We agreed to a side salad instead of the fries (obviously disappointed).  When our order came the Phatty philly was good but it had no blue cheese or mushrooms inside which are two main ingredients. The side salad had chopped cucumbers in it which my husband was very specific in ordering no cucumbers  in the salad. They remade us a salad no problem and the house dressing was very tasty but the tomatoes were soggy. Now when I bit into the Sirachi taco I was expecting the same goodness as the Ahi Tacos but was caught off guard with how disgusting it was. I literally wanted to spit it right out my mouth. It was as if they hadn't seared the fish at all. It was a cold fish taco. Yuk!! Even though we had a bad experience I will give this place one more shot because the first time the food was so good.

Not only is the food FANTASTIC, the entire restaurant is on point with their branding and attention to detail. They break the menu down into a ""healthy"" section, as well as a ""happy"" section. Brilliant and clever!

I also have to say that their juice bar was top notch. I had the Liquid Defense and my husband got orange strawberry juice. They come in reusable cups, complete with a ""happy meter"". Again; funny, clever, well branded!

Very random location. In a very secluded industrialized commercial center off of the 15 freeway between russell and tropicana. In ny opinion, the location is the only thing keeping this business from its potential. However, the unusual location does not give me reason to subtract stars.

Great food,l and great service. This place has it going and if youre ever in the city, avoid the buffets along the strip and come to skinnyfats where you will experience something unlike other!",jCUqHcg4xvFtsG6ah6RcRA,1,2,5,-M00W82ci716aG9w66QBCA

1831533,2017-11-14,3,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFATS has a little bit of something for everyone. Their menu consist of the 'healthy side' for me who was craving one ""healthy"" meal while on vacation, and the 'happy side' for my hubby who loves all things fried, greasy and delightful. 

All cravings are welcomed. You can crave steak, scrambled eggs, meatballs, chia pudding, and whatever, and they prepare those items both ways, the 'healthy way' and the 'happy way'. 

We tried a breakfast bowl with scrambled egg whites, turkey sausage and a variety of vegetables (healthy side). It was light, fresh and hardy. They also serve the breakfast menu all day which is nice since it was noon but I wanted a breakfast item. 

We also tried the 'Chix on Broadway' and 'Pimp Shrimp' (happy side). The 'Chix on Broadway' came with a very lightly and crispy breaded chicken with cheese and aioli between two buns. The chicken was juicy and tender. The 'Pimp Shrimp' was pieces of tempura shrimp and spicy slaw and cilantro pico sauce on top of a whole skinless cucumber. The cucumber was refreshing after bites of the fried shrimp and spicy sauce. The sweet potato side was amazing that I couldn't stop eating it. It had bits of sugar that enhanced the sweetness of the potatoes and I highly recommend this side. 

This place is ways off the strip but can be reached by driving (plenty of parking) or uber/lyft. The inside is so vibrant with colorful drawings on the walls and symbols to promote healthy and happy living.",3JJGEQ6nV3edLA9Aso2mNA,3,4,5,sljml7oSGdjQbGP6P0TDVw

Saw this resto on Yelp and Instagram. Very appealing pictures but they don't do the food justice.  Was with a group so was able to try a few different things on the menu. Ordered from the healthy AND the happy sides :)

*Happy Mess: bf says it's like a healthier version of carne asada fries
*Chix on Broadway: chicken was juicy and the batter wasn't greasy, plus!
*Phatty Philly: tender meat and succulent portobello
*Burger Benedict: wow! the egg was the ""cherry on top""
*Ahi Srirachi: loved the freshness of these fish tacos!

For drinks, gf got the How Now Brown Cow (twist on root beer float)... and I got the Jazz Hands (Sprite and mangoes). There were cut up strawberries and mangoes, in our shakes, respectively. We both agreed we liked the weird fizz feeling when chomping into the soaked up fruits =P

In any case, I like the decor of the place, however, I always feel like we are all a bunch of cramped herd whenever I'm there.  They really don't have much space in there and I don't know about you, but I really don't like to have asses on my face while trying to eat.  Okay, perhaps some asses I don't mind but I'm sure you get the point.  The space thing makes me want to give them 4 stars, but their great food and awesome customer service make up for that.  

I've been there many times and although they have a pretty wide variety of food, I've always stuck to their Cranburkey.  It is a Turkey & cranberry patty wtih arugula, tomato, red onion & cranberry yogurt on a wheat bun, however, I get mine minus the onion.  It was literally love at first bite.  They have one of the best, if not the best Turkey Burger I've ever had.  I'm actually obsessed with it!  The patty is always cooked to perfection and it is never too dry nor too over cooked and it is always bursting with flavor, and the bun is also always on point.  I hate whenever I take a bite of a burger and the bread is so buttered up that it overpowers the taste of the patty.

I also get a side of their Truffle Fries and honestly, those are usually a hit or miss.  Sometimes they are just way too oily, and although I like them, they usually give me heartburn for some reason.

1873577,2015-06-19,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"The one thing I don't do often enough is eat breakfast.  So on a recent trip to Vegas, I decided that I'm going to add breakfast on my to-do list :)

After Yelping a couple of breakfast spots near where I was staying, I decided upon SkinnyFats and I was not disappointed.  The overall decor and ambience feels utterly San Francisco-ish:  just my kind of vibe.  

I love that there are two sides to the menu:  the Skinny side and the Fat side.  So if you happen to go with other people who have a different eating agenda/philosophy, this place will definitely mediate that situation.  Though my inclination was to go ahead and order off of their Skinny menu, the vacation part of my mind overruled such thoughts.

I decided upon the country fried steak since I wanted to try something I don't normally eat.  I also tried the chicken and waffles, along with the sugarbetes-inducing banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  

Here's more of the breakdown:

Country Fried Steak:  Yum.  The ""Steak"" itself consists of layers upon layers of thinly sliced New York steak encased in a crunchy, well-seasoned batter, fried to perfection.  It is carefully positioned on a bed of biscuits and topped off with a smothering of country gravy.  Eggs (cooked however you like) accompany the dish.  Every component of this dish synced nicely together.  The steak tasted like a better rendition of your grandma's home cooking.  I suppose it's a cleaner-tasting, more professional reboot of the country classic.

Chicken and Waffles:  Chicken and waffles is a classic dish in its own right.  I have tried the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles and I was not impressed, as I think two things make the dish:  moist, melt-in-your-mouth chicken and light and crispy waffles.  My visit to Roscoe failed at both.  So what is it like here?  The chicken is moist, but very meaty and the waffle is crispy, but not as light as I would have preferred.  I still think the best chicken and waffles can be found at Bruxies (out in SoCal).  

Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes:  It's good.  It's a sweet concoction.  I would never be able to finish a whole order by myself, but I could see myself eating one or two bites.  Then again, I do not have a sweet tooth.

The verdict:  it was all good.  I will add this to my list of places to come back and eat whenever I am in Vegas.",HAsO3VG2uffpUc53bHOYNw,0,0,5,SPCFQwvCWME0wmWOgTxv5g

I got told to steal my table while I was ordering or my seat would get taken. Girl was looking out for me so I thanked her. From here we must've had some confusion with the order because a server got everything except the Motherloader. When I told him I didn't order that he got upset and went back to get me my order fixed. I got no silverware, no napkins, and when I asked for a straw he refused to look at me.

Negative side: I wouldn't call this plate smoke in a bowl. This isn't what I expected when I ordered this I guess i expected more smokey / grilled flavors and ended up having a plate with more of a tomato saucey Italian flavor.

My gripes.

1974337,2018-02-12,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Skinny FATS is a clever restaurant concept with a nice, chic interior and a totally hip menu. The actual execution of the menu leaves a bit to be desired, however, particularly for the price. 

I stopped in one day for lunch and decided to try the TATS (a play on a BLT with turkey bacon instead of regular bacon) and one of the ahi taco san tacos. I chose the truffle fries as my side. 

The TATS was okay, but the bacon was lukewarm and flacid, the avocado was under ripe and the spicy ""yo"" was way too spicy for me. This was pretty disappointing as I love crispy turkey bacon. As for the taco, the tortilla was too chewy and the inside of the ""crispy"" ahi (actually quite soggy) was too cool and also chewy. On top of that, it really didn't have much flavor.

The truffle fries were nice and crispy but they definitely went overboard with the truffle oil. The second I opened the box, my entire office was overcome with the smell.

Overall, the TATS wasn't ""bad"" nor were the truffle fries. They just weren't really worth the price and not something I'd want to order again. The ahi taco san, I'd personally avoid. 3 stars.",WdezEW3GjYnCeOmTCxX1TA,2,0,3,z91um1oLJpr4oQUOL2wJow
1976602,2014-07-04,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"The difficult-to-find location and parking already turned me off a little before I even walked in the door to a line that nearly went out of it. I can only imagine how busy this place must be given that I was there at 2PM on a weekday. 

Line delay combined with small space led to many people standing around awkwardly with nowhere to sit after placing their order. I ordered to go, but standing for nearly half an hour was not ideal. Unable to determine if tables of people were waiting on food or lingering after finishing their meals.

Food: maybe I didn't get the right menu items to justify the hype but they have cut a lot of popular items from the menu so a few of the things I'd had my eye on are no longer options. Both the customers in front of and behind me in line had the same issue. Change is good when warranted, but when asked, an employee couldn't explain why they were no longer selling highly-requested dishes.

Opted for one of each of the ahi tacos- the ahi sriarchi and the ahi taco-san, one healthy and one happy. 
Healthy one was lacking flavor on the actual fish: healthy doesn't mean you can't season the fish, Daily Wellness Kitchen manages a good seasoning on theirs. Additional toppings added flavor but I was underwhelmed by the blandness of the fish itself.
The ahi taco-san was served on a puffy taco, which got soggy fast with the sauces and watery slaw topping. Flavors were a bit more pronounced with this taco, and I enjoyed the fish despite not generally being a tempura fan. The kitchen was heavy-handed with the mayo-based sauce.

I may come back another (carefully-timed) time to dine-in and try more options (is the cranburkey still there?), and the atmosphere seemed cool, but I will likely just wait until they move to a better location- management has commented that a larger 215/Rainbow location is in the works.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,1,3,TvSkN45_HmhQqJZqObYxDw

It wasn't to far from were we live and easy to get to. Great options if you want to eat healthy or if you want to be bad. I wanted to be both!! You have to go to the register to order. I told the employee I heard about them on Yelp. We gave her our order. I asked her if they did anything special for birthdays? She replied ""we just open a couple of weeks ago and we're still working on promotions"".  (Knowing I saw a pic on yelp for a free Birthday shake). I don't like to confront or argue with people because I work in customer service too, and I like to trust and believe they're knowledgeable about their job. Promotions change all the time. 

I ordered the Ahi Srirachi with truffle fries, and How Now Brown Cow (Traditional root beer float). My husband ordered the Burger Benedict with truffle fries, and a Charlie Brown's shake with nutella. We sat down and admired the artwork on the walls. Service was pretty quick. My tacos had mango slaw and srirachi sauce took one bite and the flavors just burst into my mouth. WOW!! Didn't care too much for the truffle fries. My husband's burger was very juicy and fresh taste like a homemade burger!! Good service!!

 I would have given this  business a 4.5 stars but a couple days later I read a review on yelp and saw a pic that someone else received their free birthday shake.

Trying to eat healthy often means leaving a restaurant unsatisfied, well for me anyway. But I really enjoyed my ""Shroomin' in Philly"" sandwich, sweet potato fries and hot-mame. I worried that the flavor of the mushrooms (especially if they were portobello) would be too much, but that wasn't the case at all. Really good and filling!

The hot-mame was sweet and slightly spicy. It came with a soy looking sauce on the side, but we didn't use it because they were great as is!

My hubby got the Burger Benedict, which was also really good (also obviously on the happy side). His side was truffle fries, but he wished the truffle flavor was more pronounced.

It was busy when we got there, but luckily we got the last table. If you've read my other reviews, you'll see I appreciate details, so one other thing I liked was their cool, reusable, dishwasher-safe cups. It has a ""happy meter"" on the side that shows how full it is. Oh and they had jalape√±o ketchup and balsamic ketchup on the table, which I've never seen before.

The location is a bit hard to find as it's right off a highway road and no clear signs for it besides a billboard that pops up suddenly. 

Loved the ambience and everything about the place. There are so many good eats on the menu - perfect place for brunch. Menu items are split between ""healthy"" (under 600 calories) and ""happy"" (over 600 calories). We ordered The GOAT (filet mignon, goat cheese, strawberries, infused pear, spinach), Applebottom Toast (cinnamon apples & strawberries over egg white multigrain French toast with soy cinnamon reduction & apple syrup), S'Motherload (filet mignon, egg, sausage, potatoes, peppers, onions, & pico in a tortilla with Cajun sauce), and The Green Mile (apple, kale, spinach, cucumber, celery). Total came to about $43. 

The Goat salad and The Green Mile balanced out the ""happy"" items out well. My favorite was absolutely the Applebottom Toast, but honestly you can't go wrong with any of the menu selections. Definitely somewhere I'd visit again if I were in the area.",W81O9S-6bovV62apUNHQvw,1,0,5,beyu0EfhuNZNu2mU_Oxk9Q
2082559,2018-04-07,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,I found this place on yelp because the breakfast options at Excalibur hotel aren't great. It's a cool hip looking place on the inside. The coffee was good and the price was right. My wife had the chicken waffles and my daughter had pancakes or waffles I don't remember. They both liked their food. I didn't see any vegan options so I ordered the zucchini pasta dish and it was great (not sure other people would enjoy it for breakfast but I did). It would be nice to see some vegan options for breakfast...something like a tofu scramble breakfast burrito and also make a vegan option for the avocado toast.,skcZUYKk4TJ27UXhMfXAdA,0,0,4,a2NIduuLoOQonyehZr7Wzw
2084441,2015-02-20,3,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Skinny Fats has one of the BEST veggie sandwiches I have ever had. I was lucky to be able to have lunch with fellow yelpers Jessie and Allison one weekday afternoon. This location is teeny tiny, but luckily Allison was a sweetheart and got there early to reserve us a table. So glad she did because this place has about 10 tables total, and they were all full. There was a line almost out the door, too. 

I had browsed the menu before hand, so I knew I wanted the Vegwich, which is described as portobello, avocado, cherry/banana peppers, spinach, tomato & horseradish yogurt on 9 grain toast w/side. I opted for sweet potato fries as my side and got the yogurt on the side as well. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie to go, as part of Yelp Shares the Love promotion that is going on. 

The sandwich was so good and so were the sweet potato fries. I didn't care for the horseradish yogurt and am glad I got it on the side. The sandwich was so flavorful it didn't even need a sauce. My dining partners both got the Slow Boat to China, which looked amazing, and one of them got the hummus plate which looked good as well. I will have to try both those items next time.

I just wish this place was larger. I am sure they have heard this a million times by now, and hopefully they will expand not just to another location, but something A LOT bigger. And yes, I am aware of the location on Warm Springs and while it is bigger, it is still pretty small. If Allison hadn't been there to get us a table, we wouldn't have had anywhere to sit and eat. I shouldn't have to worry about wether or not I will have somewhere to sit to eat my lunch. Regardless of that, I will come back, especially since it is only 8 minutes from my work. :)

2091058,2018-01-13,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I get upset when I order something super bad for me and it isn't good. Like when I ordered the ""Sweet Cheesus"" sandwich at SkinnyFATS, which could also be called ""Bad Philly Cheesesteak""-- I was expecting it to be awesome. Griddled beef and onions on a toasty roll smothered with cheese? How could that NOT be awesome? Well, somehow the masterminds at SkinnyFATS made it not awesome and then they did it again with the salad and my husband's sandwich and my friend's sandwich and my other friend's sandwich. Not sure why all the positive reviews. And while I'm being honest here, WTF IS UP WITH THE MENU?!? The menu item names are not clever, confusing AF and made it extraordinarily difficult to peruse as a hungover person trying to get TF outta Vegas. The ""Turnip Taco"" has not a trace of turnip, but rather filet mignon. ""TOMato Cruise"" is the name of the tomato soup? Why? Please TELL ME WHY because I've literally been thinking about it since I ate there like 3 months ago. Would you like to order the ""Chickhumm""? No, me neither because that sounds like a drunk person's idea of a name for a chicken and hummus sandwich. And it also sounds disgusting.

I was greeted with a smile and I felt bad for piling on a complicated order while there were tons of people behind me but she reassured me that it was okay and didn't seem to be phased by the order. We received our food and it was beyond spectacular. Everyone in my family was more than pleased with what they had. I ordered the Wake n' Bacon with cheddar cheese instead of pepper jack. I kid you not it got better with each bite, not like other foods that deprecate after some time. The avocado and sriracha cream cheese were great compliments to the sandwich. We were visited by workers every 10 minutes to make sure we were fine. The ambiance was great and the only negative was how crowded it was from everyone coming which lead to limited seating.

This was my first time here so the shorty with the nose ring over the counter recommended the burger with the egg. I added truffle fries for the ride along. You know Batman sometimes needs Robin but at the same time, he still the main dude ya'nahmean? The truffle fries are Robin. They good but they're not the main event, you understand? Anyway, they gave me the burger on a big ass tin plate that look like a sewer cap b. You know the ones the ninja turtles come out of? I saw mad yolk pourin' from the egg b, that shit look like watered down mustard when you first squeeze the bottle on your hotdog b and you get the bun kind of soggy. That's what that shit looked like b. I had to ask the dude for a steak knife so I can cut this big ass mondo burger in half, nahmean? I finally got my truffle fries after I split my burger that's why it's not in the picture. But when the fries came... I was like shit! How many potatoes y'all kill for that shit? But like I said they not the main event so I ain't pay em' no mind. I took a bite out the burger and surprisingly it wasn't soggy, that shit blew my mind, the burger stayed togetha but mad yolk got on my hands b. I used like 60 napkins but they keep a box right next to you, nahmean? It's like they knew I was gon get the egg b, like they saw me come in and was like ""look at this cat, he bout to get the egg."" Moving forward, you know I finished my burger, ate all my truffle fries, got my lemonade refill b and overall I was satisfied with the meal. But I can't give it the ultimate cheeseburger stamp because you know frankly it was pretty good but who ain't thought to put an egg in their burger before, nahmean? The name was clever but not as clever as the cheeseburger itself you know what I'm sayin'? Like son, the truffle fries was almost better than the main event. I would probably get this again tho if I was on a date and I wanted the shorty to be uninterested in me. It's a good date ender, you gotta eat kind of messy, be mad rude and shit nahmean?

The burger was the best part. The bread was some type of Hawaiian roll, or something, cause it made each bite that much better. The meat was cooked perfectly and the egg was a must. The sweet potato fries did not deny us any flavor. 

The buffalo tenders were a good addition. However, the fries it came with wasn't very appealing. I still cleaned the entire plate, and by the end, I was very full and satisfied. 

I had a cane soda, and it tasted a little different at first but unlimited refills helped me get use to the flavor. And a nice free water jug to the side kept me quenched throughout my meal.

Noticing this, we got permission from a kind man to put our number token down on his table as he and his family finished up their food. I was a little bit outraged when someone who'd ordered after us tried to sit down at that table immediately after the family left.

Food is alright. My boyfriend enjoyed his Chicka Wafa Dopolis, my mom and brother each got the Wake N Bacon, and I picked out the Cluck Moo. I wish I'd looked for actual photos first, since I would've picked something else. It was good but I preferred the Wake N Bacon's flavor profile. Cluck Moo is very standard breakfast fare, nothing terribly unique about it.

We also shared the Balls 2.0 - which I didn't realize were literally the number of risotto balls... They were quite tasty though! I'd get that one again for sure.

Anyway, back to the ahi tacos. Ordered two cause I was hungry and greedy. Took a bite out of it, it wasn't all that. It was alright. It had coleslaw like salsa and of course ahi.

For my fries, I asked if they could put feta cheese on it. I tried to make it Greek-y.

He was able to get our order finally at 1:08pm (almost 20 minutes after the scheduled pickup time).

I have been procrastinating this review for months.  This is definitely a hidden gem that I make a point to introduce to my tourist friends.  Great selection of deliciousness . Can't wait until the new location opens on Durango.

Space is limited but high turnover of tables.  It was probably not a good idea that I came with 8 people once but it was manageable.  Dylan was awesome at accommodating us, or was it Dillon? I get them confused.  Everyone on the staff is very welcoming though.  

Hands down, my favorite is the Chix on Broadway - chicken sandwich with great flavors and BACON!!! yum.  Chicken is perfectly moist and juicy.  Comes with a side, I usually get the truffle fries.  Even their ketchup is amazing: choice of regular, jalapeno or balsamic vinegar.

Want something more breakfasty? Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis is a great alternative to the Chix on Broadway.  Same juicy fried chicken tenders but served on a buttermilk waffle.

I usually order ""Orange you happy"" as my beverage - I order it with ice cream but for the health conscious, you have the option of adding frozen yogurt.  Cold pressed juices are available and delicious but usually ""too healthy"" for me.  I've tried the Hangover Remedy, Mr.Green and Liquid Defense.

I tend to hover on the ""happy side"" of the menu, I call it the ""fatty side"" but I've ventured to the ""healthy side."" Slow Boat to China's has a great presentation.  Asian chicken salad served on a cucumber ""boat"".  Ahi Srirachi Taco is good but I preferable it's evil twin Ahi Taco-San, served on a puffed shell.  FYI, one taco is nicely sized.

Other faves: Drunken Monkey Cakes, REDiculous (red velvet waffle), Bomb Diggity (BLT), Protein Pancakes

I walked in at noon, not expecting much of a crowd based on the location, to find the lunch rush in full swing. The interior design is very vibrant, with fun painted walls and many unique touches. After reading over the many enticing menu options, I was ready to place my order at the counter. I went with the Skinny Bowl with a side of fat in the form of truffle fries. It was a perfect combo.

Both items were delivered to my table after a few minutes. The Skinny Bowl was the best acai bowl I've ever tasted, with granola, strawberries, bananas, dried cranberries, and agave syrup. The acai was a soft sorbet texture that had a nice, light citrus flavor to it. I've had this item at other places and felt like it was blended with too much banana, or had too much of a baby food texture. My daughter loved this acai bowl, too.


The truffle fries looked pretty ordinary, but they had great flavor. I'd never seen Heinz Balsamic Ketchup before, so that was a nice touch on my table. I was too distracted by the delicious food in front of me (and keeping my 11 month old entertained) to even realize that the long-haired man pictured on the Skinnyfats menu eating a burger was seated at a table just to my right, wearing the same purple Abraham Lincoln t-shirt featured in his photo.

The restaurant is on the smaller side; it has about 6 tables (Variety of 2/4 seaters). It also has one long table with 9 high chairs. You order and pay first then get your food brought out to you after taking a number.

As the name suggest; the left side of the menu is Healthy and the right side isn't :). For every regular dish; there's the same dish with a healthy twist on the left side. I ordered the Ahi-Tuna taco and the ""Cherry Popper"". Might I add very good way to pop your SkinnyFATS cherry :P. Burger was cooked to perfection; love when a restaurant throws an egg in a burger to bring it all together. 

We went at 7PM on a Wednesday but it picked right up around 8 and many people didn't find seats. It's a small place but it's worth waiting around for a table to free up or taking it to go. The food is phenomenal and for the price you really can't beat it. To put the cherry on top; Kathryn A (working the register that's what the slip says :P) made my first experience great.

Half of us old timers where I was in the half of first timer. I never even heard of this place without help of  my yelp family. Its gotten lot of buzz hear people talking about SkinnyFats. I excited about checking the hype. 

Talk about interesting location. I totally wrong turned it  so had too big circle loop back along way notice that nothing around it at all. If looking for restaurant never find it. It located in more of small retail business office area rather then free standing restaurant. Make sure going down Dean Martin Drive keep your eye out for the big happy smile face. Once you do find it realize SkinnyFats is diamond in the rough. 

Never think such small office space that they could be putting out amazing Healthy or Happy side meals. They truly do!!! I was surprise by the selection too choose from since such tiny place. Really only hold less then fifty seats. We all meet up at craziest time lunch prime time. Literally if not for Mel and Terri showing up before or around 11am never got seat. Noon the place is ridiculous. The line out the door and good luck finding place too sit down. There reason why the place is packed really good food.

I went with the Phatty Philly. Amazing. I love the fact nice thick slices of meat not your typical philly style sandwich. Even the portobello mushrooms (perfectly roasted and well seasoned) nice thick slices. The goat cheese and the onions. Sure missing two more ingredients. It had lot of things going on inside but the BEST part was everything balanced each other too perfection. Every bite was awesome. The bread that the served on was great! Not sure if cause Happy side but my order came with side. I went with the truffle fries. I thought was solid. I love the condiments that each table came with especially the salt shaker. Flavor ketchup swear that was first for me. Balsamic or Jalapeno flavored ketchup. Interesting. I never tried either but next visit taste them with some fries.

2311429,2018-01-03,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Wow! We were searching for an interesting and fun breakfast spot near the strip when we found this place. It is set in an unassuming office/industrial area across the highway from the strip but you can't miss the billboard!

The interior is done up in dark repurposed wood with a cozy, welcoming feel. The seating area features tables and counter space, we didn't have a problem finding seating even when they were pretty busy, though ymmv.

""Happy"" and ""healthy"" headings on the menu add a little fun, but even the healthy options seemed pretty good! I tried options from both sides and was pleased - but the scrambled egg Mac and cheese (""Morning Mac"") really scratched my comfort food itch! I also enjoyed the ""Wrap Superstar"" chicken, spinach & egg white breakfast burrito from the healthy side. Flavorful AND healthy? I'll take it! 

We made several visits during our 6 day stay - it was just that good. The staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely worth checking out whether you're finishing up a looooong night or starting you're day fresh!",1j7zXcfGyHM5XfM-xa4LEg,5,3,4,miAr93pV2VVTH_6NGhtxuA

Anyway, the space is small but I didn't mind, I was getting my food to go. 
The menu is split between ""Healthy"" & ""Happy"" (or unhealthy) side, I stared at the menu for about 10 minutes and decided on the ""Healthy Side"" 
I settled on the
TBLT- Turkey Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato. with a spicy aioli spread on grain toast
also had Truffle fries
I wasn't down to pay $7 for a smoothie this day but maybe another day I will. 
My sandwich was pretty good, a little dry, but I like my sammich with a little extra spread than what most people like. I guess if you want Healthy though you have to watch your serving size. As for my truffle fries, they were decent. My favorite still comes from BurGR.

2323020,2014-04-15,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFats offers exactly what their name suggests, food options that are either healthy or happy (comfort food). When I 1st pulled into the parking lot I noticed that their location is a little odd and hard to find since it's located inside a business complex with no signage except for the sign above their front door. It was a Sunday just after noon and it was packed inside with no available tables and we had a group of 7 Yelpers. We looked over the menu and placed all of our orders when a couple tables freed up so we snagged them up.

Be aware that the food here comes in large portions! The wedge salad that Nelson Q got looked like it was made with an entire stalk of Romaine lettuce, it was huge! And the chicken sandwich that Amelinda L was eating had a piece of chicken that was larger than the buns/everything else on the sandwich! I got the chicken and waffles which is on their secret menu that you have to ask for... I'm not sure if there's an acutal menu or if you just have to know what's on it. I only knew about the chicken and waffles because I saw a bunch of people eating it. The chicken was nice, tender and their breading was light and not too crunchy/hard. I liked that there was more chicken than waffle, unlike other places that skimp on the chicken part so I was pretty happy. I didn't try any of their shakes or juices, but the strawberry lemonade was awesome! Light, refreshing and not too sweet. I also loved the reusable cups complete w/ happy meter!

I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes, especially the healthy ones. If you come here during one of the meal rushes be prepared to order take out or wait for a table since they don't have very many and it's not a big place to begin with. Maybe they will expand someday to relieve some of the traffic here, and hopefully that new location is closer to me!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,3,4,_ezyP32ciLPKuSU-NdVgbA
2324580,2017-10-26,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Wow, was I impressed by this place. For me this is heaven. I can eat here without feeling deprived. I decided to eat skinny and my finance fat. Good compromise if you ask me. 

Healthy or fat? Pick your poison. Warning, both are delicious and generous portions. 

Scrambled burrito with egg whites, chicken, spinach, avocado and pico. Yum! It was a huge size. I could barely finish it. As I took each bite my taste buds never felt as if they were getting cheated. 

We decided to try the skinny ahi tuna taco and the shrimp taco. The tuna one was gross. The soft shell was just that, soft. Actually I would say it was soggy. Everything just melted together. There was no crunch. The shrimp taco was way better tasting. However like the previous taco. this one was a fat choice. It was a bummer we had to eat it with a fork as it fell apart and was unable to be eaten. Boo. Tacos are  to be eaten with hands!

My fianc√©'s entree choice was another fat option. The fried jalape√±o steak sandwich with French fries. My soon to be hubby is infatuated with spicy but boy did this bring tears to his eyes. Usually his asks for extra hot, add salsa and to kick it up a notch. Not this time ladies and gentlemen! He was peeling it open and trying to take out the jalape√±os. Guess there's a first time for everything.

2324732,2017-11-23,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"We tried again, this time a couple days before thanksgiving and on a weekday lunchtime. Compared to the first time, the line was sane and the scene was chill - not like the mob scene we encountered last time. It worked well in our favor, along with the fact that we researched and decided on what we wanted among their extensive menu beforehand - last time we felt a lot of pressure due to the long line behind us and each menu item having lots of different ingredients to understand. So do your homework first!

We managed to get a table and polite and fast service! Among the smoothie juices, we tried the hangover remedy, garden treat, and delightful cucumber. They were all good. If you expect Jamba juice amount of sweetness, no - it's a more adult version with beets and cucumbers that are not so sweet. For our entrees, the More Cowbell, Meltdown, Smoke in a bowl, and Hot Chix. Hot Chix was spicy! with the fried jalapenos...I really liked it, and a good value for $10. Smoke in a bowl was a bit weird for us and it actually tasted better as next day's leftovers. More Cowbell was a favorite with high quality beef and lots of veggies. The Meltdown was just that - a big honkin' patty melt that made for 2 meals. A little on the greasy side, but that's the point. Our toddler fell asleep on the way so she missed her meal until later that night. The children's meals were good value and for the chicken, offered grilled. Compare their 4.95 chicken meal to Chik-Fil-A and it was a good deal. 

I had thought they were going to expand the restaurant but it's still pretty tiny. So if you hit it on a busy day, which I imagine is very often, it can be overwhelming.",ImVfDOri1NG5UE5MEmqHJg,0,0,4,NzsBw6TmyByMQX8-zR94hQ

It's probably my least favorite set up of ordering food that could exist. I don't know about the other locations, but you go up to the counter to order, and they give you a number. You then find a seat, and they bring your food out. This entire space is extremely small too. They can maybe fit 25 people in actual seats. It was not busy when we went, and we had to sit at bar seating which looks out the window to the airport. It was fun watching the planes while I ate, at least. It wouldn't keep me from coming back, but like I said it it's my least favorite way a food joint can be set up and I wish it were bigger. 

That all said, OMG THAT FOOD THOUGH. I liked everything I had except for the Ahi Taco.  Nothing about it was bad; it just didn't fit my particular palate. I didn't like how thick and strong the tortilla part tasted, I thought it covered up the flavor inside a bit. 

The Slow Boat to China and Blue Balsamic salad were superb, and Balls 2.0 were absolutely necessary!! I wish it were four smaller balls instead of two big ones, just for ease of eating, but it was so good. I got their diet soda, and I prefer Coke/Pepsi to their own brand, but it wasn't bad. 

I know this review sounds mostly bad, but believe me, it isn't. It's just easy to pick out the little problems when a place is so popular. The food is worth it. If you haven't had SkinnyFATS, you have to go! Also, it is a pokestop. Some players that were not us set up some lures while we were there and we got some cool Pokemon while we ate due to that so - pretty decent experience.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,1,1,4,-bTMcMXbzzxJcbthrahodw

I got the Chix on Broadway (fried chicken and bacon sandwich with lettuce, tomato, onion and special sauce) with a side of truffle fries because it came highly recommended here on Yelp. Upon biting into the sandwich, I noticed that the chicken was almost burnt and the whole thing was pretty lacking in flavor. I'm not sure if they just forgot to add salt to the chicken/breading or if it's always like that, but even my boyfriend agreed that it was surprisingly bland.

On my first impression coming here, the setting is very unique ala Carson Kitchen (Downtown LV). This location is located in a small plaza area which is kinda hard to find. Their menu is divided into healthy items and ""happy"" items.  

The Berry Strong Waffle was ok tasting. The waffle was honestly a bit hard and the mint in the yogurt sauce was a little strong. The 2 cranturkey patties that came with it were not good. They were super dry. My wife liked her Chickhumm sandwich and she gave it a 9/10. I got the classic burger which was good. When I had to remind the waiter that she forgot my shake, they upgraded me to a large size which was nice. Their shake was pretty thick; so thick that 4 or 5 sips will make you feeling quite full.

First of all, the name SkinnyFATS is adorable and really represents what this restaurant is all about. This restaurant is perfect for those with conflicting friends that 1. want to eat healthy 2. want to pig out. It caters to both which is awesome!

Located at a really random and isolated area but it was easy to find. From the outside it may look like a huge place but inside is quite tiny and has limited seating. They have some tables and a bar like area by the window. It's first come first serve seating so you might want to have a friend grab a table while you order. The atmosphere and decor of this place is so chill and cute! Very woodsy but also artsy as well. The service here is amazing! The workers are friendly and they give great recommendations. 

They offer what they consider 'happy' and 'healthy' food on their menu so you have the option of going for either. They have an extensive menu with lots of options to choose from. I wanted something light for dinner so I ordered:

--Ahi Srirachi: It's seared ahi in a whole wheat soft taco with some slaw, mango, pico, and spicy yogurt aioli. The price is per taco and I ordered two tacos. I was going to order three but the girl advised that it may be too much so I listened to her. Two tacos was the perfect amount for me. This was so delicious it made my mouth water after the first bite. The ahi was fresh and the sauces and garnishes for the tacos made them the best ahi tacos I've ever tried. The mangoes were a nice touch as well.

You ever eat something and the entire time you're thinking ""OhMyGodOhMyGodOhMyGod?"" That's what happened to me tonight. I had the TBLT with avocado and truffle fries. First, the sandwich. A subtle aioli spread beautifully complemented the fresh, multi-grain bread. The turkey bacon was cooked to perfection. The whole thing melted into my mouth, a cacophony of fresh, aromatic flavors. The french fries, good Lord, the fries. Best.Fries.Ever. Their scent alone made me swoon. Over and over, I'd hold the fry below my nose a few seconds, just to inhale it. Its scent was strong, nutty yet earthy. The consistency, light, a bit chewy with just enough crunch. I ate this meal like I've not known food before. Maybe I haven't. And I'm speaking as someone who at one time was well off enough to dine often in 5 star joints (things change, recession, blah blah).

Ordering online is simple, the packaging is premium, delivery is quick, and above all the food is a better choice and delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed the neato burrito and can't wait to try the waffle mountain high.

Their small interior is a mix of cozy with modern, an compliments their equally unique menu which is split between as the name implies: a healthier ""skinny"" and more unhealthier ""fat"" side. A lot of their items are uniquely different from the next ranging from their ahi-cucumber boat, beet apple and ginger smoothie, to their truffle fries.

2428498,2017-07-10,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"After my initial review I was contacted by a manager who offered for me to come back to the restaurant and try a few items on the house. While I was there I also tried a few things at my expense. We ordered the Greek flatbread, the Sweet Chesus, the shrimp tacos, and the salted caramel cookie. The Greek flatbread (Nice to Greek you) had grilled chicken, olives, feta, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, tzatziki, & balsamic glaze on a flat bread. It was 505 calories and I got it from the healthy side of the menu. For something that was supposed to be ""healthier"" it was pretty decent. My only complaint is that it had TOO much balsamic on it and I didn't see the point of the giant chunks of cherry tomato. Perhaps it would have tasted better and I could have finished in the restaurant, if the tomatoes had been thinly sliced and there had been less vinegar because it was SO bitter. On a scale one to ten the flatbread scored a 6. I probably wouldn't order it again to be honest. 
The next thing I ordered was the Sweet chesus which is skinnyfats take on a philly cheese steak. It's made with shaved ny steak, pepper marmalade, onions, pepper jack cheese, portobello, cheddar sauce on a hoagie. This was one of the best philly cheese steaks I've ever had. The meat was tender and the bread was soft. I'll definitely eat it the next time I return. (8/10)
skinnyfats offers two tacos for 7.95 which I thought was pretty good deal for a sit down restaurant and You can mix and match! I chose two shrimp taco-dillas: tempura,spicy slaw, pico, chipotle aioli, pepper jack cheese, in a quesadilla shell. Let me tell you, these were the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. The combination of the slaw and chipotle sauce made it sweet, salty, and spicy. So far these tacos are my favorite thing to eat on the menu and if I could eat them everyday I would. These tacos were absolutely AMAZING. (10/10)
Lastly I had a salted caramel cookie and my mom who isn't a huge fan of sugar took one bite and fell in love. She said this was the best cookie she's ever had. The cookie could be described as how it taste to eat a really good slice of cake. All that was missing was some vanilla ice cream. Go order one of these cookies. You won't regret it! (10/10!) 
All in all, this was an epic experience and I'm renewed as far as my thoughts about this place goes. Great customer service and great food. I cannot wait to come back and try the other food. SkinnyFats is a place you go if you're not afraid of flavor. Oh and the free wAter (so freshing) is a bonus! One of the best places in Vegas to eat.

I ordered one of their daily specials: a delicious creamy pasta with shrimp and scallops. Didn't expect the pasta to turn out so good! But it was cooked to perfection. The server even let me add garlic toast on the side to compliment my dish.

I love how they have both #livehealthy and #livehappy options on the menu. Definitely went for the happy side, but I'd love to try something healthier next time. My brother ordered a breakfast dish with chicken fried steak and eggs - it was scrumptious as well!

I'm only visiting Vegas, but everything on the menu sounded great so I'll have to come back to try more. A great spot for lunch.

A few things to note:

Current location is small, if you're coming with a group I recommend that someone in the party arrive early to steak out a table. 

Mobile App - They do have a mobile app that you can use to order ahead and miss the lines that can quickly grow.  However viewing the menu in person is a huge treat in of itself. 

Food - The food is very creative, and weekly they have new specials, they are usually posted in a glass holder on the edge of the counter.  Try these out as they may not return!

The staff is so friendly and nice. The restaurant industry should pay the management here for some training.

A must see, must eat place in Las Vegas.

But this review isn't just about location or the way the building looks or the people. It's about the food too. The food is great definitely healthy even the drinks although most of the drinks we got aren't sweet because they're very based on the healthy part like the punch we got was sour and the teas aren't sweet so if you want it sweet you'll have to ask for sugar. The food was healthy they definitely have all the food category in it but it's SUPER oily or buttery. Just know you'll feel healthy and full but also like you just drank a cup of oil/butter. Use lots of napkins. Over all I feel like it's a one hit wonder to me. I guess I was just expecting it to be less oily/buttery.",-z1kmlhXzKqJ9zfUxyVz6w,0,0,4,MVhwcoi0PRRApQYHSSfulA

2509114,2014-12-08,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"This is a true 5 star restaurant, start to finish.

I ate here for the first time several months ago and was really impressed. A lot has changed in the time since my first visit. My wife and I decided that we needed a major lifestyle change, we needed to be more conscious about the foods we were eating, needed to eat out less, and just start living healthier. In a perfect world you make breakfast, lunch, and dinner at home, you never eat or drink bad, you are in peak physical condition, and you live to 110. That's a perfect world. Now reality. It's fun to eat out, cooking schmooking, exercising schmexercising, you know how it goes. I'm happy to say that we've changed a lot in our lives from an eating standpoint that's really helped.

So where does Skinnyfats fit into this? Well they fit perfectly because of the incredible healthy options they have. During some holiday shopping we needed to find a place to grab dinner and wanted to be health-concious about our decision. Skinnyfats was the perfect choice. I went with the Wrap Supastar and it was absolutely awesome. Fluffy egg whites, avocado, chicken, pico de gallo, and spinach in a delicious wheat wrap and topped with a lime/cilantro yogurt dressing and some additional pico de gallo. It's honestly hard to believe that this was healthy. The portion since was huge. My wife went with the Vegwich. I'm not much of a mushroom man, but she said it was absolutely awesome. Unfortunately I didn't grab a picture of it, but that was also really big and was accompanied with a side.

**Confession** on my first trip here I had a chocolate banana milk shake. On this second trip I had a chocolate banana milk shake. It was a weak, but totally worth it moment. I don't know how they are able to perfectly incorporate the banana into the milk shake, but they absolutely do. No banana chunks, so smooth and amazing tasting. They have a wide array of shake options, definitely check it out if you' feel like ""living happy."" 

The location is kind of hidden on Dean Martin. It would be super easy to drive by and never notice. I think that adds to the coolness of the restaurant. Service is always dynamite.

Below are photos of a few things I've gotten. I always post about them on Instagram and give them shoutouts. I love bringing people here for the first time.

The naked chix had good flavors but the brown rice was definitely undercooked. If Chipotle brown rice was a 10, this would this would be a 5. 

The applebottom toast had amazing flavors and the toast was very soft. If you like cinnamon, you need to try this

The more cow bowl was like stir fry in my opinion but tasted amazing! My dad really enjoyed it and I thought it had a great combination of flavors

The sweet brown pancakes were you're normal sweet pancakes and it's extremely filling. We had to share it amongst us 4. 

Lastly, because my mom lovvesss fries, we had to get the truffle fries. And she LOVED it. Definitely get some because they gave a very shareable portion and what can go wrong with truffles?

The concept is great - both a healthy and less healthy option of he same dish. Location: it's definitely off any main drag, but if you're wanting to get away from strip life, it's great. Parking: not a lot. It's in an industrial area so there's a lot of other businesses that share the same space. It's a tiny place so very limited seating. It's great when there's a line out the door, not so great when everyone wants to sit down and eat. You order at the front and they bring the food out to you (if you can find a seat). Food: great premise, meh execution. Could be what I ordered but this place was nothing to write home about. Pretty bland flavor and relatively small portions to cost. While those with food allergies could navigate, I worry about cross contamination and even just what modifications to make it ok to eat and tasty.

Picked up lunch here straight from the airport.  Co-worker ate a bean burger and enjoyed it. I ordered the STEAKation sandwich with arugula and horseradish.  Was it the best steak sandwich I have ever eaten? NO.  Was it good? Yes, but I will likely try something else on the menu next time - like the turkey sandwich that originally caught my eye.  I was trying to be healthy but ate all of my fries because the house made bottled spicy ketchup was SO GOOD.  And, I don't even like ketchup. 

There's just a few tables in a very tight space and the restaurant fills up quickly - so timing is everything here, because let's be honest....no one is sitting outside to eat in the 100+ temps no matter how ice cold the water is.

We came in around lunch time and line was practically out the door. For our visit we had the Caulifire, Naked Chix, Tomato Cruise, Liquid Defense, Smoke in Bowl, and the Thai Cobb. Each one delicious!! I definitely loved the Caulifire and the Naked Chix. The mango sauce with the chicken was delicious and I appreciated that they served fresh and healthy ingredients. Also, I loved that they served fresh juices and smoothies! The kids also loved the see-thru cups that they served the drinks in and were very entertained by the comments!

When I finally found this place nestled in the middle of a non-descript business center located down the street from the Hustler strip club, I happily jumped out of my rental car and headed inside.

I found the uniqueness of this place appealing.  You can either order unhealthy food or healthy food.  The healthy side also had juice blends to choose from so I was very excited to get a juice with a meal of boneless wings and fries.  Now that's a win win!

The place is quite small inside with barely any seating during a packed lunch hour.  From the looks of it, there were no men working the front counter which as a guy, I'm not complaining...I wish that happened way more often!  Most of them were friendly and working hard pumping out orders to hungry seated diners.

My meal was decent and I enjoyed my juice blend of ginger, orange, lemon, and some other stuff I don't remember.  It's really not that hard to be healthy in Vegas on vacation as long as you know where to go.  If this place sticks around long enough, then I'll make sure to come back here for another healthy/unhealthy combo meal.",V5Th21KjUiYLJQyV-vGtpg,2,2,4,RJcfN0PvHc6y6vCM3gIgDQ

I ordered the hot chic salad and it was very good, and at a reasonable price, too!

From the picture shown, the toppings are not mixed in, but cornered off, so mix it the way you want.

The best part was of course the chicken, and next time, I'd definitely just order that -- and without the greens.

2590198,2018-01-15,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"A great breakfast place off the hectic strip!

I've had this place bookmarked for like forever, but never had the time to go. Finally I had the chance to go with my family for our first breakfast back from a very long trip.

We went on Martin Luther King Jr. Day (Monday) around 10am and they weren't like super busy, but still lots of people. Didn't know that this place would be this small, they only had like 4 tables for 4 people, some more for only 2 people, and then a few seats facing the window. So if you have more than 4 people with you, it may be kind of hard to fit everyone in. The location is rather odd, in the industrial/business area..don't think I've ever seen or been to a restaurant in a building like it. 

The idea of a healthy side of the menu and a ""happy"" side was really nice. Plus, they also have a secret menu! The prices are on the ok side contrast to other typical breakfast/brunch places. 

So, me and my brother got something off the secret menu: Sunday Sundae and the REDlicious. The rest of us got he Cherry Popper and the Smotherload.

First of all, I actually didn't know what I ordered was a dessert. I found out when the employee asked if they should serve mine with everyone else's or afterwards. I was certain mine was a dessert when I saw the portion of my dish, pretty small. However, it tasted DELISH and the portion was perfect for me, because I was planning on sharing with my mom between two dishes. The Smotherload was also perf, the portion was just enough. Cherry Popper tasted good too and the side of Truffle Fries was amazing!

Overall, I liked it and would come back again :)

After a lil wait, I was presented with my mini feast. The burrito was plentiful the wings were crispy the sauce was just tingly enough to give my taste buds a lil burn but not melt them.

The waiter and other people helping out were fantastic, friendly, interested, and even burned our bacon so it had the crispy flavor that my wife loves!  To be clear, the bacon was cooked fine the first time, my wife just prefers the more crispy bacon! :-)

So the concept here is simple one side if the menu is healthy one side isn't. I ate of the skinny and it was so good. I had the fruit waffle with the juice based maple syrup. It was so good the waffle was fluffy but tasty. It's wasn't too sweet just right orange sweetness. It came with a turkey bacon which was a thick cut and was really tasty. It reminded me of a bacon/sausage mix. The coffee was basic cafe coffee but really good. The service was different you go to the counter and offer and then you sit down at a table and the foods was brought out to you.

2670967,2017-05-29,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Really glad I decided last minute to come to this place! Love the food here. First off, the location is a bit tricky as it is part of a large business complex. Luckily they have a huge billboard sign pointing down to where it is when I drove by it. The outside of the building itself is very unassuming as there are no signs and can easily be missed if you aren't looking. The place is fairly small and consists of maybe 8-10 tables with some counter seating as well. You order food at the counter, they give you a number, and find a spot to sit and they bring the food to you once ready.

Chix on Broadway with side of truffle fries - 4/5 - BLT with a huge piece of fried chicken with a lemon aioli on a brioche bun - love this sandwich as it was full of flavor and the crunch from the bacon and especially the chicken was amazing. The truffle fries 
Ahi Taco San Taco - 4/5 -  huge piece of fried Ahi with their special slaw, pico, and sauce - can be a bit messy but delicious!
Turnip Taco - 5/5 - filet mignon with pico and their habanero lime cream sauce - has a pretty decent kick that lingers - my favorite taco out of the two I tried, definitely must-try
Salted Caramel Cookie - 5/5 - amazing cookie! Loved this so much and wish I had bought more. It's not overly sweet and has the perfect chewiness with a slight crunch I think a cookie should have. Highly recommend their cookies!

They also make their own sodas using sugar cane which was really tasty. Not super carbonated and had their own unique flavor which I enjoyed very much. Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing! My go to drink every time I come here now. Overall, I enjoyed everything I tried here and didn't feel disgusting after eating so that's always a plus!",boa781xF-EX7TJIsVg55mQ,1,1,5,M6satbNgr2y2gbvUb9-3YA

Great place to enjoy with friends since it's customizable to everyone.  I had the Turkey BLT - OMG out of this world. It was a ""skinny"" that tasted like a ""fat"" item ...it was that good. Not going to lie I was a little concerned that a skinny item could taste so good.

2672492,2014-07-17,3,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"The concept of this place is a dream to me! To be able to find various healthy menu items while my family is still able to indulge. The struggle of staying healthy is real! We came on a Monday at 2PM. I figured it would be slow but boy were we wrong. There were no tables at the time, and the line was wrapped around the bar (which seems to be common) but people ate quickly and cleared out so we were able to grab a 4 top. From the photos of the food, I had no idea it was an order at the counter sort of place, but probably wonderful for the many people who made to-go orders that work nearby. 

After reviewing their menu and it being (unfortunately) too late to eat breakfast, I opted for the slow boat to China and sriricha ahi taco. My husband got the cherry popper burger with truffle fries and ordered the veg-to-bowl and yummus for the kids. They have a children's menu which was very disappointing... I get that in America, we're used to shoving garbage down our kids throat and pray they don't get type II diabetes by the time they're 25, but come on. At a place like this, I was hoping for a healthier kids menu than chicken fingers, peanut butter and jelly, & PB & banana. 

The food arrived not too long after and we dug in. The kids LOVED the yummus with pita. I was really surprised how much they liked it since the rosemary was so potent in it that it turned off my husband. They also really enjoyed the vegetable bowl with tofu and a plethora of veggies. The portobello fried rice was dreamy. Definite thumbs up for the veg-to-bowl even though it's on the happy side. My husband really enjoyed his burger, but had the exact same complaints as Jade. He picked it up, took a bite, and told me that he is scared to put the thing down because it will definitely fall apart next time he picks it up. His plate looked like a plate of soup by the time he was done and said he would ask them to toast the bun more next time and apply less sauce. 

My sriricha ahi taco and slow boat were alright. I think they use too much sauce here with their aiolis being at the front of the menu. There was definitely too much aioli and sauce in general on my slow boat.  I could barely taste the ingredients. The tuna in my ahi taco were mediocre at best with them being rubbery along with the tortilla. The slawchee in it was delicious and the flavors in the taco were great. I just wish the tuna was less rubbery. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the results. While we are indeed sauce lovers, we will have to ask for less sauce on everything next time so we can really taste the ingredients.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,4,3,3,DQ1cjBWQi7duJEP-fEVyHw

Steak eyes (like country fried steak) (4/5) pretty tasty.

Very small restaurant.  Counter service.  But they were pretty accommodating for our party of 8.  They put some tables together for us.

Especially the one female with dark hair.  she was really great.

From the restaurant space to the server ware, there is a meticulous attention to detail that achieves the perfect balance of trying (but not too hard) to please you.  The restaurant space is tiny, so be prepared to wait during rush hours, but what they did to that cookie cutter commercial place, and the menu, and little things like the salt and pepper man turns my heart into a fuzzy kaleidoscope hippie.  

Flaxseed Fans or Rebels can choose items from either their ""Skinny"" menu or their ""Happy"" menu (I'm really pleased they didn't call that Fat.  We are not fat.  We are big boned and Happy, thank you very much).  These are your typical diner menu items served with a modern twist, alongside fancy, healthy fusion grub.  There's something to please everyone.  Hubby had the Eggs Benedict burger which he was happy with.  Lil man had the Buf Chix (sauce on the side) and a fruit bowl which was pretty standard.  And I had the Cobb Salad because I was nursing a hangover.  Good stuff.  Totally can relate to the sad face on the happy meter when our root beer floats were almost empty.  

Service at the counter was pretty slow (dunno if the crew is new), but they were extremely accommodating.  Re-did my son's order when I expressed that I wish the sauce was on the side.

I ordered the Ahi Tacos, which came with 3, and it was pretty good. HOWEVER....if you're not a big fan of eating raw stuff or the TEXTURE of it, considered yourself warning. 
Don't get me wrong, these tacos were DELICIOUS....but I can only handle so much raw texture in my mouth =/ After one and a half tacos, the slimy feeling became too much for me to handle. I'm not big on sushi anyways so this was like going out of my element. I was still able to finish all three of my tacos though so that's really saying how delicious they were.

I really appreciated and enjoyed the fruit/vegetable infused iced water.

2698589,2015-06-11,5,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"In the dessert of Las Vegas we felt famished for healthy food. We've watched enough food documentaries on Netflix to scare the s- out of us making it hard to stomach sugar, salt, GMOs, and a everything else that is said to give us cancer. It just doesn't taste right anymore. What can I say? Fear does something to your taste buds.

So out of desperation we paid over $10 for a cab to take us three miles to SkinnyFats. And the cab driver questioned us. He pulled up to a nondescript strip on the side of the highway. It looked like a row of offices - maybe even call centers. He was like, ""Are you sure this is it?"" He even went in with us and took a menu to make sure it was a legit restaurant! On our second trip (because we sure went back) the cab driver gave us his cell number so that we could have a ride back. No taxis were going by that joint. SkinnyFATS was for locals with cars and not tourists like us.

Both times we went we got freshly pressed juice in reusable cups. YUM. It was like home and we loved it after the sodium-saturated, MSG ridden stuff we'd been suckered into eating with our friends.

The food was scrumptious. The menu is divided into two sections. First, the skinny. That's all about healthy food. The other part is the fat which isn't quite as healthy. So, you can have chicken and waffles with a grilled chicken breast or chicken and waffles with fried chicken. Get it? Brilliant.

Heck! We loved SkinnyFATS so much that plan to incorporate it into our next trip. We're going to the Grand Canyon and have to fly into Vegas. We were thrilled to realize that we could go to SkinnyFATS before our three hour drive to the canyon and then again when we come back!

I was late somewhere and so was the other custumer but having already paid, all I could do is wait. The other custumer got really upset and kept asking about her order as I sat and waited and waited. Aparently dine in custumers got their food before togo custumers and had a higher priority?! What, come on now. I was excited about the food but after the wait some parts came out cold and not even looking good. Like the red velvet waffle looks so nice on the pix, but togo it was a mess in a pizza box that I had to spend another 5mins arranging for myself. The other food items were pretty mediocre and overpriced. Portions are a big size however. The juice was cold pressed and they were not sure how to explain that it wasnt really fresh squeezed, but still 9$. Paid almost 50$ for the food(being cold and bad presentation) and really disappointed with the wait time, price and quality overall.

The location is in a very odd industrial area that many people would overlook if they did not know this great restaurant existed here.  The space itself is very tiny and has seating for 40 people tops so it always feels busy inside. 

The menu has a Jekyll and Hyde feel to because you have some items that appear very healthy and some that appear gluttonous.  No worries I will pick the latter every time.  

I selected the ""Chix on Broadway"" with Truffle Fries.  This crispy fried chicken breast sandwich was a great portion.  I had to ask for some more lemon aioli to slather on but the crispy lettuce, tomato and bacon were the perfect topping trifecta.  My fires were a little under done but were still delicious.  

The ""Unbrierevable"" was another item selected that did not disappoint the taste buds.  The combination of strawberries, chocolate sauce, tender melted brie cheese and a crispy waffle were amazing.  The french inspired dish of gluttony definitely satisfied the taste buds. 

The one downfall about the location is the size.  I am sure that is why the Warm Spring's location is triple the size and has an outdoor patio.  We will be back when we are in the neighborhood.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,1,1,4,HPBZq_R_tC7WlcChiY24tw

2724947,2015-04-26,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"This is for their dean martin location.  Been here quite a few times.

The concept behind SkinnyFats is that they offer a menu of both things that could be considered healthy (skinny)  or happy (fat)... or both!  

This location is quite small with limited seating though and because of the popularity of this place, it's almost always packed.   However, once seated, the food is delicious, and many of my friends I've brought here all agree.

Just a few suggestions of foods, there's so much good stuff to try:

Tu-Nuts is to-die-for.   Spicy ahi tuna & sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki, avocado & sriracha aioli.  So refreshing and delicious yet you don't feel like you ate too much.  

REDiculous - Red velvet waffle, cream cheese frosting, berries & chocolate w/ applewood bacon - This is for those that just love dessert (who doesn't?)

Berry the Steak - Flatbread w/shaved NY strip, feta, goat cheese, arugula, blackberries & balsamic.  The variety of food here is so vast.  There's something for everyone. 

There has really been nothing I've ordered that wasn't really good.  Come with a few people and try and share a few things!  I guarantee it that you'll love all their offerings.

Tip:  On Sundays, they offer their always different Sunday Sundae.   Just look at the photos here on Yelp.  They are crazy, in a good way!

Tasty food and ok value. It seemed a little pricey for what you get, but the menu is so interesting that it's worth a stop to try something fun and outrageous.

I had a smoothie that was rich in kale and other good stuff along with a breakfast of tasty morsels which included pieces of filet mignon.

The reviews are accurate when reading others. It is pretty much what I've read at Yelp.

Excellent!  

My eldest sister, who seems to know all the right places to eat and where to go  in her hometown, tells me that we are having lunch at SkinnyFats. I roll my eyes because I incorrectly conjure up in my mind a so-hip it hurts trendy spot where the food is terrible and the service is awful. Boy, was I wrong. 

The food is EXCELLENT. I've been here twice now, and man, the food is EXCELLENT!  Coffee is strong. The small space and d√©cor... cool. Service is Xtra friendly.  And,the food is EXCELLENT! 

Be prepared to wait.   
The place can get very busy. 

So far, my favorite is the seared teriyaki tuna sandwich. Tender  tuna, greens with citrus sauce, fresh tomato slices & spinach, perfectly held together on toasted sesame-grain toast. EXCELLENT! The fries are good too.

I have got the happy option, with normal bacon, 2 or 3 times. The first time it was good the next two times I could barely finish it. This last time the bacon was mostly squishy fat.

2765656,2014-11-14,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"The name of this establishment is an oxymoron like Jumbo Shrimp, and Anaheim Ducks Hockey.  You can't be Skinny and Fat at the same time right?  Some guys are coming close!  The concept of this restaurant is very original.  Create two distinct menus that appeals to foodies of all types.  The health conscious and the zero f***ks given camp.  Guess what I am!? Exactly, my time at SkinnyFATS was spent browsing the fat portion of the menu.  I did do a quick browse of the healthy side and to be honest there was some items that I would order like the TBLT.  For the gordo's the choices are plentiful.  I ended up splitting 2 dishes  The CHIX on Broadway and the Sweet Cheese Us.  The CHIX on Broadway had to be the best chicken sandwich I ever had.  The fried breast was enormous and spilled over the sides of the bun.  It was crunchy, tasty, crispy.  It was a sensory overload for my taste buds.  The Sweet Cheese Us was very good as well, but the CHIX was the star of my meal that day.  

The location is off strip and in an industrial part of town.  It is very accessible for those that are leaving Vegas and headed back towards LA since it runs parallel to the 15 freeway.  Seating can be a problem, its very small and is first come first serve.  Not a place for a huge gathering.  If you have time while in the Las Vegas area definitely check this place out.  For the type of food you are getting this place is an exceptional value.     

Pros: 
- Parking

Cons
- Can be hard to find. 
- Small seating area
- Can get crowded and can cause long wait times",3v5RTxm6R8M2gR2l0gcfFw,0,0,4,lKNp53JEK8UUSOEDRXZL2A
2768586,2014-07-09,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"What a fun place to grab dinner!!!  It is a little hidden in the business park that it sits in in an industrial area off of Dean Martin...I only drove past it twice trying to find it! Hahaha

I had heard about this place from a few friends, and as I was done eating the same old thing for dinners, so I decided to finally try SkinnyFATS.

The restaurant is small with about 8 tables and a long window bar with stools to sit at.  There is one TV to watch and the decor was hip with paintings on the walls of fruits and vegetables.

As soon as I walked in, the young lady (did not get her name) immediately knew I had never been there before...guess I stuck out like a sore thumb!  hahahaha

Anyway, she guided me through the menu explaining the differences between the Healthy (skinny) dishes and the Happy (fat) dishes.  I could even order breakfast if I wanted as it was served all day.

I settled on ""Berry the Steak.'  It is a flat bread with shaved NY steak, feta and goat cheeses, arugula, balsamic reduction, and blackberries.  I also grabbed a side salad and a soda.

The side salad, though simple, was delicious.  Lettuce, tomato, and a few other veggies with ranch dressing.

Free refills on the soda!  Can't beat Dr. Pepper!

The flat bread was delicious!!!!!!  Nice combo of sweet (berries and balsamic) and peppery (arugula).  There was also nice texture with the crunchiness of the flat bread and the soft warm creaminess of the cheeses.  My only critique is, and this is being picky, is that the flat bread was a little hard to cut with a knife so that it could be cut into more manageable pieces to eat.  I think maybe pre-cutting it into 4 pieces (it's a square shape) might be helpful.

The staff was extremely friendly and totally willing to answer questions about the menu and various dishes.  They gave me a number, I sat at a table, and then delivered it to me when the meal was ready.

I highly enjoyed the meal and the vibe and am looking forward to going back.

I've also never actually been in to eat there, only ordered online for delivery so keep in mind that this review is exclusively about the food.  Their quality is very consistent each time and totally worth the $10 sandwich price.  My only reason for the 4 stars is that the wheat bun that they use for many of their sandwiches is incredibly thick so it's can be a little overwhelming to the rest of the sandwich.  If you like portobello burgers, the Vegwich is seriously delicious, a little spicy, and a little messy.

First of all the place is kind of a bit hard to find. It's located in a suite amongst other industrial businesses in a pretty large sized business complex. Typically not a setting you find a popular caf√© in. Parking can get frustrating as well since you have so many other suites that equals to not a lot of parking. 

When you come in, you will see that there is only one register and I would say about 7 to 8 medium tables. If you don't see a line going out the door, then you got lucky and just avoided the lunch/dinner rush. If you do get stuck in the rush, you better have a decent amount of time allotted not to have anywhere to go any time soon. Remember, you waiting in line, putting your order in, and waiting for your food to come put together equals a lot of patience because all those people that ordered ahead of you are in the same boat. So it takes time for you to get your food since everything is made from scratch.

With that said, I ordered the Burger Benedict, which has a half pound angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles, avocado, fried egg, and special SkinnyFats sauce. It was also accompanied by a side of truffle fries, which was a large enough portion to share with another. The fries were good with the two different flavored ketchups that were available on the tables which were Balsamic Vinegar and Jalapeno (refer to my pic).

All in all, what I had was very good. Its just the parking, location, and long wait that brought it down to a 3 star. I think a bigger place and more accessible location with a couple more registers would make it perfect.

They have many healthier options, as well as things similar to chicken and waffles. Now I've been to Roscoe's out in LA, and they have great chicken and waffles, but these guys offer a comparable dish.

Service was amazing! Decor was phenomenal. All their advertising was top notch too. Hands down, one of the better restaurants I've been to this year.

They are reasonably priced. I ordered the philly steak sandwich, $12 (it was the most expensive thing on the menu). Chix on Broadway sandwich for my wife, $9. Pizza for our daughter, $9.

If I were a chicken, I'd say- take me now, I wish to become immortalized as one of your sandwiches.

I also got SPUDghetti. 
That's spaghetti made of POTATO, covered in butter, cheese and green onion with sour cream. Such a fun and creative take on the potato!!!

Good for you skinny fats! I love you.

The line was almost out the door around 3 in the afternoon, so we had plenty of time to review the menu and make our choices. We decided to go with the Cherry Popper (since it was our first visit) and the Smoke-In-A-Bowl. We picked the skinnyFATS punch smoothie to drink along with one of their craft sodas made with sugar cane. I decided to also try one of their salted caramel cookies for dessert. The staff was extremely friendly and engaged in conversation with us. The food itself came out quick and was well prepared. The Hawaiian bread on the Cherry Popper burger was both delicious and unique. Our smoothie was extremely refreshing and the reusable cup with a happy meter was also a cool touch!

Sue and I decided to go off strip for our food the first night we were in Vegas, and came across SkinnyFATS via yelp. The reviews were rave and the prices were rad, so we popped over for a few bites. 

We had the:
chicken and waffles (of course) - 3-1/2 stars
truffle fries ('cause 100 yelpers recommended it) - 1 star
sweet potato fries - 5 stars
shrimp boat (did you say shrimp... boat) - 4-1/2 stars
tuna tacos - 4 stars

Avoid the truffle fries. Seriously. Unless you want to be disappointed... 'cause it just tastes like regular fries with too much salt. It was so overhyped that we started to call everything we've ever been disappointed in life truffle fries: that terrible anti-climatic arch in the Valley of Fire? It is henceforth renamed ""truffle fries"" arch. The boy who was a serious let down? He's gonna be the truffle fries boy. That... well, I'm gonna stop here. You get the point. 

Don't order the truffle fries.

It's a one stop shop. My husband loved his Neato burrito. He hardly ever raves about food, but he kept saying how good it was. It was full of steak, eggs, and potatoes. It was huge too. My ahi srirachi was bigger than I expected. It was delicious, although messy. The mango relish really paired well with the ahi. The grilled chix was just ok for me. The chicken was a little tougher than I would have liked and the sauce was a tad sweet. But the battered chix (I can't remember the exact name) was better, with a nice crust. 

All the workers there were really nice. You can expect a wait (we went on what I thought was a super busy day, but they said that was actually a slower day). But as we waited, they made sure we were comfortable and sparked up conversation.

Happy"" menu concept, even if the options aren't 100% comparable side-by-side; it makes reading the menu fun, and it's not like the Healthy side is boring - there's some very enticing options on there.

The stars must have aligned when we visited on a Saturday night, since we easily found parking and didn't wait for a table - and we got here at 6:30? I'm not gonna question it, but I can see how frustrating it could get since this place is pretty tiny.

I wanted 1 Healthy, 1 Happy, and it took me about a solid 10 minutes to decide on what to eat. I ended up ordering the Naked Chix (Healthy: mango chicken on rice) and the Ahi Taco San (Happy: ahi tempura on a puffed shell) - both very satisfying after a day of hiking. The combination options are endless!

Service is really friendly, and it's just a cute place to eat.

The location is kind of strange, but the food is amazing!  Small dining space.  I didn't know you could grab a table before ordering so we didn't, and by the time we ordered they were all full.  We had to sit at the high bar against the window, which was difficult with a 22 month old kid.

Of course, I ordered from the ""eat happy"" (aka FAT) side.  I think it was a special burger, the ""Cherry Popper.""  SOOOOOOOOOOO yummy!  Cherry and banana peppers, fried egg, cole slaw, and cheese on a burger on a Hawaiian bun.  I'm still thinking about it.  The fries were yummy too (sweet potato).

I ordered a smoothie for my daughter and I tasted it.  It was very yummy, but tasted more like a milk shake (it said strawberries, blueberries, and peanut butter, but it was white and I saw no hint of berry but did taste like a peanut butter milk shake).  Not sure it was as nutritious as I'd hoped, but delicious nonetheless.  Also, I got her some healthy tacos and tried a bite; they were great!

My dad and his wife fully enjoyed their meals as well!

I can't wait to take my husband here.  The ambiance is cute, definitely for the younger crowd.  I'm young myself, but, maybe it's because I'm a mommy, I get more sensitive to innuendos...""cherry popper"" sandwich, a banana on the men's restroom door, and a peach on the women's restroom door....there were other innuendos but I can't recall.  I'm just sensitive, as I don't think kids would really get them anyway, so I still think it's a fun place to take kids!

My boyfriend and I try to come here once every few weeks and it never disappoints. I'm a vegetarian and he eats anything and everything so there's something for everyone!

If I feel skinny enough to consume some extra calories I'll get the Happymess and substitute the steak for portabello mushrooms. Yum! Pretty much anything on the menu can be made vegetarian so just ask!

I decided to go with the monkey cakes (s'more/banana pancakes) and a side of healthy brown rice. Interesting combo I agree!  The brown rice was really good and fresh. The pancakes were a large portion but unfortunately the bananas are not baked into the batter, but placed on top. Overall they were good cakes but not to the level of Eat or Gold Spike cafe.

2957924,2016-07-28,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Yelp can be very deceiving. 

Based on some of the outstanding reviews about this place I was expecting quite a lot walking in. I was surprised at how cramped this place was; it can probably seat 20 at any given time. I was there during lunchtime, and thought the long line would at least be a marker of food worth waiting for. I was mistaken. Before I describe how underwhelming the food experience was, though, I do want to acknowledge the serving staff that was very attentive and friendly. 

The food on the other hand, was so underwhelming that I was tempted to give this place only a single star to correct it's misleadingly high Yelp rating. I tried the classic burger. I ordered it medium, and it came out completely well done. But that wasn't even the biggest issue, since there are many places that sell overdone but serviceable burgers. This place, on the other hand, insists on serving large half-pound slabs of gray beef atop boring buns with minimal toppings. The burger itself seemed to lack any seasoning, let alone a sprinkle of salt and pepper. If not for a squeeze of yellow mustard, I might not have eaten more than a few bites. The fries were not fresh and equally underwhelming. 

The chicken and waffles is okay, but when you serve something as simple as chicken and waffles, it needs to be spot on or unique in some way to stand out. Here, the waffles are like anything you'd find at a Holiday Inn breakfast buffet, and the fried chicken is hot and crispy but a tad dry. The smotherload is okay, but lacks acid and freshness, and the steak I ordered medium with the burrito also came out overdone. The multigrain protein pancakes here taste okay, but let's not kid ourselves, they don't taste any better than a hot stack of normal buttermilk pancakes at your local Denny's (or a location on the Las Vegas strip).

The price of the food itself is the last nail in the coffin, and with such a lackluster 11 dollar burger, I struggle to see what others rave about in their reviews. The food itself looks good and is certainly very photogenic, making it perfect for Yelp reviews, and the concept of the restaurant is pretty awesome, but poor execution overall really prevent me from giving this restaurant any higher than two stars.",Oqoc9euG-25PXo5-vlgs-w,2,0,2,K9x2qsDmMxzDQPlBiddmbg

I have been going to this location for well over a year. Almost every day I buy my crew lunch, and for a long time this was one of our preferred places to go. Because they are good, and we were not the only ones who thought so. Every month they would be busier, and busier. Not a bad problem to have. But unfortunately, in that process they do not seem to be able to keep up with what is happening in house. After several unpleasant to go order experiences - Orders with wrong, items missing, having to wait a REALLY long time we decided to give them some time to get a handle on this level of success.

Yesterday, for the first time in months we decided to try SkinnyFats again. At 11:10AM placed an order for 6 items and we were told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I was skeptical of that timeline, as it has not been my experience but I went in after 30 minutes hoping the food would be ready. I was wrong. at 12PM I asked one of the stressed out servers when my order would be ready. She seemed so irritated that I would even ask. How dare i???

She let out a huge annoyed sigh, then looked out into the dining room and said ""we are really busy"" and walked away with such hostility. I was actually taken aback. I FINALLY got my order at 12:15PM. Over an hour after I had placed it, and with not even an apology. 

Even after months of hoping they could figure out how to adapt to the level of business, this place is still total chaos at lunch time! And it makes me sad that I have to tell me staff that this place is off the choice list, simply because they cannot figure out how to run the business in a way that actually takes care of the customers.

I've been here over three different times and I have yet to write a review for SkinnyFATS, so this is way overdue. During my visits here I have ordered the Cherry Popper, Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis, Vegwich, Flat Chix and Greens and all the fries!Seriously everything I've tried has been so amazing and full of flavor. Some of the highlights are the Vegwich & Cherry Pooper. 

The Vegwich is a skinny menu item and is filled with Portobello mushrooms, avocado, cherry/banana peppers, spinach, tomato & horseradish yogurt all on a grain toast. Finally a healthy sandwich that will actually fill you up and not leave you looking for something to snack on in about an hour. I normally get this with side of truffle fries. A true Skinny FAT styled meal! 

The Cherry Popper is a spicy all beef burger topped with cherry/banana peppers, spicy slaw, pepper jack and a fried egg on a Hawaiian sweet roll. Do I really have to explain why this is so tasty? Just re-read above and then try one for yourself. Great burger for a first timer to SkinnyFATS, get it? 

Chicken and waffles, amazing salads, and juices! This place really has it all including a cool vibe and look. Vegas is filled with cookie cutter eateries with mundane surroundings, which is why SkinnyFATS is so refreshing on both your eyes and your palate.

Perhaps having it out along with the other menus might assist others like me who assume that the posted menus are the only option. 

I'm excited to hear that you're adding vegan options. Hopefully gluten free as well? Many folks who want gluten free don't really need a dedicated kitchen but choose not to eat gluten for other reasons (thyroid health, or maybe just because they think it's slimming!) etc. For example, I'd have eaten 10 cookies or bars or healthy desserts if they were vegan and gluten free. I'd pay through the nose for them, too. I want to eat healthfully (not added oils and mostly raw, organic, plant based whole foods) but healthy sweets are something that I love, too. Just a few thoughts from a plant based whole foodie.

What a concept, SkinnyFats. It's like the angel on one shoulder telling you to eat a salad or some ahi tuna but that devil on the other side is like ""NO, CHOCOLATE BANANA PANCAKES, NOW!!!"" I fairly waited to write this review til I had dined off both the skinny, and the fat side of the menu. Although the skinny side is excellent and has tons of options of just about everything the fat side does, I still prefer the fat side. Even with the salads! The Aphrodite wedgie was freaking amazing! They recommend add tuna for protein but I added avocado instead. Still great. I'd pass on the truffle fries again, but my boyfriend liked them. He got the Philly that comes with huge portobellos, mushroom heaven! My second visit I had the cheeseburger Benedict and it was a solid, home cooked burger with fresh veggies and egg. It exceeded my expectations actually. They also offer a cucumber water, love when places do that! 
There are also skinny and fat juices, shakes, and floats. Everything from a hangover helper, to a orange fanta float. Honestly, there are no way the creators of this menu weren't potheads. Creativity at its finest put into action. Well done. 
The only downside is parking your car, then parking your butt. Finding parking is rough, then getting food and dining in, even harder. Especially during lunch hour. If you do find a spot, there are people lingering over you, waiting for you to get up. I'm thinking outdoor dining in this area may be prohibited but would be a great idea if allowed. 
Other than that really nothing bad to say. I have also heard they have a secret menu and daily specials. 
I really like that they embrace diversity and let the employees be themselves as well. The owner of this place seems awesome, and I hear from a secret birdie they have chosen a new location for expansion. Nice!",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,3,3,4,aJtxSbKaw_mUQaXTnxKcJw

In depth review: SkinnyFats has a solid buzz on the streets on Vegas with the locals at the current moment. Decided to try it last Tuesday and I am glad that I did. Really cool and hip casual vibe inside. Felt very comfortable and the staff was really nice and welcoming. Could tell they liked working there. 

I order the ""Cranburky"" (Turkey Burger) (($10)) off ""The Healthy Side"" w/ a side of sweet potato fries and the lady ordered the ""More Cow Bowl"" (($11.25)) off ""The Happy Side"" of the menu. In addition we ordered an iced tea and a fresh squeezed orange juice. The total was about $30 for he both of us. Sat down and it took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. They will bring it out to you. 

First impression is ""Wow!"" They give massive sized proportions. I had a giant plate of fries next to my turkey burger. My burger was amazing. Could taste every fresh ingredient and it was not greasy or messy at all. One of the better turkey burgers I have had in town. Will order this again and I highly recommend it. The sweet potato fries were stellar and very tasty!

The lady had the Teriyaki filet bowl and said the meat was delicious. She had a complaint that I can vouch for as I sampled it. The fried rice in the bowl was wet and soggy. Too much juice from the meat and veggies and it ruined the taste of the fried rice. Could do a better job straining the fluids before they add the meat / veggies. Actually turned bowl upside down and strained a good amount of water from it right at the table. She still ate and enjoyed it. We had enough left over for a second tasty meal. They give you a lot! 

Juice was also steep in price. $8.50 for a 24 ounce OJ is a bit much. That's my opinion.

The only thing I have to say that sucks is that the restaurant only seats around 30 people with not a lot of space between tables. 

Skinnyfats has a healthy side and a ""happy"" side on their menu. They also have a wide variety of beverages. Everything is pretty pricey for the amount you get when it comes to snacks. 

I found out that this place had a secret menu. I looked it up and decided to get the Steak and eggs. For a total of $14 this meal comes with slices of steak, potatoes, eggs, and toast. I am so glad I got this dish because the portion was huge and everything was delicious. The steak was so juicy and tender and there was plenty of it. The potatoes were also a hit. The only thing bad about this meal was the desert-dry toast. 

My friends all got something different and they paid too much to receive so little and or a mediocre plate. The Acai bowl didn't have much Acai but a ton of granola.

For the first day, I had their special fried chicken eggs benedict. It was waffle, fried chicken tenders, poached egg, shoestring potato, some delicious house made hollandaise concoction, and syrup. I literally died and went to brunch heaven! I pairs this with a healthy cold press juice that made me feel better about the decadent meal!

For the second day, I tried their s'motherload burrito with a side of truffle fries. Wowsers! You gotta try their housemade ketchup...the Chillpotle and Unipeppercorn are both amazeballs! I came home and immediately ordered some for me to drench myself in the privacy of my own home! I got a fancy smoothie called Charlie Brown, and I just wanted more!

For the third day, I decided on lunch...and had the Spicy Latina (chicken tortilla soup) and the Naked Chix (mango basil chicken over jasmine rice). First and foremost, everything I've ever eaten here has been served piping hot...which is how I like my food, not lukewarm like it's been sitting there...but it tastes like it was hot off the grill! The soup definitely had a kick to it...and it was delicious with so much goodness inside. The Naked Chix was a fantastic rice bowl of healthiness! Perfect lunch!

Very colorful decor with dim and comfortable lighting. This place was BUSY, way too small for the customer base... Definitely not enough seating. However, my boyfriend snagged a table as soon as we walked in... YES!! Since it was our first time here, we were a little confused about how to order. There was a server serving the food and a counter with a register. We weren't sure who to order from... After asking, we figured out how to order: first from the counter and then the server drops the food. 

The menu is a simple front to back menu. Separated: a healthy side and a happy side. We both ordered from the healthy side:) my boyfriend ordered the chicken and protein waffle with sugar free syrup, it looked pretty darn good. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower( small portion maybe four and a half whole pieces of cauliflower) for us to share. It was spicy and delicious. I ordered the portobello sandwich made vegan with no sauce and a side of rosemary hummus. It was so delicious!! Perfect amount of veggies and the bread was toasty and not soggy. The side of sweet potato fries were suppose to come out with truffle oil, they didn't but they charged us for it. My side of hummus was also forgotten and we were charged. Other than the cramped seating and a few forgotten items, this place was great. 

The service was knowledgable and the young cashier was very thorough and sweet. Everything made the receipt, just not the table. We will definitely be returning, possibly trying the other location with friends since it wasn't very group friendly.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,1,1,4,MtdRZFzefSzecNkRkdnBKQ

The place is pretty small and we had party of 8 but thankfully people come and go quickly so all of us get to sit down and eat. You order in the front of the counter and sit down with your number. 

The Menu has two sections skinny and fat! 

We ordered cinnutella, steak and egg, and cookies.

Cinnutella - -Nutella french toast with some fruits, got this unique texture between a cake and cookie but then it gets soggy with the nutella sauce. I think it was a bit too sweet but still very tasty.

Steak and Egg - Steak was nicely cook medium rare but i guess i prefer poached or sunny side up egg, something that has running yolk in compare to their scramble egg which was a bit dry for me. 

Cookie - Got peanut butter and chocolate chunk cookies. Chocolate chunk cookie was on point! the chunk was so big and the cookie was not too hard not too soft, very buttery. Peanut butter cookie was very peanut buttery and good but it was a little too rich.

Overall, I really like the atmosphere of the place and the food is good especially the cookies!! Def a good place to go for some brunch after a long night. so I will def come back and try some more.",YMwACJo4qFjp4Vk1jRnpbg,1,2,4,VjK9EJZj5M1g2pO6N2pmSQ

Finally came upon the opportunity to eat at SkinnyFats again, and this time around they did NOT disappoint!! We went during the week, at night and it was busy but not packed. We walked in the door, waited for the couple in front of us to finish ordering and were then greeted by a most helpful gal. I had my eye on a few things, she helped me boil it down and made recommendations. My husband ordered The Classic and I ordered the Filet o'Fire, both with truffle fries. We also ordered the 3 types of cookies they had freshly baked, to go: blueberry lemon, salted caramel, and chocolate chip. 

The Filet o'Fire was FREAKING FANTASTIC!! I can't imagine ever having a better steak sandwich ever, for as long as I may live. No exaggeration. It was spicy, the filet was cooked to perfection and very tender, the bread, oh my God the bread....toasty, griddled perfection. I begrudgingly gave my husband a taste. He also said it was the $h!t. 

My husband said The Classic was super delish, I wouldn't know since I never came up for air from my own sandwich. 

The truffle fries were damned good!! Next time I may try the sweet potato fries though, just to mix it up. 

And now, the cookies. SWEET LORD, THEY ARE MANNA FROM HEAVEN! The salted caramel cookie is the absolute best thing I've ever stuck in my gullet....I mean, besides the Filet o'Fire. Seriously.

We figured we beat the rush and there would be no one there.  We were mistaken.  This place is the spot.   Every table was full and there was a steady flow the whole time we were there.   The place reminds me of Cali - fresh ingredients, modern, and great food with tons of selections between fresh made juices, smoothies, sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items.

Thanks to Yelp, we ordered the secret off the menu Chicken and Waffles.  It wasn't your standard traditional soul food with meat on the bone.  They were more like tenders but it was delicious and we ate every bite of it.  The chicken held perfectly with the slightly crisp waffle.  There are more secret menu items - just check out the online website before you go...Shhhhh

We also ordered the Bonjour Brulee, egg white french toast with bunch of berries and turkey sausage.  It was part of the healthy breakfast section but it certainly made us feel like we ordered from the Happy section.

Last I had to get an order of the Slaw Chee.  Anything with my name in it such as Cheeburger Cheeburger, I HAVE to support.   The Slaw Chee tasted just like it should - the perfect amount of texture from the cabbage with the perfect symphony of flavors.

Got chicken and waffles - very tender chicken and very flavorful (not just average traditional chicken strips), and the Smotherload burrito - filled with filet cooked perfect medium, as requested.

3142144,2014-07-17,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"When I first moved to Las Vegas SkinnyFATS was at the top of my bookmarked list. After looking over the menu I was intrigued by the protein pancakes. Not many breakfast places offer this type of option. 

My protein pancakes may have been packed with healthy ingredients but like another reviewer said I was hoping for more health information on the pancakes. Are the protein pancakes on the healthy side because they are high in protein and rich in nutrients? Made with whole grains or oats instead of white flour? The pancakes were tasty but I could barely finish one because they were  dense and heavy. I did not like the turkey bacon because it was too salty and I am not a huge fan of agave syrup in general because I just think it is too sweet. If the pancakes were less sweet it may have worked better but because the pancakes were sweet on their own I could not eat it with the agave syrup.

On my last visit I custom made a 24 oz shake with strawberry, frozen yogurt, kale, and banana. The shake tasted sour but not in a good way. I could not make out the kale and overall it was a sour tasteless banana strawberry smoothie. 

After looking over the menu and tasting a few of the items I am not sold on the healthy side of the menu. I think most of their healthy items lean more towards being fat free, low calorie, and sugar free. Some of their breads and tortillas are listed as wheat which can refer to anything that is wheat and usually has the nutrients removed. None of which are healthy or valuable to the body.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,4,2,2,van55NhrLf7sGVmiqOqbrg

While the menu is a little confusing at first, there's two sides to it and I'm sure it's already mentioned but here's the rundown. The left side is the skinny/healthy side and the right is the fat/happy side. Each dish is featured on both sides of the menu but done in a different way to fit the theme. I thought that was awesome!

As far as food goes, it is killer! I had the chick-a-waff-a-dopolis (chicken & waffles) which is a ""secret menu"" item and my wife had the wedge salad, we also shared a side of Hot-Mame (edamame). All of it was great, super flavorful and they definitely aren't skimpy with their portions. The wedge salad is huge and ingredients were fresh. My one and only complaint was the chicken was slightly overcooked...but the flavor definitely made up for it. They also have a good selection of juices, smoothies and such but we opted for a passion tea which was really good. 

All in all, we loved this place and can't wait to go back! Cool concept, cool atmosphere, cool food...oh and the employees are excellent!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,3,3,4,utog1KFzowjNfUncnA8Qyw

It's also super apparent that they don't have enough floor space here. You have to line up to order your food at the front counter, with no guarantee of finding a seat...the chances of which aren't very good since this place is packed during most of its hours of operation. I can't imagine why they have such a small place, as they could do exponentially better by providing more seating for their patrons.

He finally got his mouth to work and he described having shrimp that was in a hollowed out cucumber with some of the most amazing restaurant made spicy catsup. This was the Shrimp in a Boat.

So, last night after we went to see the movie Get Out we drove over to the same location on Dean Martin and I was really impressed by the dynamic menu. I just had to have the Chickawaffadopolis which is delicious fried chicken tenders over a buttermilk waffles with syrup and wow. It was really good!

My husband ordered the Steak Eyes: biscuits with the steak medallions sort of a dish and biscuits with 2 eggs. Our friend enjoyed a dish with zucchini noodles called Zucc It. It looked so delicious, and it was gone in a flash! 

Iced tea was perfect. This is a great place and we are lucky to have 3 of them in Vegas, so I hear.

What I tried didn't work at all. Everyone I dealt with was very friendly and helpful so no service complaints. They couldn't have been nicer. The room is small and cramped. It's a place where you order at the counter, you get a number and they bring the food to your table. As I was waiting in line to order, a waitress was having an argument with a cook thru the kitchen window. She said the order was supposed to be without peppers(?) and the cook was saying that it didn't have peppers. She said she could see the peppers and asked him to make her a new plate. My instincts said to leave. Instead, I ordered a classic burger med rare, a chicken quinoa soup and a coke. I should have left. All tables were full so I took one of the stools along the side bar at the window. The barstools are tiny little things on cylinders that bob up and down as you sit. They are uncomfortable and annoying. The place was busy and I kept getting bumped by people coming and going. That alone ruins the place for me. The soup was brought quickly and looked great in a big cup with herbs on top. The soup was luke warm and bland. It was void of any seasoning. It had lots of veggies and chicken but no flavor and was not served hot enough. The burger shows up in good time and looks nice but picking it up showed immediate problems. The lower bun was already wet from juice. Fingers poked though and it flattened as I tried to eat it. First bite and the meat and veggies slid away, tomatoes fell out. Meat was too rare and under seasoned. Second bite and the bun is totally soaked and dime thin and burger falling apart. I took the plate to the counter and showed the girl the wet broken bun. She offered to make a new one. I was over it, said it was just pathetic and walked out. The food is bad. Either the kitchen doesn't care or cant cook. Seating is miserable.

I go very often and even order delivery food on a regular basis. My boyfriend and I ordered take out earlier today and do the first time I was disappointed. We ordered the Maine wedge, the chicken and waffles and the phatty philly. It was my first time trying the chicken and waffles and they were spot on, best I've had. The Maine wedge was missing dressing and was packaged in the smallest container that it didnt have the same flavor because not everything was distributed evenly. The dressing was the most disappointing though because without it it didnt taste at all as wonderful as it normally is. I also order the phatty philly almost every time and was so upset that I couldn't eat it. They have changed it and didn't mention it and it doesn't say it on the menu either. It now has some weird a1 sauce and peppers. My boyfriend likes a1 so he ate it fine, I however cannot eat it without gagging.

SkinnyFATS is my Brigadoon of dining establishments.  You have to have a heart that's true to navigate the mysterious vortex that is Dean Martin and Sunset - but stick to it, fellow diners!  For when you arrive at SkinnyFATS you're in for some great food.  

Yesterday I went and ordered The Sweet Cheese Us sammich with a side of fruit.  I wanted the truffle fries so badly, as they are Heavenly but I'm watching my figure.  The side of fruit was nice though - not just a sad cup of melon with the solitary grape that is so standard in the world of fruit sides.  This side of fruit had watermelon, honeydew, lots of grapes, pineapple and some cantaloupe.  Jackpot!  The Sweet Cheese Us was delicious.  I was trying to come up with the perfect description for it and it hit me - it's an artisan Philly cheese-steak.  Or maybe a couture cheese-steak would be more appropriate.  Pick one, it doesn't matter because it's delicious.  The shaved NY Strip used is tender and tasty, the caramelized onions a perfect, and the portabello mushrooms are a nice touch.  

The prices seem a little steep - but the portions are HUGE.  Here's a tip - go with a friend and split a sandwich.  I was alone yesterday and barely put a dent in my meal.  Another nice little tip to save dollars - don't order a beverage because they provide complimentary cucumber lemon water that is so cold and refreshing.  I had already ordered a soda and regretted that as soon as I took a swig of their special water.  

Anyway, good luck finding it - the location is tricky.  But if you follow your heart (and your GPS is calibrated) you're in for a great meal!",2MD7YF90xxjqPIAS4vcWjw,1,2,5,oLqheOiM_DqO0kPgXr4xIg

I felt like there should've been an exterior crunch to them, like if they were coated with breadcrumbs and broiled for a very mild charred flavor. It tasted like boiled cauliflower brushed with watered down buffalo sauce. I also ordered a juice with carrot apple and ginger, they were out of smoothies at the time. The juice was delicious, but it did bum me out that it was pre made, so I could not modify the juices in anyway. Not sure how long they keep the juices for.

The restaurant seems too small for comfort. Definitely not enough seating for 6PM on a Friday. We were lucky enough to get a table because our other friends were holding one while they waited for us to arrive. The girl at the counter was nice, and the food came out pretty quickly. They have sodas from an indie company that's not Pepsi or Coca-Cola which is awesome. That's the only good thing I have to say. 

The truffle fries didn't taste anything like truffle and my friends were wondering where it was on the fries. My chicken sandwich looked like a portobello mushroom and quickly became the joke of the group since my friends thought there was no way a chicken sandwich could be that dark. It was practically burnt to a crisp. Either that or they don't change their frying oil with enough frequency which is gross too. The sandwich tasted really bland and dry. Hardly any aioli and it wasn't until I was more than halfway finished that the slaw/aioli started to show. 

My friends weren't crazy about their food either, so I'm pretty sure none of us will return. If you're looking for food to hit before the airport, you should go to El Fresco's just on the other side on Paradise for what Vegas voted as the ""Best shrimp tacos""",dLoUSe9E25agXphQjx8Svg,5,1,2,AZ02Ce5YNSJqKsNsCS4-3w

Many friends told me it's very small and to try to go later in the day, as to avoid the lunch time rush. 

I met 4 other people at noon on a Monday. It seemed pretty full at the time, but we had no issues waiting in line to order. Wait time for food to be served seemed just about right, and everyone in my party received their food roughly about the same time. 

I had the healthy breakfast option. Bonjour Br√ªl√©e: two pieces of French toast, two turkey sausage patties, berries, and agave. Although I was extremely jealous of everyone else's burgers, I was thoroughly happy with my meal choice. 

By the time my group was done, the restaurant was packed with a line almost to the door.

The chicken and waffles was delicious and was the size of the plate! The chicken could have used a little more seasoning but it was so tender and juicy still.

Warning don't go off the yelp pictures...some of the items are not available like the red velvet waffles.  You walk in & place your order at the counter.

From the funky decor to the wholesome ingredients, SkinnyFats looks as if they are attempting to make a positive impact on the Las Vegas dining scene.

That being said............. The food was not what I had expected. 

I really do like the healthy/indulgent theme and the service is really good, it's just....Ahhh.....I don't know...... As you can see, I am struggling a little bit with this one. 

I had the Phatty Philly with the truffle fries, a soy milk blueberry shake (kids menu) and half of Vannesa N.'s sugar cookie.

Let me start out by asking, what is the big deal with truffle fries? I mean, they are good and all I guess. I just think they taste like normal french fries do. Maybe it's just me. So yeah, they were decent. The Philly looked amazing on the plate, but once I dug into it, I noticed there were like, four or five pieces of meat, and the rest were mushrooms. I like mushrooms, but when it comes to a Philly, you want MEAT, and the mushrooms are almost like a garnish. This was like a 50/50 ratio of meat and mushroom. The city of Philadelphia would be pissed if they knew! Plus, it was very oily.

The shake I ordered was off the kids menu, because honestly, the shakes on that menu looked tastier than their grown-up counterparts. I ordered the blueberry one, and they gave me the option of having it made with 2% milk or soy, as well as having ice cream or frozen yogurt. I thought that was awesome. I like having choices, so this was a plus for SkinnyFats in my eyes.

After our meal, Vanessa, Marie and I just sat and chatted. While doing this, Vanessa decided on a sugar cookie (she was sitting like, two feet away from the glass case they are held in, so I'm not surprised). The cookie came out room temperature first, and it was not so impressive. Marie T.'s friend that works there noticed that Vanessa was not thrilled with the cookie, and brought out another one, this time warm. It was better. MUCH better. Still not thebomb.com, though.

I will admit, this was only my first trip. And I didn't really order what my gut had told me, which was the french toast. I think I will try the breakfast next time, then update my review accordingly.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,8,6,3,mPShkzFCNLfFG1U1mYN60w

I got the mean bean burger which is a vegetarian burger, which is surprising because I usually don't go vegetarian for my burgers. I also got their frickles (friend pickles).

The burger was okay as far as vegetarian burgers go. I can't really judge the quality since I dont really eat vegetarian burgers, but I enjoyed it. Frickles were really good - recommend! And fries were good too.

Portion-wise the burger was bigggg, fries were a plenty, and there were a good number of frickles. Ended up boxing up ~1/2 the burger and some fries/frickles.

I really dug the whole idea and presence of this contemporary farm-inspired cafe, but I feel like its location does not serve it to its full potential as say maybe, downtown. This place is reminiscent of its up-and-coming counterparts located there, with its refreshing spin on food and novelty of a specific themed decor, but it felt like it was lost in a sea of industrial suite buildings by the freeway in the middle of nowhere. 

The employees were definitely friendly though, and provided us the low-down upon hearing that this was our first visit. We came at a slower time, so we didn't experience the line madness that I've read about. I chose an item from the ""healthy side"" - the Greek gluten-free pizza aptly christened ""Nice to Greek You,"" while my boyfriend ordered from the ""happy side"" - a BLT-esque sandwich entitled ""Bomb Diggity"" with a side of their truffle fries, which were sooo good. My pizza definitely tasted ""healthy,"" but because of its generous heaping of toppings, I was full after only half. I wasn't a big fan of the gluten-free bread, I guess, but that's a preferential thing. 

In addition, I liked how their cups are reusable. Take those babies home and wash 'em! All about being green. And if you're just going to have water, that's all right too, because they offer some lovely, fruit-infused water available at your dispense.

There were multiple other tables that the manager was called to in the short time that we were there. All having issues with their food being served cold or an incorrect order.

FOOD
Whether you order from the ""skinny"" half of the menu or the ""happy"" half, the food is delicious and wholesome. 

Cranburkey: The name alone still gives me a chuckle when I think of it, but it's also one of the first items that caught my attention. Without reading the description, the title alone made me think this burger bares some similarities to a Bobby sandwich. Not the case. Sandwiched in between a 9 grain bun is a specially seasoned turkey patty, cranberry spread, arugula, and onion and tomato slices. First bite, the turkey patty's flavor reminded me of a breakfast sausage patty. Combine that with the cranberry spread, it's a perfect match. In addition, I really dug the presentation of my Cranburkey. I could get used to having my burgers presented to me with a knife jammed right in the middle, but I doubt burger joints would honor my request if I made it. 

My entree also came with the option of sides: truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a house salad. I skipped the fries this time and went with the house salad. The salad is simply chopped romaine lettuce with dices of cucumber and tomato, and it comes with ranch dressing on the side. The salad was just, well, a basic salad, but it obviously didn't come out of a bag and ""ready to eat,"" and that makes a difference in the dining experience.

RESTAURANT
Tiny. This spot seems to receive plenty of traffic even after the traditional noontime lunch hour, so seating is limited. However, you can place an order online and have your meal delivered to you. Going back to the seating aspect, if you sit at the high tables by the windows, there are electrical and USB outlets for your gadgets. Another plus side is that you get to watch the planes take off from the airport. 

SERVICE
Top-notch. Friendly and helpful, especially to first-timers. 

OVERALL
Both food and service were great, and I'd definitely return to try more of their menu items, especially their breakfast offerings.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,9,5,4,x30iF4_HD2_DpWa5G1sSPQ

You can either choose the ""happy"" side or the ""healthy"" side to order from and yes it is exactly what it sounds like. A cool thing they do is that they list calorie info for the healthy side but not for the happy side! I'm all for the indulgence.

I got an item off their special iPad menu - the eggs Benedict with a thanksgiving twist. It was a delightful concoction consisting of stuffing waffles, candied cranberries, gravy, turkey and poached eggs. 

My GOD it was heaven. I appreciated the perfect portioning. I was able to get my fix but also finish the whole thing.

The dessert was the best part! My friends and I got two cookies to share - the chocolate chunk and the lemon blueberry. HOT DAMN! They warmed the cookies up and it was like bliss in your mouth.

One star off only for the lack of table space - we had to wait for a bit until a party left before we could get seated.

You can't go wrong with either the ahi taco-san ($3.75) or ahi srirachi taco ($3.50), both which were overflowing with ingredients. Portion sizes are generous all around. The Off the Stick ($12) gluten-free pizza was large enough to share. It's not your typical pizza crust (thin and cracker-like), but everything topping it was so amazing that the crust was secondary. The Happymess ($9) with truffle fries and sliced filet is another hit.

Their menu is divided into healthy and not-so-healthy offerings. Although, some might argue that the agave nectar used in many of the healthy dishes isn't healthy at all. Personally, I'm not a fitness freak and I'm not strict about what I eat. I'll pretty much eat anything. And, so far I've had plenty of dishes here from both sides of the menu and have loved just about everything.

When we asked why our meal didn't all come out together we were told ""I dunno, kitchen priorities I guess.""  You would think the kitchen's priorities would be to get all items on one ticket out at the same time.  As far as the taste, the protein pancakes were just ok; they were more sticky than I remember.

But you can go to a Olive Garden or PF Changs in any town! We wanted local flavor!

Boy, did we find it!

You have to look carefully because this place isn't in a location you'd expect! But look carefully because you don't want to miss it! It's worth the extra effort!

So be prepared: it's small, but there are tables and a bar along the window for seating. You order at the counter then find a place to eat (or have one of your party claim a table early). So it's not a large, sit down and have someone take your order place!

Walking in the door, you are greeted by the friendly staff! They really know how to make you feel welcome! They're enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu suggesting substitutions to fit your tastes or dietary needs.

Then the food came.

Yummoh! I ordered the Vegwich and changed the dressing to the lemon basil aoli. Best sandwich I've ever had in my life! My niece got the Chix on Broadway and it was a BIG sandwich! It was also amazing! The only comment she had was that she couldn't taste the dressing -- would have asked for more! My sister got the Happymess and while it was good, it didn't blend well...more just foods that were put together in a bowl. But all those foods were good!

The fries were BEYOND divine!! Both the regular fries (which were skinny but managed to still be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside) and the sweet potato fries. Not enough words in the English language to describe how incredible they are! Best I've had!

There is something for everyone here, whether you're watching your weight, trying to live a healthier lifestyle, or if you just want some feel good comforting food, you can find it here. Unfortunately for those who are off on the weekends they are closed to the public and reserve the weekends for catering functions. Business hours are Monday through Friday, 8am-8pm.

I decided to pop in one day before going in to work and try the Bon Jour Brulee(Their Version of French Toast)Two pieces of multigrain bread dipped in their ""Creme Brulee"" egg batter and cooked to perfection, served with fresh berries, butter, whipped cream, and agave syrup. It also came with two pieces of applewood smoked bacon. for $6.75, this is a steal, and a very good way to start your day.

I also enjoyed my Sweet and Spicy Shake-Juiced beets, apples and ginger blended with banana and frozen yogurt-YUM! Shakes are offered in two sizes(24 and 32oz) and you have your additional choice of soy milk, 2%, frozen yogurt, or vanilla ice cream.

Even though you expect a bunch of muscle heads to be there because it's a health conscious restaurant, it's a super hip place.
Customer Service:
Great staff, you can tell when someone loves what they do or are really good at paying attention to detail. I love that you place your order at the register and they bring it to your table and pick up your dish after your done.
Food: I love the Sunday Sundae! I guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome! Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian.
Price: For the quality and amount of food that you receive it's inexpensive.

I give the food presentation and flavor 4 1/2 stars but the price for the portion size is like those of venues located on The Strip. Way too over-priced. $2.50 for a side salad that consists of maybe a cup of chopped lettuce, some diced onions and a thimble full of dressing.

The last time I was in Vegas I drove by here.... and kept driving. This place is in an office building complex. It doesn't look like much from outside, that's for sure. When you go inside, the place is clean and super hipster. The menu items are a good amount so you have options.

When you walk in to the cashier asks if you've been there before. If you haven't, like me, she explains how the menu works. It's pretty simple. They serve all the menu items literally from 9 AM to 9 PM.  This place is super super small so try to come during those non-rush hours. I went around 6 o'clock and there was already eight people there, and in about 10 minutes 10 to 12 people showed up... And I was feeling a little cramped. There are seats aligned along the window and lots of plug-ins for you to plug in your computer and or other fancy items... However that's the same wall that you have to walk past in order to get to the cashier, and there are four person settings directly behind where you're standing. So if you're the table directly in front of the cashier you are getting a clear butt shot of every single person ordering. Definitely not going to be my favorite spot to sit.

I finally figured out what I wanted to order. But also wanted to get the opinion of the cashier on what the most popular item was on the menu. She didn't know and rambled off one thing from each category. Not really helpful if you ask me. But she did recommend, if I didn't want something particular, they were happy to substitute anything for anything! That means literally unlimited mix and match combos! I do actually love that. So my order was The Caprizza for 8.95 and the off menu item fried pickles with a chipotle aoli for dipping. Oh... and A large black tea unsweetened. The total came to $17.47. Super pricey for the food items I actually received. The flatbread was about the size of my coach wallet. And was literally sitting on the cardboard! No wax paper down... No interference between literally my flatbread and the cardboard that it came in! When they drizzle the balsamic over my pizza while it was inside the box the balsamic literally was on the cardboard.  I was not a fan of that at all and will definitely not be ordering the flatbread to go again. I did however receive enough fried pickles to feed two or three people. I got this as a to go order because I wanted to eat in my hotel room and do a little work. I wasn't really a fan of the to go order because the food didn't really hold up. (I think???? I mean I haven't ever eaten at the restaurant... So I assume....) 

I would go back, and eat inside instead of togo. Maybe try some of their other items that looks pretty interesting... So definitely look for that in the next couple of days. I will update my review then. For now... I am at a firm 3 stars - disappointed :( ) 
------------------------
Ok..... update! Went back  ( Wed around 7pm ).  ZOIE BLEW MY MIND! Super high energy, Awesome job on welcoming me, knew the menu AND helped me on sifting threw what I wanted and didn't want - with out confusing me or overwhelming me on my order options! Great job ZOIE! She could even had some reservations about a condiment that came on my recommended burger, called me out on it, and excluded it for me... good job AGAIN zoie! 

I once again ordered to-go just to make it even... I ended up ordering chix on Broadway, my side was regular fries and I ordered a large black ice tea. ( see Togo order and sandwich attached ) when I opened it up it looked taken care of and nice and neat. After unwrapping and taking the first bite I was not disappointed! The sandwich was big and the chicken was hot, the coding was not too rough... As to mess up the roof of your mouth, you know what I mean people. The fries were hot and my ice tea was fresh. I was so glad to have a good experience with the food this time. I'd read all of these amazing reviews about it but didn't have the same experience as other people. This time it was much much better!

I gave them one more star because of the improvement of the food, and impressive attitude and knowledge of Zoie!! I look forward to coming back next month to see what the dining in experience is like.

To say the least I was disappointed. Yes I should have returned it but when there is barely room to move around,it takes 10 minutes to get a drink refill at the counter and you are with a group of people; the odds of get your food back in a short moment of time wasn't going to happen.

This place is seriously a gem.  It's a cozy artsy little restaurant, kind of randomly placed between the airport & SpyOnLasVegas, which was pretty unexpected.  Anyways, you walk in [but first you take a couple selfies outside next to the big smiley face mural on wall] order your food at the counter & they serve it to you.
I opted for the chicken & waffles, because in most food situations I'll opt to swing on the fat side [it's fine, I got a veggie juice after].

Although we were en route to Bachi Burger, the line there was just too horrendous. Thank god for yelp, it lead us straight to skinnyfats.

SkinnyFats is the best of both worlds, you can get your super delicious, indulgence type of food that will bust your diet but make your tastebuds all so happy, or you can get a more waistline friendly selection that is equally delicious and satisfying. They have items ranging from the most delectable breakfast items to a more savory burger. 

Pros:
-good menu options and decent prices to mix and match your choices.
-good serving sizes.
-knowledgeable workers
-options to either go healthy or indulge in your inner fat kid

Cons:
-limited seating
-first come first serve bar space or tables
-not great for huge parties

I ended ordering a ahi srirachi taco and the slow boat to china. Although slow boat to china looked very small when it first arrived, to my surprise, the serving of chicken salad stuffed in the cucumber boat is actually quite substantial. Taste wise, I was very pleased and so was the rest of my group.

I only knew about this place because of Charity Faith recommendation on her facebook page and positive people seem to lead to positive outcomes so I went. I would have given 5 stars but I have 2 gripes. They need a bigger place because they have a pretty good thing going and it seems like a lot of people are enjoying their experience there. My last gripe is I really dislike them serving things that have to be cut on pizza pans. If I have to cut a burger with a knife and it bottoms out to the pan it makes that chalk board screeching sound.

All in all a great place to eat, prices are decent.

I want to also say that the first time I was there it was busy and I see a lot of reviewers have been there when its packed. Sit with a stranger and stop being so walled off, you might meet your next best friend.

Changed my star rating to 5 from 4 since they now have nice plates and I eat here like once a week and we sometimes try new stuff they have on their menu and they don't have any food there that is anywhere near less that damn good.

all of those statements truly explains the name of what Skinny Fat means. Left side of the menu is all the healthy stuff and right side is all of the unhealthy items. it has everything your heart can desire. the good and the bad. 

Ordered:
Filet o fire- comes w a side - truffle fries - it was the right about of spiciness. the steak was not chewy. roasted jalape√±os. right about of kick. truffle fries was on point! 
Meltdown- comes w a side - sweet potato fries. the whole thing was super soft! loved the flavors and taste. sweet potato fries were also on point!
Chicken tenders -kids menu comes with a side. - fresh fruit. my little one ate the whole thing! 

Staff are really nice. Seats are first come first served. which kinda sucked because the place is small and you're like trying to hunt people down when they are done. or you give them the evil eye like fool, you're done eating hurry up and leave! food comes out at a very reasonable time. my little family would definitely come back the next time we are in town. we really enjoyed our food and the variety that they had. definitely no complaints as everything tasted so good on the evil/unhealthy side of things. i'm sure the healthy side tastes just as good. lol

I could say that this eatery is on my top list at number one. A choice of eating healthy or happy is a cool concept. A great marketing strategy to attract people who sometimes workout and people who pig out. Guilty pleasure. I loved the turkey burger on the health side which was served with a special yogurt sauce. Nom nation. The truffle fries here are amazing too. Until next review. I need to try more of their dishes on both sides of the menu.,P4XUvN_8alI6dpTC_3LMkg,2,1,5,byg2FU9Lzo3imRqp3OtRtQ

If you like to overpay for small amounts of food this is the place for you. I ordered a steak salad that came on spinach, which first of all if you know anything about spinach it wilts pretty fast so that's pretty weak when not mixed. I'm 5'2"" and weigh 110 lbs, if I order a salad and it doesn't fill me up I think that says something about the restaurant, especially since I hardly ever leave a place without a to-go box. On to the steak.. it was sliced very thin and could almost be considered crumbled, not good quality at all. It was a very sad excuse for a $12 salad. 

My husband's chicken sandwich came with his egg as ordered (lucky him), yet he still wasn't satisfied. He said it tasted very plain, basically no seasonings. He said RR would have been better, I didn't taste it so I don't know.

I ordered my salad the gentleman asked me if I would like to add avocado, I said yes, my husband ordered his, then we paid and sat down. After I get my food I realize they forgot my avocado, no big deal, I let him know. The runner instantly starts eyeballing our receipt on the table (which if I may add has no items listed just the total of $30), and lets me know that he can go double-check to see if I was charged for it and if I wasn't they would have to charge me. He comes back lets me know that we weren't charged and it'll be $1.08. Mind you my husband ordered a chicken sandwich that he's eating with his hands. They want him to dig into his wallet for $1.08 to put on a card.. I understand watching how much stuff you give away for free, but you also need to be aware of how you treat people.. we won't be back. 
On top of everything with the food it was cramped (not busy), loud, cold, and just generally an uncomfortable place (quite literally, the tables were terrible). The fact that the cashier had to read us each soda nozzle because there wasn't a list and they are too small to see, was very unnecessary. 

We paid $30.xx for a chicken sandwich and fries, a (pathetic) ""steak"" salad, and two sodas. 

The best thing about that place was the soda.",s9oqwnLmsJ41n5n_L6riWA,0,0,2,wLzp9mcZmimP2LatpKwyew

The menu has two sides: the skinny side (healthy-ish food) and the fat side (drop dead delicious horrible-for-you food).  The concept is fresh and I find it amusing for some reason; the place makes me smile.  I also love the fact that they have infused water for patrons.  It's a nice treat.

But the food is hit and miss I've found.  I love the Siracha Ahi Tacos, but there is soooo much dressing on the slaw that it drips everywhere and makes the tortillas soggy.  The chicken and waffles was excellent.  My friend got the Cranburkey sandwich from the Skinny side and said it was very dry.  The burger my husband had was amazing.  It seems like the Skinny foods are the ones that I'm slightly disappointed by, but the Fat foods are pretty damn delicioso.

3801436,2017-09-12,9,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Hmm this is a review for their vegan menu. If you're a vegan... it wouldn't be the worst thing coming here but it's definitely not my first choice. They have quite a bit of options to choose from, but they all taste a bit too healthy for my liking. I love being healthy of course, but when I'm craving something sweet, savory, and delicious...healthy isn't really the word I want to use to describe my meal. I feel like their vegan options give you that classic ""oh yea that's definitely vegan"" vibe. I got the vegan BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST...oh my please do yourselves a favor and stay away from that. The bread they use is absolutely appalling imo. I don't understand why they can't just use regular vegan white bread or something, instead they went for a 100% whole wheat bran concentrated multigrain sand flavored bread. Just kidding I actually don't know what type of bread they used but it tasted like that to me. I believe they were trying to go for that healthier option for those who want to watch their weight but it kinda sucks that they automatically paired it with the only vegan french toast since not all vegans are into that type of taste. I also tried the AVOCADO TOAST. It was a little better than the french toast, probably my favorite thing ordered. But I have certainly had much better avocado toast elsewhere. Pita and hummus were average, although the pita was harder than I would have liked. The ""STEPHEN CURRY"" was a lot spicier than I thought it would be. It could be pretty good for those who like spicy foods but I'm not much of a fan. Overall, I think this place deserves three stars for at least trying to accommodate vegans with average tasting foods.

I wanted about 12 things on the menu.  I went with the spudghetti.  Totally neat concept and soooo tasty!  And fun to eat.  My friend got the mango chicken thing with brown rice.  And both entrees made our eyes roll back into our heads.  Foodgasm.  

We have to come back for breakfast.  And dinner another time. And dinner another time...again.  

I got the cinna schnapps smoothie or something like that. It was good but very fragrant and spicy...it tasted like how you'd think spicy baby wipes would smell.  I know that's not the most appetizing way to describe it but my friend said spicy perfume.  It was good...but I could only drink about 3/4 of it before the taste was overwhelming.

I got two cookies.  I have a sweet tooth.  I got the salted caramel which I wish I had eaten first. It was good, it didn't WOW me.  You want to know what did WOW me? Keep reading to find out!  The lemon blueberry cookies.  Cookies are not my go to dessert.  They are a last, desperate resort. The lemon blueberry cookie is seriously the best cookie I have ever had.

The flatbread just wasn't good and not worth it at $8, $2/slice. The truffle fries were ok, but can you really mess up fries and adding truffle oil? The total of our bill was $24.

It was PACKED on a Tuesday at around noon which was a good sign. Once I got up to the counter (3 ladies had given up and walked out- they were not fans of the ""first come first serve"" way of ordering), I placed my take out order.

My biggest gripe is the obvious. The space is way too small for there crowds, and there is nowhere to wait for your food. I felt like I was either hovering over the people seated and eating or right in the only way in or out of the back of house. It was total chaos in there.

Once I got my food back to the office is was good enough, with the exception of the Truffle Fries. The same style of fry the McDonald's serves (skinny) with WAY too much truffle oil. Not a fan- if I make it back I won't order them again.

-Husband's ""fat"" side treat was 86'd, so the wonderful staff member suggested a substitution off of the skinny side---again, no disappointment here.

I am usually a creature of habit when it comes to certain things, take an item on a menu that I fall in love with. When I try to venture out and get something different, I usually kick myself for doing so. Case in point, my experience here. I started following them on Instagram awhile back, and the food pornography they put on is off the charts! I had to try the Slow Boat to China, Asian chicken salad, slaw chee in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aoili. This quickly became my favorite menu item. To really confuse my taste buds, I shared the Drunken Monkey Pancakes, buttermilk pancakes, maple glazed bananas, graham crackers, marshmallows, chocolate w/applewood bacon. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but this was too much, even for me. One bite was enough.  Ok, go ahead and throw in an order of your famous truffle fries. Now that's what I'm talking about. Those were really good, as well as the sweet potato fries. 

The next couple times, I'd tried to stick to the ""healthy"" side of the menu, I tried the Cranburkey SF turkey burger, arugula, tomato, red onion & cranberry basil yogurt on a honey wheat bun w/side. It was really plain and boring, even with the cranberry basil and onion, I ended up putting the slaw chee on it to give it some flavor. 

Last time I was there I ordered the special of the day which was Chicken & Waffle Chowder. Exactly as it sounds, it was really gross. 

But what has really left a sour taste in my mouth was my experience with the delivery service. I decided to order online for delivery, I order my food, check out, and it gives me a total. Well about 20 minutes later I hear my email alert go off on my phone, so I check my email, and it is a confirmation of my order, but with a $10 fee added for delivery. No where on the online ordering does this state this fee, and it was not what I agreed to when I ""checked out"" online. I called immediately to cancel my order (I live 7 miles from SkinnyFats, I wasn't about to pay that) but I'm told it's too late to cancel, so I tell him that I will pick my order up. So I write a ""tip"" on the page alerting others of the delivery fee that is not stated, and I get an email from Charity pretty much pressuring me to remove the tip, which I relunctantly did, and I wish I hadn't.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,13,6,3,d_qpzoyCDHTQu2fhu2p4VA

3873267,2015-06-18,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I first discovered SkinnyFATS at the 2013 Bite of Las Vegas and enjoyed it so much I sought out their brick & mortar establishment soon thereafter.  

First, let me say that I am glad they opened a second larger location a few miles away from this one!  While I have enjoyed everything I've ever ordered here, it's just a pain coming to this location.  It's not really conveniently located near anything, the very limited parking is a bit of a nightmare, and there is a perpetual line to order, sometimes so long that it's out the door.  Unfortunately, once you actually do order, the seating is limited to about 8 tables and a bar along the window so you're usually left awkwardly holding your number and hoping someone finishes so you can snag their table before your food comes.  

This trip I ordered the Smoke in a Bowl ($10.00)- Agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onion & pineapple over brown rice w/black bean salsa & cilantro lime yogurt.  This is the first time I have ordered this and I Loved it!  It looks more like Disaster in a bowl, than Smoke, but it tasted like Awesome in a bowl!  All the acidic flavors blended so well together with the yogurt and the large chicken tenderloins were juicy and delicious.  I would definitely order this again.

My friend ordered the Naked Chix add avocado ($7.50, plus $1 for the avocado)- Seared chicken breast in mango basil sauce over brown rice, w/cilantro yogurt.  I have ordered this before and enjoyed the slightly sweet chicken, but I think my bowl was a far more satisfying option.  She was still hungry when we left.

Some other items I have tried and loved in the past were the CauliFIRE, Chix on Broadway, Cherry Popper Burger, and the Sweet Potato Fries.  All solid options in my opinion.

A note: They used to carry Coke products, and their online menu still reflects that, however, they switched to Boylan products a while back, but their unsweetened Passion Iced Tea is wonderful!",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,5,4,3,8AAivqVRfGxQFXnltyT9AA

3877109,2013-11-03,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I've tried a variety of menu items here including the: TBLT, God Fries, Shroomin' Philly and chicken & waffles. Out of all those items I think I enjoyed the God Fries the most while everything else was okay. The God fries had chicken, feta and other things that made a nice contrast of flavors and textures. If you order the Shroomin' Philly, just note that it is vegetarian because there is no beef in there at all. You might be better off ordering the Phatty Philly even if it is on the Happy Side. I was deceived by the picture and thought there was meat until I started eating the sandwich. The chicken and waffles was pretty standard, but definitely no wow factor. Make sure to ask for the maple syrup on the side because there was a little bit too much for my liking. I haven't ordered these items but tried them from another person's plate:Tu nuts, Ahi Sirachi tacos, and Naked chicks all of which are very tasty and I highly recommend! If anything look at the Yelp pictures and if it looks good then it should be good. 

People talk about a line, but I guess that's only during the lunch hour rush because I've never encounter it on my past 4 visits. Ambiance is awesome as you can already tell from the pictures, this place is definitely trendy even the signs for the male and female restrooms crack me up.

3877737,2017-11-26,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Great concept in offering food for those with special dietary needs like vegan and gluten free without skimping out in taste.  My husband and I didn't need it, but it was nice to see this option for those who do. The place is located in an industrial strip mall with no other restaurants around it. You can't miss the place though due to the graphics used for their signage. Inside they offer a few counter seats and less than ten tables. We came during a busy Saturday after Black Friday and there was a line congregating all the way to the outside. You can peruse the menu while waiting in line but it moves pretty quickly. 

I ordered a Classic Burger with a side of Yummus (their play on words for hummus) served with cucumbers (you can opt for pita bread as well). I picked my side so you don't have to get that combo. I substituted their SF sauce (which looked like a thousand island based sauce and pink) for mustard. Mine also came with a fried egg (I asked for sunny side up). My husband ordered the chicken and waffles with fried eggs on top. 

My burger was good but nothing special. I really enjoyed the hummus though- thick, yet creamy and with a good lemon flavor. 

I think my husband's dish was way better. 

Unique concept and pretty creative dishes made for a cool visit. It is far from the strip but there is a billboard right above the restaurant to help you locate it. Despite its odd location, it is super busy so I think that is a testament to its popularity. 

Service quick and friendly. You order at the front and take a number, find a seat and they bring everything out to you. There is cucumber and lemon flavored spa like water for self serve in paper cups, if one desires.",WMcryFOUZzY5og8pU1NZyQ,1,0,4,mOgutkVXPY2CUx8h2wWUZg

Plenty of parking at night (we arrived around 8PM), as it seems to be located in a commercial office complex. The large billboard was definitely helpful in locating the restaurant, which has a rather unassuming front.

The menu is slightly overwhelming, as there are two sides: Healthy and Happy (less healthy), with lots of interesting options. Ordering is done at the counter, and the service was great. 

I ordered the Chickhumm, which was kind of bland, but it might be my fault for ordering from the Healthy side. My brother noticed that the main scent coming from the sandwich was the sprouts. Although underwhelming, it was still a huge portion.

I also got the Caulifire (cauliflower buffalo wings) appetizer which was very spicy and tasted slightly pickled - not bad! I sampled my family's orders: Naked Chix, Hot Chix, and Sweet Cheese Us and they were all pretty tasty.

Grab a seat and take your time, then when you go to the counter it'll be easier to order. I like the vibe of the place. The decorations are different from what you usually see at other places.

Food: I got the chicks on broadway sandwich with truffle fries. I thought the sandwich was okay. I feel like it lacked some taste. I actually liked it more as leftovers because the sauce was thicker from being out. The truffles fries were decent. If I wanted fries, I think I would have just got the regular ones.
 I do wish that they had a better iced coffee selection.

3891298,2018-05-31,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Expectations vs. reality - The photos of the food posted looked amazing, so we thought to swing by for a quick lunch. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and chicken soup to start, then the 'Smoke in a Bowl' and fried tuna/steak tacos.

Photos looked amazing, but the food was just terrible.

Everything was overly salted and a complete lack of care was given to most of the items we ordered.

The cauliflower itself was ok, but then it was completely drowned in a super salty buffalo sauce. It became buffalo sauce with a side of cauliflower.

The chicken soup was overly salted, but if you took a sip of water in between each bite, it was actually pretty decent.

The Smoke in a Bowl was hands down the worst thing I've ever ordered from any restaurant I've ever visited. The rice was not rinsed, so in the gigantic mountain of rice (2 to 1 rice to actual meat/veggie ratio), the rice was just one gelatinous glob. The actual dish itself looked nothing like the pictures. It looked and tasted as if someone took half a tin of tomato sauce, and cooked bell pepper, onion, pineapple and chicken in it for a couple minutes, then just spooned it over the rice. Where's the 'smoke'? This is the literal embodiment of Yelp catfishing.

The tacos were again, just incredibly oversalted. By the time the tacos arrived at my table, the fried tuna batter was soggy, soft, and absolutely disgusting. The steak tasted like someone spooned brining liquid over it, then covered the entire thing with a handful of chopped radish.

From the outside you wouldn't think any special about it, being in an industrial building complex, but once you step inside the restaurant, however small, it has it's own identity. 

You line up and order and have a seat while you wait for it to arrive. The menu confused me a bit, it took me a while to figure out that the healthier options were listed on the left and the 'fattier' selections were on the right. I decided to go with the Chix on Broadway sandwich (asked to have the chicken tossed in buffalo sauce), an order of sweet potato fries, and a fresh strawberry lemonade (which could have been sweeter).

3909948,2015-02-11,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Yumm-my! The one word to describe my experience at SkinnyFats. I've heard about SkinnyFats from friends so my boyfriend and I decided to make a stop here for lunch. 

Upon entering we noticed a long line, definitely a good sign. This gave us time to look at the menu, but we quickly knew what we wanted.  I decided on the Chickhumm ($10) - grilled chicken, arugula, tomato, red onions, and hummus on a wheat bun with truffle fries. It's very hard these days to find a delicious and healthy burger, but at SkinnyFats that won't be a problem. The Chickhumm was amazing, drool worthy. It originally comes with sprouts, but I personally don't like sprouts so I substituted it with arugula and it tasted great. The ginormous piece of grilled chicken was cooked nicely and not overcooked/burnt. The housemade hummus went perfectly with all the ingredients, no ketchup was needed!  When did a restaurant ever use hummus on a burger (not in my experience at least)? Kudos to the restaurant! The truffle fries were just as great. The truffle fries didn't come salted, but they do provide you with salt if you'd like them salted. I personally prefer my fries either lightly salted or not salted at all. I had a taste of the sweet potato fries and even though the truffle fries were great, I preferred the sweet potato fries. The best part, the burger and fries did not leave a huge grease stain on the napkins/paper mat. This definitely goes to show how much grease is actually used or the lack of. 

SkinnyFats has a wide menu ranging from salads, tacos, burgers, waffles and smoothies.  They also provide delivery to the strip, so if you're with a group of friends and want a nice affordable meal, SkinnyFats is only a call away. Unfortunately if you order at this location, you will probably have to enjoy the meal to-go since there is very limited seating. Even though the line was long, it did move. Considering how many customers they have at a given time, there was some confusion/mix-ups on meal orders of the other customers. It was quickly straightened out though. 

Overall I will definitely be coming back and trying the other items on the menu. Next up, the Ahi Tacos!",-ekA5WrEKGPp3BSLT391qA,2,2,4,JpQWfeeQ3KPBII1kCqfU3g

The menu at Skinnyfats is divided into Happy Eats and Healthy Eats.  So of course I looked immediately at the happy side, skipping the healthy side, and I ordered their Bonjour Brul√©e, which the menu describes as ""9 grain bread dipped in our egg white signature cr√®me brul√©e mixture, pan fried and drizzled with agave nectar.""  It comes with three slices of applewood smoked bacon.  There was no whipped cream as Nelson had, but it really is not needed.

You order at the counter, sit anywhere, and then one of the nicest young women brings your coffee or other drink and food to your table.  The French toast was wonderful. The agave syrup was only needed a tiny bit, and the fresh berries were the perfect topping.  The coffee was good.

While waiting, I took a bunch of photos and just enjoyed the place.  Whoever came up with the theme and the decorations was very creative and imaginative.  I want to use the word cute, but I don't like using the word cute in general.

This is an out of the way place but I can see where they would do a good business from all the businesses in the area.  I wlll be back.  This is a place to try over.  Lunch next time!  This is a place to bring out of town guests for breakfast.  They'll love it.

Located in middle of nowhere on Dean Martin Road. Place is easy to find with their smily face logo on the garage door facing the road. Ambiance is hip and cozy with limited seating.

From taco section, we ordered both taco from fat side: ahi taco-san and picata pi√±ata. Although both were flavorful, I can't handle much spiciness so I personally liked ahi taco-san better.  4/5 for ahi taco and 3/5 for picata pi√±ata.

Opted for hot mess as an appetizer. Basically a fusion nacho that comes with pieces of fried chicken topped with spicy sauce and sour cream. Indeed, it was an hot mess to eat but it was amazing. 4/5.

Two entrees, again from the fat side of menu. Steak eye is their version of chicken fried steak. It was chicken fried steak on a biscuit with creamy mashed potato. 4/5.

Bomb diggity is a BLT sandwich with lots of crispy bacon. Some pieces were over cooked and rather chewy than crispy. Simple and good. 4/5. 

All were good but nothing memorable.

Don't look like an idiot k but the water is off to the side so don't go up there asking for water.  You have to go get it yourself.

4014556,2016-07-19,6,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"With the stuff we ate...I think I'll call it FattyFATS!

Seriously...I really do appreciate the 'healthy' side of the menu - all with their multigrain protein waffles, egg white omelette with avocado toast - blah, blah, blah...OOPS, looks like the devil took over!

For this day we stayed with the 'happy' side of the menu!  Come on, it was a weekend!  We just got done mall hoppin'!  We were hungry!  So we decided to carpe diem, go for the gusto!

Actually, this technically was a 'snack' for us LOL - we were past the lunch rush, but it was way too early for dinner.  So this kinda like, lunner?  Uh, linner?  Anyway, somewhere in between.

We ended up gettin' down & dirty with:

-Chicka Wafa Dopolis - Fried chicken tenders over a buttermilk waffle w/syrup & powdered sugar

-Red Velvet Waffle w/Applewood Bacon (special) - Red Velvet waffle with berries, cream cheese frosting w/syrup and a side of applewood smoked bacon

Whoa!  Tasty crazy!  Yes, this is what you get with the 'happy' side of the menu!  Balls-to-the-walls calories!  It drives me kinda nuts when they post the calorie count of things now-a-days (thanks California), but thankfully SkinnyFATS only does is for the 'healthy' side of the menu.  My guess...the 'happy' side is drowning in excess!

I really liked their take on chicken & waffles.  The tenders were moist, crunchy, battered just right.  Sticky sweet with syrup poured all on top!  Their waffle was good as well - not dry, airy & light.  Such great textures!

Red Velvet isn't really my thing but the fam enjoyed this dish as well.  They really liked the waffle, it had good Red Velvet taste, was sweet, and the waffle itself lent a nice crunch.  Applewood bacon, how do you screw that up??

My only complaint about SkinnyFATS is that while the place is hip & happenin', it is SMALL.  Did I just go all caps on that?  I can only imagine on a super busy day they are totally packed, with a line going out the door.  Service was great, with our 1st time there our person was knowledgeable in any questions we had.

SkinnyFATS is not really near my part of town where I live, so as much as I would like to go back, it might be a while.  Perhaps I may try their Warm Springs location instead, that one is a bit closer to me.  Overall though, food is great!  I like the theme, devil or angel?  Good or bad?  Naughty or nice?  At SkinnyFATS the choice is yours!

To be noted, I'm often a pretty bad boy...heh heh heh.

The wood paneling is what I believe gives the restaurant so much character and even if it only part paneling and tile. The employees are so friendly and go above and beyond to ensure the guests experience is positive. 

This little stop in I ordered the Fried Pickles with Chipotle sauce. They ended up bringing the order to my table too. This was the first time trying this which are way better than I thought they would be. The pickles are breaded just right and the chipotle sauce does come on the side.

I came with a big group so I apologize to everyone who didn't get to sit because of us.

It's like a not entirely too healthy health cafe.  You basically order at the counter and they give you a number to know where they bring your food.

They have a Healthy side AKA the Skinny and then a Happy side AKA Fats.

Everything is reasonably priced. Considering this is sort of close to the strip, it's geared towards health, and it has unique/quality dishes the prices are awesome. 

They have a bunch of salads that are under $7 (without meat) and are big for the price.

Usually places like this try to sell you overpriced salads.

Also it's good for kids! We brought three kids who liked it. They have a kids menu which I believe is $5 a meal. The sweet potato fries and chicken strips is a generous size that most adults would be overly satisfied with.

I had a Cobb salad from the Happy side and an Asian Cucumber boat off of the healthy side with a smart water. The salad was fresh! The cucumber boat had chicken salad in it topped with teriyaki and spicy mayo sauce. Each food item was about $7 and they were both delicious. Getting two things kind of defeated the purpose of eating healthy but i had to since it was my first visit. 

The food is good, the staff is nice, it's clean, it's priced well, and it helps put a spin on healthy food while still appealing to foodies without diet restrictions.

My boyfriend ordered the More Cow Bowl and he loved it.  He's picky about how meat is cooked, and he said that the beef was perfectly done and not overcooked. The presentation was unique and the veggies and rice were flavorful.

4053728,2013-07-25,3,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Disappointed to do it, but I am docking Skinnyfats one star. This is based both on dining in once, and on the fact that they have increased prices on many of their items. 

I went in to try Skinnyfats in person last week with a coworker. It is a small room, with crowded seating. There was a line almost out the door, and there seemed to be a lack of organization with regard to people ordering food versus people picking up to go orders. 

After ordering and taking a seat at a table, we had what seemed like an excessive wait for our food, all of which came out at different times. I always hate eating while the person that is with me is still waiting for their meal... I also hate when my food is cold because I waited for my fellow diner to get their meal. 

All of this aside, the food was good. I once again had the skinny bowl, which was less runny this time around. I also had a Little Gobbler which was excellent. On the way out, I made sure to grab a menu.

Fast forward 1 week. We were all set to place a delivery order with Skinnyfats when I noticed that many of the items we wanted were listed at higher prices than the paper menu we had picked up just one week prior. Examples:

Mr.Green cold pressed juice was $7.50 last week. It is now $9.50. (All juices went up $2)
Skinny Bowl was $8.75 last week. It is now $9.75.
Flat Chix & Greens was $8 last week. It is now $9.50.

What I noticed, and was frustrated about regarding these prices increases, is that there are some items on the menu that have notes indicating that ingredients have been added to the dish, however these are NOT the items with higher prices. For example, the Drunken Gypsy Toast is the same price it was before, however it now comes with berries and bananas on top. The wrap my co-worker had a week ago is the same price, but it now has rice added to it. 

I'd understand raising the prices on items because the ingredients changed, but that does not appear to be what is happening here. It also does not appear that all menu items containing specific ingredients were raised in price, which, again, would be understandable. Instead it appears Skinnyfats just raised the prices on items at random. 

Maybe I am being nitpicky, maybe it's harsh to dock a business a star over a few bucks... But I can not honestly say I am a big fan of Skinnyfats after 2 less-then-amazing experiences and these seemingly random price hikes. A-OK is a more accurate description of how I feel about this business.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,14,4,3,RPqK_qDL-vHJP1pTmIGJ0A
4054720,2014-01-11,4,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I tell you...I need to do a better job in 2014 taking care of some of my bookmarks.  I've had SkinnyFats bookmarked ever since I read Amanda M and Nelson Q's review back in July. The gf even told me about this place and wanted to go.  She made it, I didn't.  But now I'm here. 

So if you read the other reviews, then you get the gist of what SkinnyFats is all about.  They have a ""Healthy"" side and a ""Happy"" side.  Obviously, the ""Happy"" side is your higher calorie options while the ""Healthy"" side is for those trying to clean it up.  There's a selection here for everyone, which makes this place a must try at least once.  But a place like SkinnyFats may not be for everyone.   First of all, the Healthy side isn't super clean.  It's just clean for eating out.  As for their ""Happy"" side, it's higher calorie but not crazy high.  

As a first-timer, I decided on getting something on the ""Healthy"" side. What I get? I got their Healthy Juan Wrap, which consisted of egg whites, chicken breast, black beans, turkey sausage/bacon, brown rice, cilantro yogurt, cheese and pico all wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla.  When I ordered this bad boy, I was told that the Juan had 3 egg whites and 6 oz. of chicken.  My goodness, this has to be 50+ grams of protein.  Sweet..this takes care of two meals for me.  I loved my order.  I know it's a wrap, but to me this tasted like a healthier version of huge breakfast burrito.  I killed it and left SkinnyFats satisfied.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GolhEXzqrzu1AthjhU7RFQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Now for the ambiance.  SkinnyFats is one popular and tiny restaurant.  I say popular because the lines made it outside.  This place gets crazy and loud.  And because it gets so busy around noon, our orders took some time.  So take my advice, SkinnyFats is a place to try, but not around lunch time.

I recommend the Cinnutella for breakfast.  It's goodness to the core.  It may be leaning away from the skinny side a bit but worth it.

Actually, make that months and a few extra minutes. I wasn't expecting SkinnyFats to be in a commercial area, but something looking more like a strip mall, so I drove right past them. Whoops! I stopped and reconfirmed the address, went back the other way, and luckily turned into the correct parking lot. So yeah,  they're basically inside an office building, and they have this vertical banner on a pole outside that's either green or pink depending on which direction you're approaching from.

Inside, it definitely looked like a place to eat, with some bar style seating (including power and USB charging outlets) and some tables, all done in dark wood or a wood finish. There's to-go menus near the door (useful for when there's a line), and the closest area on the counter has a citrus water dispenser for those of us who don't want to break the bank on the cold pressed juices. The menu boards are visible after you round the corner, and they're bright and clear to read.

I asked Jenn P for her recommendation and followed it exactly: Chix on Broadway ($9.50), and truffle fries as the choice for the side. It was a real treat. Brioche bun was solid, and all the fresh stuff makes it seem vaguely healthy even for something from the ""happy side"" of the menu, but the star of the show was the chicken breast. It's bread and fried to a great golden brown, crunchy exterior that holds up to the juicy and flavorful interior. It helps that there's portions of the chicken that stick out from the bread since you can go back to those and get enough crunch for the entire sandwich.

The truffle fries were pretty good, and I liked the ketchup with jalapeno for a bit of a kick (they're not that spicy, trust me), but I wouldn't say either of those are anything to write home about.

However, I found something else to like in a bite of another friend's Mr. Flapjack ($8.50). It's actually from the healthy side but tastes pretty sweet. The protein pancakes and banana chunks are probably both supplemented with agave nectar so that it's sweet but not actually all that awful. I didn't get a piece of the turkey bacon, but I would consider ordering this in the future for the pancakes and banana alone.

Not everything might be as good as what I ate today, but I was very impressed. I could definitely see myself coming back as long as I don't get lost.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,5,h-Bl53KWeWqdBGKJHKVU5w

While we were waiting though, we were able to have a cup of lemon water and have a copy of their menus to look at so we know what to order when we get to the cashier. 

My mom and I decided to share 2 waffles, the Waffle-Dopolis (something around these lines) and the REDiculous.

The Waffle-Dopolis was basically a pizza waffle. It was a plain waffle with mozzarella cheese, meat (I think ham), and tomatoes. The waffle was so soft, but not chewy! It really felt like I was eating a pizza. All the flavors blended really well together and I had no complaints.

The REDiculous was just as good. It was a red velvet waffle with cream cheese whipped cream, chocolate chips, blueberries, and raspberries with bacon on the side. The waffle as well was very soft and flavorful, and the fruits were sweet! My mom and I are not fans of strong cream cheese flavors, and were grateful that the cream cheese wasn't overly done and given in the right amounts. It wasn't too sweet and added the right amount of taste a red velvet anything would need.

Overall, along with our strawberry lemonade drink, we paid around $25. I have no complaints whatsoever about this place. Maybe they need more chairs, because every time I hear about this place, I always hear about how packed it is!

YUMMY, they also have the own spicy ketchup! Jalalujah jalape√±o catchup. BEST SPICY KETCHUP EVER!! We loved it so much we wanted to buy a bottle, ahaha funny thing was that they were selling it! But we came on a bad time, and they somehow ran out or they couldn't sell us the bottle at the time. Too bad we were leaving to Los angeles that day.... but fear no fear my cousin from Vegas bought me a bottle when she came visit me. I'm a happy camper, seriously going to buy more once I come back to Vegas!

Don't forget to take a look of their secret menu it is on their counter on their tablet, it's not hard to miss this ""secret menu""  hahaha. I really wanted to try their fried benny too! that was on the special menu, but had a craving for waffles. Ugh I should have just order it hahaha.

Love this place!! They have such a good assortment of pretty healthy, pretty quick food. Really yummy breakfast, good snacks, delish salads and much more. I'm especially obsessed with their breakfast items. I do tend to stick to the healthy side, which to be honest doesn't taste TOTALLY healthy but oh well, I'm ok with that. 

As for the service, so great!! Their staff is happy and friendly and competent. Always walk in to a smiling face. 

Tips:

Seating - you have to wait around and stalk ppl who look like they're about to finish and that is perfectly fine, in fact it's the only way you're gonna get a table.

Food - Try the bruleed french toast..yum!! Also they have reallyyy great turkey bacon so I sub that instead of turkey sausage. The slow boat to china is a good little snack too!

They offer delivery and pick up is always super fast.

It's really small inside. You order, and then find a place to sit. If there is a place. I sat down, and my husband went up and ordered. We took a menu as we walked in and used that, but there is a board you can order from as well. 

The seating is tight. There is very interesting  music playing overhead. The waitresses were quick to clean the tables and bring our food. We got the free water that tasted like lemon, lime and I swear some jalape√±o. But I could be wrong there. But it tasted spicy. 

The Cluck Moo meat was perfectly done. The avocado was wonderful. However, the egg white was so watery that I had to sop up all of the water off of my plate. My toast was all soggy. Yuk. 
The egg white completely overpowered the meat. You couldn't even see the meat in this dish. Fresh Morning  sandwich was tasty. The spicy jalape√±o ketchup was pretty good, but it overpowered the whole sandwich. 

I didn't really like that this place was so small and cramped. The food that we chose was healthy and tasty though, but not sure I will return. Food was decent, except for the really wet egg white.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,4,3,3,gLtlPPYIiyMb6TDH_14XYQ

The first two times we ordered To-go from their website and it asked us to set a time we would like to pick it up. We got there on time and each time waited over 30 minutes passed our pickup time for our food. Whenever you ask the staff what's going on they say it will be right out. We ordered breakfast I didn't understand how that could take more than an hour. After about 20 minutes we saw the server that was working the cash register when I paid for my food was now done with her shift and walking to her car with 3 huge bags of food. So the staff stopped paying customers orders to cook for another staff member. So unprofessional. I was informed by the manager they would refund our money for the inconvenience after we waited another 10-15 mins for our food. So we decided to come a second time and used the website to order again and I'm not even kidding the exact same thing happened again, except this time we waited 45 minutes. So some time had passed (about 6 months or so) so we ordered again last night and went to pick up the food and my cinnaps shake tasted like vanilla ice cream so I asked if they could remake it considering it cost over $7 and the girl rolled her eyes at me and got on the radio and said ""This customer wants her shake remade"", then I see the cooks in the kitchen look out the order window with an annoyed look and she replied to them ""sorry guys"" like I'm crazy for wanting my shake made right! I got the shake and went to my car when I tasted it there was so much ginger it burned my throat. I was annoyed so I just went home. It was like they were being petty because I asked for a new one. The final straw was when I got home and my burger was well done and beyond dry when I asked for it to be cooked to medium. I will never spend another penny with this restaurant.

We came here for one of my birthday stops, so my friends allowed me to order everything I wanted even if it was excessive and more than I could eat. That way they were forced to eat everything with me and I got to taste a lot of dishes!

We ordered:

-Wake'N' Bacon: Applewood bacon, egg Frittata, Pepper back Jack, avocado, Sriracha scallion cream cheese on a Hawaiian roll served with country potatoes. (I substituted the turkey for bacon) The sandwich was delicious! I usually like my potatoes a little more well done but they still tasted good. 

-Cherry Popper: half pound beef patty (we substituted a turkey burger), fried egg, pepper jack, spicy slaw pepper marmalade, on a Hawaiian roll. Wish I could eat this bad everyday! 

-Hot Chix salad: buffalo chicken, romaine, fried jalape√±o, blue cheese, pico, with avocado jalape√±o ranch dressing. This tasted way too good to be considered a salad! This chix was hot, 

-Balls .2-two deep fried spinach corn risotto balls with pesto aioli and bulls blood and micro greens. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Order these! These were the clear winner of the meal! Everyone loved them! 

- Frickles (off the secret menu) which are Fried pickle chips tossed in Cajun seasoning and served with our house made chipotle aioli. Yummy! 

It's super cute inside but also small. They only have about 10 tables inside if that. This place is not off the strip and we had to take an Uber here. Even though it was inconvenient to get there it was still worth stopping by! 

They serve fresh squeezed juice, shakes, and lots of healthy choices but I was not interested in any of those when I was there! You can leave skinny or fat...you decide!",59GSwMflQFllOAWvw0F5mw,78,78,4,CI5i7SeFLNQvfQp6XLtEvg

I had their chicken and waffles and enjoyed every bite. I had been dining out for so many days and although I ordered the chicken and waffles, I also ordered a fruit smoothie and I felt a bit less guilty about my meal. The smoothie was fresh, light, and delicious :)

I give one less star because we ordered a side of their truffle fries and there wasn't a whole lot of truffle flavor. We did enjoy them regardless, they were fried to perfection and we're all crazy for fries in general!

Cherry popper burger: Had some of my boyfriend's and it was so good. The burger was incredibly juicy, the Hawaiian roll was soft and slightly sweet, and the banana and cherry peppers are what makes it! Nice pop of flavor. Also, the fries was crispy and had a nice, subtle truffle taste. 

Smotherload: This was huge and filling. It came with sausage and filet mignon cooked to your liking (medium rare), eggs, potatoes, and pico. It was topped with a Cajun cheese sauce, which I thought was only okay.. I didn't like how gritty and not smooth it was as a sauce. 

They also have a secret menu! We got the Happymess, which was truffle fries with strips of NY steak, pico, and got the blue cheese on the side. Way too much food, but it was all worth it. 

For juices, we got the hangover remedy and green mile. Both were good and a perfect pre-hike boost. 

To top off the night, we got the chocolate chip cookie, soft and chewy with huge chunks of chocolate chip.

It was fairly busy when I got there. They could tell I was a newbie and the lady explained to me the healthy side and the happy side. She also told me breakfast was served all day. I had already decided to get the Chix on Broadway even before I stepped foot into the door and that is what I got. 

The verdict. A big piece of chicken on the yummiest bun with some truffle fries. I only ate half as it was hearty or maybe I was just trying to be ""healthy."" ;) the chicken was moist and tender and nothing was overly salty or under salty. My friend liked her BLT (forgot the official name) as well.  There was also Heinz jalape√±o ketchup on the table which gave the fries a lil zing.

It's located in a commercial area, so don't be fooled by the lonely buildings and empty lots. There's a trendy and yuppie vibe inside the restaurant with a cool menu that has a Healthy Side and Happy Side (aka notsohealthy). They do have a few specials featured on the flat screen that are not on the menu.

I ordered the Slow Boat to China with a side of truffle fries. Orders came out fairly quick. My Slow Boat was similar to a sushi roll without the rice. It wasn't overly spicy, which I appreciated. Wish it were less salty. Truffle fries are truffle fries-- always yummy, can't go wrong with them.

Great comfort food for a fair price. Definitely worth trying this place at least once if you haven't been here.

4271891,2014-03-14,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"So...I gave it another try. I still give it the same rating. 

I ate here a few months back and was not impressed with the food. I ordered one thing from the healthy side and one thing from the happy side. Both items were drenched in thick sauces that overpowered the taste of everything. I was disappointed and said I wouldn't be back. 

Fast forward a few months....
I decided to give this place a shot after seeing a bunch of new photos from various people's Yelp pages. I invited a few friends here for lunch. And since they've never been, I thought it would be fun to try it out. 

Once again, I ordered the Ahi Taco-San. Battered ahi in a crunchy shell. Once again, the sauce was really heavy. I needed 5 napkins for one taco. I also ordered the chicken and waffles since another friend of mine said it was good. The waffle was nice and fluffy and didn't get soggy with the syrup. The chicken had a good crunch outside and was juicy on the inside. However, the breading was a bit salty. I had my friend taste it and she agreed it was a bit salty. 

My friends ordered the BLT and the Phatty Philly. They also agreed that everything was so heavy and drenched in sauce. Neither of them finished their food because it was too much. My friend ordered a cookie without it being heated up. This was a big mistake because it was rock hard. One awesome employee, Rica, replaced the hard cookie with a warm one, which was so much better and softer. 

I am sad to say that after giving it a second chance, this isn't one of my top places to eat.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,3,0,3,6nIpTVkRLJqwF0CGCbYPtw

4285411,2014-06-15,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Seating sucks. Come when it's dead.

Trust me on this. I came here with my gf around noon and it was packed enough that we had to stand around waiting for a table to open up, and they have very few tables. 

The menu is divided up by ""Healthy"" and ""Happy"", the former is which is ostensibly good for you while the latter is undeniably not. We shuffled around the board a bit with our orders. I got Mr. Flapjack (I think that's what it was called); basically two protein pancakes (they add in whey protein powder) with bananas and syrup, along with turkey bacon. My chick went with the popular cranburkey sandwich. And we also got an order of specialty fries, that turned out to be a mistake. 

The flapjacks were quite good, as far as flapjacks are concerned. It's not exactly the pinnacle of breakfast items. I am of the opinion that bananas make (nearly) everything better, so their inclusion here was enough to make me happy. I'm also a guy who tries to get a good amount of protein in with each meal, so having 18g (is that each? not sure) added into these pancakes satisfied my needs. Turkey bacon sucks. It always sucks. No matter how good someone tries to make it sound, it's never as good as real bacon. But if you want to eat something healthier, it's there. Personally, I would've liked some applewood smoked bacon thick as Jessica Simpson's thighs.

The fries. We ordered these special fries - which I can't seem to find on their online menu, and the name escapes me - but they were a mad doctor's concoction of sweet potato fries, balsamic vinegar, feta (might've been goat) cheese, and chicken. And I think some nuts might have been involved. It's one of those dishes someone thinks up while they're high, and you'd probably have to be in a similar mindset to eat them. Did. Not.

We got there before noon and there was already a decent sized line in front of us.  The only negative would be the size of the restaurant as they do not have enough seating to accommodate the volume of business they have coming in but I'm guessing for the locals that work nearby, they probably get a lot of take out business.  I was with 2 other coworkers and we all ordered something different and each of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal and were also eying each other's choices.

Their front entrance is small and non-descriptive and it's easy to pass by when driving.

Anyways. I LOVED this place. The atmosphere, the food, the cost!

We got the chix on broadway with truffle fries, the chicken and waffles, and the chicken tenders with sweet potato fries.

Everything was delicious and not to mention the size of the chix on broadway was HUGE!

Reasons why they do not get 5 stars though:

-Menu has weird names without telling you exactly what you are getting. I had to refer back to pics on yelp to really get an understanding of what a few of the items were.

-It was our first time here, we didn't know whether to seat ourselves or where to order. Instead of greeting us, or a few other people who came in, the waitresses seemed to walk past us. We caught on by watching other people go up to the counter and order.

-location is weird. Next to the 15 close to the strip club and kinda out of the way.

I had fillet the night before and it wasn't as good as this place. It wasn't rare, but it was tender and juicy. I enjoyed the sweet and savory, but the cornbread was a little too sweet for me, so I ate it as a side/desert. 

The potatoes were were crisp and seasoned just right. 

Be careful when putting pepper on your food. Make sure the plug to fill it is in place.

Mind you when I called Skinny Fats they admitted they ALREADY KNEW they gave us the wrong bag of food but proceeded to NOT CALL US, even though they had our number!

When I spoke to the arrogant ""shift lead"" woman on the phone she did not even offer ANY apology. Her words... ""oh yeah there was a mix up and we have your food here if you want it. Its waiting in the hot box"" 

I STRESS ...NO APOLOGY! Not even offering to make our food again since by the time we eat the food it will be an hour old. Food thats been sitting around in their ""hot box"" GEE THANKS  My husband went back to the restaurant to pick up our old food. 

I waited about 5 minutes and called back to file a complaint with the manager and the same woman answered again but denied it was her who I spoke with and when I asked to speak with a manager she said none was available today. How convenient. She proceeded to ask if we wanted the food delivered at no charge.

This one happens to be 1 block south of Larry Flint's Hustler Club, but don't let that in any way deter you from trying this fantastic eatery. The name SkinnyFATS translated to various items which are low cal, vegan, non GMO and other items that might not be so much. So in essence, everyone gets covered at this establishment with no compromise on either side. 

This place is small, and the time to get your food is about 30 min with line cue, ordering and food wait. But the staff is super friendly, really know the menu and very efficient.

We had the Wake N Bacon  ($9.95) which was bacon, eggs, pepper jack, avocado, & sriracha. Team cheese on a Hawaiian roll served with a side, which we chose the sweet potato fries. A nice breakfast sandwich, easy to eat, and mild in flavor despite the sriiracha and pepper jack.

We also tried the Sweet Cheese Us ($12.95) which was shaved NY strip, pepper marmalade, Carmelized onions, pepper jack, portobello, a cheddar sauce served on a hoagie. We thought the flavor really popped, and the ingredients were spilling out of the sandwich onto our hands the way a real cheesesteak sandwich does.

Pretty diverse menu, with juices and shakes, breakfasts (served all day), salads, tacos, burgers, and bowls bother meat and vegan.

I loved the fact the had a variety of food here! Especially the shareables on the menu! I wasn't very hungry and was pleased they had that! 
I will definitely check this place out again! I'm curious to find out what is the best dish here ! 
- also the staff here seemed to be very friendly and helpful when other customers were inquiring about the menu!",o-B9uwfa1RDJ4QCO0yzYXA,0,0,4,zD0NepuZhihK4Xku6fhuyQ

The concept really attracted me to this place. I love the idea of being able to get healthy food and splurges in the same spot. So far I've only had splurges, but I plan to dig into the skinny side on my next visit. I also love a spot that serves breakfast all day.

On my most recent visit I had the Cherry Popper. Popping with flavor it was. The 1/2 pound beef patty was juicy and the perfect size for the bun. Banana and cherry peppers made it unique and really added something to the flavor. You can never go wrong with a fried egg that leaks liquid gold all over the burger and bun. As if this combination wasn't already enough they top it with a slaw and pepper jack cheese. It sounds like a lot, but the flavors really work well together.

On my other visit my husband and I split the Chix on Broadway and The Classic. Both were large portions and very tasty. I loved that both were loaded with ingredients and flavor.

The burger was pretty big in size. Happy to have split it. It tasted pretty good.

The truffle fries were disappointing.. Very bland/no salt really.

Inside was very very crowded, but I did overhear one of the waitstaff talking about how they were expanding (maybe he was talking about something else...). It was a bit hard to order and not be on top of someone that was eating. It was just very cramped. 

We ordered a green smoothie and breakfast burrito. Now, I know a green smoothie is a big of a gamble...but, it tasted horrible - mostly like grass clippings. Maybe they could try adding some agave to take some of the edge off. The breakfast burrito was amazing though and a huge portion. It was probably one of the better burritos I've had!

4424981,2014-03-22,5,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Skinny Fats is my dichotomy of wanting good, healthy food but not wanting to miss out on the bad stuff that's soo good. I definitely came late to this party, but better late than never.
The only reason I've ever come down this part of Dean Martin is to look for tile & flooring or show Panorama Towers. Now it's to come to Skinny Fats for their Chicken & Waffles...listed only on their ""Secret Menu"" that you can access online.
The food is good enough that you won't mind getting into near fights or at least shooting dirty looks at patrons who tend to push chairs back into you due to the seating area being so cramped.
You've already read how the menu works from other reviews. Basically good side and evil side...aka healthy and happy sides.
Ordered tonight was the more cow bowl (happy side) which looked good and had nice pieces of tender beef. The slob cob was good but the ranch dressing is the best part.
Truffle fries were ok. Cool mame (ranch edamame) was different and nice.
Best part was the Chicken & Waffle. Wow! All white meat perfectly breaded and seasoned atop a waffle doused in syrup. Even my wife who does not normally like fried chicken (I know, what's wrong with her right?), couldn't keep her fork off my chicken & waffles. She needs to get her own next time!

I must say that I was pleased with the food and service here!  I like the array of food and drink choices!  They also have a secret menu that has more deliciousness if you care to indulge!  I had the Bonjour br√ªl√©e and I was pleased with the French toast!  It was accompanied by turkey bacon, that may have been delish but I wouldn't know because it wasn't cooked well enough so I just opted to not even eat it!  I also had a chai tea that was great, nothing too special there!  

The downside that I see is that the restaurant is soo small, and maybe understaffed.  As I was leaving I wanted to try one of their create your own Juice/shakes but the line was literally out the door!  People were waiting for seats!  The second we got up from out table, there was already another party sitting down and the table hadn't even been cleaned yet(it wasn't dirty by far, pretty much just dishes).  However, they do offer online ordering, so more then likely I will utilize that option and not even chance not having a place to sit!  Overall, great concept, great food, great customer service!  I will return!

I had the Juan Healthy Wrap, which was jam-packed with protein and HUGE. It got a little soggy, probably from the pico de gallo, but it was still tasty. My boyfriend got the Drunken Monkey Cakes, and our friends got the apollo fries and the Slow Boat to China. All of our food was good, and it came out pretty quickly. Everything was pretty reasonably priced, too.

Why three stars? I didn't see much on the menu that makes me want to go back and eat there again.

It's a small quick service restaurant located on Dean Martin where you wouldn't exactly expect to find a restaurant. Inside there's a few tables and bar top seating against the the walls. You order and pay at the counter and the workers bring the food out to you as soon as it's ready.

The menu has a unique concept that matches the name perfectly; ""skinny"" (healthier) items and ""happy"" (delicious, fatty, the last thing you should consider eating on a diet) items. The menu is also very diverse, including a variety of breakfast items and lunch entrees ranging from seared ahi tacos, turkey stuffed peppers, tofu fried rice, to a classic cheeseburger. 

I asked the young lady working the counter what she recommended on the skinny side and she said her favorite was Smoke in a Bowl, a dish with BBQ chicken. She asked if I liked spicy food (which of course I said yes to) and she strongly recommended the CauliFIRE, which is cauliflower tossed in hot buffalo sauce and topped with garlic and pico de gallo. I went with the second recommendation and added grilled chicken for some protein. I also had to try one of their juices so I got the Liquid Defense (orange, lemon, lime, apple, carrot juice) which I was a big fan of. My friend went with his go-to chicken and waffles.

The food came out within 10-15 minutes and I enjoyed my dish! It was very simple yet satisfying. Cooked cauliflower and strips of grilled chicken tossed in their spicy buffalo sauce. Came with celery, carrots, and fat free ranch too. It was definitely good, but not anything that blew away my taste buds. I did order from the skinny side so I have to take that into consideration...

My visit to SkinnyFATS was long overdue and I'm glad I went. Friendly workers and a fun menu concept. I get why people like this place. I will definitely have to come back and explore a few of their ""happy"" menu items next time!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,10,5,4,gUvSycAnRTJ_4s_sFVzBkg

On my first run at this place I probably would have given 4-stars, but I'll say my rating is more like a 3, but bordering on 4, if they fix a few issues.

First off the place is small, too small for the amount of traffic it gets. I realize they can't do anything about this, but still. Secondly, I waited for my food FOR-E-VER the last time I was here. Eh, I know these can be day-to-day issues, I'm not docking them for it, it's just me being a whiny patron.

Here's the real deal - I ordered a Cranburkey with a side salad. The salad came out with the ranch cup tipped all over my salad. Presentation not so great. Salad - good. Next came the Cranburkey. Presentation - terrible. I'm used to following SkinnyFats on Instagram and their pictures of their food looks SO GOOD, and so nicely plated. So, I was disappointed. I thought, the taste will make up for it!

The Cranburkey had a dry bun. The turkey was cooked well enough - but kind of bland. The cranberry-type gravy was all right, but not enough to have me desiring it again. The arugula-mix on the burger was wilted, and not terribly fresh. I picked a bunch of it out. Overall - an OK meal, therefore my rating is ""A-OK"".

Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Excited to talk & recommend items.

It has about 50-60 seats. Very busy at 11am. 

It's about 5-10 minutes from strip.

The only issue was seating, as it was quite busy during dinner time, but it all worked out. One of the young ladies actually helped me move my food to a larger table when it became available (we initially fit 4 people at a table for 2). 

Now to the food. I ordered a Vegwich with sweet potato fries and it was delicious! I absolutely loved the 9 grain toasted bread. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and my stomach was completely happy after that. The only bad thing is I did not notice the scrumptious looking cookies in the display case until after I had already ordered and paid. At the conclusion of my meal, the sugar cookie beckoned and I responded appropriately. If you order a cookie, definitely take them up on the offer to heat it.

Ambiance is awesome, vibrant colors, clean and a fantastic and fun menu.

We ordered the Slow Boat to China, which is a snack, of Asian chicken salad on a cucumber boat-fresh, delicious and filling! We also had the Waffle Mountain High since they serve breakfast all day (winning). Again, fresh and delicious.

Also tried the Mrs. Green smoothie and the Nutty Nana Flat. Everything is fresh and fantastic.

We can't wait to go back and try more menu items we couldn't consume today (they even have a challenge to try everything on the menu and receive 10% off for life)

First the location is a bit...out of the way. They mentioned a 2nd location opening soon at Decatur & Warm Springs. Parking was OK. We went around 1230pm on a Sunday and it was jam packed. Seating is super limited...people will hover to get your table when your are nearing completion of your meal.

It was very clean. Even though the tables turn over at lightning speed, the staff was on top of wiping them down. I, also, noticed things like a customer a few tables over dropped his silverware & without skipping a beat, a staff member brought a replacement. Also, a different staff member saw a straw wrapper on the floor and picked it up on her way to do something else. My husband works in the restaurant industry, so I've been trained to notice these things.

Service was super friendly and helpful.  You order at the counter, TRY to find a seat, and they give you a number to put on your table for someone to deliver to you. They know they menu really well so they can answer questions, offer suggestions, or make substitutions.  Also, even though we didn't notice our food took a while...the guy who brought the food or to us, apologized & gave up a free cookie!!

I had the Bleu Balsamic which for some reason I thought was a sandwich, but s actually a salad. It was AMAZING. It includes shaved beef, which many places fail at and it can be tough and rubbery. Not here!! It literally melts in your mouth!! My husband had a Sweet Cheese Us without the portobello & truffle oil. With 2 drinks, it came to about $20. The cookies are big and baked to perfection. The chocolate was high quality too...the chocolate chips just tasted chocolate-ier than what you expect. In fact, everything we had was really fresh & you could tell.

I would absolutely go back here, there are so many menu items I want to try, especially the Sunday Sundae. I cannot wait for the next location to open!!",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,0,0,5,vXsQpMo7LDTecz5YnMlxKQ

This time we got a bowl, smoke in a bowl with jasmine rice and naked chix with cauliflower rice.

Five stars because the smoke in the bowl had amazing flavor, it was similar taste to provencale sauce and nice tender chicken. The naked chix was very similar but milder and had plenty of chicken but the cauliflower rice. 

We have breakfast here about twice a week as we love this place and are excited they are opening more establishments around town.

They keep water with lemons and cucumber on the counter for your convenience, and I only wish that the cups provided were a bit larger. I'm sure I could just ask for one next time. 

I decided on Berry the Steak, a flatbread with feta and goat cheeses, steak, arugula, berries, and balsamic reduction.

Facility: it was like a fast food spot, where you order food at the counter. It's kinda a small place, with tables and chairs squeezed in tight. 

Service:  they bring the food to your table after you order. The waitress was nice and checked on us once too. 

Food: they have. Avery unique me I, but we weren't super hungry. So, we decided to shared an order of Truffle Fries (3.5/5) that were hot and tasty. However, sometimes, I think places try to hard adding stuff, when hot fresh fries with salt are truly the best. 
Then we ordered the Cheesy Peezy, (3/5) that was exactly that...cheesy.  It was a decent crust and good flavor.

Maine wedge add steak!! The dressing mixture has egg, blur cheese, cucumber, red onion, balsamic demi, and ranch. I LOVE this salad it makes me, well, happy!

Ahi taco san- sooooooo yummy the puffed tortilla gives awesome texture to the tempura ahi and the mango salsa adds a freshness to the taco.  

Jazz hands float - sounds crazy right? A sprite float with mango. It's amazing!

Phatty philly- order this with extra blue cheese. This sandwich almost requires a fork and knife because there's so much meat!!!! 

Does the location suck? Hell yes! However even with my 2 kids and husband we almost always get a table.  If you're eating solo the bar stools are the way to go.

UPDATE: I have now been here a second time, I don't eat meat so I got some kind of hoagie sandwich that normally came with steak on it. I asked for a vegetarian version of it. I'm just gonna say,it was some kind of amazing. It was a little on the spicy side I think there may have been banana peppers on it I really didn't stop to seriously look what was on it because it was just that good.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is because of the size and limited seating.

The employees were very friendly, and the interior itself reminds me of a restaurant you'd find in LA or NYC- definitely not typical Vegas. The menu was a great concept- healthy versus happy choices- but somewhat unorganized and difficult to understand. They were very accommodating to any dietary requests, which I know can be difficult in this day and age. 

The food was incredibly fresh and yummy!! Sweet N Spicy milkshake- apple, ginger, beets, banana- and Drunken Gypsy Toast- cr√©me br√ªl√©ed brioche, fresh berries and bananas (I certainly got a lot of bananas, didn't I), and applewood smoked bacon. So delish!!

Ok we were totally lost when we walked in because all that we saw was a line.  Naturally as fine citizens of America, we just stood in line with everyone else. Lol.  Yes, not knowing what it was for.  An employee saw how confused we looked and gave us a little explanation that it was the order line.

So first, it's open seating.  So if you are trying to come with a big group, you are better off dining outside.  May I dare say that it is almost a fire hazard in there?  You can barely squeeze through to use the restroom, or maneuver your way to exit too.
When tables or chairs come free, it becomes snatched up with a quickness.

I say study the menu and know what's on special.  They call it skinny fats because you can choose your evil...healthy vs some extra flavor!  The menu was a bit different because it's bunched differently then what you are normally used to.  The division of sandwiches, salads, etc. yah it's not like that.  well as I finally came around to see the board menu above, it was easier to read.  However, I was instantly distracted when I saw the eggs Benny special they had.  It was poached eggs on steak sitting on cornbread.  I think the cornbread just seriously set it off.  The flavors were sooo good.   We ordered truffle fries as a side and that just complimented it.  Ok I lied, not complimented it, we just like variety.

I was having a severe allergy day and was overwhelmed by the amount of noise. I believe almost every table was full. The lights were dimmed & the music was turned up. The inside feels very homie. Beautiful art on the wall. Quick friendly service. A lot of delicious choices. Almost didn't know what to order because everything on the menu looks like it would be satisfying. 

I ordered the meltdown (patty melt). I ordered it medium rare. Came out cooked all the way through but I didn't mind because I was starving. Truffle fries on the side complete the meal nicely. I feel like the burger had a lot of meat. I only ate half. 

Person taking my order was amazing. She offered me bacon and avocado on my burger which after being offered I just couldn't say no. Great Up Sell!! All employee encounters were amazing. Friendly people working quickly and efficiently. Now that I think about it I am amazed that everyone worked so well together. I have had a lot of bad service lately and can really appreciate the great service I received here. 

Food came out hot and fast! Great food and great experience even though I wasn't feeling good.

I like how they break it down in the setup of the menu also. It's very easy to see which route you wanna take, healthy or happy. The names of the food items are very witty and cool.
Went with the Sweet Cheese Us without onions. It was basically a glorified cheese steak sandwich, which was made to perfection. The meat was cooked well and the toppings and cheese were complimented nicely. Opted for a macadamia cookie for the side which was good.
My wife went with the Mega Club sandwich which she said was very good. It was very big and filling.
The ambience of the place was cool.  The workers were very nice and the girl that took our order was personable. I like that the location is off the strip which makes it easy to get to, and there is plenty of parking.
My only knock on the place is that it is a rather small restaurant. There was a bit of a line when we got there,  and seating is rather limited. Larger parties would definitely have trouble finding seats. We ended up getting our food to-go for this reason,  which wasn't a huge deal but it would have been nice to eat there.",AHaFry0BEa-lgOo_H8NTvQ,1,0,5,qBTdvSOg3K1SbyfY52i51w

Seriously though, this place has great food. 

The menu has two sides, healthy and happy, but there is lots of each to find in the other. The healthy dishes are very tasty, and the happy dishes are very flavorful while remaining mostly healthy.

I love tuna, so I found the ahi sirachi to be an amazing mix of flavors, while consisting of healthy ingredients like the vegetable slaw, mango, and a wheat tortilla. The ingredients seem to be of a high quality as well.

I'm mostly a carnivore, but the veggie sandwich even had me drooling. There are several other kinds of dishes I already want to try.

The one drawback is that this place may be too popular, especially given the smallness of the location. Finding seating can be a battle; at peak hours a large group might be hopeless.

The art on the walls is fun and not overdone. Oh and I actually bought one of their shirts and wear it often. Not only to rep the restaurant but mostly to rep the message on the front -- ""live happy.""

First off, if you don't know about this location's whereabouts, you'll miss it if you're not paying attention. Which almost adds to the lore of the place!! Wizardry at work here people. SkinnyFats knows exactly what they're doing. Small dining room, just big enough for the amount of people that can find, or know about, their spot. Super wavy decor. On point. 

Secondly, it's smart to opt for the secret menu for creativeness, i.e. ""Balls 2.0"". Wow. Just wow. Deep fried corn and risotto balls, in a creamy sauce of epic proportions, with micro greens and a plethora of flavor happiness!! Every time. 

Now for the rest:

Kids food is so fun here. ""Clucky Toes""= chicken fingers + side of choice. ""Nutty Banany""= peanut butter and banana on multigrain toast. Yum! 

""Cranburky""= a cranberry and turkey party, with sage and some festive seasonings on a whole wheat bun with lettuce and tomato. ""Naked Chix""= grilled chicken breast in an awesome mango salsa sauce atop brown rice with cilantro-yo!! Light yet flavorful. Truffle fries are always a must. Crisp and savory.

We ordered the Wrap Supastar (chicken, spinach, egg white burrito, Cajun cilantro yo, avo pico) from the all-day breakfast section and the Smoke in a Bowl (agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onions, pineapple, black bean salsa, cilantro yo, jasmine rice) from the Things in Bowls section. The Wrap Supastar is served as a wet burrito with the Cajun cilantro sauce drizzled on top. Loved the flavor and liked how it didn't leave you with that heavy feeling you can get after eating regular burritos. The Smoke in a Bowl was sweet and tangy. They were very generous with all the ingredients which made for a satisfying meal. 

Tips:
* Call ahead to check on the wait time. Calling the number on the Yelp profile will take you to the main number for all the locations, so make sure to choose the correct one. 
* If ordering to-go, you can order online.
* Parking is available but most of the nearby spots get taken first.",UWFbLqeESDZ5754Ekt3Wzg,2,1,5,GEBXWl7VBHGLvdZLejcPdg

Menu has a lot to offer for any craving. From fresh to juices to savory dishes to sweet and delectable goodness. I am a total breakfast junkie and to come across the Strawberry pancakes, with brie and Glazed Balsamic just made my heart pitter-patter. 

It was everything I expected and more. Perfect portion, sweet, tart and savory. Who came up with this concoction ? I'd like to give him/her a BIG High 5 !!

Staff is super friendly and just beaming with smiles. Not too big of a space but crowd flowed smoothly. Water with cucumber lemon was a help yourself and soda offered was made with Cane Sugar.

The nice to Greek you could be best described as a chicken feta salad on flatbread and I loved it I also ordered the skinny q since the portions on the flatbreads are small and wasn't as big of a fan since it ends up like a flatbread chicken BBq sauce philly and I'm not a huge fan of peppers. The smother load was pretty good but the order came out wrong the first time which isn't the first time it's happened here seems they struggle with custom orders since they are usually such high volume.

It's basically the best idea ever - especially for a co-ed lunch or dinner.  The concept is that one side of the menu is super healthy, and the other side is indulgent.  I've tried several things (on both sides of the menu), and EVERYTHING has been incredible.  My favorite item, believe it or not, is the buffalo roasted cauliflower.  It's like chicken wings without all the guilt...DELISH!!

They have incredible and innovative bennies on the weekends too - I keep meaning to go!  The food is on POINT - Chef Josh Green is legit.  The service is great, the portions are perfect, and even the ambience is fantastic.  The only thing I initially thought that was weird is the location - but considering that a.) they deliver and b.) it's near an office park, it's actually not that weird.

Located in an industrial park, there is a giant billboard sign with an arrow helping drivers where to pull in from Dean Martin Drive. Although the space is small, it runs quite efficiently and the staff are all really helpful. They explain how the menu works with one side being healthy ""Skinny"" like salads and wraps and the other side ""Fats"" being the more indulgent items on the menu. Either way, the big bright menu is very easy to read and just about everything looks good. Coffee, eggs, and pancakes are available for breakfast and I will be sure to try some of those goodies next time since I was here for their lunch menu. I ordered the Chix on Broadway with a side of truffle fries and they were both really good. Big juicy chicken piece and not too salty fries. I would order it again.

 Since it is in an industrial park, the space has limited seating, so I personally would grab to to go, unless you come right when they open. Maybe not so great for large groups, but they do offer catering! Overall, great service, cool menu, and decent pricing.

4704453,2015-07-27,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"My friend began as a follower of this restaurant on IG. When we decided to make a trip to Vegas from California we decided, this is the place to go! The moment we arrived into the strip area, we came to try this place. The location is kind of weird. It's away from the strip by 10 minutes or so, and it's not in a plaza. This place is located in an area filled with industrial and commercial buildings. There's plenty of parking and service is very fast!! You can look at all their food on Instagram as they like to showcase their food there. 

The line was not long, the restaurant is a bit small so when waiting for a table it can be kind of long. You take your own table so you have to fight and compete. I remember when we came here, someone argued with my friend about a table. Anyways, they're portions are HUGE!!! We ended up taking everything to go and eating it in the middle of the night after clubbing. I ordered their fried chicken sandwich because when I went up to the cashier and asked for recommendations she said this one would really fill me up. The price is a bit higher, but the portion is CRAZY. My friends order a burrito and burger and they were all HUGE!!! The truffle fries here are also AMAZINg! I would recommend ordering different things with friends and sharing to try it all!! They also have plenty of shakes and smoothies to try!

4715589,2017-08-28,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Well, to start out I found this place thanks to Yelp. Really off the beaten path, which is a good thing. We do not want to have to walk a mile for food or deal with the usual Vegas strip crowds. It was worth the hunt to find this little gem. We enjoyed it so much, that even though it was one of our more expensive meals, we had planned on returning a second time to eat here in the same Vegas visit (but we went home early instead) 

The food is GREAT! I love the unusual offerings. I love that they give you both healthy and not as healthy options and tell you which is which. I LOVED the drink options and we really enjoyed the drink we bought and kept the cup too, very cute. The service was great and the people working there are very sweet. 
So, why only 4 stars? Well, I kinda hated that it was such a small area to eat and we were stuck cooking in the sun while we were there. Every time a table would open up in shade, someone else would grab it and that's understandable, but you can see how it's time to expand right? lol  and the other thing was, I kinda hate that it came to $40 but I had no leftovers or that you don't get much food for your money. The only other meal I paid more for was AYCE sushi. When you are attempting to budget your meals, you want more for your money. That being said, I would rather spend my money getting good tasting healthy food and they deliver. You just gotta make eating there more enjoyable somehow. Second location?

4721013,2017-07-03,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Stopped by here on the way home from the other side of town and was pretty impressed. It's menu is split between healthy options (skinny) and unhealthy options (fats), thus the name.

The left side of the menu are the skinny dishes and the right side has the fat dishes. The calories are listed on the healthy side, though not on the fat side. Some of the calories for the healthy dishes are ridiculously low. They also have vegan dishes on both sides of the menu. Prices are in the $8 to $13 dollar range.

This place is about as hipster as it gets. The walls seem to be made from re-purposed wood and the small dining area is full of the hipster crowd. This is the type of place that focuses on organic, local ingredients and serves their togo food in compostable boxes. It's a pretty casual environment, and seems like a great place to grab lunch.

I got the spicy filet mignon sandwich and my wife got the steak breakfast burrito. We also got the cucumber asian chicken salad as an appetizer. The chicken salad was the only thing we ordered from the skinny side of the menu, and it was delicious. The chicken salad paired perfectly with the cucumber boat it is served in and was made even better knowing it had such a small caloric impact on us.

The breakfast burrito was very good and smothered in a gravy sauce. My sandwich was pretty good to, but it wasn't worth $13 considering the serving size. The filet was tender but I felt like the sandwich would be just as good with roast beef for a few dollars cheaper. I also got the pita bread and hummus for my side dish and I loved it.

I found this place to pretty intriguing and I want to come back and try some more of their original dishes, especially on the skinny side of the menu. My biggest criticism is that their prices seem to be a little too high considering their portion sizes seem a little small, which seems to be the trend at hipster places.

If you want to try some original and healthy dishes, this place is worth checking out. As someone whose looking to lose a few pounds myself, I want to come back. It's the perfect spot for people to go where someone is on a diet and the other person isn't.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,1,2,4,4N2W-MNxmujH4HXVtoGimw

It's so hard to find a ""healthy"" restaurant in Vegas without paying an arm and a leg for, or without it being ruined with something so unhealthy. At skinnyfats you get the best of both worlds. Perfect for the dieter, and perfect for that hangover cure from your late night out. 

After a hard work out I typically stop here and grab my lunch, I'm not shy to indulge in their healthy side as it is so delicious I feel as if I'm eating from the happy side! I have no favorites and I have no complaints as everything is delicious! The cute cashier with a quirky fun personality adds spunk to the dean Martin location.

For the area it definitely beats out the other few options. Our office has been ordering nearly everyday since they opened. They would occasionally mess up the orders, but small things ( no tomatoes , dressing on the side and so on.. ) not that big of deal. Then it started to really go down hill once they became popular.  Our office favorite is the ""Flat Chix & Greens"" . Which at first came with a side . Now it does not. Not the end of the world. They then raised the price a long with nearly everything else 20% plus. Then when you thought it was going to stop there they decreased the portion sizes. I got 4.5 oz of chicken today compared to the avg 7.5oz+ . I guess back to divine cafe :(

Ps. On multiple occasions ""Not believing it was being caused by the juice"" I have ordered their ""Mr.Green"" every time this has completely messed up my stomach . I have done multiple day juice cleanses and drink green juice regularly. I'm not sure what is different in theirs but it messes me up.

The online order registered as a pick-up order, so I called the location and Matt was happy to change the order to delivery, and it still came 10 minutes earlier than quoted.  The entire staff was quite happy with the food, and no one ate dinner because we were so full from lunch!

I got the Bomb Diggity, a fair sized sandwich, big cuts of bacon, delicious.
The fried chicken and bacon sandwich was pretty huge and had to be finished at home.  One of the staff said she was dreaming about the Teriyahi that night.

The decor was nice. The interior designer was very cost effective and creative.

The service was good. They were very nice and attentive. 

I ordered the naked Chix, sweet potato fries, and green mile. My friend got the chikhumm sandwich and truffle fries. 

The naked Chix was delicious and the fries were perfect. The green mile is tasty but too sharp. It was not for me but I would definitely drink it if I felt like crap about my body or was bloated. The green mile makes you feel that all the alcohol, fatty foods, and bad gunk in your body will be cleansed and washed away. 

My friend said her sandwich was good. I tried one of her truffle fries but I didn't see it as amazing. It reminded me of normal fries with salt.",qUOAHz2esWlb9QoZ29xZ9w,0,0,4,WGooydH0Gw0F6r8Yrz9w7Q

Pros , new menu, fresh feel, cool decor. I love roscoes so when I saw they had chicken and waffles I had to compare. While theirs is tasty it just doesn't compare to roscoes. But if your in the health craze you'll love it, staff is also really nice and pleasant

Cons- it's extremely small. Seating is first come first served. So it's a 
Little awkward trying to stake your claim to a table when the people are just getting up and leaving before it's been cleaned and reset.

It took us a while to find the place because the sign isn't too big and it looks like a little hole in the wall. We passed by it twice until I realized that it was the place! Also felt kind of stupid because there was a HUGE billboard sign that said ""SkinnyFATS is here""! 

I was actually surprised because I didn't take the time to read previous reviews and only looked at pictures of the burgers rather than the inside/outside decor. The place is small! Felt very cozy in there, and it was a bit packed when a got there with a few seats by the window open and two tables. As soon as you walk in the line begins, and you place your order and then sit wherever you like. 

I never understood why it was called SkinnyFATS until I looked at the menu and saw that one side was for those who wanna go a healthier route and another side for those with no limitations! There were two employees at the front and one acknowledged me and gave me an insight of the menu and what they had which was good! The girl taking my order was nice and helped me choose what to order/what would be the better option! 

I ordered the cherry popper burger with truffle fries for my uncle and I got the classic burger with truffle fries and two drinks for us. The food was served to us shortly after.

If you're going to get a side, please get the truffle fries. They are AMAZING! The best I've ever had. Most restaurants will put too much truffle to a point where it overpowers it and you don't even taste the potatoes but these were perfect. The burger was just as amazing as the fries!! I wanted to buy a bottle of the chipotle ketchup but it slipped my mind because I was too focused on how good my food was. 

Will come back as soon as I can to try their other options and also try breakfast! Very impressed with this place!!!",TdanXiUczuft0sh3ZNg5ZA,2,1,5,ftKWkmu5kDtBT-eOBL6mSg

Not only is the name creative, the food was spectacular. They have something for everyone, from smoothies, juices, burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, appetizers, salads and sides. You can opt for a healthy veggie side or go with some yummy truffle fries. You can have an all fruit drink to an awesome 100% cane sugar soda. As for me, well I took the fatty route and went with the fries and soda. 

I ordered the steak eyes. (2 biscuits, with 2 pieces of steak dipped in a country style badder, 2 pouched eggs, and sausage gravy) omg, it was bomb!! The meal is very filling, and could of been split. I couldn't even finish it and I left stuffed. The biscuits were soft and moist, the steak was a good and tender, the eggs were on point, and the crazy was flavorful. I highly recommend this breakfast choice, especially for the egg Benedict lover. 
My wifey ordered the filet o fire. (Filet mignon, avocado Pico, jalepeno spread, on a garlic Texas toast) She loved it and was very impressed for being a sandwich. The truffle fries were good and reminded me of Gordon Biersch garlic fries. Yummy. We also ordered the yummus (hummus with pita seasoned in a lime sea salt).

Food. Was. Amazing! My sandwich tasted like it came from some swanky over price placed. I inhaled it, so good. Sweet potato fries, yum! 

Everyone was friendly, came over to talk to us, and everyone had their favorites to suggest. I love that. You can tell they love what they do.

I've had their gluten free flat bread ""Berries the Steak"" ($9). It was absolutely delicious. Just the right about of sweet and tangy. I loved it so much, I ordered it every time.
My bf has tried the ""Nice to Greek You"" ($7) flatbread and liked it, but if you don't like olives, there's olives in there. He also has tried the ""Cherry Popper"" ($12) burger with the hawaiian roll and egg in it and he claims it to be one of the best burgers he's had in Vegas so far (We've tried Bachi already).
My friend had the infamous ""Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis"" ($12) aka chicken and waffles and it was extremely delicious. Super tender chicken and flaky crusting.
I've also tried their fresh juices and they were pretty kick-ass. I just thought they were slightly overpriced (ranges $8-9.50) which is pretty much the price of my meal. 

SkinnyFats has not disappointed and they have very friendly and attentive staff. Food is very well priced. I'm super excited they are going to open a new location in SW soon! They really needed that because seating is limited at their main location. When you get there, find your seat and you order at the register. Plenty of parking and located in a commercial building area.

But these truffle fries....! No words. They're soft and oily..but in a good way. Not heart attack oily, but healthy oily! (Or so it seems) Definitely my favorite new fries in town, and that is not an exaggeration.

The only things that irritated me was that the coffee seemed illegitimate (so I didn't get any) and getting there the first time was awkward because maps makes you take weird streets. And it's in a busy industrial center. Make sure to CALL & ORDER AHEAD!! It will save your life.",Nqyt9hbngXXdOw9dS5Up7A,1,5,5,if-zacN9pyZ7KEtPhmJKEw

I went to Vegas for a friends wedding and happen to see the place on yelp and decided to go for dinner first night we were there. We learned why places called skinnyfats..they have one menu with healthy items and another not so healthy. Genius idea!!! We ordered tacos and pork sandwich that were unbelievable.  It was so good we had to go again next day.  We went for breakfast and had egg white and chicken wrap and wheat waffles. Again beyond delicious.

The first time was because of the rating... than the second time was a few weeks ago.  My friend really wanted to eat here.   My memories of this place is...... The music is way, way too loud.  I can't even hear my own thoughts.  LOL.  Seating is the worst ever.  It's borderline annoying.  The first time, we got a table and it was dirty so we moved to another table....it was dirty too.  I had to ask twice for someone to come clean it.  It wasn't too crowded.  Not sure why the guy was not having it and said to me he's got it, after I waved down someone else to clean it since it's been like 5 minutes.  

Food is whatever.  We ordered a burger, chicken tenders and a salad.  Burger looked delicious, very messy to eat and it was ok....It made me crave the Carl's Jr Guacamole Bacon Burger right next door, that's not a good sign.  Buff chix was alright, I'd had better.  The salad was a salad...  Coffee is crap.  I really feel like this place is one of those IG spots, where everyone just goes here to be seen as they eat healthy...order food take photos and don't even eat it and leave.  It's not cheap here for whatever food and their portions are smaller.

4868104,2014-04-17,3,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Let me start by saying that this place has a very weird location. When this place started up, it got a lot of hype, mainly thru the social media sites. This joint is located by warehouses and factory offices, which seemed a little out of place. 

I decided to check this place out with a very good friend of mine. Upon entering, I noticed that it's not your typical restaurant. It's a little too congested for my liking with very little room to move about. The tables felt very cheap and light and the chairs aren't sturdy. More so, the place was jam packed when we went. 

Skinny Fats caters to a niche' which seem to belong to the health conscious, gym goers and people that are watching their weight. While they try to market all these ""healthy food""  and various substitutes, I can't help but notice that most people that eat here are either gym rat elitists or the annoying calorie counter snobs. 

The first thing that caught my eye is that the prices are crazy expensive, especially for the size portion that you're getting. I understand that you're paying more since they ""supposedly""  use ""healthy""  ingredients but $9 bucks for a smoothie? Definitely gonna be the last time I'd order something like that. My friend ordered a salad with some chicken and a blended shake which cost her $20 bucks. 

To be fair, this review is more on the atmosphere and the vibe that it gave me rather than the food itself. My friend enjoyed her lunch so ultimately, I guess that's what counts. 

I definitely won't be a regular at this place but would I come back? Sure, I'd be down to give it another go. Maybe my perception will change but until then, it's an overpriced health nut food joint in my book...",A872opA-l6OeCy9x1b2QFw,3,2,3,V2rR5qnN_YIABf4dQjzuaA

It is in the front row off the plaza, to the right of the billboard.

Same delicious food as the other locations.
This trip our table had smoke in a bowl, the meatloaf sandwich special and the Benny special. Don't forget the frickles!!!!

Always get the frickles. Lightly breaded, you get a crunch and get there pickle flavor. Most places bread so heavily you don't know you're eating a pickle.

Smoke in a bowl pleased as usual.

Meatloaf sandwich had mashed taters on it. Was very tasty and quite the mouthful.

The Benny was over a fried backed potato which was my last favorite base of any of the Bennys I have had so far. The flavors worked well together.
The poached eggs was a solid yolk, this seems to be standard, out of the five Bennys I have had across the three locations I have had one runny yolk.

The skin on the chicken and waffles was crunchy and seasoned to perfection.  
Not kid friendly in the sense that there is no SPACE for kids, tables are packed tightly and you're literally bumping chairs with other tables.  There's a wait to order your food, but the staff is honestly probably the best part of the restaurant.  A bunch of young kids with great attitudes.

I'm lucky to be friends with girls who love brunch just as much as I do. So we all decided to give this place a try! We took the taxi here and though it wasn't the cheapest ride (approx. $30 including tip for a one way trip from our hotel on the strip), it was the last thing on our mind after eating an amazing meal at SkinnyFATS.

Between the four of us, we ordered the WTFrench Toast - a delicious french toast with turkey patty, cranberry sauce, arugula & spicy berry marmalade ($10), the UnBRIElievable Brioche french toast - french toast served wit brie, basil, strawberries, and a rich balsamic glaze ($9.50), and their special of the day, BACON POT PIE BENEDICT ($12). Both french toasts were equally amazing. The WTFrench Toast was fluffier and lighter, yet it still managed to pack a mean punch of awesomeness. The UnBRIElievable was more sinful - french toast was perfectly fried to a golden brown color and the combination of the brie and balsamic glaze gave it a richer taste that excited the tastebuds.

But the winner has to go to... *cue angelic music* the bacon pot pie benedict. I've never had anything quite like it! It's not a dish you want to eat all by yourself... but I definitely ate 80% of it. The dish comes with a miniature pot pie stuffed with diced bacon pieces, potatoes, peas, and carrots. On the side, it came with one egg Benedict and a large fried jalape√±o stuffed with a mystery stuffing.. that was just as amazing!

4926712,2014-02-06,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I finally understand all the hype about SkinnyFats after my first visit last night. The restaurant is appropriately named to describe the menu exactly. On one side, you have a healthy (skinny) variety of choices, and on the other, you have a plethora of happy (fats) dishes.  Both sides have some seemingly delicious choices, but for me, happy always wins if I'm eating out since I always eat healthy at home.  

The restaurant itself is tiny, with about 8-10 tables total that seat 2-4 people.  Don't expect to be able to have too private of a conversation with your dining companions as you will be as close to the table next to you as you are to each other. In addition to the tables, there is a bar that is lined up against the wall as you walk in with maybe 8 additional seats.  You first order at the counter and pay for your food, then they give you a number that you can set on your table, if you're lucky enough to get one, so they know where to bring your food out. I've heard this place is chaos at lunch, but since it was about 7:30pm we were able to get a table as soon as we walked in. 

Onto the food!

Chix on Broadway w/a side of sweet potato fries ($9.50): This massive chicken sandwich is not your ordinary plain dried chicken breast on a bun. Ooooh no.  This is much much more.  The chicken breast is lightly breaded and deep fried and so massive that its ends stick out of the delicious soft brioche bun by at least an inch or two on each side.  It's topped with w/cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion & lemon aioli.  This sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The chicken is tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned.  This was by far my favorite of all the stuff we ordered. The sweet potato fries are thin cut and perfectly cooked.  They weren't out of this world, but still yummy.  5/5

Cheeseburger Benedict w/a side of truffle fries ($10.50): Everything about this burger was great, but it wasn't mind-blowing like the Chix on Broadway. It tasted like a good burger.  The egg yoke created a bit of a mess but my bf liked wiping it up with the bun. The truffle fries were good, but they just tasted like regular fries with a bit of garlic on them.  4/5

Smoke in a Bowl ($9.50): My friend ordered this from the healthy side. The flavors  of everything in it would make it seem like it should be bursting with more flavor, but it was just ok. It had big chunks of bbq chicken mixed in with pineapple, brown rice, peppers, onions, salsa, and cilantro lime yogurt. 3/5

The staff was really friendly and personable.  Our food came out fairly quickly and they were also quick to clean our plates off once we were done eating.  I'm really excited to go back.

Menu - Very expansive and requires some studying and many items on the menu are unique and quite creative.

Location - Odd at at best. 

Prices - Fantastic prices.

Quality of Food - Darn good and very different!

Quantity of Food - Just about right. Some humongous burgers.

Nutritional Value - This is why they get a minus 1.5 star.  No nutritional information on their food. No known idea on grams of sugar in their foods, or even the carbs, or the cholesterol.  They talk and create a menu that has many buzz words that sound health like add protein, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, yogurt and all.

I had the Balsamic Bleu bowl. The steak was fantastic. Piled high on spinach salad, this was one of the most satisfying meals I've had in the last twelve months. 

On the negative side, the restaurant is amazingly small. When ordering, you can get your food to go or gamble that you can find a table. You'll have better luck planning on getting your food to go. Despite the volume of business, there is only one order taker and cashier. You can wait 20min just to order at lunch time. 

The front office staff do a phenomenal job. The kitchen staff, however, have room to improve. During the extraordinarily long wait time, I saw the front counter staff dump three fully prepped meals in the trash because they weren't correct. I saw two more meals sent back right from the service counter.

Granted, Skinny Fats charges enough money to do this. Nonetheless, it's disappointing to see this kind of food waste just because the kitchen can't follow the food orders (otherwise this would be a five star review).",QfnRnti_FolkrodhZYFP3w,0,0,4,DeVSSsqO-oJyAABmvVcKSg
4947955,2015-07-19,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"This location is very small and only offers seating for about 20-25 people.  Be ready for battle!  Most of their dishes are better when consumed immediately (the no soggy zones in life are slight glimpses of the promised land).  This is definitely not a place for group outings, and although high chairs are offered for the babies (looking out for those new parents), it's not the ideal setting for them.  I recommend driving out to the Warm Springs location because it offers more space.

Now let's get into the food!  The dishes have always been a hit or miss.  Some keep me coming back, while others are a one time experience.

The Yasssss:

$10 Chix on Broadway (Happy): Breaded chicken tenders cooked to a crisp thrown in some brioche and topped with cheddar (mo chedda mo betta), red onion (make it grilled), BLT and lemon herb aioli!  

$3.50 Ahi Srirachi (Healthy): seared ahi thrown into a wheat soft taco and topped with mango pico de gallo and spicy yo-aioli.  3 of these bad boys make the perfect meal!  Great mixture or sweetness and spice!  

$7 Buff Chix (Happy): breaded chicken tenders tossed in buffalo sauce.  The tenders are served over truffle fries.  It's hard to go wrong with tenders.  The chicken was still nice and juicy after being breaded and fried, but not enough sauce was provided.  Upon request, I was provided more sauce.  The fries are very thin and nicely seasoned!  I vote yes!

$10 Wrap Supastar (Healthy): grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, pico de gallo and egg whites wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla!  The wrapped burrito is drizzled with Cajun cilantro lime yogurt and some more pico is thrown on top.  The ingredients say breakfast, but this hits the spot any hour!  Everything harmonizes well together!  

The Pass:

$12 Chick A-Waff-A-Polis (Happy): the waffle is a nice size, but is very dry.  It's on the thicker size, so one would expect differently.  The batter leaves much to be desired.  The fried chicken was dry and therefore lacked taste.  A side of syrup was the only accompaniment.  I recommend going elsewhere for this dish.  

$11 REDiculous: the red velvet waffle lacked flavor.  This waffle was extremely similar in taste to the regular waffle sold and leaves one to assume that food coloring was the main addition to the batter.  The waffle was dry and left much to be desired.  The cream cheese frosting and chocolate syrup complimented the raspberries, strawberries and blackberries that were use as toppings!  The berries are large in size and in all honestly the stars of the dish, followed by the applewood bacon.  The waffle should be the main star of the dish for the listed price, so I vote pass!

I do have to compliment the restaurant on its customer service.  The entire staff was very friendly and attentive.

Hubby and I had the flat chix which was white meat chicken topped with baked corn, onions, and arugula. This sounds very healthy but is delicious. 

We also had the Vegwich. This is a sandwich with portobello, avocado, tomato, peppers, and spinach. It's quite spicy but so delicious. Plate came with fries.

Two of us got their daily special sandwich which was their salmon parm hoagie... OMG the bread was so light and the salmon cooked perfectly - big and juicy with lots of parm cheese and that tomato sauce!!  I was SO stuffed but it was SO GOOD!!!

My girlfriend loved her teriyahi - which is seared teriyaki ahi tuna with a citris slaw on 9 grain bread... so light and tasty - paired with their awesome sweet potato fries!!

And the last dish was the Thai Cobb which is a salad with their perfectly cooked warm teri-salmon with romaine lettuce, mango peppers, bacon and a yummy sunny side egg!!  I wish I had enough tummy room to eat that TOO!!!

Service as usual was AWESOME... they are so good to clean up the tables right away and will help get more chairs to so everyone is seated.  Wish they had a bigger space but we made do!!

I really love looking at the Happy side of the menu lol but when my dad go the healthy side I was a bit jealous...I was just looking at the colors and I'm like really? Technically my dad got the healthy version of my version. He got the fresh morning sandwich (Egg whites, saut√©ed spinach, turkey bacon, tomato & agave ketchup on a honeywheat roll w/fruit ) and I got the chipper morning (Scrambled eggs on Brioche w/Applewood bacon, cheddar, tomato, avocado & spicy aioli w/SF potatoes ) Though mine was good...I just couldn't help looking at his...so sad...What's funny is that my dad ordered the truffle fries and that was pretty good too probably because the day before we had parmesian truffle fries from somewhere else that wasn't that great.

My mom got the drunken monkey cakes..Buttermilk pancakes, maple glazed bananas, graham crackers, marshmallows, chocolate w/Applewood bacon Oh yeah! that was just off the charts good...lol I mean this made me sooo happy! :D

This place is a little hard to find. I mean it's so easy when you know where you're looking.

4989834,2014-06-27,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I really wanted to like this place.. the concept is fun and cute, but its a miss for me.

I (partly) can't get behind the concept because I don't know how they break down and define the skinny portion of the menu versus the fat side.  

Is it skinny because its low calorie?... well it doesn't seem to be very healthy.  Most of the food seems loaded with sugars and fat free ingredients.  Which isn't my idea of healthy nor skinny.  However, if you compare the skinny to the fat side, you may be doing a little better but I still can't be sure without more information on the menu. 

The menu is confusing already, so it would be great if they simplified it and added some more information or details about what you're eating.  (i.e. Organic, No GMO's, Fat free, Low Calorie)

Also, I didn't feel that the flavors were well developed.  They seem either too salty or too packed with sugar.  This was my biggest issue.  I've been about 3 times and I've been disappointed each time.  

I think this place has great potential and would love for it to improve, but I can't give it my recommendation.  

Interior is cute, staff seemed nice, wait time wasn't too bad, I like the self seating, but its a very confusing menu and concept that I can't agree with.... However, I hope I'm wrong. I hope that skinny means healthy with quality ingredients (Organic, low salt, NO GMO's, etc. ) and not just low calorie with lots of salt and sugar or a fat free salad dressing versus a regular salad dressing.",W5UE4LllnPipYa0470mIwA,8,4,2,YYjVzFJqUvy1jXAdISXyXw

5013548,2014-12-19,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFATS is not located next to any other restaurants and sits in a parking lot with these other shops like a wood floor store. I enjoy the concept of SkinnyFATS, and their menu is easy to see, the restaurant is a first come first seated place, and you order at the counter and they will bring you your food. While it isn't a huge place, which means it will get easily crowded, my friends and I were lucky to grab a table in the corner. Now back to the concept of this place, on one side of the menu you have the Healthy (skinny) and the other side you have the Happy (fats), and on the back of the menu you have the drinks that range from sodas to the healthy juicers like vegetable fruit juices. 

A lot of their food ranges from sandwiches, burgers, tacos, bowls, and they even serve breakfast all day. I originally though ""man the Happy side does like delicious"" but I actually ordered two items from the Healthy side which was the Ahi Srirachi taco (Happy side has tampura ahi tuna tacos) and Naked Chix (a seared chicken bowl served over brown rice).

Naked Chix - dish was light and delicious, while the chicken was sort of bland, the brown rice was great and the whole dish worked with the mango salsa it had on it, the bowl also comes with a yogurt sauce which went interesting with the chicken. 

Ahi Srirachi taco - a rather big taco for only $3.50 and it has nice flavors to it, it is also light and has a great mixture of mangos, some slaw and a delicious srirachi aioli sauce. There was plenty of tuna in this taco as well.

Awesome service, and all the workers were quick and very helpful in explaining the concept to noobs like us and what's their favorites.",DFih6Bhiw6_slNN5z39c4g,1,2,5,U9nwRSCIVXbWqxknsDsNLw

I ordered 2 Ahi Tacos from the Healthy Side of the menu and the Slob Cobb from Happy Side. The tacos are huge. I could barley finish one! The mango and sriracha are a perfect blend of flavors! My mom ordered the Bombdiggity. It had a ton of Applewood Smoked Bacon and a tangy aoil that works so well with the toasted Sourdough Bread. Of course I could not forget my husband on this visit and ordered him a Chixs on Broadway with Truffle Fries to go. He was very excited to get Skinnyfats all the way at his office in Green Valley.

5018257,2016-05-01,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"My 100th review!  Woohoo.  Went to skinny fats for lunch today with some friends and we ordered a whole bunch of stuff to share.  I love the concept of this restaurant that separates healthy vs. happy (aka fatty) items on the menu.  They also have lots of juices and salads for the health conscious.  We ordered 3 things from the unhealthy menu and 1 item from the healthy side.  We got truffle fries, smotherload breakfast burritos, sirracha ahi tuna tacos (healthy) and the stewy Benedict.

The good:
Fries were yummy.  It goes well with the jalape√±o ketchup.  The portion size is very generous.

Breakfast burrito - it had steak, sausage, peppers, potatoes and salsa on top.  It also has a delicious sauce that goes on top of the burrito.  It was very flavorful.  Again portion size is huge.  

The ahi tacos are individual orders.  We got 3 for 3 people to share.  It comes on a whole wheat tortilla.  When i first bit into it, I can tell that the fish is not that fresh.  But all the salsa, sauce, onions and mango masked the taste.  I guess youre supposed to eat it all together and not just taste the fish itself.

The bad:
I didn't really like the stewy benedict.  It was a huge biscuit with an egg on top, hence the benedict, and its smothered in a beef stew.  It was a little salty for me and there wasn't that much meat either.

Next time I come back I defintiely want to try more of their healthy options...especially the juices and not succumb to the bad influences of friends who wants to eat everything off the ""happy/fatty"" menu.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,1,1,4,d_XVVXI3b9m3l8n28H7j9A

5029900,2017-05-29,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"This is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas. I tried it a year before I even moved to Las Vegas when I was out visiting here and I fell in love. They have a healthy and happy side which is perfect because you can eat here no matter what mood you're in. Since I moved out here I started going to an aerial studio right around the corner from here so most days I would come to skinny fats after my classes to eat. I used to come so frequently that one time one of the employees nominated me customer of the month (which is awesome that they show customer appreciation like that). Me and up to 15 friends got a free food party! It was awesome. To this day almost 2 years later they still recognize me and welcome me back every time I come in. It feels like home. 

I also love that they have a secret menu and every weekend they have a new Sunday and Benedict. If you follow their social media they post amazing food porn and you can see all of their specials and hidden items. I

So now onto my favorite dishes since I've almost tried them all. From the healthy side are usually go for the chickhumm, which is a grilled chicken breast sandwich with beet hummus. I also really enjoy the ahi tuna sandwich and the new vegan kale Caesar salad (not on the menu, you have to ask for it). 

From the happy side, my number one favorite dish in the entire restaurant is the big Parm. It is not on the permanent menu but it is on the computer that has a slideshow of hidden dishes on the secret menu. It's like a chicken Parmesan sandwich. I also love the buff chix, which is buffalo chicken tenders on top of truffle fries. There truffle fries are amazing I crave them all the time. 

Honestly you can't go wrong here so try something new every time and I promise you won't be disappointed!

Edit: I did forget to mention the one negative thing I have to say about this location specifically. They are always packed and they always have a very long line. Especially if you go anywhere from noon to one.

More like, I've heard so many great things about this place and really wanted to check it out before I left. This night was one of the best decisions I made that day. 

Located in a pretty weird strip mall on dean Martin, next to Wendoh Media and Vegas Seven. The surrounding businesses are a bunch of auto shops and stuff. Very odd, however, it wasn't sketchy. I overheard their staff say there's another location opening up north. Sounds like they've hit some success and needed to expand! Speaking of their staff. The staff was super nice and personable. They recommended things to me, made sure to mention the specials and super accommodating . There were two tall guys and next to them, what seemed like a very short girl. Great team, nonetheless.

Overall, the place is a bit small. Grab a table for window seating fast! In this joint, there were decorated wooden paneling, tin roof panels, an electronic menu, a butcher block type counter, and dark wood floors. My impression was a very modern look with a backyard flair.  Here's what I had for dinner:

On special, the Parmesan Crusted Halibut for $10. A nice cut of halibut, pan fried with Parmesan, panko and coconut. It sat on a bed of pico infused brown rice and served with grilled yellow squash. Holy macro, this was AH-MAZE-ING! The fish was moist and flaky, The crust brought a crunchy element but wasn't heavy at all. The rice with pico brought a super clean taste and the soft squash brought the dish full circle

Tu-Nuts for $9.50.Spicy ahi & sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki, avocado & sriracha aioli. We asked for the teriyaki on the side (it still tasted great without it). I LOVED THIS DISH!! Highly recommended :) The concept of using the cucumber as a boat was genius, but them you add in the spicy tuna, the crunchy and flavorful slaw and avocado, you've got a perfect start to your meal. The sriracha aioli, was definitely a great enhancement of the dish. SOOOO GOOD!

What I really loved about this place was the menu offered very healthy conscious food, the food comes with a lot of cultural diversity and the portions are huge! It's kind of located in an odd area of town, but trust me, soooo worth it! After a nice hike or dinner after the gym, SkinnyFATS will not disappoint.

The BF were at a awkward time where we needed to get something to eat, but not be too full so that we couldn't eat dinner later with friends so we decided to split some items. 

The Cherry Popper came recommended by the guy at the counter so we went with that. Now I loved the flavor components, enjoyed the banana peppers and sauce, but the burger was way too wet. The patty came piping hot and was not rested so the red juices were still oozing out and the slaw/banana peppers were also wet ingredients that contributed to the lake the bottom bun sopped up within minutes. No one loves wet bread so they should toast the buns well, let the meat rest and strain the accompaniments to make this burger the superb star it could be. My picture shows there is a puddle between my burger and fries. You get a choice of side and we grabbed truffle fries which I thought was seasoned perfectly and had a nice crisp. I like that they offer jalapeno ketchup as well on the table! 

We also got supposedly the most popular item on the menu according to the guy at the counter - the seared ahi taco. We just picked the two popular items to try than delve off it. It was just aight. The components were fresh enough, but the flavor wasn't anything wowing. Good, not great. I also am someone who believes deeply in heating the tortilla to give it a nicer pliable texture but this was just straight out of the bag wheat tortilla. After the fact I see in pictures CRUNCHY tacos and on their website describe a ""puffed shell"" that probably would be way better and my opinion would have been different. We weren't asked if we wanted crunchy or soft so I don't know if you have to ask or they substituted.

I like the ideas of what they are doing here, the menu ideas are all very enticing. Maybe it was a slightly off day, but it's the execution that fell short for me. Details make a winner. If our bun wasn't soggy and our tortilla was nice and chewy this was a very easy 4 stars. I will be back though to give them another shot though as I suspect there's gotta be something bringing people to this inconvenient location. 

FYI There will be a 2nd location opening up on Durango and Warm Springs which while not in my hood, is very convenient as we're always at our friends home in the SW.

I have tried EVERYTHING on their menu. 
So far, my favorite on the Happy side is their Filet O Fire. And the healthy side has to be their Naked Chix bowl. I'm also OBSESSED with the CauliFire shareable! 

A couple substitutions if you really want to feast on grease; I would order the secret menu fries ""Happymess"" but I would order it without the NY shaved steak as it can be a little chewy if not eaten right away. 

The Big Parm on the secret menu is only 11.95 and totally worth it. 

And their Frickles (AKA fried pickles) are 4.20 and for that price they taste like a million bucks. 

I like to sub my Naked Chix with Cauliflower rice instead of jasmine or brown rice. Always good to add in those extra veggies whenever you can! The rice doesn't change the taste at all, it's still delicious!!!

But the other couple behind us who grabbed a table before the order was made also want to move to this table. We had a confrontation and the restaurant management offer no help at all. The management should put up signs to tell people not to grab tables until they pay for their order. They should also hold taking eat in orders until there is tables free.

Skinny Fats, home of the HAPPY (pre new year, yay!!) and healthy (post new year, boo) menu.  To their credit, the boo menu is tasty.

Straight to it, familiar food.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing over the top.  Solid but not perfect.

The turkey burger (cranburkie) is well made.  Good texture of the burger managing to stay moist with the addition of cranberry and topped with a cranberry yogurt and loads of peppery arugula, semi ripe tomato, and sharp red onion.  OK but desperately needing more salt to bring out the turkey flavor.  The naked Chix (pan roasted chicken breast topped with a mango salsa and sweetened mango basil sauce with a side of cilantro yogurt) is well made.  Well cooked chicken, the salsa and sauce could use more spice heat to balance the mango flavor.  A side of Yummus (rosemary hummus) with it's inherent creamy richness and herbal finish pairs well with the selections.

From the HAPPY menu,  props to the Sweet Cheese Us, a great take on the Philly cheese steak (thin slices of still juicy beef with cherry peppers, deeply caramelized onions, portabello chunks, and a slightly spicy pepper jack, cheddar sauce slathered generously atop).  The Cherry Popper ( 1/2 lb, juicy, dripping burger topped with cherry peppers, a spiced up slaw, pepper jack, and a dripping fried egg to cool it all down in a sweet bread roll) not far behind.  Messy and simply good eats.

One thing, avoid anything ""truffle"" (ie truffle fries).  Synthetic truffle oil.  Ack.

I think something like a sign at the top or like some tape on the floor would give a better indication of what to do.

The service was great! The workers would ask what we wanted to drink before we got to the front of the cashier so it would speed up the process since it was a long line.

I ordered the Pigzza. Now, reading what it said made me want to get it even though it was early in the morning and I didn't want to start my day off with something too heavy. However, I wasn't too high on any of the other dishes they had so I decided to get it. The pizza itself was a little doughy; the toppings were good but it was just smaller than I thought.

I got their Cheeseburger Benedict (lettuce, tomato, red onion, cheese, avocado, some kind of delicious sauce, and a nice runny egg) which has everything I like on a burger. If I could ""build my own burger"" this is precisely what I want on it. They give you a choice of sides and I got the salad. It's a good size salad with romaine, tomato, and onion served with ranch. Nothing to write home about, mostly because in America you don't write home about a side salad. 
Everything is served on actual plates and metal silverware, which when I wasn't expecting, but it was a nice touch.

5125498,2015-01-07,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,My boyfriend wanted to grab some healthy breakfast on our drive back home from Vegas. I saw that this place had tons of great reviews so we decided to check it out. When we walked in we were greeted by a waitress who was very friendly. She explained the menu and how the whole happy and healthy thing worked. Their menu is very diverse with lots of great options. I liked that they had a special vegetarian menu as well. I got the Liquid Defense Juice and my boyfriend got the Beet It Juice. We also ordered the Very Berry Strong Waffle and Vegwich. The portions here are generous and everything tastes delicious. The waffle came with a mint yogurt sauce which was different but also tasted amazing. I loved their spin on a classic berry waffle. If you are ever in the area this is definitely a must try! It's a pretty small restaurant so make sure you get there early for breakfast unless you want to wait a long time since seating is limited.,D5JJ-kP9sBrWaoUNmz8wYw,1,0,5,m1nAe599ibnzBo4wBHLz_w

A couple years ago I discovered SkinnyFATS and I must admit I was not impressed with their food. After a few years of boycotting this place, I decided to give it another shot and I'm glad I did. I've heard from other people that some things on the menu are hit or miss. Which I completely agree with. However, I was very satisfied with my recent order of the cranburkey burger because of all the flavors the burger had to offer. I also like that it comes with a side. The only negative feed back I have is from my experience of choosing a fruit side for both occasions that I've had the cranburkey and I've noticed the fruit is really soggy and not freshly cut. 
I'd still give this place a five star review because the actual taste of the burger is more important than the presentation of the side. 

The fried pickles are fantastic also. The portion size is big enough for 2-3 people.

Glad to say, it is a solid place to grab some grub!  Is it GREAT?  I'd say no, but it is GOOD!

I went with the Burger Benedict ($10.50): 1/2lb Angus, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickle, Avocado, Fried Egg, Skinny Fats Sauce and Truffle Fries. Burger was juicy and messy. Good taste overall, but I couldn't really taste the SkinnyFats sauce and nothing really EXCITED me about the burger.  Still good and big portions, but being a burger LOVER myself, I don't think I would order it again.

The fries were good, some were very truffle fragrant, and others were a little tame.  But considering the price of admission, they are a GREAT choice of a side, and I would order these every time I am here!

Also tried the Fresh Morning Sandwich ($8): Egg Whites, Sauteed Spinach, Turkey Bacon, Sliced Tomato, Agave Tomato Ketchup, Multigrain Kaiser Roll, and Fresh Fruit. Tasted HEALTHY to me lol...good, but Cathy enjoyed it.  Might fit the bill if you are looking for guilt-free food.

And to drink, we tried a 32oz ""Create Your Own"" Shake ($8.50): Strawberry, Banana, Frozen Yogurt, Soy Milk, and Double Nutella. For having double nutella, I couldn't really taste it, but the strawberry/banana was blended smooth and had a nice taste overall.  Drinks felt a little expensive here, so we shared a large one for a better deal.

I'm sure I will be back at some point :)

They give you that healthy balance feel here with their all American style menu with a pinch of diversity. It's always fresh and fast for the most part. I recently discovered their Hot Mess shareable appetizer which was probably my favorite. I believe it was pita chips style nachos with buffalo chicken bites!! It gave me a little inspiration to create something in my own kitchen that hopefully will taste half as good as here.

It's very small so if you plan coming here with a group you should come before they open. It's an open seating type restaurant where you order in the front then you sit at your table and wait.

Now let's talk about the food..

#Happymess (4/5) basically truffle French fries with steak,Pico de gallo, gorgonzola cheese crumbles. Really good actually I would definitely order it again.I would only recommend it had like a sauce smothered on it or some sour cream. Would probably make it better

#merica (3/5)-is what I personally ordered. I'm a big fan of chicken fried steak and eggs and their version had biscuits instead of toast and what is really missing from this dish is flavor in the gravy and the biscuits weren't that great plus when I'm eating this I love some hashbrowns or country potatoes which it didn't have.

# REDiculous (4/5)-red velvet waffles!!I really like how this dish was put together all the flavors were there and everything but the bacon needs some work 

# Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (5/5)I think this was my  favorite dish very simple and just finger licking good..you can't really go wrong with chicken and waffles unless your waffle is messed up or your chicken is lacking but both paired up well together.I would also order this again

Overall I would definitely be back to try other things but I would hope that they could add some more things to the menu because it seems very limited and I think it would be better if they had more of a variety for breakfast.",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,0,0,4,nKuBOfznXgXh3hU1P5uDew

5200453,2018-04-19,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Vegan/ Vegetarian Review: 

       Everytime I visit Vegas, this is a must stop place for me since they have Vegan-friendly items (after modifications) and I'm always traveling with carnivores, so it's a nice compromise.
       
         While I wouldn't say the vegan items are amazing overall, it's still pretty impressive for not being a vegan joint, and all of the people I've introduced the place to, enjoyed their food and ambiance.
    
What I've tried:

Vegwich (veganized) - 3.5/5 (2016)
       A grilled portabello mushroom cap topped with spinach, peppered spread, tomato, avocado, and an aioli (which I subbed for hummus).
        I wasn't entirely blown away with the flavors. It was a little bland and oily for me

Mean Bean Burger - 4/5
       A house-made Bean patty topped with greens, red onions, tomato, avocado, and spicy hummus between wheat buns, this bean Burger was one of the best and hardy Bean burgers I've had in a while. I also slathered on their chipotle hotsauce which I'm addicted to. Haha
While it was messy to eat, the flavor of the Patty was on point and I would stick to this Burger over the Vegwich

Caulifire - 2.5/5
       I'm not sure if these guys are meant to be fried or not, but they're not crispy at all, and had way too much hotsauce which made them more vinegary than need be (for me at least). But they always seem appetizing in pics, so I've gotten them a few times since everyone wants to try them, but I keep forgetting how 'meh' these are.

Picatta Pinata (Cauliflower taco in 2016) - 2.5/5
      Discontinued, and for good reasons... It was kind of a mediocre taco. It had veggie tempura (weren't very memorable) and pico de gallo.

Zucc it - 3.5/5
        For a healthy zoodle-pasta dish, it wasn't half bad. It had eggplant, squash, peppers, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes in a red sauce.
I had just a few bites from my friend's dish, and thought it was delicious for what it was. Great for those who want a lighter meal. 

Orange Julius (veganized) - 3/5
         Just sub the yogurt for soy milk. I just wanted the cute cup. Haha The soy milk wasn't creamy enough, but that's expected.

Overall, it's a solid New -American eatery with a cute motto. You can ""be healthy""or ""be happy"" with your food choices, since they offer both light and heavy meals, veggie and non veggie, without the cost of flavor (For the most part)

Although I found the cauliflower items to be duds, the sandwiches are pretty good, and so are their fries. My meat eating friends also enjoyed their meals, hence why this place is a keeper. :D

I went down a star, as there were a few duds with their veggie items, and this is a vegan review afterall despite what they think... Haha

That's the great thing about this place, they are Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten free friendly, although I am none of the above I think it's nice for them to accommodate those who are. It even provides personal knowledge for customers like me who are pleased to learn that Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten free dishes are indeed one of the most delicious ones! The first couple of visits I ordered from the healthy side but this last visit I wanted to have a HAPPY lunch so straight to the FAT side! Haha!

I brought family in town here around 11:30am and it was super busy!!! There was a line to the door and the dinning room area was totally full, there were people eating outside on the curb and the table next to the restaurant. I stood in line for about 20 to 25 minutes but it gave me time to look over what I wanted to order because I was contemplating over the happy side dishes. I ordered the ""More Cow Bowl"" and my fianc√® got the ""Swinetology"" and ""Charlie Brownie Shake."" Our total came out to about $32. My cousin-in-laws ordered the fries & chicken strips for their toddler and burgers from the healthy side. 

After ordering we managed to get a table that just opened up and waited for about 15 minutes until our food came. They took a while for the shake, it came about 5 minutes after we started eating our food. On the table they have napkins for you, different ketchup sauces, and some jelly if your order had toast. Mine and my fianc√®' dish was delicious! Their truffle fries with the Swinetology was the most perfect pairing. I left satisfied and because they were busy there were people trying to claim our table already so it was pretty awkward to rush and finish up our food with people standing next to your table waiting. lol I think that when they get busy like that they should have an employee direct table traffic or they should expand!

Today, after a medical test, I found myself with a little time to kill before I had to head back to work, so I decided to stop in.

What a great concept.  A menu that is healthy, and happy!
As Nikki, my cashier, explained to me, the options on the happy side aren't necessarily ""unhealthy"", but there are slightly better versions of them on the ""healthy"" side of the menu. 

I love it.
There were tons of items to choose from, and I can tell you for sure, I will be back, and SOON to try as much as I can!

Today, in an effort to stay on my healthy living plan, I had the ""Smoke in a bowl"", which was Agave BBQ chicken, with peppers, pineapple,  and onions over brown rice, with black bean salsa,  and cilantro lime yogurt.  

Ok fine, I had the truffle fries too. 

The chicken bowl was a decent sized serving...a bit more than I could eat, but not an enormous (ridiculous) portion, either.  It was full of flavor.  I really enjoyed the pineapple bits!  

The truffle fries, I took to go, and ate when I got to work...well...most of them.  I was pretty full, but they were good.  Not too heavy on the truffle oil, and they were cooked well.

I REALLY enjoyed my visit.  
Lets talk about service, too, shall I?
Nikki was phenomenal.  
I told her it was my first visit, and she explained the menu to me, in detail, and even chatted with me a bit after I had ordered.  

It looks like this place gets pretty busy, and its not a big location, so you'll want to try to avoid standard ""lunch times.""  I got there about 11, and it was empty till about 11:15.

-Hard to find in the middle of a business center
-Barely any room to sit
-Food from other orders gets mixed into my breakfast pancakes... I wonder how that happened?

To elaborate, I ordered the pineapple pancakes (which were delicious btw) and there were some carmelized onions cooked into part of the bottom pancake that clearly did not belong. Probably a part of some egg scramble someone else ordered that got left on the pan. Which begs the question: How often to they clean the pans they use? On the other hand, it shows that they cook all their food and don't just heat up frozen meals (like some places I know)

Interior is nice, but that's about where it ends. had a breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, tomato, avocado, and some kind of Aioli. Well, this was about the blandest sandwich I've ever had. they made the eggs 7inches in diameter while the bun (and don't be fooled, the ""brioche"" bread was nothing more than a hamburger bun. no taste whatsoever of any kind of ""Aioli"" in there, and the avocado was not ripe and had a weird lemon taste to it. The potatoes were literally cubed and over-fried pieces, and there were many ""crumbs"" included. Pricing was definitely above where it should be. Next, sampled the pancakes with bananas and chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. Yeah, portion here, way too big, and it was diabetes in a plate. This may be opinion, but trying to make it into a meal by adding bacon on the side doesn't bode well. This was definitely one that you'd have to share with a large table, because no one person can fathom eating this. Coffee was average. Took a long time for service. Probably won't be back.

The Happy Mess - it's a bowl filled with truffle flavored fries, thin strips of steak and topped with tomato salsa and LOTS of blue cheese. The fries and steak themselves are really good with the ketchup. I don't think the cheese and salsa go well with fries but that's just me. Next time I think I will stick with the plain truffle fries instead.

More Cow Bowl - a rice bowl filled with teriyaki beef, pineapple sauce and vegetables. They used too much sauce which made the whole plate super sweet and heavy. We hated this item.

Ahi Tacos - I didn't try this item but my sister said it was okay. Not great, not horrible.

Edamame with chili garlic glaze - The edamame was drenched in a sweet glaze. I think I prefer regular edamame with sea salt better.

Over all - I'd come back here for fries but I'm not too crazy about the items we ordered.

Minus one for being overcrowded to the point that people are pressed against each other waiting to order, get food or find a seat in this  tiny place.
Also another minus is the food was cold when it was brought out and the famous chicken burger which was the best tasting item we ordered until we saw it was still partially raw, a HUGE no no especially since it was my son eating it and I had to tell him he could not finish it once I saw.
I did really like how friendly the service was, but waiting over half an hour for cold food was sad.
Also the portions are really small, I should have ordered more, but the prices at least to me reflected the portions would be larger than small plate bites.
The brussel sprouts were great, but very small portion, same with the fish taco.
Being that they fried the shell to order, it was soggy and cold, cold fish, also not that great.
The sauce that came on it, was fantastic, I see SO much potential!
My husband liked his philly and fries, but again it was cold and not as great then.

When trying to find this location,  you miss it since the cute eatery is located also in the strip mall location.

Inside: cute and decorated with tables and table top service, you order first before seating. Best part, you pick where you want to sit, however, try coming when they first open or when the lunch crowd leaves. It can get a bit crowded. As you walk further in, they have their menus. They have sharables, sandwiches, burgers, and then some to order from. 

Since my fiancee and I have been eyeing this spot for quite sometime we ordered the following the first time around: fried pickles, the meltdown w/side of truffle fries, the hoagie w/truffle fries, one cream soda and a black cherry soda. 

The food: omg, mouth watering, just enough, creative names, and a weekly addiction! Fried pickles were awesome. Sweet and sour taste, ginormous portion and still tastes good even the next day. Perfectly fried all around! The Meltdown, was the best pattie melt that I had in ages. Evenly buttered bread, perfectly cheesy, and that sauce they use will make you take a bite one after the other until you realize you have none left. Loved it! I even ordered it a second time around when we came back. The truffle fries, perfectly cooked as well!! Precise and on point. Not oily or salty, and a must have if you never tried these ever in your life. Hoagie was a bit smaller, but was enough to suffice a huge appetite. What added to the entire meal, the sugar cane sodas! They become addicting, and not the usual fountain sodas you see at other places. They also come in cute refillable cups.

On Sundays, they alternate different brunch specials. I decided to try their special that day. It was a Mushroom Benedict made with spinach, eggs, and shrimp. So flavorful!

After feeling like an absolute fatty from eating at a buffet last night, I decided to order from the skinny side. My friend went for the fat side. I got a fresh morning sandwich and truffle fries. My friend got a burger Benedict with truffle fries. We shared a 32oz shake with banana, strawberry, frozen yogurt and of course, Nutella. 

Fresh Morning Sandwich:
Turkey bacon, egg whites, saut√©ed spinach, tomato, agave tomato ketchup on a multigrain kaiser roll, and a side of fruit. I had no guilt eating this sandwich but it's quite filling that I had to take half of it home. Good thing it already comes sliced in half. Everything in this sandwich tasted fresh. I love egg whites and find egg yolks disgusting so I love egg white sammies. The kaiser roll was a tad bit dry though. 4/5

Truffle Fries:
Skinny fries with chopped parsley and drizzled with truffle oil. Their version is pretty good. Some were a bit soggy. 4/5

Create-Your-Own Shake:
We chose banana, strawberry, Nutella and frozen yogurt with soy milk. A yummy shake with less guilt. I appreciate having a choice of 2% milk or soy milk since I'm lactose intolerant. Sharing might not have been a wise choice for us. I had to give Shawn the evil eye so I could get a sip. The cup it comes in is pretty cool. There's a clear part so you can see how much smoothie you still have left. 5/5

As for the burger, I guess you'll have to read my friend's review when he gets to it since I wanted to be good and just stick with my healthy sandwich.

They have environment-friendly cups for their citrus cucumber water. Sit at the bar so you could charge your phone or other gadgets. This was a big plus in my book. The only not-so-positive comment I have is that my fries and our shake didn't come with the rest of our food.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,6,4,eq2V2toQ6YQJvCCjK5XKZg

5322938,2013-10-25,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFATS is a modern cafe with devil or angel food options. Skinny being food that is light in calories and fat, while Fats will leave a smile on your face (and you may perhaps have to undo the to button of your pants up before leaving). 

Since this was my maiden voyage to SkinnyFats, I decided to satiate the devil and the angel. I ordered a Skinny Snack (Ahi Sirachi) and a Skinny Salad (Cobb Me Maybe) and I decided to suck it down with the Charlie Brownin' Shake on the Fat side.

Walking in, you look over the the menu, and I had a very sweet girl explain everything to me: the concept, her favorites, and told me the specials of the day (pro-tip: specials change daily, check Facebook). She also offered me a free sample of their strawberry lemonade (so good). The place has a modern rustic feel and accents of bright, natural colors. There are even fun pictures of fruits, veggies, animals, happy faces painted on the walls. You place your order, then take a seat, and the bring your food and drink to you. The dining room is rather small, so I do not recommend this place for more than groups of 4. 

I placed my order, grabbed a seat, and some water, and then my parade of delicious came along. First the Ahi Sirachi. This was amazing. It was light and bursting with flavor. I highly recommend. The Cobb Me Maybe salad was okay. The ingredients were great, but for whatever reason, the dressing was just off... some things aren't meant to be light. The ingredients were fresh and tasty.My shake was heavenly: vanilla ice cream with NUTELLA (the nectar of the Gods), banana, and strawberry blended it. (This shake was on the kids menu, but upgraded to a 16 oz. size). It satiated the devil on my shoulder nicely.

SkinnyFats is a solid place. They also have an assortment of juices, baked items, burgers, salads, soups, snacks, shakes, and breakfast that is served all day and that I am dying to try.

Staff immediately greets you and explains the menu. They're all very friendly and helpful. 
I had their new veggie burger. Black bean, rice, chipotle burger with coleslaw and avocado. It was quite delicious. I hate coleslaw, but this was very edible. Quite delicious. I had it paired with truffle fries, they were pretty good as well. 
My friend had a slaw chee salad with seared ahi. It was very tasty. We both agreed we could eat that every week for the rest of the foreseeable future. 
I can see us going back here really soon. Everything was delicious, even their water which had oranges, strawberries and such in it. 
I hate how small this place is though. We were there for lunch and many people were leaving or taking food to go since there was nowhere to sit. I wouldn't want to take food to go from here. It is nowhere near home, nor anywhere else you can go sit and eat. All around this place is very good. Just be wary of going in at typical lunch times. It cleared out a bit by 3pm. Around 1:30 though there was nowhere to sit.

WOWwy wow wow wow.
This place is awesome in more ways than one...and I just had delivery.

THE FOOD - the menu is droolworthy. Whether you're into the whole ""healthy"" thing or you are in dire need of some serious grub (aka ""happy)- the menu has a bunch of options. As soon as I confirmed that this place would deliver to our office, I was super excited to give this place a try. My health-conscious coworker found multiple lunch options that sounded appealing. She settled on the TBLT (turkey bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich) with sweet potato fries. I of course picked a more caloric option and picked the Phatty Philly (hold the blue cheese) and truffle fries. We shared the Rancho-mame snack option (edamame with drizzled with ranch powder and a side of ranch) and we each got a kids-sized shake. I got the Charlie Brown (nutella, bananas, and strawberries-- um yes please) and she got a gross green shake called Adventure Juice. :)
EVERYthing we ordered was great! For food-delivery (I'll talk more more about that later) I was expecting to have a few issues (food cold, shakes melted, blah blah blah) but no. Everything was tasty. My kids-sized shake was the best part and... for only 3 dollars it was a HUGE serving (i'm not great at math but I'm pretty sure I got 16 ounces worth). And it tastes fresh and --just well-made. 
My truffle fries were not piping hot (i mean I get why so no complaints) but they tasted great!! My philly which I had thought was super pricey--- it was HUGE!. it was packed with meat, peppers, and huge portobello pieces. It was tender and just awesome. The edamame was delish too. I may have overordered a tad because I have a lot left over. This was due to the GINORMOUS shake I got that I finished first before eating.... I mean really -- $3 for something that big?!!!! It must be a mistake. My coworker L-O-V-E-D her sandwich. They did not skimp on the turkey bacon and.... it was NOT on your mama's wonderbread... this was thick artisan-type bread. No corners were cut here (no pun intended). 

DELIVERY - Speaking of not cutting corners--- PROPS go out to their online ordering system. It was smart, simple, and easy to use. I'd give it 5 stars just for that. 
The presentation of the food was pretty impressive too. The fry carton was pretty fancy. The container for my edamame is completely reusable and so were the shake cups. I get that they're new and this may change over time but I am still impressed with the quality of their delivery swag.
PLUS, I got the food in 30 minutes.... the ETA email said 20 minutes and I thought - who are they kidding - I expected at least an hour. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived in our lobby just 30 minutes later and he profusely apologized for being ""late"".  I laughed - I told him he was right on schedule! Totally worth the extra $5 delivery fee.

I am SO stuffed! SO happy! and I need a nap. What a great & unique lunch spot (closed on weekends) Impress your co-workers & friends! Do it!",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,9,3,5,6Ek2C7V2nZmOw9pjI0v5Jw

The place was a little extra to get to, coming in from Henderson you need to get to the other side of the freeway, yet my sister and I made the trek. The place is TINY. Like, I was scared to sneeze. I understand that they got creative with the small space, but honestly, a commercial office building isn't working out. I also am aware that we hit up this place on a Saturday. Around 11 in the morning. So I think that we were pretty patient with our given circumstances. I ordered the Berry Strong protein waffle, and my sister ordered the scrambowl. Because there was no seating available, whatsoever, we ordered it to go. I liked the price point and the iced coffee was a great taste and the size was a pleasant surprise. 

Our experience made a turn due to a couple that was kind enough to share their table and even share a great conversation with us. But the breakfast was okay. My waffle was tough, but the strawberry chia jaw was sweet without being coy. And the orange agave helped brighten up the dish. My sister was not ecstatic about her bowl, nothing seemed saut√©ed, more like a microwaved sweaty meal.  When the couple asked for a salsa or house sauce to help out our lackluster food, they told us there was only pico de Gallo. Great. We asked for cholula instead, and they happily gave us the bottle.

What is SkinnyFATS? Plenty of healthy options available on the left side of the menu: vegan, non GMO, and protein based. Happy options on the right side - sandwiches, burgers, and more.

We are here for lunch on a Thursday and it was packed!  Definitely a lot of local working folks were here for lunch and that is a great sign if the locals and not just tourists are eating here.  It was hard to navigate around the little place it was so packed and we almost didn't have a place to sit.  

I got a Flat Chix salad and really enjoyed it.  It actually had a big serving of chicken on top and I wished I had even more arugula to go with it!  The dressing was very tasty and I liked the crunch of the little cucumbers and onion brought to it.  I also split a taco order with my friend so we could each try one.  I got the Turnip Taco and really liked it!  It was a little too spicy for me though...I had to scrape a bit of the habanero sauce off.   I loved the tortilla it came on...it was so soft and tasty.

5349189,2014-01-06,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFats is exactly what it says it is. They have a skinny, or healthy, side of the menu and they have a fats, or happy, side of the menu. It was like they wanted you to have a mental and psychological break down or something. You know the devil and the angel that appears on your shoulders? Well, the healthy side can be your angel while the happy side can be your devil. Now before I indulge a bit more ... let me start with my story.. 

I first read about this place when I was randomly browsing yelp and I had wanted to try it. However, the NEED to try it wasn't that great -- mainly because the menu wasn't all that interesting to me. Then came a yelp event where SkinnyFats participated.. well, needless to say that my friend and I were definitely and completely interested in them after we tried their food. So we made it our goal to try this place when we were both free. 

Alas! The time has come! I had two friends visiting from out of town last week and we took them to SkinnyFats for lunch. The place was smaller than we thought it would be. It didn't have a whole lot of tables, maybe about 8? But they did have a bar sitting area for the onesies...or for those who can't nab a table. We were lucky enough to nab a table for our party! Also on the side note, there are some seats that are directly in sunlight due to their lack of blinds so be prepared! 

Here is what we ordered/what I've tried:

Chix on Broadway: Breaded chicken breast on brioche w/cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion & lemon aioli. Amazing! At first when I read the menu, I was a little on edge with it being chicken breast but I gotta give them props. It was juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The sauce that it had paired so well with the chicken. I had to take the onions out though cause for some reason they were just really spicy. And then half way through, I took the bacon out cause it just ruined the texture. I would be eating this soft and juicy chicken burger only to bite down on some hard, crunchy bacon. It didn't fly with me. Oh and I pretty much finished the whole burger. It was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating even though I was stuffed up to my collar bone. As my co-worker once said, ""Finger licking good!"" 

Cheeseburger Benedict: 1/2 lb. Angus burger w/lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg & SF sauce. Honestly, I wasn't too into this. Maybe because when it comes to a beef burger -- a burger is a burger to me. There wasn't anything special about this and there wasn't anything that was particularly good about this. Once again, I had to take out the onions and I also noticed that you couldn't taste the avocado. Why? It wasn't ripe. In fact, it was kind of hard. 

Phatty Philly: Steak, saut√©ed onion, peppers, portobello, bleu cheese & steak sauce on a hoagie. When I tried a bite or two of this... first off, it had way too much bleu cheese for my liking. Perhaps you could say that I'm a little biased and I'm not a bleu cheese lover but it was really a LOT of bleu cheese! On top of that, even though it said it had sauteed onions, we couldn't really taste it. The steak, however, was very good -- tender and juicy. But overall, it seemed to be missing something.

Phatty Philly (Custom): My friend decided to switch out the peppers for some jalapeno and the bleu cheese for cheddar cheese. Well, when I tried this version... I liked the addition of the jalapeno into it but they didn't give it in slices, they gave it up kind of grinded. It may have been better in slices. I think that keeping the peppers would've been a better choice. It's too bad that they didn't have too many variety of cheeses to choose from. They only had bleu, cheddar, and american, I think? I would've preferred them to have the option of provolone or mozzarella at least as a substitution to the bleu cheese. 

Overall my preferred Philly version would have steak, sauteed onions, peppers, jalapenos, portobello, mozzarella/provolone cheese, and of course the sauce. 

Ahi Taco-San Tempura: Ahi, sriracha slaw, mango pico & spicy aioli in a puffed shell. Okay, this was DELICIOUS. The puffed shell was amazingly good. The sauces, slaw, and mango went so well together. And the ahi was DELICIOUS. Nothing needs to be said about this besides TRY IT. 

Truffle Fries: Honestly, I didn't care too much about these. I may actually prefer just regular fries without the truffle oil. I'm a bit boring. I like my fries regular with some added salt and I'll be a happy camper. Cause if I don't eat the truffle fries right away, they just get soggy and I do NOT like my fries soggy. 

So, after all the things that we have tried, you can definitely tell what kind of people we are. We succumbed to our devil's desires ;)

Honestly, the Chix on Broadway and the Ahi Taco-san won it for me in the two trips I went. The food is honestly very good for the ones that I did like. I do plan to go back and try a few more things, such as their french toast!!

The truffle fries lacked a bit of oil, but weren't bad. The cherry popper was delicious, according to my husband, especially with the egg and peppers, and generous with the meat.

The food came out and looked fantastic. I got the Benedict burger and being my first meal of the day, I had to get something with and egg. It was a pretty good size too that I couldn't even finish all of it.

I really dig the fact that SkinnyFATS can cater to my inner fatty or the more health conscious side of me. This unique concept is one reason this place should be a must-go when in Vegas.

The interior is pretty cool, but I think it's way too small for the amount of people who come in here and eat. Seats and tables are super limited, so good luck finding a table if your group is a party of 4+. Luckily, it wasn't terribly crowded when we came in.

The food is pretty amazing here. The nice lady taking my order talked me in to getting something off of their secret menu (the ""secret"" menu items are displayed on the iPads in front of the register).

I got the Filet of Fire, which is a steak sandwich with avocado and fried jalape√±os between two perfectly toasted pieces of bread. I was a bit skeptical about it at first because I'm not really an avocado-in-my-sandwich type of guy, but the picture of the sandwich looked so appetizing I just had to try it out!I liked the fact that they left some pink in the steak because I hate it when steak is overcooked. The sandwich had a savory flavor and all the ingredients complemented each other. 

The fries were crispy and they taste even better if you dip it in their Sriracha aioli. The Sriracha aioli was rich & creamy, but I definitely was expecting more of the actual Sriracha flavor in it... Still pretty bomb, though!

Yup, they've definitely made a fan out of me. A loyal one at that too! I love the variety that's entailed in their name. You can indulge in their ""Happy"" menu or opt for a ""Healthy"" item. There's literally something for everyone.

I try to stick to their ""Healthy"" menu, although I must say that some of their ""Healthy"" items aren't the best for clean-eating. They do, however, offer a healthier choice which is good enough for me! I love their Chickhumm, a multi-grain bun filled with grilled chicken breast, sprouts, tomato, onion & hummus. I always complete the meal by adding a side of truffle fries.

The STEAKation is super tasty as well. It reminds me of a healthy spin on a Philly cheesesteak, except it's made with shaved New York steak, arugula, tomato, onion, and horseradish yogurt on a mutli-grain bun. You can also ask for your burger on a whole wheat hoagie instead! The onions tend to be overbearing so I order it without them. The horseradish yogurt, however, is light yet flavorful.

Asides from their delicious food, their superb service always keeps me coming back. I've never met such a happy, bubbly crew of employees! They take service with a smile to a whole new level. It makes me feel so guilty not tipping when I order to-go here. And who tips on to-go orders?!

There are-in my opinion-too many options. The people in front of me ended up taking about 10 minutes to order because the menu was so big. 

Little tip: read the menu before going so that you have a small idea of what you will be interested in when you arrive. I looked the menu up before my lunch and it helped a lot. I ordered the 'Happymess' which was amazing. My kids shared the 'naked chix'  and my husband got the 'buff chix'. All was good but mine was the best by far. 

Highly recommend. I will be back",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,0,0,4,dlqsy_iyPM6v91UN4zBukw

5374095,2013-12-05,4,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFats is definitely a modern concept for Vegas. It preaches sustainability and fresh ingredients for healthy and delicious food. I have been a few times and each was not a disappointment. Initial view makes it look expensive. Once you see the amount of food you receive for the price, it is a steal. It is definitely one of the new favorite places.

The first visit had me reeling at how delicious the food is. The Smoke in a Bowl is one of my favorites. The mixture of sweetness from the agave BBQ chicken mixed with the savory components made it well balanced. The second time; I got the Slow Boat to China and the aPollo fries. It is a generous portion of both. The hollowed out half cucumber topped with chicken salad and a mixture of sauces was excellent. The sweet potato fries topped with a mixture of sweet and savory. It was odd at first to remember that there are olives, cranberries, chicken, feta, and arugula topped with a balsamic reduction. It worked well together. The breakfast fell into the same catergory. Satisfactory for the most part. I had a few bites of the Creme Brulee french toast and enjoyed it without the maple syrup. The beet salad is nothing special and was the biggest disappointment.

5385476,2018-02-17,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"HOLY. WOW. SkinnyFATS is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

We'll get the negatives out of the way: the place is small and super crowded. Okay, that covers it.

While the inside is small, the decor is awesome. It has a rustic feel with lots of wood, and the walls are painted with grafitti-like art. It's really cool. I won't break down the concept of this restaurant because clearly all the other reviews break it down well for you. But evvvvverything on the menu sounds so incredible, so I ended up trying 3 different things.

I'm a sucker for 3 things: breakfast foods, protein, and waffles. And I'll be damned, they have protein waffles on the menu. They are absolutely incredible. You wouldn't know they're protein waffles (if you've ever cooked with whey protein, you know it has a pretty distinctive taste and texture) and the agave syrup they serve it with was amazing. I paired with that a breakfast scramble, which was also stellar, and some fried pickles to get a little bit naughty. I ended up being too full to totally enjoy the fried pickles, but I took them to-go and enjoyed them later in the day, and they held up perfectly.

Unfortunately for me, I was only visiting, so I can't have SkinnyFATS for a while now. But I'll be sitting here praying that they franchise to other parts of the country, because I would dine here every single day.",rQRJ4Mi2EWgNVaVWJGaG4w,4,1,5,LH44NH1dmwo4bc2SoZ5UOw

5390852,2015-10-16,4,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Much like Lucifer was cast out from Heaven, I was cast out of Elite Status here on Yelp for 2015.  Thus begins my story of redemption in the form of many new and updated reviews, starting with one of my regular haunts of late:  SkinnyFATS.

Sticking with the biblical theme, as you all probably are aware by now SkinnyFATS gives you the option each visit to listen to either the devil or angel on your shoulder when deciding what to eat by choosing from either the ""Happy"" menu or the ""Healthy"" menu.   

So if you've ever met me, it will probably come as a surprise that I gravitated towards the Healthy side of the menu.   I've probably tried 75% of the items there.   Some favorites are the Cranburkey which places the increasingly popular thanksgiving meal concept in burger form.   I also like ""3 Healthy Chicks"" from their breakfast menu which is served all day.   It utilizes the same patties from the burger but places them in a breakfast plate format with egg whites and toast.   Every once in a while I've had some overcooked Cranburkey patties, but usually they're moist and delicious.

Other highlights from the healthy menu are the STEAKation (basically a healthy version of a cheesesteak hoagie), Right Stuffed (which was a pleasant surprise as I didn't expect a pepper stuffed with turkey to be so scrumptious), and the Wrap Supastar which is relatively speaking a healthy breakfast burrito option, and not the kind you get at Roberto's at 3 am.

If you end up listening to the Devil on your other shoulder, and come on, this is Vegas afterall, you can go for something on the Happy side.  Nothing says Happy like some fried animal goodness on a bun amirite?  If the Cranburkey is Abel, then Chix on Broadway is Cain, its sinister brother ready to bash its skull in with a slice of bacon.  Fried chicken, BLT, cheddar on brioche.  It's worth poor Burkey's demise.  I also really liked the Cherry Popper burger with its multiple spicy elements (banana peppers, pepperjack, a spicy slaw), but it being surrounded by Hawaiian rolls seals the deal.   Oh and they do a mean sweet potato fry here which goes well with any of the sandwich/burger options.  Lastly I also really enjoyed the Bleu Balsamic which had shaved NY strip steak with tomato, red onion, and bleu cheese with a balsamic glaze.  I thought the combination of flavors all worked well in concert.

A couple disappointments for me were Tu-Nuts and Ahi Srirachi, as I didn't find the Tuna to be as melt in your mouth as I was hoping for, and Brussel Crowe tasted fine, but I didn't think there was enough on the plate to be worth the cost of admission.

Service is always attentive and friendly, and prices are reasonable!

One of my only issues with this location is simply how crowded it can get.  There's limited space and sometimes a very long line.   Adding to this, you'll often get overanxious patrons at the back of the line rushing to reserve themselves a table, leaving those who have already ordered without one.   I've noticed that when everyone just calmly orders and waits their turn, the general flow of those coming/going tends to work out.   Heed that advice and your angel might forgive you for ordering the Chix on Broadway with Sweet Potato fries.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,3,4,485B1o3AyZnAfolycdEweA

Tu-Nuts - really good but very spicy, even when we asked for the spicy on the side
Zucc-It - again tasty but very spicy, even though we asked if it could be toned down
More Cow Bowl - a definite must order

SweetCheeseUs - again so good we ordered another

The menu has two sides: a ""healthy"" side and a ""splurge"" side. It is great to have options! I ordered the avocado toast (from the healthy side) and was satisfied. it was one bigger slice of bread with plenty of avocado, sun-dried tomato, feta cheese and an over easy egg. I wasn't a huge fan of the feta cheese on it but it was the perfect amount of food- not too much.

My husband got the chicken and waffles and loved it. I tried the waffle is it was delicious! Needless to say, that was on the splurge side of the menu....

 Greeted immediately upon arrival and offered help with menu if needed. Although they were very busy, nearly a full house, I had ordered and in my seat within 5-10 minutes easily still. The dining room was clean and being kept clean by busy diligent workers. My cashier was new and being helped to learn the ropes, no biggie, a fellow employee named Patrick was doing a fabulous job of helping her along. Patrick was hands on everything and did a fantastic job from greeting, taking orders, to keeping the place sparkling clean. 
 Today I ordered the Zucc It dish with a side of jasmine rice that I love to mix all together in the same bowl. Check the menu for the Zucc It ingredients. I do recommend this dish highly especially with the jasmine rice addition.  Delicious. Awesome. Mmmm tasty. I sipped on a passion ice tea also that was delectable as well. 
 So in short the service was outstanding, the joint was jumping and still clean and flowing easily. The food was delicious and served in a timely manor.

For starters, it's small. Even when it's not busy, it's not hard to feel claustrophobic. They're usually quick to turn over the tables, but people are also quick to snatch them up. Last time I was here I sat at the bar type seating by the window. Although the weather was nice that day, I can't imagine sitting there during a summer day when the sun is blazing. The other downside to the small space is that it's so, so noisy. I was sitting right next to my fiance and I had to shout for him to hear me. Also, sitting at the bar area when it's busy sucks, because the line forms right behind you. It's really unpleasant having people breathing behind you while you're trying to eat. 

I always seem to have trouble with my food here, too. The first time I came here I got a chicken based meal and a side of rice. The chicken was good, but the rice was cold when it came out. The second time I came here I got a burger, and my burger was cold. Then, this time when I came, I ordered pancakes and they were cold! I'm not sure if my food is easy to make and it sits around while the other food is made, but that was the final straw for me, unfortunately.

I had no problem locating the restaurant because I know how to get to Larry Flynt's and I know it's on the same street (you can learn valuable information at bachelor parties occasionally).

There were only two tables in the restaurant at the time which allowed a very friendly staff member the opportunity to explain the menu to us and offer some recommendations.

I mostly tried items off the Healthy side as I try to be healthier when eating out.  I will admit that the dishes are GOOD!  The Juan Healthy breakfast burrito is huge!  Also, the sweet potato fries with feta and chicken breast is also delicious!  If you follow these guys on Instagram you'll see their daily (weekly) specials.  I imagine they are advertised at the restaurant as well.  

The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because the place is really tiny and seating is very limited.  But I mostly do carry out anyway.  :)

5452750,2018-02-13,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Came here twice during the week of CES. 

On our first visit, I came in wanting to order the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I was told they were completely out of the soup, but I decided to order the grilled cheese by itself anyway. My husband ordered a Naked chix bowl and we also got truffle fries to share. For drinks we also got a liquid defense and SkinnyFats Punch (I initially wanted a Delightful Cucumber which I saw on their website but was told they don't have that drink anymore...should probably take it off the website). My husband also decided to try an oatmeal raisin cookie (his favorites).

My grilled cheese was very good, but kind of felt like it was missing the tomato soup. But husband and I both agreed and that it was definitely worth coming back for.

My husbands Naked chix bowl left much to be desired. It looked nothing like the pictures and ended up being ""too saucy"" for his taste. The first bite he said was good, but he soon got tired of it a few more bites in. He didn't even finish half the bowl.

The fries were very good, drinks were good, though my Punch was more of a slushy/icee consistency than a juice. I was also told all the drinks are pre-made and can't be adjusted.

My husband said the oatmeal cookie was pretty bad. It tasted hard and old.

On our second night, they had the tomato soup so we both ordered tomato soup and grilled cheese with truffle fries again.

For some reason, the truffle fries seemed like they were taking a very long time to come out and when they finally did, they tasted cold (as if they were left forgotten in the window). We mentioned it to the server and he offered to take them back and get us new ones. While we waited on the fries, our soup and grilled cheese came out. For future reference, one cup of the soup is more than enough to share between two people. I'm not sure we would have even finished one had we shared! Taste-wise  it was ok. It honestly kind of tasted like a can of tomato paste that was heated up and slightly watered down to a soupy consistency. The grilled cheese was great just like the night before. 

Our fries, again, took forever to come out. We had completely finished our meals and asked the server if they were still coming out. He said he would double check. We were just about to tell him to just cancel them when they came out. 

Overall, if I have a craving for a good grilled cheese on sourdough bread, I'd come back....it was that good. I'd be interested in trying some of their other items as well.",P_Et0ix9G2jF9fHdn2qTsQ,7,4,4,ejM4PPPElW8id6NtPn8xrg

Note that I can eat pretty spicy and I specifically asked them to go light on the buffalo sauce on the cauliflower, since it was for my mom, who prefers less strong flavor.

The juices/shakes were good. We asked for Beet It without basil or ginger, and a shake Mr. Green with banana, chocolate and whey protein.

I am generally a big fan of healthy food and have been to healthy food restaurants that are way better than this.

5517561,2015-12-16,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Met up with a couple friends from HI on a Tuesday night, about 740 to be exact. THANK GOODNESS because of the time of day and day of the week, no line. We walk in and although we did not say it, I know we were all surprise to see how small it actually was in there. 

See, I'm torn about giving this place 4 stars vs the 3 stars i gave. I wasnt wowed after hearing of all the hype. Perhaps i have to try something else in order to up the star. But I'll give it 3 stars for now because there was no line, customer service was great, and my actual meal was not bad at all. So it isn't like a 3 star with a negative opinion towards the place.

Before I forget, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT coming here with a large load of people to eat and socialize. Why? It's a very fitting place as in it fits what it needs to. Our table was literally a-out-your-seat and a step to to the counter. You may come with your gang, but have no where to sit without being seperated. I say come here with a couple of your friends for a casual lunch or dinner. Also, DO NOT COME IN HERE WITH A STROLLER, INFANT CARSEAT, DON'T EVEN OPT FOR A HIGH-CHAIR.

It would be your luck you come on a busy day with item(s) in tow. I think there were only two or 3 tables that fit 4 people. Everything else were 2 person seating or the bar seating. You have been warned coming from a mother of 4.

Anyway, I ordered the sweet cheese us with the truffle fries. I enjoyed my meal. It was pretty good. I actually like their rendition of a philly cheesesteak than the actual philly cheesesteak itself. However, I wouldn't order this to-go. The bread would probably sog up quick and your fries would not taste that great. You must eat here to thoroughly enjoy your food while it is still fresh. Do not attempt to eat here as your first time but take it to go...I'm pretty sure you'll end up disappointed. Then you'll end up typing out an unfair review.

The meat in my sandwich was super tender and the banana and cherry peppers went together perfectly. My one friend had the parmesan sandwich, forgot the actual name, and his wife had the meat flatbread or something like that. 

Her meal look disappointing because it didn't look that big at all. I'm pretty sure she was still hungry afterwards because by the looks of it, think I'd be hungry too. Honestly, after eating my meal I felt as though I was still hungry...but as the night progressed I felt just right. Not full at all, but not starving. But I'm ""little"" so I can't speak the same for all. 

I do want to head back to explore their menu for sure. They do have a menu that leaves you wanting to do just that. I'll probably pick an odd day and time to avoid lines as seen in the reviews. To be honest, though, I don't think the food is worth such a line. If I had to wait and wait and wait just to order my food then worry about where to sit afterwards...I'd give this place 2 or 3 stars just for it not being worth the wait because of the price and perhaps portioning. I haven't explored their menu to really gripe about portioning, but my friend is a pretty bulky guy and he was still hungry. 

I did think it had a cute vibe to it. Love their menu and what they did with the place. But, it felt like it was a little extra dark than necessary. I wish they brightened it up a bit without losing the effect they want. I couldn't really read my menu too well. Which is probably why I hurried and ordered because the astigmatism was kicking in. Lol.  Lousy Night vision was in total effect. 

I would recommend this place for someone to try if they were looking to explore a different kind of menu. Just not so sure what to make of all the hype just yet. After a few visits of trying other menu items will I be able to make such judgment. But tonight as first impression, not convinced.

5529070,2015-03-17,3,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I sincerely hope mine is an isolated incident, because it was one of the most disappointing lunch experiences I've had, in quite some time. Let me put it this way, the single star is obligatory, with the review. 

This place, and I understand they have another location, is small; that has no real bearing on the review, it just played into the bad experience (it'll make sense by the time I'm done). We ordered our food and I got the Bleu Balsamic, also ordering the sweet potato fries. My wife ordered the Sweet Cheese Us and truffle fries. Simple enough order, if only it had been a simple, enjoyable meal. Again, this place is small and there were a total of four of us in our party, since it was crowded we chose to sit at the table outside; they assured us they would bring our order to us. 

A mere forty (yes 4-0 minutes) later our food was finally on its way, which we only found out, because we intercepted the server looking for us. We had to wait another 5 minutes for our friends food, which we soon learned had been ready, but set aside, and promptly forgotten. What's worse, we had to ask for the food, and were told it was coming out; this wasn't the case, so when we asked again, we were told we needed to present the receipt (that would be the receipt they never provided).  We pointed this out to the server and they did look and then locate our missing items. They commented when they handed it to us that it had been ready for us for a half hour but they didn't have a name; probably has something to do with not asking for a name when they took the order (small detail (you may be picking up on the sarcasm by now, sorry I'm compensating for my still growling stomach)).

As you can imagine the now thirty minute old Sweet Cheese Us (their version of a cheese steak) was served up on the most incredibly soggy bread. Hey, if you're into soggy bread that's great; not my thing and my wife bravely endured, but it wasn't good (yes, I tasted it and it was not good). In all fairness it may have been an okay sandwich, if the bread had been in better shape, but it still would have only been okay; not great. 

The truffle and sweet potato fries were, as you can guess, cold and actually not particularly well prepared. I think they were, at least for me, undercooked and sort of limp.  

Now, as for my sandwich.  First, it wasn't a sandwich. It also wasn't a salad, as there wasn't any lettuce. It was a bun less sandwich, or a protein style sandwich but in a bowl like a salad; sans the lettuce. I guess my primary issue is, it wasn't on the healthy side of the menu, it was on the happy side of the menu. Aside from that, nothing indicated it was not a sandwich; almost everything, on that half of the menu was a sandwich and nothing indicated otherwise (I've included a picture of the menu, you be the judge). It's redeeming quality was the generous inclusion of Bleu cheese, but aside from that it was a rather plain roast beef, an equally plain balsamic dressing, and a few overly ripe slices of tomato lacking in flavor. 

The only other redeeming quality was the cup they serve their beverages in, decent quality, with a nice lid, even a sturdy enough straw. I guess the worst part of the experience (if it could be worse and it was) is that we were vocal about our unhappiness and asked for the manager's name; Amanda was the name provided. Now, I mean vocal about our displeasure, not rude; despite this (if the evidence isn't already there) apparently customer service is not their strong suit. I'd have expected at least a polite apology from the manager, but alas she didn't even make an appearance. 

In summary, disappointing food, poor service, ambiguous menu, lousy experience; so bad I'm not sure I could convince myself to give them a second chance.",DgmAhT4MwtS_aywueKbo3A,9,3,1,5CmuldeVhHbAvxhIR_6TCg
5529682,2013-07-27,15,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"Skinnyfats is a terrific mix of healthy and semi-unhealthy (happy) and really caters to almost everyone.  There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.

I got the ""Cranburkey"" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  

I had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!

My skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the ""happy side"" of the menu.  She ordered the ""Chix on Broadway"".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.   

I got a large ""Mr Green"" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.

It was surprisingly good and still I felt good for eating healthy! The cranberry turkey sausage was weird because the cranberries were inside and they were really dry. It tasted okay but if you are looking for deliciousness you will not find it in those cranburkey sausages. 

My friends and I shared the sweet potato fries and I really recommend them, they are in some olive oil and rosemary seasoning and they are really good. They also give you free cucumber water here which I always enjoy to stay hydrated throughout my day.

It was tricky to locate their place in the first place, we thought we drove into someone's warehouse. Turned out their restaurant is inside of an office like building. The interior was cute, medium sized with a lot of tables and high bars. Food ordering has never been that easy for me as they have skinny and fatty choices where they labeled all the calories on the menu. (Oh my MFP thank you! ) 

I had their turkey burger and some skinny soup of the day, my SO ordered the classic burger and I took the big bite of his out of ""I must try your food"" curtsy. I actually like my cranburkey better as it has very interesting Cranbury flavor, it went very well with their spicy ketchup. I wasn't the big fan of my soup of the day, though, it tasted just like any ordinary cafeteria soup even though it was in a fancy cute soup cup.

However, this is probably because I'm a pescetarian so I didn't have many options to choose from on the menu. We asked the cashier if there were more vegetarian options and he was very helpful by notifying us of other dishes not listed on the menu in the store, so I ended up ordering a veggie burger. The sauce was good but the patties themselves were not special, so it's not something I'd order again. My sister had the Shroomin' in Philly sandwich which she enjoyed, and we both really liked the truffle fries. 

After looking at the online menu, I noticed that there were actually more vegetarian options that sounded tasty and I would like to try, so I do want to come back again. Their breakfast meals also seem promising. 

The service made the experience much better.

We ordered:

1) Wake n' Bacon: A Hawaiian roll with applewood bacon, egg frittata, pepper jack cheese, avocado, sriracha scallion cream cheese with country potatoes. Doesn't that just sound enticing? This was one of our favorites. The sauce is really addicting (5/5)

2) Spudghetti: You guessed it. Potato noodles!!! It comes with bacon, shredded cheddar, sour cream and green onions. We were excited to try it because it's quite creative. The potato noodles had great texture but the overall taste was a bit dull because it could have had more flavoring besides the sour cream and onions. We expected it to be more flavorful but it kind of tasted somewhat bland, but a good try though (4/5)

3) More Cow Bowl: If you like rice bowls, then definitely get this one. There's teriyaki filet mignon, portobello mushrooms, cauliflower, sliced bell peppers, green onions over egg fried rice. It's pretty filling and definitely shareable. The meat was kind of overcooked but overall, it was decent (4/5)

4) Chix On Broadway: A healthy take on your burger with breaded chicken breast, cheddar, onion, lemon herb aioli on a brioche bun with your choice of side. I chose truffle fries and they were pretty good. The chicken was definitely a bit burnt but it was a good one to try nonetheless. Let me just tell you that the burger is HUGE.

I pass by this place on the daily from the I-15, Terry, never managed to realize this place.  The sign wording is cool old school American farm style design, but too cluttered to make out from afar.

Once we finally arrived, I wasn't kidding when I added the tip about the clown car seating.  It is FCFS seating, so you can imagine, it can get pretty cut-throat, especially if you are really hungry.  I hoarded a cluster of tables and chairs from different ends of the dining area like a stingy toddler on the Amazing Race...mine mine MINE!!! (Hissing noise)

Truth be told, I was happy to learn that my supposed healthy/unhealthy meal was more on the unhealthy side, am I wrong for that?  We ordered the truffle fries, pollo fries, chef's special streak Benedict (2x) and drunken gypsy toast.

The wait was a bit lengthy and hadn't it been for the great Kentucky and Wichita State game during the madness, I may have had a more to say.  The inside is very well kept but the thermostat needed to simmer down a notch.  Don't very new wrong, I like it breezy, but I like my food sizzling even more...cold food robs meals of their flavor profiles.  

Overall, the meal was good, the steak wasn't over cooked and the cornbread on the Benny was a good compliment.

Located on Dean Martin Dr., I must admit that getting here would be out of the way for most customers, but the place was still busy for a Friday at 1:30pm.  It's not a very big space, but there's a cool bar area with outlets for those who want to plug in and nosh, plus maybe 8 tables for others to sit.  The menu features a happy side and a healthy side, so customers have a choice of being bad or good, skinny or fat.  Suzy and I both had the acai bowls and her son had an order of Mr. Flapjack, protein pancakes with bananas and syrup atop the order--note that you could easily feed two people with that regular order.  The Skinny Bowl had acai, strawberries, granola, raisins, cranberries, bananas, and chopped almonds.  I know it's personal preference, but I found it to be okay in my book.  I like acai bowls with coconut, blueberries, and a touch of honey, items missing in this version.  I'm also not a fan of raisins in my food at all and the granola was more like granola cereal, packed not loose.  I ended up leaving all of the raisins and cranberries in the bowl, along with some of the granola.  Overall, though, I will definitely return to try some of the other items on the menu that look great.

They have two sides to the menu. The Skinny side is rather healthy and the other side, it more indulgent? is that the right word?.....yea, well go with indulgent.

The young lady, I don't know the spelling of her name so I won't even attempt to spell it out but she was working sunday night and she has black hair (ethnic) and black frames.

She is everything you would want customer service to be. The food was great but her service is what made me leave 5 stars. 

We were a group of 7 and questions up the ass. More so from my mom and I. She can't eat anything spicy! and as for me, well, my questions go something like this:

Is the bun vegan?
How is this made?
Is there cheese mixed in?
Is there any animal stock/broth in it?
Does the sauce have any dairy?

She did not bat an eye, roll them into another universe, huff, sigh, or ANYTHING! She answered EVERY SINGLE QUESTION without hesitation!

I ordered the Mean Bean Vegan Burger and it was a hearty burger. Typically vegan burgers are thinner and not as filling but this burger is where it's at. They also give you a nice serving of sweet potato fries.

Also, I split the ZUCC IT dish with my sister. There were a lot of zuchinni noodles and veggies and the arribiata (italian for angry) is a spicy sauce. It all worked!

I went here with Michael P. & Jessica R. for dinner last night and ordered the Cobb me maybe & an ahi sirachi taco. 

Michael ordered the neato burrito & Jessica ordered the Chix on Broadway + truffle fries.

After picking off the black beans, I dug into my salad. If I get it again, I'm going for the happy side Cobb because I wasn't feeling the dressing. On the plus side, there were a ton of toppings and it was a good value.

I have a thing about tortillas - I don't like flour tortillas unless they're cooked until crisp like a quesadilla or chimichanga. I think flour tortillas have a gummy, floury taste that I just can't stand. Unfortunately, the tacos here are served on flour rather than corn. Personal preference, but this would have been a killer taco on corn, but the tortilla was overpowering that it really masked all the flavors of the tacos.

Jessica and Michael split their meals with each other and they said the burrito looked great but was chewy and disappointing. Apparently the meat needed chopped up some to be manageable. The Chix sandwich looked incredible and apparently it was great. I tried some of the fries and found them to be... Dry? Can a fry be dry? I wish I would have tried the ketchups.

The restaurant is much too tiny. My cousin and I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and even though we were able to find a seat rather quickly, everything felt so cramped. We came here with a baby car seat, and I do not recommend that. This place is best visited in pairs. You will not enjoy dealing with big groups here.

Now for the food. Surprisingly, there aren't really any desserts. But oh my goodness. I still loved my food! The portions are very generous for the prices. I had the Drunken Gypsy Toast and the Ahi Taco-San. Yum!

I wasn't expecting the toast to taste that sweet! It was delicious! I probably could have used more whipped cream, but it was still a lovely dish. Aesthetically, it looked gorgeous. All of the fruits were fresh and sweet. My bacon was good, too!

The Ahi Taco-San was excellent. The tuna was cooked to perfection and all of the stuff that topped the taco was scrumptious and paired well with the tuna. There were jalape√±os in it, which I'm not a fan of, but I totally didn't mind them in this taco. Everything about this taco was to die for, haha. And it was so decently priced!

Overall, my experience at SkinnyFats was a good one, I only had a few details to pick at. I certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for fun,  filling food. You'll have a blast here.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,3,4,4,GiBDK0NOWFl94GhnvCtGEw

5675535,2014-05-19,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I'm on the fence.....

I had brunch here on Sunday morning with a friend.  I arrived just after 10am, when they opened and it wasn't crowded (yet).  I was able to get a table for the 2 of us immediately and my friend arrived shortly after.  Lucky for us, because within 20 minutes or so, it was PACKED and there wasn't a seat to be found - even at the ""bar.""

This is an interesting concept.  As you likely already know - there are 2 sides of the menu - the ""Skinny"" or healthy side and the ""Fat"" or happy side.  I don't think the happy side has that bad of stuff on it, everything still seems somewhat healthy.

You order at the counter, which can cause a long line and back up.  When we tried to leave, it was hard to get out because there were so many people in line waiting to place an order.  Anyhow, there was also a guy taking beverage orders to keep those in line happy, which was very nice.

The cashier was friendly and helpful and offered recommendations.  My friend ordered a Juan Healthy Wrap from the healthy side (because she planned on ordering the Sunday Sundae as well) and I ordered the Drunken Gypsy Toast from the happy side. My food was creme bruleed french toast with berries, bananas, whipped cream and syrup served with apple smoked bacon ($7.75).  It was pretty darn delicious!  I also had a strawberry lemonade, which was only OK.  It tasted really watered down.

We then shared the Sunday Sundae, which was a Fruit Loops doughnut from Pink Box, on top of puff pastry with vanilla pudding and ice cream, fruit salad and whipped cream.  Boy was it sweet!  Way too sweet for me, but the few bites I had were tasty.

The reason I am on the fence - I really wanted to try one of their cold pressed juices, but I couldn't justify paying almost $10 for it.  That just seems crazy to me.  I can get a Bountiful Basket for $15 and that would make a heck of a lot more juice than the 24 ounce glass they serve for just less than that.  And people wonder why so many folks choose to eat at McDonald's on the Dollar Menu?!

I also dislike how tiny this place is.  It's uncomfortable to be eating with people lurking over your shoulder, waiting to take your seat.  It makes it hard to enjoy your meal when you feel like you have to eat quickly.

Also, it's the strangest location.  Not hard to find, but not necessarily convenient to anything either.

Anyhow, brunch was overall pretty good.  I am not sure I would go out of my way to dine there, but it was a nice morning.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,6,4,4,DAMIUH0ykCkDImn8ceZ1qA

5679772,2017-05-12,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,I've eaten at the other location but the menu was different. Probably because I came in earlier in the day. I tried a breakfast item and it was ok. The location was convenient to where I was but absolutely not a first pick. The chair I sat in was super not comfortable. The other location had like a bench that was good. It was just ok/I think the other location is better. But I don't think I'd go back to either-too many other great choices out there.,IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,2,1,2,XwVggiqtCKlbJ1l5WNEbig

Next time I'll ask for crispy bacon. The truffle fries were not good to me. But I'm a French fry freak so they had a really really high standard to live up to compared to others I've had in town. Also had fried pickles and they were ok but didn't care for the dipping sauce. I would give them another try after trying a few more spots in town first because the burger was pretty doggone good cold.,c6lAB08lDzAVF55zYn7nXA,0,0,4,0h61rwQftT9GKrK9QfEMYQ
5691481,2014-03-09,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I came here for the first time today with recommendation from another yelp user. It wasn't the easiest place to find since their sign is flat and does not stand out. Walking in, there was quite a line (which I'm told is normal), the menus were on the wall near the door for convenience while waiting, and there was cold water to help yourself to. The menu is clever and has unique items, but is a little hard to follow fluently. The prices for entr√©es varied from about $7-$13 roughly. They also had side items and other goodies for less. 

To say the building is small is an understatement. It was cramped and crowded waiting in line, and in the ""larger"" part of the restaurant. You pay for your food and find a table where they bring the order, or you can order to go. We opted to eat there since we had somewhere to be afterward. I saw a table open up (it's first come first serve for seating since it's tiny) so I didn't get to see how the service was at the register. 

I ordered a cheeseburger benedict with no onions and a strawberry lemonade. I was feeling adventurous and fat, so I had to do it. My husband got the more cow bowl with no onions and a strawberry lemonade as well. When we took a drink of the lemonade it was awful. It was almost lukewarm and was watered down. When the server came to drop the food off at the table, we let him know. He sincerely apologized and exchanged both for rootbeer.

The food came and I was impressed with the presentation of it for sure. The burger was big and had cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, avocado, and of course the egg with their sauce on it. The burger was cooked just above medium - well (which I love) and the ingredients were fresh. To my horror the burger still had pieces of red onion throughout. I wasn't sure if it was in the meat itself or just random pieces overlooked. The fries were amazing. My husband's food also had onions (we think onions came from Satan), so I was disappointed to see that. However his bowl was delicious as well (of course I had a bite! It had fried rice AND steak!). 

Regardless of the hiccups, I feel the ambience of the restaurant is pretty cool. Due to its compact size, I was happy to get out of there after eating. We were practically tackled for our table when we got up to go. The food, the menu, and service were all fab so I would recommend this place, and hope to be back soon. Maybe next time I'll order online and pickup though. Hopefully they open another location in Henderson and it will be bigger :)",JUhShbFDEDZYrcJcpoHPDQ,2,1,4,YvRKuspheNJyco4h4Vkw5w

I've been back several times and have loved it every time.   They have put together a combination of awesome food, fun atmosphere and a staff that is incredibly cool and engaging that is tough to beat in Vegas.  

One of my favorite things to do at a new restaurant is ask the server what they would get, and often I get a dumbfounded look and then just a bunch of questions about what I want.  When I ask the question at Skinny Fats, I get a passionate response full of insider tips.

The best thing I've had so far is the ""Smotherload Burrito"".  One of the best I've ever had.  And ENORMOUS!  The Chicken and Waffles chowder is also phenomenal. 

You really can't go wrong with Skinny Fats, although I can't say with confidence that the ""Skinny"" side of the menu is any good.  I haven't ordered anything off that side yet... Don't tell my wife ;-)

It can be hard to find a table, so be prepared for that.  However, not being able to find a table is usually a good sign that you're in the right place!",TVDbNGDO2jMRvnDqHLB9Ew,1,1,5,Dbg537AavPOq2c2uBBh-KA
5698141,2014-03-27,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I finally made it to Skinny Fats after wanting to try it for quite a while. During my first trip I just ran over during my break and grabbed the Acai Bowl. I love my Acai Bowls and this one was pretty good, possibly the best I have had in Vegas although Daily Kitchens is also amazing not sure which one I like more. 

During my second trip I picked up dinner for me and my girlfriend on the way over to her house. She got the boneless chicken wings they were a little spicy for her taste but I didn't mind it. The order says it comes with 3 or 5 I can't remember but they ended up giving a couple extra which made for nice leftovers the next day. I got the cheesesteak, I replaced the blue cheese with American I think. I'm a big cheesesteak fan, this one was a little untraditional but it was good. The steak inside was very tasty! I ordered truffle fries as my side dish and those were super good. 

The only downside to Skinny Fats is that it's a really small place and every time I have been there it has been packed which results in a wait. Tried to go one morning for breakfast (I really want to try the breakfast, I've seen the dishes people are eating when I've been there and it looks amazing!) but turned around cause the line was too ridiculous. If you are planning a trip to Skinny Fats be prepared to wait..

5705352,2015-10-26,19,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFATS is a unique restaurant in Las Vegas that features two sides to its menu.  A Skinny, healthy side and an indulgent, fat side.  You'll find a large, unique menu that ranges will cover just about any dietary need or want.  Fresh, healthy salads share the spotlight will fantastic burgers and fries.  It's one of the best concepts I've ever experienced. 

My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - The only negative to SkinnyFATS is that it's not a big restaurant.  But it's one built for the 21st century.  Inside you'll find wooden walls decorated with custom art.  There's also a long counter with bar stool seating with electric outlets with USB ports.  On a Thursday evening visit the light was dim, the music chill, and I felt like I was at a hip lounge.  1 Star.

Service - Upon entering you'll line up next to the main bar/counter and wait to place your order.  The staff will set you up with a nice, cold drink with a nice selection or beers while you're waiting to place your order.  Once you do, you'll get a number, find a seat, then wait for them to bring it out.  One side note, our party of 7 called in to let them know we were coming & they setup a group of tables for us before we got there.  1 Star. 

Food - Ever been to a restaurant where you don't know what to order because everything sounds so great?   Well SkinnyFATS fits the bill.  But I'll be honest, I didn't bother with the skinny/healthy side, instead I focused on the burgers.  Just about everyone in our party ordered one.  I went with the patty melt.  It was delicious with a buttered, griddled sourdough sandwich with perfectly melted cheese and juicy patty.  The parmesan truffle fries were a great side to pair with it.  The meal was fantastic and I think I went through a huge stack of napkins on my way to devouring it all.  They even serve breakfast dishes all day.  I didn't quite get to that part of the menu, but it's good to know for the future.  2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Yes.  Honestly I feel like I need to come back in another big party and just agree to share all our dishes.  Breakfast, burgers, healthy, happy, SkinnyFATS has a great menu and I'm sold.  Without a doubt my next visit to Vegas will include a trip back.  1 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. 

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",hXSzBUjnORNXkaxwA1j-vg,28,22,5,SGn5apuG7fEaBatlqW3GGQ

Went on Friday 2-5-16 around 6:30 PM.  This restaurant is located on Dean Martin between Sunset and Russell Road.  It's much smaller inside than the one on Warm Springs and the vibe is more dark and hipster-ish.  $35.28 got us a side of fruit, a warm cookie, a tu-nuts apperizer, a chickhumm sammich, and a buff chix bowl. 
.
$9.95 Tu-nuts appetizer is a cucumber half that they remove the seeds from and then put raw ahi tuna chunks, sriracha slaw, almonds, teriyaki sauce, avocado, and a sriracha aoli on top.  I do not like raw fishes for the most part but my hubs said it was very tasty.  I tried a bite and almost gagged but like I said....I don't like raw fishes!!! 
. 
$9.95 Chickhumm sandwich- had grilled chicken, sprouts, tomatoes, red onions, and hummus on a multigrain bun.  Husband chose brown rice as his side.  I heard no complaints from him and I like that they have sprouts because I don't see those a lot here in Las Vegas.  
. 
$7.95 buff chix- fried buffalo chicken tenders and I swapped out the truffle fries for sweet potato fries.  Their ranch is awesome and the tenders were hot and juicy.  The fries go perfectly with their jalapeno ketchup. 
. 
$1.95 warm cookie was tasty but I definitely would rather have McDonald's version.  The $3.95 side of fruit was so tasty and perfectly ripe.  I love that my hubs can have his healthy crap from the ""healthy side"" and I can eat like a normal person from the ""happy side"".

After seeing a Facebook friend continually post pics from Skinny Fats, I knew I had to try it.  I knew the restaurant was small, but decided to be brave, and not only took my family of four on a Friday night, but an additional family of four as well.  We arrived at 5:30; early enough to get a table configurated for the 8 of us and the waiter couldn't have been any nicer or accommodating about it.  It is very small, but has such a cool vibe to it!  The decor is perfect and it really speaks to whole feel you get there.  Plus, it was super clean, including the bathrooms, which is always appreciated with kids!

We were ordering for four children and four adults, and as first timers had no idea what we were doing.  The staff was SO nice and helpful with everything, and super welcoming!  We all managed to order (there's a secret menu too!), and waited anxiously while ogling over the super cute salt shaker, and choices of ketchups at every table.

I got the cranberry turkey sandwich on the ""skinny"" side of the menu, and balanced it out with the truffle fries.  It was all super good... Fries were amazing!  My husband got the chicken sandwich with the Asian coleslaw.  Sandwich was great (on a brioche bun!), and the coleslaw... Oh my.  Best I have EVER had.  I seriously considered asking for an order of it to take home!  Other items ordered and loved were the sweet potato fries and BLT sandwich.  The kids all got the chicken fingers and root beer floats... They were in heaven.  

As far as drinks go, they have a great variety of floats, shakes and cold pressed juices.  Yummy fruit infused water is also an option.  And, we couldn't leave without buying some huge cookies from the pastry case!

By the time we left around 6:40, it was packed.  I can see why!  We all can't wait to go back for breakfast!  And lunch, and dinner, and breakfast again, etc. ; ). As a Vegas native, I'm SO excited to see a place like this pop up in town and wish them continued success!",Rg5nSgIU0bKVy4A-t9-Usg,2,1,5,C_MltJaiBms7ZqaKPrANMg

5735057,2014-01-09,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I had high hopes for this place before even trying it. My coworker is also health-conscious and she came upon this place and really persuaded me to try it out. After the first visit, I knew I was going to come back multiple times (kind of a random place for it to be on Dean Martin so it looks like they're probably big on word-of-mouth advertising). The ambiance is nice and it's kind of small so if they're really busy you'll probably be without a seat. I wouldn't recommend big groups. Maybe a group of 4 or less would be perfect.

1st visit was mostly for dessert BUT then I realized they don't really have dessert because all the dessert-related pictures on Instagram are for their Sunday Sundae specials.
I ended up getting a kid's sized order of Adventure Juice (juiced spinach, orange, and lemon, blended with strawberries, bananas, and frozen yogurt or ice cream) which was actually pretty yummy. I tried it with ice cream.

The Drunken Gypsy Toast $7.75 is an SF Cr√®me brul√©ed Brioche, berries, bananas, whipped cream & syrup w/Applewood bacon and that was also really yummy. I liked the softness of the brioche toast and all the berries and bananas was nice to go with it. I was just pleasantly surprised with both things. Sometimes you come to a place and you're like eh, maybe I'll come back, but this one is a for sure.

It's always a plus to go out to eat and have delicious healthy options. For the ones that don't want to be ""healthy,"" you can order from their ""happy"" menu. I am definitely going to try a lot of their healthy-side menu options, though. They all look promising. 

Also, check out their Instagram for new pictures of different dishes because it may not sound good on paper but it looks so damn good.

The inside has a really fun atmosphere and decor, with a mix of hand painted walls, pallets and bare metal to mix things up. Very much a place for UNLV students to work/hang out.

It's tiny, though. You'll have a hard time finding a seat during dinner time, esp. on the weekends. It's open seating, fyi. The menu is split into two sides, the ""skinny"" side that has healthier options and the ""fat"" side that is more comfort food. All the items have some kind of unique, gormet flare. Like the choice between sweet potato or truffle fries (fries made with truffle oil and spices). You can definitely tell everything is hand made and fresh, and all items served look as pretty as a picture in a magazine. Seriously, it all looks good. They even have a giant water cooler with fresh fruit cut inside so you can have delicious infused water if you don't feel like buying a drink.

The things I'm not fond of: the lack of seating, the lack of diversity in the menu, and the prices. The menu has items like a burger with eggs benedict on top, but that's the only burger. It's not an enormous menu, and a lot of the items included on it are sweet breakfast foods like pancakes. I love the truffle fries but with the menu as it is, I don't feel the need to go there more than once a month. 

Also, it's very expensive. I'm kinda' surprised by the prices. But still, it's got some great twists on food and an fun atmosphere, so I'm still a fan.",jnO_038DjWXknuDVVNPSKQ,2,1,4,EthC6RsSWJwOKFwy2xVZew

The inside is very small, so if you plan on sitting down, make sure you swoop a table quick and the most a table can really sit is 4 people, so if you have a larger party, it's probably best to to-go it or sit separately. Parking is okay if you're lucky to find one right away. And during rush times, the lines can get pretty long! My friends and I barely missed the rush time and came at 11am. The line was out the door when we were leaving!

Coffee is refillable so its a plus, They have spa water outside for you if you don't want to purchase a drink. The menu has really punny names which I think is super cute. Not only do they serve food, they also have some cool juices to offer ( I didn't try that). 

I got steak eyes to split with a friend since we weren't that hungry. It was pretty cool, it's essentially an egg (cooked to your choice) on top, with country fried steak and a biscuit on the bottom. Kind of placed like an eggs benedict. I really enjoyed it and I think the biscuit was AMAZING! 

The food is good and I think the price is a little on the pricier side. meals are good to split if you're not too hungry.",dMs9FNS7LxzS9s_1gVM82A,1,1,4,hIHRpFLvtIdew_3Ke9dfvg

Basically, you have the ""Skinny"" side which is healthy of course then the ""fat"" side which is the complete opposite of the skinny side. OH be on the eye we passed it twice, we suck, we were expecting a colorful pop out sign and that's not what it was....

Kind of like a doppelg√§nger style menu.
From the Skinny side I got the Ahi Srirachi taco, which had seared tuna, some kind of slaw, mango pico all on a soft flour tortilla. It was VERY flavorful and VERY messy!! 

Also, I ordered, Ahi Taco-San, from the Fat side. It was tempura ahi with slaw, avocado aioli, also with mango pico, served in a hard shell taco. It was equally as flavorful. 

I think I prefer the Ahi Srircahi taco most because I like soft tortilla's over hard. OH and the tacos are I think are pretty big, I think 2-3 would be fine for women to be full and men would be good with 3-6.

Chris got the Phatty Philly which had delicious saut√©ed portobello mushrooms, onions, and peppers, grilled TENDER filet mignon, and SLICES of blue cheese all served on a toasted hoagie roll. 
Now I HATE blue cheese so I just picked some meat and portobellos off and tried them and OMG were they tasty!! I would get this without the cheese! 

Our friend got the Chix on Broadway. It was a freshly pounded out chicken breast breaded to order, which I appreciated, on a brioche roll with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, and cheese. He liked it and it was HUGE, plenty to share. I tried a bite and they flavor was there however with the crispy chicken, crunchy bacon, and the toasted roll it hurt my mouth and I felt it was dry. 

Both Chris and our friend got truffle fries, they are shoestring style. I love that you can taste the truffles. The total for all 3 of us was $47, which included 3 sodas. 

They are doing things right here. Got great flavors going on and you can tell they care about the food. I wanted to try everything, which I will eventfully. I can't wait to go back!!",UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A,2,1,4,heljhVe8f1toXuG_QPC9nQ
5778553,2014-04-26,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"SkinnyFats you have won me over!

I thought I had an idea of what to expect through all the reviews, but even then I was still so surprised! This place does not seem like it belongs in Las Vegas, but maybe somewhere in California. It's almost like a restaurant inspired by Tumblr/Pinterest with all the colors, art, and overall interior decor. I had slight difficulty finding the place since it's located in somewhat of a office plaza. Good thing they have signs on the light poles stating, ""SKINNY FATS - YOU JUST MISSED US.""

Anyways.. Me and my friend went during lunch time and all I got to say is that if you're planning on going here - TRY TO AVOID LUNCH TIME. This tiny place was packed! Luckily, they have somewhat speedy service and we were able to place our order. I opted for a healthy snack and a happy side which was the mini Gobbler and truffle fries. The mini Gobbler is basically a slider burger which upon appearance I thought I should have ordered more because there was no way this small burger and bowl of fries what going to fill me up.. Surprise! Surprise! I ended my meal with a full stomach and I didn't feel totally gross. I've never had a turkey burger and found this one to be very appetizing. I definitely did not feel guilty eating it and found my hunger satisfied.

I want to make a trip back here and indulge on a happy entree. This place matched up to my expectations and more. I left giving it a 2 thumbs up along with a 5-star rating.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,2,1,5,4E8wGXXPdeyPrfeiicTudA

i got the ""healthy"" cranburkey w a ""happy"" side of slaw chee. the turkey burger on its own was decent, but adding the slaw chee to the burger made it really great. all the flavors meshed really well together. 

my friend went with chix on broadway w sweet potato fries - basically a fried chicken blt. it was good, but nothing exceptional. if you have a big appetite this would be good for you - i don't think i've ever seen such a big chicken breast before. the fries reputation on yelp was exaggerated a little imo - they were typical sweet potato fries. 

overall i liked skinnyfats, and would go back if i'm in the area. my one complaint is that since they're saying certain things are healthy, they really need to back it up with nutritional values at least on their website if not the menus. 

the cranburkey was definitely healthier than the fried chicken sandwich, but by how much? it was regular ground turkey, not turkey breast, so it wasn't exactly low in fat or calories. it was also a pretty big honey wheat bun - so i'm guessing probably a couple hundred calories for the bun alone? i'm not a calorie counter obviously, but it would be nice to have a little more info since ""healthy"" can be pretty subjective",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,7,7,4,dhnZ_sCNpM6wgcQ1mEWdjg

My meal was very good. It consisted of items like chicken, rice, pineapple, black beans and bell peppers. The dish is full of flavor and the yogurt sauce (I think it was yogurt at least) was soooo good on top of the dish. 
The WTFrench Toast was deliciously different. So many flavors in one. The Cranburkey was definitely different but good. The Brussel Crowe was good as well. I would have to say it was like nothing I've had before in the flavor department. The sprouts were cooked just right.

I tried the TeriyAHI sandwich, recommended to me by the cashier. So it's ahi tuna, lightly marinated with light teriyaki glaze, on 9 grain bread, with lettuce and tomato. So good. The bread was so perfectly toasty and grilled,  that you couldn't tell anything was even healthy. Like bread from a grilled cheese. Yum! Also got the sweet potato fries, which were amazzing. More sweet than salty. Tasted like dessert. Would definitely get this entire combination again. 

Also got the something ""on a boat"", can't think of the correct name. Overall, chicken salad on a cucumber. Refreshing and light, definitely on the messy side.  Good but not great.

The menu didn't show the Sunday's Sundae that I had seen earlier that day so I wasn't sure if that was part of their secret menu or something and didn't bother to ask. We ordered the chicken and waffles (chickawaffadoppolis?) and the Smotherload steak burrito. We also ordered a cucumber shake and a Hangover Cure juice. My chicken and waffles was better than I expected; juicy, crispy chicken and a crispy warm waffle. I was served about 2 tbsp of syrup and the plate was really big so all of that crispiness started to get dry and I just needed a little more syrup but when I asked for it, the gentleman told me no problem and never came back with it after passing by several times. It seemed as though all the employees were working hard but I felt ignored. The Smotherload was pretty fantastic and flavorful and the cucumber shake was refreshing. Again, I got unlucky and didn't care much for my Hangover Cure juice. It tasted like beets alone and I couldn't finish it. I should have known  beets would overpower the juice though, so I take the blame for poor ordering choices there. For such a small space, the vibe wasn't as warm and welcoming as I expected it to be but the food was good enough to make me come back and try other menu options.",9KedzFFaQSK06pl25KcjhQ,1,0,3,0OEwMf2M7O1MTSuc21urqA

Everything sounded so good but I went with the buffalo cauliflower and ahi tacos. We got our food pretty fast but I wish my dish was better than it was. The cauliflower steamed it boiled and was doused in hot sauce, I was expecting it to have some sort of breading or batter to mimic a a buffalo wing but it wasn't. The taco shell didn't seem to be cooked thoroughly so it was still chewy at the bottom. The ahi prices were cut in chunks which were way to big and overpowering for that taco. I enjoyed the slaw that it was stuffed with Ana the sauce was good as well. My favorite part was my BF's food, he ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was super good and fried to perfection. I could have eaten a plate of just chicken. The waffle was good along with the scrambled eggs. If I ever return to Vegas, I will come back and get the chicken and waffles hands down.",fQNnz8_uVjSRjfkw-eAV6Q,0,0,4,jJTmtqeUCnZgMuwbD1pw_w

5839634,2016-11-12,1,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I came across this restaurant on Yelp while searching for breakfast/brunch places. The reviews and pictures were so good that we decided to give it a try. 

We came here on a Saturday morning about 45 minutes after they opened. The restaurant was already packed but the line to order was short. The ordering style is pay and the counter, get a number, and they will deliver the food to your table. The only thing is you have to just wait until a table opens up because it's a seat yourself kind of place. We had to stand and drink our coffee for a while but found a table right before our food came.

Since the Chikawaffadopolis (chicken tenders and waffles) had some great reviews I decided to give it a try. It was definitely not what I expected based on the reviews. My waffle was slightly overcooked and I was given a pile of what seemed like leftover scrap pieces of chicken which was supposed to be ""fried chicken tenders."" The so called chicken tenders were dry, flavorless, ovecooked, with slightly burnt edges.  I saw 2 other diners that ordered the same thing get a huge pile of good sized, plump, juicy looking chicken tenders on their waffle. I only ended up eating 1/4th of the waffle a hardly any chicken. Sooooo disappointing!!  

I usually tend to overlook some of the food quality if the service is good...BUT the service was pretty bad too. The person that took our order was friendly and polite but the server we had was pretty bad. She hardly smiled and tried to rush us out. After bringing more coffee to our table she tried to clear my grandfather's plate and he wasn't even done eating yet. 

I will not be dining here again.",ee6ORsIFaoKz8D1FdRUKPg,7,1,2,8iud5wZbkJkfnprzXvWBKw

I've been to a place called Protein House and to me, this place knocks it out of the park. This place has healthy food, great presentation, great vibe and the pricing is very reasonable. 

Cluck Moo was an egg white omelet with filet mignon and tomato. 
Sweet Brown is DELICIOUS! Sweet potato pancakes!! They pour syrup over it beforehand and actually ruin it by doing that so I would recommend ordering this without syrup and just having it on the side. We had to send this one back because it made the pancakes soggy. The new order was so good though and I didn't even need to add syrup.

Execution is a completely different story. 
We were excited about the menu and ordered quite an array of items. We ordered a burger and truffle fries, Greek pizza, ahi sirachi taco, hot-mame, and strawberry lemonade. 
Let's start by saying I understand that this is a new place... Get it. I understand that they didn't anticipate such traffic... Get it. 
So.... The key is to make your guest who will be visibly irritated at the chaos & lack of uniformity feel important and happy. That's not happening. The employees are just as confused as the people arriving!!!
We walked in never having been here. WE see that it's crowded... Assume we have to wait, which is fine. The guy at the front wants to tell me about the menu.... I'm not dense or stupid.... Ill figure the menu out. What I would like you to do is answer how I'm to proceed with my 2 year old son and 1 year old nephew and two other members of my party. He tells me there is no list to put our names down on and it's first come first serve. The problem with that idea is that there was already a line out the door and people standing around waiting for tables...... Let's put it this way, it's just a shit fest. The Blind leading the blind. 
Yeah you can take it to go..... BUT GO WHERE?!?? The place is on a desolate road near the strip. 
They get a two because the food was good. 
The other three stars they can get if I ever decide to come back to this place after they work the kinks out and get their shit together.....oh & after I visit every other restaurant that we'd like to in Vegas..... You know... Where they have seats and a staff. Not just food and a register. 

The highlight was the strawberry lemonade... Which for the other two people with me was horrible, for me was great bc it wasn't sweet and literally tasted like strawberry, lemon, and water. 

**side note: while there they asked a couple to move to the bar bc they were taking up seats at a table for a bigger party...... And people were at the ALREADY busy register asking for boxes and trying to correct wrong orders. ...... A MESS!",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,0,0,2,oIxw2U0g0dIc5A7OUbUTxw

The food was decent... I wouldn't say it was amazing, but it was alright. Would I return? Maybe. This was our first stop, but we seemed to find other places which kept us from returning.

5873310,2016-08-13,0,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"I am SO sad to have to lower my rating with this updated review, but today was just a really odd day for skinnyfats, and if I wasn't a super fan after eating here our first time back in April, I probably would have given it one or two stars because that's what today's visit deserved. 

It took about an hour and 20 minutes to stand in line, order, wait for a table, watch the spectacle of people fighting over a table, hear people complaining to staff, get our food, eat some of it and send some of it back, and leave. Whew...it's only 12:30 and we are exhausted! 

We ordered the steak eyes: steak medallions were barely cooked rare. Almost bloody and completely red. DISGUSTING. We didn't eat the meat. We threw $11.99 down the drain with that one. Biscuits were also very try and there wasn't very much gravy at all on any of. Between dry and hard biscuits and the lack of gravy and raw meat, it was terrible. 

Chicken & waffles: it was ok. We won't ever get it again, but it was something that we wanted to try. 

Chicken finger bowl and truffle fries, minus buffalo sauce. Chicken was burnt. Fries were fresh and delicious, but chicken was BURNT. Asked for a new order. Instead of 6 pieces of chicken, a mini order with 3 pieces came out. Took it to go because it took so long to be remade. BOMB. 

I tried to be healthy so I ordered the pineapple whole wheat pancakes. They were decent. Very dry, though. Not sure if I love them. I ate one and threw the other in a box, which I will probably toss. 

Overall, food was WAY OFF. Not sure if they are training new cooks or what, but it stunk today. And for $50 for everyone to leave sort of eh, that wasn't good. I was disappointed. Fam was disappointed. 

Also, the food came out at all different times and some of us didn't get our food until others were almost done eating. Not good. 

Service wasn't good today either, and that surprises me more than the food because last time everyone was SO amazing! Today the poor staff was just trying to squeeze between people without dropping plates to deliver food. Register girl looked higher than a kite. 

Worst part of it all: people were yelling and fighting over tables. Seating system sucks and provokes people to fight for a seat. So lame. There should be a rule and system, that one must place an order and have a number before taking a table. And there should be a line on the left hand side isle way by the restroom where people should line up in order to get a table. Because when it's just that busy and wait times are that long and people are hungry, we were seeing the devil in them, and it wasn't pretty because I brought kids to breakfast, not a brawl.

The space itself is small with limited seating but has a very forgiving parking lot. You wait in line and order at the counter and they then give you a number and bring your food out to you. Due to the intimacy of the space this has become more of a to-go order spot for me rather than the sit down and enjoy your meal there kind of place.

Let me start by celebrating their menu and say that most everything I've tried has been tasty. They offer amazing healthy and happy options. Unfortunately, some of the menu items I love don't hold up well when you take them out. The Cherry Bomb wasn't put together well and the Burrito was sauced and caused it to be quite soggy when I arrived to my destination.

There's a healthy and happy side on the menu, I encourage you foodies to try both sides of the menu! Even their healthy side is really good! The items are fairly price as well, averaging around $10.00 per entree. They also serve some truffle fries that are really good with most of the entree. 

I've had most of their foods here, but for this review I had the cherry burger. This burger is just to die for. You can get the meat cooked to your preference and it's topped off with veggies and a  coleslaw topping. They also throw in a fried egg to bring everything togetjer. 

The only reason this review does not get 5 stars is because the location is very inconvenient and hard to find at times! Also the place is very limited in space so you might find your self vulcherjng for open tables against other people on busy hours!

I heard the concepts, I read the reviews, I thought it would be a match made in heaven because I'm skinny but I eat like I'm fat but it wasn't going down like that
First thing, the decor is nice but every time I went it felt so cramped and packed. I mean what's the point of a nice place if I can't appreciate it while eating my meal. 
Now, let's get to the food. I don't know about whichever yelper is reading this but when I order a Philly cheesesteak, Im expecting a good mix of  steak and onions/mushrooms instead of  just enough steak that the sandwich could've been called vegetarian. I would also like to apologize for getting in the way of the breakfast burrito and it's war on taste or spices of any kind. The ahi tacos were a pretty bomb surprise. I can get down with those, same for the BLT. The tacos were nice and saucy, a very welcome surprise and the BLT was a BLT but the proportions and the bacon was right. 
To be honest, I love the idea, I like what this could be but I gotta call it how I see it. This isn't bad but it sure isn't where it could be",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,8,6,3,Bb4rV3EvCA0wowvJsT8b_Q

In this case, we decided to do both. The food overall is pretty tasty, though portions CAN seem a bit small depending on how much of a piggy you are (I'm extra piggy so I could easily down two entrees). 

The Skinny Q was really tasty for me, though the GF crust was definitely GF (you can taste how crumbly it is), but the flavors were definitely there. Once again, portion is a tad small so you may want to order more.

Brussel Crowe: Not gonna lie--this didn't look that great; a hybrid between red vomit and chunky bird poop. Taste, however, was pretty good, once you get past the visuals.

Rosemary Jane: I looooove the Rosemary!! Yum yum!! Great concept, just wish the chicken was a little moister.

Yummus: Rosemary hummu--yup...more rosemary! This was absolutely delicious! A great appetizer/treat to get :)

I almost dont want to write a review just to keep it my little Vegas secret from the rest of the world who has yet to discover this delightful place nestled within some industrial buildings on Dean Martin Drive. 

I am a foodie who lives a pretty healthy life full of fitness and so most of my diet consists of healthier selections. When I found SkinnyFATS, my world was changed! They provide a nice big menu with a ""skinny"" side of options as well as a ""happy"" side of options. Both the happy and healthy dishes are both loaded with unique flavor which can be so hard for restaurants to accomplish. 

I have had both breakfast and lunch options, both healthy and happy. the whole wheat protein pancakes with two pieces of turkey bacon are a must anytime I go! I look at them as a dessert so I'll get them with one of the delicious sandwiches or other items they offer.

I love the atmosphere of this place and the staff always so helpful and friendly, ready to answer any questions you may have about the menu..they always have daily specials so be sure to check those out before making a final decision on what to order. It's ""casual"" dining in that you order at the counter and then find an open table and they bring you your order when it's ready.

5960074,2014-03-15,2,3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"First impression of SkinnyFats was most of the food we ordered was hit or miss. I came with some friends for lunch last weekend around 11. The place wasn't packed yet but it was getting there. We found a corner table and ordered at the counter once our entire party had arrived. 

I opted for the cranburkey with a side of slaw chee. We got truffle fries as well. My friends ordered various other items and we waited for our food. It came out pretty quickly. We ordered items from both the healthy and happy sides of the menu for good measure. The fries were tasty and very truffle-y. The cranburkey was a bit on the bland side. I have to admit, I'm not typically a big fan of turkey burgers so that May have been my own fault for ordering this. My friend was a little unimpressed with her salad, saying it was a little bland and wishing there was more flavor and diversity in texture. She enjoyed her turkey slider, though. My other friend got the drunken gypsy French toast and seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. I had been  tempted by the healthy breakfast items, so I'll likely go that way if I ever come back again.

Prices weren't horrible but it got pricy when we had add one and for drinks, which we ended up skipping. The restaurant is tiny and 30 minutes into our meal there were quite a few people hovering around waiting for tables so we didn't stay long to chat knowing people were waiting. This made it a less than ideal place to go if you're hoping to have a leisurely brunch with friends to catch up. 

SkinnyFats is bordering between a 3 and 4 star for me, but I think I'll need to give them another try to see if there are any other menu items I might enjoy more.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,3,oJz1WsCuUeD2yQdk0wduLQ

They had tons of options and both the skinny and fat sounded delicious. I ordered the curry noodles (from the fats side) and the guy who took my order asked me if I wanted to add protein to it. Since I have been a pescatarian for about 6 months now, I decided to add shrimp. My friend ordered a burger I think, and we shared a side of the cauliflower. I liked everything, I didn't give them 5 stars just because the description of my plate said ""crispy chick peas"" and they weren't so crispy, also because the cauliflower didn't have that much flavor. But other than that, everything was good. I also had a juice that was called the Hangover Curer. It was really good, and they have these cool plastic cups that are very resistant and can go in the dishwasher so you can reuse them, I loved that. Too bad we found this place on our last day in Vegas, otherwise I would have definitely gone there more times to check out other food items on their menu!

We arrived at an odd hour, and they were already busy.  I suspect that during lunch rush, it gets quite hectic.  Line up at the counter, place your order, hope for a table, and wait for your food to arrive.

Chix on Broadway was my choice (I think). I might be wrong.  It's been 8 months since we ate there.  It was a breaded chicken breast with yummy toppings/fillings and a yummy sauce inside tasty bread.  Was pretty good.  I ordered some Truffle fries with it, and it was tasty as well.   (3.5 stars)

Cherry Popper was my wife's pick.  We both liked her choice better than my own.  This burger was very good!!  I did not see any cherries popping inside it.  There is a 1/2 lb beef patty, fried egg, pepperjack, spicy slaw, and pepper marmalade in a Hawaiian roll.  Put all these ingredients, and it was exceptional!!  Paired nicely with the sweet potato fries she had.  (4.5 stars)

End your meal with one of their delicious cookies!!  Las Vegas has so many great restaurants.  SkinnyFats is one of the better ones we've tried.  As a tourist, it will be awhile til I return.

Like everyone already said, it's hard to find. Although they do have little signs on the lamp posts that let you know you missed the building, cause it's bound to happen.  The restaurant is just too small, although I did go over lunch and it was incredibly busy. But it was off-putting. We couldn't sit until someone else got up from a table, and that just felt a tad awkward.

I ordered the burger benedict. It was OK. Apart from the fried egg in the burger, nothing was ""benedict"" about the burger. I was thinking it would have hollandaise on it or something a bit more. And the burger meat was slightly underseasoned. The truffle fries are epic though and very addicting.

The bf had the neato burrito. It was a breakfast burrito. Nothing remarkable about it.

We tried them at Bite of Las Vegas and actually enjoyed it more there. I got the Chix on Broadway there, which was super yummy. Bacon makes everything better. We also tried the ahi siracha tacos. I know these are one of their best sellers, but I just thought they were OK.

For the sandwich- the avocado was bland, the eggs were bleh, and the bread was so thick it didn't allow me to enjoy the rest of the ingredients.
The chicken and waffles were ordinary. Chicken was good, waffles were not overdone.
