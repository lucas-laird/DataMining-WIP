Came in with a group of 10 and were quickly and effectively seated, the staff was super friendly, and although the venue is pretty small, it's an overall positive experiences. Now the food was DELICIOUS! I had the torta ahogada and it was to die for. Everything I expected and more. Being from Guadalajara, my palette is pretty spoiled, and let me tell you, their tortas truly give them a run for their money. I also tried the cueritos and buche and those as well were great.

We ordered birria estilo Jalisco, and a torta ahogada. The birria was tender, delicious, and the broth was extremely flavorful. Paired with some corn torillas, lemon and onion... Dish from Mexican heaven. 

The torta ahogada (which I didn't have high expectations) was a solid B. The bread is the hard part for me, since I am from Guadalajara, there is a particular bread called birote, that can only be properly made in the state of Jalisco. Don't ask why, that is just that, it's a bread specific to the region and it makes the whole torta special. 
They do bake a pretty similar bread here, and it gets you close to the real thing, totally worth trying if you miss home and a good torta ahogada!",d9zjXhZz5442V1GAmxRBcw,0,0,4,lY0PxrZj4IDB7NTmu6GQ8g

Fancied by a few local fine dining Chefs as their go-to for the authentic flavors of Western Mexico, it was just past eight o'clock on Friday night that the dining room at Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara was found sparsely populated, a team of two servers plus two cooks making up for limited English skills with some truly delicious food and excellent service to match it.

Decorated with the restaurant's logo, maps of Mexico and some handmade pottery for sale near the door, Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara features table service both indoors and al fresco from a carefully curated menu written only in Spanish, the focus on braised Meats including several styles of Goat noteworthy, though the restaurant's eponymous Sandwich is undoubtedly promoted as a ""must have"" item.

Doing the small things that matter to stand out, Breads and Tortillas both made on-site with all Meats braised in-house daily, those looking for variety are invited to try any of the restaurant's big flavors by way of Tacos with 1-lb portions also offered alongside Tortillas for larger parties, a total of $35 after tax and tip yielding a substantial amount of food with an additional $7.50 added for an oversized Michelada.

Waiting just a few minutes for the bulk of an order, items rolling out as ready from the kitchen, first bites of a Pork Skin Taco were fatty and succulent without a lot of acid to wash out the funkiness while a follow-up Fried Taco stuffed with ground Beef was unfortunately a bit oily, the Carrot slice on top packing a big wallop of heat while the pickled Onions, sliced Radish and Slaw helped to balance out the piquant orange Sauce beneath it.

Ready to tuck into the sopping wet Sandwich just as more Tacos arrived, each divided in two and lightly topped with Lime, Onions or one of two Salsas provided in squeeze bottles, one would be hard-pressed to decide whether the Barbacoa Goat or Al Pastor Pork offered more flavor, the Carne Asada unfortunately a bit too dry, perhaps as a result of the late time of arrival.

Finally getting around the Torta, slow cooked hunks of Pork literally fork-tender on a bun somewhat akin to Baguette that was still crunchy despite being fully saturated with spicy Tomato Sauce, suffice it to say that the specialty from Jalisco is every bit worth its name on the marquee, a traditional dessert from the region one part Flan and one part Crème Brûlée with just enough sugar to compliment the egginess. 

****Not exactly the sort of place likely to receive critical attention, both the location and understated signage directed mostly at its local population, Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara is a strong reminder of the rich Ethnic heritage found just a few miles East of Las Vegas Boulevard - the sort of place where low prices pair with a lot of passion to give diners an experience tourists would never imagine exist in a city known for $1,000 bottle service.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,4,vcSsa7wIOnA3jV068DBlwA

What's also amazing is their array of hot sauces they have for your extra condiment pleasure. The waitress brings them to your table, introduces each one and tells u what to expect as far as spice level. We didn't dare try the habanero since the one below that (the one recommended for the torta) was plenty spicy! 

Service is friendly and restaurant is clean! Loved it here. 

We'll definitely be back since my mom lives across the street from this gem!",uH55xcUgTW_KKTAPn2gzqw,0,1,5,AVpVmA0geB1v5CpK0WlNZQ

Really took me back to Guadalajara and visiting with my family.

The tortas ahogadas are on point!!!!

They have several spicy sauces to try from.


But honestly why I loved the most was the tacos de Cueritos. When I was a lot younger and would go to Mexico for summer vacation, sundays were the days to go to the local butcher shop. They would prep chicharones in huge frying ""tubs""? And offer tacos to customers. These little morsels reminded me of that. 

And they have micheldas I mean can you really complain!!",1rhMSS8vg3Jvst_QDzfhTQ,0,0,5,ckUcjj-cOM-SsHwRAlLyAw

Tacos are $3.00 and a michelada is $7.00.  The place is clean, service was great but $36. For 3 tortas and 3 sodas

 The sauce and all fixins' are packed for you on the side. The bread is chewy,  yet firm enough to withstand the sauce. I really enjoyed it. Also picked up a carnitas taco with enough filling to make 2 tacos. Potato canasta taco was just alright. And lastly a chicharon/bean canasta taco was more beans than meat, will pass on ordering this again.

I will definitely be back. Service was quick and the food came out within just a few minutes as well.

FYI: 75 cent surcharge on credit cards.",6mbs-goaegWcy2Q_AWTEcA,0,0,4,XCbayZ3ZRIR5XGH_PVjjzw
