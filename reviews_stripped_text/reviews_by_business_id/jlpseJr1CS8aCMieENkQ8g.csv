52730,2012-08-16,0,jlpseJr1CS8aCMieENkQ8g,"While staying in Vegas, I woke up one morning to find that my bf had picked up bagels and caffeine for breakfast.  There were about 6 different varieties in the box - I sampled all of course - and thought they were all scrumptious.  The bagels were perfectly toasted; still soft and chewy, just how I like.  He also bought 3 tubs of schmear (cream cheese spread); reduced fat, strawberry, and honey almond.  The honey almond was by far both of our favorite.

My usual fat-free latte was surprisingly pretty good.  He didn't comment on his coffee, so it must have been satisfactory.  :o)

If you're looking for yummy bagels, I would definitely recommend this place.  I myself prefer spending superfluous amounts of calories on dessert.",c_R6fDn5gSgmadEcw1eadA,0,0,3,KQceVfJzBtuMMylC_9d4oQ

Then I was like ok, I want a caramel macchiato. He mumbled something under his breath, so thinking that he couldn't make it, I started to say ""ok then I'll have something else."" He bit back with ""NO! Do you want iced or heated?!"" I said iced.

It was quiet inside but there were still a couple of people waiting around for their orders. There looked to be plenty on offer but the ever-trusty combination of bacon and egg won me over. My wife picked something else, but her being a vegetarian it did not have bacon in it and therefore was of no concern to me and I promptly forgot what it was. While ordering my eyes wandered over the assorted delicious looking treats on offer and without even thinking about it a container of pumpkin bagel poppers somehow ended up on the counter before me. 

The wait for our food seemed to be quite long, which I hoped meant that the bacon and egg going into my bagel, and shortly my stomach, was going to be fresh. Once we got our bagels they were quite delicious and filled the bagel-sized holes in our stomachs nicely. The pumpkin poppers were quite good too, a little sweet and sticky, but worthy of going back for more.

This one is pretty good.  The seating area is less cramped than many other Einstin Bros establishments I have visited.  Service is generally friendly, speed is decent, though I confess I have not been here when they were jammed with customers.  

A few oddities about this location: when you enter the door, there is a big sign hanging over the counter that says ""Order Here.""  You should ignore it, and go to the OTHER end of the counter where it says ""Pay Here"" to both place your order and pay for it.  I don't know why they chose to deviate from standard Einstein Bros protocol, but you'll thank me when you are not wasting your time at the ""Order Here"" end until someone shouts at you from behind the counter to go to the other end.  

Also unlike most EB's, rather than calling out your name when your order is ready, they will actually come out to the seating area and find you.  A nice touch.  

Food is the usual quality at an Einstein Bros, which is to say: good.  I'm not convinced they have the ""best bagels in Vegas"" as another reviewer is, but I have never been let down.

If you stand on the left side (by the condiments) you'll have a decent view of this. I ordered two toasted bagels with cream cheese, orange juice and a coffee. Everything seemed fine and well prepared, except for the coffee. The coffee there was terrible! They're coffee pots sit where the condiments are, and all 4 or 5 of the pots (different blends) tasted like hot dish water. However, it looked like coffee, but then when you put cream in the cup, it turned into apple juice. 

That gives you the direct indication that who ever prepared the coffee, did not put enough coffee grounds in the filter. Not a big deal to just ask them to brew a new pot, but it becomes annoying and frustrating when you're in a hurry like I was. 

They receive a high volume of college kids every day since it's right across from UNLV. And because of the high volume, this explains that the quality of their items may slip from time to time.

The cold, inclement weather would drive me home, whence i would enter the basement and peak into the pantry. Starving my ass off I would grab one of those bagels you'd buy at one of those wholesale stores, in packs of 50. I would devour the vaguely ""fresh"" raisin bagel and immediately head off to mop floors or start an MIT problem set that would be due the next day. These were the kind of bagels that kept me alive while I succumbed to the masochism of the Boston/Cambridge college life. The bagels I would eat after a horrendously brutal crew workout. The poor bagels earned a dark, treacherous connotation, a symbol of my entrance into the brutal nature of adult life.

Freshmen year ended, and flew off to Las Vegas, NV to begin a fellowship at UNLV. Couldn't ask for a better job; great professors, new friends, cool dorm, and being surrounded by restaurants. However, waking up in the morning got no easier. Luckily, right across the street from campus, conveniently approached by a lighted crosswalk, lay Einstein Bros. The 1920s-ish fresco art looked familiar. Wait a second, this was the same shit they sold at the Costco in Somerville, in those wholesale bags!
My first real experience with a fresh, wholesome bagel came in the form of a cinnamon raisin with a strawberry shmear. I expected the same crappy shit my fraternity would buy during those torturously long house meetings. But when I took the first bite, I was like ""Oh my fucking god!"" I was immediately enveloped in culinary estasy. The cream chesse melted in my mouth; the bagel was a heavenly assertion that I had met higher ends of life. 
It only got better. Honey almond wheat with an almond shmear. I wanted to freeze that point in time and live in happiness forever. Even better with the hazelnut coffee.

4260137,2012-01-13,0,jlpseJr1CS8aCMieENkQ8g,"First off, I used to eat these bagels up all the time when I worked in a real estate office (you could never be your goal weight at a real estate office- and I worked at three of those offices), that is until I found out that each one was about 500 calories! So then, I'd just have half of one, and the other half at another time. These bagels are super soft (not hard like the supermarket brands). My favorite was the cranberry one; blueberry was my second choice.

I had gotten two gift cards over Christmas (total of $20), and so we came here for lunch on sunday. I got the turkey panini (spinach, bacon, tomatoes with onion & chive shmear) and my husband got the turkey sandwich, everything bagel (sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato with onion & chive shmear)- you can also customize these sandwiches to your liking (didn't know that when we ordered)- many different shmears and type of bread. My husband chose the cheddar sun chips as his side, while I chose an orange (also, apples are available). Both sandwiches were really good; yes, we split them. When my husband asked which one I liked better, I couldn't decide, I liked them both. (Check the site for nutritional information.) 

There's also egg sandwiches, snacks (similar to Starbucks), and coffee, oops, almost forgot about the many different bagels- classic bagels (plain, everything), bagel-thins (plain, everything, honey-wheat), signature bagels (blueberry, cranberry, sesame seed, cinnamon sugar, chocolate chip, etc.), gourmet bagels (power bagel, six cheese, dutch apple)- 24 types in these categories, bagel poppers, and bulk bagels (popular for offices). 

There were a lot of people dining in when we went inside, but when we were seated, the crowd diffused (popular place). You order it (right side), pay for it (left side), and take your seats; someone will bring it to you when it's ready (toasted and warmed). Coffee and drinks (free refills) are located to the left of the restaurant, facing UNLV and Maryland Parkway. Clean location. There were three people working here. Bathrooms are toward the other entrance/exit doors. Upon entering (to your right), there is an adjoining door to Wells Fargo Bank.

It just takes an average Joe that is up for a cup of coffee and a bagel to snack on to realize that. I am one of the average Joe's to realize it. 

  Throughout the years when I had been in the vicinity of UNLV, I have sometimes stopped in this Einstein Brothers Bagels. The times that I have stopped here were when I was in the mood for both coffee and a bagel. The major advantage that this Einstein Brothers Bagels has over their closest competitors Starbuck's and Coffee Bean are bagels. This is an advantage that has sometimes caused me to chose Einstein Brothers Bagels over their nearest competitors. 

  Being that it is directly across Maryland Parkway from the UNLV Student Union, it is surprising that their parking lot never fills up. However, it is not surprising that the bagel case never fills up. So where I rarely have a problem finding a parking space outside, I sometimes have a problem finding the bagel that I want inside. And today was one of those days where they were out of poppyseed and sesame bagels. Apparently Einstein is not a genius at managing?

  Speaking of managing, the ordering system has been different from the other Einstein Brothers Bagels that I have visited. The usual protocol when ordering here is that you order at the right of the counter then move past the bagel case to the register to pay. Here, I have ordered and paid at the left of the bagel case. Usually the employee that I pay has been a nice and overworked woman. 

  This is a relatively large location where I never had a problem finding a table unlike Sunset at Stephanie or Blue Diamond at Dean Martin. When I walk with my cup to the coffee there are no worries over somebody trying to take my seat. On account of the fact that it is not overly busy and that coffee refills are complimentary this is an ideal spot to relax. As far as coffee goes, Einstein Brothers holds their own. If you put me in a blind taste test, the reality is that I wouldn't be able to differentiate this from Starbuck's or Coffee Bean. You would not need to put me in a blind taste test for me to say that I like Einstein Brothers Coffee over Mothership. Now that I reviewed their coffee what about their bagels? For purposes of making this review easier to read, I will discuss this in the following paragraph. 

  When it comes to coffee, Einstein Brothers faces intense competition in the Maryland Parkway UNLV corridor. However, when it comes to bagels, it is a totally different situation. In my opinion, Las Vegas is short of bagel shops. From Centennial Hills to Boulder City they are too far and few between. Although, Einstein Brothers only survived in the bagel rich New York City market for a couple of months because they couldn't compete, in Las Vegas they are a major player in the bagel market. The closest mom and pop competitor to this location is Harry's Bagelmania. In my opinion Einstein Brothers is just as good and more reasonably priced. I rate an Einstein Brothers bagel three stars. 

  I am certainly no Einstein. However, when it comes to bottomless coffee and a bagel sandwich, I have enough brains to stop at Einstein.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,16,14,3,GqhFAQ2Q-SC1gnseJ2k8EQ

I sent a friend in to get me an Onion bagel and he came out with a Plain because he said the onion bagels weren't ready.  
I thought to myself ""they weren't ready, whatever!!""
So i contently took a bite of my plain bagel and realized why the Onion bagels weren't ready...its because they bake their bagels FRESH DAILY!!
The bagel that was consuming (like it was my last meal) was the best bagel I had ever had.  The crispyness of the edges (toasted) to the soft inside and covered with a generous amount of cream cheese! WOW!
Need I say more.?
I was so impressed ..that I woke up early the next morning to grab another bagel before I headed back to LA!  THATS HOW DAMN GOOD THEIR BAGELS ARE!!!!",Ynu2Z2L8Wv2fbTwQ_8LFqQ,1,1,4,V9Jv_tohlzSDD4u0tGBPPA

It was painful to wait that long. I was so mad and didn't even want to eat after. Shame on the managers for not Hiring more people.

We were famished, had hours until we were going to be able to get home and grab some food. Naturally, nothing was open because Spring Break had just started so this place was basically our only option that morning. 

As somebody who isn't too hip on grains, and has a personal vendetta against bagels, I wasn't too excited to eat here. I was going to try some yogurt, but realized that it costs about the same as soup, so I grabbed that, after my sister ordered a bagel with cream cheese and chives. I wish I would have known prior to her ordering that my cup of broccoli cheddar soup came with a bagel so I didn't have to end up paying for the one she ordered. 

Anyway, we both got the asiago cheese bagel, which was decent. The soup, which was in a cup, was a sufficient amount but I wasn't raving over the flavor. For $7 and some change, we were tided over until we could get some protein from home.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,0,3,z5r59h-c7vCS53k1YKSfxg
