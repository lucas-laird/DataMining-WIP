We were greeted right away by the friendly cashier and ordered our food. There were plenty of tables open, but if it was really busy you might have issues finding seating. I ordered the small italian with hot peppers added onto it. It was so tasty and so fresh. Everything from the bread to the meat and cheese and veggies were perfect. I ordered chips and a drink on the side and I had the other half of my sandwich to take home. One of the workers saw we were done and came by to give us to go boxes without us having to ask. All in all, it was a great trip in and out and I highly recommend the italian. It blows all other sandwiches from anywhere else away!",40V_mrP1nOcGVnh6VoVKmA,0,0,5,hRy5tXRLq5N40XHsvP9rog

Store was not busy, especially since they were having POS issues and could not take cards. 

Not to make this completely negative, the food was good, just disappointed in the condition of the store, especially in ""upscale"" downtown summerlin.

1451404,2015-07-29,0,pYu6GDIfdK1RfwgUKeeDYg,"I like the location and typically enjoy the bobbie sandwich when visiting any Capriotti's location. With the advent of this location, the menu options expanded. Unlike other Capriotti restaurants that I am familiar with, you can get soups and salads at this location.

For lunch they offer a small sub and soup combination for around $8.50. After some shopping, we decided to dine-in and enjoy one of their soup/sandwich combination. Unfortunately, you get mostly bread with this sandwich and 3/4 of a bowl of soup for that price.  I ordered the meatball sub with clam chowder soup. I was told the meatballs are made fresh here, but I can't really tell you how they tasted as the bread and cheese smothered the two very small meatballs on the sub (see picture). The soup was good - nothing great. 

The restaurant quickly becomes dirty and the flow is not dining friendly either. I would only take away a medium or large sub. I would not dine-in and order anything else for that price, portion, or dinning environment. 

I debated a 2-star for this visit. However, since I have had amazing Bobbie sandwich to-go orders at this location, I awarded a 3-stars overall.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,0,0,3,6yZSM3ynsK5GDFAlaL8qfA

This store is different from the rest as it is a flagship store and they are making changes to their menu and the storefronts. This store is much larger than the usual ones and has plenty of room for dining inside. If you order your food to eat there they give you a number and bring the food to you. They also serve your food on real dishes with actual silverware. The service was great and so was the staff. This store also offered soups and freshly made salads in addition to the usual yummy sandwiches. I ordered from the new Capture 2 menu which is one half a sandwich and either a salad or bowl of soup. I got the Bobbie and BBQ Chicken Salad. I've had the Bobbie many times before and it was delicious as usual. I had never had the salad before but it was absolutely delicious and I will definitely order it again. Just enough food to fill me up. We also tried a sample of the chicken soup which was yummy too.

This Summerlin location is reaching for new heights with the updated design and increased standards on food presentation and quality. Even the bread was fresher at this location.  The balsamic salad was also quite tasty with the dried cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese crumbles, over a bed of spring mix.  Very good salad!

My family has been going to Capriottis for years and we have NEVER had such a bad experience.  When we walked in there was a nice girl at the front that greeted us - that was the only positive thing and the rest went downhill from there. There were maybe 3 other couples there waiting for food. We placed our order of 1 small cheesesteak and 1 large homemade turkey.  We waited for about 15 minutes (which was longer than it took us to vote) and were finally given our bag of sandwiches.  As we were walking out I noticed it didn't seem the same as our usual. What I found inside the bag was 1 small cheesesteak and 2 smaller turkey sandwiches.  I walked back in and was greeted by another employee, and I explained that my order didn't seem right. A small sandwich is 9"".  How do two small sandwiches (which were actually smaller than a 9""small sandwich) equal 20""?  He just looked at me like I was crazy. I then asked for a manager , but only a supervisor was available. She really could have cared less about why I was disappointed.  She repeated herself telling me that we still received the same amount of meat and cheese and that they had run out of bread.  There is no way there was the same amount. She said that I could wait for more bread but again it will have the same amount of bread and cheese.  I really didn't want to wait any longer, so we left.  When we got home it was worse than I thought. The steak sandwich had hardly any meat on it and it was burned and crunchy.  The turkey sandwich was almost as bare, and they decided to grill our side order of peppers???  The bread tasted old and sandwich was dry.

I was told that the email was a mistake and that they weren't honoring it. They were in the wrong and they should take responsibility for it and honor the email. I worked in retail for years and when we miss a ""buy one get one 50% off"", we still honor it when a customer points it out. Then, we take the sign down for future customers.

For those of you who don't know, they were created in the First State. My go to is the Cole Turkey, which is their house roasted turkey, cole slaw, provolone cheese, and Russian dressing (I omit the mayo). The sandwich is always dependably delicious. It has the  right balance of flavors and textures. I'd say one of the highlights is the bread and it has a crusty yet chewy texture. A small is the right size for me and runs roughly $7 - my husband gets a medium typically.

In addition, they didn't have any bottled water for sale - in Las Vegas on a 106 degree day. (We politely spoke with a manager and said the cashier needed help/training and noted that we were disappointed there was no water.) Of course, after all that, we opened our sandwiches  on Mt Charleston and three of four were completely wrong. (Who ever heard of a Bobbie on square sandwich bread?!)

Service:  You order at the counter.  Cashiers were friendly and met us with a smile.  Food was brought out to our table by a server.  He was quick to ask if we needed extra plates or utensils.  We had to request for the peppers.  But other than that, no complaints with service.
Food:  They pretty much have the same menu if I recall.  I went with the basic and got the Bobbie, Cheesesteak, and the Pastrami.  I was never a fan of the Bobbie.  But the cheesesteak and pastrami were both pretty good.  Was it the best sandwich ever, no.  But it was good.  We got the large and it was pretty darn big.  Easily could have been split.  I got the turkey chili and thought it was bland.  We also ordered the balsamic chicken salad and that was ok (a tad too much dressing).  

All in all, a decent sandwich shop.  Prob not one that I would drive out of the way for.",pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg,0,0,4,b0ko3OrvI_cyVoWdvTT9Sg

You can get subs, salads and soups here, all look excellent.  Opted to go with the Cheesesteak, Capastrami and the famous ""Bobbie"", of the 3 I liked the Capasrami the best, but all were very good.

The Cheesesteak is traditional, with an option for onions, Sweet and Hot Peppers included.  Get them, makes the sandwich.

The ""Bobbie"" is basically Thanksgiving on a bun, Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Homemade Stuffing and Mayo.

The Capastrami, their take on pastrami.  This was amazing!  Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Swiss Cheese and Russian Dressing.  The flavor of the pastrami with all the other topping is rich, but sooo good.  

The have Pepsi products for their drink selection which is a plus, as well as iced tea of course.

Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed.

4835406,2014-11-02,2,pYu6GDIfdK1RfwgUKeeDYg,"Another great Capriotti's store.

During this visit I got a cheese steak with extra onions, mushrooms, and I added cole slaw. There have been times where I ordered the extra mushrooms at other stores and I end up not getting it. This wasn't one of those times. Mushrooms were all over the place and in every bite I took. This was probably the best cheese steak I have gotten at a Capriotti's in recent memory.

Also at this store, since I ate inside, my food came on a plate. It was a nice touch just being able to dig right in instead of ripping apart all of the paper like I normally would.

I don't know if they plan on doing this all of the time or just because they recently opened, but there were employees walking around checking up on everyone, asking how their meal was, clearing plates,  and offering to refill sodas. 

The food was excellent as usual, and there was a extra dose of good customer service. I look forward to coming back.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,1,1,5,9zfFZW0EtR7WVX3mJLlyqA

I wanted to knack attack,a Hawaii slang for like you want to sleep after eating something so good, after I was half way through my second half of my sandwich.

5094665,2015-07-13,33,pYu6GDIfdK1RfwgUKeeDYg,"If you're a tourist like me visiting Sin City then I highly recommend you try this place! 

I was introduced to Capriotti's by my girlfriend who kept raving about this place and I trusted her word since she use to be a local in Nevada. Well I can honestly say she's made me a fan!! 

I tried ""The Bobbie"" which is your whole thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich. All you're hopes and dreams will come true after sinking your teeth into this heavenly creation. Well maybe not but that's how I felt after my first bite lol. I was expecting a warm toasty sandwich but instead it was cold to my surprise! Nonetheless it was still delicious. But if you want it served warm then you need to request that so just FYI if you want it served warm. Thanks for that tip Michael D.

All the ingredients in this sandwich include homemade turkey, cranberry, stuffing, and mayo. 

When I eat a sandwich and its served on a sub roll the bread can be a bit much but I have to say the bread they use here is by far thee best I've ever had! It's very soft, fresh, and pillowy. Trust me you will love it! 

I ordered a small and when I got it I was surprised at how big it was! Well for me it was but what a deal at $7.29 I'd say it's well worth it. 

I shared my other half with my friend as she ordered the Slaw Be Jo and it gave me a chance to try 2 different sandwiches. This sandwich has homemade roast beef, provolone cheese, russian dressing, mayo, and coleslaw which I'm not a fan of but I was willing to give it a try. The outcome? It was pretty good! The cole slaw wasn't too sweet and I liked how it added a crunch to the sandwich. The roast beef was delicious as well. 

I can't wait to go back and try The Bobbie warm next time. They do have locations in Cali so I'm super excited about that. Give this place a try!",A4bsa7ykYRVCnb4h2vZALw,39,36,4,JD1tEjPWV-sLi0p9nbtytQ

Another favorite is the Capastrami - Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw.

Bread is sometimes too carby for me so I ask them to pick out some so it's not too heavy.  Sandwiches are great for take out for eating later and big enough for sharing.",7J6Hb7VuTsJq50iiNwqvCg,6,4,5,AKRpI00nnzNcZ7w_QzJrtA

VEGGIE CHEESE STEAK ($7.19): I was so disappointed and a tinge annoyed to find that there is no veggie ""steak"" in this sandwich! How are you going to put the word 'steak' in a sandwich that has no steak?? Instead, there was blasted fake chicken inside the sub. And for all the meat eaters out there, there is indeed a vegetarian steak option (Morningstar Farms carries it and local food truck Garden Grill makes a REAL cheese steak sandwich). I felt duped and didn't care for the taste of the sandwich and would never ever, ever, ever order it again.  

Worth a Return Visit?
I like the location at Aliante better, but I if I was in the area I'd eat at this Capriotti's again. I'll stick to my usual tasty veggie turkey subs.

I arrived a little after noon and there was no crowd but maybe 10'minutes later the line was out the door. 

It is not overly clear whether the customer is supposed to throw away their trash or if the staff clears it. A number of tables had food/trash left on them, but there was a trash can and bins for plates and bowls at the very back. It might benefit them to add another trash can or station towards the front of the store to avoid people leaving trash.",M85_Tg0ukZqpke8U3smDyg,0,0,4,RY7a8RcfK1IctTIXpO0hpw
