From the Aria website: ""Refresh and refuel while overlooking the beautiful pool deck and lush landscaping in a casual al fresco dining setting. Breeze Café offers innovative, healthy and fresh gourmet cuisine in a modern café setting.""

What I tried:

Chicken panini sandwich ($15) - Good
Lobster Wrap- Good
Club Sandwich with fries ($15)
Hamburger with fries- Average
Nachos with guacamole- Average

This cafe is located next to the pool.  Came with friends (party of 9). 3 people had beers and cocktails with their food.  Bill came out to around $500 with tip (approx $55 per person).  Kind of pricey for just average pool side lunch food.  Service was not good.  Waitress did not check on our table after food and beverages arrived.  Had to wave down busser for utensils.  Some orders did not come out as requested (ie., well done hamburger, no mayo, etc).

My friend ordered the nachos and they not only tasted great, but we're beautifully plated. I have has ""pool food"" all over Vegas and really enjoyed our lunch....",0Umxw4twnwksfMVT7HPMTA,0,0,5,C3z2kUrb1xObKqWR7ecetg
1079115,2010-05-05,1,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,"I know what to expect from the menu of  a cafe located at a hotel pool, and this didn't surprise - burgers, club sandwiches, nachos.  Yawn.
I won't deduct any stars for that, since they are only giving the tourists what they probably want, but at a hotel like Aria, I expect that food to be executed well and this wasn't.
The location is beautiful, but the service was mediocre.  Our waiter certainly seemed to be trying, but was confused by my request for the chopped salad with the meat on the side.  I explained that I was sharing with my friend, who is a vegetarian.  After taking the order, he asked again about what I wanted on the side.  When he later came back and asked a third time, I just knew it wasn't going to be right, even though I tried explaining again: meat on the side.  Sure enough the bacon was on the side, but the chicken was mixed in.  Luckily my friend wasn't picky about it.  But, the bacon was disappointing - that crappy shredded, pre-cooked stuff you can buy in a bottle.
The other dish we split was Vietnamese Summer Rolls.  The vegetarian option was $15 and though I know things are overpriced at Strip hotels, what I received was ridiculous.  The roll was 90% shredded cabbage, no visible cilantro, vermicelli, or seasoning.  It came with a small amount of bland peanut sauce artfully piped over the top, but was only enough to flavor your first bite, the rest was pretty much raw cabbage.  My soda was $4.50, but the cappuccino was $5.  Since when is a cappuccino 50 cents more than a fountain drink?  That's weird.
Oh well, I guess if you are hungry and at the pool, you don't have many options.  I just wish these new hotels that say they are going to bring a whole new level of service and first-class experience to Vegas would try a little harder.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,2,0,2,SN2aQTnHCrsUm0WX9bAtlA
1346602,2010-05-19,0,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,"I guess this is what you should expect poolside at Aria. Windy, overpriced bad food. $20 burgers and 1 lb. hot dogs that scare small children. Slow service and secluded location make this cafe a must miss. If your hungry and eager to be poolside change locations all together. Interesting items on menu like country friend bacon but unfortunately just not good. Go to the Hard Rock for some quality poolside entertainment and food.",-hyFCHaFwSOe_fpsLBEmrg,1,0,2,m2U7shcWJDEQZ4UwZbSVEA

Food was expensive, but what did you expect from Aria? My breakfast burrito and tater tots were pretty good. I also got a comically large beer for a pretty reasonable price. Our server was very friendly. I have no complaints about her.",VSRtEK_c84oJygZ0OX0Oqg,0,0,4,6lx4p8AzRbj1BjTFUTEITw
1875558,2010-05-25,0,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,"Avoid this place if you can!  Breeze Cafe is Aria's poolside outdoor restaurant, which serves your typical poolside menu -- burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, etc.  The majority of the staff appeared to be confused and overwhelemed. While our server seemed to be trying, she was incredibly slow and unattentive.  The cooks must also have been lost or really overwhelmed.  We sat there for 10 minutes before someone brought us water.  And then literally waited 40 minutes for our food (a hot dog and a bowl of fruit!) -- how long does it take to grill a hot dog and dish up pre-cut fruit??  The food was mediocore, as expected. 

This place as potential, but the managers at Breeze Cafe should really revisit training of their staff.",kAeqEOGvQyI6quLXv8y1hQ,1,0,1,Zf_9-1dd9QaiuGeqUcpf0Q

Everything at Aria on Sunday morning was packed, so we headed to the pool for some grub.  A lot of pool dining poses a major PIGEON issue, not at Breeze, but there was quite a big wind tunnel, so literally there is a BREEZE.

No wait, quick and peppy service.  My Pesto Shrimp Caesar could have been better, but they have solid white meat Chicken Teriyaki bowls with plenty of veggies.  Only WHITE rice though.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,2,1,3,nsRkzM4JrFDEWwEuHE9jSg

3372070,2012-08-26,13,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,"I've always been an obedient daughter, so when mom said to keep hydrated in Vegas, I made sure to drink plenty of liquids. 

I had a Bombay East cooler to start the long afternoon of sunning at the pool, it was made with Bombay Sapphire gin, lots of muddled mint, cucumber, lime and club soda. Aaaahhhh. Save your cucumbers and use 'em as an eye patch! 

Minutes later, I was wondering where did my drink go?! No worries, we also picked up a pitcher of red Sangria ($24 for 32 oz) made with Absolut Grapevine vodka, red wine and blueberries! How great is it that you get your serving of fruit too? Mama sure is proud of her daughter!

Mom also said to never drink on an empty stomach so we shared the juicy Breeze Burger and their buffalo wings.  It seems counter-intuitive to eat spicy food when it's 100 degrees out, but sometimes, there ain't no thing like a chicken wang!  ;D

Mama sure knows best and I always listen to mine.",Z88N6qly3Dp5C06XbZ9IMQ,13,13,4,90Bu2FVhllzUNHxvV_Zvog

Don't even try to get breakfast items after 11am. Still, my BLT and fries were good and my travelin' man appeared to enjoy his rice bowl. It was food. It was poolside. At a nice hotel. We ate it.

And surprisingly... It's not too bad!

We missed the breakfast boat (surprise.. surprise), so we were only offered up the lunch which does have a decent array.  It's not expansive, but it has fancier end burgers, salads, and sandwiches.

I had the mahi mahi served with fresh veggies.  It was light and perfect for post-laying out.  I am certain a burger would cause a little food baby to emerge. That's a pretty sight. My friend had the chopped salad which was served in an odd shaped bowl, but still pretty tasty and light.  

The bloody marys.. wowsers! These small numbers pack a lot of a punch! They were spicy, and we didn't feel it until we got up and said, ""Wow! There goes the Grey Goose.""  Nevertheless, it was pretty tasty.

The other dining option at pool is made to order salads that the ladies in the Dallas Cowboy/American Gladiator-esque outfits serve up.  The later wave of friends went w/ that option, and had sad looking salads that were just about the same amount as the food at Breeze.  

So TIP: Get to the pool, claim your loungers and mark yourterritory w/ magazines, a pair flips, and then head to Breeze for a real meal.",vD65y5E3Az3bFc6UW4G1eA,2,2,4,NzE2fZ8e6MKZ5qz-SCq5Dg

I dont know why I ordered sushi but I did and I had to send it back. It did not look good at all.
Ended up with a chicken quesadilla..for $15 bucks.
It was ok..not great.
The overpriced drink I had was the highlight of the meal.

4867001,2012-03-14,0,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,"We were starving after laying-out by the pool and decided to grab something nearby.  Sadly, it was not the best idea.  First of all I am a vegetarian/pescatarian and like things a certain way.  Both my friend and I saw items on the menu that looked good, but we wanted to add eggs.  The girl at the cash register said she would check with the chef and see what he says.  She returned and told us the chef would not accommodate our request so rather than leaving we settled for something else.  I was really livid about the egg thing though.  Seriously, eggs are the EASIEST thing to make ""what a LAZY ASS CHEF"" was the first thing that came to mind when she rejected our requests.  I ordered the bagel and lox there was plenty of salmon and it was tasty, HOWEVER it was way overpriced ($14+) and hard for me to enjoy since I was so frustrated with the lack of service.  I also have to mention the wait time, lox and a bagel should only take a couple of minutes if that and it felt like we were waiting for 20+ minutes.  I will not be back again Breeze Café.",BlCUcLsQwaRBfNDcDs6VpQ,2,1,2,Gs0ifnJxzwKZ0RPFqzv2kQ
4931247,2010-08-10,0,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,This was the first place we ate at when we arrived at the Aria Hotel.  We threw on our bathing suits and went straight out to the pool and we were starving from traveling.  For starters we ordered the Chips and Salsa appetizer.  It came with 4 dips.  A bean dip and 3 other salsas.  The food portions are huge here and served with interesting style.  My girlfriend ordered a Caeser Salad and it came with actual anchovies on the salad.  So if you don't like to see fish on your salad make sure you tell them to hold the Anchovies.  While we were waiting for our food we saw a 1 lb. hot dog arrive at the table next to us.  What a site to see that was. You can check out the pic that I posted if you are interested.  My husband and I split a Club Sandwich.  It was super good.,CY7a6eE6GOcYySFjk0HJUw,0,0,5,RQTnOUgltM6kc3VX9UKy7g
5199265,2010-10-19,2,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,"Eating poolside at Aria (which as a hotel, I am officially in love with now) should be hard to mess up, right? Sadly, Breeze has the sad honor of being the first place at which I have sent back a dish in quite some time. Plus, there were a lot of bugs buzzin' about. 

To be brief: there was little flavor in the dishes here, and when you are spending $15 for sandwiches surrounded by a marvelous resort atmosphere, you should be getting flavor. I ordered the chicken panini with cole slaw as a side. The cole slaw barely tasted like cabbage. Cole slaw at Aria should be knockin' my socks off. How can you tout such an impressive display of public art and serve tasteless cabbage as cole slaw? I decided to finish my husband's salad instead, but I was confronted by the same quandary: no taste! It was a collection of wimpy little lettuce, including iceberg, drenched in oil(?), not even olive oil because my taste buds did not register a single adjective.

As for my panini, the bread was drenched in so much aioli that after about four bites, I couldn't continue to eat it. Too slimy! At that point, I realized I would be grumpy for the rest of the day if I actually tried to finish the dish and paid for it, so I decided to send it back. I ate half of my husband's sandwich, which was just ok.

The only bright spot was the friendly staff's willingness to accommodate my request to take back the offending sandwich and remove it from our bill. I know it may seem like a perfect poolside retreat, but resist the temptation for now and stick to the pool. Hopefully, in a month or two, they will rework some of the recipes and insert the missing flavor! I hope so because I really do like Aria.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,3,2,N9jlmmyCI7Df986v0vx4Cw
5333950,2010-09-19,0,PitHcnxTKCANz1VYwVtWkg,"I'm a sucker for modern design and I adore outdoor living. That being said, I LOVE the concept of Breeze Cafe but I think it could be better executed. The design and location of Breeze Cafe warrant 5 stars because it is *awesome* and it is next to a pool. The place is a wind tunnel so if you don't like wind you probably shouldn't eat here. Fortunately for me, I like wind--goes back to that whole outdoor living thing. I had to dock a star for a couple of reasons... They don't serve breakfast after 11a and that is a problem for people who go to bed in the wee hours of the morning. Also, the entrance was *impossible* to find. After walking around for 20 minutes, getting directions from people who clearly had no idea where it was or how to give directions, we finally found a helpful employee who directed us there [the Aria employees are so friendly].  My suggestion [and I'm glad you asked] for Breeze Cafe management is to put up a lot more signage!!! And serve breakfast all day.

The food...I had a chicken panini and my bf had something similar. They were awesome, and I personally thought BC was pretty inexpensive for the quality of the food.",d5u9ST4_PsOx7q31gm9FaQ,1,1,4,FLP0morFJsq_UYbERV2GSw
