I ordered 2 items and waited over an hour to not even receive our food . In between waiting for our food , atleast 3 separate orders that were ordered after mine were delivered , without a trace of my order in sight. He forgot our order .  I went outside of tenaya creek to check on my order and the man handed me two old chili cheese french fries loaded with jalapenos. ~That was not my order.   I proceeded to tell him that was not my order. I got a brief slam of the food truck window and the man said  "" ill bring your food to you when it's f***ing ready "".  

What a horrible food experience . Thankfully I got my refund and The man said "" that isn't going to make or break my night ."" Ok you won't have my business or any of my friends that frequently visit tenaya creek brewery anymore . Do not recommend .",l4ak4jPySyCEunGccRaQ1g,3,0,1,6odwAQNIFPWLWRv8jj4I-w

Professional and clean, the slander I see here is rubbish. God would send his/her mother to Chow Time to pick up a sandwich. Believe.",nMj_daRwFhe_0kE0mhmH2Q,0,0,5,ju7bPk6B3uTbiUsbWwydZQ

It's not your normal food truck the food is always freshly made and has the most amazing taste from the Chipotle burger to their pulled pork sandwiches everything is seasoned amazingly. The owner and his family really put everything they have into serving you the best BBQ. As long as you don't mind having a seat outside close the food truck where you can hear the cook at work and smell everything then you'll love this place,they cater as well and you can get your food to go. Check them out you won't regret it!!",ao0yrutF9q_IklN825sTZw,0,0,5,ILRiAg-Xyqx_p0fqjo9smg

I didnt have anywhere near the same experience as the previous reviwers who all posted the same review, my service was fine with only a six or seven minute wait",RYkZkG4grF-gSxdU1OIatQ,0,0,3,eDANGIDJR0Yksg0XH6YO4w

We also had the garlic parm fries and shared btw 4 people....so garlicky!I went to culinary  school so I'm picky but I approve of this place. I can totally tell that the cook is a hard working veteran and cares about what he does.,_UYVWxB1ZhadvGmweIHQAw,0,0,5,rl8tZpBwMKHeDg6aZ8uTFg

The man was so rude and unprofessional. Waited over an hour for our food, the food was cold, the frys tasted like fish (cooking oil had clearly not beem changed), and he ""forgot"" to bring out the other half of our group's order, he said it was ready and would bring it right in..25 minutes later, we go outside to see what's going on, and he yelled and cussed is out, slammed the window closed in our face (mid sentence). I did not wait this long, pay so much (including a tip that I wished I didn't give), to be treated the way we did. To sum it up, he only refunded half our money (stating that ""our f*cking money won't make his night), we never got the rest of our food, and ended up throwing away the food we did get. I don't know how much more unprofessional you can get. Terrible experience..buyers beware.",sxEjivCOzY3tVcvVWA0EvQ,1,0,1,Gtj8DR_5exK8STtXG4O8Ug

I walked out to see where my friends food was..since they had ordered before us and the guy cussed at me and told me that he would issue a refund then asked how I paid and then proceeded to tell me that I was a liar and slammed the window in my face and said that he would have my fucking food out shortly..so I kept calling for him and he was ignoring me..once I proceeded to walk back outside I demanded a refund he gave me my cash back and slammed the window in my face and said your 4.50 will not make my night!! This was thee worst customer service I've ever had at a food truck..this man is a disgrace to the hard working people!! I would never recommend anyone to this low life!!",HQHrpkToL0nqdIcBdLiy2Q,3,0,1,G1Q0IKkRYIT2yIGLTWLGFg
