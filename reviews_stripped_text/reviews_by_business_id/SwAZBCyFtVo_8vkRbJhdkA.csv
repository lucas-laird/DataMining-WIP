Next we split the kale and corn salad before splitting the fried chicken. The food was all yummy. Splitting the salad and entree was super smart. The portions are large. 
The waitress grabbed a seat with us to chat, checked in on us enough to be cared for and the perfect amount of leaving us to our  ourselves so we could talk. Loved it and will be back soon.",7lxEzQEcVTsuRebyA7hfhg,0,0,5,QzBgW94i6N-kJRlij5FrCw

We sat at the bar and had the best happy hour food we've had in a long time.

104625,2016-07-21,3,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"This review is based on their fried chicken meal.

I love fried chicken.  I just love it.  This place has many highly rated online reviews.  I rarely get to eat fried chicken, so when I do, I want to savor the best.  The dish cost $22, which although it's high in price for fried chicken, I understand being in the Hard Rock Hotel carries a premium on everything. The dinner comes with a fresh made buttermilk biscuit, mashed potatoes w/gravy, slaw and half of a chicken cut up and fried.

Let me remind you, I absolutely love fried chicken.  I came during lunch, mid week, with about 4 tables sat in the venue, so it was not busy.  My chicken was either cooked too long and burnt, or the grease was very old.  After years of experience with fried chicken, I'm going to say the oil was old.  The batter they use is very light in flavor and spices. The chicken breast had many small broken bones, which I'm assuming came from where the wing was attached.  You don't get the wing, by the way.  The portion size for the breast, thigh and leg were all very small.  Such a disappointing fried chicken experience. 

The buttermilk biscuit was doughy instead of flaky.  I was unable to enjoy it.  It had too much butter in the middle which made it even more dense.  The mashed potatoes had a very stale gravy flavoring.  Even the lemon in my drink was cut the previous day.  Nothing like getting a drink with a very old and dried lemon wedge to remind you that you're not enjoying fresh food.  When a restaurant cuts back by saving garnishes for the day, they are focused on the wrong thing....customer satisfaction and enjoyment.  A case of lemons in these hotels cost around $25 for approx 200 lemons.  A standard Sunkist 8 wedge fruit cutter will yield appros 1600 lemon slices per case, or $0.015 cents per wedge.  Even if you save just 50 slices a day, you've only saved 78 cents, and at the expense of pissing off 50 customers. 

The server and managers were both very courteous and friendly.",aVD5eHEVvuENLvQc4JfanQ,3,0,1,EjjZqqu6a9lY8PA-MWw_Mw

The atmosphere and decor is really cool, and we were lucky to sit down at a time when it wasn't busy.  We ordered off of the Happy Hour Menu, and had a lot of trouble deciding what to order since everything sounded so good.  We wanted to try a few different things to split, and started off with the Hand Cut French Fries, which were good and plentiful enough for us to share.  We also had the Smoked Salmon Bruchetta.  The bread it came with was super hard and I wasn't crazy about the salmon served with it, so I probably wouldn't order it again.  Finally, we shared the Meatloaf Sandwich, which was amazing, flavorful, and perfect for splitting.  Our waiter was extremely congenial and friendly, and even brought out a complimentary dessert, the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie.

Smallest steak i have ever seen and I cannot believe they completely destroyed the food! I was so disappointed that I sent it back and this was the first time that I have ever EVER done this in my life.

And if so, do we dare host a job interview meal here?  I don't know the origins of the restaurant name - but we did host our job interview meal here last night and had a wonderful dinner!  This is a must see, must eat Vegas restaurant!!  

There are oh, maybe, 500 restaurants ""to see"" in Las Vegas - this is one of them!  Culinary Dropout blew my mind.  It is beautiful!!   It is Classic Industrial at it's finest!  The furniture is contemporary classic - tufted sofas, wingback chairs, wooden industrial tables.  Simply stunning decor.  Beautifully decorated with a wall of windows overlooking the HRH pool, with a GINORMOUS patio outside that probably seats 100 people easy.  Hands down, best patio dining I have seen in Las Vegas!!   

I'm a terrible Yelper for not taking photos.  I was interviewing a job candidate - not showing off my YELP skillz.  You will have to go see the place for yourself! 

The food?  Oh yeah, the food!  They have an awesome starter menu of Antipasta where each table can individually create their own antipasta plate by filling out a menu card - similar to sushi places where you mark what you want.  We started with a few meats and cheeses - all of which we enjoyed.  They are served with some bread and mini breadsticks that resemble pretzels.  

The menu contains a little bit of everything.  Really, everything.  From meatloaf, to chicken curry, to fried chicken, to steak, to jambalaya, to a slew of salads and sandwiches.  There is something for everyone here.  

I decided to order the Bistro Steak - served with house fries and a gorgonzola sauce.  I don't consider myself a Steak connoisseur by any means - but this steak was awesome!!  Perfectly tender and juicy and charred - and served off the bone in a strip of mini segments of meat.  The fries are hand-cut and also very good.  My dining partners had the fried chicken and the salmon - both of which were devoured.  

For dessert we shared the Monkey Bread that other Yelpers recommended.  Served hot with a side of ice cream, it is PERFECT for sharing and was amazingly delicious!!  

Prices are actually reasonable - but if you want to enjoy the place you can expect about $50 per person with drinks for dinner.  Our party of 3 with many drinks, appetizer, entrees, and dessert ran us $177.  

The service was excellent - their beer selection is ""crafty"" and ""traditional"" and the restaurant ambiance is stellar.

For those who have never been, don't let the name fool you. Whatever culinary school you dropped out of was probably not advanced enough to keep up with your creativity. The Korean Ribeye Steak suggested by our server Jenny was flawless. Perfectly seasoned and brilliantly executed, it left you wanting nothing.

Fish and chips were probably some of the bat I've ever had. Extremely light batter, perfectly prepared as I've come to suspect is the norm here. Crazy good.

We ordered an antipasti plate with a meat, cheese, and the crusty bread and olive oil, which were fine, but what sucked was that they brought it out at the same time as our mains!  It's called an antipasti for goodness sakes, it's supposed to come out Before the main course.

Another issue was with the mains.  My friend had the Bistro Steak, and he ordered it medium rare, but we're both pretty sure that it came out rare, but it was so covered in sauce that it was hard to tell.  It was also cool when it came out, which was weird.  I had the pork belly cubano sandwich, which was tasty, but super oily.  I'm pretty sure they cooked the bread on the griddle with butter, because while the edges were crunchy, the center was still a little soggy and greasy.  I also wish they had used more of the spicy mustard and pickles, because after the pork belly, those two were my favorite parts of the sandwich.

719078,2012-10-08,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"so, we were here about a month ago and had probably one of the worst experiences at any restaurant. However, we came back and had a much better experience. 

First of all, we like to thank Mike for inviting us back so we can give this new place a second chance. Secondly, thank you to Alyssa and Erica for making our experience that much better than the first.

Alyssa really knew her food knowledge and was really great at checking up on us. Erica came back several times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and even the food runners knew where to drop off food, which was a challenge for them the last time we were here. Overall, we had a great time and are definitely making this place a go to spot.

Now, on to more important business, the food. Here's the break down:

1st course: Pretzel and cheese fondue and burrata. You can't go wrong with cheese and pretzels, especially when its fondue. Warm pretzel and cheese, definitely a plus. This app is also great for sharing if you're here with a big group. Burrata, OMG! We've had burrata served all sorts of way but it's definitely the best here. Served with toasty bread and chimichurri, what a combination. It's a little sweet and salty and the burrata adds this creamy and cool element, you have to try this when you're here. This is the perfect deconstruction of a caprese salad.

2nd course: Rainbow trout and the Ribeye cap. Rainbow trouts don't  get enough credits if you ask me. This mild white fish is perfect for grilling and pairing with some intense flavors. Here, it is served with some green beans and toasted almonds. The flavor of the fish gets a chance to be the star because the other elements are soft and enhances the flavor instead of overpowering it. But, the star of this course is the Ribeye cap. It was so tendered and all the flavors were wonderful. Asian inspired so you get a little spicy, a little sweet and a little salty. They're already sliced so consuming them was that much easier. If you're a cilantro (coriander), ask for extra. The flavor adds a little bitterness that goes really well with it.

3rd course: Monkey Bread. You all know that I love a good dessert. And this time, we didn't run out of time. It's baked to order so give it a little time to get to your table. It's piping hot when it arrives and you have to eat this with your hands. You pull apart these tiny brioche that is soaked in cinnamon and sugar. It was good. Its a good pull a part version of a cinnamon bun. It was a little too sweet for me so luckily I had some pretty strong coffee to sip on.

Ciao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)",hgGRHZsGPPoVD3JXBwEr6Q,3,5,4,JBW1wRtP986APRKAfEhCQQ

847610,2013-03-16,4,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"2013 Spring Restaurant Week Review:

While walking through Hard Rock I saw a sign stating ""Patio Open.""  So, I put on my leg brakes and walked straight on in.

The restaurant is huge and looks like Restoration Hardware threw up all over it.  The servers all look like they were bussed in from Williamsburg.  But, my only focus was the outdoor seating.

It's glorious, by the way. Comfy banquettes, outdoor bar, poolside, and firepits. Fire!

Oh, anyways, the food. 

I chose the carrot-ginger soup, fried chicken, and chocolate tart options from the RW menu.   My table also went for the pretzel and cheese fondue appetizer.  

The pretzel fondue was really great.  The pretzels were soft and chewy and the cheese was delicious, although a little clumpy.  I do wish they served the cheese a little hotter.  Overall, a great appetizer.

My first course, the carrot-ginger soup, was really flavorful.  I couldn't eat it all so I asked for a box.  Instead of boxing my leftovers, they gave me a whole new soup!  

The second course, the fried chicken, was pretty good.  There were three huge pieces and each was moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  Unfortunately, the chicken was bit too salty for me, but the batter definitely had a great flavor.   The dish also came with a tasty honey biscuit, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  I really enjoyed the coleslaw because it wasn't caked in dressing. 

My favorite part of the meal was probably the toffee chocolate tart.  I've been on a tart kick lately and this one was the best of the batch.  The chocolate was dark and rich but not too sweet.  A great way to end the meal.

Our server, Thanon (sp? Sorry!), was the nicest server I've had in a long time.  He went out of his way to make our meal amazing. He even offered to box up my leftover Sazerac! Who does that?!?! I would go back just for the service, it was that good.

The food, overall, is probably a 3 star experience, but the service and ambiance deserve extra stars.  I'll go back for sure!",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,7,6,4,LNtCHqOJVNWlYDC5wrQbTA

I had the Korean Style steak something, I forget the name of it because I was so  obsessed with how delicious it was!  Super tender, juicy, flavorful....yum!
My Dad had fried chicken, which we all agreed was the best fried chicken we had ever had, seriously the best I've ever had in my life.
For dessert we shared monkey bread, my parents said it was a little undercooked, which was their only critique of the night, but that's exactly how I like, so no complaints here.  We also had the caramel custard with caramel corn on top, which was fantastic.  The crunch of the popcorn on top with the creamy custard underneath was a great combination.

1055991,2014-01-13,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Made reservations for 6 pm on Saturday before checking out Zac Brown Band. So glad we had reservations as we were walking in, the hostess was telling a party of three, who did not have reservations, the place was completely booked for the night. Maybe it was due to ZBB performing there that night or maybe that's the usual for a Saturday night. I'm not sure. The hostess was super pleasant and our servers were pretty chill and laid back. Not too obtrusive which is just the way I like it.

The restaurant's decor is fabulous. English Pub meets Vintage Hollywood. Perfect for the Hard Rock. Hip and cool and definitely caters to a younger crowd (or the young at heart). We were seated by the window, which ended up being a quieter table (relatively speaking, of course. The place is loud and unapologetic about it. It is the Hard Rock, after all. Quiet and romantic this place is not.). 

The BF ordered the grilled cheese sliders with fries. I didn't care for either. The bread on the grilled cheese was way too thick, too hard, and dry. Not enough butter, in my opinion. I like my grilled cheese more on the greasy side. The cheese tasted slightly grainy. Maybe the provolone fondue set the bar too high for me that night. The bacon was sparse and a little overdone. The fries were okay. Nothing special about em. The dish looked good but I didn't think it tasted as good as it looked.

I ordered the highly recommended pretzels and provolone fondue based on yelp recommendations. Truth be told, that dish is why I wanted to go to Culinary Dropout. And a little more truth...before I give my opinion on the dish, I need to say I've been going low carb for a while so when I indulge, it needs to be good or I will be a big, terrible, cranky, mean monster. It's true. This was my night to cheat and I was going to do it BIG.

So, was it worth it? Oh. Yeah. 

Did I stuff myself silly?  Yes. Yes, I did. I did share one or two pieces but I wasn't happy about it. 

The pretzels nuggets looked perfect and smelled so good! Deep brown in color and perfectly textured. Crunchy exterior yielding to warm, chewy, and airy interior. Honestly, I could have skipped the fondue entirely. But, I didn't. This was my cheat night, after all! The cheese was excellent. It was a simple meal. But it was a good meal.

I think it is a little much to charge for bread when I am paying for both meat and cheese separately, but with a few accompaniments, we could have easily made this our meal.
I thought the fried chicken wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either.  It came with a large biscuit, but no butter and the cole slaw was incredibly bland.  The drumstick and thigh were both juicy, but the breast was quite tough.

In and out in just under an hour. Atmosphere is really slick. Feels like fine dining but without all the pretense that can get old after being in Vegas for a week. 

I would recommend sitting inside. If it's available, the tables that have the leather sofa on one side and a living-room-style padded arm chair on the other side are awesome. You can watch the guys on the line and the wait staff at the pass. Love that they're all in plain clothes and while being very professional, also, being very approachable. 

So for the food...
We started with the Warm Pretzel fondue appetizer. HIGHLY recommend. Especially if you're going to get a burger, because you can use the leftover cheese for your fries! I ordered the Pub Burger which had bacon, havarti & BBQ sauce. SO good. Bun was so fresh and had a great crust on it. Almost like a pretzel as well, but not too hard. Cooked to a PERFECT medium. Was very pleased. Fries weren't much to get excited about, but when using that Cheese fondue, they became amazing. 
My wife had the Beef Stroganoff. It was A+. Beef was so lean and mushrooms were delicious. I love that on the menu they straight-up say ""Frozen Peas"". HA! Again, NO pretense. 

For drinks, I had a Batch 19 Pre Prohibition style lager & my wife had a Smashed Irishman cocktail that she thoroughly enjoyed. I loved that their cocktail menu had silhouette pictures of the style of cup it would come in. They are also sorted into themed pages where each offering on the page is the same price. Very handy.

Didn't save room or time for desert, but the Peanut Butter Chocolate something or other will be on the menu when we make it back next vist to Las Vegas.",nlvaASGpxiBKpEZACGYw0A,6,6,5,JrmnZYS6R4pnRV-meBVcRQ

Fine enough, and well worth the happy hour price ($3). But the smoked salmon bruschetta ($6) was fantastic! Reminded me of the smoked fish dip at Ted Peters in St. Pete's, FL. We could have eaten that all day. It doesn't look like it's on the regular menu, so if you want this little slice of heaven, you'll have to hit happy hour. But why wouldn't you? The regular menu prices seemed a bit high ($22 fried chicken, anyone?), but these really felt like a steal.

We used to go to the Pink Taco for happy hour on a fairly regular basis, but I think I've found a new favorite. I hope to be dropping in on the Dropout soon!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,0,4,n9ftFIwD5s-0JtPHdKePlQ

Food prices are more than fair, especially for Vegas. Bacon Bloody Mary was good but way too expensive for the size. ($13 for a glass half the size of a normal bloody mary). 

As far as the food goes, it was good but everything had a twist of unusualness to it. The biscuits and gravy are not made the traditional way you'd expect. They were good but very different from any I've ever had. The Cap't Crunch French Toast & monkey bread were great!!

On the drink menu they had bourbon & vodka mules, like a the 'Classic Dropout Mule' is a Moscow Mule, etc.  I asked if they could make my favorite mule a Dark 'N Stormy, basically like a Moscow Mule, but with rum.  Well, it tasted like a sour margarita and rumless.  My friend got a margarita that tasted like the sour mix mostly.  Instead, I was happy that they had Veuve Clicquot by the glass. And even that was flat.  I didn't complain.  

We didn't try the most talked about Pretzel Fondue, but I love Pretzel bread!  I always order a 'dijonaise' over cheese when I eat pretzel bread.  I ordered the Turkey Pastrami on pretzel bread with cole slaw and Swiss.  My friend Jeff C. ordered the Grilled Chicken Club.

Overall, not impressive.  I did like the chewy pretzel bread, but it wasn't the best.  We split sandwiches and I'd have to say his Club was better.

I was pretty hungover and on my own, and I ordered the pulled pork nachos. They were AWESOME! Perfect hangover food. Really great, trendy ""fresh mex"" nachos. I had a mediocre coffee too.

roasted tomato appetizer: DELICIOUS! I could eat this all day
olives: the big green ones were good but the small ones were bitter. and of course you get more of the small ones
fried chicken dinner: this was pretty good. The chicken was extremely moist, mashed potatoes were yummy and coleslaw was well made. Biscuits were to die for. 
beef stroganoff: this was alright. the flavors were good but I thought the pasta would be thicker and chewier (more al dente). They claim it's hand made so I had high expectations. It was thin and blah. 
pretzel and fondue dip: LOOKS good in pictures, but it wasn't very exciting at all. The pretzels did not taste fresh and the cheese dip isn't any better than the liquid cheese you get elsewhere.

A drop-down garage door opens up to the outdoor patio and the iconic Hard Rock pool. There's also a 12-seat raw bar and a full antipasti bar if you're feeling the urge. 

I went with the wildly popular soft pretzels with provolone fondue.  So delicious! The soft pretzels come with sea salt and are so warm and pillowy. The fondue sauce was wonderful with a nice sharp bite and a creamy irresistible texture. Nothing like dunkin' fresh-baked pretzel bites into a pot of creamy fondue. Real crowd pleaser! 

Reconnect with your inner child and go with the Cap'n Crunch French Toast. Dusted with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries and drizzled with a lovely custard sauce. The flavors meld together so well. This French toast has it all! 

The menu offers up such a variety with fried chicken, king crab legs, salmon, oysters, grilled cheese sliders, jambalaya, 36-hour pork ribs, pork belly cubano, cheese plates, Korean rib eye cab and monkey bread...just to name a few.

The oysters were beyond fresh, I mean it was like someone just dove into the ocean shucked them and brought them to us. Not to big but perfect to enjoy. The crab legs were obese with meat and equally fresh and good. The shrimp were so big that one was equivalent to other restaurants cocktail. Again equally fresh and so yummy. Next not the table was fresh French fries. I know what your thinking, Felicia, you already mentioned you had fries. Well guess what we ordered more!! Pigs, we were pigs!! Lastly, the monkey bread and vanilla bean ice cream. Words cannot do justice to this gooey, cinnamony, pillowy soft pull apart desert demon!! The ice cream was just icing. We didn't even get to any of the main courses so I will definitely be back but it will be so very hard not to order the exact same things. Service was awesome but to be honest the server could have slapped me and I would not have noticed with all of the goods!! You make me proud Culinary Dropout.

I got my food to go, was sent to the bar to order it, and was greeted and had my order taken immediately.

When my food was delivered to the bar, it sat right behind the beer taps for at least 5 to 10 minutes, while the bartenders were serving using those taps, until someone finally got it for me and I wasn't even offered a to-go cup for my iced tea.

They have a raw bar which I loved $3 oysters and $3 white shrimps ($3 each)
We also order the fried chicken, it comes with mash potatoes, cole slaw, and a biscuit. The fried chicken smelled good, however after cutting into it we noticed it was pink and still bleeding. We did inform the manager, however we were told that is normal. I'm pretty sure you can get sick from eating raw/under cooked chicken. 

Our server Billy was ok, sometimes you catch people on a bad day. The manager had good energy and was extremely nice.

Being the maid of honor, I had planned that Vegas weekend to be chill, wild and relaxing all at the same time. 

It was our first night in Vegas (Friday night) and since most of us drove out there from LA, I wanted the girls to have a relaxing night with dinner, drinks and the room right upstairs just in case someone wanted to call it quits early. Therefore, I decided to make reservations at Culinary Dropout. After reading a couple of reviews and checking out their pictures, I liked that it looked like a ""chill"" spot with live music, good drinks and great food.

To begin, the decor was very intimate and yet somewhat hipster-ish yet industrial at the same time. The live band was great. They even played Backstreet Boys!! Took me back to when I was a teen. Haha. Anyhow, the staff was great and our waiter was awesome! He was super attentive and beyond helpful. He definitely made sure we had drinks in our hands. 

For dinner, I decided to go with the steak and potatoes... OMG! This dish is one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had. The meat was beyond juicy and extremely tender. The potatoes were saute perfectly. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

As a dessert, the waiter gave the bride to be a free Salted caramel custard topped with caramel popcorn. I had a little taste since I'm not big on dessert... deliciousness. It's enough for like 3-4 people since it's extremely sweet.

I would definitely go back to this place. 2 thumbs up!",hHWW3z00_pKeLU0uqD_Y3g,5,4,5,dUiHJKN38QpxgY1zdSz_aw

I actually enjoyed the pretzel cheese fondue but the burrata, that was amazeballs. It's a semi soft slightly sweet cheese with chimichurri and marinated tomatoes. It's like a Spanish version of a bruschetta. Definitely try it. 

The fried chicken is phenom... Hang on to the cheese from the pretzel fondue, it's good for dippin!  I had the pork belly sandwich and it was thick cut, juicy, and tender.

-Artichoke
-Pretzel bread and cheese fondue
-Gorgonzola chicken salad

Entrees:
-Salmon with apples
-Rainbow trout
-36 hour ribs

Crispy Prosciutto Deviled Eggs: Yummy but too salty (due to the prosciutto)

Oysters: I love that you can order by the oyster ($3 each)

House Potato Chips: Very crispy, served with house made onion dip

Gorgonzola Chicken Salad: We chose to have ours served on a pretzel roll instead of a salad and it was delicious! Crispy apples and celery cut through the gorgonzola. 

Meats and Cheeses: We tried a variety and they were very tasty, served with crispy bread.

Well they weren't!  Had the pretzel fondue and yesterday soup for starters and both were great! Soup was very flavorful and came with a slice of toasted seasoned garlic bread. Only critique here might be a little less seasonings on the bread so you can use it to balance the taste of the very flavorful soup to your preference. The fondue was nice and saucy after having a chance to heat up. To make it easier for hungry diners to dig right in, perhaps it could have been melted to saucy consistency right before serving. It was only Luke warm when it got to the table, but warmed up nicely after a few minutes. After that, consistency and taste of cheese and pretzels were great!

Fried chicken was the main course and it did not disappoint! Cooked perfectly juicy tasty and tender, you get half a chicken, two sides and a biscuit so be hungry! Or share. 

Monkey bread for dessert. Fresh from the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Like a different kind of apple pie a la mode.  If you have room left to enjoy this is the dessert to get! Or jut come in for dessert after a night of party or gaming.",WiqH_WpEob_16I5xRVdbgw,2,2,4,hf1sorcW_LtsmqO3xrOOlA

According to their website, Culinary Dropout is a gastropub created by Fox Restaurant Concepts.  The first time I encountered a Fox restaurant was in Tucson, AZ with Wildflower and it was amazing.  Food was fresh.  Flavors were well-rounded and the decor and staff were very attractive.  =)  Our experience with Culinary Dropout Las Vegas proved to be product of the brains behind Fox.  Though a different type of restaurant all together, all the details similar to my experience at Wildflower came together.  The service was impeccable (waters filled constantly, all staff checking on you, very smartly dressed in hobo chic for girls and vests for guys).  The food was fatty, delicious and well thought out.  The decor was romantic, whimsical and relaxing, so much so that I felt like I was in an episode of The Hills reality show.  Definitely a date night place or nice cozy hang out with your friends.

Foood.
1.  Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue - Usually not a fan of pretzels, but theses lil' guys were fluffy and perfectly salted and hard to resist once dipped in the warm pot of cheese.
2.  Grilled Cheese Sliders with bacon and tomato - Baby sliders!  Just as tasty as they were cute.
3.  Jambalaya - Well rounded, robust and perfectly sauce.  Best jambalaya yet? oooo
4.  Fried Chicken with honey biscuits, potatoes and gravy - Nothing can beat fried chicken at Ad Hoc in Napa, but this chicken platter had it's own character.  The breading was delicate, light and uniquely seasoned (cumin, my friend Tina says?).  The honey biscuits were slightly sweet and fluffy; I totally commandeered the rest of said friend's biscuits.
5.  The Pub Burger with havarti, bacon and house bbq sauce - Big burger = Big flavor.  Nice moist burger patty with sweet smokey bbq sauce.
6.  Monkey Bread - Ooey gooey, warm and comforting

Conclusion:  I'm coming back to hang out when I want feel trendy and eat well.

1698071,2016-05-30,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"OK where do I begin. 

During an three day weekend to Las Vegas, I had opportunity to visit  Culinary Dropout three times. 

 When we initially walk inside the location, we were greeted by an young lady, whom was very friendly and cooler than a fan.  She then provided us on options of where would we like to be seated, the bar, a table or sitting down at a table outside facing this awesome jungle style pool. I decided NOT to get my George of the jungle ON and we said by the bar. Being the cool person I am me and the lady posted up by the tvs like we had the remote control . Lol

The menu is pretty basic but offered the right options we needed to satisfy the beast. I order the Fried shrimp Caesar salad, and the breakfast burrito since it was only 11:30 AM. Boy did they both live up to my expectations! The breakfast Bburrito display much flavor and is a good size. You literally can split this with a partner or friend. The breakfast Brito also came with some crispy delicious potatoes. On the side came this delicious salsa to get my toes twinkling. The salad was very fresh and the fried shrimp was very crispy.

I also tried a new IPA call Big Dog that was referred by the cool bartender with the awesome tattoos. Word-of-mouth is that Dig Dog IPA is on the rise. 

Our food came out extremely fast and the service promptly took care of us. Thank you for a good experience.

I get the dark ambiance of the Hard Rock and every business within it, but I should at least be able to see my menu without having to whip out my phone for a light source. That being said, nothing on the menu stands out.

They're really pushing the pretzel fondue, but the table next to us got it and it didn't look appealing. Prosciutto deviled eggs sounded awesome but were in reality a let down- I guess for $4/order, that shouldn't surprise me, but the ""prosciutto"" was more like bacon bits than any other meat I've had. 

Italian antipasto salad makes a decent and filling lunch, with ample protein and a tasty dressing. But the ""yesterday's soup"", chicken tortilla, is basic- I mean, at least add some sort of garnish for $7/bowl. Chicken was a bit spicier than expected but overall the dish fell flat.

The only thing saving this review was friendly service. But I can't eat service... Menu has no direction and the food received did not interest me enough to warrant ordering an entrée or returning.

Well, I ended up being the only one at Culinary Dropout's bar anyway.

Wild berry beer ($7) seemed to be a good choice after a quick Yelp skim- the cute bartender said it was a very smart choice: tastes just like juice but contains 8% alcohol and you don't get all the beer bloat. Yum.

It seemed like the consensus was brunch, which surprised the bartender because he said they didn't usually get many people in for breakfast/brunch. No problem, I wasn't planning on breakfast, anyway. I love my carbs, so pretzel bites and cheese fondue it was.

Not sure the Chimayo [beer] was worth the $12, but you can't put a price on experience.

Halfway through, I really had to go to the bathroom (downside of having a small bladder). There's no restroom inside the restaurant. Cool thing is, they let me walk out without having opened a tab with a credit card or paying.

I came back only to watch some middle-aged guy across from me inhale a hamburger and a Sicilian man next to me down two cups of coffee. By the way, did I mention he works with Manny Pacquiao?

Cute bartender is also a responsible one. After he made me two more drinks, he wanted to make sure I didn't go ""stumbling out"". Thanks, but unfortunately, nothing gets in the way of this girl shopping on the strip. The bill was ridiculously cheap, which I had to make up with a gracious tip.

Fun atmosphere, with great natural light as both the bar and restaurant open up to the patio to overlook the pool at the Hard Rock.   Food seems to be right on par from the Scottsdale store - pretzel bread fondue, fried chicken and pork belly cubano, taste just like I remember - great flavor, good portions and good value.  Beer menu and cocktail menu is top ten on the strip (if you want to put Hard Rock on the ""Strip"").  I sat at the bar to watch some Sunday Football, our bartender was very friendly and it was good to see she had her bartending skills honed - technique looked sound and she makes a good crafted cocktail.  Thank god she served us, as another bartender came in later and she seemed to be to wrapped around her nails, her looks and some other bartender rather than serving any of the guests.

They have happy hour m-f 3-6 and while yes, the signature pretzel rolls are amazing, they give you a lot...why is this a problem...because the rest of the food is just that good too.

My husband always insists on having the meatloaf sandwich, so we forgo the pretzels most of the time now.  I always have to get the antipasta plate.  Usually pretty consistently the same, but they switch the cheeses out or the nuts out for a different flavor.  This is my favorite meal anyway, so very happy to get it for such a great deal.

And you'd think that since we go in for the cheap happy hour deals that the staff would be snooty...never once.

Oh and I forgot the fries...so good.  Actually much of their menu looks worth trying, but this stuff is so good that we don't want to try anything else.

So I am sharing my secret because they are usually a little slow...yes, we are there at their slow time, so I hope that they get enough party business to stay open....they are really good and really the menu prices are pretty decent for the location.  

So now that I wrote a review about your awesome happy hour, please do not change it :)

Update....this is still my favorite happy hour, but we did try the fried chicken, however I am a connoisseur of fried chicken and it didn't change my world....however I wanted to tell the manager to please be sure to take off the horrible instant mashed potatoes...if they don't want to make them, serving fries is perfectly acceptable w fried chicken.

There was a group of 9 men at a hi-top that was being waited on by our server.  We were also a 9 top.  Our initial greeting by our server was great, but after that it all went rolling down hill.  

Service was horrible.  Drinks took forever.  Thank goodness we ordered the pretzel fondue and chips to start.  Food was ok.  Nothing to die or fondle over.  Our server took over 30 min to take our dinner order and we made it easy for her, as we ordered everything to share.  

The worst part was the entrees- it took over 45 min to get our entrees and when it came, It was stone cold.  Our ribeye was seriously COLD!  Obviously they tried to put up all 9 entrees at once,but could not keep everything hot.  Very, Very Poor!  1/2 of the entrees were COLD and the other 1/2 was Luke Warm.  

At this point we were truly disappointed, but we are not complainers.   Our belief is, we just won't come back.  We still wanted to believe in this place and ordered dessert to see if this place would redeem itself.  Unfortunately, it got a little better with dessert but not service.  

The Monkey Bread was a 7 on a scale of 1-10 and the Salted Carmel Pudding was an 8.  That was the hi light of the meal, sad to say.

Three of us left without ever receiving our meals.  Or an explanation.  There was no manager on duty, and just a couple potentially intoxicated servers and busboys left to look dumbfounded as we asked for water.

The chairs and  tables have almost a rustic / disheveled look to them. each table has their own set of seat backs and seats that don't match the others. There are large glass chandeliers hanging above the larger tables, and I counted 3 small fire pits on the patio. There is also a full service bar to the right of the dining room.

I was offered a seat at the bar, but requested a table in the dining area. After being seated a waitress by the name of Rae (I hope I remember correctly) approached, greeted, and sat down at the table to discuss the menu (since it was my first visit.)

This is the type of hospitality and customer service that I really look for in a restaurant. After explaining what she liked and helping me through some of the things I fancied, we both decided that she would just bring some food and I would eat. When the food arrived it was just simple food on a plate. no pretentious arrangements, no rediculous garnish, that's not intended to be eaten, just good food prepared well.

Her attentiveness is really what made the experience for me. Super down to earth/chill people, showing that you actually care for guests is what sets this place apart.

We weren't even acknowledged by our waiter for 15 minutes.  When our spiky blonde H&M wearing waiter decided to give us the time of day we advised him we were ready to order or drinks & apps & our entree seeing as we were already sitting there for 15 minutes (no care in the world from him)

I had called around 530 to make a reservation because I had heard so many good things about your restaurant and read that you had great unique dishes! So I called and had my friend from out of town make a reservation for a party of 2 at 10 pm. I hadn't seen my friend in a while so I was really enthused to show him this amazing location inside of the Hard Rock. When we got there we were seated by someone that wasn't a host. I didn't get his name but I do remember that he walked us to our table. Before we were sat we made small talk with this gentleman and asked him if it was busy, he said that it was a slow day and then grabbed menus and walked further inside the restaurant. Halfway into the restaurant he asked us if we had preferred to sit outside and seemed very indecisive on where he was going to seat us even though there was plenty of tables with servers in their section to accommodate a measly party of 2. So he instead walked us outside where there were no tables and sat us near a fire pit. Since the outside tables weren't set up he moved a table and two chairs over from a different sections and sat us down. About 5 minutes later a server by the name of candy walked out and introduced herself. I had never been to this location so was interested in the menu, the ingredients and the favorite and best selling dishes. She said ""everything on this menu is surprisingly good"" that didn't sell me on anything so I told her that we would start off with two beers first and we would look over the appetizers. She smiled and walked into the restaurants. My friend and I started catching up and talking and within that time we noticed that she started going to other tables and putting dishes away and closing out people's tabs and completely ditching our table! Twenty minutes had gone by and I didn't get a drink and she didn't come back outside to check on our table. I was infuriated so I walked inside and looked everywhere for a manager! Everywhere I went and everyone I asked didn't seem to know where he was! So I patiently waited by the bar when suddenly candy made her way to me and said I am finally here do you want to be sat at the bar now? What can I get you? I was so mad that she hadn't even apologized or taken the amount of wasted time in to consideration. She had simply dismissed the idea that she had neglected our table and was polishing and putting things away because she wanted to close. Another 5 minutes later the general manager approached the bar and didn't introduce himself and all he said was I'm sorry that she dropped the ball I'll buy you guys drinks. His name was Danny I believe and he also didn't try to asses the situation or make it any better. 5 minutes later he had asked the bartender to give us a round of beers on the house and upon giving me my beer the server spilled the beer all over me and my belongings. So, not only did I waste my time by going to a place I thought was legit and amazing but I was sat outside at a dirty table neglected by a uninterested server and then I got a beer spilled all over me. The manager was the worst experience for me because he did ABSOLUTELY nothing to try to make the situation better. When he was talking to us he was distracted and uninterested in making things right. I am disappointed in the level of service and professionalism that this place offered and I will be telling everyone not to go there! Your company has been known to provide good services, and such events tarnish the company name, so please address this issue soon.",QNYWkECXA9X4xK97fjz93w,1,0,1,06eP33zBZ-QxC-2uvn8-1g

We came to Culinary Dropout after a super long day driving to and from the Grand Canyon and we wanted food that was convenient. It's literally an elevator ride away from our room on the upper floor of the Hardrock Hotel. 

Loved the super spacious layout of the interior. Great for groups and it opens out into a patio area near the pool. Great for the lovely summer weather. We came on a Thursdays night around 10pm (they close at 11pm) and the restaurant was fairly empty. Service was attentive and they happily made recommendations. We ordered:

*Pretzels and provolone fondue: Good! I was a little hesitant at first but the whole combination was delicious. Also, the pretzels weren't overly salted but buttery, which was great. Fondue was a great consistency too. 
*Pork belly toast: Good but the open face baguette the pork belly was on was a little soggy. The flavors were fresh and reminded me of a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich. The pork belly was flavored so well, and was cooked so that it was crisp. 
*27 hour pork ribs: Lackluster, except for the fries. The pork ribs were cooked decently, but the molasses sauce was a little too tangy. The coleslaw was really bad. It didn't taste like anything at all. I rather have a side salad raw. The cool thing was that they split it for us because they knew we were sharing. 
*Bourbon black bottom pie: Great! Chocolate ganache and graham cracker crust. Soooo good. The bourbon flavor was actually pretty strong. We got it for free was a birthday treat. Yay! 

SIDE NOTE: Culinary Dropout allows their servers to wear anything that they want, this include jewelry and facial piercings. While our server was talking to us, his lip ring fell onto the floor and we never found it. While it wasn't a big deal to us (although I found it hilarious), I'd imagine a worse situation in which it could have fell into a drink or food.

1969283,2015-04-09,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"""Dropout's"" recent beer-pairing event (March) was a great surprise from start to finish.

The ambiance of the large outdoor dining area was, as expected, a pleasant visual treat aided by a setting sun and surrounding mood lighting.

Two tables had been set aside for this pairing event and shortly after the scheduled time the Culinary Dropout (cool name) crew got on with the good stuff - a five part/course pairing of food and brew.

Tony (AGM) and Ben proceeded to describe each upcoming brew and dish with fine detail.

So what's behind my 5-star rating?

Several off-property chefs participated in the tasting. Two of them did not favor one of the brews offered but respected all dishes in the pairing.

Although not a proclaimed ""foodie"" myself, it is noteworthy to report that each pairing was appreciated by all served. One woman and a visiting chef (noted above) found the Apricot Hefeweizen not to their liking while my opinion was that of great balanced and a welcome pairing choice.

Not a favorite, but the Starter (Antipasti paired with the Apricot Hefe) was a good effort and primer for the main dishes. 

Poussin paired with Scottish Ale (2nd course) did the trick and was followed up by Double Bock Braised Short Ribs paired with a Devastator Double Bock - wonderful!

The S'Mores Tart was stellar. Eager to dig in I snapped a picture after already enjoying two bites. The Outer Darkness Imperial Stout made for a wise pairing for this tart.

Despite almost all pairing seats being occupied, service was top-notch. Timing between pairings was relaxed and each dish/brew was served as if you were a VIP.

The place was very clean and had a cool outdoor area.

I ordered the fried chicken - now, I have to say, I am a Kentucky girl.  I know my fried chicken.  I haven't had awesome fried chicken since I moved out of Kentucky almost a year ago.  Culinary Dropout has ahhhhhmazing fried chicken.  The prices are a bit high, but the food is delicious.  My meal came with three pieces of chicken (a leg, breast & thigh), coleslaw, mashed potatoes & a honey biscuit - for $22.  

The restaurant, itself is beautifully decorated.  There is an open patio section with cool fire pit tables.  (My description is terrible - go see for yourself!).  I'm a professional photographer & would looove to shoot inside this place.  It's so cool.  The staff was very nice and our waitress held herself together well when some douche grabbed her butt while she was taking his order.  For me, the music was a bit loud.  We could barely hear our friends talking, so it's not great for conversation.  & the only other downside is that it's in the Hard Rock, which is quite possibly the douchiest place in Las Vegas.  We dodged about 10 Bachelor parties and a gaggle of obnoxious drunk girls (at 5:30 in the afternoon - I know this is Vegas, but geez...at least wait until after dark to be so drunk you can't walk.) just getting to the actual restaurant.

Funniest item was a honey almond micro brew from WI which came in a can so large that it was impossible to finish-good thing for beer I guess! Prices were firm for the portion sizes which were not generous-and the Seared Tuna Salad which I ordered was reasonably tasty-but the presentation was lackluster at best=looking like a bowl of lettuce with a few shreds of this or that thrown in and a few chopped up pieces of grey looking tuna which were certainly hard to distinguish from a lettuce leaf-hardly the normal presentation of fresh slices of seared rare tuna one would expect as the featured item in your bowl. Service was mediocre=no refills on ice tea and long lapses with barely a suggestion of dessert on a not full Monday night. Seems like an adequate option if you want drinks and bar food in an interesting vibe-but don't come hungry and expect to fill up unless you order plenty and if eating healthy is the idea-would pass also. Most of the rave food options are fried and heavy on fat loaded dips-maybe the right idea to ward off a hang over..",C3-__jJNxwbR5Rvr-CaW1g,1,0,2,yPUKnA4j0qSpmH0Y9SDnHA

The fried chicken was worth every calorie. The salad made me forget i was eating a salad. The pretzel bites were great, but the order is HUGE. Plenty to share between 5 or 6 people. (I overate)
The second time, I went alone for breakfast, & got treated so well, I almost felt like one of the employees. Their coffee is wonderful, & the classic egg breakfast was just perfect.

2079560,2018-02-14,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,Recently dined while attending a show at the Hard Rock Resort on a Sat night. The restaurant had a nice energy and vibe and what was really cool is there is an outdoor area that's near the pool. Being that it was Feb - the weather was slightly cool but they had heat lamps to make it comfortable. The outdoor area is quite expansive and features 'cornhole' games and it was a nice respite from the noise inside. Ordered the pretzel bites with fondue to start the evening. As other reviewers have mentioned this can maybe be shared by 4 people. Nice warm almost small cup cake sized sea salt pretzel 'bites' and a small cauldron of provolone cheese fondue that was heated by a small tea light candle - YUM! My guest had the Turkey Pastrami sandwich with a side salad and I had the fish & chips. The sandwich was good portion sized and the fish was not overly breaded and nice and crisp with sides of ketchup and tartar sauce. The fries were average but served nice and hot. Everything was served promptly - there some nice cocktail options as well. The table next to us had the Italian 'grinder' sandwich and the shaved Prime Rib Dip sandwich with au jus. They said they were really good. The food and atmosphere is reminiscent of what I would say more of a pub type feel. A fun place to gather with friends for before or after a show or to watch a sporting game on the many tvs throughout both inside and outside.

I took the advice of my fellow yelpers and immediately ordered the puffy pretzel bites with cheese fondue. Oh my gosh just order them. You get a basket of 12 warm pretzels. They are not hard and accompanied by cheese fondue.  Perfect for sharing. 

We then shared a turkey burger which was also excellent. What I liked most about the place was that it was nice but not too pretentious. After all, it is VEGAS. We weren't ordering a lot of food and we didn't get any attitude. There were some dressed up people but others were casual.  They have a pretty big beer and whiskey list.

You can't go wrong with the happy hour snacks. My top two recommendations are the kale salad and pretzels with fondue. The salad is the perfect size to pair with an appetizer and includes unique toppings like beets, cauliflower and goat cheese. The pretzel fondue is really something special! It's a blend of provolone and havarti and is served with soft pretzel rolls. I have begged for the recipe and even tried recreating it myself, but haven't figured it out yet.

2177475,2015-03-19,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"A few friends came in town last night who were staying at the Hard Rock so I immediately said, let's try Culinary Dropout. I had heard so many things about this place that I thought it would be great. Maybe I had too many expectations but then again, it is the Strip so I should have high expectations. 

I got there a little bit before my friends and thought I would stop by the bar and grab a drink. I asked for a Menu and was only given the dinner menu. It was 5:30 and I had thought there was a Happy Hour but of course, that wasn't mentioned AT ALL since we all know the only important thing is to rip off tourists. Nice job there bartender chic. Now that I'm sitting at home, I check your website and find out that yeah, you kinda ripped me off. Nice. To add insult to injury the drink I did order wasn't what was on the menu. Yes she said that they were out of one of the ingredients, but I really question WHY? This is Las Vegas. THIS IS THE STRIP. You shouldn't be ""out"" of anything. 

My friends get there and we are seated outside, which was kinda nice. It was a pretty night in Las Vegas so it was nice to enjoy the weather and chat. Someone comes over and drops off what looks a lot like a sushi menu, but it was for their antipasti and appetizers. No one really said anything about it, because you know, it's normal to get a sheet of paper and a pencil to order your food??? My friend order some asparagus, which btw, never came. Let me point out that we ordered that and drinks then waited a little bit to order food, so how asparagus can't make it to the table is a bit confusing to me. 

I must remark on the server. Seriously hipster dude comes over and does the lame, ""Have you been here before."" Servers need to stop that. Especially at Strip restaurants since well, IT'S A TOURIST SPOT. Unless you are going to conduct a game show to enable food ordering, I'm pretty sure I don't need this lame spiel about your restaurant and menu. I can read English and have never had a major mishap ordering dinner before. I know. Amazing as that sounds. I also don't need this dude to tell me how they were rated a top new restaurant by US Weekly or some such nonsense. If the food and restaurant are great then I'll know that when I leave. Let it stand on its own merits not some pseudo hype that you want to use to ""impress"" us silly tourists. 

We ordered our food and enjoyed conversation. It took a little longer than I would expected for fried food and a salad in a not-at-all full restaurant. My salad was good but it wasn't anything that jumped out in my mind. My girlfriend got the fried chicken. She said it was ok. Seeing that we're from Mississippi, we kinda know our fried chicken. She also commented on how it was WAY too sweet as well as the cornbread was WAY too sweet. Not shocking. This place is like all these other ""trendy"" restaurant popping up that have ""Southern"" food on their menu that they charge way too much for. They have no one in the back who can find the South on a map, let alone know how to cook food properly. They've just watched one too many episodes of Paula Dean and now think they now. Meh

We got our bill and handed the server my debit card and told him that I had the ONE drink and ONE salad. The rest was to be taken from the Hundred that my friends handed him. SEVERAL SEVERAL SEVERAL minutes later he comes back and asks them if they needed change. WHAT?!?! Just run my card and bring it as well as their change back and let them look it over. My friend replies, ""Well I don't even know how much it was since you needed to run her card."" He IMMEDIATELY tells (not bring a check or anything) her the total and then just kinda stands there. It was a weird, and unnecessary, few moments. My friend replies, ""No just keep the change but bring her her credit card."" He quickly runs over and runs my card and brings my receipt.

That is a tacky and pushy way to get your tip dude. Seriously. I can't believe that a server would ever do that to someone. I've worked in plenty of restaurants and a few here in Las Vegas and the only time I would say anything to that affect is if I had just that second picked up the check, not when  I've walked away and made calculations that amount to me assuming I deserve what's left over. It was a HUGE turn off on top of many turn offs. 

All in all I was very under impressed after all the hype I'd heard. I see absolutely no reason to ever go back there again. I definitely won't be recommending it and I have friends come in town ALL THE TIME. I'd give it one star but the atmosphere was kinda nice and I liked the patio. Though neither of those were great enough to get to go have mediocre food and get ripped off on drinks. I hope everyone else has a better experience than I do. For me I can think of dozens of restaurants in Las Vegas I'd rather go to. Heck, I would have been MUCH happier at Firefly down the road.

We were seated at the indoor/outdoor section,  great view of the pool area and quiet enough still to enjoy my amazing company.

Started out with the bacon vodka bloody mary! Omg, mouth watering to say the least. It wasnt strong and it didnt inhabit that overly strong vodka taste. It was just right! 5 stars!!

I then had the lobster benedict. Large peices of lobster, served over a poached egg and sauce to top off its amazingness!!

Our server was great. She was super helpful, and helped us decide on cocktails, which were awesome. My husband had the Bells n Whistles, a spicy whiskey cocktail (don't order if you don't like spicy!) and I ordered a sparkling strawberry gin martini (can't remember the name but it was delicious!) We ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and the burrata (yeah, we like cheese, what about it?). The pretzel bites were...ok. A little less than warm for my liking. The cheese sauce (more sauce than fondue) was yummy. The burrata was OMG. I would definitely get it again. It was served with compressed pears, bacon syrup, walnuts, and greens, and the flavors and textures were all perfect together. 
Like I said, by this point we were already full so we called it a night, but we definitely plan on coming back again and again until we have tried all the yummy things on the menu!",UNYMBvC8lAToU_wkvwNUwg,2,0,4,6Io9JmNw3avVYBK9TU3ZEw

I ordered the Bistro steak medium but it came out well done and my steak was luke warm along with my fries. The food also took FOREVER to come out.

First, they wanted to sit us at some chairs outside that didn't have a table where ""most guests just put their plates on their lap"" I'm sorry but I'm not paying money to have a glorified picnic. 

When we did get a table our waiter took foreverrrrr and he was not accommodating to vegetarians AT ALL. Usually restaurants have several options (not just one salad) seeing as people have dietary restrictions. I would have been happy with regular pasta with marina sauce but no.

The very pretty blond server, complete with cutoff shorts, recommended the pretzel and cheese appetizer and fried chicken. Both being Foodies, we inhaled the appetizer. This is their signature dish and it doesn't disappoint. Tom got the fried chicken and I the Italian sandwich. Both were tasty and well prepared. I have the feeling from other Yelpers, that the menu is a can't miss on all dishes.
       The interior of the DC is modern. They have a square bar, a stage for bands, and an outdoor area with heat lamps. I recommend the bar if you are getting just an app and drinks.

The hostess was great and seated us near the bar. We noticed it was incredibly hot in there and asked the staff if the air conditioning was on. Then I noticed the large sliding door behind the bar was open. Why would you have it open in June with it 95+ degrees outside. We were about to leave, but decided it would be worth it to stay.

Our server was the next bad part. He came right away with water but when we told him we were ready to order he told me he is only taking drink orders right now. We settled with just water. He came back 20 minutes later to finally take our food order. Again, we stayed because we knew it had to be worth it.

I ordered the fried chicken of course and my buddy ordered the stroganoff. Luckily it didn't take too long for the food to arrive though it wasn't fast either. I was starving by the time it arrived. I took a bite into the chicken and didn't really expect the honey glaze. It was alright, but just a little surprise. The chicken was cooked amazingly. The breast was very juicy and not dry at all. It did need some more seasoning though. It came with gravy so i guess you're supposed to dip it into it. The gravy was pretty bad. It tasted like it came in a paper pouch that you buy for $.50 at the grocery store.

The side dishes were not good. The cole slaw was soggy and lacked any flavor. Even with a ton of salt & pepper it didn't taste very good. The mashed potatoes tasted bland. What restaurant just serves mash potatoes with no seasonings or spices in it? Again, the gravy was bad. The biscuit though was really good. The honey crust on top was flavorful.

I wouldn't come back here. Everything on the menu was overly priced and sorry but the chicken was over hyped. Sure it was fried very nicely, but lacked spices.",eipO40vDyfHFXug2ElJ7Yg,0,0,2,8NSUQ5VZNaP1bWq-AuZVWw

They're these middling restaurants that cost $50-$75 or $100 for two and they think they're all rad and ... they're not.

I just said to my girlfriend that I would almost drive the 3 hours to Vegas to have the turkey pastrami sandwich they have.  It's fantastic.

We started with pretzels and provolone cheese sauce.  Again, fantastic!  

The charcuterie was both generous and the selections were very well-curated.  

I should also mention the service.  In Los Angeles we have actor-waiters.  They suck.  Perhaps not all of them suck but at least 90% of them suck.  We both always tell people to get real service -- and sometimes ""real food"" -- one has to go to Vegas.  This restaurant didn't disappoint.  Anne Marie was amazing.

So we went on a Thursday night with 4 people at about 7:30pm. The restaurant wasn't busy but we had made a reservation just to be safe. We ordered the mystery drink shot thing and were disappointed that we ended up with keystone and some terrible raspberry whiskey shot for $8, but it was a mystery thing so we get what we get! I also ordered the pretzel bites which were delicious!!! (even better when you reheat them later after a night of drinking) I also ordered the steak tacos which were really good but I ate waaaay too many pretzel bites to really enjoy the tacos.

Our only complaint was the terrible service. After getting our food for us our waiter disappeared for over thirty minutes. We watched him chatting with other staff members, checking his phone, doing anything but coming over to see if we needed anything. We finally had to ask another staff member to get our checks for us.

I still give it four stars because the food was really good and I am sure some of the other waiters are more attentive!",1YQgacz_ll2nNyQSHMojjw,0,0,4,b8KX-nUVw68hseVRrroBhA

The atmosphere is great, they have a nice outdoor space and bar. 
They need to get it together, I had the grilled cheese and didn't wanna eat it, and that's rare!  How can u mess up grilled cheese?
We also ordered the Italian grinder,  just a bunch of deli meat thrown on bread. I coulda made that at home.

We had the pretzel and provolone cheese dip for an appetizer.  This thing was just phenomenal.  The pretzel, seasoned with sea salt, comes out with a nice provolone dip.  The pretzel was great with or without the dip.  

We had the Korean Ribeye Cap.  This thing blew my wife and me away.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  They cooked this thing where everything was perfect.  The spice, the vegetables, the seasoning, the meat; everything came together for a perfect blend.  This is the one thing I would recommend everyone trying.

For dessert we had the monkey bread.  Like someone else already posted if you wanted a bread pudding mixed with your favorite cinnamon roll this would be it.

Everything is great, the price is reasonable (especially considering this is Vegas), the waiters are very attentive, and the cooks are great.

2562541,2013-04-03,3,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"It angers me to be so hyped up about a place and then have to give them such a low grade rating. Overrated, overpriced and under serviced would be the top 3 ways I could describe it. I was so stoked to try the new raw bar, fresh antipasta made in front of you, outdoor seating with firepits restaurant the Hard Rock was offering. Not to mention menu choices like beef stroganoff, ribs, fried chicken, and meatloaf. I for sure thought I would be in heaven. 
Now let me start with the 2 good things about this place.
1- The ambiance. It was a huge indoor/outdoor 2 bars, view of the pool. AMAZING set up. If you sit indoors, you can watch them make your antipasti platter fresh in front of you which brings me to the the highlight of the meal
2- THE ANITPASTI! So it was for sure over priced. $8 per cured meat. $5 per cheese. $4 per snack (snacks included olives peppers, bread, etc)
My super awesome platter cost $38. Sad that it was the only thing worth it. The meats were perfectly salted and the cheeses were imported. I would actually order this again if I wasn't worried about the cost. 
Thats it. All the positives. 
On to the reason for the 2 star rating. First and foremost the shitty service. Not only was our waiter unattentive and slow. He was careless. He didn't once offer to refill our empty glasses we had to ask. He didn't notice nor care that 1 of the 4 of us barley touched her food due to it being undercooked. (seriously meatloaf pink??) We also noted that our order was put in around 7:30, and we were patiently awaiting our check at 9:20. 
Between us we had ribs that had jalapeno in the title, yet tasted sweet. 2 orders of undercooked meatloaf. And a steak. 
The side items were decent, but even the taters that came with the meatloaf lacked consistency. 
My boyfriend insisted we get dessert since all 4 of us were still hungry and there are not many places in town you can get freshly made monkey bread. Again a dissapointment. Small, and it took more like 20 minutes versus the 10 they claimed it to take. 
Overall the bad food may have been a fluke. I could tell there was a potential for yummy-ness had they cooked the meatloaf another hour, added spice to the ribs, and a little love in their kitchen. On this trip they really lived up the the ""culinary dropout"" name and left a lot to be desired.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,5,1,2,KF-Ciw0Ve2BKY_GZ11jtCA

There was nothing particularly  wrong with our visit. There were seven of us for a bachelorette party and just wanted good dinner and drinks. The apps were fine (pretzel fondue, chips, chicken skin, etc). It wasn't until we got our entrées is where things were off.

Combined we ordered: the burger, pork belly ramen, steak, fried chicken and the ribs. I had a taste of it all and it was okay, with the exception of the fried chicken. The fried chicken was amazing! I wish I ordered that rather than the burger.

I made a reservation for 10a via Opentable. Moseyed in right as they were opening & selected a table on the cusp of inside & outside. Perfect choice! From the hostess to the random employee passing by, everyone was super friendly & chill... my brunchmate seemed memorized by them. Not really knowing what portion sizes to expect, the two of us ordered 3 items to share: Cap'n Crunch french toast, grilled cheese sliders (with fries) & (a special item) asparagus toast. As for the portions- they are more along normal sized (to some they may seem on the small side), so the 3 items for us to share were perfect. The CC french toast was cool!... I'd totally get it again & highly recommend. The grilled cheese sliders & fries were tasty & had great texture... another one I recommend! The asparagus toast should be a regular item... perhaps swapping out the asparagus with whatever is in season? To be honest, I forgot what all was on it... I saw asparagus & was sold. There was perfectly grilled asparagus, truffle oil?, these amazing crackly potatoes & two sunny side up eggs. From the sweet, salty & texture perspectives, we were thoroughly satisfied! By the time we left, the place was full... reservations are definitely the way to go.

On my first visit I ordered my go-to, a Rogue Dead Guy, and the Steamed Mussels which were AWESOME. The portion was much bigger than expected, and the broth was flavorful and packed with herbs and chorizo, accompanied with a side of toasted bread for dipping. 

I took some friends from out of town here last weekend, thinking we could get some good food in a fun place that wouldn't break the bank. I was nervous in reserving a table for 8 at the last minute, but upon walking in at 9:15pm, I noticed that there was hardly anyone there, much like my first visit. The restaurant is huge, with a large outdoor space, but I don't know why there is never anyone there! Our server was awesome and so friendly and patient with a bunch of hooligans at the table, I regret not being able to remember his name. 

My friend and I shared the pretzel bites and provolone fondue which were fun, and generously sized. The pretzel bites were soft and warm, I think our table ordered 4 orders, they were that popular! We also split the buffalo chicken meatballs which I wasn't a huge fan of, they were slightly tough and dry. The smoked salmon salad was more like cooked salmon that had been infused with a smoky flavor, versus cured, smoked, salmon aka lox. It was still good, and came with some melba toast type crackers for spreading, but wasn't entirely what I envisioned.

Found the Culinary Dropout on Yelp with strong reviews.
 Yelp did not disappoint. My husband ordered the Pub Burger which he enjoyed fully.
I ordered the Italian Grinder . Italian sandwich on a lightly grilled roll. I can't say anything negative. Food was fresh and generous portions. Each plate came with a side of fries.

2794545,2018-02-06,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Ok.. I have stayed at the hard rock a couple times but had kept missing their happy hour. So in December, we finally made our way in...and it was really great minus one hiccup.

I was coming off a diet with no bread so the decision was that any bread I had needed to be stellar!!! My gf I was visiting was very whatever about the famous pretzel fondue I told her about but once we got it, she was super happy lol! Who doesn't like cheese and bread? It. It for the vegan and gluten free for sure. We also ordered a round of cocktails and the pork belly nachos. Most of my friends are pork belly crazy but I am not, that said, these were great. 

Because they were slow and we wanted to visit, we did ask to sit at a table. I also have a leg injury I am rehabbing so long sits at a bar can be annoying. Some places can get a real attitude but they accommodated. Our server was great and that was before she gave us some extra cheese to take home with our extra pretzels we weren't able to finish. This was great because my gf's kids got to try it out and they were in love....super special and unexpected. 

The only blemish of the stay that keeps it from being 5 Star was an expediter/other server- the fit lumberjack type white guy with a beard, made a snide comment about the quantity of food we had when he dropped off a plate. 2 plus size women with two appetizers as our meal didn't appreciate it...",NlZacWoKEtCQWRafokAshw,2,1,4,wrH6N4-2qkg5Wy6b7Lonpw

Came here for happy hour and sat inside due to the 104 degree weather outside. However they have a very cute and cool outdoor area with couches, bistro lightening and corn hole game.  Fall night time I can see myself coming to enjoy the outside part.  We only did happy hour food and really had no reason to go beyond since the pretzels and nachos we ordered were completely satisfying.  Most of our drinks were not on happy hour however we're very tasty and worth the typical $12-$15 vegas prices.  Our server was Sean and he was a delight.  We stayed for 5 hours and during this time had a chance to enjoy some live music... three ladies playing modern hits with their violins.  Pretty cool.  In any case just remember if there is a concert that night there is not happy hour.  Otherwise 110% recommend this place for happy hour!  Cheers.",hJqBNS5Tdo9Du-s3DDpMqw,8,6,5,gmEWD2DGk3BYh8YHOuVu9w

2846200,2012-09-23,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Ok, I really dislike signing up for things like Yelp.  Passwords, account set up, log in, etc.  BORING.  But this place was worth the effort.  I was super hungry for some good fried chicken, which is hard to get outside of my mom's kitchen.  I ventured in late (about 11:30) on Friday night.  I wasn't sure what to expect because end of the night dining usually gets end of the night service, food, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised.

     It started off with a stop by the hostess stand to ask if they were still serving.  She was nice.  Really nice.  That isn't always the case.  You know how some hostesses have that ""whatever"" attitude?  Like they are doing you a favor by talking to you?  Great first impression.  I've worked in hospitality and pay attention to things like that.  I told her that since I was eating alone I'd like a table where I could people watch.  She let me choose the table that I liked best.

     My server went through the menu with me but I was set for the chicken.  It came out pretty quick but that was ok because I was hungry.  The dish looked great.  It tasted even better.  The chicken had a slightly sweet, crispy, not soggy breading and was juicy inside.  Man it was good!  The biscuits were ridiculous.  Almost like little cakes.  Soft and moist inside.  I almost asked for more.  Mashed taters were rich (lots of calories I'm sure) and the gravy was the best I've had in a restaurant.  Tasted like the kind that comes from a cast iron skillet in your kitchen.  The surprise was the coleslaw.  I really liked it.  Usually restaurants mess it up.  Too much vinegar or too much mayonnaise.  This was good.  It's rare that I like all of what I'm served in a restaurant.  You know when what you are hungry for tastes just like you want it to?  Bingo, it all hit the spot.

     The manager was walking around checking on guests.  She recommended I try the monkey bread dessert.  So I did.  Think cinnabon meets your grandma's apple pie.  Comes with vanilla ice cream.  Soooooo good!!  The only problem is that I ate so much I had to take a nap in my car before I could drive home!  Lol.  JK.  The manager made a good call on that dessert though.  Perfect way to end my meal. 

To sum it up...it was a great experience.  Great food, good service and a cool vibe inside.",5L-50Iu4R970ZVFw8_aVnA,3,1,5,yDVedcyujtCPyuJdPp-ZGw

Monday through Friday, from 3-6, it includes $3-6 snacks, as well as $3 PBR mugs, $4 well cocktails, and $6 mystery shot and beer.  I stuck with the wells, but they were well made and you can get them with their house-made lemonade.

We sampled the meatloaf sandwich and cheese sliders (both $6) and the house-made chips and onion dip ($3).  The portions are great (regular sized meatloaf and three mini grilled cheese sandwiches); these were delicious. The grilled cheese were perfectly golden and melted and the meatloaf was tender with a great sauce. I loved the homemade onion dip---yum!  The pretzel bites looked good and came in a generous quantity, and the antipasto platter also looked good, but alas, we were too full from our hearty snacks.

Great open floor plan lets you see the kitchen, the bar, and out to the patio/pool (it was closed on the December evening when we were there).

It was my first time at the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel. We parked in the garage and that entrance wasn't a far walk to the restaurant. We decided to dine on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. Maybe we should have chosen an inside table because the music was blaring out of the speakers. Seriously, the music was disturbingly loud, and I wasn't able to properly enjoy the meal or atmosphere. Also, we were there during Happy Hour but specials weren't offered that day because there was a concert in the city later that night. Keep that in mind if you're going specifically for HH. On to the food. We ordered several appetizers. 
Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue- good; but a huge, very filling portion. 
Cheddar & Pork Cracklings- very good; light and airy, great flavor, my favorite out of them all 
Strawberries, Brie, & Pistachio- ok; prefer them served colder
Sherry Glazed Beets & Goat Cheese- ok; if you like beets, then try them with goat cheese
Crusty Bread, Garlic Oil & Balsamic- ok; basic bread, flavors didn't stand out
Oysters (1/2 dozen)- good; if you like them, you know what to expect
The Soiled Dove (cocktail)- very good; I like the individual can of Jose Cuervo they gave me

We order the Moscato, Room Service, and After School Special to start. I was the lucky one to order the Room Service. It has gin, strawberry simple, lemon, and sparkling wine in it and I usually have other liquors, but it was served up and it was delicious. We then ordered our food. I ordered the fried chicken, which came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes, and slaw. It came with 3 pieces which was more than enough but it just wasn't very seasoned. It was just okay. Allyface ordered steak which I thought was a little cold and Niy Niy ordered the shrimp and pork belly ramen. I think his was the best bowl at the table. We also ordered another round of drinks. Next order was another after school special, between you and me, and pinot grigio. I wasn't too thrilled with the between you and me. The belvedere and grapefruit just didn't do it for me. As far as service they were great. We came in and were brought out water before we even started ordering. Our waiter was helpful with the selections as far as drinks and choosing between some menu items. I just wasn't impressed. I mean it was good but it wasn't worth the $150.

We ordered pork belly toast with chips and dip to start. The pork belly toast is so juicy and flavorful. The combination of pickled items with cilantro, the chili oil, Sriracha aioli, and the tender pork belly on a crispy toast that soaks up all the juice goodness is to die for. I would eat two of these as a meal. I was pretty bummed to share such goodness with my husband. Fortunately, the chips and dip were enough for 3. We took the pork belly toast plate and poured the leftover sauce on the plate all over the chips.  It was fantastic. The French onion dip cooled my tongue down from the slight spice on the pork belly appetizer. The chips were super thin and very crispy. They're perfect. 

When our food arrived, I ordered some fries since my Korean cap comes solo. It was a lot of meat and tons of vegetables. The Korean flavor was great with some serious spice. I couldn't stop eating. My husband's chicken was hard not to eat, so I grabbed the drumstick and dove in. I love how crunchy and hot the chicken is, and the coating has a ton of flavor. Their chicken is super tender and juicy, and between the homemade biscuit with a but of mash, gravy, and coleslaw-say goodnight!

3065828,2017-04-24,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Holy shit. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch, and Jesus Christ we'll never come back. We have both bartended and served in the industry for 5 and 6 years, respectively, we tend to go into places with an open mind toward what a place has to offer. 
First off, our server was training a new girl, which usually means better service, you're getting a two for one for gods sake! At the very least you get 1 1/2 times the service because one of them is learning. But sweet Jesus we ended up with 1/2 what we would expect from a single server. They disappeared for long periods at a time, we had to specifically ask for napkins after receiving finger foods, and NEVER got silverware, at any point in time. We got our appetizers and watched it get cold as we continued to wait for our FIRST round of cocktails. 
Apparently the bartender was training as well, those two menu ready cocktails took over 20 minutes (yes, we looked at the time) in a restaurant that was MAYBE 1/10 capacity, including the indoor, outdoor, AND bar seating. 
The drinks were so unbalanced I wanted to smack whomever trained the trainer AND trainee of those bartenders. It's hard to fuck up an old fashioned once you know how to make it, but watered down whiskey with a bourbon cherry on top does NOT an old fashioned make, my friend. 
The menu and cocktail list, along with the quirky name, seemed to have the potential to be a great restaurant and cocktail stop. But the service was horrendous. If this restaurant were not riding on the back of the Hard Rock Casino big brother, I would laugh at the blatant foreshadowing of a business ready to close its doors before the idea could blossom into a singularly successful business. Beyond the total disregard for anything mimicking customer and/or industry service, to see new additions being trained to act as such was blasphemous for all proper restaurants and bars in the world. 

Shame on you and your mooch business model mentality, that clearly relies on a presence inside of a large, profitable casino, that overrides the necessity for an individual attempt at creating a thriving business with a staff worth regarding.",Vp2r0dPCJ27Q7TlWX4oW-w,0,0,1,yFR0Voz3DleuBHCvyrvuig

There was never any mention of my special request on arrival, so I assumed that l wasted my time and didn't want to give an impression of ""gaming something free"". They were not busy. 
The server was very friendly and asserted that everything was fresh and cooked to order. We ordered the potato chips which promptly arrived cold and unsalted. We were told that they are made in advance and if wanted them fresh and hot we had to request that. 
The main courses were very good and large in size. Best things are the Meatloaf and Ribs. 
One other problem...... this is located in the Hard Rock Casino. If you use rideshare you have a very long walk to a special pickup zone in a smoky indoor parking lot, not the convenient main entrance.",5pUREaYxgUu0j8GYWqSLjw,1,0,3,yarqnP35TGqbTgZoGBIizA

I've read some bad reviews about their staff but our waitress was really friendly so that was a plus too.

The food is where everything went downhill. We ordered pretzels with fondue cheese...which to me, was microwaved pretzel bites not cooked fully and some packaged cheese dip thrown over a candle. My wife had fried chicken which somehow got cooked in less than 5 minutes and was terrible, she barely even touched the food. The skin was soggy and gross, the meat was dry and had no flavor...worst of all it cost $22! I had a shaved prime rib dip that had a ton of fat with no flavor. I'm not sure how they justify $18 for this sandwich or the crazy prizes for anything else on their menu. 

Culinary Dropout has pretty much everything going for it besides just one thing...good food. If it weren't for our waitress, I probably would have given this place 1 star.

Came here w/ some friends to grab a quick HAPPY HOUR drink & some munchies. We were  promptly greeted by a sweet girl up front then seated right away.

The decor of the place was fun casual w/ nice half booths & tables. They also had a little stage area as well which I assume for live performances.

Our server Trevor was very laid back & informed us on the menu. We jumped right in & ordered a couple of beers off happy hour & some bites.

TAP NO. 9 HH $3 - this beer wasbour replacement for the APRICOT heff... as they ran out =[ but it was light & crisp. The mug size was PERFECT for me as I was able to actually finish a glass since it was smaller... but for those of you who drink way more than I can... it may be a bit small.

GUINNESS HH $3 - perfectly poured GUINNESS always tastes the best w/ it's creaminess that I have no idea where it comes from when it is such a dark beer you would expect bitter bitterness.

HH PRETZEL & FONDUE $6 - this thing is freaken HUGE! I understand it is just dough... it was still big... LOVED it though... comes out w/ a little candle thing to keep the cheese fondue WARM for every pretzel piece you dip in there.

HH HAND CUT FRENCH FRIES $3 - fresh cut fries that taste like home cooked ones... obviously... cuz they are hand cut ahahaha 

HH POTATO CHIPS & ONION DIP $3 - ummm the freaken DIP is AMAZEBALLS!! simple dish but so addictive that it was the first thing to disappear instantly.

You absolutely NEED to get the pretzels with fondue. They are absolutely incredible. The soft pretzel nuggets are served fresh and steaming with a a sizable portion of melted cheesy goodness. The pork belly nachos were a gigantic serving, after those two apps I couldn't believe we still had an entree and a dessert each.

I ended up getting the Salmon to be on the healthier side of things. It was served with roasted cauliflower and a cauliflower puree and some cut up snap peas. The salmon was moist and cooked perfectly. I loved every single bite.

Culinary Dropout is the type of place I'd love to have in Summerlin.  Great HH portions and about 10 beers for $4 (all drafts) from 3-6pm.  I had the salmon brushetta to begin.  Great portion size.  The dish came with 3 large pieces of toast, smothered in great tasting salmon and a few anchovies.  I also ordered a kale and brussel sprouts salad with some added salmon to keep the fish theme alive.  This was a remarkable salad.  Large portion, fresh veggies, and even peeled sprout leaves, very unusual for a salad topping and more seen as a side dish.  I loved it in the salad nonetheless.  I couldn't finish it all so lunch will be tasty as a leftover.  The total cost of this was $30 after tax.  Not cheap but also similar to a downtown Summerlin or high end pub anywhere else in the country.  I really enjoyed the restaurant's food and overall menu and would surely recommend it as an event space, a HH destination, or even to listen to live music.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,hSXH_yJH4UarMeym0HMpXA

3377248,2017-10-23,2,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"I bookmarked this restaurant before our trip to Vegas because the name sounded catchy. It's inside the Hard Rock Casino by the pool and thankfully, they were open for brunch cause we were out all night :)

First, we asked our friendly server what was the best hangover cure drink. She recommended Prairie Oyster shot made with raw egg, worcestershire, tabasco, salt and pepper. It did not sound or look appetizing but we were brave enough to try and it was actually not bad. Then I ordered the Capital Green made with white tequila, cilantro, mint verdita, pineapple and sparkling wine. It was a bit heavy and strong but I'm not complaining here. It was just what I needed after the shots...lol

Next, we ordered the Pork Belly Nachos to share. The nachos were made fresh in-house piled with flavorful pork, cheese, guac, sour cream, and beans. For the main course, I got myself the Honey Drizzled Fried Chicken with homemade buttermilk biscuit, coleslaw, and mash. Simply mouthwatering! The chicken was perfectly crisp, tasty and juicy. It's been a while since I had fried chicken this good. My buddies got the Grilled Cheese Sliders and Shave Prime Rib Dip. Both looked awesome as well and by the look on their faces, they enjoyed them. Breakfast items start at $8 to $14, sandwiches from $12 to $18 and entrees go for $18 to $27. Cocktails are about $12 average. My Fried Chicken was $22. Pricey but it was worth every penny.

We really had a pleasant experience at this restaurant. Good quality, big portions, delicious cocktails and super friendly staff. Plus it was not crazy busy so we got seated right away at a table with a nice view of the pool.

For being a drop out, this place is excelling in the tough world of Vegas dining. 

I ordered the House Salad to start off with, a Turkey Pistrami sandwich to assuage my appetite, and a Bourbon Black Bottom Pie as a closure to my meal.

First-Course - House Salad: Just like the name states, it's a house salad. Standard greens, nothing creative, this comes with buttermilk ranch. I was praying that this basic salad wasn't foreshadowing what was to come next.

Second-Course - Turkey Pistrami: This made up for the first-course. Served on a pretzel roll are slices of peppery turkey pistrami and lightly-dressed coleslaw, this sandwich is on the heavy side, but it's delish! 

Third-Course - Bourbon Black Bottom Pie: I love this. I can eat this all day long until I barf. This is a rich and chocolaty ganache with salted, crumbled graham crackers that form the bottom of the pie. The light sweetness of the chocolate and the salty crackers pair together perfectly.

Service: Good.

Overall: I'm giving Culinary Drop Out an ""A."" The salad may have been ""blah,"" but everything else was terrific,",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,4,4,7uU2XR15x3tMD37jIBnbFA

I recently stayed for multiple nights at The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and found myself drawn back night after night to dine here, by myself or with friends. 

The food is consistent, tasty, and the staff blows the roof off any dining establishment I've been to. I have to take a moment and call out those that served me... Gary, Matt, Dillon, Jake, Hayley, & all the rest I met, because they had an awesome vibe, great anticipation of my needs during my meal, and above all else they made what can sometimes make for a business trip of meals alone into a warm, pleasant experience. That's why I keep going back, because I felt like I was spending my meal with friends. If you haven't tried Culinary Dropout I urge you to give it a try you won't be disappointed. 

Personally I recommend:

Starters: Sherry Beet Salad, Deviled Eggs, Hummus
Cheap house salad with gorgonzola dressing

Entrees:
The fried chicken (it's amazing)
The Meatloaf

Culinary Dropout is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts conglomerate of restaurants; the original Culinary Dropout is in Fox's homebase of Scottsdale. I can haz franchising rights in Texas?

I'd heard good things about Hard Rock's atmosphere, and while that mostly disappointed, Culinary Dropout was a fine time. We made reservations for 9 people on a Saturday night, which were completely unnecessary. The restaurant was about half-full, though part of the reason is it's huge with a great, casual patio.

We immediately got a free serving of Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue--delicious--a result of a duplicate order. Great start. I was mostly drawn to the impressively diverse, if pricey, beer menu. Woe is me; instead of embracing diversity, I ended up sticking to the very delicious Joseph James lager all night. There's some good stuff on there, and if you've lost all your money gambling on the tables there's also a ""paper bag special"" for $3. Our waitress described it as Bud Select or something of that ilk; we stayed away but I found it cheekily fun.

Menu prices are quite reasonable after getting eye-gouged by the Vegas exchange rate. The Meatloaf--my choice, was exceptionally large and quite filling. Ends were more than a little burnt, but I enjoyed the ""meaty"" part and enjoyed the sides. The Shaved Prime Rib Dip got huge raves from our waitress, who was excellent all night, as well as my fellow diners who ordered it. The Fish & Chips and 36-Hour Pork Ribs were called as decidedly average.

It's a really great ambiance, and if the Hard Rock had more of the ""zoo"" atmosphere that I was promised, I think the night would've been even better. As it is, it's a short cab ride from the strip and was still a great time regardless.",skbZO4vHHHA-ejA_BUwKjg,9,5,4,FFFvvmsXg-rO-XNQqdCNMw

3577047,2015-02-21,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"I get food comps every week at Hard Rock and have eaten here a few times but no more.

First off, things here are way overpriced.  $4 for a small bowl of fried chicken skin, $12 for a pretzel and dip, over $30 for a small portion of steak and fries.  I didn't care about this too much because it was always covered by the comp, but when I compare the value and quality of what I can get here with what I can get elsewhere, it just doesn't make sense.

As to the actual quality of the food, some of it is OK.  The grizzini (breadsticks) are pretty good, and I recall the ribs being decent.  Every steak I've had here has been awful though.  I've gotten both the korean rib cap and the steak with the dolce gorgonzola.  Both are pre-cut, usually fatty or gristly, and very small portions.  Maybe 6-8 ounces or something like that.  Service here has always been a bit slow, even though they are never busy when I go by (usually around noon on a weekday).  If you sit at the bar at least your drink service will be a bit better, but food still takes a while to come out.

On my most recent visit I went with my girlfriend and we were seated quickly near the only other two occupied tables in the restaurant.  Several servers/waiters came by but never stopped to even ask for our drink orders.  One server walked past us briskly without stopping and greeted us, but that was all!  And it's not like I have a bad rep here -- I order simply and always tip.  The girl at the front even knows I usually choose to sit at the bar.  After at least 5 minutes we got up and left, giving our menus to the girl at the front and told her what happened.  She went off to yell at the waiters and we went next door to Mr .Lucky's.

Let me tell you, Mr. Lucky's is amazing compared to this place.  Most casino's 24 hour cafe style restaurants are pretty normal but they really do have great food here.  The prices look a tad steep, but the quality/portions are great.  One of the best casino cafe burgers, definitely the best casino cafe chicken fingers, the short stack of pancakes is great, and the steak & eggs is the best I've ever had (yes even better than the vaunted Ellis Island's).

So, long story short, screw you Culinary Dropout.  Your food ranges from average to plain awful, and your service is the pits.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,0,2,SC92Fi2AQQNswPfAMWxfuw

How can you not want to come here just to try these delicious little bites of crunchy, salty bread goodness with a creamy, delectable cheese sauce?! The bites are huge and they give you a huge bowl of the fondue which as a big cheese fan I truly appreciate. Better ratios means extra dipping.

We ordered a couple craft cocktails that were amazing too, including the Room Service and Pistols at Dawn. Both great choices!",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,1,2,4,BgLLkmkki-t2kFw2AXepyg

3666587,2014-06-18,7,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Talk about joke. No wonder this place is called ""Culinary Dropout.""

It was my girlfriend's birthday and her choice to eat here. I came a little later than 8:30pm on a Sunday; and it wasn't too busy to handle our 12 person party. 

Already when I sat, I was greeted with my friends telling me not to order Hennessy and/or the oysters because ""they were out of it."" Hmmm, ohhkaaay ---- I guess that ruled out those options.

I ordered a Moscow Mule and was saddened when it came in a regular glass cup. Sure, I would get a dollar off for bringing my own copper mug (as stated on their menu) but, who really carries around a copper mug. And if this place is gonna have 3+ assortments of ""mules"" then they need to have ""The Mug!""

As we chit chatted, the waiter comes back to tell my roomie that the olives he ordered for his anti-pasti ""wasn't ready yet"" because ""it wasn't cured."" --- what does that even mean --- My sassy 'tude was like, ""is it sick?"" My roomie said to just bring out the bread, sundried tomatoes, and balsamic. It was decent. Balsamic was sweeter than most I've had. In the end, it wasn't anything special.

My friend, who was sitting next to me, got the salmon entrée. And lemme tell you that his first reaction to the dish was priceless; almost jaw dropping awe lol 
His first words were: ""THIS was $25!"" (((Hence the picture/meme I have to go with this review))) The salmon was smaller than most salmon I've bought at the grocery store. It laid on less than handful of brown rice and veggies. My friend said: ""this would be the perfect dinner for someone on a diet -- too bad that aint me."" Funny thing is this is what the waiter recommended as ""the best thing on the menu."" 
My friend had to share his girlfriend's burger and fries to get even some fulfillment. **SHRUGS**

I shared the jambalaya with my roomie and that was spicy enough to my liking and even though the chicken, shrimp, and sausage jambalaya was mixed in with rice; our Asian asses still ordered a side of rice with it.
Other friends got the steak, meatloaf, curry, and prime rib dip sandwich. Everyone was pleased with their food but, in the end, it was nothing that stood out.

All the while we're eating, we were never filled with our water nor ordered more alcohol. It was just a less blah. 

Even their monkey bread dessert, which we were told could serve 4 ppl, COULD NOT serve 4 ppl. It was like bite sized cinnabon donut holes if they had that.


Our waiter was funny tho and did the best he could with what he had, I'm sure.

I saw a little stage set up for a small band - looked cool.

Ok now for the best part - FOOOOD! So many things looked good on the menu. I ultimately went for the nachos. I am a sucker for nachos if they are described as loaded with toppings - yes pork belly was a eye catcher. While in the midst of getting my drank on it was a wise choice. Well they came thru - the nachos were excellent. Loaded with slow BBQ pork, black beans, guac, pico and a pretty interesting cheese sauce. The plate was large too - totally a entree on its own. Very flavorful and evenly mixed toppings, I wasn't left with a pile of chips after. 

I was also eyeing the fried chicken, it was touted as a restaurant fav. Luckily it was ordered at our table too and I was able to get a bite. Woah yes this was very good too. Again no shortage on flavor. Seemed pressure cooked with a crunch. Huge sized pieces along with mashed potatoes and gravy and coleslaw. A real BBQ picnic style plate here. A bit greasy but it is fried chicken after all. The meat is really tender and savory. A biscuit was also brought along side and that even was down right good. 

Oh and a friend ordered the roasted brussels sprouts. Ehh I wasn't looking for this tonight but glad I gave them a try. They would probably make someone who didn't like brussels sprouts actually like them. They were really good.

The word gastropub is becoming dirty in Las Vegas.  Culinary Dropout gave me a perspective on how to abuse this title.  Not a HUGE (Cheesecake Factory/Grand Luxe-esque) but Vegas appropriately broad selection of dishes.  

The space that restaurant consumes makes it feel like a hanger with a dynamic inside-outside transition that shows off the beauty of the HRH pools.

That's where everything went downhill...

The service was Vegas nice, the music was Hard Rock music and despite GnR beginning their residency, I was expecting a larger rush at the CD.  

The antipasti which we ordered came approximately 3.5 minutes to my buddy and mine's entrees being served.  All of which were at room temperature...no bueno.

No bueno on a few folds...cured meats at room temperature are very strange (to me) at room temperature.  Add a bistro steak ordered Medium Rare, SERVED Rare, and at room temperature is also distressing, the only reason I didn't send it back was the flavors from the gastrique and Gorgonzola and my supreme hunger level at that time.

I did have a good time and the food was okay however, this was nothing I'd ever want to experience again, especially for the prices they charge. $22 for average fried chicken, one biscuit, and freezing cold mashed potatoes? I could do better at Church's Chicken.

My wife had the trout, she said it was good but also agreed it wasn't worth the price and the wait.

A little hard to hear, with music being quite loud. Overall, the ambiance is comfortable and relaxing. 

Food is superb. I get grilled chicken on pretzel bun with fries every time. Not stingy with the chicken and the ranch is TO DIE FOR.

I DO NOT like cheese with my pretzels, but the cheese sauce that comes with the pretzel bites appetizer is just such a beautiful harmony of flavors in my mouth. 

My sister got the fried chicken and said it was the best ever. Moist and well seasoned. 

They did have a blueberry cider beer when we went months ago, not sure if they still have it. But, it was really good.

DESSERT: Salted caramel custard with homemade caramel popcorn. It is life. It is just perfect and beautiful and fulfilling and ..... just RIGHT! It is the best dessert I've had in Las Vegas.

I'd pay $6.00 for one. We decided to also split pierogis with crispy Brussels sprouts. Melted in your mouth.  We wanted a bowl of the Brussels sprouts. Mustard creme friache that it came on was amazing.  

I got the fish and chips.  Soooo good. It practically melted in your mouth as well. I was going to get the grilled cheese sliders but it looks like those no longer exist.

Loved the fact that the restaurant is directly by the pool. They do have a section of tables outside with fire pits, but it was closed during the day due to wind (which is the reason for the missing star -- if I asked, and there is a server present, you should let me sit outside).

Starters: Soft pretzels w/ provolone fondue $12.  OMG, this creamy, velvety fondue is one of the best liquid cheese creations I have ever had.  I could eat it everyday.
Cheap House Salad $6.  This was just okay.  No taste complaints, but the 'buttermilk ranch' was not really evident.

Drinks: Between You & Me: Belvedere, grapefruit, cranberry, and lemon.  Very refreshing and a little tarte.  Enjoyed.  The BF had a beer on tap- can't remember which, but it was nice and cold the way he likes his beer.

Main course: Ma...the Meatloaf!?! $18. Served with green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy.  This one took me back to grade school.  I could have sworn that my grandmother was back there making this meal.  If you want 'comfort food' with a homemade taste, this is the dish for you.  

Fried Chicken $22 served with mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, and a buttermilk biscuit.  Really good chicken.  Super crispy golden exterior, juicy flavorful chicken inside.  Same tasty potatoes, and the cole slaw was a bit bland.

Desserts: Bourbon Black Bottom Pie $7 and Salted Caramel Custard $8.  The pie and the custard were both too rich for us, but the salted caramel corn that comes on top of the custard was like crack!

There was a live band playing some good throwback songs, like ""Santeria"". But it was difficult to have a conversation with the person next to me because of how loud it was. It only lasted about the first 20ish minutes that we were there.

As an appetizer, we shared pretzel bites with the provolone fondue. The pretzels seemed too salty for my tastes, but once it was dipped in the cheese...it was AMAZING. We considered asking for another order of this once we realized how quickly we devoured them.

I ordered the fried chicken, which came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and a biscuit. But I substituted the cole slaw for an extra biscuit. I wasn't expecting the fried chicken to be so damn good! Seriously, it was the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. It was crispy and I don't know what kind of magical batter they used on the chicken, but it was just perfect. I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes. The biscuits were so good. They were soft and the honey on top just made it that much better.

For dessert, I had the salted caramel custard. And it had caramel popcorn on top. I'm obsessed with salted caramel desserts and this one is HIGH on my list. It wasn't too sweet.

4044862,2013-03-24,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Got a sitter lined up for Saturday night so the hubs and I could have a date night. We had been to a couple Fox Restaurants in Phoenix, and enjoyed them, so we set Culinary Dropout for our destination.
 
7pm on a Saturday night, we did not have reservations. The place was not packed, but we were told all the tables were reserved and so we had to sit at a large high-top communal table in the bar area. No big deal. The service was prompt and very friendly. We started with the recommended pretzel bites (they were very good and enough for probably 4 people). Draft beers were $2.95, which I thought was pretty awesome for a Friday evening, and liked even more when I saw the selection. Standard domestics, but also Sierra Nevada, Joseph James, and a Prohibition Lager. Good stuff! For dinner I ordered the fried chicken which was really delicious. The outside is crispy, with a little bit of honey, and the meat inside is nice and juicy - juicy not greasy! It's served with cornbread, cole slaw, and mashed potatoes, which were all excellent. I ate about half of it, and was so excited to have the rest for lunch the next day, but I forgot my to go box on the table! Boo I hate when that happens! My husband had the bistro steak, which was good but not great.

I was very happy when I requested a mocktail and the server asked me about my preferences. We sat and hung out for so long that she actually brought me 3 different mocktails throughout the evening. Awesome!

The food is a little overpriced, but not for a place in a casino. Our entire tab was ~$100 with tip (included 3 beers, 3 mocktails, 2 entrees, and an app).

Best of all, Jeremy Cornwell was playing from 7-10 and taking requests! If you haven't seen this guy, he's an awesome one-man-band type of show, where he records each beat and then plays it on loop, recording the next beat over it. We talked to him after his set ended, and he'll be at Culinary Dropout every Saturday night, 7-10, and Blue Martini every Tuesday and Friday.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,2,1,4,-e_u12mR7ROfYjqynmPo5w

4061522,2017-08-23,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"I love the name of the restaurant,  I love their pretzel fondue even more! 

Service:  Other than lunch visits for work, I usually sit at the bar to stay as close to the booze as possible.  Lunch service has never been an issue and the bartenders who pull double duty as your server have always come through.  Everyone has been friendly and social.

Food:  The pretzel fondue is my favorite dish there. lol  Cheese and the pretzel balls work so well here.  ""Ma..the Meatloaf!"" (what's she doing back there?) might be the only meatloaf I'll order in a restaurant.  Strong statement from a guy who's not into meatloaf. The pub burger and the BBQ Pork belly nachos are solid choices while drinking.  Speaking of booze, beer cans are mainly in the $6-$7 range with some great craft choices.  Tap beer rotation seems to be your mainstream IPAs, Guinness, and Bud Light

Value: Culinary dropout cuisine is a mixture of bougie bar food and some legit main entrees.  The pricing is fair as the quality of the ingredients and preparation is very good.  It can add up quickly if you're hitting up multiple dishes, but I'm usually here for the pretzels, beer and maybe another dish.  With that, I feel like I get a good experience for the price.

Ambiance: Dimly Lit at night with open room seating keeps it intimate as the tables are spaced apart perfectly for your privacy.  I've come across some live acoustic guitar on their mini stage which livens up the energy.  It's just a little too loud and is almost drowns out conversation at the table and it's another reason I sit at the bar which is furthest away from the stage.

Culinary Dropout is a great place to pre-game with your friends before a night out on a town or just a night out for a casual dinner and drinks.  Located in the Hard Rock Hotel, it's usually where I stop by before a concert there or before a night out close to the strip.  Location convenience and the consistently good service and food makes it a great joint that I can rely on  Enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,5,2,4,qkD2tfCS9fN4qJEkb6EIdQ

(3.25 stars)

Well, one needs to re-enroll and learn how to plate dishes.


After several rounds of slots at the Hard Rock cafe, we came to Culinary Dropout to get something to eat. It wasn't our first choice or a priority, it was a place that came to mind last minute. I'll be honest, I didn't have any expectation. When we entered the restaurant it was pretty empty. I'd expect a little more of a crowd knowing ReHab is just around the corner. What I noticed was the minimal selection on the menu, nothing caught my eye. With no appetite and no prior research of ""what should I order"", I picked something quick and simple off the menu. Our table had fried chicken (heard it was good - didn't taste it), french toast (took a bite, pretty good!), and my order....

THAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS - cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, and lime. First and foremost, presentation was UGLY. Why would you blanket the wings with Asian coleslaw. I had to dig through the messy Asian coleslaw just to see a wing. Digging for chicken wings. The wings aren't the dry wings, they are coated with sauce. The sauce on the wings and on coleslaw are the same and it's that repetitive Asian sauce you see at many American restaurants on Asian dishes. After a bite into the wings, I was presently surprised that I actually enjoyed it. The coating on the wings weren't too thick but it does require napkins and wipes afterwards. 

I don't think I'll return because there are far more restaurants in LV to explore next visit. 

Until the next review....",aVaa64zb_-d6VTY3XcXyIQ,2,1,3,Y0qRHMHH-EXE6Ortnt6GzQ

Still looking for that 5 star burger.

Located within the Hard Rock Cafe, which is not on the Las Vegas strip sits a trendy little eatery and bar dishing out some ice cold drinks,  snacks, burgers and delicious dishes. 

What I loved here was the whole design of the resturant. The Ambience here is super cool. You have a variety of tables, chairs, couches to dine on, both inside and out. Outdoor seating gives you a clear pool side view. Service is right on track, with eye candy servers with pleasant personalities. Had a very resort like feel to it.

For starters we had the homemade chips and dip. They were fresh and yummy.

I was hoping to of found my 5 star burger here, but my burger did not deliver that 5 star satisfaction.  My hand made burger topped with Havani cheese and bacon on a toasted bun was on the dry side. It was complimented with a little side salad with basalmic vinegar dressing. My date had the fried chicken and mashed tatters which he thought was just okay.

Lunch for 2 was about $45.00

But I thought the final edible results were just alright. The Yelp reviews are mostly raving, so I may in the minority. But had I not been staying in the Hard Rock, I wouldn't have made a bee-line to eat here.

That being said, I think it's a great bar. Great selection, the signature cocktails and mixed drinks are killer - great flavors and creativity. Just wouldn't plan on eating here when there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas.

1 Star for the small bites crispy bread and good oil (seriously- so good, I wished the rest of the food was this good. I wouldve have been happy if this was an entire meal).

now thats thats out of the way, here's my not so great experience...

Went to Hard Rock to see Andrew Dice Clay. My BF and I were debating on either Culinary Dropout or 35 Steaks & Martini's. We decided that Culinary Dropout seemed like a really cool concept, so we picked this place.

We arrived, ordered drinks and a salad. We wanted an appitizer so I go to order the grilled asparagus. Our waitress said it wasnt available ok, ordered the artichoke hearts, not available. Ok fine, ordered the crusty bread (see above). Then we waited and waited to order our food, I kinda had my heart set on Fish and Chips and again, it was not available. That is a really bad sign, we should've saw the red flags when we ordered the apetizer and collected our check to go elsewhere, but we were pressed for time so we decided just to get what was available.

My BF ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the bistro steak. We waited over 30 mins for our food to come out. Our waitress, even knew that we were there a while because she kept checking on us.

We get our food- my steak and fries were aveage at best. Nothing special. I could've had the same steak at Norms diner (No joke). I really felt bad for my BF because his food was even worse than mine. My BF's food- The meatloaf, seriously tasted like it was from a cafeteria with a squirt of ketchup on the top. Not a special custom/mixed ketchup, it was straight out of the bottle (my mom makes a better meatloaf). ......and the mashed potatoes... were not edible. They were cold and bland. My bf took one bite and said they werent good. I tried them to see if he was being dramatic, and he wasn't. 

It was all very disappointing and I expected something much better- AT least the name is fitting to the food- Culinary Dropout. No kidding!

 I wished we had a better dinner experience on our last night in vegas. Oh well :(",bBNhsmVNBecSgkpOMbKuBQ,1,2,2,czGtvB3x9U4rmRmJOjFiew

Still no complaints for $2.95.  We also ordered truffle fries and the grilled asparagus, both good snacks but a little surprised the asparagus was served chilled.  Still ate everything and ordered the prime rib dip w/ au jus.  Sandwich was good, but wouldn't mind trying some other things on the menu.

4132208,2012-08-22,16,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"In recent years Las Vegas has seen various forms of 'Gastro-Pub' appear here and there around town. 'Herb's and Rye' over on Sahara and Valley View,  'Todd English P.U.B.', at the Crystals Shopping with Aria and more recently 'Public House' at The Venetian. All offer a dining experience with lots of great food, great mixed cocktails and most with an extensive beer list. The food offerings are all similar with fresh shellfish at many,  braised and pickled meats, and often rich delicious dessert items. 

Enter Culinary Dropout.  Described as a Gastro Pub with 'Amp'd Up Food Fare', the newest addition to the pub scene also includes some pretty amazing classic style cocktails, as well as some more original bar offerings, and a tasty wine list. 

Among my favorite - the ""Smashed Irishmen' a concoction of Guinness, Jameson Irish Whiskey , Honey and Mint.. It's sweet and in my opinion, delicious is  truly an understatement. To go along with that, I had one of the most perfect Old Fashion Cocktails that I have ever experienced, finished with Luxardo Cherries and Fresh Orange.. I know, I know.. mixing liquor can be dangerous.. but seriously fun! 

The food menu is just as varied. An antipasti menu with a superior selection of cheeses, cured meats and vegetables, as well as some very 'comfort-food' style selections. There is a delicious Fried Chicken with Fresh Buttermilk Biscuits,  Pan Seared  Trout with an Almond Butter Sauce, and even a version Panag-Style Chicken Curry with Potatoes. For the slightly more foodie adventurous, Id say to give the Jambalaya shot.. House Made Andouille Sausage, Shrimp and Chicken.. with Pablano Peppers.. sure to set your mouth on fire. 

For dessert.. I'd have to say the Salted Caramel Custard topped with fresh Caramel Popcorn is my absolute favorite, but the Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart comes in close second. 

Whatever you end up with, Culinary Dropout has a nice hold on the idea of a place really being fun. Live music, great scenery and quality food and drink. You will find me here often I think. Happy Eating!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,23,22,5,yI6uidNBr5By0dqD-24ULg

Pretzels & fondue: freshly baked pretzel bites with a provolone and fontina fondue are perfectly soft bites of ptrezel and gooey cheese. 

Turkey Reuben: boyfriend loves this dish. In house smoked turkey pastrami, coleslaw, thousand island on fresh baked pretzel roll. The turkey is tender and perfectly smoked. The side of fries are decadent an perfectly salty. 

Breakfast burrito: scrambled eggs (I opt for egg whites) sautéed pablano peppers, bacon and cheese wrapped in a soft flour tortilla and served with house potatoes. Very good, salsa on the side and the potatoes are delish!

Yogurt parfait: Greek vanilla yogurt, house made granola and fruit is a good light way to start the day. 

Prime rib dip: tender prime rib, fontina cheese, horseradish and au jus served on a homemade French roll. Tender, succulent roast beef, literally melts in your mouth.

Ordered the black mussels, 36hr pork ribs, and turkey pastrami. The black mussels was a huge appetizer and could easily be shared between 2-3 people. It was good and just enough seafood garlic flavor but not too overwhelming. The turkey pastrami came out with fries and pickle and had a savory salty flavor on the bread that went well with the smoked turkey. The ribs were every bit as I expected 36hr pork ribs should taste like. The flavors were so infused in the meat that every bite was tasty. The dish also came with coleslaw and fries so it was nice that each dish had some savory sides to go with it. 

I really liked the drinks here though. I had the drunken panda while my bf had the pistols at dawn. The drunken panda had Lucky Buddha lager (and calamansi!) but they only put half in the mixed drink so they give you the rest of the beer in the bottle. It's a good summer drink especially with the cucumber infusion. Shout out to my server (I forgot his name) who suggested it and was super spunky, funny, and a good story teller. Also, is it just me or is it a requirement in this place for their bartenders and servers to be tatted. Because my server had full sleeves and tattoos all the way to his neck. They're all really friendly though so not complaining. 

Overall, I thought the food was decent, atmosphere casual with the option of eating out in their patio which had some outdoor games, and the servers were attentive but would suggest coming at a less busy time to get faster service.

4234375,2013-01-28,5,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"I am in love with the menu at Culinary Drop Out! Any place with a raw seafood bar is a win in my book. Pretty much everyone front of house is attractive and the place hums with a laid back vibe while maintaining a posh yet edgy atmosphere. So why the two star rating?

Everything sounded better on the menu than it actually was- everything just fell short of expectations. The service here was just terrible. The worst service I've had all year, maybe ever. We waited 20 minutes just to see our server for drinks, we waited even longer for water and the coffee that we ordered never got a refill.. Even though it was requested twice. The courses weren't paced at all so I had soup getting cold while a sandwich got soggy and my oysters got warm. Service is a total bust!

Unfortunately the food didn't make up for the bad service. 
The cheese fondue which was ordered on the recommendation of our waiter was really a glorified Velveeta. The soft pretzels were good, but really they're just a mode of transportation for the hot melty cheese which arrived at the table with a skin already formed over the top. Really appetizing (sarcasm). Overall, really bland, with no bite.
The white shrimp is served with the shell on but cleaned and they were fantastic! Perfectly cooked. Best part of the meal by far! I'd definitely make me way back here for a cocktail and shrimp cocktail if it's not inconvenient.
The Kushi oysters which are normally my favorite had a sort of funk, even though it was apparent they were shucked to order.
The French Onion Soup was quite possibly the worst I've ever had (and I once unwisely made the mistake of ordering French Onion at Applebees). Bland light colored broth with too much thyme, a round of tough rye bread topped with just a little cheese on top that had been cooked to death. There was no melty stringy cheesy goodness here that you have to wrap around the spoon to maintain a little dignity.. Just a stale crouton witha  crust of hard cheese floating in bland broth.
The warm Italian Grinder, also at the recommendation of our server, was nothing special and arrived crisp on the top.. But soggy as all heck on the bottom. This soggy-bottomed sandwich comes with hand cut fries on the side which were the best part of that meal.

Even though the service was so bad and the food so mediocre, I really did fall hard for their menu and will give it another go. I feel like maybe, just maybe, I ordered the wrong items and I got the wrong server, and just went on the wrong day. We couldn't even get our food boxed up and when we did (25 minutes later) it came back with fondue on the side and got my hand all greasy. The worst part of it all was when our waiter finally did come back after his lengthy disappearance and immediately starting clearing away plates, taking away a whole shrimp and oyster. That's $6 worth of deliciousness, man! Always ask before clearing!

Their specialty cocktail menu had a sleuth of amazingly well thought-out libations and that alone is enough to bring me back.

The quality of the food is GREAT. Interesting menu with astonishing variety, quality ingredients and genuinely creative approach. My table shared the mussels and burrata pear thingy for apps, then I had the chicken curry while others had the ribs, the burger and the ribeye. Everything was great, and no pricier than any other gastropub in a Strip hotel. 

The atmosphere is a bit on the douchey side. It's REALLY loud, and opens out onto the epicenter of the douchiverse, the Hard Rock pool. The waitstaff are all waaaay too cool for school; apparently, the shtick is that there are no uniforms; they can wear whatever they want..which means trendy-slutty apres-pool attire for the ladies, and hipster-douche chic for the dudes. The service was OK; it was really busy (right before the Def Leppard show) so I'll cut 'em some slack for the lackluster nature.

I'd come here again, but on a slow night. I like to TALK over my meals, and it was just too freaking loud.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,12,9,4,F88PEV6yf8rQqYKHJ0-rhA

Ordered a half dozen oysters to start. They could have been cleaned a bit better, I had more than a few with some serious grit in them. And I know there's always going to be SOME grit and sand, but this probably could have been remedied with another rinse or two. Good sauce accompanies it, though. Just be conservative with it, the oysters taste delicious on their own. 

I had the meatloaf. It didn't taste as good as my mom's (but, really, does it ever, people?) but it was actually better than I was expecting. A solid, well-formed loaf, not too spongy, nice firmness. Seasoning was mild, not too heavy as to take away the taste of the meat. 

It came with green beans, which were extremely underdone. Better than overdone, but I found it odd they'd serve them like that; didn't complement the dish at all. I think it also came with mashed potatoes. The fact I can't remember likely means the other side dish was innocuous enough that it went down good but wasn't worth storing in my mind.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,3,2,4,7-hLDzcFlI3YZgOJStQNZA

There was also a pretty good live musician playing on the front stage - the poor guy was playing to a 1/2-empty restaurant on a Sunday night but hey, still did a good job playing in general.  

The aesthetic was pretty nice with a full bar and bar seating, some nice tables and some other seats scattered about.  Don't expect for quiet conversation inside as the music is put up pretty loud.

At noon on a Saturday we were seated without delay in the large restaurant. Our friendly, attentive waitress was right over to get our orders started. 

I started with Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue which were delicious. The pretzels were indeed soft and the cheese was tasty. The Italian Chopped Salad was also delicious and a generous portion. There was a great variety of meats and vegetables in the salad with couscous that added a little something to the salad. The Italian dressing was good and not too heavy. My Chocolate S'mores Pudding was an excellent ending to the meal. The melted marshmallow on top of the chocolate pudding would be delicious enough, but the grahams for dipping made it perfect. Overall, I was very happy with every part of my lunch.

My husband started with a House Salad that was fine and then The Pub Burger that he really enjoyed. The fries on the side were crispy and delicious. His Banana Crème Pie was a pop of banana flavor and delicious.

The only things I didn't love about the restaurant was that despite an entire wall being windows the restaurant was very dark. They could definitely benefit from more lighting as ambiance lifter.

 I gamble at Hard Rock fairly frequently and I've always wanted to check this place out. The 4-star Yelp reviews and clever restaurant name is what sold me. Since I was dining with my imaginary friends, we headed over to the bar area to cause a ruckus. I ordered the Turkey Pastrami sandwich w/ side salad, based on the bartender's recommendation. 

As I was waiting, I people watched the hordes of tatted up, juiceheads and guidos running around half naked .My in-dining entertainment, included a patron who lined up a shot of vodka, the $4 pineapple mind eraser special, a Pabst Blue Ribbon, and a glass of wine and pounded all 4 drinks within a minute. Super classy.

The food arrived fairly quickly. The sandwich was served with a warm pretzel roll, with generous slices of turkey pastrami, swiss cheese, and smothered with cole slaw.  The sandwich was okay. Pretty messy to eat and it didn't have a wow-factor. The salad was just average too. Chilled romaine lettuce, bits of cucumber, and covered with a watery buttermilk ranch dressing. The menu, including water, came out to be a whoppin' $18 dollars with tip. 

The bartenders were friendly and was very prompted in serving us. I took a look at the drink menu prices, and we took our party elsewhere. 

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes.

Got the pretzels to start and OMG they are delicious as is the fondue that comes with them. I went on to the egg sandwich, which was really solid. The kid had the captain crunch French toast, which was great, but very sweet - almost like dessert. Everyone else loved their dishes as well. The service was friendly and efficient.

Second visit - Happy Hour with the hubs. Yippee - those 'to die for' pretzels are on the happy hour menu so you know we ordered them. Also got the antipasto plate which had a nice mix of things. Of course, we enjoyed a few cocktails, from the Happy Hour menu as well. And in the end we were, duh, happy. Once again, great service.

I really dig this place and like the décor. Also, like looking out at the pool and cant' wait to go back when the weather is a little cooler and they open the garage doors.  I just hope this place can make it. It wasn't very busy on either of our visits.",JDSaFzi7BqXyEQL5l0BqhQ,1,1,5,qpYKSOrxd2pQDRHngg6LvQ

We split the monkey bread and it was also really good. 

Only complaints were that service was a little slow and someone in my group ordered tabasco sauce when we ordered our meal and didn't come so we had to wait. The server didn't really make any recommendations or have much to say about the menu at all (we asked).

The menu is one page and not complicated to read. The Thai child chicken wings was delicious and tasty for appetiser. I also ordered fried chicken and it was delicious with crispy skin.

Since we were a party of four, we got to have a few different things around the table starting with the pretzel bites which was more than plenty to share around the table.  I am on a salad kick and therefore ordered the kale and sweet potato salad with the salmon on top, and since I was hungry, yesterday's soup (chicken tortilla that day); the crunchy bits in the salad are pomegranate and overall it was a tasty and filling salad and salmon had a nice, flaky, crusty, finish that seems like the result of sweet glaze that I would love to replicate. My guy got the fried chicken and left nothing but bones on his plate.  I don't recall what the other guy at my table ordered other than his drink which was the ""double blind"" which turned out to be a 12oz can of Schafer Light and 1oz bottle of Smirnoff vodka; we had a great time laughing about it and then he ordered a Corona. The other gal at the table ordered the turkey pastrami, it was huge and she took half of it to go at the end of the meal.

As important as the food - the service.  I cannot recall the server's name, but he was attentive without being annoying and patient while we waffled over what to order initially.  Drinks were refilled in a timely manner without demand during the meal itself and since it was early and not crowded yet, he was patient without intrusion while we all chatted after the meal.

My party had several appetizers and each one was distinct and delicious. The soft pretzels were actually delectable pretzel rolls served with a warm cheese. The Brussel sprouts were the best I have ever had, and the brussel sprout sauce was even better when sopped up with a soft pretzel. The beets and goat cheese were fantastic as well. 

For an entree I had the turkey sandwich. It was very good, but to be fair, I was so full on appetizers that I could barely concentrate on me entree. 

Other things to note were that the drinks were awesome, and our waiter, Sean I believe was his name, was super attentive and knowledgeable.

My husband and I ate here on July 13th.  We were seated outside, under a mister that was more like  London drizzle than mist.  I ended up soaking wet from the back of my legs to the top of my shirt.

Next, the food.  I the pretzel roll fondue was the highlight and that isn't saying much.  The rolls tasted like store bought, but the fondue was good.  Thus the one star.

I had the fried chicken.  It came out greasy with a biscuit that tasted more like lard and a dash of honey than anything else.  The gravy was not good either.  I ate less than half of the chicken.

My husband had the jambalaya.  It was basically a bowl of rice.  We were warned it was spicy but that was not the case.  The sausage was flavorless and he had ONLY TWO SHRIMP, both of which were mealy and the size of a quarter.  I've had better quality cocktail shrimp at Du-Par's downtown.  Not worth the price.

I woke up later that night with a racing heart, nausea, and clammy skin.  I ended up sick and for the better part of the next day all I tasted was the grease from that chicken.

I started off with the soft pretzels and fondue. That coupled with an IPA that they had on tap (sorry I forgot the name of it) was PERFECT!  Then I had the Fried chicken that came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw and a biscuit.  Again, PERFECT.  Easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life.  Perfectly crispy, yet tender and extremely juicy.

For dessert I had the Salted Caramel custard with popcorn.  Again, this place completely nailed it on everything that I ordered.  

I rarely give out a 5 star review but this place was as close to perfect as you can get (considering where I was and what I was in the mood for at that moment in time).

I'd recommend coming at an off-peak hour as I hear that place can get pretty crowded and have longer wait times to be seated.

We looked over the menu and placed our drink orders. There drinks are a must try. We had the el matador that was made with tequila and my wife had the original drop out. They were both under the mule section but didn't come in copper mugs. Both very tasty and refreshing. 

Pretzel bites w/ fondue - these were very tasty. You get pretzel balls with a side of cheese fondu. Dip the pretzel in that cheese and such a great combination. Just an FYI it's a lot of pretzel so if your a party of 3-4 then this is just right. Any less then 3 it's a lot of food. 

Fried Chicken - the fried chicken looked amazing but something about the seasoning they use on the chicken I was not a fan of. It had like a sweet element to it that I really didn't enjoy. The chicken itself once past the sling was good and juicy. The buttermilk biscuit was ok and there was a side of mash potatoes that were a little to salty and some slaw that was just ok. My wife enjoyed it so give it a try you might too. 

BBQ pork belly nachos - black beans, guacamole, sour cream and Pico de Gallo. On top of some crispy tortilla chips with chunks of pork belly.

We added chicken to the ravioli entree and it was just sliced chicken plopped on top if the pasta and not integrated into the dish in any way.

The food itself fell short too.  My wife and I ordered salads that didn't actually get served with the ingredients listed on the menu.  Her Caesar salad was supposed to include kale and my salad was supposed to include avocado (neither made it our our dishes).  One of the most anticipated parts of the meal was the pretzel/provolone app - unfortunately, the pretzels were overdone.

Big time bummer because I think if outside seating would've been available and the place was properly staffed, we could've overlooked the food shortcomings and had a good time.",Kz3IjwptSLMv1ALZ_ldzPQ,0,0,3,RYJiVzWqUHUNK9ZahgrqEA

[[ Drinks ]]-- ""Room Service"" cocktail = gin, strawberry, lemon juice, and champagne. Not bad... Pretty yum with a sparkling sweetness!

[[ Pork Belly Toast ]]-- recommended by the server and it tasted surprisingly asian. Pork belly wasn't super crisp but rather fatty and thick. Served on a single baguette slice, cut in 3. The sauce was sweet and tangy with maybe bit of soy sauce? Delish!

[[ Shaved Prime Rib Dip ]]-- mmmm!! Super soft bread with a very FULL serving of tender (not dry!) shaved prime rib. It made the sandwich super easy to eat but also fed the appetite all night. I suggest getting the coleslaw with it.

[[ Grilled Cheese Sliders ]]-- How adorbs are these tiny sliced bread as my sliders! Haha comes with 3 sliders. Cheesey cheese and bacony bacon! There's a slice of tomato in each but it didn't do anything for me.

Even though I made a reservation each time (7pm on a Tuesday, 8pm on a Friday), it didn't seem necessary. My guest and I were seated without a wait. The ambience is cool, yet comfortable. It is difficult to identify servers since they do not have a uniform, but they are very attentive. 

On to the food...like all of the previous posters, you will do yourself a disservice if you don't have the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. If you don't use all of the cheese, save it for your meal. My husband dipped his fries in it and also spread it on his perfectly grilled burger. I had the chicken club sandwich. The chicken breast was grilled, tender, and flavorful. With the turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard, it was a perfect combination of flavors and textures. 

I highly recommend saving room for dessert. This was my favorite part of the meals. The monkey bread is baked when you order it, served warm a la mode. Very delicious. However, I think my new favorite is the caramel custard. The very generous portion of the salted caramel custard has a consistency similar to creme brûlée. It is topped with a thick layer of caramel syrup and their own delicious caramel corn. It is decadent and rich, more than enough to share with one or two people.

We decided to check out Culinary Dropout before the show. Overall, the place exceeded me expectation, maybe because I've heard so many mixed reviews. Service was attentive. There was live band going on on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was great. 
 
There were six of us. We ordered table full of stuff and shared. I've tried the following.

1. Pomegranate yuzu mule (1/5): did not enjoy my drink. Wouldn't get it again. 

2. Thai chill chicken wings (4/5): pretty tasty wings. Although I would like it spicier. 

3. Bbq pork belly nachos (5/5): I enjoyed the nachos a lot.

4. Pretzel and provolone fondue (4/5): pretty good combo. Would order it again. 

5. Garden Kale salad (3/5): the flavors was good but bit too salty. Wish they can add quinoa or something to add in the additional texture. 

6. Bistro steak and fries(2/5): did not enjoy the steak. The meat quality was meh. 

7. Rainbow Trout (3/4): decent but not memorable. 

8. The meatloaf (4/5): it was not too bad but not the best meatloaf I've had.

Okay now food here is amazing. Real food! Simple yet delectable spices. I had the ""cheap salad"" with homemade buttermilk ranch, it was refreshing and the dressing was so good I ordered mas. I got the Brussels sprouts- they were served cold and I requested hot. They came out lukewarm but flavor was like grilled heaven. Next day I got the antipasto on happy hour. Best six bucks I've ever spent. The BBQ nuts were more addictive than the slots. The mini platter also came with manchego cheese, olives, shaved ham, and more Brussels sprouts!

About 5 of my buddies and grabbed an early dinner at Culinary Dropout this past weekend. From the hostess to the janitor, everyone in this joint was freaking beautiful. What does this have to do with quality food or service? NOTHING. But its just a fact everyone should know. Boom!

I actually ordered a couple things: Fish N Chips, Grilled Cheese, and The Turkey Pastrami. Without going into details, the Fish N Chips were ridiculously small and the Grilled Cheese was elementary. However, the Turkey Pastrami was incredible. It wasn't as greasy as the usual pastrami and tasty as hell! 

Did I mention the employees? No, besides the fact that they were goddesses, the service was fantastic. I like to ask a waitress how something [that sounds gross] tastes. I wanna test their integrity. I love it when they say, ""Don't order that."" And that they did! I like honesty. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.

4958307,2013-10-16,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"I debated for quite awhile with myself about this review.  The fried chicken is the best I've had in Las Vegas.  It was a 6 star dish.  But, the rest of the meal was not, so that's how I arrive at 4 stars.

We had lunch at Culinary Dropout on a weekday around 1.  It was not crowded, a few tables outside and maybe 4 people at the bar.  So, we sat right down.  Our server came right over for our drinks, but after that, service was a little spotty.  I don't know if she was also working tables outside or doing something in the back, but I feel like we went long periods without even seeing her in the restaurant.  So, that was a little annoying.

To start, we had a charcuterie plate.  This includes a good amount of bread and some jam.  We had a blue, a cheddar, and some Iberico ham.  All of it was fantastic, the ham was, of course, the star.  Soft in texture and almost buttery, it's phenomenal.  

For lunch, as I noted above, I had the fried chicken.  This includes 3 pieces, potatoes, a honey biscuit and gravy.  They drizzle a little honey over the chicken.  Not so much that it overpowers the dish or affects the crispiness of the skin, but enough so you get a little sweet taste with each bite.  This chicken was excellent.  Crispy skin that adhered to the meat, seasoned meat, and the meat remained juicy (even on the white pieces).  It's a steal at $22.  This dish came with a lot of hype, I had heard from many people how fantastic it was, and it delivered.  The potatoes were fine, both they and the gravy needed seasoning.  The biscuit was not as flaky as I like, and it was lukewarm.  So, those items were a little disappointing compared to the chicken.  But, I would certainly order this again knowing that the other parts of the dish were not as good as the chicken.  It's that good.

The wife had the grilled cheese and yesterday's soup, which was tomato bisque.  I don't usually care for tomato soups, but I liked this one.  Hearty and had a lot of seasoning.  Good tomato flavored accentuated by the seasoning.  It was of course excellent when you dip the sandwich into the soup.

Cute and very comfortable decor. We ate inside but the outside patio looked inviting and fun.  Music and crowd was not too loud on a Thursday night so we could actually talk over dinner and watch the game.

We ordered the pretzels and fondue and we were overjoyed with flavor! I think it is their claim to fame! Fried chicken was recommended by Yelpers and waiter - nothing special, would not order again. Meatloaf had no flavor, would not order again either. Bacon Bloody Mary was tasty.

Dinner for two with appetizer and  two drinks was $90 bucks with tip. They had a pretzel special but waiter said it was only for happy hour but as we left the restaurant the special said NFL Game prices so hubby went back in and they adjusted the check.

5022929,2013-08-02,4,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"It was just after 11 AM and the fiancée and I were waiting for our room at the Hard Rock to be readied.  We decided to grab lunch while we waited and made the call to try Culinary Dropout.  Culinary Dropout is a part of a chain of restaurants from Fox Restaurant Concepts primarily in Arizona but across the West.  Culinary Dropout describes itself as a gastropub with ""creative cocktails"" and an ""inked-up"" staff.  It lived up to the description and it was good fit within the Hard Rock.

While we were looking over the menu, we started off with drinks.  I had the Maria Pepino ($10) made with Espolon Blanco tequila, spiced tomato juice, pickled pepper juice and garnished with an olive, pepper, and lime.  It was nicely balanced and spicy.  The pickled pepper juice made for a great accompaniment to the light tequila.  To accompany our food, I ordered the Last Man Standing ($10) made with Old Overholt rye and spiced tomato juice, served with a salt & pepper rim and a dill pickle spear.  Being a big fan of rye whiskey, it was even more satisfying than my first round.  For our meal, we split a pair of appetizers, the Black Mussels ($13) and Grilled Artichokes ($13), and the Korean Style Ribeye Cap entrée ($32).  We received maybe a pound of mussels that were fresh and properly cooked.  They were bathed in a flavorful broth made with spicy sausage of an undetermined type (I assumed chorizo), amber ale, and accompanied by a couple of slices of grilled bread.  It was a satisfying dish.  The grilled artichokes were less successful.  We received a single, small-sized artichoke cut in half, brushed with oil, grilled, seasoned with sea salt and served with lemon aioli.  While the artichoke really had a great grilled flavor, picking up a nice smokiness, from what I'm assuming was from a wood-fired grill, the small size of the head did not withstand the cooking well, drying it out, reducing the already small amount of ""meat"" to be found.  It was overpriced and a disappointment.  Our Korean Style Ribeye Cap (maybe a 6 oz. cut) was cooked perfectly to our requested medium rare and and seemingly topped with a red chili pepper, kimchi-style sauce and pickled vegetables and cilantro.  It was immensely flavorful.  Therein lies the conceptual problem with the dish.  The ribeye cap is nicknamed ""Butcher's Butter"" and is touted to be the tastiest cut of beef.  Sadly, the bold sauce covered up the meaty goodness of a cut that probably should've been left unadorned.  I liken the use of ribeye cap in this dish to that of making hamburgers with A5 kobe beef...a waste of a great piece of meat.  A different, less expensive, cut of meat should've been used for this otherwise tasty dish, which could've dropped the price by $7-10.

In the end, Culinary Dropout got its GED (Good Enough Dining).  Service was a strength as it was friendly, attentive, and really made us feel like welcomed guests.  Its cocktails were well conceived, well made, and a solid value.  The food, however, while flavorful, suffered from questionable decision making on how dishes were prepared and from pricing that did not offer a lot of bang for the buck.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,3,3,yl7t_-s5KuSpdSKbhxuORQ

Based on my friends recommendation we ordered the pork nachos, the hummus, and the grilled cheese sliders. Honestly for the price it's a good amount of food that you get. The pork nachos are probably the best nachos I've ever had! The pork is so delicious in them and I'm not really a pork person usually. The only thing that I would change is to use real cheese instead of nacho cheese but most people prefer nacho cheese on nachos anyway

My friend ordered a garlic bread starter which was so delicious I was surprised how good bread could be LOL it definitely wasn't even that expensive maybe four or five dollars. The hummus was delicious too, as was the grilled cheese sliders which came with bacon and tomato plus fries!

Only complaint really was that the service was not the best. It was warped tour so it was a little busy but we sat at the bar and the bartender didn't tell us until we tried to get her attention that there were still people sitting there. So we moved farther down the bar where there was more space and she didn't get to us for probably around 15 minutes. The service wasn't that fantastic but being a server I understand that sometimes there are factors that I don't know about. She seem to be the only bartender at the time so I can't hold that against her too much.",1DLvCQ0vQ87BPp3iqYgRZQ,4,2,5,OvZ2A5LFTona1FZvOgIECw
5042185,2013-05-13,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"This new place opened up recently with some good hype attached.  My friends and I decided to check this place out before the Prince concert at the Joint.  I'm certainly glad I did!

When you check into the hostess stand, you think this place is pretty small.  Don't be fooled by that.  It's HUGE inside.  A lot of seating inside and outside as well.  Huge bar area extending outside as well.  The outside area has a bunch of lounge tables.  Our table was half chairs and half booth.  Accommodated all people of my party.  Our server was nice, seemed a bit flustered as we did have a lot of questions and most of our drink requests were ""out of stock"" which didn't make too much sense.  

Their menu is not too pricey.  Things go for $15-$30 depending on what you want.  On top of that, they have an AWESOME secret menu given out on concert days.  Since the Prince concert was there, they offered it to us!  Super fast and easy, it's only $25 dollars and comes with 3 main components:  starter salad OR soft pretzel, meatloaf OR fried chicken and a bag beer.  GREAT DEAL, by the way.  I chose the salad which was light a refreshing.  Spring mix with balsamic vinaigrette.  For the main course I got the fried chicken.  You get various dark and white meat pieces.  They gave a ton of that!  It was accompanied with mashed potatoes and gravy, sauteed green beans and a biscuit.  The chicken was super juicy and crispy on the outside!  The gravy really made the mashed potatoes, which were also very creamy.  The beans were sauteed with bacon and had a nice, light salty taste.  The biscuit also was dense and flaky with creamy butter.  SOOOOO GOOD!!  The beer was a low end beer, always different.  I got the Milwaukee's best.  The thing that enhances the experience is the paper bag it comes in.  Super creative for higher end restaurant.  Shows the lighter side of ""Las Vegas strip"" type restaurant.  I REALLY liked that :)

Definitely will be back for another try.  I would like to try their fish and chips, Korean style ribeye cap and salmon.  So many yummy toppings!

It's not necessarily the opposite, but it's definitely an upper-scale version of what a good dinner restaurant should be. 

We came here with no expectations and left with full stomachs and smiles on our faces. We had the grilled artichoke (which had a great dipping sauce), cheese and prosciutto (plenty to share) for appetizers, and my friend got the Bistro Steak (on the small side but still filling) and I got the Jambalaya (spicy and full of sausage and seafood). 

We capped it off with a Monkey Bite, which is essentially a cinnamon roll crammed into a bed of baked apple and served with a scoop of ice cream. It was amazing. And delicious. And it was probably what put the restaurant over the top when it came to the food. 

Our server was attentive and didn't make things awkward. We didn't feel like we were being checked on every 2 minutes. 

Something to note is that the employees here don't have a uniform - they're free to dress in whatever way makes them feel comfortable. We used this as a conversation starter and learned a lot about our waiter.

The service was great; our waiter was really cool about re-cooking the burgers and was very attentive to our needs. It's a little bit on the pricey side, $15 for a burger is high in my opinion. It's a great place if you are looking for bar food and convenience if you are staying at Hard Rock hotel.",DpbAb_5lhGff_lzPAXRhFA,0,0,3,p4o5TZjGnFvkrDN6LHRP7w
5141735,2013-07-01,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Been hearing good things about CD recently so I finally stopped in with a group of people for dinner.  Apparently, several in the group hadn't heard of CD and were putting me under the gun for my recommendation...in the end everyone gave me props.

We started with some antipasti which was all very good and if that's your thing I would recommend giving a meat, a cheese, olives, and tomatoes a whirl.  But at the very least, get yourself some of the 'crusty bread and good olive oil'  The bread was awesome and the olive oil was even better, I'd get it every time.

So many of the items on the menu sound good it was tough to decide.  The overwhelming favorite order was the Turkey Pastrami...how can you go wrong with a pretzel bun?  I was fortunate enough to convince a friend to go halfsies on the Turkey Pastrami and the Shaved Prime Rib dip.  We both agree the dip was phenom and the better of the two choice.

They have a pretty solid selection of beers and actually offer a cool deal where for $2.95 you can get a cheap as hell beer in a brown bag.  The beer was sort of a mystery and I think it changes every so often...it would even be better if it changed order to order.  This go around it was a 'Buck Range Light'.  I had never heard of it but someone at the table had.

The waiter mentioned they have some nice specials certain nights.  I think on some Sunday's they do $3 Jameson drinks and $1 oysters if you're into that.

The only thing keeping Culinary Dropout from a 5 star rating (in my opinion...obviously) are the portions.  For the prices we paid for a sandwich, I thought they could have been a little bigger.  The shave prime rib dip was amazing, but the given the size i could have had 1.5-2 easily.  For an $18 sandwich I'd hope to at least have to put up a fight to finish or feel full afterwards.  That's my only warning, otherwise, it's a pretty cool and delicious place to grab a meal.  They even feature outdoor seating for days when it isn't 115 degrees.",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,2,0,4,TViI14x9RAGuiEriegL4Yg

Took the time to explain everything and gave refills or anything we needed in a timely manner. So the service was golden for that it would be five stars.
 He suggested the pretzels with fondue, carbs are my enemy so we said no... which we regretted later as everyone else ordered them and they looked really good. 
ordered: ( We mixed it up and shared so we can check it all out)
Side salad , tasted a little funny to me, it was ok.
Chicken noodle soup, had an Asian flair to it. Very unique and not too salty.
Fried Chicken comes with mashed, Cole slaw, biscuit . Chicken was super tender.
Steak with brussels sprouts potato and mushrooms. The brussels sprouts were so good we ordered extra~!
 Didn't have room or time for dessert.
A 4 star because soup and or salad should have been included in the price for dinner... But hey I am cheap...;)

5210221,2014-05-03,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Culinary Dropout has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food at the Hard Rock has always been a bit lacking to be honest, with the exception of Nobu. But now with Culinary Dropout, they have one of the best casual dining experiences on the Strip.

I'm not exaggerating when I say after 6 visits, I've yet to find a bad thing on the menu. I'll say my favorites are the Shaved Prime Rib Dip, the Fried Chicken and the 36 Hour Pork Ribs. The pretzel fondue is great, but I prefer the mussels, which are the best I've had anywhere. The Monkey Bread makes a great desert, but I'm especially fond of the carmel corn custard. It's really rich, but really, really excellent.

The service is fantastic. The staff is friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The decor is very cool and casual. It really feels like a place you enjoy hanging out.

They have music on Thursdays of Fridays. I haven't experienced it yet, but it looks like it would be a good time.

We stumbled upon Culinary Dropout.  The place looks really cool, and as we walked in we could hear live jazz music playing.  As we walked into the dimly lit restaurant, we could see that there were plenty of tables, inside and out, and there was a cute little oyster bar on one side.  Although there were a ton of open tables closer to the action (music, bar, etc), we were seated in a back corner by another entrance.  It was dark in there, we couldn't tell who the servers were, and it took a while before anyone approached us for drink orders.  I tried to remain calm, since I was starting to get hangry.  
Finally a friendly young gentleman approached our table and took our drink orders.  Overall, everything was pretty slow here.  Our drinks took a while to come out, it took a while to give our server the food orders, and it took a long while for our food to finally come out.  It was a little disconcerting, since it wasn't busy in the restaurant at all.  I usually give free passes when the place is swarming with people and the servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  

On to the food, I had the Prime Rib Dip.  It was ok, nothing mind-blowing.  The meat was tender, but tasted slightly over-seasoned, and the au jus was bland.  Weird combination, but I guess it balanced itself out.  My friend had the steamed mussels, and those were actually very good.  The flavor was really good, and the broth was sweet.  It was also a very nice portion.  I also got to try my boyfriend's entrée, he had the meatloaf.  It looked like homemade meatloaf covered in ketchup or some kind of red sauce.  It was a bit on the dry side, but the sauce helped.  

Overall, the food wasn't anything memorable and I probably wouldn't go out of my way the next time I'm in Vegas to eat here.  It was convenient, since we were staying in the hotel, but by no means was it a quick meal.",kNbngGqDVQddsKWDc5AIRQ,2,2,3,FUqlJbMcJLx3mLiHpYb-dQ

Now there is. 
Dropout has a really innovative menu, with lots of delicious and creative choices and preparations. They opened about a month ago, and since I work conveniently nearby, we have eaten there at least half a dozen times so far. 
Highlights include the raw bar, the antipasti menu, and the indoor/outdoor seating.
Well done HRH.
The only downsides so far has been the live acoustic music, which is hit or miss and always way too loud. (Hint: sit outside to avoid this)

Arriving at The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in the midst of Rehab with my mother and aunt in tow as Springsteen played overhead one can only call the scene en route to brunch part of the show, a five minute walk from Paradise parking to Fox Concepts' ""Culinary Dropout"" bespecked with the scantily clad and already drunken while the restaurant itself proved a comparative sea of tranquility matched to good food and unexpectedly stunning service.  Sprawling in size with garage-style doors open to the cool morning breeze of a picturesque patio it was close to the rounded bar with a full view of both stage and kitchen that our trio found itself located mere moments after entry and with coffee kept brimming from seating to finale a six-piece order was crafted, each item arriving individually with smooth pacing and beautiful presentation.  Largely focusing on signatures but equally willing to explore seasonal preps and brunch-only items it was with the restaurant's oft raved pretzel bites that the meal began and with rich fondue gilding golden soft nuggets we all agreed that rare has a pretzel impressed so much, a similar praise heaped on the house burrata with seasonal accoutrements drizzled with aged balsamic.  Moving next to things more substantial it was admittedly with some disappointment that neither the $11 French Toast nor the $21 'worth the wait' fried chicken proved nearly as memorable as their respective milk jam or biscuit plate-mates, but with the former too bready and the later far from crispy there are simply better versions to be found elsewhere, particularly at such a cost.  At this point sated but certainly not full, the kitchen would quickly rally back with a duo of desserts and while the piping hot monkey bread certainly deserves the attention it has garnered it was the caramel-corn studded budino that stole the show for me, a dense pudding both salty and sweet with crunch and cream taken perfectly with another cup of coffee as Chris Cornell crooned overhead.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,2,3,ohep0cNzkAUo6Vr_95LO4w

Not a good sign, but based on the high Yelp reviews, we assumed it was just a slow night. 

We started off with the Soft Pretzels with provolone fondue. When it arrived we immediately had to send it back because the cheese was cold. When it came back it was lukewarm and still didn't have too much flavor. For my main entree I had the Pork Belly Ramen which was also disappointing.

5373248,2012-10-16,4,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Culinary Dropout is another gastropub that has infiltrated Las Vegas. British and Irish food tends to be heavy and tend to pair well with beers. Dare I say that CD does not match any preconceived connotations, but instead take it to a new level. 

I had ordered the Fish 'n Chips ($19) and it was worth the casino price. With two other English Pubs nearby, I prefer this version. The cod has a lighter batter which is spiked with heat. Although the setting is dark, the crispy exterior looked to be tinted in red. A taste of Tabasco laces the shell and lends an enjoyable characteristic profile. The side of coleslaw was also unique with a hint of citrus. I finished that first. 

As for desserts, it should not be passed upon. The peanut butter chocolate pie is better than the traditional banoffee pie. This declaration is not meant to undermine the deliciousness of the latter. I could devour a whole pie of either, but the chocolate version will always be first choice. 

The casual nature of the establishment makes me like it more. The dark tones and rich decor had me lounging in the banquette. I am also rather jealous of the staff.

The sandwich tasted really good but the fried potato chips were cold when served and they are made on-site.  My wife's fried chicken was served burned and everything was lukewarm--chicken and the mashed potatoes.  We complained and (maybe the manager?) an employee apologized profusely and had another chicken plate made immediately.  The second fried chicken plate was a little better--at least it was served hot but we then discovered the real reason the chicken wasn't good is the oil in the fryer must be really old because even though it wasn't burned, the skin was really really dark and had that old oil taste/smell.  We removed the skin and the chicken itself was good.  At least we didn't have to pay for the Fried Chicken dish--thanks to the employee.

By this time I'm starving, time feels like it's flying by. We had plans to eat at a particular place but that fell through so Yelp came in handy once again. Let's eat at Culinary Dropout, we're going to the Hard Rock so it's convenient, I made a reservation just in case. 
So we got there about 7:30 and the place was busy but suprised to see alot of open tables (probably because it's such a big space). Seated by the kitchen, I got to watch the action. Everyone of the staff were working their butt off but it looked smooth and cohesive at the same time. 
Now I grew up eating pierogi, when bought costing about 50 cents a piece. I can't believe I spent 11$ on 3 pierogi!

5384303,2015-03-14,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"We made two stops here during our stay at they Hard Rock. A late night dinner and a quick lunch on departure day. Here is a summary of our choices.

1) House Made Burratta - Pears, Walnuts, Balsamic, Grilled Bread

2) Roasted Salmon with Creamy Barley, Poached Artichokes, Grilled Asparagus, Mushrooms, Preserved Lemon, Chile Vinaigrette.

3) Fried Chicken - Honey Biscuit, Potatoes, Gravy.

4) Chicken Meatballs - Buffalo Sauce, Dolce Gorgonzola, Celery Leaf.

5) Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue.

I have listed the items from our most to least favorites. The Burratta was so good we ordered it on both visits. The Salmon and Fried Chicken were Solid entrees, worthy of consideration on future visits.

The Meatballs were hot, that's it, just hot. We did not taste any of the Vinegar or Butter that usually adds balance to a Buffalo Sauce. There wasn't enough Gorgonzola or Celery Leaf to cut the heat either.
 
The Pretzels did not live up to the hype I've seen on Yelp and other sights. The Pretzels themselves were Doughy and tasted more like Dinner Rolls than Pretzels and an unpleasant skin had formed on the Fondue. 

I also had a Cocktail called, Velvet Death which featured Gin, Absinthe, Velvet Falernum and Cointreau. It was appropriately named, smooth, but amazingly strong! One was enough to give me quite a buzz!

Service was fine and they are easily Wheelchair Accessible.  Culinary Dropout had both highs and lows, but the highs mean I'll probably give it another shot the next time we stay at The Hard Rock.",e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,5,2,3,KEotvFlYwroQvPPBTSSUvQ

The beer selection is pretty good, featuring local brewery Joseph James even.  We started with a dozen oysters from their Raw Bar, which didn't last long with our group.  I don't know what I expected, but their oysters weren't good, they were great.  I ordered the Chicken Curry with potato, green beans, peanuts, mushrooms, lime & cilantro.

5390444,2012-09-16,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"I've never been a huge fan of the Hard Rock's dining options in the past.  I don't necessarily dislike any of them, but other than Nobu none of them have ever struck a chord with me and made me want to do several repeat visits or instilled any sort of cravings deep within, and I can't really afford to blow half a paycheck on sushi on a whim so half the time I end up down the street at Firefly before a concert.  

In planning to see Fiona Apple last night I was excited to try Culinary Dropout from it's positive reviews and creative menu.  Upon arrival I stupidly hadn't thought to make reservations and there was a 45 minute wait.   The hostesses were kind enough to let us know that bar seating was available and we had a seat long these long wooden tables with stools.  I found them comfortable as far as stools go (I typically prefer backs and armrests on chairs #chairsnob), my dining partner that evening found them uncomfortable as the feet rests near the bottom of the stool were set too low for her shorter legs.  The pains of being less than 6 feet tall I guess.  

We started by ordering some small plates of cured olives and grilled asparagus, as well as some jack and cokes (though some of the custom made cocktails sounded delicious, I'm generally opposed to spending $12 per drink unless it's a last resort or I'm only planning on having 1 or 2, which is pretty much never).   The olives were as expected, and the grilled asparagus which was served chilled with sea salt were very tasty and worth the $4.  Our first order of jack and cokes arrived with what seemed like nearly flat coke.  I'm not one for complaining unless something is egregious so we sucked them up literally and figuratively and let the waitress know for our second order and she very nicely and graciously went to the 2nd bar area for the next round and they were fine (and strong!)  

For entrees I tried the Pork Cubano sandwich which comes with a side of fries.  My companion ordered the Bistro steak.  Upon arrival I was a little disappointed in the look of both meals.  The steak was quite possibly the smallest steak I'd ever seen on a plate, though to be fair my companion was fine with the size and didn't even finish it (note:  women.  smh) The cuban was on some sort of regular sliced bread and not on a roll of cuban bread as I expected.  That chapter on cubans must have been after the drop date.  The usage of pork belly instead of a typical sliced ham was interesting, and the flavor of the meat itself and the melted swiss was good, but I did expect more out of it upon ordering.   I thought the pickles were too much on the sweet side and I prefer a more sour pickle with a cuban.  The fries were pretty standard, and the sea salt helped those out tremendously (as sea salt tends to do).  Naturally I cleaned my plate despite any flaws, so it wasn't bad, just slightly disappointing.

On an extremely positive note, our server (Dominique?  That's what the receipt says for Cashier) was fantastic.  Eager to explain the menu, checked on us throughout the meal and was efficient throughout.  

Next time I'd definitely try the Pretzel Bites and a specialty cocktail (or 3), but for now the Hard Rock dining legacy continues for me.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,0,0,3,iXO3w9Sozm97cn3pWcLG2w

The final course. The most important course: #dessert. The s'mores, which were my choice, was a delectable blend of chocolate mouse and creamy, creamy, cloudlike marshmallows. With homemade graham crackers for that authentic crunch. The banana cream pie was silky in nature, drizzled with a creamy caramel on the bottom, and topped with delectable cinnamon whipped cream.

Now, time to stand on my soap box, if you are going to do basic food, but charge a non basic price, it better be good food, sadly, Jack in the Box makes a better chicken club, then they DON'T pile an ice cold bunch of ham on top of the piece of chicken, which in this case came from a small chicken, not good.

First, let's start with the pretzels and fondue. No, really, you HAVE to start with the pretzels and fondue. If you set foot in here and you don't get the pretzels and fondue, you are messing up. The pretzels are literally the best I've ever eaten - soft, airy and pillow-light.

Another essential bar bite on the menu is the chips and French onion dip, freshly made and delicious.

As for the entrees, I've stuck to the sandwiches and burgers for the most part, and I've never been disappointed. The shaved French rib dip on a soft brioche roll is exceptional. The turkey pastrami is zesty, flavorful and balanced (although the pretzel roll, while delicious, may be redundant if you've had the pretzels as a starter.)

Besides the regular menu, Culinary Dropout occasionally features beer tasting dinners. We attended one that paired a five-course menu with beers from local brewer Joseph James, who had representatives dining with us and explaining the brewing process behind each of their varieties. Seeing what Culinary Dropout's chefs can do with a little creative freedom cemented this as one of our favorite restaurants in all of Vegas.

Patio seating, along the Hard Rock pool, is amazing if the weather permits and the pool isn't full of d-bags.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,5,v5fWxCVTh83awcWqGNUBvQ

We had been at the Hard Rock for a concert, and afterwards were feeling a little bit hungry and up for a drink. We walked past several restaurants before the smell of juicy burgers drew us to this one. The sign outside mentioned specials on drafts and we could see that they had an outdoor patio so we decided to try it out.

The patio was absolutely the best feature of this place! Big wing back chairs, fire pits, couch seating, white lighting, etc. Beautiful and so inviting! They had a live musician up on stange playing guitar and singing, he was really talented and was taking requests, it was a nice addition to the atmosphere.

We weren't hungry enough to order a whole meal because we'd eaten at a buffet earlier in the day so we ordered draft beers ($3.50 special) and their specialty - the soft pretzels with provolone fondue ($12). TO DIE FOR!

We first tried the Burrata, a cream infuse mozzarella with persimmon, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, and grilled croutons. As if fresh mozzarella isn't creamy enough, this just melted in your mouth. The roasted hazelnuts and crispy brussels sprouts leaves brought a delightful texture to the party in my mouth.  Our second appetizer was their infamous  soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  Delicious is an understatement.  The pretzel knobs were soft and airy on the inside, with a soft, chewy, shimmery outside. And the fondue...OH THE FONDUE... The provolone fondue to the pretzel is like a micro fleece blanket and a wood fire to you and I.  Let's just say I'm on a mission to replicate the recipe.  For entree's, we ordered the goulash and jambalaya.  Sounds ordinary, but Culinary Dropout took it to the extraordinary.  The spices were BAM! spot on.  The portions, well worth it.  Who knew leftover jambalaya would be so good for breakfast?!  I do now. We ended the meal sharing the chocolate and peanut brittle tart, a rich chocolate gonosh in a flaky crust sprinkled with peanut brittle.  Delicious.

When we arrived at 5pm, the place was mostly empty, which was fine. The hostess was Very Friendly and Talkitive. The inside was nice, a little funky and casual. Our waiter arrived shortly after and took drink orders. I was a bit suprised at how laid back he was, i knew from reading reviews that staff wore street clothes, however it took me byu suprise when out waiter pulled up a chat to take take our order. He was friendly and asnwered the million questions i had. We had crusty bread for an app., it was great (i love bread) The drinks we ordered were AMAZING, The service was quick and our food arrived hot. I got the pub burger, which was one of the best burgers I have ever had. My husband got the meatloaf, which was pink on the inside, really pink. He ended up sending it back, the manager came over to our table and explained it was cooked, it looked pink because of the way it was cooked but they were making a new meat loaf for my husband, He was very friendly and professional. Once the meat loaf came out it was done perfect. We decided that we were going to have dessert and otdered the monkey bread, our waiter let us know its made fresh so it will 8-10 mins. Between the time we waited for the meatloaf and when we ordered dessert, they got busy, which put them a bit behind. So after 15 mins of waiting for our dessert (whioch it didnt seems that long, we were having a nice time talking and having a drink) the manager comes over to the table, and lets us know he has good news and bad news, the bad news is our monkeybread is going to take another 8 mins but in the mean time they are going to comp us andother dessert for free and sets down the salted carmel pudding with house made carmel corn. It was wonderful, the best pudding i have ever had. Once out monkey bread arrives our waiter lets us know that is on the house as well, i treid telling it was fine we were more than happy to pay for it but he wouldnt add it to the bill.

Culinary Dropout was our first stop in Vegas when we arrived.  We were hungry, thirsty and needed to start partying after our flight from Orange County. We arrived in Las Vegas at 9 PM, so we were lucky enough to miss the dinner crowd, but I had reservations regardless (which I booked through Opentable.com).

The restaurant wasn't very crowded, but the people who were there seemed to be enjoying their time drinking and laughing.  Our server was very sweet, accomodating and was on top of our orders.  I wish I could remember her name, I'd like to say thank you for getting our weekend off to a great start with her great service.

The ambiance is super laid back, casual and teetering on the hipster side.  I can see it working for a party with friends, or a romantic date.  

We decided to order apps instead of meals so we have a little more room for alcohol (ha!).  We ordered the artichoke hearts, pretzel fondue (that everyone on Yelp is raving about), and a charcuterie of Iberico ham and manchego cheese.

Artichoke hearts:  tender, with a slightly smoke flavor.  It had this cheesy cream that went well with it, topped with baby spinach.  They also drizzled it with an orange marmalade which I personally didn't care for.  I like orange marmalade on toast, but not on my artichoke hearts.  

Pretzel fondue:  Everyone was raving about this here on Yelp.  I found it too salty for my liking.  There was almost too much salt on the pretzels and the fondue (served in a cute little pot and tealight warmer) had a slightly gritty texture, and that was salty too, reminded me of Cheez Whiz out of a jar.  Maybe they made it salty on purpose because we were pounding beer after beer to wash it down.

Now for the BEST part of our meal, the Iberico ham: O.M.EFFING.G. Talk about melt in your mouth awesome goodness.  It was like butter, no gaminess, with a slightly sweet note in the back.  It went well with the slightly salty bitterness of the manchego cheese.  They served it with a cherry compote on the side and two pieces of crostini bread and made a fancy little ham and cheese sandwich.  Mind you, they gave us maybe half a cup of thin ham shavings at MP $19.

Bottom line, would I come back here?  Probably not.

With all the various and unique dining experiences Vegas has to offer, I don't think Culinary Dropout is memorable enough for me to take time out of my precious vacation to venture back here.  At least I can say that I gave it a shot, and that I actually finally got to taste Iberico ham.",XcbywuCi8zC24j7O6rdeVA,14,13,3,JNe9wzib7gxrcDQqQVnSvA
5658833,2012-10-13,7,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"This place was a joke.  Talk about trying way to hard to be what some 55 year old guy in Scottsdale thinks is ""cool"" these days...

This is Urban Outfitters in restaurant form, which might be forgivable if the food was any good or the menu cohesive.  For a ""gastropub"", the beer list was pretty pedestrian and the beer menu was inanely laid out.  The menu was all about clever, pseudo-hipster layout and not at all about conveying information about the beers.  On tap they have Lagunitas, but which Lagunitas?  They make several different brews.

The food was again trying way too hard to be trendy.  Unfortunately the gastropub trend jumped the shark 5 years ago, as evidenced by this pre-packaged chain restaurant.  In fact I think that this incarnation of a gastropub, cooked up by some restaurant company in that culinary mecca (and launching pad of a dozen chain restaurant monstrosities) of Scottsdale, AZ, may be the ultimate and final indicator of the gastropub shark jump.

The douchey beats from the pool outside pound through the restaurant and are beyond annoying.  The pretzels were stale and the cheese sauce they came with was grainy with too much flour in the bechamel.  The chicken curry was laughably bland with a couple of strands of dried up chicken breast and no rice (i took this one to go.)

This place is so derivative and contrived.  Simon Kitchen, First Food, and Society are already doing the comfort-retro food much better and don't need to package their menus in some goofy, obvious appeal to a specific demographic (except for First, which is itself an overly-conceived douchatoreum, but with slightly better food than CD).

The funny thing is that they are obviously trying to appeal to Brooklyn-hipster types, the exact people who wouldn't be caught dead in the HRH, let alone this charicature of a restaurant.

I have to say, I was impressed at how smoothly everything seemed to be running.  I didn't get to see the entire restaurant, but what I did see was really cool.  I sat at the 1st bar when you walk in the place.  The stool was really uncomfortable - there needs to be a footrest ON the stool, not just under the counter.  The server/bartenders who assisted me were very friendly and seemed genuinely excited about the products they were serving.  They have a good beer selection, something that is just now starting to happen more often in Vegas.  The bartender told  me that it is very important to them, the company started in PHX, who has a great beer scene.  The drink prices were a little high, but that is to be expected for the location.  I had the ""cheap house salad"" and the pretzels with fondue.  Both only took a few minutes before they were delivered.  And both were really delicious.  The salad comes standard with ranch dressing, and was tossed perfectly (not too much or too little dressing).  There were tomatoes and onions chopped up in it, along with some other stuff.  Now, the pretzels were AMAZING and totally worth comnig back for.  I don't know how they do it, but the cheese fondue that is served with them is absolutely orgasmic.  The pretzels are great for sharing, and are served in a paper lined dish.  The fondue comes in a small, individual pot with a candle underneath.  They were seriously SO good.

The menu is really diverse and there are so many different areas of the place, I think that there is something for everyone.  There is also a patio that looks down into the pool, so there is definitely some good people watching to be had here.  :)  I can't wait to go back and try some of their entress (and of course get more pretzels).

We were starving and got 2 appetizers that came out very quickly. The Pretzel bites were yummy, but the portion was way too large for 2 people. It's too bad they don't have 2 sizes & prices to choose from. Their profit margin on this item is crazy. Anyway, the Deviled eggs were the highlight of the whole meal since it was made with truffle oil. If you add that to anything, I guess it would be delicious in my opinion. ;)

Anyway, we decided to try the Ribs as an entree since the description was so enticing as well as Ben recommended it. Being from the South, we definitely had very high expectations. Unfortunately, instead of being marinated for 36 hours in a great sauce, it tasted like a it was locked in the Salt Mines for days. I had 1 rib and couldn't eat anymore cause it required a glass of water to cure my thirst after that bite. It was really disappointing. I would have thought that they would have taken it off the bill and the manager came by, but was so awkward and didn't even acknowledge anything. 

The dinner started off so good and ended so strangely. It is a ""hip/trendy"" place and maybe we'll come back, but it could just be for drinks/patio in the future. Let's see. Hopefully, it gets better as the comments come rolling in.",wn7XHrrdb1rxUC_eoFCJtw,1,0,3,AUahRjHBG3GzFNVl3L6jkQ

The coup de grace here is the pretzels and fondue. It was absolutely amazing and I think I could eat it every day. Perfect bites of pretzels along with blazing hot cheese fondue. There is just nothing wrong to say about it.

5837864,2013-03-27,11,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"It was still Restaurant Week, and my long-anticipated introduction to Culinary Dropout was about to occur.  After it was all over, I was pleasantly pleased by all I saw and ate.  Amid the fitting sounds of hard rock, the decor of the restaurant is very casual, but seating on a banquette and upholstered chair was comfortable, and servers were very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  A request for a different salad dressing was immediately granted.

I began with Yesterday's Soup, which changes by the day.  To my relief, this was not like the leftovers of a college cafeteria's previous day's rejected offerings ground up and mixed with broth.  Ginger Soup was on tap on my dining day.  And, this colorful soup literally took my breath away.  I figured out why when I found out from my server that it contained Cilantro Jalapeno Pepper Sauce.  The soup was not very hot but quite spicy, but soon I got used to it and found the distinct taste of ginger to be intriguing.

Next up was a House Salad with many mixed greens and a generous supply of good Sherry Vinaigrette Dressing.

For my entree, I selected Ma . . . The Meatloaf!?!  Why it is so named I have no idea.  But this was great, very hot meatloaf with a ketchup coating accompanied by really fresh French Style Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes with Brown Gravy.  I also tried the Coleslaw, which was non-creamy and slightly sweet, while Diane enjoyed somewhat odd-looking dark brown but quite tasty and well-made Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Honey Biscuits.

For dessert we had a Chocolate Toffee Tart and Salted Caramel Custard with homemade Caramel Popcorn on top.  Both were excellent, including the sweet popcorn.

It was fun to face and watch the chefs at work in the very open kitchen.  When we left, we were very full from the large portions.  Because the menu lists so many intriguing items that I want to try, including oysters and white shrimp by the piece, we will most definitely return fairly soon for additional meals--and will continue to do so if Diane keeps up her winning streak at the Hard Rock's slot machines and draws additional player's coupons for 2 for 1 entrees at Fu!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,12,12,4,t1-B5HYJJZFqvOPnTo3kGg

My second meal there were the bomb-ass THAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS ($12 cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, lime).  The wings were heavily slathered but what they were bathing in was the most interesting concoction of lime and sesame, very intense and very tasty.

We sat towards the back at a giant table that fit all the foods. We went big ordered the fondue and pretzels, pierogis, and the smoked salmon. All of the above dishes were super rich and decadent.

First of all, the meats/cheese board is ridiculously overpriced. We ordered a few different types of  cheese and meat ($7 each, $5 each) and the portions were incredibly tiny. I asked the waiter ""Is this it?"" and come to find out, each portion is only 1.5 oz. You gotta be kidding me !! $5 or $7 dollars for 1.5 oz of meat or cheese is just ridiculous. I get that this is Vegas, but the meat/cheese wasn't special at all.

Second, the sandwich (Chicken Club) was good, but nothing to write home about. $14 dollars is fairly comparable to what I would pay at home, so I have no complaints about price on that.

The best thing was the pretzel and cheese dip. I would come back just for that dip plus a drink.

5918019,2017-04-27,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Everything was going good at first.... came here for happy hour with a group of 5. Happy hour is from 3-6 and they have a pretty good selection! Our group decided to get the pretzels with cheese considering its national pretzel day... but with a larger group we didn't know if more people ordered more than one pretzels. So the food runner brought out two, okay seems normal. Halfway through us eating our pretzels the foreign bartender comes up to us and takes our other pretzels that we have already been eating out of, AND DIPPING OUR PRETZELS in the cheese. He said that we only ordered one pretzel. Okay, so that's fine if we ordered one pretzel....... but he gave our already eaten pretzels and cheese to another guest!!! I've worked in the food industry my whole time in Vegas and that is absolutely disgusting. I understand if we got two food orders and he took it away and threw it away, but he gave our already eaten food to another guest that had no idea it's already been touched. I'm absolutely flabbergasted and it scares me because that can happen to anyone that isn't paying attention. Definitely will not be returning.",xRZBVvCJy8LOefuwgb99Rg,0,1,1,xUjqU-QBcoWjJaD-BHqJyg
5927583,2016-07-03,1,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Went here for a Sunday breakfast. Great service from hostess and waiter, great patio looking out to pool. Food was just so so unfortunately. 

Had the breakfast burrito and the French toast. 

Breakfast burrito was decent sized and came with breakfast potatoes. Burrito itself reminded me of the microwave breakfast burritos you get in gas stations. Edible, does the job but not good. Potatoes were good. 

French toast was good if not too sweet. Captain crunch coating added a good texture, served with raspberries. Good item if you are ok with the sweetness. 

Pros: service and ambiance 
Cons: breakfast food (maybe their lunch and dinner is better)",6eDshPJmQZJrvG-aLubi2Q,0,0,3,ntJDcTbX67JiT7rLoy0dCQ
5931031,2014-01-06,2,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"Mmmmmm. This place is delish. 
First of all, walking in. The atmosphere is awesome. Dark with a young, hip feeling. The staff has no uniforms, which is cool. Everyone has their own style. The decor is also cool. The chairs and plates are all mismatched but go together. Red, black and white plates are stacked by the kitchen. 

Now- the food. 
We got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Let me just say: to DIE for. Seriously. I could probably just eat that as a meal. Pretzels are big and soft nuggets with just enough salt. The cheese fondue is perfecttttt. 
I got a crispy shrimp Caesar salad. Pretty good, but then again, I've never had any sort of Caesar salad I didn't like.
My boyfriend got the prime rib sandwich I think it was? Some sort of steak and cheese. The bread was nice and soft, not all hard and crusty like most rolls I've had/seen. Meat was tender and the cheese was good. I had one fry, wasn't impressed. 

All in all, I loved it all. The service was good. Atmosphere was nice. Good was good. I'll definitely be back, even if only for the pretzels and cheese.",NqzaEG63NbJr2TagJ5910Q,3,3,4,CUZZrhN_H5eB6xHjokq6bw
5931204,2017-05-04,0,SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"I read the yelp reviews on Culinary Dropout and based on the reviews I gave this place a shot. I thought it was just alright. I got the fried chicken dish and it wasn't bad my any means but it wasn't amazing either. The sides were pretty bland (mashed potatoes and green beans). The fried chicken itself was better than the sides, but again nothing to write home about. Since I went on a Thursday night around 6 (early dinner for Vegas) the restaurant was pretty empty and the service was average (after the order was placed and the food came out and we were done eating it took awhile to round up the bill). Probably wouldn't come back since there are soooooooo many other places I want to try in Las Vegas and overall it is mediocre at best in my opinion. Also they don't have a bathroom in the restaurant so if you need to relieve yourself you have to walk out of the restaurant and through the casino to find the bathroom!",KbNHbtWJyLWrIMu7OWSBcQ,0,0,3,un3mJfP30Vy6a5_Op8xT7A

But looking at the bartenders from my seat the guys looked dress for the part . the girls looked to causal one with long dark straight hair touched her hair like 8 times with out washing her hands and ate something with out washing her hands again their was like ten health code violations . so i just dont like places that arent watching their staff because they atre the people taking care of us,I9ij14zrH2KmmUrm9Vnjhg,2,0,1,fLdh48sYGvRvGLSjhCTObA

Perfect for groups - big, open space, well lit, huge bar and outside games. It's built for socializing. There's a bit of noise from the pool but this isn't the place to go for a quiet meal. 

Food, drink and service were all excellent! Our waitress, Lorna, has a great attitude and enjoys coming to work. It showed with her service. We ordered all the right things thanks to her. Crispy, close to U.K. style fish and chips, AMAZING kale, caesar salad (and I don't even like kale), tasty, fresh beets and our double El Matador drinks hit the spot.

Not only are the dishes delicious, but they also looks so sophisticated. It's a perfect place for the first date if you don't want to spend a fortune but still impress your date. The chef chose 3 different appetizers for us (cold cuts, cheeses, olives, asparagus nuts ecc), it was a good portion!!! We got also salmon crostini. Delicious. Our server was very fast and super friendly. The place has also a very affordable oyster bar. The only small complain I have is that they don't have wine for a happy hour. Everything else is perfect.

I always avoid any chain, tourist trap restaurant. We are staying at the Hard Rock and we didn't want to hit the strip. We ended up at Culinary Dropout after looking at yelp. We sat at the open air bar. Dylin Lujan was our bartender. He is one of the best we've ever had. He answered our questions about some unique drinks they had, gave me tastes of some of their liqueurs and homemade mixers, and was very attentive, as was his barback. Prices for food and drinks are reasonable, quality is exceptional.  We had the pretzels and provolone fondue, kale salad, and monkey bread for dessert, along with 3 signature cocktails. Taste the falernum liqueur. The old fashioned was excellent, and the ""Pistols at Dawn"" is a sangria style mule. Adam the general manager came around and was super friendly. This was not your typical Vegas experience. Great place. Staff are all proud of the fine crafted food from scratch they offer, and the pride they have in their product shows.

The seating is comfortable with a view of the pool. We didn't get a chance to sit outside as it was 105 degrees. We were a group of three girls so it may seem like a lot of food but it was so good not to finish lol only a few Pretzel bites were spared. 
Food - Pretzel bites with cheese fondue: the first time around they didn't bring out enough cheese so we had to ask for another pot of cheese fondue. 
BBQ Pork belly nachos: De-li-ciousss! I just wish they would shred the pork instead of bigger chunks as its hard sharing with a group. 
Grilled cheese sliders - It only comes with three. Toasted, cheesy, warm, what more can u ask for? It also came with fries. 
Truffle potato chips- OMG. These are a must have every time! Try dipping them in the fondue cheese. Ah-mazing! 
Dessert - We had the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie & Caramel Salted Custard. Both delicious but the custard takes the lead.",fPjOYRRJPzsCO9t3NEPrKQ,1,1,5,Y54tnLYm2r2A2jDPWAvASg
