This is the best place to hang out whenever you need an excuse to hit up a good bar. The atmosphere was great and reminded me of the good ole days when people used to ring each others door bell instead of text when we got to each others house.

708664,2016-04-04,0,IkI9yPjx-MRYh-Jh-LqIiQ,"Having been to the Crown & Anchor on Trop several times before, I was jazzed to see that they were opening up a sister location within a one minute walk of where I work.  We popped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon to check it out.

Let me say this: if you are going here just to drink, or you're already drunk, you'll love this place.  They've got an expansive list of booze and it seems like it would be an awesome location for nightlife.

Unfortunately, we were here for lunch.  We ordered the crisps as a starter (which are potato chips but not to be confused with the ""chips"").  These were delicious.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned, they had us salivating for the main course.  We'd decided to split the fish and chips.  What came out was quite literally a hot mess.

It was a giant chunk of fish (as compared to the usual 2 or 3 slivers) with super saturated greasy batter that just sloughed off under its own weight.  The fish itself was chewy and rubbery and no amount of malt vinegar made it a desirable meal.  The side dish was peas, which were just barely cooked, unseasoned peas.  

The manager came over and asked how our meal was.  We ended up being honest with him, so he could be aware.  He listened very intently, though at times prodding a little too deeply, and took the greasy batter pile to the chefs to go show them.  He was nice enough to offer us dessert to make up for the meal.

We are in love with the sticky toffee pudding from the other location.  It's warm, slightly mushy, and deliciously coated with caramel sauce.  We hadn't intended on getting it here but we couldn't refuse his offer.  The dessert was abysmal.  The bread itself had the consistency of a sponge or bran muffin.  I had to take a knife to cut through it and instead of gently carving through, like a knife would with bread, it made a loud plunk as the hard chunk split right in half.  As it turns out, not even coating something in vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce will make it edible.

Now, I'm not saying don't go here at all.  The service was acceptable, even though the waitress was all on her own on a Friday afternoon, and the manager demonstrated a willingness to listen and try to fix problems.  But if you're going here for the food alone, you may want to think twice.",n1B1kiN3WHejdrmHgU5P2A,1,1,2,nvTMERDm1rI6bdnxJRL1Og

1276411,2016-12-06,2,IkI9yPjx-MRYh-Jh-LqIiQ,"To begin I would like to say that this 1 star review is only speaks to the malicious bartender that was pouring last Friday night. On December 2nd I attended First Friday with my fiancé and we were enjoying the night until we arrived at Downtown Crown. The first round of beers we enjoyed were fine and the location was pleasant but then I proceeded to have my second beer of the night inside. I ordered a PBR but the keg was blown so I decided to change it to a Hefeweizen. The bartender was slow to greet me but eventually took my order and brought back my beer. The menu shows that the drink was $7.50 so I handed the bartender two $5 bills. I did not say anything in between or after handing him the money and he took it and never came back with any change. As a customer it is my right to initially have my change back and then decided what amount I am going to tip the bartender. After that I was not impressed but I waited patiently until he came back my way to ask for my change. At this point my fiancé came back inside and watched as the furious bartender took $2 out of his tip jar and threw it down at me while he muttered some profanity that I couldn't hear at the time. Once we arrived outside both my fiancé and another friend that was with us let me know that the bartender cussed at me about the $2 and said ""you can have your two dollars I don't give a fuck bro!"". Once I heard that I decided to confront the bartender about this and he was immediately aggressive as if he wanted to fight me in his workplace. I asked him what he said to me earlier and he only responded with ""well what are you going to do about it?"" Which he repeated multiple times to egg me on but I didn't want to ruin my fiances night by smashing this short bartenders head into the ground so I continued to be patient and passive as I explained to him that you cannot treat customers the way that he was treating me. As an owner of multiple businesses I am appalled at the way this bartender treated me and I am in the process of lodging a complaint with the BBB. I didn't get a chance to get the bartenders name as he quickly had me escorted out of the bar but there were two bartenders on that night, one of which was a tall blonde man and the bartender I had who was a short stocky man with dark hair.

- They allow bikes to park right on the patio in the seating area. We made the mistake of sitting close to the entrance and we had to actually inhale fumes from the exhaust pipes of bikes 
- It is pretty uncomfortable when you are surrounded by bikers with guns and knives in plain sight especially when you mix that with alcohol. It's a disaster waiting to happen even if they seem harmless and friendly...
- DJ music is nice in any other venue but that does not blend at all in a British pub especially when they are hard to find in Vegas. 

Other than that, it's a pretty nice atmosphere and food is not bad at all. I'd come back here but would pick a different time and place to eat here. Would definitely give it more stars if not for the reasons above.",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,2,1,3,GCd7PhU5e7CEk3zrBBkClQ

1442593,2016-11-08,1,IkI9yPjx-MRYh-Jh-LqIiQ,"If you looking for Americanized, barely British food after a night of drinking at Artifice..this is the place.

Honestly, I have to say that the food here was extremely disappointing. My boyfriend is English and we were excited about eating here, thinking it would be authentic food. Sadly, we were very wrong. 

On the menu they have ""Traditional British Starters"" and under traditional British starters, they have ""Chips"". I asked the bartender and he said that they are potato chips, like American potato chips AKA crisps in England. Let me clarify: in England, chips are something equivalent to fries. At this self professed British pub, they serve American potato chips (homemade Lays) under ""traditional British starters"", and they call them ""chips"". This was very confusing.

Then, we ordered the ""Fish & Chips""..which came with British chips (AKA American fries) and it said on the menu to ""ask for peas"". I asked the bartender if the peas were mushy peas..like the ones that traditionally come with British food, and he said ""Yes, they are cooked""..even though that wasn't what I asked. When the peas came, they were not mushy peas..they were just cooked peas. He then told us that most of the British people that come in there just mush the peas themselves..right. Mushy peas ARE NOT just peas squished with a fork. Aside from that, the fish was bland and the batter tasted more like tempura than beer batter. Being that is it a huge fillet and not a few pieces of individual fish..it was extremely greasy.

We also ordered the Bangers & Mash. The sausages were pretty good but the potatoes needed lots of salt.

The drinks were good, but overall..we were disappointed.",4ZY0MyNOkB3GDvIJ3K2YCA,2,0,2,rrMDei-N0BHaOt6UcR4xFg

Don't go there unless you are specifically looking for trouble. On the night of August 9th-10th 2016 I was insulted and attacked on the premises of this bar. I was there with several people playing in a darts tournament. At the end of a game I went to the bar to ask for a glass of water. Behind the bar there was no one, at the bar there was the general manager which later I've found out is named Ric James Naughton. He was there with two girls and he was severely intoxicated. After going behind the bar to serve my glass of water, he insulted me calling me a pussy for drinking water. I responded to the first insult with a smile since I don't really care what a drunken man's opinion is of me. The second insult came as a response to my non reaction and he said he is fucking with me. No reaction to that, but than the guy when he saw that I just don't react he said ""but now I'm just shitting on your face."" At this point I told him that I'm from Romania and what he said to my face is extremely offensive. I also told him that in America there's something called the freedom of speech and I asked him how would he react if I would answer with the same coin. To be noted that no curse words came out of my mouth and did not respond to this persons provocations. After I said that there's freedom of speech and I could do the same thing the guy lost his mind. He grabbed a baseball bat from behind the bar and came all the way across the bar to me. Thankfully because I'm not a menacing looking guy he did not hit me directly with the bat he just tried to put it across my neck. I grabbed the bat and he started flinging me across the bar over the chairs and tables. At this point pretty much every one came in to my defense but the other bartenders showed up and a bar fight started since they were on the same side with their manager. In the middle of the chaos he punched a girl in the face. I don't know exactly which one of the bartenders also punched me in the face. Everyone went out and the attacker Ric James Naughton came out with a gun and yelling that ""this is my bar, this is my bar."" Shortly after police came most people ran away, I went back in the bar to close my tab and get my card back and was intending to stay so I can make an official complaint for assault on my life. I was asked to leave the bar because it's private property which I did and ended up writing my statement for the police outside. There will be legal charges against this person but do me a favor and don't give your business to such a local and such disrespectful people.

Thank you,

Food was decent but not great, seems you have to know what to order. The scotch egg is always a winner, as is the Stilton-Cabbage soup- it's great even in the heat of summer, salty and savory. The salad bowls are shallow so the portion doesn't quite match the price but they're generous with the toppings. The pies are good, but the steak is a little tough- I like the gravy though. 

Jennifer was super attentive as our server at the bar. Check their social media and site for their weekly schedule, they have AYCE fish and chips and pub trivia on Mondays and other events throughout the week.

Events like First Friday and other local artistry galleries occupy many of the older buildings on this side of town and this particular restaurant occupies a large building near the corner of Charleston and 3rd. Once occupied by the shuttered Bar & Bistro, The Downtown Crown is owned by the same proprietors that own the famously popular Crown and Anchor restaurant near the Strip that caters largely to the UNLV college crowd. 

Thus restaurant is quite different than its frat boy parent property. The building is more ominous. The patio is excessively large and in a phenomenal location for events and parties. The bar is nice and not changed at all since it was Bar & Bistro. They have added more intimate seating and the waitress uniforms are something out of Twin Peaks or Hooters, but with a British Flair. 

We had the pleasure of having a social, friendly, perky, and personable waitress named Madison. She was named after the mermaid from the movie Splash. Yes, she's that awesome. 

The menu offered several tastes of Great Britain, with things like Scotch Egg, Chips, and my personal favorite, Beef Wellington. Unlike most Beef Wellingtons that you will find in old school gourmet rooms, it is not a dish made for two. I have never seen this dish offered for one, and at the extremely reasonable price of like $15 or $16. 

I was EXTREMELY pleased with my experience at The Downtown Crown. From the impeccable service and personality of Madison to the delicious British fare, I look foreard to returning again and again. 

Plus, they had a Yelp deal. Cheerio my good chap!

Go there and hopefully Madison will be your server. And get the Scotch Egg. Trust me on this one.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,19,17,5,37XZgkCQlVenV2eSUudi7g

The new owners put a few dollars to change some of the decor and have even added some gaming with slots and video poker in the bar. A move like that will help sustain this business indefinitely.  Another plus is the Downtown Crown is now open 24 hours.

The patio area has been cleaned up greatly improving the space by making it appear larger and better organized.   I love this patio area. 

My friend and I arrived early evening to a non existent greeting and a deserted host podium.  We went to sit down at the tables but many were marked reserved. I asked and they said no go ahead and sit down??? We sat for several minutes with still no greeting or menus. I went to the bar to grab my own menu and the bartender said someone would be there shortly.  After waiting a couple more minutes a female customer of the bar approached us and took our order. We eventually got our beers, and our food, but definitely an opportunity to improve service standards at DTCP.  I know you can still have fun at work without customers suffering.  

The beer choices were very British but of course the other big 3 were available.  Prices were reasonable and they even have a decent cocktail menu. Menu states they have the best fish n chips in Vegas so I had to give them a try.  The plate came out hot. I was surprised it was just one large piece of fish though between 10-12oz.  The breading was thick and crispy and the interior light and juicy whitefish. Pretty good! This dish was served with a large portion of steak cut fries and a dish of peas in the center and both were tasty.   My friend had the pork sliders and he said they were good.

Overall experience was mixed.  Service was not the greatest this visit. The fish in chips were good. I will be back to enjoy the great patio dining that can be had at the Downtown Crown Pub.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,6,3,3,5P2Qvpo7bDol8c4GBexjFw

Eggs were perfect, banger was spot on for what I expected from a banger, toast and tomato were good. I'd give them four stars but one thing let me down - the bacon. It wasn't English bacon but American streaky bacon which I would have accepted had I been forewarned.

Downtown Crown Pub is the latest addition to the Crown and Anchor family, but this place is more like the ""hip"" little brother.

If you've ever been to Crown and Anchor, you know about their amazing chicken fingers, well my friend that whole menu is now being served at the Downtown Crown Pub. So come get your eat and drink on and then head out to explore the Arts District, graffiti and all. 

Downtown Crown also keeps in the tradition of having a great beer selection. All the classic English beers with a few local brews added in there like CraftHaus and Tenaya just to name a few.

Went on a Thursday night for a group dinner. I had fish n chips (with peas) while my boy had the watermelon gazpacho, a side of onion rings and a couple Hoegarddens. 

The fish was just ok, but I think it's more of my personal preference for multiple thinner/smaller pieces instead of a big fillet. The big fillet means a longer cook time which made portions of the fillet inconsistently greasy and hard. The gazpacho was uncharacteristically watery instead of well-blended like most gazpacho.  

We wanted to try the yorkshire pudding since they claimed it was the best, but either they were out of it or just forgot about it. 

Overall, the experience was ""ok"". I'd go back for drinks and snacks but $60 (with tax and auto grat) is too much for dinner for 2 at a pub. PLUS, the a/c was weak on our side. It was a good 15 degrees warmer than the bar side.",LWxR64_-iziF1fjGhAURHw,2,1,2,lFIFZB5pELXHe8YrEKURhA

Since the temperatures are now in the 100 and stupid range, eating on the patio was not an option for me.  I went inside and was greeted warmly by Theresa and I was told to sit anywhere.  It was 5:30 and most of the people there were at the bar.

I was brought a menu and an iced tea quickly and once my eyes adjusted to the dark interior, I looked through the menu and made my decision.  I ordered a cup of Stilton cheese and cabbage soup for a starter and since they claim their fish and chips are the best in town, I had to test their advertising.

The soup was great.  Good cheese flavor and nice pieces of sliced cabbage.  A good starter.  Next, the fish and chips were brought. It was not your ordinary fish and chips.  Instead of two or three small filets battered and served, it was one large filet that had been dipped in a batter that when fried, it came out almost like a pastry coating rather than a breading.  That's not a bad thing, it was just so different from anything I've been served before when I've gotten fish and chips.  The meal also came with a small dish of peas.

I liked the moist fish but there was a lot of batter.  I used all the tartar sauce with the fish.  The chips were more British than the normal French fries we're served and they were good.

For dessert, I got the chocolate bread pudding à la mode.  Because the pudding is so hot, Theresa brought the ice cream in a small bowl so it didn't melt over the bread pudding immediately.

Service was very good!  Theresa was a pleasant and efficient server.  She refilled my iced tea without asking.  I like the décor of the place and except for the USC banner, it replicates a British pub fairly well.  There are two dart boards and both were being used while I was there.  I didn't like the loudness of the music.  If I were not dining solo, it would have been difficult to carry on a decent conversation.  

I do have to go back and try the Scotch egg.  I forgot all about this.  Next time and one of the pub's pies.  I'll be back.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,13,3,0GfU1pM-YNiKZTgGvzTw2w

Now granted, when I went to Downtown Crown on a First Friday night, I didn't have high expectations. There are a ton of people downtown and this place is newly opened.

We got seated quickly but, this is probably a first, got seated TOO quickly. Why? The table we got seated at still had dirty placemats and glassware. The server who sat us there then said, ""Oh sorry about that. The servers here don't like to clean up after themselves.""

I didn't need to know that. Who needed to know that? I don't like seeing coworkers throwing each other under the bus. It's like when you're a kid and mom and dad are fighting but you still have to sit there and eat at the table. Who wants that feeling? The server did pepper in more of these little statements later in the night. 

Looked over the drinks for a while. The first beer I chose (dogfishhead 90 minute IPA) was out. Typical, I always pick the one brew that's out. Chose the British burger with homemade crisps. When the burger came out, it came with steak fries. My server was trying, I could tell she was having one of those days. 

I immediately told her that I had ordered crisps. I got my basket of crisps almost instantaneously. There were also cold, which was a shame as they were the best tasting thing I had ordered. They were probably sitting up on the line for a while. I got to keep the steak fries but that wasn't much of a come up as they were skimpy with those fries. If I had actually ordered fries, I would have been annoyed at the amount of them. 

Burger's bun was falling apart, which is always a shame. The burger was greasy as all hell. That's the easiest way to put it. It was hard to get past the greasiness of it. Sometimes greasy burgers can hit the spot, or sometimes they can disagree with your stomach. This burger was having a full on debate in my stomach later in the night. This burger matched the meh-ness of the burger I had at the Crown and Anchor on Tropicana. Consistency.

There is really no need for you to go to this Crown and Anchor. There are so many other delicious eating options near downtown (Therapy, Flippin Good, Carson Kitchen, Le Thai, etc etc etc etc etc etc.)",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,4,3,2,zek2w7u-SonVTEDAsbYmJQ

So I have to mention how much I love this place, not because it is a fun gathering place in the Arts District of Las Vegas,  Not because it is inside one of the supreme art gallery mecca of downtown (over 15 galleries), but due to the fact this place caters to my VEGAN needs and of course to PITBULL and T-Money$$ who are the Wednesday and Thursday Bartenders (easy on the eyes ladies)!  Yes, I am totally plugging their expertise of Bartending skills.  I love these gentlemen.  They always make me feel welcome and very attentive to the fact, when I walk in, they already know I want; a crown and coke - sometimes a wine.  

When Downtown Crown first came on the scene taking over the other establishment that was here, I was skeptical due to the lack of Vegan food, but guess what? They HEARD Me! Well not necessarily my plea and cry, but they heard the Vegan community (8 vegan options now) and I am so very happy to be able to come back here and keep hanging out at the bar, listen to groovy tunes, the company and able to get up and walk around and see the amazing art!  (I am an artist myself).   

Downtown Crown is a great place/pub to unwind, have a drink and talk with like minded people.  Not to mention the food... :)

She decided to pass & I opted for house Merlot which tasted like Mogen David so I swapped it out for Cabernet (a tad better).  There was no happy hour food but a $14 all-you-can-eat fish fry.  Since they had no coleslaw, I passed for bangers & mash platter.  My friend chose the Cuban sandwich which came with steak fries.

The bangers were totally gushy & I could hardly cut them because they then fell apart.  The mashed potatoes were packaged, but gravy pretty tasty.  The beans?  Oh, the beans.  Right out of a 50 cent can at the store, as in tasteless.  Crown Pub has no rolls & the only bread our server could bring is white Wonder bread.  My partner never had a Cuban sandwich before, so no complaints.   But I'll say on her behalf that it was quite skinny & served on that white bread.  The fries were mediocre, screaming for some garlic or even too much salt.

There were few patrons at 5:30 & yet the noise level in the bar & in the restaurant section was way too loud, & they weren't playing jazz or soft rock.  The highlight of our visit was our red-haired darling SERVER who exemplified everything you'd want in a waitperson.  She was prompt with our needs before we had to mention one, had a likeable upbeat personality & knew the entire menu.

Crown Pub needs some serious tweeking & my stomach is weak from the experience.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,1,0,2,wbegcN1m0WpNfWrQxVhZ-w

They were out of chicken fingers, french fries and chips, the server didn't know or care where anything was going, my bangers tasted and looked microwaved, no ice cream on my toffee pudding, the bartenders are not friendly and don't know their drinks. Drinks were also not comped for gambling. Although I did talk to the bartender about comping the drinks and they were quick to discount my check.",N_V20X2pvnTxJCMQoCACRg,0,0,1,aZPnRoOWoLBRzpSTIcKRpw
5481641,2016-11-15,2,IkI9yPjx-MRYh-Jh-LqIiQ,My gal pal and I were the only folks in the place.   So dead!   But our server Mercedes was awesome!  We both had drinks off their cocktail menu and both had a beer!  App was quick and so yumma (pot skins) and I had fish n chips my pal had steak sandwich.   Both on point!   I'd go back on a first Friday maybe!   Their beer prices are so OG!  I'm not a fan of downtown after working there 2 years but it a dope spot!  Check it out!,Xb4aKpOlHkp9dmgTa__Q4g,4,5,4,kMt_r04BP--m9nvspMN8fw

 It might take them some time to establish a loyal clientele to get the place hopping, my visit on Saturday night was pretty mellow and quiet.
 They retained non smoking policies of Bar and Bistro, which might make them an attractive option for some. Non smoker myself, I just don't care one way or another. I actually kind of prefer a smoky ambiance.
 We got a table and ordered crisps, scotch egg and mushrooms for appetizer and beef Wellington to share. 
 The only wheat-y option on tap was some Belgian white, so I went with that. The tap selection has a heavy British lean, as expected, sadly no local brews that I spotted. 
 The appetizers were all pretty meh, nothing I'd order again. 
 Beef Wellington, however, was a lot better than I expected, and an especially shocking value, if you've ever ordered it elsewhere, $15.95 is a steal. It was definitely enough for two with two individual pieces baked in dough, served with heaps of green beans (skip those) and pile of artfully arranged mashed potatoes. So the meat wasn't super tender, take it in the context of the venue. 
 All in all not bad at all, I'll return to sample more items off the tap and the menu, for sure. 
 Our waitress Maddison was super nice and attentive, not a single snag with service.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,3,3,4,mrpRc1cg1ZT4n6mb9PLPxA
5681168,2016-06-17,2,IkI9yPjx-MRYh-Jh-LqIiQ,I like coming here for the most past couple weeks. Been having some good nights there. The decor isn't is as British as the Big Crown on Trop but it's still solid and much more spacious. Most the staff is great. There is one manager I could live with out. All he does is walk around and talk about being a DJ. Never actually seen the guy do anything other than talk to his friends. Then the DJ he hired the other day was terrible. Reminded me of an episode of bar rescue. Kept waiting for Jon Taffer walk in and scream at this guy. Literally watched 3 attorneys I know walk out the bar when the DJ went on and pointed the speakers inside the bar instead of at the patio. Was no need for how loud it was. Shortly after they left watched an other lady who was day drinking pay her tab and walk out shaking her head. Other than the idiot who is a manager all in all is a great space. But that's why it only gets 4 stars instead of 5 stars.,5S_fm-hGzL9-3LQlt4mKEA,0,1,4,nkskILzaGEhYsoCWPkLYzQ

It was great that when we left all the servers were sitting outside like they were on break. Good thing it wasn't busy, we were 1 of 2 couples inside. Not to mention it took quite a while for a couple beers.",Ee90z2DkQDadmXlcevEQpQ,5,0,1,KEc0GdP7x8626lFGJh1-CA

The food was ok the second time. not sure if at 8pm they are more concerned with being a bar then a restaurant that serves food... maybe I'll try again as the place looks good and clean but definitely needs trained staff with customer service skills.",vwEbudgP8gP0UcVgaFlwPQ,0,0,3,53WNlTZYEBegSJBkmMixgQ
