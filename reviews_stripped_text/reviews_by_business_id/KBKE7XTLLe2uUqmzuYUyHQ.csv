The restaurant is very clean and uncluttered. There was a varied selection of entrees on the menu. My linguini with clam shells was delicious and plentiful. The side salad was very fresh and crisp. My husband had the minestrone soup which he enjoyed. I asked for bread, and the very accommodating waitress had the chef make up finger rolls using the pizza dough, which she presented with a small bowl of olive oil for dipping. For dessert we shared a piece of delicious and fresh baklava. Prices were reasonable given the size and quality of the servings. We look forward to dining there again soon.",uDdcL9B7CaVG8fkjk6GNGw,0,0,4,MhUsO9fx81abU3YL-qxJaA

There have been many other restaurants there the past few years. They have a variety of food. The menu is extensive. We decided on a take out pizza last night. Bought a large (18 inch) half cheese, half sausage. It was ready on time, but could have been hotter. Overall, we were happy with the pizza. Very tasty, not too spicy and, important to me, smooth sauce with no chunks. Price was average. We will be getting pizza there again.

Makes no sense. Also, there was a yound lady that was our waitress during one of our visits and she really lacked customer service skills.  Not friendly. She would drop our order off and then disappear into the back and we won't see her for a long time.  Another thing that does not make sense is the fact that the same food on the Pick Up/Delivery menu is not available on the Dine In menu.  Why not? But it also depends on who your waiter.  A very nice waiter let us order off of the Pick Up menu when we were not even aware that you can't dine in and order from this menu.  I sure hope they change that otherwise we won't be dining in anymore.

I liked the Mediterranean menu while the hubs enjoyed the chicken fingers and the kids loved the pizza. But after 6, yes 6 consecutive orders being wrong....we have had enough. Every single time, they have either left something off of the order or it was prepared wrong...not to mention they falsely advertised the drinks ( they are not canned, they are fountain) and sometimes the food is cold and even soggy. And when I call to inform them of the mistake, they never once asked if I would like them to correct it by bringing out the item that was left off the order. About half of the time I was offered a minuscule discount off of my next order, the other half of the time they would just say ""sorry about that"". To me the discount is a joke because 1. They already offer a discount to anyone if you order online and 2. They are assuming that we will order from them again. Their food is not good enough to keep putting up with their bad service, cold food and terrible customer service.

We ordered the Verdi Calzone with only the meat and cheese in it and had them add sausage.  We also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and one of each the cheesecake, cannoli and  the chocolate cake.  The total for the food we ordered came to $39.99 plus tip.  We were looking forward to it coming!  It got here hot and in the time span they said it would arrive.  The food was quite disappointing :(  The spaghetti had a rather plain sauce on it, and the meatballs were tasty, but not browned at all so they were actually a grey color which is not very nice to see, the noodles were quite overcooked, and we understand it was delivered but they were REALLY overcooked! The calzones crust was very bland with little flavor and it had a very bland sauce inside of it, I would not order either of these dishes again. The desserts, the chocolate cake was extremely dried out, actually to the point i could not eat it, the cheesecake was not bad, but we have had much better and the cannoli was disappointing also, the filling was gritty and heavy not light and creamy the way it should be and the cannoli shell seemed to be deep fried it had the taste of old oil and was not pleasant at all.  The best part of our meal was the bottle of wine we had with our meal, which my husband had received for his birthday earlier this month!

We said we wanted to sit down, and were presented with an entirely different menu. Which is kind of strange... it's almost as if the place hasn't decided if they are a carry-out or nice sit-down restaurant. I ordered an item off the carry-out menu anyway, which they were happy to give to me. I had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and my husband did a custom pasta bowl (alfredo). Both were tasty, but the environment still felt a little odd. Like I said, the whole premise of the restaurant seems confused. Sitting in a nice area with tablecloths and wine glasses, separated from the take out counter by a half wall.

Seafood options are limited to re-heated bulk store offerings. After calling in my order, the manager taking my order had to put me on hold for several minutes just to answer my question about where the clams originated.

Do have one complaint - we also ordered the Caesar salad on the side. This was NOT good. First of all it was expensive for what you got - just some romaine lettuce and a container of dressing - no croutons or cheese. Also, the dressing was not good at all.

5088718,2014-08-27,2,KBKE7XTLLe2uUqmzuYUyHQ,"So.... I was grabbing a free sandwich at Capriottis, but I was in the mood for chicken fingers and fries.... good ones.  Verdi was right next door.  So I walked in.  I looked through the menu and noticed that their fingers were $9 for five fingers, not including fries.... which is a good bit more than anywhere else, especially without fries.  The hostess let me know that you cannot sit inside and eat there unless you purchase a minimum of $10 per person.... which in and of itself was ridiculous.  Who puts a minimum order for dine-in?  Apparently only this place.  I also noticed that the dine-in menu had a 10"" cheese pizza for $9, but the same pizza was $6 to go.  The lady said, ""They're good, they are all white meat.""  I don't know any place that isn't all white meat.... I walked out.....

But it wasn't over.  I sat in my car for a moment and decided that while I was there, I may as well get their fingers because now driving someplace else would be a waste of time and gas.  So I went back in.... hoping the fingers were good.  I told the lady, in a joking manner that I decided to give them a try and that the fingers better be good!  She told me that the two people in their dining room (there were only two) are regulars and have the chicken fingers and garlic fries.  So I decided to give it a shot.  $9 for fingers.  $3.50 for garlic fries.  And $6 for a to-go pizza for a friend.

While I went to chat with the two regulars to see what the food was like, my friend heard the hostess say with an attitude, ""God, they're just fingers and fries.""  Yeah.  They are.  Fingers and fries you want me to pay $12.50 for.  So no... they're not just fingers and fries when you charge more than anybody in the city for them.
She also was caught saying, ""Well they're better than McDonald's.""  I would freaking hope so!!!!  You're kidding me right now!!!

She gives me the receipt to sign.  And places an ""x"" next to the tip line and total line.  If they think they're getting tips when they are forcing you to take it to go, they have another thing coming.

So we get the food and eat outside since we ordered the pizza off the to go menu.... so it was $6 instead of $9... making it impossible for us to dine in.  Even though I spent $20 for 2 people.  If we had wanted to, the pizza would immediately be $3 more, just to sit in their restaurant.

The fingers.  There were five.  Two of them were tiny wanna-be fingers.  One was a little bigger, and only two were good sized.  And while they tasted decently, they are identical to other fingers elsewhere (Metro Pizza, Winchell's) that charge much less, and serve them with fries AND veggies instead of having to buy an order of fries on the side.  (Metro pizza is $10 after tax for the same fingers, fries, veggies, and extra ranch... and Winchell's is $7.99 for the chicken fingers--six of them--with veggies--and $1 extra for AMAZING fries).  They didn't warrant me to pay $9 for them.  The fries... that they call garlic fries.  Were a butt ton of those fries with the terrible, crispy orange seasoning on them (like curly fries) that make the texture terrible... with maybe a small sprinkle of garlic on them.  MAYBE one clove over an entire to-go box stuffed with fries.  Hardly garlic fries.  Not great.  If you are going to call something garlic fries, EVERY FRY should have a garlic taste.  Not ten fries out of a hundred.  They should be tossed with olive oil, and covered in roasted garlic...
The pizza was eh.  The sauce was not evenly distributed, and my friend said that only one piece was actually good.

So.... because of the ridiculousness of this place.... I won't be going back.  If you want to completely over-pay for food that is not as bad as McDonald's, but not much better.... this is where you want to eat.",FF7C0VL0O2uueB16aY2sSA,4,1,1,JJMDLEBEMnleTzLelOyn-A

So with that, you're probably wondering why I am only giving them one star. It is due to the events that followed after this first visit.

The next time we had ordered from them, it took almost and hour to get our food and we were told to ""hook up the driver with a fat tip."" Ummm....excuse me ?? 
Sad to say that because this was said the delivery driver did not receive said ""fat tip.""

After vowing that we would never EVER go back here again, we got really hungry and the restaurants in walking distance just weren't satisfying enough at this particular moment. We broke our vow and decided to give these guys one more shot. Instead of getting it delivered we decided to drive around the corner and pick it up. Granted, we should have called it in and then gone and picked it up but two hungry and hormonal women cant always be on their wits end. We walk in and it is hardly what we expected. It was completely empty with a rather large dining area and a very comfortable black leather couch. The woman who ""took our order"" had quite the attitude and just gave off a really nasty vibe. We waited about twenty minutes for our food and then graciously walked out of those doors for what will surely be the last time. 

As we were walking back to the car we noticed the capriotti's next door and with the price we had just paid for lunch, we should have just gone there and gotten sandwiches that we were sure were going to be good. 

This place was very good at its beginning and has sadly gone down hill in the aspects of good food and fabulous service. I would not recommend anyone waste their time or money here.",jDKlkP3gqb0Smi6pRXLWbA,6,1,1,YJbkoZUy0lB06qLry2bdwQ

Now, the not so good...almost every time we place an order from this place, there is some issue. One time, we ordered two cheese pies. When we got them home, we realized that one had pepperoni on it.

Another time, we specifically asked them not to sprinkle the oregano garnish on the pie (my young son doesn't like it) and, when we got there, it had oregano sprinkled on it (causing us to have to wait 15 minutes for them to make a new one).

Two weeks ago, we ordered a cheese pie and they told us it would be ready in 20 minutes. When I got there (20 minutes later), I had to wait another 15 minutes.

I don't know what kind of math they use, but every time we order pizza, the total on the order differs. They tell us one price on the phone and it's either slightly higher or slightly lower when we get there. It's very strange and kind of a running joke in my family...guessing what the actual total will be.

Related to the math issue...one time, the total came to $18.64. I gave the guy a $20 bill and he gave me $1.25 back. I didn't mention the 11 cents he owed me because it was only 11 cents, but I was kind of surprised that he either didn't realize his math was off or didn't think that 11 cents was a big deal.

One time, we dined in their dining room and the service was incredibly slow (and, we were the only customers there). The only thing that saved the experience was the food. It was delicious, as always.

The staff is, for the most part, friendly and courteous. They mean well and are always willing to fix any errors on their part. I don't know if they are understaffed or what. With the incredibly delicious food they serve, they could easily be a highly-desirable eatery.

So, Verdi is kind of a mixed bag. The food is AWESOME, but you can expect some frustration leading up to eating it.

I'm always vowing never to order food from them again, but I always go back...LOL At least, their prices are reasonable...if you don't factor in the frustration.",RR6e9Flzur-FRBXq3x912g,0,0,4,nDdzk1IWWEv1mSconWygBQ
