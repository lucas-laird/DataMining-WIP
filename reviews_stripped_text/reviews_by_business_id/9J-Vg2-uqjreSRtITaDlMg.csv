I eat frozen pizza and don't even complain about that. Damn!!!  They need a new crust and less cheese. And it would be perfect. However, they have other things on the menu I'm going to try. 

Don't listen to me, you might like it. But me and 2 others did not like it one bit.",U9chA5huK1dOT6i0aErjUw,1,0,2,jMw_bQwBYDIIxykSXt4r9A

They have the best chicken wings ever here, pizza is great. Everything else we've ordered from here is great. I've never had bad food or bad customer service from here.

And i don't know what kind of cheese they use but it's amazing, my girl also says the chicken fingers are worth every penny. I always get a small pepperoni pizza and it's almost to much, a meal and a snack if u eat the crust, and you should, it's also delish",xTKvWIoEtYvVQkfipxnPOA,1,1,5,WassDY2Xj39MUdYMz5B4XA

When we go I usually order their wing combo with 12 wings, fries, and drink. I love this place cuz their wings are ALWAYS cooked the perfectly.

Their pizza is also good but their wings is the reason I keep coming back.

The slices were big, and the crust was just right. I also ordered a side of wings  that came with Blue Cheese and Caesar sauce with celery. The wings were wet which I prefer not over fried or crunchy. The quantity and quality for the price was great.

Staff were very personable, and helpful.
I left with easy directions to my destination and the best pizza and wings I've had in a long time.

It's not near my home, but I will definitely be back sooner than later.",RuID0Cs3Q3FLkkKVfPzHFw,2,2,5,JdVZaZ9tMsRD991AS-tZIg

I have tried other spots but no other place comes close to Odyssey. The owner and the cook have been working together since the first time I've been there!!

But I am crazy about everything else they serve, including their burger lunch special, their chicken fingers, and of course, their lasagna with garlic toast.  Perfect for lunch, perfect for a take out dinner when Mom is too tired to cook,  Nice salads for the ladies on a diet.  Not an upscale place, but none of those upscale prices either.",y3taInVgrfDTelUkQYQtEA,2,1,5,2c846X-btw3rlg9e3x0kOA
3871520,2017-06-03,0,9J-Vg2-uqjreSRtITaDlMg,"I stopped in here from a recommendation from the staff at Best Muffler Shop while I was getting some work done on my car. 

Don't let the outside fool you, from the outside, it almost looks like the building might be abandoned because there's not a lot of signage from the front, you enter from a small black door on the side. 

Once inside, the menu is pretty well laid out, not too big, not too small, they have enough options to satisfy most without the menu options being overwhelming.

I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with fried mushrooms, and it was one of the best ones I've ever had.

I met the owner Louie who was from Greece, so he certainly knows how to make good food.

Coming from myself as a local, the quality and taste of the restaurant was just awesome, looking forward to returning. 

Note, I was NOT offered anything in exchange for this review, this is my honest opinion and experience.",Tuaw5sbmKm7NuXY6r3RJ8g,1,0,5,L8SB3ITRlluAW7-SuTwanQ

5922230,2014-10-15,0,9J-Vg2-uqjreSRtITaDlMg,"Finding good pizza is a journey on its own. Thankfully you don't have to wait for the fall of Troy or defeat a cyclops to complete this odyssey. In fact all you have to do is go downtown and drive a few miles down on Fremont, and come to a nondescript blue and white building. You might question if you're in the right place, but trust your instincts because yes you are. Inside the pizza shop is very quaint. It has a very retro feel, in fact if I was told that nothing had been changed since 1994 I wouldn't be shocked. They even have a legit pac man/ donkey kong machine from the 80s. 
Now, most importantly is the food. The pizza is top notch. The crust is crispy, tasted hand tossed and well made. The sauce was ok, not bad but the cheese was oh so gooey and melty all inside my mouth. My test for a pizza is if it can hold its own without toppings and this passes with flying colors. I had the specialty pizza which had several meats and vegetables. I was too stuffed to truly appreciate the Stromboli but it gets a thumbs up. Your only excuse for not making it down here is if calypso imprisons you or Poseidon has a vendetta against you",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,2,0,5,2nAqLrGDaX39oY9tiaHRaw
