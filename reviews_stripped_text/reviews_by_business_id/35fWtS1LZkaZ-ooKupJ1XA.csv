We finished our (cold) food and beverages (refills were never an option and definitely no waters), and waited 20+ minutes for our check. At which point I flagged down the nearest employee, waited again for our waitress, and when she did not appear, I asked for the manager. Wish we would have just walked out on the bill for his treatment, but I am an honest person.

It was a slow Tuesday night and it took a minute to get greeted. Ran by most 20-30 yr olds looking for a J.O.B. No real passion or care. Once we were seated we were told about there happy hour. After waiting maybe 10 minutes a gal came to let us know our server was ""pre-occupied"" but that she would get us started with something to drink. I have been to many Buffalo Wild Wings and know that chicken takes a while to cook however I don't think that time is the only factor to poor service of this franchise across the board. I'm starting to believe it is lack of training. Maybe coming from the corporates. Oh and the employee with the long pony tail and black glasses that wanted to belt out ""where the f*** is Robert.

There's a long list of wing sauces and dry rubs, all of which can be tasted before deciding - a great touch, as it's sometimes hard to know how hot 'hot' is. We tried a few and picked 4 sauces for a large serving of wings, along with some fries on the side. Wings were 'naked' style and well-sauced. 

Wait staff were attentive and cheerful (it was quiet, so we had pretty much undivided attention).

Lots of TVs around the place and they'll change channels as requested so that you can watch the sport you're most interested in.

1170309,2017-04-30,1,35fWtS1LZkaZ-ooKupJ1XA,"Just finished having lunch at this location. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken. It came out in about two minutes, meaning the chicken was premade. It was half cold and part of it was hard.  I asked for no carrots on the salad, but Lacy decided to bring it out and then ask me if that was OK instead of telling me before the food was made and presented. Additionally, I ordered a Diet Pepsi. After I took a couple sips, I could tell by the grittiness on my teeth that it was regular Pepsi. I asked my server if she was absolutely sure that this was diet. She asked me (half-smartassedly) if I would like her to bring me a another Diet Pepsi so that I can compare the taste of them. What I really wanted her to do was take her eyeballs off of the sports highlights she was watching and take two seconds out of her workday to check to see if the soda fountain lines had been switched. Thankfully, I am not a diabetic but I do watch my sugar intake very carefully for other health reasons. I was not checked up on during my meal at all, or I would've asked for water instead. This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in my life and I'm pretty angry at myself for giving them my money. I will never ever return to this location again.

Update: Called this location the day I went and asked to speak to a manager because I wanted to tell someone in charge that there was something wrong in their restaurant that could potentially make people sick (serving sugar to people who can't have sugar). I was told that they were all in a meeting and someone would call me back in about an hour and a half. Two days later, no phone call. I plan to go in tomorrow and make a complaint in person. I'm not trying to be petty, but it is extremely clear to me that the staff at this location does not care about customers and I just don't want anyone getting hurt or sick because they can't be bothered to make a phone call.",kUQx_wxmHgZ4CvhNeDpPww,0,0,1,CGJRyqmByIFX-9PuYN0D9w

So we found our way here after walking past a sign that we saw within Planet Hollywood. What a journey if you're coming from the Miracle Mile shops. Just keep following the arrows, you're almost there. :)

Anyhow, we were greeted and sat almost immediately. That's about where the timeliness started and stopped. Server #1 got to us and asked us what we wanted to drink. Cool. Time went by, and by... then server #2 came over and re-took our drink order and EVENTUALLY brought us our drinks. It was explained that Server #1 was clocking out so Server #2 would be taking care of us. I've worked in restaurants... I know about shift change. Cool, no big deal. 

#2 was super polite and nice enough but the lack of being timely kind of killed the vibe for us. I think that we spent more time waiting than eating. The food quality was similar to any other Bdubs that you'd visit - nothing out of the norm to note here. Same insane amount of TVs with various games. Similar tap selections as the others I've visited.

If you want Bdubs that bad while on the strip, maybe your experience will be better than mine.

After not taking our order for 15 minutes (after we explicitly stated we were ready to order), we see them push the two empty tables together to seat a table of 8, who are not even fully present. 

Their refusal to work with their customers and inconsistency is a huge deterrent for eating here. While the food of BWW is consistent and delicious, the service here is appalling.",RZNPRHLDJLseTcf5ClxtxA,3,1,2,JFXggXz7ESUnOMeaLzFFjg

We wanted to actually hear the game and the casino sports bars that offered that - and that were not booked - were hard to come by. 

Here's why you should go here:
- If you have Natasha as you're waitress you're already  winning. She was super nice, attentive, and fun. She tried to organize her tables so everyone knew who was cheering for what team so there'd be friendly trash-talking. (My husband appreciated that!)

- Food was good. I had a salad. (Don't judge, needed greens so my body wouldn't collapse from Vegas fun.) Then had the garlic parm wings and the lemon wings. So good and perfect amount of crispiness.

- We were seated quickly and our server was there right away.

- Screens! Big screens everywhere, it's glorious!

- Bathrooms are clean!

As we spoke to the other manager he said he would take care of it, and another employee followed us out the door, and harassed us. My boyfriend spoke with him in a decent manner and for some reason he got offended and said ""all of us white people look the same to you now"" as I was trying to speak with the man his manager came out of the corner and began to kick us out stating ""you are not my customers you need to leave"" without even asking about the situation or Trying to solve the issue. Instead we were kicked out in front of everyone at BUFFALO WILD WINGS IN LAS VEGAS near aria hotel. I'm humiliated and should not have been treated in this matter. On top of that as we were trying to clarify, the manager in the video states ""what's are you gonna do about it your in VEGAS"" @bwwings I will not return to that location, is this the way you treat your customers BWW? I'd like a response. In my years of working hospitality, this was not right for your workers that are the "" face of your company"" to speak to us. He threatened us by saying security will come and take care of us, and said that we don't know how to Treat workers. First of all my sister is security, and knows there are lines that should not be crossed. Second her wife is a server so we treat all with respect whether they're working as servers or not, and on top of that I specialize in hospitality and am very clerical so he had no reason to argue and say we don't know how to treat people when all we do is work with people and the public for a living. This is going to corporate. Because I'm sure by the way they were acting and saying those inappropriate things, they treat all of their customers like that.

I arrived at Buffalo Wild Wings around 4am on a Sunday morning, completely coherent. I was shown a table relatively quickly. However, that is where the quickness stopped. When my party arrived the restaurant was NOT bust. At all. 

It took awhile for the waitress to approach us. When she did she quickly asked if we would like anything to drink or if we would like any appetizers. We ordered two queso dips for the table and waters all around. 

When the rest of the party arrived she came to take our food order. She was not very friendly. Very straight and to the point. Two people (out of 8) ordered beer, which usually comes BEFORE the food. 

After she left our queso arrived. It was COLD. Not even luke warm. Cold. We knew that our waitress would not come back anytime soon, and we were hungry, so we just ate it. 

After about 20 minutes we started to wonder about the beers. Where were they? We flagged down the waitress and told her to just cancel the beers. She apologized for the wait, explaining they were busy (note, they were just starting to get busy, she had plenty of time to bring the beer prior). We feel as though she should have brought the beer anyways, like most restaurants would. 

When our food arrived it was hits and misses all around. All the wings seemed on par, but NONE of the wraps had sauce. HOW. They use wings in the wraps, and wings have sauce right?

Of course it took forever to get our check and she was less than authentically apologetic. I hate writing poor reviews and rarely do. It takes alot for me to do this, but this was just an all around bad experience.",fBZc57a0OCHo4RVwDwOe2Q,6,2,2,VcBKVfnMAMwTZUYipkBZlA

After an hour wait, they proceeded to seat half of our party at one table and the other half diagonally across the way. seriously? We asked several times if we were able to combine the tables but I never heard a legitimate excuse as to why not.

If you do need to come here for food and the convince of the location don't expect any service, so save a few dollars and save your tips. Might meet nice employees but that doesn't mean anything when the overall service will be bad. Being part of the service industry management, you notice employees will be nice and expect a tip just bc of convince, but it doesn't work that way in the real world. The word sorry only means so much.  It's worth the 10 minutes drive to another  Buffalo Wild Wings. Management up to district manager  and whoever runs this location  should be embarrassed that a place like this is manage this way.",mvbhQ0qah5lxJcS25oxjlg,0,0,1,XxvMECb4WD7kCBSIz5pvqg

The service was really great, we got to sit at the bar and was provide a one on one service. There wasn't much oil or grease on the wings. The fries were really good, and the ranch made it even better. We would definitely return.",7-BFcAaR41aedsC_F3O_sw,1,1,4,nXiiofNNvJ8MaZO_aBajZw
