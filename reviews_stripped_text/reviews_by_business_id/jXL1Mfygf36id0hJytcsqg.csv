20791,2010-12-04,0,jXL1Mfygf36id0hJytcsqg,"Nice location: not crowded and fast and very friendly service.

This review refers to a carryout order of the newly re-introduced Cheesy Bites pizza. Generally I am not a fan of Pizza Hut, I find their Pan Pizza too greasy.

 I have tried the Cheesy Bites in many places around the world and especially in Europe it was a-m-a-z-i-n-g. So the European version of the Cheesy Bites is my benchmark. (for pizza connoisseurs, yes it was Pizza Hut and it was that good)

The Cheesy Bites themselves I was slightly disappointed when comparing them to the EU ones. The European ones were big, puffy and filled with cheese. These ""new"" ones were smaller, crispier and without as much cheese. They were actualy smaller version of the Stuffed Rolls Pizza Hut had. I should point out here that the cheese had a slight tanginess I didn't like (same as with Stuffed Rolls);  mind you I am very eclectic (and even weird) when it comes to cheese (for example I hate cheddar, unlike 95% of people) so unless you've tried other versions of the Cheesy Bites you probably won't notice the difference. 

Otherwise the crust and sauce were just perfect. The crust was chewy and soft without greasiness or sogginess and combined with the sauce it had a very pleasant sweet taste.

The price for the large Cheesy Bites was about $12 or $15 if you choose a specialty pizza (like the Lovers pizza) and while it may not be the cheapest pizza in town, especially for a pizza chain, is good value for something different. If you just want great cheap pizza try Jesse's Pizza or Pizza My Dear for $5.

The pizza was baked adequately, maybe it would be better with a minute less or so but the baking at Pizza Hut is usually automated.

The place wasn't crowded on a Friday night and service was fast and very warm and firendly, such a rarity these days.

Overall I'd give this version of the Cheesy Bites 8.5/10 and this store 4.5/5.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,2,0,4,Z0sRgMdai5hxzlM-RuIpCQ

Was told their was a mix up with my order and that it was leaving the store now. Had a call back about 5 minutes after that that said my card had been declined when my order was placed therefore my order was not coming. When asked why nobody tried to contact me was told by the manager Steve that one worker and multiple drivers tried calling me, untrue first of all, and second if my card declined when I placed my order why on earth would multiple drivers be trying to call me if it never left the store. Horrible customer service and they definately dropped the ball. Steve the manager has no handle on his crew or the slightest clue what his workers are telling customers.

812391,2016-12-31,0,jXL1Mfygf36id0hJytcsqg,"Pizza Hut is usually my favorite place to order pizza from, and it always has been. The last order i made was off, cold and not so good. They gave me a credit, and ere very nice about it. Made things right. It was a $80 order. 
I decided to use that edit now a couple weeks later to order again. I got a half and half large stuffed crust pizza. The pizza came with incorrect toppings, and a ton of pepperoni on the top of one side, missing another topping. I called and told them this is the second time it had been wrong, and they said they'd give me another credit. This was a $40 order.
The girl Logan was so incredibly rude, i asked to speak to her manager. She said she is the manager. I told her she was so rude. She said that she apologized, and that she wasn't rude. I told her it was her tone of voice that was rude and disrespectful. She said well I'm giving you a credit? I told her i understood that but she's still a bitch. 
Granted, i shouldn't have called her a bitch. But i have ALWAYS loved Pizza Hut. And I feel like they're going to shit. How could they hire a manager that is so rude to customers over the phone, and so poor at fixing a problem. I definitely will think twice before ordering from them again. 
Pizza hut has been by favorite my entire life, and their food and employees are going to shit. 

Thanks for the friendly help LOGAN! :)",uUNTiB6QEAxjpxUxBw-Dyw,1,0,3,cBb87MI0Wj8wTEUI90Jr-w
917220,2018-02-22,0,jXL1Mfygf36id0hJytcsqg,"Placed an order for delivery at 10:15 and the store closes at 11:00. I got a call from the manager saying he needed to cancel my order because because they had other orders before mine and wouldn't have time. The estimated delivery time is 25-35 minutes on the app which would be well before closing. He was unapologetic and when I suggested sending another worker out to finish deliveries or maybe staying open a bit later to fulfill orders, especially because right now is obviously a very busy time for business so why close at the peak? He quickly said no he can't and was obviously only giving one option. No apology, no rain check, no empathising. Just nope, we can't. Bad business and bad look on this store and its choice in management. Not being willing to stay open maybe an extra 10 minutes just shows the poor amount of enthusiasm and work ethic in that store. That patheticism probably would have shown in the quality of my food so I'm happy to cancel.",Vl5-C6YwZCeoWswYa2bxeg,0,1,1,jO5eQkq_fdiimk2LCqk-fw

1206038,2015-08-01,0,jXL1Mfygf36id0hJytcsqg,Made a account just to right this review and I wish there was a 0 I could give. I ordered a pizza from them and didn't receive it till 1 1/2 hrs late. First off it was warm to cold and the cheese was already hardening. Why this was idk since I stay about no more than a mile down the road. I bit into the pizza and nothing but dough! I called them and asked if I could talk to the manager which was Veronica and she was completely rude once I told her what happened. I spoke to her very calmly and never once was rude. When I asked for my refund she told me she'll give me a credit and next time ask for my pizza well-done! WTF who orders a pizza undercooked for there to be a option to ask for one well-done? First of all Veronica dough needs to be cook to a certain temperature since it contains eggs which can lead to a food borne illness smart ass. Even though I already knew it was BS I called 2 other pizza huts and confirmed there wasn't a such thing. NEVER will I EVER order from Pizza Hut again. Last Pizza Hut I tried was a complete disaster as well. Pizza Hut please train these franchises a bit more.,k_AjeNw5rOX_NlkEzsNZcA,0,0,1,iD0uc4-I_ZYCmk3oR04QLA

i have tried again and again to give this place a chance and they have failed me every time.

coming from a morning cook at a Pizza hut in utah i can understand how sometimes a mess up occurs, but when it's repeatedly there is no excuse.

firstly, my pizza was cold (I CARRIED OUT TOO HOW DOES IT GET COLD IN THE WARMER???) and had barely any pizza sauce, the toppings were sparse and the wings were so soggy i couldn't stand eating them. it's one ladle of sauce per 8 wings which is enough to coat the wings but not remove the crispy-ness. ugh. so done giving them a chance.

save yourself from horrible pizza and order some place else.

3458018,2013-10-05,0,jXL1Mfygf36id0hJytcsqg,"My one-star rating is mainly because the wings from Pizza Hut are god awful and I want to warn people before purchasing them.  If you want to get a pizza from them, go right ahead, but steer clear of their selection of wings! 

A night or so ago I was having a craving for wings - and let me tell you Yelpers, it was a terrible craving.  I ordered Pizza Hut's medium wings and lemon pepper wings.

The first thing wrong with both types, was how they make/prepare them.  The wings that I drool over and always end up craving later are the kind that are fried or baked until the skin on the outside of the wing is crispy.  Then, obviously, they drown these wings in sauce and bam you've got yourself something to die for. 

Pizza Hut's wings?  They actually coat the wings in a very, VERY thick cake-like batter and cook them that way.  They then coat the wing in a select type of sauce (that is poorly made as well).  You go to take a bite and the majority of what you get is batter!  If you're lucky to get meat off of the bones, which I barely was, you get a thick flap of wet (not crispy) chicken skin and what appears to be STEAM cooked meat. 

The sauce they coat the batter in is anything but extraordinary.  The medium-hot wings I got had a super strong smell of vinegar coming off of them but little to no heat/spice level at all.  My lips didn't burn while I ate them and my tongue wasn't crying for a time-out.  Yes, yes, I know!  I got the MEDIUM ones but generally they have SOME heat to them, right?  Wrong.  Perhaps my taste buds are growing immune but the level of heat on the medium wings was just downright criminal.

I had high expectations of their lemon pepper wings, as those are my favorite kind of wings, but I turned out to be sorely disappointed.  They were horrific and this is what made it or broke it for me.  Clearly in the name of the type of chicken wings, there should NOT be a level of overpowering sweetness, correct?  I took a bite of a wing covered in what appeared to be a gooey sauce with specks of pepper in it and I was totally turned off.  The sauce was SUGARY.  I've never tasted lemon pepper wings anywhere where it tastes as though they put honey in it or some form of sugar.  I could barely taste the kick of pepper.  To be quite frank, I don't think they put any sort of pepper in it because all I tasted was the sweetness.  It tasted like someone slathered a battered up piece of meat in syrup.  If I wanted something like that, I would have gone into a reputable restaurant and ordered chicken and waffles. 

Needless to say, I am thoroughly grossed out and never touching anything 'wing' related by this company anymore.  Truthfully, I don't even want to touch anything Pizza Hut makes at all because this experience has not only left me feeling physically sick from the poor quality of the food, but it was expensive and a complete waste.

They did replace the chicken wings (that were forgotten) by delivery but guess what they got here in 20 minutes piping hot. Why can you get me something you forgot in record time but cannot get me food to my door when you say! The things that make you say hmmmm!
