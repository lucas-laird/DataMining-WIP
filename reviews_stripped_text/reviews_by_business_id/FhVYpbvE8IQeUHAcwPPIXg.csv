The service was more than accommodating and the interior was a real surprise, definitely feeling a little more upscale than most Italian restaurants in strip malls. The bar set up was pretty cool too and good to grab something to eat and watch a game and have a drink. We ordered the calzone, they have family size portions and after splitting this between my wife and myself, we still had a little to take home! It was actually one of the best calzones I have had in a while, had plenty of ingredients and the dough was tasty. My wife's family had owned a pizza restaurant for years and she loved it!

We had a monstrous craving for quality pizza on a late Monday evening and happened across this place around 8. It was near empty and quiet, but the staff was warm and welcoming all the same. The atmosphere is nice and ""classic Italian"", and the place just has a nice cozy feel all around. 

We ordered one of their main pizzas, which included house salads and garlic bread (with a delicious and tangy balsamic to dip them in!). 

Everything was delivered in the perfect amount of time. In spite of the late hours, the salad was fresh, crisp, and refreshing. Not too much, nor too little Italian dressing. The garlic bread too, was a warm and welcome appetizer. It was quite tempting to fill up on it before the pizza even arrived, but we took special care not to. We were here for the pie, after all! ;)

The pizza itself was EXACTLY what we were looking for. It was placed before us on an elevated frame in the middle of the table, steaming fresh out of the oven. The pie was loaded with wholesome toppings like olives, mushrooms, and tomatoes, and the cheese was melted and gooey to perfection! That's all I can really say. It's just. Good. Pizza. We could't finish it all and ended up taking it home, and it still tasted every bit as awesome. 

We also ended up getting some pistachio gelato to take home, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, it was nothing short of absolutely delicious. 

This is a great place for pizza made with care and friendly service. I hear there's some live music sometimes (we missed it this time) and the pasta's also good, so we're definitely gonna come back for that. :)",WM00OaPW6D2UvnI7TiM0Tw,0,0,5,8eX92UWKQXeo2GtNwk7fQQ

Their food is homemade everyday from fresh ingredients. We go with friends as it is so nice to have a family restaurant that doesn't feel like Vegas. It's a great place to sit, eat and drink with friends. They even have live entertainers on some nights, a piano player and a Frank Sinatra impersonator make for a nice atmosphere. The patio is great bonus when the weather is nice....

We've always had such great food there that we had a Xmas party in their private room. They helped lay out some nice family style dishes and everyone went home stuffed!! It is a nice intimate room just off the main dining room so you can still hear the music in the background and doesn't feel like your off in a dungeon. It is easy for the servers to get in from the back so the service was great. Thanks Elias!!  

They have a great happy hour with something like 24 beers on tap and food specials. . It's not a video poker bar so everyone sits around and chats, something that is such a nice change from most Vegas bars. Like I said, it's great to finally have a nice friendly neighborhood restaurant with such good food and service.

We order a large pizza (so/so) and had leftovers - the kicker? There are about 1000 pizza boxes ""decorating"" the restaurant, but the waiter brings out a styrofoam dinner container, stacks our remaining pizza slices on top of each other and crams it into the container. Without asking for additional drinks or dessert we're presented the bill. For the next 10 minutes our waiter passed by 15 times looking to see if we'd put our card in the flap.

Second issue was we had a coupon for a free desert for each entree.  So we ordered two.  They charged for the second... and I hope they charged double, because 6 bucks for two very small scoops is excessive.  did not say anything because it did not seem worth it.

And my final issue is probably completely personal.  They have a man playing piano live.  I found it to be intrusive and annoying.  I could not hear my dinner companion speaking.  I don't want to have to talk over music, if they have to have him playing, they should substantially lower the volume.

1471902,2015-04-06,0,FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg,"Details:
-Saturday night, 7pm
-Patio 
-Party of 15 

Service:
We had a sweet waitress who really was trying to give great service. (I'm not sure why the restaurant didn't use 2 servers for our large party). A few meals were forgotten and our server didn't take orders in any particular order, so it was a bit chaotic. Once we were all settled with our food, our server was attentive and filled our drinks regularly. A few times a man who appeared to be the manager/owner came out to inquire about our meal and experience. That was nice. Again at the end of the meal, there was much confusion about who had what food, and what check it was on. . (I was a server for a few years, and I know it can be difficult) 

Food:
The food was ok. The owner said everything is made from scratch which was great to hear. I was feeling simple and ordered the fettecini Alfredo. It was meh, but didn't exceed expectations.  It was normal but definitely tasty. The best thing I tasted were the Italian nachos (app) . It was amazing!!

Awkward Experience:
This was so weird and awkward! So they had a Frank Sinatra impersonator as the entertainment.  We were the only table out on the patio where his little stage was, and thus the only audience. (our table was literally 3 Ft from him and his speaker) My family just wanted to visit and talk amongst ourselves but this guy kept trying to interact and make jokes, which would have been great if we were susceptible to it. He kept making passive comments hinting that we didn't like him and other weird things. At one point my aunt asked him if he could please turn down the music so she didn't have to yell across the table, he was noticeably bothered and just made it awkward. Eventually our server picked up on it and the manager came out to ask him to perform inside. But as the manager was urging him inside he called out ""you guys really don't want me out here?!"".  Talk about uncomfortable. We didn't request entertainment. It would have been totally fine if he just sang and didn't try to be all interactive to a large group that wanted To talk and visit. And then he started smoking while singing very close to our table. So we got to smell his smoke while we ate. We were all so frustrated and uncomfortable. 

Wrap-up:
I hope the establishment gets a handle on Mr. Sinatra. He was quite a detraction from what could have been a comfortable and nice evening.",fZC9HosD74mDARzA_gzrmQ,2,0,3,qPqotrh3QbkZeO5gfIrgfg

Menu states that Pizza comes with family style house salad and garlic bread with the option to upgrade to Caesar salad for 3 dollars more. This translates to two individual salads with a 6 dollar total upgrade charge. I'm not even going into the politics of salad differences.

Pizza came out with toppings wrong.

It was one of our parties birthday, and the hostess stated that she would get a brownie. Instead they brought out a 9 dollar tiramisu. It was delicious, just not 9 dollars delicious. Especially when we didn't order it.

Overall decent food, just be careful about hidden costs.

They were out of a couple of the beers we wanted so we had to opt for second choice. Ordered happy hour personal size pizza and opted to add an extra topping to it. When pizza came out it is large definitely worth the $8. But it was not warm cheese was already set and it just did not taste very good. It didn't have good flavor. And it was greasy. Crust was too soggy. I actually brought it home and put it in my own oven and crisp up the crust more. Metro way better. $2.50 beers are an OK deal.

Unfortunately our 3rd visit will be our last as there is too many inconsistencies.

1st visit: We ordered a pizza with pepperoni, onions, and sausage.  It was perfect!  The cheese and crust was cooked to perfection.  It was also served with strips of garlicbread and a side salad for each.  We also ordered the calamari which was good...but nothing special.

2nd visit: We ordered a pizza with pepperoni only.  The pizza came out ""warm""...the cheese didn't even stretch as we served it.  I don't know about you but We like our pizza piping hot out of the oven...and the waiter this time told us that the restaurant just got a new oven so he would let the new Chef know what our feedback was.

3rd visit: We were so hungry that we ordered the Venetian wings and a sausage/mushroom pizza.  We were served a family style salad and a basket of garlic bread.  After about 45 minutes of waiting for our wings, we asked teh waiter to check on it and he told us that the wings take longer because they serve ""Colossal wings"" and want to make sure it is cooked perfectly.  5 minutes later he arrives at our table with the pizza and the wings.  The wings were NOT and I repeat NOT colossal in size at all.  I was also served barely warm.  The pizza again was not piping hot as the cheese did not stretch.

I was wrong. To begin with, the service was poor. Our waiter was bussing tables

We could see our order on the rack behind the glass, but the chef(cook) realized
the waiter wasn't there so he delivered it himself.

of spaghetti with a meatball(7.00). My gf and I wanted to try what should be signature dishes.
The meatballs were ok. However, The bread did not appear homemade. 
An Italian restaurant should never use packaged rolls. Also, the sauce was very
sweet and tasted like it may have been at least partially, from a can. 
The sauce certainly DID NOT have that ""made from scratch"" taste and texture.

Gabriella's is the polar opposite - the service was fantastic.  Our waitress Tiffani was very professional and treated us well.    The gentleman who explained the food couldn't have been nicer (Tom maybe?  Manager? Owner? Not sure).  Everything is made daily and the flavor totally speaks to that.  I had the lasagna and it was fantastic.  May be the best lasagna I've had outside of the East Coast.  My friend had the minestrone.  One of the kitchen employees passed by just after the food was served and suggested she try it with fresh ground pepper, she obliged, and said it really did make a difference.  She loved it.

In addition to our server, Tom (?), the pepper guy, and a few other employee's checked in and made sure we always had what we needed.

These people clearly understand what running a restaurant is all about.

3029649,2015-01-17,0,FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg,"Came here on a Tuesday night with my lovely wife and mother. 

Cozy, casual, (even romantic) gem of a place. I did not feel like I was in Vegas at all. 

A soloist singer was belting out songs from the days of The Rat Pack. A tad too loud, but a nice touch that we enjoyed. 

Our server was very attentive, pleasant, and helpful. You can tell that whoever does the hiring knows what to look for in employees.

My wife and I shared a white pizza called the Sicilian. I wanted a white pie, and this came as a recommendation. My mom got the sausage and peppers. 

We were pleased to find that a house salad comes with most entree's. You can upgrade to a Cesar for $3 We all tried the house salad.

The salad was okay. The dressing tasted of mostly of wine vinegar which dominated the flavor of the salad. (a little crushed garlic, egg and anchovies goes a long way) Since it was offered for free, I did not care too much. I had extra freshly ground Parmesan cheese put on mine and it helped.

I enjoyed a Moretti draught, and the girls were drinking Chianti. The price for our beverages were $4.50 each which I thought was a good price. 

Pizza. 
MAGNIFICO!!! BRAVO!!! This place knows pizza! 
Capicola ham, Italian sausage, Genoa salami, Fontina, Mozzarella, and Romano cheeses.
The flavor of this pizza was beautified by the high quality Italian meats that topped it. Crust was thin, slightly charred, chewy and crispy. I asked for a side of olive oil just to finish off the ends. We devoured the whole thing and I was actually sad when it was gone. 

Sausage & Peppers

Gabriella's makes their sausage in house. You can tell because it is so lean. 
The presentation is nice. They stack a generous amount of links in a ""box shape"" on the plate with a side of your choice of pasta. 
My mom loved the marinara sauce, but was not a fan of the sausage preparation. 
I thought the sausage had a really good flavor profile. I could not tell if it was fennel or anise seed that was the dominating spice but I liked it a lot. They grill it here, so it is presented charred and with smoke flavor. (the owner/chef is from TX so I get it) Different from what us N.E. Italians are used to. But because the sausage is so lean, I think that it dried out from the grilling process. I find Boiling lean sausage first and then browning after keeps it moist. Still, I finished it with no worries. It went well with my frosty Moretti. 

We passed on dessert, our server was quite the salesman but we resisted. 

I REALLY REALLY REALLY like this place and will return. 

I want to try a red pizza and possibly the lasagna (another recommendation). I don't think it will take much for a 4 star rating next time around. 

Thank you Gabriella's for succeeding where so many others have failed.

Ambience was great. The inside is much bigger then the outside leads you to believe. they even had an upstairs balcony area for large parties. They had a clear glass partition into the kitchen area and a projector screen playing the movie ""Guys and Dolls"" from the 50's. it was really cool.

Service was outstanding. the gentleman helped my family perfectly. There was a note on the menu that said no substitutions and no changes. I was worried since I am allergic to cheeses. the waiter laughed and just said the owner puts it in the menu to avoid outrageous requests and to hold the integrity of the dishes.

I got the chicken and artichoke, family got pastas. everything was perfect. nothing else to say.  The bill came out to $95 thats 4 adult plates, 2 canolis, and 4 non alcoholic beverages.

The minestrone was just awful. It tasted like they used pre-packaged powder seasoning of some sort with absolutely no flavor from the vegetables. Calamari was so chewy like rubber that we had to chew like 1000 times. The pizza? Oh my... we ordered the sonny which is their version of a supreme or a combination I think. The sauce was horrible.. it actually made me spit it back out. We also ordered their $20 ""specialty"" pasta. All we tasted was alcohol. Either they were trying to cover up something fishy or just really love using EXTRA vodka in their sauce. The house salad that came with the meals, ughh.. how do u mess up on salads??? Also ordered a slice of cheesecake which was waaay too sweet. Although they were nice enough to give us two free cannolis, they were also just bad.

Last time we had the calamari. It was decent enough, but tonight we had fried mozzarella. I preferred the mozzarella to the calamari.
Also had Caesar salad and regular house salad. I really enjoyed the Caesar. The house dressing, on the other was very light.  
This time, instead of pizza, we went with the chicken parm and the ravioli. The chicken parm was good. The ravioli tasted like it had not been cooked long enough. It was a bit doughy.
Now, full disclosure. They were serving a party of 12 and we did wait a while to be served. We really did not mind that much, because we enjoyed the music, the down time and Heather, our server was so pleasant. The manager was apologetic, so I want to believe that, in the interest of getting food orders out, the raviolis might have come out too soon.

Our salad came out first and it was way below expectations.  Wet iceberg lettuce with a 1/8 of a chopped tomato.  I could not tell if there was dressing on the salad or if it was wet from the rinsed lettuce.
While out appetizer and salad came out in an appropriate timeframe, our food took forever which when you are a restaurant that is kid friendly, is i expectable.  When our food finally came out,  they brought mine and my husbands but stated that my daughters would take longer.  It was noodles with butter-  what was the issue?  Her food came out in an unreasonable amount of time after.  
My daughter loved the meatball but didn't touch the spaghetti.  She didn't care for it.  She said it was wet and mushy.  
My husbands eggplant was very flavorful but the slices were cut a little too thick for my liking and it was a little salty for our taste.  
My artichoke chicken was less then par.  The pasta was mushy-  way over cooked and the chicken had way too much going on.  Nothing blended together in the way you would expect them too.  We asked for more bread, on two super are occasions (which was delic) because my daughter was still hungry but they failed to bring it. 
When we got the bill I was shocked to see they didn't include a kids soda with the kids meal.  Her meal (which she didn't eat) was $8 and $3.50 for a soda.  
While I do have high expectations for Italian food, this place failed on all levels in my book.  We will not be back.  Save the time, the calories and the money.  There are better places in town.",yZ3Zm1fBfqlBWhFikW7MEw,0,0,2,w8-5WrVehKccRTNVX7jrQQ

4893733,2014-09-04,2,FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg,"STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I was totally stoked when I read the reviews on yelp prior to going. We went for my husbands 40th birthday. I asked the hostess on the down low if they could do anything for him like sign or cake. She totally miss understood the question and started talking about how they host large parities and cater...total blond. She finally got what I was talking about but it was too late my husband had heard the whole conversation. Surprise blown :(

Let's move on to the waiter...nice guy, asked if we wanted drinks. Now on yelp I had ready that they have 80 selections of beer...AWESOME...no, not really. I asked for Mich Ultra and he said they did not have that. I asked for Hein Light, no they don't have that. I said, ""What kind of light beer do you have?"". He said, ""we only have Corona Light. Okay, I can live with that. So what does he bring me...a Coor's Light. WTH?? I feel the waiter was not educated on the beer/wine selections. 

So we order apps, Calamari & Brochette. Calamari was good but the brochette was nothing but tomatoes and cheese. Not basil, no flavor, nothing. The baggets were burnt to a crisp, so I would not recommend getting that. The family style salad that you get with you entrees in a JOKE!! The size is small, (there were three of us total) and it was noting but lettuce and tomatoes drizzled in olive oil. Would not recommend this at all either.

Entrees were good, I ordered the Chicken w/ artichokes but thought it was a little pricy for the two small breast they give you, plus they ask you to not alter the dishes in anyway, so I couldn't substitute veggies for pasta. 

While eating dinner the sun began blaring in our eyes and the waiter jokenly said, ""I hate this time of day."" Din't offer to draw the blinds down, nothing. We must have sat with the sun in our eyes for a couple of minutes before I finally got up and asked the hostess to place close them; she reluctantly did it. 

Overall this was a bad experience from the hostess, to the server and to the food. I know my family and I will not be going back.",R_1T3a5czSrdXL07A2wzDA,4,0,2,5mu16PM-dYA34nh5PcLkZg

5065526,2015-09-29,0,FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg,"I really wanted to like this place, but now that I have experienced it, I will not return. 

I kept seeing this restaurant on Facebook and looking at their page, it seems to be a wonderful family owned business with delicious food, so I really wanted to check it out. I finally got a sitter and confirmed that they would be open for lunch on Saturday. We got there at 11:15 am, and no one was there. The girl working at the shop next door said they would open soon, so we decided to wait around. After 30 minutes, we decided to go somewhere else. I was disappointed that after confirming opening time the day before, we still wasted a trip and time. When I expressed my disappointment to the restaurant in a message, there was no reply.

Well, I keep seeing these pictures and posts on Facebook, so I thought we'd give it another try. Arrived at 5:15 on a Monday night. The hostess just gave us a blank stare and finally after a couple of minutes, welcomed us and took us to our booth. She seemed confused the whole night...not really sure what her mind was on, but it certainly wasn't her job. She was really just acting strange. After we were seated, there was no server for a while and the hostess came back over and fumbled around with the chef special, menus, etc. Our server finally took our drink order. There was only 1 other table of guests, by the way, so definitely not busy. 10 minutes later our server came out and took our order. He was great and even offered to bring out the kid's meal with the appetizer. Those came out in about 15 minutes, delicious and hot. Then we sat for 30 minutes. Finally the server came back out with garlic bread and salad (aka romaine with dressing and 4 pieces of diced tomato...do not pay the extra $4 for this!). At that point, a new server took over our server's shift. (The new server was not friendly, and it was obvious he didn't want to be there). At 6:30 (1hr15min after arrival), the hostess came to our table and said, ""Do you need boxes, or what's going on here?"" Wow. rude. I responded with, ""We haven't even gotten our main course yet."" She said, ""Oh yeah, I saw your food sitting in there, I'll get it."" 8 minutes later, the server comes out and mumbles something about the chef didn't think the food looked right, so he made it again. Seemed like a cover story, especially since my food was lukewarm. At that point we just asked him to box up our mediocre food and bring the check. We were finally out of there at 6:50. To make matters worse, the restroom needed attention. One faucet was totally broken off and laying in the sink. The other sink had vomit in it. The paper towels were all jammed. 

The few pros were our 1st server, large kids' portions, good pizza and fried mozz, and the ambiance. I only wish we could have seen the game, but the only TV was by the bar, and since we had children along, we sat in the regular dining area. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make me ever want to come back. We will definitely stick with Bravo! at the Galleria.",YyF4Sk0_eTaD1Xl6GaaxEA,0,0,1,ihK4Moij1XUFRxjwqsMAFg

5127978,2014-08-09,0,FhVYpbvE8IQeUHAcwPPIXg,"(Actual score: 2.5/5)
Food was okay at best, either hit or miss. While I certainly liked the Italian nachos and the garlic bread, I didn't like the chicken parmesan. I thought the spaghetti wasn't that appetizing, and the chicken was a bit overcooked and dry.

The only reason why this review doesn't have a higher score is because of the plate-sharing fee. It's not because of the cost of the fee - it was $4 if you wanted to share your plate with someone. I was with a group of friends, and the waiter decided not to tell us about the fee until after we were done with our food. It would be completely understandable except for the fact that the waiter was standing right in front of us when we verbally decided to share food at the beginning of our time there.

As we arrived we were greeted immediately in a booth toward the back. Our waiter was prompt to come and get our drink order. Okay, so here is my first issue, in the front of restaurant is a sign that says craft drafts happy hour $2.50. I requested one of the happy hour drafts and was told that was in the bar only. That was not stated on the sign. So I opted out of the beer, not because I am cheap or they were expensive but it does not make sense that that deal not extended 10 feet into restaurant. I would have had 2 beers with dinner a loss for them of $5.00 I ordered a diet coke with unlimited refills. I did ask waiter if I could walk to the bar order a beer and bring it to my table and he said he was unaware of that. 

Food. We ordered Chicken Alfredo for me and Josie had the Clams in white wine sauce. Meal comes with a salad and bread sticks. Bread sticks are average for an Italian restaurant. The salad was standard oil and vinegar. It tasted a bit salty and very oily. It needed, for me, grated Parmesan. Gilbert our waiter did not ask if we desired a grated cheese for our salad. The waitress serving the table behind us asked immediately of the guests at her table if cheese was desired for salad. Maybe it is supposed to be asked or she is just more thoughtful that way. 

We have discovered that we are spoiled by Pasta Mia our favorite Italian place. Josie's clams were very garlic filed and also had onions. Not sure about recipes for white wine sauces and the inclusion of onions. Other than that it was good. My chicken Alfredo was tasty and contained copious amounts of chicken. It was cheesy and filling. One negative, it did seem a little over salted for my taste. I would like to go back however I hope if they offer a happy hour it transfers to restaurant as well.

Take a moment to check out the history and take note that per our server, the ovens were transported  all the way from the motherland herself, Italy. 

FOOD tips- all I can say is that everything on the menu looks delicious. Our meals were wonderful: CHICKEN SALTIMBOCCA AND LASANGA. They give you bread, but if you order a ""flight"" of wine, you get cheese and meats, and do not need to order appetizers. I high recommend ordering that as part of your meal. The menu is varied, so I feel like you have to try something new each time you visit.
