The waiters. Eh...could have been better. Slightly friendly but very unattentive. Maybe cuz they were about to close when we got there. Ha.
I think it's a 2 different restaruants in 1? Not sure...have to check on that.
The food was decent but filling. We ordered a 5 combo and a quesadilla and we could not move after eating. One of my friends even ordered the gigantic margarita, which he had to take togo.
I couldn't even drink after this meal.
Cheap and filling for vegas, not for picky eaters.",ZGT9H35Edi4y8rHYSqSKfg,1,0,3,-gsQBd2Z9n3o0yYqQlu6HA

In fact, for the first 10 minutes there wasn't even a chef.  Our waiter took our orders - house margaritas and combo pan roasts that include crab, shrimp and scallops.  The chef finally made an appearance and both his demeanor and facial expression suggested he would have been happier having a root canal.  Prices have increased since our last visit.  There was a lot of seafood in the pan roasts, but we agreed these just aren't as good as in the past.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,1,0,2,x_8tVvo336SGWPioXQOVsQ

blue agave looked good 
gardunos looked like gross tex-mex chain
 
Brette: yes

me: so my boss wants blue agave too
and we meet downstairs to find it
and we walk by gardunos
 
Brette: ok

me: it looks gross
and we end up going around the entire casino floor
NO BLUE AGAVE!
so we ask a Palms employee

Brette: ok...
 
me: and he says, ""See the neon tequila sign?""
""It's there""
Oh...ok So this place is right next to Gardunos, and there's no sign
so we walk up and get seated
we're excited for Blue Agave

Brette: ok

me: So we get our menus, and what does it say on the cover? Where are we?
GARDUNOS!
wtf
 
Brette: oy
what'd you do?
 
me: stayed
apparently, blue agave is the special menu at Gardunos
the stuff you saw online (Palms website)
 
Brette: that doesn't make sense?
was it mediocre?
 
me: terrible
 
Brette: oy
 
me: terrible
I was wondering why there was only one yelp review of blue agave
when I was researching in my room
 
Brette: i hope there are 2 now

me: now I know.
The Palms website deceives!
 
Brette: dude, you gotta yelp that
 
me: maybe I'll just copy and paste this chat in there

Brette: haha
it's not worthy of an actual review
 
me: But I'll get lots of ""funny"" and ""cool""
and maybe some ""useful""

Brette: haha",Eh89gt0UYgfmF8hr7tPV4g,5,7,1,h2rE3n4KQT1lZt9bjRtZEQ
5587060,2010-10-25,1,2GfKCR3S8I2m0iiyEd3sKA,"The Blue Agave is theoretically the seafood side of the Mexican restaurant, Gardunos, at the south side of the casino. I have friends in the Palms management but I'll tell them the same thing I'm telling you: This is a horrible mistake. 
First time I went there (in the company of a columnist for Nevada's biggest circulation paper) I found it very difficult to find service. Finally I was able to order a been and a dozen oysters. The chef literally rinsed the oysters in water. Don't try that at home. Tastes even worse than it sounds.
Second time I went there during a three-day alternative music festival. I was dying for some seafood - but should have hit the buffet. Again, sitting at the bar waiting for someone to take my order. It took about 15 minutes for one of the floor waitresses to come by with a menu, half of which was unavailable. (One of the reasons I sat at the bar, or sit at the bar on any night, is for quick service. A huge mistake there.)
I ordered a mixed seafood roast, which is a creamy thing most of the casinos have at their seafood bars. It can be quite tasty. In this case, I actually received their version of seafood gumbo, which I grudgingly ate anyway despite a passing resemblence to cat vomit.
Also, the margaritas are terrible. 
The coolest thing about this place is that all the rock and roll people who wandered in there while I was there had something to laugh about that weekend. Seriously, you will ask out loud if there is service available and then you will wish you hadn't.",soG9o5PqmXilKJHpAB777A,1,1,1,2U304nv3dYnYFBMHxODRtw
