1) We already know you are expensive!  $$$$
2) Expired meats/seafood common.  FOUL!  Beware of the orange labeled markdowns!  They may be past expiration or tainted !  Had to throw mine in the garbage, amount EXCEEDED the REFUND policy. Beware!
3) Produce inconsistent , sometimes fresh sometimes not.  Must inspect closely.
4) Deli?  Closes early  and the staff apologizes because they are behind schedule and how much work it is for one person!  I feel sorry for them! Prepping sandwiches on a cart next to the cooler on the main floor?   Seriously?
5) Purchased pre made sandwiches, found a PIGEON bird feather nestled inside. EWWW!
6) Beware of the hummus with the Haggen label in the ""non"" tamper proof containers! 
7) Roses died in 2 days after purchase!  :-(  
8) Management, why don't you respond to the YELPERS?  
9) Is there a loyalty program in place?  Soon, you will LOSE your customer base if this nonsense continues.
10) Perhaps the SNHD should be notified of the public health issues that are ABUNDANT?",w4SSyHI0vNnv8wKEtRv9EQ,7,0,1,0ROqekS4EBzufjas924-uw

465923,2015-06-22,1,JC7HF7jRVqULhTOTE2n6ug,"Summerlin, Las Vegas is a sophisticated community with lots of sizzle, competition, and grocery store options. Haggens is extremely disappointing. Having shopped in the Trails for over 13 years, I really was shocked by the obvious lack of homework done by the Haggens transition team. 

1) More expensive - no comparative pricing! Much more expensive than Vons. If I want to pay more for specialty items or organic, I'd go to Whole Foods, Trader Joes, or Sprouts - all of which has more ambiance. personality, and warmth. Do your homework Haggens! See what pricing Smith's, Walmart and Albertson's are offering for key grocery staples. Vons was a neighborhood grocery store. Haggens as it opened is not. 

2). No community interaction! When you open a store with new brands and product, it is critical to develop relationships. A few Interactions with the customers through sampling would go far to connect Haggen's new brands with a new community. 

3) Limited choices! I found many of my favorite national brands had reduced shelf real estate and I couldn't find favorite product - (including Oikos chocolate strawberry/raspberry yogurt.) (I understand why Vons/Safeway products would not be there... but replace like for like.) 

4) No suggestion card at the cash register or question from the cashier... Did you find what you were looking for? 

5) Sterile non-energetic ambiance. While bright and clean are good qualities, the new store seemed anemic and bare. Even the new piped in 'mu-sack' was a yawner.

I was really looking forward to a bright new neighborhood grocery store which Haggens is not....at least not yet. So our family did something they haven't done since we moved to Las Vegas. We drove 5 minutes out of our way and went to Smith's.",DHA-cIv8OlxDuQfIK1LSbw,11,2,1,A2TTpqBU68aDdTmk7UH3TA

Prices are about 1/3 higher than Vons & other competitors, sale items in advertised flyers are merely higher or regular prices elsewhere, bakery items are scarce & look dry & unappealing besides being pricier, produce & bakery has all been significantly reduced & sparse, everything else looks similar with brighter lighting and MUCH higher prices, less selection and poor customer service despite several employees just hanging around the service desk talking & laughing with each other.  I had asked for a raincheck for the single item I came in for & it was a major ordeal for the manager to issue it despite them being out of it.  No grand opening ""hoopla""or anything to welcome customers to its new stores in new communities.  What a total disappointment!  Will be counting the days, along with everyone I know who used to shop at Vons & has been to Haggen, until the store is hopefully acquired again by a company that cares about the shopping experience, competitiveness and its customers.

693042,2015-07-05,0,JC7HF7jRVqULhTOTE2n6ug,"I've been shopping at Von's at the Trails Center, Summerlin since it opened and most often very much enjoyed my shopping experience. I can only say that in my opinion and experience that the prices overall at Haggen are SUBSTANTIALLY more expensive compared to that of Von's as well as competing area stores, and without any noticeable difference to me in terms of the quality or the atmosphere within the store itself, although the store in fact appears to me to be more barren and deserted.

Mostly, I am referring to brand name products where from my perspective Haggen has ridiculously raised prices dramatically. In my opinion this store cannot even be compared to many of the higher end and specialty markets in Las Vegas where I would now prefer to shop if I must pay Haggen prices.

Furthermore, Haggen seems not to be stocking many of the items that I had enjoyed and have become accustomed to purchasing over the years; I sincerely doubt that this store will thrive in our community if it continues in my opinion with an extremely outrageous pricing policy. They have lost this customer despite it being a convenient location in which to shop. I reiterate that I am totally shocked by their prices! Their staff is as nice and as kind as always, virtually the same Von's employees, but I can somewhat sense the staff's own dismay and perhaps disappointment at the lack of traffic and the new Haggen pricing as well.

Additionally, I am discouraged that I have not seen a response from the Haggen management team to many of the online negative reviews. Perhaps they are not concerned despite the fact that they still have an opportunity to make this a great store and win back the loyal Von's customer and neighborhood consumer.",ZZIKurSpcKBFJpgIu5-W_g,9,1,1,NQcNDFfjdSaCeubV1Gbcrg

The prices are astronomical, the selection is horrible and many of the items I went specifically to Vons to buy are gone.  I was forced to go to Haggen today as I was running late to a dinner party and it was the nearest grocery store.  I went in to buy a couple of bottles of wine to take to give to the hostess and prices were insane, $54.00 for a bottle of mediocre California cabernet.  Then I discovered they had no gift bags to fit a wine bottle.  Vons used to have gift bags and tags and ribbons right in the alcohol section, which was convenient and made sense.  No such luck with Haggen, they had removed the gift bags from the liquor section and had no bags to fit a bottle of wine in their cards and gift wrap section.  I had to go to another store!!

I've shopped at Von's at The Trails in Summerlin since it opened.....spent thousands and thousands of dollars there over the years.  It's only a few blocks from my house.  Then Haggens comes in June....high prices, many of my favorite items discontinued, and produce that's rock hard.  Long-time employees say it will get better, so I wait.  Most of my neighbors quit shopping there during the summer.
So, recently, the shelves are almost bare.  But, today, I go in and it's the last straw....there's no bread....NO bread!  Maybe half a dozen loafs and couple packages of buns.  When questioned, the girl in the department says they're just waiting for a bread truck.  Another gentleman and I laugh and comment that this is crazy.....there's hardly anything in the whole store!  She responds rudely so I decide to speak to a manager.
I wait and I wait, and I wait......Cory is called 3 times and is in the back of the store.....can't be bothered to come to the front and talk to me, so I leave.  This is the same Cory who was offended when I suggested they have someone working in the meat department on Saturdays so people could get meat from the meat counter.
The most disappointing thing was that long time employees, whom I've known for years, did not seem to care that the store's condition was so unacceptable....Cory certainly didn't care if he lost a long-time customer.  
I left and drove to Smith's.....I won't step foot in that store again.",rJiSmeFwfAIf5-wYAVA_4w,5,1,1,XcS21zQX3Tc1zcn2iufY_g

But the atmosphere is sterile, the prices are higher, and the Von's bakery I adored now hangs its baked bagels on a hook or rod.  I found out those very bagels are too ""hard"" also.  Maybe that's from them being on a hook, or maybe that's a new Haggen recipe.  So that's a negative change.  Before, I truly was grateful for Von's Just4U which enabled me to shop online and pre-select items before going into the store.  I truly was grateful for the gas rewards.  Haggen does not have either and I believe their prices overall are higher than Von's or other competing stores.  So I only go there now out of sheer convenience, and the closest remaining Von's stores in Las Vegas are not close to me at all.  Well, there is always change in life, and I always am critical of myself for not accepting some of it---but I wish my little Von's store had not gone away.",7cn5DQNDKU2xutZj9MVLQA,20,2,1,g6wzIsMceD0Bx1p7Z-VFTA

1769788,2015-07-27,4,JC7HF7jRVqULhTOTE2n6ug,"I've only been in a few times, because it's hard to disassociate that location with Vons.  I never cared for Vons- the Vons produce was generally horrid and the Vons check-out lanes were always backed up and slow.  Well, I went back to Haggen yesterday, and the produce stocker proactively asked if he could help me find something - I was never asked that when it was a Vons.  And, the Haggen brands of cheese and ice cream have been pretty good.  The selection of craft beer is better, and so is the selection and overall quality of produce.  And, the checkout lanes have been faster every time I've been in there.

I'm not sure if Haggen has clearly defined its place in the market; it's supposed to be better quality and service than Vons/Smiths/Albertsons, and thus higher prices on some items.  But, they're not striving to be a Whole Foods. 

Will I buy everything here?  Probably not, but I never have given all my grocery business to one store. There are some good deals to find here, and for the over-priced items, I don't mind driving 5-10 minutes to shop for them.  And, I realize that you can't transform an entire philosophy in 2 days, or 2 weeks or 2 months.  The transition is a process.

However with new management, they decided to expand out of their comfort zone, which is a great thing! However, they did it so quick. They bought a lot of Albertsons and Vons in Nevada and California. They bought a lot so fast at a short time, that they went bankrupt and have to close a lot of stores down. So within months, they were already a failure waiting to happen. The location at this place used to be Vons. Prices were already higher than leading competition such as Smiths & Albertsons, but to add insult with the buy out...Haggens did not key into saving consumers and customer satisfaction.  Vons had high prices but kept value all around and kept customers still shopping. Haggens was greedy and wanted more. Now management is just as important, but am sure corporate had much more to do with the failure of this grocery chain to thrive in such a beautiful heart location of Summerlin.

We went to the bakery and they have the bagels hanging on hooks?! I tried one of the jalapeno bagels, tasted bland, heavy and it didn't have that yummy crispy cheese edge like Vons used to make them. My son didn't like his donut and threw it away! My kids used to love the Vons donuts. On the up side we probably shouldn't be eating those thing anyway so thanks for that. oh and a side note, didn't care for the country music either. The lady ahead of us in line didn't like it so much she was asking the cashier where the closest Vons was so she could go there.",0HIsd69imfTwTPG7BceoBQ,1,1,1,MU06F8Ofv6necsbjl5IKIQ

4641279,2015-08-03,1,JC7HF7jRVqULhTOTE2n6ug,I have been a loyal customer of Von's at this location for 14 years. Change the name and increase the prices by 35%? Really? Albertson's and Smith's will get more regular business and the people already loyal to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's stay there. I miss Von's and refuse to pay the ridiculous prices offered here. I am voting with my feet and will not be back until Von's buys the location back.,8zH_1DJ3QLNliC9d5bUGbA,7,1,1,AJ2n_me6GtqbsuPCRRKp0A

I wonder how long it's been sitting on a shelf. Well, at least I'm gonna get my money back later today when I return in. Please bring back Vons. This place royally sucks!

P.S. The only chilled white wine they have is Chardonnay. Seriously people? Some of us prefer to drink Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc!!!

Update: I returned my watermelon and got money back. However, the guy who packs bags at the register, made sure to tell me to check the watermelon for hardness next time to avoid getting a bad one. Really??!!! How about Haggen checks their produce section for rotting products next time? What a joke this place is!",PchA9aLWOG7fwFUAVlVQgw,7,0,1,QNNZCt9HFGAVGzfgzopr5A

Did not return except once and the grave stocking manager Sonny greeted me warmly and really tried to convince me to return . What is wrong with corporations who come in spend four months here and close. Shame on you Haggens for not putting in the effort! You took the number one grossing store at Von's and turned it into a ""ghost town"" your management with the exception of Sonny who is exceptional stinks. The pricing structure is insane this is an organization who wrote the book on how NOT to succeed in business.",PUUCBNCIdCJDKtk6iaiQpQ,0,0,1,ne40JuZ60YT5ygDGRLJSuQ

Once upon a time we have a great Vons location here in Summerlin where Summerliner's happily shopped.  Apparently Haggen's thought they could buy a bunch of Vons locations, slap green signs everywhere, and charge Whole Food's prices for either the same or inferior products.  Well, it looks like they were wrong.  Anyone who regularly shopped here when it was Vons would know that the location,while not as busy as some grocery stores in town (which was a good thing), would immediately notice that this store is nearly empty all the time. What a shame.  Bring our Vons back!

5078235,2015-08-02,4,JC7HF7jRVqULhTOTE2n6ug,"As a former resident of western Washington,  I feel it's necessary to make it clear that this ""Haggen"" is no Haggen. This location (and I'm assuming the others in the valley) lacks the pieces that make Haggen awesome--the delightfully complicated floor plan, the wide selection of specialty and organic food, wonderful and fresh produce, and a made-to-order deli with sandwiches, sushi, and salad/cheese/olive bar that was a regular lunch staple for me! (If any east coasters are familiar with Wegmans, Haggen is like a west coast Wegmans.) Sure, when money was a little tight I would go to Haggen just for meat, produce and a meal from the deli and pick up the other pantry staples somewhere cheaper, but the prices I paid for those items were well worth the extra cost. Here, though, the produce was overpriced and low quality, the deli was absolutely nothing like how it should be, and we found expired milk and bread. :(

My husband and I were so excited when we got the mailers, thinking we could return to our favorite grocery store from WA. However, this location is basically (probably literally) an old Vons that they put no effort into making a real Haggen; they just slapped some Haggen signs throughout. I was disappointed and will continue shopping at Sprouts on W. Sahara.",3Hfw-nd6WQ3VB7wKiyjlkg,8,1,2,d7oG90jpRHrzMxcrj9mjYQ

My girlfriend has been a long time shopper of VONS and was not excited when she found out that Haggen replaced VONS. We gave it a chance and have been shopping there for about a month with hope that things will get better....
Poor customer service, prices are average to high when compared to VONS and food quality poor (my rotten salad). My recommendation , either buy processed/frozen items to avoid rotten or moldy food....or take a short drive to Smiths on Charleston. Won't be back.",VGY9BGKX4eOJCzNlScz1oQ,10,0,1,_2_s4wDttZ68wJlibOBFTw
