I always order the chicken won ton tacos for appetizers...and this location served a naked chicken taco with no veggies.  When I asked the server about the missing veggies, she said we ran out of coleslaw.  Instead of telling that to us in the beginning...so we could decide if we still want to order it...they serve it without any mention.  That's pathetic.  So, two of our dinners are supposed to come with slaw...again, no mention.  So, I ask for a side salad to take its place..the server says he'll have to ask the manager...pausing...hoping I would pass it up.  So, I tell him to yes, GO ask your manager.  He makes the decision to get a salad anyway...then smiles at me and said, ""No Charge""....I told him, it better not be...it shouldn't be charged.  Another dinner was missing its garlic bread...which we had to ask twice for..by then the pasta was 2/3 eaten.  We had to bring our cups to the bar to get refilled....

We were like WHAT! So we had to wipe the table!!! Then about 25 mins later she starts to bring our meal out, I had to ask her for our appetizer...keep in mind our dinner has already arrived and on the table! We had to wait another 5 mins to get our appetizer.. Mozzarella Sticks...that tasted like freezer burn water sticks! The prime rib was over cooked and the mashed potatoes were dry and their asparagus was so thin and greasy! ick! the other dish we order was new york steak with fried shrimp...the steak was tough and the shrimp..there was no shrimp! it was just a ball of overcooked batter, we also order chicken and veggies which the chicken was not cooked and still rare and the veggies were greasy! I order the Roaster Turkey & Bacon on a Chibatta Bread with fries...the fries had so much salt on them it was unbearable to eat and the sandwich..well you get the picture how this is all going! It took her another 15 minutes to check us out!

1466165,2014-12-14,0,86stmK3Vm2f5W6PdyvuLrQ,"At one point this Applebees deserved the five stars. I came in last night to see some old familiar faces. My first impression. The poor hostess Erica being picked on by new staff members that I haven't even seen a month ago. It seemed like she was about to cry. I remember seeing Vanessa working there before she was pregnant and I remember everyone helping her out because it was the right thing to do. Yesterday we all watched an 8 months pregnant woman, the same Vanessa, cleaning up vomit for a table that left her a 5%, $6 tip... All while the general manager, Susan or what's her name, I have also not seen her there a month ago, sat in the bar talking to the new guy who also seemed to neglect his guests at one point. I hope Vanessa didn't get sick and jeopardize her child's well being after last night. 
I sat in Sabrina's section, which is weird because I haven't seen her not bartend on over a year and now they have people in there that I don't only recognize, but I watched Ted overpour liquor, it took me a long time to get my one beer. The bar looked like absolute shit and people were not enjoying their time while trying to dine. 
I know that Sabrina injured her elbow and ended up having nerve damage at work a couple of months ago. Her doctor, the workmans comp doctor, set up restrictions for her, such as not lifting over 5lbs. I saw her carrying 3 plates that weighed way more than that... She was carrying those plates to someone other servers table. The general manager was walking ahead of her carrying two circle plates that collectively weighed about one third of what Sabrina was carrying. So after Sabrina was injured at work, she was forced to finish working her shift, then she was forced to keep closing and working through pain the next week, until the doctors set the restrictions, after which now all I see is that she is not ""bartending"" but instead serving... And running everyone's food, and expenditure everyone food, and helping the new worthless bartenders ale drinks that they are either too slow to make or they don't know how to. 
Every time I come back to this Applebee's I see the environment get worse, the staff get worse, and all the really incredible servers and bartenders that I have met there through the years leave and get replaced by people who clearly should not be in the industry. I hope apple American looks at their numbers and sees who were the best check average holders and liquor sellers and who had the best guest reviews throughout the full 2014, and then look at who's still there. Hardly anyone. It's truly upsetting how much I liked the Boca Park Applebees, but the fact is there are so many employee rights, and safety violations that it's absolutely ridiculous. I've seen people work 8 hours without a drink or any food. No one helps each other out. Management makes injured and sick people work, aside from Sabrina working with this injury, I remember about 6 months ago she was working through blood poisoning and was getting yelled at and pushed around... And yes they were aware. I hope they close this restaurant down and compensate all of the employees properly. It's so horrible there that the gm was demoted and transferred, and another one who doesn't know her job that well and one who doesn't understand human needs, even less so than any other managers there in the past. I hope corporate sees this, and I hope this company starts treating its employees like human beings. I shouldn't have to frequently see health code violations, apple American standard violations, employee rights violations, employee safety violations, harassment, employees crying, and managers not giving a hand to pregnant and injured employees. You're losing all the people that made Applebee's good and replacing them with horseshit. The restaurant even brings in completely different clientele, I've seen and heard of more walk outs and unreasonable complaints there than I have ever before. Shitty service brings in shitty clientele. Shitty managers bring in shitty servers and drive good ones away, which also brings in turn also brings in shitty clientele, and makes sure that the company loses money in the end.

I got the Classic Burger which to my disappointment was rather plain and very average tasting. Even after I spruced it up with lettuce, onions, tomato, ketchup and mustard it was still very bland, I think in part it was because the meat was burned. 

They do have this new lemonade which is really good. It is a strawberry lemonade with real strawberry slices in it.

After being seated, we waited 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. I HATE that. Why can't someone come by and say ""Hi, I'm busy and I will be with you shortly."" I dislike having to look around the restaurant thinking where the hell is this dude? When he finally showed up, we were ready to order.

There was a menu insert that had $10 entrees on it, so we decided to each get a meal from that and also share an appetizer plate. We ordered the crunchy boneIN buffalo wings, and the kobe meatballs for appetizers. The wings were good, but the meatballs weren't, and they were cold in the middle. Kobe my ass! We sent those back and asked for another order of the same wings. Tell me why they brought us boneless BBQ wings to the table? WTF. How hard is it, really? We didn't feel like complaining again so we just ate them. A few minutes later though, the manager brought by the boneIN buffalo wings and we told her they had already given us the bbq ones so we ate those instead. She was a real peach tho, and she told us to keep the buffalo wings anyway. Also, for the inconvenience she took one of the appetizers off the bill AND gave us a small discount on top of that. This is likely the only reason I am giving this place 2 stars.

As far as our lunches, I enjoyed my boyfriends more than mine. The brewhouse chicken was a chicken cutlet sitting on a mountain of mashed potatoes with cheese and crispy fried onions. It came with stout gravy which he got on the side. My steak was ok, not very flavorful but cooked perfectly medium. It came with a roasted onion, roasted tomato, roasted potatoes and a ton of stout gravy. The gravy was a little too salty, but it made an otherwise bland dish edible.

Applebees seems to be abundant in Vegas however and so it seemed like the perfect thing to do to bring the gift card on a recent Vegas trip. 

I ate lunch at this Applebee's location with my mom and we got the 2 for $20 deal. This actually turned out to be quite a good deal because it's plenty of food. You get your pick of an appetizer to share an two full sized entrees. 

We got the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer and for our entrees we got the Oriental Chicken Salad and the Three Cheese Chicken Penne. 

The appetizer came out first and was actually best eaten right away. The tortilla chips were fresh, hot and crispy and matched perfectly with the piping hot spinach and artichoke dip. I was happy to see some big chunks of artichoke in there. It was good but after awhile, I could taste that the dip was a bit on the salty side and this could probably be attributed to the cheese. 

My mom and I split our entrees. The Oriental Chicken Salad turned out to be a lot of food. It was very good. The dressing was nice and sweet. Fresh Asian greens tossed in a their Oriental vinaigrette and topped with crispy noodles, almonds and chicken, it was a great salad. You can choose to get crispy chicken or grilled and we chose grilled. 

The three cheese chicken penne turned out to be my least favorite of all the entrees. It was all pasta and barely any chicken. The chicken was just on top and there really wasn't a lot of cheese. It's supposed to have mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan, along with bruschetta, fresh basil and Alfredo sauce. I don't think the ratio of the toppings and the chicken with the pasta was too well done. The whole pasta seemed dry. 

Anyways it was an OK experience here! I'm glad we finally got to use the gift card and it was plenty of food. It lasted us for both lunch and dinner!",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,8,6,3,okilj_jVkdrPkBFFaatN2A

I think the pick-and-pair lunch menu is a bit of a rip-off because they charge extra for pasta and sandwiches, and really 5.99 for soup/salad is nothing fucking special, you know? You should get the 2 for 20 deal instead: it comes with an appetizer. They do a lot of advertising which has convinced Middle America that they are very affordable but to be honest there are a lot of sit-down luncheon type chains that are in this area that are comparatively priced.

Still if you're jonsing hard for Applebee's, like my mom, this one is a pretty decent Applebee's. It makes her happy when I take her here, even if I don't like it that much. And that's kind of what matters.",BemKKkZBBmu9GupEwKBj9g,1,1,3,SChqELN8TaNeTlt_undCkw

However, the chef here needs to find another job, not around food. 3 of us ordered the 2 for $11 Vidalia onion steak combo... two with linguine and one with the Margarita chicken. 1 steak rare, one medium rare, one well done. And a children's steak, well done with applesauce. 

The well done steak was cooked perfectly.
The rare steak was cook a little more than expected.
The medium rare steak was ""blue rare""... inedible. 
The children's steak was raaaaaare... and came out 5 minutes after the rest of our food.

Sent back the children's and the medium rare.
Children's came back medium, at best.
Medium rare came out, a brand new steak, more rare than the first time. It's like they never even cooked it. Sent back a 2nd time.

Called the manager over, took my entree and my son's entree, the issue dishes, off the bill completely. Everyone was quite apologetic. Our server was OVER apologetic,  it was saccharine. 

Finally, the 3rd time that they brought out my steak, it was charred on the outside.  At least it was cooked on the inside.

I felt that the portions were small and the food too high priced. Fortunately, with recent visits to 3 different Applebee's locations in Las Vegas, my impressions have changed.

My wife and I have found Applebee's to be surprisingly affordable and delicious. The 2 for $20 specials are a real value! Also, we really enjoyed splitting a bourbon black and blue burger w/ bacon along with an order of chips and artichoke dip. We both have moderate appetites and were filled up after this meal. 

All three locations were very similar with good food and service and we would return to either of them.

I called and ordered a 2 for $20.  I ordered the mozzarella sticks for the appetizer and I got the Fiesta Lime chicken for my wife and I got the three cheese chicken penne for myself.  They told me it would be twenty minutes.  

As it turned out, traffic moved well along Charleston heading west and I was at Applebee's in about 10 minutes.  Rather than wait in the car, I went in to let them know I was there and to pay.

The young man working the carside said it would be ready soon and then went to pull the order in the computer.  He couldn't find it and needed to get his manager.  As this was happening, Josh got the order ready but the manager still couldn't retrieve it.  Rather than have me wait, she told me she'd find it later and I should just take the meals home and she wished me a Merry Christmas.  I was taken back by her kindness.

I brought the food home and we both enjoyed our dinners very much.  The chicken is a dish my wife has gotten almost every time we've gone to an Applebee's and it was a treat to have it again.  The penne was very good.  It had some red pepper that gave it a nice kick.  

The next day, I was still upset by getting free meals so I went back to pay.  The same manager came to talk to me and assure me it was OK the way things were.

After driving past this Applebee's numerous times in the Boca Park shopping center, we decided to give it a try. 

A hostess (Sandy? - she may have been a server as well) held the door open as we walked in and welcomed us. She promptly brought us to a great booth and informed us that Scott would be our waiter, provided us menus and  asked us to please enjoy our evening.

The restaurant, tables and floors were all clean and holiday music was playing just loud enough that if you wanted to listen, you could, but wasn't so overpowering you weren't able to have a conversation. 

Scott came over and greeted us. He was friendly and engaging, and we were very pleased with him and our conversation throughout the evening. I highly recommend visiting and requesting this knowledgeable and engaging server.

The food came out in sequential order, fresh, hot and delicious. Our son's meal - which we ordered with the appetizer - actually beat the appetizer out. As any parent will tell you, that was a welcome surprise as know that our little one was occupied with his favorite things, the parent were able to have adult conversations and enjoy our drinks and appetizer.  

As parents of a toddler, we were in no rush to return home on one of our few nights out. We leisurely ate our appetizer and though he had  our dinner orders, Scott held entering them into the kitchen until we were ready. 

I ordered a steak-shrimp combo from the 550-calorie menu and my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. We ordered both items medium and the meats were cooked perfectly. Our son's burger was also done properly and served in a basket that was not hot to the touch (unlike some restaurants that forget that they're delivering plates to tiny tender hands).

Scott kept the table clean and neat throughout our dining experience and was always right on hand when we needed something like a refill or extra napkins. Not once did we have to look around to find him or deal with an empty glass or dirty plate. He was attentive and thoughtful in all his actions. As veterans of the restaurant biz, my husband and I were impressed and appreciative.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Applebee's and plan on making this a monthly outing for the family (at minimum). We can't wait to return and look forward to another quality dining experience with a great team of FOH and BOH there.

Thanks, Applebee's, for making family night out delicious and delightful.  Every member of our family came home happy and full.  Special thanks to Scott as well. Can't wait to see you next time!

She messed up the girls behind us order at least twice and talked them like she knew more about how they wanted their food cooked than she did. They sent there steak back twice to be recooked. 

We kept trying to get our bill to pay and leave an couldn't get her attention. And again no manager available to help.

After several minutes and finding out I was the third person to call them on this just this week, I am told we would get a gift card from them for wasting our time and money on that horrible dinner!  That was 1/10/17, here we are 2/13/17 and still nothing! I guess they figure those of us who complained are small enough, no need to worry. Well I work for a big doctors office here and so does my daughter. My son in law works on the strip. WORD of Mouth folks. Not a good place to eat!!!!!",qGXz_ojQIYJrNzjBpLQteQ,0,0,1,O1yIosueTzfFLFld4IYOqA

I don't like having an empty glass while I'm at a restaurant, you would figure on a slow Monday night service would be a bit better.  We walked in and no greeter was there, no line of people either.  When asking for sauce it shouldn't arrive after your food has gotten cold.  Dirty silverware is always a turn off.  Not that we were planning on getting dessert it wasn't even offered before our waiter brought the check.  Actually it was never offered.  Most likely our last visit here, now I remember why we quit coming here, usually get bad service at Applebees.",RHkNEB3nixpJrEXu3PDltw,2,0,1,DD-BT3JFLLyxa8k9IVRIbQ

What impressed me most about this particular one was that after a LARGE group of teenage girls (I'm talkin' 15-20 girls) was seated right next to us, the manager came over to our table and offered to seat us elsewhere if we preferred. We graciously declined since we were halfway through our meal, but it was a kind gesture!

Also, this was the first time trying their Crispy Orange Chicken and I was pleasantly surprised!",bKhfZoTppbT2cnnP38wiUw,0,0,4,kpVPG24sgKzbRA9bL58hpA
5302744,2016-08-25,0,86stmK3Vm2f5W6PdyvuLrQ,The appetizers are honestly the only thing worth going for...and maybe the car side service (and easy online ordering). But if you dine-in unfortunately be prepared to be disappointed. I loved Applebee's growing up and it's a shame this is the location closest to where I live now. The quality of the food is always below par. Steak? Forget about it. I heard an older gentleman at the next table tell the server it was the worst he's ever had in his life and I don't doubt that! The chicken is often not cooked well either. Like I said appetizers and maybe drinks...go ahead. Otherwise not worth it.,sxxL6TjvDolUE7GeWBRZrg,0,0,2,JZ_YUNTmDtVQTcKJWHSKIw

I don't think I would come here to eat.  I've had Applebee's a lot, and their food is always pretty mediocre.  The bar, however, isn't bad. 
Happy hour is 3-6pm and 9pm-close on weekdays, and all day on Sundays.  Don't quote me on this, but I believe the deal is  $3 domestic drafts, Long Island Iced Teas, House Margaritas, and $4 import drafts.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,0,0,3,AOz7N-x3uAn__x1eav67YQ

I had finished my work out and was craving the Oriental Chicken Salad so I placed an order and drove over to pick it up. 

When I arrived Bianca came out to verify my order. She knew exactly what I needed in terms of extras and promptly delivered. I noticed when she gave me the total it seemed a little cheaper than usual. I asked her again what the total was and then I asked her about the strawberry lemonade I had ordered and she informed me that she did not charge me! Wow! What a treat!

Her customer service was outstanding and I was so surprised at how personable she was! I made sure tip
her well for her great service!

Needless to say my meal was delicious and my lemonade was extra good! I will return to this location in the future and hope you give it a try too!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,2,0,5,geimDxgBA13zQLAk0Yop7g

I mean, she took our drink orders, came back with the drinks and took off. About 10 min. later she took our appetizers. She said she would be back for our dinner orders. Appetizers came out, we finished it and now waiting on our waitress to take our dinner order. About another 15 min after completing our appetizers, our waitress comes by to refill our drinks only to say she will be back for our dinner order. After waiting longer we finally get our dinner order in and food comes out quick. Everyone loved their food except 2 of us. Waitress didn't bother to come back to check on us. The manager came by and asked how we were and I wanted to say something. But some family members don't like confrontation so they would quickly say it was fine. Our waitress was there and present when it came to the check though. We were going to split the bill as discussed and give a 10% tip. Even though she was slow, it is not nice to leave no tip. As we were packing up to leave, I told my husband I can't believe she still has a job with how slow she is at waiting tables. I didn't realize how loud I was until another server chimed in and said our waitress is the manager's daughter and she gets away with everything. So yeah, food is okay, depending on what you order. Just don't be served by the managers daughter. Unless you have around over 2 hours of your time to dine.",JE1x4OOstyjkMqP9bHYd0w,0,0,1,WdgRRrwwXTPC1H50Hax5og
