Pulled up to the drive thru at 3:55 am on 4/9/2017 I get to the speaker box to place my order no greeting comes on nothing just silence not even an I'll be right with you just silence. So I waited about five minutes I figured that  they're probobly working on some kind of technical error in that moment. Finally I decide to speak up immediately I get a rude response were closed for 10 minutes. I replied OK I can wait it is now 4:02 I waited until about 4:17 am before the voice spoke again what do you want they asked. I replied a number twelve she replied what I spoke up a number 12. Then the conversation goes silent again so I responded that will be all the voice spoke again ""size"" I replied oh large that will be all. The voice responded what drink u said Dr Pepper so then they tell me to pull up to the first window where I see an employee with red hair sitting on the floor doing God knows what and another employee in the kitchen eating her life away. I doubt that this jack in the box will respond to any of the feed back left on here but to there loyal customers you guys need to know that there are much better branches with much better customer service just not this location avoid it at all costs. Save yourself the headache. never will I ever come back to this location.",r2cfdI_C7Wow1HiqpPPq6g,1,0,1,TvBIONhu7xwDmWBkF7wjHA

Ordered my food 3 times and she still got it wrong. Told her to scratch my order I'm coming inside. Not one customer in sight, employee and relative maybe sitting in left corner of store. 3 employees that I see behind the counter. Not 1 again not 1 came up to help or even stated we would be with you in a minute or anything like that. Finally someone comes to the counter I ask for the manager she says she is the PERSON IN CHARGE. So I ask for her name and the name of the person in the drive thru which she stated was her. So I asked her why she has such a bad attitude and she said I didn't have an attitude I couldn't hear you our headsets are bad. Not sorry our headsets are not working right like any professional would've said. At this point I'm pissed took her store number and name, left a message for corporate or distract manager, also sent an email regarding the incident. I will not be returning to this location EVER! So I spoke the manager on 8/23/16 come to find out she gave a false name, she said her name was Crystal and her name is really Claudia. So I guess this jack in the box employee thinks it's ok to Lie!",6JN3EEqeWnnblY7QGBA3Hg,1,0,1,3e7OpMdBgw6zEV_PeRmQFQ

I ordered 3 items in total but the guy got my order wrong. Drove up to the window to correct my order. The last item I ordered needed to be prepared so I patiently waited for about 15 minutes. I could see the staff in the back cooking while chatting with each other in Spanish and the window guy was doing something else. He returns and sees 3 items on the table and packed them in a bag and handed it to me. Normally I wouldn't look inside to make sure the order is correct, I would usually just check that the number of items is correct. When I get home, I find that not only my order was incorrect, they also forgot to give me the ranch dip i asked for. I went here after seeing their new items on TV (Wakey Bakey Hash, Hangry Chicken Hash) only to be disappointed by my drive thru experience but also the quality of the food. If you like the food I would suggest you go to another location, but avoid the Decatur/Trop location! Save yourself the headaches.",hsMp-QmXqUGDj21wMrwX0g,0,0,1,atSQyqgRGyp8c67el8A5FA
1498929,2013-09-25,0,FO_6o6BAs3s8yzd-gDh3jQ,I love this jack in the box location it's right near where I live each time I order food from here it is fresh and by fresh I mean meat just off the grill and fries just of the fryer fresh I like that never had my orders messed up from here the service might be a little slow but that is okay with me when you always get the food fresh and made right with no orders mixed up or wrong.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,1,0,4,Vg1JLbVxMlFQwKDhnZSXIw
1719927,2016-04-30,0,FO_6o6BAs3s8yzd-gDh3jQ,"I am not overly thrilled with this location to say the least. I rarely eat fast food, but when I do, this is one of the closest locations to home. The fresh home brewed tea is never fresh and they don't do anything about it or even apologize when asked to change it they just dump it out of my cup and refill sane cup that had sour old tea. I will not be returning here, employees seemed efficient and quick but not willing to deal with any issues. There is a problem with homeless or home depot day workers hanging around. No intention return to this location.",H0sRirabPHMsxw0WfyfhTQ,0,0,2,ivQikPcfbuMmomCqnyxIxA
2130370,2017-08-10,0,FO_6o6BAs3s8yzd-gDh3jQ,This place deserves ZERO stars! The employees were too busy socializing and put absolutely NO EFFORT in preparing the food or ensuring that the orders are correct. We were charged extra for food we NEVER received and waited over 15 minutes for them to prepare our food only to be DISAPPOINTED! The service is horrendous and the food is terrible! Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money at this establishment!,RRy711SMY_m89D2ff7GJmg,0,0,1,DVWWBScqAIzoV2-BPirszA

The food was fresh and the customer service for a fast food restaurant was outstanding.",-EJorVxe7h2GSxdiRyMmDA,0,0,4,QfW6MlW3utbfSzslVfNgrA

5493700,2014-01-29,0,FO_6o6BAs3s8yzd-gDh3jQ,This is a fairly new jack place in Vegas. I overall never had a problem here except for one time when the order taker in the drive-thru could not get the concept of switching the cheese on the spicy jack chicken sandwich. It was a little frustrating.  I have been back several times after that and never had a problem. The food comes out quickly considering that it's made fresh.,XiA038PHn_fq-s7p38S00g,0,0,4,RUxUOItXGci0e6-kBQ0Cng
