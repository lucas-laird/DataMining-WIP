39731,2014-07-12,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Ahh, Old Homestead. This is my third visit in three years. My first visit was a 5 star experience (service and food standard), but sadly, each year's experience gets worse. All three years, I've ordered the same: Porterhouse steak for two (about $110) + foie gras ($16 to $20) + truffle gnocchi ($16) (and some additional sides). This visit, my party was 6, so we ordered multiple Porterhouse and a whole bunch of sides. When the food arrived, we were so disappointed. The steaks were overcooked and charred at the sides. Foie gras was small and burnt at the top (not seared). I brought it up to the server and he gave excuses. I didn't want to make a scene so I brought up a pic of the previous year's unburnt foie and he promised to do something about my tiny, burnt one. After a long while, he came back with another dish of foie. Sigh. Just as burnt and small. But gratis, so I stopped complaining. I really want to like this place, I've had good memories. Servers are all very attentive and professional. If this was a review only about the front of the house, I'd give it 5 stars. But the food. Ugh. Party of 6's bill was approx $650. Dinner on 8 July.",Xs4wlPwWUCdQSqqFDG1b_A,1,0,1,nCXqb7Gq28w8o-CrAK5Vdg
79306,2012-05-21,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"We didn't have reservations for dinner on a recent Wednesday night and had been to several restaurants at Bally's and Paris with 30-45 minute waits.  We walked over to Caeser's and glanced at the menu at Bobby Flay's Mesa restaurant and then at the Old Homestead.  Since there was no wait at the Old Homestead, we decided to eat there.  We were seated in the row of booths on the path to the kitchen which should have been a clue, I guess.  When we really looked at the menu, we were pretty horrified.  Most of the steaks were at least 16 oz servings, which is far too big for most people, and the prices were really high.  Everything was a la carte.  To add insult to injury, there were only a couple of wines on the wine list that were under $100, and most of those had a retail value of less than $20.  It's one of the rare times we didn't order wine with dinner.

Now I think I know why there was no wait...

We shared the ""Steak for Two"", which was $100.  It was OK, but certainly not the best I've ever had.  We had Gnocchi with Truffles, which was delightfully light when it was warm, but really doughy and sticky as it cooled a little and Brussels Sprouts, which were undercooked and woody.

I wish we'd at least asked if there was a wait for Mesa or kept looking.  

As far as I'm concerned, this restaurant is living on it's reputation and location.  I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances.",Tu9Lg3EffIv4ozeNpTnzfQ,2,0,1,VoRAiuUGbIun3vdIEtsiZg

We started with oysters Rockefeller. They were delicious and came with five nice size oysters. Then we moved on to our main course. We both got the petite (lady's cut) filets, medium rare. WOW. Ranks in my top five steaks of all time. It has a wonderful char on the outside but was perfectly medium rare on the inside. Tender and juicy. I ate the whole thing, which hardly ever happens. I also had mine topped with blue cheese which was delectable. For the side we had lobster Mac and cheese, which was the special that night. Creamy with lots of lobster and cheese. It was a huge portion. The two of us couldn't finish it. The wait staff was exceptional, really attentive and friendly. We had Charles for our waiter, you should ask for him.  Although I'm sure any waiter/waitress you get will be great. We were too full for dessert but the menu was extensive and sounded amazing. They have Baked Alaska which I've been dying to try.

So I ate at the bar and had a very good meal. The Caesar salad was just ok... The dressing was a bit bland for my taste, not much cheese either and no anchovy. I'm still hoping I can find a great Caesars salad during my stay at Caesars!

Not mind blowing, not orgasmic, not amazing, and not worth the cost.  I suppose if you are a millionaire and used to dropping this kind of money without batting an eye - its the place for you.  I know prices on the strip are high, but they have taken that to its extreme here.  There were 6 of us and the bill came to $1700 incl tip!!!!   That is $283 per person!!   We had a few appetizers that the entire table shared, 2 bottles of low to mid price range wine on their list, 2 cocktails each, everyone had a steak (and not the Australian Waguy for $110), 4 sides for the table to share, 4 coffees, 4 after dinner drinks and 2 desserts.  So, put all of that into perspective and it really should have came with a message or a hotel room for that price.  I realize if you don't have any alcohol, no appetizers, no sides, no desserts and only a steak each it would have only cost  around $500.  That is a car payment.  My bone in filet was $70.  That is just too much to pay for any steak, sorry.  We will never go again, the scale is too lopsided to feel any less than completely taken advantage of.  Way to go Harrah's entertainment - if you can continue getting these prices why not?!  Not ever again for us.  We don't like feeling taken for - you're not that good!!

Just remembered...the cookie dessert is not 1000 times better than a Pazookie as our server told us.  It's not nearly as good.  If you order the Bacon - be ready for one strip of bacon on a large plate.  That's it.  No greens, no nothing, just a thick slice of bacon.  It's good bacon - but seriously?  Meatball was great, better than Rao's.

But I guess they only celebrate the anniversary on a Monday or Thursday? So alas no prime rib for me as it wasn't on the regular menu. I therefore ordered the burger medium. The first one came out well done. After waiting almost 20 min for the waiter to come over and check on us it was taken back. Waited another 15 min to get a replacement which came out more medium rare-rare. I didn't send it back because I didn't want to wait any longer, was starving and my significant other had already finished his entree. No comp of any kind nor did a manager come over to the table to at least apologize which you would think at a place of this caliber would occur. The burger besides being too undercooked was not very good.  It didn't taste like anything special . I guess being ""seared in a 800 degree cast iron pan"" is why they think it is worth $30 but have had better burger at local fast food place and definitely not worth $30.

This is probably the first steak I've ever had that was bland.  I ordered the peppercorn sauce ($5) to accompany my steak but ended up relying on it for flavor.

492093,2012-08-28,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"On April 4, 2012 my wife and I had dinner at the Old Homestead in Las Vegas and wrote a review on Yelp that described a very disappointing experience. Understanding that several positive changes were made at the restaurant through discussions with others, we decided to try the restaurant again on August 18, 2012 while we were in Las Vegas.  

This time the experience was much more positive.  We arrived at the appointed reservation time and were promptly seated.  A waiter came to our table within 5 minutes to take our drink orders, which were promptly served. The service throughout the evening was excellent. We then ordered a wedge salad which we split. It was very fresh, crisp and quite tasty.  I ordered a Strip Steak and my wife ordered a petite Filet Mignon. We also ordered Asparagus as a side dish.
We found the service that evening to be excellent.  However, the noise level at the restaurant is quite high due to the way it is set up and its open location. This did not spoil the evening. I am only mentioning it so those of you who wish to try it are aware of that issue. 

The meal happened to be very good, we ordered the steaks medium rare. The steaks were quite tasty. My wife's was served perfectly cooked as medium rare but my strip steak came out cooked between medium rare and medium, although it was acceptable enough to eat and not send them back. The steaks overall were quite tasty and very tasty.

I am raising my rating of the restaurant to a 4. I might have given it a 3  1/2 if there were such a rating only because I did not get a perfect cooked medium rare steak.  
While we now will consider the Old Homestead in Las Vegas again on future visits I still don't feel their steaks are at the same level we have had at Peter Lugers in Brooklyn, NY, the Old Chop house in Chicago or Joes Crab in Chicago. Restaurants we have been to dozens of times.  However, the Old Homestead in Las Vegas made quite a bit of progress since our first visit.",m-aKxW0Dyp9BZsR81fgfJg,1,0,4,ng-7YAf2E69cxnL---7xTg

Mac and cheese was not overpowered by the truffle and was creamy and rich. My bf enjoyed every bite of his wagyu and added that the mashed potatoes it came with were fluffy and smooth.

Awkward moment of the night: We were seated at one of the tables along the corridor of the casino where there is alot of foot traffic.

711877,2012-06-11,1,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Came here on Saturday 9PM and were fortunate enough to find a table for 6 without a reservation as the restaurant was quite busy. So, reservations would probably be the best bet. The decor was simple and classy. Our booth was lit up beautifully which, sometimes, is an attribute missed on by many steakhouses with dark lighting on the restaurant floor. Now, the food. 

First, I would say that the sides at Old Homestead in themselves deserve 5 stars. They are absolutely that good! The fried calamari was tender and fresh. Lobster bisque was so rich, creamy, and full of flavor. DO NOT MISS OUT on the CRAB CAKES, ROASTED CORN, and GNOCCI w/TRUFFLE. The crab cake is stacked high with fluffy light crab meat and seared in with a delicious crispy crunch. The Roasted corn had some combination of jicama and spices, all of which tickle the your tastebuds and leave a nice little kick of fire. My favorite side was the Gnocci. Each bite was perfectly soft (not overly chewy) that melts in your mouth as the flavor of the white truffle permeates your pallet. 

Steaks we had were the Bone-In Filet and Porterhouse for 4. The bone-in filet had a perfect char and  juicy center. The porterhouse comes out sizzling on the plate and is nothing short of awe inspiring. Beautiful piece of meat. You can literally cut through the meat with a butter knife. It was so tender and delicious. Black Peppercorn sauce was out of this world and goes so well with the steaks. 

On top of the food, the service we had at old homestead was something that made our experience very special that night. Our server, Nigel, and the AGM, Casey, were so very accommodating and gave us excellent suggestions. The people here are truly knowledgeable in food ad wine and were a big help. Never did we feel ignored, which goes to show their commitment to service even on a busy night. We really appreciated them!

Old Homestead at Caesars will be my go-to spot to eat and be treated like a king. I recommend anyone go here to treat themselves or impress a date.

I went to Old Homestead on my last trip to Vegas almost half a year ago and went to Old Homestead for the first time. It was a big group of us, maybe about 20 people, and everyone was pleased. I had the filet mignon, it was cooked perfectly.

I figured I'd try something different this time so I splurged a little and had the 5oz Japanese Wagyu (somewhere around $150). I asked for no pepper on it. It's not an allergy, just a strong dislike. I was hoping that when someone ordered a bit of a nicer cut that they would pay more attention to the requests but I ended up scraping the pepper off in the end. My fault, I could've sent it back but I didn't want to be THAT butt. It was good and all but I've had Japanese Wagyu before and it was definitely more tender than the piece I had. You definitely need to order a side with the Wagyu as it is extremely marbled and very rich if you have it on it's own. Again, it was cooked perfectly so I guess I have to give them credit for 2 perfect steaks out of 2.

My mom had the King Crab legs and finished them happily but all she could say was they were good but she'd had better. Stick to the steak at the steak house but if you want seafood, their seafood tower was very satisfying on the first visit.

Finally, dessert! Hot cookie in a skillet with a giant ball of ice cream and a Creme Brulee. Two very happy desserts to end the night. Nothing amazingly out of the ordinary but very pleasing!

We had a great waiter so that made all the difference. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name but he was a man! Maybe that'll narrow it down for you.",UWokmzyJnFLsKWzRpgY9iw,0,0,4,Yn8dXiAT8yCaMfcNpe2jUg

My colleague and I were staying at the Mirage and planned on having dinner at STK at the Cosmo on Monday (12/18) night. However, the night before (Sunday) we had an amazing experience at Nobu at Caesars. Amazing meal and whiskeys... and Toshi, our bartender, was spectacular. We had the Chef's tasting menu... remarkable. While walking out, we saw the Old Homestead Steakhouse restaurant and one of their hostesses encouraged us to dine there the following night, and that we would have a similarly, amazing meal if we came back. 

So, we changed our plans from STK, and dined at there. This is where, unfortunately our experience paled in comparison to our evening at Nobu:

1) First, there were plenty of tables open, but my colleague and I were seated in the walkway to their kitchen where severs used this path all night. The door swung opened consistently distracting from the ambience. This was not ideal to have good conversation... but tolerable since we were looking forward to the great steak meal that was boasted.

2) Our waiter Rocky was wonderful. He had great suggestions and information about the food and drinks. Very accommodating. Also, the gentlemen that brought us our bread and waters was very attentive and professional (I didn't get his name, but stellar). But, after we submitted our orders, we waited almost an hour to be served. There was a gentlemen that was seated after we ordered, and he received his appetizer, and full meal before ours. Another couple that was seated after us, also received their meal before us. This seemed a bit odd. But we were patient and didn't allow it to ruin our anticipation.

3) Once we received our food, everything was good again. We didn't mind the area we were seated in, nor that it took quite some time. The food was delicious... including the two cappuccinos to end the meal with. We left content and satisfied. This was our last night in Vegas, so we had a lot planned. However, a few hours into the night my colleague became quite nauseated and ill. We rushed back to the room where he experienced severe stomach cramping, vomiting and diarrhea.  I thought that he possibly caught a bug or something, until I started to experience the same symptoms.

We both ordered the Gotham and shared the Asparagus, and Truffle Mashed Potatoes; so we can't help but figure that we were served something that caused food poisoning given the timing and severity.

Needless to say, our last night in Vegas was spent in our rooms, and our travels back to Los Angeles were quite cumbersome, with frequent and challenging stops.

All of these three things simply added up into why I decided to email the manager, Mr. Hitoshi Yuhara... who I still haven't heard from. I would truly appreciated a response to our very unfortunate experience. It was quite disappointing, and even more so since it ruined all of our plans for our final night in Vegas.

I've changed by rating from a 1-Star to 2-Star since Mr. Hitoshi Yuhara contacted me. I'm looking forward to resolving the experience we had.",I5HAoa3yk5dW1GHtwGfPHw,1,0,2,HBdCqfhpkFwVgkDXaGmv4A

The manager asked if I wanted to ""file a report"" or that he could ""call security"" to escort me somewhere - neither of which help someone in the middle of an allergic reaction.

1709301,2013-01-31,8,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"***The steak at Old Homestead Steakhouse in Caesars Palace is decent, but you will have much better steaks (as well as much better sides) at Mario Batali's Carnevino in The Palazzo***

Old Homestead seems to be a relatively new steakhouse in Caesars Palace.  It is located along that narrow stretch of walkway that connects two parts of the casino (the one area with Mesa Grill and the casino area more towards the hotel lobby).

The decor at Old Homestead is definitely dark, but it is actually not as dark (or as old-school) as what you will find in many of the pricey steakhouses in Las Vegas.  The restaurant feels smaller, more open and even a little more contemporary.

We had a special 3-course fixed menu, which included a choice of salad, an entree with sides and an assortment of some of the restaurant's desserts.  The two salad choices were a caesar salad and their kitchen sink salad.  The kitchen sink salad (my choice) consisted of shrimp, salami, bacon, avocado, tomato, hearts of palm, blue cheese, and a vinaigrette.  The salad was decent.  The balance of the ingredients was not that great and some of the salad was a little underdressed, but the overall flavor was satisfying enough.

Their entree dishes included a chicken, fish and sirloin dish.  I opted for the sirloin au poivre, which was topped with a peppercorn sauce.  There was a garnish of Yukon gold mashed potatoes.  Sirloin is definitely not the most expensive cut of beef, but the preparation here was good.  The sirloin had a nice sear and there was a decent marbling of fat, which gave the meat a fair amount of juiciness (which can be tough with a sirloin).  The meat was tender too and flavorful.

The peppercorn sauce was quite aggressive.  It made the dish a little too peppery.  The side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes was fine.

There was also a decent breadbasket with many different choices including a pretzel roll.

Desserts are typically not that special at steakhouses.  They tend to be old-fashioned and heavy desserts and that was the case here.  There was a key lime pie topped with an Italian meringue and it was actually refreshing, tart, creamy, and decent.

I did not try the New York Style Cheesecake, but I did try their Big Fat Chocolate Cake, which was a chocolate layer cake with ganache.  It was not that great--dense and not that great of a flavor (kind of something you could get anywhere).

Service was good.  The staff was friendly and the food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high like other high-end Las Vegas steakhouses.

Old Homestead is a decent place for a big and juicy steak on The Strip.  I prefer Carnevino to Old Homestead, but I would take Old Homestead over chain places like Smith & Wollensky, The Palm and Ruth's Chris (which is located just off The Strip).  It is not a great steak restaurant, but it is an okay one.

Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free self and valet parking.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,18,10,3,_zXxFxk7EaAjTPJjkn0GQQ

We left wobbling out of here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! We were also fortunate enough to be sat in a private room that wasn't being used with just a few other tables as I noticed that this place is insanely loud. Whether you're on the main dining side or near the bar, everything is open to the casino and the noise level is extremely loud. Just something to keep in mind when you're coming here and for what reason. 

Our food was very satisfying. From the perfectly cooked filets to the room temperature butter that was doused with EVOO...as one thing after another came out we just couldn't stop eating! Here are a few details -

The meat was flavorful and we tried the potato gratin and creamed spinach with bacon. Both sides were perfect. My kitchen sink salad with champagne vinaigrette was also great and you can customize it if there's anything you don't like as I did. Caesar salad was ok, nothing special. If you decide to indulge on the seafood be prepared for colossal shrimp. They were as large as my hand and looked like lobster tails! We also splurged on trying all the steak sauces and I'm glad we did because there wasn't one we didn't enjoy! My new thing is to also add caramelized onions to any steak on the side which we did here and again it just all went together perfectly!

It's pricey but we did enjoy nearly everything and the only thing I wouldn't order again was the Caesar.

There were positives, but not as many as I would have liked considering the reputation and price

Now, I know it is a 'Famous' name. I know it is Vegas, and in Caesars. But....

I was in Vegas for work, and ha da vendor bring me and a few others out to dinner (8 of us total)

The best part of the dinner, was the company and conversation, not the dinner.

Appetizers I will say were top notch. Four types of bread including pretzels, jumbo shrimp the size of lobster tails, and thick cut grille bacon. yum

The steak? Well, I could have bought a $160 steak... but 'settled' for the cheap $62 strip

We got a few 'family style' sides (asparagus, gnocci and tater tots). AS mentioned in my review of Abe and Louies, I like family style sides... but....

So the steak. Wasnt bad, was cooked well, but nothing special. Really, the taste didnt jump out. didnt taste any better than a $20 steak at a 'lesser' restaurant. This was disappointing, as I when I have had steaks at other 'high end' steakhouses, you can TASTE the difference

The 'family style' sides cam eout, tiny. I think 8 strips of asparagus for four people, and the tatertots (which tasted the same as frozen grocery store ones) came in a cone like you would get french fries in at a lot of other places. I was shocked at how small the 'family style' sides were

All in all, it wasnt horrible... but when with a round of drinks, you run up a bill of $1300 for 8 people, you expect a LOT more
(and yes, I know I said four above, and now either. our part of 8 was split into two tables, not even next to each other. Another HUGE disappointment, especially considering we had reservations)

First we ordered the Maine Lobster Bisque as an appetizer. We decided to split a bowl so we could try a little of everything. This was probably a mistake because neither one of us wanted to share! It was so creamy and delicious with just the right amount of lobster. 

I am not a beet fan but we decided to get the Roasted Heirloom Beet Salad. I was not expecting to like it one bit but somehow the marrying of the peppery arugula with the goat cheese and the beets won me over. It was a great salad.

We both got the Petite Filet Mignon and were greatly satisfied with it.  They had cooked it perfect to both of our liking.  The flavors were nothing short of a near perfectly cooked and seasoned Filet.  

Lastly we had the Big Fat Chocolate Cake and that was a perfect end to our meal.  It had a great taste to it and it was not too sweet.  The cake was also very moist.  Delicious and appealing to the eyes.

-My husband had the Japanese Wagyu steak and it was the best we've ever had! It melted in our mouths. I believe it came with potatoes and mushrooms. He also got a side of asparagus which we enjoyed. 

-I got the surf and turf with an 8oz filet and lobster tail. The lobster was delicious and my filet was cooked perfectly. I also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was my least favorite thing that we ordered. It wasn't bad, it's just my personal taste that I don't enjoy super thick cheese, but I know many people do.

2036288,2012-11-26,6,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"This year my parents decided to ditch cooking and have Thanksgiving in Vegas. It ended up just being them, my boyfriend and me, and my best friend who had Thanksgiving dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse. 

We had reservations so we were seated right away. We had the most awesome waiter ever...I wish I remembered his name so I could give him a shout out! He made our dining experience great, my dad even asked him to sit down and have a drink with us since we liked him so much! He didn't, but it would have been fun.

This place was great! And the prices were pretty reasonable, between all the food we ordered and multiple cocktails, our bill was only $400 after my 10% off Yelp check in offer and the fact that we got the Total Rewards Pricing. That is not bad for a nice steakhouse!

We ordered....

Garlic Bread (two orders of it actually) - This is not typical garlic bread. It is served on a huge plate, with light, airy pieces of toast stacked up on one end, and the entire bottom of the plate is filled with a delicious garlicky Alfredo type sauce to dip the toast in. Brilliant idea, very tasty.

French Onion Soup - My boyfriend and friend ordered this. Very rich, lots of sherry, great cheese on top, loaded with onions. I really enjoyed this.

Maine Lobster Bisque - This was the only letdown of the meal for me. Instead of large pieces of lobster, there was a small round of minced lobster in the bottom of the bowl, then the bisque was poured over that. The lobster itself tasted good, but the bisque was too fishy and there was something missing. We never figured out what it was, but both my stepmom and I ordered this, and neither of us cared for this much. 

Porterhouse Steak for Three - The four of them decided they wanted to split the Porterhouse. My stepmom had been to this restaurant before and she said they could get the Porterhouse for two, and it would be enough for the four of them. My men didn't believe her, so they ordered the steak for three. Good lord! I wish I was able to get a picture of that steak, but the servers dish it out to everybody as soon as it arrives. That thing was MASSIVE! And my stepmom was right, there was steak leftover. If I had decided to have the Porterhouse as well, the portion for three people would have easily fed all five of us. And it's such a good deal, only $142 which worked out to $35 per person. I highly recommend getting that steak, it was tasty and very affordable. 

8 oz Petite Filet - I ordered this Medium with a side of Truffle Butter. It was definitely a bit rarer than Medium, but it was good. They give you enough Truffle Butter to pass around, there was probably as much butter as there was steak. Very rich, very decadent, a perfect steak for me!

Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes - Good, but nothing special. Very simple mashed potatoes.

Tater Tots with Fat Boy Sauce - The tots were great, they had a nice consistency, the dipping sauce was some sort of sour cream mixture with huge pieces of thick cut bacon mixed in. I liked these. 

Mac & Four Cheeses - A very good, but simple, Mac and Cheese. 

Cauliflower Gratin - Awesome roasted cauliflower with cheese. I think this was my favorite side, we should have ordered two of these, as the sides are pretty small and there was definitely not enough of all five of us to have a lot of the gratin.

As I stated before, the service was impeccable. We never waited for anything, our waiter was constantly bringing us more cocktails and wine, refills on water never took long. The ambiance in this restaurant was nice, very dark, and they were playing lounge covers of 90's pop songs, which I found funny.

Our reservation was for 8pm and we were not seated until 845pm. We finally were seated after watching several people show up ""without"" reservations and get seated ahead of us.  We ordered our food and it took 10 -15 minutes for the waiter to give us bread and water.  Some ordered appetizers and we all ordered salad.  The appetizers came out with the salad leaving no room on the table to put all the plates.  None of us were drinking wine but the wine glasses remained on the table.  I could go on and on. Service was atroshish.  .  

As for the food:

The Cesear salad was small, overpriced, slimy and very fishy.  

The Tuna Tartare was uninspired and had a very strange odor and taste to it.  I love raw tuna and I sent this back.  Awful!

Now it was time for the steaks and sides. First off, the steaks were way overpriced even compared to comprable steak house like Prime and Cut.    My steak was ordered medium rare and showed up medium to well.  I asked them to send another steak and it was back on the table within 10 minutes.  It was raw.  Finally I told the waiter to just take it off the bill.  Let me go on record that I almost never return food.      

The sides were again, uninspired and overpriced ($12 per side)

There is a party of 3 seated next to our booth. An older couple with a gentleman in a wheel chair. He looks like maybe he is the father of one of them (maybe in his 90's)
I see Rebecca greet them as she did with us. 
She comes back over with our drinks and takes our order. She is pleasant and explains everything and even asked us if we were on a time constraint so she she could plan the order of dinner. 
We notice that our older customers orders are brought out. Then we see this! Rebecca having casual conversation as she would with most of her tables then she starts prepping the older mans food, cutting his food into small pieces so it is easy for him to eat it.

The sides were great, but I do wish they had creamed corn, nonetheless it was yum.

For dinner, I had the rib-eye steak, gnocchi with butter and truffles.  The steak and gnocchi was awesome....full of intense flavor.

For desert, I had the banana bread pudding....it came with a scoop of ice cream and a super sweet caramel  sauce.

Last week, my colleagues/friends and I were in Las Vegas for a conference. We wanted to go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, but there were no reservations available. I suggested that we dine at Old Homestead because I recently had the best experience. We had a reservation and were seated within a few minutes. Kevin M. was our server. One of my friends and I ordered the exact same meal. We both had the Lobster Bisque and Diver Scallops. My other friend had the Steakhouse Wedge salad and some type of fish... maybe Branzino? The Lobster Bisque hardly had any lobster. I was searching the bowl for it. My friend's salad looked disgusting. It had this thin blue cheese and the lettuce was not cut in a wedge. I've seen a better wedge salad at Black Angus. There was hardly any bacon on it too. I felt bad since I encouraged her to order that particular salad. Then, the meal came. Our scallops were gritty. And, not just one of them, but all of them. Diver scallops are supposed to be grit free because they are harvested by hand. Also, this means that the chef did not thoroughly clean them because that could've prevented the problem. My friend disliked the fish and only ate half of it. To top off the experience, we had poor service. Our server was inattentive. We waited for at least 15-20 minutes to get our check. I felt horrible taking my friends here and kept apologizing to them. As you can see, I was just there less than a month ago and had an awesome meal and experience. I am extremely disappointed and will not be going back.

Stop counting calories for an evening.  You must go into it with no concern about the money.  This is an expensive restaurant, and the food and service are both worth it.  Expect to spend $300 for a big dinner for two with drinks and dessert.  Again, WORTH IT.

Each cut of meat is meticulously prepared and perfectly cooked.  The vegetables and sides are outstanding. Unleash your inner child and order the tater tots fat boy sauce.

2584104,2012-03-07,9,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Food?  Please.  Quality of product before the culinary challenged get their hands on it? Excellent.  Service? Depends.  I wanted the guy next to the idiot we had. He was so spot on the table next to us gushed over the pretty boy the whole time. There's a million people working the room so kudos to Caesars for helping the UE problem in Las Vegas.  but you would think they could attract all pro staff.

The entrance was an exercise  in never having done this before.  I guess they went we inexperience. Oh? That was the manager?  He was certainly wacky.  Bowtie and all, suit with sneakers, made me feel I was at Chucky Cheese.  Thank goodness when later problems developed we discovered he was only the assistant.  The Big Boss Manager was only slightly wackier.  Always reassuring to have someone talk to you in circles and not fix anything only to come back a second time to not fix anything.  

This restaurant is probably an average $100 a head.  More if you're having fun.  Do they crumb tables.  Bread plates and butter on the table when dessert comes? This is a management issue because the  stud next to us crumbed, covered spills with fresh napkins, pulled out chairs.  I thought the one lady was going to F him right there.  WTF?  Were we in the D seats?

We were told the chef came from the Wynn.  Manager from the Wynn.  Waiter from the Wynn.  Have these people been to the Wynn?  Granted I don't like it, it doesn't seem like Vegas to me, but it shines.  These people would be out like poop through a goose.  Oh.  I guess they were and ended up here.

Here's the rub.  We were insiders kind of.  given the scoop to try it out by people inside.  Huh?  Sorry.  Wrong people.  We mostly only write when we've been screwed.  And a great restaurant gets 3 stars and up as it should, not gushing 5 stars every time you have a decent bite.  Did they think we were easy?  

Truly not being harsh here.  It sucked.  BUT, the good news is that the place is a few months old and we were told to wait to April when it could be righted.  Coming from the slick dude that told us that we will try, but be warned, if I see any of this crap go down, I will take no prisoners.

Oh forgot to mention the light show.  Amazing.  They play everything from Sinatra to Zeppelin.  All done with flickering lights.  kind of annoying if you're there for dinner.  OH! I see.  It's an electrical malfunction that gets so bright that even my gorgeous girl was exposed under the operating room glow, thank thankfully for me (cause I looked a lot worse I'm sure), suddenly went pitch black.  But I felt better when BOZO the manager clown told us it's been that way since the beginning.  Pesky little lights.  They put man on the moon 45 years ago.

We had five tables in a semi-private room and it was nearly an hour before our salad courses were served and another long delay before entrees were served and dessert service was equally slow.

Table clearing was erratic, no one inquired about the food served and they seem more interested in telling stories than listening to what their patrons wanted.

The food sounds great on the menu, but don't count on what you get resembling the menu.  A salad with tomato and hearts of palm had 1 cherry tomato cut in half and a section of palm heart less than 1/2 inch cut into thin slices.  The rest was fancy lawn clipping in a vinegary dressing.

The steak au poivre tasted ok and the prep was fine, but the chicken breast with fingerlings was dreadful.  I could have used the chicken breast as a dessicant for a shipping container.

It's a contemporary steakhouse with great energy and flare, slightly different from its NYC counterpart (from what I've heard)..think Meatpacking District meets the strip ;)

Grey goose martinis, Maryland crab cake and 2 lb lobster.  Excellent dinner, end of story. Throw in the bread basket (pumpernickel and bacon cheddar cornbread were the best) and you are totally set.

As a native Marylander, my big rule of thumb is to NEVER order a ""Maryland"" crab cake when outside the mid-atlantic region. However, I was craving it big time, and the waiter assured me it wouldn't disappoint. Definitely a mix of lump and claw meat, and probably a little too much filler, but overall it was delicious. 

Live Maine lobster only comes in 2 lb or 4 lb. 2 lb was more than enough (usually 1-1.5lb is plenty), it was huge! Served very simply with some butter on the side.  Very good lobster, plain and simple. 

My two co-workers got petite filets, cooked medium, bearnaise sauce on the side. They are pretty snobby NYC food critics when it comes to their steak (veterans of Sparks, Del Frisco's, Smith & Wollensky, etc.), and they both said it was great. Not the best they've ever had, but certainly not worth a two (or even three) star rating!

I like to frequent a couple steakhouses every time I come to Las Vegas so when my flight was cancelled due to a snowstorm back in Boston I rejoiced at the chance to check out a place I had always meant to try after having two fantastic dinners at both SW in the Wynn and CUT in the Venetian (a must stop every time out) on the trip. 

Started out with the Calamari appetizer, which was flavorful although the dish only consists of calamari rings. 

I then ordered the 24oz bone in Gotham ribeye with a side of mushrooms. After making a few drinks, the bartender came over to confirm the Gotham choice and  temperature I preferred (medium rare plus) and we were off to the races. Or so I thought. 

An appropriate amount of time later the steak came out. No bone. Just your basic 16oz ribeye... Now, as someone who prefers the flavor of his steaks cooked with the bone-in this was hugely disappointing and plays a main role in my poor experience. The bartender did offer a coffee in return for the mishap, but I didn't go to Old Homestead to try out the coffee.",JQjFCUtf-fqtMSgFdrBxwQ,0,0,2,cChQq6sMyviv2Vtaj_5uRQ

Located in the middle of Caesars across from nobu. Has kind of an old classic steakhouse feel, open but still quiet and intimate.

Started with the seafood platter for two, but got everything but the oysters warmed and it was great. Massive king crab and jumbo oysters, decent piece of lobster and I think a half dozen small oysters. Prolly the best thing I recognized was no fishiness taste or smell at all, I know that can be a real turn off for a lot of people. Very well done though.

Next we shared the 24oz Gotham ribeye, medium rare. Cooked perfectly and had a really nice sear on it. Definitely enough for two smaller people. Got mac and cheese to go with it. Pretty good, super cheesy doe, maybe a lil too much cheese if that's possible. 

Finished off by overeating / ordering and got the banana bread pudding, pretty solid, but not worth getting if you are full. Probably could have done without. 

Also had a half bottle of wine. All in, with tip, this will run you around $300. Kind of on par with nicer places in Vegas. Definitely would recommend to others.",BeWDEj2Lj9L31HtFfZGn1w,2,0,5,SSpkXKQwZvhsANYOqO58-w

Massive steak portions. As one example the prime rib I believe is 34 oz, but you can't get a smaller size.  Another example is the 26 oz. ribeye.  It's kind of a ""Heart Attack Grill"" methodology for the portion sizes, except the HAG has beef that is really flavorful, unlike this place!  I ended up getting the 8 oz petite filet since I didn't want to gorge.....cooked exactly as I asked, but nothing remarkable to write home about.
As an appetizer, I had the French onion soup.  There was some annoying sweet taste in the soup, which overwhelmed  any other flavor.  The cheese topping the soup was tasteless.  My friend had the colossal shrimp cocktail, and it was massive....only 2 shrimp, and at least the presentation gets an A+.  For $27, I would expect a lot from a shrimp cocktail!
For prices, I believe the petite filet was $52, beers were $12, horseradish sauce $5, and the French onion soup was $14.....with the Total Rewards card discount.

The Server was friendly (even though he stopped just short of saying everything on the menu was amazing). The place is nice, the table setting and flatware is great (I loved their steak knives).

The Food was good, but sadly the only really memorable part of the entire menu was the bread basket. The Basket included a pumpernickel bread, dinner rolls, the pretzel breadstick that you can get in any Caesars Ent Diamond lounge, and the mack daddy of the Bread Basket, THE ASAIGO BACON MUFFIN, you read that right, a muffin that included bacon and asiago cheese, this was hands down the highlight of the meal.

The Caesar Salad was average at best, it was about 4 pieces of lettuce, with a few croutons, The Mac and Cheese was ok, but I've had better, the NY Strip was a good piece of cow, not the greatest slice of cow I've ever eaten, but it was cooked almost perfectly, nice sear on the outside, a little past med rare (which was my only complaint), but still good 


The food was OK, and the service was great, but for the premium price they're charging I was hoping for more. It's a good place, but in a city packed with top notch Steak Houses, it sadly will get lost in the mix. Good Cow, but there's better.

Another random thing, there was a table full of people who were in town for Chinese New Year next to us, they thought it would be a great idea to bring a child with them to a high end steak house, this would have been ok, but after we were seated, the child decided the empty place setting at our table would be a great place to play on her iPad, her parents just sat there and watched her as she played some random game on her iPad while we were getting settled into our table, not really the restaurant's fault but still unacceptable.",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,4,3,3,-YaCaZSrpH-oPes4ZXwifg

3059861,2015-04-19,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"I come from the school of thought where if you order your steak anything more than medium, you will be faced with an over dried hunk of meat. Going through these reviews, that logic seems to have held true for the most part. Ask any properly trained chef, and he will likely tell you the same thing. Overcooking a good cut of meat will ruin it. 

That having been said, everybody in my party ordered their steak rare or medium rare. There wasn't a single complaint to be had with any of the steak, and coming from a group of five Texans that's an exceedingly rare event.

The service was fantastic, and the cocktails are strong. We ordered five steaks, two side potatoes, a side of mushrooms, and a side of brussels sprouts. I tried everything except for the brussels sprouts, and it was on point. I, myself, had the six or 8 ounce filet mignon, I can't remember which size. Either way, it was the best steak I've ever had in my entire life.

True, the prices are pretty steep. But, in this case, you get what you pay for. I highly recommend Homestead Steakhouse for at least one ""splurge"" dinner for the meat lovers.",O7tncM_QrNIIOkW3P54fMw,0,0,5,Vh56zmFVbSJdZf5SIezsNg
3079341,2015-05-19,1,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Positives:  The management, the lobster mac-n-cheese.
Negatives:  Bad attitude at the hostess stand, mediocre steaks.

Service:  We made reservations using Open Table at the Old Homestead for our 10th anniversary dinner on Saturday, May 16th.  When we approached the hostess stand to check in, it took a few minutes for the blonde hostess to even acknowledge our presence and make eye contact.  We were told our table wasn't currently ready and for us to wait in the near area - we would be called when we would be seated.  Wait was not long (about 10 minutes), but because of our initial experience at the hostess stand, we kept a sharp eye on the activity at the stand.  When we were finally called, the brunette hostess called my name, but we couldn't hear it even though we were less than 10 feet away.  She did not walk away from the stand to see if we were one of the many customers waiting for a table, she just moved on to another ticket/reservation for seating. Luckily our attention to the activity meant that we read her lips and could tell she called for us and arrived before she called the next reservation.  

When she (the brunette hostess) brought us to our table, she was going to seat us wedged between the server station, the bar, and directly next to  the hostess station.  We immediately asked if we could be seated elsewhere since we didn't want to be so close to all that activity (it was our anniversary after all, and I indicated as much in my reservation).  She said no, she could not seat us elsewhere, but we were welcome to go back to waiting for a table.  We pointed to a nearby table of the same size (4 top) that was empty and asked why we couldn't have that one.  She said it was reserved.  I responded that we also had a reservation - why couldn't we have that table?  She became argumentative quickly and said flatly that she would not re-seat us.  Wanting to avoid any further interaction with this unhelpful person, I asked for the manager.  He met with us quickly and immediately understood our concerns, re-seating us in a booth nearby but out of the busy intersection where our initial table was located.  He treated us to champagne as an apology, and also generously sent over creme brulee after our dinner.  

We appreciated the helpfulness and respect that the manager afforded us, but our initial interactions with the hostess stand really set the tone for our dinner that we couldn't shake.  

Food:  Please keep in mind that this is very much an East Coast styled steakhouse.  If you are from Texas (like me), you may find that you don't get the flavor or experience you may be used to.

For our appetizers we ordered the wedge salad which had way too much bleu cheese and the lobster bisque which had a nice presentation but average flavor.

For our sides we ordered steamed asparagus (perfectly steamed) and duck fat fries (not much difference from Cisco fries).  We also ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese which was AMAZING.  This was definitely the highlight of our culinary experience here.

Our main course was the prime porterhouse for two, which for $120 really should have had more flavor and been less chewy.  About 1/3 of the whole steak was cooked to our preference of medium-rare.  The rest varied from almost raw to well-done.  Some of it was so chewy that I wondered if my jaw was going to give out.  The crust overall needed more salt.  Basically I felt we probably should have gone with ordering something we didn't have much expertise with so we wouldn't have been so critical.

Overall:  Definitely MEH.  Pay attention to the negative reviews if you have high expectations of this place.  You are better off going somewhere else - unless you are going for lobster mac.",dhu5UsRGTBdcIisZMt4xuA,0,0,2,TEA8v6zlySHuHG26E8AEZw
3082438,2017-11-08,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Trying to get back into writing reviews... so here we go..

I want to start with saying that I had the most amazing time here. Almost one year ago I went to the original location in New York City, and although the food was alright, I had the worst service. And to give you an idea as to how bad the waiter was, he counted our 20% tips at the table while still making a disappointed ""ugh"" sound while reading the check. How unbelievable was that?

But this Caesars Palace location was amazing, although noisy, is nice with a great lively atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend this place for an intimate romantic dinner. I made reservations on OpenTable, but ended up stopping by the restaurant a couple of days before to request a seating somewhere behind the Host stand, as the seating up against the front of the restaurants puts you right up against a hallway of people walking to and from the different casino areas of Caesars. I don't like that area as you have people slowing their step to take look at what's on your table, or even worse, stopping to take in a good look.

We started with a round of Grey Goose Martini's perfectly made. I had regular olives while my guests had blue cheese stuffed ones. The Crab Cakes were presented well, but tasted too fishy, and had a mustard sauce that is good enough for any hot dog. I don't think I would order the crab cakes again.

The Ribeye which I had was cooked PERFECTLY, and was so juicy. I don't remember if they offered any sauce, or topping!!! One of my guests had lobster which was overcooked and hard to chew, while my other guest had the bone-in-filet and from what they said, was cooked and tasted to their liking. 

This was paired with a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon (Cakebread from Napa Valley) for the price, which I would recommend springing for. Not necessarily that bottle, although I plan on ordering it again, but for the reason that each bottle ends up yielding around 4-5 glasses which you would ordinarily pay around $20-$30 for. You end up cutting a little off your bill ordering that way.

Some of the veggies were a little less than perfect so they're just shy of a 5 star review, but so much better than a four star (so I rounded up!)

3150413,2017-06-30,2,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"What a disappointment! 

Came here with my mother for a steak dinner at 10:00pm. We waited about eleven minutes for our server to even address us in an empty restaurant - fine. Another server was kind enough to bring us menus after six or so minutes of being seated, and finally prompted our server to address us. I understand maybe a Thursday night might cause some delay. There was an eight-stack right next to us, after all. 

Our server finally arrived without an apology. We ordered a surf and turf, sautéed spinach, and a wedge salad to start.

Wedge salad was alright. No complaints here.

The food was absolutely atrocious. The steak, which we requested medium, was raw. My mother was rather upset (quite embarrassingly, actually, but with what she was paying for this you can't quite blame her). Shrimp was nearly inedible. Nothing had flavor. The only one to check on us was the busser (who was lovely! attentive and just great). My mom had to be one of ""those people"" to wave over for a manager to come. 

And then came the arguing! Oh man, that was a rough. I was pissed, mom was pissed, and the manager was so defensive and in disbelief that the food was bad, us hangry ladies had even more heightened emotions. She knocked off the bill because the food was inedible - but she continued to argue with my mother, telling her that's the way they prepare medium steak (raw?), and that we didn't weight for our menus or waters at all. My mother had to tell her to go away because she wanted to continue arguing.

Before we left, our server quipped, ""Sorry you hated my service!"" 

Me too, buddy. Ugh. What a bunch of arrogance all around. If you're paying upwards of $100 for a meal, you should be treated like you matter at least somewhat...

And I'm sure that peach of a manager plans to come on here, too. That's fine. Just please don't argue with hungry customers because your chefs screwed up on bad, substandard meat.

The waiter we had was abrasive; he was 'friendly', but made it obvious that he was being friendly for work and did not really want to be. The food was only ok. Their port wine glaze for the steaks adds a sweetness not really at home on a good cut of steak, and it has a vinegary aftertaste. The steak sauce they serve tastes like ketchup and balsamic vinegar were put together in a blender. Our steaks were cooked perfectly, but just failed to impress in the taste department. 

As a special thank you, the waiter mistakenly charged the neighboring tables $220 check on our card. When he corrected it he insisted that it had not even gone through yet. He was wrong. We had $220 from our account frozen for the next 2 days due to his error. That is probably not a big deal for most of their clientele, but for two grad students that had to save for a long time to afford this meal, it was a pretty big slap in the face after a disappointing meal.

All surpassed the expectation and before I move on to the meal I'd like to stress that the service here was exceptional. No drink was ever drained without a replacement, no goblet left to be poured or empty plate whisked away all without the slightest intrusion. The staff was knowledgable and very welcoming and the restaurant itself was charming. It is inside the casino and gets a lot of traffic. That's probably the only thing that detracts from its location as it is not at all insulated from the walkway. 
We started with Pom martini's, steamed crab legs and beet and house salads. We had strip, Bone in filet and shrimp along with the usual sides. The truffled mashed was so good and really at $28 it should be! 
2 orders were polished off and so worth it.

The host was very nice.  He accommodated us on a Sunday night without a reservation.  We didn't get the best table in the house, but it was decent.  
Our server was very friendly as well.  I wish I could remember his name (Matt?).
The bread basket is amazing!  I had high hopes our dinner would be as well.  If they can bake great bread, they should be able to cook a good steak.  
To start we had the tuna tartar. It was pretty good and very refreshing.  We also ordered the onion rings as a side.  These were some of the best onion rings I have ever had.  We decided to split the prime rib (it was 32oz) and order the lobster tails.  The lobster was very good.  Perfectly cooked, tender and sweet.  
Now the prime rib is where it all went down hill.  We ordered it medium rare.  The server offered to have them split it in the kitchen for us and we agreed.  When they brought it out it looked amazing.  But one bite, and utter disappointment set in.  It was very cold.  The au jus it was sitting in had the temperature as if it had just come out of the refrigerator.
We told our server, he apologized and said he would take care of it.  They brought us the plates back out after about 10 minutes.  What they actually did was put them in the oven, which all it did was make the plate very hot and overcook the meat.  It was not edible the meat was so overcooked.  
Our plates were taken away with almost all of our steak left.  The busser never even informed our waiter that we expressed our displeasure with the steak, or even the fact he removed our plate with the entire cuts of meat still there!
When we saw our waiter, we expressed our situation.  He apologized and offered us free dessert.  Free dessert? really? We ordered a $70 steak, it was ruined so bad that we could not eat it, and you want us to get a free dessert?
I assumed that when the check came we would not be charged for that item.  But there it was, on the bill.  We had to call the waiter back over and ask him why they would charge us for an item they ruined and we couldn't/didn't eat.  He left to go get a manager.  The manager did take it off our bill, but only after we had to repeat our entire story.  Didn't our server explain our situation?  Very unprofessional service.  Our bill was still $150 without the prime rib.  We left hungry and went back to our hotel and ordered room service.
The saddest part is that this whole time the table next to us had ordered the prime rib.  It looked so delicious and the gentleman was enjoying it so much that it made us feel even worse.  We even pointed it out to our waiter and said ""That is what we ordered, that is what we expected.""  He never even offered to bring us a new meal.

I don't even know what to say.. it was just all around terrible. We only came here because everywhere else was full and needed to stay around Caesars for a quick scurry to Pure after dinner. 

Lighting was really dark - so I guess if you're not drunk enough to have your beer goggles on already and need somewhere to take your date so she looks better than you realized this morning... this is the place.

Everything was super super expensive.  I know it's Vegas, but cmon - for a no-name, no-famous chef, 3 yelp star place... NOT worth $66 for a sirloin or even $58 for a 8oz Filet! They do have an Australian Wagyu for $168... haha poor soul who ordered that from this place.  And what's worse... my medium rare filet came out completely cold - from the center to the outside. It was rubbed in so much salt that I think I drank a gallon of water. sigh again.

Kitchen sink salad was ok... but for $18, this salad filled the center of a small plate with lettuce and had two baby shrimp... not much else. 

Friends liked the Caesar salad, but again nothing special for a $17 salad.

Everything was super salty.  My friend had to send back 2 dishes because they were just not edible. 

What's worse, we overheard the waiter talking about us to another waiter right behind us!! how unprofessional!

Wine list was pricey again of course - nothing by the glass under $15.

I was staying the weekend at Caesars Palace and was too exhausted to venture out so i decided to dine at Old Homestead Steakhouse.  I passed by it on my way to the Total Rewards counter to receive my monthly vouchers for shows.  I thought that the restaurant looked really nice and decided that i would dine here since I LOVE steak. 

We were able to be seated quite quickly which was a plus.  Our server was also nice but a little slow.  He apologize saying that he had a large table to attend to yet the help was quick to clear our table when I still had food on my plate with the fork/knife in my hands.  Strange.  :(

Food: 
Complimentary basket of bread with salted butter.  This was yummy.  
**Thick-Cut Applewood Smoked Bacon (3 slices) $24; see photo
**Rib Eye Steak 16 oz
**Au Gratin Potatoes

The bacon was way too salty.  It's like they tried to season it but didn't sprinkle it all around evenly.  I did mention it to the server and instead of taking the 1 1/2 slices of extra SALTED pork, he says ""I'll give you a dessert instead to balance the taste.""  Really?  Okay, I just told him that I did not like my $24 dish of 3 slices of bacon that was extra salty.  Whatever, I ordered it and I made mention to my server and I do hope he told the chef about it.  I also heard the table next to me return their calamari dish because that too was too salty.  

So, now about the rib eye.  Yes, i eat a lot of meat and Rib Eye is one of my favorite cuts next to Porter House and Tomahawk.  I ordered it medium and it came out looking perfectly done.  Pink on the inside and charred on the outside.  I took a few bites and ummm NOPE... no flavor at all and typically when you bite into a steak you'd be able to savor and taste the meat. I started to wonder if my taste buds were altered because of the salted pork.  Regardless that the meat had no flavor, the meat was also chewy.  For a $68 steak, I could've gone to another restaurant instead and I wish I did.  

Personally, I would not recommend this place or even dine here again.  They might've had an off night but after reading other reviews those reviews were not joking.",Ar3bat-NGasrXDiS7WF8OA,9,4,2,S5qaH9CH_0cxkAJk9Kyz3g

Both over cooked. I had ordered mine rare and it came out with barely a hint of pink in the middle (it was darker than another guest at our table who ordered his med-rare and was also over cooked).

The sides we ordered - potatoes, lobster mac, spinach, and mushrooms - were unimpressive to both the eye and tastebuds.

Bright spot for the food was the appetizers we ordered but, after a table bill that was over a grand, we all just kind of left shrugging. For all the hype that goes into this steakhouse, our experience was that something has just obviously gone wrong in that kitchen -- which is a real shame.

Not sure why this place doesn't have higher ratings, but my group and I had a great meal. The food was pricey but well worth it; indulgent but not over the top. We made no reservation and walked in for an early 5:30pm dinner. The wait was about 5 minutes.

Between our table of three, we split:

1. Complementary basket of bread and butter - This came with some pretzel bread and a variety of rolls; the butter was fresh and creamy.

2. ""The Meatball"" - Topped with ricotta cheese in a pool of marinara sauce, this beast was a 14oz ball of tender meat, perfectly cooked, flavorful, and juicy. Imagine a meatball the size of your two fists put together, sizzling on a hot skillet.

3. The 38oz ""Lollipop"" Rib Eye for Two - Not sure how 2 people could finish this on their own cause it's a lot of meat. We requested medium rare, and it came out perfectly. Just the right amount of red and completely tender. Flavorful yet simple, classic steak with just enough fat, and probably one of the best cuts of meat I've had (if not the best). And as a Texan girl, I've had a lot of steak in my life. 

4. Old Homestead sauce flight - All of these sauces were delicious. Even the horseradish cream, which is a flavor I typically despise, was palatable-- creamy and buttery in consistency, not too harsh of a horseradish flavor. These sauces were a great compliment to the meat, albeit unnecessary since the steak was great on its own.

5. Truffle mashed potatoes - Perfect. Get it. No regrets. 

6. Duck fat fries - Crispy, fresh, delicious contrast in texture to the mashed potatoes we ordered. Our table loved potatoes and both of these were great selections.

7. Warm apple cobbler - aka warm apple heaven. We almost turned down dessert since we were stuffed but I'm glad we made room for it. This was the best dessert I've had in a while. Great size for sharing. Not too sweet. The apples were baked through just the right amount. And the cider sorbet topping was so so so so good and was a nice refreshing way to cleanse the palate after all the indulgent dishes.

To top that off, the hostesses were friendly and so was our waiter. Casual, trendy ambiance without being snooty. All in all, this was a great Vegas dinner experience. Can't wait to come back.",gkHsxjZU6_A0cvT56rS0Gg,1,1,5,xrFWR1k1rsMpFCh5kN2rOg

3517510,2012-06-10,2,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Like other modern Vegas steakhouses, Old Homestead is dark. It's also loud since the dining area opens up to the bar and a hallway within Caesars. And, like other steakhouses, you'll find typical dishes like beef tartare, tuna tartare, French onion soup, oysters, salads, a few seafood dishes, sides that are a la carte, and of course a variety of beef options.

There's nothing that really separates them from other steak places in town, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since I happen to enjoy most of the steakhouses I've been to. Although, they source their beef from Pat LaFrieda in NY (as does Gordon Ramsay's new place). That counts for something.

The bread basket had a variety of items in it, the best was the bacon cheddar roll. The crab cake ($23) lacked jumbo lump meat and was formed with mostly body meat and possibly some backfin meat. It did, however, pack a little kick from the roasted pepper aioli. The beef tartare ($22) could have used some of that, because it was rather bland.

For entrees, we decided to split the bone-in filet ($69, 16oz.), which they brought out on separate plates. The char was excellent and it was as tender as expected. The side of crab legs ($27) ordered with the filet consisted of one leg and a large pile of crab meat on the side with some drawn butter and half a lemon. It didn't look like much, but was plenty for the two of us. The roasted mushroom dish ($13) was also fabulous.

We still had room for dessert, so we opted for their carrot cake ($13). It was a large, traditional looking slice that could have fed four. The large chunks of walnuts in the cake added a nice contrast to the moist cake and mildly sweet (and creamy) icing. It was one of the better carrot cakes I've had in town and reason enough to return.

Prices are steep -- again, just like any other Vegas Steakhouse. But if you have your Caesar's/Harrah's Total Rewards card you can get a dollar or two off of each dish. The biggest issue I have with the price is that it's even more expensive than their New York restaurant. There's really no good reason for everything being more expensive. The crab cake, for example, if $5 more in Vegas than New York.

Another gripe is the reservation system. Old Homestead isn't on Open Table so you have to call their reservation line. The one listed on both the Old Homestead website and Caesar's Palace website wasn't working. I called numerous times over the course of an hour and the call would never go through. I had to call the hotel's room reservation line and they gave me a different number to use which worked. As an added hassle, they ask for a credit card number when you place your reservation.

The place may not be original, but that doesn't matter. Familiarity can be both comforting and satisfying and their dishes are just that -- items you've probably seen and tasted a million times. But at least they execute most of them well.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,4,4,Lk_NvBTtXa6OtuPK9pUXjg

They brought us a nice bread basket with butter. We split a four pound lobster and there was nice chunk of meat.  Also, it came with two small pieces of corn on the cob. My husband loved his French onion soup and my Caesar salad was good.  

This was not exactly a light meal we expected but it was wonderful.  Service was excellent.   We will definitely be back here to try other foods on the menu, especially seared foie gras.",ic-w_tW3Kf2TZBKVBrctgw,0,0,5,AQ6QSxq3IqtqxtmvNZPNcQ

We were seated in a private room with a wonderful ambiance. Just the right amount of light to make you relax. We started sharing the Applewood Smoked Bacon and Kobe Beef Meatball. They were both everything I could have expected and much more. The flavors were so amazing I didn't even try the sauces served with them. Next I had the French Onion Soup. Many others had the very impressive Shrimp Cocktail. The soup was hands down the best French Onion Soup I've ever had. The broth flavor had a depth and richness I have never experienced. There was nothing small about these shrimp! Like the soup they were a meal alone. Each shrimp was the size of my entire hand and over an inch in diameter. It came highly recommended by the wait staff and did not disappoint! The Filet Mignon, Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Mushrooms was the popular choice in the group after rave recommended by the staff. The Filet was thick, moist, tender and seasoned perfectly. No need for any of their specialty sauces or horseradish. The roast mushrooms I could have eaten for days! The Jidori Chicken also got rave reviews among friends. The Brussel Sprouts in particular were amazing! The depth of flavors in the sauce was complex and so delicious! 

By dessert I'm not sure how we had room for another bite! We all shared the Creme Brûlée, Big Fat Chocolate Cake and Cheesecake. Like everything else we had been served we were not to be disappointed! Everything we had was delicious and exceeded all expectations. The Cheesecake was thick, creamy and rich complimented by delicious fresh berries. The Creme Brûlée was perfection!  A creamy, smooth delicate custard had a perfect sugary crust topped with fresh, juicy berries and creamy chantilly! My personal favorite was the Big Fat Chocolate Cake. This is a chocolate lovers dream! This cake will feed a few people! It is a rich, dense chocolate cake layered with a light, rich chocolate mousse! This cake was dreamy! I highly recommend it.

Staff was outstanding. They kept cocktails, wine and other beverages coming with minimal wait. Water glasses stayed full. Plates were cleared efficiently. Staff made recommendations on everything from cocktails, wines and menu selections. They were always perfect.

Period, end of story.  I ordered a filet, cooked medium well with NO PEPPER added.  I was very clear that whatever pepper was already on the meat prior to cooking was fine, but I can't stand tasting the pepper on my finished steak.  I'm a firm believer that pepper should be to taste and not done back in the kitchen.  The server assured me he would add the note for no additional pepper.  The filet came and it was cooked perfectly but drowning in pepper.  The pepper was fresh, not cooked off and clearly had been finished off with a couple rounds of the shaker--totally disregarding my request.  UGH.  I tried to cut the top portion of my filet off, but I still tasted it.  So I sent it back.  I waited while everyone else at the table enjoyed their steaks.  The filet eventually came out, but this time they decided to ""butterfly"" it to make it cook faster (odd because I still waited a long time).  What happens when you butterfly a steak but still cook to requested temperature of medium well?  An over-cooked piece of meat for $50.  A total loss.  My husband had eaten halibut for dinner, so graciously offered to eat it for me but agreed it was terrible.  Bottom line:  if you aren't going to give me what I ordered, then don't charge me for the steak.  It's that simple.

I wanted to use my comps at a good steakhouse in Caesars...so, we decided to try Old Homestead without looking at the menu. It was just my wife and I...we asked how long the wait was...the host said they can accommodate us in 15 minutes. We grabbed a spot at the bar and noticed their was a 2-top table available the whole time we sat at the bar. After 35 minutes, I walked over to the hostess and asked when our table was going to be ready. Sure enough, they said in a few minutes and proceeded to sit us at the same table I was looking at for 35 minutes. Ugh. They sat us without menus. I had to get up and ask the Maitre D for menus. 

Our waiter finally came over. I asked his recommendations and I said give me a few minutes...he took 15 minutes to get back to me. By this time I'm starving. I ordered the 16ounce bone in Filet and my wife ordered the 8 ounce filet medium well. We added asparagus and mashed potatoes. The prices are very high. He assured us bread was on the way. The bread didn't come and I had to ask again. 

The food came in about 40 minutes and my wife's steak was undercooked and bloody. We waited for a while before he came back to check on us. We sent her bloody meat back for a medium well cook. She really wanted to eat it...but, it was too rare. They cooked the steak to her liking...but, it was still red. The food was good...but, no great. I expect something great for a $69.00 steak. 

All in all, we waited forever for the bill. The ambiance was lame. SW steakhouse at the Wynn is wayyyyyyyyyy better for the same price and they have a water show on the ""Lake of Dreams"" every 30 min.

Grilled asparagus had just the right amount of char on the outside and were perfectly trimmed and cooked, just enough snap left in them to give them that perfect texture.

French onion soup was killer, not too salty, and just the right temperature (whether this is the intent I'm not sure) where you can dig in almost immediately without burns.  Beet salad was nice, earthy, and salted well.  Béarnaise was a good addition to the steaks and asparagus.

A Las Vegas Strip steakhouse is a great steakhouse is an expensive steakhouse. 

Yes, the beef was very fine. The doneness was spot on. The mushrooms were delish. The cocktails were perfect. The bill was exorbitant. Yadda yadda yadda. That can be said for just about any steakhouse on the Strip (and I've been to several).

What sets the Old Homestead Steakhouse apart and will make us repeat diners is the wonderful service we received that made our evening.

We stopped by here after being told there was an hour-and-a-half long wait at Mesa Grill. The hostess remembered us from the night before (we had tried to stop for a nightcap the previous night, but were told by the assistant manager that they were closed). She said there were cancellations and she could seat us immediately. Nice. We were shown to a table, brought bread and water right away, and told that our server would be Kevin. 

Kevin turned out to be one of those industry pros, he'd been a server with the Caesar's restaurant for 30-some years. We took to him immediately as he matched our mood and temperament, and was happy to chat with us and give us the time and interaction we were looking for, even though he had at least two other large parties he was taking care of. The smallest of gestures caught his eye. He anticipated our needs. He was there with a hot finger towels after I was done gnawing on the bone of our NY steak. 

A quick note on the steaks - they had some interesting bone-in cuts you don't usually find at other steakhouses. The bone-in filet is on my bucket list.

The assistant manager came by at one point to apologize again for having to turn us away last night and thank us for coming back and giving the restaurant another change. 

We had to commend Kevin to the manager, Perry, who was very gracious and gave us his number for future reservations. Kevin said he'd make sure we got a better table next time too, although I didn't think there was anything wrong with the table we had. We didn't have dessert, as nothing in particular appealed to me and dinner was quite satisfying already. So we finished with port and scotch instead and I had the hankering for a bit of chocolate to go with my scotch. Kevin came to the rescue again, bringing me some dark chocolate curls that hit the spot. 

The Old Homestead treated us like regulars even though it was only our first time there. I think there is something to be said for a steakhouse or any restaurant that can make you feel that way on a first visit :)",CI0MxhxvVbhSgouy_z-ztw,1,0,5,JbCXkUjfyqMj4aaIncouoA

Everything from the steaks ($56 for a 26 oz bone-in ribeye!) and the sides (all $12, even the duck fat fries!) are obscenely overpriced....(damn you, casino-revenue-sharing!)

The meat (imported from New York so it must be really good, right?) is no better than Mastro's, Prime, Carnevino (also obscenely overpriced!!!), Joe's or Envy.
The wine list is good, but not spectacular.
The service is slightly better than adequate.
The bread-basket is ok, but ordinary: (hey look! it's pretzel bread! Wow.)
The decor is cliche New York club-style...(close your eyes and poof! you're at PJ Clarkes!)

There are better choices at better prices all over town, so I won't be returning anytime soon.
But the place was packed...so I have to assume it's either captive hotel-guests who didn't want to leave the premises...or a bunch of people partyin' before the Mayan apocalypse.

First they mixed up our orders. She likes a smaller steak medium and I like a larger steak medium rare. Her's came out medium rare and mine came medium.  I attempted to eat it, however it was SO dry and tasteless. I asked the waitress for one cooked properly, confirming with her medium rare. She took it back and brought me another one that was just slightly less than medium, definitely not medium rare. It had no juices and was as though they had squeezed all the juices out, totally tasteless and dry. I finally asked for some sauces to add some moisture to it. After suffering through about half, I gave up. 

I could have had a better steak at Sizzler and not cost over $200.

3971404,2014-09-07,3,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Before the Seinfeld show, I came here for dinner.  I was seated in a great area that gave me some privacy but I still had a view of the tourists walking by as they went down the hallway toward the Nobu Hotel section of Caesars.

My server was Roque and he was excellent throughout my time there.  He was at the table quickly with menus and taking my drink order.  He made some recommendations and I had some questions about the size of different items on the menu.  In the end, I opted for the 16 ounce bone in filet and an order of duck fat fries.  I asked for the steak to be extra rare.  A bit later, Roque returned and asked if I wanted the steak seared on each side.

The bread service was good with two kinds of bread--mini loaves of salted topped herb bread and two baguette rolls.  The butter was unsalted but the salt on the one loaf made up for it.  My iced tea was brought promptly and it was always refilled without asking throughout the time I was there.  Empty sweetener packs were removed quickly.

The steak was brought and it had an excellent char and was beautifully rare.  It was also a very flavorful steak.  The duck fries were seasoned well but there was nothing out of the ordinary with them.  I really wanted to pick up the bone and gnaw some more meat off but I decided against that.

I ordered doughnut bread pudding for dessert.  They make doughnuts every day, cool them, pull them apart, mix them back together with the liquid necessary to form bread pudding and bake it in a ring.  Later, it's reheated, topped with caramel sauce and a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream.  It was very good and a great way to end a meal.  There's no reason to mess around with an appetizer when you can save room for the sweet ending!

Roque came back several times during the meal to see if everything was OK and to check to see if I needed anything.  He learned that I was a local and we had some small talk about things to do around Las Vegas that make this place such a wonderful place to live--like hiking to work off a meal.

This was a good meal.  It's definitely Strip pricing and Caesars pricing, too, which makes it more than some other steakhouses of equal quality in the resort corridor.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,8,3,eabegQtIr5uacd6O9xd6Zg

4017082,2012-06-14,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"I went to Old Homestead with a couple of girlfriends this past Vegas trip. After already trying Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill on a previous trip we decided to give this place a try.  It is your typical Vegas upscale steakhouse, dark, classy, and loud.  First of all, I want to say that the food was AMAZING. The service however was not very good at all. I would rate the food 5 stars and the service 1 star.

Lets start with the food. They start you off with a bread and butter basket that contained mostly your generic rolls, rye bread, pretzel rolls, and my favorite the cheddar bacon roll (it sort of reminded me of the rolls they give you at red lobster but I'm not complaining). 

For an appetizer, we decided to share the calamari and a crab cake. Both were delicious! The calamari wasn't very different from any other fried calamari you can order but I had no complaints about it. The crab cake tasted very fresh and melted in your mouth.

For our entree's one of my girlfriends opted for the Kobe Burger. Our server informed us that the burger was absolutely gigantic and he was not lying. It came with some tater tots and she could not even finish half of her meal after that and the appetizers. As someone who does not eat a lot of red meat she joked that she couldnt believe she spent 42 dollars on a burger, but she said it was delicious and really enjoyed it. 

My other girlfriend got one of their salads and the mac and cheese side. Not something I would get at a steakhouse but to each their own. For what it's worth the salad tasted delicious and the mac and cheese was AWESOME, but you cant go wrong with mac n cheese can you?

I decided to order the petit filet mignon. I knew I wanted steak and I didn't want to pay too much for something I wouldn't finish so this 55 dollar entree was perfect for me. And it was divine! Best filet mignon I have had in a long time. So much flavor! It came with steak sauce and a bearnaise sauce, the steak sauce was good but the bearnaise was way better. I would recommend this dish to anyone.

Now to the service. Me and my friends are all in our early twenties and we definitely felt like victims of age discrimination here. The crowd is a mix of older and younger people but I didnt see many groups of females our age. The hostess was very polite and we got seated without reservations in less than 5 minutes. However from that point it took another 5-10 minutes for our server to come over and another 5-10 minutes just for him to bring us tap water. And it wasn't even him it was the bus boy. The food took a while to come out but that did not bother me as much as the fact that he very rarely stopped by our table to see if we were doing alright or if we needed anything. we gave most of our requests to the guy refilling water because our server was more concerned with chatting up guests who I am assuming he thought had a lot more money than we did. After we finished he left our dishes on our table for over 15 minutes before taking them away and asking if we needed the check. A good portion of that was spent right behind us talking to a table of two older couples about vegas hotspots. 

This kind of behavior would usually be enough to warrent a 1 star rating, but the food was so good that I had to give it more. I understand that servers do not want to deal with young cheapskates but me and my friends were all dressed nicely in dresses and we spent over 200 dollars on our meal  and tipped generously. I do not seem why he would treat us like 2nd class customers just because we look young.

After admitting to serving bad meat management assigned a mindless outside claims administration company to me. They barraged me with phone calls without any regard to the fact I made clear I did not intend to bring a claim. They also ignored my clearly messaged schedule and called me over and over. Eventually after I took the time to speak with them an imbecile denied my ""claim"" on the spot on the basis that I had no blood tests. 

Let's now focus on the experience. The wait was long, and the hostess clueless or overwhelmed. The martini I had was one shot of watered down liquor. I asked for it to be dirty and they satisfied my request by putting a single olive in the drink. The steak I ordered was minuscule and I figured out why after my first bite. It was all fat and grizzle which must have shrunk during cooking. It tasted like burnt grease and the meat was raw red, not medium as I had specified. The cream spinach was watery and tasteless. As I recall, I had much better in the frozen dinner meals I ate in college. The potatoes were doused in an overly rich cream that lacked taste. I was forced to run to the bathroom because I was sick, and during that time the fatty grizzle was removed from the table. One picture of that foul meat may have saved those who ignore this report from entering this swill pit.

1. How they raised their beef - it goes through a strict diet in the months before slaughter... (something like they only feed them corn or something like that). 

2. The interior deco of the restaurant - it sorta fees like you are dining underneath a bridge. Metals from a deconstructed bridge in NYC was brought here and used for its deco. 

3. How much they loved working there and pride themselves on service. 

Food wise, I felt that the beef didn't quite measure up to the hosts' high praise (which might have set our expectations too high). Firstly, the marbling wasn't good. The cut was too lean. Secondly, not every part of the meat was cooked evenly... some closer to well-done than medium. Hence, some parts were more dry than others. Thirdly, some parts had too much salt on it. Overall, it was still a decent steak... better than most places... but nowhere close to the ohmi wagyu beef I had at Shinzo, Singapore. The Japanese really know their beef. More that the Americans it seems! Some say they feed their beef only sake and massage them everyday!

Give me the right bread, and I will carb the heck out on the entire bread basket. Let me just say, this was the right stuff. They serve a variety including pumpernickel, pretzel bread, baguette, and more. My husband and I spilt one of every variety and I was in carb heaven. 

We wanted to start off by sharing a wedge salad, and were pleasantly surprised to find that it had already been spilt for us before being brought to the table. Many times, this is not the case with a wedge due to the presentation factor. However, our salads still looked beautiful as two little spilt wedges and they tasted even better.

Back to that beef. My husband and I each ordered the 8 oz. filet and both came out juicy and cooked to perfection. We chose the cheddar potato gratin for our side and were both confident we made the right selection after trying the first bite. It was ooey gooey cheesy goodness!

I'd love to go back in the future and maybe save room for one of their fabulous looking desserts by cutting out some of the bread beforehand. Well, maybe...",Y_t5q-UsgTwUEnzAQ73u1g,3,3,5,zWY9zRX9K-07_ZhqecX4bw

Meatball -- probably the best meatball I've had anywhere.  You expect it to be good at a steakhouse (since they use trimmings from high quality steak) but this somehow exceeded my expectations.

Crab cake -- the best overall dish.  All crab, not breading filler, and a great size.

Crab cocktail -- lump crabmeat, served on ice.  Unfortunately I ate this before taking a photo, but it was as good.  I personally prefer whole dungeness or king crab in shell, but this was a good amount of crab meat with less hassle in extracting it.

Mac and cheese -- a huge portion of very cheesy Mac and cheese, served in cast iron.  I only was abl to eat half of this, as I was stuffed, but it was very good.

Bar staff were friendly and prepared great drinks, too (I just had one Manhattan, as I have a work conference call in an hour).  The manager stopped by to check on me as well (maybe when he saw me taking photos of my food), and was friendly too.

The happy hour is a great value (show up closer to the beginning vs the end because they do tend to close the kitchen around this time), and I'll come back again for a full dinner sometime.

So..ambience is nice...think dark wood paneling, granite, very upscale inside. Service is what you would expect...top notch. 

They first brought out a container of various breads, which were delicious. Finally, we got down to business.

Oysters Rockefeller were seriously amazing. One of the better items on the menu without a doubt. 

I ordered bacon and a chopped salad (don't ask), which I shared with my friend. The bacon! Oh my god! It's approximately 1/4"" thick and delicious. Highly recommended. 

Chopped salad was delicious.

My brother got the filet mignon, which was tender enough to cut with a fork.

 We really thought we were going to get the best steak out there (high reviews with Yelp), when we went landed at the Old Homestead Steakhouse. Steaks are special, we only get them on special occasions: birthdays, dates with my husband......possibly once a month; anyway you pay for the best and expect the best. 

Ok, the food. The bread: mini loaves of different types of bread: pretzel, bacon, and some other flavors. It was pretty for the eyes, but when it came down the the truth they weren't extraordinary, just bread... the butter was great. 

We started with a salad: ""Everything in the Kitchen Sink"" ($30) ...sounds gross, but it had some real ingredients in it, to be qualify as a salad I'd be interested in: tomatoes, avocados, olives, salami (strips), bacon (pieces, not chunks, tasted at the end), blue cheese, shrimp,  and it was not an iceberg lettuce based type of salad. Bravo, the salad was beautifully tossed, and the ingredients were paired off well, nothing too over powering. It was an average salad. 

The main course: the ""Ribeye"" (16 oz. @ $50+) this is where my review will fall extremely sad.  You imagine: juicy fat marbling, thick and tender to every cut. Well it's all in your imagination here at the, ""Old Homestead Steakhouse"", because maybe the head chief went home early, sick, on an emergency note......the dinner crowd was gone, we were there after 9pm. When the ""Ribeye""came out it was a center piece on the platter, ok, I thought, ""this is going to be delicious"". What happened when I cut into it? Where was the ""Ribeye""???????? It was more like a BRISKET!!!! It was pathetic. Did they not think we would know? Of course I did not want to delay my dining experience with my colleagues by complaining and having them cook another steak, so I chewed on. : - (

When the 8 of us entered the place we did not have our own room and we are such snobs.

So we sat down not expecting much and boy were we in for a surprise.

Our service team of real professionals were kind, engaging and knowledgeable about the menu, the ingredients and the wine.

This place is know for its beef, so if you are not willing to even taste the small amounts you are offered by your table mates you should leave right away because you will be missing out in the thing that makes place a A#1 experience.

And this is from me... a person who eats beef less than 12 Times a year.

So, 

We ordered a large bottle of Malbec I think from Argentina and it was excellent.

The bread basket was overflowing but I only tried the  bacon cheddar rolls which were delicious and the fresh butter was an added plus.

We ordered the following appetizers: Oysters Rockefeller, crab cakes, bone marrow and fried calamari. Everything was beautifully prepared fresh and flavorful.

Then we got to the serious eating. Our entrees included Wagyu beef, filet mignon, salmon, scallops and New York steak.

We loved it all!!. I tried the wagyu beef which really did ""melt in your mouth"", and the scallops were plump and sweet.

After exploring Caesar's Palace for a bit and perusing the menu from the hostess, my friends and I settled on this place. It was about 7:30 on a Sunday, the restaurant was practically empty. The hostess took our name and made us wait five minutes. She proceeded to talk with the other hostess, flirt with someone, and stand there doing nothing while we waited. Red flag #1: waiting that long to be seated in an empty restaurant.

We're seated. And left to sit there with no water or bread for another five minutes. Water comes by. Oh yay water! Then the waiter comes by. We tell him we're ready to order. But he wasn't ready to take our order. This makes sense how?  He just stops by to say hi and give us a drink menu.

We're left to wait for another 5-10 minutes before the bread comes. If the bread didn't come any sooner, I was going to complain because I hadn't eaten all day and reallly could have used some form of sustenance. Keep in mind this is all in a nearly empty restaurant. No apologies regarding the bread or the water.

Our waiter comes by and, joy, he's now ready to take our order! We should feel so lucky! He takes our order. A bus boy actually comes by to ask us if we want more bread. I was so surprised by this and we welcomed it because we were famished.  Like all other reviews say, the bread basket is freaking good. Variety and its all tasty (even soft pretzel sticks. yum).

Given all the waiting we already did, our food came surprisingly fast. Honestly my sense of timing is off from all the waiting we did and my hunger, so the food either came quick or at the normal pace one would expect.

Our waiter never checked on us. He checked on tables around us. He chatted with them, mucked it up, had a blast. Who cares if we're enjoying our meal though, right?

Onto the food: the crab cakes are delicious, the mac n cheese side is in fact heavenly, the kobe burger is too (uhhh pricey though, sorry, I can get an infinitely better burger in Chicago for $5-$20), filet mingon is delicious. Everything is very good. Combine this with the service and price, beyond not worth it. If we received good service, I suppose that would negate the price, because you know, when you're spending this much money, you expect to be treated well. I wanted to chalk this up to the sticker shock of Vegas, but I was treated much better at different venues.",vJM5TkxT824e2teO3jdxVg,3,1,2,ViHbXAhFlksRssjcB_NOow

The food came promptly and starting with the appetizers; 
The Meatball with marinara was the best I ever tasted (and I have a Grandmother from Italy.) The fresh horseradish sauce had an incredible taste. Shrimp cocktail was cooked to perfection and the presentation made it almost too stunning to eat. BUT WE ATE WELL

The finest sear and temperatures on our cuts of beef. The Lollipop Rib Eye was juicy and so tender. We had several sauces that enhanced the flavor however the steaks did not need any help they were soft as mousse. I think the red wine demi glaze was my favorite. 

On to the sides..... I can not choose which was my favorite!!!  The gnocchi and truffle with its velvety texture and creamy buttery sauce made more than one set of eyes role at the table. I could eat that everyday. 
The corn with jicama was infused with so much flavor and the crisp of the jicama added a great balance. 
The tater tots and fat boy sauce added comfort to an already perfect meal.
The flavors were so impressive and each side complemented the next.

We shared 4 desserts
I am not a big chocolate fan but....
I am ruined by their Chocolate chip pizzokie style dessert, no other cookie will do now!
The Layered Chocolate Rasberry cake was perfectly moist and the right amount of sweetness.
My first time trying Bananas Foster and I can not believe I have been missing out on this decadent dessert.
The Key Lime Pie..... I ate it as slowly as possible for I didn't want it to come to an end.

We were able to thank the Sous Chef Ruben Garcia and he was friendly and professional. Worth the money and time. I will go there again and I will recommend to anyone I know who travels to Vegas.

The decor was modern, clean, and simple.  Our plates had napkins folded neatly and displayed different cuts of meat, mine was Filet.  Our waiter was fantastic and eager to talk about the menu regardless of it being the end of his shift.

I ate at this location years ago when it was Neros and still think highly of it.

I know the way it was cooked would be great for most people but I like my steaks medium which is pink in the middle. I sent my steak back for it to be cooked a little more then it came back well done. I guess it's my own fault for asking to have it cooked a little more. The quality of the beef was disappointing. I've had steaks that are well done and it is still tender but this was chewy and under seasoned. The scallops on the other hand were great. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.

4761292,2012-01-15,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Where to begin another high end steak house in Las Vegas is like adding insult to injury. Staying at Caesars Place for a Work conference, and after having some finger food at the corporate event 3 of us decided to head for a real meal just off the Casino at the recently opened Old Homestead of sister fame NYC / AC.  I have dinned in both Atlantic City and New York and both have been exceptional. With so many choices for me here, I was reluctant but excited to get that Steak they have become so accustomed to delivering. 

OK checked into the hotel went to the concierge and asked that he make us a reservation for 4 for 8:45PM they tell me 9PM no problem. He will call me if there is an issue, I tip him and off I go to my conferences and social events. 8:45 arrive to the restaurant and no reservation can be found, under no name.  Strike 1.  The girl is apologetic but nothing she can do for me it's simply not there. She says give me a few I'll see what I can do.  Lucky to find a high top bar table round barely big enough for 3 but we put 4 here rather than wait for a dining table that could be 45 minutes or so.  Waiter was good and took our drink orders, and brought some fresh bread with some pretzel sticks in it. Pretty good and enjoyable. 

Order of Onion rings were ordered for an appetizer along with two salads. Vine Ripened tomatoes & red onions and INE RIPENED TOMATO AND HOMESTEAD CHOPPED 12TOMATO, ONION, MUSHROOM, PEPPERS, HARICOT VERTS, BLACKOLIVES, CRUMBLED BLUE CHEESE AND BASIL VINAIGRETTE Large portions on the salads easily split able and the onion rings were ok ""$12.00"" but nothing you can't find at a good sports bar.  Salads were very good and by far the best thing all night.

Dinner is served:  New York Strip $54.00 ""Charred Medium Rare""  No char and although this was one tender cut of meat it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever? Where was the dry rub? Sea salt? simply non descript but certainly not a bad piece of meat just tasteless.  The filet didn't fare much better 10 Oz $48.00 again Medium rare and filet not having much flavor to begin with was also lacking something.  The Rib Eye Gotham Cut on the bone $54.00 22 Oz was the best of the 3 but there was entirely too much bone vs. meat and not a $54.00 cut of steak.

What really was a disaster were the two side dishes $12.00 each Garlic Mashed potatoes were like MUSH. They were flat, tasteless and runny a complete and utter embarrassment.  The Sauteed mushrooms $12.00 were like something found in your backyard that you decided to throw in a pan with some olive oil and sauté real quick. Another complete and utter cluster ****.  

No Deserts were wanted or tried.  I am trying to objective here but for the price points you simply can't have tasteless steaks regardless of the quality and presentation and the disaster side dishes put this on the not ever again list for me at least not in Vegas.  Del Frisco's and the Palm for that matter 100 yards down on the left in the forum shops are much better dining options.   El Paso for this traveler.",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,6,0,2,9wUYKbl9-cR7GPd485AMMQ

It was crowded, but that did not affect the level of service we received or our comfort level.  The bread basket they bring is fantastic, as many note.  It may be the best gratis bread basket I've eaten at a steakhouse.  The cheesy muffins were out of this world good, I wish they would sell them so I can bake them at home.  Watch out you don't fill up on bread at this place.

To start, we had the garlic bread and calamari.  The garlic bread was stacked liked a small jenga tower, and sitting in a bed of cheese sauce.  It was crunchy and delicious when dipped in the sauce.  The calamari was likewise good, it had some peppers in it, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it Rhode Island style.  But, the peppers added some nice spice.  The breading was crisp and adhered to the calamari well.

To eat, we had the porterhouse for 4.  This was a good amount of steak for 4 people with sides, but if you are looking to eat a 25 ounce steak or larger on your own, it's not a good selection for you.  I preferred the NY strip side of the porterhouse, as I always do.  But, both sides were perfectly cooked to medium rare and had a nice char.

For sides, we had the lobster mac n cheese (which was a special I believe), the creamed spinach, and the famous tater tots with fat boy sauce.  The fat boy sauce is basically sour cream, large pieces of bacon, and shredded cheese mixed together.  The creamed spinach was fantastic, maybe the best version of this dish I've ever had.  It had a great crust on it and excellent flavor.  I had seconds, which makes the meal healthy because I had a vegetable, right?  

The mac and cheese was solid, but I've had better at many other steakhouses.  The tater tots were the real winner for me, they are large, but were perfectly fried and done in the middle.  You could taste that they are made of potato, which is not the case with most fast food tater tots.  The sauce was great on them as well.  I think returning to OH for a burger at lunch and enjoying these may be in my future.

We had baked Alaska for dessert.  It's always cool seeing it lit on fire, but this dish doesn't do it for me.  Not just at OH, but anywhere really.

My wife ask for a refill of water 3 times, which she never got. The main server seemed very disinterested in waiting on our table.

Minus a star for no vegan entree (not a surprise though) and no dessert.  Most places at least have a sorbet.

Pricey, yes ($100+ for my meal, plus 2 glasses of wine!), but it is a nice place, great ambiance, even dining solo at the bar.

5056957,2013-05-21,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"After a weekend at Caesar's Palace with a good buddy and his gf's family & friends. A weekend that included poolside cabanas, drinking and lots of gambling. Well, I didn't do any drinking but everyone else did more than make up for my shortcomings in that category! Anyways, the finale night dinner on Sunday found us here.
It was probably a good thing we had a reservation. The place was packed and I heard it was booked fairly solid for this particular weekend. It's located across from Nobu and resides in the spot Nero's used to occupy I believe. The restaurant consists of dimmed lights and a classy looking decor. Prices seemed about on par for a steakhouse on the Strip. If  I remember correctly, Old Homestead originates from New York.
The bread basket is crazy, for starters. Loaded basket. Pretzel bread, mini dinner roll with coarse salt on top, crusty mini french roll and bacon, asiago & cheddar muffin. My buddy asked for extra butter and I guess they remembered because on our second bread basket we got these two massive blocks of butter along with it.
Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. Drinks were filled constantly and we were checked on a few times to see if we needed anything else.
I had the 16oz filet mignon on the bone. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. We shared sides of potato gnocchi with truffle butter, asparagus & mushrooms. Loved the asparagus and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was so rich with the truffle butter. For our party of five. We were suggested that three sides would be enough since the portions are fairly large. When we saw them, they didn't seem that 'large'. We probably could have gone with four, or even five and been ok. Considering we demolished the sides we had ordered.
Suffice to say we all left full and satisfied. Anything less would be a disappointment when you pay this much for good food. Solid 4 stars.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,0,0,4,pZiDTJOVyPj-XWAgLHQQHw
5094846,2012-08-08,9,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"A NYC steakhouse institution.  You better heed and respect that when you dine here else fuggeddaboutit.  Established in 1868, it has become upscale everyday dining for decision makers or those with large expense accounts.  It is not a romantic fine dining or family centric restaurant.

Without insulting anyone, the Old Homestead also has the hurried ambiance / attitude of NYC.  Close tables, prompt but abrupt service, a ""I don't waste your time, don't waste mine"" type of vibe.  Classic NYC.  It might not suit everyone.  You've been warned.

For starters, the classics shine.  Oysters Rockefeller is delicious.  Just warmed through oyster topped with the essence of bacon, spinach and a rich bernaise sauce.  One dimensional creaminess with a flavor explosion.  The Maryland crab cake is equally good.   More filler than most contemporary crab cakes but it works.  The filler soaks up the crab juices to create a milder crab flavor with a heightened crab perfume.  Deeply browned crust adds texture.  The accompanying red pepper aioli just works.

Steaks are excellent.  USDA top Prime.  Well trimmed.  Well aged.  Outstanding sear.  Huge cuts (18oz New York, 26oz ""Gotham Rib"", 16 oz Filet Mignon).  The signature 16oz bone in filet  is outstanding.  Very thick cut (almost two inches thick) with a  beautiful sear and even cooking.  Makes your mouth all kinds of happy if you cut through the entire piece and enjoy the contrasting temperature, juiciness, and flavors of the full thickness of the piece.  Light beef flavor.  Mild umame.  The Gotham Rib has a much more pronounced beefy flavor.  Excellent in its own way.  More than enough for two.

Sides are traditional.  Not as large as you might expect from a steakhouse but still sharable.  Creamed spinach and home made tater tots are as good as any.

Outstanding wine list focusing on US producers.  Vegas resort pricing.

Tip:  Bring your Total Rewards card for a 1-5 percent discount on the menu.  Tier does not matter.

For a glass of wine and never received it, few people had to ask for things multiple times. If you are going to add 20% for a large party... Then have service that reflects that. The food was good but they messed up majority of the steak temperatures. I think the issue was the waiter could not match what was ordered with where people were sitting. Atleast half of the steaks were delivered at wrong temps, as a steak house this should be a priority. Many people just ate them but a few were sent back. One was still at the incorrect temp.

FOOD: We ordered the Bone-In Porterhouse with asparagus and lobster mac and cheese on the side. I can still remember the taste and how perfect it juicy it was.

I found the one in Caesers as I was walking through on time and made this a regular spot.

First, almost always seating at the bar, decent wine selection, a bit overpriced but not too much so.  I almost always get some kind of whiskey / bourbon drink.  They have a great bread basket that comes out, quick tip, before they bring it out just ask them to bring the bacon biscuits and that's it.  They will bring 3-4 out in lieu of the other types of bread (sourdough and pretzel), fantastic.

I almost always just get the 8oz filet, medium rare and duck fat fries.  Perfect easy meal.  I have tried the Crispy calamari, slab bacon, creamed spinach, garlic mash and all of those are absolutely top notch.

We had walked by Friday and it was PACKED and thought this would be an awesome place to try. They don't take reservations between 6-9 so we made reservations for 530. Good thing because by 630 there was already a small line forming by the hostess stand. I really like the openness and vibe of the restaurant and the staff were all very attentive, minus the hostess. (We walked by earlier to make a reservation at 545 and the hostess standing NEXT to the one we were talking to CHIMED IN with ""We don't accept reservations from 6-9PM"" We were like... Okay.... we wanted a reservation at 545!"" Needless to say she minded her own business after that.)

We arrived at our reservation and was promptly seated. Our waiter checked on us every so often throughout dinner to see if we needed anything and the other staff were so animated, friendly, and helpful. The bread basket came with a lot of different kinds of bread but we had to limit the bread intake because we ordered so much yummy food!

Since there were 5 of us we ordered A TON OF FOOD:

Lobster Bisque: This was very tasty and rich. The lobster pieces were so big and the quality is just really up there. 

Crab Cakes: Also, really big pieces of crab. The cakes are smaller, but tall so there was still a lot of it. The sauce was also really good. Only thing about this was that it broke apart so easily so it was harder to eat with a fork.

Fried Calamari: This was the only thing that I didn't enjoy that much. The pieces were kind of soggy and just fell apart when picked up with a fork. We left a lot on this plate untouched.

Porterhouse Steak for 2: This came out on a piping hot place with butter and they served it for us. It included filet and strip steak. It was a good amount and the filet was really nice and tender.

Filet Mignon on the Bone: This was SOOO TENDER and tasty! It was a HUGE piece of filet mignon and just so delicious. This is something I would get again!

Prime Rib on the Bone: When this came out I was thinking... holy... this was so BIG! It looked really juicy, but I didn't try it because I was so full... I think this piece is actually enough for TWO though.

Dover Sole: One of the servers filleted the sole off of the bone tableside and gave us a nice show which was pretty amusing. The sauce was a lemony sauce and the fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly. 

For sides we tried:
Duck fat french fries: try these without ketchup and you can really taste the difference. I was still craving these the next day!

Creamed spinach: Nice and creamy, but didn't stand out too much.

Sauteed Mushrooms: I really liked how they put a variety of mushrooms in here and not the usual white mushrooms. 

Mashed Potatoes: These were mashed pretty finely and just melt in your mouth goodness! 

And of course dessert: 
Ice Cream over chocolate chip cookie: This was like a pizookie from BJ's but the cookie was must more moist and it was a great finish to a wonderful meal.

I would have to say that they also have a good collection of wines, but when you ordered cocktails the glasses are pretty tiny... like smaller than the average by a lot. 

This is def a great place to get steak although it is a bit pricey... but hey, it's Vegas. Everything's a little more pricy... I feel it's worth it because the portions are so big and the quality is so good!",gPh8rpoOq2hjyhF2pAdn2A,5,1,4,XozoQ1X2U4Be6W-582xOWA

We usually stay at Harrahs and then have dinner at the Range, but I wanted to switch it up. Saw a review somewhere re the bread basket and bacon appetizer at the Old Homestead Steakhouse and made the decision to have my three favorite items all in one meal.  Made reservations in advance of the trip and were promptly seated at 8:00 on a Thursday night.  Definitely a special occasion-type restaurant, unless dropping $200+ is no big deal to you.  Had to use the flashlight app on the phone to read the menu to confirm the choices I had already made beforehand. Started with the bacon appetizer, which was one big (1/4"" thick?) slab of bacon, and the tuna tartare (a/k/a poke). We split the Kitchen Sink Salad and I ate every bit on my plate.  Combined with a sample of each roll in the bread basket, I was a bit full for my New York with Bernaise.  The BF's prime rib was huge and perfectly cooked.  We ended up taking half our dinners back to the hotel for a late night snack.  They packed them in nice containers and were thoughtful enough to add a container of sauce, napkins, and swanky plastic utensils.

The service was just as amazing as the food. They bring out a basket of different breads to munch on. The bacon bread..YUMMM. The lemon bread was not so great, but there was plenty of other ones to try. I don't eat steak so I had the chicken and boy was it great. The accompanying sauce was divine. My friends loved their food as well. Even as a non-meat eater, I was able to appreciate the presentation (even though it freaked some of them out LOL!). 
After our meal, they brought out complimentary birthday desserts for the table, the apple cobbler was delish-that's coming from a huge chocolate fan!.

5455825,2017-08-03,4,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"CAESARS PALACE SWEEPSTAKES WINNER ADVENTURE #7: LAST COMPED DINNER

When I won the ""I Am Caesars"" Indulgence Sweepstakes for Caesars Palace 50th Anniversary one of the perks I would get is $600 dining credit. For months I had this premonition of how to exploit the dining credit. I would apply half of the dining credit at Restaurant Guy Savoy. The rest of the balance I would use it at another restaurant and room service. After months of deliberation I decided not to eat at Restaurant Guy Savoy or have room service to apply my dining credit. That other restaurant I decided to use my dining credit was Old Homestead Steakhouse because I wanted to use my dinner credit for one night at a steakhouse. 

On my last night at Caesars Palace I ate here for dinner. I started my trip with $600 dining credit. The first two nights I used less than $400. I asked the person who was coordinating my trip if the balance from the last two dinners could be applied for this one last dinner. She said yes. On my last night I had $237 to comp for my final dinner. I was going to go out on style. Of course I was going to order steak. My favorite type of steak is bone-in. The bone in the steak adds a natural flavor to the steak. I thought about ordering the bone-in filet mignon. However I asked my server what bone-in steaks he would recommend. He stated either the porterhouse or rib eye, which he highly suggested. So I decided the ribeye. The only dilemma I had was if I was going to order the ""Gotham"", which is a 24 oz. steak for one person, or the ""Lollipop"", which is a 38 oz. steak for two people. However I was going to order the ""Lollipop"" for myself. The cost difference between the two cuts of bone-in rib eye steak was $43 as the ""Lollipop"" costs $125 and the ""Gotham"" costs $82. I decided to get the ""Gotham"" as it was less expensive of the two steaks. However by ordering the ""Gotham"" I can order more items such a side dish and a cocktail. For this last night I thought about getting wine with my steak. When I looked at the cocktail menu one item stood out. In honor of me winning the Caesars Palace ""I Am Caesars"" Sweepstakes I ordered the Roman 75 mainly because the name Roman. Since I was eating at Caesars Palace it made sense to order caesars salad. In addition I ordered lobster mac and cheese and Atlantic salmon. 

I didn't order any appetizers but ate the warm bread that this restaurant serves. I have a weakness for warm, crusty bread and soft butter. The bread was really good. However I had to pace myself with the bread because of the rib steak and the lobster mac and cheese. The ""Gotham"" arrived medium rare. I always order my steak medium rare. A major pet peeve of mine is when customers order their steak well done especially on high-priced steaks. Even though I wasn't going to pay for the steak I wasn't going to order an $82 well done steak. The ""Gotham"" wasn't the best steak I've ever had but it was flavorful. There's something unique about a bone-in steak as the combination of bone, fat, and meat enhances the steak's flavor. Since the steak cost $82 I took my time eating the steak - as if I was a Caesar. I like the Roman 75 cocktail as it had a lemonade, liquor taste that made the cocktail refreshing. The Atlantic salmon was flaky yet moist. The item that was disappointing was the lobster mac and cheese, which is the main reason I didn't rate this place five stars. There were little chunks of lobster. The only lobster flavor you can taste is the bisque or broth in the mac and cheese. 

At the end I had $237 to exhaust my dining credit. The final bill was $218 without taxes meaning I left $19 on the table. When I was ordering I didn't really keep count of how much the final bill would be. I thought maybe I should have ordered another side dish such as duck fat fries, gnocchi with truffle butter, or seared foie gras. Or better yet not ordering the lobster mac and cheese, which I would have saved $26. Add the $19 I would have $45 left meaning I should've ordered the ""Lollipop"". I learned a lesson never sacrifice a main dish for a side dish. I could've ordered desserts but to be honest I was full due to the lobster mac and cheese. 

During my free 3-night stay at Caesars Palace I had 3 comped dinner: Rao's, Mesa Grill, and Old Homestead Steakhouse. Each restaurant had their own characteristics, but I was grateful that I never paid one cent while I dined at Caesars Palace - a true hallmark of living like a Caesar. Would I eat at Old Homestead Steakhouse again? Given the prices and that I had a comped dinner I would eat here again if I win big at the slots or craps. If I do come back here again due to my large gambling winnings I wouldn't hesitate to order the ""Lollipop"" along with the thick-cut slices of bacon from the menu.",4hVHTZhy70Sw4gmQfk1pJg,10,13,4,bZEG0LTxrm3fv2FiS6oBuA
5467744,2012-02-06,3,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"We went to Old Homestead on Jan 29, and I was so looking forward to it, especially given the reputation of its renowned NYC parent.  Geez, was I disappointed. The service was great, but the food absolutely sucked. The cook(s), for whatever reason, either wouldn't or couldn't properly cook mine or my wife's filets ... medium-well ... which isn't that hard to do. They tried three times and never got the steaks beyond medium rare, but they burned the outside of the steaks to hell. Needless to say, the steaks were completely ruined at that point. And when the concierge came to our table, he only asked if our food was okay. When we said it wasn't, his reply was, ""Yeah, I saw you send it back.""

When our server came to our table a couple of minutes later and asked if the manager had come over, we said no, but that the concierge had. The server then informed us that it wasn't the concierge at all, but rather the manager (he never introduced himself as the manager). Of course, he never came back over to the table or attempted to rectify the problem in any way whatsoever. He didn't even bother to offer an apology on behalf of the restaurant. However, he had absolutely no problem charging us $192.42 for an absolutely crappy meal.

This place sucks and I'll never go back, nor will I recommend it to anyone ... except to recommend they not go. The Old Homestead in Caesars replaces another steakhouse that was called Neros. While Neros was nothing to write home about, it was lightyears better than The Old Homestead. As such, avoid this dump at all costs.",c__hhyluKJx0tpfnb945wQ,5,1,1,Qfm4d4t-vSVEXCsRwClOFw

This is one of the few times that I have eaten at a Las Vegas steakhouse, the other time was Vic and Anthony's at the Golden Nugget Casino. This steakhouse is at Caesar's Palace next to Nobu's Japanese Restaurant, You cannot mistake the Old Homestead Steakhouse as a steakhouse because there is a giant steer suspended above the entrance to the steakhouse. 
We were greeted cordially by the hostess and led to our table. We were quickly met by our waiter who was very nice and efficient. We started with the lobster bisque which was delicious. I ordered a filet mignon, my wife the salmon, our guests, the New York strip and his girlfriend, the halibut. Everything is a la carte but the portions are large enough to share for the table. We got steamed broccoli, wild mushrooms, and asparagus. We ordered a nice bottle of wine which comes with a wine lady who was very nice.
Everything was great except the halibut did not come out to well and was undercooked. The waiter was very nice and took it back and he gave us additional free side orders as well as free desert for the trouble. Even the manager came out to apologize. Now that's what I call service. We ordered the Big Fat Chocolate Cake but the slice was so big and we were so full, we took it home instead.
I enjoyed myself here and our friends picked up the tab which made it taste even better. Word to the wise, when you go to a steakhouse, don't order the fish.

We've had all the major steakhouses covered in some 60+ days of meat hunting in vegas, and I can say that this probably has the best meat QUALITY of the lot.  I didn't say it was cheap, and while we did have some sides and dessert, there was nothing that was notches above the rest, although I have heard that the Lobster Bisque (one member of our party lunched here the same day) is remarkable.

The porterhouse for 3 and 26oz rib eye (all medium rare) was split amongst three hungry grown men and we all agreed this was not only cooked to perfection, but divided up perfectly by our skillful waiter.  We were told all the meats we ordered were aged 30 days, and it sure felt that one once it hit our palates.  I'm not sure how the strip could be so nearly as tender as the filet, or how the filet could have been so beefy, but some of that ladle full of grease smeared on top at service could have been responsible.

Once we were done, we carried on carving the succulent bits off the bone and proceeded with the uncouth behavior of just gnawing it off. 

I mean, we paid a good premium for 3 bottles of Cab, so that was an excuse to just forget about etiquette altogether.

Let's face it, this may not sound like a steakhouse, but it's one. Don't count on ambiance - AT ALL.  If you need a meat fix at some of the highest prices in Vegas, go to the Old Homestead.  If you want better ambiance at 90% of the quality, go to SW.  If you want to see and be seen, go to Prime.",z_JeiqsehVkT-89DbwKbHA,0,0,4,22VKS2LkknrEpS8pq7SjHQ
5550025,2012-02-15,10,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"I'm being really generous with my review for this restaurant because a)  it is brand new and b) it is one of the few steakhouses that actually knows how to put a good crust on a steak, but it is too bad the quality of the meat doesn't benefit from it.

As people have said this place is massively packed, at least on the weekends.  Making a reservation does not change the fact that you get a table basically when one is open.  It could be immediately or it can be 30 minutes, it depends on how fast people eat.

As for the hostesses, they will treat you badly once you get there.  Except thankfully, due to my ethnic background, I let it be known that I was so annoyed with them about how slow they seat you, that after awhile I scared them into accommodating me - but it was a really tiny table.

As far as the food goes - Chris M was correct, the best thing about eating at Old Homestead is the bread basket.  It is fantastic, and beats the pants out of the steakhouses I've had in town so far.

As far as the rest here is a rundown of what I tried:

Appetizers
Caesar Salad - they do it whole leaf style where you knife and fork it.  Good, but nothing that made it stand out.  It's a caesar salad so I didn't expect to be wowed, but it was tasty.

French Onion Soup - this soup usually has some deep flavors when it is cooked properly, such as they do at Marche Bacchus.  Old Homestead's soup is none of that.  It does not taste like they spent a long time developing flavors, and on top of it they mask what little flavor there is with a boatload of sherry that seems like it was added at the end.  But french onion soup is like pizza, where even a bad one is still okay to eat.  If you are picky about flavors I would not order this, but some people will gravitate towards this soup and enjoy it no matter what.

Steaks
Bone in Ribeye and Bone in NY Strip - both of these steaks, as I said above had the most amazing char, something I have complained about that is lacking at most steakhouses in town.  My husband and I were so happy to see this.  However, when we both cut into the steak, even though we both ordered medium rare, both steaks were so overcooked that they were about medium well.  It was insanely disappointing.  On top of it, it did not have that aged yummy flavor that most of the high end steakhouses serve when you get these cuts of meat, which made it even more disappointing.  I'm sure if someone ordered a fillet, which doesn't depend on aging for flavor, would have been happy with their dish, had it been cooked at the right temperature. So my recommendation for meat is, order the fillet!

Sides
We only ordered one side, and that was the beets.  I can't speak for the more carby sides as I try to avoid that at these places.  Beets aren't that hard to cook, you just put them in tin foil and shove them in the oven for an hour or so.  Apparently, that is a little too hard for Old Homestead and all the beets were undercooked to different degrees.  Some were just raw, but heated up a little.

I would recommend not going to Old Homestead for awhile, until they can get into some groove and  improve on the aging of their steak to compete with some of the other places around town.  If you do go, only order the fillet, but if you crave a ribeye or other steak, go walk over to Carnevino.  The pricing is pretty much the same at both places, outrageous.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,11,9,3,D6qJRq7ZKlOQiETDDtBRBQ

4.25 stars

          Old Homestead Steakhouse is more of a classic steakhouse. Every thing is big here in portion, it reminds me of Nick and Sam's in TX or Gibson Steakhouse in Chicago; classic, darker dining room, casual diners, classic steakhouse and seafood menu. 

          The moment we walked in, the 2 hostesses were greeted my nieces nicely, then right way, we got seated at our table. Our server was Berk, he was nice, and chatted up with my nieces, made them feel like princesses. 

         The wine list was good, but I'm surprised on the limited of wines by the glass. They seem to focus on US wines; I tried to order Bordeaux, Burgundy, Rhone, or even Italian wines by the glass, just US wines for now!?

        Another thing bother me was the photographer, she told us it was $25 for picture; then she came back with $65, $85, dropped down to $45? My nieces were confused, and I thought that was cheesy . 

        Excited for chef Tim Henderson in the kitchen, we were looking forward to try his food. 

SALADS:
- Kitchen Sink Salad - shrimp, salami, bacon, avocado, tomato, hearts of palm, blue cheese & Champagne vinaigrette - Good size, generous to share.

- Roased Heirloom Beets - arugula, goat cheese, tangerine vinaigrette - I love this salad, light, and citrus, nice to start a nice meal.

RAW BAR:
- Shellfish Platter - Maine Lobster, GIGANTIC King Crab Legs, Nigeria Spot Parwns, BC Kusshi oysters, Long Islands Blue Point Oysters; this was the first time I tried Nigeria parwns, they are so big; bigger than 3.5 oyster length. They were sweet and tasty. The King crab legs were nice, fresh. My nieces and I finished this giant platter in like 25 minutes!

APPETIZERS:
- Thick Cut Applewood Smoked Bacon - the aroma was insane, with steak sauce recommended by our server Berk. We all loved this dish.

- Kobe Meatball - marinara, ricotta chese. Now most of the folks might not know this or that they don't care; but if you like me, ""Steak is my FAV pet"" you know that KOBE doesn't export steak to the US for at least the last 5-6 years. So I guess this must be a TYPO on the Old Homestead Steakhouse part. Anyway, my nieces loved it, this meatball was the biggest meatball I've ever ate! It's bigger than my knee, and it was quite tasty! 

STEAK and side dishes:
- The ""Sherry Brothers"" New York Strip - 18 OZ for only $62, clean cut, aged over 30 days, it was clean, juicy, and tasty. If you like a clean cut, this is it, cheaper than the filet mignon cut, but 10 OZ bigger, great to share with a big group of friends.

- The ""Gotham Rib"" Steak on the bone - Rib eye, wow this was 26 OZ cut; it was so juicy, perfectly cooked more on the rare for me; so tender; and I love the charred edges, tasty and a bit fat can do you wonder! It's only $71, this is a STEAL deal for this giant ribeye. I can see my mom would fall in love with this cut! Enough to feed 3 people!

- Duck Fat fries - my nieces was going crazy at this. Why something tasted this good can be bad for your body???

- Potato Gnocchi with Truffle Butter - this was rich, but 1 of my nieces enjoyed it because she eats anything with butter in it!

- Fire Roasted Corn - this was so sweet and sauteed nicely. I finished this side dish myself :-)

DESSERT: The kids had the cast iron skillet of Warm Banana Bread Pudding, caramelized bananas and a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream. I was amazed that they were still going at it!

           The menu also offer Australian Wagyu 10 OZ cut fore only $160. If you live in Northern California, you know of Alexander's Steakhouse, you look at paying around mid $200, so for those who complained about the pricing here. I'm in shock.

          You want a good aged piece of steak anything in the $70 range is reasonable, and for Vegas, you should add at least 50% on top of it. 
I'm so tired of seeing all these non-sense Yelpers gave bad reviews, when all they eat were fast food and caged beef in their life. What knowledge do you have to consider yourself a 'blogger"" of ""foodie""? Because I'm not!

         It likes you complain that a Ferrari is too expensive, and you drive a 10 years old Saturn? Hello, they both take you from home to work or school. Same goes for steakhouse; so they are all beef, go to your belly right? Is that how you write your review? Do you live in an apartment with roommates and compare to million dollars beach front mansion, and complain the mansion is too expensive? Or is it because you can't afford it? How do you judge?

        If you want value, and a good traditional steakhouse, come here. Got more value than most steakhouses on the strip; and you can tell them I send you. If you come in with good attitude, you will have a great meal. Because I did.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,14,13,5,INPNdtbuoNV2sVS-O8NXyw

5734597,2013-04-01,0,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"I can't leave Vegas without a steak. The trick is finding a spot, with at least one high dollar steakhouse in each casino. The need to book a large party on short notice tied my hands and narrowed the options a little, and we landed at Old Homestead. Interestingly, while I couldn't get a table for 6...we were seated at a table for 6...as a party of five. Whatever.

We indulged for this one - east and west coast oysters were very good, with nice trimmings. One friend may have found his next expensive hobby, having had his first oysters here after I suggested them. We also had their calamari, which is the traditional fried rings, but is super tender and flavorful, without having a heavy, greasy breading. And I had the steakhouse wedge salad, which I usually don't order, but just seemed right. The salad was HUGE - practically half a head of lettuce, delicious chewy thick bacon, so thick it was basically cubed, cherry tomatoes, and a heaping helping of Maytag bleu cheese. I have to order Maytag - it's from Iowa and so am I (kinda). Plus it's very good. This was a great salad. I ate almost all of it, which was kind of a mistake. I wish I had saved a bit more appetite for the steak.

My steak was the filet on the bone, which was pretty great. Very tender, cooked to an almost perfect medium rare, with wonderful flavor from the bone and the right amount of salt and pepper crust. No need to mess with it any further. I'm starting to love the bone-in filet as a happy medium between the sometimes low-flavor filet and the flavorful but oversized and overly rich bone-in ribeye. This definitely delivered. Our sides were the mac and cheese and the tater tots with ""fat boy"" sauce. These were OK - the tots were clearly homemade, but were a little big - they needed more crisp surface area. The fat boy sauce turned out to basically just be baked potato fixings. I might skip those in the future. The mac and cheese was just kind of basic mac and cheese. I think we could have selected better here, but it didn't get in the way of a great steak.

Our service was friendly and prompt, and the sommelier was friendly and informed without being too snooty (as I seem to think they all are, but then, I'm not a drinker). Price was, I think, on par with what your upper tier steakhouses are going to cost. You can get slightly reduced prices here with whatever Ceasar's player's club card is, a couple bucks off here and there. But it does add up, especially with a large party. Might buy you an extra drink. But for the minimum effort required to sign up, it's worth doing.

If I had to think about the three steakhouses I've been to in Vegas, I think this is the best. It's certainly better than N9NE, and I think it's better than Signature Room at Mandalay Bay as well. So having my hand forced to Old Homestead was not a let down. I would definitely return.",tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA,0,0,4,0ww1NUD1LFIVVNctHy7SEA

We were stuck deciding between the Wagyu and Japanese Wagyu. Our server suggested the Japanese and so we went with it. There was an error and the American Wagyu was brought out and we were not impressed. However, our server saw there was a mistake and bright out the Japanese Wagyu immediately (we had no clue we were brought the wrong dish) and there is no comparison! The American Wagyu honestly taste like a filet mignon...
The Japanese Wagyu was prepared perfectly and the meat was so juicy!  I fell in love with this dish.  If you're stuck between which one based on the price tag, the extra you pay is definitely worth it. 

It might seem like the server is trying to upsell you but the difference is Japanese and American Wagyu truly is on quality. This is coming from someone who tried both side to side :P",WTWe_JqDZlnYAJ8_BOWCyA,0,0,5,3sh0RcnfFNkIT90jQycngA

I was in the mood for Seafood, so I ordered the Pan seared Atlantic Salmon with Asian vegetables. My Sweetie once again ordered his usual which is out of this world, the Empire cut of prime rib on the bone.

My salmon melted in my mouth, so buttery and flavorful! 

The prime rib will never let us down, talk about a mouth orgasm!!! I had a few bites of his and I was moaning in complete pleasure. The staff was worried at first however I am sure soon realized I was in a momentary state of Ecstasy upon the swivel of my mouth. My boyfriend nodded and whispered that I was OK, just enjoying the food. 

Must have sides...Fried Calamari and homemade Tater Tots w/fat boy dipping sauce, it is sour cream, chives, cheese, and BACON mmmm yum!

I often dream about their tater tots, was so glad to get my fill. I have had a mad craving for these tasty golden nuggets of yum!

They have a rich and delicious mac and cheese, made with four different cheeses, mmm so good however would have been too much to order this time since the portions are so generous. 

As always service is Top Notch! The ambiance is Wonderful! Food of course is always Incredible!

The menu is pricey, however you get what you pay for. This is a Classy Steakhouse and the portions are very generous! You will leave here stuffed, very full so come hungry!

5890409,2014-06-21,6,gdWy-x5KbCbMrwIwI87mMg,"Meh. Considering the price and location, this meal should have been better. In Vegas, there are endless really good steakhouses. This isn't one of them. I can name other comparable nearby places that are far better (Craftsteak, Prime to name a few)

The service was good (not great) and the food was okay (not great). Come on people, this is a steakhouse in Caesar's Palace. Step it up. The bread basket had a nice variety of four different types of bread and came with salted butter. Sure, it's just a bread basket but it should have had more flavor and a higher quality of bread. I'm a carbaholic so the bread is kinda important to me.

The scallops were tasty and came with a nice sweet pea risotto. I appreciated that the risotto wasn't to saucy or creamy. This was probably the best dish of the meal. The Alaskan Halibut was nicely prepared, but was a skimpy portion of fish. One of my dining companions for the night could have had a second piece of halibut added to the plate for a more complete meal. We added sautéed spinach and asparagus. I prefer my asparagus to be slight (just slightly) more cooked. The spinach was ok. I probably should have just ordered it steamed instead of sautéed. The side veggie portions are shareable sizes. Lastly is the New York strip that was ordered off the bone. It's sad when you go to an expensive steakhouse and order a nice cut of meat just to find that it's mediocre. My dining companions were literally listing all the different places in Vegas and LA that had better steak (some weren't even steakhouses). 

In the end, unless you get your meal comped.... go somewhere else for a better piece of meat.",j7yDFhbyYf9JDJRdbCTHZg,12,8,3,WemW8gZJVMWVkVDTMH8XnA

The service was very good, not exceptional but good enough to not complain. The food was just okay. We were part of a 8 person party so between all of us we pretty much sampled the majority of the menu. 

I had the Calamari for my appetizer & for my steak I ordered the Rib Eye. The calamari was just way too much for an ""appetizer"" & not very flavorful. The steak...meh, I've had much better Rib Eye's from Mortons, to Ruth Chris & Maestro's here in CA. Even Delmonico's in the Venetian was just leaps & bounds better. It's not that the food was terrible or bad, it was okay but not on the same level nor on a level I'd expect from Caesars?? The food here was more like Mirage or Treasure Island etc. but not a premier hotel like Caesars or Bellagio or Venetian.

But I have to disagree with Yelp on this.

Our service was impeccable. From the bar where we started at until we walked up and left our dinner table. The executive chef even popped out and came to our table.

I love a good steak. No sissy steak either. I want a good ribeye or porterhouse. For me a good steak is a nice piece of meat with excellent marbling in it. This just means good flavor and that you are going to have a tender piece of meat. I know some may shoot for me this but I am not a ""fillet mignon"" type of person. However, on this occasion, I knew I was not going to be able to eat a huge steak. I went withe petite ""lady cut"" of fillet.

OMG. They converted me. It was a piece of butter. It ate so well and the flavor delicious. 

I added on a crab leg to my steak and it was just like seafood candy. So sweet and delicious.

We also ordered a seafood platter. Fresh & delicious raw oysters and clams. Sweet and succulent shrimp and crab. 

Sides of tater tots, mac and cheese, asparagus, broccoli and mushrooms. I would have passed on the broccoli - nothing special. But those tater tots and mushrooms. AMAZING.

The caviar was nice and salty and it came on an ice block  with many different garnishes and toast. The oysters weren't great but I haven't met an oyster I didn't like. The shrimp were gigantic and the sauces were out of this world. The lobster was sinful. You can tell they get their seafood from a reputable place. My lamb was the star of the show. I have never had a rack so juicy, I wanted to save it so I doggy bagged it and it was delicious even cold. I was speechless after the truffle whipped potatoes. TO DIE FOR! The cocktails were delicious, Key lime pie taste just like the name and the espresso martini was a great way to finish off a meal. They were like drinking dessert! I definitely couldn't eat like that often because the food is very rich but it was a special occasion. Our server, Rocky is just darling and he is timely and personable and the sommelier was awesome too. Both were very attentive. The restaurant, in my opinion, is medium sized but I wouldn't say the decor is anything you would fawn over. 

CONS: Although I had some hang ups, dining here was definitely worth 5 stars because the food was so good. I did not like how some of the seating is so exposed to the walkway to the patrons in the hotel. We sat in a booth and I felt a little like being under a microscope. I hated having to smell cigarette smoke while I ate as people often come in that area to smoke. It was nauseating. I also didn't like how I wasn't told how much the caviar was going to be. It had market price on it but if it's not part of the seafood tower, then they should explain that to you. It was good but if I had known it was $250, I wouldn't have ordered it because someone else was paying. I did notice that other people got birthday chocolate cake and I never got one and it was said to our waiter and to our hostess it was my birthday. BOO!! I chose this fancy place BECAUSE it was my birthday. I didn't have room for dessert but I would've loved a bite. Two people and our bill was over $700 with no dessert.

The lobster bisque soup totally made up for the cocktails.  It's a beautiful semi table side presentation. They give you a bowl of the shredded lobster and then pour the bisque into the bowls. It was rich and creamy and the lobster was great. By far the best lobster bisque I have ever tried. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese.
