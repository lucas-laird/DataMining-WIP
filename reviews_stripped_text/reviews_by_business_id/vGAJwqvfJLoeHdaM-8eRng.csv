Our waiter was Sean, our food was brought to us on a timely matter. Near the end of the night when Sean our waiter was doing his closing procedures he was not really interested on our table any longer. He was swiping and clean while we were still eating. Sean and an African american waitress were having a conversation next to our table. They were talking about how guest are an inconvenience to them at the end of the night. I feel like they were not really concerned about me over hearing it as they continue their conversation about wanting to get off before midnight. I don't think I even want to visit this location again, it was very uncomfortable not feeling welcome.",_zeDKS8zMEEvvpnW7MGQLg,3,1,1,fPzDWPTxHh5XcKFIFqArCw

So we waited for 10 minutes then another couple came in and took the table right away...  I asked what the deal was and they said open seating..this should have been the first red flag.  They have that poor hostess seating everyone taking names and cleaning tables, yes they have the hostess cleaning the damn tables talk about over worked. 

Eventually we sat down and the waitress who was also the bartender was very polite. I felt bad as the bar was full and so were all the booths and she seemed to be the one taking orders and drinks to everyone. This chilis is either on a skeleton crew for profits or they had a bunch of call outs. 

The food was...well McDonald's has higher quality fries. The burger was alright, cooked perfect but bread was terrible. Appetizer Texas fries..too much cheese and the fries were dry and somewhat tough.  

Overall I will never visit this location and probably never see the inside of another chilis with my wife again but not because of the crew. Get these ladies and gents some help, they did a great job but with the low quality food, there are numerous alternatives nearby that are similarly priced.",513_UGWFaYP5rPz9VA11Cw,1,0,2,jeeQj-4mYfVIBPhC7Tngow

Nothing, nada....we didn't exist.

We got up from our table and walked out of the restaurant without having ever been acknowledged by any of the Chili's staff.  I have seen other reviews here and almost figured why bother but this outing was highly disappointing and I hope that management sees what kind of workers
are under their employ that they have the ability to totally ignore their customers.  This was a disgrace.

Last visit I ordered fajitas and the vegetables were literally raw.  Crunchy, inedible raw.  I actually had to cook the peppers and onions before I could eat them.  I'm glad I did because while cooking them I noticed that there were tons of onion skins in the mix.  Gross.  Someone was being real lazy in the kitchen.  Because my kids love the place we tried again (sigh).  The place was a madhouse with people waiting 30-45 past their pick up times.  Half our food was sitting in a bag and half was not ready.  By the time we got all the food of course half the order was cold and the burgers we waited on were not pink inside, they were raw.  Mushy, undercooked raw barely browned on the outside.  We had to again cook these before we ate them and reheat half the other food.  We get takeout to avoid cooking for a night so this defeats the purpose of our relaxing evening.

Good service, the waitress was friendly and attentive, it took a little while though to get our food.

Place: 
No ambience , no personality almost depressing .

I ordered:
- the Grilled Steak, Pork Carnitas & Shrimp fajitas trio with rice and beans
( not bad not good just average)
- Corona beer
- strawberry lemonade cocktail ( too sweet)
- cinnamon skillet roll (not good , super dry tasted like dry bread )

I was of course expecting that from a chain, so no gourmet request or complaint here

One star because the food was good! The waiter was terrible! If a customer asks for more silverware because you only put 4 out for 7 people you don't ask if they are going to use it when eating the specific food that you order. Mind you the ""kits"" of silverware contained the straws. Then at the end of the meal as we finish paying he asks for us to fill out the survey and then hunched over my brother in law while he filled it out asking that on the question ""how likely would you return?"" We should put highly likely as our answer because it will effect his schedule. Then he not only asked us once but several times and when we got to the question he said ya that one right there put highly likely for me.

From their 20 dollar appetizer/2 entree/dessert deal to unlimited chips and salsa, their food choices are pretty good. Easy access off the 215. Minus 1 star because of one bad experience. It was just me and my wife for dinner one friday night. We were greeted right away and was seated. We were sat next to group of about 12 teenagers. Apparently our server was also the big group's server. By the time our server got to us about 15 minutes had gone by. She apologized to us for the delay. (which was appreciated). The thing that bothered me was that either our server knew the teenagers or she was gonna get a big tip from them. It seemed that for every 5 times she helped them, she would ask us if we were ok. Never mind what food we ordered or how it tasted, I was really thirsty that night and by the time I got my first refill, she was already bringing us the check. It just seemed like she didnt care if we were there or not. Now I could have easily given 2 or 1 star but since this was a server we never had, I am giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.

Located in North Decatur and off the 215, Chili's isn't so hard to find.  Its basically right in the open and a few places that you'll see first, once you get off the 215 and North of Decatur.  The place is very well kept in a decent setting as well as the inside.  Whenever we went, it wasn't as busy nor crowded but it looks like it does get a lot of business.  

But as far as the staff goes, some of them are nice, some of them seems to be a bit rude.  But I guess its just a matter of when you go and how busy it is.  There are times, when we sat down to eat that our waitress was on top of things.  That's what I like when it comes to good service.  But when I ordered from their To Go menu and went to pick it up.  There was some one behind the counter and I told her I'm here to pick up.  She went to the back and heard some guy yelling ""there's a sign there that says go see the bartender.""  I wasn't sure if he was yelling at me or the person who was behind the counter.  If they said it with out being rude or yelling it out, I would of understand.  Plus there was some one behind the counter as is, and thought it would of been easier to ask the person behind the counter.  Don't know why they have a place to pick up your ""to go"" orders, when they have a small sign, that says to go see the bartender in the restaurant.  If they have camera's in the ""to go"" room, and a window where the bartender can see you.  Obviously they can see that some one may be in there to pick up an order.  Otherwise, why have a ""to go"" room, if your going to direct me to the restaurant.  I think some of the staff can be a bit more polite and friendly.  Instead of yelling in the back saying there's a sign out there that says, go see the bartender, when there's some one already at the counter.

The reason why I do like this place, is for the food.  I like their steaks, their fajita trio, crispers, shrimp and the list goes on.  Their food is really good.  I like the fact that their margaritas come in a big cup.  Unfortunately can't get a margarita to go.  But like the fact that you get more to drink, than those fancy looking glassware.  

Overall, I would say its decent place to eat at.  If you go there to sit down and eat, you get one of the nice waiters/waitresses they have.  If you order ""to go"", unfortunately, my last visit wasn't really pleasant.

3319328,2015-01-18,2,vGAJwqvfJLoeHdaM-8eRng,"For a franchise/chain - I have expectations. Some higher than others. Thus, after an evening of checking out various Las Vegas venues, I realized I was hungry and just needed some casual grub. 

To me, I rate restaurants of this type in the following order: Applebee's, Chili's followed by TGI Friday's. 

This review is for this location only! I've eaten at many better Chili's locations. Ordered the Ribeye with steamed broccoli and a side salad. All of it was served at once. Also had a Long Island Iced Tea. 

1st, the long Island was yellow! Way too much sour. Tasted like a Walmart mix! For $9, it should have made me want a 2nd one. 

The salad was bland and right out of a bad. Creamy blue cheese - tasted like Ranch and was maybe enough dressing for half the salad. 

The steamed broccoli was steamed to perfection, but was totally flavorless! 

Now the protein. Holy cow patties! Ordered Medium Well, because the last few steaks I've had were way under-cooked. This one did not qualify as a steak. More qualified as Dog Food! Over 35% fat and gristle. One half of the steak was Rare-Medium rare, the other half was Medium rare. Find a new meat supplier - you all charged $18 for this specimen, I expected much more. 

Now my mindset.... I'd lost over $350 in the casino, just wanted a simple dinner. I seldom complain to management, because in this type of cookie cutter restaurant, more than one person failed to follow Chili's restaurant guide. The basics. 

Maybe I was reeling from sucking so bad at table games, but honestly - when even the drink tasted bad (by Vegas standards) - something is wrong. Kind of like the goofus server that kept sweeping with her little broom and flipping scooper-upper, right next to my feet, twice during the meal. 

I've said enough. A McDonald's experience would honestly have been better. Sometimes I'm a magnet for dung.  Ugh! Keep driving Yelpers.... This location sucked!",STaWQuqwUPQlNFevKD52PA,4,2,1,cATHaA5-O0QP5xlrx7xnnQ

The issue we have is with the food. After all that is why one goes out to eat- well and also to get good service. But food and the ability to not have to cook it is the reason we like to eat out. We have typically gone here on a busy Friday night and have had no issues with the service.

I ordered the all you can eat soup and salad. The salad had a tiny bit of cheese which was pitiful. Nor even enough to say there was cheese on the salad. My husband ordered the 10 oz steak and it was not cooked to his liking or order. Great job on keeping the drinks refilled and timeliness of the order.

I had to call about five times and the line was still busy/off the hook. This is what forced me to place my order online.  It said it would be ready in ten minutes after placing my order. Being that it was Valentine's Day, the lady checking me out apologized that it would be 10-15 minutes longer since they got behind on orders. I didn't mind and sat on the bench and waiting only about five more minutes till she called my name. 

The nice thing was that she opened each box up and repeated back my order. 

The worst part was the presentation, the quality, and the incomplete order. That is the one thing I absolutely despise is when you get home and your order is either wrong or incomplete.  I order a kids meal with pizza and French fries. There was no drink she forgot to give me my drink. I also ordered the smokehouse deal with BBQ ribs, sausage and two sides. EVERYTHING was in one small box piled on top of one another. I want French fries and toast toast not BBQ flavored fries and toast that has BBQ sauce on it. Lastly, I ordered my usual Cajun chicken pasta. Of course they forgot my piece of toast that comes with it and it was cold. I couldn't help but be upset and left disappointed with this meal/experience. 

I doubt I will go back to this Chili's. At least it'll be awhile until I go back and I won't ever order to go. I know and understand it gets busy but they need to be even more careful with their order and quality. Every plate should look and taste 110%.",hYmIm9L0MUT5afUqYQuX0A,2,0,1,YZOhLy62HMft6ZUqN-bshw

My husband waited for me so by the time I got my food his was cold. so then the waitress brings the check and goes oh did he come by? I'm like no no one came by. And she goes oh well he took the order off. Okay cool. I look at the check no they did not. They took off the chicken quesadilla order and did nothing to compensate messing up my order and taking forever to receive my food. Then we go to pay using their machine and it tried to add a 20% tip. Ummm no sorry I changed that to 0%. Sorry but she could of accommodated us more for her mistake.

I wanted to minimize how many people I got sick, so I opted to enter through their To-Go entrance. Plus, I'm getting my food to go. Makes perfect sense.  The problem with their To-Go area is that no one was there to take my order.  So, I sat and sat and sat.  While I waited, I could hear a bunch of their servers giggling from the kitchen.  I must have had my invisible cloak on today.  After about 5 minutes of zero service, which felt like an hour, I decided to make my presences known.  The best way to do this is enter their kitchen.  So, I did.  That immediately got the chatter to stop and my order taken.  Finally!!! 

Pretty sure they can tell I was irritated because the guy taking my order seemed to go above and beyond with great customer service. Good save Chili's  

I ended up getting the Enchilada Chicken Tortilla Soup and Sliders w/extra Onion Strings.  I know I originally came in for their chili, but remembered how good their Enchilada Tortilla Soup was.

First we ordered steaks, I ordered med rare and got a hockey puck that was so burnt! I was too hungry to return it after waiting sooooo long but it was horrible. 

Our server was good but what ruined our evening and made it so I never go back to chilis was the server next to us. A big guy with black glasses that was super miserable 

My bf ""hey sir what's the name of the fighter on the tv? I can't see""

Server ""it doesn't matter cuz the fights shouldn't be on"" he proceeds to then scream at the top of his lungs to the bartender. ""Turn the the fight off!!!! Turn that tv off!!""

Our jaws were both dropped. He was sooo rude! And he left for about 5 mins and then did it again and then ran behind the bar and turned off all the fights.  Ppl even boo him. 

Never in my life did I see something so rude. We even told them to pack our food up Togo to leave. Our server convinced us to stay but did a manager come by?! Nope

Today, as we are sitting at the bar, waiting for our food, I look up to see a server (Robert) who is asking other tables if they ordered fajitas (which were amazingly delicious by the way - Steak and Shrimp).  By the time I finished putting a chip in my mouth, I lifted my hand and told him, ""I think those are mine"", he then approached me and said, ""You couldn't have told me these were yours??""    So, first of all - it's not my job to know what the server has in his hand, second, it's not my job to keep track of the server or my order, and let him know where Im sitting.  I have never had this issue before.  I have always had great service.  Im also a person that can take a joke and am aware enough to know when someone is joking, but he was pretty irritated.  Then to top things off, apparently the bartender, Dani, called him over to go over a procedure with him, and his comment back to her was, ""you called me over here to tell me that?""  That was enough to solidify that he speaks this way and it's his personality.  

This won't stop me from going to Chili's because I've been a customer for so long and love most of the staff - Dani and Sheena specifically, but this could effect new customers and does leave a bad overall experience for the customer.",gpu2gvCUms7G_8lUFS7fYQ,2,1,2,-5oDrFXyjUlzQCYkaXcfeA
4428636,2015-06-15,1,vGAJwqvfJLoeHdaM-8eRng,"Definitely a spot to cool down from this Vegas heat.

I have only been to Chili's a handful amount of times, and this is probably the reason why. Service was always slacking whether it was to ask a question or just receive a simple refill. Our waiter/waitress did not hesitate to happily pass us back and forth. 

They offer a little touchscreen/tablet for ordering and playing games which is very convenient, especially when you are with kids who cannot seem to calm their loud mouths down.

Must admit, there is not many places where you can have a nice sit down dinner for two and pay around $20. Although, some of the plates do come well underdressed unlike the pictures on the menu and are never really filling either. A quesadilla that I ordered came out looking like a kids meal, and had a salad on a different day which both had that pre grilled/diced frozen chicken. On top of that, make sure you occupy yourself for a about an hour while they take their time catching and prepping our meals.

Overrated from my personal view. Do not expect much high quality of anything here besides the cold refreshing A/C. I'll stick more with the apples and the bees:)",A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg,3,1,3,ouWvUGGHQAuzwneTNvNxzQ

I'm guessing the reason for the low ratings are actually a result of this Chillis location not paying their Yelp bill.
Yelp bill you may ask? Yes. Pay your membership fee or have your good and great reviews marked as spam and not shown.

    Chili's is a chillin casual dining chain that serves a variety of food and drinks ranging from steak to what else but chili. On June 24, I ordered the California Turkey Club with French Fries and bottomless Coke whereas on September 11, I ordered the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger with French Fries and a bottomless Coke. Both meals after tax added up to approximately $20. I was satisfied with both sandwiches. The picture of the California turkey club shows an abundance of turkey meat topped with tomatoes and cheese between two slices of toasted bread next to a bowl of French Fries. This sandwich hit the spot after hiking up in Mount Charleston. As far as the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger, there was nothing ultimate about it. There were no ""Wow!"" moments that I enjoyed in numerous Las Vegas restaurants that include Fire Rock and Bachi Burger. This is a good cheeseburger topped off with Applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, red onions, jalapeño, spicy buffalo sauce, pickles, lettuce, and honey chipotle sauce. 

  The first night we went to Chili's it was busy where on a Sunday during an NFL game it was relatively quiet. Both times, the hostess walked us to the same small booth overlooking the TV near the bar. Throughout both meals the service was good. The waitress would volunteer to bring new glasses of Coke to the table. Both times the waitress was polite and never rushed us. Chili's has merged real life service with the virtual world. Every table features a digital tablet where customers can order drinks plus pay the bill. When it turned into the time where what a few minutes ago were sandwiches and French Fries were now crumbs, the Waitress directed us to pay through the digital tablet. I am not a fan of a restaurant directing the customer to have to pay electronically. Credit cards and debit cards are convenient, however, so is paper money. What if the customer doesn't have a credit card? Both times, the waitress never elucidated if option B is paying by cash. Technology is nice as an option but not to be forced down the customers throat. The only thing I want forced down my throat on Chili's is either a California Turkey Club or Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger. 

   In conclusion I am of the opinion that Chili's is a chillin casual dining chain restaurant. Both times that I dined in this location during the summer I left satisfied and full.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,10,3,IGSXM2-jhQbTaLnJFnrayA

He started off by not knowing menu. Then about the order. No checking on us when the ordering was taking forever. BUT.....when the food DID come there was no soup.....which I did say in the first place that we would like our soups 1st. The worst thing about it was that we didn't get our soups, at all. He told us the reason we didn't get them was because they were out of soups and then later, they were defrosting!!! 30 minutes later, after we get our food????????? I'm a server for over 25 years now. I started out in a mom and pop in Chicago and now YEARS later in banquets......So seriously his BS only pissed me off more!! I didn't even tried to hear it. I request ( from the hostess to get me) another server right away. A nice server came over and I told I was curious on the soups for the day and he said what they were and I asked how long it would take to get one if I ordered one at a table right now. He looked at me as the question was weird (which I get. it was odd) after telling him that I felt as though another server was giving me a lie about the soups, he told me that he would send over the manager to me. I was greeted by the manager at my table after about 5 minutes. He was extremely nice and I told him my concerns about the experience I was having with this server. He tried to back the server and his horrible excuses, but then after I added that he never came back to my table and told me that the soup wasn't available or defrosted and never got my fries at all, changed the managers responds.

Ordered:
2 for $35
Chips and guacamole
2 Mango margaritas 10/10
Original iron steak 9/10, could have been a little bloodier
Pork/ch fajitas 10/10
The chocolate cake with icecream. 10/10

I believe Ashlee was our waitress, if not sorry. She was great. The margarita recommendation was awesome. The guacamole was fresh, and the chips just fried. Splitting the pork and chicken for my wives fajita was her suggestion. (she couldn't make her mind up). The steak was flavored just right. 

The new touch system tablet at the table is a great convenience. You can reorder, play unlimited games for a $1, get drinks and dessert, and close out your bill on it.

Ambience is great and the restaurant side, clean. On the bar side, has TVs with sports for a cool hang out.

The servers and staff were kind and doing their jobs... but the food was completely awful.  We got the guacamole burger. steak fajitas and my kid got the mac and cheese.  It was as if they went to smiths and purchased a bunch of canned and packaged processed food and stuck it in the microwave.   The steak was burnt like charcoal and has zero taste other than char.  The bell peppers were in giant undercooked hard chunks.  The onions were in big inch thick chunks.  It was as if it was cut by a 5 year old.  There was no seasoning on anything.  All the food had no taste.  The cheese was bagged crap cheese with anti caking agents and the beans tasted like wet aluminum.  The tortillas were like the bread like junky ones you get at a grocery store.  The salsa was so bland I would have rather had tostitos to be honest.     And now to the burger... all the salt that was earmarked for our entire table was put on her burger.... How can you even mess up a burger..??  A child could make a better burger....  My kids mac and cheese was supposed to be kraft... and it was... except it was pretty much the sticky microwaved 3 days later version and had zero cheese taste.  His oranges were the same exact del monte kind you get for a dollar at walmart.  Why is this place always so busy?  How can people pay 17 dollars to eat canned and low quality processed junk food?  The only thing decent was the chips...after i put salt on them.. why did i even eat here?   Take the same money and go to macaroni grill or something...   2 stars simply because the service was good.,ikZ9AGM-hDXGz9fw4XhtDA,0,0,2,WCvEvL5pioSe6c6C4sivCQ

Quite possibly, it's the worst dining experience I've ever had. From the wait staff being extremely rude, no silverware or napkins. Waited 45 minutes to have the server say she could only bring my wife and my son's food because mine wasn't done yet and they couldn't bring them all together because the warming area in  the kitchen was broken. My son's broccoli was ice cold as well as  the french fries. My wife said her food was okay but she's not one to complain. I finally got my burger which took 55 minutes  to receive. It was okay it was a little cool, fries were cold. Complained to the manager and the manager's response was "" I'm not the manager here I'm only filling in and I know our kitchen is having  major issues tonight "". The manager did take off about half the bill which in my opinion should have been the entire bill. He also gave us $10 in coupons to come back which I never will step foot in that restaurant again. The last time I went to that Chili's was approximately 6 years ago, had a very bad experience six years ago I promised I would never go back and did, and this is what happened. Would give it a zero-star but the system will not allow me to do that.  This restaurant is a complete joke. Strongly advise to stay far away from it.

I went to eat at 12pm today for lunch with some coworkers. We actually frequent this restaurant. We were greeted by the hostess and immediately sat. However, we waited well over 15 mins for our server to greet us. Only by request did she make her initial appearance.

When she finally came over, she was short, curt, and her demeanor stated she hated her job. No apology by her or a manager was offered for her late arrival. She ordered our food and brought it out promptly, but no check back to see if ""things were ok."" She dropped the checks and snatched them from my hand as I paid. Perhaps because I was so irritated that this may be an exaggeration but I'll stick with that.

Overall, for me, the food is the ""finisher"" on my ""great experience"" at any restaurant. The server is the one that MAKES IT. For me, Tara was an absolute nightmare. Maybe she had a bad day, maybe there are issues going on, or maybe she just sucks. Regardless, she ruined our experience and if I had time to speak to a manager I would have but we were already running late to return for work.

I keep coming back though, because my husband really likes Chili's. *sigh* The Chili's located off the Decatur and 215 is our most frequented Chili's seeing that it's closest to home. I'm a fan of the improvements Chili's has been making - they've really been stepping up their game. The restaurant here has been remodeled and looks more trendy, the presentation of the food has also been upgraded, a rewards system has been introduced, and a tablet at each table allows diners to order drinks and desserts and even pay their check. Chili's used to email coupons out like crazy but has ceased the coupon disbursement ever since the rewards system was launched. :( 

I pretty much get the same thing every time I come to Chili's. You guessed it, it's the black bean vegetarian burger! I get the Guacamole burger and customize the hell out of it, i. e., annoy the shit of our waitress. The fries are always awesome at Chili's. Dessert is meh.

Service is mostly good here and we always eat in the bar area at a booth.

PRO TIP: Come on Sundays for all day Happy Hour and eat in the bar to get FREE chips and salsa! 

Worth a Return Visit?
It's inevitable. My guy loves Chili's.

When we arrived inside the establishment wasn't busy at all and the hostess was no where to be found.

We had plenty of time before our waitress arrived to look over the entire menu and we knew what we were going to order once she arrived because we sat for almost ten minutes before she did arrived. When she arrived she was actually a great waitress and we were very impressed with her. 

When she brought out the food my salad looked great but as I took a few bites in, the damn lettuce was old and slimy. Really freaking gross.  They took the salad off the bill thank god.  The salad also had a small quesadilla which was cold, I'm not sure if it's suppose to be cold or not but really who likes old cold melted cheese?? Not this girl??? But I never did ask because the salad was Awful.  

My sons chicken bites were hot and fresh but were covered in tons of breading. I'm sure this comes frozen and premade so I suppose that this isnt the restaurants fault.

Overall, this is a very convenient, clean, and friendly location!",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,3,0,3,xcr9ppxcQRrzKXphh_urKQ

(yayyyyyy) only the bar area was open & that was right up our alleys.. the bartender/server seemed like he hated his job & wasn't friendly at all.. seemed like anything we asked for irritated him.. the 3 stars are for the margaritas & food.. Texas cheese fries were made to perfection & came out pretty quickly.. I'd return but ask
for a different server if i sat in the bar again.",aLttBVQXDtaUzawaR0mTig,0,0,3,V0NPyxw2uwF5shcEQRewSw

From my experience, some of the locations have decent service and some have very poor service. Many of the locations that have poor service staff their restaurant with ""hot chicks"" who have bad attitudes, but their good looks seem to keep the customers coming. I have been to some locations where I had to wait 10 minutes for a host to even put my name on the list, and I have also been to some locations where I never saw my server one time after she took our orders. So, I was not expecting much when I came to this Chili's near Aliante Station. I've lived in Vegas long enough to know that even the 5-star restaurants have bad service due to 1/2 the people here being jaded and sick of being alive. Well, I was very shocked to see how great the service was here. The host, and servers had very good social skills, were very friendly, and had great work ethics. I don't think I had one problem here at all. 
Of course I left a giant tip.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,1,1,5,S2qXr4tP5suIwk1WEmuxUw
