When u got to the store they didn't greet me or  knowledge that I was standing at the front counter when I finally asked if I could place an order someone walked over to the front he was incredibly rude he didn't even make eye contact with me. I ordered two different type of sushi I then asked him if he thought the ones that I ordered were good he said they were okay.  I then asked him if he had any recommendations and he said that the   Crunch roll was good which was when I was that I had ordered. He wasn't really paying attention to what I had ordered and he had already written my order down wrong and he just seemed annoyed that that we were even buying food which was kind of strange.

2535584,2011-07-13,14,q_CpNXiPQbd6Iq0bnldhng,"WHERE: Located in the plaza on Charleston & Sloan.

WHEN: 10am-930pm, I believe.

WHY: If you happened to just recently move around this side of town, and are desperately in need of some quick and great tasting Hawaiian food, look no further!

WHAT: I had got off from work and straight home to some hungry brothers of mine! We debated on what type of food to eat, and came to conclude we were all craving some good old Hawaiian food! I would usually drive that 5 minutes to Island Flavor, but the 5 minutes actually became 35 minutes from our new place! Boohooo!!! =(

I then decided to search on Yelp, and I was lucky enough to spot this SPOT. Muahaha!!

First thing's first. We step in to order. My brother and I both get the chicken combo, while my other brother gets the local plate. (Most plates are 8 bucks and well-worth the 8 bucks!!) While we are waiting for our food, the server brings us a bowl of MISO SOUP!!! C'mon, who has ever had a side of miso at a hawaiian joint!! I say BOMB.COM!!! That right there = SOLD! Haha.

After a minute or so, we got our actual combo plates. Fast service, I may add! I loved the chicken katsu, but my bbq chicken was on the bland side.  I could suggest adding a little bit more seasoning or even bbq sauce would have done the trick! Besides my bbq chicken, everything was splendid! I will definitely come back on those chicken katsu crave days!",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,16,15,4,_7fckVOUHfbG9ZWSfTpIpg

I have to admit it's located way out in the right field of Las Vegas, and take some time to get too, but if your craving some Hawaii style plates in the area, it might not be bad thing check them out,   It's pretty well hidden in a Albertson shopping center at the foothill of Sunrise mountain, and has a menu similar to Yummy Sushi.

The place is fairly small, but it has a pretty good take out customer traffic; so getting a table wasn't a problem, but to figure out what to eat was the difficult, because of too many choices.     I ended up with a combo teri beef, and Garlic Chicken.

They took about ten minute to set up the plate, and my teri beef was okay....nothing to write home about, but the Chicken was kind of a stolen recipe of L & L (the ones in Hawaii) garlic chicken...it was good!   but the Mac salad sucked a#s, and they need to work on that big time.

Would I make a special trip to visit them again?  NO, but if I'm near the area, and staving,  I might get the chicken, but without the salad.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,3,2,3,XzlGYvZhMVHoaAiEStRQyw
2906750,2012-01-15,0,q_CpNXiPQbd6Iq0bnldhng,"Their store sign says ""Hawaiian BBQ"" and not Aloha A GoGo, but it's next door to the China A GoGo, so we figured we found the right place.

Hubby had the Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate and I had the Chicken Combo. We shared the Unagi Roll sushi.

First the good news:  My plate consisted of the chicken katsu and BBQ chicken, which came with a side of katsu sauce, 2 scoops of rice and a side of macaroni salad. Both chicken types were good and I had no complaints, but the rice was on the dry, ""al dente"" side and the macaroni salad left a bit to be desired. I've tasted better macaroni salad before and even L & L serves up better macaroni salad.

The unagi sushi was great! Very smooth and delicious and the avocado inside the sushi was perfect and flavorful! The sushi was filled with crab meat, avocado, and cucumber with eel on top of it, drizzled with eel sauce. Very nice!

Now the bad news:  Hubby was not so fortunate with his choice, which was the Hawaiian BBQ mix plate consisting of BBQ short ribs, BBQ beef, and BBQ chicken. The beef and short ribs were tough and chewy, in spite of the BBQ beef being very thinly sliced. Short ribs are normally tender, but not this one and he said its flavor was mild to almost nothing. The meat was served with a side of sauce, though, so that helped somewhat. Same story as mine for the rice and macaroni salad on his plate.

We thought the best part of the meal was the eel sushi and we'll definitely go back again to try other types of sushi and also their malasadas. I have to say that their sushi is reasonably priced. California Roll is $3.95 and the unagi sushi we ordered was $5.95. Very affordable.

They have a wide assortment of food choices on their menu such as burgers, saimin, musubi, and haupia (coconut pudding dessert) and they offer catering service and delivery service within 3 miles. We'll be back!",jIH2fzQfXY7RW3C3W1Z1iQ,2,0,3,EHO-raEAhWKsxl7Yqty6uw
3114610,2016-12-30,0,q_CpNXiPQbd6Iq0bnldhng,"Aloha A Go Go used to be known as just serving Hawaiian based food with side sushi rolls. But ever since they've combined their restaurant with China A Go Go and became one establishment, they've added the name Sushi House. So if you order take out, you might be directed to either side when you pick it up. They do delivery as well and are usually on time. Never had a problem with that.

Their main menu looks completely different, as it only looks like they serve sushi, but you can still order all the same Hawaiian food items from before. They've even kept their old menu taped on their window!

They offer All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi for both lunch and dinner. I personally haven't done AYCE here, but I've ordered to go countless of times. I've tried almost all of the sushi on the menu and it always turns out yummy and fresh. Prices seem to be in the same range as other AYCE restaurants as well.

It's not my go-to sushi place, but it's a great joint when you're craving for something quick and you're in the area. Plus it's far from where I live and I wouldn't travel all this way for this restaurant compared to other authentic Japanese sushi houses.

Staff is not very personable when it comes to customer service, which may come off as being unfriendly to some. But it doesn't really bother me since I only get food to go when I'm in the area visiting friends.

It's a great place to try when you're not looking for formality in an eatery and when you just need to feed your tummy with good food. lol

3119475,2011-04-08,0,q_CpNXiPQbd6Iq0bnldhng,"I'm pretty sure this is connected to the China A Go Go business that's two store down from it and much like that place, I'm very satisfied with this place. Much like China A Go Go, they cook you fresh food and it's quick. This place has the typical Hawaiian BBQ menu with enters such as macaroni salad, chick katsu, bbq, chicken, mahi mahi, fried shrimp and so on but half of it's menu consist of Japanese dishes. There's about 12 different sushi rolls, tempura a couple of bowl dishes and musubi.Good stuff all the way.

As with any Hawaiian BBQ restaurant, I always judge it by it's chicken katsu and this place is my top spot. I last ordered a katsu/bbq chicken combo and I prefer their version of both compared to the more popular L&L. 

As for the venue itself, it's all clean, less than two years old I think. Last I remember, this place used to be a Sandwich Masters and compared to that place, it's a completely different store. Fairly small, only about 9 tables I think but I've never seen that place busy. Usually people just order and pick up there. You seat yourself there so it's more of the fast food type of deal than a sit down place. 

They seemed to be stressing about not being able to get deliveries out though so either eat there or do a pick up. If you're in the mood for some Hawaiian or Japanese food, I definitely recommend this place.",JhVMhYNceJUt369RODruDg,1,0,5,1jLl--zUdyj_7U2YyWC_lg

The staff greater me as I came in and told me approximately how long the food would take to cook since I had to go back outside to attend to my dog (who came along for the ride.) So overall I would say the staff was really nice.

On to the important stuff.... The food!!! The Hawaiian BBQ beef that my friend had was really good, but my manapua left a lot to be desired. It dry and lacked the great Hawaiian flavor I was anticipating. If I came back here I would probably stick to one of the BBQ plates. Oh one other thing that kinda annoyed me was they still had skewers on the menu even though they no longer offer them.

3675242,2010-08-18,0,q_CpNXiPQbd6Iq0bnldhng,"I decided to stop into this restaurant today because 1. I just came from the gym and I was pretty hungry and 2. I'm Hawaiian and I'm pretty fond of Hawaiian food.  Checked out the menu and saw that there weren't many options for the vegetarians out there :(  But, it is Hawaiian food (aka rice and meat central) and I knowingly took the risk.  Lucky for me I am a pescetarian so I divulged on the Mahi Burger.  Being used to the Vegas version of the ""L&L"" mahi I was actually expecting something subpar and didn't expect the sandwich to be actually pretty dang good!  The fish was fresh and that's all you can really ask for in a mahimahi burger.  They also let me substitute my fries with kim chee and I must say - the kim chee here is SO good!  I'm not really into the saucy kim chees out there and their kim chee hit the spot.  My fiancee had the ""Local Plate"" which consisted of BBQ beef and chicken, two scoops of rice, a scoop of mac salad AND two musubis for 8.50!  What a deal!  She barely finished it because there was so much food to try and digest.  I did try some her mac salad to compare to the mac salad from back at home but it didn't compare so I passed on eating more of it.

Overall, I thought the food here was actually pretty grubbin'.  Four stars for the lack of veggie stuffs but thumbs up to making a killer mahi sammich.  Would I visit here again?  Pretty sure I will.  Right down the street from my house so why not?  Nice to eat some Hawaiian food other than the L&L and Aloha Kitchen usual I frequent.

You can order your meals either mini (1 scoop of rice and mac salad) or regular (2 scoops of rice and mac salad).  They also have sushi rolls available!  My go to rolls are the Las Vegas and Lisa roll.  And you can get a side of kimchi for $1.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,6,4,4,RPA8I2T8bPHUCF5wEYH2KQ
4535727,2018-06-02,0,q_CpNXiPQbd6Iq0bnldhng,Me and my friend came here for a Hawaiian food hunt but got AYCE sushi once we saw it on the menu. It's pretty cool they let you order half rolls to be able to try a little of everything. Sushi was fresh and thick which is always good. Will come back again for the chicken Katsu,XH7SzPhiB-Zatxed58Uu8g,0,0,4,lNeqJE1rA8P0ZBbnLfAMFQ

Food was very good..katsu sauce not the run of the mill fruit sauce they give you at L&L or ohana bbq. More of ikari or bulldog sauce. Plus if you want some chinese or japanese or vice versa..u can order whatever you want..another plus is the AYCE sushi",AJcici429Ou2jGtI2xeesw,0,0,5,UoS0OtFB-5Yxr0YuaQ9aKw
