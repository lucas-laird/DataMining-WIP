It may taste similar to El Pastorcito, but it seems like meat quality is not as good as the original one. Even if I have to drive a little more, it is going to be totally worthy.",7ZRTfpv63rmDUE_PrgJgWg,0,0,2,nUa9KTgnAE35OgdC_NX2Vg

The burritos are packed with meat and the quesadillas are amazing. Don't forget to hit the salsa bar because they don't pack your takeout order with any (found out the hard way on my first visit!), but everything is super fresh. Their asada and lengua are my preferred meats but the al pastor is bomb, too.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,19,4,oVLk6oFbRS7SaYKq4rh46Q

So much stuff and prize is not over exaggerated it's affordable and delicious! My personal favorite is the asada and al pastor! Big difference between this spot compared to other taco trucks is there meat Quality! And the way it's marinated and cooked on the spot is amazing can't get any fresher than that! My personal opinion I think the food is way better when it's on the spot! Make sure to make a stop when you get a chance! You won't regret it!",-dbnVIb5xorHTdiRhqKBXA,0,0,5,Qdx9ExpddLudBq28rAl9ug
