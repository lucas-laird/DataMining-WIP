68956,2017-08-24,0,lZvr_VDNWjCN_PT67StkKQ,"I received a Groupon as a gift from my husband to go to this salon for a mani pedi. I called ahead to make my appointment and also made sure they knew I would be getting a full set and would pay the difference. When I called I was told that would be fine. When I arrived I was told they couldn't do the full set with the Groupon and that I could either get a full set or a mani pedi because they didn't book enough time for me to do both. Not once was I even asked if I'd like to reschedule. I  had wanted to scope this place out in hopes of finding somewhere new and amazing to go and I was terribly disappointed. On top of that they redeemed my Groupon even though they did not provide any service for me and refused to unredeem it. We discovered that it had been redeemed when my husband called to speak to a manager and was transferred to Jillian. After all of this, Destiny responded to my review stating that ""I should speak to a manager over the miscommunication instead of leaving a negative review and not giving the salon a chance to fix the issue."" When I called again to speak to the now real manager I was still met by someone who was completely disrespectful. While we were on the phone with her she discovered that her staff member Jillian had posed as a manager therefore making her response to my review completely rude and inaccurate. Instead of trying to truly rectify the entire situation she continued to be patronizing. Later I was told that the owner would be contacted and would call me. When I called back again I was told that all Managers had left and no one would contact me until the next day. All I want is my money back and they refuse to unredeem my Groupon.",IOhL9XHI91hk1Y4KTiRX2w,0,0,1,KgajYViIrWVQ_5tib_MSJQ

I purchased a Groupon for ""One Full Set of Classic Signature Eyelash Extensions With Two-week Fill"" and, based upon the information in the Groupon confirmation of purchase, I phoned the salon to book the appointment. This was my first ever visit to The Salon, and I was booked with Jocelyn. 
When Jocelyn greeted me and escorted me to her room, she began showing me a sheet of paper with more expensive pricing. I said ""I have a Groupon"" and she said the Groupon is only for ""50% thickness"" of the lash-fills she was showing me on the paper. 
50%??!!  I explained the Groupon said One Full Set. She firmly said it's only a basic, 50% thickness, and to get a fuller set, I'd have to purchase the more expensive service. When I began to question this, she then blamed me for not knowing better, saying I should have asked about the thickness when I booked. I said how could I have known to have asked..I had informed the receptionist when I booked the appointment that I had purchased a Groupon; no one said anything to me about it being only 50%.. She got snotty and said, ""...most people ask...."" I insisted, ""...How was I supposed to know to ask?"" She kept insisting and repeating, ""...most people ask....""

303191,2011-10-26,0,lZvr_VDNWjCN_PT67StkKQ,"I recently used the Salon at Lakeside when we were married at the Lakeside Gardens a few weeks ago.  The wedding coordinator recommended the salon and this being a destination wedding for us, I was delighted with the convenience of having the stylist come to our hotel the morning of the wedding to do my hair and makeup.

I did not have the leisure of doing a pre-consultation which I would recommend to every bride.  It is very difficult to convey the look you are hoping to achieve to your stylist the day of your wedding. I had various photos I had shown Evelyn and somehow my desire did not translate well.

Evelyn Howard provides the bridal services at the Salon at Lakeside.  She is your only contact before and day of the wedding.  We arrived in Las Vegas on Sunday and our wedding was to take place on Tuesday.  I was to call Evelyn on Monday, per our earlier conversation with our room number at the hotel.  Unbeknownst to me, Evelyn was off on Monday.  She was to arrive at our hotel at 7:00 AM to help me prepare for an 11:00 AM wedding at the Lakeside Gardens.  I was a pretty calm bride up until the time I tried to reach Evelyn.  No one at the Salon would deal with bridal services and would only send you to her voicemail.  Luckily for me, she did send me an email late in the day on Monday to confirm that she received my hotel room information and that she would arrive as scheduled.  Whew!

She did arrive on time and was quick to set up.  She did not rush through the process, that much I will say.  However, somehow the hairstyle I wanted did not exactly turn out the way I had described it to her.  I was very unhappy with her makeup application skills.  She provided airbrused makeup and we were going for a natural look but the eye makeup really was not up to par.  Unfortunately for me, I did not have time to redo it or correct it.  Evelyn certainly has ideas of her own on what bridal day hair and makeup should look like and she does not quite comprehend what you are telling her.

I feel that for the $225 I paid for this service not including tip, I should have been more satisfied with the end result.

So, word to the wise.  Do see if you can secure the services of the salon located in your hotel.  Most Las Vegas hotels do provide this service and I am certain the fees will be much lower.  Further, you may even be able to schedule a quick pre-consultation after you check in.  See if you can coordinate this soon after you book your room.  The Salon at Lakeside was not up to par with regard to their bridal services and certainly not worth the convenience in my honest opinion.",GJVGskGCwimmN_FRMPpDtw,3,0,2,nR_0Z-r12KTmhTGvhXHn3w

411777,2011-12-04,0,lZvr_VDNWjCN_PT67StkKQ,"Tammy Lord is maybe the #1 most amazing hairdresser ever and I am hating myself as I write this review since everyone is going to want to go to her after (and I will never get in to see her) but still, she needs to props she deserves!!! I don't really know how she hasn't been reviewed yet by anyone else but I guess I will be the first. Tammy has taken my hair from major BLEH to people think my hair looks amazing 6 months+ after its been done by Tammy. Perfect color, perfect cuts EVERY TIME. I guess what spurned this review after so long(I've been her client for a few years) is that I just had my hair done here in San Diego by someone else and I almost cried when he took the towel off my head. The color was NOT right. He used the bleach for the highlights but totally effed up my low-lights (Tammy, if you are reading this, I'm coming in in January...I need you). They do not match my hair AT ALL. My sister and mom go to Tammy as well. They came down to see me for Thanksgiving last week, took one look at my hair and said...why is it orange? You need to go see Tammy ASAP. To top it off, he cut these randoms bits of my hair different odd lengths ""to make it healthy"" so my hair looks all choppy and short in some places and long in others. It's just awful. And if you've seen my profile pic, you'll see my hair and see how beautiful it is thanks only to Tammy (pic was taken in February, 2 months after she did it). So it's true folks. Tammy is a miracle worker. She's fixed my hair before when its been botched by these people here in SD and I'm sure this won't be the last time she'll have to do it. She's also incredibly smart and interesting and will always make you feel better about yourself after sitting in her chair for a few hours. It's like a therapy session + hair therapy session...aka what could be better? And don't even let me forget her head massages...OMG.

The place was beautiful and was greeted by the receptionist and London even got turned around lol. London was fast but efficient and took her time making sure everything was perfect. The technique she used was different and I liked it with a sew in on a net most people don't oil your scalp and she did I LOVED that! The braids weren't super tight and uncomfortable and she braided quickly. I've been to a lot of hair stylist and one thing I hate is one who texted on the phone and take phone calls and let me tell you she DID NOT do that! That is a super plus in my book  the price was good for the services I got which was a full sew in with highlights cut and styled.,8IES5wLpFWiRUQHJ-LcpMw,1,0,5,_bP7oVbugjOGTTAny5GJyg

712134,2013-08-29,0,lZvr_VDNWjCN_PT67StkKQ,"Being in the service industry myself, I have been vehemently against Groupon from the start. However, I needed a haircut so badly, funds were limited, and i had not found a new stylist since moving back to vegas. So I swallowed my shame, called The Salon and asked a few questions. The receptionist was very sweet and professional, and just my luck, there was an opening that day (which was a Monday).

I arrived 20 mins early, as I wanted a chance to look through a book or magazine. My stylist was hanging around the front desk already, so she took me early.

I showed her a very simple style that I liked, straight with piece-y layers at the bottom, a bit longer than shoulder length. She studied the picture closely several times, chatting away as she began what would turn into a 1.5 hour haircut. She had no idea how to layer my hair, she kept doing these short, choppy little snips at the bottom, cutting my hair into a straight line all the way across. she didn't even touch the rest of my hair, leaving me with this awful cut that in no way resembled the photo or any other style I've ever seen or had. I can't style this. I can't do anything with it. I had to correct her several times because she'd cut one side and forget to do the same thing on the other, then when I pointed out that it was completely uneven, she laughed it off and said that it was the lighting.With plenty of product she managed to give my hair enough body to appear different than it was when I walked in... by the time I got home, the product had worn off and I was in tears as I realized how terrible I looked. I've never had my hair look this awful.

I made an even worse mistake by letting her do my eyebrow/lip wax. she bragged on and on about how much she loved waxing, and since I was headed to Nail Country after, I decided to save the trip, since the haircut had taken so long. It was IMMEDIATELY obvious that she had never waxed anything in her life. She had no idea how to pull my skin tight, and actually needed ME to do it for her. She definitely didn't shape or even finish the brows and did the middle off-center, taking too much off one side. She also insisted on showing me the wax strips after pulling them, I have no idea why. She couldn't even wax my lip right! She told me to hold my lip tight against my upper teeth, which you NEVER do, then used about 5 strips to sloppily wax the center. She left wax all over my face. When I looked in the mirror I couldn't believe it, and immediately pointed out how crooked my eyebrows were. Again, she blamed the lighting! She had taken at least 20-30 minutes on the waxing, I wasn't about to let her continue. I paid, tipped 15% on what the full service (before groupon) should have costed, and FLEW to Nail Country. They cleaned the old wax off, finished my brows, redid my lip, and couldn't believe I'd just paid $10 MORE than I'd ever paid anywhere for such terrible waxing.

I did call and speak with the manager a few days later, who wasted no time telling me that they have a huge sign in the lobby explaining their No Money Back policy. They must have plenty of complaints if they had to have a sign printed! I told her I didn't want my money back, I just wanted my hair fixed and that stylist educated before she be allowed to go near another client again. Turns out that my two days off (Sunday and Monday) made having my hair fixed and finished impossible... they are closed Sunday and the manager is off Monday. So I was out about $100 after the awful haircut, incompetent wax, tip, then a 2nd wax done elsewhere and HER tip. 

I had to save up for that session, and it was a terrible experience. I still had all the same dead ends, limp hair, and zero style... it was just shorter. I will NEVER go back.",_-WPE5HRKQQ0qsGFxnYuFA,11,0,1,R3NI1aEJxNCaMe4_8pMbWA

I also noticed I couldn't comb thru my lashes with the spoolie brush because everything was just stuck together!

i bet half of the ""good"" comments were paid for because she seemed like she learned how to to eyelash extensions off of youtube the night before. 
and i would maybe understand if she had bad reviews but she was excellent at doing eyelashes but she isn't! she sucked and i don't know how they keep her in that salon. 
please listen to the reviews and don't go here. maybe if they hire another eyelash tech, they would have better reviews. but jocelyn is horrible. did nothing right, needs to learn proper manners and needs to find a new job cause she can't do hers right.",3JL1GQp1Ez9sMBtMXRofGw,4,0,1,-xeQF5i8N7pSxYvTTPjvBQ

1935210,2017-10-08,0,lZvr_VDNWjCN_PT67StkKQ,"NICE SALON, BAD EXPERIENCE. I tried eyelash extensions for the first time through someone who did it privately. I got my lashes done from someone who was new to the business and wanted to find someone with more experience. I found Jocelyn on Groupon to try out. Before going in I had the eyelashes removed. There was miscommunication with my appointment time. I knew I was going to be a few minutes late so I called in and the receptionist told me they would still take me. However, the appointment time they had scheduled me for was earlier than what I had scheduled. It was too late to take me without going into the next appointment time. It was upsetting because I already had taken my previous lashes off and eyelash extensions were something I needed that week as I was experiencing a personal trial and the lashes saved me the time and stress of runny mascara. I was clearly upset but Jocelyn did a good job of offering comfort  and showing me the eyelash room where the eyelashes would be done at a different time. 

Although I was upset, I liked the way Jocelyn handled things and re-scheduled the lash appointment. When I returned, the customer service given to me was both humiliating and disappointing. Right as I walked in I was greeted with confusion. Jocelyn hovered down to the receptionist to say "" Oh this is the girl that was here before."" I immediately felt uncomfortable with their damenors towards me. Once in the appointment she complained about how my eyes were fluttering due to coffee (I walked in with a protein shake) and the lashes wouldn't work. She said I should have known not to drink that because my eyes needed to relax. I could tell she was frustrated with her voice. She brought up multiple times about how I had my lashes done somewhere else and the Groupon was only for new clients to try out lashes so the lashes would be very basic. She told me how if I paid full price like other clients it would be different. I felt be-Littled by her comments. The whole appointment took 45 minutes. That confused me because she told me she wouldn't have enough time to do my lashes next time because it would take a couple of hours, which from my experience/research is an average time for applying extensions. It made me question if she rushed. When I got up, my eye sting from the glue fumes and I was looking in the mirror to wipe it. She rushed me out of the room saying "" I have another client I need to prepare for."" I felt rushed out of the room. I was still trying to collect my things when she repeated her need to get ready for the next client. The entire hour was booked out for my appointment and seeing as she still had 15 minutes until the next appointment, I just felt she wanted me out. 

She truly is nice and I can see why others left great reviews but I left feeling embarrassed and humiliated as a Groupon customer. You should never make ANYONE feel that way but even more so a customer.",AXnwmjTL6cdEL2qh0DI1MA,11,0,1,aRnaTJArF54Nw40Vd9nriw

2003701,2017-09-18,0,lZvr_VDNWjCN_PT67StkKQ,"Just like every other review don't you dare buy a Groupon and try to use it on lashes here. What a joke!!  Taken me over a week to calm down and write this review. Never before have I used a Groupon and felt so humiliated for it. Jocelyn is a piece of work for sure. First off I had to wait bc she blamed the previous client, which right away left a bad taste in my mouth- bad mouthing your own clients.  
First impression of her corner of the salon separated by a curtain on a string and different competing music than the rest of the salon was how dirty it was. Floor was an absolute mess, un sanitized tweezers thrown everywhere, dirty pillow,.... 
She then proceeded to try and up sell me on every thing possible from the 50% lash coverage I supposedly purchased (who would buy that) to $10 more for the collagen under eye pads. Btw Jocelyn- not only do I work for the biggest under eye collagen mask companies out there but I'm also a lash artist and your price gauging for China's 20 cent version of the under eye mask is insane. Ours are top of the line and 3 separate treatments RETAILS for $10 and are INCLUDED in my pricing. So not only did I not upgrade for her to finish the remaining 50% of my lashes but I took the tape like a champ.  Prepare yourself though. Normally we prep the tape by sticking it on a clean towel first to take off majority of the tack (so it doesn't rip off the bottom lashes) not her no, she's gonna make you pay that $10 up sell one way or the other- cash or in bottom lashes. Nothing like a band aid being ripped off the delicate skin under your eyes. Who does that??  
She also doesn't seem to care what style or length you want so I was very interested to see how the 50% of my Groupon  lashes would turn out. Apparently however SHE wanted them to.  If it wasn't bad enough with all the up selling, she has a really bad attitude when it comes to rejection. She got super mad at me when ripping the tape off caused me to open my eyes too early. After reprimanding me and telling me it was too late I couldn't just close my eyes again, she stormed off to the receptionist!!  Please work on your professionalism Jocelyn, I'm not a mind reader. 
So much for any kind of friendly chat, she didn't say one word through the whole process. You'll be happy to know she actually did 100% of my lashes, not just the 50% she threatened. She does need to upgrade the thick, cheap lashes she uses. Buyer Beware.",Nur-EtB8dTfC3d8aeaXnTQ,8,0,1,8DOGYRrBNa0zD81NvZwySg

Coming from NYC, I was accustomed to my fair share of patronizing twenty year salon receptionists who spoke to you like they were somehow better than you. The male receptionist was often rude and vile. In person, he was no better.  The prices were twice as high as New York prices, maybe because they thought their artificial lake was prime real estate.  I showed up to my appointment and they turned me away claiming I wasn't on the schedule and that he insisted he had called me to confirm some other date. I looked at my voicemails and saw nothing and he realized he had called the wrong person.  Given the flawed appointment scheduling it was tough to do the eyelash refills within their strict 2 week rule and they were utterly rude during attempts to reschedule.  I pretty much vowed never to return. That is, until my bf gifted me with a surprise eyelash gift card as a sweet gesture. I was disappointed to find out he booked it at this location. I showed up, dreading the appointment and how they treated me surpassed any expectations I had that they just might be decent human beings. In sum, this is a B level salon with one eyelash attendant and their attitudes toward customers was so completely absurd, I could only chock it up to the fact that the salon seemed pervaded with this culture of being horrible people I.e. a very thinly veiled display of overcompensation for being trapped in a wannabe high class, but very sad salon.",e6NkOycHNBQTw0Oukj-10A,0,0,1,Ww96ZQB-4dfAupq_5Culug

I honestly thought they were the best things ever! I came in with a Groupon for a classic set of eyelash extensions. First thing coming in, the lady doing my lashes asked me how old I was. I told her I was 18. Then her response was ""I usually only take clients 21 and over but since you've been waiting I guess we can do it."" Then, the reason why she said that was because said eyelash extensions are something you need to keep doing and I probably don't have a job to keep with the payments. Obviously at the time, I was new there and I didn't say much. When she was done, my eyelashes were sparse and clumped. I couldn't wear contacts because my eyelashes were so stuck together that it hurt so much to even bother with my eyes.

I filled out paperwork and assuming a manicure (on their website was $25) I was so so on finding out the gc only had $5 on it. This better be a damn good manicure. Everyone was very friendly. Everyone without a doubt had a smile on their face. My nails look nice when finished and I even received a gift when I left. Discounts for my next three visits. However they will go unused because I won't be returning. Two days after I got my mani, the polish was already chipping. 6 days later, look horrible.

However, I recommend that you only purchase the one-time Groupon deal for $45 and I do not recommend that you purchase the two-week fill for $75 Groupon.  As I mentioned the tech was ok, although she was getting irritated with me for fidgeting (I couldn't help it, the table was so uncomfortable), however when I went to the reception desk to book my two-week fill, I was told that they only had two appts available, one on a Monday and another on a Friday.  I work from 5am-10pm on both days at both jobs.  I asked if they had availability on Saturday and she said no.  I also asked if there was availability the following Saturday and she said that because I booked a two-week deal and that's all that I was allowed and that I could not go beyond the two-weeks for an appointment.  I told them so basically because they only had two appts available and both days I am working all day, I was SOL for the fill that I had paid for and she shrugged her shoulders and said yes.  So I paid $30 more for a fill that I can't get because they are booked solid for the next two-weeks and won't honor my purchase past the two-week time frame.  I have never heard of a merchant not honoring something that was purchased regardless of the timeline.  I ended up having to book an appointment for a day/time that I know I can't make and will lose $30 for a service that can't be fulfilled.  That's called stealing!!

They offered me something a month later and acknowledged it would be so long since the original application, it'd have be considered, and changed as, a full set. The lashes were already far more sparse than I'd ever seen, so the almost immediate shedding of them was very disappointing. Very disappointing to not have my purchased package honored.

I called half a dozen times leaving voicemails with no calls back. I finally got a hold of someone one day to schedule. I wanted to come in for my birthday month but I was told they wouldn't be able to see my until the next month. I said that was fine I assumed they were busy. I informed them my groupon would be expiring (in June) I was told it was fine and come in July and it would be redeemed then. Groupon sent me an email to extend it past the expiration date however I saw a day or two later that time they marked it as used/redeemed. I told them I would take whatever day they had next in the morning so I can get a sitter. I was told come in July 3rd (not a day I picked, they picked) because that was when the tech was available. So again they picked that later fate and I was supposed to go in July 3rd in the morning. I received a voicemail telling me they would have to cancel my appointment and reschedule. I called back and asked what was available. I did not complain, I was flexible since I just wanted to get my manicure pedicure at this point and try this business out. I've been on the hunt for a good salon and I also have a toddler and baby so you know how that goes with pampering yourself. Anyways, I was rescheduled for July 5th at 10 am. A date they told me was next available. I accepted. My husband worked later that afternoon but drove me out to the salon with the kids so they could go to the lake area while I was there. I called as a curtesy when we were stuck in traffic and road work that I might be arriving right at 10 am or be a minute or two late. I was told ok and that they would tell the manicurist I'll be a couple minutes late. No mention of any issues or that my person wasn't even there. From where I live it was a 45 minute drive... I arrived I was greeted I was told they would let them know I am here. I sat and waited patiently. The receptionist and some other employees stood around chatting. No one said anything to me. Still I waited.. then the phone rings and I can hear the receptionist (right in front of me) say ""yes you have a 10:00 and a 3:00 appointment. A mani pedi and a hair appointment"" and hung up. I assumed it was regarding me and another client. The employee said they would grab someone, a woman comes out.

He said I understand if you don't want to reschedule but we don't have anyone that can give you services today. No manager came out. Unless that was the woman they grabbed, she was at a manicure station earlier herself though. She and the other employee stood and said nothing.

And the front receptionist should definitely be replaced or trained on how to be kind to customers coming in since the receptionist is technically the face of The Salon when people walk in. Maybe her manager told her they wouldn't honor the deal after she said they would but that is not my fault. I will be sure to tell everyone how rude these people are and the location may be nice and pretty but the people def make the pretty scenery not worth it!

I talked to my stylist on the phone concerning my first brazilian blowout. I specifically asked her if it would straighten my hair and she said yes. It didn't at all! She also said the frizz would be gone but it didnt change at all. I asked her for a trim and to not take more than an inch off. She pulled my hair into a low ponytail and snipped 3 inches off the bottom! I know this because she missed a section of hair. To say I'm livid about spending 250$ is an understatement! I absolutely hate my hair now. The blowout fried the ends to the point I can't put my fingers through it. And the shampoo and conditioner I purchased from them makes everything worse!

I left a Groupon review that said, ""The girl I got seemed irritated that I was a Groupon user and when I wouldn't upgrade services, she treated me as if I was wasting her time. She would sigh and make unpleasant gestures like I was cutting into her money making time. She rushed me and even stated that we needed to hurry for her next appointment. My Groupon included a two week refill but of course, I did not return."" I got a Groupon response from someone at that salon today stating something completely false. The response stated, ""Your 2 week fill expired and with that comes a fee and that got you irritated even more so."" Complete lie! I called and cancelled my 2 week fill in advance because I would never subject my lashes or my self-respect to someone so abrasive again. There is no need for a paying customer to deal with that. I cancelled my two week fill and went to a different salon, so NEVER did I get irritated at a fee, because there was no time or chance a fee was ever presented to me! Even with my bad experience, I called and cancelled in advance, so that the lash lady would be able to book someone else.

There are soooooo many wonderful lash places in Vegas, where they don't judge you for buying from Groupon and lower the quality of your lash extensions because you bought a Groupon. Other places won't give you a price list showing the kind of deal you're getting from Groupon, because ""good"" lash services start at about $200 there. Other places won't tell you that you will only be getting 50% of a full set, which makes no sense. Go somewhere that will appreciate your business and make you feel good about spending your money.

At first I was told they didn't accept Living Social vouchers and hadn't for a long time. I guess they didn't know that Groupon bought Living Social and kept the name as it was. Anyway, I got transferred around and finally after explaining that I had the voucher right there in my hand and that I just purchased it, I was finally able to make the appointment. So only 4 stars in customer relations. 

I got lost on the way there because it's a lot of winding streets and for some reason my phone which had the address in google maps just did not talk to me. I did call and ask for directions then found the salon shortly. It wasn't obvious where the salon was so I asked someone and they told me to take the elevator and where it was. 

Now I'm there and was only about 5, maybe 10 minutes late. My manicurist, Sanet came out and I apologized for being late and she was super nice and said not to worry about it. She made me feel comfortable right off the bat. As it turns out, she does excellent work and I'm picky. Sanet asked me how I wanted my nails shaped and I actually had them the way I wanted so she kept the shape and just neatened them up a bit. I have stubborn cuticles that grow over the nail. Where I had gone before they had used a drill on them and it left ridges. But Sanet said she wouldn't do that. She was able to clean up my cuticles without harming my nails and I was very happy about that. She continued and used quality products, not some cheap no name kind. 

After the perfect manicure, we went over to the pedicure chair. Once again, Sanet proceeded to do my pedicure and just did a phenomenal job, with the shape and the polish and the smoothing of the rough soles of my feet. 

All the while I was there, I found Sanet to be very easy to talk to and really enjoyed the experience. The salon itself is nice as well.

However, I was recently there and had met someone at the casino who had amazing, well everything.  And lucky for me, she was actually a resident of Las Vegas.  Literally from head-to-toe, I wanted to know her every beauty secret.  And ya know, when you're in Vegas things can become costly, but at the same time you want to enjoy yourself.  Long story short, I didn't have a chance to get my hair, nails & toes, lashes, and waxing done before my trip.  When I saw this dazzling beauty and found out she was a local, I just had to know her secret.  It's also nice to treat yourself to a full face of makeup for a night or two and let a pro do it, so you can sit back & relax.

She had told about The Salon at Lakeside, which was off the strip, closer to Summerlin (not far at all).  I live in Los Angeles, where all of my salon activities would end up costing me a fortune.  I was hesitant, I'm not gonna lie.  Of course we all stick with our regular ""beauty magicians"" and dare never take a chance on someone else to lay a finger on us, right?  But let me tell you, I glammed it up there and everything was not flawless, it was impeccable!!

Here's the best way to wrap this up, I may have to fly from L.A. monthly to Vegas now to go to this place for all of my beauty needs.  Let me not shock you by telling you, that a roundtrip ticket is absolutely worth every penny to get amazing service, along with wonderful company, in a lovely setting-at a GREAT price!  And so, I was there recently again, you couldn't pull me away from the tables, but thankfully the Manager, Chris, had informed me that she would send all of her best out to my hotel room, with all of their equipment and glam me up at virtually the same price!

5567590,2018-03-24,2,lZvr_VDNWjCN_PT67StkKQ,"I wish I had read the reviews here before purchasing a Groupon for eyelash extensions.  My experience was just as bad as that of the other women who have left negative comments.  First, there is the salon itself - the reception ""service"" is a disaster.  The first woman I dealt with was merely a dim bulb, but the second was downright rude - not in a snooty way, but in an abrasive, low class, doesn't know how to talk to clients kind of way.  I had picked up one of the price list handouts that they had ON DISPLAY on the counter, and without my even asking about any of the services she said, ""Those prices aren't good any more."" and SNATCHED the card out of my hand.  (She also said the prices on the website are incorrect, so they do NOT honor advertised prices.) Note to salon owners: when hiring someone in a public-interface position, make sure she wasn't raised by wolves.

Now for the eyelash service: the room in which this is performed is a little cubby hole off the reception area.  There is no door, just an opening in the wall.  Every time someone opens the front door of the salon, you feel the wind rushing in, and you can hear everything that goes on in the the reception area, including some very LOUD voices.  A side wall of the cubbyhole has a huge hole in it where it appears a door used to be, but it is just boarded up with plywood and not even painted over. The floor was FILTHY (I thought maybe it was an abstract pattern in the tile, but I bent down and touched it with my finger, and it smudged.) The linens on the table where you lie down for the service did not appear to have been changed since the previous client - unsanitary.  I seriously think that the Health  Department should pay an unannounced visit.  The description of the service in their ""contract"" says that the lashes will be chosen after consultation with the client, but there was no consultation - she just chose what she wanted to give me.  When I saw the results, I was in shock.  The lashes can most kindly be described as ""theatrical"" - basically I looked like Lucille Ball in her ""I Love Lucy"" days.  I am over 50, have extremely fair skin, flaxen blonde hair, and pale blue eyes, and there I was with midnight black lashes that would perfectly suit a showgirl on The Strip. They curve up 180 degrees and poke into my eyelids. I have to hold them down to apply either eyeshadow or eyeliner. 

The woman who did this was pleasant enough, and claimed to have worked for several high-end cosmetics companies, but said she is now doing only eyelash extensions.  That may not have been a strategic career move for her.  In any event, I actually gave her a rather generous tip because, despite my disappointment in the results, I felt sorry for her working in those conditions. I am sure she pays the salon rent for that little hovel, and they don't even supply clean linens.  Having paid a total of $91 ($46 Groupon, $10 for adhesive to hold down lower lashes, $35 tip, which they made clear should be based on the LIST price, not the Groupon price), I am now stuck with the Lucy Look for the next few weeks, and I can hardly wait until the lashes fall off.  Despite the many positive reviews for the hair stylists, I cannot imagine ever returning to this salon for anything.  Too many bad memories.",pzIjJ7GYJ2-l2i-wG7b51w,4,0,1,JS4xEgi6USkAGs3ateA8Mg

Their customer policies are an utter disappointment. :(  BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU ARE THINKING OF PURCHASING A GROUPON WITH THIS SALON.  As a result, even though I would have otherwise made this a regular salon, I will not be returning.  This is a warning to everyone who might otherwise purchase a Groupon for coming here.

First time I came in for a cut and colour.  I mentioned that I was interested in a haircut and wanted to be sure that they were available before I purchased a Groupon.  I was told on the phone that they would honour the Groupon price if I just came in without purchasing the Groupon.  At the time Groupon had an additional 20% discount offer.  Knowing that Groupon takes a cut, I opted to purchase it at the salon instead.  After my service, I was informed that while they would honour the Groupon price, they would not honour the additional 20% discount.   I was disappointed, but fine, lesson learned.

I thought I would try one more time with their lash service.  While Jocelyn did great work and I loved the results, there were parts of my experience I found disappointing.  I'm not a contact lens wearer and so my eyes watered quite a bit.  As a result I started blinking quite a bit.  It was completely involuntary and I was trying my best to keep my eyes from blinking and watering, but the tape was touching my eyeball and thus my eyes watered.  Joceyln's reaction was to inform me that if I didn't stop blinking my eyes she would have to reschedule my appointment because she had another client coming in.  I understand her schedule is busy and I know that it's not ideal to keep a client waiting, but that was one of the least customer-friendly and unsympathetic response I've experienced in quite some time.  Still, I'm sure she was having a bad day and I was willing to let that go because I wanted a salon close to home that I could come to, and she otherwise seemed very nice.

Final straw was just now.  I purchased the 2 week lash extension.  I should have thought that through better because it turns out I wasn't able to come in until 22 days later.  They should have warned me they have a strict 2 week policy.  Turns out because it's over 2 weeks (I was on vacation and I was 22 days instead of 14), I forfeited the lash extension purchase.  Despite the fact that many of my lashes were still intact and despite the fact I was perfectly willing to pay full price if they allowed me to apply the price differential e.g. apply the extra payment towards a full new set of lashes, they informed me that being over 2 weeks meant I lost ALL of my purchase credit.

I wanted this to be my regular salon and that's why I was willing to come back again, but through their strict unfriendly policies, I absolutely cannot recommend this salon.",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,12,0,1,aGo2Mk8aZsW_PS3ToCbOHQ
