I ordered a 3-item combo so I could use one of my rewards coupons for a free drink, and it was a pitiful waste of $10.  I was better off getting $10 spicy McChickens. 

Vegetable fried rice was poorly cooked. Kind of soggy and grainy. 

The Kung Pow chicken was mostly water chestnuts and cardboard carrots. 

The ""premium"" extra dollar Thai shrimp was okay at best with plenty of onions.

I'd arrived at the Excalibur at around 1 p.m. and I simply wanted to grab a quick bite, as I had some things to do and was planning to meet friends for a larger meal later that night.  I came here, got the orange chicken, fried rice and a soft drink. 

EVERYTHING they had in the pans in the display looked to be dried out, as if it was cooked hours earlier and had been sitting under warming lamps, or in baking pans ever since. The fried rice I got was OK, but the portion of orange chicken I got was pretty tiny, and while most of the pieces were fine, there was one that was a 2 inch round ball of breading with an undercooked piece of chicken in the center.  Needless to say I left that on the plate.  

For a small portion of dried out orange chicken and fried rice in a Styrofoam container and a small soft drink, I paid more than $10.  Horrible.",-VOylYXNq7sG6As966yTxA,9,6,1,ivNdLuqCarM4EhNgP332_Q

3253914,2015-06-08,0,IOwTrStIy6NinyquhBrLZQ,"Terrible! I love chinese food and Pick up Stix, I don't love you. Their chowmein was good, their fried rice was good, but the chicken was terrible. I had chow mein with orange chicken and bourbon chicken. Orange chicken was bad, couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. However, the bourbon chicken (if you decided to try it yourself) is actually probably their only good option because it was delicious. My boyfriend got chow mein and fried rice with beef broccoli and orange chicken. His beef broccoli was more leftover soysauce than actual beef, and when he did find some beef, it was tiny. What the hell? 

The food was not good, I will never come back to this restaurant. I did enjoy the potstickers, but expensive for those so not in a hurry to come back for those. 

Also weird service, the girl serving the food doesn't give enough of the 1st and 2nd options (ex: chickens, not the chowmein or rice). She hardly gave my boyfriend anything and the girl serving drinks, overfilled everyone's drink, maybe they should switch jobs. 

Pick Up Stix if you are reading this my suggestion for better food is to keep your chow mein recipe, keep your bourbon chicken, and the fried rice, but change that orange chicken recipe, that killed it and offer different potstickers. Also, make sure your servers are serving enough food for those options, because we don't want to be just eating soysauce when we're supposed to eat broccoli and beef..

This was NOTHING like the stand alone restaurant. They had the same options but did not taste anything like it. The meats were really bland and there was too much ginger in the noodles. They didn't even have the yummy potsticker sauce I remember from the old place. They just had a sweet and sour sauce that was not very good. We definitely will not be eating there again.",Sqd6-nf0gOnMAkE5tPS-FA,0,1,1,hBsQU3vdgc4bA9o0eQdN8g

Tried the orange chicken, house chicken, bourbon chicken, firecracker chicken, orange chicken, fried rice, and lo mein.  Best Chinese food court restaurant, hands down!

Orange chicken turned out worse! Waste of money. First was a little upset about how little of food they give you but now I'm really glad they didn't like that crap on. If you are staying at the Excalibur I highly recommend DO NOT GO HERE!,pbM0vMdrLhvcqMtkwJGLdg,0,0,1,oQcNxoSDfXSggUosIuXh8g

The orange chicken and fried rice tasted over cooked and burned.

At $8.99 for a combo I expected better and I have had better at other locations.

This location dropped the stix!

All the chicken (honey, orange, garlic) were either too sweet AND too salty or just underwhelming. Yeah, go someplace else, hell, I'd even recommend Popeyes and McDonalds. The fried rice was alright though (even though it could have done with less soy sauce).",fsKOJJAKMgv1KygGrm_X7w,1,0,2,9z5KEbXdVG7RXBW_QdF8oA

All Las Vegas area locations closed a while back, and I was a little heartbroken. I love their fried rice and cream cheese won tons!
When I heard about the Excalibur location, I was excited to get some of my beloved fried rice. Never mind having to drive to the Strip to get it, I was committed. The food court has been remodeled and is not hard to get to on the 2nd floor of the casino. I was diasappointed that this is a quick serve layout, which means a Panda Express type layout instead of the traditional made to order Pick Up Stix I love. Alas, they had fried rice but you can't get it with plan shrimp or chicken, only with the fancy entree items such as orange chicken or spicy shrimp. The employee was very helpful as she saw my diasappointment at the offerings, and she told me about the kid's meal with fried rice. This is not posted on the menu, and it was a pretty good deal. The fried rice was a little different than I remember, but was good enough for me to go back.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,3,8XaR0G31ATSt0YVwav9aPg
