It was 11pm and I was waiting to take my red-eye flight home.  I hadn't eaten in who knows how many hours.  I was so excited when I saw Auntie Anne's.  I wanted a warm, soft, salty pretzel with cheese sauce.  It was going to be glorious.

What I got was a room temperature, not very soft, not very salty pretzel with a pre-packaged cheese sauce that when opened was the most rancid-looking cheese I've ever seen.  It had separated and had this oily, congealed texture.  I really wanted cheese sauce so I gathered up all my luggage and trekked it back up there.  I showed them the cheese sauce and I asked ""is this how it's supposed to look?""  The girl made a face and handed me another one.  I checked the new one.  Ew.  Same thing.  She gave me a third one.   This one didn't look as bad but it didn't look that good either.  I debated whether I should give this one a go and asked for sweet mustard as a back-up.

Go back to my gate and get settled in.  I try both of the sauces.  Double ew.  They're just gross.  Even the sweet mustard which I'd think it'd be hard to mess up tasted too sweet and yet, bitter.

I agreed and thought it was nice of him to let me know the other pizzas weren't fresh. I watched them make my pizzas and watched others walk by. When I got my pizzas I ordered a cheese sauce to add flavor to my pizzas. I also should have ordered a soda too because I bought one from the bookstore for almost $4. The pizzas were little soft but they were made from pretzel dough so I guess that's how it is. It satisfied me and filled me up so that was good. The customer service was really good as well.

They have slushies and drinks alone with *gasp* hot dog pretzels. If you're really hungry there are combos with drinks and pretzels, not too pricey for the freshness and the variety. 

They also have a lot of dipping sauces, the caramel goes best with the sweet pretzels whereas the cheese goes good with the savory pretzels. Pretzel sticks are twenty or so cents extra but I think you get more dough and they are easier and less messy to eat.

Auntie Anne's sells two types of breakfast sandwiches........

1. Bacon & Egg Breakfast Sandwich
2. Sausage & Egg Breakfast Sandwich

After purchasing two breakfast sandwiches, and two coffees which came out to $15.95...........I realized the food & coffee was just plain lousy!
