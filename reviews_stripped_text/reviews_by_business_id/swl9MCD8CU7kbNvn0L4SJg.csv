We ordered the Chicken Panini which was 14 or 16 bucks i think and a side of fries and that was 6 bucks i believe, which was kinda pricey. We had to wait 10-15 mins for our food which wasn't to long but the BF thought so. The Panini was so good and so was the fries, its just the price that made it not so great i think after tax it was about 24 bucks just for those 2 things!",c4K6T9igqe5WSe-nMP-bNw,0,0,3,32pEV2A6iXGNRiun-8MKOA

124299,2012-04-20,0,swl9MCD8CU7kbNvn0L4SJg,"My 'Burgers to-do' list in my phone is constantly growing and changing, and I tend to knock off the ones I'm more excited about as opposed to places that have been on the list for a long time. Such is the case with Skybox at Aria, it's been on my list for well over a year but I've had no desire to park at City Center and make my way in there. Having to be on the strip yet again for a meeting around lunch time I took the opportunity to check off one more typically avoided strip location. Was it worth the wait?

Skybox is located in a space that looks like a corridor in any other part of City Center, but in this case they happened to drop in some tables and a bunch of TV screens to make it into a 'sports bar'. I use this term very loosely as the 'bar' has no identity other than a couple framed pictures of old sports legends and said tables. The menu offers everything you would expect from a sports bar: wings, nachos, salads, hot dogs, cheese steaks and of course burgers. I also noted right away while glancing the menu that everything is around $15+ which seemed a bit high, more on that later.

I went with the American Burger which is your standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cheddar along with a house made spread. There was a good char flavor upon first bite, something I've experienced with the last few burgers I've eaten. It was a tiny bit overcooked but close to the medium-rare I ordered, it was nice and juicy and had ok beef flavor. The tomato was very fresh, the onions were ok, but the cheese was not entirely melted and I seemed to hit some sort of a cold spot at one point between the cheese, tomatoes and even meat. The potato(?) bun was ok, maybe a tiny bit thick, but the meat to bun ratio was off as I had a good chunk of bun sitting on my plate at the end all by itself. I kind of forgot about the house made spread from the menu while I was eating it and just assumed at one point that I was mayo. It didn't really taste like much more than that at least. Overall it was ok, again nothing above a typical pub burger.

The thick cut fries were surprisingly good; they were cooked well and had good flavor. They were actually a welcome change to the norm I have been coming across lately. As I was writing some notes down upon completion of my meal I wrote out a score of 86, which is possibly a bit high but what I consider slightly above average and fair for this...that is until I was handed my bill. My $15 burger somehow transformed into a $27 meal! I must have fries with a burger and I didn't really pay attention to the menu, but $6 for hand cut fries is just insane. And to top it off they charged me $4.50(!!!) for an iced tea. WTF?! This change of events quickly turned around my entire outlook on this meal and made it a total fail; strip location or not $27 for a barely above average burger meal for one person is just freakin' insane. I couldn't recommend this to anyone.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,2,zzY4qJmA8-egcfRQppGt6Q

I had a few Dogfish Head 60 minutes after a VERY tiring 12 hour seminar and left feeling extremely relaxed. 

Our server, Jason, was very attentive and hilarious and dropped jokes about macro and micro economics - I wonder if he knew there were a bunch of dorky actuaries dinning at the restaurants that night.

The mac and cheese they use bow tie pasta, not conventional but they make it work. They use smoked gouda, and cheddar and top it off with toasted herb  bread crumbs! 

The chili here is amazing, I'm from Texas and I know chili. Inside they use carne asada beef, aged cheddar, and a good dollop of sour cream. They top it off with a pepper to give it an extra kick! The chili comes with cornbread with actual kernels of corn baked into it. 

Few notable entry's are the  sweet potato fries, Philly cheesesteak, and the Caesar salad (huge).

So we flew into Skybox Sports Bar &Grill,   We asked the waitress if we could share our dishes and she said ""absolutely!""  That's great!

We ordered the calamari & rock shrimp, and a chicken caesar salad.

Both were terrific!

The calamari & rock shrimp came with red peppers, in a delicious batter (not too thick) and two dipping sauces.  The first was a great remoulade, that did not taste like mayo (which is a plus!) The other one was green, almost like a salsa verde.  That was good as well.

The chicken caesar salad was delicious as well!  It was a very big salad and the chicken was cooked perfectly.   The dressing was great with crisp leafy greens.  There were tomatoes in the salad which added a nice flavor to the salad.

Sure the prices were a lil steep.  But since we shared, we walked out of the there for like $30 (for 2 appetizers) but were contently full!   It was probably one of the cheapest and fastest places in Aria.",Ii1PkdRpONUNwKC3lmhl1A,2,2,4,AA4mqY7fH61wVzTeJjvNHQ

Mac & Cheese- Literally easy mac probably tastes better than this. It was ribbon bow pasta with what tasted like a chalky velveta -ish mixed with salmon cream cheese. The second it oxidized it got chalky and the sauce was not good.

Chicken strips- pretty much what you get everywhere else. 

Sweet potatoe fries- YUM! Delicious! get them! definitely worth i think the extra $4......coated with seasalt . The taste lingers in my mouth.

But the real *stars* at Skybox are the wings: these wings are 95th percentile jumbo-sized and if you get them tossed in a mixture of BBQ and Hot Buffalo - VOILA! - you have a tremendous set of Spicy BBQ wings on your hands. Wing orders come adorned with very fresh celery and carrots and a show-off chunky bleu cheese dressing with big sunken bleu cheese chunks (try saying that 5x real fast.)

Ok, yes the food here is not exactly cheap, but that's what MLife comps are for, right?

Most of the Skybox orders end up being room-charged to corporate expense accounts or to people's MLife players club cards so it feels wrong to dissuade people from eating here because it's slightly more expensive than the food at a Ruby Tuesday's. To me, the Skybox food is worth it: not having to leave the Casino = more time to hang out at the pool and enjoy the steam shower in your suite.

Wing note: the Skybox wings seem to come from the same supplier that provides Lemongrass (the Thai restaurant in Aria) their wings. Lemongrass smokes their wings and sends them out with a bit of honey/fish sauce. This is another awesome wing within 200 yards of Skybox. 

Hungry for wings all of a sudden? I'm also a fan of the brined & fried chicken wings at Le Thai. Those are served with a homemade sriracha ranch. The smoked wings at the Las Vegas Grille are also outstanding (and available in pineapple jerk!)",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,0,1,3,oQbdSF5Fy3gkvB2cvQF4Fg

The main screen high def TV is absolutely huge and the most impressive thing I've seen since Jonah Hill with his shirt off.

The place also has at least thirty other tv screens to simultaneous watch sports and Knight Rider reruns at the same time. 

Also the chefs at the Aria sport book are culinary innovators that should be applauded for their unbelievable creativity. Have you ever heard of putting a piece of beef between a bun? What. No way! Or how about this frying a small chicken wing then putting hot sauce on it. Incredible! I guess the chefs here call it buffalo wings or something. Shocking no one else has thought of this stuff!

The place is beautiful, which isn't something you usually associate with a sports bar. I loved that they had many TV's and since I was staying at the Vdara it was the closest sports bar. 

My main gripe: 

1) beer is expensive. It should be again the law to have the cheapest beer at a sports bar be $6. PBR was $6. That's not right. I don't mind if you gouge me on food but I'm not buying more than one beer if you rip me off so blatantly. PBR is at most $3. At most. 

I wouldn't call this a true sports bar. It's more like a nice hotel with a bunch of tv's that happen to be playing sports. If you want a quiet place to eat and have a beer while watching the game this is it but not a true sports bar. 

The nachos were excellent, albeit $13 or so.",ZBLZIOrO3DZJzDFlFO-bJw,2,1,4,JJ_aOP5ujk3ckXQkaattXA

I got a pasta dish and the b/f got a turkey burger and then we shared an Elvis inspired dessert! 

Everything was fabulous! Our waitress was SO friendly and helpful in suggesting ideas and she was right on the spot. This was probably the best meal we had in our four day trip.  They also have a take out window on the other side so you can order food to take back to your room!  Great idea...

So why only four stars? It's because this place is expensive for what it is, which is nothing more than a jazzed up sports bar. But considering how expensive the other Aria restaurants are this was still a good deal.

Burger comes and glass still empty...

The Skybox eatery/take out window is the closest place to get some food if you happen to be at the Aria sports book. My boyfriend is a sports book fiend and we spent a good deal of time in the sports book betting on games and watching them.  Since our group snagged some prime seats in the sports book, none of us wanted to go to a sit down restaurant to eat, which brought us to Skybox TO-GO  :)

After some hemming and hawing and finally on the suggestion of the very nice and rather plump older guy behind the counter, I settled on the turkey club which happened to be a best seller and the plump guy's personal fave. 

***Hands down, the best turkey club sandwich I've ever had!!!***

I'm sooo NOT a club sandwich person and prefer a juicy burger over a club sandwich anytime, but this effing sandwich was friggin tasty!  Buttered and toasted bread slathered with some pesto type mayo. a generous pile of turkey, fresh tomato and lettuce, and thick crispy bacon. The sandwich is cut into quarters and skewered with toothpicks to hold everything in place. No side is included, but not really needed since its filling by itself.

The following day was a repeat of our day before: snagged prime seats in the sports book; ordered the turkey club from Skybox TO-GO; and happily ate.",klHHSCnS585M05uACWK5nw,0,0,5,eww-fPxbbDsF6Kdko2m9og

While I had to wait awhile to get a table, it was new year's day and everyone wanted to watch the rose bowl on the many tvs that surround the dining room. My bro and I ordered the nachos grande and fried calamari with shrimp for appetizers and I had the angus burger for my entree. The nachos were seriously the best nachos I've ever had. I don't know if it's cause I was hungry or what, but they were the best nachos EVER. In fact, the table next to us ordered one of their own because they had ""nacho envy."" The fried calamari was tasty, and fried properly, not too greasy, and came with two delicious sauces, one jalapeno salsa based, the other spicy mayonaise based. I could not fully enjoy the angus burger, which was topped with crispy onions and blue cheese, as I was already stuffed from the appetizers. 
I wish the tables were a lot bigger since our orders filled up the table, making it harder to navigate and place our drinks without fear of spilling them. The $9 bottle of Fiji water is a major rip off, even by vegas standards. And, you would think a burger would come with a side of fries. Here they don't, and the side order of fries is actually the size of an entire entree, making it hard to finish the entire meal.

Since it is a sports bar/restaurant, Skybox has a deep roaster of finger foods and other appetizers, that is intended to be consumed with reasonable, yet bordering on generous, amount of beers and cocktails.  The nachos is generous and pretty damn good, especially as something to munch on during interesting games. But the Big Game Wings is definitely one of the top reasons for traversing through the rows of slot and table games in Aria to get to this side of the casino.  

Besides dropping by during game times, Skybox is also a great place to have a business lunch or dinner or a pre-show meal.  It is fairly quiet during lunch on weekdays, and after the games, so business can easily be conducted over a casual meal.  

The salads that I have tried are all fantastic.  Especially The Rocket, which is highly recommended. The portion is large enough to be considered an entree (the pecans, crasins, goat cheese crumble and white balsamic vinaigrette are the stars of this arugula salad) . If you want something a little heftier, try the Black and Blue Burger or the Sky Burger.  Both are fantastic and are some of my favorite burgers to order on the Strip.

Price is pretty reasonable for a mega resort on the Strip, plus the kitchen does not skimp on the portion, so it is definitely worth the money.

The Happy Hour here are offered weekdays from 3-5pm.  Select appetizers are $6 each, with cocktails at $7 and wines at $5.  Great for pre-gaming or hanging out with your new best friend.

Service:  4.5/5  Super nice and attentive. Split checks, not a problem. Them are pros looking out for ya, while you get your grub on.

Food:  4/5  It is not your every day corner sports bar food. That's a good thing.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  You don't have enough pairs of eyes at the table to eyeball all the monitors in this place.

Price:  4/5  Expensive when compared to the hole-in-the-wall sports bar, but really reasonable compared to its peers.

Value:  4/5  Most people can't finish their salads. Yeah, them leafy greens that weighs a fraction of what a typical serving of burger and fries.
