I had the menudo which was not really impressive. It was really bland and the tripe was not as soft as I want it. They have the sauces on the side; I guess you add the flavor yourself and adjust to your liking.     Tripe is cheap; they should not skimp out on the portions. I had corn tortillas but I was never offered a choice. Sadly, I prefer flour tortillas. I also had the junior French toast meal for a 4 year old. Not bad and priced well. Egg was cooked to order and ft he presentation was attractive. 

Service was not super good just typical. I got a refill on my coffee 3x. The food took a while to come out. I would say 20 minutes. It's an okay place I just think you the other reviews are a bit overrated but you decide for yourself.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,3,2,3,WCRmlnV4tOzT_75C0pUe8w

Oh man.  Here's the tough part.  My friend and I shared a few different plates.  One was the Chicken Enchilada Omelette.  Now you'd think the enchilada sauce would have an awesome full flavor.  It was very bland.  I think the waitress knew this and offered to bring out their salsas.  It maybe helped a bit but not enough to save it.  The plus side is their potatoes on the side were crisp and delicious.  They were probably the best part of the meal.  

We also shared the fruit crepes.  Again it was another disappointment.  The fruit wasn't as ripe as it should have been.  The crepes seemed soggy as if they were reheated.  0 for 2.  Bummer.

We ordered two meals to share- the chicken enchilada omelet and the fresh fruit crepes. Both arrived to the table looking nice but neither had much flavor. The enchilada sauce was pretty bland but ample sauce, chicken, and cheese were used. The crepes had fresh fruit, but the whipped cream was more like a flavorless foam and the crepe itself was an odd texture. Maybe breakfast isn't their forte.

The service was attentive and friendly throughout and the location is clean with a recently-remodeled feel. They have great low pricing and good portions, and their menu is extensive. I'll keep this spot in mind for a cheap, filling meal, but maybe scale back your expectations for flavor.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,13,3,c5EJtcDZkvYMMQzw7qX4aA

The minute it was definitely different than what I'm used to. But it was still cook really well, soft, tasty and hit the spot on a cold rainy afternoon.  The eggs were cooked perfect medium the way I liked it over easy. The hashbrowns were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I also asked for my bacon crispy and I was kind of odd that it wasn't crispy on the ends but Crispy be in the center.  I think the chef needs to work on his bacon frying skills and look into a bacon iron.

The total value with the deal is five stars. But I really don't think I would come back for regular price even though the specials are very reasonable. Unless I totally lose my butt and I need to get some food before I leave Vegas. Which has happened plenty of times.

Their exceptional food and deals led me to bring my wife and kids back the next day!  They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day long and currently they offer promotions such as ""Kid's eat free"" and ""50% off dinner entrees after 4pm"".   

On our first visit, we all ordered steak and eggs.  A nice juicy steak cooked exactly to your liking paired with three eggs and potatoes and toast or chilaquiles.  Our server happened to be the owner and he explained that he named his restaurant after his daughter. Nice.  There was only one other table of customers at that time so we were waited very well.  Waters were filled promptly and various hot sauces were offered.  If you're adventurous, do try their homemade red sauce.   It's literally smoke and fire in your mouth but it's really good if you like it hot.

Our second visit was in the afternoon.  Still one or two other tables being waited on but we were always able to grab our server's attention when needed.  This time I ordered the steak fajitas taco salad, my wife had the Nutella and strawberry french toast with whipped cream, and my daughter was able to get a free kid's meal, pancakes, scrambled egg, and two pork sausage links.

All our food was spectacular.  My taco salad came with topped fresh sliced avocado and a side of ranch.  My wife and kids definitely satisfied their sweet tooth on the french toast and my daughters devoured their kid-sized pancakes.  

There are a plethora of options to choose from on their menu which include breakfast entrees, burgers, sandwiches, steaks, salads, chicken parm and more.  There's definitely something for everyone here and I highly encourage you to try this place out if you're in this side of town.

Came here for breakfast on our first day in Vegas and returned 3 days later.  Boy were we pleasantly surprised.  This little storefront restaurant is amazing.  For breakfast the first time, my husband and I both ordered different omelettes; not only were they enormous but filled with the choices we made.  On the second visit, we decided to try something different.  My husband ordered the 3 egg combo breakfast which included 6 slices of bacon, a choice of potatoes and choice of toast or an English Muffin.  The ice coffee is without a doubt the best I have ever had.  Anyone who knows me can tell you that I am very picky about Ice Coffee.  Our servers were phenomenal.

What blows my mind is how they used canned??? strawberries. I'm not from Vegas, but I'm hoping fresh fruit isn't that hard to find where restaurants forgo it. They have a preservative taste that once biting into, makes you think that these strawberry slices have been sitting in a plastic container somewhere for a couple of weeks. 

Then... the BANANAS. The bananas are blackish and gummy. Blackish and GUMMY!!! Who uses those words to describe bananas??? These bananas literally look like they mummified before being delivered to me....

And the piece de l'resistance is the French toast. Oh boy. You know the texture of stale bread is like? It rips a certain way, it's fluffy, flavorless, and dry all at the same time? That's this French toast. 

Unfortunately, this entire order reminded me of those questionably ""healthy"" cafeteria breakfasts from high school, slapped together by pissy lunch ladies, but worse. A lot worse.",ZzPCPCiJrb5IbLpI3IF5IQ,2,1,1,YoIMkh_TcMFnmL6twJhIIQ

There's also a kids menu selection for the little ones.  Very reasonable prices with a number of specials. 

They've done a great job renovating the space (a former sushi bar) and it's very clean and inviting. I wish them good luck at this location. They open at 6:00 am so this is the perfect spot for early risers.

From the get go I think Erica was having a bad day & maybe she just took her frustration out on her unfriendly shallow attitude.
I politely asked her if possible could the a.c. be turned up because it was a Sunday morning & it felt so warm & stuffy inside, she said she would check...
 She got my order wrong
Then when my food was remade I guess the cooks remade it so fast that they forgot to add avocado to my burrito. Not to mention she didn't bring my husband's toast & worst of all we asked for an ice tea refill & my husband told her I'd like a refill but I'm not done with this one yet....he told her about 3 times but Erica still wanted to take my husband's drink away. I don't know why she didn't want to let my husband finish his drink....
By this time as any normal person might feel I was beyond frustrated & saddened by the awful service & the way we were being treated.
Although I told Erica ""ummmmm hello don't take his ice tea"" She then told me Is there a reason why you have attitude with me? I was shocked she asked me that because all she had to do was apologize instead she confronted me which took a lot of balls to do!
I admit My reaction wasn't the best but for the way she was acting with us was unexcuseable. The manager came over & apologized for Ericas poor service & comped my meal. 
My husband & I go to Elys all the time the waitress Veronica always took care of us with such great care. Because of the gossip that Erica obviously told everyone including her friend Veronica who my husband & I gratefully admired & became somewhat close acquaintances with has stopped talking to me & she deleted me off of her social media accounts. Which is very sad how Veronica took sides & my husband & I as costumers will never ever go back to Elys again.

I was seated and after telling the waitress that I had a Groupon she said she had to speak to the manager about it.

I said OK, I'll order a cheeseburger to go.  They then accepted the coupon.  I do not understand the concept but it is what it is.  I don't think I'll do business with either Ely's or Groupon in the future.  The concept of buying a coupon in advance to save money is one thing.

This restaurant isn't located on the Strip... this place isn't Hash House A Go Go, Momofuku, Wicked Spoon nor is it Eggslut (although I've bookmarked those places for future visits) but because of that it doesn't have the food prices you pay when dining at the Strip. Get it? For a little over $20 we were able to fill our tummies with delicious food.

I had Ely's Burger. Beef, cheese, grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and mayo... hold the pickles and red onion, please. The meal came with crinkle-cut fries. I love the mushrooms in this burger. Tasty and delicious!  Hubby had the Bacon (or Sausage) Skillet. He scarfed it down... no need to ask him if he enjoyed his meal. 

This place has a casual dining atmosphere, nothing fancy. They serve classic American food, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Great, affordable prices. Our table was well taken care of. Very attentive servers but not overly. They were friendly and nice. Hubby loves wearing his GS Warriors shirts and it always gets attention from sports fans when we go places. Had engaged in a convo with the server who also processed our bill (Lakers fan). Then, I'm not sure if it was the owner that said to me as we were leaving... ""review us in Yelp"" (now how did he know I Yelp??). Worth coming back to when we're in town again :)

Food came out rather quick as there really wasn't that many customers inside , I was 1 of 3 tables, the food although plain looking tasted great , the eggs were cooked a perfect over medium , the potatoes crisp and piping hot , the bacon a perfect crispness ( and tasty ) , the sausage equally as good , my only beef with the meal was the peppers and onions were a little over done and limp ( maybe pre cooked ?) and the cheese was sparse and barely melted, which I don't know how because food was hot , ( obviously bagged and maybe not natural ) I see that in a lot of casino type cafe places as a way to keep costs down , but when you are serving a good product the ingredients should be up to par as well ( that's my opinion) but all in all I definitely would be back maybe to try one of their burgers next time and all in all for 8.99$ it is a great deal and I left full !!",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,0,0,4,i7CCKMkUYBXLPp_1xfYnhg

Boyfriend said his burrito ""wasn't spectacular"" but still liked it enough to finish 3/4ths of it. Overall this place was ok, I don't think I enjoyed it enough to come back.

5383916,2017-08-12,0,upgjUq616Yz1IvAvysDLWA,"This is my second review for Ely's; but, this time I've got pics!!!!!
Ely's is offering buy one, get one free after 4pm. That alone is fantastic. My fear is that they are offering it because they are not doing well. We lose too many good local places. It's a passion of mine to support local places, when they deserve it. Ely's does.
Last night, I had the tilipia cooked in spinach, mushroom, and alfredo sauce. My husband had the bbq chicken and shrimp. Both were delicious. My husband and I are rather talented in the kitchen, so eating out can be a mixed experience. I'm always excited when I have a dish that is not something I could make better. (I know, now I seem obnoxious and conceited. I promise I'm not. I'm actually kinda cute and sweet.)
Both of our dishes were lovely with excellent portion sizes. It's just the entree, no soup or salad. They do offer a nice appetizer menu. They also offer a lot of sweets for desserts. Twice now, I haven't had room for one of their crepe or stuffed french toast offerings. My body and I had words about it!!! The pictures look yummy and more than a bit decadent. Definitely something to try.
I do always try to include information for those of us concerned with mobility, seating, and access. If you don't struggle with mobility and size concerns, please feel free to go back to the part about the desserts. If bathrooms and seating keep you out of restaurants, you will appreciate this. The chairs are sturdy and without arms. There are mostly booths; but, I've not had to wait for a table. I was VERY pleased with the ladies restroom. It is wide enough for a walker or other device. The door is not super heavy; which can be quite a struggle when you're managing a walker. When will ""they"" design doors that are reachable, light enough to open with one hand, and don't swing into you? Ok, that's a soap box for another time! Ely's door is less difficult than most and they have amble space on either side of the commode, plus 2 rails!!! The commode is a bit low, but there are 2 rails, so no problem. 2 rails and space!!!
Service was wonderful. It has been both times. Our server treated us like a regular on our second visit. She's attentive, personable, and seems genuinely interested in your having a good time. There's no pressure to turn over the table or push to order more.
I hope we can keep this local gem going strong. Check out the buy one, get one after 4pm!",DwtArpGbgdqWOWnJzNGTpg,1,0,5,-tUteyomZ3SUDIpW0f6HIQ

The next morning sorry later that morning we were craving some good breakfast food. I searched Yelp and found Elys. Let's just say the food was so good we kept coming back. The service and food was awesome (5-stars).,MgUi4xaIku_31tcjJSKmmQ,0,0,5,qrMbDl_iC4-8m8xsF46P0A

It took a little to get drink orders in and received but once we got moving, service was good. Very nice staff. The menu has a great mix of breakfast items and are reasonably priced. The kids menu is good and offers a variety of options for my picky eater. I had the veggie omelet. Although it is filled with a frozen veggie mix--it was delicious. Everyone was happy with their selections. Since its near my office, we'll be back for dinner soon.",0PdDPWmbo5CZHp-zJUqaRQ,0,0,4,-zag3o75U_AMDlubkqV-qg
5946426,2016-10-23,0,upgjUq616Yz1IvAvysDLWA,Very impressed!  Found Ely's on Uber Eats and was dying for breakfast.  Ordered a build your own breakfast burrito and the waffles with strawberry/banana.  Both were VERY good.  Burrito wasn't greasy or soggy like most are after delivery and the waffles were made with real waffle batter.  5 stars for sure!,dB0nYdXblxcNxCHq0sr48w,0,0,5,mWhGZHAFhuQ0cvs_8PHoxQ
