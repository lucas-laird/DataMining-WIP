I had the mini crab cakes and they were delicious and full of fresh crab meat and herbs. The waitress was polite and the service was great!

The service was very good as well but this restaurant will have a hard time staying open if it keeps running out of things on the menu.  At lunch today they were out of 4 or 5 things.  Also the guy I was there with wanted dessert and the one he wanted they were out of as well.  Not to mention their computer system went down so they had to hand write his receipt for reimbursement purposes.  Not a great experience but I'd try it again simply because I liked the dish...which came with a basket of bread you can feed an army with.",mlTKW1oYxj4fMvAJKHd9mw,0,0,3,dxLtdxFNsi23EOK5qasL-w

Our server Mahsa was excellent.  Very attentive and friendly. When they didn't have the wine my wife ordered she brought out, without us asking, a sample of one she thought may be similar. 

The food was average.  The ""killer shrimp"" was not ""killer"" by any stretch. My wife's salmon was better than my shrimp, but wasn't excellent. Their specialty drinks were 80% ice.  The best thing we ate was the ahi appetizer.  That was delicious.

Monday night, and I heard on the radio about this place that just opened up in town square and becoz I'm familiar with killer shrimp in CA I thought I would check this place out since I actually craved the broth from killer shrimp in CA. Anyways we get there, place is roomy and not busy, usually not a good sign but I mean the place is new so I said this is fine, I'm hungry and we get serviced rite away.  Hostess and server were great, service was fast and pleasant but the food I wasn't to impressed with. Just missed happy hour, but I decided to have a drink, they're KS Mojito was really good.  we had the calamari that was good with a surprisingly spicy ranch, and killer fries. those were good too, luv Cajun spices!! I had the killer shrimp original *shelled*, I wasn't impressed. The broth was to spicy for me but I dealt with it, it took away from enjoying the flavors in the broth, the shrimp was tough like it was overcooked and the ""French"" bread was eh, tasted store bought. ANYWAYS, overall experience was ok coz the servers were nice and I'm guessing it was the manager on shift but someone came over and greeted us and saw how we were doing. lucky for me, on Monday nights they have a special on they're killer shrimp I guess they bring down the price to its ""original"" price whatever that means and so I guess for the price it was ok.  becoz I try everything twice just to make sure I DONT like it then i'll be stopping again to see how I feel about this place. maybe i'll stop by the CA location again and compare.",RIroUg2XJyrqzfc-waGZcA,0,1,3,FECgKBIT7G48D6eWSAQRLg

There was one waiter laughing and hanging onto two ladies (guests) and no one else. We walked to the bar and had to call the bartender for assistance. He said to go outside and someone should be with us. We were seated ordeted ice tea but didn't get any sugar. Asked the waitress for sugar but never got it. Went inside to get the sugar myself but no workers were around. I walked around the bar and 3 employees came out from the back. I asked one of them for sugar and she gave me a look like she wanted to beat me. Our salad finally came and was drenched with liquid. The boiled eggs had green rings around the yolk.

I definitely recommend paying the extra $2 to have your shrimp shelled. Only having to worry about the tails, makes a much easier to eat meal!  I can't imagine having to take the shrimp out of the broth & peel it! My husband enjoyed the braised short rib entree.

418713,2016-06-18,0,0qPNeqLuKE88rKbIbSZDpg,"Underwhelming at best.  Very expensive for what you get along with slow and mediocre service.  When we got there the woman who greeted us was very nice (not a hostess though, don't know where she was) as was the server.  We ordered the killer shrimp with rice, lobster ravioli with spinach salad to start.  25 minutes later, we still didn't have our salad and our server hadn't been seen or stopped by in at least 15 minutes.  We had a 3 year old in tow and to keep him entertained for long periods of time while we try to enjoy a meal is tough, so very slow service is always annoying to us.  The salad finally came and while tasty, it was absolutely drenched in dressing (our bad for not ordering it on the side like we normally do, but I don't know why they always feel the need to drown the salad in dressing!).  Another 10-15 minutes and our food came.  My wife's lobster ravioli actually was tasty but was a fairly small serving for the price.  My killer shrimp was just a 10-15 overcooked shrimp in a vat of fairly tasteless and generically spicy sauce.  THIS is their ""signature"" sauce that supposedly takes hours to prepare?  It tasted like salty chicken broth, oil, cayenne pepper and maybe some other unidentifiable spices thrown in.  Nothing to write home about at all.  They serve it with french bread which is the very cheap, low quality, tasteless .99 a loaf @Walmart type.  Not impressed at all.  With two glasses of mid-priced wine, our bill topped $70 so with tax and tip we were around $90 for this...VERY expensive for the quality, the portions and the mediocre service!  Seems this is a common experience from the many other reviews here which essentially say the same thing (bad service, average at best food).  I think this place will (and should) be another casualty just like all of the previous restaurants that have failed at this exact spot.

The broth was a little too watery for me if you order it with the pasta or rice but for dipping bread in its good. Just a little warning for those of you that can't handle heat, it's a little on the spicy side which I like, but for my girlfriends, it was a little too spicy and they only have one heat level.

This location in Town Square has had much turnover.  It doesn't have the greatest atmosphere and Killer Shrimp didn't remodel.  We arrived on a Saturday night around 6:00.  It wasn't crowded at all.  We were seated immediately, but we waited at least 20 minutes, it was very warm and no one came to our table after the hostess seated us.  Finally we got up to ask someone and it was the manager, she got us a server right away.  The server was new, most likely never in this position before and while she was attentive and friendly, she didn't know the menu well or how to handle some of our questions, we had someone who needed help with gluten free options.  Instead of offering to find out our questions she just said no.  Overall she was fine, just needs a bit more time.  The manager sent over a shrimp cocktail appetizer to apologize for our wait and it was very good.  Big pieces of shrimp along with a dish of chopped shrimp and cucumber mixed with cocktail sauce and served with tortilla chips. At our table we had orders of the killer shrimp, one with rice, one with pasta and then an order of the roasted chicken.  One order of killer shrimp was too spicy but mine (with noodles) was great.  It was spicy but really good, I made the mistake of not getting it shelled, the way the menu read it didn't have the option for the shelled with pasta or rice, next time I'll ask.  Also the temperature was so hot it was difficult to eat for quite some time.  The bread was a disappointment.  Very generic and nothing great, I seriously was expecting better.  The roasted chicken came with mashed potatoes and asparagus and was great.  While we had several glitches, I loved the killer shrimp and pasta and my boyfriend was very impressed with his roasted chicken, we will most likely try it again.",JmZH21Ow9hCICMcbbkLq6A,0,0,3,8YAW7liIXBHPVCfdIkAG_w

Our server was Kindra and I can say with confidence (because I eat out often) that she's one of the best servers I've encountered. Kindra demonstrates knowledge about the establishment's food/beverages both in their recipes and general background when it comes to the history of Killer Shrimp.  She brings to her guests an engaging, warm, and positive attitude. Since I've only been to the restaurant in the mid-afternoon & into the evening, service can be a bit slow and I don't know if that's simply a reflection of staffing or not, but in spite of it, Kindra takes it all in stride focusing on guest needs.  I spoke with the manager upon leaving Killer Shrimp, praising this server because I think that often when diners have good experiences, they fail to share it with the one person who needs to know it. Killer Shrimp has *DELICIOUS* food and FANTASTIC lemon-drop martinis so if you visit, get whatever it is you LOVE in terms of seafood and ask to sit in Kindra's section of the restaurant.

The broth is okay, and the shrimp is just boiled shrimp--there's nothing ""killer"" about the broth or the shrimp itself.

The service was decent, but the dish we had came with corn, and we had to ask for it--the kitchen didn't send it out, and we were one of two parties in the place early on a Wednesday evening.

The dressing had a nice kick to it. I think to the casual diner it may be a bit too spicy. My only knock on the salad was the less than fresh cucumber. For entree, I had the Fisherman's stew and added a lobster tail. The stew was the best seafood stew I have had. Tons of rich tomato flavor, no too creamy.

Don't understand some of these crazy negative reviews, they sound a bit far fetched. 

I've gone here now 4 times since it's opened. 

I will agree that they seem to be slow in service some nights, but seems it's because they are understaffed? Which ... It's a restaurant ppl, that tends to happen from time to time. At least they were understaffed when we went there for lunch once, but the food was good just took a while. 

The other times I've had great, attentive, friendly service. I love sitting at the bar. I think you get served faster. The bartenders are all friendly and hard working as well as the rest of the staff. 

The clam chowder second time having it And The bartender suggested I add Habanero sauce and I have to say it's awesome wth the hot sauce so I reviewed it again lol. 

I've had the killer shrimp and it was good but personally I lovedddd the fisherman's stew. I think it's superior to the killer shrimp dish but that's just my personal preference. The broth is amazing, love the spiciness. Some reviewed that that they hated it but If you love spicy Cajun flavor you'll dig it. 

The oysters are great and fresh. I would recommend those on their happy our menu.

I had The Westside, one of their speciality drinks. Sarah was my bartender and she was awesome. The drink was good, refreshing and on their Happy Hour menu which is 3-6 & 10- midnight. Happy hour is worth it. Speciality drink of the day is only $5 bucks! 


I'll have to come back and try all the different things on the menu including the drinks! Hopefully this place sticks, I like having a seafood option! I always order the chowder at Yardhouse but I think I might start going here instead!",t9x0DuJ-9a_BSwWdG6S7ng,1,0,5,q8h7iZe2Nb8VgHUDGY_swA

My girlfriend and I shared a salad and the Mac n cheese and both were so, so good. The food did take a long time to come out, but it was worth it. I'm always used to great service here and the staff was awesome. Gaby took stellar care of us at the bar.

It so ridiculous with what they charge and that's all you get. So we asked our waiter if the platter only come with 6 shrimp and she very bluntly yes I GOT A LOT of complaints about that and walked away, showing no remorse that I was obviously disappointed with our dish. If she already got multiple complaints about it she could  have warn us when we were ordering. After that her attitude completely change and wasn't very accommodating all.

The lobster mac n cheese is literally their best dish. I highly recommend it. It is extra cheesy and the lobster meat tastes very well with this dish. Their street corn is spicy but very tasty, and it may just be me, but I am almost positive it had crab meat on it. Their signature Killer Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta is very delicious. The dish is spicy and served in a broth, but if you can handle it, I guarantee you'll love it. Their clam chowder was a little bland, but if you're like me and like your soups less salty, then it will be perfect for you. The spinach salad was also very delicious (because it had bacon).

Their service though...I cannot express how disappointed I was in this place. I came up to the hostess stand to get a table and the hostess kept standing there cleaning menus and ignoring the customers standing in front of her. I proceeded to walk inside the restaurant where still no one notice my group, it was not until I walk to the bartender at the bar and asked for a table, did I finally get seated. In addition, my group waited at the table forever before anyone came to take our order. Once our food was out, all the employees disappeared into the kitchen or something. When we were done with our meal, I had to hunt down one of the workers to get the check.

I found crab corner through groupon and although the crab dish was plenty tasty, it still wasn't fulfilling. Fast forward a couple of months and thanks again through groupon, I found killer shrimp. The killer shrimp original (she'll on) was the best out of the 3 dishes I ordered. They have their own special broth where the shrimp swim in and although it's supposed to be very spicy (7 out of 10 level) after the 1st initial kick, the heatspice actually just goes to the back when eating the rest of the shrimp. Don't forget to sop your bread in the broth too, it's that tasty. The 2nd dish was the paella with risotto. Another tasty dish w/mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, sausage, onions and red bells. My only complaint was that some of the risotto was just a tad firm still, but like I said that's a very tiny complaint. The last dish we had was the cod beer battered fish n chips. The fries were skinny w/just the right amount of salt and the texture was perfectly crisp. The cod itself was just a little on the rubbery side, which would be my biggest complaint of the night. Oh yeah a plus for the habanero tartar sauce which wasn't spicy at all, just flavorful. Our server Twyla  was very friendly and helpful, especially with the menu's breakdown of the killer dishes. The manager came out to meet us briefly and then at the end of the dinner to take care of my groupon. If your looking for a new simple seafood place then please consider this.

Being a Hermosa Beach transplant, I was very excited to hear that Killer Shrimp was coming to Vegas. 
I had spent many a day/night (more than I want to admit) over the years hanging out with my friends, at their marina location.
Chillin outside, drinking and eating the best seafood in all of So Cal, with great service and most importantly, the overall feeling of it being our hang spot, was something we all truly enjoyed and looked forward to. 

So we rolled in for dinner at the new Town Square location with great anticipation!!
What a different vibe when we entered! Gone was the cool, comfortable, atmosphere we were so used to relaxing in for hours on end. 
It had been replaced by this dark, cold, empty feeling, imposter of a place that had no relationship to the roots of which it came.
I know we're in Vegas, but what does Jazz and Rat Pack paintings on the walls have anything to do with a beach establishment named Killer Shrimp?

The server Lisa rocked, which helped bring a little of that lost memory back, as we were all still in shock.
Most importantly...Thankfully the food had not changed a bit (at least they didn't screw with that). The Shrimp Bowl was everything I remember and missed so dearly and the apps were spot on. Drinks... Could have used half the ice, but we're great! 

Hopefully people will give this place a try for its food which is Awesome!! And maybe management will ""figure it out"" and do a little through back to what made them the coolest BEACH HANG in the South Bay!!

When we were sat we were next to the bar. The bartender actually was our waitress because that was her area as well. The hostess didn't ask if we wanted to sit at the bar even though we were that close & the bartender would have to serve us. Because of this the bartender had to make 2 drinks then run them to us, then do the same again. Not to mention she's running the bar for the whole place. Once drinks were served we ordered the lobster mac & cheese. There was nothing left of it minutes after it was served. SO GOOD!
For dinner I ordered the Blackened Salmon Fillet (Maple scented brown butter sweet potatoes and wilted spinach) & my buddy got the Killer Paella (Saffron rice, andouille sausage, chicken, clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp). My salmon was so tender & the seasonings popped once it landed on your tongue. Sadly my buddy was not a fan of the Killer Paella as the saffron is on EVERYTHING & it takes away from the dish.

The first thing we noticed were the oysters, literally half the size of last week. Next my lobster tail was also noticeably smaller, but here's the killer....  

The killer corn (which typically love) was completely different. I mentioned it to the food runner she brushed it off. I took a bite and decided that it tastes terrible. 

When our server came by, I said I didn't like it and it was wrong. She took it back to the kitchen. Later we found out that they decided to use a different cheese, but seriously, if it's good just leave it alone.

2284781,2016-05-09,2,0qPNeqLuKE88rKbIbSZDpg,"Wanted to check out this place since I saw it before it opened at Town Square. Was a little curious as to what it was going to be about. 

I'm still a bit unclear as to the whole motif but it is pretty much like the name gives away an American seafood spot. 

We started with raw oysters, which were quite fresh. Its served with a horseradish cream sauce which was new to me. We had asked for regular horseradish but was informed they don't have it. 

They have a signature dish shrimp in a spicy broth that's cooked for hours to ensure all the spices are mixed well together and have a real kick. Our server explained how a few customera before us said it was a 10 as far as spice so of course loving spicy anything..  I had to try it. Thw killer shrimp is served a few different ways (with rice, pasta, just the shrimp, with crab, etc) I got the killer shrimp with pasta. The shrimps were pretty large and I got to be honest the broth was pretty good, not a 10 on spice in my opinion more like a 7. If you don't like spicy foods, I would caution you to maybe stay away. Which in a way makes me wonder why have a signature dish that not everyone can eat, since not everyone likes spicy. 

The broth is served with French bread for dipping which is a nice touch since there is a lot of broth that shouldn't go to waste. The pasta part of the meal unfortunately was a disappointment. It was very bland and honestly flavorless, definitely just a carb filler. 

Definitely recommend the clam chowder. It really is one of the best chowders I've ever tasted and I am a lover of clam chowder soup. 

As for service, our initial impression wasn't very good. I was a bit reluctant because a few of the reviews I had read did say how bad the service was. They have a host stand outside but nobody was there. We waited a few minutes before walking inside and asking a busser who was walking by if we are suppose to seat ourselves. He said no and found someone to seat us. Not sure the point of the host stand. As for our server after a little bit we realized she was th only one on the floor. We did feel bad for her because she was running from table to table, inside and outside. Granted it wasn't super busy but when we counted there were 11 tables she was serving (all with 3 or more people). It was a weekday but it was also 7:30pm so you would think they would have more servers on. Who knows maybe it was an off night but for being alone, she did pretty good.

I've only been here during lunch. It's a spacious nicely decorated place with a huge bar right dab in the middle. It looks fully loaded so if I find more info about their drink specials and what not you'll be informed.

The food from what I've tried wasn't that great. On the 1st visit I had the Killer Shrimp Roll with some sweet potato fries for $12. The Killer Shrimp Roll was peppers, onions, aoili, and shrimp in a small French bread. I threw in a cup of clam chowder for $5. All together the $17 got me a real basic and not so filling meal than again I do usually eat a lot so maybe it might be filling for some. Honestly I wasnt wowed and I figured if I ordered something with their name in it it would be outstanding. It was far from that.

The 2nd visit I think I had the fish and chips. Honestly I dont remember it to much other than it being not that great also. Maybe that's why I haven't been back since.

I might give them another shot, maybe for their happy hours or dinner cause the rest of the food pics look good. Or maybe I just need some drinks in me first before eating. The rest of the menu looks appealing.

I did hear kids eat free on Tuesday nights. So that's cool for those looking to feed their kids.

The first indication something was wrong was there was no hostess at the desk in the front of the restaurant and it was quite slow for being prime dinner time (7:30ish). 

We proceeded to walk into the restaurant and asked the first person if we should seat ourselves. She said there was a short wait to be sat in the dining room or we were free to dine at the bar with immediate assistance.  We proceeded to the empty bar. 

We waited, waited, and waited for someone to even say hello - be right with you - anything to let us know we were seen. I could maybe understand if there was no one behind the bar and everyone was busy, but the bartender literally looked at us both multiple times and failed to say a word... At an empty bar!!  After waiting ten minutes and being deliberately ignored by the bartender, we decided to leave and have dinner at Brio.  Funny thing is the manager said goodbye to us on the way out... How could she be so blind.

This location doesn't have the cool, hip, welcoming atmosphere the Marina Del Rey location has - it will probably go down with the many other concepts that have tried that location in the past. No matter how good the food will ever be (which we didn't get to even try) it will never make up for rude, unattentive service.",09TLMTWynFwmHwcUl53ytg,9,0,1,eFJ1Hfu18emTViB9DRcC8Q

2806235,2015-12-14,0,0qPNeqLuKE88rKbIbSZDpg,"Honestly, I was excited to see one of my favourite restaurants come to Las Vegas.  I love the Marina Del Ray location so I had high hopes.  This is not a place you go when you want gourmet fancy this, fancy that or even highly creative anything. This is the place you come when you want hot steamy delicious goodness in a bowl that never lets you down.....until you have it in Vegas. I gave three stars because of its roots and hopefully the promise of it growing into the very large shoes it has to fill. 
In order to do that, some changes will need to be made in the service area. I don't know our servers name (and I should, right?) as she wasn't around much to check on us, fill our drinks, see how things were, if I might have liked a spoon....I never got. (This is a bowl of broth...no spoons came for us) She further ruined our experience with the food by being a horrible server in an almost empty establishment. I served for years through college and after. I know she was bad. I even got up to wonder around to find myself some salt. I needed salt because the broth was just bad. I was so disappointed. The shrimp, and I don't even know how this could happen, had no flavor. None. Neither did the pasta I ordered in it. Also, the shrimp were over cooked and shriveled up and rubbery. The bread was not good but not such a terrible thing since I didn't want to soak up the broth anyway. The bread in Marina Del Ray is soooo good.  But the broth was not up to par with the mother store. It was just spicy with oregano floating in it and no real flavor. I wanted it to be good so bad. It was not. I realize they have only been open five weeks, as the manager (?) kept repeating. I think she was the manager, she never said. But listen, are the first weeks not very important? Should you even open if you aren't ready? What about putting your best foot forward? No excuses. Just do it. She adjusted our bill by 25%.  Oh, we also ordered calamari. It has potential but was loaded with oil, like the fryer wasn't hot enough.  Most people don't know what to expect. If I was a newbie, I'd NEVER go back. But, I'm a faithful fan.....I will go back.....in a few months (to give them time to get it right) if they make it that long.",_ccnMRHkWbX7TfmtIh5k_w,1,0,3,v7v_IVTaS07SJQ0cHvi3QA

Toward the end I was watching as our server was cleaning and wipeing down walls and who knows what. Really! Your manager makes their food servers do cleaning work during their shift as they are serving food, wow, where is the health department on this one.
So food was pretty bland, we really looked forward to this meal, but for what I had the broth that the shrimp was is was okay but the shrimp was just bland with no taste.

The sauce that came with them was pretty nondescript but I found that they didn't really need any sauce...just a squeeze of lemon, and they were great!

The lobster mac and cheese was delicious, as well! It was soooo rich and creamy and cheesy with lots of lobster meat! 

The warm spinach salad was tasty, and they did not skimp on the ingredients...plenty of mushrooms and bacon...and the dressing was tasty, but there was way too much dressing on it, for our tastes. I would order it again, but ask them to go easy on the dressing next time. It was a good size salad...perfect for sharing before dinner!

    We did not repeat the same order, because some of the items we got before we just would not trust making the same mistake again, but this time we tried some new things and were very happy.  
   The first thing we did have again, which is simple is the kids Chicken Fingers, and our review last time was that they were under seasoned and just tasted bland... this time, excellent.  They were right on.
    My wife tried the Appetizer Spicy chicken Fingers, and they were awesome!!   Like a really flavorful boneless buffalo wing, but I think even better.

   I had the BBQ fish sandwich, and it was really great.   Fresh Avacado, Tomato, Lump Crab, Grilled Fish on a bun.  I was pleasantly surprised.

My older Kids shared the Coconut shrimp and loved them, and for the younger kids we did the chicken Fingers and split the appetiser popcorn shrimp and they loved both.   Popcorn Shrimp was a good size portion.

   The server and Manager were again top notch, very helpful and friendly, and I believe the owner even stopped over to say hi, which always feels like they care. 
     We were pleasantly surprised at this follow-up visit, and would now go back for sure.

The broth is decent, but the lobster was so hard to get out of its shell that I was worried when it finally came loose my arm would fly back and knock everyone's drinks off the table. The biggest let down was the bread. I was really looking forward to sopping up that broth with some nice crusty bread. What I got instead, was about as substantial as wonder bread. Good luck trying to sop up the broth with bread that turns instantly into liquid.",WBlYjZLVlduMWq7_C1-P7Q,0,0,2,thtQ83mkeYsFHZmJp-FwkA
3283444,2016-01-18,8,0qPNeqLuKE88rKbIbSZDpg,"Very disappointing experience at Killer Shrimp tonight. It literally took an HOUR AND A HALF from the time we sat down till the time we finally got and paid our check. The only things were got were chicken tacos, an order of sliders, and fries. And believe me, it burned to actually give them money. 

As mentioned above, the service is painfully slow. Nice wait staff, and plenty of them, but there were only 5 tables including ours, and they spent most of the time happily chatting with each other, as opposed to actually waiting on their tables. It took so long to get our food, I was about to ask if it was even coming. I thought the waitress had forgotten.

3 Tiny Chicken Tacos: dry, tough, overcooked, and unseasoned chicken, on a soft shell taco. Topped with a bit of onion and cilantro. It came with a green taco sauce that sadly also lacked flavor. Edible, but pushing it. $7

Beef Sliders: I keep telling my boyfriend that the word slider in Vegas mostly translates to overpriced, crappy mini burgers. He never listens. These definitely fall in the overpriced, crappy mini burgers category. Unseasoned ground beef slapped onto a mini bun, some cheap, flavorless cheese on top. Again, edible, but very disappointing to my male. $7

Killer Spicy Fries or whatever: These were actually really good, and a huge portion too. Great seasoning, a little spice, nice and crispy. Unfortunately, the lazy waitstaff were too busy talking to each other to bring these out. They were cold when we finally got them. The fries were the best part about our meal, but they would have been awesome if they were actually hot, or even warm. 

It took about 20 minutes to get our check, since our waitress was too busy chatting with a coworker.. Again.. That was just the icing on the crap cake. 

If you must go here, you should probably get what they are best known for, and skip the failure of a happy hour. It's held every day of the week, even on Saturday and Sunday, which would be great if the service and food didn't suck. 

The Killer Shrimp with bread dish looked REALLY good, but I doubt I'll be back to try it, based on the awful service alone. The other restaurants were packed, while Killer  Shrimp had only a few tables filled. Hopefully management catches the hint.

Update: I'm not sure what it was, but I've felt absolutely ill since I've eaten there. I only ate 3 chicken soft tacos and some fries, but I feel awful.",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,15,7,1,nL7gm4y1tgyDjuJRkirJcg

This time around.My husband tried to order 2 different beers and they were listed on the menu but out of them. Not off to a good start.  The shrimp cocktail my friend and I both ordered, came with 3 medium sized shrimp hanging over the martini glass and chopped up shrimp with salsa.  Too hot for both of us.  The bottom plate included overly fried wonton-ish chips.  It was okay.  My husband got coconut shrimp and fries, he said half were good and the others were chewy. They looked really dark and overcooked to me.  Our other friend had the shrimp pasta he said it was fine.  Because the service is still a little slow we didn't order dessert since we were trying to see a movie after.  It seems a bit understaffed?

We came to Killer Shrimp and had mixed emotions when walking in.
It's a huge open room....hardly any people sitting to eat....a little bit of art work on the walls and music too low for this big space.
We were nicely greeted and promptly sat and ordered drinks.
Unfortunately the bartender isn't that great (sorry but it's true) stick to wine and beer. We had Sugar Plum's .....Westsides.....margaritas....monitors.....Manhattans...we really tried! 
We even debated in leaving but really had our hearts set on trying the shrimp.
For starters we had a beach house salad, grilled Caesar and clam chowder.....grilled Caesar was awesome but chowder was a little bland nothing a little salt and pepper didn't fix!
Entrees.... killer shrimp bowls....paella.... Fishermans stew....steamed clams.
I'm a fan of the killer shrimp peeled bowl...a little too spicy for me but still great. Only suggestion is to bring out grilled bread and not just plain bread. Shrimp were a great size and plentiful.
Kids meals were good too....my kid finished their shrimp and chicken fingers....and the fries are good. Fresh and hand cut!!! 
All in all it was a great meal and we will return.
Please work on those bar skills....but thank goodness for beer and wine.",6gLAjpSE6Cw092SGqZliNg,3,2,4,6i409zbNaYsizpbP-Gv8zA

By no means should this be compared to Hot N Juicy or Boiling Crab.  It's a difference style of cooking.  

It's pretty much shrimp in a bowl of spicy goodness with a side of bread to dip.  I went with a spicy level of medium, and it ended up being really spicy!  Shell on shrimp is the best.  The Killer Shrimp bowls are generous portions.

I ordered the Killer Shrimp Pasta(without spice) and the bar drink was the Shrimp Killa. The pasta was supposed to be garlicky, but it was sooooo NOT. I told the server and she went to the back to see what she could do to fix it, she brought me back some fresh chopped garlic; I took it and mixed it in with my pasta and made it taste better.

Instead it fell flat on it's face. The killer shrimp was a huge let down. The shrimp itself was an average size but the sauce it comes with was nothing more than spicy water. It's a shame that it's considered the leading item on the menu since it lacks any sort of flavor. I also tried a piece of my friend's fish. It was not what I expected from a seafood restaurant...dry and not much else going for the dish but the fries.

The service was great but if your going to have Lobster Ravioli on your menu and your a new restaurant trying to gain customers you shouldn't be telling customers you are out of it on a FRIDAY night here in Vegas.I ordered the Killer Shrimp in a bowl with Rice and after 4 bites my mouth was on fire and I was sweating so if your not into spicy food this dish would not be for you. I ordered the lobster ravioli and I tasted quite a bit of onions and I showed the server and tried telling me there is no onions in there but I showed her a white small piece that was and all she could say was it can't be onion.I can't say I am impressed with this place as it needs a lot of work.,4X8lCiza6p1FS5pZ12jv-w,2,0,2,goLt3pEkrUOa0IN8tWRfYQ

For me the welcome is important, and this one did not miss the mark. We choose to sit a the bar, good decision. The bartender cum server was awesome, when she realized we were first timers she immediately bought us up to speed with the history of the place and their signatures dishes. 
ON her recommendation we choose their signature dish - the Killer Shrimp original - a spicy shrimp stew with half lbs of shrimps. It does not look great, but right from the first bite we could not stop. Its awesome, kind of stew you would expect in Thai restaurant - spicy n addictive. 
During our meal, the manager Alisha stop by to check on us. It was another education on the concept and Alisha recommended the dessert. Potato Pecan Pie. A knock out dessert.

As I walked up, I didn't know if they were open because it was lifeless inside. I open the door and the cool vibe of a lounge surrounded me. The music is high enough to know the song, but low enough that you don't have to yell over it.

Although the hostess told us, on a rainy and slow night, that we would still need to wait 15 minutes for a 2-top, we sat at the bar and were granted a table, waited on by the friendly bartender, because she disagreed with the hostess. Not sure if that caused problems in their rotations but we thought it was nice. Bartender was an attentive and helpful server. 

Food, on the other hand, wasn't impressive. As first timers, we opted for the stars of the menu and got the killer shrimp and lobster as well as lobster Mac. I added a side of garlic mash to go with the soupy bowl. Everything lacked salt, BIG TIME. The shrimp bowl was not ""killer."" It was definitely seasoned, but not correctly. There was recognizable dried thyme floating around and you tasted that but nothing else really. I was not impressed by what should have been the best thing on the menu and, for over $20, was really lacking shrimp quantity. The lobster Mac, again, little flavor but brimming with tail meat and gooey cheese; a plus, kind of. There was more lobster in that than there was in the lobster & killer shrimp bowl we ordered! The garlic mash was not garlicky at all. The potatoes were very light in texture, a bit over-processed, and hopefully not instant. Would NOT order again. The winner of the meal was the sweet potato pecan pie, hands down. 

I would visit Killer Shrimp again, but not order what I did and probably not give their famous killer shrimp a second chance. Upsetting....",Ey_-5w0btBMtkn4zH4SzNQ,1,1,3,GzMSQXkmcxv5o_Ug2qjvBQ

That was over 20 years ago and to either of the original 2 spots in Los Angeles.  I was heart broken when they closed and beyond happy when it reopened.  However, no matter what they say,  the recipe is not the same.  It's been tweaked and not necessarily for the better.  Now is good enough for me to remember how good it used to be but not good enough, hence only 4 stars. The Original is a bowl of tasty, somewhat spicy broth you eat by dunking slices of French bread. A the broth level goes down,  a pound of shrimp is slowly revealed.  The Original coves with shell on shrimp.  There is an option to have it with the shuttle previously shelled, as well as having either rice or pasta adeed into the broth as well. I only recommend The Original,  but mostly because it's an experience too peel the shrimp with your fingers. Wash your hands twice,  use the bibb,  ask for extra napkins and get to pinching tails and...well,  you know how is said shrimp are best eaten. The clam chowder is good to,  but i can't vouch for any of the other dishes on the menu.

We ordered the following:

Fried calamari - the breading is too much. It wasnt that good plus it came out after our entree. Our server comped it though (without us asking) so that was really nice of her. 

Fisherman's Stew - the broth is very spicy but it had a lot of seafood on it. I wished it wasnt too spicy for me so I could have finished it.

Items tried:
- Killer shrimp
- Clam chowder
- Calamari

Our server was super nice and helpful. She recommended the killer shrimp, their signature dish, since it was our first time there. When the dish came out, it wasn't much to gawk over, but my tastebuds thought otherwise. The broth was so good! Loved the spice and the herbs. Dipping the bread in the broth was the best part. So addicting! Save time and avoid smelly fingers. Order your Killer Shrimp ""shelled"" for a peeled version. 

During happy hour the clam chowder is $5.  I can be a clam chowder snob, since I grew up in the bay area. There's nothing better than clam chowder in SF or Monterey at the pier. Not really comparable, but Killer Shrimp makes a really good version! I love the chunkiness of the chowder with all the clams, potatoes, and veggies. Save some bread to dip in your chowder too! 

The calamari ($6 HH) was easily forgettable. If in Townsquare, I prefer Brio or Fleming's calamari.",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,11,11,4,hyZcWnA4LIoiI8yhYDlojg

We went on Sunday afternoon and the place was eerily empty, 3 other tables occupied, no hostess present to greet us, so we walked inside, feeling confused...maybe we seat ourselves. We stood for a few minutes until someone came out from the back, apologized, and got us to our table.
I pretty much knew what I was getting, I studied the menu for days. My poor husband doesn't like seafood so he had few options we knew wouldn't be anything to write home about but he would endure for me.
Neither of us got drinks, just beer and water.
I got the Killer Shrimp, Crab and Lobster. It comes with bread for dipping in the sauce. The sauce had a peppery spice, it was good but it overwhelmed the seafood. The seafood was cooked nicely, plenty to eat with a few corn cobs (34$).
My husband got The Filet done medium with mashed, it came with a demi glaze over the steak. It was a small portion, he said it was better than expected but nothing special.
We skipped dessert.
Our waitress was nice and gave us adequate service.
More tables filled as our meal progressed.

No one here, but was taken to the far wall of booths, we'd asked for one. Our server came up to get our drinks, intoduced herself and gave a very brief account of 'their concept'. I heard shrimp, spicy and bread for dipping. We ordered an original killer shrimp bowl, about a dozen decent size shrimp, peel still on, swimming in a big bowl of tasty broth and spices but not much of a kick as far as spice goes. 

The bread for dipping in the tangy broth was freash, soft, not toasted baget loaf sliced into small bits good for dipping, but would be better as toasted and warm, just my opinion.

We ordered my bowl of clam chowder and it came out late, we ordered both shrimp and the chowder at same time but they forgot it. It finally came out once she realized we still hadn't gotten it. It was thick, a lot of clams, bits of carrot, potato, celery and was very good. I used some of the baget to dip it!

We also ordered the steam muscles, clear tomato broth, plenty of them and juicy good, the warm spinach salad, plenty big to share, bits of mushroom, egg, bacon and blue cheese crmble but a bit dry, could have used more of the vinaigrette dressing. And the paella, plenty of mixed seafood, steaming hot and seasoned well. 

They seemed to be over staffed with assistants/ busers and not enough servers, ours was waiting tables all over the place and she didn't make it by often enough to see how we were doing.  She missed our dessert order because she took too long checking in on us!  

We got plenty of tea refills, extra bread, they cleared away the dirty stuff, but waiting over 20 minutes just for her to come back to us after we'd finished our food meant she was too busy to care about our dinning experience.

I'll get the 2 positives out of the way... the staff was friendly and I like the overall atmosphere of the place.

Unfortunately the negative list is much much longer but I'll try and keep it brief.

First red flag was that the place was totally empty about 4:30 pm.  Just 1 couple at the bar.

Ordered a soda and water and the water itself was probably the worst tasting water I have ever had in my life.  In fairness I've never been to Rio or Flint... but it was really really bad.  This concerned me since this very well could be the water they use for cooking.  

Clam Chowder was more of a corn chowder.  They don't have crackers but offered to bring croutons instead.  But not very good at all.  Little did I know that would be the highlight of our meal.

Ordered fish tacos which had no taste whatsover.  If I didn't know what I ordered... I would have had no clue.  It was pure mush battered and fried with tasteless slaw and sauce.  I didn't even bother eating the second one... and I'm fat and rarely don't finish meals.

Wife ordered killer shrimp which was over priced and the sauce was bland.  Guess we were expecting something with flavor or some kick and it had neither.  Served with some bread which just tasted old... it wasn't hard... just tasted old.... if they bake it there... perhaps the water made it taste funny.  Decided we would try some butter since my daughter wanted bread.  The butter was grainy and sort of had a faintly buttered grits type taste and texture  I don't know how else to describe it... I mean there is no reason that I should be critiquing butter right?  But they gave me no choice b/c it was so odd and gross.  Also.. the portion size was 1/2 pound of shrimp with shell on for $17 which seems awfully high... especially when sauce was weak.  I believe Hot & Juicy Crawfish is much better and quite a bit less expensive if I recall...

Had calamari which wasn't terrible.... but had some breading issues.  Fell off and no taste.  The dipping sauces weren't very good and the cocktail sauce tasted very cheap and watery.  

Kids meal was chicken fingers and the batter just crumbled off the super dry and overcooked chicken.  (The breading seemed quite different than the calamari but they managed to mess up both)  Fries weren't bad... but even the ketchup taste weird.  I actually joked about trying the ketchup just to see if it tasted wierd too and I was shocked to find that it did in fact taste weird.  

At this point I'm questioning if I am sick where everything tastes funny but unfortunately for Killer Shrimp... I'm as healthy as can be.

Wrapped up our meal and debated on whether to complain or not... but what can u say when everything was bad.  How could they even make it right without just refunding the whole meal knowing there was no chance we would ever come back... so we chalked it up as a loss and moved on.  

Bus boy came to our table as we were just beginning to wrap things up.  Seemed to be urgently trying to clean the table and be in our way as we were finishing our drinks and packing up the 2 kids.  I guess they desperately needed our table since they now had 3 tables occupied so it was necessary to rush us off.  

One last thing that was odd.... the straws for the sodas were literally the same height as the glass.... so that made drinking a little more interesting... luckily I have big lips and could reach the miniature straw.

The menu also doesn't have any pictures... not that this is always a big deal... but I would think that a place like this would benefit by showing a few of their dishes since you don't see places like this everyday and should be easy to make the dishes look appealing in pictures anyways.  Seems very poorly run and won't be surprised when it is gone in 6 months.  Very disappointing.",mmAcpelY5OdTLgwjDDB6Lw,1,0,1,uegPq0ObnxfZiwiEimdLYQ
5619766,2016-08-07,0,0qPNeqLuKE88rKbIbSZDpg,"My brother wanted to eat here for his birthday. We went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't packed at all. I had never heard of this place, but I would come back again. My sister and I shared their clam chowder, lobster mac and cheese, and their Guinness bread pudding dessert. 

The clam chowder had CHUNKS of clam in every bite. Many places (even those known for they're clam chowder) are sparse with their clam. It was a bit creamier than I've had, but overall, I'd come back for more. The lobster mac, on the other hand, was very cheesy and they used shelled macaroni, but the lobster wasn't as abundant as I would have liked, but the mac itself was delicious. 
The Guinness bread pudding with ice cream was ON POINT. The bread wasn't so sweet, which contrasted so well with the ice cream. I'd come back just for this dessert. They allowed my brother to pick his own dessert and he got it for free for his birthday. He chose the apple cobbler, which was a little too sweet for our tastes.

We were served by Angela, who noticed our bill hit the $50+ mark and so wonderfully notified us of a Groupon that was currently available at this time, so we were able use it for our dinner. I recommend you give them a try!",gZfng_kIkGA3a3IXguwaMw,2,1,5,syr7bxTcpjbK_s-0_jChZA

A table should never have to be sitting with a credit card in hand staring into space for 10 minutes before anyone notices they are ready to leave. The food was mediocre. The coconut shrimp were all breading and soggy. The fried cod was tasteless. The fancy drinks were completely watered down. We left a table full of food and $75 at this place.

Called the the number for Las Vegas. Put in a good sized order. Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Crab Stuffed Shrimp, 2 orders of Mini Crab Cakes, Popcorn Shrimp, Baja Shrimp Tacos, and Asparagus. The lady who took my order read it back to me and my cousin while on speaker phone and gave me a $132 or so total. Tells me 30 mins. I make it there in 45 mins. When I walk in there is No order, the confusion the staff showed and the manager showed felt like a bad act. I was fist asked if I called the correct restaurant meaning I called some place that was next to them in town square, then I was asked if I called the Vegas store, which I then told them the number we called, then was asked if I had the name of who I talked too. Who ever gets the name of the person who takes the order. Usually they take your name for the order. But sadly there was zero communication. I called the restaurant like I have in the past. I see all the bad reviews here now and I total get it. Sorry won't be coming back. And now I am going to Crab Corner. Man I drove all the way to town square trying to be a good patron of the establishment only to have some one working there totally forget to put in the order. I am sure I spoke to one of the guilty person involved but in this day and age this is just proof of more laziness and lies.",5S_fm-hGzL9-3LQlt4mKEA,0,0,1,19Z_UF_w4Q-yO6JUhQ21dg

You may have a great experience like myself and my family. But everyone's opinion and experience is different so here's mine! I came in with my family (husband & 2 kids) Genesis was our server, she was very informative & seems to enjoy working here. She had answers to all my questions and made great suggestions. I took her advice and ordered the passion killer, which was amazing might I add! We also ordered calamari to start. It could have been fried a bit more but I'd definitely order it again. My kids ordered Mac&cheese and fried shrimp for dinner and my husband and I ordered the blackened salmon and the killer shrimp. My kids ate every bite, as did we! The salmon was spectacular! I also had a bite of my husbands killer shrimp, it's a little on the spicy side so beware! But very good! I will definitely be back. Service was amazing as well as the food!

5727284,2016-01-04,0,0qPNeqLuKE88rKbIbSZDpg,"Took the husband here for a date night last night.  Upon arrival, we were greeted, but had to wait an extensive amount of time to be seated as the hostess was stationed outside with her menus and seating chart, while it was about 40 degrees out.  We waited patiently and were seated within about 10 minutes. The only problem with this is that there was no one in front of us!  

We were served our drinks, a house specialty cocktail and a ginger ale.  The ginger ale was terrible, tasted like Sprite and a shot of Coke, and was replaced promptly!  The appetizer of lobster Mac and cheese was phenomenal...absolutely amazing!!  We thoroughly enjoyed the dish and will have it again.  

I ordered the signature dish of killer shrimp and my husband ordered the jumbo crab cake dinner. Upon arrival, my dish was abundant while my husband received 2 small crab cakes.  He made a quick joke about the size of the cakes which prompted a quick response from our server.  She immediately told management, who then sent our server back to let us know that we  would be receiving another meal on the house.  The incident was handled seamlessly and quietly.  We continued to eat our meal and his additional crab cakes showed up within a few minutes. 

Kudos to the staff and management for handling this so quickly.  We are impressed with your customer service and will be back for sure!!",0x60ubRSL_aTXS4RirMDsw,1,1,4,5GLDJc7cRqJsq3MhdOZZqA

5816263,2016-01-05,0,0qPNeqLuKE88rKbIbSZDpg,"this place confounded me a bit.  We stopped in during a weeknight, but passed up several other venues which were packed or had a wait.  This place was pretty empty.  maybe 6 tables, with about 4 people at the bar.  This place is a very large space, so it felt strange.

Similar to others, we experienced some weirdness with the wait staff.  it took a bit for someone to come to the table, but once it was sorted out, she was very attentive and personable.  Think it was more of a management thing than anything.

Food was solid, but not over the top.  got the signature killer shrimp dish and it was very tasty.  Bread was a bit dense for my liking, and didn't really have flavor by itself.  Not likely to be back in this area anytime soon, but if someone wanted to go, I would certainly join them.  However, I don't know how they will continue to stay open with such little traffic.

After reading the regular and happy hour menus I decided to order the two varieties of tacos on the HH menu and the ""Killer Shrimp"" the namesake dish (peeled) to be split between me and my three friends. The tacos were meh, and the signature dish was horrible. It tasted like it looks in the picture, and with a strong aftertaste of chiles and chlorine. Yes, chlorine. We sent the dish back and they asked us if we wanted them to remake it. Their menu says the sauce has been simmering for an extensive amount of time (like 10 hours or the like) and if it tasted horrible the first time then... We opted for a bowl of the clam chowder instead and that was probably the best thing I put in my mouth. Their HH white wine was actually a Rose' that gave me a headache for two days.

FYI it is spicy so if you don't like spice don't go here or don't get the killer shrimp. I really like the Killer Shrimp with Rice the best. The pasta is okay but much better with rice. It comes with at least 10 large shrimps and amazing slices of bread for dipping. It's about $18 a plate but there's a Groupon out right now that can be taken advantage of to save some money! Also the Civiche is so delicious! It's very tart and has a lot of cilantro and lime. It comes with mini size tortilla chips.
