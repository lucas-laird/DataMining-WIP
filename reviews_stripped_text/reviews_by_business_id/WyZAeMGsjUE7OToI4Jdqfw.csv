The company is very respectful and practice their Food with Integrity motto. I think it is great to see a restaurant care as much about the source of their product as they do about what goes into their pocket. Many other companies should take note. 
The steak, chicken, pork and barbacoa are incredible. All slow cooked to perfection, the flavor profile of every ingredient that goes into each meal is compromised. 
I normally order the bowl here which i order with rice, black beans, med salsa, corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and guacamole. Yuuummm...
So good and always enough left over for late night snacking. The chips here are fresh and perfectly salted and the salsas are full of flavor.

The first two girls pushed us along, my son was trying to ask her a question she just blew him off. He is eight years old. Not like he is a toddler running amuck. He order a kids # 4 which is a build your own tacos. We under stand that it only came with two sides. When he asked if he could have some lettuce she told him NO. That it would be an extra charge for for that. Are you kidding me for lettuce on a kids taco. I couldn't believe it. Especially after I just paid 2.00 for a skimpy side of guacamole for his taco. something restaurants should make a point of to their employees is that customers only go out maybe once a month or twice now, not like 5 years ago when it was 3 times so when it comes to making a choice where to go before they leave the house they think hmm..well last time I went there this or that happened, something as simple as they didn't even say goodbye or thank us as we were leaving and we tipped.

I ordered a chicken bowl and the cashier rung me up for a double chicken with extra guac. I didn't pay for it because it was wrong and refused until she fixed it.

Chipotle hit the spot for me and my girlfriend. Had a long day at work and we both wanted a quick dinner, nothing fastfood nor fancy! 

As a first time customer, I didn't realize its kind of like Subway, by telling the employees what u exactly want. Just more Gourmet! 
I ordered the chicken soft tacos which comes with 3! The guy asked me whether I wanted flour or corn taco...? Umm what? Lol. I didn't realize they offered that. I said regular, whatever that meant! Haha. Next, you can actually mix n' match with chicken, steak, or barbacoa (shredded beef). I had to try at least one that's different. Got 2 chicken tacos and 1 barbacoa. I added salsa, corn, blackbeans,  guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce! I must say it was muy delicioso!! The quality and freshness made this a healthy treat!

1162059,2010-11-17,0,WyZAeMGsjUE7OToI4Jdqfw,"Okay, I've been here twice now since learning from their website about the Chipotle commitment to ""Food with Integrity.""  What does that mean?  It means, among other things, that 100% of the chickens they use are raised without the use of antibiotics.  100% of their pork comes from naturally raised pigs that are fed a vegetarian diet and never given antibiotics.  And 85% of their beef comes from naturally raised cattle (only because the supply presently cannot meet the demand).  

All this time, Chipotle was right under my nose and I'd been snubbing it because I assumed their food had no more integrity that Taco Bell's.  

Now I've been this location twice within the last week.  The first time I got  a barbacoa burrito bowl with black beans and rice.  The second time I got the same thing with the chicken instead of the barbacoa.  Both times I was really hungry and could only eat about half of the meal in one sitting.  So I got two meals out of it for a reasonable price.  Both times, the food was delicious and I felt like I was eating a healthy, nutritious meal.  

I also got, both times, the tortilla chips with guacamole.  Their tortilla chips are made fresh and have a really great, subtle lime flavor.   The guacamole is also made fresh.

This location is clean and well-maintained, and I have had no problems with the employees here.  They have been helpful and friendly.  From now on, Chipotle is going to be a regular stop when I want a quick, delicious, healthy and hearty meal.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,4,spNUniU_qcRtXdOBiHbR4g

I ordered it at 12:45 and it said pick-up would be ready at 1:15 so I arrived at 1:10. Not only was the burrito COLD but, it wasn't even what I ordered!

My online order:
****Barbacoa Burrito ($9.15) Brown Rice, Black Beans, Barbacoa, Fresh Tomato Salsa, Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole****

What they gave me:
****STEAK Burrito with WHITE RICE and BLACK BEANS**** that is it....

Can someone please explain how this is acceptable? It was also cold which means they must have made it within 3 minutes and it was sitting there the entire time. Now here is what really makes me mad. I don't eat steak, not by choice, I just can't because when I eat red meat it makes me sick like food poisoning sick so the fact that they put steak in my burrito just crossed the line. What a waste of time and money spent. 

Also, that $2 soda I paid for was DISGUSTING which I should have known after I placed my cup under the ""Coke Zero"" only to find out it was flat Sprite, probably should have tasted the ""regular Coke"" before leaving the location but I was hungry and just wanted to get back home to finish my lunch and then get back to work.

I honestly will never be stepping inside any chipotle ever again after this experience. This totally makes me laugh at those who want minimum wage to be $15 a hour when they can't even do a simple job right. So disappointed.",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,3,2,1,7wIsHe_7rn0e1z8KIn087Q

2001382,2016-10-17,0,WyZAeMGsjUE7OToI4Jdqfw,"One of the better chipotles in Vegas. Every time I walk in I am immediately greeted by their friendly staff and they are always full of energy. They're always working hard and never goofing around. I get my usual chicken bowl with brown rice, lettuce, hot sauce, and black beans. I avoid sour cream and cheese due to my diet. I never had a problem with anything being undercooked nor have I ever got sick from the food.

If you're new to chipotle then here's how it works. You get to pick between a bowl (which is a burrito without the wrap), burrito, enchiladas, and other items on the menu such as a kids meal. You pick between white or brown rice, your usual shredded lettuce, and fajitas. They have a good amount of meat which include chicken, steak, shredded pork, and one more thing I can't seem to remember. At last the sauces! You have hot, medium, and mild. You also can add guac for extra $$, sour cream, corn, and cheese. Something I would get if diet wasn't a concern would definitely be a burrito with white rice, lettuce, chicken, hot sauce, sour cream, and cheese. 

SOME locations are really greedy with the meat. Some barely give you a scoop while others like this one gives a good amount.

The big thing here is that they pretty much use free-range everything.   I know it sounds silly, but there was an article in some business magazine a few months ago that basically wrote about how their meats taste better due to this shift.  And they do!  Also, if you've never been to this chain, they make pretty much everything from the meats to the guac fresh.  I've actually had to wait on guac to be made before at another chain.

I truly hate this bathroom's must be clean.

This location's our new go-to since moving into the area, last March (we go to two other locations (Fort Apache/ Trop & Arroyo) but this is the most frequented out of the three). This one doesn't seem so busy, but we usually get here at lunch time. This one is pretty clean (and so is the bathroom). 

The shape is like a backwards letter L, with the left front of it being the food prep and checkout line. Next to that area is the fountain drink machine, the napkins, the sauces, the forks, and the straws. The seating majority is small tables along the right side of the restaurant. (There is one large table as you walk in.) No outside seating. The bathroom is located at the far back left of the restaurant.

The food is always good. We (my son and I) split the bowl- regular rice, meat, fajita veggies, black beans, corn, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce (I love the salsa but it is too spicy for my son), but the picky eater doesn't like onions, so I eat them. Sometimes we get chicken, sometimes we get steak. I love the barbacoa but sometimes it is too wet and can be fatty. (I really miss the chorizo, that was my absolute favorite.) Hubby gets a burrito. Chipotle is a weekend staple for our family. The service is always good. Friendly and fast, that's a plus. Always a good experience here.

I like how it is pretty reasonably priced, given the huge size of the burritos. 
I like how the paper napkins have personalities and little quotes. I like how they keep the line moving, and pretty much call to attention the jack asses standing in front of you with their mouths open as they peer with squinty eyes with the ""I just can't decide"" face. There are like, 6 things on the menu. Come ON, people! I like how if you are a vegan or a veggie, you can still eat here and not want to slit your wrists.

super weird, i really liked this location until today 

basically went in and asked for a bowl with only beans and rice like i've done so many times before (i get only beans and rice because it is cheap and actually tastes good by itself) when i asked the lady she started to fill my bowl up to the top with beans and rice, now they are supposed to charge by the scoop but most of the time the workers understand that your only getting beans and rice and it doesn't effect them if they give 2 or so scoops of each and charge for 1 each, well when i got to the front there was a manager there and she asked how many scoops were in my bowl and the lady that scooped it said 4 but i did not ask for 4 so i was only trying to pay for what i asked for witch was only beans and rice so the manager threw away the bowl filled with rice and beans and made the lady scoop me only 1 of each 

like instead of giving me the food and telling the lady later that you only are supposed to give 1 scoop each you would rather throw the food away, that's pretty insane but then again who isn't now a days, just another reason why i have no faith or hope for the future

After she tells the staff member that she wants a burrito and the tacos, she then preceded to phone a friend. Apparently neither herself or her friend had ever been to Chipotle before because she went on to list and describe every item offered to her friend on the phone. The staff was so wonderful though, trying to be nice to her. This woman just kept talking and would not get off the phone. They mentioned to her several times that they needed to keep the line moving but the woman didn't seem to care, she continued her phone discussion on whether or not her friend wanted sour cream.

I'll make it simple. 
1. Something  was added to guacamole.  It had a distinct flavor. It had a lot of blackness in it.  Which means that they didn't take the time to pick it out. Not even for presentation.  The color was different as well.

3. Rice was uncooked. It almost felt that they mixed a raw batch with a cooked batch.

The quality of service can vary drastically. Some employees have no problem being generous with toppings. Others can be downright snarly. Overall, however, when I am at a loss for what to eat and need a quick, reasonable healthy bite nearby, Chipotle will do just fine as long as I get my guac!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,18,14,4,ZjVfMZcMP9AjXdcGQVx6-A

In terms of customer service this particular location is horrible!  Huge negative attitudes by most of the employees. When they are running low on any ingredient especially guacamole, I would wait until they replenish the supply or they will clearly skimp. When I called the AA lady with the nose ring out, she was an absolute bitch. I grabbed a card for David, and one for Zena, when I called to discuss what transpired they did not even answer the phone.

One just opened up on the corner of West Sahara and Fort Apache, where the old Blockbuster used to sit. Today is opening day and how can I resist a visit? I swing by around 8:30 after work to find a line around 10 people deep. There are a few tables being used by patrons but mostly people are ordering to go. The inside looks like every other Chipotle. Granted it was super clean since today was the grand opening.

I ordered the Chicken burrito ($5.85) and a Barbacoa Burrito ($6.10) for a friend. The line process did take a little bit since the employees were new. Give them a week or two to get a feel for it and then the lines will probably fly faster. 

The food is pretty consistent to every other Chipotle. What can you say? Its a chain restaurant! I'm definitely still a fan of Roberto's but I can see myself dropping by here once in a while.",0ObIfSgndeeR_kGlo1S7Ww,6,6,4,hrM6QlNuw_hBUXqtFpmWWQ

5416510,2011-02-07,0,WyZAeMGsjUE7OToI4Jdqfw,"This place allows you to select how you want it. You can have it as a burrito, or a bowl, tacos that are soft or hard, and even a salad. This place is great for a light, quick, simple meal that you know will be as natural as you can get it. And if you are watching carbs, this place can be a nice option. 

Today I had the Carne asada burrito. I wasn't watching carbs this week, so I enjoyed the big stuffed burrito with extra chips and salsa. It comes with rice, your choice of beans, (I like black beans), you choose your meat, I got the carne asada, it's usually tender and seasoned well. I like the mild salsa, reminds me of pico de gallo, then I add the cheese and sour cream. That's a pretty big burrito!

What I like about this place is its commitment to quality, their products are natural and fresh and I know that eating hear makes me feel more healthy! (even if the burrito has way too many calories).",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,g6M6DTu6onf4jOYz7VUflg
5516436,2012-05-06,1,WyZAeMGsjUE7OToI4Jdqfw,"I love Chipotle. I know it's a chain and all, but they do what they do so well! In Northeast Ohio, where I'm from, the line will stretch out the door and around the corner.  Not so here in the Southwest, but that's to be expected, as there are more Mexican restaurants (pseudo and authentic) to choose from.

The fresh, organic ingredients at Chipotle are a real draw for me. But I admit, this is a ""gateway ""restaurant; when I'm falling off the raw/vegan/whole foods wagon, I come here because they serve fresh, organic, whole foods- so how bad can it be? But honestly, it's a slippery slope from here.  

What I love about Chipotle is that their chips taste fresh, their guacamole is the best of all the chain restaurant guacamoles I've tried so far, and they season their foods nicely so that everything is very flavorful. I feel like I'm getting a good deal for my $8. Their menu is small, but that's fine- a bigger menu may cause them to slack off on the quality. Can't have that!!  

I always get the Burrito Bol. It even tastes good the next day- just get the guacamole and sour cream on the side.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,1,1,4,38tGGSyE-Ok-JYJyPdaomQ
5520582,2010-06-14,1,WyZAeMGsjUE7OToI4Jdqfw,"My very first Chipotle experience!
The place itself was very nice, and clean.  Their burritos, and guacamole are delicious!  Unfortunately, it was somewhat difficult to communicate our order to the employees.  For example, we would ask for cheese on our burrito, and the employee would nod, and not put it on.  Speaking to them in Spanish didn't seem to help either, so it might have just been very loud on their side of the counter.  
Also, it's a bit pricey for the kind of food that it is.  We had a buy one, get one free coupon, but I don't think I'd go often at regular price.

I would have given Chipotle a higher rating, but while finishing the last half of my burrito, I bit into the biggest piece of chewy, veiny... cartilage? Ew.  The burrito was awesome, but that seriously turned me off.   :(
Since I've never had weird chicken parts in my food at Zaba's, I'm pretty sure I'll just keep going there.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,1,0,2,Ks4Hfuhy-M4QBlG8XWh8lg

We've been here several times. Yesterday was our most recent visit. There was only one person in line ahead of us, but they were slow helping her and afterwards, filled a to go order that had been faxed in with 4 meals rather than offering to help us. When they finally got to us, they asked my boyfriend and I each twice what we wanted because they didn't listen the first time. When my boyfriend ordered the girl asked which salsa he wanted he told her, she then ignored him, filled 2 to-go salsas for another order, then paused, and re-asked him again which salsa he wanted. It was so obnoxious. He told her to go light on the sour cream, she again ignored him and piled it on. He was pretty pissed and told her, but we didn't want to wait for her to remake the whole meal so he just scooped it off when we sat down.

As for the food, it's good. One of the things we love about Chipotle is the consistency in taste and quality. We love their burrito bowls and their tacos. Yum!",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,2,0,3,N6Zm6w8zH6WQDoSj2XpmIQ

But another lady wad upset because we both had the same problem about them not having a certain item. The lady who was going to help us went to the back and was talking to the other employees. All we could hear was laughing. She was leaning over talking to one of the guys. She came back. The lady and I asked her if they are making guacamole. She said ""oh! I'm so sorry. I forgot."" The lady next to me said f* it and walked out. I was furious as well but I was also hungry.

Another time I went there. This older Mexican lady was making my significant other and I our burrito. When we asked her what we want. She would put a very small amount in the burrito. We both looked at each other and asked her to add a little more. Then she rolled her eyes. My significant other and I was shocked. Later that day. We called and complained on how rude and unprofessional she was. There was a second time she did the same thing. We told to but a little more. She would reply: ""that is going to be extra"". I was livid that she was being that way. Usually when we see her. We usually drive away because we don't want to deal with that bs. Went haven't went back.

Just today, as my significant other and I got off work. We decided hopefully something might change. Maybe they might possibly cleaned up there act. He went inside and place an order for our burrito. He asked for guacamole on the side. They told him that they didn't have any. But they are going to make some right at the moment. He asked how long would it take? They told him 10 minutes. Other 2 people where waiting for the same thing. One of the workers on the line yells that they need guacamole. Him and the other people that were waiting heard laughing and being rude. They were all giving them the stink eye. My significant felt really offended that how sh**ty these people were being. 20 minutes went by and they came out with the guacamole and filled the cup almost full. To top it off, the lady named Brooke was frustrated and was giving him attitude. He came back really pissed off and told me the whole story about his experience. Once again, it was shocking to hear him explain on what just happened.",8BOdwgSHMx8PTACfRILyXg,1,1,1,DlP6BqB5F3sws1hKRuGygw

Btw, rice does not belong in a burrito.  Especially in this case since it is pure filler.  They use around 3 ounces of actual meat in their burritos I'm estimating.  Their salsas suck and the hot-sauces are canned and I hate the fake branding,  So twee and cool and hip and unoriginal and appealing... to teen-agers.  I have a teen-aged daughter.  She loves Chipotle.  I've noticed that the more she loves something the worse it is.  There you have it...

Since I had already made my requests with the first girl it was a little annoying that she required me to reiterate my order with her. She misheard me and ended up putting the wrong proteins in my order. When I told her about the mistake she seemed annoyed and then the whole line got discombobulated as they had to redo my order and couldn't figure out how to expedite that while handling all the orders behind me. 

Once they got everything back on track things went smoothly but I was a little perturbed about her attitude.
