After dining, we go for shopping inside the grocery where my wife felt an upset stomach and spent most of her time at the bathroom. And felt uncomfortable the whole night through. Not a good experience eating in a Filipino Restaurant inside the Seafood City in Las Vegas.

The next day i tried calling them I was transferred to four people. All of them had no clue what I was asking and its a simple product (especially since its a seafood place). Finally I gave up and asked if they have it and how much and they stated its against their policy to give out prices over the phone.

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. All the standards are there, from fresh-ish produce, to aisles of noodles and fish sauce. And the seafood department always has the fish you want--with the heads still on--at really good prices. Drop them off at the counter if you want them cleaned, filleted, etc. The parking lot is big but always busy, and full of truly bad drivers. So beware! There are also Chow King and Jollibee franchises inside for your Filipino fast food fix. In fact, if you're feeling homesick for your Filipino heritage (or just a Flip-phile), head on down to SC. Walk the aisles and you will eventually find some elderly folks that look or sound just like your Lola and Lolo. I swear I found my Dad's doppleganger in the skin whitening aisle.

What really turned me against them though is when my disabled brother went in (he can't really travel too far) and the kicked him out b/c he had his (marked) service dog w/ him. Apparently they were quite rude about it too. Not only that they waited until he was half way through his shopping.

This place had arrival different places to eat and dine. I was very surprised to see there own fried chicken establishment that even had selections of noodle bowls. I was very impressed with that alone as I walked through the doors.

I have this problem with always being hungry before shopping and I end up buying more than I really need. So that to me was a plus,plus! The dining and other amenities as a small boutique was a nice touch to give this place a Real MarketPlace feel. 

The only reason why I'm giving this place three stars and not more was because I happen to go tour this place on one of the most busiest days anyone could ever go.

The female shoppers were looking upside my head..Idk why maybe because of my striking gorgeous looks...lol..or just giving me the stanky eye..lol.. Either way I'm all about peace and happiness so it didn't matter. I love all people! I hope the loving smile I had givin in return brighten their journey. :-D

Besides that I asked an employee where a certain product was and he said ""Whhhaat! "" really loud , I felt I disrupted him. Other than that , I didn't get the chance to go to the seafood section for the crab legs I wanted to get, the line was pretty long.

922026,2014-07-05,0,9XelmxS5q9tv7uClvjGqMg,"Seafood City is a pretty good place to shop. There is an assortment of Filipino/Asian products without having to go to Chinatown. It lives up to its namesake and you'll find whole Yellowfin Tuna down to wild caught Oregon sardines. They also carry Filipino beers, Kewpie mayo, Filipino toiletries and magazines. It's a one-stop to the Philippines. Inside the shopping center, they have Pinoy franchises such as Jollibee, Chow King and Valerios Bakery. There is also an esthetician behind the Asian jewelry counter.

The location is centric; it's close to the Strip, airport and major streets. Inside, it is clean and the employees follow sanitation guidelines based on what I see. I have family in the culinary industry and pay attention to these things. The staff is okay; they are not overly friendly, but are not rude to us. Perhaps looking Pinoy helps, based on some reviews, which is unfortunate since this is business. 

What kept me from giving the one-stop shop 5 stars are two things, one worse than the other. The groceries are fresh for the most part, but sometimes are not at peak freshness depending on the day one shows up. Fortunately, I do not have to trek too far or else I'd be upset. 

Onto the bad thing about Seafood City. There are a few customers who cause trouble. A few weeks ago, we witnessed Africans fist fighting outside of the Jollibee section. They were hollering (maybe profanities) in their language. Although the police arrived, human detritus has come to shore at Seafood City. There are some vagrants who hang outside the store and parking lot who beg for money. 

A few days ago, my mom encountered a rude male customer who was pushing her out of the way with his shopping cart and pushing his groceries ahead of hers while flailing his arms at her, thus creating physical contact. When she told him to stop and say ""excuse me"", he claimed that he couldn't tell whether she spoke English or not. Regardless of a customer's level of English literacy, everyone understands ""excuse me."" Even recent Spanish speaking immigrants know and say ""excuse me"" with thick accents. My mother was about to move on, but saw the same man chatting and laughing with the nonchalant security guard about what he did to her. Mom told the security what the man did and that he should do his job and then pretended to scold the man.

I think I will have to consider going to Chinatown, even if the trip is further away.",5GPJYhFS9h71eb2Ow7Gj5w,1,0,4,t3XP9XtiCQCygdF1o65RQg

Love: if you love filipino goodies, this is the best place! They even sell stuff you can't even find somewhere else. It's where I pick up stuff that reminds me of HOME. 
They have a large variety of seafood and meat here. their stuff tends to run out later on the day so its best to go shop earlier in the day.
Fresh fish. Fresh seafoods. Even live crabs and lobsters. Playing with the live crabs makes me happy.
There are fast food restaurants around the supermarket complex. Chowking, Red Ribbon and Jollibee.
They sell fresh bread right nextdoor, Valerio's bakery.
Open from 7am till midnight.
Clean and organized.

Hate: Parking.  They do have really huge parking space, but since it's one of the biggest Filipino supermarket in town, people do come here a lot!! So go off hours.
The distance on every registers are REALLY narrow. Even the shopping carts couldn't fit.
The meat counter can be overwhelming, esp the line for fish cleaning.

I prefer the Biko Langka, it is a personal favorite treat made with sweet sticky rice, coconut milk, shredded coconut, brown sugar, and it has jackfruit. The Biko Ube taste okay, it has a purple food coloring but I didn't feel like it has any ube flavor, it's only sweet rice.

Seafood City Market has a lot of merchandise and produce. They have isles of your filipino snacks, noodles, cooking items, balikbayan boxes, goods, etc. they have a fruit and vegetable section, frozen food section, meats and seafood sections as well! They also have beauty/skincare products at the front. This place has almost everything a filipino could ask for. You also have you're popular filipino vendors such as Jollibee, Chow King, Red Ribbon, and Valerio'e bakery in the store at the front! 

I like coming here because of Jollibee for the most part or for whenever I feel like cooking pancit or getting a few road trip snacks! Lol they also have a mini salon, to go phone stand/at&t kiosk, and a small clothing shop as well. 

This store is located just down Maryland parkway from the UNLV campus so it's convenient for me. I don't know where else you can find a filipino market this big in Vegas but this would be the spot when you're lookin for anything filipino!

The only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars is mostly because most of the times the workers are filipino and it creates a language barrier with some of their strong accents. Also I don't know if it's just me or if they're always restocking everything when I'm there, it becomes a little claustrophobic in the isles. But at least they keep the store clean!

I asked them why couldn't they get it themselves? They replied with ""We are not Asian and they might treat us differently"". I should of been offended right? Nope. Instead I said, ""They will only treat you different if you act like jerks so don't be one and you'll be ok.""

Seafood City is similar to 99 Ranch but caters more to the Filipino population. If you have ever eaten at a Filipino restaurant, this is where you will find most if not all the ingredients in all the dishes you eat. 

I come here for all sorts of things like different flavored chips, nuts, biscuits, crackers, etc. Drinks like coconut juice. mango juice, calamansi juice, etc. 

Basically, a lot of items you just cant find at your basic Smith's or Albertsons. What is also great is the location of this place. If you get hungry there is a Chow King and a Jollibee just right in front where you enter.

The layout of their place is nice also. All the way to the right you have all your vegetables. All the way to the back you have all your refrigerated items. All the way to the left are all the seafood/meat items along with the frozen section. In between you have all the aisles with all the little things I mentioned in my 3rd paragraph.

Service is actually above average. They usually have enough people on registers so that long lines are virtually non existent. Most of the time each cashier has their own assistant that bags all the merchandise you just bought. 

So for those non Asians, just relax and shop just like you would at any other supermarket. Sometimes its ok to shop somewhere different. You never know, you just might find something you really like here.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,14,7,4,WS67oYzHIGDy12xll_Pyig
2798121,2011-09-11,0,9XelmxS5q9tv7uClvjGqMg,"I've got mixed feelings about Seafood City.

What I like: They've got Magnolia Coconut Ice Cream Bars. Sure other Asian stores have them, but their are always in stock and reasonably priced. They usually have a goodly amount of steamed cheesecake onhand. I love this little Japanese dessert because it is nice and light and not too sweet. I don't have to make a separate purchase at Red Ribbon cause they have the mamon sponge cake in store as well. And lastly my mom usually finds all her beloved Filipino ingredients.

What I dislike: It's crowded. Ugh. The store is always packed. I don't think I have ever been there at a time when it wasn't filled with people. If I wanted to willingly subject myself to agoraphobia I'd just go to Walmart on a Saturday at 10 a.m.  And the parking lot is crowded as well. Sometimes I feel sorry for those people who just want to go to Jason's Deli. And of course the smell. Sometimes I can ignore it or it's not too bad, but other times the fish smell is overwhelming.

All in all, this is a great place if you are shopping for Filipino foodstuffs. I usually only get over to it if I am on a shopping trip with my mom. I think one of the biggest draws for me is visiting Chow King for a mango shake - but that is an entirely different review.",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,0,0,3,xRk_TfwZkT83xAea8mpP5Q

We always like to get a case or 2 of water and snacks for the hotel room. Love how it reminded me of many of the Asian Marts back in NJ. It was like a Filipino version of Mitsuwa!  What I really loved was the Filipino BBQ spot and the Filipino crispy food spot located inside. Good pork and chicken BBQ, with lots of meat on the stick, and that Filipino sweetness that I am so familiar with. Just like home!  What I loved even more was finding crispy chicken skin!  Soooooo goooood!  You have to buy it by the pound. And it's really crispy. Not too salty like other ones I have had back in NJ, but it was still great!  There are other eateries, so it's nice to have a variety of menus to choose from. My one and only complaint is that they had so many different types of Skyflakes (a popular brand of crackers in the Philippines). Think if it as a fancy Saltines cracker. They even had a flavor I've never seen before: chicken?!? My husband swears they're good. But they did NOT have the condensed milk/sweet flavor. Despite my disappoint in this, it was still a great shopping trip. I'm sure we will be back again before we leave Vegas. It's not too far from the strip, but you do need a car to get here.

For those who are not familiar with Seafood city, it's a grocery store similar to a 99 ranch, h-mart, Assi etc. but Seafood city is a Filipino grocery store.

They carry all kinds of Filipino products as well as other Asian products but here they have 10 different kinds of tocino brands, lumpias, ice creams etc. They have a couple of tables filled with Filipino ready to eat snacks/desserts (kakanin), they even played Tagalog music!

Seafood City Supermarkets reflect an Americanized version of what a typical Asian supermarket would proffer in terms of selection and environment.

The parking situation is probably better than ChinaTown. It's more spacious, but lacks the cleanliness and even pavement we enjoy (I know...first world problem). The health and sanitation has greatly improved over the years, although the questionable sampling techniques leaves room for improvement.  

I'm sure the grandmas and aunties enjoy the ability to select the ""best"" product from the gamut although no one ever utilizes the gloves or hand washing stations.

Red Ribbon- Filipino inspired bakery....(Tiasan or Ube Cake...Oh Yeah!, Ube craze is spreading still)

Chow King- Philippines take on Panda Express/Soup shops with a Filipino twist. The Chinese influence on Filipino cusine.

Grilled City- Filipino style BBQ and Grilled food. (BBQ meats on skewers)

Crispy Town- Fried food specialties (Fish, Pork, Beef and Lumpia/Eggrolls). Delicious vegetable Eggrolls!

Magnolia Ice Cream Shop- Tropical inspired ice cream and halo-halo(mix-mix) shops. Very good!

Quick and friendly, and if you have some whole fish you can have it cleaned, gutted, and chopped up for you! Very convenient since I doubt I'd have been too successful at it. I still wish I could have had them do that with the squid, that stuff was nasty to do at home later (yet sooo worth it...yummy).  The fresh ingredients made ALL the difference in the chioppino, my wife was raving about the taste later.

If seafood isn't your thing though they also have a huge selection of pork/chicken/beef to choose from. Pork snout? Beef liver? They have it. Wonderful selection, even the frozen areas were fun to browse through!

Food - 4/5 - From Lechon to Skewers to Chicharronnes, everything was excellent.

What I ordered:

Lechon - Fried Pork.  Lechon is such a delicious item.  It is basically  pork with crunchy fried skin on it.   It is simply amazing.

Pork Skewers - The chicken skewers looked excellent too, but I went with pork and was not disappointed.  Huge chunks of Pork on skewers.  Great.

Chicharronnes - These taste like pork rinds.  If you are a fan of pork rinds, grab them.

Sometimes I am a little sad that some vegetables aren't there or the sliced salmon filets are usually gone by the middle of the day.  If you want the fresh stuff, get here early in the A.M.

There was a cut of beef that I had been wanting to buy, but they did not have it. I did like the fact that they had all sorts of offal. The fish and seafood selection is probably what they are best known for. I saw many people in the self-service are picking up mollusks and shrimps. There was also a long line for fish cleaning.

It's in the heart of this so-called ghetto neighborhood and it caters to the Filipino and other Asian communities of Vegas. The market offers a variety of fresh produce, noodles, rice, and desserts. As for the seafood, if you're used to the pre-packaged fish fillets (like in Albertson's, Smiths) get used to looking at whole fish with head and tail in all. They offer several types of fish, squid, crab, and lobster. They even have my elusive seaweed salad! You can't get this stuff at Vons. 

On another note, it provides a little oasis for the Filipino community. There are Filipino fast food restaurants such as, Jollibee and Chowking. For all those who are homesick. I wouldn't advise eating here though, the food is laden with MSG and grease. And it's so not worth paying that $9.00 for a meal!

Wow, this was one of the more interesting places I've stepped foot into since I moved to Vegas. Parking for this place is a zoo but once you find a space you're in for an experience. 

Once inside the door the place reminds me of a Hypermarket with restaurants, a bakery, financial services, and other shops right up front. You walk past all that and into a full fledged supermarket where the first thing you notice is the smell coming from the fish which you can't see at first but you certainly know they're present. This is not your typical American supermarket. It may look like it at first glance, but it's certainly not. So what did I find here? 

Produce: They have a good selection but the pricing for some items is a bit higher than I expected. Also the produce section had a LOT of flies. As in even as oblivious as I am to some things when I notice it's pretty bad. But they had some stuff like different varieties of bananas that I haven't seen elsewhere. 

A quick loop around the store will take you to the source of the very distinctive smell, the open air fish market. They have a nice sized selection of fish and other things and after you pick out what you want they will clean it up for you. This section of the store is CROWDED. Even a big guy like me got bumped into. And if you don't like raw fish this is not the place for you as people are flying past you with all kinds of it. I overheard grumbling about how long it was taking to process the fish but I just thought it was cool and I want to go back when I can properly transport my fish home in the desert heat. 

A walk through the center of the store led me to a lot of different ethnic items, some I've seen at the International Market but quite a few items were unique to this store. The list of unique items is too long to list here, if you're looking for something your best bet is to stop in and look for yourself. I picked up a couple of things (they even had the tamarind hard candy I have trouble finding!) and went to check out. Checkout was packed but moved fast. And the people working the registers were friendly and they actually have a Point of Sale / Credit Card machine that's programmed intelligently.

My only complaint about this place, if you want to call it a complaint, is the fact that no one here is friendly! I'm used to going into a place and being asked if I need any help, but this place doesn't do this and there are lots of workers here. Maybe it's because they are always busy, but many times we could've used some help but didn't get it.",zudZl2wYpmZYyoklPVhV-A,1,0,4,lVrRKJExACUGBL6w7jNtDw

It may not be the cleanest and most complete supermarket Vegas has but for it being a Filipino Supermarket it sure does the job.  Whitening soap? Check.  Red ribbon ensaymada? Check. Phone cards? Check. Filipino movies? Check. Fresh seafood staring at you in all its fishy smelling glory? Check. You can even have your fish cooked. Yes, we Filipinos are lazy and that's exactly how it is back home.

My ultimate favorite is their marinated meat and OMG their crab!!! It is soooo good. Crab fat and all. *drools*

The store is huge!  You have electronic booths (cellular services), food court-type options (Jollibee's, a Chinese restaurant and a Filipino bakery) and of course, groceries.  I love how cheap everything is in the produce department. Some of my favorites like bitter melon and other squashes seem to be substantially cheaper than other grocery stores like Smith's or Albertson's.  What I love is the fact that this store also has everything I grew up with.  It's like going through the Asian food aisle at the store...except it's the whole store!  Then, you get to the meat and fish section.  That's where the heart of the store is.  So many types of fish!  So many types of meat.  All kinds of meat parts: pork, chicken and beef.  The back counters are super efficient.  What I love is the fact that you can grab fish, like catfish, take a number and ask the back counter employees to deep fry the fish.  It's a service not many people know about.  I love it!!

If you're in the mood to make pork gisantes, adobo or other Filipino delights, come and check out this place.  I KNOW you'll find what you're looking for :)",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,4,2,4,RhCWLcqEzDyb7b8xJxRrXw

I wanted fish, but it was such a long line for cleaning and such that it probably will be an hour before we get our stuff ready to go home. 

Filipino products are obviously abundant and there are some harder to find offerings here. I think if there's some odd thing I need to recreate a Filipino dish this is my go-to. Most dishes though use very common ingredients that I can find in the Asian marts much closer to my area so I don't see myself coming out of the way to come here.

My parents usually drop by to pick up some tocino (Filipino breakfast meat) that you can just pop in the pan and cook away. 

It's cleaner than Chinatown here and the staff is super helpful. Prices are comparable, a lot of the time it'll be a little more pricer than Chinatown..

Also, you gotta know when to go so that it's not busy = late at night, 2-3 hours before it closes. Filipinos usually be gettin their jollibee and chowking flow on, and you can be free to shop in Seafood City!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,5,4,5,_iWsrx9vt-BhT_1flHkMpQ

My go-to Filipino grocery market. Located within Vegas' Filipino central... If this is your first time here, as you walk in you'll also see Filipino fast food restaurants such as Chow King, Jollibee, Red Ribbon Bakery, Valerio's Bake Shop, and few new ones as well. 

I come here for the affordable produce, fruits and veggies I can't find at my neighborhood market. They also sell fresh fish, meats by the pound, Asian skincare, Asian or Filipino snacks, baked goods from local vendors, a variety of spam flavors, red hot dog, fried fish, and many other Filipino and Asian foods. They have a bigger selection to choose from compared to the smaller Filipino markets in Henderson. Some items are cheaper than the smaller markets around town. 

I like it because it's a once stop shop for most of my Filipino food needs. And on my way out, I usually stop at Valerio's Bakery for fresh Pan De Sal and either a drink from Jollibee or Chow King.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,4,5,4,4c4xCc2ESlvvspGhkqQPzQ

You have to come here on a weekday at an odd time to avoid the crowd of little old Filipino ladies that cut in front of you...I'm pretty tall for an Asian so I'm sure they can see me but old Filipino ladies don't care. Parking can be chaotic. Filipinos are not used to traffic signs/rules so it can get frustrating. Being half-Filipino, I am aware of the lack of discipline which is a trait common among Filipinos...I can't stand it!

Valerio's is a bakery to the left of the entrance of Seafood City. They have good sugar doughnuts that are super heavy and filling...and other Filipino breads and baked goods. They only take cash.

When you walk in, to the left is Chowking. To the right you got Jollibee and Red Ribbon. Straight ahead is a bunch of stalls selling phone cards and a travel agency. Behind all that is a grocery store.

Today, I was looking for ingredients for kare-kare for a potluck - that was my main mission. I couldn't find peanut butter so I asked one of the employees stocking the shelves. ""Excuse me! Excuse me! Where can I find peanut butter?"" But he ignored me or he's completely deaf. Denied! I should've talked in thick PILIPINO aksent and said ""hoy kuya where is da feanat vatter?""

Pretty reasonable prices and when I'm doing mass lumpia rolling, I come here for the ground pork rather than going to the neighborhood grocery store because it's cheaper. 

The only thing that peeves me is when the lines are long...the lines are long. They don't have actual moving conveyer belts to accommodate your grocery so I feel like this system slows them down. Also, it doesnt offer much space either. Y'all ever watched a bunch of Filipinos get impatient? Lol. Before you get your panties in a bunch, I'm Filipino myself. I really wish they upgrade their register areas to prevent overcrowding. Annnd child...let it be a holiday coming up. Whew...

None-the-less, it's my go-to store when I gotta throw down the home eats. I don't recommend bringing a stroller in the actual grocery store because it's somewhat of an inconvenience because certain areas get crowded with customers waiting (ahem seafood area).

I love eating at the chowling..everything r good..

5651050,2014-06-01,1,9XelmxS5q9tv7uClvjGqMg,"You guys, I have this really humongous love-hate relationship with Seafood City.. & here's why:

LOVE: I love that I can drive to a little ""home away from home"" market that definitely has the feel of being back in the Philippines. You have Chow King and Jollibee PLUS Red Ribbon inside. And the actual market has vegetables/fruits for your Filipino dish. They also sell balut here! But be warned, BALUT is not for the faint of heart! Middle section has condiments, the tabo that you've been needing for your bathroom to wash your pwet, Milo & other Filipino and non-Filipino beverages, and as well as your Filipino chichiria (snacks). Then you have the meats and seafood in the left side of the market which is actually my favorite because it really reminds me of the palengkes in the Philippines. You choose your own fish and put in the bag basically. Prices here are fairly reasonable. It's also pretty clean compared to the other Asian markets in Vegas. And the staff are super nice!

HATE: Oh goodness, what I don't like about this place is how crowded it is in the market. It's small and two people can barely fit in the aisles. I also don't like how my little home away from home is nearly a 30 minute drive from my house. I seriously wish that they would build a Seafood City closer to where I live, and it wouldn't hurt if it was a tad bit bigger than it is now.

Overall: Despite my little rant there, I would have no other choice but to come back here when needed. It's the only Seafood City in Vegas. It's the only place that would remind me of ""home"".",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,0,0,4,WS1O8kOR074gqxd8ShunrA
5659873,2014-05-12,1,9XelmxS5q9tv7uClvjGqMg,"Unlike other Asian supermarkets here in the Valley, Seafood City is open until midnight. SNAZZY. 

While I do frequent SF Market, 168 Market, and Ranch 99 for certain items, Seafood City is by far, and I do mean by far, the cleanest and most well organized of all of the grocery stores. 

While I'll save my opinions on the food court for individual reviews (Umm, only Valerio's Bake Shop is worth going to IMO) you can shop and eat which is great if you need to one stop shop. 

Best thing about Seafood City is that their produce, while not organic, is crazy cheap and of good quality. I stocked up on their precut bamboo shoots, mint and various types of mushrooms that would cost you a small fortune at Smiths, and we're not even going to discuss what it would cost at Whole Foods (think first born child.)

You can find an abundance of prepackaged items, especially Filipino desert mixes and spices. While others have mentioned that you can find stuff for other Asian cuisines, eh, I'm not sure that I would agree with that. Yam noodles, galangal, Korean red pepper, etc you're definitely not going to find them here - trust me, I've looked and no dice.

As a non-Filipino, but as somebody who has lived with, dated, and worked with Filipinos (not to mention my mom and her whole family living there for a time) I guess I'm used to certain things and can also understand non-Filipinos apprehension about shopping at a store that caters to a certain demographic (See Roger T.'s review.) While most people act neither here nor there about you at this store, nobody is going to straight up not help you if you ask politely. I would be lying though if I said that the cashiers haven't acted like I didn't exist, acted put out by my mere presence and basically have thrown my change into my hand without a word.  In addition to this seemingly passive aggressive behavior, other shoppers have no qualms about jumping you in line. Whatever. Take my money or don't - I don't really care if people are prejudiced against me for whatever reason or not. If I can walk out with my bag of groceries and be charged the same amount as everyone else, that's all I care about. In the end, it's just another grocery store and you should check it out.

Like others have mentioned, parking is chaotic, especially around meal times because of Jason's Deli and Buffalo Wild Wings sharing the main thoroughfare of parking spots. Also, if you need to turn left to get onto Maryland Parkway to go south, you're going to need to exit by Best Buy because it's right turn only foolery out of every exit in this parking lot.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,3,3,sIu7aVukpHNG63JJwTUpng

LIKES: the products they have. Most are from the philippines. But the prices are funny. Whenever it comes down to paying, we always hit the $100 mark.  And of course i like jollibee, chowking, and red ribbon. They should add Greenwhich ahaha

DISLIKE: PARKING, SECURITY, LOCATION, and how TINY the market is. Its gets crowded easy, there are rude people who just make their way in and out of the market, people fight over parking, not enough secuity especially when it gets full, and i can barely move my cart around without saying EXCUSE ME or squeezing through aisles. They restock during the busiest hour and i find that annoying. I see boxes everywhere which makes it even more crowded. 

Relocate with a bigger store please? Like henderson... :P",Bhc91b8DfAYeceqhHRnqHA,8,6,4,oxpEe7b3RGz8K9lxlUWJhg

Kampai!!!  Seafood City on Maryland Parkway is the jackpot.  Bags of gzyoza to pick from so that at any given moment I have a selection in my freezer.  

The product lines concentrate on Filipino foods, but there's enough variety to satisfy most.  Big and airy, high ceilings, well lit and huge, the produce is always fresh and a much better deal than other supermarkets in the area.  Also included are fruits and vegetables beyond the usual broccoli spears and eggplant.

There's also a variety of fast food establishments as you enter their doors, which make good soups and the standard fried chicken baskets.

You can find some cheaply priced essentials; Asian delights and very reasonably priced seafood. Oooh the seafood that was why we went back the 2nd time. 

We grabbed a few pounds  of whole shrimp and a container of old bay and we couldn't get home fast enough to cook them up and properly season them.  It was heaven; As soon as we can find a place close to the apartment where we can break crabs open and not have to worth about the after effects of smell and the random chunks of flying crab as you break them apart we will be back.  

Oh word of advice is to be sure to weigh your seafood before going to the register; it not you hold up the line and look like a fool; we thought it was kinda funny but won't be making that mistake again.  The man at the counter was very nice and was able to use his scale to weigh everything but it took a few minutes. 

Be careful/buying dairy/eggs here both of my trips here they had them sitting in the aisles.  I touched a few and they were dry and room temperature. I'm sure the health inspector would have freaked but as long as you are careful on what you buy here you won't leave disappointed.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,0,4,gBH7B76tfepuJmLI1ih_3w

Maybe I'm biased, since I usually shops at 168 market on Spring Mountain and Jones.
Where they have everything you need from Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, to Filipino and American. Plus their fresh fish and meat department.

I was on the UNLV side and wanted to get some fresh Asian vegetables so I decided to go to Seafood City instead driving over to Chinatown. I've been hearing so much about this Seafood City place.  

Their vegetable selection was weak, and most of them are old and dry. 
I wanted to get some Thai curry too while I was here but nope, walked down every isle and couldn't find any Thai section. I guess this market only has Filipino food?
Their fish did not seem fresh, I was checking the eyes, under the fins and it took me a good old 10 minutes before I found one that fairly decent. And there's a line of people waiting by the seafood department? I don't get it.

Don't waste your time if you are looking for a Asian market that has good and fresh selections, just drive over to Chinatown.",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,3,2,1,VJteXEhgy3YT6H10yYUiqw

Just avoid going to get Seafood on Sundays. It seems to the busiest times. Too long of line to drop your items off to weighed and even longer wait if you want them cleaned.

Vegetables, only if I have to. 
The quality of the veggies isn't always so fresh to me. It often looks old and withered. But i can get ube (purple yam) here so that always makes me look past this.

Filipino staple items, yes. 

Love the food courts in the front and the bakeries. Easy location with lots of offerings. I can't complain.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,4,3,4,i4OQ25E1h_xLF1q0NErILw

5939245,2012-11-18,26,9XelmxS5q9tv7uClvjGqMg,"This will not be one of my ""adventures in womanizing"". I just came here for a couple of quick items and ended up getting numbers from 3 girls. I didn't even ask. I've never really been attracted to Filipino chicks in the past... but these chicks were like those girls you see on the Filipino soap operas. I thought they were really hot.

I recently had a conversation with 3 non-Asian college students about: ""Which Asian person had the most impact on Asian people today"". They listed off people like: Sun Tzu, Dalai Lama, Mao Zedong, Dr. Feng Shan Ho, Norman Mineta. I being the only person of Asian descent had the most credibility in my opinion. And when it was my turn, I said that the greatest Asian person in history is MANNY PACQUAIO! My argument was that Manny Pacquaio can use his straight left hand to kick the sh!t out of the Dalai Lama, and he can sing better than him as well, therefore he is the greatest Asian person ever.

So, I came to SEAFOOD CITY for some unlicensed Pacquaio merchandise for my Filipino friend who is going to his next fight. Unfortunately, I got off work too late and the Pacquaio store was closed. I decided to just walk around a bit, and I found the selection to be much more superior to Greenland. 

We don't really got a good selection of Asian supermarkets here in LV. Every time I ask a Japanese person the question: ""What's the best Japanese Market?"". In a very enthusiastic voice, they always answer by screaming ""GREENNNLLAANND!"" I really can't tell if they are being serious or not.  Also, Notice how I am giving this place a 5-star review while I gave Greenland a 2-star.  SEAFOOD CITY has better customer service than Greenland and many of the items are like a quarter of the price. Not to mention I even got felt up by one chick while I was waiting in line to pay.

After shopping we had lunch at Grill City and almost ordered everything on the menu! We ordered the chicken bbq, squid, lechon, dinuguan, pork bbq, and rice.  We wanted to order more but we knew our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  All the food was excellent.
