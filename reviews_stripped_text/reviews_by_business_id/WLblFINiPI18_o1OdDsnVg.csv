The place was clean and stocked when I was there. There is plenty of space to eat, both inside and outside. The atmosphere was pleasant. It is in a not-so-great area of town, but we are all university students, so the location is great for us.

I ordered a grilled steak taco and watched the employee put a nice scoop of meat on my tortilla.  And then he did the unforgiveable - he took the spoon and removed HALF the meat off back into the meat container. NOOOOOO!

The food was really good, the service was far less. The only complaint on the food is they are not as generous as Chipotle with their guacamole. 

The girl at the counter had serious sass.. Having worked in her position for four year- I would never mock a customer. You could tell she was local.. haha
They put chicken next to my burrito so they would know it had chicken, even though it was a vegetarian burrito, so I said: "" I did'nt ask for chicken"", and they all looked confused and all started asking each other ""is there chicken in here"", ""hey did you add chicken"" to each other. I thought that was taking too long, you either A. Let me check or B. Just make a new one without all the question asking. Since they didn't get the memo I just said ""I'll check it myself and just let you know"". They didn't get it, so I repeated myself. (It's wasteful to instantly make a new one, so I wanted to make sure it was right before they threw it out.). The girl at the cashier proceeds to mock me and say, ""GUYS, She'll check it herself, she'll check it herself"" in a very rude/ mocking manner.... Oh well, sadly many people don't have great customer service.

""Fresh Atlantic Salmon."" What does that mean to you? 

Well, the so-called ""manager"" at the location I ate didn't know, herself, and did not speak good English.

They charged an expensive amount for their ""fresh Atlantic salmon"" taco plate, which (after further inquiry) is really farm raised to rake in more profit for their company.

They did not have a senior discount, either and I declined their $2.99 drink. This is not ""the real McCoy"" for what I wanted, but in my opinion fake food.

First, the line is long and moves slow. The menu is positioned on the sides so it's not exactly easy to read while waiting in line. I was reading the items and so I had my back to the direction of the line. But, I was still relatively close to the person in front of me and to my surprise, a well dressed woman ducked under the rails to cut in front of me. I was wondering if it was a joke but I asked her and she thought about it for a minute then allowed me and several people behind me go ahead. Strange but whatever...at least she owned up to it. So, onto the food.

I got a steak burrito and asked for it to be wet. Very small amount of steak and mostly rice and beans. She put a small amount of green salsa on it, wrapped it, a handful of cheese on top and threw it in the moving salamander. I watched as it sat in the holding bin for awhile. So many employees here that I don't know how anything would be sitting for more than 10 seconds, let alone much longer. Waste of employees. Then, they did not put enchilada sauce. I thought maybe these kids just didn't know what a 'wet' burrito is so didn't want to interfere with their ever so busy routine, ugh. But, no...they charged an extra dollar for an enchilada style burrito. Lame. Also charge extra for sour cream when the burrito itself is already 10 bucks?? Wow. Very overpriced. They must be killing it on the bottom line except with so many worthless employees that stand there to simply bag up my order and give me dirty looks the entire time they are doing it, I definitely won't be back.

Over priced. Can't get my order right. And basically a giant pile of rice and beans with a little side of meat.

I ordered a few steak burritos and steak salads for my friends. I personally ate the steak salad and it was pretty darn good. The salad was put on top of a flour tortilla that was baked with cheese. I chose black beans to go with mine. There was rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, guac, tortilla strips, cilantro, and cheese. For salads, the dressing selections were a creamy tomatillo dressing or a cilantro lime vinaigrette. I opted for the creamy one and it was DELICIOUS. I am really picky when it comes to the quality of my ingredients. For example, if I see wilted, browning lettuce in my salad; I will not eat it. The lettuce here was very fresh and I did not have an issue with the produce. The dressing though made the salad! You MUST get the tomatillo dressing! I was just sad that they charged extra for more to-go containers of the dressing.

The prices here are very reasonable. I believe my steak salad was about $9-$10? I just wish Cafe Rio was located closer to the Strip! It was quite a drive to get here!

Eastern but since the majority of my day is spent in the University area, I decided to make a quick stop in for their Tuesday lunch special: Coconut grilled shrimp tacos with a mango sauce.

Yes, it does taste as good as it sounds.

I've actually had this special in the past, and it seems that each time I have it, they changed something about the recipe. First their shrimp tacos were about as big as their salmon tacos (which they used a tortilla size between the burrito and the regular taco, maybe something the size of a wall clock face?), but now their tortillas are the small regular taco-sized ones that are always homemade. Before, their shrimp was a coconut-incorporated batter where the shrimp were fried till crunchy, but now they're grilled with huge pieces of shredded coconut on them in a sauce I couldn't quite discern.  It was mighty tasty though, and although I missed the crunch of a fried shrimp, I did prefer the up in flavor factor that these new shrimp had.  

The special (and pretty much anything else you order) comes with a nice helping of rice and beans, which haven't changed much in my opinion, and they taste fine but definitely aren't my preference.  The black beans are much better than the pinto, I think, but this rice reminds me more of a rice pilaf than anything else. 

Among other things, I'd recommend the salmon taco, which I prefer with the cilantro-ranch dressing, or any of their salads which are huge and come laid atop a burrito-sized tortilla with melty cheese on it.  The boyfriend loves their burritos as they come served ""wet"" with enchilada sauce on top, but I kind of think the burritos are overrated and enough to feed 2-3 people with a normal appetite. Actually, pretty much everything comes in proportions enough to serve 2-3 people with a normal appetite, but who are we kidding right? Vegas is a town where the locals love their food and tend to eat like we're practicing for a food competition. Take no shame, fellow Vegas locals.

2962286,2016-11-21,1,WLblFINiPI18_o1OdDsnVg,"From someone who rarely gives less than 3 stars, here goes.  
So I downloaded the CR app when they did away with the stamp cards.  All was well.  I earned a free drink due to one of my FB friends downloading the app as well (oh the power of social media!).
Fast forward Saturday night,  My husband and I are going to the UNLV basketball game and decide to go a bit early to stop at CR for a bite to eat beforehand.  Everything was going splendidly until we get to the register.  I let the cashier know that I had a free drink on the CR app and I pull it up on my phone so that she can scan it.  She tries to scan it but nothing happens so I'm asked to brighten my screen as, in her words, their ""scanner doesn't read unless the screen is really bright.""  No problem!  I adjusted my screen as briiiiiight as it would go.  She scanned it and didn't say another word.  I thought all was well and put my phone away.  Then she tells my total and it didn't seem correct so I asked her if she got the drink promo.  She said, ""Oh no I didn't.  I need to scan it again.""  At this point I'm starting to get slightly annoyed at having to once again get out my phone, get into it, go to the app and try to pull up the QR scan.  But free is free and I earned that drink!  
So I get my phone and pull up the CR app.  However, lo and behold - once I closed the phone down from the previous attempt the QR scan for the free drink disappears.  Gone forever.  So I tell the cashier that it's no longer showing on the app since I closed it and she blankly stares at me.  Deer in the headlights.  I stare back and then ask, ""Are you not able to give me the drink then?""  She says, ""No, I can't.  I'm sorry.""  I then go on to tell her that it's not my fault that they have a faulty scanner and she should have let me know that it didn't scan before I put my phone away.  I'm fully expecting her to tell me that she can go ahead and give me the free drink.  Nope - not so much.  Again I get the blank stare.  At this point I realize I'm talking to someone who's inept at best and at worst, completely clueless.  I tell her that I'll just go ahead and buy the drink.  She apologized (points for that cause she wasn't rude at all, just baffled, it seems), I paid for the meal (including around $2.00 for what should have been a free drink) and sat down to eat.  
My husband then noticed that there was no cheese on the tortilla of his salad.  Am I dreaming or do they normally melt cheese on the tortilla before they add the rice and beans for the salad?  Minus points for the cheese omission.  Other than that, the food was as good as it ever is.  
The drink issue was just a principle thing - a $2 drink is not going to make or break me.  I'm just bitter cause she SAW that I had a QR scan on my phone; she should have honored the free drink.  It's not as if I was trying to get an entire meal for free.  
Perhaps management at this CR should put a procedure in place for situations like this.  If they have a scanner that's shoddy, I can't be the first person who's had this issue.  Management?  Are you listening?  Do you even care?!?!?  :)
Until then, I'll stick to my old go to Cafe Rio on Warm Springs and Stephanie.  They rock.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,2,0,2,pEI-QU8K4RbisAIreoSOfw

Went with a party of three during the afternoon.

Atmosphere: Lively and colorful
Despite there being a long line upon arriving, the music, lighting, and decor contributed to the sensory experience of the visit. The colors and lights invoked a modern and natural feel, and the colorful, expanded menu adjacent to the lines introduced a visually-engaging element to the waiting experience.

Service: Quick!
Despite there being a line, the service was quick! The waiting time was reasonable and the servers put together our food quickly.

Food: Expected quality
The food is a fair value for what is paid. I ordered a barbacoa burrito, and for the price I paid for the meal, the burrito and greens that accompanied them were fresh, flavorful, presented well. One drink, however, is pretty pricey, but with the assortment of drinks available to consume, it's great if you are looking for something unique to quench your thirst.

Summary: Worth it!
Despite the long line, the somewhat-high prices, Cafe Rio offers freshness, quality service, a welcoming atmosphere, and a modern yet natural dining experience. Visit any Cafe Rio when you get a chance.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,4,Q3SjJTQXR5BL4GmKnTcJzw

Go to Cafe Rio on a Tuesday. Order their Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Eat the Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Leave Happy. 

These tacos are seriously heaven on earth. You can order 1 or 2 tacos with a side of rice and beans. A fountain drink comes with the tacos since it's the daily special. Each taco is stuffed with 2 or 3 pieces of coconut breaded shrimp, lettuce, some cilantro and comes with a side of warm mango chunky salsa. It's really unfortunate that these tacos are only available on Tuesdays. Or else I'd be there every single day as their star customer! 

Their rice and beans are alright, nothing to gush over. Personally, I think the rice and beans at Chipotle are better. They have homemade tortillas here. Those are alright, too. If you get their burrito, spend a dollar more to get it ""enchilada style"". They douse their hot sauce over the burrito and sprinkle cheese on top. 

Cafe Rio recently started to put their specialty drinks out by the fountain drinks. Their strawberry lemonade, mint limeade and horchata are all available to refill for free! I personally like to mix the strawberry lemonade and the mint limeade together. It's really refreshing - a must-have for the Vegas summers.

Nothing was too dry, but that could also be the result of the wet beans and sauce they put in the burrito. The problem with that is that you cannot pick up the burrito and eat it with your hands, you're going to need a knife and fork. That was one downside of the food and it's not one of the cheaper places either. 

The food is quite pricy for the amount that is given. Chipotle is slightly cheaper and quite similar. That being the first time i went to Cafe Rio, they knew i was a beginner and asked tricky questions. When you order, they ask after they form your burrito if you want it enchilada style. I said no as well as my friend behind me and they did it with his and they charge you .95 cents more for it! Is it really worth it? i highly doubt it especially since it's just sauce and cheese. They don't even tell you these things cost more money, they just ask you and make you fall into their trap. Tricky people.

Located near UNLV and a close drive from the airport so you can hit it up on your from picking up friends from the airport as you head your way towards the Strip.  The decor is nice.  Not as modern and clean as Chipotle or Baja Fresh but this place has more of a real Mexican restaurant feel instead of a fast food chain.

I ordered the Barbacoa Burrito with some enchilada sauce on the sauce.  My friends were raving about the barbacoa but I was a underwhelmed.  Even though the meat was very tender and they packed quite a bit of meat in the burrito, the meat was WAY too sweet for my liking.  It was overwhelming and it pretty much took over all other flavors within the burrito.  My other friends had the chicken and they really enjoyed it because it was very moist.  Beside the burrito is a bed of lettuce and pico de gallo.  It is a very filling meal for being just a burrito with some veges on the side and for around $8.

The staff were cordial and efficient.  There were tables all around so you should not have problems looking for a seat.  I think this place is worth another try but with another meat.

Don't be fooled, this is not even close to a traditional tostada, it's more like a salad but a hard corn shell hidden somewhere at the bottom. The tostado, starting from the bottom: hard shell, meat choice, melted cheese, A LOT OF LETTUCE, pico, cheese, cilantro, chips, sour cream. 

This particular location is definitely lacking in cleanliness and customer service. The floors are usually dirty and the trash cans are almost always overflowing.

""Nothing ... she's a lil' bitch.""

Whoa! I had no idea what was going on and why this middle-aged, polite-looking, homely Caucasian lady was telling her lunch-mate that someone was a bitch, or words to that effect; however, this is the Café Río at the university neighbourhood, so ... shitty service is the norm. It is par. 

In other words, she was undoubtedly referring to an employee from the Mormon-owned chain. And possibly justifiably so.

The food is the same here as it is in Summerlin, in Centennial, in Aliante, across the street from Henderson on the Las Vegas side of Eastern, or in fucking Utah. It's a chain (with A-OK food). But the service here ... oh man. It fucking blows.

""They go the same speed if there is one person in line or if there are twenty.""

I disagree with this separate, thirty-something-year-old, dissatisfied regular sporting a UNLV-Tarkanian shirt. (Go Rebels.) I think they actually go slower when there are more people in queue. For, they know -- from experience -- that some patrons will walk out in defeat. 

Remember: quitters never win. But to win at this Café Río, one might have to wait twenty minutes before even having one's food. YMMV.

It's one of the better places to go if you're looking for a bite to eat near UNLV. While I wouldn't call it authentic Mexican food, it does make for a good lunch. I pretty much see this place as a Chipotle 2.0. 

Their highlight seems to be their pork; more specifically, their pork burrito. It has this savory sweet flavor to it that is actually quite tasty. The burritos are pretty large, too. They could easily be boxed up and saved for a second meal. Unfortunately, I'm not looking to gain my Freshman 15 back, so I have only eaten this once. Their salmon tacos are also a good choice, if you're looking for something lighter.

Now, I'm a college student. I almost eat out for my weekday lunch on the daily. Therefore, I strive to be cheap, but not dollar menu cheap. This place is kinda pricey if you go off their general menu and get a drink. Be prepared to pay $8-10 if you do. I usually go with their daily special, which usually comes around to a more reasonable $6-7, plus you get a drink with it. While their daily specials are not as tasty as their burritos, they get the job done for me.

My friend brought me here for my birthday lunch normally only eat chicken or turkey. So I have never been here before and I decided to go with the chicken bowl or I guess its the chicken salad. Upon entering it was really really busy so I took that as a good time there was a long line and whilst I waited i looked over the menu. What I loved is that they were making homemade tortillas!! I decided on the chicken salad , there are 2 types of chicken, the marinated one or the fire grilled chicken and I went to for the grilled chicken. I also had it with the beans and the rice. They also put 1 scoop of guacamole some tortilla strips Cojita cheese of course your romaine lettuce. It's served in a really big containers so it's actually kind of nice the only drawback about Cafe Rio is that is pretty expensive and if you get an extra cilantro dressing they charge 95 cents for it. 

I got to work and delved into my lunch, my first thought was that I was so excited because it was so delicious. The chicken was really tender the tortilla strips are really fresh and the dressing was a perfect addition to the salad. The tortilla that was homemade is seriously the best part, so delicious and tasted just like the ones my grandma made. The salad is big enough for lunch and for dinner so it's really actually kind of nice so I don't mind paying $10 for the salad itself if you go during lunch be sure to get there early or order online because there sometimes there is a long wait or no chairs available. Also don't forget to get your Cafe Rio card which I still haven't gotten and I'm gone twice.

1) location. It is less than a 5 minute walk from my office.

But the things I don't like are the reasons I just can't believe in the CR dogma:
1) The food is just bland. Granted, I am limited in my options since I don't eat meat, but the salsas and sauces just don't have much flavor. I am not expecting a spicy explosion of flavor, just something I can taste, but I can't get this here.
2) Price. Just under $10 gets me a burrito and a soda. I can get the same at Chipotle for a almost $4 less, and they have better salsa. 
3) The feeling. After eating CR I feel like I was punched repeatedly in the stomach. Ok, its not that bad of feeling, but I just feel icky. I don't know why, but I don't get this same feeling from other burrito joints.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,0,0,2,4uvQQUCClcTsmkXVB-POxA

The tacos were soggy - I couldn't believe how quickly they just dispersed juice down my arm as I tried to eat them.

Service is no nonsense cafeteria style, and you better speak loud because the workers are degraded to yell whenever somebody gets a free meal or is notified of a first-timer. Ugh.

4670684,2016-04-06,5,WLblFINiPI18_o1OdDsnVg,"Cafe Rio is like a partner in a co-dependent relationship that keeps you coming back for more abuse. Many things are great and some are not so fantastic. For example, their Horchata drink is amazing. True to the original recipe, they use condensed milk to add thickness and sweetness. Unfortunately after two 30oz refills, I found out how lactose intolerant I really am. Their drink mixing machines seem to always be broken (at every location in Vegas) so here's a PRO TIP: Ask an employee to manually stir the mix in the the container so you get the best ratios of cinnamon, horchata mix, water, and sweet milk.

The menu is a little bit sneaky. You think you're ordering the $8 dollar burrito but then the cashier asks you for $12.75 and you wonder if you have entered the Twilight Zone. She then explains with a smile that you ordered the steak which has a $1.50 up charge. You also ordered it ""Wet"" which adds another dollar or so. She backs up her claim by pointing at the very tiny print on the side of menu.

You pay the penalty knowing that you're gonna get your frequent purchaser card stamped that day. After 10 entrees, you're going to redeem yourself with a free meal. That meal will consist of the very item that you are too cheap to order normally. Victory!

I normally get the Shredded Chicken Burrito ""Wet Style."" They place your choice of hot sauce and melted cheese on top. It's run through the oven and comes out like a big enchilada that's ready to eat. I usually overstuff it with all they free items. Beware guacamole and sour cream trigger extra charges. For $1 they give you a small teaspoon sized portion. 
 
Cafe Rio is very tasty compared to the dog food that they serve at Chipotle. But it's not as good as a genuine Mexican Restaurant. However, you feel safer here than in a hole in the wall place. They offer a good balance of franchise corporate place with the feeling of a family owned restaurant. You don't feel like your food is being made with old or expired ingredients.

BEWARE: their restaurants only seem to have one restroom per gender & only one toilet each. Not a smart move for a Mexican food place in America. Especially since their locations seem to be around high schools and colleges. Those youngsters are still developing their digestive systems. 4 ounces of melted cheese, sour cream, beans, and salsa will create problems in most sophomores.

I will continue to visit Cafe Rio but I will avoid the horchata. I will also make sure that I'm near a commercial toilet that provides a powerful vacuum flush. It won't be onsite because their restrooms are usually occupied by employees or newbies to the world of Mexican inspired cuisine. Their young palate is still developing. On a final note, the staff is generally nice and will serve you with a smile. They choose locations with plenty of parking.",73vadj4T6Jc83cgheyBe9g,2,2,4,ESKaENls9HD4fQqvUIFdOw

When we got to sit down and start eating I took my first bite into my burrito and it was cold!!! I was shocked. This has never happened to me here before. I went to see if I could get warmed up. I decided to just get a quesadilla instead because I feared the beans with be cold again. I got a chicken quesadilla, they were cool about it. No problems.

For example, I just came in after my class at UNLV and only 2 gentlemen who were together were in front of me. There was maybe 2 tables full in the entire restaurant so it was not busy by any means. There was a huge catering order sitting on a couple tables, but there were plenty of employees around. Anyway, I walk right up to the ordering counter since the two guys were in the middle of their order and I overhear an employee tell them that they do not have pork. The employee maybe said sorry, but I honestly don't know. The two guys made a not funny joke about ""who's getting fired for this?"" because the pork is apparently all they come in for and it was obviously devastating for their dramatic selves. So, the employee just tries half-heartedly to make light of the situation and offers to give them the remaining pork and half of another meat. Now I have no idea what Cafe Rio's policy is on running out of items and what to do if that occurs, but if I was that customer I would be really bummed and would hope they would give me a free drink or like 10% off. Anything small just to make amends because I know I always go here for my shredded chicken salad and am not about to spend an extra $1 for grilled chicken if they were out of shredded. Fast forward to my order being completed with no hiccups. I am at the register and overheard from the employee who offered the half pork deal that the cashier was the manager. She was not what I expected a manager to be by any means. She wasn't rude or anything like that, but the customer service was not there even when I used a free meal card from my birthday! It seemed like she was just going through the motions and didn't care about me as the customer and a loyal customer at that. Ultimately, my order was perfect EXCEPT there was no cheese on my tortilla. I asked for it on the side which they did, but I never have to ask for cheese on my tortilla at other locations and this location didn't ask so I assumed it would be there. It's such a little thing, but it helps ""make my meal a masterpiece"" as they like to say so I was bummed when it wasn't there. I will totally return for the food despite my lack of cheese and customer service, but if customer service goes down any more than my standard, then the food isn't worth it.

I'm no restaurant chain consultant but I think if you pay managers enough to care and staff well enough that they know they're making a very competitive wage, value follows and customers come back.

I have not dined in so I can't comment on customer service nor do I even know what the place looks like as I have not set foot in the restaurant. We have ordered from this place about 4 times and what I do know is I like the taste of the food I have tried so far. Their concept is likened to Baja Fresh but offers more meat variety. Also offered on the wider range menu is a fire grilled salmon for the non meat eaters and desserts like Tres leches and Flan to top off your meal. Taste is by far superior compared to the likes.

I've had their enchiladas which were very tasty, with chicken and comes with rice and beans and your choice of hot, medium or mild sauce. Their fire grilled chicken tacos are superb as well. The sweet pork barbacoa is not one of my faves though, it has a certain sweetness that doesn't appeal to me.
Yesterday I had their shredded chicken breast burrito enchilada style ($1 more to get it enchilada style) and it was humongous! It was delicious and made even better by adding their creamy tomatillo sauce on top. It may not be the best Mexican food you can get but it tops my list when it comes to Mexican fast food and way better than eating McDonalds for sure!

Most of my quesadilla was filled with cheese so I personally do not think you'd get your monies worth. The basic toppings that comes with the quesadilla are lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and avocado. If you want any extras or anything additional to those toppings they will charge you. When it came time to paying the cashier was a bit off, he asked what I had in my order and the girl who did the toppings already communicated it to him on my order so I had to repeat it. He didn't even place my drink cup nicely on the tray, he just tossed it on there and the outside of the cup felt sticky/ wet because he was previously bussing tables and cleaning counters before taking my payment. It was disgusting, he didn't even wash his hands. The drink bar is filled with coke product varieties and I usually get the horchata! When it comes to hot sauces if you come during dinner time the hot sauces are non-existent. There was an empty Cholula, Green Tabasco, and Tapatio bottle, and it wasn't refilled/ thrown away.

The salad was good. Actually, it was very good, but it wasn't worth what they were charging. I don't see the point of the flour tortilla bowl inside the metal to-go bowl, so that got thrown away, rather than eaten. 

The flavored teas were good but the lids on the cups don't stay on very well. Unfortunately, one of the power doors at school hit my cup out of my hand so it exploded all over my white skirt and white jacket. Yes, their tea does stain.

I love Chipotle too, but the reason why I would say I like Cafe Rio more is because of their green ranch, YUM! That ranch is something else. I smother my burritos in it and always choose it for my salad dressing - a gift from the gods. 

Another thing, I'm not entirely sure if Chipotle has Daily Specials or not, but if they do, Cafe Rio does a better job of advertising them. I love Cafe Rio's Daily Specials because they come with a free drink! Good deal, considering their menu is pretty pricy (the reason I withheld one star).

I am most particularly appreciative of this location because this Cafe Rio is right across the street from UNLV, so I never have to go far whenever I crave their food, which is ALWAYS. Haha. Big plus.

ALSO! Their ice!  For those of you who love icy cold drinks like me, I'm sure you are also fond of their ice. All other food establishments need to follow suit.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,1,1,4,oxRuROATh4eNSRY2xSwi8A
5718683,2014-06-01,1,WLblFINiPI18_o1OdDsnVg,"If you want stale and very dry hard rice you'd come to the right place! I was looking forward to trying something new since I usually go to Chipotle when I am craving Americanized Mexican food. I think I will be sticking to Chipotle for awhile.

The flour tortilla was really greasy, the guacamole was tasteless and expensive for 1 oz serving and was a shade of olive green, the rice was sooo hard like it wasn't cooked! Also, the black beans were overcooked and were clumpy and kinda dry. 

Overall I think their food just looks quiet unappetizing because the presentation along with what I tasted today were not good. Plus, the back of the house was kinda messy along with messy steam tables...if you have an open kitchen I'd recommend to keep it presentable.",TyepNPbEnMCy1_IhsT0YAg,3,1,1,VBEv288D7cOICvO-hhSDhw

After giving it a second shot, I tried the shredded chicken burrito (enchilada style, of course). DELICIOUS! I'm from Cali, where I was able to get delicious wet burritos from practically anywhere. This is about close as close to home as I've gotten. Also, I will say from a super Mexican standpoint, their horchata is amazing!

5876276,2017-10-23,10,WLblFINiPI18_o1OdDsnVg,"My roommate would die for a Cafe Rio steak burrito, so when he got to pick where we had lunch, it was a no brainer for him. Cafe Rio it was!

I had never been to this location, but it's super close to my house and has a huge parking lot, so that's a win. The venue is huge with lots of colorful tables and chairs. Seating wasn't an issue on a Sunday afternoon, but I'm not sure I could say the same thing for a weekday since it's right across the street from UNLV.

The service and food her are A-OK in my book. They make their tortillas from scratch and they are fantastic. I went for the grilled chicken burrito. You add your fillings as you go and they build it for you. Black beans, rice, meat or veggies of your choice and their salsa/sauce selection is on point. I went for the tomatillo sauce inside and on top and finished the enchilada style with their hot red sauce before they added the cheese and put it through the toasting warmer.

The service was friendly but a bit confusing and chaotic. I wasn't offered any extras and had to ask them to go back and add guacamole and their house dressing. Have you had their house dressing? It's almost like a ranch on steroids. A must have for all of your dipping pleasures.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,21,17,3,qVo2mrGv2KsuqmbIhvVKqg

5983711,2013-02-23,1,WLblFINiPI18_o1OdDsnVg,"This place seems like it's ALWAYS busy around lunch time and usually there isn't anywhere to sit unless you happen to catch people leaving and just grab their table and it isn't too dirty because I've never seen anyone come around and wipe tables down between customers.

The 4 stars come from food alone.  The homemade tortillas are amazeballs (and I don't even like tortillas, I'm a rice kinda girl).  The salad (basically an unwrapped burrito) is soooo good and huge.  I can barely finish 1/2 a salad.  I usually get a grilled chicken salad with everything on it.  I'd recommend getting the tortilla on the side though, because it'll get soggy at the bottom of your salad.  The green house ranch dressing thing they have is delicious as well.

I also like the drink and tea selection and I like that they encourage you to mix their drinks into different combinations.

Service at this location is just okay, nothing outstanding.

Also, if you have a sensitive stomach and GI tract, i would be cautious.  Some people end up getting Cafe Rio stomach (which is fairly comparable to Chipotle stomach) if you know what I mean.  If you don't, then don't worry about it!",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,4,0,4,DCeHwmEYgVGIKRAaFzESZA
