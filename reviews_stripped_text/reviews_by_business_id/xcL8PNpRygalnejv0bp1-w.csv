This place is awesome. Went for the taco plate (five tacos for $6.25). They are stuffed full of flavor and might be the best I've had so far in my quest for the best taco in Vegas. The restaurant, despite it's age and fast food atmosphere, is well maintained and clean. Great staff and the orders are made quick.   

It's worth nothing that they have a location on Jones and Charleston that also does a fantastic job. However, the tacos are not the same. The Trop location serves up a slightly different taco with a little more kick. 

Don't forget, help both the staff and yourself by hitting the tip jar when you order!",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,3,0,5,9Ik9gu4qtj-__ujTZbk0Iw

3411654,2014-11-18,7,xcL8PNpRygalnejv0bp1-w,"Most folks would comment that Tacos El Compita 3 is... How can I say this politely?....

A little ""Hole In The Wall'-ish? But before you knock it, you must try it. I randomly stopped by after class one day, maybe five months ago or so. It's nestled into a mini strip mall, barely bigger than the corner it is situated on. 

If you are zipping down Trop... Or blink, you might miss it. It's quite a bit easier to see at night, when you can see the lights on.

But anyway, I stopped in just to see if these little places are as good as people say. You know, the whole myth about the little random places being better than bigger ones or chains.

It seems as if the rumors are true! This place is awesome! You get loads of meat piled into your taco, no skimping at all. They have all the meats, even pastor. I had a Mulita the other day and it was fantastic. You can also get soda water out of their fill-it-yourself soda machine.

The prices are fair, and I have always received the most courteous service as well. If you are in the area, stop in and see what I'm talking about.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,10,7,5,2gFez02ZZWHNeuwuj4IXyQ

4107195,2015-10-08,5,xcL8PNpRygalnejv0bp1-w,"Ife A. was right. This place is legit.

If you pay attention when driving around, you've probably noticed that there are little taquerias all over town. Tacos El Compita #3 is one place that I've passed several times on the way to the nearby Cardenas. This taco shop is across the street from the Q Mall Swap Meet and is across the side street from the slightly more well-known Mariscos Vallarta. It's most likely the diamond in the rough of this tiny plaza, which otherwise merely has a check cashing place, a smoke shop, and a cakes-only bakery.

This is certainly a hole in the wall, but it has plenty of seating and is pretty clean. The employee at the register today speaks fluent English, which you can't take for granted at these joints. Most importantly, the food is awesome, the meats are plentifully portioned, and the cuisine is certainly not at all Americanized.

I finally did the math just now and realized that most of the tacos are the same price ($1.39) no matter if you pick the plate of 5 tacos or if you get one taco each. That's really cheap! I wanted to try six of their eight taco meats anyway, and they were still able to fit them all on the same plate. All of their tacos are served on two tortillas, which is standard, and come with a modest amount of salsa, cilantro, and onions. More of those are available at the condiment bar, which also includes jalapenos, surprisingly spicy pickled onions, pico de gallo, and lime wedges.

The lengua was my first taste, and it was one of my favorites. It's super tender and flavorful here, and it's only priced 25 cents higher than the other meats. I also enjoyed the buche about as much as my other recent favorite buche. It's fried and also bursts with flavor. The al pastor of El Compita is actually not served with pineapples. The employee said that they don't even have pineapple because it's simply not the recipe that they use. But I was converted after the first bite, which had tasty meat and marvelous caramelized onions. I couldn't stuff the rest of the taco in my mouth fast enough after that.

The tripas was quite good, although I'll have to ask for them to make it a little more crunchy next time before giving my final verdict. The cabeza wasn't overly impressive, especially since I tried it just after the lengua, but I'd probably get it again also. The asada was my least favorite, but it was still enjoyable aside from the lack of other accoutrements such as guacamole that you'll find at some taquerias.

Overall, I was very happy with my tacos, so I'll certainly return to Tacos El Compita #3. Maybe I'll even venture into other parts of their menu, which includes mulitas, tortas, and a few different Mexican stews.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,5,XcFr2X_l2cUsXf9xQ06NCg
