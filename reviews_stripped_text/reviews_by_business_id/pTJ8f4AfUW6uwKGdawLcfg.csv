I had the Bulgogi and it was decent, but the price was outlandish.  $30 for the exact same dishes that I have gotten at other Korean joints for $10-$15, that this was not worth double or triple the price.  The restaurant decor is really old and outdated and the places feels a little grimy.  I would skip this place.

It was an ok place. Nothing spectacular, even in food. I loved their gyozas though. We went during the grand opening promo period (which seems to be going on for a while....) so the price of $15 was fine. The grill was tiny, perfect for two persons. They bring out little portions at a time. Not recommended to have 4 hungry adults sharing one table. Would I go for the full price? Definitely not. Would I ever come back again? Likely not. 

If I had paid full price, I would've left pretty disappointed---could've gone elsewhere, paying a few bucks more for quality and quantity.

Five stars for friendly staff though.",9Kgz60mivLD10Xrs5WB5Zw,0,0,2,uCQ1q1VMeq4wyIcDF5IGtg

1018867,2014-08-02,1,pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg,"First AYCE Korean BBQ place that you can also get a combo with AYCE sushi, and just a $5 difference in price. 

After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant to come here. But, the service was definitely on point and not lacking in any sense. Everyone was extremely friendly and very attentive. 

We enjoyed the Kobe beef belly, brisket, pork belly, and the Galbi. At first the brisket was sticking to the metal grill so they switched it out to the crystal grill. That particular grill took awhile to heat up but the meat didn't stick one bit to it. I guess it just depends what you prefer because the crystal grill completely covers the open flame and the food takes just a little longer to cook on it. 

As for the AYCE sushi, we ordered the Spicy Tuna Salad, and a couple of nigiri sushi pieces. All were pretty good. No complaints. 

The pricing was $19.95 for AYCE Korean BBQ, and $24.96 for the AYCE Korean BBQ and Sushi. Both menus were pretty extensive and the meats offered were much better quality than other places I've been to.",jOW3BGthCDL3l7Dd6AWZtA,2,1,4,R4LZsA6QOYNZvQtnYfKTeA

First off, parking. IF this place ever gets off, where will all the customers park? Is everyone forced to carpool? because there are literally only 20 spots and its a cramped lot. Gotta fix that.
Secondly, service. Our service didn't suck as bad as everyone else's but it was still bad. I mean the servers try to be nice and all but they did forget a couple of dishes. I also don't mind them cooking for us, however  much of our food turned out burnt. boo.
Lastly but most importantly, the food was just not that good. I really like strong flavors and both the marinated bulgogi and galbi were too bland for my taste. The other meats were also too dry and chewy.. maybe an indication that stuff wasn't too fresh? There was also a lack of variety in the AYCE appetizers.

2114430,2014-10-06,0,pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg,"Shilla Korean BBQ has been around for quite sometime in the city of Las Vegas. I remember this being the first Korean BBQ restaurant I'd ever tried when my family first moved to Las Vegas in 2005. 

That being said, I fell in love with their potato salad which needless to say - is the only place in town that serves this as one of their appetizers. I'm too nervous however to ask the Korean women how they make it, I'm sure it's a secret recipe. 

I however, recently went back there with my older sister for Sunday supper and the place was completely dead (perhaps because it was Sunday and everyone was at church is what I'd like to assume)

Anyhow, I order the Kalbi Tang my sister order a Seafood Sundubu and it was great. The food is on point the establishment is clean and tidy.

2323012,2014-07-28,2,pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg,"Came last week for the grand opening special during lunch and thought it was ok. For about 12 bucks for AYCE Korean BBQ, the grand opening special is a great value and we thought the meats and some appetizers were really good, although service were a little lacking. Keeping in mind that this business is under new management, and there might be some kinks that need ironing out, I'm giving my experience a 3-star rating which was really difficult because...well...just read my review:

The interior is a little dated and it is super hot inside, most likely because there are grills on every table and everyone is grilling at the same time. Not sure if the big copper looking vents above each table work because they were silent, but I didn't think we smelled too bad after leaving which was good.

We got set up with a crystal grill top when we sat down that I thought was pretty cool and it definitely retained heat a lot better than a normal grill top and was non stick as well. I realized after talking to my friends that came on subsequent days that there were apparently 3 different types of grill tops but I think I would still prefer the crystal. I was still able to grill meat 15 min after the flame was turned off by one of the staff...this wouldn't have been possible on a traditional grill top. The secret is to wait until the crystal heats up before placing the meats on top. The staff did not allow us to heat up the grill after switching us out to a clean one and threw all our meat on top of the grill for us while it was still cold. This pissed us off, especially because we prefer to cook our own food and don't appreciate them butting in and grabbing our meat/tongs off the table, especially if they're going to screw it up and do it the wrong way. They also kept trying to serve us cooked meat with our tongs that had been used to touch and flip raw meat, making us a little uneasy. Not sure why they have to be so controlling!

Also, there appeared to be a language barrier and we were unable to get items that we needed such as napkins, water and sauce refills and additional orders. When the servers came by we attempted to communicate things that we needed each time. They would either have a confused look on their face or acknowledge us and then never return with the item requested. We asked about 4-5 times for more sauce before we got it. Same with napkins. One of the servers even blamed me for Michael K not having a plate even though she was the one that never brought him one! WTF! If I had to rate service alone, it'd be a 1 star rating for sure! Either bring a Korean speaking friend or expect to have to ask 4-5 times for everything you need.

Food quality was better than I had expected and the meats appeared fresh and well marinated. My favorites were the bone-in galbi and pork belly. Just don't let the staff see you cutting meat while it's raw or they will give you a lecture about waiting until it's cooked. Really? With scissors and tongs that have already been touching raw meat? This will also make them want to cook and serve your food for you....if I wanted that then I would have gone to Bennihana or something. 

With all the service issues I am not sure how they'll ever have a good customer service rating...because of this, they're definitely not worth more than their grand opening special and once their price goes back up to normal I would not come back or recommend this place because you'll be here forever trying to grill and eat just 2 plates of meat due to service issues and waiting on your orders, drinks, napkins, sauce, etc.

I also would not recommend doing both sushi and BBQ together...pick one or the other and sit at the designated section. Tony T sat with us in the room with all the table grills and it took him forever to get his sushi orders and some of them were wrong or confused for something else. If you want sushi, go sit at the sushi bar near the front door!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,3,1,3,Pizkmc2vH7YLhfzZ1Al9iw

Due to their surrounding area Ive never thought of trying Shilla until now. Since they were offering an almost half off grand reopening special why not. 

When I got there for weekend lunch I had no problem with parking, even got one closest to the door. When I left it was about half capacity. If it ever gets to a point where they were out of parking in their parking lot then theres some street parking along the front.

The interior seemed nice. There were 3 dining areas one for sushi, one for KBBQ , and another I don't remember. I could be wrong but some of the decor seeemed more Japanese. Its just something I noticed, didnt bother me or anything.

So down to business. I came here to chow down on some Korean BBQ and by chow down I mean eat until I cant move or they kick me out. Round 1 was a good quantity of thinly sliced beef brisket. The quality was excellent. Our cooking surface was a clear crystal thing which I was kind of doubting how it would cook the meats but it actually worked out well, no big raging flare up, no big clouds of smoke that gets in your closes, and it cooked the meats about the same as your normal metal grilling surface. Back to the beef brisket. It taste so good that it really didnt need any seasoning except if you wanted it a little spicy you can dump some hot sauce on it. Since it was thinly sliced it cooked in a matter of seconds.

Round 2 short ribs! I love short ribs especially korean style short ribs. I dont even remembered how many I ate. It wasnt to overly marinated and again an excellent quality meat.  Some people like them cooked all the way with it tough and charred, not me, I'll cook it until right before it charred.

Round 3 pork belly. Its pork belly just cook it and all in the world is right once you start eating. Not gonna lie but after completing Round 3 I was sweating a little cause it was getting hot and I was filling up. Took a little break to wipe the sweat off my face and said I have to do Round 1-3 again with the same quantity. 

Round 4 and 5 was a breeze. Then they decided to offer some beef belly also so here they brought a plate full of beef belly. So Round 6 was a huge portion of nothing but beef and pork belly. It was a pretty greasy Round 6 but it was so good, I needed soda and some salad to cut the grease. I was actually thinking of doing it all over again but after seeing almost everyone arrive and leave while I was feasting for 2 hrs straight I felt like they wanted me to STOP. Well they didnt have a time limit but if they do later on, my bad.

The sides were OK though I really didn't try to fill up on it, wasted stomach space. There werent a lot of variety and the quality wasnt the best Ive had but edible.

The service for most part were pretty good. They occasionally placed meats on the grill and cut them. They refilled drinks, sides, and plates of meat. There were a couple hiccups but nothing I'd ding them too much on. When I wanted to start drinking soda in the middle of eating the elderly lady seemed to have forgotten and I had to ask another person to bring it. When I wanted the bill they took forever.

Overall, at least for the AYCE KBBQ option, I'll give them a 4 star cause thats the only option that mattered to me. I'll be back again even when the price is regular, the quality is better than any of the other AYCE KBBQ places Ive been to in Vegas.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,6,5,4,SVuANkSiUPSxvkWGkXX8Hg

It's a good place to come on discounted terms, but we won't be back anytime soon since it's at regular pricing now. 

We were lucky enough to try out their grand opening Lunch Special $12.95 AYCE BBQ - we were hesitant to try the sushi since it was just way too hot in there. The honest truth is, we would only eat here again if the prices stay that way. The regular pricing is absurd. The meal isn't worth that much, it's average. 

We ended up with the poorly designed gold plated grill and it was also tiny. You can barely fit your meats on there, let alone the veggies that come on the plate. Also, it burned quickly. Oh wells, at least they changed the grills out if needed. 

They don't have duk bo sam (rice noodle squares) or the vinegared radish sheets to legitimately wrap up your meats and sides, but they do offer rice. In the end, we didn't miss it all too much. 

Here's what we selected from the lunch AYCE menu: 

APPETIZERS:
- Gyeran jjim (steamed egg soufflé) - the egg was very fluffy, airy, delicate and flavorful. I enjoyed it.
- Doenjang ji gae (soybean paste stew with tofu, vegetables, beef) - on the weaker and watery side, but it was still piping hot and perfect to sip and wash down the greasy meat. 
- Gyoza (dumpling) - hot and crispy, but the filling was boring. I wouldn't order this again, it's just a filler.
- Japchae (sweet potato noodles mixed beef and vegetables in season) - the noodles and vegetables were cooked well and plentiful, but it was bland. We drizzled some of the gyoza sauce on top, mixed it up and voila! It was awesome! 

MEATS:
- Bulgogi (thinly sliced eye beef marinated in bbq sauce) - the meat was mildly seasoned but it was tender.  
- Yangyum galbi (short rib marinated in bbq sauce) - this was the best cut of our meal. Tender and lightly seasoned. Dip it into the seasoned sesame oil for a flavor explosion! 
- Samgyubsal (think sliced pork belly) - not terrible, but pretty chewy.

**they didn't have usamgyop available (Kobe beef belly) :(

BANCHAN:
- The sides were all super bland and lacking so much flavor. The best one had to be the Kimchi, but it was weak. We ended up grilling them and they tasted so much better! 
- Salad - the dressing was great. Very flavorful, tangy, and well seasoned. 
- Sauces were decent, but you need to ask for the seasoned sesame oil with salt and pepper. It really turns up the bland meat and wakes up the flavor!

The service was friendly but chaotic. It's hard to get anyone's attention when you need something. We had to yell loudly a few times since they couldn't even hear us over the loud grills. They forgot to bring us our rice that we ordered, but we ended up not needing it anyways.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,10,10,3,nm3mgec4Tdo-C0E9t-gZkA

It was around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night and the place was mostly deserted.  We thought it might be closed, but the door was unlocked so in we went.  The decor was kind of old and cheesy.  It reeked of BBQ and the floor was properly greasy like most Korean BBQ places, so we decided to stay.  The service was adequate.  They only served Korean and American beer.  I asked my friend what he'd like, but he couldn't make up his mind.  We settled on standard fare:  Bulgogi and Kalbi, Kim chee jigae and Hite beer.

2797506,2014-07-27,7,pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg,"Before you come here, lets get the most important thing out of the way.

GET YOURSELF THE ROSETTA STONE KOREAN LANGUAGE LEARNING PROGRAM OR BRING SOMEONE THAT SPEAKS KOREAN!

Apparently, these guys are trying to be so authentic that they hired Korean staff that hardly speaks any english. I asked for a fork and dude says, ""You want spicy pork?"" I said yes because I love spicy pork but at the same time I really wanted a fork because I am chopstick challenged. I dont have any patience to use that crap.

Anyways, I came here because of their grand opening special of AYCE bbq 12.95 for lunch and 15.95 for dinner. Add 5 dollars more if you want AYCE sushi with that. Come August 1st its going up to 20.95 for lunch and 25.95 for dinner. The 5 dollar sushi AYCE sushi option still applies.

Keep in mind that you pick out what you want on the menu and they bring it out to you on plates. It's not like Sura where you get up and get whatever you want and bring it back to your table. 

We ordered Short Ribs, Brisket, Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Chicken. The short ribs and Barbequed Steak (which they were out of) are only available for dinner. All that we ordered was really good except for the chicken which was kind of dry. 

Besides the language barrier as the first major disappointment, im sorry to say that there were more to add to it. One was the parking or should I say lack there of. The parking lot is small and the spaces are narrow. Dont be surprised if your car has a few more dings or dents when you come out to leave. I recommend parking on the street. Next, the grills they have you use are gold colored and are not designed properly. When cooking fatty foods like Pork Belly, there is no place for all the excess oil to drain except the sides of the grill where they can catch fire. Ours did and we had to turn off the fire so they can extinguish the flames. One of the bussers came up and sprayed some kind of all purpose cleaner to put the fire out but it caused it to flare up and almost burn our faces. Im glad I didnt get burned or there would have been a severe lawsuit pending. All they could say was, ""Oh, sorry"". From that point on, our server would come by and mop up any excess oil off the grill with napkins. Really? I dont ever recall any Korean Bbq joint doing this.

I would also like to mention that they have these crystal grills that you can use as well. We were not offered this option and would have turned it down anyway because of my friends that tried it several days ago said it sucked.

Some random info: Hours are 11 am to 12 midnight every day. Lunch is from 11 to 3 pm. Dinner is 3 pm to closing (12 midnight). Makes me wonder if you can sneak in right at 2:45 to get charged lunch price and get dinner items. If you try it and it works, let me know. Lol. Also, dont eat here if you are wearing nice clothes or are planning to go to a nice or formal event. The smoke from the barbeque stays in your hair and clothes. I made the mistake of eating at a Korean barbeque restaurant right before going to a graduation ceremony. Everybody was looking around wondering if somebody was barbequeing somewhere close by and ironically thats what people wanted to eat for dinner as soon as the event ended. 

So in closing, I suggest that if you wanna try this place out, bad service and all, now would be the time because of the promo price. Then, you can decide if its worth any future trips when they charge regular price. For me that's a negative captain.

We've had 4 star Korean & we've had 1 star sushi all at the same time here.  Skip the sushi altogether. Stale fish.  The bbq was decent.  Wagyu beef belly, short ribs & spicy pork were good.  Some of the flavors left much to be desired.  There are tons of worker bee's making sure the drinks were full.  Service was funny and pleasant.  We were going to be seated in a booth then a manager said, ""Oh we put them in da tabol, he's a beeg boi."" hahaha.  Being a pacific islander I don't take offense.  We had our meats placed on the grill for us.  I had to flag them down to, uh, turn the grill on haha.  Growing pains.  They were all trying very hard, so I appreciate that.  Towards the end some actually ""biig boys"" came in and they had to be seated at the other end of our table.  Those guys..  Big haas and bubba immediatly began oogling our grill.  I'm sure our meat felt violated, hahahaa.

This is an odd pairing of a Japanese Sushi Bar with a Korean BBQ place.  I've never tried the Japanes food but I've had a chance to eat here 2 or 3 times for a Korean fix in my regular trips to Vegas to visit my family.  

The Blu Go Gi, the Kal Bi, and Dae Ji Bul Go Gi are very good.  You have a choice of cooking (i believe) but we've always been too hungry to cook and just had the kitchen prepare everything.

Pros:
+ quality food!
+ plentiful parking
+ good service

Cons:
- typically empty restaurant
- high prices for Korean food (but the quality is good!)",ASvjSBCYRd4GhOtSIn8Gyw,9,3,4,0mCtAL1od3TH80X_RpLnvw

It's my favorite Korean dish to this day- an egg on top of, tender beef, mixed vegetables, spinach, and kimchee, over white rice and hot sauce- that you mix all together, served in a stainless bowl. 

We used to come here for the lunch special- shrimp fried rice- which really sounds weird to get here, but it's really good. They don't offer the special on holidays, so we stopped coming (yet the sign advertising it still stands outside). (I went here with a friend for the sushi special but he didn't like it.) The service is ok. Usually, there is maybe two other parties at most, like the other reviewers mentioned. The server would disappear, maybe to the other side, which is a sushi bar. I also agree with one of the reviewers that this place needs a makeover or something because it looked a little tired the last time. 

There are so many other Korean restaurants now that I would rather go elsewhere.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,3,AjvBSkYVIJGC66N-oQHoNg

1 meal @ Dinnertime

LAYOUT
small, adequate wooden furniture...  some tear in booth seating.   i was seated near the bathroom and noticed a mildew and strange odors.^^;

SERVICE/FOOD
prompt, attentive, and friendly...  my waiter was VERY talkative after he found out my party knew about the Nintendo/Atari era.^^;

the food was not bad and the sides and salads were surprisingly good.   but the mildew and odors may have ruined an otherwise good meal. T.T

PRICING
average.^^  actually, kinda lower than average...  maybe the owners of Shilla knew about the sub-par LAYOUT and decided to save themselves with good pricing.

CLOSING
a good meal cannot substitute for a bad overall experience.   i'm willing to pay a couple more dollars for less smell and better furniture.^^;",nxtqjMAPbIyJT2-0rYFUbA,1,1,3,jDtDYnWbgSv7Ci0EdGhbpg

Overall, one star is just enough. BBQ section smelled so bad (not enough ventilation) and so hot! I was sweating a lot and I still can smell BBQ from my clothes and from my hair.
Food was not good too. They lie to customers who don't know what Kobe beef is. They DO NOT have Kobe beef, just cheap junk to eat. Only four side dishes came, tasted so so. Fountain drink tasted metalic, and I saw no bubbles at all. It seemed like there were many servers, but no one checked our table while we were eating although they came back so fast when I asked for the check. 
I had to call the server a few times to get more salad.

4835451,2014-07-26,2,pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg,"I really wanted to enjoy this place, but there was too many things that were wrong during my visit here.

A buddy of mine and myself came here and we both got the AYCE bbq and sushi. We both ordered some baked mussels, I happened to try the first one, and it was cold and had a bad taste. We let the waiter know and he apologized for them. My buddy ordered a soft shell crab, and when my buddy cut into it, the insides oozed out, and he stated that it had a bad smell. The waiter took it and apologized yet again. My buddy also ordered some dynamite and it never came out during our whole time there. We let the waiter know again, and he apologized for all the mistakes with our orders during our visit when we left.

The sushi we got was okay. Our philly roll had a exceptional amount of cream cheese in it. We couldn't really taste the salmon or avocado because of it. The yellow tail nigiri and tiger roll we got was okay.

Half of the bbq we ordered was pretty good. The galbi and pork belly was the two things we continuously ordered and enjoyed. My buddy liked the octopus they had, but it was too salty for my tastes. The other bbq we had didn't have a whole lot of flavor and just tasted like cooked meat, like the kobe beef belly and the spicy marinated pork.

One of the most annoying things during our visit was how overzealous a female server there was. We repeatedly told her we were fine with grilling our own meat, and she consistently continued to mess with our meat we would be cooking and adjust the fire for our grill without our permission. We even noticed her talking to our male server, looking in our direction with a disgusted look on her face. We figured she didn't like how we were cooking the food we paid for.

If it wasn't for the cool, attentive, and apologetic male server we had, I would give this place 0 stars if I was able to. Between the sushi that didn't stand out, the undercooked and possibly spoiled appetizers we were repeatedly served, obnoxious waitress, forgotten or lost orders, and the inconsistent quality bbq, there isn't much reason that I have to come back to this place.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,3,1,1,VCj7IbP51XcszpT0i8IfKw

Whenever we've been it's always been a 99% Korean clientele -- with us being the 1%. Prices are not cheap, but no more than what you would pay in the LA/OC area. Just a thought since I don't particularly like to eat on the strip at the hotels where everything is overpriced and often, not really all that good. Plus, it's the same stuff over and over again.

4983358,2010-03-01,0,pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg,"During my last trip to Las Vegas, I decided it was time for some authentic Korean food off the strip. Looking for a good Korean bbq restaurant, I found this place with the yelp app on my phone. The place had a four-star rating so I thought it should be at least decent.

Boy was I wrong. The place was ill-maintained with run-down furniture and dirty bathroom. I don't mind an old venue if the food is good but even the food was mediocre at best. Price was extremely high and there are no combination deals! I've eaten at some of the best Korean bbq restaurants but none which charges per plate of meat with no combo. We ordered kalbi & chadol (two types of meat) with soup and the bill came out to nearly $70. Once again, if the food was good, I would've been okay but the meat quality was mediocre and service was unprofessional. We were the only customer there from beginning to end and I now understand why. The owner lady was disgruntled, not-at-all friendly and there is absolutely no service whatsoever.  

I walked into the bathroom after the mediocre meal and was surprised to find old water spots everywhere (looks like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks) with one stall closed (God knows what was in there). If I'm paying for meat that run $20-30 per plate, I expect good service & good food in sanitary conditions. This place failed in all areas. For those of you who hasn't had really good korean bbq, this place may seem okay but I would never consider this place a 4-star dining experience.

We checked out Jin-Mee (another Korean restaurant) the next day and this place had much better prices and food. I'm extremely dissatisfied with the misleading 4-star review of this place and encourage its management to improve (I mean greatly improve) their management all around to stay competitive.",-J2u3687TUp2YAk_RkA3AA,0,0,2,zbapBtFO6J5En3Rsjsc-2w

5492560,2014-07-24,6,pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg,"This 3 star rating is based on what the prices will be after the end of July.  For the current grand opening prices of $15.95 for dinner AYCE sushi or korean bbq and $12.95 for lunch, I would give it 4 stars.  

We decided just to opt for the korean bbq by itself.  AYCE Korean BBQ and sushi is available for $5 extra which is a nice option that other restaurants in Vegas do not have.  The Korean BBQ and sushi sections are separated.  This is a good thing, since the Korean BBQ area is HOT! I'm a little sensitive to warm temperatures and with all the grills going, it really seemed like the AC wasn't working properly and the vents over each table weren't working properly.  The decor is a little dated and has an old school feel, which matches the location of this restaurant.

The cuts of meat I feel were average and on par with all the other AYCE Korean restaurants.  The galbi, kobe beef belly, boneless short rib (dinner only) were the best cuts of the night.  The pork belly was pretty average.  The barbeque steak (dinner only) was horrible and a waste of stomach space.  It ended up being tough and dry (and no it was not the cooking technique).  Other options available that we didn't get a chance to try are the chicken, marinated pork, bulgogi, brisket, octopus, intestine.  On the AYCE appetizer menu, there's steamed egg, gyoza, crisped rice, mixed tempura, and chap chae.  The ban chan selection was average with kim chee, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and a sweet marinated dried fish.

So don't be fooled by the picture of the crystal cooking plate in the pictures, out of the 10 tables that were there, only one lucky table got to use it.  By far it is not the standard.  Most of the cooking plates are these gold colored plates that burn and stick badly compared to the cast iron ones at other locations.  They did change out the plate once for us since I turned it off because it was smoking so badly.  One older asian lady was outraged that she was not given the crystal plate and went up to the staff and complained loudly.  They ushered her back to the table and quieted her....not sure what the response was in regards to one table getting the magical crystal plate.  I did notice the crystal plate didn't smoke and burn like the older gold cooking plates.  So overall, great value for the current grand opening price.  For $25.95 for AYCE korean BBQ and $29.95 for AYCE korean bbq and sushi later....I'd probably pass.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,8,7,3,LCl9RdqKC9zdtqWZyLD_hQ

So we ventured to the Korean BBQ place that we found through Yelp.  Not all the reviews were favorable but we gave it a shot 

There was a decent amount of space for parking and immediately found a parking spot.  As we entered the establishment, we were quickly greeted and asked about our dining needs.  We told him that we wanted Korean BBQ and was led to our table amongst many other BBQ diners.  As we sat down, we were asked for our drink requests -- easy, waters (3x) please.  A very pleasant young woman came to our table and handed us the menus.  The prices were very reasonable and they even had a AYCE Korean BBQ & Sushi/Sashimi combo.  Again, the prices were very reasonable and to our surprise, they were having a promotion of giving $5.00 discount off the prices we saw printed on the menus.

We told her that we wanted the AYCE Korean BBQ.

Minutes later, our drinks arrived which was followed by the usual Korean side dishes -- Mmmmm kimchi and spicy lettuce/salad.

Let the AYCE Korean BBQ begin.

We ordered 2 AYCE dinners and 1 1/2 price AYCE dinner for our son.

First round:
 - Beef Bulgogi
 - Samgyubsal (pork belly)
 - Dak Bulgogi (chicken)
 - Jukoomi (baby octopus)
 - Gyeran Jjim (steamed egg casserole)
 - Gyoza (dumplings)

Second round:
 - Joomulluk (boneless short rib)
 - Saeng Deung Sim (steak)
 - Steamed rice

Third round:
 - Chadol (beef brisket)
 - Galbi (short rib w/ bone)
 - Gyeran Jjim

After all that, we called it quits and asked for the check.  All throughout the dining period, we were checked upon, they made sure that we had our meats available for cooking.  In general, we were quite pleased with the entire experience.

As we got up from our table and proceeded toward the exit, we were asked to come again.  Unfortunately, we leave for home (Maryland) the next day.

I will make a note of it to visit the place again when the opportunity presents itself.",DT8ZsgmKCHNGak1gJq0leA,2,1,5,cY9cFXGas-unWT6x9uP94A
