NOT the case for Rocco's NY Pizza. 

Penne Marinara on point! Pasta cooked perfectly. Sauce very thick and flavorful. Portion size enough for two. 

Chicken & Broccoli Alfredo, Amazing. Not only is the  sauce delicious, you get the taste of fresh broccoli, nice in color as well. 

French Bread nice and fluffy on the inside, crisp and flakey on the outside. 

6 Garlic knots, I thought could use a little more garlic. BUT my gf thought they were amazing. They were pretty big and nicely baked to a golden brown. 

Antipasto Salad!!! Omg! I will order that everytime I go back. Crisp lettuce, fresh veggies, big portion! The best part though, the ham, salami, provolone & prosciutto!!! Amazing!!!

I paid with c/c and when the food came the delivery driver was very embarrassed and told us to complain. The two slices were in brown bag stuck inside by the cheese. The two  heros were cold and very messy the way they were wrapped. I am very sick and didn't want to call because I deal with them and thought he was a nice guy. I was trying to telI him  the owner to know what happened last time and how driver was badmouthing the way the way the owner was too cheap to put pizza in a small box.

I had ordered beforehand and when I got there I realized my card had expired and I had no cash. I tried to leave but the man at the counter came after me and handed me the food I ordered, at least 30$ worth, insisting I take it even though I couldn't pay. I'm not poor, just irresponsible, and he did the nicest thing a person could do, even though he had no idea what was going on in my life and probably just thought I was an absent-minded, silly girl who forgot that cards expire (which was true).

The cheese pie consists of classic foldable slices and though the sauce to cheese ratio is a bit different every time, that just makes it more true to form since that's the case in NY too. They also offer fresh salads and a long list of pasta and chicken entrees. To go is just as delicious as eating in, but they do offer booth and table seating for those who just can't wait. The slice/soda lunch specials can't be beat and you can admire the NY decor as you dine. Service is fast and friendly but don't call too late, most days they close at 9pm.

It was flavorful, rich, a decent portion and affordable. Seriously, it was REALLY good. The pizza was tasty, with a flavorful crust. I have had slightly better in this area, but it was good and very reasonably priced. Unlike some competitors that want to charge almost $20 for a pizza (INSANE), Rocco's pizza was certainly worth the $12.99. The veal parmesan sandwich was also delicious and firm. I find that this kind of sandwich often comes pretty mushy from other places. The Eggplant and Red Pepper Stromboli was good too. Not as flavorful as the other items, but the dough was chewy and it was satisfying with the marinara sauce for dipping. We ordered late on a Friday night through Eat24, and the delivery time was pretty long. This was not a problem, because it was our fault for ordering so late. They were busy and the time was disclosed to us. A woman who worked for the restaurant (not sure if she was an owner or not) called right around the time that the app projected we would get our food to apologize for the late delivery. I thought this was wonderful customer service, considering that the food wasn't late. I mean, it was almost 10:00, but that's what time we were given. Very apologetic and courteous.

As expected, only change to the restaurant is basically the name.  It's still a mom/pop Italian restaurant focused on pizza.  I went with the two slice special ( w/drink, $5; toppings $1 extra ) 

It's an OK slice - decent size, good crust, sauce is average, they too ( is this a trend ) cut the sausage in long slices, (almost look like it's peeled ) which I am not a fan of ( give me the bite size chunks )

I will return to try other items on the menu.",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,6,3,3,Ljg2lLKS99qmIYq7vCFMMQ

I also saw someone complain about $2 drinks and 10 min for a pizza. You pay $1.80 for a drink at a gas station and can't refill it and 10 min for a pizza is fast! If you waited less time for a pizza before, you ate it raw sweetheart.

1175628,2017-08-20,0,j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w,"S. Rainbow location. 

Food is great. Customer service is not. Authentic NY pizzeria indeed! Rocco's is near my office, and last year I decided to give it a try. The folks that work there weren't rude, they just didn't show much appreciation that I decided to patronize their establishment. However, It's the food that has brought me back again and again. I should clarify. I am by no means an expert on their menu, but can vouch for the Stromboli. I have visited other pizza places around the valley and am disappointed every time that the Stromboli is not more like Rocco's. It may take a while to make and it's a bit pricey but it's worth it (call ahead to limit your wait). 

The facility has a family owned feel. The walls are lined with photos from New York as well as, what I assume to be, family photos from the owner. Order at the counter. Food is brought to your table on real plates, and metal utensils (rather than disposable paper/plastic). They have a television in the dining area that is always tuned to either news or sports. They have a self service soda fountain with limited options from Coca-Cola. The pizza and Stromboli are made in full view so watch if you like. 

I have visited Rocco's a dozen or so times since that first visit and it has become one of my favorite places to have lunch. I wasn't blown away by the service, but the food was good enough to get me to come back. By now I have become familiar enough with the staff that they know me. They greet me with a smile when I arrive and wish me well when I leave. The casual environment and good food make it a great break from the proverbial, ""rat race"". If you are considering Rocco's, I say, give them a shot. And If you had a bad experience, please give them another chance to get it right. I hope they do.",t2_RGo7MREUyuVVmvXATgg,0,0,4,--w7t2rCZV6dqIhRliRVag
1189246,2013-05-06,0,j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w,"The pizza is good, probably better than most places in the area, but it's not 4 or 5 star pizza.  I have been here a few times and will be back again, mainly because it's convenient and better than most other choices in the area at this price point.  I think what holds it back from the next level is that I am a fan of sausage pizza and their sausage is not very flavorful and I always feel like there should be more cheese (even when I order extra cheese).

All that being said, they have a lot more on their menu than pizza and it does look very good.   I have ordered their Chicken Champagne in the past and thought it was very good.   I have also picked up a loaf of french bread before and it is about as good as would hope.  

Bottom line:  If you work or live in the area, it's worth checking out, you may even like it better than I did, but don't expect to have the best pizza you have ever eaten.",yiCegiFYduAc7tvbZ9udKg,2,0,3,u01nvHETuweVje_f3gblFg

Meanwhile, I waited another 10 minutes before my slice of plain cheese pizza was reheated and brought out to the table. I asked them to start my meatball sub later because I was taking it to-go. Unfortunately, it was ready well before the Zeppoles. Still not sure why, but the Zeppoles, which is just powdered sugar on small pieces of fried dough, took 40 minutes.
The Zeppoles were small and too chewy when I finally did get them. They were very different from the ones I've had from the Windmill location. Disappointing.

I'll just state it that way.
When I finally ""clued in"" (after Rocco's had been open for about three months) and told him about a new pizza challenge he jumped out of his chair and grabbed his keys ""LETS GO""! So we drove right down the street to :) Rocco's!!! 
We started off with an order of six garlic knots, they were yummy, they are baked and light on the garlic. Not bad! We have had some that were fried or something before, those are ick. These are baked and we are garlic crazy, maybe next time I will say HEAVY on the garlic ;)
We ordered a Caesar salad and it was very good. Not too much dressing and the dressing was not thick or too fishy. It had a nice acid of lemon yum.
We both ordered bottles of water which I later noticed you can order fountain or tap also.
And then *music* the pie!!!! 
Yum! I will have to say its darn near close to perfection.
Our cheese pizza pie was cooked to perfection. Crispy edged, soft middle, thin NY style, light on the sauce, light on the cheese, light on the spices...just like I have had in Brooklyn! Actually it was Manhattan... :) *hides*
The owners??? were super duper nice and def from NY :) You feel welcome and just like part of the family after speaking to them. They asked our name and if we had been to a Rocco's here. 
Nope.

Even the interior decor of b/w framed poster is unmistakably New York New York; it is homey and warm without the crowd and the lines of a neighborhood pizzeria.

A ""Hello"" when I walked-in was very welcoming and they had ESPN on so the sporty feel was nice too.

And then the order...

My spaghetti sauce is weak and watery; maybe it's just me but I want my tomato to be on the creamy, if not fresh and homemade (it does not help when they have the BIG can of tomato sauce on DISPLAY next to the counter). On the bright side, I think the pasta is texturally good and the meatball is a big ball of fun worth trying again.

I've never tried their pizza but it looks big and cheesy thin. You can get two slices and a drink for _____.

And then the bathroom...

I've always had a love for pasta, got the thighs to prove it. Haha. 
I can honestly say Rocco's NY pizzeria is hands down the BEST pasta I have ever eaten. The Alfredo sauce is the best I've ever tasted. Fancy restaurants need to come here and take cooking lessons. We ate the chicken broccoli Alfredo pasta. The portion was well worth every penny, generous amount of chicken and the broccoli cooked to perfection. The pasta also comes with a side of bread that was perfect for dipping into the Alfredo sauce. And Sauce was homemade, always a plus. 
I bought the pasta for my 2year old but it ended up feeding my husband, 2 year old and I. 
Wait time was quick. Go see Saira, she was helpful and friendly.

First impression was screams new york new york with its decor all around and talk about long island or new york accent. Everyone there must be from new york or close by feel like in the city.

I was thinking about going with fellow yelpers the white sauce pizza but more of pepperoni and red sauce guy. So order large pie with pepperoni and also order of caesar salad all too go. The wait was not that long because the place was for the most part empty works well for me! The caesar salad was average at best nothing special about it. The dressing felt like could have used more garlic and anchovies plus more dressing tossed in it. Too be fair I like my salad with decent amount of dressing not drowning but enough all the greens are covered or well tossed in it. The pizza again felt like it was nothing special but ok. The crusts on the end ok, like the thin style pizza and bottom of the pie was perfect, the red sauce was good, and pepperoni was good. They do offer LOT of different special student specials, 2 cheese slice pizza with soda ($4.99), or large 16' cheese pizza for ($9.99). All day long believe. They have nice display for their desserts. 

Overall just felt like everything was just ok. IT doesn't mean I would never go back because do like fact they sell pizza by the slice unlike Grimaldi. But in the end still nothing SPECIAL about the pizza here and without doubt not in the same ballpark as Grimaldi.

I had the chicken and broccoli fettuccine alfredo. My picture isn't a true representation, it was worst. The noodles were very under cooked. Under cooked pasta noodles are good if they were freshly made but when they're out the box or bag cook it longer. It was partially transparent in the middle, crunchy and gummy in other parts. It was like eating those Asian microwavable chow mein dishes but for pasta. It took me forever to finish it not because of it size but because it was just bad, even tried letting it maybe cook in its sauce but it never happened. I didn't care for the chicken pieces and sauce it was more like they cutted up half of a 6 piece chicken McNuggets box and added a bad bottled or canned alfredo sauce. The only positive thing about the dish was the broccoli seemed fresh, bright green and had a nice crisp when bitten into. 

A few in the group ordered some calzones. Right out of the oven and before they started eating it I was thinking that they're a nice smaller than usual calzones that I'd be back for.  However after noticing that 2 of the calzones weren't finished it seemed like maybe it's not that good. It seemed like the cheese was mostly left in the plates, it didn't look so tasty.

Their strombolis and pizzas did look really good these were ordered and left without a trace on the plates of those who ordered them. Maybe I'll be back for these.  They have a 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink special for about $5. Their Fra Diavolo also looked good from across the table, it had pasta, mussels, and a red sauce. I liked that they displayed the actually pizza,  strombolis, and calzones on the counter because they just look so good. They have these signs on the walls saying in big letters that they have best of various things and deals they have, it makes you want to get them and prove em wrong or right.

They bottom was burnt and the overall taste just blah. Pizza hut is better. I think this place is a chain so maybe we picked the wrong one, but I don't plan on coming back to this place.",Oi0G3jFm2jtG2W02dZTdEQ,2,1,2,W4uf-0Oxi-ao5yVB96UHiA

I'm a big fan of mom n pop pizza places. They are usually much better than the chain spots and your business is appreciated.  Rocco's is a pretty standard pizzeria, offering subs, pastas, desserts and of course pizza with a wide assortment of toppings and sauces. They have an interesting spin on a bloody mary where you can get their vodka infused meat sauce; definitely want to try that out next time I stop by. They put their actual ingredients out on a shelf for everyone to see, its reassuring and good to know that the food is made from scratch. 

I was looking for a quick lunch and I had the $5 pizza special: 2 slices of cheese and soda, I added pepperoni for a buck more. The pizza was ok... very greasy and floppy, could have used a few more minutes in the oven. The slices were big and I was satisfied but not impressed. Avoid getting ranch if you like that with your pizza, for .85 cents they gave me a store bought pack of salad dressing. SMH

About 5 or so minutes later she finally pick up. She took our order and told us it was going to be about 20 minutes. About 25 minutes later we arrived and went inside to pay, she explained that the order was not ready and we asked that if we paid would she be able to bring it out to the car. She said no problem so we went back to the car. After waiting about another 20 minutes in the car we called up and was told it would be about 3 more minutes or so. Approximately 5 to 8 minutes later they came out and gave us our order. The man who came out explained that the guys that make the pizza weren't in today. Before we even left the parking lot we opened the pizza to see what it looked like. I had never seen an oval pizza before but that is what we got.

This location has made several mistakes with our orders and with overcharging us and they did so again a few days ago. We placed the order electronically as to avoid any possible communication mistakes and they still got it wrong (it was a small order for 2 people).
When my husband went to pick it up they gave him a HUGE attitude bc he paid with American Express (they complained that AE charges them higher fees than Visa and asked him to look in his wallet for another card or cash).
On top of that, even though we had paid online, they rang it up again and threw in extra charges (besides incorrectly preparing the order). Unfortunately my husband didn't notice until he got home.

Don't waste your money here. I had a few bites of my pizza and eggplant parm and am throwing both out.

Maybe they were just having a bad night when I wrote my 1st review because I have eaten here since & it's all good now :) everything has been on point & good thing 'cause the Buffalo location won't let you order delivery after 8pm even though they don't close until 9pm. Also they screwed up my order the last 2 times I called for delivery in time. 
It sucks too since I have really enjoyed their food & have been a loyal customer for literally 20years & bringing everyone I know to eat there! Off the top of my head I can name a dozen people who eat there and/or order Roccos on a regular basis due to me introducing them to it - But to say No delivery at 8pm on a Friday night when you close at 9pm?!  Quite disappointing & seriously unacceptable. I'd understand if they stopped taking orders around 830p but 8pm on a Friday?!! YOU ARE KILLING YOUR OWN BUSINESS & LOSING YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS! They might as well have said 
Go F Yourself! We don't need your business! Roccos has great pizza & luckily, ALL of the Roccos locations are great & the owners of the other locations are actually concerned that you have a positive experience unlike the Buffalo/Charleston location. I hate being insulted by a place I'm patronizing & spending my hard earned money. Who needs that shit?! Especially when there's a bazillion other joints to choose from! I guess they make so much money before 8pm that they don't have to care about their clientele -well la tee frickin dah! Bully for you! I'll starve to death before giving money to an establishment that takes their customers for granted /treating us carelessly.
Later Skater! 

Normally I can't say a bad word about Roccos. Unfortunately Sunday I tried to order but it was 740pm so they wouldn't take a delivery order so i ordered from another location that was open until 9pm ~ 1 large pizza, eggplant parmigiana with pasta, penne alla vodka, & 1/2 lb butter cookies. After ordering I received a call stating that my cookies didn't make it with the driver but that another driver would deliver them. When I opened the order, the penne vodka didn't even resemble what I've  ordered 1000's of times before! Instead of tiny pieces of pancetta, there were huge chunks of beef! The sauce was decent but the beef was not. Plus it wasn't even penne! It was mostaccioli! I know they're similar but they're still different. I've NVR heard of beef in penne alla vodka though! Then the 2nd delivery guy shows up with the cookies. Open the bag & voila! Rainbow cookies dip'd in fudge or chocolate- not at all something I'd eat or order. Idk what happened but either way it is NOT what i ordered! WTF! You call me 2 times AFTER I order but failed to mention the beef or the cookies?! I'm not even eating now after spending $60 on your food & after having 2 diff drivers come here. NVR again!!!!!

Having half a plate of leftovers packed to-go, I still had half a plate of sauce left. I don't usually order pasta with vodka sauces but I wanted to try something different tonight. In my opinion, the taste was good but could have been better if there was less sauce. My boyfriend ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza. He liked the taste but he thought it was too cheesy. He also enjoyed the garlic knots, which comes with marinara sauce. I thought they were a bit doughy. 

Overall, I've been to better pizzerias. Upside - they deliver though.",zKCAyo1rdFKu8xQGivJeUw,0,0,3,uyOsbKxX8r_lCxpAeiMSdw

I was super skeptical given my recent ""authentic"" experience but boy am I glad I stepped outside my comfort zone because their white pizza was EXACTLY the same style O had been craving!!! White cheese and dollops of ricotta spotted over it. We got half of it with sausage for my man and he enjoyed it immensely. You know the white pizza is really good when you ignore the sausage side completely! Haha. Sooooo good. His side had shavings of Italian sausage, which crisped up... interesting and tasty. He also sprinkled on some garlic powder and a bit of seasoned salt, which I didn't need at all on my side.

Rocco's version is pretty solid!  It has lots of cheese and goodies on the thin NY style crust pizza.  The large is about 16in of goodness, so not quite fold-able slices, but very good.

We ordered half sausage, half pepp, and I really liked how they used longer thin slices of sausage vs chunks of meat.  Adds a nice presentation with great flavor.  The meat was a little oily, but I actually prefer it that way personally.  Check out the pic :

I especially like the crust, it's on the thinner side but not too thin and was really tasty. Although I know pizza isn't an especially healthy choice, this one was rather greasy, which was a big turn off to my boyfriend. Also it really falls apart the further into the slice I got, eventually completely coming apart from the fat crust at the end.

With 2$ per drink and a time of ten minutes for the pie we waited. And waited. And then the unthinkable happens. A group of three kids and an adult drop the rest of their pizza on the ground.

Two minutes later these fuckers get OUR FUCKING PIZZA. The employee says, ""Oh that' ok, we will get you another."" Yeah, another person's fucking pizza they have been waiting for! Ar you FUCKING KIDDING ME!? Oh and no explaination when we get one HALF AN HOUR AFTER ORDERING! Ten minutes my ass.

Whatever, you may say, why freak out? I am freaking out because when I asked for a to go box, I was given a USED one! IT HAD GREASE MARKS AND CRUMBS IN IT!

Note: they have a big menu, there is much to try and given the opportunity I will, the pastas, stromboli, and subs looked amazing, also note the people working here were friendly and accommodating which makes for an overall great experience. PS they make homemade cannoli, shut up!!! Next time I'm saving some room it looked to die for.",fxK-_imiczdljcikBjPd8A,3,1,5,atbyZ8hjP6m5Z6K9GUBeTg

So I call and order a large cheese pizza and a veal cutlet hero for delivery. An hour and ten minutes later no food. Mind you I am 3 miles from the place. 
So I call and this is what happens,
Me: Hi, i called for delivery over an hour ago and my food still isn't here.
Manager: oh your food is out for delivery, all food is out.
Me: Um, how do you know my food is out you didn't even ask me who I was.
Manager: i know who you are and your food is out.
Me: ok, then what was my order.
Manager: I don't know.

This interaction made my head hurt. After a few minutes of arguing with him he calls the driver who says he is 2 minutes away.

Food finally arrives and pizza is lukewarm. And the driver tells me ""oh no that pizza just came out"" really? Is that why I could put my fingers right on the top of a slice and not even blink? Normally the cheese is hot. 

Also don't order zepolies they don't know what real zepolies are as these were tiny, tiny dough balls with sugar on them. Zeppolies are large fried dough with powered sugar on top.

Will never order from them again.

Guess I am still looking for real NY pizza.",TmniT8S5d1rPL_6w7U7-Sg,3,0,1,lg7e_Wq8UCgOFwlNJ1BGuw

My favorite style pizza is a high quality New York style pizza so I was supper excited that a NY Pizzeria had opened up a few stores down from my favorite Dry Cleaners. 

The staff was awesome. The lady at the register was helpful when I explained it was my first time here and told her what I needed. A Hawaiian pizza (not on the menu, normally a good thing for me but the GF likes them) and a combo with extra cheese for me.

The crust was just above average. It was definitely thin crust yet wasn't chewy or crispy and had a great smoky flavor. Not sure how they accomplished that but I thought it saved my pie. Really the only redeeming quality was that the crust had that good smokey flavor.

The bad was the ingredients. The Hawaiian pizza had what seemed like a single piece of lunch meat ham sliced up and maybe 1.5 rings of pineapple spread across a large pizza. I know they did their best to make me a Hawaiian but it fell horribly short. My GF took a bite spit it out and said this is horrible. 

I didn't have that problem with my pie. It had plenty of toppings and good flavor. In fact the crust couldn't hold up to the weight of them all. My/our only complaint with this pie was that it was greasy. A little is OK and expected but a white paper towel really shouldn't come away brown and saturated with grease.

They sell pizza by the slice so I may stop in to grab one when I drop off my Dry Cleaning but other than that I will be going to another pizza joint for my pizza needs. 

Just remembered they sell bottle water and the label claims is drawn from the east river. It was hot and I was thirsty but if that was drawn from the east river I may just have to bring a large water jug the next time I visit NY so I could fill it up and bring it home.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,0,1,3,q-kDcpVJpeZbhAnpkk5bRw
5902683,2014-09-28,0,j00iBr6uYnwgFs_J5y9f0w,"This place serves the worst pizza I have eaten in my life, the pizza from Costco/Sam's club tastes better and costs much less.  I have visited hundreds of pizza joints both on the east and west coast and this place is hands down the worst pizza joint ever.  

I purchased a large pizza which costs around $20 and the pizza was cold and stale and the ingredients weren't fresh.  It's pretty obvious that it's been sitting there all day and the cook tried to throw some fresh green peppers on the pizza to fool customers into thinking it's a freshly baked pizza.  

My friend ordered a pasta and all the ingredients were from the can, the mushrooms, vegetables etc.  and pastas from olive garden tastes much better and cheaper too.  

If you want real italian food, go to Streets of New York.  Their Pizza and Pastas taste 1000x better than this place!",VmW_AxA7RazkgKFoPU6_ew,0,0,1,oY3VQgTE5_V3OsRUXCBigg

The sauce & cheese was very good - the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the crust wasn't crispy enough all the way through the slice to the end, towards the middle my pizza started falling apart and I hate that. But overall a very tasty pizza.",bvPS4vrfiO7ZZ4KAo8KBTw,0,0,4,w5miP9_cJ4FWaVBDPMDUNQ
