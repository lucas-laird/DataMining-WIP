This has probably been the 5th time that they have messed up an order. It's gotten to the point where I stand at the register like a crazy lady watching them make our food. Every time I catch them about to put cheese on something that shouldn't have it I yell, like a crazy lady.

I was working in the area and have been to this location several times, but had never Yelped them. I usually have the carne asada burrito, lunch special. For $7.35, you get a carne asada burrito, sides of rice and beans, with a drink. This is what I had today.

The burrito is filled with carne asada and avocado, very tasty, The sides of rice and beans, beans a little above average, rice average. Soda was the Pepsi genre.

I gave three stars, which is an average rating, which I consider them to be. But, I have Yelped many Mexican restaurants, as of late, many were so below average, I would seek out average.

This one is probably closest one to home.  Often pretty busy too.  We usually eat in the restaurant because of what else...the FREE salsa bar!  Thing is loaded with all the sides you need for your meal - pickled carrots, sliced cucumbers, sliced radishes, jalapenos, limes, heck..even stalks of fresh green onion!  Their red & green salsas are good as well.  Stock up!

What the fam & I usually order doesn't change much when we visit any Roberto's.  We'll stick with the popular carne asada burrito or the machaca burrito (I do like breakfast for dinner), the rolled tacos or carne asada nachos or chicken tacos (don't forget their $1 chicken taco Wednesdays), and I feel like a change one of their tortas.

But no matter what we get it's a decent quick meal.  Watch out though...the fillings in the burritos can be DAMN HOT!  They literally cook it, place it in a warm tortilla, then send it out.  Tasty, tasty, but watch your mouth!  Enough to cause some heat backlash.  Be dainty like me if you have to...cut the burrito in half to let out some of that steam!

Their red & green salsas accompany their food very well.  I can't really decide which one I like better so I always douse my food with some of both.  Delegation, y'all!  Their carne asada nachos are actually quite HUGE, they really give more meat than chips in this one.  And they pile on the cheese...not to mention the sour cream & guac!  Like a massive spoonful of each.  Fatty city, here I come!  But really, they taste good enough I just don't care.  I'll just eat a side of some of Roberto's raw veggies from the salsa bar to even it out a bit.  

Don't start on those rolled tacos.  They are no doubt fatty, fat cholesterol bombs!  KABOOM!  Rolled tacos, covered, and I mean COVERED in shredded cheddar cheese & topped of with generous amounts of sour cream & guac.

1. Huge portions!  I rarely can finish any meal that I order from here.  I almost always have leftovers that are great the next day.  

2. Good and cheap! My wallet is never crying after I pay for food here. You get a ton for what you pay for.  I love a good deal.

3. Super fast! It is totally fast food! This is great because I am usually in a rush.  I do think they should add a drive thru window though.  I rarely go, because I usually have a crazy 2 year old in the backseat and getting her in and out of her car seat is too much work most of the time.

4. It's open 24 hours!

1. The staff isn't particularly friendly.  They aren't mean or rude, but they aren't very welcoming either.

Mixed burrito (beef and beans) - yummm.

The guac is nothing special so you can pass on that. 

If you get a breakfast burrito make sure to ask for the sausage to be extra crispy, and get some lime wedges to squeeze on top.",2i-vlvGFvy9JoVzGlursww,0,0,4,8kWzqwiNoutUzyxn_Ee60g

My tacos were....well not like I remember Robertos ever being. They were awful. The chicken tasted like nothing, no flavor. I loved the beans and rice, but the taco shell and chicken were awful. I was not drunk and this wasn't a need for food to sober up it was a decision on which place on Cheyenne could I get food at this hour. My choices were tropical smoothie but it's freezing out or here.. I should've went to bed starving.",nWaIQ2NALlncIuhoUDDC3A,0,0,2,W5Xb1Oz98RBaeCsXgwoXmg

Ambiance: 3 - Fast food shop style. Small kitchen with a good amount of chairs.

Service: 4 - The people were okay, they got our order done quickly. They were nice and spoke Spanish! 

Food: 3 - There's a giant menu at Roberto's of fast food Mexican. Not really authentic food if that's what your looking for~!

Meh. The food was just alright. I've had better Roberto's from another location. I felt that the carne asada was a little dry and flavorless here. Mexican isn't really my food of choice, but man, is it filling!!

However, if you do plan to eat here, I suggest the breakfast burrito or the carne asada fries (which are not that bad, even with the meat)!!!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,6,5,3,4IZ_fFMvUSA-4khttx83tg

I like it, their chicken tacos they are always crispy and hot sometimes a little greasy but hey if you get a deep fried taco its going to be but it is great. Their carnitas are fantastic. I love the shrimp cocktail. Ive never had anything there that I did not like. The breakfast burritos are fat and a good price. Their two slasa offerings are both good I like them both. But the best thing about them is their staff, they always smile when they see me and say hello they offer great customes service and I will continue to go here as often as I can.

5260155,2013-11-18,0,REJPrXEZly4PDQNmiMGI8Q,"Maybe I'm just not knowledgeable enough about Mexican food or something, but I really don't understand the hype about this place/chain. Everyone is always talking about how great and ""authentic"" it is, but it just seems like standard, uninteresting Mexican fast-food fare to me. Plus, from what I have always heard, although Americanized-Mexican dishes rely on mounds of cheese, real, authentic Mexican food is rarely covered in a cup and a half of shredded cheddar. I don't know, though The food was okay and the service was okay and the prices are okay, but that's really all I can say about it...it's okay. I will say that, when I was in, their salsa/veggie bar was absolutely wrecked. Maybe some quality salsa would've somehow elevated my rolled tacos to another level, garnering another star in the process, but there was no way I was going to pick through that mess to find out. Hell, maybe I'll try it again and it'll knock my socks off. If so, I'll be sure to update this review accordingly, but as of now, I'm in no real rush to go back and see.",J6Jz3UXH1oab79JShMaLGw,0,0,2,DrtmIw4hHpQWWl_THOfDMA

What I'm posting about is the service. Specially getting food at night. We had ordered take out over the phone, so our food would be ready by the time we got there. We get there, and the gentlemen who work there said we were late picking up our food. They said over the phone it would be ready in 10 mins, but we got there in 20 mins after the order was placed. My thought was wow...I didn't know I the customer had to be on time?! They handed me my food, and my drink...that had no lid. I mean no lid not a big deal right..but you expect your pick up order to be ready 100%. I go get my lid and carrots one of the workers shoved me out of the way to add more carrots...I don't know if the worker though I was a ghost or something..but really..come on guys.
