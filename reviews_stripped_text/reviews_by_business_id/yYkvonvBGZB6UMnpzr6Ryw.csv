916033,2017-04-19,0,yYkvonvBGZB6UMnpzr6Ryw,Went here yesterday April 18th nigh time. Fries were soggy with no salt and burger was burnt. So went again today April 19th night time and seriously had to write a review your staff are ffin incompetent. Behold my burger was burnt! BLACK BLACK BLACK. I couldn't even Finnish the first bite. And same thing fries had no salt what so ever. And ordered another burger as well that was missing even sauce. Will definitely never come back now.,KX-V0AGnu_E4i8PNiAkHYg,0,0,1,_iXLfe9zp0QuWP0gF3Oc4A

Obviously I know that it is my fault to even come back here every time but it's the closest one to home. And j know every time when they give me regular Coke instead of Diet Coke... People know the difference... That's why they ask for the diet kind. Please please please have better service in the future!!!!",GfmVezaXBNA1qvSkCrs0gA,0,0,1,A8sEOIo5lvIIenObr40kEg

This store has the latest design, is clean and although Fox News is on both of their TV's, one doesn't have to pick a seat in site of it.   
It's likely the franchise owner's politics but an establishment like this should have less partisan local channels on instead of one with racial and sexual harassment issues.",ht4B344Tk4QbTVzk7AS7qg,0,0,3,k1_EMWncwx-2j8nfP5pqKw
1499817,2014-09-02,1,yYkvonvBGZB6UMnpzr6Ryw,"the burgers are honestly on par with any and every other burger king i've eaten at. what i don't like specifically about this location that makes me give them 1 star is on 3 separate occasions in the past i was served re-fried fries. 1 of the times i saw them actually rescoop  my fries up from where they sit to get packaged and thrown back into the fryer so they would be warm... anyone that has had re-fried fries before knows exactly how they look and taste. disgusting and unacceptable.

Edit : these experiences i had were before they actually revamped and updated this location. i do not know if they still do practice this since then, nor do i plan to ever find out.",Q3LokcKH-GK4HMyQo8aLuw,0,0,1,R7bsfJG1W5AUsw2rRmKJww
1809942,2017-09-24,0,yYkvonvBGZB6UMnpzr6Ryw,"This place has some of the most incompetent people to ever walk the earth working here. It reaffirms my belief that both the company and the food is shit. They had to remake my husbands order 3 times, tried to short him on change and then gave us dry old food as a result. I'm not asking for a lot here. Just for a simple job to be done correctly. Especially when we are paying for it. I understand BK underplays their workers so you get what you pay for, but I'm not paying for old stale food and bad attitudes.  I'm pretty sure chicken fries aren't supposed to be overlooked, bone hard and an inch long.... every single one.",_-cG8x6_K7EUkU9wCRyWkg,0,0,1,fSVq3zCl6A80jVlSp_DInQ

I have never had more than a 5 minute wait from time of pulling into line, very important for when I am on lunch!  The staff has always been friendly and always responsive.

I have been still ordering it after all these years since the ""Little Soldiers"" gem disappeared from the menu I just had to customize a regular Cheeseburger to do so. It was cheap yummy!

I got cheetohs chicken fries and onion rings this time. I really couldn't tell if the cheetohs chicken fries sucked or if they messed up and gave me regular chicken fries.

The food quality here is sub-par....even by fast food standards.  The Beef never tastes fresh and the Bread seems a little old at times.

We decided we wouldn't eat here anymore because it's that bad.  There are 1000's of other fast food joints to choose from.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,8,7,2,KXaV5tW1HgRRSvn-y5FSTw

There were a pair of young women vaping, clouds of vape, in the restaurant... and instead of addressing it, the employees either ignored it or socialized with the girls. When I came to the counter, I was told ""I know, they've been here a long time, maybe they'll be done soon.""

4142633,2013-11-19,6,yYkvonvBGZB6UMnpzr6Ryw,"Ahhh, my local BK.  It is like every other BK around and is pretty consistent.  It gets the job done when you are in a rush and don't have time to cook.

I have to admit, I am here pretty regularly.  It is because: 

1. I live around the corner and it is the closest place to my house.
2. It is cheap and has ok burgers and chicken sandwiches.
3. My kid loves the milkshakes and smoothies they have on the menu.  I love making her happy, so we visit pretty often.
4. The play place is pretty fun for the little ones.  It is especially nice when it is so hot in the summer.  It is nice and air conditioned, which us Las Vegans LOVE.
5. I may or may not be addicted to the new SatisFries.

This particular location has just gone through a remodel.  It is now more modern with a coffee house style to it.  The food is still the same, but it is now in a prettier locale.

So if you want a fast food joint, this one is pretty and pretty good at what they do.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,10,9,3,O9hOsEVdXJ-UFvNztZoD6A

The food always taste like it's sitting underneath a hot lamp. Their buffalo chicken tenders are never prepared the same way whenever you order. No continuity of service.

My son and I love coming here on a hot day after the library!! Here its a little hidden, but once you get here its super nice and air conditioned! We've been here a few times and each time its been pretty swell! 

The wait is usually short bc its not always busy, the cashiers are pretty nice also, except one of the weirdos who told the manager she wasnt going to refill the ice in the machine.

The prices here are comparable, although I dont usually eat the burgers I do sometimes like the onion rings. What I really come here for, in addition to the kids meals, are the fruit smoothies and sundaes! The ice cream here is seriously sooooooooo yummy! And its only 1$ for a sundae! The mango smoothies are also super yummy and are 2$ and change!

My son loves the kids meals here, they include your entree but what he loves most is the paper crown attached.  They also usually have some pretty neat childrens toys.

So we will def continue coming here for the cheap eats, and nice cooled play area!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,0,1,4,L-awzD8rQsJhhLWDPHDT_A

I just happened to drop in here because I had my daughter with me & I wanted her to play at their little indoor playground after we ate lunch (it was getting too hot outside to head to the park). 

Anyway, I ordered the Angry Whopper combo meal because it looked delicious and it was. I just didn't end up finishing it because it was just too big for me. I guess my eyes were hungrier than my tummy. My daughter got their two chicken strip kids meal with the fries, and she loved it. 

What really fascinated me about this place was they had that cool Coca-Cola touch-screen vending machine! That was definitely fun to play around with. There were soooo many choices too! I would go back there just to see what else they had!

Overall, clean establishment, nice staff. It's Burger King, so there wasn't really a ""wow"" factor this place other than it being, well.. A Burger King.",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,0,0,3,b5t5F83eOUBy9AlI7PWT2Q
