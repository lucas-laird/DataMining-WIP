Walk in side and it is very open and very rustic looking a plus the chairs are on wheels which I'm not used to but was kind of cool. As usual the wait staff is very friendly and polite. I ordered the bottomless pasta bowl I first had the three cheese marinara with penne pasta and Italian sausage. the sauce was almost non existent and I had to slice the sausage myself and the penne pasta was mushy but I decided to try something else so I got the Alfredo with penne and meatballs. The Alfredo was tasteless surprising because Alfredo is usually always good the penne that time was good but they forgot to salt it during the boiling part. The breadstick were delicious because it is pre made all the have to do is bake it. The chicken gnocchi soup taste good as soon as it cooled and the lasagna fritta didn't taste good till it was coeld. I feel sorry for the waiter cause he could tell that I was not happy, because of him I give it two stars.",YmhTpkBninf_PMiXeZ9omQ,0,0,2,CsWnWZ3dBcWdoDhcyhy_DA

That said, I really wish someone would address the seating issues at this location. The booths are broken down and extremely uncomfortable, I actually injured my back getting into the booth and several days later still feel the pain. Ridiculous.  The chairs at this particular restaurant have a fabric arm that is just disgustingly dirty from years of dirty hands and food being wiped on them and are also falling apart and fraying. C'mon guys, pony up a little of the money that you've made at this restaurant over the years and make your customers more comfortable and the seating cleaner.

We aren't hard critics it takes a lot to get under our skin. I am surprised this place is still open the Health department needs to shut them down off sanitation alone.
 1) I over heard something about them washing dishes in a trash can because the dishwasher was down...I just threw up in my mouth sad that we were almost done with our food by this time, dirty dishes piled on trays were throughout the restaurant. also beware of bugs in your food there was a grasshopper or something in another tables salad.
2) Our server Eden was so sloppy clearly they don't enforce proper uniforms, she didn't look clean at all and had an attitude to match her attire...tacky! 
3) The manager Larry whom I over heard making racist comments with one of his servers Molly or Holly, about an African American family that was in the restaurant with their children saying ""they are black, of course they want free food"" with a reply from the Molly girl ""and they just had to sit at my table, f#@% my life!"" and it truly offended my wife and I, In fact my wife will be calling corporate to make a formal complaint. But back to the manager Larry he was not professional at all he just strolled through the place as if he was lost seemed very timid and not manager material (must be related to someone in the higher-ups) he came by our table briefly we told him about our concerns and he never returned but from the looks of our experience it doesn't take much to move up in the place. 
4) The food was small portions, cold, flavorless and took forever to come out, our appetizers came after the food had arrived, breadsticks please...""oh they are making fresh ones they will be right out"" HA!! guess that is the lie you tell when you keep forgetting.

I could go on and on but moral to this review is DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! you would be better off going into the 7-11 next door and getting the hot dogs.

591988,2010-06-30,1,6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw,"Ugh. I have to say that the Olive Garden is the most consistently crappy restaurant around. It's far from good Italian and everything seems as if it was just poured from a bag and heated up. No matter what Olive Garden I've been to in the country, they're always the same. This is not a good sign. It means that there is one company making all of the food for all of the locations, which means that nothing is fresh.
I was in an Olive Garden once and some teenagers at a nearby table ran out on their bill and the waitress said that she is personally responsible for paying their bill. If this is the case I do not want to support a company with those kind of policies.

The food at OG is just fine, but obviously not made from scratch. So, the people who complain about this should really get real. What really makes or breaks the dining experience is the server. Being a server is a hard job! I cannot imagine the stress at this particular restaurant. I hear the other patrons around me. Some seem as if they have never been out in the world before. In the face of these wacky customers and the hyper pace, there are some truly fantastic servers there. I want to tell you that Rome is one of the best servers I have ever experienced in my life. What a genuinely nice person. So professional. He would be wonderful at the most high end establishment. I am sure he will go far in life. For now, this Olive Garden is extremely lucky to be represented by him. I hope he sees this and knows how much he was appreciated by my party last week. He made it a stellar experience.

I was there with my two daughters, ages 3 and 4 and my friend. I ordered kids mac n'cheese and chocolate milk for my girls. Waitress brings the chocolate milk that smelled very strange and had big chunks of thick milk clumps inside. After confronting our server, she called a manager over (her name was Sheila if I'm not mistaken). Manager didn't seem to be that concerned and her response was: oh yeah, its just frozen cause we have been keeping fridge doors open for a while so temperature has changed dramatically. What?!?!?!? That's the response from the manager? I was so upset that I asked her if she would serve her children with something so disgusting where she responded she wouldn't.
After her reassuring that everything is good and she will make sure of that, we decided to stay and finish our meal. Our salad had onionskins inside, my friend couldn't finish her pasta cause of a strange taste she tasted.
The same night, my friend got very ill that lasted for 24 hrs. She was not able to eat anything the next day and had to stay in bed.
We both were frequent Olive Garden customers and were always more than satisfied, but never ate at that location before.

Because I just moved here, I haven't had much time to grocery shop or stock up my fridge. My choices for dinner are limited: I can either make myself something frozen in the oven or venture out and find a nice restaurant. Some nights, after a long day at work, I just feel like staying home but still want a quality meal. Instead of pizza or Chinese food, now I have the option of ordering from one of my favorite restaurants and eating in the comfort of my own home.

I ordered the lasagna, some extra breadsticks, and tiramisu for dessert. My food was delivered to me within forty-five minutes and I paired the meal with a bottle of red wine from my own fridge.

The servers introduced themselves and offered wine samples along with genuine chit chat throughout our party. 

Our, drinks and soup/salads came out in a timely manner considering how many orders were placed. The food came out exactly as we were finishing our soups and salads. Refills came as soon as the bottoms of our dishes appeared with no delay. Edith and Nathan were the best servers of Olive Garden I have ever had.

1679285,2016-12-27,0,6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw,We were seated but never served. After the ladies took our name up front at the hostess stand Monday night we waited just a couple minutes for a booth. We were then seated in the boots right beside the bar we were given menus and told that the server would be right with us. After several minutes went by we had plenty of time to look over the menu sit back and discuss about what we were going to order we watch the server come in the little room drop off food apologize to the people behind us for the wait I watched him drop off refills. Now about 15 minutes has gone by he has seen us he made eye contact with me never once stopped and apologize for the wait or said I'll be with you in a moment just completely ignored us. So at this time we've now decided that we were just going to go to another restaurant I had stopped up front and let the hostess know that we sat there for about 15 to 20 minutes no one ever approached us no one ever got us drinks and no one ever said we'll be right with you. The hostess said well I can get you a new server and I told her no it's okay. I really wish the server would of just swung by our table and made some kind of contact with us and told us I'll be with you in a moment or send up buster over to get us some drinks.

Its not always the good experiences that get written about.  We had a short wait in the lobby and then brought to our table.  We started off with the appetizers and we normally order the appetizer trio. and we picked the stuffed mushrooms, calimari, and cheese sticks.  We like to take our time so we always tell the waitress to take her time with bringing out the food so we dont get the apps, lettuce or soup and and entrees 2 minutes apart,  we like to enjoy.  Well the soups and drinks came out  with no breadsticks and had to ask for the breadsticks again before we couple take our 4th spoonful the apps were at the table and stilll not breadsticks.  We asked again and finally got them.  when the apps came, the protion size was smaller the usual.  Less then a handful or calimari, 5 stuffed mushrooms when there was 6 and the cheese sticks.  I made a comment when the waitress was there and she said nothing as if ignoring what i said.  I told the waitess to hold the main course until she saw that we were almost done with the apps.  Telling her this was like talking to a wall.  Within 5 minutes the main course was brought out and we were not even done with them.  To top it all off, I ordered Chicken parm and you would normally get 2 nice size pieces with a crunchy breading.  I was very dissapointed and I did call the company that owns them to tell them.  They sent a small gift card and asked that I call the next time we came in.  i did forget the mention that when they would put down a plate it was like they were intentionally banging the plates on the table.

Our server David seemed either overwhelmed or inexperienced. Thank God our appetizer arrived on time, because EVERYTHING else did not, including the breadsticks. Yes, I repeat, including the breadsticks! After my daughters soup arrived, I thought, ok, maybe my salad is on his next run. Nope. David came by & offered my daughter a 2nd serving of her soup, in which at this point, I had to ASK for my salad & breadsticks. All I thought was at this rate, my salad is probably going to arrive with my entree & sure enough, that's exactly what happened and STILL no breadsticks. My daughter asked for a refill of her water & what she got was a cup of water that tasted like very watered down tea. So she ended up ordering a coke. On top of that, he made a mistake on her entree. By the time it arrived, she had completely lost her appetite. What irked me even more was how he seemed to concentrate all his efforts on this ONE table, and periodically tended to others, not by his own efforts, but by the patron flagging him for his assistance. All the while, I witnessed all the other servers running around, tending to multiple tables. And just when we thought it couldn't get worse, it did. He saw us paying our tab & came by to ask if we wanted some to-go boxes (sure why not, our entrees were barely touched). So he offers to pack them for us, ok nice gesture, but then grabs one of our forks by the prongs & uses it to scoop our food into the to-go boxes. Anyone in the culinary industry knows, that is a MAJOR no no! Your hands have been everywhere and the last place I need it, Is in my food! A COMPLETE waste of $$$!

Of course the breadsticks are yummy. But the alfredo boat you can add to them makes them even better. What I dont get its, they often will an odd number of breadsticks when theres an even number of poeple at the table. But that isnt to big of a deal.

I used to add a ceasar salad because they were great. However they recently removed them. But wait its okay because you can have ranch on your salad. 

But heres the thing that bugs me. They added a new item, the pepperoni fettuccuni alfredo to the buy one take one. I asked for it the last visit. My server asked what item I would take home. I told him i dont want to take anything home can i just have the one I eat here. He said no. Why would you not do it? Im not asking to reduce the price, hell pick a second item and toss it. But why tell your customer they cannot try a new menu item?
Then to night on another visit this poor server is trying to explain the buy one take one and how its not just 12.99 there are up charges for different items. It sounded confusing to me.",Tr1ulYYAHAw5FzEQQwZEJQ,0,0,3,psSWhOSEsqAed6vWjTGtqA

She then said well if I bring out another one Ill have to charge you $4.99. I explained to her I always share my soup with my 4 year old. She said well your not suppose to. She then continued to explain that if my husband were to share his salad with me or my kid she would have to charge a separate salad. I immediately asked for my soup to go and the 2nd soup at the additional price.  I sat there while my husband and child enjoyed their food and took mine home. I had no appetite after that. She must have mentioned it to her supervisor as she was walking around asking everyone in our area if everything was ok. Just a horrible experience.

We ended up staying way later than intended (15 minutes after they closed in fact) and everyone was very polite, not once did we feel like they were upset or rushing us out.

We were heading out when this man was arguing with an employee through the front door. From what I understood, he placed an order with Uber Eats at 10pm -when they closed- and was angry that they didn't keep the order on hand for him? He walked off angrily saying he would leave them a bad yelp review and I said, ""...but they're closed."" He was still angry and said that he placed the order at 10 but they threw out his food. I reiterated that they were closed and he responded with, ""did you not understand me?!"" My coworker said, ""she did understand you, they closed at 10."" Guy got in his car after that.

For someone as picky as myself they actually have quite a few dishes that meet my favorites criteria. Starch. Check. Meat. Check. Cheese. Check. What's not to like?

Admittedly it's a rather mundane restaurant chain but it delivers on what I need it to - enjoyable meals with my mom. Their calamari is crunchy, the toasted ravioli appropriately fun finger food, and the soup is surprising.  Why? Because my number one soup there is minestrone. And it's vegetarian and I am not. Not in the slightest. But there is something about dunking those warm breadsticks into that tomatoey broth that makes me slurp it up with abandon. Of course they have all the classics, and my favorite is chicken fettucine alfredo. Big white sauce fan (it's cheese!) Sometimes the pasta is a bit over cooked, but I am not expecting Mario Batali-like exactness from a chain restaurant.

I don't think I have ever had a bad experience at this Olive Garden. Mostly long waits on F/S nights. Our servers to date have all been pleasant and enthusiastic.

The waiter was super nice and talked me into the bottomless lasagna for a couple bucks more teaching me if I eat the one, he'd give me a second to-go, so it was worth it.

2927224,2011-11-12,3,6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw,"I came here with Donald G. one afternoon for a couple appetizers. There was no wait, so we were seated in a booth right away. We ordered Calamari ($9.95), salad ($6.35), and Spinach Artichoke dip ($8.95). We kept waiting for our bread sticks to come, but they never did. The waitress brought out our appetizers and said, ""Is there anything else I can bring for you guys?"" We both responded, ""Yes, we've been waiting for the bread sticks."" She said she'd have someone bring them to us in a minute (times10). If I didn't love Olive Garden's bread sticks so much, it wouldn't have been a big deal, but I was seriously craving them. Alas, they finally came and I had to double fist them so I could catch up on wasted time. The Calamari kind of looked like pork rinds and they were pretty crunchy (not crisp), so I didn't favor them much. They also came with a parmesan-peppercorn sauce, which was a little too cheesy for our liking, so we just stuck to the marinara. The spinach artichoke dip was probably my favorite of the appetizers, especially when eaten with the soft bread sticks as opposed to the crunchy Tuscan bread it came with. The salad, as you may know, comes with unlimited refills, so it's always a great value.

-Don't let them shaft you on their little bread stick dipping sauce scheme. They make it sound as if it's free, but it's really $3.75 per sauce!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,6,4,3,lz3L5DzyjCSw59URLks0Jg

They were having the ""Never Ending Pasta Bowl"" on this visit. I chose ""Angel Hair with 5 Cheese Marinara"" and the sauce was just delicious!  I think I found my new favorite sauce :) It's not authentic Italian food, but there's just something about it. I usually rate 4 stars for OG, but this location just always goes above and beyond anything I'd ever expect from an Olive Garden!

Our server was excellent. He was always checking on us and never let the bread basket go empty for long. When it came time to pay for our bill we each had pasta left and he brought us more sauce to put on top and even put a couple sausage links on top and then packed it to go for us along with some bread sticks. I left full and fulfilled!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,7,6,5,u5mbR1v-3_U8LnEioS65GQ

There's just some thing addicting about the endless breadsticks and salad bowl...

Wifey likes their Toscana Soup(Potato and Kale)

I keep it simple and usually order any pasta dish that I can twirl with a fork and spoon-this time, meat sauce gets my vote.

kitchen crew needs a Mussels 101 course...these were pretty bad(Firefly on Sahara still gets my vote for the worse mussels ever)

Kevin Z., is the first server I'm going to review:
I decided to treat my mother for lunch and Kevin was our server. He saw that we were having trouble deciding what to order, and he kindly suggested some fabulous dishes! We ended up getting the unlimited rigatoni with soup and it was amazing! He was very kind and checked on us often. He was on top of refills and kept us laughing with his conversation! He was very polite and made us feel at home. 

Last night, I decided to treat my coworker to dinner at Olive Garden and our Server was Justin.

We came to Olive Garden at 7pm with no reservation and were told that it would be an hour of wait time. We waited and surprisingly it only took us 15 minutes to get seated! Our server Justin was very charming and polite to us. He served us a complimentary sample of the sour Apple wine and kept us smiling throughout our whole dining experience! It was a busy night and he was juggling tables and orders like crazy. But he was always on top of his guest service and was enthusiastic at all times.

As for the rest of the food I really don't eat it. I have tried alot of it and yes it was ok but it was ""generic"" if you know what I mean, good food should taste like someone really wanted to make it.

My boyfriend and I went to this Olive Garden this past weekend on Friday night. I had just worked a long shift outside and I was hankering for their bread sticks. The craving just hit me and I could have nothing else.

Of course, on a Friday night the place was packed, especially with a lot of families. We asked how long the wait was and we were informed it would be 30 minutes. Typical, so we went outside and waited. Luckily, I don't believe we waited much more than 30 minutes until we were seated.

The place was really loud, but what can you expect? Tons of families and it's Olive Garden, so I guess you just get over it. I decided to get their dish that is featured on the menu: Stuffed Rigatoni with Grilled Chicken. My boyfriend opted for the Chicken Ceaser Salad. Of course, my meal came with the huge salad and bread sticks. The salad was on par with what you normally get. The bread sticks always came out yummy and buttery and slightly salty. I don't know what they do to them, but they're so good!

Next - the meals were okay, nothing spectacular. The chicken was disappointing, obviously Olive Garden gets their chicken strips out of frozen bags. The pasta was pretty good and the white sauce, well I can't complain about it. Boyfriend said his salad was pretty good. What I don't get is Olive Garden's prices - they seem a bit high to me. I mean, I realize it's ""Italian"" (ha ha), but it's Olive Garden... I shouldn't have to pay $13.95 for mediocre lasagna. 

What was the worst part of the experience was the waiting for our food and waters to arrive. The service was so slow my boyfriend and I commented on it several times. That's when you know your service is bad - you notice it. Yes, they were busy and yes, it was Saturday night, but still, I gotta say the service was rather mediocre.

All in all, Olive Garden is still as mediocre as it ever was. I don't think I'll be returning for dinner on a Friday night any time soon. Probably gonna stick to lunch and their unlimited salad, soup, bread sticks promo.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,3,1meV9aaSiZM7Q-q1M8esLQ

Soup and salad are the standards for my family. We all love the salad and bread sticks, although I must say the breadsticks are not as good as they used to be. Not sure what's changed but OG is going downhill. Too loud, too crowded and becoming overpriced! 
I still enjoy lunch or just the soup, salad and breadsticks. But ordering a full meal requires way more time than I usually have for dinner out with the kids. 
Their dessert is still wonderful and as stated at the beginning the new ravioli appetizer was amazing. The food is still ok, again not authentic Italian (I've been there) but better than some of the ""fast food"" Italian places I've been.

4578299,2018-02-18,0,6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw,"I've been coming to this location for many many years, ever since I moved to Las Vegas twenty years ago. I'm basing this review on my last experience and only because I've had good experiences in the past I'm giving them a three otherwise it would be a two :/

It was Valentines Day (I know, I know.. they are SUPER busy) but I had just been discharged from the hospital and we needed some REAL food so my friend ordered three meals to go from their website so we could just go and pick it up (the wait was about an hour and 40 minutes). 

We arrive right on time and of course the parking lot is crazy busy and all the to go spaces are filled. We park in another area and you can see the runner going from car to car getting names and bringing out the bags of orders. I volunteer to go inside to try to get our order from the actual to go area only to find a big line. After waiting for like 10 mins and the line not moving and no one telling us anything, I finally see an employee walk by and ask them what am I supposed to do because I havent see anyone even at the counter. While talking to him an employee finally comes to the counter so he says talk to him. He explains that they are busy and whats the name my order is under so I tell him. And he just stood there. Doesn't check anything. I'm like, ok? Then he says there is someone coming by getting names. So at that point I go back to the line and this person ""taking names"" finally shows their face and I give them the name BUT I tell her that we (our party) is now in the to go parking spot (they texted me) and we will be waiting outside. To which she acknowledged and wrote that DOWN next to our name.

So, I go outside and wait in the car in the to go parking lot. And wait. And wait. The runner girl NEVER came to check on us. So we call the number on the to go parking sign (it's been over 30 mins since our order should have been ready) and the person on the phone yells if our order is ready and someone replied to ""Yeah it is"". UM?? What the heck? They finally bring it out and we bring the food home. You can tell it's been sitting around. The alfredo has congealed, the cheese is rubbery and the bread sticks were HARD.

 NOT cool Olive Garden.We made numerous attempts to get our order and they failed miserably on their execution to bring it to us when it was DONE. And to make matters worse, we ordered TWO ""Tour of Italy"" meals. We got one that was correct, the other was just an order of chicken parmesan. BUT we were charged the full amount for a second Tour of Italy which is way more expensive. And my eggplant parmesan meal which I had their marinara spaghetti side replaced with alfredo fettuccine had the tiniest bit of alfredo sauce (alfredo= EXTRA charge). It was like they only sauced half of it and said forget it, but my boyfriends pasta was completely covered in alfredo. 
Not a pleasant experience, poor execution and charged/over charged for items not received and not enough of sauce that we paid extra for. I really hope this isnt a trend.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,2,0,3,IbDCj3TiuFmv47NRdFTq3A

Well, let's start off by saying when we were seated we all got utensils except my kids. Next, when we received our appetizers they didn't give us plates so we all had to pick at the appetizers. Ok. My husband and son had to constantly ask for more drinks instead of the waitress asking if they wanted or needed more. Or even just simply bringing them a new on. When we were done eating she asked if we needed to go boxes. We got them but I had to ask for a bread bag for the breadsticks. So there we were w 3 to go boxes and a bread bag. She didn't even bring us a bag to put the boxes in. If you've ever been to Olive Garden then you know that they usually bring a bag to put your to go boxes in. I had to ask another waitress for one.

When we sat down they took their time giving us bread sticks and even longer to get this dip that a friend wanted.

I'll never understand it.

Today's experience began with the opening line from the hostess that I simply hate: ""Is there JUST two of you?"" (Woefully implying that a 2-top isn't worth much.) Next she took us to a table that was blocked by a tray piled up with dirty dishes and acting like she expected us to slide passed the tray. When we didn't budge, she scooted the tray over. 

Servers (not just ours) were very lackluster. No menu descriptions and it felt like we were interrupting their smoke breaks. 

Food was dried out and obviously prepared in advance and microwaved. The gravy on the garlic chicken breasts tasted like the canned type from the grocery store. The ""breasts"" BTW were not really 2 breasts, but 1 sliced in half horizontally to have the appearance of being 2. Cheap. Real cheap. 

The afredo sauce on the pepperoni fettuccine alfredo also tasted like the bottled type from the store. The pepperoni was very skimpy. 

For the prices they charge (not that it is expensive...just the price point) food should not look, feel, and taste like fast food. There are a number of Italian restaurants (Such as Brio Tuscan Grille, Buca di Peppo and Capo's) where the same amount of money will get you pleasant service and freshly made food that doesn't taste like it came out of a bottle.

The staff wasn't much better, walking around without a smile to be seen. I could not find one staff member that didn't have a frown on their face. We were told a 20 minute wait for a party of 6 and must have sat there for 30 minutes until being called. Our waiter, when he decided to grace us with his presence, tried to take our drink order by memory until he realized it was too much to remember and went scurrying for a pen and paper. I didn't catch his name, but he was short, bald and had a blond goatee. The whole meal was a complete catastrophe. Where do I begin? The $24 ""pitcher"" of sangria that was the size of a big gulp and so filled with ice it could barely fill 3 glasses? The 30 minute wait for effin bread sticks and salad? The hour long wait for our entrees when 4 of us ordered the fettuccine Alfredo? The hour long wait to get our check? Our waiter should have been named Houdini because he pulled off quite the disappearing act. In the end we had been there for 3 hours on a Thursday night, and let's face it, the food is below par at best. This experience just reaffirmed my belief that some chain restaurants are busy for reasons beyond my belief. This one might have been less busy if it didn't take 3 hours to turn over one table.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,0,1,0SczO94KFF7LvkT7ilL2Xg

He got the eggplant parm and I got the five cheese ziti. Both meals were absolutely delish and we could barely walk out of there we were so stuffed. They were super busy so the overall service wasn't that great but the food made up for it. I would definitely go here again to take advantage of that special.

5582772,2012-05-19,0,6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw,"If you want authentic Italian, this is probably not the place to eat.  However, they make the best salad, have great breadsticks and the chicken gnocchi soup is so good my seven year old dips her breadsticks in it.  For under $10.00 you can get unlimited soup and salad.  They will usually bring the adults a free taste of the wine of the day which is a nice touch.  They keep adding menu items and seem to be hitting some good ones.  The kids menu is excellent and even has shrimp as a choice for the pasta usually resulting in my daughter ordering spaghetti with butter and garlic and shrimp.  Did I mention we really like the chicken gnocci soup?  The appetizers are good, we like the sampler.  The stuffed mushrooms aren't very good but the lasagna fritta, toasted ravioli and the flatbread pizzas are favorites.  Their latest Tuscan specials are excellent.

Prices are not too extravagant.  Some main dishes you might like are the steak gorgonzola alfredo, parmesan crusted tilapia, Apricot Chicken and on the low carb end of things, mixed grill (no pasta, just good old fashioned protein!).  You can also order gluten free and whole wheat pasta. (be careful, the gluten free pasta is cooked in the same kitchen as the regular food so they can't ""guarantee"" it is completely gluten free.

Sometimes they offer the never ending pasta bowl as well and you can get pasta with your choice of sauce until they have to wheel you out of there in a wheelbarrow.  

Needless to say, Olive Garden is good quality comfort food at reasonable prices and should be on every family's rotation.

Oh it does get crowded on Fridays and Saturdays where you can wait about 30 minutes.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,3,1,4,R_g_w4QWL2h0xfMIY6vEZA
5600043,2010-11-17,9,6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw,"So last night it was my daughters birthday.  Me...""Where do want to go for dinner?"" daughter...""OLIVE GARDEN.""   I smiled and said ""great.""  OOOF - of all the places in Vegas.  I typically do not frequent corporate run restaurants -  but this was about the kid today.

So it is busy with people who have little appreciation for Italian food and lacking any sense of adventure.  We got a table after about a 5 minute wait.  The waiter was very friendly - but along with tips I think these people are paid on commission, too.

The suggestive selling and everything is understandable but at this place the upsells are obnoxious.  The waiter brings the bottle of wine and he must have asked us for dessert 10 times.  Do you want alfredo sauce with the bread sticks? Is it free?  No. Then No.  (it used to be).  

Then as he is taking our drink order he asks if we are ready to order.  C'mon guy let us sit down and relax a second ---- geeeez.   We are not cattle here.  

Then the salad.  They actually put one olive in the salad for each person at the table...oooo generous.  I can go to subway and get2 handfulls of olives if I want!  I think they are counting the croutons too!

So the Food - well it is the Olive Garden, so I ordered the lasagna.  This is not a meat lasagna BTW - it is a cheese lasagne with meat sauce on top and the meat in the sauce is scant.  It was perfectly flat - was this thing made at a factory somewhere else?  It was a birthday dinner so I smiled and ate half of the $14 pile of of of of of ....

The food is just so lackluster.  The corporate influence is just too much.  I avoid this place at all costs, I hope my daughter appreciates the sacrifice I made last night... greater than any gift!",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,0,1,_NOiikfYqROQM5zVa0fixQ

My chicken came separate and wasn't fully cooked. My server literally couldn't remember that he has asked about appetizers 4 times as well as forgetting to put in our order.

5837445,2016-03-12,3,6PqYwabO2g1r2ZB7eImOiw,"I had my best Olive Garden meal here recently--really tasty food and stellar service!

Crab-stuffed Mushrooms were quite cheesy, just as I had hoped.  The best Pasta Fagioli is served here: hot assortment of beans with Ditalini Pasta swimming in a thick and robust tomato-based broth topped by grated cheese.  Endless Garden Salad with the OG's homemade light Green Goddess Dressing, lettuce, tomato slices, pepperoncini, and seasoned croutons sufficed as another great prelude to my entree of Spaghetti with Meatballs & Sausage in Bolognese Meat Sauce, also topped by grated Parmesan Cheese.  I opted for 2 meatballs and 1 sausage link, and had plenty of food, even though a normal add on is 2 lengths of the mild Italian Sausage.  Zeppoles were sugar-dusted and good as well, nicely dippable in a Chocolate Sauce.  Tiramisu and other desserts also looked fetching, but I left them to others.

Alas, the vaunted buttered Breadsticks were good but not great.  I prefer them to be lighter.
Still 4-1/2 stars overall in what seemed like a fine Italian meal one would be much likelier to be served in a non-chain restaurant.  Even though it may not be the closest to me geographically, this location will be my go-to Olive Garden in Las Vegas from now on.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,9,5,4,0V2sTuyYNde829sQpLIAbA

Craig was our server, he was friendly and courteous. The food came fast and he did everything he could to accommodate our request.  

Our food was SALTY, over-cooked, or undercooked.  

Craig informed the manager, Edith.  She came to our table without a smile.  We explained the food quality in a very even handed manner.  Told her what was good and what wasn't very politely. She was very dry in her response and didn't offer even an apology.  

The table behind us told their server that the food was terrible but they were hungry so they ate it. Edith the manager was standing in ear shot and did not acknowledge them at all.",qcvbJmJxOEIF0MAZg665hA,0,0,1,bwuqBcae_RooQfEty1GgmA

Sophia was her name. She was kind, friendly and just a downright great server. 

Sophia was right there with hot bread, drink refills as quick as my husband and kids finished their glasses, checked on us often and was sure to let us know if we needed anything she would take care of us.

The food came out and it looked incredible. Just one bite and we were all in heaven. It makes me so happy when food comes out the way you order it the first time. My family is quite picky. 

If you have not tried this OG location I think that you should because you will not be let down, from the front door to the table, to the check it was a very amazing visit and I am happy to share this with the world.

Food can never be complained about but service sometimes doesn't always hit the mark like the food. But last weekend I was completely blown away by our server Jesse and the manager on the floor, a slender young man with blonde hair. I'm sorry I missed his name but he was phenomenal. These two are great examples of ""on point"" customer service. It was a busy weekend with it being Veteran's Day weekend and it was the start of their dinner rush. We went in to celebrate my mom's birthday. Jesse took over as the first server Preston I believe was moved to another section. Jesse was there to make sure we had everything and when my parents, well my mom was being a bit much he was at her beck and call and with a smile. Our table was lacking bread when our soups and salads were brought out and he let us know up front they were bringing out fresh bread. As soon as he saw we were low on salad or bread, he replenished them. My daughter's pizza was missed in the kitchen, after all our food was dropped, he apologized and he let us know what had happened and gave us a time frame of when it was to come out. As soon as he was done talking with us, he stopped the manager on the floor and alerted him of the situation. The manager came right on over and apologized to my daughter and asked for her forgiveness. It was cute and sweet and we appreciated it. I respect a server and manager more when they are honest and apologetic of the situation.  Within a few minutes, her food arrived and we were all good. Thank you to Jesse and the MOD for a showing how customer service should be executed. You are great examples for your team members.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,9,10,4,j-kXZZY3enUREPTfn3qOvA
