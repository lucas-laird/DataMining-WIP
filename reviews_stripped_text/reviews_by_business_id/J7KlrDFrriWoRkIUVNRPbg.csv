But a surprising delight to have in my hotel. This was at least one meal a day for me out of the four days we stayed. I just kept coming back for more!

Everything was made to order. I always got the three taco plate which came with three tacos in house made tortillas, filled with your choice of meat (each taco can have a different meat as well for variety). You had your choice of filling as well, from cheese to lettuce, salsa, etc. I always got the steak as one, and other times chose from the other meats every time just to see what they tasted like. All were very good, especially the sweet pulled pork. They also have burritos as well. 

Highly recommended! As I'm writing this review, I am craving more of their tacos now! So please get tacos and eat some for me since I'm back home in Colorado!",MMXwhTMpy9W7rvpltcZglg,1,1,5,-Y8R-9F7a-Wi3ohvT5LWcw

MEH. KEEP LOOKING ELSEWHERE IN THE MGM FOOD COURT
We were about to get on a plane in a few hours and wanted to get something fast and fairly healthy to eat. We saw Tacos N' Ritas at the MGM Food Court and decided to give it a try. We figured it was a welcome change from the $50-$60 lunches for two that my husband and I had been having in Vegas for the past several days. And we were hungry!

WHAT *NOT* TO ORDER - CHICKEN BURRITO BOWL $11
I love burrito bowls and I have them whenever I can, especially since I'm trying to maintain more of a clean eating diet. I also love to add guacamole in my burrito bowls. 

With my first few bites, I knew this was not anything at all like I was hoping for. The chicken was flavorless and dry. The guacamole tasted kind of sour! The salsa didn't really add any flavor at all. All in all THIS MEAL MADE ME SAD. Why? Because I was hungry and it was my last meal in Vegas. We should've just sprung for another expensive meal and left with a bang. ;) I mean, how can you get a chicken burrito bowl wrong? Well, they got this bowl Wrong for my order. I didn't even eat all of it because I didn't like my meal and I was hungry! My husband chose the steak burrito ($11), which at least tasted acceptable. 

SERVICE: Lackluster. Nothing remarkable to say about the customer service. It was more akin to a cafeteria-type of setting of doling out the food. It could have been friendlier. 

RESULT: Do not get the chicken bowl. If you want good Mexican food, this is not the place. You're better off going somewhere else in the food court for cheap eats or walking elsewhere down the MGM Promenade to a pricier joint.",052W-MT6frMEdVw4nq4WEg,4,0,2,N4jSEDuSzkHml-pxjYUt0Q

The nachos with steak were a perfect snack. It was a really large portion (and they don't skimp on the meat and cheese, either) -- perfect to tide two people over for a few hours.

The nachos come with your choice of meat, plus cheese, which all goes under the salamander to get hot and yummy. Then they add salsa, sour cream and guac. This place does nachos right -- the salsa had the perfect amount of heat and flavor. The guac was good, and the nachos were some of the best-constructed nachos I've had (and I'm from LA where awesome Mexican places abound).

Pros:
-Fast meal in a pinch.

-The made the chips for chips and salsa fresh in front of me.

Cons:
-the steak was marinated with a sauce that had a little too much tang.

OK, Vegas, right.  But the food was a big FAIL. Taco and enchi were average.  Beans (black or pinto, no refrieds) were flavorless.  Rice was just plain white rice (no tomato or onion or any flavoring), with some grains hard/dried.  It bore no resemblance to what the rest of the world knows as Spanish rice or Mexican rice, it was just poorly cooked white rice.  The guac was fine, but came in a tiny cup, approx 1/3 cup.  Basket of chips might have been the worst ever.  Not only flavorless, but the texture -- each chip was partially soft/chewy and partially hard. Maybe they were made/bought a few days ago, then left out to get stale, then nuked or something?  I don't know.  But really, really, DON'T waste your time/money.

Everything is ~$10 regardless of choice of protein (grilled chicken, steak, pulled chicken, etc.) My fave was the burrito salad, which comes with a tortilla base and all the fixings (rice, lettuce, corn, salsa, etc). The tortilla itself is one of the best I've had. It is fluffy and crispy on the edges, without being overly greasy. 

I wouldn't recommend getting the ""burrito bowl"" because it's tiny, even though it's the same price as the burrito salad/burrito!

3681306,2015-09-29,3,J7KlrDFrriWoRkIUVNRPbg,"Although better than most fast food options at the MGM food court, Tacos N' Ritas is standard Mexican food.

Given my frequent visits to MGM Wet Republic this past summer, I have been (un)fortunate enough to try all the food options at the MGM food court.  If I could, I would give the Tacos N' Ritas a four star because relative to the other options in the same food court, it is definitely above the pack.  Plus, considering the amount of food you get, I would say that it is also a pretty good deal.  However, is it four star cuisine?  Not really.

After another hot day out at the pool, my friend and I decided to eat here.  Similar to Chipotle, you choose how you want your entree served: burrito, burrito bowl, taco salad, taco, nachos, quesadilla.  From there, you choose your meat to be used.  For example, I chose the taco salad with the chicken meat which was basically an open faced burrito with tons of lettuce.  Again like Chipotle, they asked about different beans, rice, and salsas to add on top. As I mentioned previously, it was solid food with decent flavors.  However, whether this is four star cuisine is highly debatable.

Even with the long line, the service was pretty fast and efficient. 

Overall, Tacos N Rita's is better than most, but still just your average Mexican fast food option at the MGM food court.",CdKvRVLHbX3pokKhj96X0w,2,3,3,8mWHfuAn2q-KT5igsQbRvw

The quesadillas come with a side of sour cream and guacamole- guac tasted slightly odd but still tasted ok. 

I asked for a side of the hot sauce, which I think is the sauce they use for the enchiladas. It was hot and green- and actually a really nice dipping sauce for the quesadillas. It was worth $1 more, but was totally worth it.

My bf and I were starrrving after watching a show so we walked the strip but somehow ended up here. The line was long so we thought that the food was the bomb which is why people were lined up for it. We waited at least 30 mins till we were able to order. It was a little pricey. They didn't have hot hot sauce, but portions were just okay. The food wasn't the best, its a little bit like chipotle but a little less options and maybe less healthy. Their chips and salsa were pretty good, but I felt a little disappointed. It would've been fine had we gotten the food super fast, but that wasn't the case. They also should wrap their burritos in foil because my boyfriends burrito was messy to eat. Not really recommended but I could see why some folks love this place.",PO35eUKYCf1kAoVctJ4H1g,0,0,2,QXMtM16gIhJPiTAgEiEBFQ

5840963,2015-09-23,3,J7KlrDFrriWoRkIUVNRPbg,"This place is worse than Taco Bell. Located in the food court of MGM, this wannabe Chipotle had the worst possible food and service. I unfortunately got the carne asada quesedilla which tasted like rubber. The food was beyond bland and had a weird texture to it that I barely even finished my first bite. As for the service, I was dumb enough to stand around at the register while the employees looked like they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Even if you were blacked-out drunk looking for something to eat, you would have better luck going to the McDonald's in the food court.",78c_llOEjlJ5lW35bL137w,5,2,1,EtiFY7PZsdRbyJDm42O6JQ

Then when they finally replace the tacos they asked for my whole plate with the rice and beans on it, they threw away the rice and beans and then gave me back a plate with only tacos. Really? Don't waste your time going here. It's a rip off and the food is disgusting. Service of course was just as bad.",CmWCuk1tXTq8g3cniB69AA,2,1,1,JZxBQ1tqNswhdbrqROZ4xQ

Their barbacoa is way too sweet with a teriyaki taste and their hot sauce literally tastes like tostitos brand chip salsa. Don't order the guacamole it taste like powder mix guac. Honestly run for the hills I rather eat tacobell.",ksM75JUHRkYWvh9UzIMWKg,1,0,1,mHNelWGNkoPDLE5Uj0IQ-g

So don't believe the bad review below. They were still great & the best tasting to me. & yes we tried other spots like the margarita bar is the name I believe on the strip that place is a total waste of money & hard rocks wasn't too bad. But for me hands down TACOS N RITAS was THE BEST! Drinks & food. The only bad thing was they were out of the souvenir cups, but they're still the best.

The groupon contained two 32oz margaritas for $14.00. which is a great deal because they want about $22.00 otherwise for each. I decided to give their food a try. I had the burrito bowl it was mediocre. I definitely had better but it was a quick bite.,2eNyhLZq3SFRDaMXXJgBhQ,1,0,3,deIpORGT8Mqwpf6bedmzrA
