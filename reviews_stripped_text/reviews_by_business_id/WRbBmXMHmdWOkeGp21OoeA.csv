So we chose to give Mamma Olivia's a shot. When we first walked up we were greeted by a very friendly hostess and the manager, Gina, who then informed us about the specials they were having as well as the happy hour that was running from 2-6. As I am a very avid happy hour junky that was music to my ears! Needless to say we grabbed a booth, which we were able to choose ourselves, and were promptly served a complimentary bruschetta. The kids were getting hungry so this helped keep the little gremlins at bay while we looked over the menus. We started with the fritto misto which was deep fried deliciousness! The shrimp, calamari, and broccolini were cooked perfectly and wasn't served with half of the grease coming out of the fryer onto the plate. We then ordered a caprese pizza for the kids excluding the basil and ordered osso bucco and lobster spaghetti for my wife and I. The presentation of all the plates shows how much the chefs preparing the food really care about it. It felt like every piece of food on the plate was purposefully placed and demonstrated a thoughtfulness on the very edge of art. A few bites into the food the manager Gina stopped by and first asked our kids if they were liking the pizza; who then answered enthusiastically that it was better than anything we (the parents) have ever cooked for them. After a good laugh we told her that the food was outstanding and full of flavor! The service from Josh was top notch and the atmosphere of the place says classy authentic Italian food. We will definitely be back to visit again with the whole family and can't wait to try new stuff from the menu! Thank you again for everything!",zmTBRkIWaAaHalLFuDQ-cg,0,1,5,9PzwNkTh7tXC5mu3tjPQrw

1371024,2018-06-21,2,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"I was so, so excited to dine here just for the wheel however, it turned out to be a total disappointment. As one other reviewer put it, the cheese wheel was a total gimmick. I'm almost certain that no cheese melted off of the parm wheel. The manager, who also did the table side flambé, was struggling to carve/chip cheese chunks off of side of the wheel into the pasta. The chunks of parmesan that did make it into our dish were solid and blackened. Don't get me wrong the food was still good, but you're paying ~$20pp (minimum order is 2) to essentially toss alfredo pasta in a bowl that happens to be made of cheese, which IMO is not worth it. 

Another reviewer who highly recommended this restaurant mentioned that they had learned to cook authentic Italian food in Italy and that the food here is the real deal. He/she raved about the freshly, in house baked garlic bread and extremely fresh calamari. The calamari was fresh, but it was nothing special. 

I'm a Frenchie and I take two foods very seriously...my cheese and my bread. Sadly to say I was disappointed with both.",DosAXFzC1gLGdOS2uwQvdA,0,0,2,osdyX3QCMf052SuVeyrXMg

Josh was helping us at the bar & the drinks were on point. We tried out some of the happy hour mini entrees I had the penne alla vodka (Yummy) my friend had the flatbread (big portion for only $5) and my other friend tried the fried calamari (amazing aswell). We then moved to a booth and decided to proceed to try some of the dinner menu entrees. We shared a spagethi frutti de mar and thank god we shared it because huge portion yet so YUMMYYY!! Our server was Thalia once we moved to a table and what a sweet very attentive server. We also met Gina the manager and she too was amazing, talked with us and offered a complimentary desert to us.

The waiter was really nice but he was new and he got my order wrong, I ordered a pesto fettuccine on the cheese wheel, but he got me an Alfredo sauce instead. I explained I didn't mind the Inconvenience as long as he can get the food I ordered correctly but they brought the same Alfredo fettuccine with pesto added to it and the food was now cold. I am disappointed because the idea of the cheese wheel was appealing but not only there was not any cheese from the cheese wheel that got on my pasta because the poor nice man didn't know how to work he wheel and the mediocre pasta was cold. I really wanted to like the place, and  was really looking forward to try the other food from their menu but I am not going to be back there anymore after that experience.",khR6zVVPovDsS1RHCNsovw,0,0,2,eVETpwshUFSEwOqwXfZvoA

I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken(cost extra to add any kinda meat) could not eat it. So blain an super under seasoned. The chicken was thin an super chewy, you can tell they are using cheap meat. The girlfriend got the chicken piccata. She as well couldn't eat it.

Even their desserts are superb.  You will love their food and friendly service and the price is very reasonable.  Enjoy !

Came here for the cheese wheel pasta and we have no regrets. We were greeted by a very friendly waiter who had great service skills, always making sure to check on us. He made sure to answer any of our questions and guided us through the order process for the cheese wheel pasta. There were certain rules (like 1 flavor for a minimum of 2 people), and other add-ons to the pasta. We chose the flavor with pesto on it, and added shrimp to it for an extra charge.
Our food came with a complimentary bread basket and sauce, not sure what kind but it was like vinegar and had oil. The waiter brought the cheesewheel over and made our pasta in front of us. It is quite interesting to watch! From the cheese on fire to the stirring, it was mouth-wateringly enticing to witness in front of us. You also get the option to add parmesan and crushed red pepper to your pasta. Me and my friend both looooved our food! I couldn't finish mine but thankfully I was able to bring it home.

Anna, the assistant GM graciously invited us back. She stated that they would be able to make the fettuccine alfredo without meat upon request. We haven't been able to make it back yet, but we definitely will. I'll let you know what we think!!

------------------------------------------------

Tried to take my girlfriend on a date night for the infamous cheese wheel. She was super excited to get the fettuccine alfredo and watch them flambé it at the table!! 

When we got to Mamma Olivia, the place didn't have too much business. Very cute atmosphere, don't let the location deter you. We were seated immediately and Tucker came right over. The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the customer service. 

BEFORE YOU GO--you can not customize the fettuccine alfredo...it comes with prosciutto, ham, and peas. The peas are the only item that can be removed. Apparently they are not vegetarian friendly. My girlfriend is completely against the idea of prosciutto and ham, so unfortunately we could not do the cheese wheel. There were two other options...unfortunately not what she was looking for. Because of this, we opted to leave. The cheese wheel was our only reason for coming to Mamma Olivia...

Tucker apologized for the inconvenience and offered alternatives. We definitely appreciated his empathy and attempt at finding another option. 

I cannot speak on behalf of the food as we left because the cheese wheel could not be modified. Customer service, A+. Concept of the cheese wheel is epic. Hopefully one day we can try",_g2q0mKj9QgkfgHVBpqvoQ,1,0,3,L3MVLWI2uxMcmIVMz2Djxw

2596167,2018-05-09,1,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"Located right inside the same plaza as Boulevard Mall. I was captivated from the cheese bowl on IG and knew I had to check this place out. My friend and I visited during lunch on a weekday when it wasn't busy. The host was also our server, who also seemed to be the manager on site as well. He was a man of many roles, and I'm not sure I liked that. He didn't seem proficient heating and mixing up the pasta in the cheese bowl. There were many times when the cheese bowl tried to escape him. The cheese was not stringy as most pictures capture it to be. The cheese was short and underwhelming even after I requested it to be long and stringy. Maybe a server could have fulfilled my request? Or maybe once the restaurant gets a hang of your business--they are fairly new afterall? 

The food was just okay. I've had better Italian food elsewhere in Vegas at a comparable price. I do recommend the penne with vodka sauce here! You can't ever go wrong with vodka sauce. Their space is large, so I do hope that they improve so they can utilize the volume they were meant to handle.",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,7,1,3,fQnlBBsfbNJBDaSS4_a_dw

Was told it would be 15 min wait for a table because they did not want to overwhelm the staff. Not only was that crazy but the male host/mgr was completely rude. 3 of us walked out and told 4 other customers who walked away. Four other people left when they were told the same. Not sure how they expect to make money with no customers. I give them 6 months.

2763491,2017-12-21,0,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"Live right across the street from the mall where this place is nuzzled and dropped in with my boyfriend; since then we've been about 3 or 5 times. He noticed it before I did and knows my love for Italian food is thick. First we took the 1 minute walk from our apartment to the mall. We get in and it doesn't feel like we're at the mall. Place is scarce so we're like maybe it's not that great but we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and too busy wondering what days they do the live music to care about no one being there. It's actually kind of nice.

 To start we got the Margherita pizza. I always judge an Italian spot on their ability to make a good traditional Margherita pizza. Few places in town actually get it right. Though this place isn't quite all the way traditional it is still delicious and satisfying. Good sauce and fresh basil. Close, but still nothing can top the Margherita pizza at the Encore in my eyes.

For dessert, we had the most amazing pistachio gelato that we practically fought over. The pistachios (I'm guessing) were ground finely ground and mixed in throughout the gelato which gives it this kind of gritty but tasty texture.

All in all this place is great, nice staff, great prices, don't know why it's in the mall but I think it adds to the appeal. I've been here on my birthday to try their fettuccine alfredo which is great but add ins for meat are extra.",WNGQUw7J2ymYu1r6d_x88w,1,0,5,Dm4b83E-couLUTe95rbt9g

Fine. Then they advise me the draft beer is out and unavailable. This was very disappointing as I look forward to draft beer on the weekends. They kindly brought us a bread basket, but it only had three slices of bread-and we were a table of four. That was awkward. Our request for a second bread basket went unfulfilled.

My buddy invited me to try this new italian restaurant Mamma Olivia in the BoulevardMall. 
The place is nice and cozy, with football game on.
The pit boss is an Italian himself, so he knows what hes talking about. 
He recomended the Ossobucco Veal, i asked him what was that, he nicely explain to me slow cooking Oxtail and love the way they cooks. 

This is probably the best italian resto in vegas.
Veal Ossobucco is my favorite from now on.

4578356,2018-05-24,1,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"My friend and I made a special stop here because we had seen them advertised on social media with this awesome video of them with fettuccine alfredo in a cheese wheel and couldn't wait to try it!
   We came on a late Friday afternoon and there was only a couple people inside, we chose to eat outside on the ""balcony"" area which is just outside the restaurant inside the actual mall. 
    Our waiter brought us some fresh complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was DELICIOUS! We had it replaced twice and one gentleman who also helped with our table, I assuming one of the owners, was so polite and said it was fresh baked that morning.
    Going through the menu I had planned to order something off that and my friend was going to get the alfredo in the cheese wheel (according to the video on social media the cheese wheel option was a ""secret"" menu item so it was not listed). To our dismay, our waiter told us that for the cheese wheel option you HAVE to get two servings to order it and it HAS to be of the same pasta flavor. I was a little upset, but my friend really wanted to try the cheese wheel so I agreed to not get my option and go with the pasta (I'm not a big pasta person).
    For our appetizer we ordered the calamari ($12) that's served with marinara sauce. I asked them if they had like a garlic aioli to serve with it as well because I personally wasn't a big fan of marinara sauce with calamari. When we received the app but they didn't include the marinara at all (my friend did want it) but instead it was just drawn butter with garlic. Not their fault, I think it was a communication issue but they tried to accommodate my request even though a mayonnaise sauce isn't the same as butter. So, although the dipping ""sauce"" was off the calamari itself was very good and very tender.
    For our entrees we ordered the two pasta orders for the cheese wheel but again were disappointed because we were informed that they no longer do the fettuccine alfredo in the cheese wheel :( They have three options and we went with the pesto and prosciutto penne ($16 ea). The gentlemen came out and did the whole display with the wheel which was super cool and answered all our questions. He put a fresh bowl of romano cheese at the table and then came out with crispy prosciutto for the pasta. The pasta was very good, a little salty even before adding extra cheese but very good. Like I said I'm not the biggest fan of pasta so I took almost the whole thing to go as dinner later to share but the taste was there and I do love me some pesto and prosciutto! 
    All in all the service was terrific, they definitely have their customer service down and the food is really really good. I just wish that to get the pasta in the wheel you didn't have to have the two orders of the exact same pasta dish. I hope if I do come back I'll get to try another menu item, and I recommend anyone that's hesitate to try them out not to be! They are great!",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,2,1,4,tJegLzt3pm6rgYtN7ABPvA
4684923,2017-12-22,4,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"I moved to Las Vegas in 1971 and still live in the same neighborhood on the east side of town. 
In the mail I received a postcard coupon (see two pix) from Mamma Olivia's which read: ""50% off buy 1 entree and receive 1 free"" so my neighbor and I decided to give this restaurant to try because it's only a couple of blocks away and who doesn't like a BOGO?!
We entered the restaurant which was really nice looking and 95% empty. We sat down and our server introduced himself to us, I think his name was Josh. Neither of us wanted a cocktail so my friend ordered a coffee and asked for cream and sugar. The coffee was delivered with sugars but no cream. I asked Josh again to bring cream. About three minutes later we got the cream. We ordered and each of us commented on the food: pretty good although my lobster was a bit chewy. When we were ready to leave, I gave Josh the coupon and he took it to bring the final check.  When he came back he said something like ""This coupon actually had a typo on it and it should've read half off the second meal so I took care of it for you"". I wasn't sure exactly what his glib answer ...""took care of it for you"" meant so I asked to see the coupon again and after reviewing it, asked him if we were getting the second meal for free as advertised and he said no it was a typo and the second meal would be half price. 
I asked to see the manager. 
The manager came over and asked for the coupon which I said I'd give her when we got our free meal as advertised. She said there was a typo, I said it's not our problem and we simply wanted our free meal as advertised. She seemed flummoxed but did come back with the revised check that reflected one meal being free.
As a 'local', I'd suggest if you're in the mood for Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere try Pasta Cucina at Boulder Station or the IAC on East Sahara near Eastern because at either place the service is better, the food is just as good or even better, the prices are better (read: cheaper) and there's no 'BAIT & SWITCH' going on. 
My prediction: If Mamma Olivia's keeps this egregious behavior up as their business model, they'll be out of business within 24 months.

My favorite unfiltered dame  and I visited Mamma Olivia Saturday morning after replaying their cheese wheel video a few times online. 

Helpful Tip: The cheese wheel requires two guest minimum at $16 per person. You'll have to request it as well because its a secret menu item. 

We ordered the Alfredo pasta with (2) orders of shrimp +7.00
Fritto Misto $13 is definitely a must order, The calamari was fried perfectly and the broccoli and peppers were delightful. The Marinara definitely had a unique taste and really enjoyed it as well.

The table-side cheese wheel presentation looked like ""meal to remember"". Regrettably, the pasta was flavorless. I was completely underwhelmed. Ironically the additional shrimp arrived on a separate plate with additional Alfredo sauce (which we appreciated) and taste aaaaamazing! 

$60+ lunch for two

The portion was perfect. 2 Chicken breasts topped with capers bathing in lemony buttery sauce. On the side, plenty of fresh steamed veggies (to make you feel as if you are being healthy) with 2 small mashed potato volcanos. I was in heaven. 

My husband enjoyed the lasagna. The sauce though! DELICIOUS! You can surely tell everything coming out of that kitchen is made from scratch. The cheese was still bubbling when the lasagna arrived at our table. My husband licked the bowl clean.

I had no idea it was at the mall. It is very nice inside.  A nice man sat us at our table. 
I wanted to try the cheese wheel pasta because I am a cheese-aholic. But it was not on the menu. So when he came to take our order I asked about it. He said it was $16 per person and we both had to order it. We could add sides of chicken or meatballs. We chose to do the side of meatballs. It was also a choice of fettuccine noodles or spaghetti noodles. We chose fettuccine. It is served with Alfredo sauce and they bring the cheese wheel to your table, Flambeau it table side add the pasta in the cheese wheel and mix. Presentation is fun but the taste was less than expected. I guess I had really high hopes that it would be this incredible cheesy bite after bite but it wasn't.  I barely even tasted the cheese, all I could taste was Alfredo. Then the meatballs.... the marinara sauce was good but the meatballs had lack of flavor and tasted boiled. Was not impressed at all and for 3 VERY small balls it was $5. We each had a cesar salad, pasta, meatballs and a soda and our bill was almost $80.00. (For the area of town i dont think they will be in business long wuth these prices)I also left feeling unsatisfied and definitely not full. The pasta serving for 2 was enough for 1 person to eat. 
Their bread however was amazing. Fresh, hot, thinly sliced and whatever the oil and vinegar brand that they use was so incredibly tasty! The bread and oil and vinegar is why I gave it 3 stars.
I had high hopes and left feeling badly that we cheated on our regular Italian restaurant.",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,2,0,3,197zlcPqjORbjLzmFM3sZA

We got the #cheesewheelpasta (just tasted like fettuccine alfredo), #pennealavodka (okay) & a kid's buttered pasta with cheese (so bland & there was no cheese, just the parmesan sprinkled on top).  

The server did tell us that they were on their last wheel (a new one was being delivered) & that there wasn't that much cheese left 

I'm so sad Salute Trattoria Italiana (located inside Red Rock Casino) closed  They had the best Cheese Wheel Pasta & their Kid's Mac N Cheese was the best I ever had.",cwokvpgMIPe0B_SIggrrrw,4,1,1,c5_Gp9o4qcxY2AZox3AKdg

We recommend the ravioli (sausage and also butternut squash) we also got the chicken Alfredo which was great. Mg son got the cheese pizza and loved it. Will recommend it for anyone and will be coming back.",sn6luEHokW7aNHAfmRLSjA,1,1,5,u_l04FIBu7kASKv4lDsMOw
5729527,2018-01-14,0,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"We stopped in on this spot as we were getting some glasses made at the mall and what a gem!  The service and quality isn't something you'd normally expect from a a ""mall eatery.""  Make no mistake, this restaurant is for real. 

From the time we walked in, we were greeted warmly and promptly seated. The staff worked well together to ensure we felt like values customers and explained the options available. Our server, Thalia, was great!  She took some time to understand our preferences and her recommendations were on point. 

As for the food, the portions were generous and delicious, so come hungry. I had the lasagna and it is one of my favorites so I'm pretty particular.  Absolutely no complaints. My wife had a pizza and we ended up having to take half of it home!

Bottom line:  this is a relatively new spot in town and it deserves our business. In a town primarily based on customer service, there is a new player!  We'll be back!",IZiy6U3Ey43jJXzjmjOrAg,6,1,5,UBZotR9W3PD6DECQVeDFpw
5748697,2018-05-13,1,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,Super super bummed! Went Saturday evening around 4pm. Not busy at all maybe 4 tables including ourselves. Drove out from Boulder City just to try this place as I saw this place on my IG and could not wait to try the cheese wheel. Like others have stated they don't let the cheese flambé long enough so there really is no cheese. The Alfredo sauce/ noodles were pretty plain. The bread was amazing the service was terrible. Short staffed....one man show and don't expect refills. Felt very uncomfortable asking for anything. Table behind us had appetizers and drinks comped because their dinner was taking so long. They left before eating their dinner. I'm glad the the VGK game was on to occupy us while waiting. Definitely need to hire some servers. I was really hoping to love this place as it looked so delicious. Crème brûlée was yummy but the cannolis not so much. Such a bummer really. Hopefully they can pull it together. I wanted to love it but I didn't.,l24PMmYjGWl9OyQ_hupHwg,1,0,1,LAi19lyMd-IqwnCicXINiQ
5886441,2018-04-23,0,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"My wife and I were first time patrons to this restaurant. As soon as we walked in, Josh, the Manager, greeted us like he'd known us forever. What a pleasant surprise. The restaurant atmosphere was very relaxing, and conducive to enjoy a nice dinner. Once seated, our waiter, Tucker, gave us the same reception as Josh. The food was outstanding, and just the right portions for us. Our dining was one of utmost pleasure, and Josh and Tucker didn't know what to do for us. We will definitely be back, and tell all our friends about this outstanding find.",qwtjEpBn2KmLypc1SwzmMg,0,0,5,yljNVPbD7vabEqoNO6Jzrw
5967599,2018-06-10,11,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"I first stumbled upon this place on IG. So many people were posting the amazing looking cheese wheel including the restaurant itself. I was mesmerized by that cheese wheel. They light a giant cheese wheel on fire, then toss pasta in it and mix it around and around collecting chunks of cheese to your past dish. Getting your pasta extra cheesy and flavorful. So I added this place on my list. I got my brother interested in this place too so when he came to visit, we took the fam bam on a Sunday afternoon. They had a lady doing karaoke off youtube and a laptop. Different. So me and my brother get the cheese wheel since it is a 2 person min at $16/pp. Kids get pasta pomodoro and kids meatball spaghetti. My niece got invited up to sing, so she sang ""Let it go"". She's 5. So kids food came then the cheese wheel rolled out. They poured olive oil on the cheese wheel, lit it on fire and started massaging the cheese, spreading the fire around a bit. Finally the server dumped the fettuccine alfredo into the wheel, mixed it up real good, and served it. They were decent size servings, the bowl looked small actually but it was a nice sized dish. I swear I ate and ate and ate and it didn't even look like I touched my bowl. We all dined down on our dishes and waited for the server to get togo boxes and the check. The food was mediocre, to be honest experiencing the cheese wheel wasn't as exciting as I thought it was going to be. The presentation was eh. I've dined in many Italian restaurants and tasted phenomenal Italian food. While this place wasn't the worst, it isn't enough for me to travel to Boulevard Mall to eat pasta. Sorry if I busted anyone's bubbles. If if would make you feel any better mine deflated very slowly as I ate my food.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,13,12,3,M0dIbTNS65rAj9O_nY3YZw
5988958,2018-02-03,5,WRbBmXMHmdWOkeGp21OoeA,"Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews? Let's be honest here, this place is terrible. Went here for a lunch meeting with my team and a few of us got sick. The lobster ravioli lacked flavor and some pieces were chewy and some where just rubbery and over cooked. Some of the Calamari were the same. Some co workers had salmon and they said it was extremely over cooked as well. I don't think the chef knew the difference between cooked to under cooked to over cooked. They brought out our entrees first when we ordered appetizers too. I'm sorry but for the prices they charge and how bad the food is,  please please save your money and stomach from here and go to Olive Garden or Maggianos.",uqzTF1wgYWYc5fudGRicgA,3,2,1,ofPzHgMqVJLnrHFDeAwqUw
