They do meal delivery too so just an FYI if you aren't in the area.",Fz_12VUpL5zLrtAYGQbVkw,0,0,5,qypo2iKhPAyDG_vJHG0oMQ

A good deal of thought went into this creation, even the textures involved within this wrap spoke volumes of the detail involved. They adequately blended all components to keep the flavors interesting. Like all great foods, consumption is immersion of flavor. For a quick clean bite, this place will leave your cravings satisfied and your conscience clear.",lIny-WdlhWCzHoZwBY93rg,0,0,4,KCSYkUUUdOD7GsWp_CiyYQ

I've tried the Thai Fighter wrap with chicken and it was delicious! It also came with a small kale salad which was a nice surprise. I might've liked the salad even more than the wrap. Getting the full size salad with chicken next time! 

Have not had a chance to try the smoothies here yet, but they sound really good, with a good balance of fruit and veggies in them. Next time!",U0IkjNtO0YZA6H3oreNKyQ,0,0,4,WrJHydf2Uf1ui30nWeExOw

First time, I went pre-yoga (4:06) and I mentioned that I wanted to get a quick bite before my class at 4:30p. I was the only person in the place and I ordered the lettuce wraps right away. They took 18 minutes to come out! By that time, I had to scarf my food. I appreciate that items are made to order but it's 3 pieces of lettuce and a pile of chicken mixture on a plate. 

The second time, it was after a workout and a friend and I just wanted to get a smoothie. We waited a good 5+ minutes by the counter while the manager (?) chatted with a table. When we finally coughed loud enough to get her attention, she did apologize and offered us 1/2 off our bill. But the 2 smoothies we received (Banana bread and the Chocolate one) were both extremely watery. I've had some good smoothies there before, and those were not representative of that. And there's NO way I would have felt good about paying $8 a piece for those. 

Last note: when you're signing the square receipt on the tablet, it automatically suggests adding a certain gratuity. It's so uncomfortable if you don't tip, but it's a cafe with counter service.... You shouldn't be asked to tip!

Overall, disappointed.",0KueQxXgax9GlbZ0UNaGlg,4,2,2,KT8g2jDIrJFVTMOvdVbFuQ

Every time since problems. they keep saying they just opened and are trying to get everything together. Heres an idea. DON'T OPEN TILL YOUR READY. They are constantly having ""new staff"" problems and changing their menu 
I ask every time If the produce is organic sometimes they say yes. Today they said ""it's all fresh"" what does that have to do with organic? Also I order the smoothie with CACAO and see them put in COCOA a huge difference. 

I drive 25 mins to them because they have vegan options. Today is the second time they said ""chefs won't be in till later"" who opened a restraunt without a damn chef???? There going downhill as fast as fresh mama. Looking forward to them closing and reopening a real restraunt",kTny8RFBPj9du2aIRb8V0A,0,0,1,sMRv5P9Q2SUq7eWRg_UByw
