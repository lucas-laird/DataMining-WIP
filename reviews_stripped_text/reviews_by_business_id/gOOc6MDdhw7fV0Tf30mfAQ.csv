The staff was fantastic: polite, considerate. They made me feel warm and cuddly with their constant checking in. The propieter even made a round of the tables, asking the guests if they wanted water, a to-go box, etc.

I ordered their catfish basket with french fries; a Sprite on the side. My total was $11.35 for a good handful of seasoned fries, 4 pieces of free-range catfish that were at least 6"" in length and a huge soda. I could be prickly about the expensivity of the meal; however, ingredient costs have skyrocketed in recent months, so it's totally understandable.

disappointed that they use all plastyic utensils, plates, etc.  but again, not a biggie.

this is the kind of local place that you hope will succeed.  and sorry, had to pass on the grits.  low carbin'",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,4,2,4,OXYzkhyo9JULKwrjp0HxDw

The place is small but they seem to have a system that works. No holding tables and by the time you food is ready there should be a seat available. I did see them kick a couple of people of people out of their seats because they were holding tables while there were others who had already placed their order. The lady was really nice about asking her to allow the other people to sit down.

1212460,2017-04-08,0,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"Very good food...I came here on an early Saturday afternoon with expectations to be waiting forever and the wait was not that bad. I've honestly waited far longer for food. The inside is pretty cramped and you have to keep an eye out in order to find a seat. However, because it was just me and one other person, we were able to snag a small, two seat table before our food came out.

I ordered the mix and match which comes with choice of two meats, two sides and a bread. I chose chicken wings, catfish, cheese eggs, grits and a biscuit. And, being the gluttonous person that I am, I also ordered a waffle because I really wanted one! I am glad that I did, because it was my favorite part of the meal. It is was slightly crispy but yet soft and it had a great taste. My only small gripe was the syrup wasn't high quality, but I am a little dramatic when it comes to syrup. Either way, the waffle was still bomb. So, after I crushed over the waffle for a while, I got to my main entree and it was delicious. The grits were perfect. In case you didn't know, grits are a science, but they got it right. The fish and chicken was crispy and flavorful and the eggs were perfect. No extra charge for cheese! Score. Unfortunately, I was overambitious and was full before I was even halfway through, but it was so worth it. The leftovers weren't as good, sadly, but I also didn't have anything to heat them up. So, don't let that stop you from munching on yours throughout the day, because it is likely you will have leftovers.

There was an awkward moment when, who I assume was a manager, became irritated with the cashier. I felt a tad bad for the lady because she was doing her best to keep the line moving and I didn't like how she made these comments in front of customers.

Anyway, I will definitely visit Gritz when I am back in Vegas. It is great food for reasonable prices and it is a pretty cheap Uber or Lyft ride from the strip, if you are from out of town. And, it is a relief from some of the other food options in the surrounding area.",KEweJ1qFtkYYrhXeLgRmyg,2,5,4,WivySaMdMzc1oj5smO2fTw

If you're visiting and don't have a car it's merely a $10 Uber ride which is more than worth it. If you do live in Vegas then it's literally five or 10 minutes from the strip. 
It's family-owned which I always love because not only is it mom and pop can definitely see the mom-and-pop feeling here. It's like being in your own grandma's kitchen. The staff is friendly and will answer and help you out with any questions you may have. The food after the experience simply awesome.

Located across the street from the FBI building, you blink and you just might miss it.  If located, Gritz is small, clean and takes on home cooking in a simple yet sophisticated manner.

It's at the counter ordering and this includes the drinks.  When the cup (containing coffee) run empty, head to the counter.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.

I ordered up the biscuits and gravy, each topped with a country sausage gravy and comes with two eggs (any style).  The biscuits were soft and the gravy divine. There is just enough to satisfy without saturating your plate.  Upon further reflection there is just enough gravy to keep you from going and ordering another batch, even though deep down inside you want to put yourself into a gravy coma.

NOW..for the name sake minus a slight change in spelling.  The grits are the best I have ever had.  They are of perfect consistency all the way through.  They do not convert to a slushy cream of wheat mixture the further down the bowl you go.  PLUS-you can add grits toppings for an additional 75 cents each.  Those toppings are cheese, bacon, mushrooms, onions or jalape√±os.  I had cheese and bacon.....it was awesome.

My sister who visited from San Diego is the one who told is about this place and naturally, we came here to give her what she wanted. It was a trip worth made! The food was made fresh and hot and the flavors of our dishes were all very savory. We were cared for very well by the staff.

The chicken was seasoned well. So well that even my ""to-go"" several hours later was still tasty. The fish was piping hot and my boyfriend vacuumed that all up. LOL! He was literally inhaling his meal.  I would say my only disappointment was the waffle. It was a little overcooked and I didn't enjoy as much as my other food.

1902801,2017-07-04,0,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"I first came here in 2013 at the recommendation of an old lady who helped me at the local post office as I prepared to go overseas for a few years. Upon coming back to Las Vegas for vacation, I really wanted to see if this place was as good as I remember from 3-4 years ago. It was.

This is an African-American owned establishment that excels in very good savory cuisine. I absolutely LOVE chicken and waffles and have had them at Roscoe's in LA and Harlem at multiple joints, and this place hands down is better.

Since I stay on the new strip for vacation, it is about a $6-10 UBER to get here but well worth it.  They have ample parking if you have a car on your vacation, so that saves you on the taxi fare. 

The establishment is decently sized, as you come in there is a trash can to your right and clean bathrooms for men and women behind a partition wall. As you look ahead from the entrance you see the counter where a nice person always greets you. 3-4 years ago it was a elderly lady, this time it was a younger lady, both were amazingly nice. You order at the counter and grab a seat. Unfortunately, their Credit Card machine does not allow you to leave a tip, so if you intend to use card, I recommend bringing some cash to drop in the tip jar.

There are about 5-8 4 person tables and a few 2 person tables in the joint but I would not call the seating area huge. Your orders are made from scratch so expect to wait about 15-20 minutes for them to get your order together. As I said above, I love chicken and waffles so I always get it with the wife. It runs about $11 an order, you get 4 giant wings (flat & leg) with a waffle. With 2 drinks and a side order of a red hot, the bill came out to $33 after taxes. 

The food as always comes out hot, to order and amazing. The hot sauce goes perfect with the nice crispy hot wings. I will be back again in the future as long as this place stays open. While we were eating about 10 other couples rolled through so it is really popular.

The good:
- The prices were reasonable for the amount of food.  4 large wingsm a biscuit, a juice, some potatoes and grits were like $14.
- The potatoes were tasty, with onions and green peppers in them.
- The grits were creamy and smooth.  They have a variety of things you can mix into them.  

The bad:
- The food came out around 5 million degrees Celsius.  I want fresh and hot food, but daaaaamn, after 10 minutes sitting on my plate, a piece of fried chicken hit me in the face after I broke the wing, and it scalded me.  The food was HOT coming out.  Too hot for me.  I want to be able to eat within a few minutes.
- The potatoes were mushy.  The breakfast potatoes, while tasty, were way overcooked.  They were pretty much mush.
- The biscuit was the size of a silver dollar, and was hard as a rock.  Took 2 bites, but it was like hard drywall.  I am sure I just got a stale one, but still.
- Minute maid or some other kind of concentrated orange juice.  I get not everyone is going to make fresh OJ, AND the juice here is very reasonably priced, since it is concentrate.  I mean, I think a big OJ is like $1.50 or something, which is fair for what it is.  I just would like some real juice.
-Plastic silverware, paper plates and Styrofoam containers, even if you are eating in.  I don't know, but for me, eating out of plastic and Styrofoam affects the taste of the food, just like drinking Coke out of a glass bottle improves it.
-The fried chicken was pretty ""meh"" for me.  It was not bad by any stretch, and I certainly would not have any issues eating it, but I would not seek it out and I was not blown away by it.  I was expecting some incredible bird after the reviews I read, but no so much.

Overall, it was a big let down for me, but was not horrific.  I would consider trying it again for lunch for a shrimp po' boy or something to see if it was good, but breakfast is pretty much done for me.

Their rude staff sucks big time! We are in Nevada if I spend money why not give a nice size cup of water its a desert out their. They seem to look down on you because you don't want a soda. But I just spent 30 bucks ugh! Now I have to spend 2 more bucks for water. lol Last I checked tap water is free. Its not as if they give you bottle water. Also I asked if the pudding is made from scratch. I was told yes. So I bought the pudding. However when I got home I could not believe my eyes. The pudding was box made. I Deceive you not people. 
So I jumped back into my SUV and ran back across town to gritz. I was met by the same older lady who had lied to my face. OMG you think you can trust someone thats old enough to be your grand mother. 
Ugh! but anyway when I told her why I was back and that I wanted a refund she gave a piss poor excuse as to why she deceived me. She said I think of gritz cafe as my home so I used box pudding and to me thats home made. 
I replied only a person who cant cook would give an excuse such as this. Gas is not cheap and you lady just are a pure liar. She wasted my time and money.

I, too, enjoyed the catfish. It's an abundant amount (4). The coating is a seasoned cornmeal. The chicken wings are as good as they look. The floured dredge is lightly seasoned. I appreciate the hint of onion powder! We could not leave without trying the waffle. If you like a waffle that a bit of a crisp outer edge, this is the one. That's a sign of BUTTER in the batter . . . Mmmm! Their coffee is good. I appreciate the option of flavored creamers, if that's your preference.

Nonetheless, I thought the food was pretty good. The catfish was delicious. I also had greens, but it didn't taste as good as homemade. The cornbread was okay; I've had better.

The waiters were really attentive. This could have been due to them being really nice or the place being super small; there were less than 10 tables. So, if you plan on bringing a big party, you might want to set up a reservation (if they take them) or just head somewhere else.

I like my waffles soft and was initially wary about how crunchy the first bite was, but after the syrup had a chance to soften those bad boys up, I was transported to a world of sweet, soft buttery goodness. 

Wings were quite juicy. Breading wasn't too. thick. Next time I come, I might get catfish and waffles cuz they liked pretty good too. Note: One order of chicken and waffles comes with four large wings which was more than enough for this chubster. Glad Daniel was there to split it with me and catch my good side. 

The seating area is small and it was crowded¬† initially but the turn-around is quick so we didn't wait that long at all to order and get a for a table for two.

This is Soul food at its finest.  We had their chicken and waffles which comes with one waffle and 3 whole chicken wings.  I made love to them chicken wings.  I don't leave any meat, skin, or cartilage on the bone.  The bone is sucked dry and rightfully so as it is perfectly seasonsed with the delicious cripsness.  The waffles are similar to Roscoe's in texture but the flavor was really good.  I wish the waffles were a little crisp but they are more of a pancake waffle texture.

In addition to the chicken and waffles, we tried their Grits which were butterty, rich, and went down smoothly with the Chicken and Waffles.  Throw in a side of greens and 2 drinks and w/o the Groupon it was only $21. 

Ok I'm not being racist here but you have to judge the food by its loyal customers.  For instance, if you go to a Korean restaurant and see 99% white people, it's probably not good....right?   As we walked into Gritz with all 9 of its tables, we were the only non-AA people there.   To me, that means I hit the jackpot when it comes to soul food.  Sorry....I had to go there....but it's true.  At least I'll say it :)

The owners were super nice and chatted with us about the food.  We told them we'll be back and for good reason.  Cheap, delicious, home comfort food at its finest.

It's a very casual joint and your food is served on plastic plates with plastic utensils. The staff was polite and very attentive. 

I ordered chicken and waffles and a side of cheese grits. My friend ordered the mix and match which included two wings, two pieces of catfish, and eggs and instead of toast a waffle. 

This mess was beyond delicious. The chicken and waffles came with FOUR CHICKEN WINGS. FOUR!!!! Four chicken wings and a waffle for 12 bucks. These chicken wings weren't rinky dinky either. The flavor was sooo good. The waffle was just okay. There's nothing like a Roscoe's waffle. I nibbled on my friends catfish and it was so good. Reminded me of my grandmas.

Now, you can't go to a restaurant named GRITZ and not try the grits. They were delicious! The perfect smooth consistency, no lumps no grains...just cream buttery goodness. I had cheddar cheese added to my grits and I thought I was gonna explode from eating too much goodness. Well I go back?

The size of the place is very deceiving and the place was packed the entire time I waited inside. It's extremely small with a limited amount of tables to eat-in. My party ordered dinners that consisted of catfish, chicken wings, greens, grits bowl, yams, cornbread, and waffles. We had other sides but, forgot what they were. However, I really wanted to love this place but, wasn't overly impressed as I hoped to be. We were standing waiting for our food for well over an hour and eventually, was forced to eat in our car because of no seating and was also, a wait on tables. As for the food, it was pretty average. My daughter hated the yams and said they tasted weird and wasn't sweet. The chicken was alright but, I preferred another area soulfood place in the area a little better that I visit when I'm in town. My hubby loved the grits bowl with eggs. He said the waffle was average and probably would've been better if he'd have eaten it hot inside instead of a container that made it soft after a few minutes. Both my daughter and he too, agreed that the other soulfood place had better tasting chicken wings. I personally, liked their greens but, they needed a little salt to my liking so, I added some. My daughter enjoyed her catfish but, I thought it needed a little salt too. The cornbread was average, and not bad. We were given complimentary soft drinks, and lemon cake slices because we waited so long which, was cool.

I got The Louisiana:  juicy hot links served with 2 sides, and bread (toast, English muffin, or biscuit).  I chose to get Macaroni & Cheese, Greens, and Cornbread, and a Sweet tea.

The sausage was really, really good. It's either the way they cooked them, or the sausages themselves, but they tasted like they were cooked over a wood grill or something. They were really, really delicious, and I would get them again. The cornbread was really good too. Out of the sides, the macaroni and cheese was ok, the cheese sauce was a little watery but the noodles were al dente which I like.  The greens were really good, with ham, kind of salty but I think supposed to be.

My husband got the Big Gritz Breakfast: Chicken or Fish, two eggs, grits and waffle. He chose the fried Chicken, and added Bacon, Onion and Cheese to his grits.  The eggs were cooked Over-medium. 

The chicken was nicely fried, and there was a large portion. The waffle was good, a little on the thin side (not super fluffly) but tasted pretty good.   The gritz were really good and tasty, especially putting the egg in and mixing it around. The yolk was runny enough so the eggs were really cooked perfectly.  

Overall we really enjoyed our food and the sweet tea.  I didn't feel too healthy after eating all this food but it was definitely delicious and enjoyable. Everyone was really nice and constantly asked if we needed anything.  

The 2-seater round tables were kind of tiny, and we didn't have too much room for the utensils, plates of food, tray of sauces, and napkins, and drinks.

After about the 3rd piece of chicken, he asked to try a piece of my chicken!  and he really liked it!  He said he was glad he tasted mine, because it left a good taste in his mouth.

This is a really tight spot filled with two and four tops, so coming here with five or more people will probably end up in a longer wait than usual. We split the Big Breakfast of Chicken(or your choice of Fried Catfish) and Waffles, two eggs, and grits(first grits topping is free) and we also split The Rich Boy(AKA Shrimp Po' Boy) which came with 8 crisp, juicy shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and their special sauce on a toasted hoagie roll.

The chicken was good(all chicken wings) but I still like the fried chicken from Kathy's
and the waffle was so-so. I have yet to find a good place in Vegas that has solid chicken and waffles(still have to try Skinnyfats' version) but the Rich Boy was very delicious and I'd return for that sandwich again.

I wasn't a big fan of the chicken and just felt the need to pour more and more hot sauce on it to make up for it.

I didn't play it safe on the side though and decided to try out the grits.  Problem was I had no idea what to do with them.  I tried to make them sweet with sugar packets and jelly but it just wasn't working.  I might to do more research on what to do with grits or just be lazy and just order the potatoes on the side if I ever do come back here.

* Nice cozy inside
* Good service
* Price a little high for what you get - lower the price and its fine. Or, keep the cost the same but raise the level of execution.

Was not expecting this place to be as good as it was and it caught all of us by surprise. It is way north of the strip, but so worth the drive. Gritz Caf√© is located on a small street off of MLK road in a business park/strip mall. 

As we walked in we noticed the place was very small (about 10 tables) and it smelled like Heaven. The staff greeted us right away, gave us menus, and told us to take our time ordering. We felt right at home when we walked in the door as the staff reminded us of our family members and their good home cooking. It was great to see the variety of main and side item choices on the menu. I selected the Louisiana, which was a hot link plate and a side of grits with bacon bits (first toping is free) and greens; and a piece of cornbread. My friends order fried chicken, fried catfish, waffles, mac n' cheese, greens, and eggs. 

Our food was brought out one by one by a wonderful server who was very attentive and sweet. The food was very hot, fresh, and flavorful. The hot links had just the right amount of spice, the grits(z) were smooth and creamy, and the greens were seasoned just right that I did not even need any hot sauce! (smile) All of us shared our food, so I got a chance to try the mac n' cheese and waffles that were just as flavorful and wonderful. We spent the entire meal talking about how awesome the food was and how we want to come back the next time we were in Vegas. The only thing missing in the restaurant was some cots as we all needed a nap afterwards. (smile)

I chose the three slices of bacon and I got cheddar cheese on the top.  I asked for the egg sunny side up.  It also came with a choice of toast or biscuit and I got whole wheat toast.  

I left the counter carrying my coffee cup and within a relatively short time, a young woman brought my breakfast to me.  Wow, was it good!  Break the yolk, and let it run into the grits along with the butter I had already put in.  Wonderful.

The restaurant is small--nine tables.  There was a couple with two small children at the other table--I hit a quiet morning--and they were visiting from California.  That's the kind of homey atmosphere the place has.

Adam, the young man taking orders today, was a very pleasant guy! 

This is stick to your ribs down home cooking.  What that means is that breakfast was heavy laden with carbs so I'll have to do extra at my gym workout this afternoon.  Oh the horror, but it was so worth it.

The fish is always  cooked perfectly and hot! The eggs were scrambled well and the service is good. I feel safe in the neighborhood due to the restaurant being located by the Metro police headquarters and the FBI building. 

It is great going out of town and seeing a black owned restaurant, with good food and great service! Thank you so much and I wish you prosperity to remain a successful business that will expand :)!",oamuNOhuX4B5F1rWQhCK6A,2,1,5,1Zxd3yDC5Ejy3XTVRFFPdw
3988070,2013-10-08,2,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"My wife found this hidden gem from reading all the good reviews from fellow Yelpers. So thank you!! Have been looking for a good southern food establishment. This restaurant fits the bill.

Took my Dad here a couple of weeks ago for his birthday breakfast. Located in West Las Vegas on Stella Lake just west of MLK. It's located in a small building right next to the police substation. Located in a nice new building, it is quite small inside, maybe 6 tables, mostly 2 tops and a couple larger 4 top tables. No problem. As good as the food was i would of sat on the floor or out on the grass to eat. 

First of all this place smells amazing. I knew we were in for a treat. Finally found food just as good as when I lived in Mississippi. My Dad ordered the mix and match. you pick 2 meats, 2 sides and choice of bread. He chose the chicken wings, catfish, along with grits, potatoes, and toast. Just a shout out to the Catfish. It was hot, moist, delicious flavor and one of the best crusted coating batters i have ever had. Southerners everywhere would be proud. Grits were creamy and cooked perfect. Awesome all the way around.

I ordered the chicken and waffles. Really was looking forward to trying this, and I was not dissapointed. You get 4 large chicken wings. They were seasoned perfectly, and piping hot. So hot in fact it stayed that was the entire meal. It just would'nt cool down. lol. The waffle was delicious, light and fluffy. Pour the maple syrup on everything and it was southern hospitality on a plate. Really Really Good!!

Breakfast is served all day. A lot of the plates are named after southern states. Such as the Arkansas. Country Chicken fried steak and gravy. The Virginia. Grilled ham steak. All plates are served with 2 eggs, grits or potatoes and bread, muffin or biscuit.

Overall a great place to get your Southern Fix on. Friendly service, great Southern food, large portions, and good prices. Give it a try!!",0grZ4N1UYPZmRvv3lXJuJA,6,2,5,Rj0113ZRU1_lTHEB7DNlxg

We ordered Louisiana links and eggs for my date and chicken and waffles for me. They ran out of full wings so they offered me party wings instead. While we were finishing up our order I noticed the catfish and waffles that was waiting to be served which looked yummy so I asked if I can have half wings and half catfish instead. The cashier said they normally don't' do it but she was super nice and let me have it instead. When our food was served, I was given a full order of wings instead and I mentioned the mistake. Told them not to worry about it and I'll just eat what I had(which was a lot) but they insisted to give the catfish too. That's what I call good service.

Anyway, our food was piping hot. Hubby loved his links and eggs. The links were juicy and flavorful. I wasn't able to get a picture because he wolfed it all down. My party wings were crunchy in the outside and juicy in the inside. They complimented the waffles really well. The catfish was good too but I preferred the wings. I liked their hot sauce too. Not too spicy, just right. 

With 5 star service and very good, affordable food, we will be back. Looking forward to trying their shrimp and grits.",lgoMChnRVAP_s_OgHQa56Q,1,0,5,w5e7zIW3SmSCOGjcvvpNRA

4052485,2016-01-17,10,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"I Love Me Some Gritz!!

Quick Review: 
I've had Gritz Caf√© bookmarked for over 2 years and finally checked them off my list.  I recommend that you head out here if you're craving a mean bowl of grits and an even meaner Chicken & Waffles.  Gritz Caf√© does it right.  Gritz Caf√© does it good.   

The Food:
I had their Big Gritz Breakfast.  This meal consisted of their 5 pieces of fried chicken, waffles, 2 eggs, and a cup of grits.  Cost is about $15 and you get a lot. The grits was thick and creamy, which is exactly how I prefer it.  As for the chicken & waffles, it was delicious.  The fried chicken wings is perfectly seasoned and breaded. 

The Service:
5 Stars for their service. Emma was awesome.  She made sure that we were comfortable and even moved us to another table with more room. 

The Establishment:
The restaurant is small, and it's busy. Tables are also first come, first serve.  My suggestion is to come early or call in your order.  There's also seating outside and It's called the sidewalk.   

Tips:  
-The food comes out hot.  Take your time or you'll burn your mouth. 
-Located off Lake Mead and MLK.

4116062,2015-07-03,0,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,I liked my meal ok and think this place will get another shot. I had biscuits and gravy. I don't like eggs much so I asked for just the biscuits and they didn't charge me for my coffee which I liked. The diner was as clean a looking and smelling establishment as I have ever seen and I'm a chef with 20+ years on the job. The staff were friendly and welcoming and nice. They don't have a wait staff per se you order and pick up from the counter but one of  the ladies brought my plate over. All food is on plastic throwaway flatware etc. My server noticed the portion was light and immediately took it back told the cook to fix it. I like the attentiveness of the server but at 10.50 for biscuits and gravy the cook should have known better since they had just opened and were not busy.. The biscuits were fresh the gravy was tasty but a little cool and again for over 10 bucks 3 biscuits is not outrageous portion vs food cost. I like the food and service overall but for breakfast the lack of traditional waitstaff and plastic ware will take some getting used to but I will come back as its down home cooking close to my house.,FKH6bgsPuaoH_cQJopBEBg,0,0,3,WZho1lGaahMhz9hf_XLYXg

By the time we got our food two more chairs became available. I ordered the simplest meal on the menu: Grits, an egg over medium and twelve shrimps half grilled and the other half fried. I explained to our server that I was missing six shrimps. She then said no you only ordered six, she then brings my receipt and it CLEARLY showed I ordered twelve.

I don't like grits, and maybe I figured they had more than that! She didn't give me anymore suggestions, so I went with the chicken and waffles. 

I waited almost 20 minutes and my food came out, in a to go container.... I told her I was staying to eat. She seemed pissy with me, and thats something I do not like.

We ordered: Big Gritz Breakfast ($15.50), The Alabama ($9.95), The Mississippi ($10.95), two side of Grits ($3/each).

PROS: Grits - creamy, thick and smooth.  I will ask for no salt, pepper and butter next time.  Hand-breaded fried catfish is the best I've had in a while.  My daughter, husband and I all loved it!!!  We fought over the last piece.  Everyone behind the counter remembered my husband's name when we left.

Gritz is an unassuming place, located off of MLK, and it happens to be almost directly across the street from the FBI! Yes indeed - there it was, the FBI.

My friend and I trekked here for lunch around 1 PM on a weekday. I was half expecting the place to be packed and we'd have to take our food to go, but I was pleasantly surprised we were able to eat there. It is a small place, with a few tables, and some two-tops along the back wall. 

Ordering is done before you seat yourself and then the food is delivered out to you, as well as your fountain drink.

I got the PO BOY - Fried Catfish served on a 6"" grilled hoagie roll with lettuce, tomatoes, and special sauce ($8.50). I am a fan of fried catfish. I have had it fished out of a river, and fried up right before my eyes at many family gatherings in Texas. This fried catfish was wonderful! The crispiness of the fish was perfect, whatever recipe they are using is damn good. The sandwich itself is perfectly portioned with lettuce, cut tomatoes and their special sauce. I also added a good dousing of hot sauce on mine. I was in catfish sandwich (er, PO BOY) HEAVEN.

The restaurant itself is clean and tidy. Service is on point. I will be back!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,5,cYnUaDo4hWt_oF1BdVbN4w

I'm originally from the south so to come to the west coast and find some amazing soul food was so fullfilling. The staff was extremely hospitable. The restaurant itself is a mom and pop establishment so you can tell that the meals are prepared from the heart and with LOVE. Wish I could bring this place back with me to LA.

Waffles are so yummy. I barely needed any syrup on them. Chicken is cooked perfectly. It looks like Popeyes Chicken (you know how their chicken always looks perfect) but the flavor is amazing! Each bite I could literally taste all the different seasonings. 

Corn bread was too small (only because I'm a fatty Mic Fat Fat) lol

Country fried steak was a-may-zing (only overwatch fans will get that one) I think my only complaint if I had one, would be a little too much gravy. But I can easily take some off.

4613232,2015-06-28,0,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"I had breakfast here a few weeks ago. It was great! For starters..the restaurant is clean..it may be a bit small, but not overly so. We stopped in around 9 or 10 in the morning and it wasn't crowded at all. No seating issues whatsoever. Just so you know, you order at the counter and someone brings out the food. The ladies that assisted us were very friendly.

The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I had the grits bowl with catfish and boy was it good! It had been a while since I had a bowl of grits so it was very satisfying. The fish was fresh and delicious. While the piece could have been a bit larger, it was hot and it was well prepared. The bowl had grits and an egg. It was great in it's simplicity. Hind sight, I wish that I had have ordered sausage or bacon because it would have been great adding it to the bowl. The idea of crumbling up the fish and adding it to my grits bowl didn't appeal to me so I ate it on the side as it came.

Since I enjoyed my breakfast so much, I decided to try some dessert because they had one of my favorites on the menu...peach cobbler! I asked the young lady who assisted us to warm it up for me and she did..I enjoyed this peach cobbler. It was a FIRST. Everywhere I've gone and have ordered it, I've been disappointed. Theirs was very good and made with good ingredients. They didn't skimp on the butter and REAL vanilla as these are two key ingredients to a good cobbler.

I like the premise of this restaurant. Grits are way underrated in my opinion. They have more to offer than just grits. I saw someone's plate of chicken and waffles and I almost broke my neck as it was brought to their table..LOL!! The fried chicken looked beautiful...golden brown..I'll definitely try it at some point.

4735788,2011-08-14,4,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"The first time I had grits was in basic training.  The first morning of basic training was the first hellish day: we had to eat breakfast together at the same time and in 3 minutes flat.  I thought omelet, toast, links, and a medium glass of orange juice was going be easy, but hell no! So, all morning during our combat timed exercises, I was running on secretly stored fat in  the body to substantiate for energy, oh, and water that TSGT. verbally (every 3 seconds) emphasized water or his spits coming from his fierce mouth as he curses us throughout the long days.
The second morning, I quickly scanned the food line and thought to myself, ""....fn, yeah, I need something fast-3 min quick like soup with some texture for my stomach (who makes soup in the mornings?)!...""
Then it hit me, I saw someone in front of me grab a bowl of white sandy pebbles that looked like the cousin of oatmeal: GRITS.
It was March 2000 that I was introduced to Grits.  Every morning for about 4 months I'd eat grits bland & snuck a bacon for flavor (thinking I created my own recipe for a moment, what ever works is my modo).  

I LOVE grits, therefore, I love this place.  It's located in front of (diagonal like) the FBI building on Lakemead b4 Martin Luther King Blvd.  The place is small to almost medium sized seating area with 9 tables( four of them are 2 people tables, 5 of them are for 4people tables), just get there early or hope once you walk in you see peeps walk out.  I had the Mississippi plate (about 6 strips of well seasoned fried catfish, 2 sunny side eggs, a small bowl of chosen: cheddar & bacon grits, and a moist/flakey biscuit).  Next time, I am just getting the big bowl of grits with catfish, cheddar, & bacon. My Wife had the plate with hot links(tasty) with jalape√±o in her grits.  I bought a Groupon: $7 for $15 & just today, Danna bought one (so 4sure, we'll be back).  I saw a lot of people before me order their food ""2go"", smart but I wanted grits fresh & now.  I do not like waiting but if it's food that people at their tables licking their fingers like they're in the comfort of their home, well, why not?

Her sandwich came out within 6 minutes but I waited 25 minutes for my meal. After the 20 minute mark I asked one of the workers if my order was coming up soon and she replied with a sarcastic ""no it's not"" and then cackled like that was funny. 

When I finally received the wings I realized why it's called ""fowl."" The chicken was dried and unseasoned. Eating them filled me with a sense of sorrow. I became depressed thinking multiple chickens sacrificed their appendages for this soulless food. I contemplated vegetarianism.

The lady came over and CLEANED EVERY TABLE BUT OURS and didn't even give us a cloth to clean the table ourselves!

5029305,2015-08-24,0,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"The Good:
The food is GOOD. Period. The catfish - great, the grits - excellent, sausage - off the chain. Waffle: flavor excellent; but mine was cold and a bit hard likely from sitting in a holding-oven, but i'd give it another shot one day. It's in a nicely seculded area and there is a police station next door. Plenty of free parking if you're visiting from the strip; It's not that far of a drive. Prices are great!

The Bad:
When you walk in, you are not seated. You will have to stand in line to order first, then seat yourself. I've heard it can be slow, but I think my ""tip"" got our food a bit faster when I ordered :-).

The Ugly:
The facility is EXTREMELY small. I would say no more than 12 small tables are in there. So, grab a menu from the front counter, figure out what you want, and if you're dining in, send a drone from your party to grab a table while you're in line. I noticed a lot of people take-out.

I don't order fried chicken often...usually it's just not my dish.  A ""soulless"" piece of dried up, battered bird with no love.  First bite, deep fried grease drippin down your chin...you get the idea.

Thankfully, Gritz Cafe is different...in a GREAT way!

Chicken & Waffles ($10.95). Gotta be some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had! So much flavor...so juicy...and everything tastes great with Maple syrup poured on it!  Batter has spices and flavor hiding inside, with a nice slightly crispy-crunchy consistency.

Waffle was good, not mind blowing good, but combining it with the chicken takes it up to another level!  Pretty basic waffle, but the chicken is where it's at!

I plan to be back to try the Catfish!  That's actually what I came here for initially, but breakfast moods swayed me!

I'm always up for some good Southern cooking but if the area looks like I could get shot any time then, forget it! In fact, there's a place a block away from Gritz Cafe that supposedly has good catfish and a group of Yelpers actually went a few months ago. I saw pictures of the place and decided it would be smart for me not to go even as a group. I'm glad to say that Gritz Cafe is a clean, safe place with good food.

They only have a few tables. The service was superb and absolutely friendly. The food was served fresh and hot. We got catfish with grits and mac and cheese, and chicken and waffles. Their sweet tea was less sweet compared to most places that serve sweet tea.

Catfish:
Seasoned, battered in corn meal and fried to perfection. Put some hot sauce and it's perfect! I've had terrible catfish in the past and I was also raised to not eat catfish since ""it's a bottom feeder that eats garbage"" so for me to like this speaks highly of this place. 5/5

Chicken and Waffles:
I'm a Roscoe's fan so I would have to compare their chicken and waffles with GC's. GC has 4 huge chicken wings. Roscoe's lets you choose what parts you want. BUT GC's fried chicken was just as delicious. Super hot (temperature-wise), crunchy and well-seasoned. As for the waffles...well, they were marginal.

5458353,2017-04-14,0,gOOc6MDdhw7fV0Tf30mfAQ,"We decided to try out Gritz because of the IG posts. We arrived about 10:45 am and the first thing we noticed was the small interior and that there were no available seats. Now at best the inside has 10 tables and the lady at the register said they have outdoor seating so we were like ""alright."" Initially the lack of seating had us trying to figure out where we would eat our food and if it was worth it to eat in the car or just go elsewhere. Now what the lady at the register failed to mention was outdoor eating consisted of ONLY 2 tables. One table was taken by a family of 5. Our party consisted of 3 people. We only had the option of an outdoor table with 2 chairs. Luckily after seating outside for a few a table inside became available and we were able to dine inside. 

To order you must stand in line and once at the register provide your name and place your order. Once your food is ready it is brought to you. Since we didn't have a table my food could not be brought to me. When I approached to pick up my food the lady commented that I didn't have a table and where was I seating. Her tone rubbed me wrong it was as if she couldn't see they did not have an available table and that it was not my responsibility to bring my own table. I responded with we were told there is an outdoor seating area but unbeknownst to me the seating area was a joke. I do not understand how or why a person will invest in a restaurant with limited seating capacity. 

Let's discuss the food. We had fish, chicken, yams, Mac n cheese, grits, eggs, lemon cake, cornbread, white bread, and rolls. To start off let's make mention that we are Southerners....from where you may ask? Oh, just the great state of Louisiana. So for a restaurant to refer to themselves as ""southern cooking"" and not live up to it is blasphemy. Just saying. Well one thing is evident, the kitchen does not stock seasoning and if they do the cook does not know how to use it which results in bland on top of bland wrapped in bland. Did I mention the food was shall I say, bland? My friend commented the best part of the meal was the fountain drink. I guess I should be happy that they did not have peach cobbler available. If you can't make good fried chicken and catfish you are not whipping up any award winning cobbler. My friend ordered the lemon cake as that was the only dessert available and she took one bite, stared down at the cake, closed it up and was through all together. 

Now the food isn't awful but it is not good. It is not worth the price. We tried it but will not be back. Also the staff member that was responsible for ensuring the order was right when brought really must not have been paying attention. Three times my friends had to get up to ask for something they were suppose to get with their order and didn't from drinks to bread to the cake. 

If you do not pay attention to anything else I say remember to BYOT [Bring your own Table].",TgMoYlTbvWJQpoJdbOeVbA,5,0,2,I4skE1lZBDy1D9AHsapFQQ

Coming straight from the gym, we were both famished and ready to eat.  From the time we walked in the door, Emma, our waitress provided the friendliest customer service we've had in a long time.  She greeted us as we sat down, cleaned off the table that she noticed was a bit dirty, attempted to fix our wobbly table, and when that didn't work moved us to a table for four even though there were only the two of us.  After perusing the menu, customers order at the counter and then the food is brought out.  As others have stated, this is a small place, so we were lucky to snag a table right before 10:00am.  There was a steady line of customers when we were there, but several were to-go orders.  
I had the fried chicken and waffles, which is a big waffle served with 4 fried chicken wings.  The fried chicken was piping hot, tasty, and not greasy at all.  Using my hands to dig in, this was not a neat meal by an means, but it was good.  Emma checked on us often as did the other waitress there.

It's very small and modest inside but they still have a medium size menu. Other items are also tasty and they have the tea/cool-aid/orange juice combos but the main reason to go is the incredible chicken and waffles,rtqecF2RWslQyzvcCeom6w,0,0,5,dGGR-Mlz6Zn-AEeSzmxbCg

The reviews on yelp said the place is tiny, a bit slow (as they cook to order) and terribly busy on weekends.  For my visit, I came on a Tuesday at 11:15, right before a normal lunch rush. 

When I walked in, I was relieved to see there were a few empty tables.  Yelpers weren't kidding. This place had 9 or 10 tables, and no where to really stand if you were waiting for food or a table.  There were a few tables outside, and fortunately it wasn't hot that day.

The staff greeted us, and handed us a menu.  I narrowed my choice to the Kentucky: wings + 2 sides, which I chose grits and yams.  An order of grits came with 1 topping, so I chose bacon... truly not a healthy meal, is it?

Stephen chose the Louisiana Hot Link sausage, eggs, and grits with bacon AND cheese (0.75 more for an extra topping).  He chose cornbread while I chose a biscuit.

The food took about 20 minutes, and while we waited, we were served our drinks. Sweet tea for me, diet coke for Stephen.  She even stopped to give us refills.  Top notch service.

The meal was delicious, and not overly greasy.  It didn't look like a lot of food, but it took a while for me to finish it... and I was truly full all day. Even when we had a late dinner at 9:30, I wasn't really that hungry.  I'll be back for more, but will visit only if it's mid-week.  The boss lady said if you come on weekends, show up at 7:00 am or be prepared to wait!",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,9,5,5,D_Mv8ZawlPjLYYzUM1C8vw

We got there a little before noon (if memory serves) and there was a line out the door!  They move you through fairly quickly, although tables are at a premium.  

I think most people take the food to go.  We ended up sharing a table (by choice, not because we were forced to or anything) with a lovely couple and their adorable daughter.

The food is so so delicious.  My boyfriend declared that the grits are some of the best he's had since moving to the southwest.  Not being from the South, grits aren't really my thing, but everything else was absolutely delicious.

Everyone is really friendly, and it seemed like a lot of the business was made up of repeat customers.

It is reasonably priced, IF you aren't being a fatty. The average person would spend $10- $15. We spent  $35/two people + tip. The service was great! They were friendly and attentive.
