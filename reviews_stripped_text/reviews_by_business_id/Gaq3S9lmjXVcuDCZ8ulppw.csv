18838,2011-02-26,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"We came here at the recommendation of a friend who lives in Vegas after mentioning wanting to go to Nobu for dinner. (I'm from NY and like the Nobu location there). The decor is adequate, but the music was really odd for a restaurant: one of the first songs we heard was about eating pussy and there were many songs with the n word. I expect that while I'm at the club, but while I'm eating? Completely tasteless! 

The service was lacking but not the worst I've seen. At one point the waitress came over to check the amount of wine left in the bottle, then set it down and walked away even though two of our glasses were empty! The food came out very slowly, but that's typical of an all-you-can-eat place, where they want you to fill up in between courses and order less. 

The food itself was extremely disappointing. Most of the rolls had ingredients that are never in real sushi: cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and other odd things. They were presented attractively but were drenched in cream sauces and the ones that were fried were disgustingly greasy. The fish was fresh enough but not even close to the quality I'm used to. 

I guess if you've never had really high quality sushi you might enjoy this place (judging from other reviewers) but if you appreciate only the best sushi, you'll probably want to skip Oyshi. I definitely won't go back!",7XTQK7OX-d_Fiv05uhNydw,0,0,2,Mo4rB-cEU0xQvFo0RLo1tQ

I used to work nearby and this place would be my default dinner spot when I was too tired to really ""go out"" on the town. The food is fresh and the prices are reasonable. Service is excellent. 

I've never had anything there that I did not enjoy. The atmosphere is nice for a date. They also have a great all-you-can-eat for a set price which includes everything on the menu except for the sashimi. 

Maybe I'm sentimental, but now that I don't live in the area anymore, I sometimes find myself craving the sushi here. 

If you're looking for food off the strip, away from the traffic and the tourists, this place is definitely worth checking out. It's not too far from the Strip.",bAzdeuQiR80wVOLUh7ox7g,0,0,4,oQcugZi7fz3I6eoVkI1h4Q

Our server Steven (maybe spelled Stephen) was very nice and paid special attention to us and started up real conversations about UNLV and stuff.

There was only 2 of us and we had to re-order/ask about a couple of things we ordered (same as when we were there with the big group), but it wasn't a big deal because since there was only 2 of us, we got full way faster and were glad to use the digestion breaks between eating.

The creme brulee was divine as always. It's just SO SAD how they only give you 1 dessert when you order AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi. I want AYCE creme brulee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And still came home smelling like food. LOL.

64808,2013-11-06,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"We tried Oyshi on a recommendation from a Renoite transplant that lives in Vegas now, we were expecting decent ayce sushi, much like the ones you can get in Reno....not even close.  

Sushi-
The sushi is just, ok.  The fish wasn't super fresh, some of the cuts of fish were thin and cut poorly, falling apart.  Most of the rolls had the same notes of lots of imitation crab meat mixture, so they all tasted the same.  

Appetizers-
I'm a fanatic for raw oysters, they had small Pacific oysters that were a bit on the warm side and very bland tasting, flavorless even with the siracha sauce they dotted on it.  It tasted as though it was about to go bad and they rinsed it with tap water, even the shell the oyster was served in lacked oyster liquor, which isn't a good sign.  Needless to say, I was only able to eat 1 of 4 that I ordered and it was a struggle to keep it down.  I've eaten raw oysters from a jar and the raw oysters here came pretty close to that.  I told the wait staff that the oysters were a bit off and she replied, ""that's odd they're usually not like that"".  The manager was attentive and came to our table to see if we wanted more oysters, stating that there wasn't enough sauce on our previous order as to why they tasted that way. If the oysters are fresh, why would you need to drown it in ""sauce""?

The sweet shrimp with side of fried heads, amaebi, were not so sweet, which means they weren't so fresh.  The shrimp heads weren't prepared properly, (not fried well) and so it was tough to bite through it.

After having the oyster and amaebi, we passed on the uni, because if you can't get the other 2 right, there's no way we were going to try the uni as it needs to be super fresh.

They were pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so maybe I just have high expectations for sushi, or maybe we just got the Sushi chef in training, but if your like me and your jonesing for some great sushi, this place isn't for you.",97fNUK5L4RlMgIqh2RjIUQ,0,0,2,l1C7PpLoa2Tm9BmGez0t5g

Seaweed Salad - pretty standard, kind of small

Agedashi Tofu - good flavor, but wasn't the best that I've had.
MOCHI ICE CREAM - you only get to choose one dessert, definitely choose this!!
Sunrise Roll - nice spicy flavor

82739,2009-03-11,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.

The servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!

Now for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).

Strike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!

128521,2012-12-05,1,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"For a sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert, they've got some pretty damn fresh fish and a huge all-you-can-eat (AYCE) menu.

Though there are appetizers and salads, I always go for the nigiri and the rolls to fill that insatiable need for fish and rice. Some of the maki come in hand rolls, while others are baked, deep-fried, full of veggies, spicy, or wrapped in soy paper. You definitely should be able to find at least one item you'll enjoy or you're just flat out doing it wrong.

Once the chopsticks are down and I'm ready to do the Slump of Defeat, the dessert conveniently reminds you that you can get only one of the green tea tiramisu, mochi ice cream, or some of the other selections. Except the ice cream scoops. You can get as many scoops as your dessert stomach can handle!

Service was pretty good, but could be a bit erratic.  They always came to refill our drinks, to check up on us, or to take additional orders.

Service is usually very good. Last time I went, had to wait 20 mins for a table (it was a little busy) and the waiter did not come around as much as I had hoped for. Our water and teas were never refilled without asking. But the other times I have gone prior, service was fine.

When it comes to sushi at Oyshi, ah, I've had better. Their spicy tuna for me was too mushy. I like spicy tuna when the tuna is cut into chucks then mixed with the spicy mayo. So, I was quite disappointed with that. The salmon nigiri was fresh and quite tasty though. I try to stay away from the rolls because they are huge, will become quite full from one roll. 

Whenever I find myself at Oyshi, I tend to order a few nigiris then I ransack the appetizer menu! lol. I love the steak. It comes out sizziling on top cabbage and onions. They also have, shrimp/vegetable tempura, bacon wrapped asparagus, scallop poppers, oysters, agedashi tofu, etc.

My opinions on this restaurant has been consistent within these several years. I love this place. I eat here few times a month because I can't get enough of the food! Some reviewers may complain about the service, with a few exceptions, their service to us has been amazing. The thing I admire most about this restaurant is that the service isn't limited to just the servers, but the owner is running around serving people as well. I've been going here for so long, the owner recognizes us each time! 

Food: I am obsessed with their Ian's Special Roll. It has multiple layers of flavor goodness! 

Things to Try: Snow Mountain roll, Salmon Lover, Tiger Roll, Surf and Turf (appetizer), Ahi poke, Baked Mussels, Grilled Asparagus and Shrimp, and all the sushi fish you desire. Their Vanilla Parfait for dessert is pretty amazing too. 

I usually look forward to the Uni and the Oysters, but the reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because there have been times where it is not available. And it really puts a damper on my entire meal. Who doesn't want to get their money's worth!

She even knows the different rolls my husband likes which is crazy bc there are so many! We will be moving to the other side of town soon and the worst part about it is we will be far away from this location. My husband said we will drive way over here just to see Od!!! We love you Od!!

I would give them 5, 6, 10 stars a couple years ago but the last time I was there I felt the quality of their food went down! The rolls didn't look fresh, the size of the salmon cuts or anything really are half now! I got very disappointed when I left the place, It use to be my favorite must go place in Vegas.

The second time we went we were put in the far corner, probably as far away from the sushi bar as you can get. The quality was still there but the service was terrible. We felt forgotten being so far away and it took a long time to get our first order. When doing AYCE we usually do a first round then inevitably get a second round. With the amount of time it took for the first, we didn't even want to wait for a second round. We left full from the tasty sushi, but disappointed with the service. 

This last time we went was for the AYCE lunch. We sat close to the sushi bar, but it didn't matter. We ordered Miso and Edamame to start. The miso was brought very quickly, but we waited easily 30 minutes for our edamame. The waitress came back during our waiting to take our order for sushi. We placed our order and also asked about or edamame. She clearly forgot judging by her reaction.

The sushi came before our edamame and the quality was poor. The albacore was mangled on the rice and didn't taste fresh. Same with the Salmon. 

The worst part about the last experience is that during our time waiting for edamame and sushi, we saw our waitress through the curtain in the kitchen eating food. Restaurant no-no 101. 

I don't plan on returning. It's disappointing because I like the atmosphere, their selection on their menu (AYCE even includes oysters on the half-shell and Uni!)

The sushi fad has been rising in Vegas and Oyshi has taken it even further. When I go into a sushi restaurant I look at 3 things:

1. How the restaurant looks.
2. Selection of sushi
3. How the restaurant makes me feel.

Right off the bat, you're welcomed with high end decor that depicts Japanese culture. Oyshi is nothing short of class. I'm a very limited sushi order. Ironically, I'm allergic to fish (I know, right?). However, I am able to eat shell fish, and that is good enough for me to fall in love with this new craze. They have fresh selections and a whole section of shell fish sushi. 

And what I love the most about Oyshi sushi, is that it's not some hole in the wall, dirty little restaurant. It's classy, sophisticated, and it's a spot you can bring your valued company. I actually refuse to bring dates here because I don't want them to tarnish this place for me. Highly recommended. They'll remember your name because they remember mine.

Their one manager who has been working the last couple times I've gone is amazing. He's very attentive and talks to the tables and makes sure everyone has what they need. If he is not there.. it's not the same. The service is below average. If they are the slightest bit busy.. you have to wait sometimes 20 minutes before the server will even remember she has you at her table to put another order in. This can sometimes be good because if it's AYCE, you're completely hungry after waiting 20 mins between each roll... we also paid with cash once.. 12 over.. and never got our change. and the service was terrible that time. so really? you're just gonna assume the rest is your tip? mmm no. and then she never returned to the table even though we sat there and waited for quite awhile. oh well.. the food itself though is usually amazing. I've never really ordered anything that I didn't like. Except the mochi for dessert. everywhere else I go they cut it into quarters for you and sometimes even decorate it with chocolate sauce (sushi wa on eastern.. recommend there waaay over this place) .. but not this place.. you just gotta bite right into it and man does that hurt my sensitive teeth. But again, the food is good, and if you go on a less busy night the food comes out somewhat fast. 

Also, it can get pretty cramped. Last time I was there they sat a larger table next to us and put a chair on the end. I literally could have rested my head on the guys shoulder who say there. Really? I understand about wanting to accommodate every guest that comes in.. but what about the comfort ability of the other guests already there? mmmm not my favorite place yet I keep returning so it'll get 3 stars.",AZ8_bPqh1kMMdFO6hR09YQ,0,0,3,5gd8HjGpdAErdIFUFZbdzA

436623,2010-03-21,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"I decided that I wanted AYCE sushi last night (Saturday) so I headed over to Oyshi.  I checked in with the host at about 8:30pm and was informed that it would be about 20 minutes for a table.  It was a nice night, so I just grabbed a chair on the sidewalk in front and waited for the other half of my party to arrive.  There were probably four or five other small groups of people milling about waiting for tables too.

We were seated at the bar just after 9:00pm.  The place seemed pretty busy...  some uncleared tables, a couple large parties (one with kids) occupied the ""VIP"" rooms behind us.  It was on the noisy side, especially with the techno/house/electronica music pumping from the ceiling speakers above the four chef's stations.

After a few minutes we were greeted by a friendly server who confirmed our AYCE preference, took our drinks and asked if we were ready to put in our first round of orders.  We were.  I started with miso soup, an assortment of nigiri style items, an ""ahi poke"" and an order of four oysters (limit 1).  Note:  I thought it was interesting that even though we were seated at the bar, our sushi requests were made with the server.  I guess the server was attempting to queue the orders for the very busy chefs.

The nigiri items on first order arrived quickly and we were told be the chef in front of us that the oysters would be out in a ""little while"".  The nigiri items were nicely presented and of good quality.  The ahi poke was just a small clump of chopped tuna on top of a mix of seaweed salad and sprinkled with sesame seed (not exactly what I think of when I think poke, but I'm not trying to get techincal up in here son).

The oysters came out a few minutes later.  They were covered in green onion, a bit of masago and a squirt of sriracha.  I can only assume that the toppings were meant to cover up the tasteless, been sitting in a fresh-water tank, half-dollar sized oysters.  Engh, I figured I'd keep moving forward, after all this was AYCE...

Round two:  More nigiri (including surf clam, tamago, masago, quail egg, tako, and scallop), something called ""oyshi scallop"", and a spider roll.  We also ordered the chicken, beef and shrimp yakitori, which were all paired with asparagus and came sitting in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  Again the nigiri items were of nice quality.  I'm not sure we ever got the ""oyshi scallop"".  There were two items in the order that looked like a krab salad (the california roll stuff) that I was sure we didn't order.  The spider roll was basically a California roll with one meager soft-shell crab in it, and it had been covered in the same bbq sauce they put on the eel.

Since I was disappointed with the Spider roll and I love soft-shell crab, I put in an order for a Monster roll, which was also supposed to have soft-shell crab in it.  What came out was something similar to the Spider (covered in the same eel sauce) only with the addition of a few slivers of eel and a refrigerator cold tempura shrimp stuffed into it.  Slow down on that eel sauce dawg.

At this point, I was pretty full and done trying...  The sushi chef in front of us was closing down his station, giving it a quick wash down with a wet rag and mumbling something about this night being his ""early out"".  By this time the dining room was starting to clear out too, but the party with the kids were still in our audible vicinity.

I finished up my second pot of hot tea (which was a nice quality loose leaf green) and enjoyed a green tea ice cream mochi ball.  Both of these items were good.

After tipping out the chefs, server and taking care of the bill, I had spent about $75 for the two of us.  I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon, but I made the best of it while I was there.",cs4Pq7zpmyWqMVjyq14sBQ,1,1,2,0oJZKISgQPDLrVsScT3PRg

The table across from us who came in about 10 min received a ton of food both sushi and cooked food from the kitchen promptly after ordering while we received nothing. Our waiter kept on telling us our food was coming over and over again but NOTHING EVER CAME!! Sad really! Never coming back to this location again and DO NOT recommend this place at all!!

Beware!  This by far was the worst experience I've had dining at a Japanese restaurant. Yes, this place seems popular but is it clean? Hell to the No!  I can only imagine what they are doing when they are behind the kitchen cooking up a storm.  

My fam bam was doing the famous all you can eat. Everything was going smoothly until my cousin noticed this cockroach roaming in the seats. We addressed this to the server who apologized and moved us to a different table. Obviously we lost our appetite. I asked to speak to a manager and as I was looking back the staff was heckling and laughing. They were fully aware of the cockroach issue and perhaps they thought it was funny that we actually saw one. I spoke to the manager and he was not helpful. He was like I'll comp the drinks and the kids meal. Helloooo. There was three all you can eat. He also spoke to me like he also knew about the cockroach problem and explained that summer season that can happen.   As a food venue, that is unacceptable. Do you know what type of diseases or sicknesses that can bring to a human. What if it landed in my soup and I  swallowed a cockroach? Would they blame that on the summer months? As we all know there are tons of food venues around Las Vegas and most are really clean. I would think the health district would not even let a venue like that pass with an A rating if it was infested with cockroaches. For all those who want to experience the future Oyshi dining.. make sure you bring an insect repellant spray so that way you are sure not to get that on your food. Beware of cockroaches!  They can creep up on your soup or maybe even become an appetizer if you aren't paying attention. Cockroach roll with the eel sauce, anyone?

""AYCE"" sold me. i went online to check the reviews on yelp. i was excited and drove down to the restaurant. 

the ambiance was hip and played house music. i sat at the sushi bar and it was a huge table. everyone was 'nice' when i got there.  i am a petite girl.. 105lbs less.. and i love to eat! i had a minimum of 2hrs to eat. they warned me that if i had leftover rice or sushi, i will be charged.  i was game.  i got there at 8:30pm. ordered my miso soup that they had forgotten 20mintues later.  i must admit the sushi and rolls were delicious. i think once they got the hint that i kept ordering and ordering.. no sushi chefs didn't want to serve me and it was only 1/2 hr into dinner. everytime i wanted to order something, they walked away and pretended not to hear me. i assume they want to stretch the 2hr minimum by not serving me. then i felt like i was begging for food. at this moment, i remain a big smile on face and it turned into a nightmare. everyone was sooooo mean!  they wanted me to leave! whatever i ordered in the kitchen.. the items were for smurfs! asparagus wrapped with beef were the size of chopsticks!  it was 9:30 and the 10th server gave me the check! i was not done eating and haven't gotten to my dessert. i am a polite customer, fun, and spoke to the chefs the entire time. i ask the server if my 2hrs were up and he said the manager gave him the check! WTF??? i ordered my dessert paid my check, gave them a 20% tip for the food and promise i will never come back even if it was for free. 

i was hoping this was going to be a great experience because once i tasted the food, i fell in love with the freshness. nonetheless, i am loyal customer anywhere i step foot in and it would have been sooo convenient. no matter how great the food, if you don't have customer satisfaction, you will never have them coming back!",CnhCriLjUdMIkZJ_eAe49A,0,0,1,xObBjJ82ZW24WdVx3kXpjg

And she said that we are a big group blah blah blah. My dad was really upset and confronted the manager and the manager ""Kevin"" said if you continue to complain then the more you are going to wait. That made me really furious because nobody should disrespect anyone no matter what. So I told him to cancel it and the manager said ""Good!"" 

I don't know if this manager had restaurant etiquette but even if people had high praise about your food but the service sucks it doesn't make you of a good place! I'm not sure if he owns the place but if there is a bigger boss he should not be working in a restaurant since he doesn't respect the customers and honestly we felt discriminated. 

I've never felt so bad like this because it involved my family and it was suppose to be a nice dinner to wrap up our vacation in Vegas.

I am pretty sure the owner doesn't care as well because if he does he would take ownership and control of his restaurant sence this issue is been the same for majority the time this restaurant is been opened. Very disappointed long time waiting for appetizers and extremely slow service and lack of knowledge and skills from staff members as a whole restaurant aspect.,gO1DieazB3BPUL9-op2TPQ,0,0,1,W3Fo6ZgZEyAGXHDQRgRdLg

The uni was fresh and buttery and I liked the fried head of the sweet shrimp with ponzu. The tuna poke app was delicious and refreshing. Dinner was $26/person and we were lucky to get put in one of the private rooms. Also, the service was EXCELLENT! They were fast and kept our table clean and well maintained.

But the thing that made this place stand out in my opinion was.....their Green Tea Tiramisu. It was HANDS DOWN the best dessert that I have ever had in my life. I will drive 4 hours from LA to Las Vegas just for that!",0U5Pee9lERok8Iwsu-yoDQ,1,1,5,keNrxdfq67LPQTXNvNLHcA

We were seated in the private room that has a big flat screen tv with sofa seating. I suggest reserving this room for a special occasion or if you have a large party. 

We all had the all-you-can-eat sushi and for $26 it's a steal! There are a few catches though..only a 4 oyster limit per person and you have to eat the rice that comes with your sushi or they threaten to charge you for it . 

I think we ordered everything on the menu but a few dishes that stood out were: rib eye steak teriyaki (not over cooked at all), calamari (I didn't get a chance to try this but other people at our table kept ordering more of this) J&B roll (soooo good with the baked scallops on top). I thought the baked rolls were a lot larger than the other sushi rolls so be careful not to order too much (like we did). 

Our waiter was pretty attentive and even offered to take our picture for us. The owner was really nice.

if you're less critical and like a variety of sushi and rolls then this just might be your spot. this little gem is definitely located off the beaten path and was suggested to me by one of my best friends who used to live in vegas. like most restaurants in vegas the most accessible/convenient places are pretty much buffets so i was a bit hesitant when i heard this is ayce (all you can eat). okay i'm not gonna lie...my first response was a NO to the idea of ayce, but fortunately my group and i caved when our pick was closed for some reason.

i've been here three times now and they've all been enjoyable experiences. the staff there were not only friendly (a must), but ATTENTIVE. our waitress checked on us frequently, but not to the point of annoyance. lastly, oyshi is not just a good place for sushi, but you also don't feel gouged when you're done...

helpful suggestions:

-this restaurant is off the 215 freeway so plan your transportation wisely;  cabbing it over there might be a bit expensive.

-make reservations if you can as they can be extremely busy, but if you can't then go early. my group showed up around 6'ish and was seated immediately _barely_ missing the dinner rush.

-the menu selections are pretty big so try not to make multiple orders of the same item so you can try different things. this is also important because not all their items are fresh, like uni or oysters.",P6IIb5AOhhyLwUF6dpK2EA,0,0,4,bCrixh1QhsitgnaSMo2Rgg

The next and last time I went I got to go food again. It was the same guy and he took my order and the total was $43.50. I have him $45.

I was almost tempted to try this theory again and pay for something with a $100 and see what the result would be. Does he only keep a certain amount of money, would something over $20, $40 $50 be pushing his luck....

We sit down, order our drinks and our first order..all was fine till then.  After we order, a good 10 minutes pass by while I observed the chefs, servers, and tables.  
There were about 4 other tables and 3 of them were finished.  The one table next to us seemed to be about midway into their meal which seemed like hours between dishes.  They get one dish, finish it, then wait for another 5 minutes for the server to bring their next order. They looked irritated. And so about 20 minutes of watching 4 or 5 chefs looking busy, we get our first order.  After we finish through our first order we order maybe 4 more orders of nigiri. (Which shouldn't take more than 3 minutes) And by then all tables were gone and about 5 people at the bar. So I expected it to come quick. Nope...20 minutes later we get our last order and by then I was fed up with everything. 
There were about 6 servers(why??) and they seemed more excited about talking to each other than even looking to see if the customers were okay.  
Nigiri was like 80% rice 20% fish which you can expect from a Korean run sushi restaurant.  And of course they charge you if you leave rice.  How else would they make money? Not by quality, that's for sure.  
Overall, the worst experience at an AYCE sushi restaurant.

We used that place as a crutch and were afraid to try a new place (for fear it would not live up to the old place standards). 

I had passed Oyshi many times running errands and after driving back to the Southwest area of town, broken hearted about the closure of our ""comfort zone"" sushi venue, we decided to go to Oyshi and give it a try. 

I am happy to report that we were very satisfied and have been back MANY times. 

Recommendations 
1. Do the AYCE. We've calculated MANY times what our meal would have cost with out AYCE and we always come up winners. 
2. Don't go on Friday or Saturday nights if you are starving and just can't wait. It's busy, and that should say quite a bit about the quality. I don't mind the crowd or the wait, but sometimes my stomach wishes we had gotten there a little earlier. 

Likes 
1. House music in the background 
2. TVs behind the sushi bar for the sports fans. 
3. Ample bar seating - we ALWAYS sit at the bar
4. Extensive menu
5. Chef willing to let you make up your own rolls :)

We try to hit up Oyshi once a month or more if the Sushi cravings are just to hard to resist. I highly recommend. Yum (salivating as I write this)",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,4,3,4,7_z2igwyh0QuKOwkpGFYBw

If you've ever been eating sushi and thought to yourself, this would be so much better with some Tiesto playing, this is your spot!

First off, don't be discouraged by the wait. They're busy and you should be happy for them. It's usually no more than 15 minutes and you can occupy yourself by practicing new dance moves. We always sit at the sushi bar and the service is friendly and fast. I once saw no less than 6 sushi chefs hustling in that narrow space so you'll be well taken care of. 

On to the tasty stuff. What I like most about this joint is if you like deep fried, baked, raw, hot, mild, funky they've got you covered. I hate places that are all cooked or all raw, you've gotta people please!  From the freshness of the fish, to the sauces they're paired with it's all a win. Their all you can eat knows almost no bounds so if you're not busting at the end you've done something wrong. To top it all off the strawberry ice cream they serve is surprisingly top notch, little strawberry swirl through it and everything. 

They also have 2 private rooms for large parties and I know this because I spied on them when I was there like a creeper. Try this place out next time you're in the southwest.

Service at Oyshi in the past sucked, but tonight's service was just plain unacceptable. 
Being a server myself, I strive to be polite, easy, PATIENT, understanding, and tip well. When my son and I walked in, we waited a good 5 mins as the manager and servers walked passed us and no one even cared to seat us. I finally flagged down a server to seat us. If the establishment was busy, that's a different story, but this was at 10pm on a Thursday with only three other tables.
The girl that sat us gave us menus and asked if we were doing AYCE and I responded, ""No""(I didn't want to stuff myself this late at night). I ordered water and told her I was ready to order, but she said she's not my server. 5 mins passed and our server came to take our drink order, and I told her I was ready to order. I ordered two waters, a miso soup, and 2 simple rolls. The waters and soup came in a timely manner, but I had to flag down a server for a spoon, straws, settings, and soy sauce. 
We waited, waited, and waited(@ least 30 mins), saw other customers get their food-while thinking...did they forget our rolls???

She glared at me then went over to tell the sushi chef, and he miraculously & immediately passed her a plate with our rolls! What the heck?? While we were waiting forever for our rolls, the sushi chef had them.
We never even got an apology for the delay. Not once were we asked if we were ok or needed anything or even got a refill.

Our first round took FOREVER AND A DAY and our server forgot a couple things I had ordered so I ordered once again. I swear saw her scribbling on her notepad while I was telling her what I would like to eat next.  It is quite possible that she was just jotting things down for the grocery store after her shift. We decided to order dessert from the waitress at the next table so that we could have it right after the rest of the sushi came. So, dessert came and we decided to let the creme brûlée sit there on our table until the rest of our sushi came. To our surprise the sushi and our waitress was nowhere to be found!!! A long while later I asked another waitress if she could check on our other sushi orders and she informed is that there were none and she could take our order if we wanted more.

Since it's opening, my wife and I have patronized Oyshi on S. Rainbow.  For most of this time, the service levels have been at a minimum adequate and mostly 4-5 star.

No longer.  Last night, one of our boys asked to go to Oyshi as he has basically been going since his birth.  Over the past few visits, we noticed a decline in customer service, less knowledgeable staff, and simply less training.  The service culture gives one the sense of barely organized chaos.  The staff is no longer efficient and organized.  It almost felt that we should feel lucky that they were there to bring our food.

Service is now merely ""dump and run"" with no real follow-up.  Dirty dishes left on table and servers were handing us new plates of food instead of removing the old to make space for the new.

The manager on duty was obviously in over his head.  We were always accustomed to the manager coming over, checking on our food as he did with everyone, and visibly managing and directing the staff.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.

As the owners branch out into new concepts (our understanding is they also own Soyu - Korean Barstaurant in the same strip center as well as some other concepts), the better managers (and possibly staff) are going as well.  Problem is, they are not leaving competent (or at least not well-trained) folks behind.

Sad to see.  Oyshi had a great run for a few years.  However unless they get their act together this particular location is headed down a steep slope with no brakes.",h_jfFjDyekNLCikooc7Mtg,0,0,2,R_-OZ48IJ2v_CcYhTtGDAQ

Annnd there Calamari and Popcorn Scallops are so yummy!

Cons: NO HALF-ROLLS available except if you eat at the sushi bar. Getting your sushi orders takes a long time!

4 of us for dinner last night.  2 had AYCE, 2 didn't .  Server had attitude from the beginning - my sense is a combination of being annoyed by the questions, that we all didn't get AYCE and I was the only one drinking .

We were told the problem was the kitchen was backed up .... Really ?  More like the kitchen was fucked up and the server was backed up and someone needed to stick their foot up her ass to cleanse her of the crappy attitude.

The food ?  Gotta admit the sushi was good - sweet shrimp, garlic tuna and Cajun tuna as well as the yellowtail were the stars.  Unagi also worked for me.

The hot dishes ?  The ones we actually got ? Calamari, popcorn scallops, asparagus beef ... Very average.  There were at least 5 dishes they never brought us.

This was a very rare occasion I didn't tip much - $95 bill, $2 tip.

Of all the AYCE places I've been to, Oyshi is definitely the best. Their variety of rolls, sushi, and appetizers is the largest. The fish is fresh and the appetizers are quite creative. I highly recommend the Red Rock Roll and Screaming Roll. For appetizers, the Ahi Poke and Agedashi Tofu is always very good. A welcomed difference from many other AYCE sushi places is that Oyshi is a very nice restaurant. It was built to be a sushi restaurant and has the ambiance of one. 

Ever since I found Oyshi a few years ago, I have not gone anywhere else in town for AYCE sushi. However, it has really caught on and their business seems to be booming, especially during the peak hours. Because of that, the last couple of time I've gone there, the service has been very, very slow. I actually tried a new place recently, because I didn't want to be there for 2+hours.

I rave about this place to basically everyone I know. Lol. It gets really busy during the normal dinner hours...which we typically try to avoid because it takes longer for each order to come out.

The downfall is that wait times can be extensive at times depending on when you go, but average wait is 10-20 minutes... and it's oh-so worth the wait! Lunch is 22$, dinner is $27.

We like to order:
APPETIZERS:
- Ahi poke
- Calamari 
- Fresh oysters (two pieces per order, one order per person only)
- Dynamite (scallop, shrimp, crab mix, mushroom & onion baked w/ yum yum sauce)
- Baked mussels (5 piece limit per person) 
- Asian skirt steak
- Yakitori shrimp & asparagus 
- Rib eye steak 
SUSHI ROLLS
- Love affair
- Vegas roll 
- Premium spider
- Japanese Garlic Lasagna 
- Lobster Affair 
- Oyshi roll 
- Salmon nigiri
- Unagi nigiri 
DESSERT:
- Green tea berry parfait
- Vanilla creme brulee 
- Green tea ice cream (desserts are one order per customer except for ice cream)

PRO TIP: If you have peanut allergies, you'll be happy to know they do not use ANYTHING with peanuts, none of their dressings contain it and they do not use peanut oil.

I usually sit at the sushi bar to interact w/ the chef's and it's quicker to get your food. I've been here numerous times, but my review stems from the last few times I have come to visit. Most recently my gf & I came in for dinner and the host was not at her station so we proceeded to head to the sushi bar where I typically sit. We sat down and the hostess came to us and asked if someone sat us. We said no due to no one being at the host stand. She said I need to seat you. I informed her, we are already seated and we would like to sit here. She told us the server who worked in that area wasn't accepting tables. We asked if the server working the whole bar? She went back to the stand to look and I followed. She went to go speak w/ another employee to ask if it was okay. I'm guessing the hostess was new since she didn't know what to do. When she came back, she took us back exactly to where we originally went to sit. Pretty frustrating to say the least. So now we are under the impression we have a server. Not really though. A woman came to our seats and provided us w/ a setup and took a drink order. After that, nothing. About 8 minutes went by and the server, our server, comes up and asks us what we wanted to eat. No apology, just took our order. Once we ordered our food, everything was business as usual.

I've had spotty service here since coming here. I come for the food and that's why I sit at the sushi bar because it cuts out the time the server has to take to grab the food and deliver it. The chef just hands it to you. The best option here is the AYCE because just about everything is up for grabs. Oh and if you don't know, which most don't since it's not on the menu, you can order pork belly. It comes in a serving of 4. Even regulars that come in don't know.

This was the first AYCE sushi place I've been to here in the valley and it's not in my top 3 places. To sum it up, Oyshi is so hit or miss that it's almost a risk to come here. Yes, you'll come here see that there's a long wait and expect it to be great but the last few times I've been here and given chance after chance, I've left disappointed. 

First of all, I used to work in a restaurant. Server's know when it's busy, trust me, and as a customer I expect you to acknowledge that. The times that I've waited for a decent amount of time, I've never been apologized to about the wait or been given an explanation when the rolls I've ordered don't come out when it seems like people who just sat down are getting there's before me. 

I'm not that selfish, but I just feel like the service here is poorly conducted. I've felt that it takes a group of us to look around constantly before someone comes and asks if we need anything. The rolls are always very good, but the amount of time that it takes most times I'm there is not average to the sushi places I've been to. 

I will admit I do love their Salmon Nigiri and the Love Affair roll but a lot of the other rolls often feel like there is just too much going on. I don't like to complain, but the service isn't up to my standards and my standards aren't extremely high. I just expect my water to be refilled within a decent time and asked if I'd like to order more without having to ask to order more. 

I am very forgiving and I will come here, I just don't have the expectations that I once did. The sushi is usually very fresh and the options aside from the sushi are great. I always order the calamari and the surf-n-turf appetizers when I come here. I would recommend this place to a friend, I think I would just advise them to be go-getters with their servers and make it known when they want something.

We ordered many items & not one was left behind.  

Sizzling Ribeye plate over cabbage, side of rice, miso soup & the salad had a tasty ginger dressing & was larger than a usual side dish.  Cooked perfectly & well seasoned  ribeye, sliced.  They offer Teriyaki Chicken, Surf & Turf, Asian Skirt Steak & Sweet & Spicy Pork also.

Salmon Lover Roll, Game's recommendation was fabulous!  Lite lemony mustard cream drizzle over tempura salmon, avocado, cream cheese rolled in rice & topped w/ fresh salmon!  Delish & I will start w/ it again!

I'm not a Spicy Tuna Roll fan, but we also ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch which was fantastic.  Jalapeño, cream cheese deep fried & topped w/ spicy mayo & eel sauce so you can't go wrong.  Many rolls have cream cheese btw.  I usually look for the ones that are more fresh so next time will sit at the sushi bar & experiment.  I did love our servers recommendations tho!

I really like their sushi bar it's really big. The tables in the restaurants are nicely spaced so you're not rubbing elbows with your neighbors. I'm not used to Japanese Restaurants that can accommodate several large parties. They had two private rooms and we were in another area that was semi-private. There were 9 of us and we sat comfortably. I really like the painting they had against the wall in our semi private area. It was actually the only painting I saw throughout the restaurant. 

I have never eaten at an AYCE sushi in Las Vegas away from the strip so I was super excited. I ordered their Agedashi tofu and it was so Salty! Stay away, ha ha. I was disappointed but quickly got over it when I tasted their poke salad. I remember ordering the Kimono Roll, Yellow Trio and dessert. I had more than that, but I was so amazed how refreshing everything tasted I was too excited to remember to write it down. When I ordered I stayed away from tempura or anything baked. I was not going to get full off that, I wanted fish. Their sushi was fresh and I especially remember the salmon handroll, it was perfect. I really enjoyed their food, although the oyster was okay and their uni really looked like it needed a makeover. 

Their Service was super duper good, although for some reason I was the last one to receive my order. That made me the last one to eat the desserts everyone was done while I was still waiting. Ha ha. Do not pass up on ordering their Mochi Ice Cream. Doesn't matter if you're full and your fly is about to pop, still order their dessert.

So overall, next time I will definitely come here for their AYCE! Their selection of rolls for their AYCE is plenty, not like other places its mainly filled with baked and tempura stuff. This one had plenty of raw fish in their rolls. Just the way I like it!

Pros:
1. decent selection of rolls, sashimi, appetizers for the buffet option
2. friendly service

Cons:
1. No sweet shrimp or uni (sea urchin) for lunch buffet (dinner only)
2. Dynamite roll had wayyyy too much mayo which was gross
3. No all you can eat dessert!? Wanted some more of that strawberry mochi!

Recommendations: I'd choose the skirt steak over the other steaks. Yellow halibut is awesome (don't get the baby halibut as it is bland). Any of their rolls is decent but nothing really stood out to me in particular.

I work in the restaurant industry and get it that on slower nights you might close early.

I'm not a big fan of rolls and this place does it for me. They also have additional appetizers that you won't find at typical sushi restaurants. I really like their seaweed salad, which is quite the generous portion. Seaweed salad is expensive and this place does not skimp out. The albacore is especially good at this restaurant. They have these sizzling plates which comes out on fajita wooden plates. I have tried the surf and turf which is really delicious. I would recommend getting one to share with a few friends. The appetizer portions are small, but they do fill you up. Try sharing the appetizers so you can save room for the real stuff. With this said, the best part truly is the dessert. This place by far has the best tasting Creme Brulee I have ever had. The only bad thing is that dessert is not all you can eat, it's only one per person. Make sure you leave room for dessert because you do not want to miss out. I have been here twice and will definitely come back the next time I'm in town.

I started with the simple seaweed salad and edamame, both which were well seasoned and served at the perfect temperature.
Typically I am a fancy, combo roll fan but I will have to say that the quality of fish made the simple rolls one of my favorites of the night. The spicy yellowtail roll was very good as was the salmon avocado.
To finish off, the all-you-can-eat menu there is a choice of dessert. I'm always a fan of the green tea ice cream and in this instant the ice cream was superb.

We were greeted warmly by the hostess and our server. When we said we didn't want AYCE we were given an additional menu. So we had a large menu with the rolls and AYCE info and another with ""dinner"" options. They have lots of rolls with the ""dynamite"" mix which seems to be Krab mixed with other seafood and mayo.

The sushi is a B-. Certainly the quality isn't up to our other favs like Sen and Soho but not bad. They have a lot of rolls and cooked menu options. I had the ""steak"" on rice. In parens because it seemed more like chopped beef. It didn't resemble a quality steak but for $12 who could expect otherwise. The sauce was high in sugar and salt.

 - The restaurant offers a huge menu of both sushi and hot kitchen items (e.g., sushi, koma, Hamachi, sizzling hot plates of steak and seafood, tempura, oysters, soups/salads, and desserts). 

-  There is usually a wait to be seated. The wait is sometimes as long as an hour during peek dinner times. You can drop in to be put on the list, and they will text you when they are ready to seat you. They take reservations. 

- They offer an all you can eat sushi menu for about $25 that includes one desert (e.g., green tea ice cream, creme brûlée, Moche ice cream).

- My favorites are the yellowtail koma, double salmon roll, surf and turf sizzling hot plate, spicy tuna hand roll, fresh sashimi red snapper and halibut, Red Rock sushi roll, and the vanilla creme brûlée with green tea ice-cream. 

I've been to this location over a dozen times in just the last four months - my most frequent visit being last week for lunch. I generally ask for my favorite sushi chef and server, and I am willing to wait for them. Vincent is the best server!  This restaurant generally wants the server to tell the sushi chef your order even as you sit at the bar. At first I wasn't fond of this process, but it works well and there isn't a lag in service. The sushi chef still hands you your order -it just prevents you from yelling out at a busy chef. Vincent offers exceptional service that includes getting your beverages, kitchen items, and sushi bar order. He is exceptional. 

The sushi chefs are all awesome, but my favorite is Ivan. When the restaurant isn't too busy, he will inquiry if you want anything. If you request, he will also make creations for you based on what he notices you like. He is efficient, creative, and humorous.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,1,3,5,ByXfELfP_tIdVXAjrHVC7g

Although the food is great, service is baddd.

(They close at 2am) We were told they were closing early because they were slow and they took last call at 12:45am. I questioned the guy and mentioned that their hours say 2am. My friends drove 45 minutes specifically to go to Oyshi! He said they decided to close early and we couldn't eat. I even mentioned that we knew exactly what we wanted, since their ""last call"" was 5 minutes earlier. He was not very friendly! 

During the time we were standing outside deciding where to go, more people came and got very upset. That's at least 9 people they turned away! If your hours are until 2am, you should be open until 2am. From what I saw, they lost enough business to make it worth being open until the normal time. Next time we are going to eat, Oyshi will not even be an option unless it's early in the evening. When businesses aren't reliable, you're not gonna go out of your way to visit! Or tell others to visit at all! My review went from 5 stars down to 2. This isn't the first issue I've had at this location! Customer service is everything. 

As far as the food...

My friend told me about this place and their All You Can Eat sushi but I wasn't too sure about going because I only like one kind of roll. When we decided to go, I asked her if they had a regular menu because I wouldn't be able to eat that much sushi to justify All You Can Eat. When we arrived I was shocked that their all you can eat menu included appetizers, sushi, and dessert! This was perfect!

My friend and I both ordered the Love Affair roll which is shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. (no eel sauce for me) It was delicious!!! We also ordered....

Gyoza- nothing special but yummy!

Surf & Turf Platter- all the platters are small, so you can easily order two. The steak is pretty good and the shrimp was amazing. (I am very picky when it comes to shrimp)

Ebi- the best I've ever had. 

Teriyaki chicken- yummy

I absolutely love this place! I love variety without spending a fortune AND they are open late. (Well they are when they DECIDE to stay open)

1547649,2011-05-12,5,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"On our search for another epic place for sushi happens to fall onto this place as it drew us in for AYCE. I think a few of our friends had heard or were recommended to try this joint since they knew our group and how we can grub. The last place we went to before left a bad taste in my mouth and another a little ill from the meal, we were happy to try a completely different place. 

The atmosphere, ambience, are very inviting yet dark for those intimate encounters due to the dark wood finish everywhere. TVs around for those ackward silent moments if you're on a date or deep conversation in a larger group. I do like the mural on the back wall which was really impressive.

Now, down to the food, you can order anything on the menu but just watch for any restrictions such as only 1 order of uni for example. I do like the sound of appetizers you can order such as rib-eye steak which is really less than tapas on a sizzling plate and a bed of cabbage and onions. Another beef plate was the same which tasted good but I feel like I would have to order 5 of these to really make a good size order to be called an appetizer. 

The rolls are inventive and decorative which is a refreshing change from the other sushi places. My recommendation is to stick to the ""designer"" rolls rather than the sushi. I must strongly advise against ordering the uni which it could be me and an off night. I always try to be brave and order it knowing it could be really good or it could be really really bad. In fact, I didn't eat the second piece because the first one I ate tasted like iodine for some reason. Definitely may explain for my stomach pains on the way back to our place. Nausea may be another descriptive word for this feeling as well. The rolls taste great and presentation looks great but I may have to say no to sushi so far away from the coastline especially in the middle of the dessert. If you have reviewed or about to review this place and give it 5 stars, you may have to check yourself as your taste buds are a bit off for what great sushi really should be in quality.",574x3ezQTKDSsq37bi3HPw,4,7,3,_Q68j7C3QIjT69pE5mK-QQ

After one minute of walking the wrong way..we finally got into the entrance..by Following THE ARROWS...

Decor was really nice, bigger than the usual sushi bars. Great Location too. The VIP room and Lounge room was a nice touch. It was slow mind you, during lunch when I walked in with my ""friend"" Karlee. We started off with, my favorite Ahi Poke and Miso Soup. Karlee had the soup as well and Gyoza. Ahi Poke was ok, but not better than sushi mon, the flavor wasn't just there. Miso was good, not fantastic. Karlee loved the Gyoza, she said it was better than the other Sushi place she goes that serves it. 

I had the J&b roll, baked, with salmon and cream cheese. It was good, juicy, hand a hint of soy sauce. hats off to the sushi chef because it was awesome. I had a cucumber roll, asian strip steak and this deep fried california roll, with hot mustard and albacore tuna. All was great but the J&b roll was the highlight. karlee had 2 orders of the shrimp tempura roll, apparently it was good, I couldn't have any because I am allergic to shrimp. She tried to Force Feed it to me, knowing I was allergic, I think she tried to kill me, because I tried to make fun of her Sirarcha/Hot mayo sauce that she custom made..oh and She had chicken teriyaki and I think another order of Gyoza, apparently she loves that stuff.

 The service was a little slow, especially when they weren't busy. This was all you can eat, and what I was shocked about how they did not serve Half rolls!! I was like WTF? how could I possibly try more than 3 types. Other than that The waitress seemed puzzled and brought us the wrong dishes a couple of times. No big deal.

At the moment, there were no many parties of customers, that means it wasn't busy at all. At the sushi bar, there were about four sushi chefs, and there were about at least 3 servers. Yet, our orders were delayed unnecessarily, and didn't receive any customer service. They didn't come to check if foods are ok. We got foods long after we ordered, and some of foods we ordered wasn't even put in and made. But we rather got foods we didn't order, or ones we canceled. I told a server that that's what we canceled, and the foods  we ordered earlier didn't came out. We were not ok with all of them at all today. A chef just came out and asked if we are chinese or korean. And asked if we canceled orders of spicy tuna and some other order. I said we did, and he answered us to enjoy our meal, but his attitude and tone of voice seemed like he had something to complain. The head chef, looked at us and laughed at us while he's passing by our table. Obviously it wasn't smile he may normally treat to customers. We felt so uncomfortable that we asked if we can talk to manager about many things since we had not only bad customer service ,but also foods were so bad. A server said that manager is not here. We paid for our check, and left. But we were definitely not ok with all of them, so we got in the restaurant again and if we can get manager's contact. The chef, who came to our table and told if we canceled food, seemed worried with us, so asked if there were anything went wrong. We told him about things we wanted to complain. He looked like he's pretending to listen to us. Looking uncomfortable with what we said, he asked what he can compensate with(but obviously his attitude was to get out of the situation). He took out his wallet and said ""I will refund for the price you paid."" No one of us wanted to get refund, but his unnecessary action wasn't appropriate with the situation. He could have apologized about his and employees' faults sincerely, but he just tried to solve situation with his money. If he really wanted to compensate for bad service and was going to give us money back, he should have asked cashier to give us money back instead of taking out his wallet. There were even more things to say about foods, but I will reserve my opinion about food since it can reflect my bad feelings from bad experience. 

Oh, I forgot to tell you guys. In korean culture, it's common that older people treat younger people poorly. But chef Ed, who asked our age, He didn't have to ask and talk about our age in spite of our young looking-appearence. Was that really necessary to ask our age? His attitude definitely made it worse.

The service is great though. So that's a plus. Very polite and always askin if we needed anything.

I want some sushi NOW!!!!

Its hard to find sushi during lunch hours on the strip. Mind you that I didn't have any fancy jeezus phone or other interwebz navigating phone on me so I had to depend on my simple, yet reliable and dependable intuition... and lifelines. ;D  As I walked the strip during lunch hour sunshine I was rudely awakened to the fact after epic fail after epic fail that sushi apparently only open during dinner hours. FML!!!! 

I end up calling my cousin to yelp it... bare in mind he doesn't know how to use the ever HOLY YELP but does what he can for me off his interwebz capable cell. He forwards me a list and after several returned calls of being open hours later one of them responds that they are currently open. I tell the cabbie who then proceeds to drive my ass half an hour into the desert. Who knew????

WTF??

Well, I get there to this strip mall in the middle of no where and proceed to order and drink, drink and eat, and eat and drink some more. I dock them one star for the uni.. it wasn't as good as I would have expected but then again we are in the desert and I suppose should be grateful for anything shell fish. After ordering countless orders of sashimi and sushi I realize that they offer a all-you-can-eat sushi. 

Oh well!

It appears that a lot of people come here for this. I had no idea what to order so I flagged the closest waiter for assistance. The helpful and over zealous staff suggested a number of oddly named rolls which we humored them by ordering. Well, I can at least tell you that their menu offerings were pretty damned good. I wish I could remember the named of the lobster covered roll that I ordered because it was indulgent. So other than the uni I had no complaints about traveling the better part of an hour to get here. 

now how do i get back to the strip?

She ordered AYCE for $21...her food looked amazing.
I opted for a lot of low-calorie things, so I got fresh albacore (6 pc), house salad w/ dressing on the side, and miso soup.My food was amazing and I tried one of her lobster roll,that was also amazing!
They had served us edamame as an appetizer beforehand I guess...awesome i love those little perks places like this offer. Sometimes its cucumber salad. Love.
She ended up getting a pink ball of ice cream after,but I didn't try it.

We found the service excellent, contrary to some reviews. Maybe because it was not busy or from over staffing, we were asked ""How is everything?"" every 5 minutes, even thought we were sitting at the bar.

The food was just OK. We liked the ahi poke, spider hand roll, white tuna, and especially the green tiramisu. On the other hand, we were not excited about the miso soup, bland tasting sushi, water-down soy sauce, light wasabi, and $2.50 xtra for hot tea.

Over all, we thought $67 for two AYCE including 15% tip is just a little higher than most places in town especially for average food.

As soon as we sat down a gentleman took our drink order and first round of food since we decided to all you can eat, we started receiving our food from the bar but with no server in sight, with at least 10-12 servers/bussers walking around, about 20 minutes go by and my husband still hasn't gotten a refill and we still had a stack of used plates in front of us, finally I went up and talked to the host because we still haven't received refills or even taken any more orders, so we decided we just wanted the check even though we were still hungry

The host was extremely nice and I told her what had happened and she explained our first server was leaving and a lady was supposed to come help but she never did and she apologized and went and got the manager, she as well was very nice and asked if she could do anything but at this point we were so frustrated we just asked for the check and she kindly said no, and so we left... honestly this was one of my favorite places to go but after ruining our Valentine's Day like this we won't be back and that saddens me because of one person who neglected to even check on us or even introduce herself but then again we never even saw the first server again either or was told he was leaving so bad on the service area, but I do appreciate both the host and managers concern",LYvkig_R6PJ-7NIinketQg,0,0,1,G-1v9FWZXydg6FBRzr0N0Q

First, NO.  Just no.  I want to shout this at the top of my lungs to the owner/manager/whatever of this place.  The sushi here was the WORST ever that Ive tasted.  They boast an impressive menu but too bad they do not know how to properly make each roll.  The fish was SLIMY and gross.  Sushi rolls should not slide down your throat, you should be able to chew them and relish in all the amazing flavors.  I couldn't distinguish any of the rolls apart and the WORST one was the Hawaiian roll.  It completely ruined my entire appetite and I couldnt eat any more sushi.  Like literally too disgusted.

Secondly, NO.  The service needed some help.  They were friendly but when they got busy they couldn't keep up.  There were 4 sushi chefs and 3 waitresses with the restaurant being full.  It took forever to get us seated (the hostess has to waitress just to keep up), forever to get our sushi rolls, and forever to get a refill and we went there when it was NOT busy.  

Lastly, my boyfriend and I both immediately felt sick to our stomachs when we left.  Like nauseous, clutch your stomach, take tiny sips of water and moan sick.

So why one star?  Why bother to give one?  Because the staff WAS friendly whenever they did talk to us.

2 Stars
How this place ever got a vote for best sushi place in Las Vegas is beyond stupid. I know going there on father's day might have been a bad idea for AYCE. So 6 of us went in at 2pm. It was pretty full but people were starting to leave.
 Yes we were seated immediately ( Which explains 1 star) and our first order of rolls and appetizers came out quick enough ( 1 more star) but they didn't even bring out ALL the first orders. I ordered a pink lady and it didn't even come out until 40 minutes  and it was my 1/2 of my FIRST ROLL. Then when it came out it looked like a 6 yr. old just grabbed mayonnaise and some seafood and loosely rolled it in soy paper. It was so big it fell apart. They might as well have just jammed the thing in a rice bowl and given me a spoon.It also tasted like the seafood part was sitting out.
  At least the waitress that helped us was apologetic. I'm not returning here ever and if I was invited to come here I would just decline. I still rather go to Sushi Bay off warm springs for their faster service and better variety of sushi",vrjI_urdez08BO-3a6MuMg,0,0,3,HFOCmxNmHybs3L7_JqMt2w

Let me begin by saying that this was the worst possible service ever! The food was okay and I have had much better, but this review is strictly based off of service. I've worked in the restaurant industry so I know that when an incomplete party of 8 show up at 10pm, it could be annoying, however, you don't let the customer know. Well, thats what the male busser with spiked black hair and glasses made clear last night. Every question I asked him about our table he would give a short answer and then turn his back on me immediately (Keep in mind, I worked as a hostess in Vegas for 6+ years, I know how to passive aggressively tell a customer F* you and this kid did it.) Next my friend and I asked if we could wait at the bar and grab a drink and wait for the rest of the party to show, then the hostess says,""If you don't plan on buying anything."" I get it, they don't want to transfer the bill or whatever, so fine, we wait. Our party arrives and then we are seated and our server, a lady, I don't know her name because she never introduced herself and made it clear we were annoying her. We ordered a lot of food and tons of sushi and when the sushi came out, the staff didn't even know the names of the rolls, so when we would send it back because we did recognize the names, she would immediately come back and act as if it was our fault and stated the correct names (wow). Towards dessert she lightened up a bit. We aren't a difficult crowd, we all work(ed) in the industry and understand the difficulties of customer service (I'm not saying we're saints because we work in the industry, but we are more courteous than most that don't).
 I don't recommend this place for service, the sushi was alright. We ordered gyoza, rib eye (which they didn't ask which temperature and we were lucky to get beef jerky), miso soup, calamari, shrimp tempura, creme brûlée, mochi, and different flavor ice cream.

For a 5 order the size was well, but when it came to 6-8 piece orders the sizes were to larger as if they were buffing it with rice and lacking any taste. When eating sushi I want to enjoy it not have a mouthful of rice and if was a good size it felt as if the sushi chefs were using the crab as a crutch to fill most of the sushi. One of my most enjoyed rolls the rainbow roll consisted of no avocado, loads of crab, and poorly sliced pieces. 

This is my third time here and I'll say that every experience here has been a gradual decrease of pleasure. The nigiri was enjoyable but that was all.

It would be Cajun Albacore & Tempura fried ice cream. This place doesn't have temp. ice cream, but they do have the best Cajun Albacore. The flavor is mouth watering! And you can't even see the rice with this huge savory slice over it. I eat these like chips!

Fish was fresher than I would have expected which was a pleasant surprise. They have oysters on a half shell as well. And uni!!! One per customer but still great.

The green tea creme brûlée was awesome. Tons of matcha flavor. Don't bother with the  green tea ice cream though - worst green tea ice cream I've ever had. Also don't bother with the yakitori it was disappointing.

The restaurant is very cute, decked out in the typical Japanese style (fountains, folding screens) with a modern feel. It could serve well as a date spot or a family dinner outing, based on the groups of people I spotted. While we waited for our take-out order, the host offered us beverages, which was a very nice touch.

I tend to judge restaurants based on how vegetarian- and vegan-friendly they are, and this place definitely passed. There are at least 10 or 12 vegetarian rolls to choose from. I ordered the asparagus and avocado roll, vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of them were very good. The sushi in particular was well-made and tasty, which was surprising considering that this restaurant advertises its All You Can Eat special.

I got a piece of salmon that had what I assume was cartilage that was like chewing on leather. I've never had that happen with sushi before. Obviously, sushi by nature is somewhat chewy, but this was inedible. We ordered a few more rolls and it took forvever for it to come out. The avocados on the caterpillar roll were browning. The waitress rarely came to check on us. Not what I had come to expect from this place, but from what I hear this is the status quo now.

For  AYCE, sushi is very much up to par. It's not the best, but you definitely appreciate the taste. The best rolls were: Lobster flare, tiger roll, spider roll, and monster roll. Uni is good but you can only get 1 order.  Also, we saw that they ran out of ingredients or particular sushi (it's never fun to pay for AYCE only to find out the items you want had run out).

Now, the service is not the most accommodating, I'm afraid to say.

Another thing noted was a food runner gave us a rainbow roll that we did not order which had avocado, and my girlfriend is highly allergic to avocado so I dont know why they didn't make sure it was going to the right table.

The catch to the rolls was as I suspected- tons of rice. One roll was so loaded that I felt my body refusing to chew any more of it. The sushi was another story- the amount of rice was fair. Oh, and sidenote, you're charged regular price for anything you remove or fail to consume the rice from. 

It seems that the best way to fill up without tapping out too early is to focus on the hot items and sushi- fill up on surf and turf, calamari, and ahi poke salad and pick maybe one or two rolls that sound too good to deny yourself of them. Or, you could be me and go roll crazy and have to fight yourself to chew. 

There are very tempting dessert options, of which you're limited to one (sad!) Bring friends and share all four. The mochi (mango or raspberry) was tiny, but I can imagine it was a refreshing treat. I had the creme brulee and my friend had the green tiramisu. Both were absolutely wonderful. The green tiramisu was a first for me and it was so exciting to eat. Creamy, yet subtle, yet sweet. 

The only qualm I have with my experience was that we were there on a day when the sushi kitchen was hopelessly backed up. All of our hot food came out quickly, but the sushi took what felt like forever to appear. It became an issue for friends who didn't order hot food and waited well over an hour to eat anything. 

Luckily the two-hour ordering limit was not applied to us or else this would be a fishy deal!",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,2,1,3,rOPgw8ynXwTlvQ539xorhA

This friend said take the 95, take the 95, blah blah blah.  Even after the waiter said take the 215, my friend INSISTED on taking the 95.  The waiter probably said: ""whatever, dude, get lost and then wait longer and have your friends kick your ass before you eat our delicious buffet"".  After another friend looked Oyshi Sushi himself, we found out that we should take the 215 and did so after I got all frustrated driving in the 15 fwy traffic.

In any case, after waiting and getting seated at our table, we went straight to ordering our all-you-can-eat, which includes 2 uni (sea urchin) pieces, 2 amaebi (raw, sweet shrimp) pieces & 4 raw oysters.  Yep, there's a limit on those but you must understand that there aren't that many other places that would even give you these premium sushi pieces.  Just a note on the uni - slightly less fresh than I've had before.  In any case, you get these in addition to their fresh & delicious sushi.  Their salmon, yellowtail, albacore, halibut sushis are great, plus they don't give you as much rice in their sushi as other places.  Their rib-eye teriyaki is also an excellent dish to have.  Their tempura is also very good.  As for the dessert, we all had the strawberry mochi ice cream, which was very good.  All for $25 per person.  Not bad at all.

I only have to mention a couple of cons: there is a 1 dessert limit for each person.  However, you can have all the ice cream you want since this is not considered one of the dessert items.  Plus, I find it just strange that the place is so huge and yet they waste so much space & put tiny little tables in the center when you can get bigger tables there to accommodate more people.  Last con... service.  A bit slow.  It was a really busy night, but I'm still surprised that they took more than 15 mins to take out raw food.

When I first discovered this place, I was so enamored by their flavor and service, that I told every single person looking for a good place to eat, local or tourist, that they HAVE to go to Oyshi Sushi and get AYCE!

I'm a big fan of nigiri and I highly recommend their nigiri because the ratio of fish to rice is 80-20. The fish they use is very fresh and they use a huge slice! OMG! My top list of nigiri: Cajun albacore, salmon, and eel! Have to have it every time.  Also highly recommended: Love Affair, Salmon Lover, Sunrise, and Red Dragon.  Their appetizers are awesome as well, but the ones that stick out the most that some sushi bars don't have are: Surf & Turf, Potato Croquette, grilled beef asparagus, and the Unagi (eel) bowl! Mmmmm!

They also do dinner reservations if you have a large party coming. They have VIP rooms that can accommodate large parties if you call ahead.  I've sat in their VIP rooms and their chairs are extra comfortable. The dining area near the entrance has a huge mural that gives this place it's feel and vibe.

It totally ruins the flow of the dinner. Take today, for example.

Went to this place for lunch nd felt so uncomfortable. I asked to be seated at the bar bc I was alone nd pregnant, so I thought it was good to see how they handle the food beside I expected it to be fun nd fast. I did all u can eat. Waited 30min for my app: gyoza. The chefs never said hi or even looked at my direction with care or happiness. ""I have been always greeted at a bar/sushi bar"", it is the least they can do. One of the chef made a silly comment as soon as I arrived at the bar, after that I knew I was at the wrong place. From 4 different kind of rolls I would only came back for 1 (maniac roll) it was the only one spice with no sweet sauce or fake crabmeat. Everything else was just blah blah blah. The service was polite but slow nd confused. I never had a refill on my water. Their (management/sushi chef) seems like to kiss the good looking/well dressed ppl ass. Everyone else were mistreated including myself. This was the worse place I have ever been. I would never come back here once I won't put my best clothes just to someone treat me with respect. Besides for 1 single good roll??? Forget it. I would prefer to drive to 808 sushi that' is not fancy but better quality sushi and a way better service. . The first roll I had was the monster (every single piece of it fell apart when trying to eat it. every single roll were ugly and tasteless except for the super sweet sauce and super sweet crabmeat combination they put on everything.
My experience at this place lasted around 1 1/2hour bc it would take between 25-35 min for every order. Plus 20min for the check. In the end I can say: The only good thing about this place is that you can do half order... That's all.",FfmgyuKJ8dfKQYsx7xZfqg,2,0,2,e_ve-r9_zN1USbybg2LB2w

As for the food, we started off with nigiri sushi, then moved on with the specialty rolls.  I quickly realized that their fish wasn't 100% fresh when it was laying simple and bare as nigiri sushi.  However, they do concoct good sauces and compose interesting rolls (maybe to compensate for the lesser quality of the fish).

The weird thing I noticed when we ordered unagi... In all other sushi bars I've been to, unagi is broiled for a few minutes before making it into sushi to give it nice caramelization.  Here, they skip it, and while the unagi seems slightly warm, it was not crispy and the flavor was a bit muted (I think broiling intensifies the flavor).

From experiences at other sushi restaurants, this place was mediocre. The fish could have been fresher, but I'm guessing with the ""All You Can Eat"" staple on their menu, they get whatever fish they can and throw it in a roll.

My second visit to Oyshi was for dinner, and I ordered the Ahi poki salad, the Love Affair sushi roll, and a parfait of course! The salad and the sushi roll were excellent, the best part was probably the Love Affair sushi roll.. probably the best roll I had in a while, from what I remember, it had lobster and crab meat, it was awesome! So here it goes, if so excellent, why the 4 stars you ask.. 

Well.. the parfait. It was so much bigger and tastier the first time around.. from what I recall, it was served in a taller glass the last time, more ice cream and more toppings.. This time, it was skimped down to a smaller glass, and yes, smaller glass means smaller parfait. It also lacked the toppings I once remembered it had.

Got here on a Friday night, no reservation. It was super busy, we waited about 25 minutes. We didn't mind the wait, we were pretty excited to try somewhere new. Our waiter immediately took our drink orders, and then asked if we'd like to order. All three of us got all you can eat, so we could try a bunch of stuff together. We got edemame, chicken yakitori, muscles, raw oysters, gyoza, yellowtail nigiri, miso soup, and a few rolls. The raw oysters were outstanding. Soooo fresh and good! The chicken was tasty, the muscles were fresh and not too much sauce,  the edemame was steamed perfectly. The nigiri was a little different, but tasted okay. The tiger roll and the screaming roll were only okay. An OVERLOAD of rice, it was almost astonishing. Like holy shit, that's a lot of rice, bro. The hawiaan and whatever rolls my friend got were pretty tasty. Overall, it's worth it just for the appetizers. I'll come back to try different rolls

By the way, when my friend got a refill on her sprite, he came back and she said that the syrup was all out, it just tasted like soda water. He was confused. Did she want another one? Uhm. Yeah. So he went into the kitchen, literally stood there for a few seconds, and came back and gave her the SAME glass. Oh boy.

I wouldn't call myself a sushi extraordinaire, but I do think that I have been to quite a few sushi spots and have a holistic view of what I do and do not like. I think that this location's sushi just didn't hit the target. The baked sushi came out cold (will elaborate on this in the section below), and they were nearly always DRENCHED (not an over-exaggeration) in sauce. I did, however, rather enjoy the sashimi, but that is because it came out plain and simple. 

I ordered the following on my last visit: Kimono roll, Japanese Lasagna, Shrimp Tempura, Baked Tuna, and Tuna Sashimi. We didn't do AYCE because my stomach can't handle that much food. Anyway, the Kimono roll was pretty good--instead of nori, it was wrapped in soy rice paper, so I was digging the difference. However, when I picked it up a piece with my chopsticks, the whole thing fell apart. For $12 for five or six pieces, I was not impressed. I think this happened with nearly all of the rolls I ordered EXCEPT for the Shrimp Tempura roll. The Japanese Lasagna was drenched in sauce and topped with creamed cheese. It was cold and the flavor was too rich and too heavy. I couldn't even taste any of the other elements of it because it was overpowered by unagi sauce and cream cheese. The Baked Tuna came with poor presentation--already coming apart before any of us even attempted to grab a piece. It was cold and had too much unagi sauce. Like I said, the tuna sashimi was pretty good. Not as fresh as other places that I have been to, but it did the job. 

SERVICE: 2.5/5
I am not sure why it took so long to get my food. Each roll came out one at a time with nearly five minutes between each. By the time our last roll came, we didn't want to eat anymore. Additionally, people around us who ordered similar rolls (baked, fried, etc.) got their food very quickly. When the food came out it was room temperature or cold when it was supposed to be baked. Our whole dining experience lasted nearly 2 hours because of the delay. We were never apologized to; it nearly seemed like a norm for food to come out to the tables that slowly. I had to check on each (again--not an over-exaggeration) roll to see when and if they were coming out. I would like to say, though, the server did refill my water quite a few times. 

AMBIANCE: 3/5
The music was pretty loud in this place, which didn't really appeal to me. It kind of made me have an aversion to my meal and a bit of a headache. I think that is what they were going for though: a modern feel for younger folk. I appreciated the attempt. The decor was pretty nice though. I also enjoyed the wall designs. 

PRICE: 2.5/5
I have to say that I am not very happy to have spent $55 for sushi that I didn't quite enjoy. The food was rather high-priced for the quality of service and food offered. I would say that compared to their competition, Oyshi is priced rather high. I am all for paying a pretty penny for pretty sushi, but I wouldn't categorize this place's sushi as such.

It was a very refreshing change from our normal haunting place here in Silverado Ranch.  Oyshi is very nice.  Most of their patrons are young adults and they have pop music in the background.  We really liked the ambiance of the restaurant.  The best part was the food, for an AYCE dinner, it is somewhat on the pricey side but we wanted to try their extensive sushis.  They have hand rolls, cut sushi, baked, deep fried, fusion, vegetarian, specialty, and sashimi (this isn't included in the AYCE price though).  You can also have some appetizers and various salads, rice bowls, and dessert with the AYCE price.  For the two of us with regular drinks, we spent $61 ($71 with tip), so as you can see, it can get pricey.  

Now, for the review of the food.  We ordered AYCE and we ate our fill of sushi.

My order:
1) Deep fried Philly - loved it!  It was cooked well and not dried up.  The sauce on it is enough that it doesn't require soy sauce to enjoy.
2) Rainbow Roll - so fresh and tasty.
3) Tiger Roll - it was so beautiful and enjoyed it immensely.
4)  Double Salmon - I enjoy salmon so this was a no brainer.

My partner:
1)  Supreme Vegetarian -  he liked it but it was wrapped in soy paper.  He liked the veggies that were rolled in the ""sushi.""
2)  Hawaiian Roll - this is a definite thing to order!
3)  California Roll - they were done well as they should be.  It is a staple in any sushi place.
4)  Japanese Lasagna - this one is baked.  He wasn't a fan of cooked sushi.

Then, the heavenly bites of dessert came.  My partner had the Strawberry Mochi and I had the Creme Brule.  I have to say, the Creme Brule was a taste of heaven.  I was so glad we got this for sure.

To end my LONGEST review(so far), this sushi place is definitely a go to place for us.  The ambiance was awesome, the food were tasty, and over all, its a definite place to try out.  Just be sure your wallet can afford the bill.",v9NLnZg7lei5AWLcQOL9DQ,1,1,5,4KeFwvQUnjFZ78MvDJdGHA

The AYCE price is the same as most places. The items were good, but nothing too special. Service is kinda poor. Maybe because I am usually here with a larger party so we are usually in one of the private rooms. I must say though, the room on the left with the couches is nice, but not ideal for a dining area...

2318856,2013-11-19,1,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Oyshi used to be my favorite AYCE sushi spot.  They had a wide variety of quality rolls, great tasting food, consistent service, and a really nice atmosphere that made for a great spot to have pre-game Friday night dinner. 

Although the sushi is still pretty good, the service and management has gone off the deep end and because of this, I don't think I'll ever eat at Oyshi again.  There are too many quality sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to justify returning to Oyshi where the last few visits, all I seem to get are orders that never show up, drinks that never get filled, waiters that refuse to come to our table or our spot at the bar (even though it's obvious that you've seen me flag you down), and servers/staff that are increasingly bitter and unfriendly.  

This stuff matters. Oddly enough, it's also the stuff that is easiest to fix. When you've already got quality menu items, quality sushi chefs, and quality sushi rolls that people rave about - why are you letting your terrible servers and management ruin your restaurant?

If I'm sitting at the sushi bar and I'm trying to order more beer and sake, why are people refusing to help me out? If I want to give you my money in exchange for some-what overpriced alcohol, why does it take more than 20 minutes for someone to take my drink order and then another 20 to bring me a couple of beers and sake? This should never be an issue with a sushi restaurant.  Never. Sure, AYCE places get really busy and I totally understand that. But, if you can't handle the heat - hire more servers. 

I shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for my order. And when my order does come out, half of it shouldn't be missing. It also shouldn't take you another 30 minutes to bring out the pieces missing from my order. And you shouldn't have an attitude with customers just because they are asking for the items they originally ordered that are missing because you either forgot to put the orders in or there was a mix up in the kitchen. I am never rude to waiters or management and this last experience at Oyshi was no exception. I was pleasant and more than patient and if I still can't get someone to so much as offer an apology for missing orders/missing drinks and for treating me like I was more of a burden than a customer bringing a lot of business to the establishment, then I will happily take my business elsewhere. 

Sorry, Oyshi, it was good while it lasted!",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,14,3,2,AkGAv3COZ9lMY144g7sK-w

Unfortunately nothing really stood out for me or remember wow factor so took longer time too come back. Nowadays in Vegas AYCE sushi is so competitive and dime dozen that it really hard too stand out unless really good. My opinion the sushi is good but not great or definitely no Wow factor for me. The menu has a nice diversity too it between the appetizers (oyster on the half shell by far my favorite), nigiri, and speciality rolls (i had some kind of spicy tuna roll; sorry forget the name but was really good)  too choose from sure find something like. Whenever I go AYCE more all about the nigiri style because feel that the true barometer of quality of the fish. I felt like compare too other places especially my top spot sushi house goyemon not in the same class. The irony was originally went too sushi hour goyemon but the wait was ridiculous. Me and Roy was hunger so decided too check out something new. Thankfully on this night Oyshi Sushi not packed went right in and sat down went sushi crazy!! 

The restaurant is lot more open then most AYCE so usually not lot of waiting too sit down. They do have private rooms for big parties. Not sure if charge extra but nice option too know if party of eight or more. The sushi bar is decent size with two too three sushi chefs going at time. Most part even on say that night half packed we were getting our sushi in timely manner. The server was great keep up on everything and even nice enough towards the end we ordered one too many speciality rolls (thanks Roy) she like no worries no forcing not going too charge us for waste! Think that was really cool! 

I like that the restaurant is open because you can have conversations without screaming with other person sitting next or across from you. Oyshi Sushi is place that come back too again but with so many other ones and not that high on my list.

Every dining experience has been excellent - the service is always friendly and attentive and food perfectly cooked/prepared.   We did a few ala cartes but most of the time it's always AYCE, both lunch and dinner.  Heck if they had breakfast I would do that too.  

Most sushi places have a few items that are exceptional and a few not so great, but everything here range from good to phenomenal.  

Let me talk a bit about their sashimi items.  I love sashimis and this place has some of the best sashimis i've ever eaten.  Their Seared Albacore with crispy onion in ginger sauce is oh so heavenly.  The only  problem is their sashimis are not included with the AYCE menu and that's understandable because the sashimis are pricier.  Another one is the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce.  OMG this melts in your mouth and it should be called screaming orgasm for your mouth!  amazing stuff!  How about this ""Tuna sashimi with shaved daikon in a chef special sauce""? Everytime i finish this plate I want to lick the sauce off the plate but there's always people around me.  

Now for their rolls.  They make the typical rolls like Rainbow, Dragon, Spider, Dynamite and Catepillar taste amazing.  Flavor explosion with every bite.  They have a few rolls that are wrapped in thin soy paper sheet that are not as filling as the ones with rice.  Some days I do low carb and i would order a bunch of these.  Pink Lady and Oh My Heart are my favorites.  If you like scallop make sure you order the Volcano, baked scallop with yum yum sauce.  

Side dishes and appetizers are very small when you order with AYCE and that's a good thing cuz you just want to taste the variety of stuff.  Finish off with some mochi's and you can die happy.",btI9Tc36LYTDtU5NkukYUg,1,1,5,kvHSeazzZJHli_yD6O1yOw

Oh sheet, it's oyshi sushi. Definitely my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. This is my go to place for sushi with my husband and his co workers

The wait can be long, so get here early. The longest we've ever waited is max 20 mins

AYCE for lunch is 21 and dinner is 26 bucks, not bad. Which includes a large amount of appetizers and desserts

Favorite rolls: spicy tuna crunch, tiger roll, snow mountains. 

The desserts are delicious. The biggest hits being green tea mochi ice cream and the green tea tiramisu.  

The service is excellent, the rolls take a while to come out but it's worth the wait because you can taste the freshness. 

Like all sushi places, they charge you if you waste food. One bite or two isn't a big deal but don't waste an entire roll.

The restaurant looks like a high ended sushi house, that's well decorated. Very clean and open.

In a city where AYCE sushi is plenty of Oyshi does OK. It's in my rotation for when I'm craving AYCE sushi but not in my top favorites I do prefer others a lot more. It's All You Can Eat sushi and you can really eat all you can eat that's at least until they cut you off. It's your typical AYCE sushi, they all are sushi grade and they make your typical sushi dishes everyone is doing. Not many items wowing me but still many items satisfying.

The bad about Oyshi is their spicy tuna, imitation crab usage, and kind of little nigiri and sushi rolls which is fine if you did AYCE cause you can just order more but not cool if you weren't. They have a lot of items you want to order but aren't available with AYCE. They seem to have a lot of rules.

The good about Oyshi is just about everything else. It's a place to go people watch late nights. Did I already mention their green tea crème brulee. I've been there just for it without ordering anything else and when I do AYCE, I'll make sure there's always room for it at the end. They serve some of their entrees on a sizzling hotplate, I do like the steaks and chicken. 

They have a lunch special which includes a soup, salad, and your item of choice from various plates, there's a sushi plate, tempera plate, sashimi plate, and sizzle plate. It's not bad if your not wanting AYCE during lunch.

They offer all my favorites that I must have. They have oysters and uni but they're limited. They have shrimp tempera. They have poke, which like everyone else stretched out with other items. They have a good variety of specialty, tempera, baked, and fried rolls.

We have always gone if we are craving sushi and they have an AYCE option. We've never had the problem of getting seated right away which other people have mentioned, but I don't blame them because their staff and customer service is plain out horrible.

The first time my girlfriend took my to Oyshi she had an issue with the customer service that the waitress was giving her. She did not clarify the oysters which was a part of the AYCE and after she was very rude. After taking our order we saw her twice and then thereafter other waitresses had to take our order and deliver our food.

Our second time going to Oyshi it was fine. We were seated in a timely manner and received our orders of AYCE sushi without any issues.

The third time we went to Oyshi is WHY IM WRITING THIS REVIEW and have joined YELP and is also why I'm NOT GOING BACK THERE. We were seated in a timely manner and our order was taken in a timely manner as well, but after the waitress (Pinky) took our order of AYCE we never saw her again. That's when everything fell apart. Our food took at least 20 mins to come out and it wasn't even busy. Not only that, we always order baked mussels with our order  and that never came out to the point where we order a second round. We had to call over the host or the manager or whoever the guy that was dressed up with a tie was. When Pinky never came back a young waiter started to follow up on us. This waiter was ""AWESOME!"" NOT!!! The guy would only look at my girlfriend and never acknowledged me at all. I had to flag the guy down to get a refill on my drink because he would just ask my GF and leave. After waiting and losing our appetites we didn't even ask for dessert which is a part of the AYCE. We were so disgusted with the service that we just asked for the bill.

Lastly, THIS IS WHY I GAVE THEM A ONE STAR...

My bill came out to be $61.62 and because of the wait and the horrible customer service I DID NOT TIP THEM. SO TELL ME WHY AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS MY ACCOUNT WAS CHARGED $72?!?!?!?

There are private dining areas for a more intimate experience with seating from 5-20+ people.

One server came in and told me that he would clear out the dirty dishes before coming out with the cake which he didn't do. I had to get up and ask for extra dishes and forks from the hostess desk. They brought out the cake without lighting the candles that were provided and the cake still in the box. The food quality was not very good.

Although I have not been here in months because I moved on the opposite end of Vegas, now turning into a 30 minute drive, compared to a 5 minute drive =(

WHERE: Located on Rainbow & Robindale

WHAT:  Everything about this local sushi joint is outstanding! From the uniqueness of the special rolls to the to the great customer service, this is the place to try!

If you do get the chance to come here for your first, second, or millionth time, I suggest AYCE all the way!! Lunch is 24.95 and dinner is 27.95- so worth the time and money spent!

One of my favorite appetizers is the ahi poke! There's something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish!

ROLLS:
-Oyshi roll: The first thing you should try! It is their special roll, and the absolute best!!
-Vegas & Sibuya rolls: If I can recall, these are the 2 rolls without rice! & are both full of flavor!
-Japanese Lasagna roll: I always have to have my baked roll!!

There are other great rolls, but I can't remember what the names were! So, until next time! I will update soon!

I really enjoy all their different rolls but my favorites are the Rock n Roll and the crunchy scallop roll. The scallop roll has these little popcorn scallop pieces that are just so tasty. 

For dessert I always get the creme brûlée. If you get ayce, you only get one, but if you order a la carte the creme brûlée is served with three flavors (vanilla, green tea, and chocolate) but the vanilla is the best. 

The downside to this restaurant is the wait to get seated which can sometimes be a good hour or more because it's popular. The second downside is the service. Sometimes they are pretty unattentive due to the fact that they are so busy.",sloM9x3d_sDCXQJKDANSuw,0,0,4,11t_2NfMr8FGTjfh66Q3Ag

I got the all you can eat, and I got my $21 worth. No complaint there. But the sushi isn't very authentic in that it's nothing a Japanese person would readily recognize. Seems to be part of this ""fusion"" sushi movement. I told the sushi chef it wanted an omekase selection, and he had no idea what I was talking about. BAD SIGN! I probably should have just given up and gone to Osaka, but alas I stayed. Most of the rolls were average, but the yellowtail trio had a terrible ginger sauce. I couldn't finish it. 

Aside from the food, the service was non-existent. I moved to a quiet corner to avoid a very loud group and I was completely forgotten. I had to get up and ask for my check after 15 minutes of waiting.

My biggest complaint is with the music. There is rap music blaring, even on a Sunday afternoon. I guess they're trying to attact a young, hip crowd, but they're really only driving away customers.

Talking from a server perspective, how hard is it to make sushi??? There is no cooking involved!  When we finally got our order, I was very disappointed.

2851841,2011-12-19,6,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Hmmm...I was planning to lose my AYCE sushi virginity to Ms. Goyemon but there was a two hour wait so instead I opted for the next girl available named Ms. Oyshi....I'd rather like to think we didn't go all the way and I'm still saving myself for the former.  

For 26 bucks, I think it's definitely in line with Sushi Goyemon, but I happened to be in the company of some friends who had been there as well, so I was able to get some perspective as I proceeded with my first time navigating this a la carte ordering feeding frenzy.  The first few speed bumps which caught my eye were some ground rules listed in the menu:

1. No sashimi, only one order of oysters (4 pieces), uni, and sweet shrimp allowed...fair enough

2. No excess rice shall be allowed to remain uneaten on the plate, otherwise that order will be counted as extra on the final bill....have people been discarding their rice into a large pile assembling a massive sculptured mountain of rice?  The rice that was used to prepare the sushi was highly variable in quality  (too soft, too firm, or mixed) throughout the various rounds of ordering so it only motivated us to concoct creative methods for disposing the rice (hiding it in the tea jar, breaking it into tiny grains and scattering it across the plate so as to create the illusion of a clean plate, and to borrow a technique from a friend who disliked rice during her early childhood, placing said rice into mouth and going to bathroom to dispose in toilet/trash).  Of course none of this was done, but it was tempting nonetheless.

3.  Any orders which are unfinished in general will be counted as extra orders on the final bill...this was adhered yet strangely enough after receiving our final round of food (a modest 2-3 rolls) the server waited when we were rubbing our bellies and chimes in ""you have two more rolls coming!"" and none of us had any idea where these phantom rolls were coming from and she then replies with a snarky shrug  ""I'll take them off your order"" as if she was doing us a favor....pure shenanigans

4. The jalapeno poppers on the appetizer menu were not allowed to be included amongst the AYCE orders....what kind of crazy logic is this?  Wouldn't it be good strategy to fill your customers with heartburn due to fatty spicy cream cheese richness to slow down their intake of much much more expensive items?  Either these are the greatest jalapeno poppers in the history of appetizers or a missed business opportunity.   I don't even like jalapeno poppers but I almost was willing  to eat one just because this condition existed.

THE MEAL

The appetizers  (ahi poke, spicy sashimi salad, and miso soup)  The poke might as well have been unseasoned sashimi, whereas the sashimi salad was overdressed nearly drowning in the chili vinaigrette, and the miso soup was surprisingly not overly salty as I anticipated but ended up being the surprise highlight of the meal.

The ""big three"" (uni, raw oysters, and sweet shrimp)...not exceedingly fresh but no risk of possible food poisoning either, although the oysters had a watered down quality to them....only tasted good since they were not specifically paid for.

The nigiri:  I sampled the surfer clam, spanish mackerel, japanese yellowtail, and a few other standards....there was definitely something I couldn't put my finger on but the level of freshness just seemed 1 level below what you would expect if you ordered these same items at a regular reputable sushi bar.  I'm thinking perhaps they were precut in mass production and by the time they arrived they were partially dried out from the external surface area of each piece of fish being exposed for a prolonged period of time.

The rolls:  Perhaps I've had enough sushi experiences to have progressed beyond rolls since they are drenched in so much sauce (seriously, what is the obsession with orgasm sauce in this town?), crispy shavings of empty calories, or packed with so many types of fish that I couldn't really differentiate any of them out of a sushi roll lineup much like the Seinfeld episode where George tries to catch the Twix bar candy thief (""It's a SETUP! They're all Caterpillar rolls!!"")  I would try to limit your roll intake and focus on the other items to keep your palate from being overwhelmed(and to avoid the server from pulling that phantom roll maneuver as previously discussed)

Last but not least, we figured we had successfully navigated through the labyrinth of extra charges until we received the final bill which charged us for the hot tea...are you serious???  So you're telling me I could have drank an entire gallon of miso soup instead of one measly cup of hot green tea which cost you pennies to brew?  Perhaps these were some tea leaves taken from the Emperor's garden, but I would appreciate a warning next time.  

3 stars only because we definitely still got our money's worth, but I'm leaving a few more stars to be earned since my friends reassured me Goyemon is better.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,3,1,3,1vptE3Z5n_b0D0xSfiimRQ

They had a spacious seating arrangement, colorful decor, Xgames and the Laker's Game on TV, and Techno music playing in the background (not really what I had expected in a Sushi joint).  We came for the AYCE @ about $22.00 for dinner.  It's decently priced for AYCE.  The price does not include a drink.  The selection of food on the menu was pretty good.  They had a good assortment of appetizers, specialty rolls, and traditional Nigiri (not to mention hand cut Maki rolls).  I am a big fan of Sashimi, but like 99% of the time, the Sashimi is not included in the AYCE.  I did however stock up on the Sake (raw Salmon) Nigiri.  Being my favorite Nigiri, I found their Sake Nigiri to be very very fresh.  It was super bright orange and tasted incredible!  For dessert, they have a few different flavors of Mochi, but you can only get one.  If I remember correctly, the flavors are as follows: Green Tea, Mango, and Red Bean.  I opted for the Mango and wish I could have had a second since they were pretty small in size.  Anyhow, the Sake Nigiri alone would have gotten Oyshi 4 stars, but unfortunately the service was extremely slow.  On top of that, the only soup available was the Miso Soup.  How do you not have Udon on the AYCE menu?  Seriously?? They also did not have low-sodium soy sauce (I know it still has like 800mg per tbsp , but that's better than 1000mg).

We've been coming here for years and won't go to any other sushi spot. The servers know us and remember our orders. We usually come on a weekday lunch and it's not too busy.  If you come before 3:30pm it's a little cheaper for lunch pricing. 
With all-you-can-eat you have the freedom of ordering all appetizers, all sushi (excluding sashimi) and dessert to finish.  Their fish is extremely fresh and the sushi chef's will make special requested rolls if you ask.
They have a great selection on their menu of specialty rolls and descriptions. If you sit at the sushi bar you have the option to order 1/2 rolls if you want to try something new but aren't sure if you'll like it. 
Make sure you eat what you order. Don't be that person! If you are completely stuffed they won't nickel and dime you if you don't eat one or two pieces but don't put your server in that awkward spot to charge you.
The restaurant is a big open venue and they have private dining rooms too for special events. They play great music all day and it's  not too loud during lunch. Dinner however is more trendy, music is louder, the crowds are bigger and the lights are turned low. Expect to wait on Friday and Saturday nights!

I'm usually not a fan of ponzu sauce but the Iris roll**** off the new menu was so good I had 2 of them. It had  Spicy albacore with cucumber, wrapped with avocado, and seared tuna. My eating partner in crime loved it. 

Screaming Roll****shrimp tempura roll wrapped with yum-yum cajun albacore and avocado with garlic ponzu sauce. Flavor of cajun albacore was awesome. 

Love Affair roll ***shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. This was good, but came in last of all the other rolls. 

Asian skirt steak*** is served teriaki style on a sizzling mini skillet. It was a nice addition to sushi.

Service was better than average. I always sit at the sushi bar. Here you order from a waiter instead of directly from sushi chefs. My waiter was attentive, I had enough H2O to drink and never had to wait on food or ordering more of it.

Pretty good deal, especially for how extensive their menu is.

I wasn't really feeling like rolls, so I ordered and ate mostly nigiri -- so my 3 stars is based mostly on that. The pieces of fish were on the smaller side, and (obviously) the fish isn't the freshest you're going to find at a sushi joint (some of the uni looked a tad bit iffy, but I'm also on the paranoid side when eating raw stuff).

We decided to go last night and the fish was NOT fresh at all . The Uni being the worst - was very brown and I had to send it back . The waitress even made a comment about it....
The tuna and salmon on our rolls were off colored - not the normal vibrant red and orange fresh versions should be. 

The nigiri pieces came out better - super white tuna was the best, salmon belly, and garlic tuna. 
Yellowtail was off perhaps I should've asked for a different cut . Oh and they put double rice to fish ratio which is annoying and takes away from the enjoyment of the fish 

All in all I was very disappointed in Oyshi's decline in quality and I won't be returning . The server was very attentive and quick . She's the reason for extra star . 

LESSON: walk up to the bar and check fish quality/freshness before committing to ayce or even eating there at all !",Ome9YBGqPyXEEhgP9IS8_g,7,2,2,XGAeR6qtf13e_2fSf8u3ng

The place use to be a packed house, and now there's no wait on a Friday night and I can see why. The waiters are snobbish and rude and the manager has no backbone to stand up to them. On top of that, they super pack the rolls and sushi with rice and if you can't eat it all, they'll charge you for it. Our waiter was a fat dick (not the good kind, fat and an a$$hole) from the start of the night. He barely acknowledged us the whole night. Anytime we signaled him to order, he looked annoyed and wouldn't come over until ten minutes later. Again with the rice, the douche bag wanted to charge us $14 for not eating all the rice. WTF man, all the rice we didn't eat didn't even equal a bowl of rice they normally charge you $1 for. When we asked the manager about it, he was useless and just said, ""You don't have to tip the waiter. He doesn't expect a tip."" After arguing about fairness and how the establishment has gone to crap, we walked out of there paying $4 extra for rice...

This restaurant is great for people who loves ""rolls"". I enjoy rolls too but I enjoy regular nigiri sushi, which, I think, is the best way to enjoy the quality of fish. When I order Tuna nigiri, the sushi came out WET & SOGGY like the fish was just microwaved and defrosted. I do not know what caused it to be wet & soggy but I've never seen such thing in my life. Sea Urchin is not edible if they are not decent quality and this restaurant's sea urchin was not good at all.

Of my memory serves me correctly we started with a Poke salad followed by 9 different sushi choices and ended with dessert.

3184562,2014-01-20,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"I am still in love with this place!! Since it was just me and a friend, we opted for first available seating Nd that ended up being at the bar. It's a while new environment when you sit at the bar! If it's just you and a friend, I recommend sitting at the bar. If it's you and your family or a large group, stick to a table. But I do recommend experiencing the bar when you can. 

By sitting at the bar, you are face to face with the sushi chefs. You may order your rolls directly from them and if you are daring, you can just have them make rolls for you without necessarily going off the menu (AYCE guests only, I'm guessing). Since it was the first time sitting at the bar for both of us, we didn't know that was possible until we had already ordered the world and we were just about bursting at the seams. We did try a fatty tuna sushi though which was basically made with tuna belly. It was sooooooo good!! 

We also had a bottle of lychee sake. It came in a wine sized bottle, but we decided to take shots of it. It was so yum and it basically tasted like juice. Which is dangerous because it had the same alc vol as wine, and my friend and I finished the bottle like it was nothing! 

Here are a few things that I think would be great to keep in mind while you're here: 
-if you and a friend are looking to hang out, enjoy great food, and be social, definitely sit at the bar and have the chefs make you whatever your heart desires 
-it's all you can eat, so definitely come here with an empty stomach and be prepared to eat the world! BUT...on busy nights, the wait can be awhile and if you come here super hungry, once you're seated, you'll want to order everything at once! This may not be a good thing, cuz if you're anything like us, you'll stuff your face and be done within 30 minutes. 
-if you're paying with multiple cards, make sure the person taking your payment knows what exactly is going on what card. Although  we thought that we were clear in our instructions, she still managed to charge the wrong amount!

Why on earth they didnt come at the same time is beyond me and why it would 10 ten minutes pisses me off even more. We ordered a couple roles and some salads. The salads came and we ate them and then sat there and sat there for about 15 minutes before we could even get someones attention to say hey whats happened??  They must have known how shitty they were with out me even complaining becase when the rolls finally did come they told us the salads would be complimentary due to the lack of service.

The atmosphere is modern, clean, and always plays the best Pandora Stations! I have been going here for years and have seen it change over time physically, however the food is consistent - and that's why I go back! 

It's located on Rainbow and Windmill which is literally less than a two minute drive from where I live. It's super convenient - the southwest area is developing like crazy so make sure to call ahead and make sure there's a table for you if you have a big group. Sometimes you have a wait a bit to get seated even for 2 people on a high volume day, but if call ahead it shouldn't be a problem. They've been improving seating people right away I have noticed the past few times. Prices are affordable and they also offer all you can eat. They have a private parking lot too. 

Also, during the weekdays they have an awesome lunch special. I ordered their chicken teriyaki which was a generous serving with a California roll, miso soup, vegetable/shrimp tempura, and a house salad all for $12!!!! Who wouldn't be stoked about that?

3275038,2012-05-10,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"LATE NIGHT SUSHI AT ITS BEST (At least, from what I've tried so far)

I usually don't get off until 11:15 at night, and by that time, most sushi bars in Vegas have already packed it in and called it a night, or are shortly about to. Not Oyshi!
Thankfully, this place stays open until 2AM (last call at 1:30 AM) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in Vegas.

The All-You-Can-Eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! Though not as great as other AYCE places I have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food. 

I think my favorite roll was the Yellowstone Roll, which was an interesting Spicy Tune and Whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and CHEDDAR CHEESE. I haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.

I do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because I would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.

The alcohol did seem relatively expensive. My buddy had a Sapporo and it was $7 or $8. That almost seems obscene.

On a positive note, Dad is not a huge sushi fan, so he opted for the Teriyaki Chicken Dinner. For $11, hhe had a Miso Soup, a Salad, a bowl of white rice and a HUGE steaming hot plate FULL of chicken teriyaki with hardly any vegetables.

3294145,2010-01-19,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"If you are a sushi snob, hit back on your browser and get a plane ticket to LA at least if not Tokyo. Las Vegas as far as I have seen as two sushi options... Buffet and the type of place you are subsidizing comped high rollers. 

Oyshi is the buffet type. $21 for lunch. $26 for dinner. I did not notice anything different between the two menus. The $5 vig is likely pure the night vig. 

Your options include sushi, rolls and hot dishes. Each is worth a paragraph. 

Sushi. Most AYCE places save $$$ by not offering albacore, ikura, scallops, uni and other such high end items. This is not the case for Oyshi, which makes me wonder where they cut corners. That being said, I believe the sushi is the highlight of the menu. Though the rice is not prepared to sushi standards, the rice portion is fairly small compared to the fish, so this does not take away too much from the bite. The actual fish itself is pretty good considering it is AYCE. Note that each order is a fairly small two pieces, so don't be shy about ordering a lot. Do eat the rice as well, though, as you will be penalized for going no-carbs. 

Rolls. Of the spider, bonsai, ebi ebi and volcano, I only liked the last two. I think the issue here is the sauces are pretty hit and miss. I think that AYCE places try to make their rolls filling, salty and sweet to induce satiation or in the case of bonsai nausea. That roll actually made me heave a little. Don't order too many rolls. It is sort of like how most of the menu is rolls like casinos mostly place slot machines on the casino floor. It's the most profitable. 

Last and definitely least is the appetizer menu. All the meat items suck. The beefs are stringy and sweet sauced up to disguise their cheapness and the chicken is dry. Don't waste gut space. If you wanted a nice surf and turf combo, you should be at a fine steakhouse. I was disappointed, but having a good appetizer menu at an AYCE sushi place would just be a bonus. I think some of the non-meat stuff is fairly safe, such as the miso soup (though don't expect the world). 

Drinks. Didn't sample the alcohol, but you have your usual assortment of sake and beer. Since I was there for lunch and was still tired from the previous night's drive, I passed. Tea is $2.50 in case you wanted to know and is pretty good to share since it is a flat fee for one pot with free hot water refills. 

Though Oyshi is in a strip mall on a nondescript corner of the Vegas suburbs, it wants you to think that you are in Caesar's Palace. Not necessarily a bad thing. 

There are two back rooms to accommodate large groups. Lunch is fairly quiet. I would expect dinner to be loud with the drinking and the karaoke. 

Services is good during lunch. Attentive and even proactive about making sure you order a lot. Nice. 

Overall, it is a good value at $21. This continually justifies my urge to stay away from the Strip for dining. Just don't expect tsukiji quality or anything and enjoy the relatively cheap eats.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,1,0,4,1FxIWCz6DfkTstbjgD8C7g

They have an all you can eat menu that's $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner (I think that's for weekends). I usually stick with that because 2 specialty rolls alone would equal to the price of AYCE. 

I went for a friend's birthday and we shared all kinds of yummy appetizers, this really tasty sake and of course all of our rolls.

Everything was fresh and tasted pretty good. I would suggest the atomic bomb, pretty spicy but really good. I couldn't take a picture fast enough because it was devoured in seconds.

Yes, I am a big fan. I'm not the biggest sushi lover as some people are, but when it's good, it's good. I do believe I've had a wide enough sample of restaurants to know the difference. This place is definitely a place I would recommend. 

The place is cool, kind of a drive from the strip, middle of nowhere strip mall with tumble weed crossings, inside is not TOO fancy, and not TOO much the other kind. But really you don't need to care much, as long as it's clean.

The place is all you can eat, not all you can pay for. More like... You can eat all, for one set price (within two hours). Three of the four pages of the menu are all included for that price. And let me tell you, they had every roll I've ever seen or heard of along with many many more that I haven't. But there are also all the wonderful appetizers like the Rib Eye and Shrimp called ""Surf and Turf"" tucked all the way on the last page at the very end. Ya we ordered about 8 of those. That alone, would probably be worth the price. 

Between the seven of us we ordered more sushi than I could ever imagine. But it wasn't so much about the quantity but the quality was just as impressive. Of the different rolls I did try. I had, not one complaint. They were as good as I've had at any other Sushi restaurant. I'd go into the names and ingredients of the rolls but if you love sushi, and even if you don't just imagine the ones you like and it's probably on the menu.

Service was pretty good considering how many people were eating all you can eat sushi in the restaurant. I really did expect the sushi to come out one every half hour. But I didn't even notice any wait between drinks, appetizers, sushi, more sushi, more appetizers and finally dessert. In fact, upon ordering an extra Miso soup, It seemed like it got to the table before I finished ordering it. They were that fast.

Eating good food releases endorphins in your brain. A good sign that you just had a good meal with good friends is how much everyone is laughing at the end. And there was plenty of that to be had for everyone. The only reason Its not 5 stars, is because I've had some really good Sushi, but I can't order it here because it's usually a Chef Special at the other places.

Oyshi is the best place to go for AYCE mainly because of their appetizer and dessert selections.  

What I love to get are baked mussels and sizzling plates: asian skirt steak and surf and turf.  If you're hungry, these plates aren't shareable, but most of the time they are.  The asian skirt steak has a hint of sweetness to it.  It comes on a bed of lettuce and onions that the cast iron plate cooks.  

The surf and turf is just a few pieces of tenderloin steak with 2 pieces of shrimp also on a bed of lettuce and onions that the cast iron plates cooks.  Very tender steak, and the shrimp was grilled to perfection.  

I like to get nigiris: salmon, garlic tuna, and yellowtail.  All the fish tastes fresh.  The salmon was orange and marbleized as it should be.  You can get your tuna 3 different ways, but garlic is my favorite.  Yellowtail I got plain.  Always a good tasting fish.  

Rolls:  Had a few and they were good, but none of them really caught my attention to be honest.   

Dessert: Vanilla creme brulee.  I had a bite of the green tea creme brulee, and that was good as well.

3372999,2011-09-28,5,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"My oh my what can I say. It was definitely Oishi, even if they did spell it wrong.
I came to vegas to quell the beckoning of the seven deadly sins. And I can safely say I left knowing full well that Gluttony is very satisfied (there's got to be some sort of ironic word play here, but goodness I can never figure it out). Oyshi Sushi has definitely raised the bar for the SoCal AYCE sushi restaurants. I might even say it is comparable to the delicious and the very-missed Kami (RIP)

The SKINNY:
I came with a group of 12. I was one of the last to show up, and I was very surprised at the fact that it could seat 12 people. The usual AYCE sushi ordering paradigm (...i barreled through 4 seasons of The Big Bang Theory) is a check list that is given to the waitress, which will be dropped off at the chef, and eventually you'll be nom-noming your way through delectable bite size raw fish goodness. But here, there is no checklist, you order directly to the waitress. But amazingly almost all orders made by the 12 people were satisfied! This place has amazing service with a very patient staff, and a variety of Nigiri and Rolls that i so deeply yearn for here in california. It's 26 dollars well spent my friends. 

The Food:
Okay so originally we were suppose to go to Sushi Mon, but one thing led to another and we ended up at Oyshi. ""they have a better variety of rolls, and most of our group prefers rolls...."" Hearing it breaks my heart, but the need of the many outweighs the need of the few, so I had to comply. But! hot dam, this place got some unique selections for just the simple nigiri. Spanish Mackerel? Garlic Tuna? Halibut? Seriously, the Koreans owning our local southern california ayce sushi joints needs to take a page of the koreans owning Nevada's ayce sushi joints. I have to say, they were all amazing (with the exception of the cajun albacore. that was just good. But it's still better than bad)
I have to point out the fact that they offer a free order of Amaebi and Uni, AND 4 pcs of raw oysters per customer. Being that most of the people I went with was apprehensive to raw food, I ate more than enough free orders. My goodness, my raw oyster cravings won't start up for at least another month (seriously, it's like a menstrual cycle. I know, i'm disgusting). 
Everybody speaks of how great their rolls are, and sure they are pretty good. But honestly, I can't remember them for the life of me. So maybe they were more forgettable than spectacular. But who cares, give me another 4 pieces of raw oysters dammit! That's what's important here.

The Service: 
Oh poor poor waitress. She had to go through so much...good thing we tipped her generously (and this is coming from a Chiense man). The service is actually spot on, given that there were some dead times where our food arrived a bit slow, but its a minor issue. Afterall, there were probably 5 sushi chefs taking care of a whole restaurant, INCLUDING a party of 12. 

This place is a bit off the Vegas Strip, but who cares, it's all you can eat SUSHI. and It's good! The only reason why you wouldnt come out here is if you said ""Oh i ate too much at the Wynn Buffet already."" And that's barely an excuse.",knlbu-L7DxPPP_mMgFtqxg,4,3,4,hgKVYzbkgsA33_Nem_Pplg

I almost felt like I was in San Francisco. 
I ordered the seaweed salad. It was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. The seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used.
Then i ordered the Hawaiian roll with soy paper. It had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a Cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. Seriously one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had and I consider myself a sushi connoisseur.

I waited to post a review after our second visit because often the first time may not be enough of an experience to grade a restaurant properly. Excellent quality all around, good atmosphere and most importantly the food is prepared consistently which is the main flaw with most restaurants, not just sushi places. Service is very good and everyone seems to help each other deliver orders to the tables. We really like the fact that the fish inside the rolls are actually cool in temperature and not warm like most places we've tried. The sauces are light in flavor and not over powering, which can overwhelm and kill the fish flavor of good quality sushi rolls. My only negative remark would be that for some reason, after our initial order the second order (often our final order) which is probably 1 or 2 rolls it seems to take a while to come out. Also today my wife wore white pants and it seems there was some soy sauce spilled on the seat of the booth and it stained her pants which I noticed when we went shopping afterwards, but no big deal since it would be hard to see that soy sauce was spilled on a black booth cushion. ""We ain't mad at ya"", we will be back for more. We hardly tried the extensive offerings this menu features.

3426810,2010-05-22,1,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"So, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for AYCE sushi, I decided on Oyshi, solely because of the great reviews I saw here on Yelp. 

I looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and I decided to make the trip out. 

We arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a Friday night, so I expected it to be bustling. During our wait to be seated,  I scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. Mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. Well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. It must be set on Pandora or something. Anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. 

So, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. My boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the Oyshi scallops. As for the rolls, I decided on the Sibuya No Rice, Coco, and a Bonsai. I also decided to get the agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, baked mussels and seaweed salad. This was only the first round after all.

We were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. First the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. 

Verdict, 

the garlic tuna was DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. I've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. It even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.

the albacore was seared, and also tasted old. It had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.

the Oyshi scallops I thought were going to be ""OISHI"" but, definitely not. They mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as I tried to pick it up. 

the cajun albacore had TOO MUCH cajun seasoning! I usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was DRY.

my boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. 

on to the rolls,

the Bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but I had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. The roll as a whole was not to my liking.

the Coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.

the Sibuya No Rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.

the appetizers,

the agedashi tofu is usually my favorite appetizer!!! It came out looking as if it were just fried up, and I commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and I hate that it is not ""bite-size"" as most Japanese cuisine is known to be. 

the seaweed salad was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, I've had better, let's just leave it at that.

the grilled beef asparagus was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. The asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.

the baked mussels were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. 

I was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since I knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. I settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, asian style skirt steak, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.

I knew it was bad when I was scarfing down edamame and tempura. The calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more ""asian"" I guess? My boyfriend ate the skirt steak (aka Korean bulgogi, in my opinion). He even commented ""I'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing I would expect to eat at a Sushi restaurant.""

With that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! 

Hm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  We have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco, California, and I wanted to seriously give this place a chance. Unfortunately, Oyshi just did not live up to the hype!

On a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.",voYIq2C9eAAeoQZaSyYQ8Q,2,0,1,MlMyT-twZWssnAa_wDfyhw

The wait to get seated can be gruesome depending on the time of arrival and time of the day. Once seated though service has always been great. Their rolls are fully stuffed so be careful, you can easily get stuffed with just a few. Start out light with a few Appetizers then go in on a roll or two. They do half orders also so that's always the best way to gonif you just want to taste a new roll. Sushi has always been fresh here and I hope it remains that way.

When the owner is not around, the place goes haywire. I will say the quality of food is usually pretty good and when the heavier gentleman is behind the sushi bar, we are treated phenomenally. This is where it ends. There is zero consistency. This evening we arrived around 11:30 PM. There were 6-8 tables seated as well as about 6 people at the sushi bar. We opted to sit at the bar. There were 2 sushi chefs for the entire restaurant so we already assumed the wait time on food would be a bit slow but being that it was so late at night this wasn't a problem. What was a problem was the HORRIBLE service we received. There was a group of what seemed to be off duty employees sitting in the back portion of the bar drinking. The chefs were going over to that side at least every 5 minutes, taking shots and conversing, as tickets sat in front of them. At one point one of the servers had to go through the kitchen and behind the bar to ask a chef for extra sauce. The woman who took our order came back once after 10 minutes and once more after about 25. We placed our order with another server who did not write anything down and alas, forgot 3 of the 4 items we ordered. At this point, visibly bothered, one of the chefs told us to order any sushi through him, which we did. That too was forgotten. We could not even enjoy the $60 dinner we paid for and rushed out of there as to flee a very uncomfortable situation. Unfortunately I think it is time to find a new neighborhood sushi spot as this place clearly allows their employees to run the show which shows in their service.",LEXKyVpF1Utm6eJOsQIz8A,0,0,2,SmdGotTeAI3a9MwIoM33ow

The quality of fish is decent, they don't give you a lot of rice on the sushi which is good because that is a total filler when it comes to AYCE sushi.  The price is pretty good, its under $30/person for dinner.

The service here was good, they check-in on us often, but were not overbearing.  The only thing that sucked was at the tables, they don't offer the half rolls.  It's only available at the sushi bar.  So, if you want half rolls, request to sit at the sushi bar.

There wasn't anything that really stood out.  They have specials written on the chalk board in the front.  When we were there, they had a pork belly appetizer, which tasty good.  Nice and fatty, but it was a little chewy for my taste.

I am a patient man. My girlfriend and I work in the service industry. My girl even works at a sushi place. This is literally the worst service I have ever encountered. 

Sat down for Ayce lunch at 1:30.. Our first order of Nigiri hadn't came out, it was now 1:55. We didn't order anything special, just slice the fish and send it out. We ask the server about our order. She abruptly leaves, and I can see the sushi chef and the server arguing with each other.

She then advised us that she forgot to put the order in. I thought, ok.. Cool. The world isn't a perfect place, and we all make mistakes... But when we make a mistake, a good server should hurry to correct it and make it right. 

Waited 20 min... low and behold, she forgot to put the order in a second time. It has now been 45 min since I ordered the Nigiri.. No exaggeration. By this time I've lost my appetite. The restaurant isn't even busy, the place was half full.

I felt disgusted paying the $47 plus $10 tip.. I tipped 20 percent just because I'm in the tipping industry, and don't have the heart to stiff this chick. She also told me they don't do half rolls. I could have sworn they did before.

The only exception is sashimi.  Each of the rolls off the menu ranges from $12-15/per roll so I think the all you can eat is worth it if you've worked up an appetite.

I love doing AYCE because as long as you eat about 3 rolls, you're getting your money's worth. Plus, it is fun to share delicious food! Make sure you're only sharing with those in your group that are getting AYCE or else they will get charged the AYCE price as well. They have an extensive rules/information outline on their menu.

I think that the service here is really great for them being busy ALL of the time. They were always coming back to check up on us and asked if we wanted to put in more orders. Our tables were never cluttered because different people would swing by and grab our empty plates, plus everyone was more than helpful when we needed anything.

My go-to rolls: MONSTER ROLL: ORDER IT, JUST ORDER IT! Pink Lady Roll. Spider Roll. Dragon Roll. Japanese Lasagna Roll. I need to try even more of their specialty rolls, I am guilt of sticking to my favorites! For appetizers, order the baked green mussels, they're amazing here. Only a few sushi joints can get it right, trust me.

If you know me, then you know that I LOVE white tuna nigiri/sushi. The first time I had it here, it was amazing. The second time was decent. Haha, hopefully it just keeps getting better because I order a lot of those wherever I go for sushi. 

For dessert, order the Green Tea Tiramisu with vanilla ice cream on the side. Your mouth will thank me, lol.

I will definitely be back!",E5xx_Z_kMAlzbIS72zY8Hw,4,4,4,siyDucKb4cPoFaGzcbxSqA

What is the first thing you do before the sushi gets to your table? You pour soy on that little plate, but the last thing you expect is a dead fly to come out of there! 

Now the fly is not the big problem, the problem was the waitress, instead of apologizing for the mishap she immediately started making excuses of how the fly's get into the restaurant ... I had to interrupt her by telling her to just change the set up. 

When the bill came, no attempt to apologize for that nasty surprise was made nether verbally or physically on the bill.

Not only that but the food came out extra fast, usually at the AYCE sushi spots that I go to in the LA/OC area the food kinda lags, maybe because they want you to get full and not order more? Just an assumption :P

- Oysters (limit one order (4 pieces) per person during dinner only)

- Sushi
- Hand Rolls

Unfortunately this place was just that. Two stars for subpar sushi. I do think they deserve an additional star for the amount of appetites they offer as part of the AYCE deal.

probably one of the best all-you-can-eat sushi places I have ever ate!
the only down side is its a bit pricey!! 21 for lunch &amp; 26 for dinner.
but you get what you pay for! everything is made &amp; comes out fresh once you order it!

-miso soup
delicious! wasnt salty at all! :)

-eel/avocado roll
not a big fish person...but i have to admit was good! the eel overpowered the avocado for sure.

-salmon with rice 
i dont eat raw fish or anything..but i had half of one piece and it wasnt bad at all!! it looked and tasted fresh! im sure all you salmon lovers would enjoy this very much.

-love affair
shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster with crunch flakes &amp; masago!! this was my favorite roll of the night! I finished the majority of the plate!! 

-crunch scallop
yummy!! taste had a sweetness to it and this was my second fav of the night.

-beef asparagus
delicious!! loved this and i would have eaten more if i wasnt so stuffed!! one of my favorites. simple but great!

-rib eye steak teriyaki
steak was tender!

-asian skirt steak
steak was tender and could taste the ginger like crazy in this dish! in fact, you can taste all the ingredients they used to make this dish, but the ginger enhances a bit.

-agedashi tofu
lightly fried soft tofu in green onion soy sauce! really light and it was phenomenol. I dont think you can ever ruin this dish.

-green tiramisu
sucked!!! never order this.

We went with a good sized party and reservations. Got placed in a side room. The decor is solid but nothing spectacular. The party, with the exception of one tactically frugal individual all went All You Can Eat (AYCE).

Two things:
1) The sushi was great. Fresh, well put together, largelly plated well and highly satisfactory. Nothing mind blowing, but great stuff.

2) They brought it out seemingly at random. We'd not get rolls we ordered and get other rolls instead, no explanation. The waitress was reading our requests back and she appeared to be writing them down, but the correlation between food requested and food delivered was .71 tops.

Bizarre Food Fail: Surf and Turf was ordered. Turf and Turf was delivered. Apparently the shrimp staged a daring escape.

I will return here, but largelly because it's five minutes away and my friends have low standards.",H7fr4A3OlKtDr-sNn8BIlw,0,0,3,YkShJxiJLAodLcwgJw6mbQ

Food porn at Oyshi. Yessiree, four hungry men and a AYCE Japanese food? This is gonna get ugly fast, real fast. We get there and it's packed. A nice waiter greeted us and told us it might be a while. 20 minutes. Shit, thats it? His reaction made it seem like an hour or 2. Dude! We'll wait. 

The restaurant is nicely designed with modern furnishings. Its set to look very relaxing like a lounge. Like Gerald S pointed out, it's not set up well if there's large groups. The good side is that it doesn't feel overcrowded. 

The AYCE is probably the best and only way to go here. There are so many items to choose from and the quality was not as bad as I thought it would be. They do limit the expensive stuff like uni, amaebi, and raw oysters, but it was well worth it. The sushi was very well made and fresh. Their sushi cuts are very generous. They hardly give any rice, so it was perfect. Everything was awesome, from the salmon, tempura, ribeye, and unlimited green tea or vanilla ice cream!!! 

Like hawks, we swooped down and attacked everything. Nothing was safe. We washed it all down with hot house sake ($7). For $25, I would do it over, and over, and over, and over, *deep breath*, and over again. The food came out slow, it was expected because they  had a full house. The service was simply awesome. If it's a Friday or Saturday, give them a call to make reservations. We left hurting and sat in our car like beached whales. 

You may have defeated us Oyshi, but we'll be back. Back with bigger and hungrier guys. *waives fist*",TA86D8aHueRu1tIag_lK2Q,7,4,5,r0gD39in3U2hall3MK5Whw

I'll start off by saying I read a few reviews below and have to agree with something many have said and that is that you tend to have to wait a bit to get your orders in and then get served due to how busy the place is. My advice come early or come late ;) there open until 2 am Fridays and Saturdays.

We both got the AYCE deal; I think the bill came out to $64 for that and the two cokes. The sushi was fresh and very flavorful. The sauces were amazing. We had the simply shrimp roll (my favorite of the night), a deep fried spicy tuna roll and a few others. I tried something new for me and that was a tuna roll with scallions, which was a more fatty part of the tuna, more subtle and slightly fishier flavor that she did not enjoy, but I did. We finished off with a roll that had garlic sauce and wow that was seriously garlic flavored, so if you are not that into garlic, stay away from anything with garlic sauce. lol

The wait staff was nice, but again it was so busy they were all over the place and we tended to wait longer then I feel we or the other customers should have.

The place was ok and worth checking out if, you are in the area, but if you live across town like me it may not be worth the trip.",8-OX2_HEYDbArnMSDyJe5g,3,0,3,z-TW38R79RE0nkrORx2_Cg

I suggest sticking to the nigiri rolls, or the traditional sushi rolls. None of that spicy tuna stuff, or anything with cheese in it. Traditional is the way to go. We ordered two rolls that were non-traditional, and we found that to be a very bad idea. On the other hand, tuna and salmon were not fresh the day we went (salmon was more fresh, but still...).

My favorite thing on the menu that night were the ama ebi (sweet raw shrimp). They were probably one of the freshest items on the menu. For this alone, they get another star because it was unique. I've never had this before at another restaurant.

Oh, am I ever glad we decided to try a new place today! Oyshi is great, $21 AYCE lunch with a huge selection to choose from. We sat at the bar and had almost impeccable service. We did to request plates (they did not bring them out with the wasabi) but everyone that helped us was so pleasant and upbeat, and our drinks were refilled without us ever having to flag someone down. Our check was also brought out before we requested it, which I always appreciate when I am on my lunch break. 

We started out with some edamame, which is serves warm with a sprinkling of salt. We also tried the beef wrapped asparagus because a reviewer recommended it. It was ok, but I was there to eat fish not beef... so it was on to the rolls. We tried the Red Rock, a new roll called the Sexy something-or-other, Baked Philadelphia Roll and the Japanese Lasagna. All were very tasty. Some people may be turned off by the amount of sauce put on the rolls but I personally liked it. Rolls that come with sauces on top say so on the menu so if that's not your style, just ask the sushi chef to leave it off! 

For desert we had the green tea tiramisu and the berry parfait. The blueberries on the parfait were still crunchy from being frozen, and the tiramisu wasn't really as good as I had hoped. But I was so stuffed from the sushi it's probably better for my figure that the deserts weren't to die for!

4108196,2013-10-29,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Finally got the chance to sample this southwestern sushi spot.

Restaurant design: very modern. Comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own TV, huge counters at the bar. One of the largest interiors I've seen. The only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. Luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.

Service: consistent pacing throughout the night. Could be because we were the lounge table, but I'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.

Picks:

Nigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. The spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. Smoked salmon special here is superior to Goyemon's special. Uni is the best quality other than when I tried Kaze's AYCE sashimi lunch. There were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though.
Oysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me
Baked mussels: solid
Fried calamari: fine
Lasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality
Parfait: really, really good. Fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. Glad I made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.

Passable:

Dynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off.
Surf n Turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. Not bad, but not great.
Hot sake: average, I suppose. Best part was that it was a Mon/Tues 2-for-1 special.

Pans:

Popcorn scallop: pretty useless.
Amaebi head: brain drained. I feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). Would've liked all off the flavors to be there.
Ice cream: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals

Overall, I enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. It's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. I'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,0,4,6d_y4EYw3zm05Tq6k2BzPQ

The AYCE not only includes various sushi rolls, but also includes various items such as steaks, mussels, sweet shrimp, some nagiri choices, and dessert.
 
My Top Picks for AYCE:

-Kamikaze Roll
-Tiger Roll
-Rainbow Roll
-Rib Eye Steak (comes out sizzling on a hot plate about 6-8 oz)
-Mussels (2 comes in every order)
-Vanilla Berry Parfait
 
Oyshi also has a normal non-sushi menu such as teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, and a beef bowl, if you ever have any non-sushi diners in your group.  The service there is decent, some servers are friendly some are not.  I've never had a problem with trying to get a table here.

Located in Enterprise, I was a little skeptical about this place because it's centered within a weird strip mall that had a veternarian's office, Dairy Queen, and a Korean nail salon nearby. Whatever. That don't mean SHIT when it comes to delicious sushi.

With a great all-you-can-eat dinner price and the craziest variety of rolls to choose from, I don't see how you would NOT enjoy your sushi-licious dinner here.

Even though we were only in Vegas for 5 days, we managed to eat here TWICE because we were like ""EFF THE STRIP!"" and wanted to eat to our stomachs' content without the glare of neon lights.

The sushi was outstanding and the All You Can Eat menu was expansive.

The service was terrible. There were many servers there on a Monday night and the place wasn't super busy. They kept forgetting about us and not once did anyone ask if everything was ok. We did the AYCE deal and after I finished a roll it would be like, 15 minutes before anyone asked for our next order. A few times we had to pester the bus boys to get our server because they were the only staff that was coming around. I saw the server at the table next to us check on them twice before anyone came to us even once. I understand if it's crazy busy and people are ordering sushi like it's going out of style, but I kept looking up at the servers standing around at the bar doing nothing but looking confused. Maybe they didn't know who had our table, I don't know. After we were done with our dessert we just sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our check. Again, we had to literally get up out of our seats to find someone.

Any time I've done AYCE at other places, even busier places like Goyemon, the service has been fine. This was bad service to the point of being extreme.

We got here on a Saturday around 6 pm. Fairly busy but not packed. A lot of new faces, but David remembered us as well as the manager that runs the floor (not sure of his name). It felt pretty good to be remembered and it made the meal better! I cannot eat sushi right now, but everything looked fresh. My husband said it was good, but he didn't want to rub it in my face that I cannot eat raw sushi. Oyshi has always been on par with their fish and it definitely seemed that way on Saturday. 

I was able to order items from the kitchen luckily since they have a wide variety of cooked items. Calamari is good with their 2 different dipping sauces and as was their gyozas. I can't remember what else I ordered, but everything was fairly good.

Our initial order took quite a while - it did not all come out at once which is understandable, but I've definitely eaten at other places that don't have as many chefs that was much faster. 

Anyway, the first round was all nigiri - the first half came out great! Fish was fresh, rice portions under them were very reasonable. When the second half of the nigiri order came out.. The ENTIRE PLATE was drowned in ponzu sauce.. Gross. This is a big no-no, the rice was so drenched in this sauce that it couldn't even be picked up without the rice falling apart. For this I am docking a star.

I then decided to order some of their appetizer fresh oysters (to wash the disgusting ponzu sauce out of my mouth). They came out promptly and we're definitely fresh. They came out with a little bit of a pico de gallo type salsa on them and already had hot sauce on it.  The oysters were very clean and shucked properly - an observation I did have was that the oyster itself was almost tasteless - as in, no Oceany taste - perhaps they were farmed oysters if that's a thing.  (We paid dinner price to get in on these and the uni/sweet shrimp during lunch hour, definitely worth the extra $5pp if you eat these)

Also tried the lobster fair and spider roll - the spider roll was kind of bland and the lobster fair was a California roll with crab salad burnt on top - I would not order either one of those again. 

The wife got green tea tiramisu and green tea creme brûlée. I sampled both and they were quite delicious.

Service was ok, our waitress must have ended her shift while we were half way through eating but the other servers were all willing to help.

In summary, not a bad AYCE sushi joint - but make sure you tell them to hold that ponzu sauce if it's not your thing.  Also choose your rolls carefully if you order any - I won't order rolls from there anymore but would definitely eat there again.",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,1,2,4,3PgZoVjTHHXGTXSCROgcig

Agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, and their skirt steak are some of my favorite sides. I like their Oyshi roll, love affair, and volcano roll (ask for them to make it with the garlic yum yum). It's a cute place and usually not much of a wait. And they have great desserts. The parfait and creme brûlée are very good.

4346420,2009-09-01,1,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"The best sushi place in Vegas, and it's all-you-can eat.

It's been theorized by our mother that my brother and I have tapeworms with the amount of food we devour on a daily basis. With the amount of sushi we ate tonight, this could be true. Lunch is cheaper at $21 per person but I'm sure there are less things to order. We came for the all-you-can eat dinner ($26 per person) and ordered:

- yellowtail
- salmon
- tuna
- mackerel
- uni (sea urchin)
- oysters (limit 4 per person)
- red rock roll
- dynamite roll
- favorite roll
- and like, six other rolls.

The bottom line is that all the fish is fresh, the service is prompt and friendly, but the food can take a while to come out when they're busy (especially since it's an all you can eat place and there's a ton of things to make) so after your first order comes, order again immediately before you finish to insure it gets there on time. 

There is a 2 hour limit for the all you can eat option but I didn't have any issues with it. Most sushi places have this rule as a safety cushion for those rude customers who don't know any better and camp out in the restaurant for hours as if it were their last meal.

The decor is industrial Asian with exposed pipes, bricks, dim lighting, and colorful murals. It's a snazzy place in an unassuming location, but I'd totally take a date here.

With tip and tax, it came out to around $65 for two and that's including drinks and after devouring half the Pacific Ocean. We will be back with the whole family.",dJtFy2jc1R5cSBab4BLORQ,1,1,5,BwKfoWvRrOH15X9cnVHrAw

Our most recent visit here was a group of 8 and it was terrible. Our server was slow in taking our orders, and also kept messing up. Our orders were either incorrect in terms of quantity and selection, or they didn't arrive at all. The quality of the sushi was average. They didn't have enough teapots (we ordered hot green tea) so we had to WAIT for one to become available. Really.

They added on the automatic group tip that is typical with parties of 8+. What was suprising was that it was for 20% of the bill. We were so anxious to be done with that place, we didn't even bother bringing it up. And just to put things in perspective, our bill listed we ordered 12 items for a group of 8.  So that should tell you we were in no way high maintenance. I cannot stress how terrible the service was. This should not be acceptable, especially in a town that has a ton of sushi restaurants.

5 Star rating for sure, here's why:
Came here after a 3 hour trip from Los Angeles. Arrived around 4pm, with a group of 12. Was seated promptly in the back private room. Drinks were served quickly, left us with a large jug of ice water= awesome. Waiter was very polite and patient with our large group of guys. We all ordered different rolls and shared them. Each roll was delicious. Presentation, taste and size of content to each roll was perfect. I remember getting the Rattle snake, Heart attack, Lobster fare,  shrimp tempura, miso soup, fried scallops, warm saki and calamari. Absolutely no complaints of any item ordered.  Best, made to eat, all you can eat eat (AYCE) sushi joint ever. 

Caution: Do not over order!! Take your time and enjoy each item is my advice. After your first roll you will want to go berzerk and order everything on the menu, trust me just enjoy and order what you can finish. You may feel pressured by the two hour time limit, but don't worry you will have plenty of time and the food is served pretty quickly.",7ywB3U7tzpe6L3v1-bUviw,1,0,5,yVerWFt-5HfQyvX1Qc34UQ

I wish the prices dropped to be more comparable to other sushi spots in the area but all one can do is hope. AYCE is the safest bet for a dinner out with a table for two or more. You ensure no one will need to wash dishes in the back if they get carried away with indulging. We all have those dinner friends who have the mindset of caviar budgets but the reality of dollar-value-menu wallets. 

Service is usually a hit or miss. I've gotten service that has made me not want to leave. On the other hand I've experienced servers at this establishment that made me want to request take-out. (which they do offer). 

The draw back for this place is they don't do half orders like other spots. It's also nowhere near the strip. Which is a catch-22. The wait can be timely depending on the day of the week. If it were closer to the strip it would be an endless wait.

Okay, if this obnoxious review cannot convince you to try it out, then perhaps all the other positive ones will! 

Thanks to Yelp!, my friends took us here several months ago and the eight of us who went loved it! It seriously beat all the sushi-buffets I have ever been to. The sushi buffet menu is comprehensive! Every type of roll you can think of, Maki sushi, miso-soup, wakame salad(!!!), etc. etc. It even features menu items that even non-sushi lovers would enjoy -- tons of appetizers, surf and turf steak and shrimp, terayiki, tempura, etc. It comes with free tea, and a free dessert after your meal. And it's less expensive than a Vegas buffet! 

Totally worth it!! I went again a second time and introduced it to a new group and it did not disappoint. 

The only gripe I have is they have a rule that you have to eat most of the rice or there will be a surcharge. Only a slight bummer, but I cannot blame them. It is still a very fabulous place worth spending the $$$ you earned gambling!!!",kkTSGJP_8Iq9kkm-kmsKVw,1,1,5,v4XX6uLtE9OYBwoghfvGug

Sadly Oyshi had NONE of these qualities.  First of all the hostess Kassidy was the rudest restaurant host I have ever encountered. We got there at 5:45 pm on Tuesday.  There were 12 open seats at the bar and many open tables.  She said there was a wait because there were not enough servers for any more guests and the next server comes at 6pm.  So we said we would wait till 6.  At the appointed time, she escorted us to the very end of the bar where there was no visibility of the fish cases or the chefs and there were 10 empty prime seats in the center of the bar.  Really?  When we questioned her, she rudely said, ""I don't make the rules, the bar for servers is split in 2""   So the rules are  give the first guests to arrive for the evening the worst possible seat????  She reluctantly moved us and stomped away in a huff.  The server was only slightly more friendly.  Oh and guess what, you can't speak to the chefs.  You have to order through the server who only comes around rarely.  We decided to order a la cart instead of all you can eat because we prefer cut fish.   

Unfortunately the albacore fish was gross and mealy and we had to send it back.  My poor husband ate a couple of pieces of it and paid the price this morning.  The other fish plates were cut thick and not refined.  Most of the fish is pre-cut in the case making it dry out.  I ordered a grilled hamachi kamma, (cheek) and was told it would take 20 minutes.  Well no wonder it came out overcooked and dry because it probably only needs to broil 5 minutes.  They also covered it in masago eggs which i hate and I had ask to have them removed.  The rolls had the TINIEST cut piece of fish I've ever gotten in a roll.   I asked for seared tuna nigiri and got the wrong order.   I also ordered eel nigiri and it was grilled eel but COLD,  so they also grill that ahead of time and serve it cold,  YUCK.  Its the fresh warm juicy eel that makes it good.  The ""rice"" under the nigiri was I'm not sure what.  It was not whole kernels of rice but some kind of rice paste.  I could not find one kernel of rice in it.  It tasted fishy and gross like rice pulp, elmers glue and fish water mushed up.  It was not edible.  

At the end of our meal, the waiting area was full but there were 6 empty tables.  The hostess takes great pride in her little power of NOT SEATING guests.  I wanted to tell them RUN!  and save your money and your tummy.  Her bad attitude definitely sets off the experience to be bad. I have no idea how this place is popular when the only decent thing we ate was the edamame.  

We only went here because our favorite place had no seating from being so full on a tuesday night at 5:30 pm.  Next time we will make reservations at our normal place and spare ourselves from this bad treatment and bad food.

The food comes two ways - ALL YOU CAN EAT or ala carte. I opted for the more modest ala option as I am flying solo.  The food tastes fresh, the presentation lovely, and the delivery onto the plate quite speedy.  My only complaint about the food was that the rolls are packed very tightly...loose rolls aren't awesome.  I can understand how an AYCE would require trading speed for firmness but would rather have the firmness especially via ala carte ordering.

My total came to $8.65 which seemed reasonable for two basic sushi rolls (salmon and spicy tuna) 
What I received was literally 4 bites (see photo)
So disappointed!
Went back in to ask the girl in front if there had been a mix up. She informed me that i ordered off the ""nigiri menu"" 
It was the menu she handed me and said sushi on the top -_-

That being said, the two stars are for the salmon ""nigiri"" which was a tasty two bites, and the ponzu sauce

It was alot of food for just the kids, my boyfriend and I ended up eating the left overs and we were stuffed.. it was definetly worth $6 each for the kids meal excluding the bowls of rice.

I've also taken many friends here to eat who didn't like sushi because their AYCE menu is filled with so many items. It gives people a chance to ease into sushi places if it's not their favorite thing to eat.

Two items that I highly recommend are Lobster fair and Love affair. Just so darn yummy. lobster fair is a California roll with baked lobster yumminess on top. Love affair is a STR with baked crab meat yumminess on top. Both just melt in your mouth.

Also love the different desserts they have. Anything from green tea ice cream to mochi to cream brûlée. Again, so many different options.

The cuts of fish were smaller than I am used to. So taking portion size into account, the a la carte pricing is fair. Which leads to this point: I think that part of the draw of this place is that they have an ""AYCE"" (All-You-Can-Eat) menu. The AYCE price is equivalent to what I paid for my a la carte meal (as described below).

As for my experience, I ordered: miso soup with clams; a California roll; tuna sushi, salmon sushi, Cajun tuna sushi, and halibut sushi. These are standard items, and I felt it would provide me with good gauge of the quality of their fish. The quality of the fish was very good.

Oyshi is a wonderful neighborhood sushi restaurant. It's not a very big place, so be prepared to wait for a table, especially at dinner time!

Oyshi is our favorite AYCE restaurant.
Lunch is $22, and dinner is $27 for ages 12 and over.  Lunch $16, dinner $19 for under 12.
Beverage is not included in the price.
Be aware that party of 6 or more an 18% gratuity will be automatically added to the bill.

I almost always order the Miso soup. It's very light on flavor but very comforting to eat.
The Fresh Oysters are very fresh, served with refreshing salsa! Only 2 pieces per person in the AYCE dinner only! At lunch they charge dinner price for them.
You can order unlimited items from the appetizers.
Love their Baked Oysters! Easy to pick from the shells because they are separated and halfway cut.
The Shrimp Tempura is lightly covered and not grease, served with dipping sauce.
My newest discovery is the Yakitori (2 skewers per order). I love the Shrimp and asparagus! Seriously, I can eat a whole plate of that!
My other favorite item is the Japanese Lasagna.
I make sure to order it all the time. I believe Oyshi makes them the best!
Everyone's favorite is the Monster! Spider roll with shrimp tempura, topped with baked eel and avocado, with eel sauce.
Bonsai: spicy tuna roll with Cajun albacore and avocado on top.
Sexy: yum-yum scallop, cream cheese and crunch flakes inside, topped with eel tempura, with wasabi mango and eel sauce.
My BF really likes the Crunch Scallop: Oyshi scallop, crab mix and avocado with popcorn scallops on top, with wasabi mango and eel sauce.

After eating all these food, I always wonder, how much more a person can eat? Well, we always get dessert, too! My absolute favorite is the Mango Mochi (ice cream wrapped in rice dough).
The Green Tiramisu is very tempting, too!
I really liked the green tea flavor in it! It's a house made tiramisu cake infused with green tea.
My daughter's favorite is the Vanilla or Green tea ice cream.

Service is always very attentive! Our iced tea is always refilled!

We loved pretty much every thing that we ordered. Now like all the all you can eat places in Vegas you can order sashimi but only as sushi and they make you eat everything.  Still at 25 dollars a person and 20 for kids it was well worth what we paid.

If there was one negative it was that at such a small place they still added 18% gratuity onto the bill. I would have tipped much more than that if they didn't add it.

We really loved the Lobster Fair and the Las Vegas Roll. Especially the Las Vegas since it didn't have any rice.

First off I'm a manager at a retail store and customer service is a must!! So from the jump I should of know to leave and let me tell you why, it was a busy night for them obviously being a Saturday night which is totally understandable but after i proceed to put my name down,  I headed to the bathroom while in the bathroom i found myself having to listen to one of the front hostess in the bathroom on the phone cussing, crying, saying how she hates her job and the manager and so on and so on... sad part is after i came out the stall the young girl (she was the short dark hair fake lashes and could of been Mexican but look like she had some Asian in her)  just looked at me while continuing her rant. So feeling uncomfortable i went to the front to ask for the manager and just my luck she had walked up, i told her about the incident and she said she would go see the situation and figure out who the employee in the bathroom was. After that happen we were told 45min wait time which turned in to more than an hour wait again understand its busy just make sure you are telling customer the right wait times then. So as we waited to be seated the ball of sunshine aka the girl that hates her job was the one to seat us which again her attitude came out..... while she just turned from the desk and looked at me and said You can come this way with the rudest tone and attitude.. last time i checked most places call you by name or greet you by your name before taking you back to the table. But of course not her. Then as the food started coming out the quality was horrible, sushi taste old and fishy, not worth the price they are charging. So needless to say i will not be returning here anytime soon and i hope the owner or someone higher up see this because even after the manager knew the hostess had an attitude and everyone could tell she did, the manager should of pulled her aside and talked to her or sent her home especially being the first person your customers interact with, i wouldn't think that is the type of person you would want as a hostess.",EMMBLzKlVraB35kbdAeLWA,0,0,1,iJoHHBHA3F1lu53W01tN1g

I gotta say that I have eaten AYCE in many places and in many states, and this by far is rated at the bottom of my list.  The only reason for 2 stars is good service from the waiter, and good green tea ice cream.  Sometimes the ice cream can be a turnoff too, but not here.  The fish was horribly fishy and tasted old.  I grew up on an island and know fish pretty well...this fish thumbs down.  I had tuna, salmon, octopus, albacore, and the treasure.  I had to choke it down.  Under normal circumstances, I would have 3-4 rolls, and about 10 orders of nigiri, with sides of apps.

I have been here on numerous occasions because this is where my friends want to go; ok, whatever.  We always come for AYCE dinner and the wait is always really long even with reservations. 

Once we are seated, it usually takes them a couple minutes to get our drinks and then a while long for our orders. We are so aware of their efficiency, or lack thereof, we would write down on a piece of paper of what we want and then just hand it to them. Kudos to us! 

The food would always take forever to arrive and the hot dishes are always what come out first. I never understand that since raw fish simply needs to be sliced and plated... Unless they wanna fill us up with the cheap stuff first...? Hmmmmmmm. 

And once the food arrives, they are always subpar or mediocre. Nothing ever wows my husband and I. 

Overall, service is extremely slow. This should be a french japanese fusion restaurant in the sense that it's gonna be a three hour meal eating japanese food. The food is mediocre. The price is not spectacular. I would never come back if I can help it. 

Oh, it's the same slowness at lunch, by the way. Most items on the menu is around $10-$12. The non sushi dishes came out first for my group today and halfway through their meal, my sushi bowl came out - mediocre yet again.

Next time, I won't order this roll unless I have 2 or 3 people to split it with. Anyway, the reason I reduced one star on this trip is that the sushi wasn't as fresh as my previous trip there.

Mochi- tasted like it came straight from sams club.. its filled with sugary nasty goup instead of ice cream.

Ribeye-the beef is most definitely the worst cut of beef you can buy..  indistinguishable from wal mart beef no flavor.. no fat.. terrible thick cuts.. what the hell are they serving it for.. but beef that you would use with teriyaki or take it off the menu.. its not Ribeye!

all the crab is fake.. which is typical for sushi places but this imitation crab again tasted like sams club crap.. 

Tuna.. i don't know what is up with that tuna but I've had a lot of sushi and this tuna tasted like it had been frozen thawed, frozen, thawed, frozen and thawed.. thats the only way i can describe the taste and texture... plus the poke..

Poke isnt really poke.. there was 3 pieces of tuna in it.. rest was seaweed, and cucumber... don't call it poke.. i love poke.. i came here because i was told the poke is great... this was not poke.. and if it was it was the worst poke I've ever had.

the foods always been consistent every time i've come back. im not too big on the rolls (although there are a few i like). i get my fill on the hot items and appetizer items. they've added salad bowls and rice bowls as well.

favorites: poke, seaweed salad, oysters (dinner only), ribeye (its not a complete meal if i dont order at least 5 orders for myself), hamachi, salmon, and a few others. 

i only rated a 4 because service is never consistent. we sat at the bar one night, and had excellent service from our server (again, the name escapes me. i should really write these down!). another time, a group of maybe 9 or 10 of us went in for lunch, and if i remember right they were short handed at the sushi bar. hot food items came out before rolls did, and half of our groups didnt come out until the end of the meal (after asking servers several times about our food. the disappointing part was the table next to us got their food way before we did, and they sat well into half of our meal).

not sure why but the meal i had last night seemed to be better than my other visits. maybe because i didn't over order this time which i tend to do.

btw you may be wondering why i keep coming back here if i'm so unhappy with the service... it's because it's so close to where i stay.. and my friends like it and good company makes everything better.

so last night we started with some appetizers while we waited for a couple other friends to arrive. once they came we ordered rolls.. then continued with nigiri.. and finished off with dessert. a few appetizers were thrown in here and there.. and this strategy definitely worked.

stars of the night:

house salad: i really liked their dressing.. it was kinda a peanut ginger-y dressing. super refreshing and a decent size. it can definitely be shared

baked green mussels: not too fishy tasting and the sauce on top is super creamy and delicious

oysters: max order is 1 per person which comes with 4 oysters... tasty! 

sexy roll: i believe it has fried unagi on top with yum yum scallops inside and a creamy mango sauce on top... my favorite of the night.

agedashi tofu: their version is really tasty. the tofu itself stays crisp on the outside even after its been sitting there for a few minutes.. and the sauce is perfect.. not bland at all

premium spider roll: with avocado and cream cheese and possibly unagi on top. cant remember but it was deeeelicious!

service was ok in the beginning but really began to slow down as it got busy. we were seated in the area sectioned off to the side so it was easy to forget about us.. and we sure felt forgotten at times. 

as for dessert they were out of mochi the last time we were there.. this time they didnt have the strawberry. ooo my friends were super disappointed :(

She immediately said ""can I put you at the table in the middle"".........wow!!!!!!!! Pull the sushi out of your ears and think about what I asked for.
Then she proceeded to tell me once I was seated ""it's ok THIs TIME since we aren't that busy, normally it wouldn't be""-  I told her frankly- ""well I'm a veteran with PTSD so thank you for the exception""........

1.  Service - 5 Stars - This place rocks with service. This is a key at the AYCE places as I think that they will automatically ""pace"" you with the limited staff and service. However, here, we had numerous people helping, providing us food, taking orders for additions and even the manager or owner (didn't get his name) came out to help.  Very, very nice.

2.  Ambiance - 5 Stars - I was kinda irritated as to why my pals were asking to meet way out here in the middle of where, and it was not a disappointment at all. The table set up is great, nice waiting area, very comfortable flow.  I felt very, very relaxed here and not rushed at all.....

3.  Food Quality - We ordered some real sushi like Amai Ebi with the fried shrimp heads and they were tasty. The Uni or sea Urchin was very flavorful and the texture was spot on.  Then, we had a bunch of westernized sushi that my pals ordered and while I cannot tell you what was in them and the conglomeration of sauces that hid the fish taste, I can tell you that as a food group, this stuff was pretty darn good. I wouldn't call it sushi, I would call it ""chop suey sushi"".  I give the food quality 4 stars.

4.  Pricing - For AYCE, the price is not bad 21 / 26 per person depending on lunch or dinner.  Many of my favorites don't qualify for AYCE, so I will be going back to clarify this as I did not pay this bill, and so I am not 100% positive. However, in reading the bill, the more traditional and higher quality stuff was not included.  I will check this as I may be wrong.  For now, I give this 4 star.

4974850,2010-01-25,1,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Yeah, the Husband and I are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  But when you're living in Vegas, the only way to go is to do AYCE, right?  After getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.

All-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.

Like Ned M. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  Perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.

We ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  As one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  Maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  I'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.  

They do offer a wider selection of side items like Asian style skirt steak, ribeye steak teriyaki, etc.  And for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other AYCE places.  I do like their version of agadashi tofu though.

Limitations on their menu include:
* one order of uni and amaebi per person
* limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person
* limit one order on desserts of creme brulee, mochi ice cream, berry parfait or green tea tiramisu (regular ice cream is AYCE though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)

Sitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  The manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  We thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  He continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  There was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.

I can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  The staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  They have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  Overall, we found Oyshi Sushi to be an average place for AYCE sushi.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,12,7,3,YUvh4NIQB1ahkK6mZuXoHQ

Yes two hours for one of the cheapest all you can eat sushi I've seen in Las Vegas myself. Some will say that service of the sushi is a tad slow but hey you get two hours. Who likes to be rushed when eating anyways? I enjoy food so I would like to enjoy it at a nice pace thank you.
If your with great company that gives some extra time for some intellectual exchange of words (conversation). Plus the two hours give enough time to let the rice settle a bit and enough time to try a good portion of the menu.

The service might be a tad slow but the workers are always pleasant. I actually feel like I'm wanted there.. not like that other Asian restaurants..
They also are very knowledgeable with the menu which leads to great sushi suggestions.

The sushi at Oyshi I say is the best I've had in Las Vegas!

They had many rolls to choose from and they also had yakitori dishes(bacon wrapped asparagus, steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops), poke salads(delicious), poke bowls, oysters, mussels.. There was a great selection.  Since we had a big party, our order took some time and some got missed but the servers were more than helpful and they made sure we got everything we wanted.  After our meals they also had parfait, mochi, and tiramisu for dessert..I would definitely be coming back..Only downer is that it is pretty far from the strip if you don't have a car, its about a $30 cab ride, but if you split it, its not so bad.  After 2 hours of stuffing our faces and many bottles of sake, we left stuffed and satisfied and it only came out to $40 a person!

5042303,2013-09-11,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Random nights with good friends are always a blast!  I've always said it.  Spontaneity really makes the activity better!  So when I was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, I knew it was going to be fun.  We settled on a place one of us raved about.  I've been to Soyo restaurant many times but never Oyshi.  Time to Yelp!

The only down side of this place is the location.  I live across town from here.  Oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  First, you have one of my favorite Korean joints.  Now you have my favorite fried rice joint, Rice Trax.  This location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  Although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  Love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  Our service was pretty good.  Multiple servers came by our table at most times.  It was enjoyable. 

For dinner at a sushi joint in Vegas, the ONLY way to go is to get the AYCE special (All You Can Eat).  This place charges a $26 price tag.  The one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  I've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  With this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  Granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  My recommendations to get the most out of your AYCE is to stick to non-rice dishes.  I know, I know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  You can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  For dinner, here's what I got, grouped in categories:

Things I loved: Seaweed Salad (with sesame seeds), Fresh Oysters (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), Baked Mussels (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), Miso Soup (always a hit), Shrimp Tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce), 

Things I liked but kind of disappointed with: Ahi Poke - Bowl filled with seaweed salad, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  Kind of a disappointment.  I understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show. 

Things that were questionable:  Yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - If there's any rice dish I get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. The yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  I took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what I'm used to.  Make sure it's fresh!

All in all, this place is actually good.  I'm definitely coming back for another AYCE session.  The place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  If you're looking for a good sushi joint on the SW side of Vegas, for sure check them out!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,4,0,4,pa56hdaVw0BQRydXdhotyg

They also don't take reservations at the weirdest times. The hostesses are sooooo rude here and will ignore you unless you ask them for an update.

The staff spent more time cleaning the tables while there. There were probably 30 people waiting outside, because when I was seated there was 5 empty tables around me! The rolls are just okay, but their fish/sashimi was good, even though the servers DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE???? How do you confuse a white fish with octopus ?!

5056990,2013-01-18,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"I found this place perusing Yelp sometime back in 2010. AYCE lunch $21, dinner $26 which is comparable to similar places. Ive come here about 2-3 times a month for the past 2yrs plus. Always do AYCE. The main thing that got me as a repeat customer is their service(at least in my experiences) is considerably better than most sushi places Ive visited. I counted and cant even believe Ive tried 12 different AYCE sushi spots in Vegas to date. Im not a big fan of the traditional sushi, more into the creative and many rolls that these places sell. I like to say Im more into the 'americanized' type of sushi and have been able to convince friends who dont even eat raw fish to try it with me and most liked it. So you can take what you want from my review based on that. This place does get very busy at dinner with sometimes long waits to be seated so I try to frequent at lunch. Service can take longer at times. I typically like to sit at the bar when I sushi. I have experienced faster service that way usually, so now I lean towards sitting at the bar. The ambiance, decor and music targets the more younger demographic.
Some items I favor are the seared salmon nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, tiger roll, double screaming orgasm, heart attack, ian special, chung hua, kamikaze & surf n turf roll. At every AYCE I go for green tea ice cream and hamachi kama(not on AYCE here) if its available. They do also have brulees, mochi ice cream and parfaits for dessert. All desserts are limited to 1 per cept for ice cream. Dinner AYCE limits are 1 uni, 1 ama ebi and 2 raw oysters which is similar to most AYCEs. Theres a list of appetizers which I will order from ocassionally but I concentrate more on the sushi and green tea ice cream. :)
Is it the freshest and highest quality seafood? No. Its decent. It does say theres a time limit of, 90min I believe? Dont remember exactly atm since its never come into play. Ive never been rushed even tho I know I have passed the time limit before, or things like being reminded repeatedly on leftover charges. I realize this may not be everybodys cup of tea but for food and service Ive gotten here, I think you definitely get your moneys worth.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,2,1,4,uv7svwkZ6ZOZ2DU9Jtm7MQ

The reason why I am so harsh on this place. Well, sushi are just amazingly stupid. There is no artform whatsoever, sushi are art, even though you are an ayce restaurant. Its a reflection of the sushi chef how the presentation of the sushi went. 

This restaurant make all sushi look like california roll and to boot if you look at all the rolls it full of slimy crabmeat with mayonaisse combination to make you full right away. 

Sure, they do have other appetisers on the menu or dessert included, but there are lots of other japanese ayce around las vegas that offer the same things.

I have been to this location about 4 times total, service was never really extraordinary but it wasn't quite as disorganized as it was last Saturday. They had us sit in a private area because we were a party of 15, and I don't know if it was due to that fact but the total experience was dampen by their lack of organization when it came to ordering and getting our food. 

We all got the AYCE, so that right there was already less of a headache or so I thought. We even helped out by writing our orders on the napkins. That part was a cinch but when it came to actually receiving our orders, it was a mess. First, the dishes came out one at a time and then later on we were told that they were putting orders together in one plate: the tempura for example, which had we known, wouldn't have been a problem and could've just passed it around. Instead, people were waiting for their orders to arrive only to find out it was already given to the end of the table. We didn't want to keep ordering as we weren't aware if they were just backed up or totally forgotten. We were finally told towards the middle of the meal what they were doing, when half of the party was agitated already. Don't mess with hungry Filipinos LOL.   

The food is just OK, quality is nowhere as good as some of our preferred sushi places, it's AYCE I know, but I've been to other AYCE places where their nigiri's taste so much better and fresher. Now their green tea crème brulee is in a league of its own, I could eat about 5 of those suckers lol, it might be the only reason for me to come back hahaha oh and the unlimited ice cream.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,5,3,3,eC_pKq-EPp5iN23Op7XrQQ

It's somewhat hard to standout in such a crowded field.  Generally, I like to categorize them in which part of town they are in.

One of my ""must go"" places have been added in the Southwest section in Las Vegas.

Oyshi Sushi won't have the premium quality sushi, expect the fish to be previously frozen but still is not bad, the rice to fish ratio is more fish than rice, the rolls are not too over sauced, the salmon roe and flying fish eggs to be plentiful.

Customer service is excellent and attentive, they will stop by frequently to check if you want more orders.  Several notes:

They charge for green tea, so don't be surprised to tacked on a few more dollars for this.  The prices are in line with other AYCE restaurants, just a few dollars above $20 for lunch and around $26 for dinner.

But overall the atmosphere inside is pretty good and seats up large group of people which is good for birthday dinners or just a bunch of friends coming from out of town.

All you can eat I believe was $25 for dinner.  I'm just gonna point out what I like and usually order. Baked mussels, dynamite roll, volcano roll, nigiri is not as tasty here, oysters are the best I've had in Vegas but unfortunately only 4 per person so get your friends to order it as well even if they don't eat it so you can have it, surf and turf (highly recommended), and for dessert the fruit parfait.

I was reading the other reviews that had bad ratings and most of it came from bad service and about waiting too long. Well first of all, you gotta come early!

A VERY reluctant lunch stop proved to be a much better experience this time around!

A few highlights :

Sea Scallops were awesome! Super fresh, buttery texture...melt in your mouth! 

Sake was very fresh today! Beautiful cuts of salmon....the Sake in Yuzu was very good as well, and not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.

The Ika with Mint. I really enjoyed this combination...and it was noticeably less chewy than most. 

Ahi. Fresh, but another odd cut...the darker area was a bit tougher...should have been removed by the chef.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas?select=UnVcwLiUog_Lmr-ZkUaKwQ#UnVcwLiUog_Lmr-ZkUaKwQ

Unagi. Nice crispy edges...good flavor! 

Ahi Poke. Tuna was fresh, and the seaweed salad was good too!

Sunomono. I liked their version here...thin cuts versus the larger circular cuts most use. The ginger sauce was good too.

Green Tea Creme Brulee. Delicious! Lots of tea flavor here 

Service was fairly quick, considering their tables were mostly full.

5165831,2010-10-25,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Sigh. We were *really* looking forward to this after all the stellar reviews. I've been to Vegas many times and always thought the best sushi would be at some swank place on The Strip, but Yelp claimed otherwise.

The good: The food was, overall, fine. We didn't do All You Can Eat because my wife wanted two orders of sashimi (salmon and hamachi). Both were excellent. Nice large meaty pieces, well trimmed, nicely presented. We had two rolls each, which were fine but nothing special. I also had two orders of nigiri.

The bad: We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was MAYBE half full. It more than half hour before our first piece of food came out. It was 40 minutes before I saw any of my order. The (nice) server came by at 30 minutes and offered us free miso soup to help pass the time. Meanwhile we watched every other table in the place get multiple orders of sushi delivered. Completely unimpressed, and cost them several stars.

Other issues: I asked if they had aji bones they could deep fry, and the server went off to find out but never came back to tell me yes or no. My aji nigiri had the tiniest pieces of aji I've ever eaten on top. It tasted fine, but they amounted to table scraps, not at all like the beautiful pieces of sashimi my wife got.",4EsfR-KHYp-x5WMemy297Q,1,0,2,7tExJrgkfe-km9Dgitaq9Q

I ordered two in case maybe there was a mistake on how it was made the first time.  The second was as soggy, if not, more.  The flavor was there, just the texture was not correct.

I normally come here with my cousins when we feel like sushi and in the past the sushi has always been top notch.  But tonight, I think the chef was probably in a bad mood, hence the mediocre sushi. 

I also ordered a sashimi salad.  It's also not so great here.  I've had it better in other restaurants.  Oh well, maybe next time I try it might be better.  As long as the sushi chef I had tonight isn't the same as the next time.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,0,0,3,7IPwflZn_jADP9vm9QbtQg
5169595,2011-03-18,4,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Why three stars? Here's why.... First let me say that for a not so busy Saturday afternoon it took fifteen minutes for me and my boyfriend to be seated. It took another fifteen minutes on top of that for the waitress to take our order and another twenty minutes for us to get our sushi. I have heard of oyshi being one of the best sushi places in town, and while the sushi is good and tasty, in order for a restaurant (in my opinion) to have five worthy deserving stars the service needs to be as good as the food. That's minus star number one.

 And!.... You would think for an 'all you can eat' everything in the all you can eat section is all you can eat, right? Including the dessert? Well, I think not (not here at oyshi at least.) The dessert here is one per person only. Which technically isn't all you can eat. So it's basically all you can eat sushi, but not dessert. Haha. That would minus star number two. 

Now, on to the three yummy stars! When the sushi finally came, it was yum-O! With a capital last letter screaming O! The cajun albacore (thanks to a friend who recommended it at another sushi place) has become one of my favorites next to unagi. It's really full of flavor and I love how the center of attention goes to the fish, not the rice at the bottom. That gives plus one star.

The atmosphere in this restaurant is laid back. Both my boyfriend and I are laid back so the mood of the place set the mood for a relaxing time which is always much needed after a long busy week. Even their cutesy plate mats had designs of cutesy fonts and cutesy flowers. Haha. Guess what? Yes! You guessed it, another star for oyshi.

Freshness in sushi is another thing I look for. And boy oh boy does oyshi serve it fresh. As fresh as the prince of bel-air. We had the 'love affair' which everyone kept yelping about. It's the kind of affair that makes you feel guilty because you think you are cheating on your significant other. Oh yea, it's that's good! Total of three stars for this modern looking sushi spot.

I don't know if I'd come back though partly because of the service and partly because of my ever so longing for eating a lot of desserts. Well, I wouldn't say I don't know but maybe. Maybe the service is better than what we experienced in a different time or day. Maybe. A-ok review by me, but read other peoples reviews of this place. You may have a change of heart unlike me. =P",ce49FqC_myhN2k-HlT82eQ,4,3,3,CNzQ1RPZSp3zonWCojyM8Q
5170956,2017-11-18,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"When pressed for their favorite AYCE sushi place, most Vegas locals can name at least one. Oyshi on Rainbow is mine. 

I've been here for lunch and dinner, by myself and on dates. Most often, my roommates and I just roll up after one of us so much as mentions sushi.

The food is delicious and extremely fresh. I'm from New York where all-you-can-eat sushi is unheard of--and would be pretty suss if you did hear of it. Less than $30 for seafood? What, was it fished out of Hudson River?

Sashimi platters are the only thing on the menu that isn't AYCE. Dessert, however, is. I highly recommend their chocolate creme brûlée! For apps, you must try their Ahi Poke.

I'm partial to their Shrimp Tempura hand rolls, which I can, and have, eaten 3-4 of in one sitting. Other favorites include: Kami-Kaze, Oh My Heart, and Lobster Fair. If you like nigiri, you should check the chalkboard when you come in for the daily specials. 

Pro Tip: If you sit at the bar, you can order half-rolls! It's a great way to try more rolls if you're like me and have limited tummy space, but eyes bigger than your stomach.",E8o8NcJRgixpWCVobXwzmw,3,1,5,B0JXNp2cjGxgBJcoAvzhSw

- Accommodative. They changed the channel for the olympics for us :)
- Get the oysters. small but packed with flavor. beware! rocks with the oysters? too fresh :/. LOL
- Calamari was a bit too oily. no flavor
- Get the baked green mussels. they even cut it in half for you :)
- big pieces of yellow tail and salmon for the nigiri :)
- The monster roll is deceiving. it's not all soft shell crab. sad that they only use the legs. Ends are shrimp tempura.  
- LOVED the salmon skin roll. more skin than salmon means more crunchy :)
- the NYI roll barely has soft shell crab. even smaller legs!!! :(
- Nuclear roll had a bit too much cream cheese. :/
- Yellow tail trio was a bit too tangy. small pieces of yellow tail
- you only get ONE DESSERT! FAIL...
- Mango mochi was average. they put a toothpick in it with the plastic on. LOL
- Parfait was delicious. but needs more granola. i think the berries and strawberry pieces are frozen.

First of all, walking inside the restaurant, there was a strong scent of frying oil. I assume the ventilation inside is not strong enough. I've been to KFC and Popeyes without smelling that much oil frying.

We told the hostess our party had 4 people, when she walked us to the table, she took away a setting and set the table for 3, I didn't understand why she did that. So we asked a server to get us another setting, I'm not sure if he didn't hear us or if he was confused because we had to point out what a ""table setting"" was before he went to get it.

We didn't do the AYCE, just a few menu items:
Unagi & Avocado Roll:
The sushi roll was made badly, the rice was falling apart and there was a lot of avocado, barely any eel and smothered in way too much sauce.
Donburi:
Donburi is a combo of thin sliced beef (that is NOT all lean meat), egg, onions over rice with sauce in it. The one we got was dry, barely any sauce until you hit way bottom. The beef used was all lean and definitely not thinly sliced.
Kids Popcorn Chicken & Teriyaki Chicken meals:
The popcorn chicken was overcooked. They definitely fried it for too long. It was dry and some pieces had a burnt taste. My son ate a few pieces and said he didn't like it. The Teriyaki chicken was also overcooked. The chicken was hard to chew.

Service:
We saw a lot of servers walking around, but it didn't look like they were doing anything productive. Only the manager (we assume, he was well dressed not in server type uniform) came by multiple times to see if our table was doing OK. Otherwise, the server would come by drop off food and disappear before we can even ask for anything.

Maybe, we'll give it another try in the future, but for now, it was not the dinner we expected to have.",QtMgqKY_GF3XkOpXonaExA,4,0,2,_H1AwWUjYmVRNWljeN3Lyg

My dinner at Oyshi was so fast, I couldn't even comprehend the food I ate. For starters - the mussels are a MUST and so is the ahi poke which is very fresh tuna.

The following I found 1 star:
Oysters (they taste really bad not fresh' and needed lemon)
Adegashi tofu (they give you one and it is now sweet or yummy. 

The decent but small pieces:
Fresh scallop
Eel
Fried scallops  the fried scallops was small size but tasted yummy.  Why not isn't everything fried best? 
The rib eye steak was ok but some of it was just too well done so it was tough.  
The surf and turf is better with the rib eye and two shrimps. It comes in a sizzling platter, 
Poke was like two little bites.  Photos of this was way generous then

Garlic tuna
Albacore
Salmon belly
Octopus

Oyshi is one of the only places that uses lobster in their dishes. I wish it was a little more distinguishable though. Mixed in with the diced crab stick, it is difficult to taste the natural sweetness of the lobster. I am not a huge mayo fan either, but did not dislike any of the dishes because of it. The fact that it was not mixed with half a jar made it bearable.

The rice is the most important part of the sushi. Even though we were there early, the rice was cooked off early enough to let it properly cool. There is nothing worse than warm fish and rice that falls apart when picked up.

But not in a good way.

I understand that a restaurant doesn't really decide when it's busy or not. But when I went two weeks ago on a Thursday for dinner, I really didn't expect the amount of neglect that my party of three received. We all ordered off of the AYCE menu and some dishes from the kitchen. 

In the duration of 30 minutes, we got nothing from the kitchen except miso soup. When we asked our server, he just nonchalantly shrugged and said it was a busy night. Barely saw him after that and just felt like he was avoiding our table. 

When we did get our nigiri and rolls, I really did wish it could've been SO MUCH BETTER to redeem the time that we wasted. There was so much rice in our sushi that it might've been better to just serve a bowl of rice. I understand that you're not supposed to discard the rice but I'm not paying for the rice, I'm under the impression that I'm paying for the sushi.

That night, we ordered dessert but we didn't have energy to waste another 20 minutes. We just left.

Preface: This review had been shortened & edited from an 8-page thesis which I will someday publish as ""Can Fresh Sushi be Found in the Middle of the Desert?""

POSITIVE: 
* My 18 y.o. niece (Las Vegas native) recommended this sushi restaurant. ""Uncle, this place is the BOMB!""
* Off the L.V. Strip

NEGATIVE:
* Host not attentive to the waiting guests (first time I've ever seen a restaurant host partake in drinking with guests during a work shift).
* Waitress/Server never there when we needed her - asking if we needed anything every 90 seconds the last 15 minutes of our stay.
* Food seemed like it sat too long before reaching the table. 
* Beer not chilled enough. (maybe it sat out too long before being served as well).
* Water glasses were never serviced nor were we asked if we wanted anything else to drink.
* The time waiting to be seated succeeded the time spent eating at the table
* Overpriced less than average fare for an over-rated joint.

Will I return? Sure...if I sit at the sushi bar & someone else pays.

Every time I open the menu I search for a new roll to try and I end up confused and indifferent to my selection. I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese or eel in my rolls. Oddly, these two items (but mainly the cream cheese) makes it hard for me to find one that sound appealing without modification. It's a large menu but I can never seem to find a roll that sounds 'amazing' as written. 

They offer all you can eat which is great for big eaters. We typically order a couple rolls, some baked mussels, a few hot sakes, and mochi. Each time the server has comped off one or more of the smaller items because we were paying the regular prices so it always comes out to about the same cost as if we had done all you can eat. 
Service can be spotty but if you're not in a rush it's a nice spot to grub on some sushi basics.",l7E5dQmzqg_X_oUI8x_88g,0,0,3,aSMJussKEck0SBN6-508DQ

Don't get me wrong the sushi was not bad - the albacore was tasty even though it was warm. Two of the rolls were ok, not delicious, but good. What this place needs to step up in is on service. Staff friendly but not as attentive as they could've been. I never received my Sapporo and was billed for it (I didn't pay for it).I imagine the trick is ordering the AYCE. The table next to us had it and received regular service, in fact, their water glasses were filled while ours were left empty.

There was no one in line and they only had a few people in the restaurant. Then all around our service was bad. Our waitress took a long time to take our orders and once we were done with a dish multiple waiters and bussers would walk by and they still wouldn't take away our dirty plates.. Eventually the dishes just piled up. Even when they brought new rolls out they wouldn't take our plates away.. Then to top off a bad experience the sushi was subpar if that. We could tell the fish was previously frozen so it took away the flavor of the fish. I was very disappointed.. The whole experience was bad.,12AzaKnyko99WgDYn30u1Q,1,0,2,n0wCy2N6KDw3qu-nIopnHQ

My trip to Vegas would not be complete without a visit to Oyshi Sushi. Though it's off strip, I'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time I'm there. 

My last visit was the first time I've done their All You Can Eat deal, and for $26, it was WELL WORTH IT! The only things it DOESN'T include are the Chef's Special Sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. My friends and I went all out and ordered several to share of every course. Oysters were delicious and baked mussels (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. Tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. My favorite salad is their ahi poke on top of seaweed salad - YUM! We shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. Again their specialty ""yum yum"" sauce is ""yum yum"", but in small amounts. The mochi ice cream is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! We also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.

Service is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. As with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! They did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.

If you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, Oyshi is the place to go!",IY2Ypw_1yuxPv5dHzrMKpw,1,0,4,52oa_ifRx0rzw2vi4WBHug

He and our other friend heard good things about this place. We arrive and it turns out our other friend has been here once but forgot (haha hope this isn't bad news). 

Turns out it was really good. I like the decor of the place and the music playing makes it feel kind of clubby haah. Our waitress was nice to let us switch from the table to the bar so we could get our orders in faster. We all stuffed our faces full of sushi. Large selection of sushi to choose from so you should find something you like. Since the day I had some cream cheese in sushi I am a fan so when I saw it on the menu I had to try everyone that had cream cheese haha. For dessert which I gave to my friend I had the strawberry mochi. He had the green tea ice cream.

I give it 3 stars. I love the sushi and the guys were friendly making the sushi and the waitress was friendly too. It's far for me but if in the area it is the place I would stop at.",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,2,0,3,M7kEkfI05UPYJWMCTHmYOA

5516610,2013-01-06,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"I do love sushi and Oyshi's is good, but the AYCE service leaves something to be desired. Service is very slow, and orders come when the chef decides to prepare them, not when you ordered it.  Orders have been forgotten and errors made repeatedly. Because its all-you-can-eat maybe there's a sense that mistakes don't matter if you accept the dish, since it's all the same price.  

Those complaints aside, the food is done well and isn't oversized and sloppy like some AYCE places. You can tell the chefs care about presentation. I can't think of any food of poor quality there.  

My tips for this place would be to:
1) come with a list
2) order a variety of items at once. When they arrive, order the next batch. 
3) make sure everyone at the table agrees to order in batches, otherwise everyone  will be sitting around waiting for ages until your next lonely order arrives- and that second order could take 30 minutes or more!
4) save room for the tiny dessert. It comes with the AYCE.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,1,0,3,TDV-nS1bOjHiae19E6DMGg

5526858,2013-05-31,1,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Were I come from, all you can eat sushi means buffet, which also means stay away. So when Khatherine T. and I made a sushi date and she suggested AYCE, I about died. Thankfully, Oyshi Sushi has opened my eyes to the other side of AYCE.

Even though this was my first real experience with AYCE, I still ordered off the menu, LOL! Should have and would have tried it, but the BF begged me to bring him left overs, the AYCE rules require you to finish eating everything you order. Nuts! Next time the BF can get his own sushi, I'm going big or going home!

Our server was so nice! He made several recommendations of really good rolls, I like mine spicy and he knew which were hot and which were too hot. He even told me one roll to stay away from. He was attentive and made sure we always had food in front of us and our water glasses stayed full. Khatherine was a pro at this, she didn't even have to look at the menu, she knew everything she wanted and ordered each time he came back to the table. She knew how to keep the sushi coming, and everything that came to the table looked delicious!

The sushi was good, not amazing, but good. I tried the Monster Roll (it was so big I had a hard time fitting it in my mouth!), the Rainbow Roll (by BF's request), and the Red Dragon. The Red Dragon was by far my favorite!! My order actually ended up being more expensive than the AYCE, but at least I could bring leftovers home.

The menu is very big and definitely worth it if you are going to eat at least 3 rolls. Plus, you get the option of ordering appetizers and other sides. The only down side to Oyshi is the time it takes to bring out your food. Other sushi places in town are very quick to get orders to the table.

Super selection-The yellowtail and garlic tuna are amazing!  Fresh everytime  and melts in your mouth.  Top 5  favorite rolls - I think what makes these so good is the eel sauce (slightly sweet):

1) Atomic bomb (kind of a sad name for a japanese roll but I digress) - spicy jalapeno on top and siracha
2) Monster roll - huge but has all the goodies 
3) Simply shrimp- light and sweet
4) Red dragon- spicy tuna roll sweet and spicy yum!
5) Tiger roll - similar to red dragon buy with shrimp tempura added

Just tried their hand roll last night - They have a killer shrimp and avocado one. Not on the menu but they'll make it for you. 

Appetizers:
Seaweed salad
Excellent tempura-always fresh and hot never oily
Surf and turf-steak and shrimp appetizer. One order enough for two people to share

Desserts (all you can eat is one dessert per person)
Mochi of course!!
Yogurt parfait is big, especially after a large meal, but very tasty

Some negatives:

Oyshi can get really busy.  They do take reservations and have two private rooms available.  Also, not a big fan of the ""baked sushi"" although the california crunchy roll is pretty good if you like baked.

The only reason I didn't give Oyshi 5 starts is because of the service. Every once in a while you'll find yourself wanting to order sushi for 10 minutes or more because you haven't seen your server.

Great service, the chefs were really friendly and always checking to make sure if we needed anything. But the food (in terms of good sushi and authentic Japanese) was mediocre.

I ordered their white tuna sushi and sunomono salad as well. White tuna was decent and sunomono was something errr else...cucumber was shredded thin, not sliced thin and they put a sesame peanut sauce on it instead of the usual rice vinegar.

They also have a number of great apps, like baked mussels or surf and turf skillet, that are ayce, and my mom loves them. 

I also like that, unlike some of the other popular ayce sushi places in the area, the wait here is never crazy. If you come here on a regular weekend night, it shouldn't be anything more than 10-15 min wait.

My family and I had shrimp tempura, baked mussels, heart attack roll, salmon roll, california roll, oyshi roll, lasagna roll, yellowtail nigiri, salmon nigiri, white tuna nigiri, and the vegas roll. Everything that we ordered was completely delicious. I really appreciated that the sashimi slices for their nigiri were generously thick. The fish to rice ratio of the nigiri was perfect. Not too much rice.

Only reason why I gave it a 4 is because the service was kind of eh. And I really didn't like how my 3-year-old was $16 for AYCE. My daughter doesn't even eat much sushi at all. I like sushi places that have children 5 & under free. So those two would be my only reasons as to why they don't receive 5 stars. 

Minus the cons, I think this place is a very decent place to eat sushi. I would go back. Not often, but if I'm ever in this side of town & craving some sushi.. I'll definitely stop by.",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,1,0,4,Br2_syOgYqXDIriYDzoabA

We had a party of 6, waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  I've been here when it has been busy and tonight it wasn't that BUSY. We made our first round of orders and waited, waited some more and waited.  It was a good 25 minutes before we got our first round.  We didn't receive our complete order, I just said eh never mind. We ordered some more, and I ordered some Uni and oysters for our group. Again we waited, and waited again. We got the rest of our FIRST order and got some of the second but no uni or oysters. So I ordered some nigiri to hold me over until the uni and oysters came. My nigiri came but not the other items, finally the oysters came but no uni, i asked our server where is the uni and i she tells me 'oh, we ran out'. I was like WTF! Shouldn't you know that information before I ordered it or at least kept me updated. At this point some of my party was clearly upset and just ordered dessert but guess what? They were OUT of some the dessert items too! 

This last visit was VERY bad, I hope they improve cause I like this place a lot because they offer different items from other AYCE.

FYI: The table next to us, got up and left and never paid, I think it was due to the poor service they got.

5659659,2008-09-09,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"This place was initially introduced and highly recommended to us by a friendly bartender from the Silverton Casino.  He informed us that this place was a spin-off of Sushi Factory (in Las Vegas).  It's a bit out of the way from ""The Strip"", but if you have the time it's well worth it.  Anyway, after a horrible experience at Sushi Factory (see my review) several months ago, my buddies and I decided to give Oyshi a go.  We couldn't have been any happier with our visit to Oyshi.  Our server (Justin) was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  As for the food, the sashimi was fresh, the rolls were tasty, the ambiance was comfortable, simple and modern.  By the way, the Ama ebi (sweet shrimp) and Uni (sea urchin) were both very fresh and delicious.  However, I was bummed that each customer was limited to one order of Ama ebi and Uni per customer.  But being that both are very expensive items, one can understand.  If you're looking for a great, affordable sushi dinner in the Las Vegas area, look no further than Oyshi.  I hope they keep up the good service, and not falter like that of Sushi Factory.",aWzthlLZOuFfOEwazvWI_g,0,0,5,pAKprDE8AGsbh33L9hGGGw
5661260,2013-04-27,1,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Oyshi has a delicious and extensive ayce menu, there is no doubt about that. Many of the items are interesting and full of flavor. Some of my favorite items are the Love Affair and Japanese Lasagna rolls as well as the beef wrapped asparagus and sizzling ribeye. The quality and creativity of their menu items deserves praise. For example, the cucumber salad isn't the typical you would get at another sushi spot, they have a peanuty sauce laid on top that really individualizes it from the standard version of the dish. All that being said, I still would not say that dinner there should be several dollars higher than other ayce sushi places. 

First of all, the service at Oyshi stinks, to put it plainly. Don't get me wrong, the staff is pleasant and at times can even be friendly. However, the food just comes out way too slowly. Other sushi restaurants really leave Oyshi crying in the dust when it comes to this. On top of that, they definitely pull the ""always filling up your drink"" technique to get us full. This just doesn't give your party a lot of room to appreciate all of the items they offer simply because your appetite duration can only hold out for so long.

Secondly, the dessert choices are outstanding, BUT you are limited to one special dessert! Their desserts are the best I've seen so far at a sushi place, but oh my goodness, for $26 dinners, I personally think we should be allowed to try them all one time each, at the very least! I am in love with the green tea tiramisu and the green tea crème brûlée. The fruit parfait is also very tasty, anything but disappointing.

For these reasons, I award Oyshi three stars. Their food makes them a great establishment, but I strongly feel they need cater better to the customers.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,2,1,3,vQ36sdiG-iJ3iHEIiJ-3tQ

The hostess was no where to be seen, so we had to wait 20 minutes before someone even noticed we were there. We finally got seated, got out drinks, and ordered our first selection for the all you can eat sushi. However, we had to wait 35 minutes until even just our appettizer of the small surf and turf came out. After that it seemed like we were invisible to the waiters before we even got one to awknowledge that they were having staffing problems and that we should wait another 15 minutes for our sushi to come out. When we finally got the sushi it was horribly made and cold (we ordered a baked sushi). I happened to order calamari for my 2nd selection after finishing the 1st. That never came. After being ignored for a few more minutes another waitress came by to see if we would like anything, I was already super pissed by that time so I just ordered a dessert and asked for the check.

i wasn't sure if we were going to be able to eat a lot but we sure ate more than we paid for! everything in the menu was included except for sashimi (easy fix: order it sushi style and don't eat the rice), uni and ebi.

we had gyoza, edamame, seaweed salad,  seven rolls (from regular spicy tuna and alaska rolls to specialty ones including a spider, baked rolls, and a deep fried philly), two hand rolls, two orders of tako nigiri, two orders of hamachi nigiri, an order of tamago, and green tea ice cream for dessert.

i'd say we did a but of damage at this joint! what i also liked was that our waitress was recommending specialties to get and told us that appetizers and dessert were included. she was also helpful when my cousin wanted green tea ice cream and parfait by combining the two together. it was pretty much the green tea ice cream instead of vanilla yogurt with fruit and whipped cream on top. what a way to end a great meal!",MDsrQ8PtiYWkcGvlVqb8sw,0,0,4,7wiGEUwKh2Zzvl3-EdsdfQ
5688149,2012-11-11,10,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Well I just ate at Oyshi an hour ago and this is my experience with them. First off I should have known better to eat there when I realized me and my friend were the only Asians in the restaraunt. If you are a Expert Sushi eater you would do well to stay away from Oyshi. The Sushi Rice was horrid. It was not cooked all the way and they pack the rice way too tight. I never got three things I ordered by the time I left which was such a turn off.  Some of the Nigiri was decent however some of it tasted not so fresh. The back of my throat was itching from their fish as I am very sensitive to bad fish. The server was super sweet however she was not attentive what so ever. 

    My child ordered the Teryaki kids meal and the first thing she said when I asked her how is it was my chicken is dry with no flavor so I had them take it back. 

   They do not understand how to make rolls there. I ordered the spicy tuna which was the worse spicy tuna. They had no cucumber in any rolls which that texture was missing from every roll. I do not think they understand the proper way to make sushi. 

  Discouraged from the sushi I tried to order some apps to get my moneys worth.... Bad idea the salad ...bad! The Calamri was the same frozen tiny dried over cooked calamari served at other pizza bistros. The sizzling rib eye was over cooked and dry and flavorless. The mussels had a garlic soy mayo sauce which was super salty and made the mussels super rich. 

   This place seems to be more for those who really do not know what good sushi is. If you were raised eating sushi then I would stay far away from Oyshi.  They seem concerned when they notice a customer is unhappy yet management or the servers do nothing to ammend the situation. 

  I ordered Sea Urchin, sunrise roll, white tuna, salmon, garlic tuna and a few other rolls and Nigiri. The only thing I liked or enjoyed was my water with lemon. 

  Now all I am thinking about is the money I wasted there. I have never been so displeased ergo why I tweeted to my 16 Thousand Followers that they should never eat at Oyshi .. HORRIBLE",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,9,8,1,Ug6x2TvfnZ2PmJwFyWpAnw

The imitation crab was mushy and sweet. The rolls were 7 day-old grocery store quality. I'm talking about Albertson's quality. The rolls at Whole Foods are way better than Oyshi's. Also, the rolls were loaded with way too much rice. I know that ayce places love to fill you up with rice, but this was ridiculous.

There's nothing special, in my opinion, but my friend wanted to come to try one of their desserts (IKR?). 

They only allow you to pick one dessert item (not including unlimited ice cream, though). Another friend stated when they came before they didn't have this restriction. Well, looks like it was just mochi ice cream for me then, which comes only in strawberry, by the way. 

They have some daily specials so check out that list on the way to your table. Fish wasn't as shabby as anticipated so that was a plus. I love salmon nigiri but theirs wasn't too good, actually. So I definitely ate less than usual in that department. 

In terms of hot tea, they charge you $2.50 for the pot at the table so I'm thankful it wasn't $2.50 per person :).

They have a variety to choose from for AYCE, with the whole inside menu strictly rolls.  When I do AYCE, I only go for nigiri.  As I've posted before, I'm not really into rolls because its usually covered in sauce, with very little filling.  I guess it's what Americans love though... Sauce on everything.  I'm guilty as well, just not on my sushi.

Anyway, the fish was really poor quality.  After my initial order, I couldn't bring myself to order any more.  I love my fish to taste like fish (if that even makes sense).  The fish here had no taste whatsoever.  All I could taste was the vinegar from the rice.

I thought it was cool they served oysters, but it was pretty blah.  There was no flavor at all.  It tasted like water.  It did not have that ""taste like the sea"" quality.  I don't know.  It just didn't taste like anything.  The baked mussels were not very good. Overcooked. No flavor.  Too chewy.

Tofu was ok, but too much sauce, and it was overly sweet.  Desserts were boring.  No green tea ice cream. Creme brûlée was ok.  Ice cream parfait was ok.

Seriously, this place is lacking all types of flavors.

I like the fact that they serve ""fresh"" scallops, other places usually have the baby scallops drenched in yum yum sauce.

At the end I ordered 2 rolls to go for my friend who intro me to this spot cause he couldn't make it. I brought them to his store after dinner and left he texted me to ask what they were cause it was not what he ordered. We called oyshi manager Kevin and he told us he would take care of us next time. So a few days later (visit 3 in less then 10 days) we went again. This time my friend who intro the place made it. When we were done we asked for Kevin again the five of us ate ayces. My two boys both under 3 did not eat. Again we were in VIP room.  Kevin came up and we reminded him of our wrong roll order and the 22 buck credit we had. He said what rolls would you like to take home? We said none the guy we ordered them for is here and we ate enough fish tonight. He said well I'm not taking off check next time you do want rolls to go I will take care of you. Then the check came 18% gratuity for 5 people....... We paid it cause it was 24 dollars but the server actually screwed himself out of a bigger tip.  The service also sucked.. Hour for our first round of rolls to show to the table. It's fresh it's good. It will be closed soon if their attitudes don't change.,fp2KiLfoIO9OIUV2KHkgEA,1,0,1,G0HKT2VAjp8gZvep9p753g

5801132,2009-04-03,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"Oyshi, well what can I say. It is an all you can eat sushi place that is run by Koreans. The decor is very modern and there are several water sculptures that is placed around the restaurant. They also have private rooms and large Plasma tvs that will show a basketball game or two. I was introduced to this sushi place by a friend of mines and went for the first time a couple of months ago. I have to say their appetizer menu is, by far, superior to all AYCE sushi places. Their surf and turf has this sweet and tangy sauce, it is served over a bed of shredded greens with steak and shrimp on a hot plate that is sizzling as it arrives. Their oysters are fairly good served with a bit of chili sauce and you can have max of 4. I have gone back to Oyshi about 3 times and this review is a collective of all the times I dined there. The first time I dined I ordered some salmon, tuna, yellowtail, nigiri. I was very very impressed with the quality and ratio of rice to fish. I asked the waiter what he would recommend as it was my first time dining there and he immediately chirped ""love affair"" you must have it. It was very very good. I do have to say it took them over 20 minutes to bring out my order of nigiri and even longer for the love affair roll. There were probably 10 people dining there. I was kind of confused as a couple that came after us got their roll first. I am normally a service junkie and if I don't get it I usually don't ever step back into the restaurant. This restaurant seemed like a place that deserved a second chance. I went another time with a group of 9 and were sat in a semi private area where the wall had a huge mural that seemed hand painted. We were seated and they took our orders. The wait wasn't as painful this time as they brought out the food fairly quickly. Once again, the love affair roll and my classic salmon, tuna and yellowtail nigiri were wonderful. The third time I went was pretty similar to the first time I dined here. The service was subpar and their food seemed to lack flavor. I have to say if their service was at par with how their decor is I would probably have given a higher rating, but without good service the clients will never return. Maybe they deserve another chance? I have to wait and see.",VUrTgQhEB4Vo04xbnNiNyQ,0,0,3,OLS-7iIeldTLgi-WOP4_2A

We always sit at the bar in the back corner as it is cozy and has a great view of the flat screen TV on the wall that always has the latest sports game playing. 

We have our favorite rolls and this time we enjoyed a new appetizer that was really good. The popcorn scallops was a yummy appetizer we tried which came with a honey mustard and a spicy ranch dipping sauce. 

What we really like about Oyshi is the consistency in service and food quality. We have never really been disappointed with a visit, it is an easy and happy relationship we have with Oyshi.

I really enjoy the flavors of the Oyshi roll and the Lobster Affair which both melt in my mouth. My lover boy likes the spicy rolls such as the nuclear bomb and the atomic roll.

I must say that the quality of the food deserves five stars. They offer a lot of interesting styles of rolls and also offer specials of the day that are included in AYCE. My test for all sushi restaurants I go to is the Salmon Skin Handroll. Oyshi passed with flying colors. The salmon skin was crispy. The seaweed was crunchy and not soggy from getting drenched with eel sauce to add flavor. Salmon skin roll is a simple roll but can easily be ruined if not done correctly. Since that turned out well, I was really looking forward to trying the wide selections of rolls that they offered on the menu. You pretty much have the whole menu to choose from including appetizers, salads and desserts for the AYCE. So if it's not just sushi you're craving, the AYCE is still an excellent choice.

We came here for lunch and did the AYCE menu. For $25ish, its a steal of a deal just based on the cost basis of California style sushi at any other restaurant. 
And that my friends, is all we came here for.  If you have read any of my other Japanese restaurant reviews, you know that this is not my cup of tea so please don't unfollow me; the lady wanted to eat Cali style sushi so what the lady wants, the lady gets. 

Here is the fat skinny on this place: if you stick to just the sushi rolls, you will be satisfied. Lets do the math: the average price for a Cali style roll at any given sushi joint will run you about $10 so assuming you eat at least 2 rolls, then you will eat your money's worth. 
The rolls were decent but nothing spectacular. As mentioned previously I prefer the purist motherland style sushi. 

Notable misses for this place:
1. They charge extra for sashimi
2. Most of the cooked food is not very good. The steak did not taste good and the sizzling platter was loaded with onions as fluff.

After hearing my coworker praising it, I finally hit up the place with a few Meetup folks from Las Vegas and SoCal.  It is the sister restaurant to Soyo Barestaurant in the same plaza, so yes, this is another Korean owned sushi restaurant with some items that has a more Korean flare/flavor.

The restaurant itself is well-lit and trendily decorated, and attracts a diverse crowd of patrons looking for good AYCE sushi at a reasonable price.

The AYCE menu is practically the entire menu (mostly nigiri and rolls), except the sashimi and if I remembered correctly some salads.  They also have expanded their menu, and the new items are printed on the paper place mats, so don't forget to check those out too.  Plus the numerous options available in the appetizer section is more than adequate to round out the sushi dining experience.  There are three special items (uni, ama ebi and raw oysters) that is limited to one order/pp with AYCE, and the restaurant reserves the right to charge you for the food you don't finish to minimize unnecessary waste (standard rules of the AYCE realm).

I Enjoyed:
Sibuya No Rice Roll
New Moon Roll
Vegas No Rice Roll
YumYum Scallop
Ama Ebi and the fried shrimp heads
Surf n Turf
Popcorn Scallops

I Didn't Care For:
Japanese Lasagna (topped with way too much mayo that it overwhelmed and masked the flavor profile of the rolls underneath)
Asian Style Flank Steak (basically a not so good version of the traditional Korean Bulgogi served on a sizzling plate)
Green Tea Tiramisu

Service was good, especially considering that Ted, was our only waiter, and he was looking after our party of 7 plus his other tables.

We were seated in one of the side rooms with really comfortable seats, so it was extra relaxing.

Pros: The price was the norm for this type of establishment.  The food is good.  I'm not a big time roll eater as I'd rather eat nigiri over some American take on sushi.  The nigiri was of decent quality, not outstanding, but hey, it is the desert after all. The appetizers are great!  Yes you can make a meal out of the appetizers.  The sauce on the surf and turf was outstanding.  The tempura dipping sauce was also great.

Cons:  First of all, this place has gotten very busy.  I used to be able to walk right in, now it can be up to a 45 minute wait.  Once you get in you get the feel that this place is understaffed.  (Update!!!  Staff seems to have increased, speed of orders has improved....some.  Still a packed house.)  The servers come around, yet your order does not.  I came with a group of 7 big time eaters and we put in big orders at a time.  Not only did our orders take forever to come out, but it felt like the manager was watching us to see if we were really eating all that food.  It got to a point that they stopped taking our order.  It says all you can eat on the door buddy.  (Update:  Management does not do that to us anymore, are they reading this?  Great job if they are!)  They didn't even bring out our oysters and claimed that they did and we could not have any more.  I had to explain to the manager that we are not asking for more, we never got any to begin with.  They figured out that our oysters were taken to the wrong table.  Lucky them.  We ended up paying the bill and leaving having not received everything we ordered. They couldn't even take the time to fill a drink.

UPDATE:  The last few times we went we got better service, the rotation of fish is fast, so the flavor has improved.  Still not the fastest, and still a wait to get in, but it's a slamming busy place now.  I have found one big dislike that is totally not the restaurant's fault.  Every time I go there now, there always seems to be the loudest, most obnoxious, cussing, group of trendy punks sitting right next to me.  It's like man, if you've got all this money that you seem to need to yell about so everyone can hear you, why are you at an AYCE sushi place.  Go eat at some rich place where everyone else is yelling about their car and their money.

I did not really understand this AYCE culture, in Europe we had carousel sushi and sashimi and we had eat in Tepenyaki/ Sushi restaurants (I think in USA the equivalent would be a high class of that old restaurant Benihana?). So I was DYING for sushi but know I really crave the wasabi (it clears me out and my sinuses are awful living here in the Anus Mundi). 

I walked in and my waitress, whose name escapes me and I am so sorry as she was super sweet to me, I hope management can answer with her name, well she and a guy named Stefan were literally really interested in helping me indulge. Of course I could not get the AYCE (and with all that rice I would find it pretty disgusting even not on a diet-and honestly watching some people in America eat actually scares me)-but suffice to say I had hot sake (oddly no sugar and almost no carbs-1.4carbs per serving and NO sugars due to how it is fermented and I love it) so I indulged in both of my desires, luckily Sake does not really affect me for some reason, a glass of wine would make me drunk and red in the face but sake does very little I just love the taste.

I was eating sashimi made by Mexicans and a Filipino--being waited on by a Bulgarian and a girl who had Asian and Mexican in her (the waitress whose name escapes me) and I was all by myself just eating and I swear I gave most Americans a run for their money with the way I ate. It was the best ""splurge"" (food and money) I made in a long time.

5969603,2012-05-01,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"This is the closest sushi spot to me and I'm glad it's actually a decent place.  I go here with my little brother and so far it's been great.  The servers there are very friendly and usually have a smile on their face.  Our last server there when we went for ayce was pretty cute as well (always a plus).

As far as the sushi is concerned, I got my money's worth.  The fish was pretty fresh, not the freshest, but still good.  I prefer sushi that isn't drenched in sauce and the rolls that I had were good.  I got away with an extra dessert when you can only order one, thanks to our cute waitress.  The best rolls were the Hawaiian and the Yellowtail Trio.

They also have a great selection of entrees and apps to choose from.  I have had the teriyaki beef and that was really good.  They have something for everyone interested in Asian cuisine.

Whenever I feel like treating myself or my friends and family, this will definitely be the spot.",PIqY8tBBbRIWmdpW7EFEUw,1,1,4,XPu2dSbEMf39iJsNY132jQ

I've sat at the bar in one of the cute booths, and tables service was great every time. 

They're sushi was delicious; fresh fish, good sauce variety, spicy rolls and nice cuts of fish. Not sure if they have many riceless options, but it would be a great addition.

If I lived closer I would probably frequent more.",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,0,0,4,fBZwSFLO8AzNleh7kOOy7w

All the fish are fresh and for me, perfectly sliced. Sushi at other places are too bug for a mouthfull, but here its perfect. The eel is by far my favorite and the tuna and yellowfin are also top notch. The restaurant is charming and the staff are attentive. Pricing here us pretty standard so no suprises there. You can easily go here on a date or with your family. This place is my number one on my list of sushi restaurants.",reLrRzRvCUzoVPaSo5fCzA,0,0,5,H0ZOMpeSuRXhNTWzWpaiLw

Seated quick and served quicker, although he did not think we got our food fast enough and took care of the first round of drinks.  Great experience, especially after our first stop.",QytT9uP_UiJMhHw7C8UEbg,0,0,5,eatZmamfyd__P3eMRfKoog

5986257,2014-09-11,0,Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw,"This place has changed a lot since I first went there. 
Uni- I know not to expect too much from ayce uni, but the uni came out grey and slimy. 
Oysters- the oysters were nice and big. They tasted fresh, and not overpowered with sauce. Probably the best dish. 
Surf & turf - bland and flavorless. The shrimp was super rubbery due to being over cooked.
AGEDASHI TOFU- fried to a crisp, so when you cut into it.. the entire batter falls off. It should be light and easy to swallow.
NIGIRI- fish quality was decent, but filled with a lot of rice. The amaebi tasted ok, but there is a part of the shrimp head that they don't clean off and discard. This makes it very difficult to enjoy, and sharp on the gums. 
Asparagus Beef- asparagus wasn't shaved down enough at roots, so you get the bad stringy part stuck in your teeth if it's possible to even bite off. 
Beef and asparagus, shrimp skewers - very dry, overcooked, flavorless. ( a waste of stomach space )

Overall, really nothing special anymore. They don't allow half rolls which is unusual at an ayce spot. They seem to have cut the ayce app menu down a bit too. The service was good, and attentive. However, I would rather stick to umiya for ayce. They have a larger selection with much better quality.",khXwaOAkgSaM1T3O_TCpKA,0,1,2,PHj0_fPveSHJKAiLrCHQnQ

Service was slow after the first set of food came out. After they give you the bill they come more often. Great place for kids. Prices are great as well, we did all you eat for kids and an adult. Place is clean. Overall good place :)",M5o0xa5z5oHxqFtbwcG_Dg,0,0,3,LNTqN5P05j5_gjQu66494w

It's usually busy on the weekend but the service is great and I just recently learned that you can order half rolls! Which for me is so much better so I can try different things. I was brave this time and tried the Oh my heart roll and surprisingly I liked it. Me and my husband's go to is the ngiri which is fresh and we love the salmon belly. Overall, I have recommended and even brought different family members and friends to this location and will continue going here since if is convenient and food that I love.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,0,5,14qBsiBegFyYPWdVkNOU4g
