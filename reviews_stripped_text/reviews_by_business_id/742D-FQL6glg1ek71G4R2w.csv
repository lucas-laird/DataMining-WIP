A hint of buyer's remorse trickled up upon checking in on Yelp, then came in a raging torrent of disappointment after taking the first bite. Never knew it was possible to have such bland food. There was no flavor in the bread, meat, onions, or peppers at all, not even in the hot sauce that I added! Were they allergic to salt and spices?

I swear I didn't know better, but now I do.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,2,1,2,OHACc35ylxqH75bYtFbXQg

Quality: Poor. Blandest thing I have ever eaten.
Turnaround: Poor-Good. Came right before closing, but still this is suppose to be fast food.
Service: Good. No attitude and provided everything I needed.

Sadly, this is one of the few places that I have nothing good to really say about them. Their pricing was not comparable to anything I have had before and bordered on being way too expensive for a simple meal. Why would anyone pay $3 for a measly side of fries? The worst was the food. I never knew beef mixed with onions and peppers can be so devoid of flavors like this sandwich was. I am actually amazed, but since I had paid for this meal, I feel cheated instead. The meat, although tender, had no taste to them and I would have doubt I was even eating beef if I had not known I ordered a Philly cheesesteak. Moreover, the sandwich was dry, even with all the onions and peppers that would normally be oozing juices. The cheese was also strangely nonexistent so the sandwich was really just a bunch of beef sitting around doing nothing. The turnaround was also pretty sad. This is suppose to be fast-paced eatery in the middle of a food court and given that the items are either grilled or fried, I expected speedier service. In addition,  I was the last customer before they closed with not another soul in sight so I had no idea of what the holdup could even be.",TgaSWikmnCcGZTmmlPp_Tw,0,0,2,AaGnCc4Bq7uHxWV3nEvx8g

You get no cheese in this cheese steak.  As the other reviewers stated, their food is bland.  Should gave gone to Wendy's just in the next stall.",pELl3JwZh-JYUEfRI7IXUQ,1,1,1,m7Jxj_ABvL0rb-5zvemoWQ

1013777,2015-12-11,0,742D-FQL6glg1ek71G4R2w,Terrible. The guy had an attitude that I wanted to buy a sandwich. Isn't that the point of having a restaurant?. Nobody has gone here in the past hour and I see why. They are failing as a company. Terrible service and terrible food,6Lw-GWCTIhJreHwbi9zpIg,0,0,1,p_Z7XeB4MmwJpQWPk8v6Pg
1479156,2014-01-05,0,742D-FQL6glg1ek71G4R2w,"This is the second place in the food court that I tried and I was disappointed again. I always love trying new Philly cheesesteaks and in my opinion its hard to mess up. Sadly, the meat was dry, the bread was hard, and it was expensive! I only had a few bites and threw the rest away....that's how bad it was.

After trying a few places in the food court at Fashion Show, I've realized that it's a waste of money. Not only are they way more expensive than other locations (ex. Wendy's Subway, Panda Express) but the non chain restaurants aren't good at all. 

There are plenty of restaurants in the mall, I would recommend going there. Better quality and more food for your money.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,0,0,1,pyyWESIjp56fGcNtI9LHuA

2388862,2016-12-14,2,742D-FQL6glg1ek71G4R2w,Real Philly LOL!!! Im from philly and this place is an embarrassment. They should have the city name removed from the title. How are you gonna use a 25 cent slab of steak umm and call that real? And my total was 11.01 for a steak fries and soda which wasn't ridiculous for the strip market. The cashier wasnt about to put in the penny so i was going to cancel the order but then he said ok. Wish i did though.,ENdnuBDI_6g3Sb-msyS2gA,3,0,1,4Dx2yACVJhYgnYQeTDWB2A

The bread wasn't dry at all, and the sandwich had good portions of meat and grilled onions along with the cheese wiz. Only complaint was that it was pretty expensive.

No military discount and the girl taking order was not very social.

3935888,2017-06-07,0,742D-FQL6glg1ek71G4R2w,"A friend of mine was in town visiting and we decided to hit the food court for some lunch. Craving a cheesesteak, I naturally gravitated here. Upon losing myself in conversation, when I grab the second half of my sandwich, I notice a hair lodged deeply into the meat of my sandwich. When I returned to show the girl working the counter, she called her lead on duty over to inspect it, going on to try to blame me for the hair being there, as if I had pulled out everything on my sandwich, put the hair in, and placed everything (perfectly) back on. To be dismissed like that was incredibly aggravating considering I, too, work in the mall. He was hesitant to give me my money back, but then they only gave me part of the money back from my meal. I was, and still am, very upset and I will never return back. Once I went to work at my own location in the mall, I ended up having to go home due to an upset stomach. All in all, if I could give less than 1 star, I would.",FJrzhMTDWdxWsZZW4FozHg,0,0,1,w297KvSsC45JKxhhyCylgw

I asked for mushrooms, peppers, and onions and it still didnt have much flavor. I even drowned it in their ""spicy"" sauce. Nothing, which made me wonder what I just poured all over my sandwich.

The worst experience I ever had, bad service,I asked a sandwich with no cheese and after 10 mins I got my food and I was convinced there is no cheese,but it was there,i went back to the seller and he said its mayo,I am  allergic to any dairy  products and they gave my order with cheese even at the 2nd time when I told them I'm allergic...I almost got to the hospital and I will sue them soon..
