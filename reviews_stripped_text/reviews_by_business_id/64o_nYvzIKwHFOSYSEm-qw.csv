PRO'S: Pizza by the slice was relatively tasty.  The cafe was clean and nicely decorated.  The service was quick.

CON'S: Premade pizza by the slice was $3.95 each and they charged an extra $0.25 for the black olives already on it.  The pizza also had to be reheated. I ordered mozzarella sticks only to be informed that the deep fryer was broken.  There goes half the menu.",QWUCx_phlA-LNq8ykamQgQ,1,0,2,buOmxOQY7JqFY7QOKJRNFw

Not too late, but you're always anxiously waiting for your food, as was I. When it did get to the front door, and we could dig in, we loved it. We got the White Truffle Pizza and Garlic Knots. Both were delicious. We did wish the pizza had a little more sauce. It was good but a little dry, and the garlic knots could have been a little more potent in flavor, but all in all, it was all pretty tasty and I have  feeling we'll be ordering from here again.",KOG2PL2w0gEIh8kPZ41k5g,0,0,4,qU4-cONdh7DJ2H0L0tEf6Q

I had the daily special which was around  $8 for 1 pepperoni and 1 cheese slice with a soft drink. The pizza was really good. It could have been hotter but since they were trying to serve 28 of us I think they hurried the process a bit. 

The end crust was way too thick for true NY pizza but not a big deal. There was plenty of seating and the place was really clean. 

Some other people in our group were noticing that Joe's did not serve beer which is strange for a Vegas eatery so not sure what happened there. (They booze you up everywhere else in this town).

Another 10 min go by, 2 other customers had ordered and I'm still waiting for my pizza.

I was still a little full when I got home from a disappointing meal from the outlets and I already knew that I needed a back up meal after getting my gyro. So I went to a to this place which was really close by. I like chicken pizza and they had a unique one. The main components were something they called chicken paprikas, which I think is something they marinated and seasoned with, dollops of cream through out the pizza and I think little tiny amounts of mushroom? That's my guess...I believe that they left the sauce out on purpose because of the toppings but it worked out really well, just like other sauce less pizzas that I've had, surprisingly. Like I said I didn't eat it right away, so it was slightly below warm and although the mozzarella wasn't oohwy gooey anymore, it was still really good! Now that's a sign of a good pizza. Next time I have make it a point to at least take a bite while the pizza is still warm, to be able to know to know the difference and enjoy the experience.

The guy at front took my name, but ended up bringing it to my table instead and with plates already with it. Usually I have to ask these places for them.

However, I will never eat there or order from there again. This is a customer service review, or lack there of. I was thinking of the best way to take in this golden knights Stanley cup playoff game. I couldn't think of any thing other to eat than my favorite pizza, Joe's. The only problem is they don't deliver to my neck of the woods. But thank god for grub hub. I ordered my dinner from them at 6:26pm and my pizza eta was 7:10-7:25, not too bad. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Finally the clock strikes 8:00 and I'm hungrier than Rosie O'Donnell after 10mins on the stair master. So I give Joe's a call just to make sure everything is on the up and up. Well thats where my story sadly takes a turn for the worst. A young lady by the name of Sara (who turns out to be the manager) with a snarky attitude informs me that they were ""VERY BUSY, and received in TWO whole orders at the same time"" and then went on to say ""well yeah we didn't check our tablet, did you want us to cancel your order? Next time you can call us to order it for delivery"" I say ""well I'm sorry but I ordered on grub hub because you don't deliver to my house"" ""YES WE DO. MY delivery driver would've taken the order to you"" so I ask ""your driver works for grub hub?"" ""Well no but they deliver"" So I say ""yes please cancel my order"" then I pause and say ""I love the food here and I'm just disappointed with your customer service, I unfortunately won't be back here."" She then goes to say ""well I told you to order over the phone next time. I would say that I could comp your next meal but you said the you're never coming back so no use in offering that to you now, is there?!"" Wow just wow. Sad and hungry is where I am now.

In the store is a different story.  Thus, the reason for the two stars.  It was a favorite lunch spot for a long time.  We used to go to the location on Las Vegas Bldv. south and order pizza by the slice.  They had the same employees there over the years.  They had a very busy lunch crowd.  They had specials too where you could get cheese and a drink.  They have specialty pizza in the display for sale like chicken, Hawaiian, lasagna, and veg.  They would recognize us when we came in and make the visit fun.  

However, that all changed some time in the summer of 2017.  When we went there it was probably August of 2017.  I have not been back to the store for lunch since.  The regular employees were gone and had been gone for some time.  The crowds died down because they are running off all of the customers.  People don't want to be ripped off.  They have options.  There are actually about ten other places to eat within a quarter mile of this place and even in the same strip shopping plaza.   

The reason the place is empty for lunch customers is the PRICE INCREASE.  They raised the prices.  Me and my co-worker have quit coming after this.  Two people each getting two slices and a small drink during lunch and the bill comes out to more than $22.00?!. That's insane.  I have been to Joe's pizza by the slice . . . . .oh, I don't know, maybe more than 100 times over the years.  Always get the same thing.  Two slices and a drink for me and two slices and a drink for my friend.  I know how much it should be.  It never ever came out to more than $20.00.  Did you think that people wouldn't notice?  Then the price changed.  I said something and then the woman showed me my receipt and said this is the price.  Four slices and two drinks.  Looked at the receipt (don't remember what they raised the pizza to) but I do remember they jacked to small drink price to something like $2.45.  Really? Won't go back.  Are you kidding me?

She got the meatball sub and a cannoli and I got the cheesecake. The food arrived when they said it would and the nice little older Italian lady dropped it off and said ""you haven't ordered in awhile"" always a friendly interaction which is rare these days with delivery drivers. My Stromboli was the best I ever had, stuffed with meatball, sausage, peppers, pepperoni, mozzarella, onion and ricotta. Her meatball sub was great as that's what we ordered the first time so decided to stick with it, but I wanted to try and see what else they did so great. To our surprise, the sub always comes with a pickle and a bag of chips. Wings were great also and prepared just how I asked, crispy with bbq on the side, they also had celery and ranch on the side that I didn't even ask for. Paper plates, utensils, Parmesan cheese and Red Pepper flakes also included. She said her Canoli was the best she's ever had. I'm saving my cheesecake for later, but I already know that's good.

(Open invitation to anyone who wants to buy me ""good pizza"" to teach me the difference haha)
Anyway...I think 99% of pizza is good. It really is hard to mess up.
I think the only bad pizza I've had has been the school lunch pizzas they would give me when I was little. The cheese was oddly white and a quarter of an inch thick, uninspired over added tomato paste, and white as a ghost crust. Then there's the pizza where when the cheese goes cold it turns to really gross plastic. For the most part, I figure it's good pizza when it's almost as good cold as it is when it's hot. 
Ok...so enough about other stuff.
I think we got a white sauce ricotta spinach pizza.
I'm a meat lover but I was going to share this pizza and I know not everyone shares my love for meat (wink wink). I guess I've always been curious about non meat pizzas but always figured I wanted to get my moneys worth and go for the meat.
Pizza was really yummy...It was good pizza....i think....I wanted to get everything on the menu...it all sounded super awesome and so many varieties!
I think the only problem was that we weren't greeted or acknowledged...but that's the story of my life so maybe I shouldn't hold it against them. 
It's off the main strip on a pretty calm side of a mall lot and was like a mile from our hotel.

I was feeling like a calzone one day and wanted to try a place different from my usuals. A coworker always had Joe's New York Pizza and it looked good since I had never been I figured why not.  Checked out their menu online and placed the order for one of their 3 Item Monster Calzones.  The calzone was pretty huge for the price so I was very happy at first.  It was load with ricotta, mozzarella, marinara, and a ton of pepperoni, no exaggeration.  Only thing I didn't like about it was the dough was undercooked.  I was literally eating uncooked dough that had a little toast to it.  It's a good thing work had a little toaster oven I throw it in and went back to work, the room smelt so good.  I don't know if they usually under cook their calzones or if it was because I customized my calzone and didn't know how adjust for that, I don't know.  In the future I'd asked them to leave it in the oven longer.

I have to give them solid OK considering I could've gave them a MEH for undercooked calzone dough but I heard they have AYCE pizza during lunch or before dinner, don't know the details but that's cool.  And from what pizzas I've seen looks pretty good.  They have a good selection of items on their menu.

One of the good things here is they do sell pizza by the slice.  They have an assortment of pizza made and will heat up your choice in their oven OR you can have them make a pie to order.  My mom had a slice of the hawaiian, I had a slice of the mushroom and pepperoni, while my son had the pepperoni slice and garlic knots.  As we sat down and waited for our order, the couple next to us took their slice back as we over heard that there was a strand of hair on one of their slices. Can I just say YUCK! and what a way to spoil an appetite.  I debated whether my family and I should request for our money back or just wait and eat our food.  When I saw that their slice came from a different pie, we just decided to stay since we were really hungry.

The slices are generous; however my mom's Hawaiian was soggy!  She couldn't even pick it up to eat it.  She had to use a fork.  When I told the lady at the counter about it, she merely stated that it was due to the slice actually coming from a Pie that had just been taken out of the oven...ummm ok but I do recall having pizza to order and it not being soggy and thought to myself, ok if thats her story and she's sticking to it...so be it...LOL!  My slice was just ok and my son...well he oved his garlic knots and just took one bite of his pizza.

I will end this with, I've had better and will most likely not be returning to this place.  I'll stick to Grimaldis or Metro pizza.

Other than that my experience was less than adequate and the meatball sandwich my mother ordered was the most horrible sandwich I have ever tasted. I'm Italian, so I really think that I can give a great review on Italian restaurant. You normally add breadcrumbs to meatballs as a binder however the meatball sub here should've been called a bread ball sub. Tasted as if this restaurant was so cheap they added no meat to the meatballs. The bread which is to soak up the sauce and hold together completely fell apart making my mother use a fork to eat her sandwich. The sauce was decent in the cheese was good but for the price absolutely terrible. Now on a positive note I'm sure they have amazing pizza. It looked good and it smell good and the patrons seems to be happy, However I can only go by my experience. A meatless,dry, under seasoned, broken sandwich doesn't make for a happy hungry Italian mother. I won't be returning.",pkyX-J7RvQVIvFTZJKtpEQ,2,0,2,nzrSiq42d3XeGKepHKD5Xw

It's been months and the Za gods were calling me!  I walked in to an almost full shop, love the decor and seemed very clean.  

I walked to the ordering area and started to read the signs on what to order.  Tons of choices not just pizza a few salads to choose from, pasta, calzones, appetizers as well as many choices for pizza.  None of the prices were written down on the chalk board so as a newbie it made my ordering difficult.  Finally on the side wall I notice 4 lunch specials and all you can eat all with prices written down.  This was a cheat day but after noticing the size of the slices I decided to just wing it and order just one slice.  So I worked my way to the front and asked what a couple of the Zas were.  I don't know if I was taking to long but the girl wasn't friendly and seemed annoyed by my questions. 

I choose the lasagna pizza, a light thin NY style pizza with a nice amount of zesty sauce pepperoni, sausage, mozzarella cheese and either a ricotta or cottage cheese on top.  The dough had a great flavor I even ate the crust and the whole thing was REALLY good!  When you just order lunch or by the slice it is pre made then run through one of the ovens I believe the oven was a wood fire not sure but it had a nice smokey flavor to it but I didn't want to bother the girl and ask.  I would definitely make it a do over, I took a star away for not having any prices written down makes it hard to decide what you want when you feel you may be holding the line up, and for the slight attitude from the worker.  I would certainly come back for the great Za though.",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,1,0,3,ubWdSkRbMzeIRwl4PEKyFQ

I enjoy their pizza and have been in the restaurant and have also had delivery service several times.  Today I placed an order at 12:30pm.  The expectation that was set with me was a delivery time of 45mins to 1hr.  After a little over an hour passed I called to check the status.  The employee who answered the phone immediately gave it to someone else who let me know the driver was going to be at the store in 5 minutes to pick up my order and that he should be at my house in 10-15mins.  After waiting 30 more minutes I called for another status.  Supposedly someone did not take my phone number or address correctly and the driver was trying to find my condo which they've been to at least 10 times for me before.  I don't understand why they didn't just look at the phone number that called to get all the customer information they have in their system. 
I asked if they were going to deliver me cold food now or what?!  The guy on the phone said they'd make me a new order and get it to me in 30mins.  I asked if I was going to get a discount because of the negative customer experience that Joe's NY Pizza is giving me and also because I've now been waiting for over 2hrs for my food.  The guy on the phone said he'd give me a ""locals discount"" of THREE DOLLARS!  THREE DOLLARS ON A FORTY DOLLAR ORDER!  NOT COOL.  I've lived down the street of this place for over a year, ordered from this place several times, and now all of a sudden I'm getting a ""locals"" discount of $3 to make up for a shitty experience....c'mon man.

A major level of incompetence began as soon as I placed the order and for the management of Joe's NY Pizza to make me feel like this was my fault is simply rude.  After he said I'd get the ""locals"" discount of $3 (lolololol) I mentioned this was obviously not a good experience and that I was going to post a Yelp review.  He didn't care at all and said that my food would be delivered in 30 minutes. 

Too bad they treat ""local"" repeat customers in a such a negative manner.  No apologies, no discount, and no accountability.  Really not cool at all and am very disappointed.",JJVRvAP-UEYgm0SFtFfR3g,0,0,1,YZkUZcHt7eBBYJRxdWGx_w

I got the combination and every ingredient tasted like it was fresh from the store. The dough was crunchy, the sauce was mild yet flavorful... It was perfect. I tried the other pizza, tomato and basil, and it was good as well. A little skimpy on toppings but still good. 

After getting the pizza we decided to try the chicken alfredo. It was mild yet very seasoned. When I say mild I mean it's not too heavy on cream and butter, even though I think there's no such thing as too much butter or cream! For a light pasta, I really enjoyed it. There was so much chicken in there that the dish was actually heavy. I wish I could find this good of a value in LA! 

I really like the decor. The tablecloth looks like newspaper and they have old school brands on the walls. There's nice pictures everywhere and even a Statue of Liberty! Very unique decor. 

The bad? The customer service could be better. I've never gotten amazing service in Vegas so I don't know if it's the area, but I'm used to a little more friendliness. The prices could also be a little better. I understand this is premium pizza, and it's good and fresh, but $4 is a little high for Vegas. I expect better prices since this place is a ways away from the strip.

If you don't like grease, I suggest that you don't go there.
However: If you are a college student like me who only cares about what the food actually tastes like and not if it's healthy, then by all means find the nearest transportation and go, go, go!!!

I ordered the Joe's Favorite which consists of cheese, pepperoni, and bacon. The crust was soft, the slices were huge, and they were also easily foldable, so that the toppings didn't fall off!

Plus: It was delicious!! The bacon in no way overwhelms the flavor of the pepperoni. In fact: I don't know what kind of pepperoni they use, but it was like POW! Pepperoni Explosion!!! Sailing along on a boat of cheese with a zesty tomato sauce undercurrent.

I loved it, and I went despite all of the negative reviews that I read online.
(Some of these people don't seem like the type that have ever eaten cold leftover pizza for breakfast.)

So my fellow college brethren, THIS is the pizza for you!

The spanish chorizo pizza had bits of chorizo on it and to me wasn't that special, but I'm also not a big fan of chorizo, but it was still good.

The stromboli no matter what you get is delicious, it's filled with the right amount of cheese, veggies, and meat with the right amount of dough that it was delicious and tough to put down to make room for other foods!

We got hungarian bread, which I believe is just fried dough with a light sour cream sauce that had garlic and some other seasonings that I couldn't make out, but the combination was phenomenal! I don't think I can have bread again without that sour cream sauce. It was super light so even if you don't like sour cream or think it's going to be overpowering, it wasn't. 

Escargot pizza - well....it is what it is, snails on a pizza and I was VERY skeptical about trying it but I'm glad I did, it wasn't bad at all. My FIRST experience with escargot and I probably wouldn't order it on my own, but it is definitely something you must try at least once!

The garlic knots were soaked in grease .  I'm not talking about yummy garlic buttereyness but more if you melted half a stick of margerine and topped it off with a generous dose of vegetable oil.

Depending on how hungry I am, I'll also throw in a dessert item. For parties, I cater from Joe's NY Pizza and I always get the biggest pizza size which each slice is bigger than the size of your head! Always get rave reviews on the food when I get catering through Joe's. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE 

Excellent! I can barely think of a time when they didn't treat us well. However, we are locals that frequent the place. But, I think when you're loyal to a place they should treat you well! Both locations also offer delivery within 5 miles so you can order pizza to your hotel if you'd like. Their delivery service is also excellent. 

PRICE 
I Joe's NY Pizza is fairly priced for what you get. The portions are big, food quality is high, service and location are awesome and you get a pizza stamp card so after X-amount of pizza orders you get a FREE one.

TL;DR they don't dress like an employees of a restaurant and they ignore you.

First off:  The owner was sitting next to me as the following happened.  I arrive for a quick slice of cheese pizza for lunch.  You can buy pizza by the slice and they heat it up (like s'barros) but better.  Only two people in line and I order the cheese slice and the kid tells me he'll bring it out to me and sit down.   30 minutes later I go to the register to talk to the kid and he walks away from me and pretends to do something else behind the counter!  I sit back down and wait for him to come back to the counter.  He later comes back to answer the phone so I go up and stand in front of him while he is on the phone so I can catch him after he gets off.  I wait and he stalls the phone conversation.  I don't understand why he's avoiding me b/c I haven't said anything at all to him.  I was nice when I ordered too.  So someone who looked like a manager but was dressed like a cheap prostitute with her mammary glands hanging out asked me what I wanted.  I told her I waited +30 minutes for a slice of reheated cheese pizza and I would like my money back.

overall it was good...and quick serivce, once they finally understood what i meant.  but making me feel like i was out of my mind for ordering a ""pie"" ruined my first visit.  i doubt ill b back..i rather go to other pizzerias that claim to b ny authentic n truly know what a cheese pie is.",GZsDson951e0NKvWWMukGg,1,1,3,EP27JfeIHT2V9nt06EG1GA

Everything tasted amazing. The pizza dough has a great flavor and the sauce is perfect. Every sandwhich meal comes with a bag of chips & pickle included which is a very nice compliment to the sub. They also offer 9.99 all you can eat pizza slices from 2pm-5pm! Have dine in or out. They also have the soda machine where you can have all sorts of drinks! Haha love when places have that machine.

The mac n cheese bites came out quickly. We decided we wanted to dip them in marinara sauce, but my husband got a weird look from the person behind the counter when he asked for it. He felt uncomfortable. The bites were pretty good!

The pizzas came out pretty quickly too. My white spinach pizza was very good. The crust was delicious, and the mozzarella cheese was fresh. Two thumbs up.

My best friend is Hungarian and has raved about this place and the ownership (they are Hungarian). 
I am writing this review on behalf of her.
It was her first time at this location, she ordered carry out (she usually orders from Paradise location). 2 LG special with a 2 L coke which came out to $40 (not the cheapest pizza place). 
One pizza was spinach and goat cheese (brilliant) and the other, mushroom and roasted red pepper, no cheese. 
We got to her house, and the roasted peppers have seeds and are spicy. Not a little, but very. That pizza was for her daughter, who loves roasted SWEET peppers, which is what you get when you order ""roasted peppers"" anywhere else.

She called the location, to let them know they should at least let their customers know, ""Hey, our peppers are spicy, is that okay?""
Instead, she got someone on the phone who barely spoke english. He put her on hold, then a while later ""Alberto"" or ""Arturo"" answered the phone, and asked what she wants to order. Obviously, communication was lacking.

She explained again, what the problem was. His response was ""Oh yea, our peppers are mildly spicy"" and ""people don't usually have a problem"" ""we didn't know it was for a child"".... HORRIBLE customer service. No apologies, no ""can we remake it for you?"", no remorse, or even taking ownership of the problem. 

We have both been working in the food service industry for over a decade each and especially for Las Vegas standard this place is seriously lacking. Small businesses especially, can't afford to afford a customer base, because as we all know, one bad experience gets spread faster than a good one. 

This customer could have been saved by a simple apology. Especially since displayed by the cash register, was a signage that said ""Joe's is committed to pleasing its customers"".",9okCe8TP4eNzW01kocAa_A,0,0,1,vG-mvRfuHPfVn7rLMrtleg

Joe's is located on the South end of the Beltz Mall off Las Vegas Blvd (AKA Premium Outlets South). Next to 5 Guys burgers. 

Their lunch special is 2 slices of pizza (pepperoni or cheese) for $8 OR 1 slice (pepperoni or cheese) and a side salad for $8. Drinks are 1/2 off during lunch. 

We walked out paying about $18 for 2 people for lunch. Not bad, not cheap either. 
BUT!!!!!!!!!! This pizza is SO worth the price. And we only had pepperoni! There were more pizza selections and subs and sandwiches too. But pizza is what they are known for so thats what we had. 

The space is a little confusing but I'm here to clarify it for you all first timers. Since there is a ton of people inside, it may cause panic for some. So here is the drill:

1. Walk in and head to the front counter. 

2. Order your pizza (don't forget to ask about the daily special)  or meal selection. They will take the pizza slice if that's all you are ordering and heat it up or you in the oven while you pay.

3. Pay and give them your name to call it when your order is ready.  

4. Fill your drink up with their Coca cola mutli-selection dispenser. I love this! They have Fruit punch! 

5. Sit where-ever you want. Your name will be called and you can come get your order up at the front counter. 

6. Enjoy! 

We absolutely love this place. We were in and out, back at my desk in the 30min we have for lunch. The food was pipping hot when we got it and the Parmesan in their dispensers is REAL PARMESAN, not the fake confetti some places have.

Recently went to this pizza joint just before shopping at Belz, the South Premium Outlets. When I walked in, I didn't feel like I was in Vegas. It felt like a mom and pop pizza joint on the east coast. I liked the homey vibe and decor.

Few things about this place: 
- walk up and order at the counter.
- they have pizzas already made, order by slice -- they heat it up in the oven before serving it to you.
- option to order a whole pie, but it would be a bit of a wait. 
- all you can eat option, $9.99 
- punch card for single slices 

Ordered the Meat Pie by the slice, filled with toppings top to bottom. Layered with pepperoni, sausage, ham, meatball, topped w/ mozzarella & bacon. It's a thick & hearty slice, could easily get full off one slice. I liked it. Some slices were filled w/ spaghetti, which made it more filling yet not satisfying. I didn't like it. Prefer it without spaghetti. Don't rely on my photo, it looked bigger in person. 

It's an okay place. Try it for yourself. It's not pizza I would go out of my way to get or crave, so I'm not sure if I would be back again.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,6,3,3,RDthWFH1cFZonoj_CBwg8Q

They are perfectly cooked and have never been overdone. They have a nice doughy center and taste amazing. I normally hate mom and pop shops however when I first came here their pizza and sides were one of the best things I've ever had. Even their wings were great. Honestly for the garlic knots alone I would go all the time. 

However, the reason they have 4 stars is cause their service sucks. The employees are extremely rude and condescending. Even after being condescending one of the times they lost our order and we ended up waiting there for almost over an hour. Finally when I approached them they didn't say sorry they just still kept a rude attitude and gave us our food. I keep coming back because the food is great. But the service is really bad. It's been like that almost every time We have gone in. If the employees had a better attitude they would have 5 stars for me but if I have to rate the restaurant as a whole their employees make it a bad experience. 
The restaurant is located off of Las Vegas Blvd. have not been to the other location.

When I moved here to Las Vegas in 2007, this was a place I stumbled upon.  There was absolutely no pretense....a bunch of cool New Yawker guys just putting some pie together.  Some good sports on tv.  And, if you went at lunch, all the working class rolled in.  That is a good sign.  The last few years the guys were gone, the pizza did seem to have the same zip and then on my last visit (this checkin) it became obvious someone's mom took over the place.  Faux tablecloths, and tried to make it look all pretty.  Totally stripped the vibe of a local, authentic pie house.  Pizza was ok.

I tried the lasagna pizza at their suggestion as this was my first time and they had quite a few ready made pizzas available by the slice.

The toppings were great, the concept of lasagna style topped pizza is a great concept!
However where they fail miserably is the crust. The pizza crust is thin, limp, flavorless and soggy which does not support the toppings. 

I don't want anything that is limp in my mouth, especially when it comes to pizza! The crust was just bad, bad and more bad. No happy ending here :(

They all include drinks. Without the lunch special , prices were a little higher. The pizza slices were decent just a little too thin.

Well... today would be the very last time since it has not improved.

I placed my usual order of Greek Salad and had them add Grilled Chicken, Artichokes and Mozzerella.

I received the order quickly but as usual it was missing something. It happens every time though but I figured I's give them the benefit of the doubt and try again.

This time it was missing the Feta cheese which is standard on a Greek salad always. It even says this in the description on their menu of course.

Here is the actual listing from their menu: Greek Salad 
Greek Salad is served with Croutons, Cucumber, Feta Cheese, Field Greens, Green Peppers, Kalamata Olives, Pepperoncini, Red Onions, Tomatoes. 

Oh I forgot to mention that I added Artichokes and received 3 pieces, reallyyyyyy?
They did give a generous amount of chicken and the mozzerella was also good, but come on with the Artichokes. (just a taste) Oh and while I was eating the salad I noticed several rotten leaves of lettuce in the field greens in my salad, That also was a big stomach turner. So I am done!

So, I called back as I always do and explained that it was missing the Feta cheese only. The guy that I told this too puts me on hold and someone else gets on the phone and asks me what I would like? He said would you like me to bring you a lot of Feta Cheese or make you another salad. So he said I'm busy right now so what would you like and proceeds to rush me. They screwed up my order but now I have to pay the price? How does that work?

Anyway, after screwing it up last time I remember the girl telling me that this time would be free. Of course they forgot that part and I was charged again.",kOqcNFcpDl3h8vFNJ7FwWA,3,0,1,cNOVGLkqB9lFaNzEEgl9JQ
