8970,2015-10-29,0,E67gGK8yOn9kkNzx8FzQKA,"This review is for takeout. I'm a lover of BWW and this location is right by my work so me & my coworkers order out of here almost every week. Customer service is usually just okay, better when you actually go in, sit down and eat, especially in the bar. Today I placed 3 separate orders over the phone. When I arrived, they forgot part of the first order so I had to wait there for them to make it, in the middle of my work day. When I got back to work, we found I was shorted a ranch that I had paid for, and my coworker found that his wing order was short about 5 wings so we called in and spoke with a helpful manager, Daniel, who offered to remake the order. 

My coworker went back to the BWW to pick up his order and, when he asked for the ranch that they had forgotten, they refused to give it to him because it wasn't on that receipt.  Lol  are you kidding me? He mentioned it was on a separate order and they really wouldn't give him one side of ranch valued under a dollar. At this point it became laughably bad to just about everyone in our office. 

There are plenty of other BWW locations around the valley with awesome servers & hosts who treat customers as they should be treated, unlike this one. If you feel like wings but don't want to waste your time & money at this location, just go to the one on Durange since they're always great.",hBmJs49zYcXdV4wo8F5iiA,0,0,1,btYo90XQz6N_FZeDoYjuGQ

CONS:  Prices are high for the level of quality you're getting.  Speaking of which, the quality is not always consistent.  Some wings have no sauce or very little sauce on them after being tossed in sauce in the kitchen.  Buffalo ""chips"" that are described on the menu with a word like crispy is false.  They are usually greasy, floppy and soft.    They've got to be understaffed, because the service is usually slow, even though you see your server running around like a madman (or woman.)  Hate that they upcharge for an amount of sauce that should come with the orders (for 10 wings, you get 1 sauce and 1 celery or 2 sauces.)  Don't like that when you play the trivia type games, you have to wait so long in between each round for tons of commercials/ads.   When you get there for pick up after ordering online,  you'll almost always wait 10 to 20 minutes past whatever was quoted to you online.

When I walked in, I've never seen one an unattractive as this one. Basically a dark, crowded boring room. That's part of the reason I'm giving it one star, but the main reason is our server. He was friendly and upbeat, however he spilled an ENTIRE Pepsi on me-- It got me head to toe, not joking. It was in my hair, on my face, on my arm, jeans and even in my shoes. It tipped over on his tray and right into me. And as I'm sure anyone knows, when that stuff dries, it's sticky! So the rest of the day wasn't my best. 

He felt terrible, apologized profusely and was clearly embarrassed, so I wasn't upset with him- I told him it was an accident. We were all even joking about it to make him comfortable. I'm surprised, however, that when it came time to order my food, he told me if I wanted anything other than french fries with my wrap, there would be an upcharge. REALLY? I'm eating lunch sitting on a towel because you spilled a drink on me and you're going to charge me an upcharge??? When our bill came, he only comped the drinks, which surprised us all. I'm not the type of person to ask for free things, so we just didn't tip him as well as we would have if he did what we felt would be the right thing and give a percent discount or comp my lunch. He was a nice guy so it's just sad that he left that kind of impression on us with how gracious I was about the whole thing.",OTL9KNUIyTbIQeaKlHu-6A,0,0,1,BhfoyhOt1ykwmAdMfsnqmA

Last evening we ordered our normal 4 meals and had it picked up by Postmates. It was delivered. My son and I enjoyed our crispy tender meals but my wife was still at work. 

When she got home she was tired and ready for a meal and I had ordered her the naked tender meal. She has always been finicky about chicken but she had great luck with Buffalo WW in the past. When she cut into the tender last night there was a green color in the tender. It turned her stomach and said get your money back.  

I wrote an email requesting a gift card for the amount of her meal or refund for that meal the person on the other end asked for photos and I sent them. He then asked for a receipt and I explained that I had ordered through Postmates and they had forgotten the receipt but my order consisted of such and such.

It was couple of hours ago(5/23/2017), I went to this location to dine-in but the place quite busy because of Tuesday promotion which I didn't even noticed. I was too tired to wait and make an take out order. cashier Mechanzie was really sweet and didn't take that long to wait for pick up. Everything was so good by then. I came home and open the box and start eating. After couple of wings, I noticed one of the wing is extremely stringy. I felt something different. and pulled away and found clump of feathers. I was so embarrassed and start throwing up since I ate one of them. It was horrible and really disgusting. 
(I attached a picture which might hard to figure out since sauce is all over and feather does not look as we know. BUT this is FEATHERS!!!!! )After that, I called into location and same cashier forward to manager Daniel( I am not sure of his name) He said he will give me credit of 5 wings for next time but it is not what I wanted LOL. I do not want that experience at all!!!!!! I don't know if human can eats feathers but for me, I never heard of it.

625499,2014-08-28,0,E67gGK8yOn9kkNzx8FzQKA,"I usually can trust Buffalo Wild Wings to deliver a tasty black bean burger no matter where I am at the country. I have been to many Buffalo Wild Wings from the Pacific Northwest all the way down to the Southwest. This by far was my worst experience.

When our food was brought out my nine-year-old daughter noticed that her macaroni and cheese was cold. So we promptly brought this to the attention of the waiter. He was a great waiter and brought the food back to the kitchen. He returned shortly with the new bowl of macaroni and cheese. My daughter took a bite and again the macaroni and cheese was cold. So we sent the dish back to the kitchen and shortly he returned with a new bowl of macaroni. The third and final bowl of macaroni and cheese was adequately warm. It's a shame that it took three attempts to make one dish. He explained that the second bowl of macaroni and cheese was really for a different kid but they just took that bowl and give it to my daughter. So it wasn't even really prepared for her. The fact that they were going to serve a different child cold macaroni and cheese only hints at the idea that they are preheating all of their food and letting it sit out before anything is actually ordered.

 I took a bite of my black bean burger and instantly noticed I could not chew it. So I took the bun off of the burger and got out my knife and fork and tried to cut it. It was literally harder than a rock. The knife I was given would not cut through the black bean burger. I'm not even sure how that's possible. The middle of the burger was the only edible part. 

My fiancé ordered wings and a salad. The wings were completely oversalted. The salad was scary. It was brown and looked like the lettuce had been sitting on the counter for two or three weeks in the heat of Las Vegas. Needless to say he did not eat the salad.

I have to say that our waiter and the manager did try  to resolve the issue with the macaroni and cheese. Because it took us three attempts to get that dish resolved so that she could eat her meal we decided to just deal with our own bad food and we did not complain about what was going on with my burger or the salad that my fiancé was eating. The manager comped the macaroni and cheese from our receipt. However we still had a $40 bill for inadequately prepared and inedible food. The problem at this restaurant is not the management or the waitstaff. The problem is in the kitchen where the cooks obviously don't really care about what they're putting out of the kitchen.

Since May I think I've been to this location 5 times, and have had some minimal ups and downs.

Getting seated and situated is never problem, and neither is ordering, but once you get your food (which  takes longer then it should), it seems as though the waiter/tress just forgets about you and never stops by (and this as happened on a couple occasions).

As for the food - the wings are where it's at. They're delicious, and the sauces make them reach a level no other wing has reached. 14 delicious sauces, and they can also be used with chicken tenders, sandwiches and so on.

So besides wings (and chicken tenders), I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which I was really excited about, as I love pulled pork, and it came with the hot bbq sauce as well. But when I got it, it was a disappointment. The bread seemed dry, the sauce wasn't up to par, and even the pulled pork seemed dry! I learned my lesson, stick with wings!

Basically, you come here for those deep fried delicacies known as boneless wings.  I've tried the potato wedges, burgers, wraps, and salads, and all are average at best.  Don't waste the stomach space.  There are many sauces to choose from, my favorite being the spicy Mango Habanero sauce.  

Here's what you do:  

Call in an order of about 20 boneless wings just for yourself on a football Sunday.  Make sure nobody is home of course, this is going to be a shamefeast.  When you return with your saucy bounty, close the curtains, lock the doors, and get carnivorous.  Nobody likes a quitter, so just like a marathon runner you'll have to push through.

FAAAAAILURE!

Went here with hockey buddies after a game and we wait for 30 minutes in a packed, small waiting area.  When we looked into the restaurant, there were tons of empty tables... I'm talking like 10 to 20 tables.   meanwhile my stomach is empty as hell and screamin' for some food.  We waited and waited and finally got in after about a 30 minute wait....

While we were seated, I watched the other less fortunate souls waiting with puppy dog eyes at the front waiting area, as they stared in amazement at the 20 or so empty tables and no servers seating anyone.  It was so blatant and wrong yo!  It was like waving a pork chop in the front of an Ethiopian kid.  Exactly!  Soooo wrong.  

So finally the food comes out after a super long time.  When my burger comes out, it looks like a puck that I just slapshotted in my hockey game!  It's totally freakin' hard as a rock and the fries are old and have been sitting around.  Oh hells no.  The crazy thing is that I'm so hungry I wolf this thing down in about 5 seconds.  Don't lie, you know you have done the same thing...  lol  

This place was a total failure.  I doubt this one location is indicative of the entire chain... but be warned, the servers, waiters and managers do not give a shit about you, the food or anything else in between.  Where the hell is the zero stars option...

Beer selection is pretty good. Everything from your mass domestics, to some craft. Try a Sierra Nevada or Sam Adams Boston Lager with something really spicy. It'll change your life.

Bathrooms are amazing! Each standing stall in the Men's room had a TV. Nothing better than watching TV while you finish up.

Also, the best part? PLENTY of TV's. My friends were more interested in the Laker game, so they watched that, while I watched the Jazz game. We all sat at the same table, and were still able to be social with each other because we were surrounded by TV's.

Their hiring process must include a Plinko Board. 

Bottom Line First: Buffalo Wild Wings has boring food that apparently takes 12 minutes per wing to prepare, a crap beer selection, which is way over prices,  and customer service training comparable to the Nevada Highway Patrol. 

If you like wings, don't eat here.
If you like your friends and family, don't bring them here.

My next Yelp! List will be PLACES THAT ARE BETTER THAN BUFFALO WILD WINGS.

I have been to this Buffalo Wild Wings about 20 times in the last few years. My friends in the area love it, so we go frequently. Every time we visit this location, everything goes wrong. 

I came here for a friend's birthday party and I kept my mouth shut while in the restaurant as to not create a scene. 

Our table waited 50 minutes for the wrong food to come out twice. I ordered to go, as I had to leave the party for work. I even paid when I ordered. Our server, shorted my  change and still stressed that gratuity was not included in my total. I didn't make a big deal over it. Every time she came over, she said that mine should be right out. I wanted to cancel it, but again, did not want to make a scene.

I pointed out a bag that had been sitting by the register for 20 minutes. It turns out that this WAS my order. She had it remade, which made me really uncomfortable. 

She tried to make a joke out of it, not understanding how difficult it is for me to not be mean sometimes. She did not offer to refund the food cost or offer anything additional either, she just said ""well you have somewhere to be, so get out of here.""

The food, which I had to eat on my rushed drive was spilled all over the bag and was not hot. The napkins in the bag were soaked from the spilled sauce. It was the typical, half-assed Buffalo Wild Wing garbage food with no veggie sides.

Now, I have been to Bw3 before, so I knew what I was getting myself into: mediocre but cheap food and wings, but a million TVs/cheap drinks. If that tradeoff doesn't seem like what you are looking for you probably want to go elsewhere. 

I will say that the TV situation was a little out of control. 90% of the TV's were showing hockey (bleh) or baseball (boring) which I didn't even know were still sports. The sound was also on the hockey play by play which is super interesting except the exact opposite.

I love Buffalo Wild Wings, I really do, it has been my go to restaurant EVERY SINGLE TUESDAY for the past 5 years. I always go to the one on the North side of town, but this time, my boyfriend and I decided to go to this one-- bad move. A week prior to today's visit, my boyfriend ordered take out, when he picked it up, they didn't verify the order with him, but he assumed everything was okay, so once he arrived home with it, the order was completely wrong. He had ordered 10 wings, but they gave him 5 and STILL charged him for the ""10"" wings. We got a basket of fries, they gave us a regular sized one and again, charged him for a basket. Not only that, when we picked up the boxes the bottoms of the boxes were WET, I have absolutely no idea what it was, but really...? I called to complain and the girl on the phone said, ""No, impossible, the boxes couldn't have been wet."" So she assumed I was lying. I asked to speak to a manager, and he gave us $30 food credit. Today's visit was decent up until I brought up the credit to the server. Before she brought us our bill, I said ""excuse me, I believe we have store credit for our food here."" And responded with a bad attitude saying ""What do you mean store credit?"" And I said ""We have credit here due to our poor visit last time, our food was supposed to be paid for."" Again, with her horrible attitude she said, ""Yeah, well we don't do that here."" At this point I was enraged. I laughed and said ""Are you serious?"" She laughed back at me and said ""Yeah, you have to pay for your own food."" She realized I was angry, and then walked away to talk to her manager. When she came back, she said ""You guys are all taken care of, have a good one"", and I said ""Why did you tell us that we didn't have credit though?"" And she said ""I didn't know that we did that""- I scoffed and then she did too, rolled her eyes and walked away. I didn't leave a tip or thank her because she didn't deserve it. I still have credit there, but I would rather starve than eat there. Worst experience ever.",0rHu6d6oDEqQDFrEkgMq6w,3,0,1,TFLYl1HXZg2E3h1OKUnTDg

here's my review of another BW3 -

ah yes - the ""other"" wing mega chain - BW3s - so good.

since ive been introduced to Buffalo Wild Wings about 4 years ago - i have longed for one to arrive in san diego - but prayers unanswered, i have to settle for this treat whenever im in the midwest, or vegas.

i enjoy the the traditional hot, spicy garlic and carribean jerk - but the king of all sauces is the ASIAN ZING! wow. simply outstanding. they have expanded their menu a little - and have added new sauces like the parmesan and mango habenero - but i really like these new naked skewers - much healthier options...

but who are we kidding right? hook up the 18 wing combo with some fried mushroom caps - and its on - BW3s rocks my world. thank you.

oh and btw - did i mention that the place is littered with big screen TVs and rock and roll music - perfect for those wanting to see ""the game"" (any game actually since the invent of the satellite).",25NDlYy0wzjq7mh3IiCp0Q,1,1,4,FkPGjN9gAgPKE8q5Ft0fbQ

I haven't eaten here in 4 years because the last couple of times were gross, but I decided to give it another try and after tonight, never again Buffalo Wild Wings. 

We ordered 15 spicy garlic and 15 Asian zing traditional bone-in wings, large fries, veggie sticks, and 3 ranches. The quality of the wings seemed lesser than those of Wingstop; they were small, tough, and over cooked. The spicy garlic sauce was a typical hot sauce with a bit of garlic flavor and the Asian zing was sweet and boring topped with red chili flakes. Although neither of which were actually spicy like their names implied, I definitely prefer the ""spicy"" garlic. 

The large fries looked like a medium from McDonald's. When we order a large fry from Wingstop, I've had 4 adults and two children work on it but never managed to finish it whereas my husband and I alone were able to kill these fries. The veggies had really stringy, strangely bright green celery, and baby carrots. The tiny ranches, which cost 60 cents each, tasted like they came from a bottle of Hidden Valley. 

When I pulled up to pick up my food at 8:30 PM, the place was packed with people parking in the adjacent desert. The girls in the front tilted my box of Asian zing on the side so all of the sauce spilled over the boxes and the bag. Since I haven't eaten here in so long, I thought that the box was holding something which should be stood vertically, but if I worked here and saw to-go bags going out constantly, I would have noticed it and fixed it. So I guess some people like to come here for the scene and the game, but if you're looking for a good wing meal to-go, this is definitely not the place to get it from.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,1,1,4lJ45Kx8ZQSr9poprD1UMA

My husband was game, so we headed to the BWW on Hualapai.
Recently a wings place, which shall remain nameless, STOPPED selling traditional side dishes we liked. They STOPPED and so we STOPPED taking out their food, though their WINGS are fine, but STOP messing with our sides. I mean, seriously: STOP!
We were seated immediately at BWW. The parking lot was full and the place was hopping! Families, kids, and seniors like us. 
Server was johnny on the spot at our table, knowledgeable and friendly. Savannah had our drinks (a tall, very good Hefeweisen and a pretty good IPA from Washington state) and some roasted mushrooms, which turned out to be fried. I recommend that the pieces of mushroom actually contain more mushroom than just batter pieces without mushroom, but they worked enough in there that you could at least get 7 real mushrooms in the entree for almost $7.

We were a fairly large party with 10 people and the employees did their best to seat us all together since it was a little packed due to an NBA playoff game. When they seated us, we had an awesome server named Josh. He was super friendly and helped us all throughout the night, taking good care of us. The food always takes a while to come out of here, due to it needing to be fried, tossed, etc, but he let us know and of course we were ok with it. The wings came out fresh and amazing, like always.

My colleagues and I were quickly seated. The layout of the restaurant is nice and spacious with numerous large TVs lining the walls. The servers and bartenders are extremely friendly. They offer electronic trivia. When I asked for an extra side of sauce to go with my boneless wings they complied without charging me. They did however mess up my coworkers 'well-done wings' order, quickly fixed the mistake and comped his meal. If you are a Sriracha fan, they have a new wing sauce you can try dubbed 'Sizzling Sriracha!'

Lastly, they offer two weekly specials: Wing Tuesdays(discounted regular wings) and Boneless Wing Thursdays(60 cent boneless wings).

The Soft Pretzels are pretty bomb with the cheese and mustard sauces too.
Service was quick and very personable at this location.  We ordered a few of our favorite flavors-Garlic Parmesan, Asian Zing, and Salt and Vinegar.

Sports fans can watch the many screens of various games going on, and even on a Tuesday night for being very busy, our orders came out in a timely matter. Huge tasty wings, great flavor in every bite, I've never been disappointed in any BWW visit.  ALOHA!!!

It's not every server here, the ones who have worked here for a while aren't bad.. but this location has such high turnover that it's ridiculous. The new staff is always rude.

Today was the final straw for us to come and sit and eat at this location. We'll gladly take a 5 minute extra drive to Warm Springs. They are super close to my house so I would still use them for take out, because the double check the orders before you take them home. At least at home I don't have to deal with rude servers.
Tuesdays are busy, we understand, but we asked for a booth and we waited our time for it. They sat us at a table and we had stated that we requested a booth and had pointed to an open booth that was just being cleared. The gentleman than stated that the booth was for a party that had just walked in the door and put their name on the list WELL after we had been waiting.

We had asked how that was so when we had been waiting and he brushed us off and had us seated at the table right near the door. This was unacceptable. We saw another booth being cleared and requested to change to it immediately. Finally, they obliged. At this point, the waitress seemed annoyed and barely came back to check on us. I never received a refill on my water (ridiculous).

I know wing stop appreciates there customers and would have gotten wing stop but they are closed.

We were seated quickly, then waited 15 minutes and no one came over to us at all.  I know it was 15 minutes because I checked what time I checked in on Yelp (handy little app).  Also, a table that sat after us had already been brought their drinks.  I went over to the hostess stand where a manager was actually standing and asked him if the waiter knew we had been seated.  His response was an annoyed, ""Yeah, we're getting ready to send someone over there.""  You're getting ready?  For 15 minutes?

So finally our waiter, Ronnie, saunters over to the table and takes our drink orders.  Then he shuffles away.  The drinks come....and he forgot my friend's Shirley Temple.  We'd like to tell him but he ran away as soon as he dropped them off even though we were ready to order by then.

We finally order when we flag him down and remind Ronnie about the Shirley Temple.  And we wait........then we ask the hostess to go get the drink because, what do you know, Ronnie forgot it again.

Now, I don't want you to think I'm being a bitch and this was just a fluke service accident.  So I offer you this other evidence: the couple sitting behind us pulled a manager over because they were having the same issue.  In fact, they set a freaking timer on their phone to prove how long they had waited.

And then there was a third table beside us who complained about a missing beer and had the manager come over.

Hmmmmmmmmm, if three tables in the same section are having issues with the waiter and the amount of time it is taking to even acknowledge customers....don't you think they'd call in more people?

The horrible service left us in a bad mood as we left early at the half.  We would have stayed to watch the whole game and ordered more drinks and food, but, sadly, Ronnie was no where to be found.  So we left and took our business elsewhere.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,2,1,1,OzB7ZixLZ3EJqGh7rjVnjw

My friends Amelinda L. clued me into their boneless wings Thursday special and I decided to do take out last night.  Boneless wings are $.60 each on Thursdays.

It's only about 3 miles, so it's not a drive for me to go here.  I din't order online or phone my order in.  When I got there, the young woman at the register walked me through the process and answered my questions.  A minimum of 4 wings per flavor must be ordered.  I ended up getting 6 spicy garlic for my wife and 6 of the classic hot for myself.  I also ordered a basket of fries which she assured me was great for two people sharing.  She was correct!

The cashier told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I started to play Angry Birds and before I could swear twice, the order was ready.  It was probably 5 minutes maximum.  I brought the order home and we dug in.  I was so hungry that I forgot to take a photo of the food.  Next time.

The wings were very good and the sauces were just right.  There was a nice bite to my lips from the hot sauce.  The fries ameliorated that heat a bit and I had a nice mug of iced tea at hand.

I am a fan and I think I'll come back here on a Thursday again.  For less than $14, dinner for 2.  Not bad at all.  And tasty dinner for two.  And, I didn't have to cook!

I'll make this a quick review as the name really speaks for itself. I've been coming here with friends for quite a while. 

The menu is pretty extensive with plenty of wings to choose from. It also has salads for the non wing eaters and my new favorite Pizza Pockets that ain't to bad.

This business nearly splits in three different sections. 
1) a sit down booth and tables area, where they have a few large TVs. Mostly for the family. 
2) A massive wet bar where you have poker machines with high tops tables surrounding. massive TVs are placed all around the bar so you won't be able to miss a game
3) An entertainment room for birthday parties etc. This room also is used for alot of fantasy football and baseball fantasy leagues to draft from. They can supply you a tv for your use.

BWW is great, the service and food is also at a high standard and it has been very rare that something has gone astray here.

Also on big game days like Super Bowl etc it's gonna be packed. There is always some special on wings and beer. For sure a place to visit.

Overall
Food: 4-5
Drink: 4-5
Service: 4-5

I dined there last night after a few drinks at PKWY. We sat in the bar area and the bartender/server had very little patience for us while ordering (even tho the bar was fairly empty). After I ordered, I just asked if he can make sure we have carrots and celery, and I always ask Bc servers have forgotten about them before and he very rudely said yeah, they always come with it. So the food comes out, and he checks on us once. As we were finishing up, we asked for boxes, which took him a while to get bc he was on his phone before giving us the boxes!! then he constantly kept checking on our checks to see if they were ready. we had 2/4 payments out and the other two were getting their cards out and he didn't have the patience to wait just a few seconds. And I KNOW they do military discount but he couldn't give us it bc there was ""no manager present"", which sure that may be true, but it makes no sense to not honor it.. what if he had a void, cuz I know those need a manager for that?? And even if that was the case, he was very rude about it and we had 3 members in the group in the military..

I understand most people don't like to deal with ""drunk"" people but we werent even drunk or rude. Just a few young adults tryna get some chicken wings. So if you're in the area coming past 11, I would skip the place entirely if you don't want an asshole aka Michael taking care of ya!

more than 8 non-spanish channels on my TV.

So, that's why whenever the Blackhawks are playing, or the Cubs are getting ready to lose I'm here.  There's tons of high screen TV's that are always on sports, a bunch of beers on tap, and great wings.

The service is always pretty good, but when it gets a little busy you'll get a bartender asking if you want another drink right after you ordered one from the last guy.  Let's be honest, though...that's better than the alternative where you sit for 10 minutes before the bartender even sees you need another drink, then asks 3 minutes later if you want it (I'm looking at you Kona Grill).

So.  It's got pretty good bar food, even if you don't like chicken wings, and fairly okay priced drinks ($3-$6, 8-9 for the fancy lady drinks with fruit and flavored vodka, etc).

-1 because only one game can be on sound at a time, and it generally winds up being the game the biggest idiot in the bar wants to watch.  Also, because they ditched the Chicken Caesar Salad and most of the other ""healthy sounding"" food items my girlfriend liked.

I went on a Thursday while the Raiders & Chiefs were playing and they were having a boneless wing special. The place was pretty busy, but they had plenty of spaces for everyone. 

I like how the bar is located further to the back of the restaurant and the numerous amounts of available seating.

4264516,2016-06-23,3,E67gGK8yOn9kkNzx8FzQKA,"My Husband and I have been coming to this location since late 2004 when my husband and I just started dating, before I moved here, waaaaay before smart phones were the norm and Yelp had an app on smart phones-- you had to go on your phone web browser to access Yelp... Long time right? And on my most recent visit to this location on Tuesday, 6/21/2016, I dec'd that was going to be my last visit to this location and here's why...

I just got out of work, it had been a stressful week and it was only TUESDAY and I wanted to have an adult beverage or 5. We walked through the doors at 6:30pm and at this point and I knew that HH ended at 7pm so there was not much time to order at HH prices. We did not realize that there was a soccer game on the tele and the place was not boxing match or football busy but mighty busy for a Tuesday. We opted to sit at the bar and we were able to snag the last two seats next to one another and luckily they were the cushy chairs.

Around 6:45pm we placed our orders for drinks and food. I ordered a beer and street tacos via HH menu and hubs ordered a water and 6 wings. T'was 6:57pm and I tried several times to grab the attention of our server/bartender behind the bar to place our orders before HH ended but... They were sooooooo behind on drink orders that they had 2 people manning the draft beers (they were in such a hurry that those beers had so much head, it was gross), one being one of the managers from what I could tell. Needless to say, I was not able to get another drink before HH ended. That's fine, not angry, I ordered food and I'll be happy once I consume it. 

Now it's 7:25pm... No food. Being as hangry as I was, I grabbed the attention of another server/bartenders and let her know what was going on. She proceeds to tell that ""we're noticing that it's taking about 45 mins for food."", no apology, no heads up 20 mins ago, no comp drink, NOTHING. Hubs tells her that ""we'll pay for the beer"", she tries to tell us the food should be out soon but we're not having any of it anymore, this is fucked up. I'm hangry and at this point, so is my husband. Our server/bartender gives us tab for $4+, he leaves a $5 and we skidaddle. 

We've been here to watch football, basketball, baseball, boxing matches, UFC fights and sometimes just to eat and not watch anything at all. There were times that the place was filled to the gills, people were shoving people for space (in the bar) and people would get into tiny scuffles w/ one another from there being no space or simply from being liquored up, one time someone tried to fight w/ the manager. There was a time when some idiot was so drunk he dec'd that it was a good idea to grab me where he shouldn't have... And yet we returned no matter the experiences we had w/ the riff raff bc the service was always on point. My husband and I have become friends w/ some of the servers (some who no longer work here) so this day was a real ""WHAT THE FRACK"" experience. We're not coming back, not even for late night eats/drinks which was always my favorite. Not one time for as long as we've been coming here in 10+ years have we experienced such shitty service, never rec'd our food, and not one person was apologetic about it. I mean, the server/bartender spat out a very forced ""sorry"" but by the look on his face basically said that he didn't give a crap. 

This was THE worst experience we've ever had here and will NOT come back.

We went in and got seated pretty quickly, it was 3rd quarter in a game so I figured the food wouldnt take forever... I was wrong! The waiter was initially good but quickly started to suck. He brought out our food and never brought us silverware or  ranch. I flagged him down 20 mins later, and his response was that "" I keep forgetting I have a table back here"" my son was sooo hungry he started eating with his hands! He ended up bring out fresh food and silverware.. FINALLY.

Our bill came and I asked if he could take off a meal since it took FOREVER and he went and asked. He came back and told me that his manager took off our to go order and that he would comp our appetizer. He then said ""your bill will BE LIKE 23$"" I gave him two 20$ bills and he was off. I could tell he didnt know how much change to give me but he brought it back and quickly walked away. Inside I found 7$!!! 7$!! OK our bill was initially 31$, I shouldve got back 9$ but since he took off and comped me it SHOULDVE been  A LOT CHEAPER. From my calculations, he took off 10$ for the to go and 5$ for the app, that would only be a 16$ bill. I figured ehe really didnt cover the app, which is why it was 23$

I spoke to the GM and he was freakin oblivious, and offered me a 25$ food credit. I was sooo pissed, the waiter basically jipped me for 17$!!! The managers response was that he couldnt do anything about it... so hes letting his employee STEAL MONEY FROM A CUSTOMER? At this point I was soooo mad I wanted to cry, I ended up leaving and telling him to teach his employees basic math. I called the next day to speak to another manager, who was not helpful, and he said the GM I spoke to was higher up and I was welcomed to come and talk to him... OK, I live on the other side of Summerlin?! I'm not driving AGAIN over there to get something fixed that shouldve been fixed LAST NIGHT.

There are huge televisions on practically every wall playing sports but if you are like me and not into that they have these game machines at the bar. These aren't the poker machines which bore me to death ( they have those too) but they were just fun video games that were free.

I have been to this particular location just three times. The last two times were based on the fact that this is the closest location to my parents' house and this was the best location to meet friends that live further north. 

What's there to hate anyway? Mostly decent food, 24-hour dining, more TVs than I can count, sports sports sports, and quick service. I go to BWW when I have a hankering for chicken wings (or to watch a game and hang out with friends). But that's pretty much it. Their food is not very spectacular and honestly, without their chicken wings (or those delicious potato wedges), the place would easily be 2-3 stars. So stick to the wings..and potato wedges. Not the fries or chips. Trust me.

My go-to menu items are boneless chicken wings tossed with their dry seasoning, Chipotle BBQ. It's so good. I prefer dry seasoning over sauces, so I was ecstatic when they introduced the seasonings. Along with the chicken, a basket of potato wedges with Cajun seasoning. It's amazing. With their ranch and veggie boat, I'm a happy gal. Sometimes we will order one of the appetizers, but nothing is phenomenal. On my last visit, I tried their new Garden Crasher. A platter of various raw vegetables (carrots, celery, bell pepper, cucumber) with hummus and yogurt. The hummus was not very good, but to get a platter full of fresh vegetables in a bar restaurant?

4723730,2016-06-09,0,E67gGK8yOn9kkNzx8FzQKA,"Oh how the once mighty have fallen...

Buff-Wild as I call them, used to be my go-to late night boneless wings venue since 2008.

The tasty flavors I loved like honey bbq, Asian Zing, and teriyaki, sided with favorite like pickle chips, mozzarella sticks, or garlic mushrooms, and washing it all down with a cold refreshing Diet Pepsi.

My bartender/server Brian always kept me in good sprits even when I was down always refilling my glass and stopping by to shoot the sh** whenever he was free to do so.

But over the last year, the service, the quality of food, and the pricing have all gone waaaayyyyy downhill.

Charging for condiments shouldn't be a ""thing"".  Ranch and bleu cheese shouldn't be priced if they compliment the meal.  It's like putting a price tag on the ketchup bottle at the table and charging $.25 a drop.  It's ridiculous.

The service at the bar has changed their staff so much now that they all appear to be tired college students that look just absolutely miserable and hardly even give you any kind of 2nd glance if you need something.

Recently I went there and asked my server for ranch dressing since she forgot it.

I asked her a 2nd time...

I asked her a 3rd time...

I eventually finished the meal without the ranch and when I got my receipt, I found there was a charge for ranch!  WTF?!

But, the be all end all of this was last night.  I thought I'd give it one more shot after having not visited the place in almost 5 months.  I walked in after driving for Uber around 3:00 AM.  The bar was empty and one guy was tending.  I asked for the garlic mushrooms and a snack size portion of boneless wings flavored honey bbq and Asian Zing.

The chicken was AWFUL!  It used to be nice and chewy and not so crispy and hard!  It was honestly like chewing down on sharp tree bark that you hoped wouldn't cut and slice your mouth!  The only saving grace throughout the ordeal was the Diet Pepsi I had to wash it all down.  I love Diet Pepsi so there's really no way that anyone could screw that up, unless it's been too watered down or it's just overly carbonated.

But alas, nothing good can stay I guess and whoever is managing now should've taken some cues from the crew that was there running the place from 2008-2014.  I think the best time was when that young blonde woman with the glasses was managing.  I don't know who is managing now, but it's definitely in need of a shot in the arm.

Nice knowing you Buff-Wild...thanks for the good times.",m8d1HYOCF8WCfO3AuwiJSw,3,0,2,MXTyuG9WelgFbH5f38ehtA

We politely asked if she could reimburse us for both fees since we were eager to pay but did not want to be charged unnecessary fees because of the broken machine. 

She got ignorant with us and made it sound like we were a pair of degenerates and offered to 86 us from the location & call the police for not wanting to pay....

We DID want to pay but we wanted to avoid excess transaction costs!!

No cover!  Score.  We get directions and head over.  We are not locals of Vegas so going west of the strip is foreign to us.  We have only gone as far as the Orleans, Rio and In and Out Burger and that is it.  But we get there in one piece and before the fight starts and that's all that mattered.

Entering at first, I thought this particular location was very small. But it was deceptive. The place turned out to be bigger. There is alot of walls separating the various sections of the place.
I'm glad to say the food and service was good. Eating with my family, there's usually a few quirks in our ordering. Everything went smoothly. Checked upon often and drinks refilled.
It is worth noting they brought back their unlimited wings & fries weekday lunch special for $12.99 for a limited time(Was $11.99 when they last had it year). Their Wing Tuesdays & Boneless Thursdays are now both $0.60/wing. Boneless used to be $0.60 and on Tuesday traditional bone-in $0.45 but they raised the bone-in to match the boneless price.

I love their sauce options and am a real big fan of the Parmesan Garlic. Being a guinea, garlic is my weakness. The only thing that lures me in even more is adding parmesan cheese to it. It reminds me a lot of the Italian Style wings we use to make at our old pizza place. They also have a great Mango Habanero that I enjoy, great for fans of spicier sauces. It's sweet and very spicy as the name implies.They have awesome buffalo chips when they decide to actually fully cook them. Often times they are slightly undercooked and that makes them just kinda Meh. I do take out from here more often, but occasionally eat in the bar area. 

The staff is always friendly and they get bonus points for being so helpful with putting Rob's tournament on the big screens with audio and everything. What else is pretty awesome is they have $3 Jack Daniel's, Domestic Drafts and something else after 10. Along with $3 appetizers. They also have specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If I remember correct they are special priced regular wings on Tuesdays and boneless wings on Thursdays. 

Sometimes I do prefer Wing Stop but I'm not passionate one way or the other. It kinda depends on what area I'm at. Also WIng Stop is way more of a takeout place, where Buffalo Wild Wings is the kinda place you can chill with friends and catch a game.

Also completely unrelated to the review, I really dislike calling this place B Dubs. I know the name Buffalo Wild Wings isn't short or catchy but that nickname is a pet peeve of mine.

Done the Blazin' challenge so many times I've ran out of space for the tee's.  I usually get the mango habanero sauce with my food.  Wings or buffalitos are always good.

My bf and I like to keep it casual, and stuffing my face with wings and enjoying a beer and watching some baseball on Friday nights is just exciting and relaxing enough after a week of work to enjoy. Gotta love the medium sauce! Mild has a lot of flavor without being spicy and honey bbq is pretty good too. Avoid ordering mixed drinks though, it's a waste of money because they're so watered down... so just get some beer. Who can resist beer and wings?

They used to include more that one drink if you were gambling, now maybe barely one on the house,maybe I ll just stay and play at Red rock station. Just not a great  time here, yes I ate my burger I was  hungry, but I doubt I would return for a long time, maybe next yr.

Well, we certainly regret our choice and honestly will NOT be returning. Aside from the staff being very in their own world, standing around talking and not paying attention to their section.. The food was lacking the deliciousness we remember  The sauce was used very sparingly with our chicken, our potato wedges were NOT cooked long enough (we had to return it). When we decided to just get to go boxes and leave, we found out that they changed their Tuesday deal from Traditional to Boneless, they didn't even say anything to us. We also learned they changed the prices, so you pay MORE for LESS. Not even worth it. 

As a mother, the most annoying part is how small their high chair is. My daughter is very small and could barely bend her legs to get in

I got them with Parmesan Garlic sauce which I really liked. I got to go back and buy a bottle for making wings at home. Got some fries, they were average skinny cut fries.

There are soooo many bars and restaurants in this 2 mile radius Soni had never been there before but my friends come here all the time and invite us over, well today I finally made the trip over and I will never come back here ever again. I met my friends up at the bar section and right as I got there I was carded by Kelly. She was alright, didn't have the most pleasant look on her face, she looked a bit stressed, a bit annoyed, but was still polite in her tone. She took my drink and food order and that was the extent of me dealing with her. Later I wanted another beer but she was not coming around so I ended up asking the next employee passing by if I could order from her. She said ""sure"" and I saw her go up to a tall skinny tattooed guy at the bar and say a few things and point at my group and then he looked at us and went to the register, got the drink, and came back and handed us the drink. Most of my stay there was meh (i wasn't offered water and my friends weren't offered water refills until someone asked which is unusual as typically servers are on top of refilling water) It wasn't until the game that we were watching was over and all my friends had closed out our tabs and tipped that this tall skinny tattooed guy named DOUG approached my friends and started yelling at them, literally raised his voice so loud  that the whole bar was staring and started yelling at them about how they were not allowed to sit there (at the bar) because of the machines and because they only played $15?! He literally said ""You guys are not allowed to sit here ever! You were told when you got here and you didn't play! This is how we make our money! And I can't tell you were to sit but you are not to sit here ever again for any games or ever"" AS IF THE $20+ THAT EACH OF US SPENT IN ONLY 1 HOUR, not including the generous tip considering their less than mediocre service,  DIDN'T COUNT FOR SHIT! He pretty much said he didn't care for our business even though my 3 other friends are  REGULARS (they are there every week!!!) Then he directed his yelling at me and my boyfriend and i who were not even sitting at a machine and who got there way after and whom he only interacted with when they got us 1 measly drink! And I will be totally honest, most bars, unless they are super busy, don't care if you sit at the bar and you're not gambling. If they do get busy and they have players that want to play, they will politely ask you to scoot over or will get a table for you to move to, NONE of the people working this bar did that or even mention it AND ALSO most of the people sitting along the bar were not playing either! I know this for a fact because I had made sure to observe it because I've been POLITELY asked to scoot to another seat before at bars like this but after looking at every one else, I thought we would be fine as there were  obviously many people  sitting at games who  were  not playing either! Including one couple that I observed just chit chatting the whole time who  got up, stepped outside through a side exit for 15 minutes, then came back to their seats in front of machines that were still wide open and available and we're not take. By ANYONE looking to gamble. And either way we were STILL paying customers fair and square! The whole way this asshole, Doug, approached us was incredibly unprofessional and rude. Shitty customer service and customer interaction. And you know what's funniest?! Prior to this review, there have been others who've complained about him too! Good going Doug, you just lost this already miserable location 3 regular customers and 2 new ones who will never set foot in this place again or ever even recommend it.",QCSsC1iOxQAm4dVui7i76g,3,0,1,OQgeZ6-9Tzep1YwUApiHAg

5840706,2015-03-14,0,E67gGK8yOn9kkNzx8FzQKA,This is based off my experience with getting to go food late at night after work. They answer the phone right away always friendly.  If I ever have to wait a few minutes longer for the food they always offer me a bottle of water while waiting which I think is a nice touch. Food is always made right.

However, I am reluctant to ever return as no one in the few times I have been has seemingly ever cleaned the bathrooms. The sinks are black with filth. Doesn't speak well for a place of food preparation hygiene.",CVHWOv724LWv6-M1fZPBKQ,0,0,2,PolXoLQGzylZvPUSo_oFzA

Never had an empty drink. Also... My ""lovely"" boyfriend left his keys on the table and she brought them to him.. then she saw he left his ring on the table as well and ran out a second time to give it to him.

I am always weird about giving reviews to big franchises like B Dubs cause everyone knows what to expect. This particular location does not have a host stand so I normally seat myself where ever I see fit. A waiter normally comes around. Seating at the bar calls for faster service of course. 

The cheese curds are so good! If you haven't had those, you need to order them right now! Anyways, just another B Dubs!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,2,3,4,Jh76QZ3iGh2Vha5lt3ZHiw

The mixed drinks were mixed poorly and the service was spotty. We ordered wings and some drinks and I didn't really like anything. The sauces weren't even coated properly.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,8,2,HtD0U_75O9zLzJEUJXDk-Q

You Know You're a Fatass when.....you're on vacation in Chicago and tell your friend you want to eat chicken wings and watch the football game and she takes you to BW3 and you fall in love! 

You Know You're a Fatass when.....you get back home, find yourself googling BW3 and falling into a deep depression when you learn your home state doesn't have a BW3 

You Know You're a Fatass when.....although you don't have any type of start up capital you dream of opening up your own flagship franchise BW3 location in your home state. 

You Know You're a Fatass when.....you realize the closest BW3 is in Nevada and become obsessed with getting your fatass self over there ASAP! 

You Know You're a Fatass when.....you're in Nevada visiting family and find yourself calling in an order for garlic Parmesan chicken wings and boneless buffalo wings and making your younger cousin drive you to BW3 even though you just left a restaurant and aren't hungry! 

You Know You're a Fatass when.....you're so damn proud of yourself for getting yourself some BW3 wings that you write about it on yelp to gloat. 

You Know You're a Fatass when.....the review you just wrote starts depressing you because you don't know when you and BW3 will meet again : ( 

I love you BW3... come to So Cal will ya??? Puuuuhhhlease!!! 

You Know You're a Fatass when.....you find yourself publicly groveling and begging a chain sports bar to come to you.

UPDATE: I'd like to thank the good man upstairs for answering my prayers. We now have a plethora of BW3's all over So Cal =)",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,12,14,4,4xO_JP1OEV0LY8hwFIU0JQ
