I love poke, and eating here, if you can get off the strip, beats anything you can find on the strip, especially the price. Everything is fresh (as it can be with it in the desert and all), and everyone has always been very helpful. You can always try samples of everything and the portions are great for different occasions ( picnic for one, multiple styles for a big appetite or more than one). 

 My first love here is the kim chee tako. I can make it a lunch by getting a pint and a water, or get a seperate quarter to half pint of seaweed salad as a compliment. My next favorite is the salmon, and I ask for them to add onions and shoyu sauce for extra flavor. This doesn't take away from tasting the flavor of the fish, with the onions giving a different texture.

Overall, a must visit for the poke lover. Can't be beat!!!",8ne2JH-bQEHYM237obA3ew,1,1,5,qPgvH1Lrdvf8Ig0aUrAdHA

They have various types of poke including pipikaula and dried aku.

Their spicy tuna is broke da mout!! Big chucks of ahi, not the ground up crap you find everywhere else. The spicy salmon is just as ono too! No joke.

I've tried a bunch of their pokes. The shoyu, limu and wasabi ahi are among some of my faves. They use fresh limu, not the crappy dehydrated stuff. 

They're reasonably priced at about $10/lb. Man, you go to International Market Place and you are paying almost $15/lb and they only have poke on certain days. 

Poke Express is a definite fave whenever I'm craving some really good and fresh poke! Not to mention you can get an awesome plate lunch at Island Sushi while you are there too!",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,6,6,5,fUJIkWDYOmy6NDFiFbpi1w

This Poke was different than what I purchased in Hawaii, but I assume this was higher quality stuff.  The stuff I got in Hawaii was just at a grocery store, and it was much smaller pieces of fish.  The Poke at this place are larger pieces-  super tender.  I personally prefer the smaller pieces, but can understand most people liking the larger pieces.

Warning-  no tables to eat at the store, also no tables outside (I believe).",yi9R6OF_-m-qkbV7Q_IJTA,0,0,5,yZ24S75kTdEKu4A1FQ_5qA

Wandered into the place having no idea what to expect due to the tented windows and was pleasantly surprised to feel like I was stumbling into a hole in the wall plate lunch place in Hilo Hawaii. They had some good hawaiian tunes playing which I thoroughly enjoyed. Walked to the back where there was a display case with a pretty good selection of poke.  Got 1 lbs of the spicy ahi ($18 yikes, but we are in the middle of the desert) and took it to go and ate it with my own coconut rice at home.  As far as poke goes if i was going to rate it as if I were back home in Hawaii I would say that it meets the Foodland grocery store deli quality, not out of this world fresh but well seasoned and the right texture. They also had a sign for Hanalei Poi on Thursdays which I would like to try with my poke the next time I stop by. Hanalei Poi is my favorite Poi and I'm curious how well it travels to Vegas.  I decided to give this place 5 stars based on the experience and the fact that the poke was decent for a land locked state..... not 5 star by Hawaii standards so as long as you keep that in mind its a great find!",r_39lId0m7z9Qa-73rxU1w,0,0,5,wkkIHJ5wVMBo5dGWTpqv2Q

When we asked for poke bowls, the friendly guy at Poke Express told us that they serve poke only but could sell us rice on the side as well.  We were happy with that, so we bought two types of poke, ahi shoyu poke and spicy combo poke and asked for rice on the side.  

Here's where things got confusing: We decided to order from Island Sushi as well, so after ordering from Poke Express, I went to the front to order from Island Sushi, while my husband waited to pay at Poke Express.  The guy at Poke Express said we could pay all together at the front at Island Sushi. The guy at Island Sushi then began to scoop our rice....so I have no idea if these two businesses are separate or together, but all I know is I paid at Island Sushi for everything.  Don't know if this information helps you or not, but it was confusing, ""So, pay here?  No pay there.  But rice here?  No, poke here, but rice at the front.""  LOL.  Everyone was super nice and friendly however, so it wasn't really an issue.  

Poke was delicious-fresh and creamy, so satisfying, I could have easily eaten more.  While we were there, a gentleman came in and ordered nearly 2 lbs of every type of poke they had and the order nearly cleared them out, so be aware, they may sell out before the day is done.

Poke Express is located inside this restaurant called Island Sushi & Grill (specifically located next to a Mediterranean/ Persian restaurant). Once you enter, just walk towards the back and you will see Poke Express. 

Anyways, when I walked over to the counter, I was immediately acknowledged and offered samples of any of the poke that I wanted to try. The man who was helping me was very nice and friendly. I ended up purchasing ~1 pound of both furikake ahi poke ($15.95 per pound prior to tax) and Kim Chee Mussel Poke ($7.99 per pound, prior to tax).

The Furikaka Ahi Poke is your classic ahi poke that was fresh tasting. The marinade had a nice savory light taste. 

The Kim Chee Mussel Poke surprisingly was not too spicy for me (I don't do spicy food like at all) and had a really great flavor. It was definitely my favorite of the two (my husband agreed). 

I also picked up a side of rice for an additional $1.50 (comes with 2 scoops of white rice). 

-------------------------------
(Total= $26.29, includes tax, prior to tip)

This poke lasted us for at least 2 meals each, which isn't bad for the price we paid. But I think next time if we come here, we will probably order a half pound next time since it was quite a lot for us. 

Poke Express has many different poke options, each of which are delicious (some are traditional and some are quite creative and new flavors I have not had before).

I've came to this location before as well as the other one, on the north side of town, but I've always had 1 thing lacking.... SPICY ! I saw at this location, they had a wasabi ahi (overheard from another person in line it gives a punch) as well as the spicy ahi... EXTRA spicy. 

Guy measured about of tuna with container in fridge and went to mix each one. After the wasabi ahi one was made, he started on the spicy ahi. Due to my order being EXTRA spicy, he pulled this small bottle from the fridge. I don't know what it is but I believe Thats definitely not what they usually use ! 

After paying, I left and of course couldn't wait to try it. Tried the wasabi ahi first. Oh man! Definitely packs a punch to the sinuses ! Wow ! Not expected to be that strong ! I like :D this one was mixed like a limu or shoyu ahi with sliced onions (which by the way soaks up wasabi too so that punched me as well totally unexpected!), as well as masago, and sesame seeds. 

Now the EXTRA spicy ahi (doh! forgot to tell him to put less mayo) for some reason, they put a lot. But aside from that.... Oh man it's spicy ! Woohoo ! A little lacking on the masago on this one :x sad. XD

From the main street, it was hard locating where it was in the shopping center but if you look closely at the doors it should have a small ""Poke Express"" sign on one of their doors. It's combined with Island Sushi so just spot for the huge ISLAND SUSHI sign above the doors. 

The inside is relatively medium sized with about 10 tables for seating, and I think it's separated from the Island Sushi eating area. You'll see their seafood serving area if you walk towards the back. Like any typical Poke place, there are all the different fishes/seafood placed in their respective trays in a cooled area with the price per pound sign by them. 

The person was very friendly and helpful, the area was clean and for the price, I think it was pretty moderate. I was all up on the Spicy Ahi Combo, it tasted fresh for the most part and almost like home, just not that exactly the same. 

If you're an ahi/poke/pupu/hawaiian local kind of person, you can't go wrong with Poke Express, because it's as close as I've gotten to good poke! They just don't do poke bowls bro, but you can ask for rice on the side! lol",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,2,2,4,kbUw1MB5jbd2UnteHRcn6g

The ahi tuna itself is delicious - definitely some of the freshest I've had but I wished I sampled it first because it ended up being really salty and I didn't bother ordering rice.

I was craving poke at the time because ever since I moved here a couple weeks ago and I know it is available I always want it especially because it is a tasty, nutritious and healthy meal. 
Anwyays when we walked it I immediately could hear the pigeon accents from the people on the sitting at the tables. It felt just like at home! The atmosphere is super casual and kinda a little messy with little pieces of rice all over the place/on the floor/tables just like Zippys at home lol. 
You wouldnt know they served Poke unless you walk all the way to the back of the store and you see a small container filled with poke. So many kinds: Hawaiian style, Limu, Spicy Masago, Kim Chi poke, kim Chi crab, Cucumber kim chi, etc. My friends and I grabbed a pound of the Spicy masago, a pound of the Hawaiian style, 1/4lb Cucumber kim Chi, 1/2lb of the Kim Chi Poke. I was really looking forward to trying to the kimchi raw cab but it looked kind old and knarly. Disappointed by that but the poke was fairly good. Kinda expensive. I think it was around $18 per pound, so total we spent about 50+ bucks on poke. We also tried the malasadas and mochkio chicken as well as the garlic chicken.
I know the Garlic chicken was BOMB. Fried and hot and crispy with just the right amount of spicyness and loads of garlic flavor. The mochiko chicken which my friends had we slightly overcooked and dry. They said they dont recommend it. Also the malasads were pretty good. Served nice and hot, but it wasnt the best ive had as Ive eat it at the best places on Oahu. 
Overall great place, good atmosphere, pretty authentic and they are supposedly know for their poke bowls. Super casual place and pretty relaxing to eat. I know the restaurant on the adjacent side of the express side gets PACKED.

When ordering to go, have them put the special sauce on the side. It can get salty if the salmon sits in the sauce for a period of time.  Make sure its their special sauce, not shoyu.

Choose door on the left and from here, you will first see a counter up front with desserts and a menu above you. To access Poke Express, you must go further down the hall where there is a counter with various poke priced around 10 dollars/lb and one has the option for sampling their bounty of poke in a variety of flavors.  Whoever came up with the term ""food porn"" probably envisioned poke as its monthly centerfold.  I mean seriously, it's pretty much glistening flesh that is scantily ""dressed"" with options including but not limited to wasabi, spicy mayo, limu (hawaiian seaweed), and shoyu (soy sauce)...quite a thing of beauty I must say.   

Since I biked as a marshall for the Rock and Roll Marathon, I was feeling particularly hungry and needed a carbo-boost post-ride, so I went with one of their Poke bowls, which has a substantial bed of sushi rice underneath the poke, but unless you're one of those folks from an Asian background where your parents threatened that if you didn't clean your rice bowl since the residual pieces of rice would pretty much resemble the pock-marked face of your future spouse, feel free to leave some of that rice behind.  Options for Poke rice bowl include the regular, with avocado (add 1 dollar), and DO NOT confuse the spicy ahi tuna bowl as poke....it is pretty much mushed up tuna mixed with spicy mayo that would likely get a 5 star yelp review if yelp existed for cats rating their food.  

I went with the regular Poke bowl and requested they add some chili sauce (the one with the green cap and rooster on the bottle, much more intense than Sriacha), since I was concerned the spicy mayo would overpower the natural flavors of the poke.  The bowl is served along with fresh sliced cucumbers, some marinated onions, and a few fried taro chips.   The poke had a very pleasing texture (chewy but not gummy), not overly seasoned, and tasted very fresh (may not be as good right off the island since the tuna was obviously frozen en route to Vegas).   My advice would be to stop poking your friends on facebook with flying sheep or watching that episode of Pokemon which induced epileptic seizures in young Japanese kids, go poke the person sitting beside you and come down here for some high quality poke.

One final note: for Spam Musubi fans, theirs is loaded with way too much rice much like their Poke bowls.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,8,4,4,LSvN4JE37Mupy_jZsDgd7g

But if you are looking for some little-fuss and much-quality Hawaiian poke with a lot of authenticity and warmth, then this is the place.

We had the Hawaiian Ahi Poke and Deluxe Fried Noodles and were satisfied with both.  Hawaiian Poke was very flavorful and had large pieces of very fresh fish: only $7.95 for half a pound.  Deluxe Fried Noodles was stir-fried saimin (Hawaiian egg noodle that tastes a tad like ramen) with spam, BBQ pork, and fish cake.  There could have been a little more meat and less noodle but it was still delicious.  I recommend putting a little Sriracha hot sauce on both, it adds a little bit of heat and a lot of favor.

I was already a fan, when I spotted their sweet treats on our way out.  I tried the banana bread, wow, what a familiar memory of terrific sweetness.  It is like the Vietnamese banana bread, but lighter in texture and sweeter in taste.  It is definitely my new favorite breakfast snack.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,5,3,4,ysGdxDu-hfZ0lPbbwhRy8A

It's cool if you have people who don't want the same thing as you.  Very casual atmosphere where you order at the counter.  Many different kinds of poke to chose from.  Would go there again.

They have various types of marinated fresh fish that you can buy to take home in this little market area in the back or you can just order a bowl of poke which I did.  It was pretty outstanding, not as good as Sam's Kitchen in Waikiki but it was really good coming from the mainland.  Do not get the Spam Masubi though.  Way too much rice, way too little spam.

Being a local boy living in Stockton for the past 8 years, any fresh poke, let alone fresh fish/seafood definitely gets my attention.  It was located inside of Island Sushi (which I didn't get to try unfortunately).  Upon walking in, there is a bakery case which they offer local favorites such as coco puffs, various local (Hawaii) cakes and pies (whole or by the slice) which is always perfect if you wanna try all of um! haha.  They also offer malasads, which I wanted my girlfriend to try since she hadn't had the pleasure to have the last time she was in Hawaii.  After ordering the malasads, we headed to the back counter where their friendly staff were very attentive and ready to take our order.  Their spread was pretty impressive for poke shop no where near the ocean.  Fresh ahi poke (limu, shoyu, maui onion), taegu, raw hawaiian blue crab poke, assorted tako poke, pipikaula, ocean salad, and much more.  We ordered just a 1/4 pound each of the ahi limu and pipikaula for just some pupus (snacks) as we were headed to the strip for lunch.   Upon paying, we noticed they had chantilly cake which we decided to grab as well.
In tasting them, the malasads were wonderful!  Nice and hot and delicious.  While not as good as Leonard's back home, they were very close to them, a little too much of the oil taste, but come on its malasads!  The ahi limu poke was great too.  Their seasoning was spot on, and the limu was nice and crunchy.  The pipikaula as good too.  Different than how I usually have had it, where it was more moist (wet) style.  I do prefer it more on the dry side, but it was great nonetheless!  The chantilly cake was pretty bomb.  Nice fluffy cake with not too much overbearing sweetness from the frosting (which really destroys some good cakes).  While it was quite of a juxtaposition with the poke and malasads, the bugga was good and definitely made me miss home even more.  Great local spot to fill up on your local foods.

If you've had poke before, then don't bother reading the reviews, go get some!

If you're on the fence about trying poke from here, don't be. Drive over, swing in and try the samples. They'll let you sample anything prior to buying it. Best of all, when they run out, they run out. No lowering quality just to make a buck. They seem to keep a high level of quality control.

I've gotten poke from here any time I'm in the area. I've never gotten a bad order or have been disappointed. They've even helped me pack an order for my family to transport to Colorado. Very good service.

Okay, is this place like eating in Hawaii? No. You're in Las Vegas. Surrounded by deserts. Tuna has to be sent here frozen, so taste will drop. That's not to say this place isn't tasty, because it is. Just realize that the negative reviews may be placing unrealistic standards.

And I definitely needed a good cheer-er upper. I decided to try Poke Express with the help of a friend referral (thanks Helen W!). 

First off, it is **LOCATED INSIDE ISLAND SUSHI** which is perfect because another friend of mine mentioned that Island Sushi was her favorite hole-in-the-wall sushi joint, and I've been wanting to check it out. So I went straight to the Poke bar and was seriously spell-bounded by this amazing concoction of chopped up sashimi. We don't have many Hawaiians in TX so this was pretty magical in my opinion. So many variations I had no clue what to do! Well I'm assuming I met the owner since he was referred to as 'Papa'. Let me just say, I might just repeatedly come back just to visit Papa. He was the sweetest man ever! He let me sample pretty much everything and got me full before I could even get to my order! If you're new to Poke like I am, it's basically chopped up cube-sized sashimi marinated in different variation of sauces. I saw a lot of variations of tuna, but also squid and shrimp choices. You order it by 1/2 lb, 1lb , and so on.

Of course I went for the salmon. I asked him to do whatever he wanted to it since I wasn't sure which sauce I would really prefer. Well easy enough the salmon already has it's own special sauce. I wanna say it's the Shoyu but not sure. He mixed it with green and yellow onions and sprinkled it with sesame seeds. LOVED IT. And the most important factor.. IT WAS EXTREMELY FRESH.

1/2 lb cost me about $7.55 & it was definitely a good portion for just one person.

Tips: Poke express is inside the Island restaurant. If you want poke go to the back counter display window and order there and if you want rice dishes then go to the front cashier. You can pay for it together in the front. They won't let you order poke from the front cashier. 

My favorite is the ahi furikake. If you want something cleaner tasting, try the salmon with special sauce. 
Garlic chicken with rice is also pretty good.",WsS7ojnDdX0VGsAx1AUoLA,0,0,5,ch9kKxoFC-Dn_OCUO7MLDw

We were getting tired of Aloha Specialties (shocking right?) so we ran a search through Yelp for another Hawaiian joint. They have 2 locations to serve the masses so chances are, you won't have to wait *ahem* Aloha Specialties *ahem*.

They have two sides to the restaurant, where one side is pay at the counter and the other is a sit down. Naturally, we stayed on the express side so we could satiate our ever growing appetites. Make sure you check out their poke selection. They'll let you sample everything. 

Poke -- We ordered the salmon and mussel poke. The salmon was chopped into small chunks and both were lightly flavored with soy sauce and chopped onions. What a simple concept yet so satisfying! All of the mussels were plump and juicy.

Saimin -- Order it with wontons! You won't be disappointed. Although Aloha Specialties makes the better version, Poke Express comes pretty darn close. They give you a ton of saimin, garnished with kamaboko and thinly-sliced spam. Their broth is very similar to Aloha. Simple and clean is how I would describe it. 

Spicy Ahi Bowl -- A nice layer of spicy tuna laid on a bed of white rice. It's dressed with spicy mayo, sliced cucumbers, and tortilla chips. A little too much spicy mayo for my liking but the tuna was delicious. They mashed up the tuna nicely but we did get some chunks here and there.

Poke Express is the perfect spot for people craving some delicious Hawaiian food with a time constraint.

3988073,2013-10-08,0,RBAcL6hg2yoaTRv0kKUjPA,"Ever since visiting Hawaii for the first time 3 years ago, i have fallen in love with everything Hawaii. The islands, culture, people, and especially the food. Living in Las Vegas we are lucky enough to have a wide array of Hawaiian restaurants. They don' t call us the 9th island for nothing i guess.

Poke Express is up among the top of my list. Located on Eastern. Prepare to take a nap if heading south and trying to make that left turn. Unbelievable how busy that street is. But located and adjoined to Island Style sushi which i haven't had the pleasure to try yet, but i will eventually. Poke express is more for Hawaiian favorites, a deli style case full of Poke, and a small case of tasty looking baked goods.

I have been here several times now, and give it 5 stars each time. The Poke section is one of the best i have seen. They have a good 15-20 different selections, made fresh daily. A lot of Tuna varieties, Salmon, and Tako. I like that they let you try samples before you buy. Most varieties run about $16 a pound and you can get the sauce right in the Poke or on the side. My wife absolutely loves the Poke here.

The Hawaiian specialties are all good. Big variety. Loco Moco, Ramen, Kalua Pig, etc. My little hobby has been to try everyone's loco moco. This version ranks right up there. They have a mini and a regular. Regular be prepared not to eat again till dinner. It's HUGE!! felt like 5 pounds i swear. The rice is cooked perfect, nicely done over-easy eggs, delicious juicy beef patty, and topped by very good rich brown gravy. My next time I would really like to try their bakery section. The guava cake looks delicious.

If you are looking for Hawaiian in Henderson, consider Poke express. delicious food all the way around. And it should be noted how extremely friendly and helpful the staff is. It makes your visit great. Aloha!",0grZ4N1UYPZmRvv3lXJuJA,4,2,5,bkCKpFtgts4_ppzfygVY3w

Overall, many flavors to choose from...

In the cold counter, you can pick your choices and even try some samples before you buy!

Got the spicy ahi and the flavor was good but it wasn't as tasty as Hawaiian style poke simply because it didn't have as much red onions and green onions in the mix... you'd be surprised that these little spices on the side truly makes a difference...

Service was good, but not as great as Hawaiian Style Poke.... 

Still expensive... but what do you expect for eating fresh sashimi?

When you are in the area, try them out!  But I think the winner between the battle of POKES in LV goes to Hawaiian Style Poke in Chinatown....  Don't fret Poke Express, you are not a bad choice by any means!

There were four items. The spicy avocado ahi was delicious even though I personally couldn't handle the burning sensation after a while. Luckily, the heat didn't linger. The furikake ahi was more pleasant in my mouth, and it had the more typical onion and cucumber mixed in rather than the avocado.

Next, I had the kimchee crab, which also surprised me with heat, but I loved the tender crab more than enough to tooth my way through several pieces. Finally, I tried the kimchee mussel and eagerly went back for more. Not as spicy, but about as relatively tender as the crab. Mussel fans should definitely try this.

The fact that you can get it in the middle of the desert is nothing short of a miracle.

This Poke Express shares space with Island Sushi & Grill; when you enter, the grill/kitchen is to your left, the sushi restaurant is to your right, and Poke Express is the refrigerated cases straight back. Like their other storefront, the service is spectacular and you can sample to your heart's content. You won't be sampling long, though, since you'll want to devour a pound of that magical fish ASAP. Order and pay immediately or you can add it to your order from the grill. 

Although the selection isn't quite as large as the North Las Vegas market, this PE offers a place to sit down to scarf down the poke and the bonus of Island Sushi & Grill's Hawaiian menu. In addition to our poke, we also shared a salmon skin bowl (yum!) and took a dozen malasadas back to our hotel to share with our family. 

My wife and I like to keep things simple at PE: we made two trips here last time and ordered one half-pound of the Furukake poke and a third-pound of a few others (shoyu; ahi with limu) and an order of steamed rice.

It's dangerous how close my current rotation is to Poke Express, I come here just about every other week.  Poke Express is located in Island Sushi towards the back of the restaurant.  The restaurant has changed over the years, they now are open later and offer more variety of poke.  I remember when they ran out of a certain flavor, they would be out for the day and I was forced to come early for what I wanted.  Now, if they are running low of a certain kind of poke, they will gladly make you one to order!  That's the biggest plus to me!  Now I can get Spicy Masago and Mayo anytime I want!  

Another thing that's great about the guys at Poke Express is how hospitable they are.  Sometimes the lines can get long, but they take their time and makes sure everyone leaves happy.  They offer samples if you can't decide which one to choose.  My favorites beside the spicy masago and mayo include spicy avocado ahi and furikake ahi.  

Prices are by the pound.  Most items are priced around $16/lb.  They have different sizes of containers depending on your need, I like that you don't have to order a full pound, you can get a third or half pound if you are looking to try different kinds or just want a smaller portion.  

I always grab my poke to go, but you can dine in and they also offer rice if you want to make it a poke bowl.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,6,8,5,0dSO2QcIsY0voo_sXvX4vg

I came to Poke Express with the intention to pick up some poke. But as I entered I saw that it is also connected to Island Sushi. What a wonderous place this little hole in the wall is. It is bursting with amazingness! You can get Hawaiian plates, sushi, and poke and be able to sit down and eat them right there. OR you can do what I did, which is to go straight to the poke counter and order up delicious poke to go in little containers!

The poke here is priced based off of market prices, so sometimes you may come and find your poke has fluctuated in price, but considering the quality of the fish and the great way the poke is prepared, I would be more than willing to spend a few extra bucks if market prices are high. There are many varieties. On my visit I ordered the Spicy Ahi with Avocado and the Salmon Poke (with special sauce). I have since tried both and they are both so good. The salmon may even be better to me than the spicy ahi AND it was a cheaper price. 

I can't even imagine eating fish any other way now. I don't want baked cod, I don't want smoked salmon, I don't want sushi covered in rice, I just want POKE!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,2,5,pIz13YlKmo95Fc7Yb0Hlsw

But what truly makes me a fan of Poke Express is the couple behind the counter. They are just some of the nicest owners you could ever meet. No matter what, they are always ready and willing to give you as many samples as you need. This helped me out because they have several spicy varieties. After trying them all, I went with the Wasabi.

4692741,2014-08-27,9,RBAcL6hg2yoaTRv0kKUjPA,"Ironically enough, if you're willing to venture off the Strip in Vegas, sometimes you'll hit a jackpot. Poke Express is one of those type of gems uniquely delivering the Hawaiian islands flavor in the desert that is Las Vegas. 

We went at around 11am on Sunday and they had initially already sold out of malasadas.  Fortunately, they were able to make another batch (w/in 20 minutes) and when fresh, these were amazing. Whether custard filled or just plain, the coating of sugar and the nice crisp flaky dough was tremendous. I recently had a batch frozen and delivered from Hawaii and these malasadas were comparable in quality. 

Then there's the star of the show, the poke. Really good poke to be exact. I can't attest to how it compares to poke in Hawaii but from all thirdhand accounts it matches up. Not quite there in terms of freshness but a close alternative. 

My favorite was the shoyu poke because the sauce is a great balance of sweetness that marinades the salmon or tuna to perfection. The spicy avocado poke was more spicy than I expected but having never tried avocado and poke mixed together, I thought it was pretty fantastic. 

I'd steer clear from the seaweed soaked poke as the salinity of the seaweed was too overpowering. 

They serve their poke by the 1/4, 1/2, and 1 lb sizes and we started by trying four different 1/4 lb. containers. Just a note, thats not nearly enough and we had to double up on what we ordered between two people. 

Overall, its affordable and delicious comfort food served with welcoming hospitality. It's like your own slice of Hawaii only a couple thousand miles away.

""Huh?"" I reply

""Yeah, you know, poke, the raw fish stuff you guys from Hawaii eat"" he attempts to clarify.

""I don't get it.  The hell you saying?"" I say looking like a confused dog with my head tilted to one side.

""Poke made with fish, you know poke, poke, poke"" being totally serious as he jabs his finger into my side.

Yes, were talking ahi limu poke, wasabi shoyu poke, etc. 

Is it as good as back home?  No.  But it is prepared in a way that makes it more approachable to mainland taste.  Cultural sharing through food is a good thing.

The various selections of ahi poke are made from previously frozen fish.  The sauces are deeply flavored but since the fish is not fresh when marinated, the flavor does not permeate it, just coats the outside.  Limu (fresh, raw seaweed) is used very sparingly and lacks the texture and ocean flavor you would expect.  Several types of poke such as the raw salmon (with onion, green onion, soy, sesame oil and sesame seeds) and  ahi kim chee poke (exactly as it's name implies) are not traditional but taste surprisingly good.

Prices are high compared to Hawaii (about $12.50 per pound for frozen fish) but expected.  It's a poke shop in the desert after all.

Recommended for those wanting a taste of Hawaii or the Hawaii expat jonesing for a fix of home.

As for my bud, I never corrected his mispronunciation.  Payback for poking me in the side and bluffing me out of a huge pot.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,10,6,3,FtnSZIk0QJdHK-KjPQ9kDQ

What is Poke? It's a Hawai'ian appetizer made of fresh fish or any other edible items from the sea. There are a variety of options here from Ahi (tuna), mussels, Tako (octopus), seaweed salad, edamame, etc.

Great prices, you pay by weight. 

The container sizes are:
small = 1/4 pound
medium = 1/2 pound 
large = 1 full pound .... which are displayed on the counter above the poke.  

My family and I come here often. My faves are: 
- Kim Chee Mussels Poke
- Spicy Ahi Poke with Masago & Mayo
- Kim Chee Imitation Crab
- the cucumbers
- the Taegu
- oh...and I almost forgot the Seasoned Edamame! (my bad, silly me)

The Ahi Limu is pretty good too. Oh yeah...Trust me and try the seasoned edamame! Tastes buttery (it's probably sesame oil & shoyu) & it has a good amount of spice (red pepper), not too hot.

I have not tried everything there, but I will be back often to accomplish that! 

The guys at the counter always have the ""aloha spirit"" on. They are friendly and helpful. If you would like to sample any of the selections, just ask! And I love that they all have the pidgin accent. Makes me feel at home and ho brah, the pidgin is contagious! Every time I go here, I feel like I'm back home in Hawai'i.

I have been thinking for a few days now where in this dessert besides whole foods would have tuna (that was safe to eat raw!) to make spicy tuna salad at home. Then I saw in passing one of the many Hawaiian joints in this town, yelped around...and viola...poke!!!!!! 

Narrowing down the options...I landed here, Poke Express. Thankfully I had torn through enough reviews to understand I just needed to go straight to the back of the restaurant as soon as you enter Island Sushi to place your order.

On both visits the case was filled with what looked to be their complete offering. Of course today a little after 12p the pans were only 1/3rd full since it was the day after being closed for the holiday. Probably 8 different poke (pokes? pokies?) ahi, spicy ahi with masago, spicy ahi combo with avocado and cucumber, salmon, ahi Hawaiian (the very nice counter woman said it was their version of poke without limu), kim chee mussels, 1 or 2 kinds of tako/octopus. All have been named in previous reviews plus seaweed salad, edamame, et cetera. 

Both visits I walked away with a 1/2 pound of each spicy ahi and Hawaiian. Totals each time was $16 and change for a smidge over a pound of ahi.

It's located in a small strip mall inside Island Sushi Grill. It's not on the strip, but there are two locations, both a little bit of a drive from the airport, and downtown Vegas, respectively. The airport one (this one) is the original, and supposedly is better!

Don't let the small counter and semi-empty looking trays fool you. After 1pm, everything is made to order, so just ask if they still have what you are looking for.

We got:
Ahi tuna poke with limu - Not too much flavor. Meh
Ahi tuna poke with shoyu - Mm.. classic poke flavor
Ahi tuna poke furikake style - This one is quite good too!
Salmon poke with house sauce - An interesting twist to the usual tuna poke

Prices are quite reasonable for poke. You can get poke in 1/4, 1/2 lb, and possibly other sizes larger than that. We got 4 1/4 trays, combined with a lunch special from Island Sushi Grill, and that split amongst 3 people was quite enough.

My personal favorite is the ahi poke with furikake and the salmon with the special house sauce.

Located in a small strip mall across from Gold's Gym and situated inside Island Sushi grill. Don't let the small counter set up deceive you, this place has a lot of options and it is super fresh. Everything is made to order after 1pm so if you don't see what you want, just ask :) There isn't a lot of seating since this place is pretty small. I would say no groups more than 4 and it's perfect for take out.

While I was in Vegas, my friend suggested Poke Express.  They have a display full of several kinds of poke.  There's also a display of the different kinds of poke they offer, so if it's not on display, ask, and they may have it in the back.

I tried the spicy ahi and wasabi poke.  The spicy ahi definitely has a kick.  But I don't like sauce on my poke, and this was my friend's choice.  What I did like was the wasabi poke.  Definitely has the potential to clear out your sinuses, so beware.  The wasabi is for sure in there.  I loved it.  The fish tasted pretty fresh, and the flavor was on point.  I will very likely be coming back here to get my poke fix again.

I also tried their Saimin Deluxe.  It's a huge bowl with all the fixings.  So good on a colder day.

Cheap, Healthy, Tasty, great variety (best in Vegas by far) and super conveniently located for Anthem/Green Valley locals. 

We REALLY need more good and Healthy Local spots like this in our neighborhood I am freakin tired of Wendy's and other chains...

Very Friendly service.

BUT Closing time is way too early around 6pm... Perfect for an healthy lunch but not recommended for dinner, too bad, I would love some Poki on my way back from work

My favorite: furikaki poki, kim Chi cucumbers, Salmon Poki with special sauce, Ocean (seaweed salad), Dried fish slices (can't remember the name)
The pieces of Tuna are cut a little bit too big for my taste but nothing that a sharp knife cant fix.

Also they mentioned that the Tuna is previously frozen unfortunately but it actually taste very very fresh. Extremely surprising.

The prices are also surprisingly low for the quality of the food, you would pay 20 times more in any sushi/seafood restaurant by the Strip.
Definitely a great value for what you get.

There is a Hawaiian grill in the exact same location that stay open later (10pm I think)
and I would highly recommend their stir fried saimin noodles and the oxtail soup with freshly grated ginger and cilantro.

Their coconut flan is pretty good too, one of my fav dessert of all time but in my opinion you cannot go wrong with coconut anyway ;)

Their assortment of cakes behind the window look Absolutely delish and beautiful, I have too look away every single time! 

I didnt like their homemade kim chi that much taught... Its not bad but I had better.

Also got a pound of the spicy ahi poke. The nice pieces of tuna was tossed in a mayo based sauce. Not my favorite, but it was good. The masago gave it a little pop with each bite.

Be warned: we went to this place around noon on a weekday and it was PACKED and a little bit chaotic.

SERVICE
I don't really order from Island Sushi (the restaurant poke express is in). I usually go straight to where they sell poke. Every time I have went the service has been great and the gentleman that I always see is always welcoming.

ATMOSPHERE
It is a very small restaurant with very few tables. It usually can get full so I recommend taking the poke to go.

FOOD
Salmon Poke: I love salmon and Poke Express is one of the few places that serve fresh, tasty salmon poke. It is also not drenched in the sauce already like some places but you can always ask for it to be. I like to pass on the sauce.

Spicy Ahi Poke: I usually order this with my salmon poke. The spicy mayo and the smelt egg sauce is great and the tuna is fresh as well.

I usually order half orders of each of these, so a pound every time I visit. The total usually comes out to be around $16. There are other sizes that you can choose from as well.

One of my yelp friend (Sandra S) raved about this place on her last visit to sin city. I love Hawaiian food so I bookmarked it knowing I was going in December. Fast forward a few months and I'm in Hawaiian Heaven. 

Here's the run down:
Fried Mac N Cheese Balls - a good starter. It was fried perfectly and the mac n cheese was so creamy inside. It was cheap too. $2.45 for 4 big pieces. Delicious 

We came here for the Poke, we got:
Shoyu Ahi poke - my favorite, Delicious. 
Ahi Furukake poke - it was still a bit frozen, but still good. 
Spicy Ahi Combo w/ Crabs, Avocados & Cucumber - my favorite 1A. Delicious
Tako poke w/ Limu (seaweed) - octopus was super tender. 
 The Ahi's were big chunks of raw tuna. So fresh, so good. You've got to try this place if you like poke. 

We also got some hot dishes.
Loco Moco - we were all loco for this dish. The best loco moco I've ever had. The hamburger was just so flavorful and you get two big hand made patties. The gravy is just money. With two eggs & two scoops of rice. Oh man, this alone made the trip here so worth it. Delicious. Must order here. 

Kalua Pig & Cabbage - another winner. Authentic Hawaiian dish. No fake smoke, tender, juicy goodness. Yum yum yum. 

Kalbi - Delicious, fall off the bone tender and  the marinade was spot on. Cooked to perfection. Delicious. 

Hilo Bay Bento Special - this had everything. A piece of spam, pork cutlet, pork teriyaki, beef short rib, noodles, pickled radish and all on a bed of rice. This dish is a mouthful and everything was so so good. It's a special, so they might not have it everyday, but if they do, get it. You won't regret it. 

The service was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a lot of  food and kept adding to the order and the guy taking the order was very patient with us.

This joint is tiny and tight, but so worth it.  Arguably, this place can easily survive in Hawaii.  Yes, it's previously frozen fish and prices are a bit high at about $16/ lb, but you will agree this is a good fix for good poke.  

Heavily seasoned, I still enjoy the avocado ahi and tako kimichi.  With a quick appetizer, that leaves plenty of room for me to enjoy their awesome kalua pig w/ cabbage or even a mini chicken katsu curry.  This place reminds me of Hawaii and it's so nice to see some folks originally from the Motherland dining here to validate the aloha here.  

My only beef is their malasada was a sorry excuse.  We got it fresh and it just permeated of alcohol and the first bite was, gag!  I was upset, because I found a hair on my malasada and they replaced it with a non-fresh one.  I got over it, learned my lesson and will never order it again.  Other than that, this place is a solid 4 stars for me.

Man, I swear, if I lived out in Vegas, I'd be poking it up at least once a week hehe.",yy_KQA1FtwilaG-7LB4BgA,2,2,5,NfAFkU8PxU-yAtYFm8zS9Q

I watched my order sit on the counter for almost 10 minutes while the girl running the register moved slower than slow. She then decided to weigh the other orders waiting on the counter before doing anything else. The line of customers waiting for a to-go order was 10 deep... With most of the orders complete and waiting for her. 

I was a two or three times a week customer. I'm done.",KMXm_zZ_mLvmSGK9EM4ZCA,1,0,1,CyuNY83DSAwzOvn1bHTPhQ

If you like salmon, be sure to get there early because it sells out pretty quickly. My favorite is the salmon with spicy mayo (they don't put it out, you have to ask for it). 

The employees are always friendly and easy going, true Hawaiian style. I haven't seen the older man who works there in a while, but he's like a kind uncle that makes you try everything until you're so full you're not even sure you want to order food anymore. 

If you order food from island sushi (also good), they'll bring your poke order over to the cash register so you can pay together.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,4,0,5,43_794wkE1qNpCjRrA7kTQ
5983676,2013-05-09,2,RBAcL6hg2yoaTRv0kKUjPA,"Super good and super fresh poke.  I like getting a 1/2 lb of the spicy combo poke (mayo, avocado, and other delicious goodness), a 1/2 lb of the poke w/shoyu (regular poke w/soy sauce dressing), and a 1/2 lb of their seaweed salad and I'm all set!

The poke here is absolutely delicious and I will keep going back for each poke craving I get.  The staff are really friendly, they let you sample the stuff before you buy it, and the poke just really speaks for itself and delivers.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,7,2,5,Gc0rCcjjG80Pt5VFmSeU-g
5994628,2014-01-31,0,RBAcL6hg2yoaTRv0kKUjPA,"I had once came across this place when hearing about poke being available in Vegas, but never did I think that I would find a place that could match some of the food that I had picked up when in the islands. 

I've been born and raised on a Hawaiian/Japanese mix of food growing up with my background being such, so to stumble upon a place that could match that island feel in the middle of a desert was great!

Their poke selection was pretty good and fairly reasonable. I went early in the morning, so I probably beat the lunch rush, which seemed to be coming in as I left. Not realizing that this place was located in Island Grill, I was happy to be able to order a full meal with my spicy avocado poke. 

Just like the hole-in-the-wall musubi place in O'ahu, I was able to get my small bento box with mochiko chicken! While there was nothing fancy about it, it definitely had the authentic feel of a meal I could pick up in the islands. 

The poke itself was also delicious! The ahi looked and tasted fresh and mixed with the avocado, it ended up being a great treat to eat with my bento box. 

It's a small place, but you'll get a good range of things you can find in the islands during your getaway in the desert of Las Vegas.
