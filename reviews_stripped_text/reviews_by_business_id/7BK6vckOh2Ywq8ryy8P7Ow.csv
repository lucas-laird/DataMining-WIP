I was skeptical but I love food so I went to try it and it was by far on of the better decisions I made. I got more food for the money I paid. The luau pork rice bowl with teriyaki sauce was so good.

Coke on tap, with Pibb rather than Dr Pepper.

One of us ordered a chicken bowl, which was bland, and not even as good as a dish we used to order from Applebee's years ago; the other ordered a charred (but seemingly still precooked) kahuna burger, which was sloppy and slipping apart, the flavors and textures didn't blend as well as they could, and it left a small longing for the Hawaiian burger from Fat Boy.

It was all OK, but just OK, not even ""A-OK"" as Yelp says. I noticed that a Braddah's is going in soon on the other side of the parking lot; it'll be interesting to see how that battle goes.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,3,n9dR80bpT9Hf7ucMmPAyBQ

Panda is closer to my office but I find that their dishes are too sweet even the ones that are supposed to be spicy.  I ordered the combo chicken and steak bowl with spicy sauce and brown rice to go.  One thing that irks me about some restaurants is when there is a tip line on the debit/credit card receipt.  They are basically asking for a tip immediately after you order and haven't really received any type of customer service yet and the dish was over $9.  Anyway, when I returned to my office to try the dish, unfortunately I didn't like it.  The chicken was extremely dry, the steak was chewy and the rice was very dry and hard.  The sauce was o.k.  The steak was so chewy and fatty I almost broke my plastic fork twice trying to cut it.

375708,2013-10-30,1,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"Have only tried this place out once but it is pretty decent.

First thing I always look at when I got out to eat is the atmosphere. More times than not, cleanliness and decor can offer some idea what the food and service will be like. The inside felt very cozy and the Hawaiian music really set the tone. There was one younger lady at the register and she seemed to be cheerful.

I ordered the Kahuna Burger along with sweet potato fries. The taste of the food was pretty good. I was surprised it came with two patties opposed to your typical ""single patty"" burger you typically see at places like this. I always get the Bonzai burger from Red Robin, which is basically identical to this, so I had an idea of what I expected out of it. It was good. Patties were juicy and flavorful and the fries were really good. But the prices didn't seem justified in my head. A side of sweet potato fries will run you $3.50. After walking out spending close to $11, I felt like I could have been more satisfied getting that Bonzai burger for about the same price that comes with unlimited fries. The plates are even more pricey. An Alaskan salmon plate will run you $10.50-ish and the portion you receive is less than generous.

I give it three stars because although the food was good, the prices just don't justify the meal. I am willing to spend more money on food if it's worth it. Call me cheap but if I'm going to spend $3.50 on a side of fries, they better be off the charts or a bigger portion and these weren't quite there on either.",1WpKr4f0WzHghvK4sQuuwQ,0,0,3,4-6nu9W8QGSF5GH_FKGVQg

581777,2014-07-20,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"Literally the worst meal I have ever had at a ""restaurant"". I saw they had a groupon deal and checked Yelp and decided to try it out. What a huge mistake. The Kahuna burger, my God, what an absolutely TERRIBLE burger. Pattys had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The swiss cheese was not even melted and there was a very large amount of mayo on the burger. Every time I took a bite the entire middle of the burger would slide out of the bun because it wasn't melted. Now on to my biggest complaint; the fries. Their menu says something along the lines of ""add Rumbi fries, chips, or a salad to any burger for $1.95"". So I order and say I want fries, expecting Rumbi fries. I get plain old fries, like at McDonalds. The amount of salt on these fries was unbelievable honestly. So when the cashier/server brought out the food I said are these Rumbi fries, I thought that's what I was getting. She said, and I quote, ""You gotta tell me whatchu want. You said you wanted regular fries."" I just about lost it right there, but somehow decided to hold my tongue. First of all, for $1.95, the options are chips, Rumbi fries, or a salad. How in the world am I supposed to know that normal fries would be served when they aren't even an option? Had I been served the Rumbi fries I might not be so critical of the rest of the meal, but without them everything else was just so terrible. Yelp definitely led me astray and I seriously would not recommend this place to anyone. I am not even exaggerating, a Big Mac or Whopper have more flavor than the terrible Kahuna Burger. This place tries to pretend to be Hawaiian by using pineapples. but it is just a poor excuse for a restaurant. I would not eat here again even for free. I wouldn't eat here again if I was paid to.",mmlLhM9ix8O9xYy05sNX3g,0,0,1,mL_vlHCJeAAiKVUAPHg0aQ

897726,2014-12-29,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"Had a deal from Amazon Local for this location and decided to give it a try. We ordered the Beach burger and Big Kahuna burger. We had an order of regular fries and ""Rumbi"" fries (which are basically a 50/50 splits of regular and sweet potato). Top it off with two fountain drinks and a brownie. It was a meal of indulgence for fast food.

Food arrived looking fantastic. The Kahuna has a thick slice of fresh pineapple, perfectly caramelized and sweet. There was a thousand island style dip, but I opted for the classic ketchup. The meat was juicy with two nice patties, melting along the cheese and warming the already toasty bun.

I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries but the regular fries were good. Needed a bit more salt, but only because of personal preference.

Overall the food was delicious. I would definitely visit again. The decor was nice, the facility was very clean, and service was fantastic. Best of all, I can finally say that I've had a big Kahuna burger.

As I was standing in line to order, the employees were practically yelling, complaining about their current work situation. (Something about being understaffed that day) They did not even try to be discreet about it, which I feel makes the business look bad. Even while eating, I could still hear them speaking loudly to each other in the restaurant.

I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl & mac salad. Big portion, but it was... Eh! I love going to Hawaiian restaurants, so I was bummed that it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. They also forgot to bring out my mac salad & there were only 2 other people inside the restaurant. On top of that, I'm not even sure it can be called ""mac salad.""

I ordered two combos from Parshae and used the Yelp coupon for free shrimp tempura I received for checking in. I had a couple of questions about the sauces and she asked if I wanted to sample the Jamaican Jerk which I really appreciated because it gave me a better idea of the flavor. She asked me what my first combo was and I repeated that I wanted pork and sirloin. I then went on to tell her what my second combo was just in case she wasn't sure. She completely cut me off and with an attitude said, ""I already got that!"" 

After waiting at a table for my order Parshae brought it over and explained to me which combos were in each container. I went on to ask her about the shrimp tempura I ordered with an attitude she said, ""you didn't order shrimp!"" I reminded her about the Yelp check in coupon I showed her earlier and her tone changed quickly. When she walked over to get my shrimp another worker came brought it over because she realized it was missing and was very apologetic. 

It's sad that bad customer service has the ability to overshadow the food a restaurant serves, but it's just reality.

I believe the concept here is Hawaiian/Caribbean fusion. Even though this is the first time I have ever heard of this, it does make a lot of sense to do so because they share a lot of tropical ingredients.

This store is located right across the street from the UNLV. The layout on in the inside is definitely a tropical theme. I was dead set on getting a combo plate and burger, the advertisements all over the place were singing the praises of their pineapple upside down cake. Having not one of these since I was a mere lad, pineapple upside down took the place of the burger. Also got a side of Rumbi fries instead.

Combo plate - decided on getting the 2 meat combo of pork and grilled chicken. The chicken was a little bit dry, but not that much. It had a nice chargrilled taste to it. I like the fact that their Kailua pork had a very subtle sweetness to it, and wasn't salty as f*ck like how a lot of places make it. I ordered brown rice and was glad they didn't use long grain brown rice, which is terrible even if it cooked correctly. They used a short grain one and it was pretty good. The stir fried veggies were good and didn't taste like they used frozen veggies. I liked the sesame oil taste to them. The only thing I didn't like was their teriyaki sauce that was thankfully put into a small container on the side. It might as well could have been maple syrup, it was that sweet.

Rumbi fries - here's a hint, ask them to put their blackened seasoning on them, it's really tasty. The Rumbi fries are a mix of regular shoe string fries, and thick sweet potato fries. Both were crispy, and the creole-like spice seasoned them very well. The dipping sauce tasted like a looser dynamite sauce and complemented the fries well.

Pineapple upside down cake - the last time I've had this was about 20 years ago and I made it from a Betty Crocker mix. Trust me, this was nothing like that. The cake had a complex pound cake like flavor, except being a whole lot lighter. The pineapple was nice but probably canned, and the whole thing wasn't too sweet, so I was pretty surprised.

The food came out fast and was well prepared. Hopefully when school is back in session these guys will start to pick up because I thought the food and service was pretty good here. One thing I didn't like is that they wouldn't let me use the yelp check in with the Groupon, but I guess you can't win them all.

When I checked in at Rumbi, Yelp popped up a ""1 Free order of cookies"" which I decided to cash in on and got a little bag of M&M cookies.

I took my table number to a corner table and realized there was free wifi with password (just ask them for the password when they bring your food). When they arrived with my food, I dug in. It was good and though it took me awhile to finish, because I was also doing homework, I finished everything and was happily stuffed. The employees kept coming to my table, as well as others, asking how was my meal which I liked. There are also clean bathrooms in the back of the restaurant.

I definitely want to come back and try out other things on the menu.",vLUHU5KxoB_CzLSHLkwz-g,1,1,4,QjCRS35851HozDxCfq5XpQ

So I came to Rumbi to eat with a couple girlfriends and I was one of the first people to order out of the 10 of us. Yet, as time went on, I noticed that everyone that ordered after me was receiving their food before me. Finally the worker and all of us realized my food was forgotten. At first it gave me a sour feeling because of the wait o had to go through, but let me tell you, their service recovery was great. I was upset that my food was forgotten, but Cliff, a worker there came up to me and made sure I was getting my food. He was very genuine and kind and I was suddenly happy again. I understand that esp when there is a rush and not many people in the kitchen, there is room for mistakes. The way Cliff handled it was just great. He made sure that I was going to leave the restaurant happy, and I was. He gave me a comp card for my next visit, and was so very kind.

GROUPON gave me a credit for the stuff I didn't received so we decided to use it here. 
So I'll list the food we got to go:
-Kahuna burger combo with volcano style Rumbi fries: LOVE IT! 
-Full rice bowl of Pacific honey orange glazed chicken: PANDA EXPRESS' ORANGE CHICKEN IS BETTER, (I hate having WAY too much rice with no more meat)
-Carribean chicken and shrimp (my hubby got this) he said: ""It was good!""
-Tempura shrimp It's aight! Batter was too heavy, my daughter ate 5 so she must have liked it.
-Bahama Mama Tortilla soup: okay it comes to the soup, the reason why I didn't give a 5 star is because the soup tasted more like coconut milk. We knew that it said a hint of coconut, but did not expect it to be like a tom yum (Thai soup) coconut soup. I mean it was WAY too coconutty.
-Chips & salsa: tasted like chips and salsa ;)
-Maui mango cheesecake: they gave me a regular New York cheesecake it's cool though a long as I got my DESSERT!
-Brownie: baby girl got this, tasted it, AWESOME!
Okay this place is so lucky that I even bother doing a review. So guys and gals give this place a try. Groupon offers a really good deal $8 for $16.",Gu-ZUPjk7cNqySqh3jHceQ,2,1,4,fR_2EJlymEbuPA_aG5JsVw

2011560,2014-07-31,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"My wife Dharma did a review the first time we ever ate in the restaurant.  It was kind of a lark, in that we were both very hungry and decided on a whim to come in.  We thought the name and the décor were interesting.  I am not here to beat a dead horse, I just wanted it to be known where we were coming from on this review.  It will be right above my wife's review.  So, after the experience last time, the manager was kind enough to contact us.  He contacted us quickly.  We ended up with a refund and 2 free dinner meals, neither of which we asked for or expected.  He was genuinely concerned and you could tell he cared.  I appreciate that.  Nothing in this review should negate that at all, but I also want to be honest and to give a fair review because as a Manager myself, I find that yelp! and other services like it definitely help you find the kernels of truth that help you improve and invigorate your business, customer service, and your interface with the people who visit your establishment.  So, that all said, here we go with visit 2:

The food was good.  The food was hot.  The young lady that brought it to us was nice and gave us extra napkins without asking.  However, at the register my son asked for his ""Beach Burger"" to be without tomato and onion. a He repeated it several times.  The burger had tomato and onion on it.  No problem, you can just pull them off and this allowed me to have extra tomato on mine.  Easy to forgive.  At the register, we presented our free meal coupons from the first visit and from the Manager and for some reason, they had to do them separate.  That means we got the same thing basically, but I had to get two swipes of my debit card, 2 receipts, 2 number cards for the table and so on.  It seems very inefficient.  Much like the last time, all the trouble really happens at the register.  We had to repeat our orders several times.  We wanted to make sure and there were still hiccups.  Another thing to consider is sustainability - 2 transactions for a father and son who sit at the same table, come in at the same time and are together seems like a waste - of time, paper, energy and patience.  I think it must have to do with how they input into the register, but I believe business pays a small fee for debit/credit transactions and so they paid it twice.  Still, really?  No big deal, I'm not upset or anything, but with just 2 visits to go on, this seems the sore spot in the operation.  Once you order and get your food, the food is good - heck, great for the price - and many of the staff members are very nice and are trying.  No complaints on this visit there.

To Brett, I believe his name is, who was so nice to us and made us give the place a second chance, I say thank you.  My wife declined the offer due to the rice bowl, but the burgers are good and I understand what restaurant management is like, I have done it myself.  I don't think it would take much to get this establishment out of the A-OK status of 3 stars for me.  If there was a variable I would go for 3.5.  I just think a few little things and considerations would help greatly.  Another thing now that I think about it - our first visit it was packed and crazy.  Today, just my son and I, another couple, and a few just off work employees hanging about.  Just seems something is going on that is keeping this place from being top notch and I'm not sure it is the management, although they are who can control and change things.  The place is clean.  The bathroom is clean - always a good sign.  Half the staff are friendly and seem happy and concerned about the place.  Some seem surly and act like they need another place to work.  One was obviously off work wearing a tank top and shorts and looking like he might have just worked out, kept staring at us and went behind the counter for something to add to his collection of items that were covering the little bar area over by the drink machine.  No big deal, but his actions are being mentioned because at any restaurant, you need everyone behind the counter to look professional and dressed similar to show who is working there and who can help you and there was a mish mash behind the counter and behind the grill.  Several have Rumbi shirts and look great - others in street clothes.  Just my opinion and my observation for what it is worth.  I really feel, especially judging from the other reviews, that the reason this restaurant seems to score mostly either 5s or 1s, with very few in between - check it out for yourself - is because of little things like this - some things bother some customers that might not bother others - but you have a real ""love it"" or ""hate it"" thing going on with this restaurant and that tells me it is definitely fixable and that any input, review, or observation should be helpful.  Thanks for your time.  My son says he enjoyed the burger and the fries and he thought it was good.  Due to this, I would go back to this restaurant.",TdpC-VZAWvmp1kNjFGehWw,2,0,3,zsAyhiH6O7dFZ4jsnHJ8Hg

Ordered Garden burger that was being promoted on the door. Patty was typical GB you find anywhere.  The bun was very good similar to Hawaiian sweet bread, sturdy, flavorful and fresh.  Toppings were standard lettuce, tomato and mayo it was lacking something though. I would have preferred sliced pickles.  I recommend the Rumbi fries which is golden fries and sweet potato crinkle cuts combo in one dish. Very good fries.

Also ordered fish tacos. Two tacos with seasoned white fish (not sure type) with sweet cabbage slaw Pico and jalapeño ranch sauce. When these came out my dish was not so hot temp wise but flavor was ok. Accompanied with a pineapple rice and speckled with beans and three tortilla chips.  I was expecting more flavor with the pineapple but overall bland rice. Dish was ok.

Mac n cheese was just easy mac but it was a filling portion for any kid.  The prices were reasonable for a lunch spot. Many deals and discounts available including free large drink with Yelp checkin.  UNLV students get deals and also a 1\2 off any entree if you come back up to 5 days first purchase after 4 pm.

I ordered a half sized rice bowl with luau pork, steak and brown rice and my friend ordered the Oahu fish sandwich special. 
You get a number and they bring the food out to your table.  Before our food arrived, they gave us complimentary chips and salsa (their version). The chips were a bit thick and hard but fresh and the salsa was pretty good and mild.  

My friend loved her fish sandwich with her mix of regular and sweet potato fries. The fish looked crunchy and the bun was soft. The sweet potato fries were my favorite - they are crinkle cut!  

My bowl was abundant with perfectly cooked rice and the highlight was the luau pork, it was divine!   The steak was good but you don't get much of it with the half portion. I loved the veggies - zucchini, carrots and broccoli. I think their rice bowls are much better than Samarai Sam's by far.  SO many choices!!  My only suggestion is for them to not serve so much rice. It's a bit of a waste....I would rather get more veggies. Maybe I will ask next time!  They also gave me two sauces on the side because I couldn't choose between the jerk or the teriyaki. The jerk was a bit salty for my taste but the teriyaki was perfect.  Of course, too much rice and sauce preference is a personal thing ;-)

I am a stickler for iced tea and they had that yummy tropical tea that you usually get at some of the Asian chains. 

Overall, the service, atmosphere and food were great! I will definitely be going back.",VTFF6eaJTKpf7kK-HRV3xA,1,0,5,k9Adn5If5W3ALqfmcQ61sA

3839370,2015-08-22,6,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"Rumbi Island Grill is a small sit-down type of place with island-themed decor adorning the walls and tables. The fun atmosphere combined with the food make it a good time whenever I visit. It's across from UNLV, so it's usually busier during the school year.

I ordered the volcano blackened fish (you can choose between salmon or mahi) which came with salad and your choice of rice. 

For this dish, I went with the salmon. The fish was drizzled in this unique-tasting aioli that made the salmon flavor stand out well. It was a bit overcooked, but nothing too noticeable. It was placed on top of a bed of brown rice, which is honestly the perfect pairing to salmon. 

The salad that came with it was basic, but the veggies in it were bright and vibrant (so I know it's fresh!). The romaine lettuce had a nice crunch and the tomatoes had a pico de gallo-like taste to it. A few croutons and parmesan cheese were sprinkled on top.

I think it's good for what it is. The prices are decent, you get good portions, and the food is great! This is a viable option for those who are in the area or for those who want some food in between class, but don't want to travel far away from UNLV's campus.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,8,9,4,Y3kadYIlDYfHMxduRfebVQ

What's even better was that Rumbi offers coupons which are included in the coupon book that UNLV gives out few times a year. With the coupon, I was able to get 20% off my entire order. 

I am not too sure of the concept but they seem to offer Hawaiian food with healthier option. Menu was simple with few options of burgers, salads and rice bowls. Rice bowls are customizable and you get to choose rice/brown rice, along with different protein and sauce. I got the steak rice bowl which was $8 and some change for their half size. Portion was generous. Steak was cooked medium to well-done and came with steamed vegetables. I appreciated the fact that they put sauce on the side because I was able to put sauce to my liking.  

I opted for their teriyaki sauce to go with my rice bowl, which according to the server is their most popular choice for sauce. It was sweet and a little tangy. I usually don't like too much sauce on any dish in general but I ended up using the whole container of sauce and still felt like I needed more flavor. I also wish that their steak was cooked more on the rare side than well done but that was probably my fault for not telling them how I wanted my steak to be cooked. 

Service was slow but friendly. My rice bowl was freshly prepared but took a good 20 min to come out. With other good nearby Hawaiian joints, Rumbi is definitely not my favorite choice. 20% off coupon did redeem my experience somewhat but I don't see myself coming back here.

I don't think you can go wrong with a rice bowl. The rumbi rice is excellent and both their chicken and pork are great with the rice. I've experimented with some of the sauces, like the spicy Hawaiian and I haven't found one I didn't like. The $8 you usually pay with a rice bowl scares off some folk, but I think for the quality, it's not asking too much.

The customer service is always excellent there. The staff is very concerned with making sure you have all your needs met. I've had the manager introduce himself and actually take my order. I like the effort that is put into meeting the people eating your food. Shows that you care and want people to come out.

I will say that last time I came in to eat, the food came out quicker than it normally does. It wasn't as fresh as some of the other times I've had it. Just brushing that off as an anomaly as normally every time I eat there, you can tell they just cooked your food.

Rumbi is a nice diversion from the standard fare they have around the university and it should be one of the places to highly consider if you are trying to get some decent lunch.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,0,0,4,cEhlO18ELSVNHyz7hkbk9w

They offered Groupons quite often and I had a lunch buddy that always enjoyed the fact that they had a tofu option as she is a vegetarian. That buddy moved away so I hadn't been there for a while. I went last week and I realized that some little thing shave changed. 

I always order a rumbi rice teriyaki chicken bowl, the large kind so I can split it into two meals. I am used the veggies in the bowl being slightly crisp and this time they were soggy and the whole meal  seemed extra saturated in oil. I was a little nervous when my meal came out only about 2 minutes after ordering when it usually would take a little while longer but would taste much fresher. 

I always order water and they used to give big blue glasses and now the complimentary water comes around in a little plastic cup. I guess I got used to the old way that I had it and considered it to be a nice little touch to a fast casual place. It may be that some people were taking advantage of the free water cup and when hog wild on some soda. 

The customer service continues to be spot on. The staff are always welcoming and accommodating. I do not think it will be enough to have me go to this spot again unless I have a coupon or discount because the rice bowl ends up being close to $10 and soggy veggies just will not do.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,0,0,3,bdULhyEIpsrJgtqHdsWuEQ

I purchased a Groupon which gave me $16 worth of food for only $8(Which today 7/11/13 is still available!) . Today I forgot my lunch so I decided to go on my lunch break;  I ventured down Maryland Parkway to this restaurant. I normally go to Cafe Rio so this was a nice change.

Upon entering it is a somewhat island themed restaurant with really nice colors. I really like how they use the past out along with the dark brown wood for their seating. I looked at the menu and they had a plethora of different food selections that you could choose. Although I looked at all of the photos on Yelp and they all look delicious I decided on the volcano chicken sandwich with regular French fries and iced tea.

The volcano chicken sandwich is topped with Swiss cheese, cilantro Mayo, pineapple salsa, lettuce, and red onions. The chicken itself has a seasoning on it and is a rather large piece of chicken. It is perfectly grilled and placed in a delicious white bun. Now this bun is not your typical bun, it is a delicious artisan tight bun that is perfect for the large portion of chicken that they place inside of it , along with all of the garnishments that come on your sandwich.

I got to work and took my first bite and I was literally shocked. The chicken was so tender and perfectly cooked and juicy, I didn't even have to put salt on it. For those of you who know me, I put salt on everything even before I taste it, it's a very nasty habit, LOL.  The regular French fries or cooked perfectly and seasoned really well, I didn't try the  sweet potato fries  but they they looked delicious. I opted for a drink and the cup you get you can bring back and I believe its only $0.25 for a refill the next time you come. I chose the iced tea and I lemon, I really liked the tea, it tasted kinda like hibiscus or a mango, super yummy!!

4360404,2013-06-23,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"This review is for the two times that I've visited Rumbi Island Grill. So I heard about Rumbi's grand opening through the BOGO coupon that my boyfriend had acquired earlier in the week. We decided to try it out since we were nearby UNLV and they are located just next to Rebelbooks. 

ATMOSPHERE: Outside of the restaurant they had someone passing out samples of some kind of teriyaki flavored beef with rice. Very inviting. Inside, the Hawaiian-themed walls and decorations were nice and not at all reminiscent of the garish-colored Hawaiian t-shirts.

FOOD: Kind of on the expensive side if it not were for our BOGO coupons. The first time we went we had the Cabo Fish Tacos and the Kahuna Burger. Both portions were huge and full of flavor. The well-seasoned fish tacos had some kind of tropical salsa and came with coconut rice and the burger was juicy and the pineapple inside matched perfectly with the teriyaki sauce. The SECOND visit... Was not as good as the first visit however. This time we both tried their salads and was disappointed with flavor and portion sizes that matched the $8 price. The Aloha Chicken Salad had almost no flavor unless you drenched it in dressing, which I chose not to do. The Jamaican Jerk Caesar Salad was also bland, and that would be including the chicken and dressing. 

SERVICE: The service the first week was great. A couple weeks later during our second visit, the girl at the cash register was very nice, but the guy manager seemed a little bit on the hurried side when answering my questions and didn't make me feel as welcome.

Overall, I say stick to the recommended burgers and the entrees, as they will be filling and satisfying. Everything else is too small portioned for the expensive prices.",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,3,1,3,3QgjbYi5_XhQ-vt1Kwv9CQ

He got the Luau burger I think that was what it was called, it was like Kalua Pork sandwich.  Well, I got the salad because I'm saving those calories for dessert.  I got my eyes on the mango cheesecake.    They are located right across UNLV.  Cute spot, reminds me of a haole version of Kuuaina's back home (I don't mean that in a bad way). 

Let me start off with Rumbi had served us with great customer service.  They were very attentive and suggested things on the menu since it was our first time.  Mango salad was pretty monstrous,  if your not a fan of blue cheese, you should ask for no cheese (I like blue cheese).  The mango was cut into itty bitty pieces.  They mix the salad dressing into the salad.  I think having the option to pour it on ourselves would be a better suggestion.

Rumbi fries are perfect for those that want to get a mixture of both Sweet potato (crinkled) fries and regular fries.  Which I am one who can't decide between the two.  Its not out of this world, but convenient for an undecided person like me.  Suggestion however, not to add too much salt.  I might ask for the fries without salt next time.  

Jesse N.  said the burger was okay, again said it was a bit too salty.  When he got his first one it wasn't that hot so he did return it to have it heated up.  But they were very kind and gave him a new one & made sure that he came back to enjoy another meal.  I didn't try the burger, just the meat from his burger.  Jesse will review it for himself.  

Mango Cheesecake was delicious.  A cheesecake with Mango sauce drizzled atop.  Just the right size to share between the 2 of us.  I forgot to mention, their Ice Tea is delicious.  I went back to refill my cup before I left.  I love tea and having a tropical tea flavored one makes it even better.  

Am I going to return, sure.  This place has a lot of potential to make it better.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,1,0,3,B6pMnXSTeK9W-rGG0R2s3Q

4878602,2014-06-28,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"I frequently walked past Rumbi and wondered if they're any good ... and today I skipped Cafe Rio to find out.  I was immediately impressed with the decor inside, since nothing turns me off faster than a white-wall ""insert restaurant here"" sterile box.  So their franchise attention to paint, trim, decorations, quality signs and graphics was welcoming.  The cashier was friendly and I ordered food to go, which arrived in reasonable time on a Saturday afternoon.

The Voodoo Salad with chicken was a decent portion for $8, the tortilla strips were still crunchy when we got home, and I'm glad it had lots of feta cheese.  The sauce was sweeter and spicier than I expected.

The Teriyaki Chicken Kids Bowl was fantastic, and I'm going to recommend it for my gastric bypass friends.  $4 gets you a half cup of grilled chicken, a cup of steamed veg, and ton of white rice (but I adore rice, so I was in heaven.)  I like when the broccoli keeps some crunch, plus they added some celery.  The zucchini and carrots were soft steamed.  :-P  The sauce was super sweet and salty, so thumbs up.

My go-to place is usually Teriyaki Madness, but I'm glad to have found something similar close to home.  This place seems lighter, and they gave me a $3 coupon and punch card, which I'm a total sucker for (way to cinch that fifth star, guys!)

My only suggestion would be the smell in there.  It was ... buttery?  Oily?  Not something I'd want to order, and enough to notice.  Perhaps it was the cakes, which sorely tempted me from their gooey pineapple upside down cupcake signs.  Next time!",Hj2bC9FUrj2NbCn2noproQ,0,0,5,Ab1VieQLkW6YWWTirYzAlg

Do get the pork or the grilled sirloin if you want an amazing flavor experience.  I tried half sirloin and half pork over noodles and it was amazing.  I really am starting to love this place!",raPiziYCtUkshxL0JzyvQA,0,0,4,4MQFratvc9hR3qSr1KS7-Q
5005655,2014-08-14,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,Love the sweet potato fries and burgers here like literally. The staff here is really nice and swift. I love how they give you a stamp card and a 3 dollars off coupon especially if you want to save big time. I recommend eating here during your break at work or school. Shoot I know I will because I can't get enough of those sweet potato fries.,_Y1CZq2b8T9T3d2N3PNfkA,0,0,5,qKcxpYn12Vb3HqSfuW7fFA

As soon as you walk in, you walk to the counter and you order your food, then you can pick your seating. They're very clean, I've never seen food leftover, or any of the tables a mess.
They cook your food quickly, and let me tell you, their food is great! We've bought about 4 or 5 different things from their menu and we loved them all!
I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for a good burger that's fairly cheap!",1vDKvGmVkThjIGrb8B-siA,0,0,5,C5FRicWkvzoQw99n2AH_Zw

5278228,2014-10-08,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"I loved the set up of this small restaurant and like the fact that it's right across the street from UNLV.  I came here for a lunch as part of a fundraiser for a student organization. I ended up ordering a tofu spicy teriyaki bowl ($7.95) that came with white rice and veggies and a fountain drink (total $11 +change). The customer service was impressive at first - the cashier was abnormally friendly and the guy who brought me my food grabbed me a fork. Even though the cashier tried to up-sell me into buying pineapple cake for dessert, I still liked the guy. 

It wasn't until I sat down and realized I had been duped! When asked for a drink, I replied with a simple yes. The cashier had automatically given me a large drink, so he up sold me there (though without my knowing consent). I hate when restaurants do this because I feel it's almost unethical. Ask me what size I want damn it! Or else I'll just assume you're giving me the regular size. I was peeved about that but didn't bother saying anything because I figured hey, the money is going towards a fundraiser. Remember to specify exactly what you want if you go to Rumbi's.

Now for the food: it was just okay. The veggies were overcooked, i.e, the broccoli had lost all its green color and was squishy to the max. The ""spicy"" factor I asked for was seriously lacking. Last, the rice was hard and crunchy, NOT soft and fluffy. 

I probably won't come back to Rumbi's. :/ The restaurant has a 4 star rating, but I just didn't get that level of experience. I'm only giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 because I'm grateful they have a tofu dish and an employee saved me the trip of getting a fork.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,2,0,3,cVDUXslBrYzG9uSrLsvJFg

I ordered dressing on the side and ended up not needing it. The flavors from the grilled shrimp mixed in perfectly. 
Great menu, staff and pricing!  Looking forward to trying out other items!",hXMjHbBSQC6Djy-EaZsrYQ,2,1,4,fFAeSNFqSIfmIcG3bqLYkw
5386476,2014-03-20,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"This is a cool, somewhat novelty addition to the usual UNLV eatery rounds (Chiptole, Cafe Rio, Cugino's etc) when I forget to pack my lunch lol. This place is especially helpful for vegetarian options, and I've had the rice bowl with tofu in Jamaican Jerk twice now and though it tasted more like teriyaki sauce and was not the least bit spicy....I still thought it was reasonably good! Another plus is that they have brown rice too  

Also as of late, the staff been so generous with their $3 off coupons. The first time I came, they gave me two :-) 

The only downside was that I felt like there was just so much rice compared to protein and veggies, which somehow made the Filipino in me feel just a teensy bit gypped! Nevertheless, I will probably be back and see how other options on their menu fare",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,1,0,4,pawObzN6yBPH_AQh--t9Tg

I have to be honest, but the bad service I received from the employee who is no longer there anymore ruined the whole experience and I really didn't care what the food tasted like. I just wanted to eat and leave!
Anyhow, I haven't been back yet but the apology and follow-up concerns I received were really genuine so I'm planning on going back soon. It's just kinda far for me but I'll be back :)",U98mZaQAsHXym6FyhGCZdA,0,0,5,VzgR6Ew93flufX9wrXcfzw

5948143,2014-09-28,0,7BK6vckOh2Ywq8ryy8P7Ow,"I'm really sad to say this was a major FAIL for me.  We came around 5:30pm on a Saturday night.  No one was in the restaurant.  There were 2 employees working, one cashier and one ""cook"".  We ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an orange chicken bowl.  Also, the rumba fries.  I had a groupon so I paid 8.00 for 16.00 worth of food.  I had to pay 3 more dollars.  It took FOREVAH!! for the food to be served to me.  The salad was big, tons of lettuce and not that much chicken.  My spouse was served a teriyaki chicken bowl.  I said "" this isn't what I ordered"".  The cook said "" Yes it is"" and  I said "" Nope, its not"".  Spouse said she would just eat it.  After one bite, she says "" taste this chicken"".  I tasted it and it didn't taste like chicken, it tasted like pork.  I brought it back and said that I wanted what I originally ordered.  

That took another 10-15 min.  By this point, 6 other customers came in the the ""cook"" was overwhelmed.  Ridiculous.   My spouse got her frozen, reheated chicken nuggets, drizzled with orange sauce and canned mandarin oranges.  She barely touched it and the overcooked fries.  No Thanks Rumbi Grill.
