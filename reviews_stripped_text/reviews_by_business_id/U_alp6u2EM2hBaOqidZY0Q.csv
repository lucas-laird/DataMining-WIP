They have $3 beers and $4 shots. Great prices for alcohol downtown, especially if you are trying to pregame for a night out! 

The staff here is great. They are extremely friendly and give off a great vibe. Overall good time here at Holo Holo. Love the name too!

If you get hungry after, head over to the restaurant with the oxtail special. It's so worth it.",Pd9iyEE_8ZPTv0zHNXiwZw,0,0,5,NuvB54ObwahuwUUHYkzt-Q

My sisters and I happened to have some time between shopping and eating, so we sat down for a round.  My baby sister likes to relax at the end of the day...  I blame her...

Service was okay - the workers were chatting amongst themselves, so I felt like we were bothering them.  Maybe it was a slow time (it's open 24/7)?  Anyway, I like to play video poker while sitting at the bar if there's no conversation going on and the Progressive amount is high.

The thing that bothers me most is the name of the bar:  
Holoholo in Hawaiian language is not ""happy"".  The poster for the bar says, ""The Happy Bar"".  However, holoholo means ""to go for a ride"" or ""to go out"".  ""Happy"", or ""happiness"" in Hawaiian is ""hau'oli"" (not to be confused with haole = foreigner).

Mahalo (thank you) for reading!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,29,29,4,82B5j9Ct4G5hsr7mVKAxLg

Fast service. Sports on the tvs. Pretty special for a Boyd property.,UrQw8IyTOAAlokN-SMK3_Q,0,0,4,46HSAZ_KODUA3ueAnOx4nw
