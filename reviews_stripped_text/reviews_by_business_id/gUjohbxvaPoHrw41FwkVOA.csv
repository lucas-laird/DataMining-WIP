363013,2008-05-22,0,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,I dined here because of reviews from about.com and other various sites.  Boy was it a let down.  The food wasn't nearly as good as the reviews said.  I'm not saying that it was horrible...the food just wasn't worth the price of admission.  If you want Chinese food drive over to the Spring Mountain area and eat at a real Chinese Restaurant.,Fwb7YdxaGO5LgaqPL132-w,0,0,3,sMkvX6ZF4chQuGsVhGzqyg
623426,2008-07-09,0,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,"Let me preface this review by saying that Vegas hasn't really made a fan out of me and I am extremely hard on eateries there (especially when you look at how much an adequate meal costs!). However we were pleasantly surprised by Chinois. 

We elected to share multiple dishes and with the exception of our pot stickers being on the greasy side, we enjoyed our dishes which included a good variety of options such as  the chicken lettuce cups and korean bbq ribs.  

I'm a sucker for desserts and Chinois did not dissapoint. We shared the fifteen layer red velvet cake and the passion fruit three ways. I have never had dessert where each member of the party couldn't decide which dessert was better. They were both delicious, well-prepared and beautifully displayed. 

If you want a low-key but satisfying dining experience in the midst of the craziness that is the Strip this is a very good option.",QFwtMUA9dQfRNM57ipaqfQ,0,0,4,YLoy9OpbUk1jnOJAgExxDQ

On the other hand the pork potstickers were very plump and delicious.  Special fried rice and general tso's chicken were good, but pretty standard.  Desserts were very tasty.  Service was better than I'd expected after reading other reviews.  I won't go back, but I didn't hate this place.",QASyi6wXs5jdlS5hKgzNAw,0,0,3,oSwNZn_FnOcjQcDlb5msQw
1083921,2007-01-29,1,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,"When I was little, I remember being told that too much salt was bad for you.  I don't remember why this was so, but I think it came from the FDA or some other governmental agency.  As a scientist, I've always been curious to read the reports myself or at least determine where the funding came from, but to tell you the truth, I'm too lazy.

Later we were told that salt in larger quantities was, in fact, not as bad as originally determined when accompanied with proper hydration.  I have no evidence for this, but I think these reports were probably funded by a Wolfgang Puck conglomerate!  Jaysus!  I'm still trying to hydrate myself after my meal at Chinois.

Originally, I thought the food here was OK, but in retrospect, the food was actually only a little better than cafeteria food.  I can get better quality food at a Wolfgang Puck Express.  My sushi roll was almost flavorless, and this is even with unagi, avocado, and ""special"" (meaning the oddest shade of gray) sauce on top.  Even the pork spareribs were lacking in flavor.  I did taste a hint of Chinese flavors, but only a hint.  For the degree of stickiness the ribs were, you would expect there to be an abundance of flavor, but sadly this was not the case.  The sign in front say ""Chinese Fusion"", but I'm not quite sure what it's fused with - perhaps with a little bit of crappy cuisine.

With tax and tip, I spent almost $50 for one appetizer, one sushi roll, and a cocktail!  They say you have to bet big to win big in Vegas, but you just LOSE VERY BIG at Chinois.  The two stars are for the great service from the bar guy, and the tasty cocktail.",rjE_SpqTmW-mrQOSAmGhdQ,0,0,2,CasJfW_SPTVoFF1UTY4M2w
1413655,2009-03-04,0,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,"My work hosted a prix fixe dinner here at a private room upstairs. Started off with passed appetizers, tiny poke tuna bits on fried won tons, veggie spring rolls, and tiny open burgers, all very good. During dinner, the salad was very good, followed by an excellent crab risotto. Dinner was a choice between fillet mignon and fish in miso with cold soba noodles. I had the fish, which was by far the worst of the four courses for me - fish was too salty (which is saying a lot, since I like my food salty) and it just didn't go well with the cold noodles. Thankfully, dessert in the form of a chocolate heaven (think of a large decadent kit kat) saved the rest of the meal. 

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise, wouldn't mind going back. However, there are so many good restaurants to try at Caesars, I don't know about a repeat visit here without trying those other places first.",lM19Y0-Zj3E_4Q2ygZz9FQ,0,0,3,Aao0zW-OqEWMOCKVubXT-Q

2060425,2007-03-29,0,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,"OK I hate PF Chang's to begin with, so I had a feeling that this place was going to go down in cuisine history as a no go.  Boy was I right.  I started off with a Cosmo which was more like a Nause-mo.  It was watered down and funky tasting and before my dear waiter who was a car salesman in his former life could take a moment to listen to my drink change, he brings back another.  Well alcohol is alcohol and I needed a lot at the moment, so I indulged.

I had a hard time deciding on what country of Asia I wanted to dine from, so I decided to hedge my bets and go with maki and firecracker shrimp.  I wish I would have ordered more maki instead and a side of edamame as my coworker did because my ""spicy"" sauce for my ""firecracker"" shrimp tasted more like maple syrup than anything.  Blech.....maple syrup on bok choy.

The heirloom tomato salad was outstanding.  Other than that I had tofu & mixed vegetables with some noodles & rice.  Good and spicy.  The other girls in the group loved the chicken and beef.

Desserts were so good...!

Definately not traditional Asian, it's the Americanized version at it's best!

Once we sat down and looked at the menu we were all like ""this is it?"" The lunch menu is very limited, everything we ordered was very common, and still pretty expensive. Honestly, it was like the selection at Panda Express but the dishes are plated a lot nicer. The only saving grace was that the drinks were strong.",s76J8AsfaaRrker3s22ulw,1,0,2,V99qhdii4Hbj_Z3trmDOIw
2602929,2007-08-01,2,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,"Nothing irks me more than restaurants who try to make themselves look cooler by having lines of patrons stand outside for 10+ minutes, even though there are hoards of empty tables inside. ""Ooh, honey, this place MUST be good -- there's a line"" WRONG. So hubby and I stand outside, looking at the hostesses, and then at the open table immediately to the right of them, over and over for about 15 minutes. Right as I about to ask why we aren't being seated at that table, or any of the other available ones a menu's throw away, we are called. 

We walk thru the cluttery floorplan, all the way to the back, passing empty table after table.... All the way to this tiny two top by a shoji screen, RIGHT by the kitchen. WTF? I called the hostess out on it, and said, ""We'd rather sit over there, where it's more comfortable"" and she grudgingly moved us up where all the pretty people were. Nobody puts Baby in a corner, dammit!

Our waiter was practically invisible, until it came time to pay the bill. He practically gushed over us at that point, ""Oooh, guys, thank you SOOOO much for coming in"" etc. I freakin hate that. 

The food was edible, but not good or noteworthy. I ordered the crispy tofu dish, which was supposed to be spicy, crispy, and delicious, but it wasn't any of those things. The tofu was the really soft kind that falls apart when you try and cut it, and the sauce was sweet with mostly sugar as the main flavor. 

The main reason I'm giving the place a 2 star review is for the decor. The staff were all a bunch of twerps, and made it abundantly clear that we were not a priority. The food was not worth what we paid for it, and I walked away going, ""I should have spent that on slot machines."" I'm so over that place.",Tvk5HuAzmYDJPN9d6fBiiA,1,0,2,outsE0z5gwc7L-Y-SH5J3Q

3382046,2007-03-29,3,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,"this is your typical asian fusion restaurant perverted by the white man for their liking.  in my honest opinion, not many restaurants ever pull off a fusion restaurant, and this one is no exception.  basically every dish on the menu we ordered lacked any true or asian flavor you'd expect.  furthermore, someone told me that chinois means ""chinese'' in french.  i shouldve made the connection right there that this food would suck. cmon now, would any of you eat at a chinese restaurant that serves american food and calls themselves honkys?

also, everything was overpriced.  luckily, my company picked up the tab for this crap.  i'd be embarrassed to come here again.  this place justs preys on tourist with money.  if there are any real patrons for this place, then they probably pay just to sit here and show they have money as well as admit they know nothing about food.",gvuRrJL5XvNampQ35XXOhQ,3,2,1,LIF9XXEAfkn1zwP29JWDOg

4528139,2007-07-17,0,gUjohbxvaPoHrw41FwkVOA,"Funny - the very reason other reviewers don't like it is the reason I went in to try it (seemed like a PF Changs.)  We were shopping and starving and there was a wait at Spago so we tried this place.  

We had the lettuce wraps (better than at PF Changs which is my fav dish there), General Tso's chicken (not greasy like at every other chinese restaurant that serves it) and the rice noodles (Thai inspired - quite good I thought.)  I pretty much do not like ""authentic"" Chinese food but like the Asian fusion style.  And both my husband and I liked the food a lot.  

The drinks are high-priced but so are they in every other decent place you go in Vegas so whatever...  The place was full when we were there and full when we left.  They had modern music playing and the staff were on the ball (never had an empty water glass...)

Personally, I'm hoping he opens up one in the Bay Area.  And like every PF Chang's you go to, will be crowded and popular because the food is decent, moderately priced and you know what you are getting.",72s2b4tegZYAV3R0gFzLUQ,1,1,4,K3wDO3rtP9LcU4uOfJN6gg

Tried the crispy organic chicken and the firecracker shrimp.  The organic chicken was fried very well.  Better than average.  In a tasty sweet soy sauce.The firecracker shrimp was not cracking though.  The shrimp were tiny and sauteed with bok choy in a 'sweet and spicy sauce'.  I didn't think the sauce was all that great, neither the bok choy or the shrimp...basically the whole dish was bad.  It was rather dissapointing!  

They also don't know how to cook rice here!! Wasn't very warm either.

I had to pick a place for a large group as I would be entertaining a number of members from my association during our annual convention.  It had to be centrally located among the various hotels and provide a fairly decent meal and a good wine list.  Chinois was the perfect choice.

The service was excellent.  It started with the hostess when I told her that I was meeting a group of people I'd never met before and was there somewhere I could wait so they could find me.  No problem - they took me right to my table and escorted each of my guests over after that.  (One of the biggest pet peeves I have about many dining establishments in Vegas is that your entire party has to be there before being seated, so this was a bonus.)  Our server was smart, friendly, knew her wine, and didn't bug us too much.  When asked for her preferences, she didn't just spout off the most expensive thing on the menu.  Many things we ordered, she accommodated specially because 2 people were vegetarians. 

We ordered a number of appetizers for the table.  I'm told the pork pot stickers were quite good, the tuna sashimi was wonderful!  We also had the obligatory calamari and popcorn shrimp.  Both were yummy.

For dinner, we each ordered our own meals, but then passed them around the table to share.  Some standouts were the stir-fried tofu, the crispy whole catfish and the spicy shrimp noodles.  The catfish was particularly fun because it comes whole and then they filet it apart for you tableside and was served with a delicious, spicy sauce.  There were rave reviews from around the table and every morsel was eaten.

We were so full that we opted to split just three desserts among the table.  The banana spring rolls were the stand out here.  They were so good!  We also had the crispy chocolate mousse and the creme brulee.

Now I realize that many of these entrees could probably be had at a PF Changs or similar, but I think the thing that made it all stand out was the service by far.  I truly believe that food is a reflection of the enjoyment you're having.  We had a fabulous time.",wPif9x51jxzO8DS6h-ZY4g,1,0,4,IWmF64eh30UcsmqssQyEkg
