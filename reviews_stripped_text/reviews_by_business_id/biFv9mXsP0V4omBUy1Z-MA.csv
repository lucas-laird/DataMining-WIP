A few times ordering in person, I just feel like the employees are so rude & unorganized. How is it that someone who orders the same thing as me 10 minutes later, gets their stuff before I do. 

Also on the other hand, some orders aren't followed through correctly which is a very annoying. 

Oh not to mention, I found a piece of hair baked in my pizza. That was really fun. Goes to show the lack of cleanliness in the store.",DmDhDOG6o0Blyo6eC0zu8w,1,0,1,FtcJcXSMeboseuKxKuT3LA

504454,2016-10-26,0,biFv9mXsP0V4omBUy1Z-MA,"A few days ago, I ordered a pizza online and picked it up from this location. When I was given the receipt & asked to sign, I noticed that instead of the usual blank tip line (where you can add a tip if you want to), the cashier had already added a $5 tip on the computer before printing out the receipt. I asked her what was going on because that's never happened before, at this location (with other cashiers) or any other Pizza Hut location I've been to lately and this woman tried to act like she had no idea how the $5 tip appeared on the receipt. I explained to her that the reason I pick-up my pizza is so I don't have to leave a tip and told her to issue a $5 refund immediately. She did. However, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will no longer go to this location. It's sad that people try to steal your money if they think they can get away with it. Had I not checked the receipt before signing, I never would have noticed what she did. And I know it was this woman who entered the $5 tip on the computer before printing it since I've been to this location before and usually, the tip line is blank so you can add a tip if you want to. I guess some cashiers think customers are in a rush and won't notice the added tip until it's too late. Always check the receipt before signing and leaving. I won't be going back to this location. Dishonest cashier and the pizza was average at best, with the woman forgetting to add BBQ sauce.

I am disappointed with the quantity of ingredients placed on the pizza. Margin on the Pizza to the sauce area is more than an inch and a half, more like 2 and a half to three inches of exposed crust. I asked for extra cheese and it just doesn't look like the pizza I have had a million times before. So I called to the PH we got it from. Spoke to Andrea. I told her that I thought the pizza was weak. her response was "" We measure everything"" meaning I the customer was wrong, I have no issue I should not be concerned about the value for my money. She offered to remake or apply credit to my next order. My problem with that is that I will get the same result according to Andrea because they MEASURE EVERYTHING. How do I resolve this issue. I am a Pizza Hut fan who may have to look some where else. Shit! Fucking Andrea I wish you could see my face right now.  When does quality start to be important to maintain customer base.

5000125,2015-11-14,4,biFv9mXsP0V4omBUy1Z-MA,"Do you know how hard it is to screw up pizza?
 Let's break it down by category: Ordering. I ordered online. Pretty basic. I am used to Domino's but felt pretty secure in my usage. Called the store after an hour to hear that they did not get my order. Really? Ok, Domino's did have that handy ""Track your order"" feature. Well, damn. An hour estimated time? I do admit she was spot on, within minutes of the quoted time. She wasn't particularly worried about the confusion, and acted like it. Since it was dinner rush it would be ANOTHER hour. Past my bedtime, but I agreed, mostly because I didn't know what was coming.
 So, delivery. The driver was very sweet, and put my pizzas down so I had a free hand to get sign, she did say ""Enjoy your Pizza Hut pizza!"". 
 The food, holy Christ. I ordered thin crust. I am pretty sure it was parchment paper, not because it was thin, but the taste and texture were absolutely parchment paper. Also, it was stone cold. The toppings, and the crust. I bit into it at one point just to have my girlfriend ask if my teeth were alright. It seriously was that crunchy. Totally tasteless. No hint of flour, even.
 They arrear to be making a lot of money on these Two for $7 each deals because they put about .45 cents of topping on each pizza.
 The sauce on the Alfredo one was like mud flour. It was apparent it was even there except I could see it. I could not feel it when I chewed though.
 The sausage was ok, had a faint sausage flavor. The Pepperoni was tasteless, I have no no idea how anyone makes pepperoni that doesn't have a taste, kudos to whoever did it. The ham on the pineapple pizza could have been something thin, pink and tasteless. The red sauce had a vaguely vinegar taste, and a jarred red sauce smell and taste.
 The veggies. Well, I hate black olives, and they were the best vegetable on there. Seriously. No joke, man. The pineapple was noneventful and I quote on that.
 I added hot peppers, and garlic powder to my slices and dutifully heated them up in the microwave, which violates a family disuse of due to my Grandson Kayden. Healthier to not, and his Mom is nervous about his pacemaker. After two bites I realized God was punishing me for that, and I will give it up again now, now more attempting to fix mistakes made by sloppy food delivery.
 I fed the dogs, and considered stealing some kibble, but it isn't a flavor that appeals to me. Next time I will get frozen pizzas to keep in the fridge. Either we were last on her 7 deliveries at once, or they weren't heated up by something silly like running them through the oven.
 Would have been two stars for her, but can't even justify the one I'm giving.
 The pics on this location that others have left in NO way reflect what you should expect on your, AT ALL.
 I wish they served beer or wine, then I could say at least they had beer or wine. Interesting that the 5 Star Reviews seem to be people with one review, and very few friends, with one or two exceptions.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,3,2,1,2JYSVRBwRKW26XDrhU-xbg

I'm here because I just wanted to say Thank You Pizza Hut and their driver, I was ill the day I ordered a pizza and didn't even feel like moving so the ability to order easily online then having it pop up less than 20 minutes later on my front porch was a thing to behold, and $20 bucks included the $6 tip for a real nice tasty pizza, obviously not the best in the world, no one ran down to the farmers market this morning and grabbed all the ingredients, buthcered any animals just beforehand, it was what it was, a PIZZA! mostly frozen ingredients and as fresh as a large corporation can get them to my door, show a profit and still pay the bills..

however I got what EYE wanted on MY pizza, right down to the salt n peppa! due to a special they are running right now any pizza have it your way $11... PERFECT! as never is the one I like ever on a menu, ever... light cheese, extra mushrooms, olives, extra eyetalian sausage, spiced sausage, pepperoni, and salami atop marinara red sauce bedding a large thin crust..

lets face it, not many of us are willing to get up off the barcalounger for a 20 spot much less throw a pizza together, put it in an insulated box, throw it in your car, drive a couple miles to a complete strangers house, work the gate code, then knock on a total strangers hidden door for what? minimum wage that prolly works out to be around $2 for the 15 minute effort minus preparation?

that's why instead of complaining I didn't get a 40 lb 6 star pizza for a $20 TMD I'm dang thankful there is a pizza hut, with delivery, an employee to drive to me, and $20 bills to cover the exchange and the fact I am alive and well enough to hand it to a complete stranger for said pizza..
