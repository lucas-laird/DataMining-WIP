To be quite honest we are always greeted by friendly staff (and we've been there more than 10 times since moving here 9 months ago). The establishment is always clean and the service is quick ! There are sometimes lines but we never have to wait, the employees are amazing. 

Weather it be 2 am or 10 am there is no difference in quality, it's always at its peak ! We have tasted everything on the menu, and belive me, it's delicious !! The portions are great, huge !!! You'll probably have left overs. The fresh squeezed orange juice is my go-to, the fruit is so ripe, amazing. Not to mention the Horchata, we highly recommend getting that. 

The Asada fries are to die for, always good. The carnita tacos are a personal faves, not to name names I've been to a place who charged 5x as much and their meat was dryer than sawdust. We highly recommend it here, our moto is always to ""taste it before you judge it"" and this place is definitely top 5 places to eat if you ever find yourself in Vegas !

But I was so let down. 

The food portions are small, the prices are expensive ($10 for a burrito??) and they charge you $.50 to use a debit/credit card to pay for the over-priced food you just bought. Not awesome. Overall it's just a really poor choice. I would go on, but it really isn't worth it.

CONS:
-More expensive than similar spots. Expect $9 for your burrito, if you want anything other than onion and cilantro in it, and an extra $2.25 just to make it ""wet"" style. All items are a good buck or two more than they need to be, and the quality isn't any higher.

Meanwhile, you don't realize that there are 2 registers open on either side of the fixings bar.  Nonetheless, the manager took my order. He was very helpful and reviewed with me the menu and answered my questions. He told me several times that they have the best tacos in town.  I ended up ordering 3 soft tacos with carne asada and cheese.  While i waited for my order, I noticed a girl cleaning the heck out of the dining room.  You need to get a code for the restroom door.  The restrooms were so clean that you can eat off the floor.  I was super impressed with the cleanliness here.  Someone else mentioned in their review that the seats were too low. OMG, is that person right! I felt like i was going to fall over, the seats were so low.  A few minutes later, my food was delivered and I  had to ask for extra napkins. This is the one thing i cannot stand in a restaurant. Asking for extra napkins is unacceptable and makes a place look cheap.  Unfortunately, the tacos were so salty, that i thought that i was eating fish that was just caught in the Atlantic Ocean.   I'm not sure if the salt was on the sauce, meat, or the cheese but the salt level was astronomical.  I really wish the food would have tasted better. I don't think I would be returning here. Sorry. :(",GXanDpgw2di3TrpYv3y0_Q,0,0,2,vds6P8tsjJhWQXDxwtcnQw

We were happy when it opened, since it was very convenient to go there before a movie. When they first opened, the food was edible. It is not any more. The quality of the food has gone way down. I saw the comments about napkins and we had to bring our own. How cheap can you get? The food was so bad the last time we were there after making the same item three times. I spoke to the owner and he invited me back at no charge. We have not been back and will not even eat the food for free. I wonder if the owner reads the reviews? If so, he really needs to clean house. His employees could care less about taking care of customers and the quality of the food they serve. It is obvious by now, that the owner never looks at the comments made on Yelp. He should and address the issues customers have taken the time to post. If you have any issues, you should call the owner. His name is Ricardo and he can be reached at 702.646.0300.

I had a carne asada quesadilla and added guacamole on the side. Delicious! Friendly service, very clean restaurant. 
Only thing I'd suggest management change, do NOT charge customers a fee for using their debit/credit card. Thankfully we had cash but I could see other customers annoyed. That's a cost an owner should always eat, not an already paying customer.

Unfriendly service and the food is not edible, just horrible. It's just a parody on meat, potatoes, bean, etc.   

After I asked 4 times to make sure the chicken I was ordering was breast meat only and receiving affirmative answers each time, what I got was disgusting pieces of skin with some dark meat attached to it. They lie blatantly.  

My wife ordered pork and received over-fired crisp chunks of pig skin with beans, chips, and potatoes that tasted nothing like the foods we know. If some health and food inspector truly checks this place, these guys will have to get busted.  

A special touch was the server brining the food out of the kitchen and yelling the order numbers out in SPANISH ONLY.  I tried to understand and double checked in English - she just brushed me off rudely  - ""NO, YOU ORDER NO READY!""

I watched them ""throw"" together our order. The carne asada in my burrito was so fatty and tough that I couldn't chew it and had to spit into a napkin several bites. My wife didn't even finish her tacos. I used their restroom and halfway through the bathroom lights timer clicked off and left me in the dark. I had to use my cell for light to finish.

4287343,2017-08-17,0,3dC3opMY67zrquz_yYc-tw,"A pregnant girl can literally at most anything, for me, to give this place 1 star is bad. This was mainly for the chicken tacos, they're facking garbage! No, I've literally saw garbage that would probably taste better than the .99 crunchy chicken tacos. 

We saw a sign that had advertised .99 chicken taco Wednesday, and we're usually loyal to Roberto's but after the gym we said, what the hell, let's try them. We walked in and ordered and the cashier was nice and all, and I'd say within 3 minutes I got the 10 tacos I ordered. The first downside was they had tomatoes and I HATE TOMATOES. It didn't say they came with them on there, so I was a little irritated. Being pregnant, your smells are amplified, so needless to say I wanted to puke over the smell of them. We got in the car and left.

Upon arriving home, I put some salt, since the chicken (what little they put in there) was bland, some red salsa (FUCKING GROSS) and limon. I lifted my taco and the filling started to fall out. So here's the thing, the chicken to lettuce ratio is stupid, they put maybe a tablespoon on this disgusting, tasteless chicken in there and pile on wet lettuce and wet tomatoes. The box had water and tomatoes water on the bottom, and because they're too cheap to individually wrap the tacos, it made the crunchy shells wet and nasty. Not only that, but my tacos were cold, just from our 3 minute trip home. You know why? BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING CHEAP AND HARDLY PUT ANY CHICKEN IN THE TACOS. And perhaps because they may have been sitting there before we actually ordered them. I know this, Roberto's is a 15 minute drive home, and the tacos are still nice and hot when we get home.

The chicken in these tacos is seriously gross, it was sorta gray and tasted like old chicken. Perhaps the leftovers from the days before... good way to get rid of chicken by offering cheap tacos. It was even shredded, just like, a glob. 

I can easily put down 3-5 tacos, but I could barely eat 2. The tacos were just, terrible. They deep fried the shit out of them, and the taste was just horrible. I will never betray Roberto's again.

The cashier looked confused, and confirmed my order of the relleno burrito. A few minutes after we pay I noticed that we were charged 10.99 for a wet burrito combo meal, when I brought it to their attention, they were happy to make what we ordered. Getting that $3 difference back was a whole other story. 5 min later they hand us $2.06. I don't understand the confusion of such simple math, having been a cashier myself for years it just seemed like common sense that 10-7=3.
