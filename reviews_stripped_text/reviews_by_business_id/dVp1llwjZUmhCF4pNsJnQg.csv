Its in a nasty part of town but when I walked in I felt like I was in Mandalay Bay.  Everything was great but especially, from what I've tried so far, The Reuben The Buffalo are amazing.

1052177,2018-04-21,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"I am glad this place exists! Nothing like finding a vegan restaurant; where the menu is catered around your choices, and not you attempting to piece together a decent vegan meal around appetizers and sides like most mainstream places. I will definitely go back, now the reason for a 3 star rating.
First....how are you out of drinks, and or have to check if a menu item is available for purchase? I have to say, I have NEVER been to a restaurant that essentially cannot provide what is listed on the menu. I have eaten at many places, and as costs of meal goes up, I have an expectation that service goes up....not for service to go down. Strange! Another thing was service. Was slow, had to ask for things, like napkins, syrup, and spoons for the ice cream.....why do I have to ask for spoons....for ice cream??? It's also VERY loud...music is blasting....I am assuming because they are located under the flight path of McCarran Airport....I suggest bringing pen/paper,using sign language, or stop by Lakeshore Learning and buy one of those learning sets that elementary school kids use....it's like a phone system and 8 kids and a teacher ""plug in"" the sets;it sits in the middle of the table, and you can hear one another speak through the ""phone piece"".....yeah....get one of those....because communication even with the staff was an exchange of loud almost yelling interaction :) Still thou.....food was pretty darn good.",MZQvu-qcIWP7ujzILtD6tQ,1,1,3,ap2qs0nsCKsSk4ItYBt_RA
1162095,2018-04-07,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Went to TMV today. Great ambiance and service. I gave 3 stars because I was so looking forward to the V'eggs Benny but when I started eating it, it was way too spicy. The dish looked like the real deal but If TMV is going to make dishes spicy people need to decide if they want that. Eating with your eyes is very, very important but enjoying what you're eating is just as important.

We will be back and hopefully the chef will notice my advice.",nyHG_ocmqqt_TSZmeN4xCQ,2,0,3,aO_Hy0pAfv94GB_z9lNMrg
1175458,2018-06-29,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"We had friends from out of town came to visit us. They said they want to treat us to a meal in exchange for some show tickets. We took them to TMV. We told them we became vegan 2 years ago and they immediately told us ""the kids won't eat vegan..."" Strange, the kids are 5 and 9 they don't even know what vegan is.....  The kids were pouting because the parents already poisoned their views of ""vegan food"" and kinda presented ""vegan"" as a nasty word to them. The kids pouted the whole time they were in the restaurant. The parents ordered mac and cheese for their kids and they didn't touch it saying they don't like the flavor. I tried it and it tasted amazing. Anyways the server found out the kids didn't touch their food and took the items off the bill. It was a very nice gesture. My husband and I had Chicken and Waffles and cleaned out our plates. I really appreciate TMV's staff looking out for their customers.",OQqBdDPBXYXQY0qRL20Dew,0,0,5,qKuv7r1Nc64lJ-1J4ZR58w
1190055,2018-04-23,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"This place was absolutely amazing! I went with my Bf and my friend(neither of them are vegan) and they thought the food was amazing! When we first entered, we were greeted with a smile by the woman at the door and we were seated immediately. The place is super cute inside and a lot bigger than I was expecting. The decor is so cute and the windows are all tinted so you're not catching and glares or heat from the outside. The menu has to be one of the most extensive vegan menus I have ever seen and I'm used to vegan restaurants because Los Angeles has a ton. This was definitely the biggest selection I have ever seen. It was as overwhelming as the Cheesecake Factory menu. They have breakfast options, wraps, burgers, salads, Thai inspired dishes, Mexican inspired dishes, and a bunch of desserts. Their portions are really big so keep that in mind. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my BF got the chicken and waffles. We could not finish both as they don't play around with the portions lol. Both were so good. The breading on their chicken is so crunchy and the chicken tastes so bomb! My friend could not believe he was eating vegan chicken. He was thoroughly impressed. I wish I could have tried more off of the menu, but we were stuffed afterwards. Also, they don't allow you to sub the onion rings for the fries, even at an additional charge. I was kind of bummed about that since you don't find many places with vegan onion rings. They do have it as a side order but I knew French fries and onion rings would have been too much food. I also got their strawberry rum drink called Desert Crush and it was so good!! When I am back in Vegas, I will be sure to hit this place up again!!",9qfWKMI0nKJy7Ezq1l69xw,1,1,5,PNTAangucTsnMVvcQHY3vQ
1193140,2018-03-18,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,It's pretty good but very pricey for what it is. It's still new so there a few kinks that need to be worked out but overall it was a nice and enjoyably decent experience. Hopefully it stays open but I doubt the area it's located in can support a vegan restaurant at this price point. The real test for longetivity will be if it can get through the summer when UNLV isn't in session.,p-KB3HUPOMw5yvRoqzWmqw,2,0,3,QqjjDg-7SVB4euSKpu8zDA

1318737,2018-04-07,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Had to try the new talk of the town in the vegan Vegas community since I was in town this weekend! 1st off, don't get discouraged from the off the beaten path location because once you step through their doors, it's very visually appealing. A modern diner feel with lounge couches! I almost plopped on one after my meal! Speaking of meals, I ordered the popular vegan chicken & waffles. OMG, living in Cali has made me forget how big Vegas does it because I couldn't even finish the whole thing! The waffles were crispy on the outside & chewy inside, the chicken was thick & cooked to crispy perfection, in between the waffles were 2 strips of what looked & tasted live Veggie Life bacon, and they put a heaping scoop of mashed potatoes on the bottom, then drizzled maple syrup on top!

Our server was helpful and attentive in making suggestions and letting us know what the favorites were. There was a bit of an issue with two people in our parties orders. The kitchen was out of pretzel buns. This was fine and they opted for the only other option given to them, sourdough. Our server came back saying the chef suggested they pick something else as their sandwich / burger choices were tailored to that bread choice. Understandable. They picked something else. We also split the nachos between the 4 of us with bits left on the platter. Our food came out in a timely manner, two at a time as the orders were out in. I got the chickn' and waffles... so good. Hit the spot on all levels of sweet and savory. And it's a tower of food see photo! Totally shareable. I didn't fully know what to expect but was happy to see asparagus and a bed of mashed potatoes that soak up some of the syrup... perfect. We also tried that Mac n cheese and weren't impressed there. The Ruben was good but the other sandwich at the table was not a big hit. The menu has something for everyone and a bit more. You can enjoy an adult beverage of grab wellness shots and smoothies.

I bet their chicken sandwiches/burgers are amazing too, if made with that same fried chicken patty. My husband got the biscuits & gravy, which tasted pretty good but was not as filling as my dish.

The service was spectacular. My mom is the least spice tolerant person ever and they changed out her order of pad thai (which we confirmed was not spicy prior to ordering it, but it came with hot peppers) right away.

1588300,2018-05-11,10,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Full disclosure, I'm so not vegan. But I do stick to a meatless menu plan a couple days a week and have made several visits here over the past couple months trying a little bit of everything. I like what TMV offers for those with specialized diets, but those assuming ""vegan"" is synonymous with ""healthy"" will likely be overwhelmed by the massive menu that largely covers all the cheat meal bases from nachos and poutine to burgers and tacos. Luckily, they still have juices, smoothies, salads, and sandwiches for those wanting lighter options.

HITS:
The Mexicana breakfast tacos are huge and tasty portion with three overflowing tacos. The cauliflower buffalo ""wings"" are among the best I've tried in terms of texture and even reheated well the next day. The hearts of palm-based ""lobster"" roll was impressive, with a tart and tangy sauce and a huge portion (an ongoing theme). The baked mac and cheese sauce was creamier than other versions I've tried and I think I detected a hint of butternut squash? Their sauces overall are one of their strengths. From the burger category, I customized the Cowboy (featuring Beyond Meat products) and enjoyed it as much as a regular burger, and the pretzel bun held up better than other vegan versions I've had around town, would omit the ""bacon"" next time.

SERVICE: 
I've sat at the high top tables at the bar for all visits and usually get Anthony as my server, and have yet to encounter any of the service issues mentioned in other reviews. He's attentive and personable and I appreciate that I get my check taken care of quickly when I'm on limited time. Reading the snarky owner responses to low reviews is a turn off but I have only encountered positive vibes on site. 

SUGGESTIONS:
Portions are enormous which make the $10-15/dish prices reasonable but some of the apps are large enough to be meals in themselves, which could be adjusted or offered as half portions with lower pricing. Though I liked the tacos, the tortillas themselves didn't hold up well and their waffles are huge and dense. 

Overall, I think they could pare down the menu a bit to improve quality. I appreciate that they offer so much but by now there's bound to be stuff that doesn't perform well or simply doesn't get ordered often. I am looking forward to bringing some vegan friends here who have just moved to Vegas- next I plan to try the loaded queso and the fish tacos!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,19,4,7AqSCO1Ks1udin3JwKPZVA

Our waiter came by and introduced himself and was really polite and friendly, also informing us that the kitchen is free flowing before we ordered, so food comes out when ready which was helpful so no questions asked.  I asked the waiter for ice and lemon, he had no problem with it and even brought a carafe because the glasses are a bit short, which I thought was really cool.  My husband ordered a lemonade I tried a sip and it was refreshing, but needed more sweetness to it.  So I think he will order something different next time.

The buffalo chicken sandwhich was so delish! Crispy goodness and fresh veggies and the pretzel bun was great!  The side mac n cheese came before everything we devoured it, the flavor was on point.

Why didn't you just have them redo it as the customer wanted it, at least be nice about it but my bf accepted since we didn't want to wait 15 min. Food was alright, the breakfast burrito was cold. My bf never complains but today was the first time I heard him say something bad about service and food. When we finished, our server gave us our check very rudely.

1820846,2018-03-19,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Update:  I accidentally deleted the TMV response laughing at my food poisoning and telling me it could not have possibly happened there and to look at everything else I ate that day. I will let you know it is the only place we ate all day and we were the last table of the day.  I certainly hope you are reviewing handling and prep practices.  A posted picture of your Queso from earlier showed it topped with red and green peppers.  Ours came out with a big glob of shredded lettuce on it which is where I think the problem came from as this is the only thing we shared besides the cheesecake. Probably a substitution after you ran out of ingredients.  

I would like to sincerely thank you for your concern and suggest that some customer service training may be in order as well when it comes to handling dissatisfied customers.  

Let me start by saying we have really been looking forward to this place opening and really wanted it to be great.  Any new opening is going to have challenges.  I'll explain the 1 star rating upfront.   My wife and I ate there Saturday afternoon, two words, food poisoning.  She got sick first out of nowhere  about 6 hours after we ate and I quickly followed suit.   Been getting sick all night.  The one dish we shared was the Queso dip.

We got there at 1:30 PM, and did not get seated until after 3 PM.  Tables were full, several had ""Reserved"" signs on them with no people.  It was very noticeable that there was no food coming out of the kitchen.  As tables started emptying out, they would not seat anyone because the kitchen was so backed up. They also were turning people away at the door with the restaurant half empty.

We were able to order after 3 PM and placed our entire order at once so we would not have to wait any longer than necessary.  They were out of most of our first choices, I finally just asked the server what they did have instead of continuing to be told they were out.  We ordered the Queso appetizer,  the Ruben, the meatball sub and the Cheese Cake Sampler.  

The Queso had a very strong Nutritional Yeast taste.  ur desert came out 10 minutes before we saw our sandwiches.  Definitely have timing issues that may get worked out over time.  My wife really liked the Ruben.  The meatballs on the Meatball Sub were well seasoned.  The sandwich was supposed to have melted ""Mozzarella"".  It came with what looked like Daiya shredded Mozzarella that was ice cold.   The cheese cake was fine.  Kind of a play on Peanut Butter and Jelly.   

The Hostess spent most of her time apologizing.  Does not appear they were ready.  We were alreay talking about giving TMV another shot during he week, unfortunately, die to the food poisoning, we will not be going back.",4IRWJmX0n7FHpjlhhvYPwg,9,0,1,tXYlTPzZ1Ok17gXVRG9wpg

1884127,2018-04-15,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"If I have to sum up the restaurant in one sentence, it is a slightly overpriced place that serves delicious comfort-food style vegan dishes, and A LOT of them. 

The menu is HUGE. However, if you dive into it, you'll find familiarity in each item, and it becomes less daunting. Imagine a PT's (or a Gold Sierra's) menu, and substitute the protein and cheese in those sandwiches, burgers, and appetizers with vegan meat and vegan cheese. 

We ordered the Queso Dip, mac&cheese, the lobster roll and the buffalo chicken burger. It was amazing to think that none of these dishes were made from animal protein. The seasoning and creative usage of different types of veggies alone brought out layers of flavors. The reason for 1 less star was 1) the price. I know eating Vegan is a little more expensive, but everything can be about $2-$3 less on the menu, and will keep me on the hook to go back on a weekly basis; 2) the fine details. If I were to pay that price, I expected a little bit more refinement in each dish (talking about presentation, garnish, final touches, etc.)

Is this a place to eat super healthy (think Panacea) ? Probably not. But is this the place to satisfy your cravings and convince your meat-eating friends (or yourself) that vegan doesn't mean bland food? Absolutely!",M2whdwvMtNxLllxOvt7cOw,7,1,4,2PnhJrEbwva-jvTFkNPjSA

Our waiters, Kim,  greeted us and asked for our drink order. There was no juicer and so no way to make any of the juices and for some reason no way to make the smoothies. So we got water and my daughter got a sprite. The sprite came in a can which I hate cause that means you pay per drink.  They should have a soda machine because the meal is already so pricey.  The water had a funny taste to it and we sent it back. I had Kim bring me another one but it still tasted funny. Also there was a huge list of foods they were our of. My daughter wanted the pulled pork sliders but they couldn't make them without the mayo and so she got the spaghetti and meatballs. It seemed a little small to me but the sauce tasted great and was had lots of veggies on it which I love. I ordered the v'eggs Benny which was wonderful. And the asparagus that came with it were great as were the mashed potatoes that my daughter ate half of. Alao we ordered the cauliflower wings with a medium aauce which came with fries.  Both were very tasty and i loved the breading on the cauliflower. Kim checked on us often and brought extra napkins,  salt and pepper. I ordered a 2nd sprite due to the water issue.  Then at the end alot of the desserts I wanted to try were also out. But my daughter was full so we left without. We paid $60 which is a hefty price for 2 people but we loved the food so we'll be back. I hope they get the water to taste better,  get in everything they ran out of and allow for more modifications I'm the future.

One random experience here that happened a few weeks ago occurred when they bring us the Gia waffles and there's almost zero syrup on it, kinda just tasted like sweet bread at that point. whatever no biggie, so i tell the waitress the waffles are a little dry and ask to get some more syrup... ""okay its gonna be 75 cents if you want more"" lol what? i'm expressing that i'm not fully satisfied with the waffles and your gonna charge me for it? i guarantee the blonde owner in the kitchen purposely puts such a small amount on the waffles knowing almost everyone will want more. 75 cents for 2 tablespoons of syrup surely adds up. yeah probably not gonna eat here again the more i think about it. i've regretfully given this place about $300 of my dollars, yikes.",tfoGkmWiOgoQNbBqvyvfDw,2,0,1,LbPGwpImtqMtloviHyG4VA

2396486,2018-06-11,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Damn. I REALLY wanted to get behind this place because I love when new vegan joints open up here and I want to love them and support them but unfortunately they kind of missed the mark.
I've tried this place out twice now and unfortunately, I don't think I'll be returning.

The first time we came we tried the Frenchie, V'eggs Benedict and a side of their Baked Mac n Cheese. 
Hunnie Bunnie liked her French toast and the mac n cheese was pretty good - they make their own cheese sauce and it's very CHEESE-LIKE and SAUCY! But the V'eggs Benedict was DRENCHED in sauce, I had to scrape most of it off and the dish itself was rather flavorless.

The second time we came we tried several items:
Spaghetti and Meatballs: Not enough sauce or flavor. 
Eggplant Bolognese: Not enough sauce or flavor either. 
Buffalo Chick'n sandwich: This was pretty freakin good, but honestly what isn't when it's drenched in a delicious sauce? 
Popcorn chicken appetizer: These were pretty good as well, they tasted like actual popcorn chicken. 
Mashed potatoes: Barely warm and no flavor. 
Onion rings: The breading wouldn't stay on to save its' life and there was ZERO flavor. It does come with a dipping sauce but it should have good flavor WITHOUT the sauce. 
I had also asked for a side of cheese sauce because I wanted to dip my fries in it when I got my sandwich but they brought it out with the popcorn chicken. 

They brought the appetizer out first WITH my cheese sauce which I thought was odd because I wanted the cheese sauce to dip my fries in when I got my sandwich. 
And after that the rest of the food kind of trickled out. The mashed potatoes side. And then the two pasta dishes a little later and then the onion rings and then finally my sandwich - it dragged because the server thought I ordered something else. 
I really wish I could have ranted and raved about how amazing this place is. The menu is huge and looks like it has great potential but the food is expensive and flavorless.
Chep said it was ""The worst food he's had in Las Vegas in ten years."" I wouldn't say that, but it wasn't GOOD.",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,10,1,2,4jn4LyCIvpwTGD46nTys7Q

5 tables were reserved when we arrived and 4 of them remained reserved during our entire time there (which was about 1.5 hours). Either they reserve them really early or don't cancel reservations when they're too late. Unfortunate, since it looks like they lost business due to wait times being too long.

Food came out pretty fast (like ""no way that could have all been made to order that fast"" fast). I had the chicken and waffles because they were out of the benedicts. It was huge, and tasty...but really cold. Looks like other people had the same issue with that dish.

I've been watching this place on social media for weeks and was so excited for it to finally open. I honestly didn't have high expectations for opening day as I know it takes time to work out kinks and get the flow down - but I went anyway because I wanted to be supportive of a new vegan restaurant. Unfortunately, the experience was even worse than my low expectations. 

The place was busy but not overwhelmed, we only waited 10 minutes or so to be seated for lunch. We were given our drinks and our server took our order...and then nothing for an HOUR! Our server literally would not make eye contact with us and ignored us the entire time. We finally flagged her down and asked about our food. She said that food was coming out slow and the table ahead of us had been waiting 2 hours for their food! Seriously?? 2 hours??? She said she was going to go ask about our food and then never came back. This server was terrible. No communication, no apologies, no customer service. Just flat out ignored us. We were starving at this point so after waiting another 15 minutes and no news we decided to just get up and leave. 

There were some positives that stood out: 
 - The hostess was very pleasant & friendly. 
 - The interior is super cute. 
 - I love the modern vibe (not the traditional ""granola"" vegan spot). 
 - The menu is large and diverse.

The service was actually great, with our table being pre-bussed, all food brought correctly and in a timely manner. Any server available checked on us, as well as the manager, and even the hostess. Our specific server was very helpful, and knowledgeable of the large menu, giving great recommendations. She even had a great sense of humor for our jokes, with a few of her own. My ""know it all"" cocktail was delicious. We ordered an appetizer, breakfast items (available all day), a lunch item and dessert. The lobster roll was actually very good, once your brain gets that it isn't lobster on the 2nd bite and just acknowledges that the flavors are still tasty. The nacho cheese sauce was not our fave, but the rest of the ingredients were good. The biscuits and gravy were delicious and I was so thankful for the suggestion. The banana split, perfect. Real french fries, are always a plus. Portion sizes are sharable, which makes for a great experience. I was so happy we didn't let the reviews deter us, that we went again within a week. My carnivorous teen devoured her meatball sandwich, barely wanting to share. Same with her waffles, which she said were the best ever. The flavor of the falafel was surprisingly fresh and tasty, though the bread maybe just slightly tough, but would still order again. The Italian sandwich was perfectly light and fresh for the 90° day, with their pesto butter adding dimension. The place is bright and clean inside, and they are the perfect gateway to plant-based eating for those who aren't committed yet. Unlike similar places, they have regular sodas, which was a plus for my coke drinking husband. There is a full bar, with tvs that showed a variety of interesting content. My only suggestion would be to please add seat covers to the restrooms. Also, I don't enjoy them being co-ed restrooms, but I won't complain because I know I'm just weird like that lol it is helpful to grab whichever is available, after all. I only wish we didn't live on the other side of town, but my wallet is probably thankful because we'd probably be there again today. There are so many more items we're looking forward to trying.

3091784,2018-03-30,4,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"I had to try this new place in Las Vegas. It is very near the UNLV campus, and frankly, the menu was so big, I think I would probably have to go here 50 times before I could try Everything. What caught My eye immediately was Florentine with mashed potatoes. I am a sucker for mashed potatoes. This dish was beautiful, beautifully presented, great blend of flavors, appetizing in every way, and extremely filling. I had intended to get dessert but forget that. The mashed potatoes were creamy, mashed with skin on, and they had a great flavor from the combination of the other vegetables in this dish. No, I did not lick the plate...

The decor is beautiful clean, black and white, a metaphor for what our food choices should be. Black and white, food is either healthy or it isn't.  The background music is what you would expect for a college location, and the big screen TVs all around displayed adorable animal pictures.

And added bonus, free coffee refills! I completely enjoyed this experience and have every intention to return.",LMoosxMf3I4ZOZhqCBRQ_Q,9,6,5,kBvdvZtjEL8EN2FSPXsDkg

The ambiance is really modern and clean. The hostess and waiters all smile and very nice. Our waitress even told us what they are no longer serving and was very knowledgeable about the menu. The food came out in about 10-15 minutes which we are willing to wait for because the food is made to order. 

And of course, as with most vegan restaurants, the majority of items are soy based. Not the best option but considering I only eat halal meat which is not easy to come by, I didn't complain.

Cosmopolitan smoothie: really liked it, was smooth consistency and had good flavors. Didn't overpower our meal.

Truffle Mushroom soup: had really good flavor, but the consistency wasn't creamy enough. Did not taste any truffle flavor. Just call it mushroom soup and I would still eat it.

Side of mac & cheese: slightly bland, missing a bit of salt. It has potential though. There were some vegan bacon bits in there which gave it good texture.

The Buffalo burger w/fries: the tastiest vegan burger according to my fiancé. It had a good buffalo flavor, but it didn't overpower the sandwich.
The avocado was a nice touch. He asked for ranch on the side which made it super tasty. Fries a little under salted, but the crispiness was good.

The Rancho w/salad: Definitely bit off more than I could chew with this one. Didn't realize it came with a double chick'n patty, but I ended up taking the second one home. The patty is super crunchy and tasty, and as a whole that burger was delicious! I like that they used spinach for the salad. I got the dressing on the side.

The service: We were seated right away and the restaurant still had a decent amount of people at their tables. Our server Missy was very nice and helped me pinpoint which burger to get. It looked like the place was pretty busy and only 3 servers I think? Either way, there was always someone to refill our waters and check on us to make sure we were okay or if we needed anything. 

The price: A bit pricey, but tasty and worth it to go once in a while for a nice meal. The quality is on point.

3289377,2018-04-27,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"This place is amazing. Absolutely 5/5. It was our first time there and we ordered as much as we could just to get a pretty good range of dishes. 

They were sold out of the fried cheddar, but we went ahead and tasted the Mac and Cheese. Definitely delicious! Honestly it's in my top three vegan macaroni and cheeses of all time. And I'm picky when it comes to that. Now, understand too that this top-3 Mac and Cheese was the worst thing in this list. Everything else was PHENOMENAL. We ordered corndogs -- the batter is absolutely delicious. Boyfriend had the buffalo burger and if you've read any of the reviews here for it -- you know it's awesome. I went out of my comfort zone and ordered the Louisiana fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. Honestly hats off to our very patient waitress (I wish I'd gotten her name but she knows who she is!) who convinced me to give the gravy a try (I was afraid it would have a strong taste of mushroom when I saw the pics and that's just not my thing)! But it was AMAZING. Tender, juicy, savory and spiced perfectly. There was no hint of mushroom whatsoever. Seriously. You guys. Order THAT. Start there and then try everything else on the menu. 

We also had smoothies (I got the Flamingo and he got the Tropicana).  Both were awesome. Mine was better 

We ordered two additional meals to-go because we wanted to grab as much as we could since we don't live on that side of town: the Philly Cheese and the Rueben sandwiches. I didn't take a bite of my Philly, but the bf took a bite of his Reuben before we left and swears it is the best Reuben he has ever had in his LIFE (this includes real-meat ones)! He said the flavor was on point, the sourkraught was good and crisp and the, ""meat,"" was juicy and not dry like others he's had.

My point is: this place has a HUGE menu, and we got 8 items off the list and they were all fantastic. Don't think this is variety without quality taste. I am honestly blown away by the time and effort that must have been put into opening this restaurant and offering customers the sheer amount of amazing choices. Seriously. We were both impressed.

Not only that but every staff member I interacted with was friendly, courteous and helpful, and honestly I was having a really scary and awful day to cap off some pretty rough weeks and none of them even knows how much this whole experience cheered me up. It was just good food and good people who really cared about their craft. I've still got a lot to deal with, but today at least, will will stand out in my memory a little bit more and for a better reason than it would have been if we'd not decided to give the place a go. 

Everyone I know will be hearing about this place from me.

3304770,2018-04-11,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"I am really excited that Las Vegas is gaining more and more vegan restaurants to ease our minds as we make our decisions for dinner throughout the week. I do think that new restaurants need to do more research about owning a restaurant as a whole before they open the doors. Great food is not the only thing that will keep your business going. You need to have the fundamentals of customer service, execution and presentation of your food and restaurant, and inventory down pat or you'll risk losing a lot of potential clientele simply because you were either ignorant or ill-prepared.

That being said, The Modern Vegan has a very clean look when you walk in, and the staff seems friendly. I was greeted by the hostess immediately who showed me to the bar, which I was excited and surprised to see was a full-service bar. The bartender was also friendly and polite, but you can tell that is stressed out for very a good reason. I sat down close to the food window, and just paid attention while I read through the menu. I will say that I am huge about making sure I don't hear any work drama in front of customers, and I wasn't happy to hear someone yell at the servers about not picking up food fast enough from the window. Say whatever you want, but do not do it in front of customers. It's embarrassing for the employee and kind of sets an aggressive tone around your space.

Back to the menu. It's a massive menu; too massive, if you ask me. Not only was it a lot for me to take in, but it was obviously too much for the kitchen to handle. Half of the items that I ordered were 86'd, including all of their 8 or so soups except for one, two appetizers, the cocktail I ordered, and one sandwich. And that's just based off of what I ordered and overheard people discussing. What I ended up with was the stuffed avocado appetizer, a side of Mac n cheese, and a raw carrot cake Togo.

The food came out quick. I wasn't a fan of the bits in the Mac n cheese, but it was a solid side dish. The avocado I probably wouldn't order again either. There was something in it that was very salty. So I just dumped out the tofu scramble and ate the avocado plain.

That raw carrot cake was probably my favorite thing. It's actually amazing. I would call back to order it Togo, but I did overhear someone on the phone tell the customer that she wouldn't do any take out orders.

I'm honestly not coming back for a while, until the buzz dies down and they figure some things out. I get that a new business needs to learn, which is why I'm reiterating that before opening up a business, some research needs to be done. If all you have is one soup, then do a soup of the day. Don't try to keep up with that huge menu. Customers get disgruntled if they can get what they want, and my second and third choices will never taste as good as what I originally wanted to dine in for.

I want to see vegan restaurants thrive in Las Vegas. Hopefully whenever I come back, I can edit this review and tell you how wonderful everything is.",fRF4w7Oe-zDmyjDGFoSYJQ,10,0,3,3gj7_6N4w7zRTRKvpAcNDw

- tasty food which is the most important thing 
- lots of options to choose from 
- not the most affordable pricing but I'm willing to pay a little more to support a vegan establishment so it's all good 

CONS:
- lots of options and therefore many things were not available which is annoying cuz then why is it even on the menu? 
- the girls that work there (other than the obvious owner and the hostess) made it awkward -it was like being in a high school cafeteria with the posse of girls in the corner talking shit - I shouldn't see you talking about us - that's not professional or cool - plus it doesn't get you a good tip 
- dirty dish that had to be sent back for another - absolutely unacceptable!

3359844,2018-03-23,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"I hate to give this place such a low review, but they really gave me no choice with all the issues they had today. It's been exactly one week since they've opened so I will definitely come back in a month or so when they're more in the swing of things

The restaurant wasn't full of people when I came in so I was looking forward to decent wait times.  I started off with the flamingo smoothie and it took about 10-15 min to get it. For a $7 smoothie I feel like I should've gotten a bigger portion and it wasn't very sweet. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles and the wait time was about 30 min, which is fair. The presentation was great; however, the waffles were borderline cold and they were not crispy on the outside at all. It was more like chicken and pancakes than chicken and waffles. It was also served on top of mashed potatoes which made them a little soggy. I had to ask for a side of salt because the potatoes were so bland. Additionally, there was no syrup on top of my waffles, just butter. All of the syrup was on the bottom of the plate and got into half of the mashed potatoes, which made them sweet instead of savory (you can see in the picture).  I had to ask for two sides of syrup so I could actually get some on my waffles and came to find out they charged extra for it.
The fried chicken was amazing! It was crispy, juicy and so far the best vegan chicken I've ever had. I got a refill of my smoothie and the second one was way better than the first one.

 I also had the TMV cheese fries, which were okay. The fries by themselves were pretty good but the queso had no flavor to it at all. It seemed like it was there for nothing more than to look like cheese because it didn't taste like anything. I ended up dipping the fries in ketchup because I couldn't get on board with the bland cheese. 

I ended up having a lot of left over food and when I asked my waitress for a to-go box she told me that they didn't have any. I was pretty done at that point, how does a restaurant not have to-go boxes? Needless to say I had to waste the generous amount of leftover food I had and was very disappointed with my experience. I will visit again eventually to give them a chance to redeem themselves. I hope their service gets better.",f-Qepve8hGa9mE6YuTPe3w,6,0,2,ajc3T7jNzMNJqFER8T2HfQ

The location was easy to find and easy to park. 

The menu is huge, ""we don't know what we specialize in"" huge. 
They were out of a lot of food when we went.
The way that was presented to us was like this was already a norm. 
An entree will run you $15.00 a plate. 

Our server was not attentive whatsoever.. she seemed a little clueless, she took our order for coffee and food, someone else brought out our food, not at the same time but in reasonable enough time that it was ok but we never saw our server again until we waved her down for our bill 25 mins later where she returned and asked if we wanted to order more food.. 

I wanted ketchup, a refill on coffee, a spoon for my coffee, but I had almost eaten it all by then. But no I didn't want to order more food. Weird. 


In the meantime, a manager, possibly owner or just a much more attentive server passed and asked if we wanted more coffee, and asked how our food was which gave us the opportunity to tell him that our experience wasnt too good. He asked if we had ""asked"" for any ketchup.. and to that I hope he realized that it was hard enough to finally get some more coffee.. no one was available in our direction and for half of our sitting, we believed someone would come eventually.

My burrito was cold with cold ingredients intentionally making it that temp. I could tell it was on purpose, cold beans, lettuce, lots of pico, a little bit of chkn but yet it was a cold burrito and therefore it should be called a WRAP. When I told the gentleman who worked there this he seemed surprised that it was cold and went and talked to the cook I think. When he came back he informed us that it was supposed to be cold. I had already come to this conclusion but my point is that it's weird to serve things that are generally hot , cold without fair warning. 

Here's the thing, it's new.. it's working through glitches and growing pains. But the bad server with the nose ring and animated features, she's not doing this restaurants name any favor. The menu is too big and it's missing half the things anyway. For $15.00 the breakfast burrito doesn't hold up with any other vegan burrito in town. For $3.00 coffee please refill it at least once.. please offer a spoon and condiments when you bring the food.

3522531,2018-05-29,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"To get to the point of why 2 stars:
Service- the server couldn't make a recommendation which is part of her job; our food came out late and way after other people who were seated after us got there food. 
Menu- the kitchen was backed up and can't seem to handle such a large menu
Food- lobster sandwich was possibly made with heart of palm that was way too salty. Corn dogs were actually really really good! So were our alcoholic becer
Portion and price- too big and too high; appetizers such as corn dogs come too big (4 whole corn dogs). They should cut the price and the portion so people can afford the food and be able to try more without getting stuffed. Overall, the prices on the menu are too expensive for the experience and the location which is not the safest area and a bit run down. 

TMV is new and maybe with a little time they will improve, I hope. Great items on the menu I would look forward to trying in 6months when I give them another chance. 

Update 5/26 visit ( won't go again)

This food was delicious but the service; here is my feedback: we were the first ones there in the morning when they opened. the skillet came out 12 minutes before the waffle. One waitress came by and said it was because the food is made to order and we only have one waffle iron. The next server blamed it on ""new cooks"". Why can no one take ownership for the issue? My silverware was placed on a dirty silicone mat when they took my skillet away to keep it warm. I asked for new silverware and they asked me why? Gross! You know I had a very bad experience but I had no ""Service recovery"". Nothing was comped on my bill. This is the second time I tried eating there and I won't be back again.

I came here last Thursday around 6 and the place was pretty much empty. I sat first and waited for my friend to join me. I'm big on service and this place lacked just that. Browsing the menu while I waited, the lobster role caught my eye; wondering what the substitute for the ""lobster"" was I decided to ask our server as the menu just described it as a ""super secret recipe"".  I couldn't tell if she was new or just extremely awkward- asking her questions almost made me uncomfortable (that's how bad it was). Anyways, her response to the lobster substitute question was ""I don't think they'll tell me because it says super secret"" lol what-- what if I have an allergy. Weird. Another woman who looked like a manager later advised us it was heart of palm. 

We ordered the fish tacos, the Buffalo, and the lobster roll. The fish tacos were mediocre at best and really lacked flavor. The buffalo, on the other hand, was exceptional FULL of flavor and the chicken substitute had great texture- highly recommend! The lobster roll was massive but was absolutely horrible- the sauce they smother it in is so overpowering and ruins the whole thing. It does not taste like a lobster role whatsoever; even with consideration of it being ""vegan"". 

Service was definitely lacking but I'd give them the benefit of the doubt as the place is still pretty new. Food was ""eh"" but the menu was very extensive so I'd probably give them another try. I'm still team Vegenation for now though.",xFIJOdPk3SQWUm4wadPnUg,4,2,2,I0Vo2f0WdhTbLf2gmW7GEw

3631211,2018-04-12,7,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Let's get down to business.

First of all. I hate giving 1 stars, I love seeing vegan places open up and grow. I love the ambience of the place. Modern, nice and white good for the eyes. All the servers, hosts were awesome! Tatted up, different styles, they were free and I love that about this place so as far as customer service that's a 5 star for me. The employees are all 5 stars because it made me happy that they didn't need to wear a uniform and just dressed as they pleased kind of feeling.

I'm upset o have to give this rating but I am because the pricing of the food is ridiculous for the quality. I dont mind spending $50+ on a couple items as long as that stuff is good but no go for me here. 

Now, it's time to be cut throat because we are now talking about the food industry as I own 2 places myself here in Las Vegas. People being cut throat with me is how one of my places is doing so well because I turned tragic into triumph. 

Down to the food:

$5 Side of baked mac n cheese: Tasted like cardboard, not only once but after every single bite tasted like cardboard. Bland, the flavor was off and there was just something missing. I think it was the cheesiness part, I finished it though cause there's was like 6 bites because of the portion size, or maybe my fatass was just making it 6 bites. Lol. 

$8 New York New York Smoothie: Was not a smoothie, it was a chunky chocolate milk. I couldn't taste much, all the flavors of the banana, cacao, agave were so light. Thus far, it was good but I tasted the stinginess of ingredients in the drink. 

$15 Biscuits and Gravy: Gravy tasted like it was sitting in a stainless steel container for a couple days. Like, canned gravy with a lot of herbs and some rusty metallic flavor. Biscuit had no flavor, flat top on butter? With a little garlic powder. Rosemary infused butter maybe? Mashed potatoes, I know have been sitting in a container. Discoloration, the texture and the moisture of water coming out of the mash I knowing it's been sitting. Bland.

$11 Zuchini Fritters: chopped up zucchini inside a ball of unseasoned flour and some gooey stuff which I think should have been cheese. It was my least favorite item I've gotten out of this meal. The texture was good but the flavor was just not having it, this item was poorly put together. The tzatziki sauce was good though.

$14 Buffalo Burger: Soft Pretzel bun, with a breaded chick'n tossed in buffalo. Not bad at all. I liked it, fries were unseasoned, at least mine were but the burger wasn't half bad. I took it to go.

The problem I see having a big menu is that the lack of flavor falls off all of the items. I didn't get to taste it all but as of asking the server the most popular items I got 2 of them. I most likely will be back because I want to change this review but as of today it's a 1 star for me. I came here from all the hype on the LAS VEGANS GROUP page but that all got shot down.",TzNLJk71OoTL293YP8sghA,24,1,1,LhSoVYQze9g_9lCH3xlFFg

That's not the case here - very greasy/oily/over processed foods. I felt awful after. I'll still leave 3 stars because it is what it is, vegan junk food has it's place occasionally.

I don't recommend the gyro though. Something just tasted so off.. and it certainly was not served on a pita. Also what's with the weird tasting warm water with no ice....?

3828489,2018-03-31,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Over processed and over priced. Food - 3 Stars. Service - 2 Stars. Prices - 3 Stars. 

Food: The food was decent, but I had to scour the menu for something that was not over processed chemical versions of omnivore food. As a vegan, I wish vegan restaurants would embrace vegetables, nut cheeses, tofu, etc. and NOT processed fake meats and chicken. The menu is extensive and the restaurant is missing half the ingredients. The waitress must have returned to the table five times to say they were out of something. 

Service: At first, our service was just fine, but then the waitress got busy. Not her fault at all. But while I sat there for twenty minutes after finishing my food, waiting for the check, I could not help but notice the four people behind the bar doing nothing. One was looking over ordering and appeared to be the owner. This is for you: help your employees! It looks so bad and is irritating to watch one waitress cover ten tables while the rest of you stand around. 

Prices: WAY overpriced for what it is, honestly.

3866834,2018-05-15,7,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"I've been wanting to try this place out since they opened. I attempted one time to go and order some dinner to take home but they don't let you order to go which means I would really never get to come here often because they're closed Tuesday and they close at 6pm on operating days.

So I was able to pick anywhere I wanted to for Mother's Day and TMV was the first thing that came to mind! I was so looking forward to trying it and my daughter and I got dressed up and to go eat.

When you walk in the place is nice and clean the hostess was nice sat us down and our server came over to take our order. I always order my daughters food first even if I'm not ready to order and all she wanted was a order of fries with cheese. The server said (the cheese is vegan) is that ok?! What!!? This is a vegan restaurant so would hope the cheese was vegan. So she puts in her order then we put in 2 more orders and while we waited we got served the smallest cups of warm water. 
So our first order comes out, not my daughters order so we don't eat until all of us have our food.
We told someone we were waiting for my daughters fries with cheese and they still came out with our other order plus appetizer and not my daughters food. So we told them once again our daughter doesn't have her food so we're waiting to eat.

Then a server finally brings out her order and says it's way too hot and sorry they didn't know it was for a child! Even after making it very clear and my daughter is the one that asked for it. By this time I was not happy with the service I could understand if it was super busy but that was not the case.

The food was alright not what I thought it would be my coleslaw had no flavor and my other food was already cold from waiting so long. 
So I asked for my food to go.

One more thing I want to add is 11$ for 3 jalapeño poppers to me is a little much! I never complain about prices especially if the food is good in this case it wasn't worth the price.

I was really disappointed all around and don't think I'll go back which is a bummer because I love to support our local vegan businesses.

I had the buffalo cauliflower and ""chicken"" popcorn and both were crazy good. Excellent side sauces. My man had the tofu pinwheel and it was just so-so, but his ""pulled pork"" burger on a pretzel bun was great (best bun ever, he says).

He wants to come back and try the ""cheese steak"" because he feels like they understand ""meat"" textures here. Next time, I want to try their ""chicken soup"" and one of their salads--and I definitely want to have one if not both of their interesting avo toast options. Very creative takes on a staple.

The staff was extremely friendly and upbeat and several people were servicing our table, so we never needed to ask for or wait for anything.

Customer service was great, everyone kept apologizing however they had nothing to apologize for there was no delay or anything. Now this a big pet peeve, and lots of resturants do it and i feel it is unacceptable. When someone orders an appetizer that comes before your entree to hold you over, if you bring the appetizer with the entree first thats too much to eat at once, also it make the table a cluster eff with plates everywhere. Please can restuarants stop this, its resturant management 101. Now most people think fried foods take no skill, but they are complex because the outside can be cooked but the inside can be cold unfortunately that is what happened with the mac and cheese baseballs. Maybe just check the temp before hand. My sons frenchie came out about half way through our meal, mostly because i think they may have forgot. He ate my fries though so not too big of an issue. The lobster roll was good, i wont fault them it just wasnt what i wanted on my taste buds (they were out of what i really wanted) the regular mac and cheese was luke warm but that could be because out of precedent i wouldnt eat it until i finished my appetizer. But it was much better then the fried baseballs. My boyfriend LOVED his southern fried chicken and i loved my sons frenchie. Then dessert we got the banana split. I would have really loved if it was a normal banana split i havent had one since i went vegan 6 years ago. However it was very good.

THIS IS AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS FOOD. PERIOD.  If you're reading reviews and trying to decide if you should dine here- I'll be the one to say it. The answer is YES. You NEED to experience the culinary genius that is The Modern Vegan. Mark my words this spot will become a popular and well known vegas destination before you know it! 

Herbivore and carnivores unite because everything we ordered was beyond delicious. 

Where do I even begin? My cousin and I decided to pop in after a day at the pool. We were greeted with a warm and friendly ambiance along with open arms. The restaurant is so chic and fabulous. Honestly it's every insta foodies dream. 
The manager was so kind to take the time to seat us and fill us in on the interesting backstory of the incredibly talented  woman who is behind this fun and vibey joint. 

After being seated, were promptly greeted by our server who was more than willing to give suggestions. (Which we appreciated)
The menu was unlike anything I've ever seen. It's ENORMOUS actually. The options are endless. Which as a non meat eater, I felt as though I had just hit some sort of jack pot! 

We decided to order the club with vegan bacon and the buffalo chicken sandwich and split both down the middle so that we can share. 

THE FOOD. No words that I type on this review will even come close to expressing how unbelievably delicious BOTH sandwiches are. The buffalo chicken sandwich was SPOT ON. The texture, the flavor, and even the appearance. With our first bite we both let out an unintentional food moan as our eyes grew as big as saucers. My world was officially shook. Everything about this buffalo chicken sandwich was pure perfection. The selfish foodie in me was honestly a bit bummed I had to share in that moment....  but now after experiencing it I want to share this place with everyone! 

The club sandwich was equally as life changing. It was monstrous in size and so so so tasty. I couldn't get over the bacon. It tasted just like a traditional club sandwich. This club had cucumbers- which happened to be one of our favorite things about this club. It gave the most delicious crunch with each bite. 

We ordered both sandwiches with french fries. (Good decision on our part because the fries are super yum) 

I honestly don't think there was a single morsel of food left on our plates. Throughout the entire duration of our dining experience we could not stop talking about how phenomenal the food was. Even hours after we ate, we were still talking about the pure creativity and deliciousness of what we experienced. Later that night we were TEXTING each other about. My mouth is no joke watering thinking about our meal just while typing this review. THATS HOW AMAZING THIS FOOD IS. 

The Modern Vegan is a new favorite- and I am already planning a trip back-  not even a full day after dining there for the first time!

The interior is absolutely lovely and nice, ambiance is friendly, very spacious and enough place to seat. 

As we walked in nobody greeted us however there is a host station.
Waited for a waitress around 10 minutes to take our order. I asked for a cup of hot water, but their coffee machine was broken, so I asked to heat it up in a microwave. What as a result took them 30 minutes. 

Served glass of water had a green lipstick trace. It was replaced in 30 minutes as well :/

Food...well, nothing special, we ordered a Pad Thai, it was too oily. And I had a carrot raw cake, which was frozen (although it is claimed that it should be raw and fresh). Didn't taste like a desert at all. For 10$ it is disappointing. 

Wish I could give this place another shot. That have a great potential and definitely happy that we have more and more places for Vegans.
Wish they could add more raw dishes like wraps or desserts, less ""meat"" substitutes (because for lots of Vegas it is unacceptable).

4527867,2018-03-16,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,I'm going to give it 5 star because I know it's going to become better! We drove 30 minutes from Summerlin to check it out. Cool decor and vibe. The  food was insanely good and our waitress was super sweet. This is the second day opened but there are a lot of kinks to work out. I  would start with more training on the menu. There was a lot of I don't know.  The three of us ordered and two meals came out. They ran out of the 3rd option which was a common theme on a lot of items. Again our waitress was super sweet. We were going to come back on Sunday but we're going to let them work out the kinks. I'm giving a 5 star because this place will only get better with practice.

Unfortunately, the times I've gone they're out of half the menu items. And to make matters worse, you're not told they're out til you've already placed your order. This is a common problem for restaurants that have a big menu. I think that's the case with TMV - they haven't learned to manage their inventory because it's too large. They probably need to pair it down a bit. (They should, however, inform customers right when they're seated rather than after they order.)

Today we were told the issue was that 'the waffle iron broke.' Weird, right? Because a restaurant should have more than one. And you can just go buy another one real quick at Target around the corner. Because it's Fathers' Day weekend and likely to be kind of busy for brunch. (Just for the record, they were also out of vanilla ice cream and other items too.)

4598015,2018-03-17,2,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"On a sunny Friday afternoon, the day after its grand opening, my SO and I decided to drive a half hour to try the hot, new restaurant boasting vegan comfort food--an offering that isn't as widely available in Las Vegas as it is in other vegan-friendly cities. Let me start by saying that the menu has an overwhelming number of options, although, nothing compared to the infamous Cheesecake Factory Bible (thank goodness).

As we sat down in the starkly white and monochromatic, IKEA-furnished establishment, I thought to myself that ordering JUST a few dishes would be devastating. But as our smiling server greeted us, she mentioned a long list of items that they were out of. To be quite frank, this was indeed a blessing. The less I had to choose from, the less conflict in my taste buds! Our limited yet still quite varied list of choices allowed us to enjoy three following items: the Louisiana fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy (no coleslaw for me!), a vegan lobster roll with a mountain of French fries, and a heaping side of baked mac and cheese.

Now, I'm not quite sure what it is about this establishment, but I found it so endearing. Maybe it was the Möckelby table in the far end of the room? The millions of pillows nesting on one lonely couch? The strange chain curtains separating the bar? Perhaps the wooden shelves hidden out of plain sight, or the sound of early-2000s Mariah melting into the background of a ""modern"" atmosphere? Stepping into The Modern Vegan, you forget you're on Nellis and are immediately immersed into a different world, the only reminder being your 8-year-old vehicle parked outside the window.

How much do you enjoy eating? If the answer is a lot, then wait-time could be a critical factor to your experience. We found ours to be relatively short. A mere 15 minutes after ordering, a baked mac and cheese was set in front of us, served in a piping-hot, cast-iron pan. It had that quintessential, crumb-top layer that mac and cheese is best known for. And while I thought it lacked cheesiness and needed a pinch of salt, I did in fact eat every single piece of elbow pasta on that pan. The vegan lobster roll didn't taste too much like it's seafood counterpart, but I thought the lobster mixture itself was refreshing and tasty. Add to that, a mountain of fried potato strips... I must admit I've never once met a French fry that I didn't like. 

The true star to me, though, was the fried ""chicken"". I've had many-a-vegan-fried-chik'n's in the past few years of eating a plant based diet and I have to give it to this one. The Modern Vegan nails the batter, the seasoning, and overall flavor. To me, this was just right. It was crisp, but somehow light, and I couldn't help but to think about how a chunk of soy protein isolate could possibly be so, dare I say it... moist? On this spring-sunny day in March, somebody in The Modern Vegan kitchen knew how to work that deep fryer. A pepper-y gravy and some fluffy mashed potatoes complimented the crunchy, crispy, tender and flavorful vegan chicken. I was content. No animals were harmed.

The portions here met the ""American standard"". So much so that after licking each plate clean, the thought of ordering from their list of desserts would have been overkill for two rather petite individuals. Nevertheless, knowing I even had the choice was plenty promising. Seriously, check out those desserts! While The Modern Vegan is not perfect, and is at times reminiscent of a club, it has the potential to be such a great asset to the Las Vegas vegan community. I am definitely returning to The Modern Vegan with a bigger party to try and make my way through their menu. Give it a shot! I'm sure you'll find something you'll like.",KAIG8_R5vcBt-CGUi4bkPA,8,5,4,kK_xN4iOFa27yAw5Ky1voA

4875382,2018-04-15,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Ambiance: modern on a low budget with music at 7/10 in an echoey environment.

The good: Buffalo chicken is top notch. Fries appear fresh cut and are a nice square size in between steak fries and shoestring. No goofy seasoning. Best vegan cheese dishes I've ever had in the queso and Mac and cheese.

The bad: the Lobster roll - lobster being replaced with hearts of Palm is pretty clever. The hot, buttered, soft but crisp roll being replaced with a pale, cold, doughy thing is not. Probably the result of a too-many-items on the menu issue.

The meh: carrot cake has zero carrot flavor but overwhelming almond flavor. Great frosting and consistency and wonderful if you love almond. Weird if you expected carrot.

The price: understanding that quality fresh ingredients cost more, the food prices here still feel a buck or two on the high side. Likely will drop as more vegan competition opens up.

Why go here? Maybe you're a newly converted vegan who would give your left turnip for a spicy buffalo chicken sandwich, or maybe you're super lactose intolerant and could KILL for some queso dip. Or maybe you've been vegan4lyfe and want to convert some of your omnivore friends over to the green side. All good reasons to be a patron.",QCoBkB_m0v9smTM9voMZMg,2,0,3,Jnwril-iPU_gz_N8HK1x8Q
4902309,2018-03-19,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"The menu is extensive which is awesome but food that I ordered was mostly just ok and wait was crazy. Between waiting for a seat and waiting for our food, we spent 2 hours there.  

People who came in after us got their orders first, one table ordered two of the exact same items I did. One of those items we were told was sold out but the other table was able to grab the last two. Felt like there's probably an issue with communication and timing between the front of house and back of house staff. 

I ordered the Louisiana fried chicken. The chicken was good and tasted pretty realistic although I had hoped for more chicken. The entree included a large serving of coleslaw but it was pretty light on the dressing. The mashed potatoes had a coconut flavor which I didn't care for; I'd suggest they switch to using more neutral plant milks and creams for such items. Gravy was ok. Mac and cheese side was again, ok. My mom ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was pretty good. Fries not bad and was a large serving, but slightly mushy.

I went opening weekend though so I expected slow service and some kinks to be worked out. I'll be happy to try again in a few weeks.  I was happy the owner's husband asked us how we enjoyed the meal.

The interior is great, very clean and modern just as the name suggests. On the tv screens above the bar play various viral videos that are quite entertaining. The employee uniforms are grey sweats? Interesting...at least they are comfy at work. The menu is extensive which would be good if every single item is on point; otherwise, it might be better to just narrow the menu down to the best tasting items. It is a bit pricey! I am used to ordering 2 dishes when I eat out because I like to try everything, but at $15 a plate, I may just stick to one dish here. 
I have come here 2 out of the past 3 days. The first day, I came in with my boyfriend. We were pleased to see how busy the place was. I ordered the biscuits & gravy with a cosmopolitan smoothie, and he ordered the French toast & orange juice. When the waitress came with his OJ, I asked about the status of my smoothie to which she replied, ""we don't have smoothies."" I showed her the smoothie on the menu, and then she turned to the bartender to stop making the alcoholic Cosmopolitan she thought I ordered. The waitress then informed us that they do not have smoothies, fresh juices, or açaí bowls available at the restaurant yet. So I just got a glass of water. Moments later, the waitress comes back to tell me that they have run out of biscuits. So I changed my order to the breakfast burrito. Meanwhile, I can hear the owner in the kitchen, yelling out 4 different menu items that they have run out of. Our food arrived at a decent time considering it's pretty hectic in here. My boyfriend enjoyed his French toast, but my breakfast burrito was cold to the touch. The waitress took it back to see if the kitchen could warm it up. When it came back the second time, one spot of the burrito was slightly warmer, but the rest of the burrito was still cold. Not even the cheese was melted. The waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to order something else, but by that time I was just so hungry and tired of waiting that I'd rather just eat part of the cold wrap and potatoes than to wait for something else. I took the burrito home and later warmed it in the oven, and it was good like that...toasted tortilla and melty cheese good! 
I learned on the vegan Facebook group that TMV had made the mistake of not having a mock service or even a soft opening. So I decided to give them another shot. Today, there was a total of 3 of us. Walking in, I noticed the tables weren't as busy as the previous day. There are 7 open tables (4 with ""reserved"" signs); however, there are about 4 parties of 2-3 people waiting to get sat. Maybe they're too understaffed to seat those people? Anyways, I was excited to finally get those biscuits & gravy!! Except, they had ran out. My friend ordered the French toast...ran out of that too. V'eggs Benny? Ran out. V'eggs Florentine? Nope. Any kind of pancakes?? You guessed it...there's no more. 
We ended up ordering the Avocado Toast Trifecta, Anna waffles, Gia waffles, and Lobster Roll. The avocado toasts were good but a little too salty for my taste. Both waffles came out cold, as if they were in a fridge. My friends asked if there could be something done to make the waffles warmer to which the waitress remarked, ""You are the only ones to say that."" She took the waffles back to the kitchen, but when the waffles came back, they were still not much warmer. While they were not as cold as the first time, they were still not ""fresh out of the waffle maker"" warm. Maybe the cold wind coming through the open door of the kitchen is rapidly cooling down the food? Or the cold toppings are cooling down the waffles? Besides the temperature, the waffles themselves were good in taste. Meanwhile, I felt bad for my friends, because I was more than enjoying my lobster roll! I might go as far as to say this is the best lobster roll I've ever had! I could be wrong, but it seems as though the ""lobster"" was made from hearts of palm, giving it the perfect texture. The fries that come with it are quite yummy as well. 
Towards the end of our meal, Todd came to our table. He explained that this is his wife's restaurant, and apologized for any inconveniences we might have experienced. I absolutely LOVE that he came to our table. There are other restaurants at which, the owner will avoid the table if they see a potentially unhappy customer. Because of Todd and the delicious lobster roll, I will continue to support TMV. Todd explained that the restaurant is waiting for some equipment to ship to start serving the fresh juices, smoothies, and açaí bowls. I am obsessed with açaí bowls, so I will definitely be back when they become available. I'm sure as business continues, TMV will work out all the little kinks and improve over time.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,15,7,3,FfTkAI94MUFBcgGj9iH8Sw

We sat at around 1120 and she asked if we wanted coffee. The answer was yes. The only issue with this was she brought the coffee and milk. She didn't bring sugar or water. She went back and brought us sugar. Didn't come back for about 15 minutes. Then she came back to ask if we wanted more coffee. We said yes and before she ran away(which she was in the process of) we had to ask if we could order. Mind you, we've been here almost 30 minutes without even having ordered. She acted a little surprised that we hadn't ordered, which doesn't surprise me, she clearly forgot. 
I didn't have high expectations going into this because with every grand opening there will be issues. 
It took about 5 minutes to bring our water after we had ordered, so about 35 minutes into our service.
Our food from the point we ordered took about 45-1 hour. We ordered 4 dishes and they all came out at separate times. Which is fine. Except tables that got there way after us got there food way before us and had even left before we had anything to eat. 

Again, I work in the service industry. I understand grand openings are essentially trial runs. I wish they had more soft openings to train the staff before the grand opening. Our server clearly had no experience and while she was sweet and quite skilled with her makeup she, without question, needs more training.
I have been in the service industry for 10 years now so please understand that I am obviously a lot more critical than most. 

Only other qualm was the jalapeño poppers are too difficult to eat the way they are served. I wish they were cut in half.
Hope these kinks can be worked out because I'd love to go back and not have it take 2 hours to receive all our food! Again, expected. But also a little disappointing.",r8vALsoTAQnHeNms_Jxn2w,4,0,3,0y_sd1wtdE2twBd3_uGK-Q

5060731,2018-05-04,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"As a vegan, I'm sad to say that I was very disappointed with my experience here. I was weary of this place from the get go because of their GIGANTIC menu. The menu is huge and allllll over the place. From waffles, to pad Thai, to poutine? I think that restaurants are usually better off sticking with smaller menus and having a few amazing dishes rather than dozens of just-okay dishes. I think this is definitely a problem here. 

My boyfriend and I ordered three dishes: the poutine, Louisiana chicken, & the lobster roll. The poutine was the best dish of the bunch, but it still wasn't great. First of all, for an appetizer, the portion was MASSIVE. The fries seemed to be unsalted and a bit under done. The cheese and gravy was just ok, nothing memorable. The Louisiana chicken dish was similar. It was nothing more than just ok. The fried chicken looked good, but it just didn't taste quite right. I've had lots of vegan fried chicken from a variety of restaurants- but this tastes like something you buy frozen and heat up in your microwave. The coleslaw was also not good, it also tasted like something you'd get at a grocery store. The mashed potatoes were probably the best part of the dish, but still nothing I'd go back for. The lobster roll looked great but the taste and texture was just... awful. I never send food back but I had to with this dish, especially considering the high prices here. They took it off the check with no problems and I really appreciated that. 
(Although I didn't enjoy the food much- I do want to say that everything was plated quite beautifully!) 

Besides the food, the service was pretty good and everyone was very nice. The decor wasn't bad, however it was a confusing feel. It's like they mixed together a fancier restaurant with a fast casual cafe. They had a gigantic bar but such a small kitchen, which just didn't make sense to me. If the restaurant closes at 6pm, is a huge bar really necessary? I've worked as a cook in a couple different restaurants and I cannot begin to fathom how they cook everything on their menu in their tiny kitchen. It blows my mind. I currently work at a restaurant with a menu 1/3 the size of their menu, but our kitchen is 3x the size of theirs! This is probably part of the reason the quality of the food was lacking. I feel like the owners might not come from a food service background, or were maybe just too ambitious? 

Overall, I really, really wanted to like this place and I hate to see a vegan business do poorly. However, I  think there's a lot of things that need to be fixed for the restaurant to live up to its potential. With a much smaller (& more focused) menu, revamping the kitchen, and maybe bringing in someone with more experience in this industry this place could be successful.",-K-xNfoOcR1mKOE9EycpwA,11,3,2,Gxs2xdgOoZjtr2nsfb-ctA

I recently turned vegan and was amazed with the numerous about of vegan spots around the Henderson area. I heard great reviews about the Modern vegan via yelp. So I tried it for myself. 5 stars! As soon as u arrive to the parking lot you can tell this place is going to be delicious . The decor and detail of the place matches the menu. I arrived around 4 and the friendly hostess greeted me. I ordered the mac n cheese balls but they ran out & also ran out of sweet potatoes fries. When I heard that I knew this place was poppin. The waitstaff and bartenders were absolutely the most friendliest people to wait on me. 

Now let's talk about the food! I got the jalapeño poppers and baked mac n cheese! DELICIOUS ! Hands down the best vegan mac n cheese I've ever tasted. It was creamy but not thick. Every bite was a water fall in my mouth! The poppers were just as good. The filling wasn't too much , just right. It mixed well with the house sauce that comes with it, and a Jameson neat.

The v'eggs benny-everything except their Hollandaise sauce no flavor what so ever. The mac n cheese baseballs was an epic disappointment. Just the thought of them makes me cringe. Unlike v'eggs benny they had a flavor, a very very bad flavor.

5222412,2018-05-11,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Let's start with the good: the menu. It is HUGE. HUUUUUGE. There are a ton of awesome items on it.
This place was extremely hyped up prior to opening, largely in thanks to the local vegans website, ""Vegans, Baby.""
Now, on to the ""meh"" / bad.
I stayed away for quite a few weeks because of the owner's behavior on social media. I saw multiple instances where she was being incredibly rude to potential customers, including arguing on her business page regarding the ""right"" way to create a menu item. It really disgusted me and made me not want to become a patron. However, I did come to try it out.
Starting with location: it's close to UNLV, which is great for vegan students, but in a very unsavory part of town. The windows are completely blacked out from the outside as well, which makes you wonder if they're even open. After parking and taking our valuables with us (haha) we went inside. The hostess was on her phone, which was a bit of a turnoff - I completely understand boredom at work, but at least fold silverware or something.
The interior itself is pretty nice and looks like it'd be cool for brunch/happy hour (if they had that; they're only open until 6pm at present).
They have bumping club/rap music which also confused me - if they were open late I'd get it, but during lunchtime it created an odd ambiance. 
The waitstaff seemed generally under-trained and very confused when taking orders. One of the food runners had to be asked four times for hot sauce; he continuously brought us ranch and ketchup until we gave up and waited for our waitress to return. I think the waitstaff has potential to be good, they just need A LOT more practice.
Two of us ordered a gyro, the other three ordered various salads. The portions here are HUGE and honestly could feed two people per entree. I would highly advise they size down their menu items and decrease price as it's just not realistic.
As far as the gyro, it was good, but not great. It was thick, fluffy bread as large as my face - which really made me wonder whether the owners had ever had a real gyro. The massive side of the bread made it really hard to enjoy the interior, which essentially fell everywhere and couldn't be contained by this half of a bread loaf.
The salads were all pretty good, no complaints there.
Payment also took some time as the waitress seemed confused as to how to use her portable POS machine.
Overall I'm glad I went, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. I hope that they will begin to offer carry out or Postmates/Uber Eats as I'd prefer that over eating in.",i6DkPAz95X3FtuUCLR_QHQ,0,0,2,58gVdnmRIsyIdz-N3FAKBg

5278133,2018-06-13,3,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"The Modern Vegan is one of the best things to happen to the Las Vegas vegan community recently. I was smitten with TMV after I first perused its expansive menu. In the ~5 times I've been here, I've barely even made a dent in checking off menu items off my list. Thus far, I've been happy with 95% of the food I've tried. 

CORN DOGS ($11): This appetizer is a meal in itself since it comes with 4 giant corn dogs. Greasy perfection. 5/5
MAC & CHEESE SIDE ($5): Better than most vegan mac & cheeses I've tried, but not sure if it's omni approved. 3.5/5
GYRO ($14): The sauce and gyro plant-meat are amazing! But the pita bread is awful thick. 4/5
LOUISIANA FRIED CHICKEN ($15): My absolute favorite thing to eat here. My husband's too. The mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy are to die for. 5/5
V'EGGS BENNY ($15): Not my cup of tea. Not bad, but not great either. Too saucy. 3/5
THE BUFFALO ($14): A buffalo chicken sandwich. Another winner. 5/5
OH MY GOD ($10): A chocolatey dessert. Good, but a small portion for the price. I wish the brownie was softer and warmer. The chocolate ice cream was awesome. 4/5
DRINKS: Expensive AF, so I stick to water. The downer here is that the glasses are teeny tiny and refills are usually hard to come by. 

As you can see, there's a plethora of options to choose from at TMV. This restaurant is my go-to for meals with friends.

I felt uncomfortable bringing my boyfriend and our friends here because the waitresses and hostess were all showing lots of skin (stomach, cleavage, etc.). The music was very loud and made the place feel more like a club or bar. Our order was initially not inputted into the system. Other tables recieved their food way before we did. Most of our food came was cold. The order was messed up and some things we ordered were not available (even-though it was on the menu). I would suggest a smaller menu. We showed up at 11:30, waited to be seated around 12:15pm. Our food arrived maybe around 1:30/2:00. We were there till 2:30. The food tasted decent; it would have been better if it was hot!

5317410,2018-03-24,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,Honestly very disappointed In this establishment. The food looks so good in the pictures. But the experience of going there was a totally different experience. Initially we walk in and get seated right away. But the table we were seated at was dirty. So I asked if they could clean it. The person came back set down silverware then returned to clean the table. Already a bad start. Next our server comes over and brings us water and informs us a large portion of the menu items were 86'd. She leaves us with a list of about 20 items that are not available. So the menu is limited now and have to ask if other items that have similar things on those are available. Some yes some no. The waitress returns 10 minutes later doesn't ask if we would like anything to drink. Then proceeds to ask if we're ready to order. We order and I ask to substitute something out. She says that's fine no problem. Puts the order in and proceeds to comeback about 5 minutes later and tell me for the substitution I'd have to pay an up-charge of 4 dollars. I would understand if it was 1-2 dollars as being a side. But 4 is too much for a substitution especially after being told it was no problem when I ordered. Lack of communication between front of the house and the kitchen. I say it's fine I no longer want the substitution just remove the side I didn't want. I then attempt to drink my water but notice my cup is dirty. Another dirty item in the same dining experience ruined it even more for me. I look for my waitress to inform her of the cup but she's off talking to a coworker and ignoring her tables. I have to call the hostess over and show her my dirty cup she states eww yeah I can see that it's dirty and gets me a replacement. Our food comes at different times with only two entrees ordered. Bad time management. Especially that the other person that dined with me ordered her entree atleast 5 minutes before me because I wasn't completely sure what I was gonna order as to not order the same thing. Also when I got my food I received the substituted item and was shocked because I told her I didn't want it because of the up charge. I brought it to her attention because I wasn't going to be charged for something I stated I no longer wanted before receiving my food. She stated no you won't be charged for the up-charge and that the kitchen messed up because she even told them don't put the substitution. The saving grace of the experience was the food though. The food was delicious and flavorful. And that honestly saved the experience from getting an even worse rating. But the lay issue we encountered was after eating our food and having our table cleared. Our waitress had disappeared yet again for another ten minutes. As we sat  there waiting for our check so we could pay and go. She eventually showed up asked if we wanted dessert but we stated we were full. So we got our bill paid and left. The all around experience was barely ok. And honestly if I were to eat here again I'd order to go as to not deal with the rest of the venue.,5vqq3gS1yxwBFo54mm6Scw,3,0,2,Ldz-RbPlMIPd8kdHCdmxTg

5421456,2018-03-27,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Here we go! We ventured in this past Saturday to give TMV a try. Some people might say the location is slightly questionable, don't let that stop you. The addition of a legit restaurant on this corner will hopefully add more positivity to the atmosphere. I myself am pleased they did not choose an ultra hipster or multi million dollar venue to debut there efforts. Good choice guys!
 The decor is crisp, clean,hard lines that I would describe as ultra modern. Everything from table and chair seating, picnic table, couches, to bar seating. Well lit with clean white being the overall color way. Appealing art and decor through out which also continues right into the two unisex restrooms. 
 Upon arrival we were greeted and seated promptly. Servers were friendly and attentive,a little scattered at times, but hey they'll have their rhythm and flow down soon I'm sure!!
 The menu is much larger than I had anticipated. I'd have to say probably the most expansive vegan restaurant menu in town and yes they offer signature cocktails and beers as well. Although tonight our server informed us of several items on the menu that would not be available, due to the chefs working out the kinks and getting in their groove I suppose. 
 Tonight we tried the breakfast burrito which is served supreme style with all the fixing you would expect in an all out supreme burrito. It is served with breakfast potatoes on the side. Good combo and very delicious. We also tried a burger called ""the BFF"". It is a Beyond Beef Patty decked out with Mac and cheese in the middle. Mmmmm, mmmmm, tasty as can be and accompanied with fries. I nearly forgot, we also had the trifecta avocado toast(see pictures)so delicious. I had a PBR my wife had a strawberry smoothie.

5426707,2018-04-11,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"I've been here a couple of times now and I am overall happy with the menu and service, but it feels like they are still working out some kinks of being a new restaurant. The hostess seems bored and the wait staff are a bit green (no pun intended) and therefore super attentive. Silverware and napkins aren't bundled, so I got my fork first, then my spoon with my coffee then a knife when my meal arrived. It's a first world problem, but if the wait staff and hostess were doing side work then they might hover less and look a lot less bored. There are also table top staples that are conspicuously absent, like salt and pepper or sugar packets. Again, I think it's because they're new, and it didn't inhibit my enjoying my meal terribly.

The preparation of menu items seems a little inconsistent. My first visit I noticed my waffles were missing some toppings, and on my second visit my husband's breakfast burrito was missing guacamole and rice and beans, but got a lot of lettuce and onion. Being that he's not even a vegetarian, I don't think I'll be able to get him to go back with me, he was pretty underwhelmed.

I however will be back, the breakfast items are pretty yummy and I want to try their smoothies and desserts.

There's a comfortable feel while also feeling trendy and hip.

We tried the corn dogs and queso for appetizers which were super delicious! The corn dogs were light and fluffy and the in-house-made ""mayo"" was a perfect compliment! The queso has just the tiny kick to it with corn chips on the side. My husband has the chicken and waffles which took some time since it was the most popular item in the joint but it was well worth it! The syrup wasn't overly sweet and the crispy ""chicken"" fit well with the fluffy waffle. I had the veggie Benedict which came home with me! The portion was very generous and filling! The mashed potatoes went really well with the spicy coconut ""hollandaise"" sauce and veggies. Our friends enjoyed their Reuben and the breakfast combo!

We ordered the Saucy Cauliflower Wings (which comes with fries),...delicious! 

My wife ordered the Louisiana Fried Chicken, which comes with mashed potatoes and a mushroom-sausage gravy,... I sampled some of her plate and almost wish I had ordered the same, so tasty!

I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak w/fries,.... equally as tasty! 

The price was $14-15 for each item we ordered, and WELL worth it as TMV gives you HEALTHY portions that don't disappoint and make it hard to finish your plate. I saw another patron who ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and I regret my stomach isn't big enough to eat all of that in one sitting so Spaghetti and Meatballs is on my list to order when I come back.

While it is nice to have an extensive menu, it doesn't help when the waiter essentially tells you before you fall in love with anything on the menu, ask me if we have it.  I have been here several times at different times of day (even right when they open) and this message is always the same.  

The things I have successfully ordered have come out cold, bland, or poorly executed (I.e. things that should be crispy come out soggy, cold condiments put on something that should be hot, etc.).  

While the woman running the kitchen has great ideas, I wonder if she has ever run a kitchen before.   They are missing key elements that a professional could help them clean up.

The menu is massive - heads up you'll take a good couple minutes trying to figure out what you want especially since everything sounded amazing! We decided to go for the chik'n & waffles, the vegan lobster roll, & a side of the baked mac n cheese. 

After the server took our order, we basically didn't see her until the end of our meal. We had to ask more than one server/busser that passed by our table when we needed something and it would take almost 10 minutes for them to even come back. 

The food was just okay, especially for the price. The only good thing about the chik'n & waffles was the waffles; the breading on the chicken was falling apart and everything was just too sweet. The vegan lobster roll was wayyy too sour and I had wish it was a little warm, I felt like I was just eating cole slaw and bread. The best thing we had was the Mac  n cheese & it was only a small side portion - definitely recommend getting the full-sized entree. 

Overall, our first time experience was okay. Not sure if we'll be back but definitely a good place to try out if you're vibing some vegan comfort food next to UNLV.",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,14,0,3,KEHBpCEGLM1Un6ubZ62wGg

The Modern Vegan popped up and when I looked at the menu I was sold! We went and I ordered the lobster roll with fries. All I can say is O-M-G!!!! It was so delicious. My husband ordered the bowl with the cereal(rolled oats) and peanut butter, cashews and I believe bananas. He loved it as well.

5631072,2018-04-17,5,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Outside of my main careers, 2 things I have worked with the most are food and customer service. Both need to be present at any restaurant worth anything, & both need to be good, or at least decent, for any restaurant to deserve paying customers. I won't go back to TMV, because the food was overpriced & mostly disappointing, and the customer service was for the most part shockingly nonexistent or bad, depending on the moment.
Everything on the menu is $3 to $5 more expensive than would be reasonable, & the portions and quality do NOT back up the inflated prices. Out of 4 entrees and 2 appetizers, only 2 items were really enjoyable...the ""jalapeno poppers"" & the ""meatball sub"". Couldn't find much flavour in the ""eggs benny"", the buffalo caesar wrap, the philly cheesesteak, or the ""mac n cheese balls"" (sauce was great but the balls had zero flavour).
I love vegan food. I have cooked it/served it/catered it/sought it out, and hoped for the best at many places, since I became vegan in 2001. This place is NOT where I would send someone looking to experience good vegan food for their first time. Even if the customer service wasn't some of the worst I've ever seen, I'd hesitate to go back & try more dishes here. The menu looks eclectic and amazing, but it's hard to justify a return visit, & such high prices, when only 2 out of 6 items purchased were satisfying.
Aside from needing to have DELICIOUS food, I believe every vegan restaurant needs EXCELLENT customer service, or at least enough to make every guest feel welcome & appreciated. It's an opportunity to be ambassadors to non-vegans, a chance to welcome people into (ideally) a pleasant, cruelty-free atmosphere, with (ideally) yummy, satisfying food. So about that customer service...
First, the phone number leads straight to an answering machine (during biz hours), so that's kind of special...
Having arrived, of the 6 staff members I interacted with out of necessity, 1 was awesome, 1 was pleasant and helpful, & 4 ranged from careless to shockingly rude. First the positive...Jordan, cleaning glasses behind the bar was classy, helpful, & kind, & he should really be training the rest of the staff on how to be friendly & professional. The gal at the window to the kitchen (possibly the owner, who seems to like making snarky responses on these reviews) was friendly, smiling, & promptly answered three questions I had regarding ingredients, even running to the back to check ingredients listed on packages. On the downside...the hostess promised faster service if we sat at the bar, telling me I didn't need to carry a menu with me, only to leave us at the bar with no menus. Once food started arriving, I politely asked a young food runner for utensils...twice, cuz the first time he half-heartedly called out to one of the girls working the bar & then disappeared, until I caught him walking by & asked again. Of the two ladies behind the bar, both of whom ignored my gf and I for a LONG time before taking our orders...the younger server flashed us a smile once or twice, but really seemed to have no time for us...and the older of the two, whom I initially flagged down to ask my simple ingredients questions, showered us with neglect & disrespect. She first told me I should ask her fellow bar server ""when she's done making things"", then after a LONG wait, told me I should go talk to the cooks, because apparently neither of the bar servers know much about the food, nor are capable of relaying questions to cooks or managers...so off I went to chat with the gal putting finished plates in a window. When I mentioned we were going to be ordering 2 additional entrees to go, our server said, ""You'll have to box it up yourself, cuz we don't do that"". I asked, ""What about when people just come & order food to go?""  ""We don't do that"", was again the answer. Do they have boxes & containers? Yes, yes they do. Will they hand one to the cooks, or designate an order as ""to go""? No, no they won't. In all my days of waiting tables, of boxing leftovers up for people, & neatly packaging carryout items, I never imagined I would find a restaurant with such ludicrous policies & excuses.
At one point, I discovered our check was on the counter just to my right. There had been no formal delivery of said check, no ""Anything else?"", no ""Thank you"", nothing at all. Upon glancing at the check, I noticed a charge for extra ranch, which we didn't order nor receive. I mentioned it to the ladies behind the bar, which resulted in the older server in the bandana grimacing, grabbing the bill from me, printing out an adjusted bill, & tossing it toward me on the counter with no apology. We paid the bill, & she tossed my credit card & receipt to sign, dropped on the counter with no eye contact, no gracious word, no thanks or farewells, just...nothing.
This wasn't just 1 person having a bad day. Most of the staff seemed bummed to be there. Lots of young, funky looks, but barely any smiles. No ""Vegas, baby!"" It was sad.",ykjBZU5EC9Km8BY-h2lddA,14,2,2,gJcTsNuEO6om-g6h8kxZ3A
5635417,2018-06-25,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,Just because you have a lot of menu items doesn't mean that quantity = quality. Had a pretty underwhelming meal at The Modern Vegan. I'm puzzled by the rave reviews of this place. The queso dip was served lukewarm and was so sweet. The Mac and Cheese lacked the cheesy zing that many vegan versions of this dish are known to have. Service is slow and chaotic.,NpFLCrRF5LGvb__Xy2KCeA,3,0,1,G7bOIcgUNF_ck0UIxE37PQ
5666263,2018-04-17,1,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"Firstly, let me start by apologizing for the length of the review. I want to put in every detail of my experience with this place.
Secondly, I want to say that I am glad to see more truly vegan restaurants are popping up and after reading some of the reviews for The Modern Vegan, I was pretty excited for my boyfriend and I to try it on our Vegas trip this past weekend. This review is not from someone who hasn't tried good and flavorful vegan food before, and therefore has no idea what actual flavor is like. I am no newbie to the vegan scene. I live in SoCal where we have plenty of vegan restaurants. Some bursting with flavor and some not so much. SO that being said, I have some things to say about this place.
  Yesterday (4/15/18), my boyfriend and I tried to call to ask if we needed to make a reservation after hearing that they are really busy. We called 3 times and the phone went straight to voicemail each time. Weird, but that wasn't about to deter us from going to what we thought was going to be our new spot to eat when we come to Vegas.  
We walk in and the hostess told us there would be a 10 minute wait which is really not bad at all but then she suggested that we could sit at the bar  where they serve the full menu and get faster service. We go to the bar and waited for a few minutes before we were able to get someone's attention to ask for menus. I should mention there were at least 3 people behind the bar and not one of them acknowledged us when we sat down or offered us menus. After perusing the menu, we have some of our options for food narrowed down and we wanted to ask a question regarding the ingredients to a dish to see if it had hydrogenated oil. By the way, research hydrogenated oil if you don't know what it is. It's essentially not food and like one molecule away from tupperware, but I digress.
  There was a lady with a bandana in her hair and she seemed nice enough as she asked us if we would like a drink. I ordered a drink and my bf asked if she knew the answer to our question. She didn't know but didn't offer to go to the back and ask the cook or offer for us to see an ingredient list. She told us to wait for this other girl behind the bar (has a partially shaved head) because she might know the answer. I believe she went and told shaved head girl that we had a question for her and she honestly never came over to talk to us. We got the attention of the bandana lady and she again acted like she couldn't do anything remotely resembling good customer service and after a while of us going back and forth with her and telling her we couldn't wait all day for someone to answer our question (seriously guys we were waiting a long time for shaved head girl to come over), she finally told us to walk up to a window where we could see the kitchen and ask the cooks ourselves. So my bf walked over to the window and talked to a woman who was cooking. She was very personable and was able to answer our question very well.
  After finding out that they do not, in fact, use hydrogenated oil, we were able to place our order. Again, we had to wait for a while for someone (remember there were multiple people behind the bar) to come and take our order. Shaved head girl finally came over and she seemed nice enough and we told her we wanted to order a couple things for there and then a couple things to go to eat later. We ordered Jalapeno Poppers and Mac and Cheese Balls to start. The Jalapeno Poppers were really good and the peppers had a great spice to them. The Mac and Cheese Balls, on the other hand, were really bland and lacking in flavor. We did love the dipping sauce that came with both of the appetizers. For entrees we ordered the Eggs Benny and the Meatball Sub. The Eggs Benny was pretty tasteless and boring but the Meatball Sub, though severely over priced especially because it wasn't that big, was actually pretty tasty and meatball subs are one of my favourite dishes when done right.  
  When our food was brought to us, it was brought without utensils and we had to ask the same guy twice before he brought them. During our meal, nobody checked in with us to see how we were doing or if we liked the food. Not one person looked our way the entire time. Finally, shaved head girl brought us our check and walked away. After informing the bandana lady that we had wanted to order more food to go, she told shaved head girl who said ""more food?!"" with a disgusted look on her face. Remember, we had already informed her we wanted more food for later. We get our food and we had to box it up ourselves because apparently they ""don't do that"". We got our bill ($92!! insanely overpriced)
and they had charged us for something we didn't order. After taking the item off, bandana lady tossed the receipt back to my bf along with major attitude. Needless to say it was the first time in our lives we didn't leave a tip for a server.  
This place was overpriced and overly hyped.  Don't waste your time or money.",HwbBRmczWhoyZQjyQkNDrg,10,2,1,2lmmK2hURHTtaLTsLrcTSw
5674821,2018-03-18,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"VERY DISAPPOINTING. Ordered chicken and waffles. Asked for water. Got a cup of water--no ice. I'd just assume ice would be in the water, but I guess the waitress took me literally.First chicken and waffle was cold. Second one was cold. My daughter ordered ramen-out of ramen. She then ordered fries and lobster sandwich. Fries were cold. I'm assuming the sandwich is served cold, because it was cold too. Asked for a second cup of coffee and creamer. Waitress brought creamer but no coffee. Waited. Had to ask again for coffee. The bill? The wife's husband told us he'd take the chicken and waffles off the bill. Too loud when he was talking and didn't hear what he was going to do with the final bill. Got the bill, gave the waitress my daughters credit card. When she came back, she was charged for the chicken and waffle. Waited until we got husbands attention, then explained we were overcharged. Waited again for waitress to bring corrected bill. Waited extra long for to go boxes. 
The whole experience was bad. The chicken and waffle looked so good. My mouth watered. One bite of cold mashed potato did nothing but kill my appetite x 2.
With the whole rotten experience, I'd think her husband would've offered more of a discount. I feel he needs more restaurant/customer experience because he has no idea how to speak to the customer.
We may give it a second try but it'll be in 6 months or so when they have things going good. If they're still open.

My potatoes were very dark like they had been left in the oil too long with a couple of golden ones in the mix. My glass had lipstick on it, which could happen anywhere I guess. We were warned by the waitress that it could take a while to get our food because it was made to order and the reason it came out at separate times is because it was made to order however I think most restaurants make their food when ordered.

I followed this restaurant on Instagram because of the infamous @Veganfatkid (follow him because his posts are great). Everything on their IG posts are mouthwatering and look amazing, especially the waffles!!! BUT, I had to remember that IG isn't reality therefore, in person I had a different experience than on-screen led me to believe. 

Ambiance:
Outside: shady and dark during the night...
Inside: The restaurant itself is ""TOO modern"" for me and I'm 21 years old... but this is a biased statement due to my preferences being more rustic-modern vegan restaurant. The ambiance in the restaurant is stressful; white walls that have me uneasy LOL, white tables, and black and white everything... Anxiety ridden ambiance lol. 

Service:
I probably was the most disappointed because I'm in vegas for vacation and being that it is 100+ degrees outside you would think that the water would be ice cold... lol no. And no prompt refills. lol. Also, no waffles that night (the most exciting thing on the IG page to me). I wanted to try the vegan chickn and waffles and the gia, but no waffles. SAD. But, with an overwhelmingly large menu and zero help from the server I opted for a regular burger. 

Food:
The burger was good, but beyond meat patties are bomb, so anywhere this would be great, BUT not anything spectacular for the price. SAD. Fries cold, o-rings (underwhelming oil taste and no seasoning). Warning, do not try the pad-thai, skip altogether. Lots of sauce, too sweet and too salty and oily and no noodles all in one bite LOL. 

Wanted to try dessert but the serving size was underwhelming for the price... SKIP.

My husband ordered coffee with agave. They brought the coffee and said they had no idea if the agave was added. Then came the $3.00 shot glass of coconut milk. I had soup and sent it back. Tasted like salt and more salt. My daughter ordered french toast and it took 30 mins. Was so behind they asked if we wanted it to go. Umm no she would like to eat it now. Disappointed and will not go back. The biscuits and gravy was good. Breakfast skillet was just ok. Heard a whole speech of how they are awaiting the tesla of waffle makers.

5934273,2018-05-26,0,dVp1llwjZUmhCF4pNsJnQg,"The Food Presentation: I saw pictures of the food on the website I ordered the ""What Happens in Vegas"", based on the lovely photo , I was expecting a healthy bushel of asparagus (~7 pieces), hearty chunks of tofu in the scramble, 1/2 a plate full of the potatoes seasoned with an abundance of basil, a hearty portion of the vegan bacon, and vegan sausage. When my plate arrived, my partner and I could not hold in our laughter.  See my picture. The plate had two scrawny, shriveled pieces of asparagus, a fried mess of crumbs posing as the tofu scramble, and potatoes covering 1/4 of the plate with just a dash of basil, and 2 extremely oily pieces of vegan bacon. The vegan sausage was the only thing on the plate that looked like the advertised picture.  The items were spread on the plate in a manner that screamed ""we ran out of food and are trying our best to make it appear as though we did not"". 
 
The Food Taste: Underwhelming.  The tofu scramble had a crumb consistency and lacked any distinguishable flavor.  It was hard to get over the crumb-like consistency.  You could not stab it with your fork like a real tofu scramble because it was too crumby.  The crumbs rolled off the fork.  The only way to get it into your mouth was to shovel it in quickly like a starving person.  Even then, some crumbs escaped to the floor.  The asparagus was bland.  The potatoes were okay but did not have anything that stood out about it.  The vegan bacon was just oily.  The only thing that was good was the vegan sausage.  My partner got the breakfast burrito, which was primarily ice-burg lettuce and onions.  The onions over-powered the dish.  A burrito from Chipotle customized to vegan would have tasted much better (and had more nutritious lettuce) for less than half the price. Also, the coffee was not the best (watery, gas station grade coffee). 
 
The Service:  We waited well over 1 hour for our food.  The waiter was quick to put in our order and bring us coffee, however, he did not check on us again until about 45 minutes later to tell us that our food was almost ready.  He also did not provide a coffee refill until that point.  I wasn't actually sure if our waiter was supposed to be our waiter.  I somehow thought he was the bartender who stepped in real quick because everyone else was busy.  Then we got ignored for a good 45 minutes.  It did give ample time to observe the staff and see the mini-dramas occurring amongst the employees.  Given, they were probably stressed that they were running out of food or something and had to spread the plates thin.  There seemed to be mini-meetings/scolding's between the gal that appeared to be the owner and the employees.  The atmosphere seemed extremely tense. Unprofessional. 
 
The Price: The ""What Happens in Vegas"" and breakfast burrito were each $15.  Compared that to VegeNation that offers a Tofu Scramble and Vegan Burrito for $11.95 each, I would call the Modern Vegan not much value for your buck.  Also, given the taste factor, remember you can get a Chipotle burrito that is customized Vegan for just $6.50.

The Ambiance:  Average. Looks like it was a 7-11 or night club converted into a restaurant (based on the location and tinted black windows). Some good ideas, but still had a run-of-the-mill Ikea feel to it. 

I was excited to try this place, but the overall food quality, taste, service, and price were lacking.  Especially since I tried VegeNation the day before (which was excellent) and had a direct comparison.",Stl7mbGJGs8u36v7F_JSrg,7,1,1,h3ojwuAWyfkYXFTDGVuhZw

One other thing...we ordered a burger after the 3 other things we wanted were gone, and waited 45 minutes for it, but by that time they were closing and instead of giving me the food that I wanted, they took it off the check without letting us know and sent us away.
