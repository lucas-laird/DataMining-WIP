 i don't understand the one star reviews... You paid like $20 a night for your room, what the heck did you expect? The bellagio? It amazes me how stuck up and yet so cheap some people are. Paying $20 for a hotel is equivalent to flipping your underwear inside out and wearing it another day. You're seriously offended by a stain on the carpet? Wow! Cheap @$$

Anyways, like I said. The tower room is nice. It was big, clean, the bed was comfortable. The flat screen TV was nice. The stand up shower was great... the shower head and temperature control was finicky but it was fine. Again, I didmt spend a million dollars to stay here. The view was OK, I could see the stratosphere, but that was about it. I got to check in at 11am, which was nice. The staff didn't seem to love their job, but were helpful nonetheless.

The showerhead was really low as was the water pressure. I paid $17 a day for amenities that included a ""heated"" pool, a T.V. that kept going out and wifi that never worked.

I inquired about charges for internet use. Two hotel employees lied to me when I asked them, saying it was included in the room rate.

* Download Speed: Up to 10 Mb/s
* Upload Speed: Up to 10 Mb/s

* IP Address Type: Private

We thought we were paying $45 a night and they charged an additional $17 resort fee PER NIGHT! This room was no better than a $30 motel 6 room which probably has a better view. Our view was a wall on the other side of an alley and it was the same alley as the recycling center. Imagine glass being poured into a metal container every few hours.

Restaurants: Why would we want to eat  at a scary looking Chinese food cafeteria or coco's with so many other great restaurants in Vegas.

EVERYONE has a smart phone ..I don't neeed your crappy internet.. Of course it was mandatory. THAT should have been known to me beforehand .  I would like to add that for people saying ""You get what you pay for""..  there are dozens of other cheap hotels in Vegas..Same price ! .. Circus Circus, Hooters, Riviera, and my favorite,  Gold Coast..These are MUCH nicer hotels and if you count Palace stations surprise mandatory $17 a night fee it IS the same price. 

The ""check in"" line  ..I waited for a good 35 minutes in this lovely line full of characters from all walks of ghetto. A black woman and her child, who both reeked of pot, a crack head, and some slimey guy who kept getting out of line to come over and harass me.. As their sad excuse of security watches and yet does nothing. Thanks rent -a -cop.. 

Finally I check in.. oh joy I am in some dingy motel that is located in a labyrinth ..First floor. fantastic..ooo  an exotic cockroach on my bathroom floor and the room stinks like a far away fantasy land of hookers and cigarettes. I try and get some sleep , but am awakened to the people next door having some angry monkey sex..their headboard slamming on the wall.. Then at 3 am I awaken to a tiny cry.. a baby kitten outside my window. So because I have a heart I go outside and grab little baby kitten ..Then I proceeded to walk through the casino with baby kitten in my arms . I don't know what I was trying to accomplish, I thought maybe one of the staff members had a heart and would take him/her home ..I have 2 rescue kittens and would have gladly taken him/her if I wasn't out of town.  The Security guard told me they have tons of kittens on property and they feed them..Oh, thats nice ! ugh..Call a NO-Kill shelter and have these poor kittens saved from whatever is roaming the streets of Vegas.. i'm sure hookers get hungry and baby kittens look mighty tasty. 

Luckily I am moving to Vegas next week and I'm starting a Trap and Release program for all these helpless kittens. It's not rocket science, if you get these kitties fixed it will solve the kitten crisis. 

Back to the hotel.. So the next night I asked to change rooms, because crying kitty was breaking me heart. The put me on the second floor. great, how do I get up there.. no elevator. ok, well I'm not lazy so I can walk around the labryinth for 10 minutes looking for the stairs where I can proceed to carry my luggage up the 2 flights of stairs.

323947,2013-11-05,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"I would highly recommend against staying at the Palace Station for a couple of reasons:

1) Inconveniently located in comparison to the strip.  I realize that it is a cheaper price than hotels on the strip and that they have a shuttle to the strip, however, the shuttle timing and pick up location is not always convenient.  So I still ended up paying for at least 2 taxis a day, the price of which could have put me into a hotel on the strip and would have been much more convenient

2) Their managerial customer service is horrible.  Vegas being Vegas, I ended up having to pack extremely quickly on the morning I checked out and left 2 shirts in the closet.  Housekeeping decided that the room was still occupied (based on 2 shirts in the closet) and they charged me for an extra night.  I called the hotel and ended up speaking to a manager who used all sorts of strange logic to explain why they had to charge me for an extra night.  He had no interest in discussing this unreasonable charge and was very rude and eventually hung up on me.

The end result of all of this was that the cost of me staying at a sub standard hotel off of the strip was more than what I would have paid to stay at a nicer hotel on the strip.",2IjyMuqi0GOlvgkZstGlNA,1,0,1,u-j6H5uL3BzBBNDeAgScLQ

I booked through Hotels.com where free WiFi was advertised, but it's NOT. Free Shuttle service was supposed to be free, it's NOT free. Rooms were dated. A faulty bathroom door handle trapped my wife in the bathroom for a while. The hairdryer was faulty. Paint was peeling off around windows. A fridge is available but you will have to pay $10 per night for the privilege. Spoke to the Hotel Manager Lana Le who appeared not to give a rip, telling me to call Hotels.com and complain, but I wouldn't be getting my room keycard unless I paid the extortion money ($16.99 per night). There are many other Hotels within the same distance of the 'Strip' that are much better value than this one ( for example Fortune Hotel and Suites), and they won't charge you extra for thing that are 'basic' in the Hotel industry today.
In conclusion there is much better value elsewhere in similar locations in Las Vegas, without the hassle and stress of worrying what they will charge you for next.",cCbOiXTOlFzliej9ywX3Eg,0,0,1,Z-Yt0VbVUWEiVi3r99ghUQ

Paid 90$ for a room that smelt like smoke and ass and didnt even have a microwave for my 6 month old sons bottles or a refrigerator for his medications. They wouldnt change our rooms or lend us a microwave or a coffee make for hot hot water! When we asked for hot water to be delivered for him it would be 6$ including hotel fee and delivery! Obviously nobody on staff has family. We would never recommend this place to anyone bot even my worst enemy. They even put us in the ""courtyard"" which is on the first floor with a glorious view of the gutter. They put us lower class away from the actual hotel with the advertised elevators.  I have never been more insulted. I guess they see a young interracial couple with a baby (both of us on active duty on leave by the way) and discriminate us. While we see elderly caucasian couples going to the top floors. I will be reporting this to the better business bureau for racial discrimination.",2XZNiZr2ZyS4-o69lU3hqA,1,1,1,lr3YZW2n5CtVXL_EvR7AMA

On travelocity they had rooms for $20 a night in the garden area.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  The garden area is ghetto its like staying in a cheap motel.  Even the ghetto downtown hookers dont walk around this area.  They dont even have an elevator to get to the second floor so be ready to carry your bags.

The house keeping wasnt good on that side of the hotel either.  I closed the bathroom door to take a shower there was a used towel on the hook.  When i was leaving in the morning i shook the sheets to see if i left anything on the bed and you can see all the dust flying around.

I'm surprised I'm not a single father now at how bad they screwed me over. How I'm not pregnant is shocking. Perhaps I'm a dude and thats medically not possible but thats how I felt. 

  Teresa Taylor was given that chance to resolve the matter at hand as she promised.  I wasn't going to write any review as I believe ""ISH HAPPENS' and people/places deserve a chance to resolve things in a satisfactory manner. Teresa Taylor, what the ""F"" happened behind the scenes from that day you stood in front of me so professional, so kind, so understanding, so giving. . . In the end you brought this upon yourself in how this was handled. I'm extra salty about this as hell and with all that time I had to waste in getting what was promised back to me.

Front desk was just steps away from where you pull up.  This is important for older couples.  Restaurants were great and all the hotel and casino staff were friendly and punctual. Rooms were clean, comfortable and inexpensive.  They surprisingly comp'd our room with a modest amount of gaming.  Shuttle service to the strip is available and only 1 mile to strip.  They covered the comforters in sheets.  This made me feel more sanitary.  Shower was free of any mildew and counter space in bath was huge.  Our tower room view was excellent from the 15th floor could see the strip.  Gaming table minimums were wonderfully low, $3-5.  Felt like we could have fun without losing too much.  Pool was a little inconvenient from the tower rooms.  You should stay in courtyard rooms if you want to be close to the pool.  I checked out access to the courtyard rooms because of a bad comment.  They were easily accessed through the casino.  You did not have to go through an alley to get to the courtyard rooms.  You could go thru an outdoor crossover if you elected to, but it was a clean secure crossover.  Really enjoyed this place.

The casino is alright. Didn't seem like very many table games, but mins were $5 most of the time which is a nice thing if you don't want to gamble too much. The casino does seem older so it does have that old cigarette smell to it, but it isn't too bad. Lots of cheap slots, and the casino staff tries to sign you up for a players card. You earn a lot of points fast as they give you 3 points for every $1 you gamble, but no idea how many points you need before anything useful happens. 

The rooms are nothing special. I think I have slept on more comfortable floors than the beds. The mattress is just like a board almost, and the pillow is like trying to sleep on a rock. It was so uncomfortable that I was only able to get 2 hours of on and off sleep

Overall, it might be a nice place to gamble if you are looking for something cheap and off strip, but i would honestly rather be at IP or something on the strip

We were just going to order to go at the Oyster Bar.  We were waiting in line and a rude casino representative came up to us and said we either both had to step out of line or one of us has to walk around with both kids.  That kids aren't allowed at the oyster bar.  I told her we were only going to order to go, she said nope sorry, you have to keep moving, that's the rule.  It's the way she said it too, she enjoyed implementing a rule on us.  

This is a stupid rule, but even if it was a rule, this is one you could just look the other way.  We have two kids, each of one is holding one, we are only ordering to go.  I was so upset.  My wife wanted to go, but I knew she really wanted it.  So I decided to take both kids back to the car and get the stroller, and stroll them around.  The lil one ends up doing number two that overflowed.  It was a nightmare changing diapers and handling both at the same time.  I will not be back.  With a lil research, I found out there is another same exact restaurant inside South Point, and many other similar type of pan roast around the same area.  We have kids now, I wont be back to a place that is so NOT Kid Friendly.

There is better ways to handle the situation.  One, look the other way, not a big deal at all.  Two, Ask to take our order and come back in 45 minutes.  Or come back in 45 minutes to place order.  You could be more accommodating, no so mean and rude.   The casino representative was an older black lady working at the rewards center at 5PM on Tuesday, April 22nd.  Nothing against black people, just describing so the management could figure out who was working at that time.

The Courtyard rooms are grossness.  Tower rooms are nice.  The employees are fantastic.  (I always wonder if people that complain about the employees without a specific customer service issue are just rude.)

I started off bad right from the get go.
Free shuttle from the airport!
I call to find out where to pick up the shuttle, they give some directions and tell me that the next shuttle would be an hour and a half later - really not acceptable at all!
I get to the pickup only it is for the public bus, the hotel bus pick up is in another location.
Call the hotel again and the insist that they gave me the correct directions, which they tell me they are reading off the computer as they really personally don't know.
At that point I give up and just take a paid shuttle!
Get to the room on the 20th floor, old scratched up furniture, no coffee maker (as I find out later they don't have them in the entire hotel!) and the safe is not working!
Call to have the safe fixed, they come out, can't fix it, take it out and later tell me that they don't have a replacement safe!
Before going to bed I start to smell smoke - they neglected to tell me that floors 20 and 21 are smoking optional floors!
I call for a new room which they don't have for the night.
Next day I finally get a new room at 3pm.
Check it out and it also has the safe removed, not acceptable to me.
Get another room only this one has the safe locked!
So I tell them to fix the safe by the time I get back.
4 hours later - problem has not been corrected!
Call the manager and he tells me that I need to be present to have the safe fixed - not sure why I wasn't informed of that 4 hours ago???
Nobody shows up to fix the problem. Call the manager again and he assures me that somebody will come to fix the safe!  Nobody shows up - call the manager again and ask for his boss who of course is not available!
I finally go back to reception but they keep telling me that I need to be present for them to fix the problem - not sure where they get the idea that their problem has now somehow become my problem!  I finally ask them to deliver me a room that did not have a problem which of course they could not do!
Back in my old room I get a call that they have a room now - I tell them that I am going out and will take it when I get back - their customer unfriendly reply was that they would only hold it for 2 hours!  Somebody obviously forgot to tell them that the customer was not there for their convenience?

This hotel is OFF the strip and you can't get anywhere without motorized transportation - thier shuttle system runs very inadequately.  Not sure why anybody would stay here and be stuck out in nowhere!  Cost you might think ought to be cheap?  Not so!  It was cheaper for me to stay at Bally's in the center of the strip!

I would never recommend this place to anybody!
Management not only doesn't care about customer service, they seem to also be incapable fix problems.  Why would anybody put themselves through this pain when there are so many better and cheaper options available!

On a final note, the rooms that I did see on lower floors all had newer furniture - somehow they left the old stuff on ths smoking floors!",3GjD4WSE0jKkcPel9N9uLw,0,0,1,2aeVKhmjlt3NS7WLbi_4eQ

Wrong because when we got there and checked in it was an additional $16 a night for airport shuttle (Even though I DROVE from San Diego,CA), Internet access (I don't own a lab top), Gym (don't have time). they didn't care they charged me for these things anyway. 


 Now if that's not bad I drove all the way around to these so called courtyard rooms, on the other side of where I checked in... OH MY LORD you have got to be kidding me! Is the first thing out of my mouth when I opened the room door. Then I quickly covered my mouth so the stanch of the room wouldn't get in there. It smelled as though someone had just gone to the bathroom and it was really strong. we where late to my daughters first check-in so we dropped our stuff and prayed that the smell was gone by the time we got back.

Wrong the smell was still there, but it was two in the morning And my kid was exhausted so we decided to turn on the air and get some sleep I will take care of it in the morning.... NOPE!!! we pulled back the covers and there was a black Vans crusty sock in the bed... GROSS. we left found wal-mart and bought an air mattress at three in the morning, after blowing up the mattress my daughter rolled over and found a twix wrapper under the bed and a digital camera. Okay I was to out done and to tired from our drive and day I tried to get some sleep. 

 The next day I found the house keeping manager she came with her rubber glove and collected the sock and I stayed and watched her and two other housekeepers clean my room. And the desk manger took off  the resort fees and comped me for one night. it still doesn't take away from the fact that it was still dirty like that. another family member that was also traveling with us found a beer can in her room.

The facility is dated and tired.  Interior and exterior walls and accesses are very dirty, stained, damaged and unattended. Windows are marred, greasy and unwashed. Many light bulbs appear to be burned out and in need of replacements.  In short, the facility and its grounds are grungy and unkempt. 
The customer service staff, however, were quite pleasant and sincerely willing to help.  Service staff have little to no control over the facility issues so cannot be held accountable for those disappointments.  
Please note that this facility is not on The Strip.  Should one's activities require Strip access, one may require vehicle transportation considerations over and above the courtesy shuttle offered by Palace Station.  
Review the Palace Station shuttle opportunities.  Their scheduled shuttle times and destination stops may not be convenient - especially for airport service.  Do not expect that their shuttle to service both terminals at the airport.

Beds were comfortable, however, the pillows were a little flat, but not horrible.  Both the shower-head and sink faucet had weak water pressure.  The shower-head seemed to have been on the massage setting and wasn't adjustable.  The sink faucet was also more of a sprinkle than it was a stream of water flow.  Free WiFi was definitely a plus but a littel weak and would drop from time to time, but nothing unbearable.

The $7 buffet was definitely a bargain and very convenient for a ""quick bite"" option.  Food quality was good and the restaurant was also pretty clean.  The pool wasn't too much of a highlight.  There are 2 pools - both located at, what I'm guessing, is the older part of the hotel.  The pool areas were both pretty decent and appeared to be well maintained.

We arrived around 10am and were happy to be able to check into our room early, around 12.  That was very much appreciated.  The bell desk was helpful in getting us shuttle schedules and storing our luggage until we could check in.  They were friendly and welcoming.  I was very happy with the bell desk service our entire stay. 

We had no issues Thursday or Friday.  However, after returning to the hotel around 1am Friday night/Saturday morning, we were rudely awoken by banging noises at 7am on Saturday morning.  We attempted to continue sleeping, having no idea what the noise was.  Around 8am, we heard talking and applause from the room next door, and then someone began talking into a microphone.  I could hear every word she said as if she was in our room, and I had earplugs in.  We peeked into the hall and saw there was a SEMINAR going on in the hotel room next to us.  I imagine the repeated banging noise was the door frame slamming against the hook or deadbolt that was placed so that the door would not lock as people came in.

By that point, we were already very much awake.  We had planned on having breakfast at Palace Station and doing a little gambling before going out for the day.  After our rude awakening, we decided to have breakfast and do our gambling elsewhere.  I waited to complain, as I was pretty angry and wanted to be able to do so in a composed manner.

When we returned to the hotel, I made my complaint with the front desk.  I was told that there was nothing that could be done, and I should have called that morning.  I was not apologized to even once.  I understand that I could have called that morning and had them send someone up, but by the time we even realized what was going on to even be able to complain, we were already wide awake.  Furthermore, I feel very strongly that we should not have had to call, because it is ridiculous to rent out a hotel room to a corporation to use for a seminar.  And the room had a sign out in front of it on Palace Station letterhead with the seminar schedule, so I'd imagine that the management was well aware of what the room would be used for.  In fact, the front desk person was able to tell me that another seminar was scheduled for the next morning as well, in that same room. 

There is absolutely no reason that a paying customer should have to be disturbed by a business function occurring in an adjoining room.  Business functions should occur in business facilities: conference rooms and banquet areas that are separate from customer rooms.

In addition, I was incredibly displeased at the service I received in the Grand Cafe.  We went there before leaving the next morning, and after asking for a couple minutes to decide on my order, did not see our server again for over 15 minutes, when I found someone else to go find her.  We were on a schedule, due to having to get to the airport, and though I had had plenty of time when we got there, I ended up having to take my food to go due to the length of time that passed before our server came back to take our order.  When the server returned, we did not even get so much as an apology for her disappearing act.  That is poor customer service.",HFv_2YrSqc0EoPZzumeFiw,5,1,1,lAVFgxLlcJAHtQLjiYDdsA

This was, bar none, one of the absolute worst dumps I have had the pleasure of staying at, anywhere in Las Vegas.  I was coming from Harrah's, and was very disgusted when I saw this place.

The ""Courtyard"" rooms are nothing more than a modified ""Motel 6"" or ""Super 8"" type buildings.  This is a very old structure, which is musty, and is many years old.  It is a two-story building with no elevator; only stairs, so be warned if you have lots of bags.  It was like they took an old Motel, and moved it in back of the Palace Station tower.  It just did not belong there.

Upon arrival, both rooms that I had reserved did not have functioning Internet access.  One of the rooms had a very strong ""medicine"" type odor.  The second room smelled very musty, and like it was a former smokers room.  I had requested non-smoking.  The carpet was worn, and also had several stains on it.

The front desk was told to change both rooms, at my request as they were unacceptable to stay in.   The replacement rooms had working Internet, but were definitely not to the expectations you would find elsewhere in Las Vegas.

Even though my reservation was for two nights, the rooms keys for both my rooms were shut off the following day.  My guest and I were locked out of our rooms.  Upon calling the front desk about this problem, their solution was to dispatch their Security guards to make sure we were supposed to be there.  The Palace Station security guards gave us the third degree, and told us we needed to make the long walk back to the front desk to resolve the key problem even though we were not fully ready, or had taken a shower yet.

Between the structure, casino/hotel clientele, and condition of this place, I should have known better.   Palace Station is definitely the kind of hotel you would put into the ""budget"" or ""low budget"" category.  I have stayed at many Motel 6 and Super 8 type places, and this one is about par, or sub-par with those types of places.",Zn0TJE5iIAprgPhMdKyDbQ,8,0,1,3uXNKmR5c5seVhBYiIhQcQ

The floor was dirty, the bathroom was filthy and the bedding was not fully made. Only a fitted sheet and flat sheet was on the beds. The beds were hard like cardboard and loud anytime you moved. There were also dead roaches in the room when we opened the curtains to look out a filthy window. The food in the restaurants was decent and decently priced however the service was extremely slow.

913750,2014-02-02,1,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"The Palace Station is essentially two hotels in one, and whether you like it or hate it largely depends on which of the two you pick.  This place has a Courtyard section, which is more like a motel, and the Tower section, which is decent.  I stayed at this hotel for three nights, the first in the Courtyard and the last two in a Tower room.  

The Courtyard area is disgusting.  In order to get to this part of the hotel, you have to walk out of the casino and into a separate building.  I felt like I was being punished for opting to be frugal and getting the cheaper room.  They claim that the entire Courtyard section is smoke-free, but don't kid yourself.  You'll be smelling cigarette smoke for the entire time you're there.  When I walked into the room, it felt like I was walking into an ashtray.  All the furniture and linens smell like cigarette smoke.  The room itself is very small.  The beds take up most of the space, and there isn't much room to walk around.  I didn't sleep very well in my one night in this room because the smell of cigarettes in the linens was nauseating.  Also, the walls are thin and don't block the sound of people talking in the hallway, or of the people in the adjacent rooms.  

The next morning, I went back to the check-in area and complained about the room.  They told me that they'd move me to a Tower room, but I'd have to pay $25 extra per night.  I asked to speak with the manager, who told me it's not their fault that people choose to smoke in an area that's designated as smoke free.  In her words, it's not the management's fault if the guests are ""being rude"" by smoking.  After an argument that lasted almost 10 minutes, during which I threatened to leave and then file a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back for the room, the manager finally gave in and switched me to a Tower room at no additional cost.

The Tower room was very decent.  There was no cigarette odor, the linens on the beds were very clean, and so was the bathroom.  The room was considerably larger than the one in the Courtyard, and had far more room to walk around.  This was a very decent, prototypical hotel room.  The WiFi in the room was also very good.

The casino itself is fairly standard.  They have slot machines and all the basic table games.  There are a number of nice places to eat.  It's certainly not a flashy casino, and it doesn't come close to rivaling those in hotels on The Strip, but it's pretty standard compared to other casinos that are off the strip.  This hotel advertises very heavily to locals, because  locals might enjoy being in a casino that doesn't feel touristy.  To that end, this place will serve them well.

I admit, I chose to stay at this hotel because of its connection to OJ Simpson.  This is the place where OJ came to get his property back from people who had stolen it from him, and now he's serving a lengthy prison term for what went down.  All of that happened in room 1203 in the Courtyard.  I definitely walked by that room just to check it out.

If you're coming to Vegas on a once in a lifetime vacation, don't stay here.  Pay the extra money and stay at a hotel on Las Vegas Blvd.  If you do end up staying here, definitely opt for the Tower rooms.  The Courtyard rooms aren't worth the discounted price.  Personally, I don't think I'll be coming back here again.  I didn't like it.",n6n3RnhXjdFKxVntanRGWw,4,0,2,iMMpmIhBpEFLa5RPQNXjqQ

The room did the job. i had a comfy bed with clean sheets and fluffy pillows and a spacious room. The complaints i have was that it is an older hotel so the rooms aren't updated but like i said it was good enough. But when i was ready to take a shower i noticed at the top of the curtain bar there were three washcloths that were hanging up there that the housekeepers must've not seen or they didn't did a full check when cleaning the room from the last occupant. Which i have to admit, grossed me out and definitely had me thinking about the cleanliness of the rest of the room. Check out was easy and when i confirmed about the complimentary shuttle to the airport they told me the exact time to be there which i gladly complied. I was even 10 minutes early to beat since i didn't want to feel rushed. And so I waited... and waited... and waited... after 20 minutes of waiting after the expected arrival time, I contacted customer service and asked them about the shuttle. They kept telling em it was on its way and that it always on time. I did have to point out that i was still waiting and was even early. Well after another call to the front desk and them telling me that sometimes its early and that it's recommended to get to the pick up site 15-20min earlier, they told me that next pick up was literally in another 1 hour.

We stayed at this off-strip hotel while visiting Vegas because we needed to stay at the same place as certain folks who are very dear to me. Thanks to online review sites, we avoided the courtyard rooms and stayed in the tower, which made a world of difference. Make sure you do the same. 

They charged a mandatory hotel/resort fee of $16.99 per day which included the internet access fee of $5.99 per day. Many of the Vegas hotels charge this hotel/resort fee and the front desk was up front about it when we checked in, so I had no problem with it. With our room booked during a 48-hour sale online, we got our money worth: room clean, bed comfortable, shower nice and AC working fine (essential for 115 degree Vegas summer). 

We had breakfast at the Grand Cafe once during our stay and it was pretty decent (had corned beef hash, scrambled egg and fruit cup). Coffee was so-so. 

There are some glowing reviews of the Oyster Bar but we didn't get to try that place.

1027967,2011-11-23,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"Their are many a bad review on this thing. It makes you wonder which are accurate and which are just individuals who had a bad experience. Well, I'll give the break down of this place.

Pros
- This place is cheap. We paid $24 for one room with two beds for one night. The only fault with the room was that it smelled like hairspray. It was in the courtyard and was a bit motel-like but it was a nice motel like.  It was very clean. Walking from the main building to the outside building was very odd though. The sheets and spread were which. The walls were a warm brownish color. At least it wasn't like the tacky floral print motel sheets.  The bed wasn't the most comfortable but it was nice. It was just a bed. Nothing special.  Not especially soft but not sleeping on brick either.


- The buffet in the hotel was good. Now, buffets are almost always terrible. This one didn't have the widest variety of food of all the buffets, but their food was fully cooked, properly heated and very worth the price. Two people cost $17 for the buffet.  The interior of the buffet was nice. There are much nicer buffets in Las Vegas though.

- The casino is pretty big. It's probably not the nicest casino in Vegas but it was ok. Very normal. 

- Shuttles are free. 

- The service was good. Everyone we encountered was polite.


Cons
- It isn't on the strip. However it isn't far from the strip. I think its only 2.5 miles or so away from the strip. 

- The shuttle schedule on its web site is incorrect. 

-The shuttles don't run often enough

-The breakfast at the bakery was over priced and not worth it. It was a 24 hour bakery though.  The chicken sandwich is especially terrible and their specialty pancakes overdose on their ingredients, i.e. the chocolate pancakes had too much chocolate in them. 

- They took 100$ deposit extra from us at check in. We paid a $2 deposit online to make the reservation. Our bill was $22.00. So, in total we paid $124 and are now being returned the $100 dollars. It isn't unusual for some hotels or rent-a-car places to require an immediate deposit but I feel like it's something companies should put on their and affiliated websites because not all hotels do it. It may be normal for Vegas hotels but it was my first time in Vegas so, they should make it well known. What if someone was trying to take a 250$ budget one day vacation in Vegas just to get away from life, thinking they could get a $24 room and spend the rest on fun not knowing they had to pay $100 down at check in. In any case we paid it and moved on. 

- The websites DO NOT provide all the information about this place. It's difficult to find pictures of the rooms and other information. If you intend to stay here, call first and ask questions as oppose to looking online alone.

Ultimately the pros and the cons balance out. So it's very VERY much a 3 star place simply because this is Vegas. Their are many hotels and so it's competitive. This place isn't bad. I enjoyed my vacation but I wouldn't come back here because there are much better hotels in Vegas which aren't that much more expensive. Also, it's better to stay on the strip.  I thought they would have a good shuttle back and forth but after experiencing them I'd rather be in walking distance.",aeCyTRbXdrqGPPCduVLGVA,0,0,3,iCskKaDt2Di7N7U0S9wI7w

If you stay here to save money you're very likely to give it all back to taxis, so you're better off on the Strip. If you have a car this is an excellent choice.  Oyster Bar really is good and priced appropriately.  Expect $60 with a drink for 2.  Counter only, maybe 20 seats.  You can usually estimate 20 minutes to wait per person in line in front of you.

Ive been going to palace for 15 years. One particular night, i had a few drinks and was fairly intoxicated. I went to the poker room and sat down and played a lil too aggresive on one hand and was kicked out. I wasnt happy about it, but i do understand. The next day i called and talk to the poker room manager Bill(?) And apologized. I explained that i had a terrible day and had too much to drink. He said that was fine. For the next 2 weeks i stayed away from the poker room and instead played lots of bingo and slots. I went from the lowest club card to the highest in those 2 weeks, so i did play alot..lol. i also hit $10,000 at bingo one night. Btw, the bingo attendants and cocktail/bartenders on swing shift are amazing. Theyve always treated us like family. After 2 weeks, i met my friend in the poker room, and Bill said i couldnt play, he said i was 86d. I went over to the security podium and asked if my name was on the 86 list. He checked and said no. I went back to the poker room and at that time Brian had called the security supv (mike? john? Bill?) And his words to me were ""Get Out"". I was apalled at his unprofessionalism. My friend that i was meeting at poker is a cop and got up to try and talk to the supervisor,  but he had nothing to say to her. I have called the head of security numerous times to find out exactly what and why, but he has not returned my call.   After a cpl weeks of waiting for his call back,  i called the GM of the casino. Is it so bad to just want answers? The GM never called back either. It is what it is.

I booked two different rooms for my me and some friends so I was able to check out two types of rooms: King bed only and the two twin bed rooms. The King bed room was really spacious and quite clean. Never encountered anything that would gross me out or make think this is some run down hotel. The Double twin bed room however was a little smaller than the king. Also the shower head in that one was pretty low compared to the one in the King Room. 

I think the palace station hotel is great for anyone on a budget or for those looking for a place to crash for a few hours at night. If you're looking for a nice hotel with all the bells and whistles, or if you're uptight about budget hotels then go ahead and pay at least triple for a hotel on the strip.

We checked in after a long drive back from Zion National Park. Upon entering the hotel from the parking garage, we had to go through a rather large section of smoke-filled casino. This did not make me happy. But when we arrived at the desk, the woman behind the counter couldn't have been nicer. They were sold out of the king room we had booked, so she ""upgraded"" us to two queens with ""a view.""

We had specified a non-smoking room.... and after re-reading these reviews, I wonder if we would have been ill-fated for those dreaded ""courtyard"" rooms had it not been for an over-sell? Who knows...

In any case, we were in the south tower.... our view was of the Strip. Once in the south tower, going in and out of the hotel without encountering the smoke-filled casino is easy. 

The room was clean... and not a hint of smoke in the hallways. 

If you want to spend a night Downtown -- you couldn't ask for a better location. You're right at the foot of Freemont Street. We rented a car -- and driving to the Strip took us less than five minutes. 

Like most people, we have a budget we like to stick to when we go on vacation -- and on this vacation, we wanted to spend our cash on fine dining and fun experiences.

Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. First, the courtyard is located directly adjacent to the main building. You literally walk outside the main building, take 10 steps, and you're in the Courtyard. The other end of the Courtyard is connected directly to the Casino so you don't have to go outside at all. Parking is a breeze. I suggest if you're staying in the Courtyard, check in and then drive around where you can park pretty much in front of your room. It's really convenient. There are no elevators so if you like ground floor rooms ( or don't like elevators) this a a perfect place for you.The room was nice and clean. It wasn't dated at all, had nice tile work, full length mirror, dryer, iron & ironing board. There is no bathtub, just a large step in shower. The view in our room was of a wall so that was disappointing but if you can get a view of one of the pools it would be nice. There are 2 separate pools. We only used one and it was heated to a perfect temperature. They both have plenty of seating and towels. Security doesn't bother you. We took our ice chest with beer and our portable speaker for music and had a great time. There's a food and drink menu with a phone so you can call room service and have it delivered to you at the pool. You can pay cash or charge it to your room. Really convenient but a little more expensive than going inside and ordering the same thing. The machines were pretty loose, tables were so-so. We had pizza, wings, and meatballs at Tony's which were all really good. Our waiter Gonzo was great. Happy hour margaritas were $5 at the Cabo Cantina. Live music on Friday night at the Irish pub was good and so was the food which surprised me. There is s Starbucks and a 24 hour Subway. My friend raved about the buffet but I didn't try it personally. We ate breakfast at the cafe. No wait even though is was Saturday morning. Skip the biscuits and gravy- it wasn't homemade. 
Overall, this is a great hotel/casino. It has more of a vintage Vegas feel, but is not out-dated or old. Every staff member I encountered was nice, except for one semi-rude bartender (can't win em all lol)  There is an hourly shuttle to the Fashion Show mall on the strip. We didn't use it but it was available. A taxi to Fremont St was about $17 plus tip. There is a CVS pharmacy right down street if you need it.",4B5bPD1-3hbr8ttJa3JOTA,0,0,4,xLMjsFMyA0SKAC-AY2Gcww

The hotel is very close to the strip and hardly any traffic ever.  The check in clerk gave us a 12th floor room overlooking the mountains and the Stratosphere Hotel.  It was stunning!  The room could have been cleaned better, pieces of hair on the bathroom countertop, two half empty bottles of soda behind the bed but overall clean.  The air conditioner worked great and you definitely need it if you're visiting in August.  One day it hit 110 degrees.  

First thing we did when we got there was drop off our bags and headed for the buffet.  It was delicious!  Good variety of choices and wait staff is very attentive.  There's always a line though, sometimes it moved quickly and other times you just stood there.  We did meet a local couple standing in line and they gave a two for one coupon.  So standing in line can result in good things.  Palace station is their casino and buffet.  There was definitely a lot of locals there,  reassuring us their love for Palace Station.

The casino was small but big enough for us.  Smokey in different areas but what do you expect?  It is Vegas and you can basically smoke and drink anywhere.  But don't challenge the police, they're not afraid to arrest.  In the casino there's a small oyster bar.  The Oyster Bar.  We ate there our last night, it was so very yummy!  It was fun sitting at the bar and watching the chef cook.  The food was just great!!!  We shared the Combo Pan Roast and a bowl of New England Clam Chowder.  Both dishes were great and came in large servings.  Sharing was a great idea and now we thought about ordering more.  

The pool was small but not crowded and felt great at night.  There's also a hot tub, just the right tempature in the evening.  Drinks can be ordered through the house phone but only during the day.

Overall the experience with Palace Station was great.  We enjoyed meeting the locals, the small casino and friendly staff.  But if you want more of the crazy Vegas stay on the strip.  Some of the hotels were so big we got lost walking around.  We love seeing the strip at night but enjoyed the calmness at The Palace.",h7AM6_v5ISWdZATG9fLlIg,1,0,4,tX_H9OC03TIiuUa0tEzx1Q

We had originally booked a king room but for 20 dollars more they let us upgrade to a jr suite. I can only review this room as I have never stayed in the others. 

Room- PROS- the room was in the corner at the end of the hall so the stairs were one neighbor and the other was a little down. The room was quiet, clean, and smelled very nice. There was a sofa and two smaller chairs and the king bed. There was a large window in the corner and it had a beautiful view of the strip. There was a large bathroom with a shower, a full length mirror. The wifi was free. 
CONS- the towels were small, no tub, no USB ports and the bed was very firm and not very comfortable. 

The casino- pros- smoke smell isn't too bad, they have poker and a variety of other table games. 
Cons- the games were mostly older and it's not very big. 
 
The casino has a cheap buffet that is 6.99 for breakfast and 8.99 for dinner. There is also a diner that is very reasonable with good food. They have a pastry bar with very cheap prices for good pastries. The little store is priced more like a convenience store than a casino store.

The buffalo wings and the burgers in the pub are great. I had a couple of good meals in the cafe and the buffet is good it is a basic buffet but great for breakfast or late lunch. I have had very quick check in. The staff was very friendly and offer quite a bit of information to me about the area as I am looking to buy a house in Vegas . I have used their shuttle it left at 6 am to get me to the airport and I have used the shuttle to take me to the strip to spend my evening after a hard day of looking at houses.

Then, when they said they reversed the charges, they didn't give my Mom a receipt to show proof that they did in fact reverse charges. So when she asked for paperwork to prove that they gave us credit back, the supervisor/manager present pretty much said, ""Paperwork? What paperwork?!"" Ruuuuude. But finally, they were able to give us some paperwork on it. And gave us a time period of about three days of when we would receive the money back!

However, the furniture looked nice, and the bathroom decorations were also nice looking, so they at least tried to make it look better. It also smelled pretty nice - like vanilla and berries - compared to the first floor - cigarette smoke and broken dreams.
When you go to sleep, there will be trucks outside making noises, but it isn't too bad. They stop at around 1:00 AM and they came back at around 10:00 AM.
I foolishly read reviews of this hotel after booking it, and noticed there were quite a few reports of bed bugs. This was concerning news. I inspected the bed and the room, and I haven't noticed any bugs or bites, but I'm not an expert. Just be aware that there have been reports of them.

I was skeptical from reading all reviews here on Yelp to even sleep in a room at Palace Station, but I did anyways.  From the moment that we checked in to the hotel the service was horrible, it took almost 45 minutes to check in. Then when they told us our rooms would be through the doors in the back I was kind of confused. As we walked to the back through the doors it appear to look like a rundown apartment building. My husband and I were so shocked we continued to our room and as we opened our door it looked like a cheap motel. The bathroom had a fan that made  loud noises. Our toilet flooded due to plumbing issues .  I message my family member and asked them if they had problems when they visited  they did say there was plumbing issues as well but wondered why we were placed in the back because they had stayed there recently and they said the room was nice and updated. They paid the same amount for my room as they did for their room when they had visited. As my husband and I walked out we noticed beams that were holding up the walls across to the casino.

As far as the rooms go, they were OK. The hallways are confusing, and you actually have to walk outside and back inside to another portion to get to the rooms. The staff was also not all that friendly, and couldn't find one of the 2 reservations we made. Instead we were told to just pay the regular rate for the night and provide proof we even made a reservation if we had it. I got the receipt and they were finally able to find the problem at check out time, but it still was a hassle for me.

because of the low cost, this hotel attracts a particular crowd.  think white trash college dorm, and you have it about right.  we were by the vending machines and we had people outside our room all night.  my favorite was the guy sitting outside our room smoking pot and eating funyons all night.  or there was the guy on his cellphone in the hallway who was 8k in the hole to the mirage and begging people for credit.

the rooms themselves are fine, although the shower is poorly designed and i found it impossible not to flood the entire bathroom, but it is possible i am shower deficient.  just don't expect to be able to have a romantic rendez-vous in there, cause it ain't happening.

it took over an hour to check in. We reserved a king bed. The room was back behind the main hotel. It looks like a trashy apartment. Our room was on second floor and they have no elevator. So this means you have to carry all ypur luggage up a flight of stairs. I have a bad back so we had to go all the way back to lobby wait in line again to get a first floor room. We get in that room and it was 2 beds small and grungy. 2nd trip back to lobby . To get a room in the main hotel was an additional $250. Crazy!! But we paid it to feel at least clean. 
From there on it just gets worse. The guy at front desk tells us that the shuttle would be coming at 930. We waited 45 mins for another guy to tell us that they didnt have anymore shuttles running that night. We almost missed countdown at midnight on the strip. 
When we arrived back to the room on the 8th floor our keys would not work. That means back to the lobby. Did I forget to mention the elevators are ridiculously slow.  10 minute wait at least everytime. So we take the new keys up and again they do not work. Over the 2 night stay this happened 7 times. 
On our second day there was an loud alarm going off in the stairwell right next to our room. I called front desk and she tells me to remain in my room and wait for the announcment from security. There was no announcement. The stairwell door was locked and remained locked. That night the whole hotel lost power. No announcement nothing. We left the hotel and the front driveway and parking garage were pitch black no staff assisting in any way. 
Last morning started with housekeeping knocking on our door at 731 am!! The do not disturb was on the door and it was 731am!! I told her to come back after we checked out. She proceeded to knock again 30 mins later and again 30 minutes after that
9 am the power goes out again!!! I walked down 8 flights of stairs to find out what was going on. 2 hours later it finally comes back. The door wont open again. We go down tell front desk they say they will send an engineer.  45 mins. Later. 
I call front desk for late check out. NO ANSWER! 1130 housekeeping again. We asked for a refund and they flat out refused. Didnt offer anything just said no. We are attempting to get a refund through our bank.

They have a good decent amount of machines to play. Some very good restaurants. For example, Cabo Cantina is not bad. The Oyster Bar seems to be the favorite, which I had not tried yet and here good news about it, with the line being long to get a seat.

My whole review here is based on the slot tournament I just finished. I did have fun playing in it. It was my second tournament between there's and Main Street Casino's tournament. There are four rounds on this tournament. They average all four scores. Like all slot machines, you never know which one is better than the other. 

Unfortanely, I did now win any money this time. The top 30 scores win money. Grand prize is $3000 and 26th to 30th place get $50. The best thing about this promotion, they give you 3 free nites. It's cool, because that's one less thing to worry about. This is a invite tournament only. 

I guess with all my casino play in the past, got me this invite. They also offer video poker tournaments as well. As for my room. Staying in the main tower is what you want. All of these rooms were re-done over 5 years ago. It's clean and simple. The only thing I wish they had was, mini refridge's in the roooms. 

I also like the fact of, how close this place is to my parents house.

Very disappointed because there would be no way I could sleep on a full with my boyfriend. Upon laying on the bed, felt springs in my back. I was not pleased. My dog has a better bed than this for crying out loud! To top it all off the remote for the television didn't work so we had to call the front desk and I was transferred three times! I explained how I'm not satisfied at all with my room and all they could say was it is $40 to upgrade to a suite but they're all sold out til the morning. I said forget it. I tried to fall asleep but kept tossing and turning and had to sleep alone in the bed next to my boyfriend. I fell asleep at 5:30am or so and was abruptly woken up by room service at 9am. Someone stole the ""do not disturb sign"" off my door apparently! So I told her no need for cleaning and I fell back asleep only to be awoken again by housekeeping at 11am. By that point I was just pissed so I called housekeeping and told them not to disturb me or come in my room until I check out the next day!! I promptly found a new do not disturb sign on my door.

1694618,2018-01-16,5,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"This rating is for the casino only, as I've not stayed at the hotel. PSHC is a perfectly average casino that caters primarily to locals. It is one of many in the Station Casino conglomerate. 

As of this writing, they've been undergoing major renovations for several months. My critique doesn't include the dust and disturbance associated with construction, especially since I think whatever the final outcome is, it will be an improvement on this old-school establishment. Besides, parking is free, something of a growing rarity in this city. Enjoy!

I live a mile from this Station casino, yet Red Rock casino remains my primary casino of-choice. I'll drive across town for it, so PSHC here is rated by comparison. As a locals' casino, it's frequented by people who enjoy pizza, waiting in a long line for oysters, and the $1-menu type for the cafe and next-up, the lackluster buffet. The buffet hasn't been upgraded since inception, I'm guessing; it feels like a cafeteria, no different than when my parents and I visited Vegas in the early 1990s. Retro Americana. Sans reboot. 

The casino floor, the people, and the restaurants all feel tired. Fast food options include Subway, and that's about it. Subway! The only upscale joint is overpriced, so there's no in between for the middle class customer. I guess that makes sense since the middle class is dead. I would never visit this casino for dining, not when Station offers better options elsewhere. 

But, I would visit this casino on the regular, as I do, for a Sportbook with ample seating and quality screenage. When I'm betting MLB, I love to linger here, enjoying the energy of fellow gamblers shouting and cheering. It's a good gd time. I never thought I'd be into that, but it's been great this year! That alone is why I come back now and again. It's not super uppity like some on-strip casino books, it's convenient, staff has been very friendly, and the drinks are typically stiff.

I booked the Palace Station on Kayak.com for a quick, relaxing weekend getaway for me and the wife. After making the drive up after work on Friday, we arrived at valet who was quick and courteous. We received the same treatment when arriving at the main lobby for check-in. I did find it a little weird that the front desk employees were unsure if they provided spa services or not. Not a big deal. The drive was long and we just wanted to get to our room to relax a little.

We were not offered any bellhop service so I grabbed as many of the bags that I could carry while the wife grabbed the remaining and we made our little walk to the Courtyard. I knew it was going to be bad when we had to exit out of the AC cooled casino into the sweltering Vegas heat (20 feet) before continuing back into the next building.  We were placed on the second floor where there is conveniently no elevator. 

Upon entering into the dirty, dingy room, we blast the AC to help cool off. When walking around the room, we both notice pockets of warm air that the AC can't seem to get rid of. The view was honestly the worst view of ANY Vegas experience I had. It was of the other rooms in the Courtyard.

Well we were starving and our information book was actually missing the page with info for the restaurants so we hit the buffet. It was only $8 but pretty damn bad. The carnitas was surprisingly not horrible. Everything else was.. Especially the banana crème and coconut crème pies we tried for dessert.

My wife was trying to be a good sport about it all but I could tell she was disappointed. If I was there solo, I MIGHT of just sucked it up but I knew my wife deserved something better. We ended up checking out a day early and moved over to Palms Place where I got a studio suite. It was a bit pricier being last minute but worth every damn penny. 

If you're looking for a cheaper, off strip, casino/hotel, check out South Point. I stayed there before with family and it wasn't too bad. Buffet was a lot better too. I'll never return to the Palace Station.

I didn't really want to give a full 5-stars because the property lacked that wow feeling... the property and room were generic and out dated, tissue box was missing but never replaced, tap dripping... you know. Little things...

But they're going through a refurb, adding onto the property, and pumping alot of money into the place. So probably give it a year or two and it will be as good as new!

I stayed her for a little over 2 weeks with my wife we are very clean people and don't like to live in a pig stie. Also don't want or need housekeeping every day. On the 4th day of our stay at around 9:30am I was In the restroom NAKED getting ready and some lady from housekeeping knocked on the door harder than the police do and at the same time she inserted her key and tried opening the door yelling room check room check.. The only thing that kept her from completely barging in was the latch on the inside of the door was locked so I called the front desk, housekeeping and there response was oh she did that we'll tell her not to do that. Great customer service skills. So that night security knocked on the door saying room check !?!?! never in my life have I heard such a thing was I harboring bodies or selling drugs or having parties !?! The whole time we stayed here we had the do not disturb sign on but I guess that means nothing here. The staff walks back and forth down the halls laughing and talking very loud they also have there radios on so loud that I could here everything they were saying from my room with the door closed and the tv on. There was trash all along the halls just left plates and stuff from room service sitting there for hours. Back to the do not disturb sign they knocked on my door pretty much every day at 9am asking "" do need your room cleaned"" NO IF I DID I WOULD TURN THE DOOR SIGN AROUND TO ' NEED HOUSEKEEPING'  I just don't understand the logic or lack of with these people. They would knock on my door around 12pm-2pm asking "" are you checking out"" I don't understand the lack of communication with the staff and management here. Also the housekeeping workers were all rude and looked so irritated I asked one for toilet paper she didn't say one word or even look at me just gave it to me and walked away. One of the biggest issues was the smell of marijuana coming in from the vents and hallways I know it's legal here in NV but if I wanted to smoke I would but once again front desk did nothing to fix the issue. And I still don't understand why I was being charged I think it was $10 or $15 a day for being on the 15th floor when we didn't ask to be up there so why charge me for an upgrade when I didn't ask nor want it. The carpets in my room were so stained random black spots every where and they weren't new they had been there for awhile it's The same with the hallways and around the elevators I understand employees are going in and out with there carts but they just looked old and dingy and forgotten about. The employees here are Ridicules !! They act like they own the place and management is non existent here it's really not a bad place food is average in the cafe and the Italian restaurant was decent.

1840592,2009-01-21,2,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"As a hotel  2 stars, as a catered event 4 stars.

We celebrated my parents anniversary at this hotel-casino.  Since my mom is a frequent gambler there, the hotel gave us special rates on their Courtyard rooms - very cheap ($42 a night).  I should've taken the tower room where my brother was at $69, much newer and easier to get around.  

When I walked into m courtyard room, it smelled like crap, really.  I think it was either the shower drain and/or the AC.  They didn't have an elevator for the 2nd floor where I was, either.  And for those older customers or with crutches like I was (sprained ankle), it was no fun. Also, guests were blatantly smoking right next to the ""No Smoking"" sign inside the rear lobby.  My bedsheet the first night had lipstick remnant in the edge.  What was housekeeping doing? Normally, I would have left and gone to the other section.  But with my ankle the way it was, and no elevator nearby, it was better to stay put.  

Fofrtunately, I slept in the other bed.  I happened to have a mini can of Lysol and sprayed the room with it.  I also had a small bottle of cologne that I sprayed.  It was more tolerable.  Housekeeping was informed and the room was cleaner and fresher the next day. The TV worked fine, but the outlet with the free high speed didn't work.  Fortunately, there was wi fi, and my laptop got a very good signal.  That was cool  But how dumb - to get to the electrical outlets to plug your computer, you have to move the dresser with the TV on top.  I did, but I'm guessing a lot of people could not slide 200 lbs. so easily in a carpeted room.

There was activity in the hallway all night Friday and Sat. You could hear the neighbors next door, obviously young drunk men telling each other NOT to sleep and keep drinking and partying.  You could hear some of them say, F**K I have a headache.

The anniversary banquet was very nice however, definitely 4 stars for the $40 per person event.  From the time we first called till the actual event, the catering managers kept in touch and made sure everythnig was going as scheduled.  We started out with the program including interactive game for the anniversary couple, and much of the family members entertained using the DJ's microphone and sound system.  

The food was good for a catered event,  They brought the salads out in unison.  Ten minutes later, they cleared off the salad plates, and all of the entrees (chicken or beef) were put on the tables. After a half hour, the servers then removed the plates and served the dessert and coffee.  They poured wine, white or red. The serviers were good except that perv that kept staring at my nieces and almost tripped a few times because he was distracted.Then there was a two hour dance with lots of hip hop. disco. and evem some ballroom music per quest request, and the DJ kept things moving

There were some glitches overall, and none of us will stay in the Courtyard again.  Otherwise, we would go back there again, as long as we knew OJ Simpson wasn't around anywhere.",eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,2,2,3,cjF6nY9FabjtgG9fjmOn1Q

* You need your key to go up any floor on the elevator. Understandable- It's annoying, but it's not a deal breaker.
* Floor 14 is the smoking floor so if you still decide to stay here and you want a non smoking room stay as far from floor 14.
* I had 2 rooms, initially both rooms were on the 15th floor- but I eventually got one room moved to the 18th because that room reeked of cigarette smoke.
* Despite the rooms smelling like cigarettes, when you enter the hotel, surprisingly, it's decent fresh air [the non smoking section of the casino is near the entrance of the hotel- LOVE THAT]
*  No matter what floor you stay on, the carpets are EXTREMELY filthy!! They need new carpets for sure.

In regards to their BUFFET:
* If I could rate separately, I'd give the buffet a solid 3.5 stars.
* It's cheaper if you have a players card with the hotel.
* The variety of food they have for breakfast is out of this world.
* Some foods were a little bland but still worth the $6.99
* They have an omelette station... tip the guy!!! $1 or $2 isn't much to ask.
* The condition of the seating area is outdated. Tape on seats to cover rips, wood exposed on bottom of booths.  Very unappealing when you're eating.

Researching my trip to death, a common theme was to check out ""the places where the locals go"". Promises of loose slots, friendlier dealers, food deals, lower table minimums, etc. 

Mrs. H. and I were just driving around, took the left off of LVB onto Sahara, and bumped into Palace Station. 

Me: ""Oh yeah!....,these are the joints I've been hearing about! These are the hidden gems that the locals go to!"".

Mrs. H: ""ummmmm...ok""

The breakdown: Stinky and smelly. Hard to imagine eating there, so it went no further than my imagination. There's signs everywhere for Louie Anderson. I just want to write him, give him 5 or 10 bucks, and tell him that I know things aren't great right now, but you don't need the work this bad...stay out of this place, Louie! 

Dealers had kinda pissy attitudes, largely due to a couple of players that were probably forced to leave the shelter in the daytime because that's when you're supposed to be looking for jobs. My luck, my mood, and the dealer's moods, seemed to be affected by this. 

Meantime, Mrs. H. was working her slot magic and stayed sort of even, but I don't know if this means we can vouch for loose slots or not. I can, however, vouch for the odor of mildewy, paneled, shag carpeted, nicotine stained rec room, though. 

We went along on our way, back onto Sahara, then further south, where we found my new love, the Silverton Lodge. That's another review. But for now, happy friggin trails, Palace Station.",pMUP-gcUBPyy51MzapFuoQ,2,0,1,4u2EeGd3vHV1kTWzySjQ2g

Reserved through Otel, good rate, cheap and easy for the one night we would be there for a show at House Of Blues. Drove in from SLC, was on a time crunch and didn't anticipate a non disclosed $100 room deposit. Not on confirmation emails where it was clearly printed, ""includes all fees""....ok...so my travel companion stated that it is normally common sense to anticipate a deposit at any hotel(true) & car rental, etc...this I should have thought of as we are both in banking and card services & see it all the time. Due to the spontaneous nature of the trip this didn't cross my mind but would have been something I would have noticed and could have planned for if it was disclosed at anytime before we left..instead we showed up in a hurry to get ready and go and spent a lengthy amount of time in check in line where we were told there was this $100 room deposit & had to scramble it between 2 cards & cash therefore tying up last remaining funds for gas, food, the show. Not a fun start, if Otel or the Palace had mentioned this in advance I would have planned accordingly. I didn't expect much from room since it was inexpensive, in the çourtyard and we were just there overnight so the only complaint is the shower...the head, the pressure and temperature is not pleasant. They need to consider a small investment in upgrading these. 
Upon check out it was another long, slow line then more problems, which seemed to be the theme with others at the counters..they need to staff more people during the peak check in and out times and have some sort of sense of urgency..so, due to agent error/communication and how entered in system they were going to refund us $75, after much discussion and discovery of more hidden fee's and a manager takeover to resolve issue, we got our authorizations approved to be released, $25 on my card, $50 on his & $25 in cash minus some 8.71 fee of some sort, again not on any documentation, just looked at it and verified again(no mention of $100 hold/deposit)...manager was professional, courteous and the only redeeming part of the people we dealt with. I think I might have paid some $14.99 fee for wifi & random unused and un needed services. 
All in all, I didn't have high, unrealistic expectations as it was inexpensive, booked through another party, but the check in and out time shaved precious minutes we needed to relax and enjoy our very limited time there.  I can say I almost 100% will not stay here again and likely will not use Otel due to the lack of $100 deposit mention on the very detailed invoice I got after booking. I called customer service one time but the nature of my question seemed lost in translation as the reps are in Turkey & their first language is Turkish. All I know is Hi, how are you(Merhaba Nasilsin) which didn't help much. It was a learning experience in which when booking future hotels will read many reviews and likely book directly with hotel or a very reputable 3rd party if it benefits me.",uiGw4rezxpJZoqd0uTdTew,2,0,2,oCssgg464wNQc5JNUfetGA

The casino/building itself looks like all other ""plain"" hotels on the strip, with it's slot machines and bland surroundings coupled with all the fun noises that make you think people are winning tons of money. Anyway, the room itself was small, but clean and with a great view of the strip. The bathroom was clean looking as well and a good size, especially for the price of the room. I took a star away because I asked for more towels and the front desk claimed they would be there in 10 minutes. They never came.  Also, I took away another star because it was a small, nice ordinary looking room. Great place to stay for a night or two, but nothing special considering all the other great hotels on the strip.

Receptionist was friendly and the hotel had a Subway and Starbucks as well as a gift shop with alcohol, toothbrushes, snacks, etc.  I took a stroll by the courtyard and realized how lucky I was to have been able to book the Tower for a reasonable price.

the reason for my 2 star is... the hotel and casino and amenities and restaruants are all good. i had no complaints about that at all.
my only gripe with this place is... they absolutely make you feel alienated if you are a family with children staying there. ok i get it, its a CASINO... we all know thats 21 and older. but i have never been approached and looked at by so many hotel employees telling me or my wife to basically get the children out of their casino. when all we were trying to do was walk through the outskirts (side walls) areas of the casino to get to the buffet etc. its like they only wanted us to stay in the room with the kids or walk along the OUTSIDE of the building is what it felt like. i have NEVER felt like this at any of the strip casinos ever. even if we stopped to use the restroom or change a bill or anything at any other casino has no employee ever hounded us as much as this place. las vegas is now a family destination and always has been for decades now. i feel this family alienation needs to stop asap at this hotel otherwise the word like mine here will tarnish this properties image. 
again, this wasnt by just one employee... it was by several. so this is not an isolated incident and no the two kids were not running around . they were in a freaking stroller.

anyways... i will never return nor stay there ever again until i get compensated something as an apology. this kind of behavior by your staff in very unprofessional. you need to actually target underage teenage kids for drinking and gambling. not target families walking through your casino with a stroller just trying to get something to eat on their vacation there.

Later I removed the pillows from bed and noticed graffiti on the headboard. The bathroom had something on the wall and the sink wasn't clean. The shower is the worst!

Parking is easy too as Palace Station isn't a popular destination for tourists.

If you like seafood or Cajun-style food, check out the Oyster Bar! The line's usually long during peak hours (hour+ wait anyone??) but it's worth it!

2121837,2013-08-21,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"For 5 nights (checked in Tues night and checked out Sun), we paid $163.23 initially (this included the amount to stay a night plus tax), and then at check out, we paid the resort fee (which was $16.79 a day x 5 days = $83.95) for a total of $247.18, which is roughly $50 a night including everything. 

You are forewarned -- this place charges a resort fee of $16.79 a day and prices are subject to change. Also, at check-in, they place a $100 deposit on your credit card in case something is broken/damaged. Make sure they give you this $100 deposit back at check-out.

We stayed in the courtyard rooms. These rooms are behind the hotel main tower and look worse/more condemned than a Motel 6. When I saw what we were staying in, I felt uneasy. If you could avoid the courtyard rooms, please do so. Inside the room was meh -- dirty, musty, old carpet, a TV, no fridge, a small desk, a stand-up only shower that probably wouldn't accommodate someone over 6 feet, small sink, a mirror that was situated awkwardly high, hair dryer, no coffee machine, clean toilet, clean sheets, and clean towels. The beds were ok -- we were able to sleep. The AC is kind of loud (there is a thermostat on the wall). 

We preferred not to have maid service, even though it is included in the resort fee. We just don't like people walking in to where our things are. Each day when we would leave, we would put the do not disturb sign on our door knob. On 2 of the 5 days, the do not disturb signs went missing and our rooms ended up being cleaned. Not sure if it was some prank or if the maids took it off so they could clean our rooms and therefore get tip? Anyways, not a good feeling.

As for wifi in the room -- kind of confusing. It says wifi is included in the resort fee, however, to log in to wifi daily, you have to go through a screen and accept a $5.99 charge for every 24 hours, typing in your name and room number. I was nervous because I would have to accept the $5.99 each time thinking that it would somehow appear on my check-out slip, but it ended up not being on my bill. So for future reference: you shouldn't be charged the wifi even though it says so. If you want clarification/reassurance, call the front desk or operator.

To sum it up:

Pros (not much):
-The Oyster Bar on the main casino floor is FANTASTIC! If you're a seafood fan, you have to try this place.
-There are security guards on bikes roaming around the parking garage and hotel grounds (even the courtyard area) at all hours.
-There is plenty of lighting in the courtyard parking lot, even though it does look sketchy.
-Had no problems with service. Everyone we interacted with was cordial.

Cons:
-It's an old hotel, so some of the amenities are older/dirtier/could use an update.
-It's mandatory to have a key to walk in to the hallway for the courtyard rooms from the parking lot, but for our first 3 days, this door was broken (so anybody could walk in to the area in which our room was).
-It's kind of nerve-wracking feeling unsafe about leaving your car in the courtyard parking lot.
-Not in the best neighborhood, kind of in a ghetto area.

If I do stay here again, I would make sure to book a tower room.",fLfHZj38quZJAN-RVgovKQ,3,0,2,dmlEGuOnoehNtVtinGJv5g

2212841,2011-08-12,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"I would give this hotel a 2.5 stars if I could. The rooms are not bad given the price you pay for. However, this place is just so far from everything else. I visited over Fourth of July weekend, and it was 100+ degrees every day. Since Palace Station is not on the Strip, you can't take the bus to and from the hotel. There's no public transportation, and you'd have to take a cab every time you go out on the town. They do have free shuttle service to a shopping center (still not on the Strip, and you'll have to switch to the bus from there), but it doesn't run very often. I've learned my lesson and now know: 1, pick my vacation destination with consideration of the local weather (aka, perhaps July is not the best time to visit Vegas, particularly if you stay at a hotel that's far from everything else); and 2, choose accommodation not only based on the price (if it's far from your daily activities, sometimes you end up paying even more for transportation costs than if you just pay for a slightly costlier hotel that's more centrally located and from where you can walk to where you'll be during the day). Plus, cab fare in Vegas is ridiculously high (and I'm saying this coming from DC where the cost of living is generally high). It was definitely not worth it to be frugal with the hotel and then wind up spending more on cab fares (not to mention the time wasted). Once we decided to save the money (and not spend $50 every day on taxis, and walk back at night (thought the heat wouldn't be that bad by then) to the hotel from the intersection of the boulevard and West Sahara Avenue. I'm an avid walker who normally likes to walk, and the walk itself only took no more than 30 minutes. However, even though it was past 9pm, the temperature was still uncomfortably high, and I almost fainted on our way because of the heat and dehydration. Thankfully we made it to Landry's (the seafood restaurant across from Palace Station) shortly after I began to feel lightheaded. I believe Palace Station caters more to Vegas locals (not for tourists who usually stay in the enclave on the Strip), and we probably made the wrong decision staying there when we ignored every factor other than the price (I've learned my lesson and will take a more holistic view next time when planning trips). Nonetheless, the location was still not the thing that bugged me most (it was our fault choosing to stay there, not the hotel's, and we could've and should've done our research better prior to arriving). When we checked in on Friday night the receptionist took my debit card number and told me there will be a $16.79 service charge per night if we used the room services. We were careful not to use any service (didn't even use the wifi, watch TV, and hesitated to take the shuttle until the last day). Still, when we checked out on Monday early morning, my card was charged $50.37 for ""room service fee."" I noticed this on my bill but didn't have time to inquire right on the spot because our taxi was waiting outside to take us to the airport. I thought it'd be easy to just go and call to ask later. When I got back home I called them and was transferred to their account department. Even though it was during their business hours, no one answered the phone and I left a voicemail detailing my question and asking them to call me at the number I gave. I never received a call back or got a refund. I'm pretty sure they said I would be charged only if we used the services, which we didn't. It's just annoying (and I hate companies who do this) having to pay some nitty extra fees not already included in your booking. In addition, they were all along ambiguous about this ""service charge,"" and I'm left alone wishing we had gone to a different place.",LUaWs5Y4yF_QKADPai-y3Q,1,0,2,_vEQnt1R6VXyw12OXWROQQ

There's no elevators.  Everything in the courtyard rooms will need to be brought up the stairs.  The rooms are some distance from the entrance.  Walking through the casino to the rooms, it was passed the bingo hall and looked like we were walking into the mirrors at the end.  Very trippy.  

Being on the north end, it's still far from strip, even to the stratosphere and riviera.  I would have paid the extra bucks to stay on the strip since taking the taxi cost just as much.  

They do offer shuttles to fashion show mall and airport but I never figured out where the drop off/pick up station was since I was told it was off in the corner outside.  And Vegas in the winter time doesn't offer you time to kindly round the corners to find the right one.

Booked two rooms (Courtyard 1511 & 1516) for Feb 22-25th, 2016 for me and three others. All I've ever wanted from a hotel in Las Vegas was a bed, a shower, and a place to store my crap because, really, who spends much time there? The bed was springy but I was able to sleep without issue, so I have to give that a plus. The shower, however, gets three minuses because it was so laughably bad. The head topped out at about 5ft height, and the nozzles were so old and rusted that the water pressure was barely a trickle. Regulating the temperature was also a juggling act.

Gaming was okay, they had a lot of older and some of the newer machines, as well as $3 craps and a boatload of asian-themed table games.

There aren't even any directional signs to tell you which of the many hallways you should take. Instead, there's one map at the entrance that you have to memorize as you venture into the labrynth of rooms.

Long lines for food that no longer hits the mark. They must advertise in Orange County, CA because the oyster bar is always packed with asians from OC. More proof that nothing good in Vegas lasts.

While the hotel does not call it a ""resort fee"" per se, they still get you with a $16.80 daily ""Service fee"" which broken down is $10.00 per day for wifi internet and 6.80 for the tourism fee.  The wifi internet is completely unacceptable and kept kicking me off every couple of minutes.  It is slow and you I had difficulty downloading websites like linkedin, shutterfly, and stubhub--tried downloading tickets from stubhub.com--more connectivity issues.  The hotel sent their technical enginners to the room to fix the internet connection--but even they were not able to fix it 100%, after multiple attempts. I think this is done on purpose to force people to buy the upgraded internet. Even when you upgrade your internet, the wifi still kicks you off.  At the end of my stay, I spoke to several layers of management to get refunded smy $10.00 for the wifi since it did not work consistently. 

Other issues:  paper thin walls--could hear all the neighbors. Restaurant service very slow and they were out of half the entrees we asked for.

The hallways are disgustingly filthy, along with the staircases (YES, staircases because they do NOT have elevators).  It seems they have not vacuumed the halls or carpeted staircases in months.  The security and front desk staff have little to no customer service, and they're incapable of taking responsibility for any of the issues going on in their hotel.  We booked through Priceline; they (the hotel), said we had to have Priceline call and make any requests, so we did.  We asked Priceline to call and confirm a late check-in as well as a KING size room; after holding for 21 minutes, we were told they would have the King bedroom for us. They failed to have a King room for us, they did not offer to move us to a King room should one have been available our 2nd night stay... And they were very rude when I asked them to talk to a Manager about Priceline having called to reserve it. The lady actually walked off with my Driver's License and Bank Card instead of giving it back to me to hold onto until she completed her conversation with the Manager.  Also; they're vending machines.... Which they are NOT responsible for; SUCK!  The Pepsi machine took $4.25 of our money, and the hotel security says it was not their responsibility, and the front desk (who obviously knows this is a common issue), says they're only allowed to refund $2.00, and you have to take your ID to them and they will give you the money; they will not credit the card on file that they gladly hold the $100.00 security deposit on and withdraw any additional fees from before refunding (which they make you sign a paper that says they have 30 days to do).  I am pissed off, to say the least, that Priceline did not further research this hotel to determine the pictures they advertise match the criteria of the hotel room you get upon booking, and the hotel for their lack of professionalism, hospitality and customer service.  The only good things I have to say about this hotel are: Viola, at the Buffet; she is so kind, personable and great at her job.

We had requested to not be seated near the screaming baby, they originally sat us at the table beside it. We asked to be moved and were handed off to another hostess with assurances that she had ""plenty of open booths""...we tromped through the other dining room in circles until she finally found one. 

Our beverage server took forever to get to us and that was after I'd seen her give attitude to and be rude to two other tables. Oh joy.

Consequently, the hotel has no problem booking rooms.  In fact, they are more than happy to give your room to another patron.  I submitted a paid reservation for the first of two nights, only to be told that it did not guarantee the room.  However, had I not shown up, they would have kept the money I paid for the room.  

The room was not ready when I checked in after 10pm ( LA - LV drive ).  The staff called housekeeping and was told that it would take an hour to make up a room.  I reminded the staff that I had a secured reservation and they offered to switch rooms from a two-queen to a king with a roll-away bed.  Huh! I declined and the staff bumped someone else from a room so I could have the room type that I had reserved ( with payment ).

The courtyard is trashy and dated. Stay in the tower rooms. 

I suppose that since I checked in late, and at the end of the line of convention goers, I was not informed of all the amenities that I would be charged when I checked out of the hotel.

I booked this package deal through expedia. After reviews of the courtyard I called expedia to upgrade to the main tower room.  I missed to deadline due to a family wedding before our trip. The upgrade would've only cost me $77 more.  When I called and explained the situation to the manager he told me I could upgrade that but that would cost me an additional $230 I told him I would just stay in the courtyard and just hope for the best.  He assured me that they installed flat screen TVs and mattresses and that the rooms were a bit dated but that we could decide what we wanted to do if we weren't satisfied. We got to the hotel,  went to our courtyard room and I was actually not that disappointed. It had tile in the bathroom with a small standing shower,  huge king bed,  a cabinet,  3 drawer dresser,  table with a mirror, hair dryer, iron & ironing board (only 6 hangers though) and 2 night stands. 
The cons began to ruin our stay. 
#1 shower curtain leaks water all over the floor leaving puddles of water every day when you take your shower.
#2 the air conditioner was full of dust that I had to breathe
#3 A random $24.51 charge on my credit card (I called front desk and there was no record,  but yet it was still deducted out of my account. I immediately contacted chase and had them put a fraud alert on my card and told them to cancel the card) 
#4 Daily resort fee of $16.79 is a bit high for a hotel that's not on the strip and for a person that doesn't swim or use the gym.
#5 the night before leaving a big discusting cockroach in my room coming from the bathroom. Front desk was going to send security.  I was thinking what's security going to do?  
#6 Guests smoking weed in their room the whole week we were there
#7 I never saw security patrol the courtyard once! 
#8 Some sketchy looking people that appear to be trying to get into the courtyard rooms or pool area when they're clearly not staying there. 
#9 EXTREMELY tight slots.  Bonus rounds on max bet paying you a measly  $15 (joke)
#10 Poor front desk employees 

The positives 
(even though I'm keeping my rating at 1 star. .that was an overall rating! )

#1 excellent house keepers..I loved all of them. Very friendly. .best part of the hotel. 
#2 Free shuttle that takes you to the Fashion Show mall or airport.  Get the schedule when you check in. 
#3 Free drinks when playing table games,  slots,  or poker (poker room will even call your room if you're on the waiting list)
#4 descent restaurant choices
#5 fairly close to the strip

I would stay in the courtyard again if they clean the air conditioning and patrol the area frequently for people that are using drugs on their property. I also suggest finding a way to update the shower curtain to maybe a closed shower to prevent the water from going all over the floor.  I liked being in the courtyard and just walking down the hall to go out to smoke without having to pass through the casino area.  
The nasty COCKROACH in my room ruined the whole entire experience for me.  I should've gotten a free week's stay just for that alone. Ewwwww!",3H_ydme6Gn3bKn4Fs8LGfQ,1,0,1,kAM6bVKKaBPjHkltYh6ZeQ

There are a fair amount of people that go to this buffet and you do have to wait some time to get in. I think the line is attributed to the fact that the buffet is not that expensive. You also get a discount if your a station casinos card holder.

Honestly you eat what you pay for. Not that expensive buffet price = mediocre food.

They have an omelette station, a ham and turkey carving station, typical breakfast foods for brunch (eggs, bacon, sausage), Mexcan food (rice, beans, tacos), American food (pizza, fried chicken, mashed potatoes) and a dessert station (typical pies, cakes). Out of the breakfast items for brunch, I liked the Eggs Benedict. They actually presented this pretty well with a cute little tomato on top of the egg and the muffin. I liked the desserts too. They had mini pecan bar and lemon bars. They also had a fair selection of non-fat yogurts. I liked the pecan non-fat yogurt the best.

For me, Palace Station is somewhere in between the 2, leaning more towards the latter though I'm sorry to say. 

It's definitely not fancy or glamorous but it's affordable (from what I've heard), there's some decent food places (I heard the seafood bar is supposed to be good) and there's lower minimum table games. On the strip and even downtown, it's getting harder and harder to find a $5 21 table on the weekends. 

I'm wondering when Station Casinos is going to let go of this property and build a resort that has something to offer - that draws people in because the current property doesn't have much in that way in my opinion.",I2qJvA0tbGdZJ3XrwzwfzA,4,3,2,vLznTp9kZnLtkRcyqMd7WA

This appears to be a popular place with the locals as I saw many hanging around.  Parts of the Casino appear to be very worn, though other parts are very well maintained which tells me that they are probably slowly remodeling the Hotel which isn't a bad thing.

I really think somewhere on the house keeping check list should say to turn off alarm clocks! I dont even own an alarm clock much less know how to turn one off at 5 AM! Obviously sine it kept going off so I finally had to unplug it... From behind the bed.

The bed was horrible, with 2 of us in a king it sinks down in the middle, my back is killing me!  No in room coffee, no tub (I asked for a tub but the petite suites do not have them).  There used to be a nice ) shaped couch in the window as a sitting area now they made a bed to fit into that area which blocks the view. The sitting area is on the dark side of the room, seems backwards to me. 

When we checked in at 3 there was dirty blankets & a pizza box in the hall near our room. We went to dinner & a 10:30 show, came back after 1 and it was still there.

They only provide 2 towels, wash cloths & hand towels... Seriously I can use those up myself in 2 days! On the bed only 3 pillows, no extras tucked away in the closet... And cheap pillows at that.

They have a shuttle, but it's not very often, be sure to check the schedule... we just used a taxi.  It's about $20 all the way down to NY NY... or you can wait for the shuttle.

There is a Starbucks downstairs & yes, a Coco's but don't eat there breakfast was terrible.  We had over cooked eggs and undercooked potatoes for $12 a plate.  Go someplace else for breakfast!

At over $100 a night ""event"" pricing, that is completely unacceptable. Imperial Palace and several of the really cheap downtown hotels have MUCH better beds.

In addition, not only was the Hotel hosting the dog show (and they did everything wrong), they were also hosting a Harley Davidson Rally, and every night there were live bands playing right outside, disrupting sleep until late at night. When calling the desk to complain, we were given the runaround multiple times as to when the music would stop, none of the staff seemed to have any honest answer. so they just made up answers.

I do recall that the business center was a little bit on the pricey side - the computer kiosks were set up in a way where it automatically took a $15-$20 deposit off of your debit card, even if you were only using a terminal for a minute or two, which was credited back to your account days later.

I had a lunch buffet comp for two and was excited to check it out because the buffet at Boulder Station (a sister casino & hotel) was so very good for the price.
My son and I were taken aback right from the start when hostesses started arguing with raised voices right in front of us about seating customers who were standing in line for the buffet.
Our server, Amy, was very pleasant and efficient, nothing but praises for her.  She was very busy but found time to make sure our beverages were refilled often and that we didn't need anything.
 
The food was what made this experience the absolute worst it could possibly be.  Not only was the selection disappointing but the food appeared dried up and old looking.  Still, I gave it a try.  It was difficult to find anything appetizing enough to fill my plate.  

I chose roasted chicken, a piece of Italian sausage, red mashed potatoes, a spring roll, a couple pieces of peppered pork, and that's it.  Nothing else looked edible.
Oh - I did get a small dish of bread pudding, it was truly the only food item that looked fresh.  Turned out, the bread pudding was the only food that was hot.  All of the food on my plate was cold or barely warm - perfect breeding temperature for bacteria growth.

My son who gets the same thing at every buffet: pizza, pasta with red sauce, macaroni and cheese, hamburgers, and fried chicken.  He ends his buffet with a big sampling of desserts.  All of his food was cold or luke warm except his hamburger which was made to order so impossible for it to be cold, thank goodness.  Trouble was, the meat didn't have the texture one would expect in a burger, indicating the quality of meat was very poor.  Even the desserts weren't what one would expect, they were flavorless or stale (white cake, a variety of cookies, soft serve ice cream).

My son said the macaroni and cheese barely had any ""cheese"" or sauce at all, explaining why the dish was covered with parmesean cheese.  The pasta bake, with their version of red sauce was the same... barely enough sauce to make the pasta edible.  On his second trip to the buffet he picked up some more fried chicken, this time it was hot enough to meet food safety standards.  I don't carry around a thermometer in my purse but have worked in restaurants enough to know and be able to tell with the touch of my hand if food is any where near the proper serving temperature.  Anyone with common sense knows that cold and luke warm foods that are supposed to be hot are not within health standards and guidelines.

If our lunch was not comped I would have taken one look at the poor selection and unappealing food on the buffet, turned around and demanded my money back before even trying it.  That's how bad this buffet was today.

I thank our server Amy for making a horrible dining experience as pleasant as it could be under the circumstances.  It's too bad her charm and server skills are being wasted at this buffet.",iAA4lycfsrwFucAnnPMQVw,0,0,1,xmbkb-a8ilCIe3PKhT8ntw

We stayed here in December 2011.  After reading reviews of the Courtyard rooms (horror stories), we decided to upgrade our room at check-in to the tower rooms for the offered minimun of $20 / night / room.  We were not disappointed.  The rooms were modern, clean, and reasonably well sound-insulated.  The rooms were nicer than at the Anaheim Hilton, where we had been the two nights prior.  We never even saw a Courtyard room, so bad were the reviews.  We ate at the Grand Cafe, and found the food to be fresh, tasty, and well prepared.  We also ate at the Feast Buffet, a good deal on it's own, and even better if you sign up for their player's club.  Very good food for breakfast and lunch- did not try the dinner.  I'd stay there again, no hesitation.  One note, check-in took a while, but I hear that generally in Vegas it takes a while to check in.  

We booked our stay through AA.com vacations, and they waived the ~$17/day resort fee- package deal special I guess.  Overall, a good value.",9a_JAaLIccxAz6J5chcVrw,1,0,4,t0XiAJFEY8KDlWttJR9RMw

It was my first time in Las Vegas. There were four of us: two friends, my bf, and me. We were on a tight budget. I found a deal for the flight and this hotel on Expedia, and quickly snatched it. Since the price was surprisingly low, we has expected a, you know, crappy hotel and service, which we didn't really mind because we didn't plan to stay in the hotel for the whole trip.

But we were wrong!

The hotel was really nice. They have shuttle that run from the airport to the hotel. We had to wait for a long time, but it was better than taking a cab. The room was nice. Everything was clean. Beds were nicely made. No weird smells or stains.

They have good buffet as well, both for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I was only at the buffet for breakfast a couple of times. The food was good for a cheap quality hotel as this one. I'd give it a 7/10. There were a lot of options, which I liked. The dessert was kind of nasty though.

This hotel is a little far away from the strip, but fear not, they have shuttle that go to the strip several times a day.

Located off the freeway and Sahara, Palace station is one of many Station Casinos surrounding Las Vegas. Upon arriving, it was a bit confusing cause we weren't sure where the garage was or if they had one. But we did find it in the back after a confusing way to get there. 

Upon check in, it wasn't busy as I thought it would be at 3pm. Then again it was on a weekday, so it wasn't as busy. We did get a petite suite, which was kind of nice, till we walked around. It was roomy, and the color scheme seems nice. I did like the window view, which goes out a little like a half cylinder. What I didn't like was the the desk and Internet connection was no where near each other. The Internet connection is on one side of the room, next to the big TV, but the desk is on the opposite side. Unfortunately the connection and wire length of both Internet and my computer isn't long enough to make it to the desk. In other words, we used our bed as the laptops platform. Other than that, I did like the bed and the petite suite was roomy. A decent place to stay in. 

After settling in our room, we decided to go to Broilers steak house. I have a thing for steaks, and we have been here before. First time around seems good, but this time around, wasn't as satisfying as the first. I notice they did change a little bit but still same menu. As usual, I had my prawns. They were very good to start with. The fillet Mignon was a bit unsatisfactory. Even though I did order it medium, it was a more on the red side. I still ate it, but wasn't as happy as the first. 

We did go gambling, and I prefer craps to gamble. The dealers were not as social or entertaining at first. But once you start betting for them, they come alive and become more sociable. As for me, I'm more of a person who feels comfortable to go on a craps table. But having dealers not interacting as much on craps, seems a bit intimidating to try it. But after a while, they come around in a way. Even though I did lose my money, it was kind of fun in the end. 

After a goodnight sleep, we went to Grand Cafe for breakfast. Even though the waitress was friendly, wasn't really happy with the fact of her assumption, that the wife is speaking for the both of us. The wife wanted coffee so the waitress assume that I wanted coffee and poured me a cup. I'm not a coffee person, cause I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have dairy or cream in my system. But drank it anyways. since its already poured and didn't want to let it waste. I was able to order a breakfast skillet, which was decent. Even though, I know it was morning, and it wasn't as busy. So I wasn't sure why the waitress was taking her time in the back, when waiting for a refill 

Overall, Palace station is a decent place to lay your head. Gambling wise, don't expect much when it comes to interacting. Not unless you do something first. Food wise, it was decent and edible. Grand Cafe has its ups and downs, but an ""OK"" rating.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,0,3,0dDZm-AIeuibxZkv40t0TA

3091745,2011-10-08,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"This is my first and last visit to this hotel and casino.  Let me start at the beginning. It is off the strip. Not far but your not going to be wanting to walk.  And driving Las Vegas sucks!

We reserved, and paid in advance for the room on the hotels website. When we check in were told there's an additional $16 a day resort fee.  I know all these hotels are doing this crap now but it gets to me.  Just add it on to the price of the room upfront.

The layout of the rooms is confusing. The place really shows its age.  Rooms are small.  Clean but small.  The shower is a little corner deal. With a curtain. No tub. So there water everywhere. Reminds me of a locker room.

The casino is sad. The people in it look sad.  I don't want to turn into one of the sad people.  I will not be back.",mpG03rv5DYxbDCoiG_5cUQ,1,0,2,h9jhK_xptutYVLLmgZLSvw
3096771,2014-01-27,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"Palace Station! This place is both good and bad. Depending on what you are looking for this could be the perfect dream or perfect nightmare. This is a 3 Star Hotel and for decent price you get a decent place. 

NEVER get the discounted rooms. Believe me pay the extra $10 or $20 more for a tower room. I think the tower rooms were upgraded around 2006, but the discounted rooms have been there since the beginning of time. A few friends of mine reserved a standard room around 2006 took one look at the Discount rooms and said HELL NO! We upgraded immediately afterwards. 

""We love locals"" I have a slight gripe with this logo plastered all over the hotel and casino. I feel like a semi-local because I visit Las Vegas every year more often than I visit my parents. I have nothing against locals, but if you want the to experience the  Las Vegas you see on TV and Movies you DO NOT want the local experience. Let's just say for the tourist don't leave the Strip Area after dark. I am slightly offended, because I don't feel welcome as a visitor. Does a 4 hour drive count as local? Why do they love locals? Coupons anyone?

PROS:
-A great feeling of old Las Vegas. Back in the day discount room, free food, and rewards were flowing everywhere to attract people to gamble. Now in 2014, The Strip doesn't care you pay crazy prices for stay, food, and resort fee. There are no discounts, because they make money through everything now. Palace Station still gives discounts and free rooms.
-Coupons with every stay on food and gambling.
-Oyster Bar! :) If you haven't been here at least once while in Las Vegas, you are crazy. Open 24 hours!
-The best 3 star hotel! For a bargain hunter don't even both with Circus Circus or motels
-Rewards! I got free rooms after one visit from slot play.
-The Grand Cafe is is pretty decent for breakfast or late night food.
-Located near the 15 Freeway off Shara Exit you won't get lost. On your final day it's easy for a quit exit.
-Parking. Easy and close by. Just lock your doors and take valuables.

CONS:
-It's not a 4 or 5 star hotel. I usually don't go to 3 star hotels, but if I feel like saving money. Palace station is the best.
-Casino smoke can get pretty intense. First reason it doesn't have the state of the art vents like the larger casinos. A lot of people smoke here. Even in a non-smoking room you will notice it. Get outside when ever you can.
-""We love Locals""
-Poker Room is depressing. I love 2/4 and 3/6 half kill Limit Poker with small blinds. I gave up going here. It's just locals using coupons and getting rewards. It was much better back during the Poker Craze of early 2000.

The pros out way the cons here. I want to give Palace Stations more stars, but I can't because the cons drive me nuts. I will highly recommend this place to anyone on a budget and tell anyone that has high expectation to leave now. At least eat at the Oyster bar that is by far the best feature :).",tHjAg9Fy3TUB564rKBn0bw,2,2,3,rKguFoX11DinodNMkOdt3w
3097029,2010-08-11,1,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"We all should know by now that the Palace Station is not a Palace! 

So I stayed here for the cheap room rate I was expecting----- 

I saw on the Internet where you could stay for $28.00 for a night. What I didn't see was that in the upper right hand corner of the screen, there is an additional $14.99 tagged onto the room rate for some dumb*ss services that no one would more than likely use... Like free admission to the swimming pool! Notary service! (Notary!!!!) --- This is the Palace Station! People don't come here to do business, they come here to gamble, sleep, eat and limp around the joint... 

So here I come thinking I'm paying $28.00 for a night---- ""No Sir! If you read the screen closely, you would see where the $14.99 is mandatory and for all the benefits listed on that poster over there(pointed to advertising panel),.... Umph*! I guess I'm stuck paying with tax over $58.00 when it was all said and done...$#!@!%$#%#$#@!@ 
""NEVER AGAIN!"" I told the woman behind the counter... as I checked in.... ""Good Luck staying in business in this economy!"" 

I have Diamond level with Hilton, and I could have had a room with a full buffet breakfast for around $40.00 total during the week days... Soooo Pi*sed! 

OK... So I was duped.... The room at the Palace were the Courtyard rooms, not the tower. The room is about the size of a standard Motel 6 but skankier looking and smelling a bit like urine...ewwe! The shower is short for tall people above say 5'8"" . You'd need to stoop to get your hair wet. And the soaps are so thin and sad. 
The towels----well, don't get too wet, or you might not have enough towel to dry yourself off with one towel.... 

To sum up this fiasco: For the money $58.00, most can more than likely stay in a more generous room elsewhere, and you might even get a decent breakfast with that!",kkZBWhJXzMIox75wiy4OWQ,4,2,1,QSvv4uTLzOVTTCYaZuzk6g

I tried have an open mind when I came here, but started hating this place when I couldn't sleep all night long! I could hear the people on top floor and could hear everything that was going on in the hallway, and because it's Vegas, there was always activity in the hallway all night long! It was so bad, that I had to make ear plugs from toilet paper! The next two nights I left the bathroom and the room fan running all night long for white noise effect- it helped.

We had fun playing the slots and playing bingo (which was reasonable in price).  Donated a lot, but it was still fun.  I just wish Vegas would mandate no smoking in the casinos, it was rather gross.

Their restaurants were just okay.  The Grand Cafe was yummy and their portion sizes were large.  Cabo and the Italian restarurants were a little over priced and I've had better food elsewhere.  The ""Beast Buffet"" was a great deal!  Their food was good and there was a really good selection.  Their waitstaff did a wonderful job making sure plates were cleared and drinks were full.

Front desk staff offered nothing in regards to activities, shuttle information, etc unless you asked.  They did not offer anything and were overall unfriendly, but can't expect too much when you're paying less than $25/night (plus a ridiculous resort fee of $16-17 a night)

3180335,2018-01-15,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"ONE thing I HATE about ANY business or ANYTHING commercial is when they cheat to get ahead. STAY AWAY!

We signed up for a room that was ADVERTISED as being around $36 a night. But then they tack on this ""RESORT FEE"" (by choice - I am pointing that out) of $25 that supposedly gives you access to WIFI (hey what happened to that being free?- OMFG really? WE gonna get like that now?) So they tack on some ridiculous RESORT FEE that they say gives us free wifi (could not use it), access to the GYM (Have you SEEN me? Does it LOOK like I use the gym at home? Let alone in Vegas???) and 15% off of the gift shop. (OMG REALLY? Because the world is just falling over itself to buy garbage from the giftshop with already over inflated prices to more than compensate for the 15% off that everyone gets...)

So really that was just the start of it. They lied about their room rate and said that it was only going to be about $36 but when it was all done and said and taxes and whatever BS fees they tacked on, it was $82 and change... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Please piss on my back some more and tell me how it is raining...  To top it off, I never even SAW a GYM, NOR did I ever even see signs. And NO, the stair case is NOT a StairMaster and JUST because you have everything spread out does NOT mean that walking around is like being on the treadmill... Oh and let's talk about this ridiculous WIFI you offer... it is something like 10kbs and I had to call the assistance line because apparently, there was so much traffic that my device (tablet) could not even log in to pull up a map of the surrounding area. They explained that at times there is high traffic and you need to make several attempts to go to a site or do something like that. But if we wanted to pay $5.00 more we could UPGRADE to 30 kbs. OH BOY! Sign me UP!   

We stayed in Room 16016 or something like that. They say no smoking but then have this ridiculous looking pillow that looks, well, JUST like a cigarette with a filter on it laying across the bed... The bathroom toilet was a joke. You can not even sit down to drop a deuce without being jabbed in the thigh by the toilet paper holder. The lighting was dim and as soon as you think of flushing the toilet look out. Pressure assist kicks in and shoots your turds into orbit from the back of the toilet. I felt like I was about to have my innards sucked out at first. The toilet was also weird. It was at a lower angle/ plane/ level that other toilets I have sat on. I felt like I was partly squatting. I know that I am fixated on the toilet here. Can't help it. How about that the sliding glass doors for the shower had a very sharp edge, like someone had closed one too hard and it chipped the glass and until someone cuts themselves, well, no need to replace it...

BUT- They did have hot water. Yay! They actually managed to provide something that they SHOULD be providing... No coffee though and the towels were like 48 TPI. They were better served brushing a horse...

So out of the room and into the Cafe because we were hungry and wanted some food. Their late night dinner was well, like a casino late night dinner... Greasy/oily and okay, but it worked. Did NOT sit well with the wife though. For breakfast though the hot cakes were thin and chewy and not cakey and mushy. I will give them that too.  We were going to stay two days but since they had that BS RESORT FEE that they have decided to tack on, We decided to not give them anymore money then we needed.

And you know what? A Word or two on resort fees- JUST because Nevada PAsses a law and makes it LEGAL to charge STUPID RIDICULOUS CHARGES FOR CRAP THAT USED TO BE FREE, does NOT mean that you have to charge it. It is nothing but a lie to get you in the door. Next time we go to Vegas, We will be checking into the Four Queens over on Freemont. You wanna know why? Because they might be a little more costly, but at least THEY ARE TRUTHFUL AND STATE THERE IS NO RESORT FEE THAT THEY CHARGE...

So there you  have it. Avoid this place unless you want some breakfast (which is served 24 hours a day from what they say). 

Oh and I almost forgot, their GIFT SHOP, yeah. Because you need to buy merchandise that is branded with their logo all over it... Really though if they stopped being a jerk and charging for stuff that many others provide for free, I might change my tune, but I am just one guy here and I have NO plan to revisit them anytime in the near or distant future.",hlzXyd67XZr8z8l-gQL6KA,0,0,1,ze1w1tn1-md0zxqgNx5sPA

I don't really care about the quality of the bed because I've slept likea baby on the floor before but my gf doesn't think the beds are comfortable.  The restroom looks nice though. I like it a lot.

I like their little work out room too.  Very helpful to relieve some stress especially for those who lost their money gambling lol. 

The casino was nice. Had a great time with my family in there.  I like that they have restaurants and they're open late.  However idk if the restaurants are open 24 hrs. The food was pretty cheap though.  There were 99 cents margaritas which were yummy. At the Oyster bar I saw on the menu that says after 1am bud lights were 2 dollars I believe which is a good price. Unfortunately I didn't get to take advantage of that.  

We ate at the restaurant for breakfast. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs and I would have to say it was yummmmaaaaay.  I think pricings on their food is very fair.  Our server was nice.  Very much appreciated for her service.

The operator had told us 24hour pool--not the case. Nor did we receive a bathtub as promised but a dinky shower.

A) cheap 
B) free parking (though I'm not sure if it's actually free)
C) she mixed up this hotel with another hotel 

So that's how we ended up staying in one of the courtyard rooms. 

The good:
- hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. We had booked a room for two nights separately and they were nice enough to let us keep the same room, though we had to check out and then check back in. 
- finding a parking spot is not much of a problem. 

The bad: 
- the carpet has stains and a weird texture. 
- the AC is loud. I know people who snore real bad and this is worse. 
- the bathroom is not short-people friendly. I'm about 5 feet and I was barely able to see my entire face in the mirror. 
- on the topic of non-short-people friendly bathrooms, there's only one dinky hook in the bathroom for you to really hang your clothes. BUT ITS AT THE TOP OF THE DOOR. WHY????
- the walls are thin. From the room we could hear people talking as they walk down the hallway.
- it's relatively far from the strip. 

The ugly:
- there's mold growing on the ceiling corner in the bathroom. 

tl;dr you get what you paid for but tbh you're much better off shelling out a couple more bucks to get a decent quality room on the strip",xqTZrkkejc004muSHra4nQ,1,0,2,6C1n_N-dfwY6GXYRzumgHQ

Stayed here for a few days during Spring Break (a busy time, also they're constructing more rooms so they have ""hard hat"" breakfast specials). Checked in around 730 pm on Wednesday evening and checked out 11 am on Friday. Checking in/out was a breeze. Friendly staff. Don't forget to sign up for a rewards card if you're a local or frequent visitor as your stay counts towards points! Starbucks is located right after the lobby as well. The elevator for the tower rooms is only for guests with a card. Elevators were QUICK!!! I loved it. 

We stayed on the 6th floor, not much of a view but still a view, I compulsively wiped all handles and light switches then lint rolled the bed under the covers & it was nearly unnecessary because it came away with nary a hair or lint to spare. Room was CLEAN. So was the bathroom. Shower is large enough to share (no bathtub, idk why it seems some people are complaining about bathtubs but our room had a walk-in shower with glass walls), hot water is a bit finnicky, unfortunately walls are thin so ask for a corner room if you wanna get your business on. Basic tower room, I only wish it had a mini fridge because we ate at the oyster bar that night (my favorite place to eat) and OBVIOUSLY had leftovers that had to go unrefrigerated. Its ok though, they were gone in under 8 hours. ALSO, the Grand Cafe downstairs was actually a great place to eat! I've reviewed both Oyster Bar & Grand Cafe in other reviews if interested. 

The shuttle schedule to the strip and airport is printed in the entryway of the lobby, seems pretty convenient though we used a ride service. Wish we ordered room service to try it because of the reasonable pricing, but there are many great places to eat nearby within walking distance. Will try next time.

I searched for somewhere showing the fight and came across this $10 UFC viewing party. My group decided to check it out and was very disappointed. For $10 you get to stand in a short line that takes forever because there are security guards frisking you and ruffling through your pockets and belongings. You then proceed to the ballroom where the seats are arranged in a clever circular octagon formation, facing several large screen projectors. It looked cool until you try to find a seat and realize that the screens are set too low and you can't get a full view of the fight unless you're in the front row because you will have trouble seeing around the person in front of you. Once seated you can visit the wonderful food court they have set up. $2 hot dogs, $1 bags of chips, and $1 canned soda. That's it, and you aren't allowed to bring in outside food or beverage. Maybe the reason for the short selection is the lack of tables they don't provide, just chairs. They did have a full bar for those interested in cocktails, as well as $1 bottled water. To make the evening that much better we had to wait 45 minutes for a cab to get back to our hotel because they had none waiting and there was nobody available to call one for the long line of people who wanted to leave after watching the fight.

In conclusion, I will not be back. Word of advice for the Palace Station. The events would be much cooler if you changed a few things. Provide tables for everyone and provide more food choices.

I'm a pretty laid-back traveler and am usually not picky with where I stay. However, upon arriving, I was sadden to have to agree with them.

The price seems really cheap at first, but then they tack on a resort fee. Online, it says that this supports the Wifi (which is very basic and only allows basic internet searching), a free airport shuttle (that NEVER came and I ended up splitting an Uber with other waiting guests), and a pool (super small). Not sure where my extra $15 was going to every night, but it certainly wasn't for my benefit.

The location is pretty far away from the strip as well, but since I was on a business trip, it was luckily close to where I needed to be. When I finally got to my room in the tower (super late at night after waiting for my aforementioned mysterious ghost shuttle) all I wanted to do was take a hot shower and pass out. The lobby was clean, and the room looked like any standard hotel room. However, though the rest of the room looked pretty decently clean, when I hopped into the shower, I noticed stray hair all around the bathtub. No other amenities in the room as well - no coffee machine/tea, mini fridge, etc.

If it weren't for the cheap price and the close proximity to where I needed to be, I wouldn't stay here again. It's not motel/hostel status, but it's definitely not worth the price.

I performed the routine cleanliness check (stains, hair, etc.) and I didn't detect anything nightmarish.  

I was impressed with the bathroom decor.  It had a mediterranean theme and gave me ideas to spruce up my own bathroom.  I was also impressed with the free wifi and flat panel television, but I guess that's becoming more standard in the Vegas area.

I found this deal through slickdeals.com, and they were having a FREE room special. Except they needed to charge you this $15 random fee. Either ways it was no loss to me, $15 is still cheaper then the next cheapest room which is IP at around $30. And I am NEVER staying there again.

Oh get this, once you walk in the front door you can check IN! How about that? Most casinos make you go through tons of mazes since you are not valeting through the actual front entrance. So I was able to check in quickly with my ""free special"". Didn't get any complaints or weird looks from the receptionist at all. They even gave me 4 keys for our 3rd illegal immigrant roommate as well. 

Getting to our actual room was a breeze. Elevators are next to receptionists that are next to the parking area. This makes for the perfect crash room! Now we gotta inspect the actual room itself. We didn't make any special requests, so they put us in this 5th floor room. We opened the door and we were amazed that they had some pretty sweet renovated decor. Flat screen TV! That is a luxury now days at crash rooms. The bathroom tiles were all nicely done with a glass shower. Everything you can imagine in a 4 star joint is here except for the dual sink, and bathroom TV.  I even asked for extra towels and they brought it up within 20 minutes. I had issues getting room service like that at the freaking ENCORE. Later on that day they followed up with a phone call to make sure I got my extra towels as well. How sweet!

I really having nothing but nice things to say about this place. I will definitely go out of my way to book  here for a crash room whenever I can. Just like their promo, they do really LOVE their locals. Even if I am only a honorary local for now.",nTcMFBHZV2vPnig0XLk-Hw,1,2,4,kqX0HvtSRozV83Oce7sgCA

3878215,2007-10-23,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"There are two types of rooms at the Palace Station Hotel - tower rooms and courtyard rooms. The difference between these two rooms are like night and day. Trust me, you DON'T want a courtyard room.

I was here for a convention/conference a while back and, seeing I was cheap, I booked a room in the courtyard. Ehhh...bad decision. Lemme just put it this way - when you walk from the main hotel/casino to the courtyard area, you walk outside for a brief moment to cross over into the courtyard. In the hotel, you have nice automatic sliding doors and elevators, once you get into the courtyard, you have to open doors yourself and take the stairs. Doesn't sound like a huge difference but it is. I mean, think about it...when was the last time you went to a hotel that DIDN'T have automatic sliding doors?

The rooms weren't that nice either, once you get inside, it reminds me of a Holiday Inn or Motel 6. Average but livable.

The tower rooms, which I had the opportunity to see later, are much nicer. Actually, much nicer is an understatement - you're actually getting a room that makes you think you're in Las Vegas. You get a larger room to begin with, nicer sheets, a flat screen TV, a cleaner bathroom - everything's just nicer. I think they recently remodeled all the tower rooms, which explains why the drastic difference in decor.

Therefore, if you HAVE to stay here (because I don't see why you would stay here under your own free will if you have so many other options in Vegas), pay the extra twenty bucks and bump yourself up to the tower. It's just not worth it stay in the courtyard...",wGEWMqOxZb2hHg6WACmEQQ,2,0,2,gHgxZnP67nPHvmWPDQ_mBw

On our last trip, I called ahead the day we were to arrive and said we will be checking in after midnight but we were still on our way, they said that they will note it on our reservation and hold the room for us. When we arrived the very unfriendly man at the receptionist desk said that the room was not clean and it will be about a 10 minute wait till we can get our room. Mind you it's about 12:40PM and we had just spent the last 6 hours driving in.... not really what I wanted to hear. He wasn't even apologetic about it. So I asked since we were inconvenienced can we get 2 free breakfast buffet coupons. He said I have to check, he went over and asked what I assume to be another reception desk worker, then came back and told me no. I asked well can you at least wave one of the resort fees, ($12.99 per day for Vegas Strip shuttle, pool usage, and Wifi conventions charge, even though its $5.99 to use the WiFi in your room per day)I told him I wasn't even going to use any of those things. He said no. I asked can I at least have an extended check out.... He said the latest he could do was 1:00 pm. Not great customer service. 
Once day I needed a quick bite well getting ready so I went down to the ""Food Court"", umm 2 places to get some fast food does not make a ""Food Court"" in my eyes.... It was a Fast food Johnny Rockets and some already made Pizza place. I opted for a slice of pizza, a $7.00 slice of pizza. It was ok, but not $7.00 ok.... The guy who help me there wasn't all that friendly either, and said maybe all of 2 words to me.... ""Can I help you"" Ok my bad he said all of 4 words to me. 
The rooms was ok, but the bathroom could use some touch up... the wallpaper had finger print smudges all over it... the towels look stained, and the hand show they leave for you smelled gross. 
And the last Icing on the cake was at 7:30 am on our check out day..... The cleaning crew was outside our door having a very loud and long conversation.... I had to call the front desk and complained, it was insane, I couldn't even go back to sleep! I don't plan on coming back here again. 
This review was for a Tower Room, the Court Yard rooms are much older, much more in need of a good deep cleaning and they also don't have any elevators in the Court Yard rooms, so make sure to travel light if you're on the second floor.

Not sure where to begin with my thoughts about our unfortunately terrible experience at this casino. It was the biggest waste of money in my opinion, sadly I didn't have many choices when it came to booking at this hotel, as this was my last resort in choices and I can now see why it sits low on the list for everyone else. The Staff was rude and unfriendly to deal with the whole time. The elevators were a joke! the system they have worked out sucks! They have the room keys fixed to your floor where you are staying.YOU MUST SWIPE The keys in order to get off on your floor, the keys never work! We rode up and down the elevators with many other upset guests timelessly trying to get the doors to possibly let us out anywhere! At one point a hotel employee got on the elevators with us and I said to him ""What is the magic trick to get these elevators to work?"" He said back ""We have had work orders put in for weeks, and no one seems to care."" The hotel pool was closed for ""remodeling"" and this WAS NOT stated on their website, nor was it stated over the phone! I would have not chose to stay at this hotel had I known they did not have a pool. Every ICE machine was out of order on every floor! In order to get ice you had to go to the bar in the casino and beg for tiny cups of ice from the bartender, he was not happy and I felt inclined to tip him every time! Further more, had there been any ice on any other floor I would have had to use the stairs to get to the ice, since the elevators didn't let you off on any floor at all, let alone your own floor assigned to the room where you were staying! Unless you want to WASTE all your time and money worrying about how to get to your assigned room, dealing with rude employees, and no ice, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND OR MONEY AT THE PALACE STATION AND CASINO",aEXn-PQ-y-svP568kM3kGA,0,0,1,EGSfDjgGqiNJxoMt41q4zg

It was like there was a plate of oysters in front of us and they looked odd and tasted even worse.  The consistency was off. I asked the helped (Not a shucker because that process didn't seem to happen)what kind of oysters they were and where they were from?  She said GOLD BAND!.  I notice all the oysters on ice had a Gold rubber Band holding the shell halts tightly together. The helper said, ""They are from Louisiana."" I quickly looked it up on my cell phone as when I was in NOLA for Mardi Gras and took a drive outside of town on the way to Baton Rouge I had not encounter any such horrible shell fish.  
GOLD BAND Oysters: Preshucked and are Pasteurized.  GROSS!

Quick valet and bell service, quick and friendly front desk and check in!! The lobby is very clean new and cozy and has a Starbucks! 
The location of this hotel is pretty ideal. It is perfectly situated in between Las Vegas blvd. (the strip) and Fremont street in downtown Vegas. Using uber/lyft rides to both were between $6-$9.
Our reservation was originally for a courtyard room, we were unaware that these are the low budget motel style rooms. This should be explained better in the room description. The courtyard rooms are not in the main tower of the hotel, they are somewhere in the back in a 2 story motel style type of building. The hallways were unmarked and we could not find our room. When we found our room it was in a back corner facing a wall 1 foot away. Very dark and low and had a stench and wrecked of marijuana. My boyfriend and I were very disappointed with ours room and immediately called for an upgrade which we were charged $20 a night for. 
The upgrade was well worth it. We got a room in the main tower. The main tower is a huge upgrade from the courtyard rooms! It was very refreshing to be in such a nice resort style room. Comfortable beds and pillows, nice TV, amazing views, and big counter in he bathroom! All the hotel staff was very friendly  including the front desk, bell boys, valet, housekeeping, telephone operators, casino hosts and dealers! Absolutely loved the 24hours I spend at this hotel and wish I could stay longer! 
The casino was amazing! It was so nice to be able to go downstairs from my cozy room to this casino. The dealers were all very friendly and I had great luck! The oyster bar and steak house are spectacular and there is a cheap buffet and 24 hour cafe. Mexican cantina and a couple bars which serve $0.99 margaritas! Can't go wrong!

The room was very nice and the maids cleaned it very well. The room didn't have ESPN or HBO like the other hotels so that was also a bummer.

Nothing against the restaurants and to be fair I will rate them separately, but dear god the service at the hotel belongs out of state not in Las Vegas Nevada, what a disappointment.

I really, really regret having booked this location given all the hotel properties in Las Vegas. I called to complain and tried to get resolution. The manager Lana that I spoke to said she would investigate the issues we had and call me back, she never did despite 2 follow up phone calls. Let me explain how the staff at palace station cost my local business in Las Vegas $700.00. I booked the room for a contractor near a construction site where we were working. My contractor was coming in late, so I went early to check him into the hotel and ensure he got the room we reserved. When he arrived at 3 AM they accidentally put him into an occupied room, fortunately the occupants were not there and my contractor is an honest man and did not take any belongings from that room. He went back to the lobby explained what happened they checked his ID again and placed him in another room. He was exhausted and only after 30 minutes of being in the ""new room"" he was woken up by a phone call by the front desk and asked to confirm his name, he thought  it was odd but then tried to go back to sleep. About 15 minutes later another phone call came in stating he needed to VACATE THE ROOM ASAP. He refused, explained it was late needed to sleep and the hotel front desk said we would be charged the room fee for staying there. They asked again to confirm his name over and over. He explained he wasn't moving to a 3rd room in less than 2 hours of arrival. Our contractor also explained that he was tired and had to be at work in a couple of hours and needed to sleep to function since he had to operate heavy machinery. The hotel kept asking how soon he could come back down to the lobby, he said by 7. By this our contractor was really upset and only slept 45 minutes, when he went back down no one knew what he was talking about the person that had called harassing him from the front desk was on break. He waited 30 minutes and called to tell us he would not be able to make it to work on time because he had not slept. At about 745 AM he was put into the ""correct room"" that we had originally checked him into. He finally got to sleep and showed up to work at noon. Since our work was time sensitive another company started the work and invoiced us $700.00, so we had to pay them on top of our contractor. Had he been allowed to sleep he would have arrived at work on time and we would not have had to resort to getting additional help. The thing that upsets me the most is that there is no apology or acceptance of some accountability from the hotel. When I called I was calm provided just the facts I was promised a call back instead we have been ignored and brushed off, so my plan is to invoice the hotel for our loss.",YuwCrRziSKR7KSUCH0EM_w,5,1,1,uCDXWdMmF_Pq3lL3fci9wA

Pros:
-Close to the strip
-Station Casino:  I have room, food, and play comps at Station Casinos. 
-Parking
-Family:  My parents stay here a lot and love it.  
-Sports Book:  Only reason why I was here.


Cons:
-Old and Aged
-Smells:  Place literally smells like an ash tray
-Small

Palace Station definitely needs a remodel.  Compared to most hotels on the strip, this place is less than average.  However, my parents love this place.  When they come up to visit me, this sometimes stay here.  They claim that this is one of the best casinos near the strip to win out.  I wouldn't know since I don't play slots.  As long as their happy, then I'm happy.  But for me, Palace Station just isn't for me.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,0,0,3,zUZvHc_vYIBZ2WZ6Mf8nwA

Can't complain too much about it.  The service was good, my room and bathroom were clean, and there was shuttling to and from the strip (if you don't mind walking a bit of distance... it only goes to the mall on the Stratosphere end of the strip) and to and from the airport. All my needs were met, thus I was content. Overall, decent hotel at a very good price (especially for such an expensive place like Vegas).",crvWTyAQTAj0WtuDrBCy1A,0,1,3,EklIsxFWls7-1e7hxegrwg

Palace is well maintained and clean. The selection of machines is decent, and it wasn't crowded. We played a bit of video poker (LOTS of VP machines here) and some Goldfish, which was very generous to us (of course, never guaranteed).

The valet staff was courteous and quick as well - yes, we valet everywhere, as parking and walking cuts into our valuable gambling time! Drink service was also decent; all too often you sit and sit and never see a cocktail waitress. Not the case here for us, and my Bloody Mary was decent and spicy.

4117235,2014-01-02,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"Reading a few of the reviews makes me think. Lack of planning on one's part should not translate to a bad rating on a hotel. 
...Hardly ever having played at the P/S, we received postcard for free nights. Figured we'd take a chance, and get some free nights booked. We travel to Vegas for Biz quite often, so why not stay for free (and save the time share points).
We were expecting nothing special. Check in was easy, Bell man service was excellent, Valet super simple. The first time we stayed we were bumped up to the Suite in the tower. Walking down the hall we were preparing ourselves for a good laugh. When we walked in the room, it was amazingly nice (compared to expectations). They bumped us to the best room (I have literally gambled less than $100. in the P/S), without asking. Clean, newish, very nice. Wasn't Pallazo, but wasn't $250 a night either. 
As of this writing, we have stayed a total of 12 nights, and have paid $39.00 total (added on an extra night we had to pay for) including all taxes. Some stay were 100% zero cost. October, November, & December are great times in Vegas since it is very quiet and the hotels want your biz.
Restaurants: Mexican Food, Fairly Standard, 7~10, Italian 4~10 (pretty cheap and nice setting, but not real great taste! Maybe their pizza is better??) Cafe for Breakfast is usually decent 7~10.  Didn't do the Oyster bar but it's packed out ALL the time, so must be good. There is a Subway and Johnny Rockets (got a 1/2 price shake with the player card!) .
Bottom Line  - Stay in the tower!!! Don't expect opulence, but clean should be expected. Bring an extra towel for yourself, they only give you two, and aren't real accommodating on extras. Have your cute wife there when you check in so you can schmooze the dude to get a room upgrade.",aXswCETaz8PS0fELd_gmkA,0,0,4,jhGuYaUuMpJKxurwUMzFdw

Then, we walk over to our room, and ""Omigosh!"" I felt like I was transported back to the crappy dorms I had to live in not so long ago! The walls were paper thin, so we could hear our neighbors. The shower area was so tiny that if you turned around you'd pretty much touch the walls (and I am not a very big person). There was NO tub in this room so the edges of the shower area where not enough to hold water while showering.

4171568,2011-05-03,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"There were many mixed reviews on Palace Station. We were hesitant to book there because it was off the strip, but gosh the price was right.

We were upgraded to a tower room upon arrival which was lovely. People complain a lot about the resort fees, but seriously, if you book through a travel website, it tells you these things. Read the fine print and don't whine about stuff.

Our room was spacious and contemporary. The tv was a nice size flat panel tv which swiveled.  The beds were decent and the bathroom was nice and spacious. They also have the nice shower curtain that bows out.

We received excellent service and the Grand Cafe downstairs and ate three meals there because of it. The prices on food are decent and they even serve Naked brand oj. The dessert case outside of the cafe has excellent price on some delicious treats. The NY cheese cake was to due for and only $2.50 a (huge) slice!

The buffet we only ate once, for breakfast. It was decent. They did have a ham carving station and an omelet station. The bananas we got were sort of gross, but you can't win them all. Fat free frozen yogurt and hot fudge for the win though.

The casino was alright. We aren't big on gambling though. I played slots for a few hours and was neither under or over whelmed. It seems targeted more towards locals and the older crowd, but we didn't mind. We're in our late 20's but not big on the partying hard scene anyway. 

Our room was always neatly cleaned and towels and toiletries were always replenished. None of our personal item were moved around and the room smelled nice  and was comfortable and clean.

The shuttle conveniently takes you to the strip and airport, just get there early because it leaves RIGHT on time. They show up 10minutes before the pick up time, load and then go right at the pick up time.

Overall, out stay was really good. We enjoyed the room, the workout room, pool, restaurants and casino. It was a nice stay.

I think it's kinda rip off, since they know most people coming are just using the room to shower and sleep, most of the time visitors are out on the strip seeing the city not spending time on internet,swimming pool or gym, otherwise they'll stay home.

Then room are look a like clean, vents are dusty, conditions of curtain are dirty, and dusty, just because they look nice from far, but when touching them to open curtain, then your hands get the dust.

It is more of a locals hang out.  It has it's up's and downs like any place.  But overall, as long as you stay in the Tower, the rooms are decent for the price & the place is nice.  It's not a huge casino, so you don't end up lost for hours trying to find your bank of elevators.  The food is good and decently priced.  The table dealers are all friendly and talkative, unlike those on the strip.  The smoking can be out of control but it's that way in most casino's.  Jack's Irish Pub is a great place to just go and hang out when you've had enough of the casino itself.  

When I lived in Vegas, this is where I played.  Now when I visit, this is where I stay.   The only downside is that you do have to either rent a car or taxi if you want to leave.

4190736,2014-07-17,7,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"Over the weekend, my boyfriend had taken me here. He stayed at the towers before which he described as ""not bad."" I've been coming to Vegas almost every year since I was about 4 years old. I've stayed from crappy places, to the much nicer hotels. To hear him say ""not bad"" made me feel a bit better. That man has standards (which I question now - read on). 

Upon arriving, we did valet (which is why I gave them two stars really, otherwise it would have been one - the second star was for the laughs we've had), and checked in. Surprise, surprise! We were located at the courtyard. No idea what the tower rooms look like, but the courtyard reminded me of motel 6, but a bit dirtier? 

My routine when I am in a new room is to check the bathroom(s), and then the view. I feel like almost everything in the bathroom was trying to hurt me. The floor was slippery when I first walked in. The shower curtains always touches you. If you had the curtains outside the shower border, be prepared to walk in a flood. Our shower head was loose. The pipes didn't stay in place. It was horrible. When you turn off the water, you have to stand here for a bit while a stream of water falls on you. I was conflicted really; do I waddle through a puddle first, or delay the inevitable and have the shower spit the last remaining water for a minute (all the while the curtain is trying to molest you). 

The view? Made me feel like I was at an apartment complex. There was literally nothing to see, unless you want to stare out to windows where people are staring out doing the same thing. There's also a sidewalk to stare at if you're into that. Me? Not so much. 

The room.. The room is smaller than my bedroom, and I don't live in a big house. The carpet was dirty. There was a stain on the ceiling, from what looks like a water leak. The TV looked like it was made in the early 90s. A bit of nostalgia really. The bed was so springy. I'm a light sleeper, so everytime my boyfriend moved, I woke up. 

I'm not much of a gambler, and I must say that the casino isn't really all that much to look at. Majority of the people there were rocking Hawaiian shirts, cargo shorts, and fanny packs (epitome of tourists?). 

The buffet. I'm not much of a buffet person, mainly because I feel like that they have to lower the quality of ingredients to compensate for the price. Well, for $8 a person, you get what you pay for. The only thing that I really liked there were tater tots, which I'm sure were frozen. When fried, they're delicious either way (unless they're expired but I digress). 

Yea. We couldn't take it, my boyfriend booked for two nights, but we only stayed for one. Ended up going to the Palms the next night. 

Literally the only thing that made the whole experience better was being with my boyfriend... because we were complaining together.",0_iMi0rQcwNLEu_eP3gQhQ,8,3,2,qDp8ht41q2xDYuiXwyPVhQ

I did however swipe my players card for some promotion they were having and was given a $20 food certificate and $20 slot play. So I went and lost my free slot money quickly and then I decided against my better judgement & previous experience to give the cafe another chance to redeeem themselves.

This time it was $20 I wanted to spend so I thought I would keep it simple. 2 hamburgers & fries. NO COKE-Just Pepsi-1 point.

Well it took quite awhile for the food to come out & the service was dismal but nothing tops the burgers.

No kidding I have had 10x better @ AM/PM. They actually had the consistency & taste of a Hungry Man TV Dinner burger with the whole fake charbroil flavoring to boot.

Would I stay again? No. After you walk through the large hotel that doesn't seem too bad, you walk back outside to the ""courtyard"" rooms. Sounds nice, right? Nope. It feels like you're walking out of the real hotel and walking into the motel behind it. Rooms just seem very run down, a little dirty, carpets stained, etc. The beds seemed clean, which is what led us to stay, but I didn't want the kids to even take their socks off or play on the ground at all.

Attention Management,
My Name is Belinda Dur I stayed at your facility on April 12th- April 13th
On the night of April 12th my significant other and I were playing on one of the crap table for about 2-3 hours starting around 3am-6:15am leading into Friday the 13th. During our game play we played side by side until the end of our game play hour in which my spouse switched to the other end of the table since I was rolling the dice and he wanted to see better, as this as happening my spouse was telling me to add money to my bet and at this point the pit boss ( big samoan guy) named Joe told him not to tell me how to bet my money. My Spouse then told Joe not to tell him how to speak to me as I was his woman and not his. At this point Joe made a smart remark and said well ""I AM TELLING YOU HOW TO TALK TO HER AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?"" My spouse got upset and told him again you don't tell me how to talk to MY WOMAN , GO HOME AND TALK TO YOUR WOMAN. I guess Joe the pit boss took offense to my spouses comment because he then told the dealer to take his bets off the table and that my souse was done for the night. My spouse then came back to my side of the table and told the dealer if my money isn't good here than neither is hers so take her bets off the table too. Dealer and Joe the pit boss said no that they won't take my bets off unless I say so, at this point I wanted to leave because this was no longer fun for me and so I said take my money off. Then for some reason Joe felt compelled to say to my spouse that they could go ""Head Up"" as in step outside for a fight. Now in all my life and 21 years of being a manager myself, I have never experienced a situation where an employee has called out and threatened a patron. Of course as a man my spouse was not going to take lightly to this challenge so he accepted the challenge. Luckily at this point there was a female pit boss on the floor who heard everything and she came over pulled my spouse and I to the side and agreed to call Mr. Shelton the floor manager. Mr. Shelton came over but as soon as I started to speak to him to explain what happened I decided to cut that conversation short because I felt he was being condescending so I told him, I will reach out to corporate. By this time 7 security guards were surrounding us like we were criminals and asking us to leave the floor and return to our room, however my spouse was so upset he still wanted to speak to more managers so he wouldn't leave the floor finally one of the security guards was able to get him called down enough to leave the floor and he walked us up to our room. I did write an incident report and turned it into the front desk at check out but I'm sure it was probably discarded so I am writing a formal complaint against the PIT BOSS JOE and MR SHELTON or His name may be MR SHERATON. I HAVE PATRONED YOUR FACILITY MANY TIMES AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND ITS DISHEARTENING TO KNOW I AM NOT GOING TO COME BACK BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT!! PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS SITUATION!

I would like to be contacted by corporate management

First off, we originally planned to arrive in LV, gamble and have fun until saturday morning for an early checkin.  However, all of us were tired 2am and needed some rest so we asked for a room and got one for free.  One of the hosts gave us a ""SUITE"" in one of the courtyard rooms and we were pretty happy.  We went through a maze trying to find our room and finally after 15 minutes found it hidden in the very back of the hall way.  When we entered the room.... all we could say was ""WTF.""  How the hell can Palace station call this piece of sh*t a suite?!?!?  This room was so crappy that we almost didnt want to stay here.  It looked like a place where people get robbed or murdered.  The walls were white with graining texture, no wallpapers!  The carpet stained and the couch they had a blood stain!!!  In the bed room, there was a nice king bed however and it was really comfortable.  The bathroom was super tiny and the shower drain was broken with a piece of metal sticking up.  I actually stepped on it and was scared I would catch something....sick!  Other for the bed, the room was a dump.  After waking up and tryign to get the hell out of dodge, I gambled at their baccarat filled pit.

Palace station is known to the locals for their baccarat at low limits and plentiful table selection.  With about 10 tables, it is one, if not the biggest casino having this game.  They have mini and midi baccarat and spread limits from $5 up $100 minimum.  They also have fortune bonus and all those other sucker bets.  I had fun sweating the cards, bending them , and abusing them like no other, good times!

On the second night, we checked into a tower room and was satisfied at its quality for the price.  nice beds, clean bathroom, and WALLPAPER!  The TV is 14inches at most, but good enough.  I give this hotel 3 stars for their beds, casino, and friendly staff minus this piece of shit dealer who commented on why I shuffle chips.  PIt bosses are friendly and remember your name.  They gave us many meals and we will be back in the future to gamble ONLY.

Update: March 2008 
So I stayed here again... why?  I found a rate for $40 on a friday night when the strip was asking for $200+  Anyways, the Tower rooms are now all renonvated and are actually very nice.  Big Plasma TV, nice comfy beds, a nice wood desk, in-room safe and lots of drawers.  The bathroom is also nicely re-done and has two sinks, one outside and one inside a smaller room with a shower/toilet/sink combination.  Palace has really improved itself in the hotel aspect.

After a long flight from Boston, MA on December 22, 2014, I am exhausted and just wanting a bath and a bed.  They do have a shuttle from the airport to the hotel.  When we finally arrive at the hotel, I'm not to pleasant with how it looks from the outside, but I'm so tired that I didn't even care.  My boyfriend goes to check in and the lady was nice at the front desk, she even goes as far as to tell us that she is giving us an ""upgraded"" room.  I say to myself ""wow"" and we thank her.

So she gives us our key and as she is giving us the directions on how to get to our room, I think to myself ""that is so weird"" but we proceed.  The directions basically take us to the back of the hotel, and these rooms are located in an area called ""the courtyard"" as we enter the hallway of the SEPARATE building, we are immediately slapped in the face with such a disgusting odor.  Old carpet, old smoke smell, old doors, etc.  My boyfriend and I are mortified!  When we finally enter the room, I thought I was entering the 1970's!!!!  It was old and disgusting!  My boyfriend and I look at each other and we're like ""THIS IS AN UPGRADE!?""  

My boyfriend immediately calls the front desk and tells them that we cannot stay in that room!  When we booked it online, the pictures were completely different.  They told us that they have newer rooms, but in the tower and it would be $20 additional per night.  At this point I'm dying of exhaustion and I tell my boyfriend, lets just do it and deal with this in the morning.  We went to the front desk once again and told them that the pictures they have online are completely deceiving.  We booked our hotel through expedia and the hotel told us that that is expedia's fault and they are the ones that post the pictures.  They were not apologetic at all.

My boyfriend calls expedia the next morning and explain to them the situation.  Expedia is soooo apologetic.  Not only did they reimburse us for the whole stay, they gave us $50 credit towards our next purchase.  We left after 2 days at this hotel and went to ""Treasure Island"" on the strip.

I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!  The rooms in the tower are decent, but what they have advertise on their website is wrong!  They should let people know that 'the courtyard' are old rooms and thats why it's so cheap.  This place should be shut down!  My first night in Vegas and thanks to them, it was not a pleasant one!

Surprisingly enough the Courtyard rooms are actually nice and clean, a bit small but we did not spend much time in the room; just to sleep. What is a bit harsh is the cigarette smell, you can smell that stench pretty strong here.

I do think my room was haunted by an eery presence. But if you don't let those types of thinks scare you, you should be fine. 

The Buffet is pretty good and affordable, but they close kinda early for being a casino buffet. Brunch on Sunday's are good. The staff seems to be nice although I didn't have a lot of interaction with them.

Palace station is off the strip. if you want to go to the strip or palace station, you will have to catch their shuttle, if not a taxi or Uber. I recommend Uber because it's a lot cheaper than a taxi. 

Overall, I had a good time here, but if you're a parties I wouldn't stay here, I would stay at Fremont street or the strip. If you want to get away from the noise and relax I would stay here again. Plus, you get a good price here.",uFLmw655-xXeVmOso_8Phg,3,0,3,7nKlPhsqEsp2paCINE8EeA

Hotel: We booked a room using Priceline. It was one of the cheapest prices that was closed to the strip. The total came out to almost $200 for two nights. From the outside, it looked really nice. Once we checked in, they directed us to this dingy two story building. Inside was badly lit and looked like a murder scene out of C.S.I.

Casino: Most of the dealers barely spoke any English and didn't know the rules of the game/bonuses they were dealing. They constantly took my money whether I won or lost, I had to keep an eye on my chips every second to make sure I was paid right. The dealers gave me an attitude when I spoke up and the pit bosses didn't care. One of them did promise to comp my friend two buffets for playing and one for myself for being a new card holder.

Food: There was a tasty looking oyster bar, but the line was huge and we already had buffet comps. Once we got to the buffet, turns out the pit boss didn't comp my friend anything and they had to pay 9.99 each. We were told to ask the pit boss that comped us, but they were long gone. Everything in the buffet was dry and tasteless. The fruit/salad bar had a gray dull look to it that tells it has been sitting for a long time.

4946464,2009-12-31,5,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"Before you guys question why the hell am I eating buffet at Palace Station, let me preface by saying that I do not like buffets! Those of you who know me know I would not choose to eat buffet. However, when your child tells you that he would really like to have breakfast buffet before we leave Vegas, you try to comply. 

So it was 10am and I called around to see which places were still serving breakfast buffet. I wasn't gonna go to the Bellagio because I only eat a few items and it's hardly worth it for me to spend $20-$30 bucks to eat bacon, sausage, peel and eat shrimp and maybe 2 pieces of toast.

I was told that this place was serving brunch and even as we were driving there, I'm hearing 'I had dinner buffet here once when I was wasted and I thought it sucked"". Everything in my body should've told me to STOP and not go there, but, we went anyway.

The brunch buffet on weekends is $10.99 for adults and $8.99 for kids between 4 and 10 years of age. If you get their players card it's $2 less, so that's what I did. I went to get the players card and we ended up paying $8.99/adult and $6.99/kid.

I wasn't hopeful at all. In fact, I had such low expectations that I was actually pleasantly surprised! The buffet was clean and laid out spaciously. The place just looked neat and tidy (unlike the Orleans' French Market Buffet which I now have to knock down a star after coming here).

The sausages were very tasty (unlike those at Orleans) and the bacon cooked perfectly. The young man and I started with that. They have an egg station where omelettes and fried eggs are cooked to order. When I ventured further, I was really happy to see that they had peel and eat shrimp as well and they were far better (fresher!) than that at the Orleans. The cocktail sauce here was also a hell lot tastier!

I ended up trying the bratwurst with sauerkraut -- really good even though it didn't look as good as it tasted. I even tried the menudo -- bleh, tasted like water, no flavor at all. I liked that they had both grits and cream of wheat although the grits were too clumpy and thick to my taste. 

There was a ham carving station, Mexican food comprising of beans, rice, tortillas, toppings (killer spicy grilled jalapenos), hash browns were nicely cooked -- crunchy on top and soft under. The food was regularly replaced so it didn't have that messed up look about them. That is my biggest issue with buffets, when the trays of food look like they'd been tampered with. 

I was highly impressed that they lifted out the trays of food, cleaned out the sides and replaced the trays -- and did this often enough so everything looked really clean.

By the time we were done, they were firing up the grill for hamburgers, which were made to order! Too bad we were too full to try one. They also had desserts and ice cream, but no, I didn't try any of that either.

The weekend brunch also offers you champagne, but I'd be a bit wary drinking champagne at a brunch that costs you less than $10. However, if you're like me and don't really dig the myriad items they lay out at high end buffets, then perhaps, this is the right place for you! I know that next time, I will not raise my nose in the air and look down upon these cheap buffets because this one really exceeded my expectations. But then again, considering the only foods I eat at buffets, maybe it's not really having expectations at all!

For the price, I thought it was pretty damn good! And don't get upset with me for giving them 4 stars. I'm not comparing this place to your high-end buffets! In its own class of buffets, I'd say this is pretty good! Far better than the Orleans buffet lunch which was $7.50 -- but their shrimp wasn't as fresh and their cocktail sauce nowhere near as good as the one at Palace Station!",nzsv-p1O8gCfP3XijfQrIw,10,10,4,Sjvy-vazcUss668NXQuIfg

I had no idea where or when I would stop, but found my self exiting I15 at Sahara, a last second decision, to lay down at one of my old haunts; Palace Station.  I called on the phone as soon as I pulled into the parking lot to make sure they had rooms left for the day and walked up to the front desk without a reservation. I checked into a tower room within twenty-five minutes.

Unfortunately, I was saddened to find out that Palace Station has lost its mojo; it is not the same place I used to stay and play at, regularly, since the tower first opened in the early '90's through my last stay a couple of years ago.

I need not go into the multiple issues I had with the hotel or my ""Tower"" room, but hitting the four most annoying highlights:

1.  Safe was locked and had no power.
2.  The lavatory (bathroom sink) had a strong sewer(ish) odor coming out of it that literally made the bathroom stink.
3.  WIFI was down.
4. The shower head barely allowed a thin spray of water that made bathing a time consuming, tedious effort.

I made multiple attempts to notify the front desk by way of the room phone and using the ""Front Desk"" button, but instead of going to the front desk, the calls went to the hotel operator automated answering system that put me on hold for several minutes.  OK.  I tried several other service buttons on the phone to try to get a live person; but same thing:  The calls went to the hotel operator automated answering system.

My girlfriend had a job interview at Palace Station, so I thought I would kill time in the arcade while she was doing her thing. And I learned an important lesson:

This place DOES NOT CARE FOR THEIR ARCADE MACHINES.

I popped two tokens in the Police Trainer machine. Ate my tokens.

I went to play House of the Dead. Gun aiming was horribly off-center (and I'm a shooter in real-life so this can't be attributed to my own incompetence.)

I went to play Star Wars Trilogy. THE JOYSTICK WAS BROKEN, with the cursor stuck at the right side of the screen. 

And then I went to play the crane machine. The controls were sluggish and hardly responsive at all. 

Not to mention every game had a TWO token cost, with the exception of a few that cost a little more. The arcade is only about a quarter the size of those at other Station Casinos. Granted, it's a ""nice"" area, but there are so few games to choose from, and what little there is doesn't work right. 

Save your money before you play any of the games in here. If you're 21 or older, just go stick it in a slot machine. It's a gamble whether or not any machine in here will even work right!

Every place on the strip, due to the weekend of course, was over $150, and that was for Circus Circus! We came across Palace Station and they had a special 24 hour promo going on. We booked a night and received a free luxury room tower upgrade for only $79! We got a room on the 18th floor, almost to the top, and had a great view of the city below. The tower was recently renovated and it was like a brand new hotel inside. Our room had 2 queen beds with clean, soft linens (not the scratchy kind), new carpeting, a bathroom with marble counters, a new tile floor and a large shower. I couldn't believe we got these accommodations for less then what I've paid in the past for a lousy motel off the strip. I've stayed in many hotels in Vegas in the past, and to have this room compare to Caesar's or MGM at a price that is almost 50-70% off is crazy. The staff at check in were friendly and apologized for the small wait we had. Parking is convenient and the casino is filled with the locals. This hotel is located across the FWY from the strip, so it doesn't take more than a 1-2 min drive to get to the action. What a steal!

MUCH bigger on the inside than it appears.  My room was literally half a mile from the front entrance (mistake bringing heels to this place) and of COURSE I had to pass through the casino to get there.  My wallet fell victim every time.  

Props to the nice Elvis guy that I saw lurking about for a few days.  I'm sorry to say that you looked nothing like him, but you get an A for effort none-the-less.

So the room; opened the curtains to find I had a gorgeous view offfffffffffffffffffffffffff (I know, the suspense must be killing you): the street.

The shower had no bathtub (shriek) and the bathroom light made this awful screeching noise...it was endearing.  

They also had a free shuttle to the strip where I spent many a night spending gobs of money on gambling, booze, smokes, and waltzing into the hotels to take pictures and shop for overpriced trinkets.  The driver was nice enough to drive me back to the airport so that I wouldn't have to spend $30 on the cab to take me a mile and a half.  

For the four days I was out there, I induldged in a life of grandeur and excess...who am I kidding, I still do.

You can sleep here, eat here, shower here, do your business here, etc.  But there is no 'ooh ahhs' that come along with it at all. We stayed here three nights over MDW. We were in the courtyard rooms. As we got lost after becoming a victim to the wind tunnel that was the open alley in between the hotel and the courtyard rooms, we found ourselves wandering the floors looking for our rooms. And we realized that there was no elevator so I grunted at the thought of carrying one of my bags up the stairs. A bell man offered to help me but as soon as I reached the top, I said thank you, not needing his services. Apparently, no handicap people stay on the second floor of the courtyard.

We finally found our room after being in a maze and stepped into a room with two full/queen size beds, a desk, tv that swivels, a window, AC and bathroom with a single shower and a shower curtain. The bed closest to the door was not comfortable at all. Springs would pop right back up with authority as you moved. The other bed was much more manageable. We needed to then take a nap and realized there wasn't a comforter on the bed or in the stand alone closet. I think I was asleep for 20 minutes before a blanket was brought up. They said there is a blanket in between the sheets. It was as thin as could be. No fluff here!

At night the walls are so thin that you can hear obnoxious people arguing, which I'd prefer over the joyous screams of one of Vegas' so-called hourly finest. The blow dryer didn't work after resetting it and replugging it. And to top it off, there is a mandatory $16/night charge for their amenities. Which the hubby said it wasn't disclosed to him or his buddies that were also staying there. I did use their gym for one day. It had treadmills, stair climbers, bikes, one bench and dumbells. I eventually found the side entrance to the courtyard to avoid the wind tunnel and I got to my room quicker. But the sign on the outside that says you need to have your key to enter was false. Anyone can come in thru that door. Yay, safety! But I didn't find any bugs or anything incredibly disgusting in the room, so I'm thankful for that.

I did want to try the oyster bar but I chose to spend my money elsewhere in terms of consumables. Like I said, the Palace Station served its purpose.",HPJY5cQ7Za6Hi07eB3gvZA,0,0,3,PJK0xSShtp341Jgck7jepg

I am not one to take take the time out of my day to write a bad review, but this was such a horrific experience, I had to warn others. Please don't make the same mistake I did! This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel- and I have traveled to developing countries with no running water where I was not sure if someone would break into my room in the middle of the night (which is also very possible in this hotel).

I honestly don't know where to start. Simply checking into the hotel was a horrific experience. There are too many disturbing details about my stay to even write about. Awful costumer service is one thing, but the filth and grime of the rooms is enough to make vermin run in disgust.  

When I complained about my horrible experience to the front desk, the hotel manager Brandon (he was so proud to declare himself as the hotel manager-- so odd) was not even remotely phased by any of my complaints. In fact, he blamed outside venders for the problems. Unreal. Who hires the outside venders/contractors and does not take responsibility over that choice? As a business, you are responsible for everything that goes on. 

He basically said I would have to take my issues up with them.... He even went so far as to give me the vendor company name that he felt was at fault for one of my complaints. Why should I call and complain to them? It blows my mind how certain companies are even still in business with that kind of mentality. I guess idiots like me who stay at places without doing proper research keep this crap shoots in business ;-)

I have taken photos to post and will also write another longer post about my experience on my blog. If you have any questions, please contact me directly. Do not stay here. There are plenty of places that are cheaper and not as repulsive. 

Honestly, so disgusting. I hope I save one person from the insane misery I endured during my stay at that complete dump disguised as a hotel. You would be better off sleeping on the street. Seriously. 

Vegas, even for work, should not be such a crappy experience. Hope anyone who reads this review doesn't make the same mistake!",RqsdycKiZIVaIeTQv9xrzw,15,1,1,cgN1rKM-1bd0xHGiEh_Jjg

I did read a recent review that they've updated their rooms though, so you go, Glen Coco!

Interior:
It's kind of what you'd imagine a casino that no one really cares about would look like: tacky carpeted floor, smoke filled atmosphere, lots of loud slot machine noises, & not nearly as beautiful as the newer hotels. Can't say I've been in the hotel rooms, so this review is useless for that. It's a bit of an eyesore, but I don't come here for the interior design. I come here for the....

Food:
OYSTER BAR!!!!!!!!! I'm eating my leftovers right now as I daydream about my dinner from there last night. -1 star because they need to expand this bar. Just...figure it out. Take out some restaurant & just make the whole thing a huge steam kettle cooking establishment. I sound ridiculous, but it needs to happen. Just imagine how many more people they could accommodate & the profit they'd make! Heck, they'd even make more jobs doing this. Waiting 2 hours for this food is ridiculous, but pretty much worth the wait. I have one piece of advice for you when you've got a party of more than just your lonesome self: take turns standing in line, go to the bar, &/or play the slots.

Bar:
5 STARS FOR YOU RANDOM BAR CLOSE TO THE OYSTER BAR! 99 cent frozen margaritas?!?! Josh G. said he would start measuring all monetary items in the wonderful new denomination of 99 cent frozen margaritas. Here's an example for you: he could've had 107 frozen margaritas yesterday at Palace Station at 1 PM, but instead, he got 1 pitcher of Rum Runner from Encore Beach Club. Still not clear enough for you? I could've had 15 frozen margaritas yesterday at 11:20 AM, but instead, I decided to get an 8-piece ""real crab"" California Roll from EBC. (To all of those people that hate on others that take photos of their food, THIS IS WHY FOOD PICTURES ARE RELEVANT: SO WE CAN SEE WTF WE'RE GETTING. CAPS LOCK TO GET POINT ACROSS.) What have we learned today? Everything at the newer hotels on the strip, in a club, are worth a lot of frozen margaritas.

Not a fan of tequila? Pft, that's okay because it makes me wish I made better decisions too. $4 Bloody Mary's, baby!! I love Bloody Mary's & I've paid anywhere from 10-13 frozen margaritas for them, but here at Palace Station, it's 4 frozen margaritas. $4 & ACTUALLY DELICIOUS. I drank two within 20 minutes waiting in line for the Oyster Bar....so great. I asked for extra olives & the nice bartender gave me 8 olives. Best deal all weekend in Vegas. 

Gambling:
I don't gamble, but there are lots of slot machines & even a tournament of sorts. Some of the machines aren't as sparkly or ""modern"" compared to the ones at the Wynn/Encore/newer casino. I saw a Plants vs. Zombies slot machine at one of those hotels while PS has some strange Dragon's Law slot from Konami. Bets are really low though so that's pretty awesome. It's like being at a Dave & Buster's except you might win 10 cents. Patrons are a bit older. The youngest people you'll see are standing in line at the Oyster Bar or are kids running around in the buffet. 

All in all, I am a fan of their bars & the Oyster Bar, so I'd make a special trip out here to have a more laid back dinner experience.",zacONW61-GjaCF9h5_icgA,5,6,3,iNHW4CY2q_LJ6Ts-TxK2IA

I was arriving late in the evening, so, I called on the way too, just to make sure they had late check in, I was assured that this wasn't a problem. When I arrived, I found THEY GAVE MY ROOM AWAY.  That's right. I was dumbfounded, since I had already in part paid for it weeks ago. They explained ""We don't reserve beds sir, just rooms, and we can get you 2 queens instead of a king..."" The total nonsense way they pitched this to me sounded moronic, as if they ""move beds around"" When I didn't accept this, the front desk became argumentative, and engaged in straw man arguments, twisting words, and accusing me of using the word ""you"" in the context of the guy helping me, who kept claiming ""Sir I didn't do this, so don't say you!..."" and then stated I was ""accusing him of charging my card"" of course ""you"" means palace station you moron.

This place values only your money, they have no eye on repeat business, and do not understand the concept of customer service, or meeting a minimum commitment.

I'm staying here few days and got lucky and the court yard rooms are demolished, these rooms are the ones people have said that are horrible. I'm staying in one of the Tower rooms, it's not bad at all except the beds are kind of soft, I prefer a firm mattress. It's also pretty quiet. The bathrooms is decent size with a large vanity. 

the rooms with connecting door to another rooms are noisy and if you have loud neighbors you can hear their conversation and music and all so avoid joining rooms. 

I don't like the dining options in this place, you have the famous oyster bar with average lines 2 hours long no matter what time you come. There's a pizza place and only late night option is a over priced Chinese restaurant and the coffee shop. No food court. It's fairly a small casino. There's also a Starbucks. Seems like every casino has one now.

There are some decent dining option across the street from the casino in a plaza. I don't recommend you walk to any of those places at night it isn't the most safest area. There also is a in and out burger about a quarter mile down.

Parking is easy and nice, they have open parking front of the casino but your best bet is park in the cover parking garage and the elevator takes you right into the check in for hotel and casino.

There is a smoking section. My cousin said she felt like a caged rat that was being watched and judged by the non-smokers. LOL!
There was a nice little menu on some of the tables that showed what was offered complimentary and what could be purchased. I thought that was nice as there are out of towners that may have not been to this location before and not sure.

I understand having dogs on the premisis is odd for most hotels although this hotel knew what was coming and was told what to expect.  Regardless, we were set up in the Courtyard which had no easy access to parking, unloading or even clean rooms.  The beginning staff at the front desk were extremely rude and it wasn't just a bad day.  There were five working and all five just did not want to be there.  I had to cheer up the girl I was working with just so I could endure the process.  My room was not ready at check in time and I had to come back later to actually get inside my room.  I had a dog with me and quite a bit to unload and its not like I came early.  The counter staff was very irritated I wanted my key to actually get inside my room.

They charged me 100 deposit of which I have yet to receive back ... will check that next week.  This was NOT disclosed upon making the reservation and I can understand the need since I did have dogs in my room but courtesy would say let me know this first.

The room service was awful.  I ordered coffee and only after not receiving it after an hour of waiting, I called and had to wait another 20 minutes.  The housekeeping staff moved the crate that had my dog in it when I clearly left a note saying do not touch.  There were no fresh towels in the room, just refolded towels that were already used.  The bathroom was disgusting with mold in the shower and grime and dirt all over the light fixtures.  The bed, I didn't dare look.  I had to sleep.

This hotel was contrcted and prepaid for a banquet for the group I was attending with and well, for $30.00 a person, we got salad, dried up chicken or BBQ meat (NO ROLLS!) and NO drink unless we wanted to pay $2.00 for a small bottle of water or $13.00 for a cup of coffee.  We had to tell the staff we needed tables and chairs as they planned on 50 people at this banquet using their laps and when clean up came, they were not pleased to do so and literally expected the guests to clean up for them.  One positive, I cut up the chicken and took it back to the room for my dog.

This place is probably one of the best value hotels in Vegas considering it is not too far from the strip and provides free shuttle service TO the strip. I come here practically almost all the time I am visiting Vegas unless I go with a big group which can afford places like Palazzo, Venetian, etc.. Bally's comes close to value but is more expensive compared to this place.

Do not I repeat DO NOT get the courtyard rooms or prepare to smell cigarettes everywhere and see old tacky sheets\furniture. Get the tower rooms and above since they are re-innovated and more up to spec. Sure the view isn't killer here but it's not that bad if you get the city view tower rooms. If you want to enjoy their king tower suite you will have to reserve probably a month or more ahead.  

Another reason to come here is for the super cheap buffet and Oyster bar. They have cheap margaritas at this hotel. If you become a club member they will send you discounts of up to 40% off of their already cheap daily rates.

The thermostat on the wall wasn't working and I kid you not, I had to bang on it a few times for it to fire up. Talk about ghetto. Oh, and I forgot the tons of shady people around. 

This is probably the dirtiest room I've ever stayed in. The sad thing is, online they list a $14.99 ""resort"" fee. This is a resort??? The room doesn't even have a refrigerator?! I called the front desk to inquire about that and asked what sort of amenities did they provide to consider themselves a ""resort"". The answer I got was, ""it's not a resort fee, it's a cleaning fee"" LOL Since when does a hotel charge a ""cleaning"" fee? Isn't the room cleaning always a part of it? I travel all over the creation, a lot, and I've never had a ""cleaning"" fee tacked on to any if my stays anywhere, ever! 

Please do not let the positive reviews on here sway you to book a room. I promise you that you will be disgusted and it will be a waste of your money! Believe me. The audacity of this hotel to charge over $100 for a rundown piece of garbage of a room! This is Las Vegas and even the $60 rooms in downtown absolutely blow this ""hotel"" away.

So we looked around and found out the schedules at random places. We decided on palace station because they offer a progressive jackpot that is combined with all the other station casinos and we thought we could hit the oyster bar after. 

5 stars for the bingo - the staff were very friendly and helpful. The lady that we bought our games from was very patient with us and explained everything. We were kinda drunk so I can only imagine how difficult it was. She took her time and made a lot of helpful suggestions. The gf ended up winning twice! You're not going to get rich playing bingo but I was pretty fun. You get two drinks each per session so that probably helped it along. We would definitely come back.

The casino itself is ok. But I mean it's an older casino so you can't expect it to be crazy fancy. You can gamble and you can drink and it's not excessively dirty. What more could you ask for. Don't expect to be taking any scenic pictures. We didn't get to try the oyster bar because of that ridiculous wait. For some reason we figured that maybe the wait wouldn't be bad late at night on Christmas but nope. That thing was as long as ever. There has to be something they can do about that. Maybe expand it?

5437612,2017-03-25,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"I stayed at Palace Casinos in Las Vegas (last week)  and had one of the worst experiences in my life.  To begin with I was assigned a room in which the fire alarm was made unusable be a previous guest (plastic bags had been sealed around it: It was obvious but nothing had been done by housekeeping) - this is a FELONY, the room was unclean (phone covered in a sticky substance), dingy, worn furniture with plenty of dings, dirty curtains (black).  I also found a bug running across my foot and had a consistent itchy-ness which continued until the next day. I have stayed at Best westerns which would have been a huge improvement.
When I reported this, there was almost no apology.  The issues I brought up seemed to be of little concern to the staff, but they agreed to upgrade me for two days (Asst Manager said that this was all he could do as the next few days were a weekend-who cares).  He also told me that because I was in an economy room I shouldn't expect much in the room/its condition.   I was also told that a member of security would meet at my new room assignment when I arrived.30 minutes later there was no security, I called security and was told there was no called made to them, and that someone would be sent up.  When someone did arrive, they didn't have all the paperwork needed-I only learned this from a staff member the next day.
The next day things improved a little. After meeting with the GM, who was apathetic to the entire situation, she agreed to comp my upgrade for the entire time I was there ($ 17.00 a day). She also made mention of the fact that the economy rooms are not the same as the upgrade, implying that this new room was in better condition and had regular cleaning. Other than that, I still had to pay the regular rate.  I was met with a security member who was competent; they apologized and checked me for possible bug bites.  I was told I needed to fill out additional paperwork. It was then I was told that the security personnel from the previous evening had not completed the required paperwork.
To sum it up, it was a horrible experience. The only saving grace was the free upgrade in the room. The only reason I stayed was that there were no available rooms at any of the nearby hotels.

5531253,2011-11-04,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"I came here for a pharmacy conference this past weekend.  I can't say much about the prices of the rooms since my school covered for the cost.  My friends and I stayed in the one of the courtyard rooms and it was fine for me because rooms are just for sleeping anyway, especially if you're in Vegas.  The courtyard rooms are pretty much like the ones you would fine in your standard motel.  Clean but small so it got a little stuffy but after a few minutes of turning on the AC it was fine. 

It's cheaper because Palace Station is off the strip, so the money you end up saving goes to paying for taxi's unless you're bringing your own car. However, Palace Station does offer free shuttle service to the strip and McCarran airport so try and use that to your advantage.  Just ask the front desk for a list of shuttle times.

Overall decent hotel but not too sure that I would stay here again since it's not on the strip!

Tip: Must try the Osyter Bar!!

Some caveats:
1. The heat in our room didn't work - not cool when it's in the 30s.
2. The food is still average, but there are deals to be had ($2.99 breakfast at the Grand, $5.49 Subway combo, $6.99 breakfast buffet) so at least you can get by without spending a ton.
3. The Starbucks charges airport/NYC prices - two drinks and two scones set me back $18.

As A mother of one I researched this place and everyone said it was family friendly. It is not. Within minutes of getting my hotel key, we went to go get the rewards card. While we were standing in line, one employee told us that my six-year-old son couldn't even stand in line with us. I told her that I have been to almost every hotel in Vegas and no one has ever thrown us out of line before. The next employee the one that actually helped my mother to get her card was also very rude. She actually asked my mom what she needed help with before she was done with the guest who was in front of us, just so she could tell my mother to wait her turn. Then to add injury to insult, she proceeded to tell us she wouldn't help us because my son was in line with us. I took a walk with my kid and my mom received her military discount. The military discounts are a joke by the way and are only good on Mondays. There are a few like a free Starbucks small coffee and buy one get one free buffet. Speaking of the buffet the food is barely edible but the staff is friendly. If you have family this will be the only place that you feel welcomed. The pool that is actually opened is pretty dirty and over ridden with rude children who seemingly have no parents. The actual hotel room in the luxury tower was comfortable but not quite clean. There is weird leftover food trash underneath the side table and chairs. We had a shower, not a bath, with a reasonable amount of towels. The water pressure was good as was the heat. The reason why I'm giving this a C grade is because the bed was comfortable and I like the room. The location of palace station is inconvenient and way too far away from Fremont Street and the Strip.  You may enjoy yourself if you have absolutely no need for a family family casino, entertainment, or a clean pool. To add to my point about lack of friendly employees we were also harassed by the security guard when we asked about the location of the Oyster bar. The oyster bar does not allow anyone under 18 which is not even posted on their webpage. All in all the only thing I enjoyed about this place was the shower and the bed.

 I was really excited that I booked a deal for two people for $195 (4 nights, plus airfare). I knew that they included a daily fee about $16 for every night but at the time i felt it was worth it because the fee included shuttle transportation to and from the strip and the airport and free internet connection. 

Upon arriving, it was okay. Room was small, big enough to fit two double beds. Your typical hotel bed sheets, but the bathroom was pretty nice. The title was a cheaper version of marble, but was clean, and that's all that mattered. Sure, it's not like MGM or anything, but you get what you pay for. 

Later, I realized that maybe I didn't get the best deal...I should have called in to check in WHAT TIMES the shuttles arrived. They run every 90 mins or so, and only depart and arrive to the fashion show mall. The first day we missed it by 5 minutes going back, and had to taxi back...which was about $13, arriving the same time as the shuttle. My friend and I realized that the shuttle was not worth it, and if you are going to use it, you must plan out our schedules accordingly. Plus, you must be willing to walk from the Fashion show mall if you want to go to the beginning of the strip...The shuttle ends at 11pm, so its a no-go if you want to go clubbing or stay out. Taxing is ridiculous now that gas prices have sky rocketed. From NYNY/MGM back to the hotel is about $16 ONE WAY. We did that almost everyday staying out at night. 

The restaurants in the hotel were....not the best. AVOID! I didn't try the buffet, but the prices were cheap. 

Overall, since we didn't stay in our hotel room that much, I don't mind our room, as long as it was clean and accessible to the casino/food/lobby (which was). The bell desk guys were super nice. They helped us find a pho restaurant on the strip, recommended places to go to, called in other hotels to put us on the VIP list for clubs, and even printed out my boarding pass for me. 

Would not recommend staying here--despite the cheap prices. Note that they charge a daily service fee for each night you stay on top. Shuttle transportation is great--only if you plan on walking long ways or taxing along the strip during the day. As a result, next time I am booking a hotel ON the middle of the strip!! Only wished that the shuttle ran every 30 mins or something. Otherwise I would give it one more star.",11fbf-OHtR2kj8L1PoVliQ,1,0,3,xDbORA7HDAM5ZhBdtzIZRA

Small minor setbacks compared to other hotels in Vegas such as not enough convenient outlets (literally had to move tables or bed for accessibility), bathroom fans werent properly working, the bathtub was clogged.., thin walls, and no microwave, although a fridge can be requested at the front. Overall, very clean a spacious, nothing special. We stayed in 2 different luxury towers, and the first one had a very nice spacious shower, which was nice! There were a lot of random high school kids that would come by which made the casino rowdy and uncomfortable for some families, though, so beware of that.

We read so many complaints about the courtyard that we thought we would give it a try...big mistake. First of all, it is located in another building (not far though, about 10 steps across). For the price we paid, i guess we deserved it?? But you can literally pay a couple extra 10's and stay at the luxury tower. The bed was extremely springy, and the room was pretty cramped; oh, and there was a roach in our room..lol gross. 

The hotel overall was pretty decent; exactly what you find at most hotels, but not too many reward benefits ** BUT the one huge plus side was the restaurant downstairs has specials for hotel guests which has an amazing deal of 1.99 skillets (2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, and 2 hashbrowns) and oh, also a quarter pound burger with fries, also for 1.99. After a night of drinking, you would come back and eat your sorrows away at such a cheap price. 

The other pros consistent of the overall cheap buffet with a pretty nice variety of selections, and the guy at subway (a middle eastern fellow) was extremely friendly and were willing to microwave some leftover food for us! They also had some cheap drinks, like $1 margaritas, and an extremely nice bus service that takes you to the strip. 

overall, i would give this place around a 3.3 stars or so. There are some nice benefits, but a hotel's standards are primarily held for their rooms and amenities, so with that, i would recommend; but only the luxury tower.",llaAdmGmOUMOLhX5_HD92w,1,1,3,S6AnQI4kg-AFjH-UFgCt8w

Whenever I visit LV, I often come to Palace Station because it's a popular casino with the locals (I have relatives that live in the area).  I have to be quite honest and admit that I am not crazy about this place.

Firstly- the casino area is incredibly dark, a little dirty and has a weird, dank smell to it.  It's just gross.  Not big into gambling here.

Drinks and food:  Drinks are incredibly inexpensive.  I've been to only the buffet upstairs, which offers great value, but the food is just OK, and at the time we went, they had the wrong labels (or no labels at all) next to the offerings.  Because of this, I ended up pouring cocktail sauce all over my tostadas, thinking it was red salsa.  Also- their Chinese food offerings were just plain unbeautiful.  The orange chicken was discoloured and flavourless, and their fried rice was just...not fried at all.  The best tasting meal of the bunch was the chicken parm.

Dessert section was pretty decent- a great variety of cakes and pastries, plus an ice cream bar.  The only unfortunate part is that if you're a glutton, such as myself, you won't have room for dessert (and no- you can't take it with you).

Walk in to the courtyard section of the hotel rooms which I'm told is the oldest area of the hotel. It wreaks of vanilla in all the walkways as of to cover up an odor. Not a pleasant vanilla but an overbearing one. Get to the room and the carpet is stained heavily not just a stain here or there I mean every main traffic area in the room was stained.

We started taking photos of it and came across a sock in the nightstand. My partner saw the sock while on the ground and just decided to lift the bed skirt and there was garbage and dirt/dust underneath. I mean real garbage (WTF).

the rooms in the tower are VERY clean and VERY modern.
these rooms are beyond a great value!
i have NEVER had an issue with cleanliness at the hotel...ever.
housekeeping is great and very accommodating.
the gals at the front desk are extremely kind and very helpful. 
the staff in general has been extremely impressive aside from one person.
the breakfast buffet is absolutely delicious and a tremendous deal.
my husband likes to stay here specifically for the reason he can wake up and stumble down to his favorite breakfast buffet lol.
with our players card we pay $4.99 for the buffet and we have often received a complimentary buffet breakfast with our room price.
the new cafe is delicious and another tremendous value!
again, i am not sure why the other reviews have been so awful but this place is amazing.
we always stay here for the first night of a longer stay in vegas at other larger resort type hotels.
we always stay at the luxury resort hotels on the strip on our vacations and do this about 3-4 times per year but we ALWAYS stay the first night at palace station because we just love it.
if this hotel were a larger property with more activities other than gambling we would consider staying through our entire trip.
this says a lot considering the caliber of hotels we are used to staying at.

5749887,2014-01-17,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"I've stayed at Palace many times over the past several years.  All in all its a good value for the price as long as you are staying in the Tower.  The courtyard is much older and the rooms are such that a lot of people would just not find them acceptable. The Tower rooms are newer, generally clean, and most people I know seem to agree that they are a good value for Vegas.

Positives:

1) Good price/value.
2) Free shuttle to and from the airport which is nice given that the taxi ride is about $30.00 each way.
3) The Oyster Bar- a must visit.
4) Reasonable chance at comps if you play a fair amount. 
5) A decent variety of food choices although nothing higher end.

Negatives:

1) Resort fee (about $17.00).  This is no resort and its kind of insulting when they stick you with that at the end. You get ""free"" wi-fi but I'd rather just pay the $5.99. This is my biggest pet peeve.
2) The room safes are not working 90% of the time and almost every time you check in you need to call security to come have them replace the battery or fix whatever the problem is. C'mom....every time??
3) Bad selection of blackjack tables. Usually only 1 table with a shoe and its a $5.00 table and you get a lot of people who don't know what they are doing. They should have at least 2 tables with shoes, 1 low end and 1 higher end.
4) A higher percentage of pit bosses who are jerks and seem to hate their jobs compared to other casinos.
5) Checking in is miserable if there is a line. Slowest hotel in Vegas with the possible exception of The Flamingo and I've stayed at them all. It's Palace Station, you are not going on a 21 day cruise around the world, how can it possibly take that long to check in,",fL2B64euCg1I269xwD3xrg,0,0,4,6hcASPKf9QsB_8817payVw

Something wrong happened to taint our impression of Palace Station... FIVE TIMES IN A ROW.

It was a different thing every time, so after the third time, I said, ""Palace Station just struck out."" We decided to stay elsewhere, and you know what- even cheaper hotels ended up being better, and Bingo is now at the Plaza anyway.

The first time, they messed up our reservation. The second time, our room wasn't cleaned prior to our check-in. The third time, they handed us our printed price quote, scribbled it out, and wrote a new quote for $80 more... Uh... I'm not signing that!

The manager was one of the rudest people I'd ever met. I said, ""We're not staying here."" And we received a certificate in the mail for a free room, since we had such a bad experience.

Wait, it gets better.

We stayed there once more for free, but they messed up our reservation (this is the FOURTH time they screwed up), and we ended up getting a smoking room (stinky). It was mediocre at best, but hey- it was free. And we had to ask for some towels AND pillows...

We checked out at the desk (after waiting 2 hours) to be sure we weren't charged anything. She said, ""there is no charge for your stay.""

We got our credit card bill a month later- they charged us for the free room.

5776958,2015-11-30,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"A totally unexpected experience. I moved here to Vegas in May 2015 & now am acclimating myself as a local. After following the local news about the ""Northend of The Strip"" I decided to try frequenting & contributing to some of the ""Local Businesses"". It had been brought to my attention that the ""Northend of The Strip"" doesn't see the same action as the other end of the strip with SLS being slower than usually expected & ""The Golden Dragon"" slow to open, not to mention the Stratosphere being the only attraction at the Northend I felt like maybe experiencing some real local flavor would be a nice change of pace. I couldn't have been more wrong. I had been frequenting the ""Palace Station Casino"" after seeing many of the ""commercial advertisements"" claiming to be a friendly place to go for local entertainment when looking toward the local casinos. I learned they offered ""free Payroll"" check cashing with opportunity at lucky spins to win discounts and promos. Awesome Right! Well, Think again. I had been there four to five times just to cash my checks & receiving a ""Free Well Drink"" each time as an offer for my patronage. I never used my voucher tickets because 1) I am not a big drinker  2) I don't drink alone but, never the less it was always nice to see I was being welcomed. So on this one Sunday afternoon my daughter decided to take me for my bi-weekly check cashing & once she saw I could have a free drink she asked me if I would like to stay for a drink or two since she had time & it was a Sunday afternoon with not much else going on. I agreed & said this would be my first time using my ""Free Well Drink Ticket"" after receiving as many as five previously I figure why not give it a try. We decided to play the games offered at the Bar while enjoying my one free drink of the day. So the lady Bartender came took our order no fuss, no muss & we began to play. My daughter loaded my machine so I could play my game of Duces Wild while she played her favorite Keno game. I sipping my ""Bar White Wine"" & she had a ""Mimosa"" since neither of us drinks Beer. I used my ""Players Card"" in hopes of the extra points promotion or the ""Big Win"" that never occurred. My daughter put well over $70 in my machine & well over that in her own. In fact, she had to leave her seat upon a couple attempts to retrieve cash from the closest ATM. I, however, stayed at my game never leaving the Bar area where we were seated.  Here is where it takes a turn for the worst. The lady that first waited on us left for a few minutes & a gentle named ""Samuel"" replaced her as our Bartender. Now mind you we weren't there for the ""Drinking"" but since I hadn't been out for fun in quite some time we thought what the heck we would play a little longer. So after our first drinks we put our glasses up for a second drink. The Bartender ""Samuel"" came around saw our empty glasses & intentionally ignored us. Finally, after a few passes I called out to him on his many trips by our empty drinks to ask for a second drink for us and this time could he add water to my order? Wow, I looked at my daughter & she at me & we both shook out heads thinking whats this guys problem. Next thing we know he is whispering to the female bartender who had returned. Then my daughter decided to go to the ATM and comes back with what would be our last attempts for the  Big Win for the day. We both agreed on one last drink which put us both at our total of three for the day. So I slide our once again empty glasses toward the bartenders rail in the hopes of a little better attitude this time around. Once again ""Samuel"" saw our empty glasses & passed them right up to wait on a gentleman who had just walked up next to me to order his drink. So when Samuel was finished with him I asked for a refill & another water too. I was told by Samuel that the water was $2.50 per bottle. I was like so, okay I still wanted another water with my wine. Then he was like I am not going to comp you your drinks this time because you're not playing enough. I looked at my daughter and she looked at me & we were both dumbfounded.  My daughter says what do you mean she's not playing enough I've been feeding her machine money several times since we've set down here? Samuel goes oh your fine you've been playing but she hasn't, my daughter goes that's not true. I've had to leave and go to the ATM twice now & she has never stopped playing. I told him my players card has been in this same machine since I sat down & I've been playing here just as long. My daughter told him that she had been putting money in my machine so she know for a fact I've been playing. Samuel tells us that he can call someone over to check the game to see if I've been playing or not.  My daughter was like go ahead please do because I've been putting money in there for her to play on & she was playing, so please go ahead & check.She gave him $40 to cover our drinks & No one ever came over to check my machine.I will never recommend Palace Rudeness.",JN-xtC9Phr-xB6FkfatP6w,0,0,1,idGk6FLysfhbaUhN4lkJpw

Reasons I'll never stay at this hotel again:

1) No elevators (at least in the courtyard rooms, where we stayed). You must haul your luggage up a staircase. After a long night of Vegas drinking, you'll need to brave the stairs again. 

2) No coffee makers. Well, they do have them, but it's a $25/day fee if you want to ""rent"" a coffee maker for your room. There's also overpriced room service coffee, if you can justify the expense. I've NEVER stayed in a Vegas hotel (or ANY hotel that I can recall) that didn't come with a coffee maker. Waking up after a long night in Vegas, I certainly need coffee. Rather than spend an extra $25 for a coffee maker at Palace Station, I'll stay at another comparably priced hotel that doesn't charge for one. They're also stingy with towels; guests are provided with only one small-medium sized towel (no washcloths) unless you ask for more than that. 

3) CLEANLINESS, or lack thereof. By far, the most DISGUSTING hotel room I've ever stayed in. Layers of dust on furniture, stains on carpet, and dirty window sills that obviously haven't been cleaned in forever. There was wallpaper peeling off the walls in our room, and a petrified piece of candy on the table next to the bed. Walking through the hotel wing, there was more peeling wallpaper and dirty floors/ walls, so I know it wasn't just our room. There was a stair rail that was attached to the wall by being shoved through the wallpaper, a picture screwed into the wall upside down (I informed a crew member, but it was still upside down when we left the next day) and an ENGRAVED sign that read ""Team members please keep door close"" rather than ""closed."" I often stay at the cheaper Vegas hotels, so my bar is set pretty low, but I've never stayed in a hotel this disgusting, tacky and unprofessional in my entire life!! 

Walking through the casino, you'd never guess the hotel is in such bad shape. The casino lobby and gaming floor are nice. The employees are nice enough, and you can get the buffet for really cheap if you sign up for the free Boarding Pass card. We did the buffet for lunch and paid only $6.99 each, which includes soft drinks. Dinner is $7.99 and breakfast is $5.99. If you're looking for a Sizzler-quality buffet in Vegas for a great price, I'd definitely recommend this one.

we also got complimentary breakfast for 2 which we used on sunday brunch buffet which made it an even better deal. although the food was just standard, lots of things needed more seasoning. my favorite item in the buffet was prob the garlic chicken and watermelon slices.

The bad- booking on Expedia with the 'pay at hotel' option resulted in a ton of confusion.

5917218,2008-08-05,0,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"We got two tower rooms connected to each other.  The rooms themselves had a good amount of space and furnishings (two armchairs). Our rooms were clean and up-scale looking and reminded me of smaller versions of the suite that we stayed in at the Venetian hotel.  Beds and sheets were comfortable enough. While the walls and doors were thin enough to let noise come in,  the halls and rooms were usually quiet. The marble bathrooms with granite counters gave the good sized bathrooms a luscious feel. 

The maids were very good about getting our rooms cleaned and the amenities stocked. The tower luxory rooms had many wonderful amenities that I don't see even in higher priced hotels.  Amenities included toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouth rinse, mineral baths, and lots more.  The only problems were the loud fan in the room and the rooms themselves smelled heavily of cigarettes.  However, I was overall very happy with these rooms for the low prices that I paid. I got these rooms as a package deal at travelocity.  I would definitely return.  However,  I would never return to the buffet at this hotel (read my review on their buffet).",0m-7A68bctvAHXPhMEazTg,0,0,4,sy4Ef6du0Zu97M-MzZ4ieg

Advertised at $19/night, I took it.  A nice lobby. but waited in line for over 30 minutes to check-in.  VERY slow check-in process...more so than the number of people in line.  Just note: after the resort fees and taxes, it was about $42.  Still a good deal, but not as nice as $19 sounds!

Well, I got what I paid for.  The room I was given was some distance away, thru the casino, outside, and to a different building.  The setup was confusing and not well labeled.  The room was a total disappointment.  It was old, smelled like smoke, no better than a motel with an old bed.

As for as food, I've heard about the Oyster bar, but didn't try it.  I have on other occasions eaten at the buffet, which has an nice international selection, but truly not good quality.

Clearly this a price decision to stay here ever again!  Pick somewhere else!",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,9,1,2,7yTPbUQYICJpAs37IXIPnA

I looked up a room that was a little off the strip and found out that Palace Station had rooms at $15.00 a night. I thought to myself was ""That is dirt cheap'! You do get what you pay for in the room. It looked like a cheap motel room. 

I didn't know was that the Palace Casinos (Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch etc) charged about $17 hotel fee per night on top of the room rate. The fee includes internet access, gym/pool use and shuttles to/from the airport or strip. Which is worth the fee if you used most of the things offered. I ended up using everything except for the pool.

The casino itself was decent looking and they do have great restaurants here though. The rooms were pretty crappy though.",CVlGVvlR436OH8Q1pHfz-Q,16,11,2,hPCnf1lennxAOJmsBQa2OQ

It's not just the place where you end up after losing nearly all your money at the pretty casinos. Or maybe it's that, too, but it isn't as bad as many might initially assume. A few things make the off-strip spot worth the mini-detour, & these are (in no particular order)...

1. The Oyster Bar
2. Bingo (for us folks that like bingo) + free drinks
3. The Feast Buffet (which is an OK buffet, great for people trying to save $)
4. Chang's HK Cuisine (actually I'm not sure it's still there, but they have some good stuff)

Room to hang your clothes.  I love being in the Courtyard rooms, and being close to my car.  I have been staying here yearly for the last few years, and I love it.  Even the internet has got better and better.  There is a pool and good dining.  The staff are very friendly, including the security staff, and they deal with any difficulties (I had noisy neighbors one year) very quickly and kindly.

5945814,2016-11-25,3,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"My experience here wasn't too bad. However, their front desk staff is in need of customer service training.  I booked this package deal through expedia. Well I thought it was a cheap deal, until I got here and was told that there's a daily $16.79 + tax resort fee. Wait a minute. You're a smelly hotel, no elevator in the section you're putting me in, it's too cold too use the pool, a tv with only 11 channels and you're charging me how much? 

My courtyard room wasn't that disappointing. It had tile floor in the bathroom/small standing shower, a shelf that is very slanted above the sink (you can't put anything on it or it'll roll off), two double beds, an armoire with an iron, ironing board and 6 hangers, 3 drawer dresser, table with a mirror, hair dryer,  and 1 night stands. Oh and the light on the night stand doesn't work.

The cons:
#1 air conditoner/heater was set to 70 degrees but at times it felt more like 78 degrees. Temperature isn't stable since it is old.
#2 shower curtain leaks water all over the floor leaving puddles when you take your shower unless you put one of the towels on the floor.
#3 Daily resort fee of $16.79 is a bit high for a hotel that's not on the strip. Can't use the pool since it's 45 degrees outside and what fitness room? Someone posted that there's a fitness room...didn't see it.
#5 when looking out of my window I have a beautiful view of....the trash dumpster and parking garage!
#6 Guests smoking in the casino which you'll have to pass by in order to go to the courtyard from the parking garage/hotel lobby.
#7 Front desk employees, they need to be going through customer service training.
#8 They need to fix the shelf in the bathroom...it's slanted so I couldn't have any bottles standing up right or they'd slide off the shelf. 
#9 there's no elevator in the courtyard. So if you don't want to lug your bags up three floors, make sure you request for the first floor.

The positives:
#1 Excellent house keepers, best part of the hotel.  That's why they get three stars
#2 Fairly close to the strip and to shopping areas. CVS is just up the road.
#3 They have a Starbucks there, but it's run by the casino so if you run out of money on your app you'll have to pay the difference in cash.
#4 courtyard rooms are clean. 
#5 I guess there were some kind of disturbance that I security was very visible in the courtyard
#6 the courtyard is located directly adjacent to the main building. You walk 10steps  outside the main building and you're in the Courtyard.",e8GGgUizb3YsrMakCJgnCA,2,2,3,WZe9OSglVVBR4dMivMFsPA
5947829,2011-12-02,1,gRCEObNuHtI61xR32ytqNQ,"I stayed here for a work related event during the week, Sunday through a Wednesday.  Compared to the Mirage stay several months ago, the Palace Station beat them hands down in room condition, service, cleanliness and overall hospitality.  The only star lacking was for lack of dining opportunities.  

Parking was close, the prices in the restaurant and bars I visited were more than reasonable, with a good pour (Irish pub, Mexican, and one other) all comped drinks if you play at the bar - something I did not get on the strip. 

If you felt the need to go to the strip there were cabs lined up all the time waiting to take you, there were several shuttles as well.  There were strip malls, other dining, and normal every day things along the main street if you wanted to get out for a normal day as well.

I will consider staying here instead of the strip on my next trip.",KVbMZV-XJPSH9wXEwuXIaA,1,1,4,w2uMh_7y-5qhUnRhCJXQAw

It's not the cleanest hotel I've been in. There is enough dust behind the night stand to give those sensitive to allergies a full blown asthma attack. Who knows when the lamp was wiped down, but it wasn't recently. There wasn't enough towels in the room and it took about 45 minutes to get some delivered. 
Maid service started through the floor at 9m and they were loud. Knocking on poor sleeping peoples rooms. Clearly waking them. I know 9am isn't super early in most parts, but Vegas where people party all night it sorta is.
Parking is free and abundant so that's a plus. 
So, Honestly it's fine if your standards are low. 
I originally gave this two stars. That was before my daughter pointed out the gum in the wall by the bed. It was also before my son picked up a jolly rancher candy wrapper asking who ate candy with out him. Hint- it wasn't us. It was also before I told the lady at the desk the room was disgusting and she replied ""oh, your balance is.. 35.80"". It was also before I moved the chair. Sooo gross. Run. I'm sure there's a good budget suites you can stay at that would be equally disgusting for less money.",hFyjeQXsMkZC87ny6ioDug,1,0,1,XgoFJgdnXjOJF30jTUBI6Q

Overall I can say it was a good experience. After reading reviews here I opted to get a room in the tower. I think that was a wise choice after seeing some pics that some fellow convention goers posted of their courtyard rooms. My tower room as clean, modern and spacious. No complaints.

Not much to choose from as far as bars or restaurants in the hotel. I was happy to see they had a Starbucks and a Subway. Most of my meals were spent at the Grand Cafe a 24 hour diner with cheap eats. It was fair dining. 

The lobby is a bit run down and the casino itself...smokey but hey...I was there for a convention so  didn't spend much time in either. 

I actually had time to enjoy the pool area to which they have two sections...a north and south pool. I guess my only complaint is they need to be better labeled. When calling for some pool side drinks I was asked which I was at....ugh...I have no idea. How about either labeling the pool area, menu that is posted next to the phone or hey....getting caller ID so you know which pool people are calling from. 

In the end I'd have no problem staying here if there was another convention I was attending in the hotel.",T4qbZR0VHBPESlB1l7jTZw,2,0,3,7_P56ssN-A9GeE6q3zoR5w

Overall:

I stayed at the courtyard area which is okay. The biggest annoyance is the shower pressure is way too high. So I am on the fence but ultimately I probably would come back.

Arrival: Check in is at the west side of the hotel so you can either walk though the casino or park there for a quicker check-in. 

Check in: 

Check in was quick and easy.

Compliments:

Room was clean.

Comes with hair dryer, iron, shampoo, conditioner and soap.

The bathroom has a shelf above the sink which is really nice. Makes everything more accessible. 

Flat screen TV.

AC worked great. 

Complaints:

Shower pressure is pretty rough enough to probably tear a thin layer of skin. Then the shower curtains are pretty flimsy so when the high speed water hits the ground it causes the curtains to come in towards you. As the curtains move water may spill out wetting the floor a little. 

No safe or coffee maker/water boiler.

Location:

Very close to downtown which is nice if you want to go barhopping or eat. No worries of DUIs. Also a 7/11 is around the corner if you need anything. Not too bad of a drive to the strip either not sure how much a taxi cost to get to the strip but they did have shuttle service to fashion show mall.",nWS4xS4lAfi9xeW8uABx8g,5,0,3,rVWYcOGy1Or1GD8cUjc4YQ
