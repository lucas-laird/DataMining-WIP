2855,2016-03-30,1,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,I brought my friend here to celebrate her divorce and it was so much fun!!! When we first walked in and sat down I had a guy come up to me and just start giving me a lap dance. He didn't ask and when he was done wanted to be paid. For this reason alone I did not give 5 stars. Besides that the experience was great! I will say that JT is the best. I had a few dances from him. He was my fav by far! All of the guys were great while dancing on stage. It's just a lot of fun all around. I definitely recommend it!,YTXbrBoppIjLBeJh65fKKg,0,0,4,5WNdIO4ZTOP4EXHcvFPt1A

Sophie at OG took AMAZING care of us last weekend!! There were 20 of us girls in from out of town and looking to have a great time. Keeping this many girls together and organized can be hard but Sophie and the OG staff made it a breeze!!
We were picked up by our AWESOME Limo driver in a Hummer stretch and taken VIP style to OG. When we arrived we were treated with VIP service, no cover...no line...and AMAZING drink specials!!
We got an amazing deal and the entertainment was the best part! What a way to start off such an amazing night! The bride and her ENTIRE party of 20 got dances and were treated so well. We all had an absolute blast! I will send anyone I know to Sophie at OG to book your party! It was so easy and the night simply fell into place because of her attention to us!
Thanks again OG for your service...I will refer EVERY large group I know your way! 
This really was a night we will never forget! It is one thing to get no line, no cover but to include drink specials for a large group made it soooo...worth the cost!!
Thanks again and can't wait to visit again soon!!!",nmU14ckswDTS0uB7zGoskQ,0,0,5,BpxEXn9zrzit0A8OrTWuTg

The men are beyond gorgeous, in amazing shape and so fun. My gals and I ( 10 of us) got several lap dances from ""Jimmy"", such a sweetheart, full of energy. My favorite dancer was a handsome man in a NY Yankees cap, I didn't catch his name but ladies watch out he is beyond sexy and you'll fall in love!! 
Price was great we paid $40 each for limo and decided to go with the bottle service instead of the 2 drinks each. We checked out the lovely ladies downstairs but the men here are jaw dropping so we went back up. I've been to other male revues like Hollywood men, thunder from down under and american storm. None hold a candle to the caliente of Olympic Gardens.. I also like OG because it seems more playful and interactive than other revues. I already have my girls planning another trip for my 30th bday, I can wait.

Had plans to be picked up by another strip club buy they were 30 minutes late and by the time they got their act together we had less than two hours before their male venue closed so we reschedule d for the next night and called OG's.  We had a limo in less than 10 minutes. Our driver was friendly and set the tone for a great night! The atmosphere upstairs was exciting. .the women were having a great time. The men were sexy..of course I have to give a shout out to Carlos...my favorite. ..but a few new men caught my eye as well. Our server kept our drinks full which is costly but we were prepared to spend money. We paid for Carlos to do a shower show...ladies..it is pricey but worth every penny!!! Hot! Hot! Hot! And getting to dry off his wet body was heaven!! Kona hooked us up with a limo ride back to our hotel with the same driver who continued to joke and laugh with us all the way ending our night/morning on a great note!!
The next evening we went to the male venue we originally booked..very nice facility until we were taken to the male area which the pics were deceiving..within minutes we knew we weren't staying!!! We called Kona at OG'S promised to never cheat on our men at OG'S again!! He sent a car for us..waived our cover and bought us a shot! He made sure we had a great time all evening!!  KONA is the man! !

A promoter on the street talked me and my friend into going with the promise of 2 free drinks, free admission and a free ride there.  We said why not and went.  Upon entering (for free) we got our two free drinks then were immediately separated by 2 girls each.  It was very fun actually.  My two tried to talk me into various packages but I wasn't up for it since I just got there and hadn't even finished half a beer yet.  They both tried to talk me into it but I declined and said I'd be there the whole night so we could hang out later.  One became very pissed and said in an ugly tone, ""Fine"", pushed me and walked away.   Some of the other girls I met were fun.  Okay, here's the bad part.  When you go in there's a big bar in the far right.  My friend and I met two girls and hung out at the bar.  I was talking with my girl who was from Japan, a cool girl actually.  My friend was on a stool at the bar with his girl.  After a while she asked if she could sit on his lap while they talked at the bar.  Okay, so she's on his lap for about a half hour or so just chatting and talking about going in the back, etc.  My friend didn't want to go into the back so the girl said that he owed her $300 for the ""dances"" when she was sitting on his lap at the bar just talking.  It was unbelievable.  My friend was leaving and she went to the bouncer claiming my friend owed her the $300 for the ""dances"".  My friend explained the situation to the bouncer that they were just sitting at the bar talking and nothing was said or agreed to about ""dances"".  The bouncer told my friend to pay her the money.  My friend was so pissed off  that he pulled out a hundred and said this was all he had and if they wanted more they'd have to ""whip his ass.""  It was ugly.  They took the $100 and we left.

My girlfriends and I have been a few times but the last time we went will be the last time. A cover charge is $40 just to get in. Once inside me and not barely sat down yet and were swamped by strippers. My girlfriend made a mistake buying me a very overpriced lap dance from Mason, once he was finished he told me that my friend owed him $40. I turned and looked at my friend who was very busy getting a lap dance.( so what was I supposed to do interrupt her)  He was extremely rude and pushy he asked me three times for the money, at that point I just went ahead and paid him myself, so he would leave. About 5 minutes later when my friend was done getting her lap dance, I had my back turned for a minute and I saw Mason collecting money from her. I asked my friend what she was doing and she told me that she was paying $40 for my lap dance, I had told her that I had already paid him. By That time it was too late he had already ran off with her $40 and my $40 so we basically paid $80 for a 2min weak dance from this pushy rude dude. He really ruined the whole experience for us. We were having a good time until that happened. Needless to say my friends and I will not be back because of the bad experience.    :( .

It used to be dark, grimey and the dancers weren't very attractive.  I'm so impressed by the renovations upstairs, the new, beautiful stage and the demeanor of the performers.  

They'll approach you and ask you if you'd like a ""dance"", but they aren't overly aggressive and you can ALWAYS say no thank you.   Before, they were a bit more agro. The space is clean and the VIP area is so pretty (chandeliers & lace curtains).   

We called and and made arrangements for a limo pick up with Kona.  Driver was courteous, on time and we were escorted upstairs and seated at the stage.  If you're down for some naughty girl fun and want to get up close and personal, this is the place for you:)  If you just want to observe, you can do that too.  Better than Magic Mike and did I mention that they have almost every flavor to choose from ;)  Flirt and have fun! We'll be back boys ;) 

Tips for the Ladies:  Drinks are pricey, so be prepared to pay $12-$14 +tip.  *If you use their ATM, it will appear on your bank statement as Olympic Gardens, so get cash out at your hotel if you want to be discreet.  *If you plan to get a private dance (on or off stage), your business will be exposed, so dress accordingly!  *Don't abuse your performers with nail scratching etc unless they encourage it! * Ask what their rate for a lap dance or VIP before you do it.  Different dancers charge different prices. * Any problems, issues, concerns, ask for KONA.  He'll take really good care of you and let me tell you, he's really easy on the eyes.

227034,2009-04-18,0,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"went there on the last day of my vacation by myself. (i know, but it's Vegas so I was like what the hell). 

It was my first time in a strip joint and have always wanted to go so I didn't mind paying my $30. I quickly bypassed the women downstairs which was packed with both men and women onlookers, and went upstairs for the men. There were no more than 8 women in there on a Friday night so I was a bit skeptical. 

There was a great DJ, friendly server and host and the guys weren't too bad either. Granted, they flock to you to see if they can get a dance but if you get one from everyone that asked you, you'd be broke. Nothing about this place is cheap so if you want a good time, you'll need at least 80 bucks. No job that relies on tips is easy and I kind of felt bad when the guys would go onstage and leave off with no tip. 

I figured since I was there I might as well get a lap dance. you don't go into a dunkin donuts just for a cup of coffee, you have to get a donut or a muffin. Anyway, I considered getting dances from two because they were so friendly and made me comfortable knowing it was my first time. I actually vibed with them and we had a decent conversation that didn't feel forced. 

I decided to get ONE (like I said the place isn't cheap) and I went to a private area because I didn't want everyone in the place staring at me and it wasn't bad. The dancer actually held my hand to the room and back to my booth and the dance itself was more sensual than sexual (which I could appreciate) and his cologne was out of his world. 

The only con was the guys stood in front of a lot of the women looking at their coworkers dance which I thought was rude but I will definitely go back if nothing else but for the treatment that I got while I was there. The ladies room attendant was even very friendly.",h0fjfVSDqBAQEOTM6u9sIQ,1,3,4,MIiX_SMiujB_XSK95vWfFA

They will take advantage of you every chance they get. They lie, hide charges until the end, and make you thumb print to pay with a cc? WTF? It's because they've been sued and chased by banks so many times. Bad rep for a reason. 

Do not, I repeat DO NOT give them your credit card. You will be sorry when you get the bill. 

Plenty of places to go like this in LV that are much cleaner, more honest, and more fun. OG is just awful, full of heartless people (dancers and managers) who, for lack of a better word, rob you. I've been to places like this all over the country for fun and this is the worst experience I have ever had.

279462,2012-03-17,3,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This place is a scam. 

Went there last night after a nice run at the craps table. I got duped into going into the VIP. Only after paying the $500 fee was I told that there was a drink minimum of $200 on top. Of course this was after the dance started and now I can't get my money back. Then the stripper told me that I needed to add a tip for the server and her. Now the $500 dance was going to be more like $800. I got up and demanded my Id and credit card back. They refused to give it back unless I signed off on the $200 hidden drink fee for drinks that never even arrived. I ended up leaving my I'd and credit card. 

Low and behold today I have a $400 charge on my card. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company and plan on doing whatever I can to make sure other people are not scammed. 

This place engages in unfair and deceptive trade practices and should be shut down. 

Bottom line don't go there. If you do go, do not go in the VIP room and DO NOT pay with a credit card.  Stay away from this scam of a place. Go to spearmint rhino or sapphire if you are looking for some adult entertainment.",Sjl6p_jRmsfzJ24MKY8xKg,42,3,1,16Kt9XHEUXg6iEew66YFAA

I forget his name he is Cuban and I also liked Carlos he was great and so sweet.. BUT my favorite of all was the server!!!

The women are on the lower level and the men are upstairs. It's pretty dark on the first floor so I didn't get a good look. My friends and I went to OG for my destination bachelorette party for about 20 women. The place was suggested over a thunder from down under show for its diversity in men and price. Most of the men were young Black, Latino, White, look like a few Italians, etc. with sculptured bodies, nice moves, and friendly personalities. My friends and I sat right around the stage so we got a good look at everything. Although they don't take off their thong/underwear I was amazed by everything. They do allow you to touch them. They encourage it a lot! Some folks received lap dances which were reasonablely priced. They also offer a shower session where the men would get in the shower that's located off to the side of the stage and do a little show for a fee. With the special $25 deal a limo picked us up from our hotel, each person got two drinks (they didn't have much alcohol in them) and dropped us off at a club on the strip. We had a great night. When we left we ran into my husband and his bachelor crew on the women's floor! The look on my husband's face was priceless!",BNx2zFr2eT2W4YkhhyuWdg,0,0,4,Ec494dzGAbrQ33TcttNztA
326934,2013-05-22,5,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"Ugh. This place has both men and women. We peeped out the men first, which are ""available"" until 1am. Not impressed at all. The stage is a little large, and they won't even come over to you unless you throw yourselves at them, which I'm not doing. Sex appeal just wasn't there and I won't compete with the crazies that are laying all over the stage to get his attention. Also-bought my friend a lap dance and it was $20. Completely over priced for a old man slinging his junk around in a dirty looking banana hammock. Ewww.

The women- Much better view than the men. Out of the maybe 10 or so that we saw, I'd say half of them had moves (one a couple on the pole but most at least knew how to shake what they had, unlike Saphirre). There were a couple girls that would throw their boob in your face, a couple that were boring and one that was just old.

Now, the drinks. I paid $12 for a damn Stella. $10 for a watery vodka-cran. I couldn't believe this. AND you have to buy at least two drinks per card. Not only this, but this is what really pissed me off: I bought the two drinks at separate times. The second time, the woman told me that for all debit and credit transactions, they put a $50 OR $100 hold on your card. The first chick didn't tell me this and the next day I get a call from my bank asking if my card had fraud charges. IN ADDITION TO THIS: The first woman that ran my card, gave me the receipt to sight and a carbon copy that she made, with the card number and expiration date printed on it and asked me to sign it. I've NEVER seen this in my life and asked why that was necessary ad she said it was to match the signatures?

When I was approached by a woman, and agreed to a dance, she then at the last minute decided to take along another girl and simply said  ""2 girl dance"" to the cashier.  I agreed, but this was a hard sales tactic.  The prices were then confusing and bizarre; they charge separately for the room, mandatory drinks, and dancers.  

Then, my least favorite part.  There was some kind of nonsense going on with credit cards.  They came in and told me my card went through for less than the correct amount (which I figured didn't happen and they just made a mistake entering it - turns out it 'went through' for exactly the price of a 1 girl dance.)  So I needed a second card to pay the remaining amount.  Then there's this whole process around signing the receipts, including a bouncer sitting down next to you while you're getting a dance.  

Then, they kept pestering me to do a longer dance.  I declined, and they pestered me for a tip.  Since that's tradition, I tipped out the dancers and cashiers.  Then more nonsense ensued - as I walked out of the building, I was told I needed to come back to the VIP room.  I walked in to find the waitress and the dancers yelling at each other and the dancers claiming they were underpaid, while the Israeli bouncer yelled at both of them.  We finally determined that, yes, I had paid less than we negotiated for.  Whose fault is that?  Anyway, they then kept me waiting for half an hour (one of the reasons I was leaving was that I felt a migraine coming on) to 'resolve this.'  Finally, they gave me a bill for more than they had said.  It was only a little more so I signed just to get out of there.  Now I'm wondering what will actually show up on my bill.

Oh yea, and they keep your ID and credit card.  Nice.  

They also expect tips for things like opening car doors.",ZUGeoQ8GS2TlOk38v23rIw,6,0,1,Z3RiY0DJN3yp9wu1OgpmRw

For me I was greeted and ushered into the VIP room and told it would only be $300 for an hour; this is Lie #1.  They then tell you of a drink charge and various other charges that make no sense.

I had very high hopes for my recent trip to OG for my bachelorette party...these hopes were met and exceeded!

There were 7 of us in total. I had booked an online package that included a limo ride from the Monte Carlo, admission, and two drinks per person. The limo arrived on time and was in constant contact.

When we arrived at OG, it took just a second to check ID's and find my reservation and we were whisked inside. You have to walk on the outskirts of the female stripper area to get to the stairs. There was a quiet, sensual vibe. No one was talking and the music was fairly quiet. As we ascended the stairs, we noticed the booming music and the shrieks of happy women. And then, the party was fucking on.

We got seated and our waiter came over immediately. We decided to get a bottle (it was just a few bucks more and then we could decide on the strength of our drinks). As the booze is being placed on our table we see a wall of unbelievably attractive men walking our way. A simple ""No thank you, we want to get a drink down before any decisions are made"" was enough to give us some time to browse. When I found one I liked, my friends arranged for me to be double-teamed up on stage. So fun. We got most of my girls lap dances right in front of us so we could laugh and take pictures (we have over 300 from that night). All in all, it was probably the most fun I have ever had with my girls.

Let me take a moment to talk about 3 of the men in particular. Jimmy(**see below) was my first pick. He had boyish good looks and incredible balancing skills :). He was also polite and not pushy. We got most of our dances from him. Carlos is fucking beautiful. He asked me if there was anyone that I thought needed a dance. I had one friend who was so mesmerized but pretty shy. I asked him to give her a few minutes to get some booze ingested. He came back later and she was as ready as she was ever going to be. I asked him to be gentle, and he was very considerate of my requests and her bashfulness. The guys really feed off of your energy. If you slap them, they will be rough with you. If you look scared, they will be sweet instead of crude.

I need a new paragraph for Spartacus. I can't even...I don't...I need a moment. You still there? I'm sorry but I don't think I have enough words in my vocabulary to discuss how hot he is. We couldn't get enough. When he wasn't dancing for us, our eyes followed him around the room to watch him dance for other women. He. Is. A. God. I can only hope that he is still there when the next of my friends gets married so we can all bask in his tanned glory once more.

There were only 2 guys out of 20(?) I wasn't impressed with, mainly because they were just shitty dancers and seemed bored. Every other guy WORKED his ass off for his money. Expect us back as soon as we can get someone else married!

**In the first version of this review, I mistakenly called Jimmy, Ricky. I'm glad someone (who will remain nameless) pointed out this egregious error. All I can say for myself is the combination of booze and hot bodies gave me brain damage. Apologies to Jimmy...we love you!",oSGgnx0xX_5nDx5P8Dz5jg,5,0,5,HZUsQCw1ZAUNIa_q710Nfg

When we arrived they tried to sell us on a $500 dollar shampane. Took about 5 minutes for them to understand we weren't interested. 
After paying our 30 per person fee. We got swarmed by girls, which 80% of them looked to be in their 40s and not in the good looking way.
Once we got seated we paid for a 30 minute ""VIP"" lap dance for the groom for $140. The girl took him back and we waited, while we waited the waitress got us our first round of ""free"" drinks. Which then she pushed us into giving her a tip for the drinks. She ended up getting about $20 dollars in tips for our first round.
Most of us didn't even ask for a second round.
While we still waited a girl started dancing up on one of the grooms men, no price or agreement was ever exchanged. After 20 minutes she stop and told him the price was $240. Because he didn't have that much money on him plus the girl wasn't worth that much. He only had 15 dollars on him which she didn't take and demanded that he ask some of the other guys in the group for money. He ended up giving her $45.
We all started to feel uneasy and uncomfortable so decided that we would leave after the groom came back.
After 2 hours we got suspecious of where he was because we only paid for 30 minutes. The VIP room wasn't easily accesses so we asked one of the security to let us in. He said one of us can go in, but when he entered he was told by someone else that he couldn't be in there without a girl. The grooms men that entered tried to explain that he was just trying to get the groom and leave because we didn't pay for this much time. The bouncer said the groom must of paid for more time.
After 3 hours we demanded for the groom to leave but instead were shown the door. One grooms men slipped passed security and into the VIP room and pulled the groom out. They were stopped and told that the fees needed to be paid before they could leave. They tried to explain we already paid, and the groom was being told by the stripper ""he had more time."" They changed the groom 700 dollars for a dance that he didn't want.
Once we got everyone outside we tried to get our ride back to the hotel, but because we caused so much ""problems"" the bouncer/security told us to leave the property. So we had to find a cab on the strip to get back to our hotel.

Unless you plan on ""strip club hopping"" and begin at this place, you should head towards one of the surer bets because you will surely be disappointed.  By the way, most of the better clubs offer free rides and entry...not to mention friendlier and more attractive women.

Pros:
Large facility
More than a dozen ladies
Bar

Cons:
Less than a handful were actually ""ok""
Worst in terms of friendliness

Throughout the years, I have managed to visit every major Strip Club in Vegas at least once, so I have a pretty fair range of exposure.  Even at the worst clubs, I've been known to kick back a few drinks and tip the women for their effort; however, at the Olympic Club, I literally could not give my cash away.  It was so bad, that I left the club in less than 10 minutes - I downed a beer in 2 minutes, felt completely dumbfounded by the experience, and left.  There were only 3 people that got any of my money: the door person was tipped, the waitress was tipped, and I tipped the only dancer that said anything to me because I've never left a club without contributing to at least one lady's college expenses.  

After sitting in the club without a single lady approaching me, I got up to leave.  That's when an older dancer apologized for the slow shift - I gave her a tip for approaching me because it meant that I could leave without feeling too guilty.  There were probably 3 dancers that were ok, but like all the others, they were busy on their phones.  None of them (about a dozen ladies) got up or even smiled, and none of them got any of my ""strip club"" roll.  

This review may be a bit skewed because I went in the early evening on a Monday, and perhaps the ladies were simply warming up or needed a couple of more drinks?  The club is pretty dark, the couches were comfortable, and the waitress friendly.  I don't mind being the only paying customer in the club, but this place was just plain awkward.

He was the most persistent about bothering ladies for lap dances, and didn't seem to have moves or a physique that anyone wanted to see. My only other complaint is that if a lady tips a dancer, he should do SOMETHING for her other than take it and walk away. Blow her a kiss at the very least, don't just blow her off!

We just got our drinks from the waitresses as they passed back and forth.  The good thing about the booth is that the dancers come by more often to hang out and get their hustle on.  The quality of dancers ranged from 6-9 this night as I did not see any dancer that I would give a 10.  For the most part, the girls are really nice and didn't hustle as much considering we went on a Friday night.

The good thing was they didn't really pressure me to buy them drinks as with other clubs I've been too.  Heck, when I came here in 2010, I even got a dancer to buy me drinks which was even better.

We were already pretty drunk at this point and the limo driver was kind enough to let us bring our champagne bottle with straws in it into the limo.  The woman taking our money when we got to the club was not so kind.  Cue four girls chugging champagne in a ghetto parking lot in Vegas.  I think we paid $20 to get in but then were told we also had a two drink minimum we had to meet.  I think I ordered a $12 screwdriver which was watered down and weak.  Two sips in I was determined to not get another drink there so I nursed that one for the next couple hours.  

The vibe here was weird.  We started out on the first level with the ladies and almost all the men that were there were sitting far away from the stage and not tipping.  Rude.  We sat in the tipping aisle and got a very kind reception from the girls.  The girls were cute but not super hot, but they made up for it in talent.  Most of my tipping money went to them because I was just so impressed with the acrobatics.  They showed us a great time.  

Eventually we ventured upstairs the the male stripper section.  It was a bachelorette party after all.  I was instantly uncomfortable.  Only one of the six or so guys was even remotely attractive but that quickly doesn't matter when you see the corny costumes and witness the floor humping.  We all got roped into getting lap dances and honestly, I would have rather had a dance from one of the girls downstairs.  We decided that this was a total mess so we just decided to go with it.  We were pretty much openly making fun of them and at one point my sister started giving my friends dances because honestly, she's more talented than the guys were.  (FYI she's NOT a stripper).  The manager came over and told us we couldn't dance up there.  REALLY?  Were we really competition for the guys?  Was he really worried that the other bachelorette parties there were going to start paying us instead of the guys?  Ridiculous.  

Overall we had a fun time, but that was probably because we're awesome and can have fun almost anywhere.  I definitely don't recommend it for male strippers but it's ok for the girls.  We did get a ride back to the hotel afterwards and spent half the ride drunkenly begging and trying to bribe the driver to take us to McDonalds.  He kept refusing and finally said, ""You know you have a McDonalds in your hotel, right?""  Good game, sir.  Good game.",1H-AVAOXN3AC4SsTdHGJjQ,5,2,2,KyD-69joNbZzuyRQMALF5Q

Our visit was earlier this year, so this review is a bit over due but here goes.

By the look of my photos, you can tell it was an entertaining night even for a Sunday.  

Cover is $30 each, then you are directed to the elevator to go upstairs and see what awaits you.  It was just 2 of us gals and we were seated by the stage since there were hardly anyone there; just a few small groups here and there.  The male entertainers do their thing on the stage while the off stage male entertainers approach you randomly pursuing a lap dance.  They were HOT and YES they had all the right moves!  For the most part the ones wanting to give you lap dances were appropriate about it and if you told them to come back they would leave you alone and then shortly return..lol.  There was one that was kinda pushy, had a Euro-sensual(lol) accent but he let up towards the end.  

As the men were dancing on the stage and came by us, I requested they do a one arm push up  for a nice tip.  There is nothing sexier than a well chiseled man sprawled out on the floor doing a one arm push to check out at all different angles!  Most of them admitted they could not do it so I gave them a nice spank on the tush anyway and slid some money in their g-string.  HOWEVER, there was this one that could fufill my request immediately and he went to work right away on his one arm pushups...I was stunned and all giggles.  He did receive a nice tip from me and I did get to touch him in places that should have not been touched in public....

There were a few downsides: drinks were watered down, one overworked server, and the entetainers would sit off to the side in a group with their gym/basketball shorts on, take them off and approach ladies for lap dances..kinda cheesy.   They would also yell out a group chant when an entertainer would come back accepted or rejected for a lap dance.

On the way out, we got a nice hug from a few of the entertainers.  

Overall the next time I'm in Vegas, I wouldn't mind paying them a visit again.",UwamifkFs7j1W697dZEufA,0,0,4,FzFSQ31NGBKh-LBE7TRStA
981910,2011-08-24,4,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"""Free limo and no cover"" my ass.  Upon arriving at the OG, in the ghetto, by a limo that we were told was ""completely free"", we were informed that it would be $25 per person.  Granted this included 2 drinks, but I want to dictate my boozing, not someone else.  So I get my drinks, which are completely watered down by the way, and watch some of the girls.  Some were pretty, most were not and all but one were pushy.  No, I don't want a dance.  If I do, I know where to find you and how to ask for one.

Fast forward to the stage.  I'm there watching the vagina in my face, albeity behind the girls panties, and my buddy is ordering from one of the cocktail waitresses.  His gaze is away from the dancer for maybe 30 seconds.  I turn and get his attention to check out the dancer, and when he does, she looks at us and says ""You guys aren't even paying attention to me!  Assholes!"" and then leaves.  I couldn't help but laugh hysterically and go to the bar.  I have 4 or 5 Bud Lights @ $10 bucks apiece.  Each with a $2 tip  Earlier, I had tipped another $10 for my 2 booze drinks as well as another $10 for drinks I bought for my buddies.  Altogether, our group probably left this bartender over $100 within an hour and a half.  

I feel thirsty.  I order a ginger ale.  He tells me $10.  I tell him I just wanted a ginger ale, nothing in it. ""Ten dollars"".  I laugh in his face, take the rest of my money off the bar and gather the guys to leave.

If you fucks over there are reading this, you screwed up bigtime. The 6 of us were just getting ready to do private dances and were preparing to stay until you kicked us out.

We chose this place because it had favorable reviews and said it was close to the strip. I can't remember the exact amount of the cover charge but it was around $70.00 for both of us to enter the club. The club is dirty and very dark and the girls were not the least bit attractive. I am not trying to sound mean but if you go to a strip club the number one thing you look for is attractive girls. I would rate the girls at about 2 out of 5 stars and that is being nice. We were approached by one dancer who sat down and asked my wife ""so, how many threesomes have you given your husband?"".  Not the typical way to start a conversation in my opinion. We had one drink and decided to eat the cover charge and left. We ended up going to Sapphire which ended up being a much better experience. If you are in Vegas and want to go to a strip club steer clear of this place at all costs. I think the favorable reviews on this app must be from employees.",7no3XHKQXbFGziL_GBWHeg,1,0,1,9EtVxB1LvlBknxNkTbsr0g
1018247,2009-05-04,0,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"here's the thing: what someone considers ""hot"" is completely subjective.  with that in mind, throw out every review in which someone claims ""all the dancers were hot!"" or ""all the dancers were nasty.""  i would be worried as to what their definition was. 

variety is indeed the spice of life, and the order of the day when it comes to strip clubs.  i've been in enough of them to know better.  you would be surprised at what some men (and women) find attractive and a good strip club caters to the majority.  i found the olympic garden to do just that.  sure, a lot of those women were hot; conversely, some were not necessarily someone i would look twice at on the street.  (if i ogled women on the street.)  but MEN WILL STILL GIVE THEM MONEY!!!!!  hence the reason they are employed there.

drinks are super-duper outrageous, but keep in mind that YOU'RE IN A STRIP BAR IN VEGAS!  it's not the buffet at circus circus, people.  getting in is a literal cluster f**k on the weekends.  no rhyme or reason whatsoever, and a little too much like people trying to get backstage at a rock concert.  i'm slight of build and was a tad intimidated by the fact that i could possibly be trampled.  on the plus side, if you happen to go with some smooth-talkin' women you may not have to pay the cover! ;)  $30 is a bit steep, but if you're prepared it won't be quite of a shock.  and if you're going with the intent to blow some cash, then it won't be for naught.

upstairs was good, but a little sad.  i always feel sorry for the male strippers . . . women are just too cautious with their money.  the guys were attractive enough, but i would have liked to have seen just a little more diversity and fewer baseball caps.  seriously, what is that about?  all were very nice and worked the women like they should.  

just know what you're getting into before heading over to the og, and you're sure to have a good time and find something you like.",-wIwGo6EYJmV8132QZbcFg,0,1,4,pSPsT1hggiw5RhFR1bSqSw

I had been here about 8 months ago for my own bachelorette party so I knew it was going to be an unforgettable night! But seriously, they have hired some new talent recently because I didn't see the HOTTEST guy EVER Johnny Blaze on my first visit...trust me I would have remembered!   We loved his stage dance as the cowboy (OMG OMG OMG) and then picked him to take the bride on stage for a dance.  He was so hot that we ALL had to have dances from him afterwards.  I recommend him to anyone that goes there if all-american looking is your style.  If not there are others too drool over too-trust me! I'll be back in Vegas in October and will definitely come back for more!  

On a side note, the place is clean and well kept and the drinks are reasonable.  Just remember that you are there to enjoy yourself and plan bringing $ to buy a dance for the ultimate experience!

1077032,2013-05-13,0,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"This review is based on a trip to OG with 8 guys for a bachelor party, so everything that follows are the approx group consensus. About half of us were first-timers. Also, we went here as well as Sapphire, so a lot of both this and the related Sapphire review will inevitably compare the two places.

Price:
Sophie set us up with a BOGO bottle deal that came out to $500 for two bottles. We were a bit surprised by the tip + gratuity (aren't they the same?) and particularly by the way our waitress explained it to us, but I guess the same thing happened at Sapphire. Dances were $20, which again is standard? Some of the guys ended up spending quite a bit even though the dancers here were a bit less aggressive.

Atmosphere:
We had a corner booth that was pretty private and seated all of us comfortably. There were a few complaints about not being able to see the dancers on stage very well, but otherwise I think we preferred the semi-privacy.

Dancers:
The general consensus here is that the girls were in the B range as far as looks went, but they were mostly enthusiastic and less restrictive re: contact.

Overall, between the girls and the booze everyone had a pretty good time, including the bachelor. Also, an unnamed person woke up on the sidewalk with no recollection of how he ended up there, so that by itself is probably worth a star, amirite?

A few last tips:
- call Sophie (lmgtfy is your friend) to get set up for bottle service if you have a large-ish group. don't get the package deals online - they're insanely overpriced
- always always call for free+tip limo pickup, but expect to have to cab back",5ktyulji-kLpInFaZJ2Qfw,2,0,4,Oz6w7R6s5_la_-vdInvQNQ

We had made reservations for 6 girls,  30 each girl with transportation to and from the club and a bar tab which the 30 dollar fee went to. So we payed 30 bucks each for entry which went to our tab for drinks. So thirty that you paid covered entry and 30 bucks worth of drinks for each girl, and free transportation. Get this deal its the only one they have. The drinks are around 10 each for mixed and around 8 for beers depending if they are imported vs. domestic. The cocktail servers will let you know once your tab is finished. 
Yes as soon as you get there the guys surround you, but they all want to be the guy to set you up with dances etc. Just designate one girl to go pay for the bride to be to get her stage dance and then whoever wants to pay for lap dances can go ahead. Don't feel you have to pay for 4 dances as soon as you get there. 
I feel its appropriate to let you know how we made it work because I don't want my girls to feel like they got swindled out of anything when the purpose is to have fun. 
Its a bit far out so their transportation is the best. We sat next to the stage and we got lots of attention from the guys. They have great routines, outfits and choreographed moves. If you like the janitor, marine, fire man or richard simmons you would like what they have to offer. They totally get that girls like a show and a nice banana hammock. There are a couple guys that are kind of annoying, but majority were really cool and make you feel comfortable. Take time to scope out the guys and watch them perform it makes them even better when you get to buy your girl a lap dance from the freaky cowboy. Carlos and Chicago were pretty awesome. 
The guys hung out downstairs where the girls are stripping and they didn't have that great of a time. Example; a drugged up stripper blamed one of the guys for falling on her ass and then slapped him in the face, and the strippers kept asking the guys to buy them drinks what is that about?

They are all hot and have some serious moves. Your best bet is to take advantage of the limo pickup bc paying $30 just to get in along w the drink minimum leads to a costly night.
I have to second another person's comment on the rude limo driver. I hope I don't see him again when I return. The guys do come up to you bu it's a business. I'm sure they don't expect a lot of women to come up to them. Just say no or get a favorite like I have and only go to him.

I have been to this upscale establishment on more than one (or maybe 3) occasions and im not afraid to admit it. I come for the guys but always stay for the girls. The male strippers i can handle for maybe 3 minutes before i start feeling like i just got molested by my soccer coach. They are super aggressive and actually jacked money from my friends purse whilst humping her face (they are multi-talened, who knew!). ya try to prove that while a 11 inch cock is in your face (no joke, he was of the african variety). so after we get face humped on the stage by a half naked fireman to the tunes of NIN 'i want to fuck you like an animal', we mosey on down to the women section. These ladies are pure class and fun. without going into too much detail, i easily run through an amount of ones im kind of ashamed to admit to and leave when the suns up. The bathroom attendant is an inneresting addition. first of all the b-room is like 1 stall and a sink. So you can imagine this doesnt leave a whole lot of room for condoms, breath mints, gum, hand towels, lube, or pussy spray AND a whole person. Alas, they make it work and she is very friendly.

We were riding high off a Thunder From Down Under show and rolling off of a mediocre clubbing experience. We had higher expectations for OG. Instead, it was the lowest point of the night, my bachelorette crew was upset, and we all spent way more than we should have.

We arrived by Uber and each paid a $40 cover to get in. We were given two free drinks per person. You have to walk through the lobby of the female dancer side before heading up to the second floor where the male dancers are.

I can't speak for the female dancer side, but seriously just shut down the second floor. Sleazy, scammy, aggressive, and lacking any sense of service whatsoever.

GO SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE:
1. Lap dances are about two minutes long at a cost of $25 a dance. I don't remember any dance lasting for at least one whole song. With my first guy, after two minutes were up, he stood up unceremoniously and tersely said, ""That's it. 25."" What? Have some tact!

2. Other lap dances came and went, all with aggressive guys who exuded more of a nonchalant rapey attitude than a sexy vibe. We ended up double-paying for one guy because he told my friend to pay up when I had bought the dance for her!

3. Homophobic. My bachelorette crew included a gay friend who helped set the weekend up. But nope, no lap dances for him because the men only dance for ""women"". Great, make us feel more unwelcome. TFDU was much more open, friendly, and inviting.

4. It was empty on a Saturday night. One bored dancer on the stage. At one point, a girl was brought up there and given a lap dance for $50. But it was nothing different than paying for a guy to grind on your face offstage.

5. Poor table service. Was there even a waiter/waitress? No where to be seen. We had to order at the bar. In fact, we didn't get our second drinks because we hated it so much and left within the hour.

6. I've had way more fun getting a female lap dance at my local strip club and I was 100% sober (with guy friends for birthday).

CONCLUSION
I get that a job is a job, and this may not be the most dignifying career choice, but it's Vegas. You already have a higher status and us ladies have loose pockets! Work for it! It's like you were disgusted with us. Well you know what, we were disgusted with you too!

I had the great pleasure of experiencing this wonderful establishment during the 1st weekend of May for my Bachelorette/30th birthday extravaganza.  Prior to this weekend I had never been to a male strip club and was warned by friends to not expect Magic Mike, but more of the cheesy fanfare.  Boy, were my friends wrong.    All I can say is AH-mazing!!!

We walked up to the 2nd floor and I was immediately amazed by the half naked bodies walking around the room and the men performing skits on stage (e.g., man dressed up as a fireman lights a match and has my friend blow it out and continues to strip out of his gear. I'm about to faint just thinking about it).  The ladies in the audience were pumped and wild, which added to the crazy, intense atmosphere.  Most of the male dancers were very handsome and had gorgeous bodies.  They were respectable, but yes some of them can be pushy. I don't mind because I work in sales and I get they need to make $$$. All you have to do is say no thank you and they will leave you alone.  A lap dance costs ~$20 and $40 gets you a lap dance on stage.  I think these prices are well worth the experience!  

Pros:
1. Tony aka Spartacus
2. Carlos
3. Jimmy
4. Limo pick up
5. ATM $1.00 surcharge fee
6. The dancers and staff were all very nice and friendly

Cons:
1. One of the dancers whipped his penis (which was clothed in a banana hammock) across my face and I really didn't want it, nor like it.
2. The drinks are pretty weak
3. After the waiter delivers your two drinks he/she disappears to never be seen again

The pros (especially #1...I love you Tony!) definitely outweigh the cons, so I will still award OG 5 stars! I had so much fun that I returned a 2nd night and me and two of my bridesmaids shut the place down.  I highly recommend this place for any birthday, bachelorette, or girls' night out.

When I asked if i could buy a dance I was told no but I could sit beside my girlfriend while she got one. Really!? Why? I understand the buzzkill for the woman to see a hot guy dancing in another man but honestly that was such a buzz kill for me and was really hoping to enjoy myself there.,r_KOECFPT414CfWQoOmpjw,11,3,1,yfrefqhejcEwsqsQs67l3A

Even though I informed every stripper that approached me that I am gay and not interested, two of them proceeded to give me simultaneous lap dances against my will. I told them to stop, but I couldn't exactly push them off of me without getting into trouble with security. Then they had the nerve to charge me. Yes, I was at a strip club, so I kind of brought this all on myself, but I feel the need to comment because, geez, if the strippers are that pushy with an openly gay dude I can't imagine how pushy they would be with a straight dude who didn't want a lap dance. 

There are guy strippers upstairs but the club has a strick ""NO GAYS"" policy, so gay guys really aren't welcomed here. If you have a group of ladies/bachelorette party and plan on inviting gay friends, you should call ahead and make sure they will be allowed in with you upstairs (perhaps OG might make exceptions if notified in advance, but I honestly doubt it).

Maybe its just me, but can we get with the times people? It's 2013; gays and straights hang out together. I'm not saying cater to gay people, just make us feel reasonably welcomed if we come with a straight group.",iBOa6MtWnWviJdr0B7OGiA,26,5,2,UfKEDJZLohhTMUq-139QgA

I never had an issue with the limo service before however it was a different driver.

I would not have been angry if it was not confirmed that I was to be dropped off where I asked, I called the management to tell them about this and they did not care nor offer any kind of help to fix the issue.

We get there and are sat upon by strippers immediately.  We order our 2 drinks each.  Fun.  Friend A has 2 girls sit on his lap.

So, my stripper and I have a long conversation, we went to neighboring high schools. Too funny!  She does her thing, I tip her and she leaves.  

At that point I realize I am now alone.  All my buddies have gone to the VIP rooms.

I drink all their drinks.  I just sit and enjoy the show.  I spend no more money.  We leave around 5 AM.  Too much fun!

We all wake up to go to a work seminar at 8 AM.  Friend A is on the phone with his credit card company.  Turns out he handed his card to a stripper and she hooked him up with the super special VIP rate!  He put about 2 grand into that place!

He tried to tell his wife it was stolen.  The credit card charge was to the Olympic Gardens Resturant.

First, it is small, smaller than it lets on. Second, $30 cover, then $8 mandatory drink from the pushy, bitchy, annoying, nasty wastresses. Which means, if you're there with your wife, like I was, you're down $76 before any girls.

There are no private areas/booths/etc for lap dances. You want a lap dance, you get it in the middle of the room in all the lights or you pay for the VIP room. 

The girls were... weird.  Okay this one redhead was pretty hot, and I kept waiting for her to dance, and finally she got up on stage... and she wouldn't take any tips. She was on something, staring off into space like a zombie. Literally, guys, dollar bills in hand, were being ignored by this chick. She had the strangest look on her face.

Another girl, a hot blonde, was just so very very dumb. Honestly, she was hot, it looked like she gave good lap dances, but she was so dumb. I was trying to tip her when she was dancing. I wanted her to come over and dance and take money from me, and she couldn't figure it out. It was the craziest thing, she sat down on the stage and talked, and I like had to ask her to let me put the dollar into her G string and the rest of my very visible stack was ignored. I've never had to work so hard to give money to a stripper.

If I did go back, which I never would, I would get the bottle service, suck up the cost, for access to a private booth that isn't billed by the minute like the vip room. 

All told, I prefer my local Deja Vu or Cheetahs, and those places are cheap. $5 cover, $5 mandatory drink.

Every ""free"" drink we ordered cost us extra, and they weren't fancy top shelf drinks at all. So expect to pay extra for anything other than water. 
Took the girls upstairs to the guys where these ""clowns"" informed us that they didn't appreciate the guys being up here with the ladies. (Probably because we were better looking. Or it was due to the laughter from their lack of dancing ability) So after a good laugh from the clown show, we left the ladies up there to try and salvage a good time in the place. Less than a half hour later the gals were so disappointed in upstairs they came down and sat with us. My wife said she tried really hard to spend money up there but couldn't understand the men from their accents or they were just not ""Vegas stripper"" caliber. 
The ladies were even more of a joke. If you like high pressure sales, then you'll have fun. No dancing ability at all period. Would not call them ""hot Vegas strippers"". Very below average girls.

It was a Friday night (9/16/16)  so I figured ok, but then I realize we need cash for other things... so he goes back and has her charge it to my card and give back the $90 in cash. We tip her $5 for the trouble. THEN That's when she proceeds to hand us 2 drink tickets. (1each).  (Rip off number 3) We go upstairs because my husband wanted to watch me get tossed around a bit.

All other girls look like they use to have dick's or were transvistates. Way scarrey. I took in a few of my friends one night and one of them got way more than they bargained for in the vip. Those asian girls are really really friendly in the back.  There vip service was cheaper than any other club you buy a bottle get one free but that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars.

That being said, I think it is a good bachelorette party option.  The brides-to-be (or anyone else who wants to pay) sit in a chair on stage, where the men basically do everything but to them.  It was actually quite funny.

We had planned on them anyway, but we would've like to wait until we had something to drink! I know that is how they make their money so it is forgivable and no one was a bit pushy after that. The guys are great dancers and do an amazing job! This is not the place if you are looking for dress-up and play acting - the guys dance, flirt and get physical.

Try to get a spot at the base of the stage. There you will be in the center of the action. All the men will come around and try to convince you to buy ""something special"" (aka a lap dance from a man clad I a silky banana hammock) for one of the ladies you came with. Just say no thanks and they go away right away. Those lap dances are expensive and I personally think watching the men interact with the audience is a lot more fun.

If you're upstairs, it's filled with women on their bachelorette parties and every couple seconds you hear giggles erupting from every corner of the club. It's lighthearted fun, but if you're prude and embarrass easily, maybe stay home. 

Downstairs is your ""typical"" strip club. The men upstairs are attractive and seem to enjoy taking their female audience by surprise. The women downstairs just look beat up. They have glassy eyes.

Yes, last night, I was out and about venturing in Vegas celebrating my sisters bachlorette party.  ""OG"" was the stop apparently because there was nothing inside there but a bunch of horny ass losers!

There were females ENJOYING lap dances from these male dancers!  They were so serious and into having a male stripper turn them around and jack hammer their ass!  And that's not all that was going on...men took their ladies to watch them get lap dances from men-seriously!  This was something suspiciously trashy happening in the darker corners!  Gross me out!  and it get wors!! Downstairs are the female dancers and let me just tell you!!!  These men mean serious business.  They take this stripper hooker deal seriously.  They don't even have any shame and just sat there completely enamored by these female strippers!  It's a joke!  These guys are pathetic! Horny ass perverts!   Man, if I knew that when I was 20-25 that I would be paid that much to show my ass and titts to some douchbag horny man, then I would have done it!  What a scary thought that men are so creepy!  Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.  Poor guys...what a bunch of whack-a-doos!  

The girls were hot.  Not Haut-but a hot bleachy hair type of way.  The male strippers were cute too!  Short but cute.  They danced fanatically all night!  It was awsome.

But I give it four stars because since it was my sister's bachlorette party, we did, after all, have the best male stripper!  He must have come down to Vegas to preform in Mama Mia and somehow fell through the cracks.  He was soooo much fun and knew that we were there to completely laugh and enjoy ourselves -NOT TO GET OURSELVES OFF, like them other ho's, but it was fun and he was great and I have made a definite life time memory!!!  Thank you Olympic Gardens!!!  Your the best!!!!


ps It's 30 bucks a head to get in, a two drink minimum and the drinks are watered down, and I'm not sure about the lap dances-I didn't get one...just make sure you bring dollar bills and not to take this place too seriously!!!!

Thankfully, my bday fell on a Thursday, which is local ladies night - no cover, prizes, etc. And my out-of-town friend even got in for free too. Top it all off with a Yelp check-in offer of 5 free shots (yep, 5!), and this turned out to be a cheap and fun night out.

Lap dances ensued, of course. $20 a dance. Thankfully, the strippers were not at all pushy. And quite a different experience from what I was expecting. The male strippers are extremely hands-on. They kiss your neck, lick your breasts (over your clothes, of course), take your hands and put them on their ass, etc. Good thing I got 5 free shots - I definitely needed them.

In addition to the strippers working the floor area, there was a also a large runway where various strippers performed.

All in all, I actually wound up having a really great time. And we only spent about $50 between us. I, perhaps surprisingly so, would definitely recommend this spot for a fun girls night.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,6,3,4,gtPkjt5ywc6wKfuoGW3Gmw
1991206,2013-08-01,8,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"When I saw Magic Mike (which I did, of course, with four of the ladies in my bachelorette party), I assumed it was the rare strip club that featured men as beautiful as Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer. Apparently that rare strip club is The Olympic Garden.*

My friends and I came to The OG on the first night of my bachelorette weekend in Vegas, along with many other like-minded bachelorettes.  They kept me in the dark about where we were going, so when the limo arrived, I just hopped in and enjoyed the ride.  The limo was a great touch, included with The OG package.  We were like eight girls on prom night, going to meet our (super hot) dates.

When we arrived at our destination, I took in the signage and quickly figured out we were at a strip club.  This was not entirely unexpected, but I laughed and squealed with some measure of drunken excitement.  I'd never been to a strip club before.  We paid cover, with my girls getting mine, then got escorted past the first floor of female strippers to a stairway, where the man helping us asked if we wanted to pay an extra $40 or so for a table with a handle of vodka.  We said yes.

We had pre-gamed a bit, but when we sat at our table, we knew, collectively, that we hadn't drank enough.  We gawked at the men writhing on stage, and at the mortifying lap dances happening all around us.  When the strippers started swarming our table, we turned them away, waiting instead for the delivery of our drinks.  The vodka was a long time coming - too long, really - but when it finally arrived, we went right to work.  We got quite a lot of it, with two mixers (juice and soda, I think, but I can't be sure).  At one point, my friend went and bought water, which cost $10 for a tiny bottle.  That's (one of the many ways) how they get you, I guess.

We got loaded, and after that, the night was a complete blast.  We stayed for three or four hours and had an amazing time.  The strippers were gorgeous, built like statues, gleaming with pheromones.  Several of them had faces to match, which almost seemed unnecessary.  They performed on a stage that went through the center of the room, generally one at a time (alas, no group dance routines), and they were excellent dancers.  One in particular caught our eye, as well as the heart of one of my bridesmaids.  His name was Tyson, and my friends bought me a lap dance on stage.  It was kind of embarrassing, but I was busted up drunk.  Thankfully, Tyson didn't put my hand on his junk, as some of the strippers did to girls here and there.  I think the men are decent at gaging comfort levels, and I was not giving off touchy vibes.  Still, there are some very incriminating pictures on way too many cell phones.  I think part of the fun of these lap dances is that the strippers put you in compromising poses.  There isn't too much actual contact, but the lap dances are fun to watch.

Which I know because almost everyone in my group got one at one point or another.  I bought one on stage for my maid of honor, from Carlos, another lovely man (who was also, by all reports, incredibly sweet).  It cost $40 - certainly worth four small bottles of Evian.  The dances on the floor cost $20, and by the end of the night, we were all buying them for each other, taking turns getting grinded on and hooting and snapping pictures.  I didn't get all the dancers' names, but I know one of my friends had Jimmy, who was almost butt naked, and one of them had a good-looking black man in glasses.  She was smitten with this stripper, so much so that when we got back to our hotel, we called The OG to at least learn his name - we just wanted to know what to call the love of her life.  We were denied.

We had so much fun here that we almost went back the second night of my bachelorette.  If I hadn't gotten pukey, I think we might have ended up back at The OG.

At some point, I figured out that The OG stood for The Olympic Garden, and I thought, as I'm sure most Angelenos have, ""That sure sounds like a Korean restaurant.""  I may never be a bachelorette again, but my friends and I are thoroughly enamored of this club.  We'll be back for another round of all you can eat beefcake before the next one gets a ring.

I went on a Sunday at 9pm by myself cause my friend flew back home a day earlier than me. There were only 4-5 guys performing but all decent. I consider myself picky but they had a good representation of all types. 

Made friends with another lady who was by herself and she opened up a tab for us so drinks kept on coming (so I drank more than I originally wanted to but it was free). 

Enjoyed a lap dance from the all American looking cowboy...wish I remembered his name but he was respectful and we had fun. 

Was hesitant going alone but had a great time! If you never experienced a male review or strip club - definitely a great place to start.

Since we had so many girls, they sent us a party bus. SAAWWEEET! Just the ride alone was tons of fun!  We got there about 8:30, which is pretty early for a Vegas night, but that meant we got front row seats! Right at the dance floor.

The entertainment was fun, full of energy, and very nice to all the girls. The staff was nice, but a little understaffed. One guy to take care of all 23 of us and other groups??? Sorry, but we want our alcohol and we want it now! He was however, very kind to watch how much drink credit we had left and was prompt to notify me once we got down to $20 per my request.

Price:
Locals driving themselves get in free.  Non-locals coming in their own car buy 2 drinks upfront (about $25).  Anyone coming in a taxi will have to pay extra (about $30).

Talent:
- If you're here to watch the ladies, the talent's a little lackluster.  The ladies dancing seem tired and they're not physically at the level of a Spearmint Rhino or Sapphire.  That said, there's plenty of working the room and it produces a nice party atmosphere.  Just know that the dancers aren't going to take your breath away.
- If you're looking to watch men dance, you'll have a great time.  I brought a bachelorette party here and they said the male revue was over the top crazy and the woman were all having a great time.

Bottom line for the guys: if you're looking to drop thousands of dollars on insanely hot women, this ain't your strip club.  If you're looking for a down to earth place to hang out for awhile and be entertained, it's a solid choice.

The men -- there were some really really gorgeous guys.  No, not gorgeous, HOT guys.  Great bodies, great moves -- but I can only remember 2 really hot guys and none of them were particularly NICE.  Some of them were just aggressive assholes.  A lot of the guys looked over 40 and not in a sexy George Clooney ""distinguished"" flattering way.  

The dances -- they were much more raunchy than female dancers.  There's a lot of banana hammocks.  It made me think of impressionism -- good from far... yea, you know the rest.  One guy in particular really needed to ex-foliate their ass (according to a friend).  That's the opposite of sexy

The cost -- HOLY SHIT these guys are shady.  This place felt too mechanical and too shady.  I don't think you'd suspect it at first -- but when we got in we were greeted by a line up of guys.  They seemed friendly at first, but no money no honey.  There was one friendly guy (Asian guy) but all the other dudes seemed way more interested in screwing you over than pretending to want to screw you.

First, the guys would take money from out of your hand, put it in your mouth or your dress and then work for it.  Ummm, no it doesn't work that way.  Next, they would just take money from the table by the stage.  What the fuck?  Thirdly, I had one guy rub up against me only to find that he stole a $20 voucher a friend had slipped into my dress.  Yea, sly.  The worst was a guy asking my friend sitting next to me if it was ok if I bought her a dance.  Um, sure I'll buy her a dance but because I wanted to, not because you pressured me.  The worst part? Guess who never got her dance?

It was fun, but don't go there too drunk and set a budget for yourself.  Hold on to your cash closely!

In a town full of overpriced, over-hyped strip clubs with under-talented girls, the OG stands out as what a strip club should be. Dirty, bawdy, nasty fun. 

The cover charge is the same as everywhere else: $30 for out-of-towners, but that's where the similarities end. OG is not trying to be ""the most luxurious"" anything, and the prices reflect it. They're not charging $20 for a shot of Patron if you get my drift. The drinks are still expensive, but where in a Vegas strip club can you get a cheap drink anyway?

The space is dark, decent (if not a little on the dirty side) and would pass as a higher-end club in any other city such as Portland. The girls know how to work the pole (at least a few were climbing up, swinging around, etc), which provided an actual reason to sit at the rack. Our server Ericka was 100% on, super nice, and took great care of us even though we weren't buying bottles or paying ridiculous VIP fees to sit at some VIP table. The girls weren't pushy for the most part, and they were all more than happy to give the bachelor much more than his $20 worth for each dance. 

We didn't venture into the VIP room, but we hear it's pretty fun back in there. I'll just leave it at that. 

While myself I prefer more laid back adult entertainment (I'm from Portland, so I don't care to pay a whopping premium for fake-ass luxury), this club was a happy medium between spots like Treasures and the Rhino and, well, joints that might be filthy enough to scare off your average bachelor party crowd. 

I hear they also have a male revue upstairs, so there were a lot of non-stripper girls in the club as well. 

Of the 3 clubs I went to while in Vegas for a bachelor party, the OG is where I had the most fun, and definitely would be my first choice upon my return visit.",Pf7FI0OukC_CEcCz0ZxoUw,15,10,4,xq7vmnh3cxwti-HplQJ4gQ

My friend paid a girl walking by money to give me a dance, and when I rejected her, she refused to give me the money to get a dance from another dancer, instead saying she had to give the money to my friend, who had left by then. When another stripper threw beer at a member of my party, I had had it, and left.

It was my birthday and my friend and I were picked up by the OG limo with handsome driver Bernardo right on time from our hotel on the Vegas Strip. This place is very clean and high class and everyone working here was very friendly (even the ladies working the entrance) and not stuck up like at other clubs. All the guys dancing had perfect, chiseled bodies, sexy faces, and could really move. They were also really friendly and easy to talk to. Only one was really pushy about asking for a dance and he was really handsome so if he had waited, I probably would have gotten one from him! My girlfriend and I each had lots of dances and our own personal favorites. My favorites were Carlos and Pitbull and my dances with them were numerous, sensual, and highly erotic! They took their time with me and each dance lasted a long time and was never rushed. I was in a trance with these hotties! Hands-on is quite the understatement with these sexy Latin lovers and ladies you can touch them and they will touch you back! Needless to say, I had the best birthday ever with these luscious, smooth all over, and smelling amazing guys! Treat yourself to a night you will never forget and visit these guys! I promise you will love it, especially if you are a Vegas wild child like myself! I can't wait to return ASAP and bring more money next time for even more dances!

2158177,2012-09-20,12,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"Woooow... I had no idea this place was more famous for their male strippers than their females up until I saw these pictures as I am reviewing. And lucky for me, I was able to experience both! Free limo ride to the club and they pick you up from wherever you're at. Cover is $25 which includes 2 drinks but not gratuity.

If you wanna see the male strippers, they take you up the elevator and you'll walk into a room filled with screaming, howling women. The vibe is more fun up here. The guys bring chairs up to the stage and grab birthday girls and bachelorettes to perform lapdances while the entire crowd goes wild.

The waitress upstairs was beyond rude. Not only did she question the drinks that we ordered, but basically ordered our drinks for us. On top of that, she FORGOT some drinks. If you're going to suggest how we want our drinks to be made to make YOUR job easier, at least get it right. No apologies, just a scoff and returned to slam our drinks on the table. AND the drinks tasted like shit. I should've just stuck with soda. Our table was still filled with half the drinks when we left to have a better time downstairs.

Downstairs with the female strippers has a more sexy, laidback vibe. The girls are just funner to watch because they're more graceful. They have that pole dancing advantage and I love watching them climb up and twirl upside down! The waitresses are a lot nicer here as well.

This was my first time and probably will be my last time here.  2 Floors.  Sausage fest for the bachelorettes upstairs and what seemed like approximately 88% Southeastern asian chicks downstairs.  The other 12% were of the non-white variety.  We arrived at about 11pm so you figure this is the ""creme de la creme"" of the talent.  

I literally ONLY lasted 20 minutes inside OG.  It all started with a camera!  It was never meant to be used inside BUT shiznit happens.  Security never gave me any warning and said, ""it's time to say good night"".  My response was ""GFY and no your not taking my camera!""

What sucked was I never got to buy my buddy a dance here, but I got a pretty detailed report about the debauchery (i'll spare you those details) and shadiness after I got the boot from the fellas.  Apparently everybody saw the one of the dancers just blatantly grab a fresh bottle of GG from our table and just run off with it.  The manager accused my buddy of lying about the incident and the dancer finally fessed up and apologized.  But when it was all said and done.....they replaced it with a bottle of Absolut....WTF kinda BS is this?!?

Yes the hummer limo ride was free and so was the cover...but it's still ""slim pickings"" at OG.

I should give this place a big fat ZERO because I'm pretty sure the bartender roofied me.  

Why do I think he roofied me?  Let me tell you.  

A friend of mine had her bachelorette party in Vegas and her maid of honor thought up this brilliant idea of making us all wear corsets- bridesmaids/friends in black and the bride in white.  Well, I'm rather busty, but luckily I saw my drunken future and prepared for the inevitable.  More about this later. 

So, we make The Olympic Garden our first stop and right away the guys bombard us. They cornered us individually so that we couldn't consult on who everyone was buying lap dances for, and thus we all bought multiple lap dances for the same people. This is when I learned that lap dances make me uncomfortable, especially if I haven't even had a damn drink yet. I actually made the poor guy so uncomfortable he asked me if I was feeling ok. I just don't find guys who kiss their own biceps while gyrating on top of me sexy... I find it funny and maybe a little sad, but not sexy.  

After I was dance raped, I made my way to the bar where I recognized the bartender. My dad owned a bar and I knew this guy had totally worked for him (Note to self- my dad must be a real asshole if this guy did indeed roofie me [sorry daddy, but I'm sure you stopped reading at dance rape if for some reason you stumbled upon this review] and also, this is a small, small world). So, I asked the guy and after finding out who I was he started pouring me shots. I had about three the entire time we where there. Trust me, I can handle three shots and this was all I had to drink for the rest of the night. Not only that, but he was the only person who came in contact with these shots other than my mouth.  

This is where my memory gets fuzzy and eventually it just goes dark, but before I forget who I am I decide it'd be fun to call home and tell my dear old dad who I ran into. Thank God my brother answered and screened the call. I don't even know what I said to him, but he told me I was pretty out of it. Last memory from here on out is an image of the limo pulling up and my friends piling in. 

The next day. I wake up in my hotel room with a start. I have no idea where I am at first. I have no idea how I got there and I have no idea how I got out of the corset from last night. This is where my friends and my boyfriend at the time fill me in. Luckily, he just happened to be there for the bachelor party, but unfortunately my near death state forced him to miss out on all the stripper action. Haha, sucker.  

So, apparently I was completely gone like I'd never been before. I fell down multiple times in public places and even knocked a friend into an open trash can. It was so bad that a security guy at MGM Grand offered me a wheelchair, but my friends were afraid he was just some random guy trying to molest me so they continued to lug me around. I had horrible bruises all over my body the next day to prove just how embarrassing this all must have been. Here is where my good planning for a drunken future comes in. I knew that my corset had a tendency to slip, so I wore a lace cami underneath just in case I got too drunk to pay attention to wardrobe malfunctions. This proved rather smart because all the falling down pulled my corset right off of you know what. If I hadn't been wearing that cami I would have looked like I was dressed for a topless review. 

I also puked in a cab at some point.  The cab driver started yelling in another language and a girl I barley knew caught my freakin' throw up in her hands.  IN HER HANDS! 

Once they got me to the room, I was completely out. I mean, dead to the world. Well, until I guess one girl got on my nerves enough to wake me out of my stupor. My friends told me she was complaining about everyone wanting to wait around a bit to make sure I was okay. So, I popped my head up long enough to say, ""Be cool, bitch.""  That was the last thing I would do or say until the morning.

My poor boyfriend got wind of the state I was in and said I looked like a dead person when he went up to check on me. He missed out on the rest of the night for fear I would stop breathing. Apparently, I was completely non-responsive.  

The next day, I wanted to kill myself. I have never felt a hangover like that in my entire life. It was HORRIBLE.  

In conclusion, I have no way of knowing what was in those drinks. All I know is that no amount of binge drinking ever rendered me completely unconscious and without memory of an entire night worth of events.  Everything after leaving the strip club is like a dark hole in my memory- it's just blank, as if the rest of the night didn't even exist.

$20 cover and 1 drink/pp minimum. No biggie, it was for a bachelorette party.

We first started our night upstairs with the male strippers. I was really scared at first because men in thongs scare me, and they just don't mix. And men in tightee whitees isn't exactly that sexy either. I think they should all wear boxer briefs like my bf. =D

Anyway, some of the guys were good-looking, and some of them not. I saw quite a few very short guys; I was a head taller than some of them, but they had nice faces and great bodies. It really doesn't matter since you are sitting down. hah! Virtually all of them were pretty buff but not disgustingly buff. Also, they shave every inch of their body, hairless men. hahahahha!

The shows they put on were really entertaining. They had on all these tacky outfits, like fireman with plastic hats, policemen, etc. It was so tacky, but that is what made it so funny and entertaining. These guys really know how to dance. Some of them have serious moves and can hold crazy positions. They must be Yoga/Pilates instructors during the day. LOL. Like one girl mentioned, many of them are professional dancers and you can tell.

The bride-to-be got some crazy lap dances and lots of fun fun attention from the strippers. Man, those guys make so much money. $20 bills flying around everywhere like rain. Lucky bastards. HAH! 

One incident is pretty funny. This gay stripper was trying to sell some lap dances to me... but when he asked me, it was so very very very clear that he was flaming gay! HAHAHA, I politely said ""no.""

Overall, my girls and I had a good fun time. The male strippers are very upbeat and happy go-lucky. Must be all the endorphins from all those serious dance moves. 

One of the hottest strippers there was arond 6'4"" and wearing a baseball cap and camouflage pants. He was one of the more ""boring strippers."" 

The bride-to-be's first lapdance was from a Polish guy. He was more entertaining. He has long brown hair and is very Euro-looking. Probably the token-Euro stripper. My friend made me get a lapdance from him. He saw how scared I was so he said ""don't worry, I will go easy on you."" hahah! That was nice because it made it less awkward.

Overall, it was fun and they played great music. Better than the music they played at Pure. hahah! Very danceable.

After a couple hours with the male strippers, we went downstairs to the female ones. To be honest, this was so boring! The music was so crappy. How do they dance to some of that? I wasn't too impressed with the female strippers. They all looked bored and monotonous... probably because most of the clientele were kinda skeezy looking. Also, some of the female strippers were butter faces and/or looked too old to be doing what they were doing. I didn't see any really cute/pretty girls there.

The female stripper area had big round tables and was more dimly lit. The strippers didn't even approach us either. Last time I was in Vegas, I went to another strip club called Sapphire where the girls came by and chatted it up with all of us. They even gave us free lap dances. 

Anyway, if I come back to this place, I'd skip the female strippers altogether. The male strippers seemed more of a show than anything else. My first experience with male strippers wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.",W92Wd0GE_-13ogVeKIIF7g,2,2,4,Zc5BB9oDucGWa2EM1yHInQ
2605633,2015-01-24,3,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"This was my first strip club experience. I wanted to go to a strip club that had both male and female strippers so my boyfriend and I could enjoy. The price of cover on a Friday night was $30 a person which isn't so bad considering Sapphires was charging $60 a person. You get two free drinks per cover which is pretty awesome.
Male strippers were on the top floor (it's a two story building) and my boyfriend and I went there first since the guys only dance until 4am. The guys definitely did not waste their time in trying to give the girls a lapdance. They came straight up to me and asked me if I wanted a private dance. I told them I was with my boyfriend, and they then went up to him and asked if they could give me a lapdance saying ""They will be gentle"". My boyfriend isn't the type to have another guy dance on me so he said no and they respected that which we both liked. We continued watching them and they were so much fun!! Guys took turns dancing and they were fun and interactive, not to mention HOT! One guy looked like Channing Tatum. Very good dancers!
After 30 minutes we went to the female strippers downstairs. It was definitely a different experience than upstairs. The girls noticed my boyfriend was with me so none of the girls came up to us for at least one hour. My boyfriend were just drinking and watching. When my boyfriend went to the bathroom a stripper came up to me and asked if I wanted a lapdance. She was very nice and told me to have a good time. I felt really bad for just sitting there so I thought I would buy a lapdance for my boyfriend when he came back which was $20 . Unfortunately my boyfriend didn't think the stripper that came up to me was pretty so I had to decline right after saying yes and she said that's totally fine which I liked and respected. I felt no pressure. I decided to still buy a lapdance for my boyfriend because it's Las Vegas and we might as well get something, so we chose this really tall and buff Cuban girl who didn't have a customer and was eyeing us for a lapdance. She was really nice and didn't intrude on my boyfriend or anything. My boyfriend said she poked him with her breasts though which he thought was funny. It was all fun! 
The girls and guys don't show their ""bottoms"", but once in awhile I did catch some strippers allowing the customers to touch more than usual. Lapdances are $20 for one song which is cheap and there was no pressure to tip (my boyfriend gave $1 lol!) The girls are respectful and good to couples. 
I have to admit though, the girls are a hit or miss; some were beautiful but some were not. Lots of diversity in the girls since guys have different preferences. There are fat girls, skinny girls, wife-looking ladies, Asian girls, Latinas, etc. The guys though are really hot but not too much diversity; all of them had six-packs and were super fit (I like chunkier guys). I would to go here for a bachelorette party though :)
The only downside was that my ass got slapped a few times by a couple of drunk customers who thought I was a stripper because I was wearing super high heels and short skirt (mind you I just got out of a club).

This is a review I need to write now, because I don't know when I'll be in the company of so many hot nekked men again.  I also figure that this place doesn't change.  Just the men do.

Never fear, you can come here if you are a man...even if you are a straight one.  There are ladies downstairs.  BUT....for all you ladies going to Vegas, for all you ladies who want to get a look at the ""goods"" if you will, the upstairs is filled with men in banana hammocks, and combat boots.  Bachelorette parties galore, cuz i don't know why you would come here otherwise, this place caters to those ready to settle down and their desperate, silly drunk girlfriends.  

This place is cleaner than most other strip clubs I've been to.  I mean I'm no expert on strip clubs, but I've been to a few.  Its worth the cover you pay, cuz i cant remember the last time I laughed that hard.  If you are lucky you wont remember most of the experience anyway, cuz you mind will be in an alcohol filled haze.  Trust me, you might want to be there...otherwise it could be traumatic.  Banana hammocks can cause permanent retinal damage if looked at and remembered.

Last time I was there, there was this not so attractive, long haired gentleman shaking his money-maker and wearing his man thong, and I thought he looked familiar.  My first thought was, ""did we used to date cuz i swear I've seen him naked"" and then when I KNEW that idea was just ridiculous, I realized that i HAD seen him naked, but it had been years prior in San Diego at my sorority house.  (start laughing now...yes, I was in a sorority)  I did not pay for another lap dance from him...he wasn't cute in SD, and he sure wasn't hot in Vegas.....but we managed to find another attractive dude amongst the gaggle of hot half nekked guys to mount my to-be-married friend.

I'm pretty sure most the strippers are not into women, because with all of the bumping and grinding they are required to do to make the ladies giggle in the booth, they never seem to get aroused.  I find that a bit odd, but its honestly probably for the best.  Lord knows i don't want to feel ANYTHING against my leg while someone is dry humping me for cash.",eu19K9KfnvvubzWuv4l6Wg,11,12,4,oLVcYitMKPQyY4fGZz22TQ

I didn't get to research this place since the other maid of honor was designated to search for strip clubs in Vegas while I conducted the hotel, restaurants, and transportation. 

I only saw the website for this club the day that we went, and it seemed very interesting, raunchy, and the perfect place to take our bachelorette there. 

They picked us up in front of the Venetian after dinner, and I really liked the complimentary limo service. We got a huge Escalade limo and was able to surprise the bride to be with it at the last minute. That got us in the mood to party so that was lots of fun.

Once we got to the club, we walked through the bottom floor, which is for me [viewing women strippers], and headed upstairs to the male strippers. The atmosphere was totally different upstairs. Everyone was screaming when the guys came on to do their individual routines, and random lap dances for other bachelorettes were also embraced with shocked screams. Downstairs, the atmosphere was much quieter, and the guys were all lounging instead of screaming and partying. 

Our drink service started out fine. We got our first round, but it took FOREVER and a DAY to get the second round. We wanted to get a little more liquored up before they took the bachelorette on stage, but that didn't happen. 

I've been to a strip club before, but it was more of a show, and you ASKED for the lap dance. Here, the attack you like vultures, going after your friends and using tactics to get lap dances that you didn't even want. I was NOT a fan of this, and I felt for my friends that were too nice to say no to their selling antics. We are here to party but give us some time to work up our energy and drinks and let US ask for the lap dance! The constant questions and selling antics got really tiring and we ended up leaving after about 2 hours or so, just because we were so annoyed at the talking naked men!!

Overall, the performances were cool. The routines were cheesy but fun, and I was appalled at some of the acrobatic skills the dancers possessed. Some were going split jumps in the air and hand stands like Olympic gymnasts! Why not do Cirque du Soleil instead of stripping?

Arrived to Vegas with a group of 6 of my dudes for my brother bachelor party, pregamed at the westgate penthouse and walked the strip, had dinner and ish. As dudes go we decided to hit up osheas (spelling?) to hit up beer pong, bad idea at 10pm when it's first come and everyone is drunk not keeping record on whos got next on the tables.  So we decided to bounce and outside of the irish casino we get approached by this eastern european dude named nash, says he promotes for OG, ask him to clarify what it is, and explains it's a poppin strip club.  Now the deal he offers is free transportation to the club, back to where he picked us up and a $25 a head cover that includes two drinks of your choice, we thought it out and decided to go for it.

As promised the dude came through we walked right in and got a table with all my dudes (6) each getting a chair and 2 drinks of choice for the low low price of $25 =)

And... the fun begins, $20 lap dances, girls for the most part are 5-7.5 of the scale with an exception of some low 3's runing around and maybe a few 9's which were obviously taken for most of the night.  We planned to chill for about an hour or two... we were there for about 4.5 hours... for some reason time flies in there lol

Anyway i'd give this place a 3.5 out of 5 stars, it's roomy, not too large but id say the size of a small wh with two stages, the stage towards the bar is about twice the size of the one on the other end (left of the entrance).  

Downsides- bottle services are too expensive, at least the quotes we got the bald dude at the entrance (manager) was very asshole like in charging $375 per bottle, at a strip joint you must be kidding so we passed... also drink prices kept change, my redbull vodka was $10 and then refills were suddenly $13 wtf so make sure you tip one waitress and keep going back to her.  Finally keep your possessions close, some dude next to me who was not in my group was taken for his iphone4 so watch them hoes closely!",oxTbahl1VRj8NyYMOY6fCg,0,0,3,ZGFfp99QRCMCxNsv0j56KQ

so this place accommodates those seeking female and male entertainment. upstairs for the ladies and downstairs for the men. Once you arrive to the second level and the elevator doors open you hear nothing but excited women screaming at the top of their heated lungs. 
we were immediately seated and approached by multiple male dancers for lap dances. didn't like that part, i wanted to at least sit for a couple of minutes to get acclimated. it's not everyday that i see stranger's ding o' lings dangling around in neon thongs.  but if we must we must and we did... lap dance after lap dance. 
the guys knew we were a bit green to all of this so they were nicer to us than other gals who wanted it all. so we didn't get humped in our face, or touched ,etc. But we were definitely entertained. 
Great place for a night out with the girls. You can go to the website and book a package deal which includes entry, drink voucher ($30 i think) and one way limo ride from hotel to the club. Will need to catch a cab back.

Well the beer was sitting on our side of the divider so we were lucky he kicked the beer and not our faces. My drunk friend made him say he was sorry before the lap dance. So you know how genuine that was. One person came up to me right and asked if I was ok and apologized it was a black stripper with beads in his hair and a Gillian hat. He was very nice. 

I sat there covered in beer soaking wet and started this review with one star. Ranting on what a bad time I had and how I was never coming back no matter how much my bestie wanted to.

Offered to buy me a beer and I told him I'm not drinking. He said is there anything I can do to make your night better. That made me smile and happy. I told him you just did. We talked a few.

This was the first time visiting a male-dancing strip club. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would enjoy this experience as much as I did. 

My lady friends took me here for my bachelorette party. I was so nervous going up those stairs, not knowing what to expect. 

As soon as we got there, the men lined up and my friends asked me which one I wanted a dance from. Uhhhhh, idk, can we sit down and talk first so I can get to know each one?! hahaha just kidding. I really couldn't pick one as they were all hard bodied and decent enough in the face. One of my friends chose a guy for me. He whispered in my ear not to be nervous and really put me at ease. It didn't take long at all for me to get comfortable. 

We stayed for hours, buying each other dances left and right. Even my lesbian friends loved it and wanted to stay! 

The boys were sneaky in trying to persuade you to buy dances for your friends, but none were pushy. If you tell them no, they go away.

The men could dance and they abso-fucking-lutely worked the sexy factor. They were friendly, full of smiles, and totally impressed our whole group. These boys worked hard for their money. I would easily go back,  again and again and again. They gave you just the right amount of dirty without being disgusting or uncomfortable about it. 

It was definitely the highlight of my amazing bachelorette weekend in Vegas. This is what girls are supposed to do, right? Then get on it! Limo service, drinks, hot men that make you feel like the sexiest girl in the world.....uhhh stop reading and reserve now!

We were supposed to be on the list to get in free, but somehow they did not have us on the list, but they offered to let us in for half price, so getting in for $10 wasn't so bad.  Plus, the manager guy who worked at the front said of all the sexy women he has ever seen, I had to be the sexiest he's ever seen by far.  This being said in front of all my other fabulously hot girlfriends and he works at a strip club!  HELLO, ego boost.  

Inside, the bottom floor is women strippers.  We headed upstairs to see the men.  There is a 2 drink minimum, but they honestly did not regulate this whatsoever.  Nevertheless, I still had 2 drinks.  Small drinks for the price.  Vodka drinks $7 in a tiny ass glass.  

The male strippers immediate came over to us because it was pretty early and there weren't a whole lot of people there yet.  They were actually HOT!  No butter faces at all.  And, of course, fabulous bodies taboot.  I think just about everyone in my party got lap dances.  Having recently gone to Centerfolds in San Francisco where the ladies charge $40 a lap dance, $20 seemed like nothing.  I bought my friend a lap dance, but she obviously wasn't drunk enough and wasn't having it, so I ended up with the lap dance.  This guy had the softest skin and hardest body I have ever felt.  He must work out all day, then go get an exfoliating body scrub.  Watching my other friends with their lap dances was one of the funniest things of my life.  I've never seen positions like that!  

I headed downstairs where the ladies were because let's face it, women can be fun too.  I was in complete awe of the pole dancing.  I mean these chicks hang upside down with one leg wrapped around a pole, then throw their legs down into the splits, all while wearing 12 inch heels.  Yowzahs!  That's impressive.  Then we were off, like the stripper's pants, to another place.  By the time we left, the place was getting quite packed.

Hey have like 2 black girls and one of which had a beer gut and the other some bleach blonde hair looking like ol girl from players club. These chicks can't dance for nothing.

Like they come to your table and try to hang around all night even after you say you don't want a dance. Watch the servers because they will try to get you to buy drinks for the strippers

We had bottle service on both nights, I loved the private booth with curtains ! And this club was small, cozy and fun! Not overly crowded and the smokes were not that bad. I think bottle service is much better deal than paying covers and individual drinks, a 750ml Ketel one vodka, mixers, red bull, tips for $330. Of course plus lots of lap dances and tips for the girls. We took the unfished bottle back to our hotel. 

The girls there were super friendly, seemed they were all friends too. A little girl followed me back to our table, just decided to hang out the entire night, it was fun! She even used the money I tipped her to tip the girl on the stage? WTH! Haha, silly little girl! 

This is a must go for me every time I am in Vegas for sure! Always call them first to order packages or a bottle for complimentary limo pickup, and no cover charge.

Hot chicks with big boobs and tight abs! Hot men with washboard stomachs and pretty faces! Pretty much what you're looking for when going to these places. It was a last minute decision to head to a strip club so I decided to yelp a place and OG popped up! We were looking for a place that had male dancers so this place was perfect! I called Sophie and left her message stating that I was planning a birthday party of 6 and wanted to head to the club that evening. She was very accommodating towards my needs and sent for a limo! She had great deals and was super nice!

The Club: 
Downstairs is the Ladies of OG and upstairs is where we were headed. We were greeted by Pete who was super nice and hyped us up for a good time! He walked us over to the stage, we sat around the stage with our dollar bills waiting to see some hotties! Drinks were good! The men poured over to us and offered lap dances, don't leave here without getting one! Music was awesome, the boys definitely had some moves and the prices were manageable so bring your money and don't be afraid to spend! Tyler and Tyson were definitely the fan favorites! I kind of regret not taking up Tyler on his offer for a private dance! haha

CONS:
We did go there on a Sunday so they closed at 1am. I would liked just one more hour! Haha

Final Answer: Go!! And don't forget to call Sophie! She will definitely boost your experience! Oh and tell Tyler that Jenn says hello! haha  I'm going back in 2 weeks and will definitely call Sophie!!",8DPVGxH8zpCNUv6jUN4LqQ,4,4,4,KXrHrDeO3Mx0yvdVTLg87g

3501462,2014-05-04,4,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"I went this weekend for a bachelor party. We bought the $60pp deal with a limo ride and a $40 bar tab.

The limo was a bit dirty with a broken sunroof, whatever. We tipped the dude $10 for a 5 minute ride. He said call him with a half hour notice for a ride home. We did, then when we called him he said ""I'm busy"" and didn't pick us up, really pissing off our groom.

The bar tab: We weren't told the cost of the drinks until we asked. They would ask me if I wanted another while I had a full drink. And actually, they once brought me a drink without even asking me (seriously? You don't get to take my money without me consenting to that). I found the drinks a bit weak/small. They ranged from $10-$13 per.

The actual club: I'm not a big strip club guy generally, and went without wanting any lap dances or anything. I sat in the middle of people facing the table. When a girl asked me to move so she could sit on my lap I said no thank you politely, at which point she stared at me like she was disgusted at me, made a huffy noise, and walked off. A few girls came by and tried to do the same, despite me obviously not wanting this (not looking at them, reaching for my drink when they came by, being in an impossible to sit on my lap position, etc). One even told me ""you should relax"". Clearly this wasn't all of the girls, but the ones that were like this made me feel like a wallet. One or two I said ""I can't"", or ""I don't feel well, so no thank you"" and were cool about it. The bad apples really make you hate life though.

One stripper sought a dance from my friend, then said he should guy the groom a dance, then went to the groom to try to get our friend to buy it, making it a ""he's cheap"" or ""I got mu $20"" situation, which we didn't appreciate. Then she also said our friend should buy the groom a shot, and her a shot, and.... yeah, just a ridiculously uncomfortable money suck.

Another friend was taken into the back room (he assumed for a lap dance) and was asked to pay $700 for some ""package"" thing, then $300 for something else, then $140 for 15 minutes. He thought he was just getting a lap dance in a less public spot...... not the case. In general I think that's a theme here, the patron doesn't always know WTF is happening, and is made to feel uncomfortable for rejecting the girls seeking money thus getting the girls more money.

As for the dancing it ranges dramatically. There was a thin/fit girl with tattoos dancing to metal'ish music who was doing all sorts of tricky things and generally being a great stripper. There were also girls catering entirely to one rich drunk dude, who just sort of giggled their bits for 30 seconds straight, crotch pointing at said male.

One man, a loud drunk, was ruffling girls hair, and throwing dollars at their faces. This guy literally fell down drunk and was picked up by OG staff. They didn't kick him out mind you, and strippers then catered to him. I felt bad for the guy, it seemed like he was too drunk to consent to large ticket item dances and the like. I see this sentiment on other reviews.

There were some girl groups having fun (in the women dancer section), who were hit on by some club patrons. They seemed to have fun other than that (motorboated the strippers, etc). 

So there you have it. I'm not coming back, but maybe you'll like it more than I did. My advice to OGs is to have some way of filtering out girls who make our experience there awful. There are plenty of great girls, but you get enough girl who won't leave and makes you feel like a jerk for not dropping a ton of money, or limo driver who shines you on for a tip then leaves you high and dry, or falling down drunk patron allowed to go past the line, or watery required drinks, and it sort of takes you out of a good vibe.",BZcn5WW5JJdUO5NX4EHr4Q,9,0,1,nG6tjyiZ3FI7cEwmC7_Eaw

Once I get upstairs to the male strippers immediately go to the bar and ask the the bar tender if they have X rated martini. He replies no, so I let him attend the next customer to not hold him back from business . After he is done I ask ""do you  have any ciders"" he responds"" no"" , hmm okay I proceed to ask if they have mojitos!? What my respond "" NO THIS ISN'T TIJUANA""!? Seriously are you kidding me!?

You'll just spend a lot of money and be irritated about it, probably making your friends time less fun while you're at it (or afterwards with your negative comments). They wanna have a good time, don't whine/complain and ruin it for everyone else... 'eewww, there were guys up in my face/rubbing all over me...' DUH! You're in a strip club, they chat you up and dance like that because that's typically what girls want when they go there.  I hate it when girls bitch at strip clubs (girl or guy).  If you're gonna bitch and complain, just don't go.  If you can't be cool chill chick, go to a show while the guys go to the club.

I used to live in Vegas and loved to go to Olympic Garden occassionally to see my sexy Vietnamese dancer (Tiki) who worked upstairs. :)  I love ASIAN MEN!!

Or maybe he wasn't dirty just with me cause he could tell it wasn't necessary - might be with other girls. *shrug*  I miss him now... gonna have to make a trip to Vegas pretty soon. 

I'll post some pics of the club, just cause I'm that bored. LoL

Out of countless Vegas' options we decided to visit OG for the prospect of seeing male and female strippers under one roof. And to our surprise we so much enjoyed OG! Totally recommend it! 

Longer description: 

Before going to OG we did a yelp research on Vegas Strip Clubs and were a little hesitant even to go anywhere. Most of the reviews on almost all Strip Clubs are written by men that were ""milked"" by strippers for lots of money and obviously they were upset with the whole experience. We learned that most of the strip clubs would make you feel like you were their ""milking cow"" and strippers would be pushy and rude if we didn't spend a lot of money. Although we were hesitant, we decided to go ahead and try our luck; hence we were already in the Sin City!
We arrived at OG very early (9:30 PM) on Sunday hence we made other arrangements for that night (going to Hakkasan where we had a great time). I will be honest; both of us were nervous and were on a look out before entering the club. But as soon as we walked in, we were greeted by Tony a short-stocky man who was a manager that night. He was very pleasant and as we exchanged couple of words with him we started feeling at ease. He checked our IDs, stamped our wrists and said if we had to leave and comeback he would let us in anytime within 24 hours. He also didn't charge us the entry fee but asked us to buy few drinks while were there.

The club has 2 floors; the first one has female dancers and the second has male ones. So we were set at the table and immediately our server came by and asked us for drinks. The drinks came out really well done. Few minutes later one of the dancers stopped by our table to complement me (female) and chatted a little. She didn't ask to dance for us or anything because I think she saw that we were having a good time by ourselves. So she wished us good times and left. 

And here is what really made our experience even better. A young dancer set at our table and started chatting with us. She was really cute! She was laid back and we started talking about LV and all that. I actually was waiting to see if she was genuinely interested in a tourist couple or was it just to ease us up into endless lap dances. I was surprised that after quite some time she didn't even offered any. I think my BF felt that we needed to let her know that if she had other prospects she should move on and not waste her time on us. We were not gonna get any lap dances just because we wanted to go to that Techno Club first and on the way back, at night to come back to OG and only after that have even more fun. So politely he told her that we just chilling and didn't want to waste her time, to what she responded, ""Well I have nothing else to do at this time and if you don't mind I would like to just chit chat with you, before I go on the stage :)"". She said it in such a cute way that I felt very good about her and dancers in general. I wish we could have stayed and not go anywhere but we had to leave. So as soon as she went on stage, we tipped her and got moving. 

Before we left we decided to go upstairs and check out male dancers. There were girls sitting around the dance floor and one dancer on the stage. Other dancers were sitting behind the dance floor and just waiting for new costumers. As soon as we set down at the table, one and then the other dancer came by to chit chat and ask if we were going to order a dance. We politely rejected and kept on drinking at our table.

So to our regret, we could not make it back to OG that night but if we ever back in LV...OG is our choice of entertainment!",VKd0GB54PIUo1deujnQjPQ,12,3,4,_Wy5akPA9jlK6O9Hf1HVlg

He took care of our bachelorette party and especially the bride to be. He was amazing, nice and definitely sexy as hell. 

OG as a whole...cheesy. However, when you must, you must! I didn't like when the men horded our table upon arrival.  That was a little pushy. They are kind of in your face at first about lap dances. The drink service was also very slow. Get tanked ahead of time and take the free limo. Save money for g-string stuffing :P

We were taken to a booth and immediately 10 naked guys came up to us and solicited lap dances. Holy smokes! I get hounded at a regular club with guys trying to buy me drinks, you actually think I will PAY to get hounded? no thanks.

I had no real interest in visiting the club because I've gone on other occasions in years past, and while fun, I never considered it a must-do for every trip to Vegas.  But since it was my birthday, my girlfriend said ""let's just go for the heck of it...we'll stay for an hour...get a lap dance (maybe 2), call it a night...and leave for a nightclub.""  I agreed under those circumstances!

I honestly don't remember OG being this much fun on any of my previous visits.  We planned on staying for an hour and we ended up staying 'til the place shut down.  WHAT?  Had a great time!

Now I don't know why we were first asked to pay a $25 cover...and then told to pay $30.  I clearly heard about 3 door guys state to the staff that we arrived in a limo.  We then again confirmed directly with the cashier we came in a limo.  But then we were told it was $30.  Didn't quite understand.  But we paid anyway.

Upon arrival, do take your time and scope out the guys you really like - and get a VIP dance.  I had one $20 dance (upon my arrival) and that was the only $20 dance I got all night.  My girlfriend then took it upon herself to get me a VIP dance with Carlos...and all I can say is, ""I did not care how much the VIP dance cost""... the remainder of all my dances (with about 4 other guys) were all VIP, which is a reflection that there is a nice selection of eye candy over there.  THAT SAID, I'm embarrassed to admit how much we spent that night.  The boys (at least the handful of boys that were fortunate to connect with us that night) made REALLY good money from us.  They were all kind and wonderful and their fun personalities, good dancing (and hot bodies) made it all worth it.

OG should've comped our covers when we left simply for the amount of business we generated for the guys that night...considering it was only 2 of us ;-)  Of course, I say this now, because we barely had any money back for transportation back to our hotel...hahaha.  The only reason I took one star away was because of the cover confusion...and I didn't think the club (waitresses, cashier, bar) took any particularly good care of us considering how much we were spending (I mean, I could've bought a pair of Louis Vuitton shoes...maybe 2 pairs).  Or offered us transportation back to the hotel, I dunno...something!  Not sure I would go out of my way to return, but maybe if there was some promo offered or a comped cover(s) for my group...I mean, considering I would guarantee paying for the VIP dances ;-)

In an anxious, mortified, state, I talked with the manager. Who at first was sympathetic, and then kept asking me questions to imply that what I said, had not happened. That I was imagining things. Even while a security guard had seen the whole confrontation.

THE DEAL - We got a deal through a promoter, www.freevegasclubpasses.com (see my review for them, too); for $25 per person, we got a limo pick up, cover, and two drinks each.  Good deal, right?  Well, once we got there, it got even better!  The women were escorted upstairs by a very nice man who explained that we could have two drinks each OR upgrade to a booth with a bottle of vodka and three mixers for $36 (or something close to that).  Of course, we jumped on that!  Once we were seated, we got our bottle and mixers very quickly.  Our waiter was a peach; he upgraded one of the mixers for Red Bull and we tipped generously.  

THE DANCERS - A couple of dancers came over right away to ask if anyone wanted a lap dance, but did not pressure us when we told them ""not yet"".  The dancers were gorgeous!!  Big, built, tight, nice smiles.  Carlos, in particular, caught the eye of a couple of us and he was SUPER sweet!  Yes, these guys are there to make money, but a good dancer makes the customer feel comfortable and sexy.  These guys, especially Carlos, did just that!  Total class!  We got two of us (me included) on the stage for $40 a pop, plus a couple of lap dances at the booth for $20 each.  Good deal!  Plus, I told Carlos ""nothing raunchy"" (I was getting married the next day, after all!) and he kept it very classy.  I was grateful!  Oh, and I'd also like to give a special ""oh my!"" shout out to The Lumberjack. Wow...just freakin' wow!

THE ATMOSPHERE - The crowd was FUN!  There were lots of brides and birthday girls, so lots of special dances up on the stage.  No one got out of control and I didn't see anyone get sloppy.  There was a good feeling of camaraderie.  Everyone was just there to have fun, no drama!

DOWNSTAIRS - After I touched The Lumberjack and proclaimed that I was content with the male dancer experience, I headed downstairs.  My fiancé informed me that they got a bottle deal, too, but it was significantly more expensive for them (I know how it works: we have boobs, we pay less).  Still, they felt they got a good deal.   He told me that the dancers were good, the lap dances were generous (both time wise and effort) and that he was drunk and content.  

I can honestly say that I will be going back to OG whenever I'm in Vegas, big group or not.  It was a blast and we felt very comfortable and taken care of.  Everyone had a blast and can't stop talking about all the fun memories that were made!",ZcseVLaFrjI8_cDhyFImNg,4,0,5,55Cvi18AU7nwhEkMqykYFQ

Tip: Before you buy a lap dance, make sure you watch them dance for a bit beforehand, as there are some serious discrepancies in talent, ranging from a Cirque du Soleil reject (that's a compliment, by the way) to an actual turrets sufferer.",2h2ROFo-VvEgFHzGcw1pfQ,12,4,1,g9lbbmVPo2FpDF5xSaUjWg

The interior is your usual large room with blacklights and neon affair, while hip hop and metal blast away, one to two girls dancing on stage and plenty of girls circulating.  The exterior is sort of tacky and tawdry but it matches the complexion of the local ghetto nicely.  Mostly 8's.

What really strikes me about this club is how perverted and greedy the girls are.  Put your wallets in your front pocket and keep an eye on them fellas. 

I actually had a stripper tell me that ""I hope you fall in love with me and get the VIP for an hour for $600"", which I thought was a bit of a stretch.

The next girl said some dirty things to me which I don't think I can repeat here on Yelp.  It was as sexy as it was nasty and I think I blushed.  It made it worse/better that she was beautiful.  She said she'd offer me a deal on VIP, 30 mins for only $260 (you're required to buy 3 drinks at $20 each).  Her sales pitch was so evil/nuanced/good that it took all my sense of moderation to decline.  And I never fall for that sort of thing.

So if you're ready for total perversion and debauchery, come to the OG's.  It's the naughtiest club I've been to in Vegas, just be careful, these girls are pros.  Come here if you're ready for perversion and to spend for it.",Ti5Bpj0eRmRYTBnep63S1Q,8,9,3,2PsE_cO1nTgGMdjUb3B9gw

In Vegas last weekend (3rd time this year, I'm seriously a seasoned pro now at 21 but anyways), this time for a bachelorette party. We on our last night went to Thunder Down Under and had a BLAST, and of course after leaving were all hoping for more and decided to come to Olympic Gardens- this place. I didn't realize that's what OG means here but it does. Anyways, when we arrive security walks us right in because we showed up in a limo, and then we pay $40 per person and get two drink vouchers each worth $15. 

The place is split with women strippers on the bottom floor, and male strippers on the top.
First thing we do is go to the bar and cash in our generous vouchers. The $15 worth is good for well drinks, basically, and only so long as there are like two ingredients, i.e. vodka cranberry, rum and coke. But whatever, we were there to see some abs and sock penis' (see further review).

After getting our weak, 5 ounce drinks we head upstairs. Considering how crowded it was there was actually quite a bit of seating. There's a stage in the center of the room, and a bar in the corner. Currently on stage is a man who is very obviously packing more than junk in his speedo-thong thing. Like he raided someones suitcase for three pairs of socks and shoved them in there.
Lots of other guys are wandering around, offering 2 minute lap dances for $25 bucks (way cheaper than the girls downstairs though so I've heard.)

At one point I had to access the ATM, there's a girl in front of me who tries and it doesn't work, even though she had entered her pin and only had to wait for the money to drop out, but alas, nothing comes out. So she complains to management who tells her she's SOL, I stood there with her to back up her story and witnessed them saying they weren't going to do shit about it. As I sit down to let my group in on the BS I just witnessed a waitress walks up and I ask her about it. She said that happens all the time with that specific ATM, and tells me where the best one in the club is.

When I go downstairs to use said recommended ATM, I see this row of strippers standing around and in passing slightly tap one of their butts, I didn't think any thing of it, that's what I do to my girlfriends. But this crack whore chased me down and started yelling at me in my face about how ""disrespectful (because I didn't pay her $50 first) how dare you touch me without paying, blah blah more of how I'm disrespectful I am but I LOVE YOU blah blah (more yelling)"" Like okay, but you're a stripper? Isn't that sort of disrespecting yourself?
Then she walked away and I was just standing there like what the f**k was that.

Well, we leave after seeing none of the group upstairs is having a much better time.

We did have bottle service and the waiter was very attentive and the bus boys were very good at making sure we had clean glasses, ice and straws at all time.

     By the end of the night I wasn't dragging my feet thinking of the stress of an Ex and Malia wasn't stressed about that divorce.  Thanks to OG for fulfilling our needs and more lol
    There's a stage and gals all around.  I returned with a Bachelorette party and same thing.  High energy laughing our asses off all night.  I get called up on stage, sit in a chair and Mr. Exotic whispers some stuff only we would know and says ""You've been here a few times. I remember you"" lol !!!!  I remembered all of him too lol. Every inch lol. 
     The VIP here is awesome. Bottle service was great.  This led to the best ever 3 am X rated. Triple Triple X rated limo drive up and down the strip I have ever experienced.  Let your thoughts run wild with that one coz that's what happened plus stuff Hollywood couldn't even make up lol!  Love OG! Outside is non-descript. But ooooh the happiness that awaits you inside. Go in! You will stumble out laughing your butts off feeling like that is how every night should be. Ciao!",TeHp5f1KY_7Mh-swUWSjuA,8,10,4,0oFzT5ptg9sJY3N61VWNoA

Just tell her the details of your visit and how many girls and she'll quote you a very reasonable price. Both times, a limo was provided. The driver was on-time and very friendly. When we arrive at Olympic Gardens, our reservation was ready under our name, per Sophie's instructions. For repeat customers, she makes an effort to provide friendly incentives, like a free round of shots or a garter for the bride. With Sophie's help, our night at Olympic Gardens is always fun!

A promoter hooked us up w/ a limo that would pick us up from our hotel (Mandalay Bay) and take us back when we were ready. We just had to pay the $25 entry fee and 2 drinks minimum/person. This was reasonable. We get there and the guys seem to flock at you like flies on poo. They are practically begging to give you a lap dance or try to convince you that you should buy one for your friend. A lap dance on stage is $40, on the floor/$20. Steep, but it was the bachelorette's night. Like all strip clubs, there's gonna be some nice bodies and hurt faces. There was an occasional newbie who was clueless on stage. It wasn't my cup of tea, but the bachelorette was happy, so that's all that mattered...Until we were ready to leave. 

This is what you need to watch out for! So we're ready to head back but they're saying that our driver has been missing for the past 3 hrs and had been non responsive. In order for us to get back, we have to pay an extra $5/person (7 girls) =$35 for their other shuttle to take us. I explained that we were supposed to get a ride back at no charge and he proceeds to say that free shuttle rides only go to Cesar's. THAT IS IRRELEVANT to anything we've been told. He tries to convince us that taking a cab back would be $60 to get all of us back. At this point, I realize we've been scammed and we end up taking their stupid f%king shuttle.

Apparently, they have male strippers on the floor above us and that may have affected the quality of the strippers here. 

After being approached by a dozen strippers, I felt I needed to run off and approach strippers that I was physically attracted to, as did the Bachelor. After getting the Bachelor a few dances, it was our turn, so I ended up getting an amazing dance by a Costa Rican named Emmy.  I tipped her well and rejoined the group. 

Now is where everything went down hill. I was approached by a stripper named ""violet"" who was not physically attractive at all. She kept pulling my hair aggressively, choking me, slapping me, and feeling on me as I politely told her I was not interested in a dance. She told me I needed to tip so I grabbed a few singles and gave it up. 

As I put my money away, she reached into my pocket to grab the stash of ones and said I owed her more than that and walked off with my stack of 20. I tried to grab it back as she aggressively robbed me and walked off. 

I then spoke to the club  manager, Anthony, and he spoke to her as she spewed her lies and poured poison into his ears. He was able to retrieve half of the money she stole as she told him I was feeling on her the entire time. Look, if I wanted a dance, I would buy it from a bombshell, not a retired cam whore who probably couldn't make a living on her physical appearances. 

They get an extra star for having some good dancers who never approached and the corrective action management tried to instill. But hiring thieves who reach into pockets to take what they feel like makes this place rather primitive. Please do yourself a favor and hit up sapphire or spearmint rhino instead. You'll see many many more bombshells there instead.

Props to the manager Anthony for at least attempting to straighten out some of his more ratchet strippers.",ROpZTzNuhcsQngRhbioGGA,7,1,2,5B4V-r_FVM83-gMmFrqlMQ
4797671,2012-05-28,3,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"** Review only applies to the male strippers upstairs***

Fun/Cost: (4/5) I came here with a group of 13 girls for a Bachelorette party and we had such a crazy time. Admission is ""free"" but you've got to pay at the door for the 2 drink minimum, which is $25. They at first seated us at the couches in the back due to our large party size, but we moved up to the seats around wishbone-shaped stage after about 20 minutes when another party left. Then the craziness began. We bought countless lap dances for the bachelorette. Then we bought some for the bridal party. Then we bought one for one girl in out group who thought one of the strippers was hot (they do have amazing bodies here). There were dollar bills flying, girls cheering, cameras flashing (yes, strangely they allowed pictures), and bodies all over. The guys actually position the girls on the chairs in various compromising positions and then lift the girls or their legs up, they'll grab girls hands and put them on their butts; they'll dance on girls so hard that the chair starts spinning; they'll lay a girl down on stage and grind up on them 69 style; they'll grab dollar bills with their teeth wherever the dollar bills are hidden on the girl (wherever). I'm not quite sure what the monetary damage was at the end of the night -- lap dances  are $20, $40 on stage, and then as many $1 that you want to contribute. According to my friend was had been here before, they really feed off the energy of your group; the rowdier and louder you cheer, the more crazy and sexual the strippers become. I guess we were pretty darn loud and rowdy. 

Ambiance: (3/5) We came a few weeks ago on the last Saturday of April around 10pm and the upstairs area with the male strippers was pretty much full. (The downstairs is the female stripper area and then upstairs you have the male strippers. As you can imagine, all the men patrons are downstairs and all the female patrons are upstairs.) There were a lot of bachelorette parties going on upstairs, but also a lot of just pairs and small groups of women who appeared to just be enjoying a girls night out. Other than the general dark, dimly lit, clandestine vibe of the place, you pretty much create your own ambiance. If your group is sultry and quietly sexual, you'll get that type of experience. If your group is loud and crazy, you'll get that experience. If your group is timid and surreptitious, you'll have a slightly awkward experience. I guess you could just come and watch here (some of the guys will periodically dance on stage) but then you might be better served just going to a male revue show like Chippendales. 

Location: (2/5) Olympic Garden is in downtown Las Vegas, so its completely off the nice Strip and in a darker, seedier part of town. I guess that makes sense...it is a strip club after all. 

Service: (4/5) It appears as if a lot male reviewers have had problems here with using credit cards at this establishment and subsequently getting overcharged for services or items. Good thing we just used good old cash and didn't encounter any of those problems! We also contacted Olympic Garden ahead of time and they arranged for a limo to pick us up at Encore casino, which was convenient and cost-efficient. When we got here, we were treated courteously and even when we took forever deciding on what drinks to order, the waitress didn't lose her cool with us. So for us girls, we had a great service experience here.  

Overall: (3.5/5) I'll probably never come back here again as most my other friends aren't crazy enough as to go to a strip club if even for their bachelorettes, but it was an eye-opening, one-in-a-lifetime experience. If you do come, just be open minded and just keep in mind that most parties come here just for fun and for special occasions -- don't judge!",VuK9XwHrvWAQpYeuGfA1dQ,6,0,4,4RQJTxfwgJAphw-OMpF4EA

This is my second time frequenting a strip club so now that I am actually more aware this time of my surroundings and not drunk off my ass then I'd have to say that I would rather be downstairs watching the ladies lol.

I came here for a bachelorette party as I really had no intentions to get any lap dances from anyone.  Entrance fee was $30.  After we all were served our drinks that cost an arm and a leg, we had strippers trying to rape us each of $20 for lap dances. My gf was approached by a stripper with an accent asking her if she had $20 and proceeded to tell her in his thick accent that he wanted to give me a lap dance because in his words ""I can really fu** her up"", but good thing my girl didn't oblige lol.  I would have kicked her butt! Lol... 

After having the maximum number of drinks allowed which is 2 (who is really counting?), I separate and gallavant with 2 other gf's to the stage to watch the surprise unfold... Damn these fu**ers are huge! I'm talking muscle huge here ok!?! As I walked around to the other side of the stage, I get hit in the arm by one of the resident strippers doing his lame fancy footwork move in the air.  He kicked me so hard that it bugged & bruised me for that whole week &1/2! I rained on the other girls' parade and smacked the daylight out of the guy who then tried to get a dollar out of me, but didn't get anything back but his ass being ripped another hole.  I laughed at the whole matter and just decided to take a shot (drink #3) to relieve the annoyance I was having out of the male strippers.  

After that whole ordeal, one of my gf's and I head downstairs to chill and just watch the ladies do their thang.  I was really surprised to see how many couples were there enjoying their lap dances together!  It was fairly mellow downstairs and not anything near the party going on upstairs lol.  Our party had some first timers who were pretty nervous at first, but after a teaspoon of alcohol, one unleashed the stripper out of herself and began to give the resident stripper a show for his own money.  It was HIGHlarious son lol!!!  She came in not wanting to be touched by a stripper only coming out having being touched by a majority and then some! 

Depending on your preference, if you're coming with a party make sure to call in and check for prices and/or make reservations if you really have to.

How to treat women and make money for your business. Everybody laughed and they were committing me because he was an asshole. I own a business and I will fire my employee if they acted like that on the spot. You let him know when he can buy a house cash in Sant Helena CA 94574. Than he can ack like a bitch.

What's even better is how easy it was to set up the perfect package for my girlfriend's birthday.  Sophie was terrific!  Easy to work with and she delivered!

Here's how it worked:  The limo picked us up at our hotel on the strip and delivered us to the door of the club.  We went inside and the door girl found our names on the list.  We were escorted up an elevator to our seats at the stage.  At 9:30, the party was in full swing.  A waiter took our drink order and we were off!

4855009,2010-10-06,7,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"Our joint bachelor-bachelorette party was basically a bachelor party, plus all the men's hot wives/fiances/girlfriends in tiny black dresses. So of course, we went to a strip club. Now I tend to think that boobies promote a universal giddiness in people, male or female, so I wasn't opposed to this adventure at all. 

Some guy in old downtown Vegas offers us a limo to bring us to Olympic Gardens. We're done playing craps, so why not now?

We roll in there with 20+ people. The men try to work out a deal with the hosts. The hosts tell us it will cost around $600.00 for the whole group, and that will get us VIP seating and 2 bottles. Woah, what?!? Apparently that's normal for strip clubs, but my virgin eyes were buggin! 

The hosts lead us to the VIP booths near the main stage, but the only way to get us in them was to split us into two groups. There was no way to see each other or interact with each other if they did that. The view of the stage also wasn't that great. We didn't like that at all.  So they take us from the main stage to the second stage, which isn't as crowded. There aren't too many dancers wandering around back there, and only one on the stage. After a while, it seemed like we were the only ones back there. For what we paid and what a group our size was prepared to spend, we were pretty irritated. 

But being self-starters, after a couple guys at the table got lap dances ($20 a song), we picked up all of our bottles and glasses and moved to the main stage. We managed to find enough tables and chairs for all of us. Two dancers on stage, and lots wandering around. Perfect. 

After that, we were pretty much able to do whatever the heck we wanted. I don't know what I expected strippers to look like, but I think that there were only two that matched my expectations. I thought I would see a lot more curvacious figures. I was surprised to find mostly tight, gymnast-like bodies and almost flat chests, and some with just slim boyish figures. That made sense for the women who worked the pole, and were basically acrobats. There was one dancer dressed like a naughty schoolgirl who did aerials like she was a member of Cirque du Soleil, and just worked OG on the weekends for shoe money. She was absolutely incredible. But besides her, there was probably only one person who I would pay $20 to keep in my direct line of sight for 3-4 minutes at a time. Your tastes may vary. 

I am told by the men in our group that Olympic Gardens is one of the nicer strip clubs in Vegas. The only strip clubs I have in my memory to compare to this one are seedy clubs (read: brothels) in Spain staffed by women who were very obviously trafficked from South America, so this did seem pretty nice by comparison. But I was expecting this place to feel luxurious, and it definitely did not feel that way.   

I also learned a very important lesson on this adventure. Ladies, if you've been objecting to that bachelor party your significant other is about to throw or have thrown for him, listen up. Strip clubs are not about sex. Not even a little bit. They are not about sexiness or making men feel sexy. They are EVERY inch about, like every other game in Vegas, separating a person from his money. It just so happens boobs are a very efficient way to do it. 

I put it out there that I am a feminist. I do wonder and worry about the exploitation in commercial sex work and all that goes on behind the scenes. But I tell ya, when I was in there, it definitely felt like the women had all the power in the room.  

And by the way, you probably will not be shocked to learn that the guys did not offer the fact that there was a male stripper section of Olympic Gardens until after our party left.",2uZEpLX3znS3WuIXMWWp6Q,7,4,3,ih35-y3xFmk9qTjUGKNUmA

He was friendly and extremely talented. He also spent a lot of time talking to us, which made it a better time for all of us. 
A couple of things that made our time less than stellar were that the second that we sat down, dancers were all over us, trying like crazy to get us to buy a lap dance, and I get it- this is how they make their money, which is fine. But give a girl a chance to settle in and get comfortable. Most of us don't do this all the time and we need a second to sit down and see a few dancers before we even know who we want a lo dance from. Our group probably had 10 lap dances between the 4 of us, and I definitely think we would have chosen the guys who we liked the best if we had had a minute to figure out who that was. For our group- we probably would have used 7 of the 10 dances for JT. Unfortunately, we had already spent several hundred dollars before we ever saw him. So when he came out, we were done spending money. 
The other thing that didn't sit right with me is that i ordered a $20 lap dance for the birthday girl, for which I gave the guy a $50 bill. He never came back with change. After that, I was hesitant to ask for another dance. The rest of the group ordered dances all night, but after the first lap dance costing $50, I wasn't hip to order another one. 
Again- JT salvaged the whole night. He was legitimately the best thing about the place. If you're going here for a fun time, just walk in and ask for JT. He will deliver.",8akQtVSeIJG_HtfhSFB3kg,2,1,4,-aHCz7yEMEVTHuz6ERidBQ

8 of us came here saturday night, as part of my cousin's bachelorette getaway in vegas. we paid for the limo/cover package. limo ride from the hotel to OG, and when we arrived, we were treated in a so-so manner. but we didn't really mind at that time. the moment we were shown to our table, hoards of men started invading our table and pushing us to buy each other lap dances. when i say pushing, i mean almost forcing you, literally won't let go of your hand until you agree to a lap dance or buy someone else a lap dance. my cousins just wanted to go all out and we knew this was all good fun so all of us got lap dances and we paid an extra $35 for the bachelorette to be taken to the stage and get another lap dance there. so i guess that was fun. our package also included $240 worth of alcohol from the bar (which didn't really amount to much because their drinks are so overpriced).  

ok now the bad part. so after all the lap dances and drinking that we got from that $240 tab, we decided there wasn't really much else to do but leave. so we did. our package said that the limo would be taking us back to the hotel, and everybody else at the front desk and the guy who was in charge of the front door said we should just wait for our driver. so we waited, 90degrees in vegas last saturday night, and waited, and waited. until my cousins decided to call the limo driver himself and ask him what's taking too long. he said he's on his way back but not for us. he basically said we won't be getting limo service back to the hotel. WTF! so yeah, whatever right. why couldn't they just have said that there won't be a limo service back, we wouldn't have waited in that heat! and the front door guy just looked like he didn't really care at all. none of them would care for you since you already spent money there. really really bad customer service. if you can find another strip-club, then they probably will be way better than this joint. 

one tip: you can just rent out your own limo service and not get it as a package with OG to avoid this. we certainly learned our lesson.",rAGR4nggiBMKj5eqv9WW_g,3,0,1,cNffHT2kvw5NXASJ-EY8xw

Devirginized to male strip clubs at OG and I kind of want that flower back...

I went here with a bachelorette party and we only stayed in the male strip club area after a night of clubbing (around 2am)

Here's the break down:
1) Money spent:
We got a deal for $25/person for two drinks and entrance, which I didn't think was too shabby.  However, when we got our drinks, we totally regretted it.  We all got vodka cranberries and they all tasted like rubbing alcohol.  Granted we were super inebriated and we couldn't even hold this vodka down.  When the bride wasn't feeling well, I went to ask for water, which you have to pay by the bottle.  I spent $10 for 6oz. of water!!! UGHHHHHH 

2) Strippers:
This was such a cuuuhhhhrazyyyyy experience for me.  The male strippers were grabbing the girls on the sides and pulling them halfway up on the stage, smacking their booties and motorboating them. SOOO CRAZY and UNEXPECTED.  My friend, the bride, was freaked out and could not handle being near the stage, so we went back to our booth.  The guys walked around and asked if she wanted a lap dance but we adamantly refused!  The girls next to us got ""lap dances"" which basically entailed the guy banging up on the girl for about 5 minutes while all of her friends screamed, laughed, and took pictures.  The guys were okay looking, but didn't have very good dance moves.  Imagine someone who was trained by a Britney Spears dancer wannabe who mainly point toward their penile area.  

Oh goodness, I can go on forever about my experience here.  All in all, it was very entertaining, but just so crazy.  I'm debating on whether or not I would want to go again for another friend's bachelorette.  We'll see....",9M9JmaJ3uWQABX0HN8IF8A,3,2,3,3tD7dT7XaQMzIS_MFlWeYg
4956443,2013-07-07,0,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"Well, let's just say we had fun. I was planning my sister's bachelorette party and of course a strip club was on the agenda. I looked all over the place and found a lady named sophie that offered a package for $40, which included limo to the venue, no line, no cover, free shot and $25 credit to the bar. Not too shabby, until they off her a bottle for $45 with mixers. The only catch is that you no longer get the shot or the $25 credit to the bar. At this point I had a lot to drink so I wasn't in the mood to haggle or find out why we paid more then lost out on both those things.
Definitely use cash, using a card could be just plain messy. Also when you are seated the men come straight to you and try to get dances out of you, just tell them no; some will leave with an attitude and others will just kindly walk away
The dancers were up to par body wise, but some of their attitudes were down right shitty. I get the fact that your there about making money but some of us are there for our friends. There were some that had good ""personalities"" so obviously they received more attention. If your there celebrating something they pull the main girl on stage but that costs an extra $40, this place definitely tries to squeeze money out of you DO NOT FALL FOR IT !!
Definitely worth trying once in your life.

PS...Limo does not take you back to the strip, I texted him to see how much a ride back would be and he quoted me for $80, ha yeah right",t4SJCZWTjjBv5Oe6M_10hg,2,0,3,8V5hFNPSHRuNkUIRDgq4_Q

4973815,2008-10-09,8,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"After living in Vegas for over a year and a half, I finally made it out to Olympic Gardens courtesy of Marge M.'s bachelorette weekend.

After arriving by a private limo, they charged me $30 just to get in!  (I actually called ahead to inquire about their cover charges and was told that it's free before 10 pm and $10 afterwards for local ladies.  What a crock of shit!)  And despite having a party of ten girls, we still couldn't get any discount!  Blah!  (They said it had to do with arriving in our own limo versus a taxi or some crap like that.)  

As we headed upstairs to watch the male strippers, it's hard to miss the signs saying there was a two drink minimum upstairs.  Lap dances are $20 each.  The cocktail waiter did his best trying to get us to do the bottle service, but it would have cost more for our group in the long run.

After our drinks arrived, that's when the bulls start crowding.  It's as if they signal each other to attack all at once.  They pinpoint the bride and get lap dances on her right away.  All the other guys start finding out who the maid of honor is so she can get a side by side dance with the bride.  At this point, you're getting your first up close look at the dancers and you want to be picky before you have them gyrating against your body, right?  When the crowding finally stops, you can watch what's going on onstage.  Some dancers really do a good show while others could use some help.

In retrospect, it might be better to sit up by the stage with dollar bills in hand and tip the dancers as they do their thing in front of you.  You'll last a lot longer and get a little something extra. 

For the $20 lap dance, sometimes you get something that is over the top and leaving you breathless while others leave you rather disappointed.  If anything, it might give your girlfriends something to laugh at.  Promises of ""I'm gonna fuck her up!"" were a common thread we heard throughout the night.  (Uh, the girl is getting married and I don't really want her all fucked up!  I just want her entertained!)

Keep your eyes out for Chili who hangs on his own.  He doesn't show up with the bull crowd, but swings by later to actually talk to the ladies.  He's a smart businessman and is a bit more acrobatic than most.  You'll recognize him by the handstands he's doing on the little tables.

We arrived on a Friday night before 10 pm.  Things were slow then and picked up by midnight.  How much personal attention you want will depend on what time you arrive.

Overall, OG was a disappointing experience.  Sure, some guys gave a good show while others were average.  We didn't hang out downstairs to check out the ladies, but I wish we did.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,9,3,ezJuaYlD2XkbhuDfY-Fomw
4996011,2012-11-17,5,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"My review is for the MALE REVIEW (Exotic Male strippers show)

Olympic Garden's is my #1 choice for  Bachelorette/Girls Night out!

Entry: FREE with purchase of 2 drink minimum at the door ($25)
Basically you pay $25 for 2 drinks of your choice (domestic beer, wine, and well spirits) and your entry fee is waived.

Days: Wednesday-Sunday
Hours: 8pm-3am

They offer complimentary house limo pick up at your hotel, just tip the limo driver. Message me if you want my friend Joey's number and I will happily connect you with him! When you come in a house limo you will pay the $25 at the door and a host will walk you upstairs to a table or chair seat on the rail. The waitress will greet your group and offer each girl 2 drinks of your choice or to put your tab total towards bottle service. If you choose the 2 drinks you have to order them both at the same time but they don't have to be the same thing so you can order a shot and drink if they suites your fancy. The waitress gratuity is not included in the $25 so make sure you take care of her accordingly. 

The strippers are not allowed to approach you until you have a drink in your hand. Once you are good and liquored up then WATCH OUT! These guys are there to work and they can be pretty aggressive at times. They will woo you with a gorgeous smile and rock hard body by smoothly asking if they can do a dance for you. Watch out for a tag team where they ask you to buy each other dances. Just make sure you talk to each other about who is buying who what. If you don't want a dance then a polite no thanks or not right now works well. 

TIP #1: Take a few minutes and check out the scenery and approach the guy you want versus buying something from the first guy who asks. 

While inside the show you have the option of sitting at the rail and donating $1's to the various entertainers as they shake their junk! Feel free to strategically place dollars between the bride to be's boobies for added excitement ;) If you are really feeling frisky then pick a guy for a personal dance for $20 which is 1 song long or they will usually do deals for 2 songs for $30. You can do a private dance away from the group if you want. 

For the birthday girl/guest of honor/bachelorette I suggest a stage dance for $40 where she is called up and seated in a chair center stage for 3 minutes of dry humping which might be slightly embarrassing, but wildly hilarious fun. 

TIP #2: !f you want a stage dance order is as soon as you arrive since sometimes it takes awhile for them to rotate to your dancer. 

TIP #3: You are allowed to take pictures and video if you wish to get proof of your crazy Vegas adventures!


I hope I yelped you!

The positives are that the men here are GORGEOUS. Incredible specimens. My mouth was ajar the entire night. One of the men in particular, Jimmy, was absolutely incredible. Not only was he the most attractive guy in that place, he was a total sweetheart and gave my friend the best lap dance in the history of lap dances. Ladies, invest in a Jimmy lap dance. It's worth every penny. We spent the entire night laughing. It was great. The minute we got there the guys swarmed us- I could see some people feeling overwhelmed, but we loved it. 

Now, on to the negative. This club is absolutely, positively homophobic. The 1 male we brought with our party (one of my best friends on this earth- he is an incredible human being and is drop dead gorgeous) was completely ignored the entire night. The guys on stage wouldn't even touch the money that he put out for them. When I inquired about getting him a lap dance, the dancers said that they were not allowed to dance for men. I confronted the guy running security, asking why my friend was being so poorly treated, and his response was that ""this is a straight club"".

The way they talk to you is super rude and all my girls thought so too. I pre-paid online and they were totally confused what I pre-paid for even though it was from their website! They act like you are bothering them when trying to correct THEIR MISTAKE. 

The server was arguing with me about how I had a $20 bar card for 6 people (this is after arguing with him about how I pre-paid online because they lost my receipt somehow with the 1st person I gave it to and said that I didn't pre-pay), but if he saw my receipt he should have seen it was a $30 bar card for 7 people. They should be better organized for people who pre-pay. The receipt that was emailed to me was also un-clear they should fix that. I think the confusion is because if you order from other means, such as promoters you can get in for $30 with a $20 bar card/per person. Their website is $40 for a $30 bar card per person, so they really have no idea which deal you got when you go in. 

I also called into the club prior, and they also lie and tell you they will be packed for the night so you should pay for a table when there is plenty of places to sit! OBVIOUSLY you would be sitting if you got dances, duh. Next time I come I will definitely be more experienced and not pre-pay through their website which is a complete mistake. The dancers are good looking and nice. You would think the service would be better since you are going to be dropping some serious dough here! They take your money and at the end of the night you don't really know what happened....but are still happy w/ the memories. haha

Expect $10 bottled waters....and $200 bottles with mandatory gratuities of 20% if you order a bottle. Just felt like to be spending all that money the service should have been better with the staff and more organized. They should also have a person escort the ladies to the 2nd floor because when we walked in we just stood there and had no idea where to go. I had to go find someone to ask.

The second you get in you'll be asked by your host what drinks you want.

There were a couple instances that a male stripper came by and asked why we looked slightly bored and I told him. The bride did NOT have fun and the fact that we only bought 2 dances but somehow paid for 6. We even pointed at the ones we wanted.

I'm not a strip club frequenter and don't plan on being. But this place was tons of fun! I went with my girlfriends. We originally started off at Palomino... That is a story in itself...

As we enter this glitzy semi-run down place, I thought - This is exactly what a strip club should be. Sleezy and a tad tacky, but it's just giving u what you want - sexy fun :)

I felt safe. Haha.. You will understand why if you read my Palomino review. The first floor is female strippers. Upstairs are male strippers. So we scurried up to see the beef. 

It was a large dimly lit room w/black walls. Ahh.. of course a center stage with lights and women screaming & shouting with pure joy and excitement. It was friendly and clean. Our waitor brought us to the table and no more than a min later of sitting, we were surrounded by pulsating muscles with tiny g strings on. lol.. It was kinda weird. They were trying to seduce us by caressing and kissing your hands neck and whatevers.... 

Next things you know... butts, legs, ding a lings were everywhere. I will not go into details, but it was amusing. I learned a few tricks from these limber boys to try myself :) 

My favorite part of the night were the shows!! Sooo fun! All the gals gathered up around the stage and watched each performance in amazement. They were great dancers and really knew how to put on a show! You got your typical firefighter, marine, and even an NSYNC performance... 

The there was crazy chick who was by herself. She befriended us and told us it's her birthday. She also told us about KONA. According to her, he's god's gift to mankind. She loves him and he always puts her in a good mood. She was an odd one. 

Anyways... A while later guess who comes on stage! K O N A ! 
Yuppp he was pretty awesome. He did a modern hip hop break dance performance. It was great! Very talented! All the ladies went wild.

I would of went to the top floor where the male strippers were but we got to this place at 4AM and that's when the men's floor closes. 

I am not  one to judge on looks but this is a strip joint and you are paying top dollar for women to sit with your or sit on you but god damn there were some butter faces there!!! I'm there for them to be pleasing to my eye.. not making me want to cover them! It's not like I'm going to shoot politics with them.

I went with a friend of mine and NO ONE approached him until I went to the bathroom (it's always nice to go to the ladies restroom at strip joints because normally the strippers share the same bathroom as you).

I came back and 2 strippers were on each of my friend's leg.  They were both some tall us girls. One girl I think was from Czech and the other girl was from Brazil.  These chics were HELLA tall!  

We had regular lapdances (boo!!!) and it was okay. $25 for a regular lapdance (our admission was $20 to get in) I wasn't turned on or anything by my dance. BUMMER! I tried to get into it but I just felt like she was cutting off my circulation in my leg.  So all I asked in return was for the stripper to reveal the secret to me of how their scent stays on you even AFTER you shower.  She said ""oh you just keep re-applying.""

Lies I tell you! All lies! They ain't giving up the secret unless you decide to join their world!   Where are my clear shoes damn it! I wanna know! =(",GQwiY_PvTUtdtnt8cCjmfQ,4,4,3,nPArNpO5UvMn_HP3Hd9-_g

Unfortunately, she was not working this past week but I have a little advice to those young girls I saw auditioning in the late afternoon.

Whether you're a single mom with four kids and no child support or a teenage runaway looking for a quick buck to score some meth, the exciting world of erotic dancing can be a lucrative career choice.

Becoming an erotic dancer is a dream for many girls but for those that have the stamina, vision and dedication for the long hours and pole-chaffing routines, there may be a dirty wad of twenties in your future. The first step to becoming an erotic dancer is choosing a good stage name. Your name of choice should be exciting, exotic and as any professional dancer will tell you, classy. Names that fall into these categories include fruit, cars and precious stones.

The Fruit Category: Not all fruits make good names for dancer. For instance, who wants some chick named Bananas or Apricot grinding on the old Johnson, not me. Choose a cute name like Cherry or Peaches, and watch the money pour out of your G-string.

The Car Category: Combine a man's two favorite hobbies -- fast cars and faster women -- and you have a winner! The best car names are the really expensive ones like Porsche or Mercedes. Remember to stay away from American brands. 

The Precious stones Category: As a general rule the more expensive the stone, the better the stage name. No one will ever get sick of names like Diamond or Sapphire.

The guys over there totally ripped us off by giving us lap dances after repeatedly saying no to them many times. The three of us, myself included, ended up paying $90+ to the guys because we were forced to pay for their services. And on top of that, we were dropped off by a Limo which took us more than an hour to wait just to get back to our hotel. Oh, and expect the OG guys to grope on your butt while waiting for your drinks by the bar. Won't ever come back again. Ladies, you have been forewarned.",BsDsTJYO1ZYHVdomA8J9yQ,6,1,1,LVLG6f4uKAfIjvo1ldsr8A
5474520,2012-07-21,1,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"My husband and I really liked this club due to the fact that you have both the male and female dancers in the same building.  To start off because we drove ourselves our entry was free if we purchased 2 drinks for $25, not to bad (I just wish that we didn't have to get both drinks at the same time).  

We started out at the female show which is downstairs, enjoyed ourselves.  The girls were all nice to look at and not to pushy, we met a girl that we both liked and she sat and talked to us for a while even after we bought a couple of dances, $20 per song.  She was alot of fun she had roaming hands and encouraged my husband and I to do the same.   She also told us if we come before 4 pm there is no entry fee and the drinks are much cheaper.

Next, we went upstairs to see the men dancers and this was our first time at a male strip club, totally different atmosphere than with the female club.  The women tend to get more riled up then men.   There were very hot guys dancing and they were enjoying themselves, loved the fireman.  As for couples being there I only saw one or two other couples, but tons of women enjoying the show.  The men pulled women from the audience up on the stage and gave them dances up there, it was a lot of fun to watch.  They definitely worked for their tips and made sure it was worth it for the tipper as well.  My husband and I both enjoyed ourselves.

When we decided to leave because of the mens club closing we went back down stairs and it was much more crowded and fewer girls going around and dancing so we left quickly.  

We liked it so much we took our favorite dancers advice and went back during the day around 4pm.   As she said there was no entry fee and the drinks were a lot cheaper.  When we first got there we weren't sure what to think, nobody was dancing and they were mostly just sitting around.  Once 5pm hit they started dancing on the stage and approaching us, we were the only ones tipping so it was like the girls were dancing just for us (it was nice).  We bought a dance from one girl and told her to come back later, but she never returned.  Another girl approached us after my husband tipped her quite a bit while she was on stage.  Immediately when her songs were over she came to our table thanking us for the tips and asked if we wanted a dance.  My husband paid for a dance even though she wasn't our type and lets just say there was a lot of contact that was unexpected, but very nice;)  She talked to us for a while after the dance and she let us know that most dancers are intimidated by couples, because they don't know if the girl really wants to be there or was dragged along.  So to the couples out there, if you want any attention from the dancers have a good time and let them know you are enjoying yourselves.  

We will definitely be back on our next visit.  Thank you OG for a lot of fun.",lkB8qMrI34wQEc1LK8fnOQ,7,3,5,vDjIyGiWERUNYX6K1Mra3w
5492867,2016-07-19,1,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,Just visited this place for a bachelorette party that another friend recommended. We of course we're upstairs with the male strippers. They are super fun and engaging. It is super far from the strip but I think worth it. This was the girls favorite part of the vegas trip. I would recommend offering a bottle menu rather than having the host yell in my ear what they had available. Most are visual people so to read and pick a bottle is better. Otherwise fun place! Bring lots of singles and don't be that group that just sits there and doesn't tip! Haaaa!,5sGTFg-Uj-3pDy3sKPkbvA,2,0,4,z3ZKY-QAU3I5bckblsmtRQ
5502577,2014-12-27,1,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"Meh...not a terrible experience but I suppose since I was in Vegas I was expecting something better.  It was my best friends wedding night so I came with him and his husband. Sigh. I'm not gonna lie...when we first came into the room we were kinda sad. There were about...4-5 guys maybe? It was a Saturday night so I thought that was kinda wack.  We sat near the stage where this clown was dancing around with a slinky hangin from his package...uhhh....if you wanna dance around with a slinky I'm gonna need for something to FILL the slinky. Otherwise, you look silly, sir. He came up to me, grabbed my hand and claimed he was waiting for me to loosen up...uhh..I was just waiting for him to get off the stage.  Or at least lose the damn slinky, it's not like he was bad looking but I'm sorry, I just can't get over the corniness of that thing.  

Anyway, we endured this dude for a couple more mins hoping someone would catch our eye. By the time he was finished, my friends were over it because it was clear the strippers weren't into making money...my friends are gay and it was made clear to them that they wouldn't be getting any attention. I don't get what the deal with that is...these guys paid money just like us ladies...get over it and do the damn thing! Their money is just as good as anyone else!! I'm pretty sure they wanted to go home and consummate the marriage anyway so it was cool. So I was left to fend for myself. I went to the bar and got liquored up because I was determined to have a good time. I waited and waited and waited...FINALLY...this sexy ass, caramel skinned dude gets on stage. He started dancing and I knew that was what I wanted...could have been the liquor that made him more appealing but who cares, for the first time the entire night I was finally excited about something!! Once he finished dancing I immediately headed for the stage and asked for a dance. I never had a lap dance from a male stripper before so I had no idea what to expect.  He took me to a semi-private area away from the stage and got to work. Siiiiiigghhhh. That shit was amazing lol. He licked, lifted and stretched me in ways I've never experience before (the licking was torso and above so don't judge too harshly lol). He was talking about something I couldn't even remember but it sounded sexy and I was half drunk so whatever he was saying really didn't matter. By the time it ended I could've sworn he said something about exchanging numbers but I can't remember clearly enough...I remember him walking away like he forgot I was supposed to be paying! but of course he came back and was like ""I actually need that 20 bucks tho"" lol! This dude really deserves 5 stars but considering I wasn't really feelin the rest of the club I settled for 3.

I was riled up once that was finished so I splurged on a dance from someone else...I really should have just left with my fantasies in tact from the first dance because the 2nd guy clearly didn't know what he was doing. Oh well...u win some, u lose some! Ladies....this place is worth a try if you can find the mystery guy mentioned above :)",PmkYBfQ6122cvkuGrXeXKw,0,0,3,HWmWC0MG0HkWE57jI2b7TA

I'm from an area where strip clubs are pretty strict but they are fully nude and don't charge a ridiculous cover charge. the cover was $40 which gave you 2 well drinks which were just barely bigger then a Dixie cup. half the dancers didn't even seem to want to be there not really dancing and just yawning on stage.,B4IAby2B4f3hZ9gBbxsZaQ,0,0,1,WgJDRFRBAckXLGHavtdkXw
5526743,2013-03-25,1,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"You know, I don't frequent strip clubs so I don't know how this place compares to many others, I'd been here before but not for over 10 years. It's somewhat divey, but it's dark so you can sort of get over that... sort of The girls are good looking - young, way young, look like they are 18, but I wasn't there to see the girls so what do I care?

I came for girls' night (for a friend's birthday) so of course we went upstairs to see the men. It's a long hike up the stairs, (don't wear heels). The drinks are ridiculous - $14 for a highball sized drink! The guys are hot and plenty of them, but plan on being bothered about every 3-5 minutes for a lap dance. They charge $20 for lap dances which = 1 song. But they'll let you touch them (anywhere) and will surely touch you everywhere too! If you want to get a friend on stage it'll cost you no less than $40 so you're better off buying her 2 lap dances.

Side note: They have a free limo service. You can call ahead and get picked up almost anywhere in downtown Las Vegas, it's free, you just tip your driver. But for us, on a Friday night, it took nearly 90 minutes for them to come get us.

Away from the kids once again.... Rent a car, drove to Vegas, got there in 3 1/2 hours at 80 mph. arrived at 12:35am. 

We met with 2 other couples, drag them out from the Baccarat tables at Caesars Palace to go grab a drink with us at OG. 

The best way is to call O.G. and make a reservation, they will sent out a limo to pick you up at your hotel. This way you don't pay a cover charge. You buy a greygoose bottle or any other liquor bottle and get only "" Smirnoff "" free. The bill came out to be 415.00 include tax & tips.

I want to be clear that I am not saying the place sucks; others have 5 star reviews. I'm saying that not only would I NOT GO AGAIN EVER, & I REGRET going there at all. But I suppose it's a mandatory trip; you go to sin city, you gamble, you watching naked dancing girls, you hang by the pool blah blah blah. I have been to Vegas on multiple occasions but only once previously visited a strip club there (glitter gulch on fremont; another 1 star loser) and figured they were all of the same overpriced underwhelming variety. I had heard thru a friend that Olympic Gardens was not like that, so I figured I would check it out. Admittedly I went on a Wed, which is not prime time, but still, it's sin city...to me that means bring the A game 24/7, don't you agree? To be clear, I am only reviewing the downstairs club, the upstairs with the dudes for the gals might be outstanding for all I know.  Downstairs for the guys? Well...
The place was less than 1/4 full, the ladies were just ok at best(looks, attitude) and the hustle...jesus christ I have had less complicated sales pitches trying to buy a car! Lap dance is x amount, the vip is X amount, XX amount, and XXX amount (varies by time and location), but there is a surcharge of y amount for drinks, and then there is the pitch for ""premium service"" and the more tips (I declined, and the dancer was not happy). They want your driver's license, your thumbprint, your first born (okay they actually don't want your first born)...WTF? 
THE BOTTOMLINE LINE IS THAT I GOT OVERCHARGED on my credit card, and I am still pursuing recourse 3 months later. IF YOU MUST GO, USE CASH, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR LICENSE or credit card!!!
Better yet, hit ANY of the bars in Vegas and watch the go go dancers; they are better looking, dance better, and if you tip them they appreciate it. Jenn at the M, is an amazing go go dancer, and way hotter than anyone I saw at OG.
I have only been to two, but the strip clubs in Vegas I know are LAME, and overpriced.

5614347,2016-08-13,1,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"Brief: appearance of the venue was decent, music pretty good, seating plentiful, guys were better dancers than the girls, best looking dancers only do lap dances, wide variety of lap dancers, learn the ride system to get deals.

Long: I don't go to strip clubs much so this was a very educational trip. The venue was about the same quality as the goth club I used to go to when I was in my twenties - not amazingly new or well kept but clean and cheerful enough to not get in the way. the two floors provide lady dancers on the bottom and men dancers on the top. We arrived at 9 o'clock on a Friday night and the folks watching the ladies were greatly outnumbered by the ladies watching the men upstairs. some of the men upstairs had some great Magic Mike type moves and while not all of them were my type I could see some really good looking guys all the time. the ones I really liked never got on the stage though and maybe that's normal at a strip club. they only wanted lap dances.

as soon as we sat down for 5 minutes we were offered our first drinks so service was quick. I took the advice of other yelpers and just ordered beers which worked out well. 

 Downstairs the ladies all did the same small range of movements pretty much. My husband did find a dancer he really liked and just like up on top it seems the best looking people didn't want to dance on the platform. We saw other people getting what seemed like longer lap dances then we got and I think maybe repeat customers get longer dances then first timers. the lady lap dancer charged $20, the guy lap dancer charged $25.

Now about the transportation system. We were referred to OG by somebody I stopped in front of the Bellagio Fountains who said we could get in for $30 each , including a limo ride to and from the club. His name was Anthony. when we called him he set us up a ride with somebody else named Raphael, who worked with badasslimos.com. we had wanted to leave for the club at 9 o'clock, but he didn't pick us up till well after 9:30. The limo was okay but a bit dirty inside. there were several used bottles and some dead rose petals about. The driver was nice enough but not amazingly chatty. When we got to the club, we got out, confirmed the price would be the cost of 2 drinks( which we had thought was $30 )and proceeded up to the ticket box where we were told it would be the full price, $40 each.

When we were ready to leave (around midnight) we called the limo , whom we had tipped $10  when we got there , and he said it would be about 15 minutes before he got to us. half an hour went past and we called again and he said it would be 5 more minutes. 10 more minutes passed and we called him and told him not to worry about it. I called Uber instead.

Uber driver was very helpful and told us about the agreement between the drivers and the strip clubs. Drivers who bring customers to the strip clubs receive more than the cover price as an incentive when they walk in the door. the only discounts available are basically the drivers giving you a share of their own money. I don't know if one can ever really count on a verbal agreement on that but it would probably require the driver getting out of the limo and going up to the box office with us and handing somebody else money.

The driver also let us know that the massage parlors offer an even bigger premium for the drivers and that drivers often pressure people living leaving the strip clubs for a massage parlor visit, to ""get something for their money"".

Then one of my buddies had 2 chicks all over him in the chair and made him pay $40 each. The girls didn't even ask if they could dance on him. The manager came over and was a real D-bag, and made him pay the $80. We explained to him our situation, and he didn't give a rat's a$$ and said W/E.

We had great plans, multiple places to go and scheduled to be at OG at 6 pm. Sat for 30 minutes not one girl on stage, about 15 people there and four girls doing table dances, but not one performing for the rest of the room... Then found out that the guys upstairs don't start until 8 pm but we had to be elsewhere...and in 30 minutes, no one came to take our drink orders.

So I complained and asked for either a refund or to allow us to return another night, manager openly and boisterously laughed at me saying "" we don't do refunds"", and began looking for a girl to make her start dancing. Having no choice we played along. The girls were nice enough, money hungry, but not beautiful or sexy, maybe the better girls come later...still. open to the customer means OPEN...we were there to see guys and girls as advertised, must have missed REAL HOURS OF BUSINESS on website.",1vUfFZJ1BfYtorPWAAckfw,7,0,1,bgvCxdV0TiFXy-JqgPD7PQ

OG is fun. It's not the best and it's always crowded. But it does have a floor for men and women. So, if you're in a big group and there are some ladies who want to see some men, well they can get all they want. Never been upstairs and don't plan on it though. 

My last trip here was the most fun even though I didn't get a single dance or tip a dollar. How is that you ask? See my review of La Femme Bar.

Highlights included:

-The Doorman (had been a ""strongest man"" competitor) at the OG was great! He was personable and welcoming. Felt like running into a family member. He even had a great style in asking us to move our drinks to plastic cups. 

-The Hostess was kind and helpful

-We opted for one hour in the VIP room with the dancer ""Sophie"". She was a true professional, not overly pushy or aggressive. She was helpful, kind and personable. She made my wife feel at ease and was completely engaged with both of us for the hour. Thank you, Sophie! 

Now for the Cons

-The cover was $90.00 for 2 of us

-Drinks were not great. They were expensive and fairly weak. We started with mixed drinks and then switched to beer because at least that was consistent. 

-I found it odd that it was required that a ""preauthorized"" charge for $50.00 be signed at the the same time that I purchased my drinks. I did not ask for an open tab

- In reviewing the club this evening I saw three couples specials through the website on Yelp. It would have been nice to have been given this option at the door. 


Overall our visit was a good experience. For future visits to Las Vegas, we plan on using Yelp reviews to see how the OG compares to other clubs.",cGE6FtX_uF4O9ost-xQd9A,0,0,4,M8B3UsQDfVD2eJz667v_-g

I brought my sister and her gang of cohorts there for her bachelorette party.  I haven't been responsible for so many huge grins since I was a....never mind, that's a long story.  Anyway, we bypassed all the female strippers on the first floor (not missing anything, they weren't really all that energetic), and went straight to the 2nd floor where they keep all the beefcake.  It is MARKEDLY louder upstairs, as there are plenty of women screaming as if they've never seen a patch of male skin in their lives.  

The male strippers flock to the money (Duh!!), so spend wisely!  If one doesn't ring your bell, move on to the next.  They won't be pissed, just be respectful and know that THEY know, it's a business.  Yet something about all that muscle glistening, and them smelling so good, you just might make a few more trips to the ATM.",PUkzxAgm-SNHm6Yb0sVvEA,3,4,4,19sWwPRa_0zP1M7xGIogcg

So here's the deal. It's a Saturday night, during 4th of July weekend. I was deciding between Men of Sapphire and Olympic Garden (friend is friends with a Manager). My contact at MOS said their male strippers sometime leave early on weekends (WTF?!) and since my friend recommended OG, I said sure. Mistake Number 1.

It was BAD. The strippers themselves were fine (not good looking, just good at their job). The place itself looked like SHIT. Bare walls and shitty carpet. Maybe I was too sober. So we try to solve that problem by ordering bottle service. Mistake Number 2.

We ordered Belvedere and OG had some special where we got a free bottle of Smirnoff. So typically, I don't get bottle service but apparently your host/hostess usually shows you the bottle before opening it. Well the geniuses at OG opened our bottle while we were getting our lap dances so they could later blame us for not looking at the bottle before they opened it. After my dance, I took a sip of my pre- mixed vodka/cran and it tasted like crap. I'm no ""vodka connosieur"" but i know what good vodka tastes like, even when its in a mixed drink. Long story short, we had a fit and the jackass bartender told us it was real belvedere. He wouldnt even take a swig of the ""belvedere"" to prove to us it was real.

OG's is the the only club I go to in Vegas. Not as pretentious as Treasures, Scores, Rhino, etc....Much friendlier girls. Bring your wife or girlfriend with you and you will have an even better time.
You get good mileage for your money. That's as clean as I can say that. Like a friend of mine once said, ""I think we go to Vegas just for OG's, everything else is extra."" 
The obvious downer is that you need a big party fund to have a good time here. $30 cover, $8 beers, $20 dances.

I was there this weekend for my friends Bachelorette party, there were 12 girls, we had set up our visit prior to arriving thru RED CARPET VIP - we had a limo take us to the club, with entrance for the entire party, 2 drinks and a VIP table with dance for the bachelorette.  When we sat down the waiter advised us if we spent 90 bucks more we could instead have 2 bottles of liquor with all the mixers. This was a better deal for us because we all can drink more then 2 drinks and after that the drinks were about 13 bucks each.

The show was pretty good, most of the guys were good looking with nice bodies.  They put on themed shows like one is fireman, doctor, etc.  The dance for our bachelorette was really good! We also got more dances for the Maid of Honor and two more for the bride.  WE HAD A BALL! The guys were all very nice!!! 

We all were kind of skeptical about a male strip club cause sometimes they seem corny but this turned out to be a really fun night!!! The music was good too we typically like hip hop but there was a nice variety!",wnlzBWPLydYDNLhrXTR85Q,4,0,3,EiLcxSVS4UU4wtQEm3Rrig

Also, the club was so dark that I couldn`t even see the face or features of the person next to me. Would not recommend this place to any one.",Wj88NVHftw56ekwtjZxMTg,4,0,1,GLSwGRr0hvZQgvY1kLpbUQ

The female strippers were very nice. Seemed a little uncomfortable with the male customers but did their job.

Haha!! It was funny...we didn't even put in our drink order yet and here was a big group of strippers heading our way and surrounding us...though I can't complain too much!

5937109,2010-09-09,4,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"i was scared to go to this place. i was really relying on the bad reviews on yelp so i came in with low expectations.

so me and my girls went sober and stayed that way, yes i know! but honestly i think that was best cause we were able to keep tabs on our money and the ugly strippers. 

labor day weekend, 9 girls, and about an hour before closing. i highly recommend to go around closing.

now it's quite expensive and what do you mean by that? we'll you drop about $40 walking in here and of course you still need money to put in thongs and purchase lap dances ($20).

$30 to get in? okay go to the male section of the strip club and when we enter there is a stripper with the physique of actor terry crews (don't know him google him, he is a huge dude) in a thong humping the stage. take it alll in.

seeing the 2 drink minimum a server comes up to us and asks for our orders, okay let's order soda, shouldn't be too pricey? nope it's $10 for ginger ale, crap should've just ordered a shot! fortunately our server forgot about us and we never bought the second drink.

after cover and the first drink i look in my bag and i'm almost out of money, we still need a ride back to hotel! there's an atm in the back with a charge of $4.

i take out $40 and go toward the front to grab 40 $1 bills. that is my budget! make sure you set one!


so we decide to sit at the stage. and we start eyeing the dancers walking around. OUR GOAL: we will get our friend the bachelorette a lap dance IN EVERY COLOR! 

surprisingly there were actually good looking guys! a handsome white one (dimples, possibly gay), a bald latino looking dude (nice body) and a few very good looking black guys (tyson was our man the rest of the night, he supposedly ""models"" in the east coast) we had jungle fever! 

they were all very polite and not really pushy, thank goodness.

there were a few ""oh hell no!"" strippers. guy with long hair up to his chin with a big nose kind of older looking, skinny guy with bad skin (sorry i hate being mean, but it's true) although he was still getting customers, that is why ladies it's good to be sober! we get beer googles too. 

we did head downstairs to check out the lady stripper side and it was quite traumatizing. let's just say we thought we walked into a brothel. if you fellas that night are taken/getting married shame on you! raunchy raunchy.",z0IwTVtQr4e5FPNz19nF8w,0,0,4,PDePIfCdJ8IwK5w8DW0NTw
5941750,2013-05-18,3,Y40U2KXA3v-N_h-9F8Y_aQ,"One night in Vegas a while back, my gurl friends & I thought we'd have some fun. My friend ""J"" is a resident, so we got in for free - otherwise, we would've had to pay I think $20 each. The upstairs male strippers were far from hot & closer to disappointing.

OK, maybe some of them were jacked & good-looking, but we didn't find them very appealing. When we first got there, a couple of them immediately insisted that I buy my friend a surprise lap dance for 20 bucks. That was annoying because they wouldn't leave us alone.

There was a group of girls near us, I guess they decided to buy their friend a lap dance. The stripper looked like he was giving a chair a lap dance: he didn't seem to know how to turn her on, & the girl likewise looked a bit bored/annoyed, like she was thinking ""ok let's get this over with sister, you're clearly into guys"". Then this male stripper approached our group & told us he's actually a prince from some faraway island, Fiji or something. Over the years, from friends going to strip joints for fun, I've heard all sorts of backstories - they're doing it for college money, they have a kid, they're actually a virgin, they're poor & don't have a choice, etc. So this was new - he's some exotic prince that left home to fulfill his grand dreams of becoming a Vegas stripper. Sounds like Buddha's story....in reverse. Or its porn version.

One of the strippers onstage started sexy hip-hop dancing in his black undies, black socks & sneakers. Srsly there's just no way for all of those things to go together & be sexy. To the male strippers of Olympic Garden, take tips from Magic Mike & get it right.

Downstairs was clearly where the party was at. The female strippers were super hot, some were cute, & I remember seeing 1 that I figured would be the one for me. If I were a guy, or bi. All in all, it was a fun night. But it was most entertaining downstairs (female strippers) not upstairs (male strippers).",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,0,0,3,zv4GrgNZn92zrPLUSa8stg

Then the women, we only seen one dancer and the music wasn't so great, it seemed upstairs was more hyped up. After she got off stage no one else came on stage so we just left. 

This is technically all I'm going to say because whatever happened while I was here stays in there. 

But it would have gotten a 4 stars if limo service so wasn't terrible. We never got back to our hotel we were supposed to get dropped off at. We got stranded at like 2am at a random hotel and our assh*le driver sped off after. He literally threw a unprofessional tantrum in the limo ride on the way to abandoning us.
