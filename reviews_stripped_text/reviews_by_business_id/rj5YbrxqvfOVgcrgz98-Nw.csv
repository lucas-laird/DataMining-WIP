I asked the drive thru guy 3 times what kind of sauces I wanted & he still got it wrong .  The fries were too brown & cold ! One of my Big Macs came with two dry patties & no sauce , no lettuce & not even a complete slice of cheese. I called the manager Virginia to complain & she was rude on the phone. She claimed she boxed all orders & none were wrong.  This is the only time I've been dissatisfied with a McDonald's... this place is just gross.",ITmCF8Yg_76t80YbpSbDtg,0,0,1,F_-MkB49YP3b9EzN9ELNVg

Specially at night time. I don't know why they were open late night....if they weren't going to serve you. I don't blame the crew it was those unexperienced so called managers, that didn't quite care about their job, nor the crew. They didn't have heart for their job. If they only knew a little bit about costumer service, the place would've been quite successful. Good location, alot of customers, filling up gas. But the managers didn't care to put an effort to make it work. McDonald's corporation should send their employees to management classes, so this could've been prevented. Lost a good revenue, so I say shame  on those managers, you made  good people lose their job. A word of advice to those unexperienced ""managers"" treat your work place like if you were the owner. And remember one important thing, customer service and satisfaction is key to keep a business running successfully.",vGIaIZBroZnpegSF4kwZ3w,0,0,1,lrkMjGwdn0AkZ8F-6biykg

Got to work, I only had 1 of the 2 mcmuffins and got everything else.The second time I went, I ordered 2 orders of only pancakes, 4 sausage and egg mcmuffin, and a hash brown. I got home, no hash brown inside. I shouldn't have to check if I have all I ordered. Its their responsibility to make sure I the customer get everything I order. I will no longer be going to this McDonalds.",rdF2-itdvinsyycADfi26A,1,0,1,4Hty-cD__XRe5raH7TquWQ
