But huge portions most definitely does not equal good. Beef was very think. Same beef was used for both dishes. Food was both way too salty and sweet at the same time. Service was SLOW. The waiter never stopped by our table after taking our order. No one else came into the restaurant during the hour plus severer there. I totally understand why.",bNYSwevuNaL-PHditmF6TQ,0,0,1,_y3DEbTwIINzJTkiLisPgg

It's your typical lil Korean joint. I went last night and had a good time. If you're into cocktail soju, they have many flavors here, such as mango (yum!), lemon, grape, peach, and more. Be aware of their ddukboki (rice patties) because they tend to make it spicy...well, it already is a spicy dish, but go and enjoy yourselves.

I believe it's a family-owned restaurant, but please correct me if I'm wrong.",Asqp_zcgwK-oauCoWLv8WA,2,1,4,d6LSJAvpUHNgks_RtXZCdQ

I ordered the bulgogi and it is not bad. It comes on a sizzling plate with lots of onions and peppers with sesame seeds and has light to moderate heat. The spicy beef and leek soup was very flavorful and the spicy pork son sizzling plate was also pretty tasty. The various kimchi selection was OK. The menu is hard to understand because of the lack of description. The service is alright , nothing special.

1584114,2008-05-30,1,azzs6H7CcIHt_acKJF6UfQ,Good old fashioned korean food.  All types of alcohol.  Wide range of menu and HUGE portions.  You can probably eat there for a couple months without eating the same dish.  Try it.  You won't regret it.,R8q1ubvI008ZZIB7buBqRg,1,1,5,suI2uGmyCKQDw0iG0PiSSQ
1983950,2010-07-27,1,azzs6H7CcIHt_acKJF6UfQ,"One of the first things that should be mentioned is that this place is not open until late afternoon. The pro to that? They are open LATE to accommodate this late night town. I believe their current hours are 4pm - 3am? Something similar. 

With that said, I love Min Sok Chon! It's close to my house, easy access, good service about 90% of the time and great taste. 

I usually order the spicy beef soup, and I have never been disappointed. A ton of flavor, spicy enough (not ""Americanized"" because I'm 1/2 white). 

The atmosphere is calm, quiet and private. The booths are accommodating for small groups, and the music is usually well chosen. 

The things that need some improvement: the dog visiting behind the counter, although one reviewer referred to it as ""cute"" which I do not argue, it's unsanitary to have it walking around in the kitchen and hanging over dishes when the food is being handled (if I didn't love the place so much, I would honestly have to report it- but I've only seen the dog once). Service can sometimes be slacking if there are more than 3 tables, especially if those tables have Koreans at them. Not to say there is preferential treatment, but the servers tend to spend more time talking and checking in on the Korean speaking tables. 

Overall, I really do love this place and eat from their kitchen a couple times a month at minimum. Their beef soup is affordable and can last me for 3 meals, making it even more cost effective. The rest of the menu is comparatively priced for Korean food - and, they are the only place in Vegas (that I know of) that serves duk bok hi.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,2,1,5,VUEztYJXYOdXvSYq5QujUg
2264717,2007-12-27,0,azzs6H7CcIHt_acKJF6UfQ,"The menu was very difficult to figure out. I'm not unfamiliar with most Korean dishes, but I don't speak or read Korean, and there were no transliterations on the menu. The English descriptions were way too vague to know what I was looking at, things like ""Beef with Noodles"" and ""Spicy Kim Chi Soup"". I'm pretty sure most people these days aren't going to recognize be bim bap, or other dishes called by their real names. Anyway, I was after some kimchi jigae, so I didn't have to ask much about the rest of the menu items, and the price was right. $3 for a pint of Hite seems like a pretty good deal, too.

The sides arrived, and the kimchi and the other pickle was a little too funky for my tastes (meaning OLD). Same goes for the bean sprouts. Potato salad was great, and I'm not sure how one could screw up those little salted fish they give you.

The jigae was ok, but not fantastic. Not very spicy, and not as flavorful as most I've had. Not horrible for the price, but I'm not sure I would go back.",Hzt4UPkvv7VXHXVBAlfIqw,3,1,3,3yukQlbnhzf6IcvIN8vmDg

2407560,2011-01-09,0,azzs6H7CcIHt_acKJF6UfQ,"We tried Min Sok Chon on Friday night. It's close to my work and across the street from a play we saw that night. I've seen it many times but never tried it as they don't open until 3 p.m. and I'm usually only in the area at lunch time.

For our appetizer we shared mushroom poppers ($6.99). They were deep fried mushrooms filled with spicy tuna and real crab. They were drizzled with house sauce which was sweet and spicy. I liked the mushroom poppers a lot. I'm a sucker for stuffed mushrooms. Stuff them with tuna and crab? I'm sold!

We were given six sides which were the typical accouterments normally given at a Korean restaurant. We got: 
Potatoes which were fine, nothing special
Kimchee which was tart, not the best I've ever had
Bean sprouts which were salty
Some kind of greens which had a vinegary picklish flavor
Dried fish which was crunchy and salty
Some kind of squash which was mildly sweet


For our entree we split an order of slow cooked pork belly with oysters ($27.99). When I saw it on the menu, it seemed rather pricey. However, it was huge and one order would have been enough for four people. The dish consisted of pork belly, oysters, kim chee noodles, jalapenos, garlic, and cabbage. We were also given shrimp sauce and paste. The waiter instructed us to dip the pork in the shrimp sauce and dip the jalapenos and garlic in the bean paste. We then wrapped everything in the cabbage leaves. I have never had anything quite like that, and I'm glad we tried it. It was good.


We had quite a bit leftover and asked for a box. A few hours later we realized we had left our box on the table. My wife called the restaurant to see if they still had it. The waiter said he wasn't sure as he hadn't had time to bus the tables yet. He said if he found it, he'd put it in the fridge for us. Our play was about to start so we said we'd come by in an hour and a half to see if he found it. When we returned, the waiter said he hadn't had a chance to bus the tables yet and we could check our table. Our table was exactly like we left it. Keep in mind this was 4 or 5 hours later. By that time there were several unbussed tables and the diners were seated at the tables that had not yet been used. 

I doubt I'll be back. The food was good but not great, and the fact that they don't bus their tables for hours is kind of off-putting.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,3,1,3,vXBuWBbzOCaqoXXS2vpp7A
2487504,2012-01-21,0,azzs6H7CcIHt_acKJF6UfQ,"I needed good food & alcohol so my friend took me here.  The food is great home cooked Korean food.  We had the slow cooked pork belly with oysters.  This dish is fantastic.  Definitely not for everyone because of the oysters, but if you eat just the pork belly and pickled napa cabbage you'd still be amazed how flavorful this dish is.  We also had the potato & beef rib soup.  Loved the soup! It was just the right amount of spice.  We also ordered the candied corn & cheese dish to finish off.  Man that dish is the best drunk food ever!

The service is fantastic.  It's a few blocks from UNLV so it is kind of in a ghetto area, but it's the little hole in the walls that have the best food right?  Very reasonable pricing.  Can't wait to go eat there again.",0CRdDT9v9kNDDQ69AIqwZA,1,1,4,VF2w-W5zlmeBU_JZwUdDPg

My starter soup arrived and several sides of banchan. The soup was tasty and banchan was marginal. My Bi Bim Bop arrived and it was hot and the rice was nice and toasted on the bottom. I added some sauce that they left on the table but the flavor was still lacking taste and the ingredients seemed to be really skimpy. Instead of beef strips they give you ground beef. I could'nt even finish half the bowl. When I tasted this dish in K town  Los Angeles the dish had much more flavor compared to Min Sok Chon. As for the spicy tuna hand roll it was also weak, cold tuna but also lacking flavor when I got towards the bottom the seaweed was soggy - yuck!

I had the soondooboo jjigae but instead of seafood, I asked for beef because I was more in the mood for meat... and of course, asked for it to be as spicy as humanly possible. They do a great job with this dish. It is only $7.99 and comes out in a stone bowl with onions, zucchini, mushrooms, beef, tofu.. etc, and it is one of the heartiest stews you'll ever have. The people I ate with both times ordered their sushi rolls and they are fantastic! Great in portion and provides a versatile selection. 

If you like Korean BBQ but you don't want to spend over $20 per type of meat, this is the perfect spot. The meat dishes are very reasonable in price, ranging from about $12.99 to $16.99 for a well-portioned, hot plate of meat (galbi, pork bulgogi, bulgogi, chicken bulgogi, etc..) If you crave Korean BBQ often, save a couple bucks per trip by eating here. 

Aaaaand why did I give this place 4 stars instead of 5? The service :-/. We are eating high-sodium, salty, and spicy delicious foods; however, they never came by to refill our waters.

5373914,2012-02-18,6,azzs6H7CcIHt_acKJF6UfQ,"BOSSAM! That is the only item you need to familiarize yourself with. It is a boiled pork belly plate with white kimchi, spicy shredded radish, garlic, jalapenos, a soybean paste, and a fish sauce dip. This large platter is enough to feed two people comfortably. 

Tutorial on how to eat:
Step 1- Take a piece of cabbage.
Step 2- Dip pork belly in fish sauce and place on cabbage
Step 3- Dip garlic and/or jalapeno in the soybean paste and place on meat
Step 4- Put some spicy radish on top and fold
Step 5- Dislocate jaw and shove it all in
Step 6- Chew like there is no tomorrow because I will not be held responsible for choking hazards.

I have one friend which I can always count on to go with me for Korean. When the two of us get together, we usually order enough for four. Not exactly sure how large the plate of pork belly was, we ordered the Soondubu (soft tofu soup) as well. Big mistake. The meat was more than enough to fill us and the soup just pushed us over the edge. It was not the best version of Soondubu, but the mushroom flavor in the stock was prevalent and I enjoyed that. Otherwise, there was nothing too special.

The banchans were plentiful and replaced without asking. Fish cakes, soy sauce onions and jalapenos, bean sprouts, kimchi, and soy sauce potatoes as far as the eye can see. Most of the items were on the more mature side of fermentation. If sour is not the preferred taste, then Min Sok Chon might not be the place for you. 

The decor reminds me of many of the bars in the smaller towns. It is cozy and has a rustic feel. The bamboo blinds separates most of the booths and back areas. The cushions are all flat which gave me no support. I have no natural cushion back there so my flat butt was shifting back and forth in a vain attempt to get comfortable.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,8,5,4,1aMHQR_I8cwvsb5-Eqe6vQ

Once our food was delivered, the server did not check up on us. Our drinks were empty, and we would have liked more. It shouldn't be our responsibility to walk up to the cashier every time we would like a refill.
