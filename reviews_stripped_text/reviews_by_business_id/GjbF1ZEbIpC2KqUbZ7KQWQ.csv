132178,2016-02-27,0,GjbF1ZEbIpC2KqUbZ7KQWQ,I love teriyaki chicken especially freshly done. They make theirs and it does have a lot but you do get what you pay for. It is pricey. The food itself was bland. The chicken was so dry and it took forever to make. There wasn't enough teriyaki to add flavor to the dish so I ended up having to make my own sauce at home and add my own seasoning to improve its dry and bland taste. I was expecting to have higher quality considering it is pricey. Guess that isn't always the case.,9ZPv9euFZBH0afD9nZZ5Uw,0,0,2,OAg7nWW3XSmsaaKK-4q-gQ

218407,2015-05-09,0,GjbF1ZEbIpC2KqUbZ7KQWQ,"Pros:
1.  Generous rice

Cons:
1.  Overprice
2.  Slow service
3.  Food was below average.  I ordered Yakisoba and it was bland.  The beef was overcooked I had to throw it away because it was so hard to chew.

Neutral:
1.  The place looked clean, but that's probably because it is new.  However, nothing really exciting.

Conclusion:
Not a great value.  I gave another star because atleast they were not rude.  (I did not read other people's post to ensure I gave a fair review).",ajrsTUndA_-H4cXo9hVPbQ,0,0,2,8HLt-h_FBfUeL0POVpxhJg

  My boyfriend and I were really excited for this place to open, specially since the place across the street has gone down hill since changing owners. 

Biggest problem is the prices. I have no problem paying for good sushi, but when your charging the same or more than a sit down restaurant that has 3 times your over-headed there is an issue.  I expected fair priced good (not great) fast sushi.  

Ordered three rolls, 2/3 were good. One was good enough to order again, I would tell you what it was but they gave it to us by mistake so I'm not sure.  We will probably go back but no rush when we can order sushi mon to go right after the gym and just pick it up before heading home to Southern Highlands.",wvAtPNSX3RDx9l1Jvzwvvg,1,1,3,ECnCS89Ar01Is5oTKmL5ww

888376,2016-03-17,1,GjbF1ZEbIpC2KqUbZ7KQWQ,"Just left after having ""lunch"". Walk in, there is a putrid smell of sewer all over the restaurant. We were waiting on a prescription to be filled at Walgreens across the street, so options were limited. 

Guy taking the order acted like he was really put out that we were there. Bf and i ordered 3 items total: vegetable tempura, one avocado roll with cream cheese, and a chicken/beef lunch ""special"". $32.00. Seriously? 

While waiting i used the restroom which had an even WORSE sewer smell. Food arrived. Immediately a fruit fly flew into my soy sauce. Bf's lunch special was huge, mainly more salad than meat. My avocado roll consisted of 5 slices, so big in circumference that it couldn't be eaten in one bite, so the thing falls apart with each bite. Barely any rice, tons of avocado, and a speck of cream cheese. Veggie tempura barely had any breading, and veggies were still crunchy. Not at all cooked. 

Only one other table in the place, when they left, the same employee let the table sit dirty at least until we left. Needed a box and had to retrieve him from the back of the place where he was sitting at a table and ask him for one. His parting words were: ""just leave the stuff on the table"".

No one else in the whole place. I ordered a poke bowl, she ordered a combo plate. When she asked to sub fried rice, she was told she had to order an entire separate fried rice plate. No substitutions. I offered to pay an up charge, and the man who took our order repeated that we had to buy an entire fried rice plate in order to get fried rice. Fine, whatever. The man who took our order was the one who cooked our food. I never saw another employee. Which might explain why it took 27min for him to prepare or meal, in spite of the phase ""Sushi Express"" plastered all over the walls. The steak shrimp combo was over cooked, both the steak and the shrimp were like rubber. He did ask my wife how she wanted her teriyaki steak cooked, to which she replied ""Medium"". It wasn't. It was more like chewing the sole of a Nike. It's called Dynamite Grill, so I expected my poke salad to be spicy. It had so much chili sauce on it, that it burned my eyes before I ever took a bite. I choked down 7 or 8 pieces before I had to surrender to the flames. Maybe someone who reads this will be excited by that level of spice; but I prefer to be able to taste the dish, and have the spice be a compliment.

Unfortunately, this place has not good at all. It started with it taking 19 minutes for my take out order to be prepared. I understand it's being made fresh, but with no other customers inside, this was a bit long. And to top off the wait, it was extremely hot inside the place! 

The food: I ordered the chicken/steak meal, shrimp meal, fried rice, and order of gyoza. The chicken and gyoza were actually good (reason for 2 stars and not 1 star). The sauce with the gyoza was great!! The shrimp was ok, nothing special. Now to the bad items - the steak!! The steak was so rough and disgusting I actually cut it up and fed it to my steaks. I haven't had such rough and chewy steak in years. The fried rice was a very large portion for the price, but it contained corn and bacon!!! WTF?? Seriously WTF!!! Corn in rice is Mexican. And who the hell has ever put bacon in fried rice? I love bacon, but it didn't go good together. 

Lastly, I would like to say the younger gentleman working (don't know his name) was extremely friendly and showed a passion for the job. When handing me the order he asked me some questions to verify everything was correct with the order. Very nice guy!

I had high expectations for this place because I was imagining it to be like Volcano Grill (Yelp it, so worthy). I know this was only their 2nd day open, and I'm hoping they work out their kinks because the location is so convenient for us. I hope they start with the entre√© pricing because is super ASSpensive.

I wouldn't mind paying the $90 we did for our meal if the quality was up to par. I understand it's labeled ""sushi express"", but what's up with the dine-in-hibachi-where-the-chef-puts-on-a-fancy-show-for-you-cook-in-front-of-you prices????? Seriously! $12 average for a Hibachi Entre√© with STEAMED rice, $3 extra for fried rice. You also get steamed veggies. I mean, this is a fast food style restaurant! They serve their food in styrofoam for dine in. That's cool and all, but the price to quality has no balance.

What we ordered:
-Vegas Roll
The closest to what is normally called a Tiger roll elsewhere. Shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna. Their Tiger roll here is not like this. This was our first time eating sushi from a styrofoam plate lol. But I gotta give it up, this was bomb and we'd come back for this AND only this!!
-Shrimp Tempura
They don't have TEMPURA SAUCE!!!! I know it's a new restaurant but the poor girl at the register gave us a look like we were making shit up when we asked, ""do you have tempura sauce?""

-Salmon Teriyaki Entre√© 
My 4 year old finished his fish and he said it was good. 
-Beef Entre√© + $3 fried rice
This was my husband's. He said his was good but nothing he'd come back for. He's a sauce guy and he's appalled as to why no sauces were offered or served. Hibachi and sauces go together!!
-Shrimp Entre√© + $3 fried rice
Look for the photo I uploaded! My shrimp and rice looked charry. Like they didn't clean the grill well before cooking my meal. What if it gets busier than it was tonight guys? Fried rice should be part of the entre√©s!!
-Chicken Katsu Entre√© + $3 fried rice 
My son, who loves chicken Katsu, from almost anywhere was sort of upset because they poured the sauce over the meat. He ended up eating it all anyway because he was hungry after a basketball game. He's a big fan of Hibachi fried rice and he said this one tasted weird. Probably charry tasting like mine did.

Next time we want Hibachi again, we're going down the street to Ohjah. We'd be paying the same price plus salad, miso, and SAUCES!! Oh and we'd get a free show from the cooks too. Next time we want ""express"" style food like this, we'll take the drive to Volcano Grill. At least their meals come with fried rice and everything tastes delicious. 

Southern Highlands is a family oriented neighborhood, you need more tables that are family friendly. Not everyone coming in will come in twos. High chairs needed as well. Staff needs more Japanese food education. Girl at register kept asking the cooks what stuff were lol. I almost feel bad for asking for Tempura sauce, meat sauce, what's in their rolls, etc.",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,3,1,2,tUWNfEpIR8JjnsZBPBCf_w

Well coming into the restaurant few days after they open and it does not look like it's ready for opening. Decor and restaurant still looks a little bare. No music or anything on so conversations are a little awkward to have when everyone can hear.. Restaurant not ready for opening. On top of that owners not here one of the main reasons smaller restaurants like this fail. Still decided to try the food.

So I go in and look at the menu restaurant style is teriyaki madness-ish. Prices are restaurant range. Beef shrimp combo 16$ for a pretty small portion. Twice the price for half the food at Panda Express or teriyaki madness which are the closest comparable restaurants. Two entrees and two drinks 40$. 

Still I don't like to write negative reviews and wasn't going to if it weren't for the lack of service and wait time. I then decided to politely return a meal I took a bite out of since it completely tasted like pepper (beef yakisoba) and had to wait 25 minutes to try and return it. A lot of people waiting long wait times for orders.


Wouldn't go back. I always try to find the good in places and be as optimistic as possible but this restaurant just didn't do it for me.

The kids working there and the girl taking our order were sweet and tried but we're just inexperienced not there fault .

Below average food. Restaurant is not ready to be opened. Slow service. Don't worry you're not missing anything by not stopping here. Who knows maybe they get better and improve in the future..",Y0EkdfGUM-W561xGcisldg,1,1,1,VOCO-h-pKr7Nive9Zvx6dg

I also loved the sauce it came with which was a blend of dynamite sauce and a sort of sweet teriyaki blend, just delish and a great compliment to the tempura mix! I will most definitely order it again! The rainbow roll was pretty good, generous amount of fish which was very fresh. I still prefer Kazuki Sushi, but for a quick fix this most definitely satisfies the craving!

3371845,2015-10-09,0,GjbF1ZEbIpC2KqUbZ7KQWQ,"Okay so this one is so hard for me because I wanted to love this place so much, as southern highlands kind of has limited selection. 

First of all I misunderstood, I thought this was a real sit down hibachi, so maybe that's where my disappointment began but at the same time I was excited to have my food to go to go eat in front of a TV lol. 

I ordered 2 chicken teriyaki meals. He wouldn't allow me to have them served with fried rice, why? I don't know. So I ordered the side of fried rice, an additional $10. The chicken, was horrible, poor quality meat. The seasoning itself was fine, but the cuts of the chicken were very chewy, and stringy, if that makes sense. 
The fried rice was horrendous, I'm sorry. There was pork bits that ruined the entire taste of the rice. I am not totally against pork but the way they cooked this with the rice was just down right gross. 
I will say the side salad that comes with the teriyaki meals was great. The vegetables were again just gross. No wear near what I typically find at a hibachi place. (Ohjah) 

I ordered a teriyaki salmon meal as well, and I wish I could give you a review on it, as they forgot to cook this and send it out with the rest of my order. 

I ordered a crunchy roll and a Vegas roll, the crunchy roll was worth the price and pretty good. The Vegas simply had so much on top it was over bearing, but I won't say it was bad as I am not a sushi expert. 

So for 3 teriyaki meals, and 2 orders of sushi my total came to $74 and some change. $74??????? I was so caught off guard when he told me this but of course I paid in hopes I would really enjoy this meal. Sadly I got home and discovered I didn't receive my salmon, which I will say to their credit they told me I could come back and grab or whenever I wanted. But I think if a customer is paying 80 bucks (more or less) for a few things, maybe we should check and make sure they receive their meals. Clearly I was very disappointed with this place and won't be returning, even for the salmon. The place was clean and the man himself was cool, not rude or anything. But man was I sad when I ate the food. 

I see some people really enjoy this place so maybe this was just a fluke for me, but I feel for the price I can go to Ohjah or even China Gogo and get much better tasting food.",qfP7mVenCRYqijLiWOIWUQ,3,0,2,ViSlNYds2Ev9HGjk1jNQwg

The people who own this restaurant are just the sweetest people I've ever met. They're so gracious and they make you feel like they're happy to have you in their restaurant. 

At first, I expected the small sized sushi that I usually would see at the other sushi restaurant I used to go to. But when I opened up my to go box at home, I was so surprised by how big the size was of my rolls. I ordered the Jerry's Special, Caterpillar Roll, and the Crunch Roll.

I think they need to stop serving in paper plates. Step up just a little more. My husband ordered the udon soup and they served it on a drink cup! Also, staff needs to learn the menu. As a new restaurant expect everyone to ask questions (especially when there aren't any description on the menu), so  educate your staff! The girl couldn't even pronounce udon correctly... Scary!

Also I had the combination fried rice, totally burnt, AND the food was so slow to come out. I don't think they expedite the food well. Seems like they cook the food one at a time, but rush it because it was burnt ( weird right?)

Well seasoned dish with a side salad with a house salad dressing. The Dynamite roll had a spicy sauce - not too spicy. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family.

First the decor:
As bland & as plain as vanilla gets, without a hint of ambiance!!! It was like an uncomfortable ""hospital"" like environment. I could only imagine what Joe Bastianich & Tim Love would say if this were an episode of Restaurant Start Up!! Plain walls, no music, no...style!! The place felt like they ran out of money and they drastically cut corners to make do with what they had. If it weren't for the signs, I would have no clue this was a Japanese restaurant!! 

Prices: Overpriced for what you get!! 
I ordered the teriyaki chicken n beef entree. I paid about $16 dollars & I felt cheated for the amount of food I received! I don't mind paying for food, but give me my money's worth!!  There were pieces of fat blubber on my beef and hardly any chicken!! The food was not bad...but I have had better. I was not ""impressed"". It was just...ok.

2 Stars:
The wait was not too bad for my order to come out. About 10 minutes. I ordered to go. The young girl at the counter was very sweet & nice. Great customer service.

Bottom line: Save your money & go elsewhere. Champagne prices for a beer quality restaurant with a plain vanilla ambiance!!",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,4,1,2,Xz4EaMiWxw0Nl7kKxV4w8g

Tried the Katsu and was surprised that they didn't use a panko breading.  The end result was a heavier katsu that wasn't terrible but wasn't as expected either.   The katsu sauce was not good. ...threw it out.  Let's talk about price!  My husband had the katsu plate, I had the katsu bowl and we shared 1 sushi roll. .. $32!!!!  Way over priced...way.
Also had the crunchy roll and it was yummy!  Will return to try other menu items but won't have the katsu again until they fix their recipe.",2BM4yGQX3dgsQ_QCoLJLZA,0,0,3,nSXLWMZadahNMZq7GBor0A

I ordered (3) things: Tiger roll, seaweed salad and miso soup. The Tiger roll was bland and missing flavor. The miso soup was not miso soup and was quite flavorless. The seaweed salad was normal, however the amount given was way more than necessary. It did reflect in the price as well. 

I did not appreciate that the menu did not have a description of what was in some of their specialty rolls. 

Overall, it was overpriced, bland and unexciting. I may consider trying them again in a few months to see if there is any improvement.",mgFac-ioTBzELgqhbDds4w,0,0,2,bunW-qOIOnk7e2lf7IpIPg

The sushi is made for you by World Series of Poker Champion Jerry Yang.
He turns out to be one of  the most friendly and talented guys i have met. 
The atmosphere is easy, comfortable neighborhood casual.
Pricing is almost fast food range but the quality of this Sushi is unmatched.
Seriously, some of the best sushi i have had. 
It was delicious, fresh, and very high quality.
I have been to a lot of Sushi places and the Dynamite grill is now on top of the list. 
I had the Rolls Royce Roll, the Spicy Tuna, and the Jerry Roll. My party shared rice and Teriyaki Chicken and it was almost too big of a portion.
The Tuna roll was delicious, but could have been rolled a little tighter. All rolls were served with a plate of wasabi and a mountain of ginger which i love to put on each piece of Sushi.
This is well worth the 10 minute drive from the Vegas Strip, and worth every penny for exceptionally good Sushi, made by the owner.
Great food. Great price. I will come back again and again.

The minute we got there, and open the door they were so attentive polite very clean. Me and my daughter ordered two combo plates that were to die for :) yes you got it. They Rocked it. Overwhelming with the food quality and service. its my new number #1 place in Vegas.so fresh and cooked to order. I had to order eggs rolls to go so I could take some more food home with me lol.

5556730,2015-03-29,1,GjbF1ZEbIpC2KqUbZ7KQWQ,"I wouldn't complain too much about the food.  I enjoyed the spicy crab sushi roll and I would come back for the food if they changed everything else.  

Prices.
First, they use paper plates, which I'm fine with, but $16 bucks for chicken teriyaki/shrimp combo? Only after I got my food, I found out you can change your rice to fried rice for an additional $3??.  Umm $19 for a combo plate ... ouch ! you gotta step your game up.  The portions are too small.  Use real plates instead of paper or serve it to us restaurant style because I doubt this family orientated neighborhood is going to pay over $20 bucks for 1 person to eat.  Let me get my money's worth.

Variety of Food:
The name ""sushi express"", you're thinking a variety of sushi but there is not much on the menu.  Also no descriptions on any of the rolls so you would need to ask them what is in it.  Maybe a suggestion would be adding bento boxes or lunch specials so people can have a combo of hibachi and sushi instead of paying full price if I want both.   

Atmosphere:
Seating is limited so if you have a large group stay away.  No music, no decorations so you can hear everything and everyone. 

I hope they change some things up because I love seeing new places succeed !!! I know our neighborhood was excited about something like this opening.   For now, if you want a chicken teriyaki bowl I would go down the street to teriyaki madness for 7 bucks and if you want your sushi fix, go to your favorite sushi restaurant because you'll be paying the same price!",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,5,1,1,C81jaKflJYjt3gEcsEJQPg
5724965,2015-05-17,0,GjbF1ZEbIpC2KqUbZ7KQWQ,"Hmmm I will start with the interior: pretty bland and not a lot of seating for more than 2 people at a time. I got miso soup ($2.50) for a pretty large bowl. They definitely didn't skimp on tofu, but there was no seaweed in it. I really missed that! 

Crunch Roll was delicious. It had great presentation and lots of avocado. Usually there's a tiny sliver inside, but they didn't skimp on anything in the roll. It was $10.95 tho!! That's a lot for a small casual joint. My husband doesn't like sushi so he was going to get the chicken teriyaki, but when he saw the prices, he went next door for tacos instead. I will try it again but probably just for a take out roll.",GM-_XoNhJMvRRkysdf3ZoA,1,0,3,m7ec4Jf9SSjQdderor7QpA
5758919,2015-04-02,1,GjbF1ZEbIpC2KqUbZ7KQWQ,"Decided to support our Southern Highlands newcomer...Food was not awful guys...maybe on the bland side, but that's way better than overly seasoned. My wife went in to get the food to go, but I can see what the other reviewers were saying about the spartan decor. Owners: take 5 minutes to put a little love to design. And how hard is it to put some tunes...it'll help you guys when you're working as well. 

Then I saw the bill. Listen, Southern Highlands is considered a remote neighborhood. Places like Off The Strip set the standard for pricing and I remember an Italian restaurant that tried to match their pricing except for one big difference--Off The Strip gets it and they didn't. SOOO, they went out of business. Owners: it's a cautionary tale that you have to take seriously. You can't charge super pricing for this type of food. I know I know, you already got your flyers printed....but guys, that's cheap to replace. You also have a digital menu...changing that is easy. Wouldn't you rather lower the prices and get more people in than trying to get rich off a few? 

I believe in you guys, come on, I'm rooting for you--improve decor, food quality, and pricing and Southern Highlands will come.",-YLiMJ0xeWxqny9O9YKzoA,1,1,3,jscsYkBER4RsHfG1jCn4wg
