949663,2015-04-17,0,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,"Menu is very small, mainly it's fried rice with about 7 topping variation (I.e. Curry chicken, ham & egg, walnut shrimp, can't remember the others). They have egg rolls and a soup, I have tried Angels fried rice twice and once they had egg drop soup and another time they had hot & sour.  I had their walnut shrimp the first time with an order of egg rolls.  The egg rolls were terrible, greasy, hardly any filling and what was there was awful.  Walnut shrimp sauce was ok, but the shrimp are those flattened, frozen, breaded tasteless ones you can get at the frozen product isles at the grocery store.  Rice was ok, but didn't seem like they used basmati rice.  Disappointed.  But I always give restaurants a second try, so the 2nd experience I tried to order the curry chicken and hot & sour soup, but they ran out of both items. so i went with the ham & eggs.  Once again I don't believe they are using basmati rice or its of a poor quality.  There was an abundant amount of ham and eggs.  It was reminiscent of the home cooked fried rice of my childhood so I was glad this round wasn't as bad as my first experience here.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is beyond friendly and fast.  If you are looking for a cheap and quick fix to your fried rice craving, by all means stop in. But definitely stay away from the egg rolls!",SRME9m7Dol6oO1J0BDy57w,2,1,3,f4ldI947P0q1Tq0iqZSSmg

1476060,2015-04-22,5,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,"Considering fried rice is their namesake dish, I was distinctly underwhelmed by the one I tried.

PROS:
The fresh-made egg on top of the rice is a nice touch. Service is polite, space is very clean, portions are more than generous considering the low prices.  Many will appreciate that you can customize your fried rice, such as without egg, or adding french fries (which I was asked upon ordering and found bizarre).

CONS: 
Fried rice is on the plain side, consists mostly of bulk-purchase peas and carrots.  But  the hefty shake of black pepper tossed on my order was awful and off-putting, it didn't make the dish spicy, just peppery and unappealing.
The curry chicken was okay- curry sauce that didn't have much heat or flavor. Disliked the large amount of peas and carrots that seemed to be incorporated into the curry.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,5,2,zytjwqrpyEGWjaHVP4y-KQ
1769206,2015-08-21,0,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,On point for pricing and taste. Got hooked up with some popcorn chicken while I waited. Super friendly staff. This place is going into the lunch rotation.,5oCU9bwxDg12pPz3IdGukQ,1,0,5,p8HrQXJOGMY6XXuIqI6y1Q
1793927,2015-07-12,2,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,"Defiantly better then all the normal take-out places in town. The fried rice is amazingly good. I'm only giving a 4 Star due to the fact that my Teriyaki Chicken was breaded popcorn chicken instead of the grilled chicken on the menu. Was still good, but not I was hoping for. And the seating isn't good. They have 3 pub tables with 2 stools each. Not a place to really sit down and eat with the family. 

We will be back, but will make sure we order ahead so the whole family doesn't have to travel for food.",fS86t0IvNj-kDBae2mJHSQ,0,0,4,N8E1hV3jOl08_17QYwVUUQ
1881671,2015-09-03,0,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,"We saw this restaurant listing in Weekly and decided to check it out. When we got to the location, it really didn't look like much. There was a banner hanging instead of an actual sign. Seating area really was limited and no bathrooms in sight.

Bob hooked us up with complimentary popcorn chicken which I thought were breaded nicely and not dry and free water bottles while we dined in. Great service! 

We ordered the house fried rice and walnut shrimp fried rice. We wanted to get the buns too but it wasn't yet available. It took a while to come out but that's because they made it to order so it was nice and hot when it made it to our table. 

I was happy that the fried rice wasnt too oily. Didn't care if they used prepackaged ingredients or cheap ones at that; the flavor was there for me and that's all that mattered. Granted the fried rice got a little salty toward the end, it didnt bother us too much. Plus I didn't feel cheated of my money. It wasn't overpriced and I felt satisfied. 

The menu is definitely extensive and they'll be adding more things to it in the future so we're looking forward to that.

Crazy Bob is quite a character! Had a great sense of humor and provided wonderful service. He treated his customers like friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. I have to say that after my bf and I had our fill, we talked with him for over an hour!

Overall, would definitely be back, especially if it means chatting with Bob.",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,0,1,5,oe1R8pJ9FKk_vpHvoNGfzQ

Lol All their rice combinations are yummy and hard to choose from. And thankfully they have my favorite, egg drop soup since it's hard to find in this side of town.

The customer service was exceptional and they hooked us up with super yummy popcorn chicken while we waited. The kids wouldn't stop eating it. The portion was enough for two people and for the price it can't be beat. I had the chicken curry, just enough hotness. We will be repeat customers here for sure.

He even took the time to talk to me. Friendly service. I came back a second time and tried the chicken teriyaki. Very good as well. I highly recommend this place. Great food and great service.

3617279,2015-09-22,3,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,"Hidden behind a gas station that must of changed brands at least a handful of times the past decade and to the right of a popular Vegas local restaurant is Angel's Fried Rice. It occupies a small space in the plaza about the size of a Panda Express's kitchen with a dining room fit for a party of 2 making it primarily a take out restaurant. 

Per the name, you'll find mostly fried rice on their menu with some appetizer items such as egg rolls and steamed open face buns. With a small menu it gives them the ability to focus more on ingredients, most importantly... the rice. Traditionally fried rice is made with left over rice as it was a way for poor families to maximize their food rather than waste it, but don't worry. Angel's is not using leftovers (how could they when they only make fried rice?). They use fresh Basmati which is a longer grain found pretty commonly in Middle Eastern food, gives it a nice bite!

Interestingly they combine the common American Chinese dishes (what you find at Panda and Chinese buffets) and put their own spin to it keep a hint of authenticity. Walnut shrimp? Its a winner. My personal favorite is the curry fried rice and potatoes. So all in all better than your average take out (and much of Chinatown's greasy rice) but not somewhere you take your mother in law from Shanghai.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,1,2,4,8JT3IZRpscNcTfrP3pPfUg

maybe when the full menu returns i will be willing to go back and give it another shot.",AwIWjaNDZ6-AwBUKCOwKtg,0,0,3,qXOAx_BZEq_OByu3dga4vQ

4675399,2015-04-23,0,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,"I work and live right off of Durango, so I had passed Angel's every day and kept meaning to try it. I think my biggest mistake was not going sooner!

The $5-$6 price for a meal would be good enough, but when you add in how friendly the staff is and that all of the food is made-to-order it really puts it over the top. Chef Bob is very personable and goes above and beyond to please customers. The fried rice is also better than you will find at any Chinese to-go restaurants, which makes sense since it is their staple. 

While the menu is small, they seem to be adding new items regularly - just today they added a whole new set of steamed buns. I got the pleasure of being one of the first to have one (they actually had to create the item in their point of sale system so that I could order it) and was floored - very, very tasty.",ABhtIUX65IKJGVoncU9pWA,0,0,5,hkzW94PU8t4T9TK-2mmW9g
5528722,2014-12-04,2,IPyrraIafBs8afeVMGmfCQ,"As a native Chinese I am pretty particular when it comes to fried rice. Growing up my grandparents taught me that an easy way to spot a real Chinese chef from a fake one is by tasting his or her fried rice dish with the most simple and basic cooking. Angel's Fried Rice is certainly a real surprise on the strip of Las Vegas. The rice they use is real basmati rice from the hills of the Himalayas. And when served hot with curry chicken, teriyaki chicken, ham & egg, and curry shrimp, curry beef meatball vas even honey walnut shrimp you can do no wrong by adding some egg rolls and hot & sour soup for a dollar. With merely seven or eight dollars you get everything you expect and more. It's no surprise to me this restaurant is owned and operated by veteran restaurant business owner Bob Tang who has successfully ran a series of restaurants in San Francisco, Beijing and now Las Vegas.",6lphX9jvs56ECpkshjECUg,3,1,5,k5qpCpEkPxM_pPU4iEcxlA

2) Friendly and fast service

My favorite dishes are the Shrimp Scampi and the Specialty Fried Rice. Take this as to-go and sit to eat at the park across the street - there is no other restaurant that can offer such experience for under $10.",3OVW_heRBQHxQE5mBRaKag,0,0,5,I6yv178-KfsEOFu8m-DVJg
