This all changed as of last night as we are currently looking for a new spot. Owner and sushi chef were a little hmmmm let's just say messed up from a tiny bit to much drinking, along comes customer to my left ( we sat in the middle of two different groups at the sushi bar ) drinking and having shots with the head chef, some conversation about where they are from is exchanged and then escalates to the head chef cussing him out taking his shirt off to show his tattoos, which ended up in customer to my right coming out of no where and playing referee for customer and Mr Head Chef who has been in jail and is from LA. Now I'm from LA myself and don't need to hear your story about what part your from or what gang you rolled with when you were younger, years in jail etc.  I don't normally go out of my way to write many reviews and I loved this place for years but if you are thinking about going here I would say try somewhere else !",5WuLl5U8q0cqlMbchdc9Pg,0,0,1,_9D2tGDMu307NiDSCqWltg

107537,2017-01-16,1,M-SS_Kr0zlC7v8kBSRa74g,"Hokaido Sushi is life changing. Chicken soup for the sushi lover's soul. Candy for people who love it in its purest, authentic form. A trip to the shores of Japan, New Zealand, Washington state, and Korea for people who can't splurge for the plane ticket or haven't renewed their passports. This place has a loyal following at the sushi bar which must be chalked up to their sushi chefs, especially head chef Sam. He is bar none the best.

Our group of four sat at the bar and ordered omakase. My husband is a diehard sushi purist and can't stop raving about the quality and taste of the fish. The entire omakase was the bomb - there's simply no better way to describe it - but if we had to pick standouts they would include the toro (fatty tuna), salmon belly, wild king salmon from New Zealand, uni from the Channel Islands, Shigoku oysters from Washington, and hamachi with thin silver of jalape√±o and cilantro. Basically find a place at the bar with Sam and he will treat you right. He may even recommend fresh fish off menu if it's available. The omakase is very reasonable - $28 pp for 10 pieces. 

My only regret is that we don't live in Vegas and therefore can't come once a week. If my husband ever went missing, Hokaido is the first place I'd check. 

Thank you Sam for a masterful meal.  Save a seat for us at the bar- we'll be back!!!",2o6gYPYwMMj0h93k6QXWEQ,4,0,5,mgWVg2oAeYiS2FkAo7ddMA

I ordered my favorite Hamachi and was disappointed with the flavor. It had a strange aftertaste I could not pinpoint but, the second order was more the normal. Both were not the usual and delicate sweetness. The stringed seaweed was outstanding, the  Mizo soup delicious and the dishes the waitress recommended to my friend were greatly enjoyed by him. With the present state of the Oceans and products taken from them; quality worldwide is not what it used to be. I refer to my experience dating between 2000 all the way back to 1969.

The yellowtail and spicy tuna were fishy smelling & the texture was mushy. As for the Crazy Horse, it was fried, so it was hard to really tell what was going on. The california rolls were fine & the habachi rice was good. If you're going for sushi, I would just say that the fish just isn't fresh at all. The worst part about the meal was the very end when I went to the restroom & found it to be dirty and there was no soap in the dispenser. Gross!

Of course they wouldn't let him do happy hour if it was to go. Not only would they not let him do this but they were very very rude. If you run a business and you're food is awesome...

         I ordered a few dishes, some unagi, a. Hawaiian roll, crunchy ebi roll, and hibachi rice. All of it in my opinion was pretty mediocre.  Not bad, not great, just average. 
     Having said that the venue is very clean, the waitresses were nice and very attentive. With lots of options to choose from on the menu. 
      The one thing that really bummed me out is there is no all you can eat sushi option, maybe I'm just a fatty, but I like to try a lot of different rolls. When they are $10 and up its tough to do that and the bill gets really expensive.  
     Anyways, if you haven't tried it yet I would say give it a go and see for youself, if you're an all you can eat kinda guy like me then save yourself a trip and skip out.",x-lzTL-p_gpCuv_IrKimnw,1,0,3,x7jIRGKVMWu4wxVngjxeyg

Variety of offerings is wide. It took us a bit to choose. Finally we settled on chicken udon noodle, and three rolls: Dark Horse, Japanese Lasagna and a classic spicy tuna. We were brought a tasty cucumber salad to get us started. Then, the noodles arrived and the rolls followed.

The noodles were really good, but near impossible to eat with chopsticks. We broke down and asked for a fork.... much easier to enjoy. The lasagna was our least favorite roll, it fell apart easily since it was baked. It was hard to get that perfect bite. Plus, I'm generally not a fan of cream cheese, but it sounded intriguing so I gave it a whirl. Lesson learned--I'm still not much of a fan. The classic spicy tuna was the favorite. Although, the Dark Horse was enjoyable. I especially liked the crunchy texture.

We went later at night, with not a very busy crowd so we were a little skeptical when we sat down at our table.  They far exceeded our expectations!  We go back very frequently for my absolute favorite sushi ever, the Philly Crunch Roll (a tempura fried philly roll with an amazing sauce).  The presentation is always awesome, except for one time.  The sushi chefs were busy entertaining some guests sitting at the bar, so we didn't get any special plating which was a little disappointing.  They have a wide variety of rolls, and they are usually really friendly.  Everything tastes really fresh (once we did get a spicy yellowtail that tasted a little less than fresh, but one time only).

Came here with my cousin for dinner and sat at the sushi bar. We love being up close and personal with the sushi chef ;) haha. Anway, while we both scanned the menu, my cousin noticed the chef prepping something that caught her attention which was the ""Marilyn Monroe"" roll - tuna, green onion, cucumber, soypaper, spicy scallop. As for me, I ordered the ""Dynamite"" and ""Bikini"" roll. The Dynamite - shrimp, scallops, clam & mushroom over rice, baked in a shell. The Bikini roll - spicy soft shell crab, cucumber, shrimp tempura, seared tuna, and avocado. 

First reaction as he served us our orders... WOAH.
Our food had flowers and carved butterflies out of carrots and radishes!!! Let me repeat.. CARVED BUTTERFLIES! That's talent! xD haha. It made me not want to eat it because it was so pretty.

1st experience: Word to the wise: NEVER COME FOR LUNCH.  It wasn't busy yet when our party of two came in for lunch. She seated us, but we had to flag her down to take our orders for food and drink. The young hostess/server took 25mins to bring our table of two water(we had to remind her) & over 30mins for our food!!! She did not apologize for the wait at all or for bringing our drinks late. I ordered 1 roll and my co-worker ordered 1 lunch special. If it wasn't for us having to flag her down every time we would've taken over an hour on our lunch break. My roll was delish, but not worth the horrid service. That was the worst service I have ever experienced.


2nd experience(for late happy hour):
Decided to give this place a second chance with my husband. Boy I felt like I was in a different restaurant! It was fairly busy. The server was different, taller and much more nicer.

We all shared:
1.  Ultimate Tuna
2.  Three Alarm Fire
3.  Almost Crazy Tuna

All three rolls were fantastically flavorful and well done.  Just enough sauce to rice to fish ratio's.  A bonus was that the uni was unbelievably eye rolling fresh (on a Saturday)!!!!

The ""monkey brain"" my friend ordered, which thankfully was nothing like the images from an Indiana Jones movie that I conjured, was also terrific. We opted for some vanilla and strawberry mochi ice cream for dessert.

Not sure what to order, our table decided to order 3 bento boxes to have some variety. On the list of things we tried: grilled saba, california roll, albacore tuna sashimi, tonkatsu, tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, and veggie tempura. Each bento came with salad, rice and miso soup.

The sides of miso soup, salad, california roll were all okay - nothing special. The grilled saba was good.

The albacore sashimi was pretty bad. There were 5 thinly sliced, grey, mushy, watery pieces of fish with a very strong fishy odour. Certainly not good quality. The salmon sashimi was not cut in the proper manner and appeared like rectangular blocks. The tuna sashimi was okay. 

My husband's tonkatsu was poor. Pounded too thin and likely using meat that doesn't have enough fat content, it caused the end product to be too dry and hard. 

The veggie tempura was difficult to eat, greasy and unpleasantly hard.

Their sashimi is amazing and the sushi chefs go above and beyond their calling - always making efforts to get unique types of fish and ensuring that whatever they have is of the best quality. 

This is not an AYCE sushi joint and that is part of the reason I like it so much. At many AYCE places, the sushi becomes less special. The chefs often don't spend as much time on the rolls or don't put a whole lot of fish in the rolls. 

These guys make AMAZING rolls. The flavors are always different from what you will find at most sushi places in Vegas. Something about this place just makes me feel happy and comfortable and not rushed or bombarded with 900 different options for sushi. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. The sushi chefs are so talented and also extremely entertaining.

The sushi chef helped us by recommending kind of like a surf and turf sushi which was delicious. Then he made a spicy jalape√±o roll for my boyfriend which was a bit too spicy for me, but he made it up by suggesting his take on what I am used to calling a crunchy roll.

Hokaido has the kind of quality food and fish from a higher-class sushi restaurant--the kind that usually reside on the strip--but have hole-in-the-wall sushi joint prices.  Their list of rolls is pretty impressive and affordable, and the actual entrees are decent too. My cousin and I shared a shrimp tempura roll along with our bento boxes ($7.95 for a kids bento box is a steal by the way) which actually came with a lot of food. I chose the two-item bento box for $11.95 and had some of the best vegetable tempura I've ever had in a Las Vegas sushi place. I'm a big fan of tempura and tend to order it whenever I try a new sushi place and this tempura batter was top-notch.  Much lighter, crispier, and done well but not too well done. No soggy spots and it wasn't dripping in oil either. Pretty much just yum-tastic. 

The spicy tuna roll that came with my bento was okay, I've had far better spicy tuna at Sushi Wa, but this wasn't far off the mark. I think the tuna may have been a little on the ripe side, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. I've noticed that Las Vegas sushi places rarely have the kind of fresh fish I've had at coastal sushi restaurants, which is obvious since we live in a desert. But the spicy factor wasn't too overbearing, which I appreciated since I've been to way too many sushi joints where they over flavor the fish to the point where you can't even tell what kind of fish you're having. 

Overall it was a really great place with really great prices. I hope to return soon to try more of their creative sushi concotions.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,2,1,4,yAj6zPE8pkPtHicmlzT_UA

The waitress had an attitude, walked up basically shoved all the dirty crap from one side to the other to make a space in the middle so we would be flanked by dirty piled up dishes. It was unsanitary, it was gross, and the waitress had a major attitude. And there was nobody in the restaurant, it was basically empty.

Yesterday was a different story. When we came in on a Saturday night, we were surprised that only 1 table was occupied. My bf was seated right away and I came in 10 minutes after. 

We tried the following: oyster shooters, hamachi kama, Bikini Roll, Red Rock Roll and Kiss my Ass Roll. We also tried some nigiris... Cajun Albacore, Hamachi, Super White Tuna and Maguro Tuna. The nigiris were good but not the best I've tasted. The Bikini and Red Rock rolls were delicious. Those two rolls were different. A must try when you visit Hokkaido. However, the Kiss my Ass was a disappointment. We did not like the gravy sauce that was drizzled on top of it. The hamachi Kama was decent size for the price and pretty good too.

The service was good. The server was very attentive on refilling our drinks and giving me pickled ginger. Though I am not sure if I can say this if the restaurant was half full.",tGnRCFvDip0lerDKtRSa6A,1,1,4,TCJ86Se6qOUGPEiY0P4Bdw

They have HH everyday 2pm - 5pm & RHH 9pm - close which is always a plus for me if I just wanna drive down the street to get a quick bite of something. 

FANNY BAY OYSTER $2.50 - uhhh.... I was a bit disappointed w/ this one... IMHO I feel like the oyster was old or it was FANNY bay oysters... it had the distinct flavor that usually makes me dislike oysters that my parents usually love... & I have had FANNY bay before & I love them. =\ 

PREMIUM UNI SUSHI $14.50 - this was DERICIOUS! plus they give you a pretty large amount... but definitely a bit more pricey than other places we went to recently.

HH 8 PIECE CALI ROLL $3.50 - I was craving a California roll from the last time I ate sushi at NAKED sushi since they made it with crab stick instead if the blended crab & Mayo. I scarffed this roll down ahahahha

HH 4 PIECE AVO ROLL $1.95 - so cheap & can't go wrong w/ avocado rolls. 

HH DBL SALMON ROLL $8.50 - so I will assume this was good.... because my other half scarffed it down before I could turn around to take a picture....

HH SALMON SUSHI $3.25 - the chef gave us the salmon belly part & it just melted right on your tongue.

My wife finally got me to come here again and I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, their lunch specials have improved.  The Lunch Box Special is 8.95 and your choice of meat (steak you add $1.00).   Brown rice is another substitute that you can get at another $1.00.  That brings lunch to over $10.00 per person, but the quality is very good and worth it!

I ordered the Lunch Box Special with Chicken and Beef and brown rice, my wife ordered the Lunch Box Special with double beef.  Both meals came with Miso Soup as an appetizer.  It included a nice salad, 4 pieces of California roll sushi, rice and your choice of meets.  We also ordered the Tuna Poki (Poke) which was very delicious and came with seaweed salad as well.  

Very delicious.

We waited 20 minutes without being acknowledged or even given water.  So for the first time in my life I walked out, the manager chased after us and offered 50 percent off our whole meal if we came back.  We told him we'd come back another time, and we will.  However I had to tell this story to preface what an odd night this was.

Things didn't start off well at Hokaido, the host yelled at us in an extremely loud voice when we first got in and then our waitress rushed us on drink and appetizer orders before we had a chance to breathe(you can see how this night was starting off weird for us).  We were ready to order drinks and did, then we felt rushed to order something else so we ordered Miso soups.  The soups were great, she then gave us more time to figure out what to order.  We ordered quite a bit of food and for the most part it was really good.  

The boy ordered a bento box with salmon sashimi and chicken katsu.  He received tuna sashimi.  Tuna is good and he liked it but it's kind of odd.  I ordered hamachi sashimi, 2 rolls and what is basically their take on jalapeno poppers.  We then asked if they had fresh wasabi, she said they did but they would have to charge us.  

-My hamachi sashimi was very poorly cut, the blood line was left on it and it was a rather thick slab.  I'm used to hamachi tasting like butter but this was so big and bulky and the blood line made it taste a little off.
-My rolls were nice, I had the double hamachi which was just ok and the Mexican roll which was very good.  
-The Jalapeno ""poppers"" were probably my favorite.  They are stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese, tempura battered and fried with a nice sweet sauce.  They aren't super cooked, they are kind of crunchy still and very yummy.  I recommend this for sure.

The big issue was with their ""fresh wasabi"" that they charged us $2 for.  IT WASNT FRESH WASABI!  It looked like grated jalapenos or seranos with maybe some wasabi powder in it.  It was wet and had seeds in it, not what fresh wasabi looks like.  If you don't have something, tell us, don't pretend you have it.  This is very bad and makes me not want to go back there again even though it is close and the rest of the meal was ok.

Up until 5 months ago I had never tried sushi before and this was my virgin experience...and I was hooked instantly. I have since tried sushi in many other restaurants and while they are ok none of them have even a patch on Hokaido.

The staff are all very friendly and funny and like to engage with their customers, unlike a lot of restaurants. They are VERY child friendly, and I often take my youngest sister who is 3 and always requests to go here. 

They have so many delicious rolls, the top favourites of mine are the Muchi Muchi, the Red Mountain & the Tiger roll, but that said each one of their rolls are amazing and I've never not liked a roll. 

The Chicken Katsu is also to die for along with their Dynamite, Tempura Shrimp & Veg, and their Teriyaki Salmon.

Yes it is pricy but you get what you pay for, quality produce, incredible dishes and outstanding presentation. It is also about 15 mins drive from the strip, but well worth the trip. A lot of my friends come from out of town and the first thing they always request...HOKAIDO

The only bad part of the meal was sake, it had a little funk to it, like maybe it was really low end. Salad was the standard gingery-sweet & spicy dressing but refreshing and good. 

What impressed me was the quality of their nigiri. Also, this was one of the better spicy tuna rolls I have had in a long time between the freshness of the fish and the taste of their mix.

- Kamikaze roll ($11.00) - eel tempura roll with spicy tuna and avocado. Absolutely loved it!
- Rock 'n Roll ($12.50) - 5 kinds of  generously cut  fresh fish and crab wrapped in cucumber.

Their menu is filled with all the prerequisite creatively-named rolls that contemporary sushi joints have but from what I saw of other rolls being served they are beautifully presented and quite large.

The staff and sushi chefs were incredibly friendly and treated everyone like they were old friends. The atmosphere isn't as modern as the rolls they serve, but it's still a comfortable environment.

This place was my ""little gem"" on the west side - a delightful little sushi bar with exceptional food.

The thing that made Hokaido Sushi so great was the sushi chef - Eddie, but he's gone now - and so is my love for this place. 

The chefs who remain do a marvelous job and the quality of the fish has not diminished one bit, but the magic is gone and the place just isn't the same.

Lasagna roll
The bikini roll

I was upset beacuse I thought I would never find a sushi place comparable to the Bay Area since I moved to Vegas.  But I finally found one that comes close!  I'm so happy and excited about it!

Must haves:
- Garlic Edamame...deep fried and garlicky!
- Ebi Crunch...my favorite!
- Something Wrong # 69..ain't nothing wrong! haha!
- Vegas...no rice but still good

I like how the sushi that does have rice, doesn't really have that much rice!  Sushi is very flavorful, and different!  Hokaido is definitely creative in their sushi creations.  I've also had the agedashi tofu, gyoza, and tempura ice cream.  Appetizers were good, but the ice cream was freezer burned on the inside of the fried shell BOO!  Also, do not order the double hamachi; it totally takes away from the Hamachi and it's way too saucy.  Just get the regular Nigiri Hamachi if you're craving it.  Freshness!

The rolls are amazing and the fish quality is very good, but it's a only a notch or two better than Jjanga or Sushi Koma.  I would still recommend though, because they have an awesome Screaming Orgasm salad - you may want to ask for them to leave the furikake seasoning off of it, because it tasted weird to me.  Nigiri was just okay, and I would probably skip it next time.  

Happy Hour menu is not as great of a deal as some other places.  Prices looks great until you realize it's for half rolls.  But it works out to be a $2-3 discount on a selection of $12-13 rolls.",6B9ICWLdY9C7gGPkRX93ZQ,0,3,4,PfqLCH--3e5BObzjd4SRKw

4669649,2010-04-11,0,M-SS_Kr0zlC7v8kBSRa74g,"Hokaido Sushi has one of the most creative and nicely garnished sushi I've seen.

Our group didn't order any nigri (except for Uni) or sashimi, so I really couldn't gauge the true freshness of the fish. Nothing had the bad fishy taste, so I'll give them the okay in that department.

* Gyoza - It was good, but Ichiza's gyoza is much better. The waitress said it was pan fried, but I have my doubts based on the crispiness of the skin. The crispiness took away some of the flavors away from the gyoza.

* Yellowtail Appetizer - I believe this was the yellowtail with some jalepeno, garlic, and onions. Refreshing and clean tasting.

* Uni - fresh and creamy with a nice golden yellow color. delicious.

* Surf & Turf - This has a nice piece of steak on top of the sushi. Taste wise it works very well. You may not like the texture since the steak on top isn't as soft as eating a fish.

* House Special Spicy Hokaido - This thing was fairly hot, killing my taste buds. Good thing it was at the end of the meal. Maybe a less spicy roll with less chili paste and jalape√±o wouldn't kill the taste of it. 

* Bikini, Red Rock, Something Wrong #69 - All of these were good. No complaints.

Service could have been better. We were missing 2 placemats in our group of 4. She forgot one of our orders, which is hard to believe considering we didn't order that much. She wasn't very attentive even when we were the only group in the sushi bar. She was not filling up our drinks in a timely manner or wasn't there when we needed something. She didn't seem to have any knowledge of the house special rolls, having to rely on the sushi chefs. While she was very kind and friendly, she seems very inexperienced. This should be an easy fix for the business if they're reading this.

This place uses a lot of garnish, even more garnish than the sushi and has a lot of creative rolls that are actually executed right. Every sushi plate that came out truly looks like an artwork.

and the Sweetheart Roll which our sushi chef recommended, it's ""baked"" meaning they torch it to ""bake"" the top salmon, it also included spicy crab, shrimp tempura, and roe. It was full of flavor and very delicious

Although the quality of the food was fantastic, the minor problems here are:
-The drive is definitely quite away from the strip, about 8 miles? We were in the mood for some good sushi so yelped led the way.

I am a roll fan (so I guess I would be considered not to be an aficionado when it comes to sushi) but we enjoyed the selection of rolls and the flexibility we were allowed in substituting here and there with contents and toppers for the rolls (spicy crab in lieu of Spicy Tuna; Rainbow rolls with Jalapenos rolled on the inside, etc) We found several rolls to our liking and were very pleased with the presentation, the time it took to be served, the kindness of our waitress (who was willing to help my newbie brother out with a chopsticks cheater tool :-))

Rolls were served 4 pieces to a order. 

We got salmon skin roll ($2.75) - decent,  but standard. I like the beet butterfly they did as garnish - pretty. 

Hawaiian roll (around $5.25) - pretty decent again, but standard. It has spicy tuna, wrapped in various fish with ponzu. 

It didnt seem happy hour was much of a deal generally, there were a few items on major discount. It can make for good variety since its half rolls but once you add up 2x orders its close to the normal roll price. Theres no happy hour menu or mention of it on their site, but its a select menu of alcohol, rolls, and some appetizers on special. The sake bombs were a good deal though, I believe $3.

At this point we decide going with a dinner bento is probably best than going all happy hour.  

We shared a 3 item combo -

*Albacore sashimi (5pc) - it was pretty fresh actually,  no complaints there.
*Tonkatsu - nicely crisp, it was a bit dry. 
*Spicy chicken - was Korean style with onions, zucchini, and chicken in a spicy sauce. It wasn't too spicy though but it was flavorful.  

Miso soup and salad that comes with is again, decent but standard fare. 

Service was fairly decent.

Went to Hokaido for date night with my wife, we walked in to restaurant, two sushi chefs at bar were leaning on prep area with elbows playing games on their phones. After they noticed we were watching them, they both dropped to the floor to continue to play their games. We took that as a sign, paid for our drink and quickly left. I guess our first clue should have been that we were one of two tables at dinner time. 

Not at all what I would expect walking into a sushi restaurant, went to Sushi Fever on Sahara, sat in a packed house and had a great dinner.

I was quickly greeted and asked for a table. There were only 2 other tables of people dining which made for a quick turn around on my sushi order. The salmon nigiri melted in my mouth it was so fresh and sweet. The ikura was small but tasty and the roll I ordered was executed perfectly. The roll was called the ""I love my ass"" roll. With chopped soft shell crab inside and yellowtail to top, it came with a sweet yet tart mustard sauce. The waitress was attentive and kept my drink refilled. I'll agree that for a non-ayce sushi place, the prices are a bit high. Uni was $12 or $14.50 for a premium version. My bill was $28 after a 20% tip.

Ordered the Hawaiian Roll, Caterpillar Roll, Dragon Roll & the Lobster Roll.
I LOVED the Hawaiian Roll & the Lobster Roll! You could really taste the freshness of the tuna in the Hawaiian, & the Lobster had this great sauce on top!

The best sushi place Vegas! I eat sushi at least once a week and this is probably the best in town. I have eaten at numerous local sushi places throughout Vegas and some of the upper scale places on the strip and this place ranks high among the top! if not THEE BEST! LIKE A PARTY IN MY MOUTH! From the moment you walk in the staff greet you with a sincere and warm welcome. Ya know,  when they yell something that you have no idea what it means, but it sounds good?  They go out of there way to make you feel at home. The sushi bar is a great spot to sit and watch Sushi Chef Eric. It is a pleasure to watch him work his magic and make some of the most beautiful and delicious rolls. Every dish is a masterpice with intricate garnishes full of art, all hand carved and made to order. He spends his time laying every roll down perfectly to ensure that the presentation is just as visually appealing as it tastes. Gyoza is a great appetizer to order, make sure to get it deep fried for extra crunchiness. The sweet heart roll brings all the great elements together of hot and cold, sweet and salty, and soft and crunchy. The rice is perfectly cooked and holds the roll together, it is topped with fresh salmon broiled with a flame thrower right before it is served. 

I've read some of the reviews on this place and yes it is a little on the higher price point, BUT C'MON!! If you are a true sushi fanatic, you know you pay for freshness!! You can't even get ALL YOU CAN EAT here. Ya know why!? BECAUSE ITS QUALITY!! 

If you see me at the sushi bar, buy me a drink. Preferably a sake bomb.",hlVWGy_t796fbk_iETH5kA,4,4,5,9haQsqLJ9deQHfo0l0oBgg

The lady on the phone told me 20-25 min . This is much longer then usual but no big deal . Got to the restaurant , Paid , tipped , then was told 10 more minutes . I went and sat with my husband in the car, waited the 10 minutes then went back in . I waited 3-4 minutes and no one came up to the front so I went back and sat in car for a few more minutes. When I went back in it had been 35 minutes since I placed this very small order . The lady tells me it's going to be another 10 minutes . At this point I'm frustrated because there were people that had come into the restaurant after I got there to dine in that were being served sushi but I couldn't get my order ?!? I told the lady I would just take a refund . She didn't know how to give a refund so she had to call someone on the phone to figure it out. It took 10 minutes just to get the refund and obviously the California rolls still weren't ready . This was ridiculous . If you can't fulfill an order, you could tell me on the phone instead of wasting my time , gas , and sanity ! NEVER AGAIN ! Oh, and don't tip BEFORE you get your order like I did . It cost me a couple bux in the end to be treated like a second class citizen because I wasn't dining in I suppose .

From the outside it doesn't look like much. It's in a strip mall and if you're not looking you'd pass right by. When we drove up I thought I'd be let down.

When we walked in I was under impressed by the decor (which is why I give it 4 stars, atmosphere means a lot to me). But we were instantly greeted by the sushi chefs with some sort of call out, which was fun and welcoming. We were instantly seated and although the place was slow (only one other couple there) it was clean and pleasant.

After we ordered we were brought a really tasty cucumber salad. It was so good we asked for seconds, and got it no problem, with no extra charge. Our waitress was sweet and very patient. We took a long time to figure out what we wanted, and we ordered twice because we wanted more.

The menu is entertaining, with names like 'I love my ass'. We ordered that along with  'something's wrong with 69', ""monkey brains' and 'slippery nipple' (I think these were the names). We added some tuna and salmon sashimi and all in all we trilled with our choices! The '69' and the 'nipple' were amazing!!
