1925904,2016-11-16,0,6OftN85zwsd_PRxSYhgQCQ,"I went to this Burger King via drive-thru yesterday. I ordered 2 Bacon DOUBLE Cheeseburgers plain. I paid for 2 Bacon DOUBLE Cheeseburgers plain. I received 2 Bacon cheeseburgers plain. Since it was drive thru I didn't discover this until I was all the way back at my office. 

I filled out the online survey and stated I wanted to have someone contact me. It has been 24 hrs and 
I  have had no contact. This seems about on par with Burger King. In the past there were a couple locations I filled out the survey, asked for someone to contact me, and heard nothing. 

I think it is about time I take them off my list of acceptable dining locations.",0o_JtYrz5FRVMcAEVmf42w,0,0,2,UMWMRCEbXSm6r-NfKk_1Ww

It is a little out of the way for me, but I was pleased to find out that the service was super fast and the staff was very friendly!

To my luck they had 2 open drive thru lanes. Yes!! Then wth....another car pulled up on the other lane and here I am waiting for someone to take my order but they got their orders first and then the car in back of me decided to switch lane thinking maybe the first lane speaker was not working. Well, this was a one time deal so I know I won't be back here for sure. Happy eats!!",Jtoi5k9Pw_L4MOP4SfJTNg,0,0,2,pVoc46coVGGEQ977cgjoRA

Multiple employees doing an excellent job makes me think they must have a good manager or something. Regardless, they're doing something right.",EK6Adit8h21WnhTY0J3T_A,0,0,5,324ItqlB9HXPtj2wPi2hpw
3642861,2018-05-23,0,6OftN85zwsd_PRxSYhgQCQ,Once again Burger King is screwing up DoorDash drivers!!! Each restaurant that has a tablet has ten minutes to prepare an order before a dasher is given an assignment. Then it takes dashers time to get to the restaurant. You would think these orders would be done but no. I was just informed by the manager that they will not make an order until a dasher arrives which contradicts the use of the tablet. DoorDash only gives dashers 5-9 mins to pick up tablet orders. Not only that but they make dashers wait in line to order the food. They don't allow us to go through the drive thru. Due to all of these factors they cause dashers to deliver food to customers very late making it look like drivers are the problem. Educate yourselves. Tablet orders are supposed to be made before we arrive!!! If you want to do orders like jack and Taco Bell then make it to where we can go through the drive thru and order the food and pay with our red card and get rid of the tablet so DoorDash gives us the appropriate time to wait for these orders.

I really want to say, thank you, to Max. He was very nice to my outrageous sons, who were very loud & all over the place that day. As I was trying to hurry & leave, my baby had a mini meltdown down & her little foot kicked my newly refilled drink off the table. I would normal clean it myself, but my sons were just too much that day. Kids will be kids, but they were over doing it, I had to go. Max ended up cleaning it for me, which I totally appreciate. Some may feel its his job, but I'm an adult, plus I was taught growing up, you clean up what you mess up. Thank you, here's 5 stars for you!",jhTQDxKZMsWN0SrZXMuv5Q,1,0,5,GZiNCMRgajFcyvR6-LhNmA
5604468,2018-01-13,0,6OftN85zwsd_PRxSYhgQCQ,"My 2-year-old was almost going to dance on the tables! This location sports about 25-30 parking spots. The service is courteous and respectful. Our takeout was delivered about 2 minutes from ordering, and we came in at lunch hour on a Saturday - it was a consistent and steady speed coming from the kitchen. Food was just the right temp (not burnt, but not undercooked). I'm glad to see about 3-4 families here each time dining with their young children. Even though there is no play area facility, my kiddos still enjoy coming here for the food. There are about 7 family-sized seating booths, and 2 couples booths. The remaining consist of 1 family high-table, and 7 family tables. To our liking, condiments are given in individual sized packets, not the self-serve pumps. Yes we are wierd like that :)",lIXDiXM-gh1F1L4O-HxkQQ,1,0,4,SoOkAUzAs8NYvx7miA_ZeQ
