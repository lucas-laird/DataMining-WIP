Not as big as the strip buffets nor exotic. But it's cheaper, and if you're in Vegas you must try atleast one buffet in downtown and it should be in one.

It was really good. I got the nachos, the taquitos, the beef brisket, the BBQ rib, the pepperoni pizza, the garlic bread, and the chocolate cake. The nachos were good, the cheese wasn't spicy at all (which I like). The taquitos were about Rubios quality (not that great) but hey, it's a buffet. Everything doesn't have to be perfect at buffets. The beef brisket had some fatty parts, but I cut those off. The meat was pretty darn good. The BBQ rib was good, but there isn't that much meat on them, so I would take 2 or 3 ribs. The pepperoni pizza had an interesting flavor. It was pretty good. The garlic bread was OK. The chocolate cake was delicious. It was not overwhelmed by the cake or the frosting. They were both delicious. It also had a few sprinkles on it. For a drink, I just had regular old Pepsi. So not much to say about that. The price was great, about $13.50 per person. Overall, a good place to eat!",8qCWEG3JFZOufRAP9zCabg,0,0,4,9rgdYheDAVJbEq-OKjWUOw

There was a ton of sitting area and not too many people when we went. The price was much cheaper than any other buffet you can find in Vegas. There were plenty of food options, so there wasn't much to complain about. The only thing I could think of was that some of the food wasn't hot enough.

147586,2010-12-26,0,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"My son and I ate dinner here on 12/23/10. 

The original plan was to buffet at the Bellagio or Wynn but then I came up with the idea that since the man-child hadn't been to Vegas since he was about 8, it would be better if he tried out the more modest venues in stuffing-one's-face so he wouldn't be too ""spoiled"" or something like that in these days of particular hardship. (Yeah, ok, well whatever).  He's a good sport and agreed to try this place since reviews were mixed and not too horrible. And their ""Steak/Scampi"" Thursday night special also helped convince him.

Line wasn't too long. Signed up for their players club so dinner was about $18 each. Friendly, quick server to take our drink orders. 

The ""scampi"" was.....interesting. It wasn't awful but it weren't scampi e'ther. It was in some kind of bland creamy sauce which garlic had never met. Best to eat it first and fast because as it cools down .....well, just eat it as soon as possible.

Steak - the 14-y-o man-child can grill a skirt steak that would be about 15x better than what was served here. It was tough, and full of fat and gristle. 

Salads - green salad was rusty and wilted. Didn't try any others but as far as presentation - very lacking.

Pizza was plentiful - just ok - like frozen grocery store quality

Mexican entres - looked bad, very bad, only tried the taquitos. Blah and if there was filling in there it was miniscule - don't try if you have dentures

Mashed potatoes - ok

Fried chicken - the man-child only rarely is allowed to eat fried chicken although he loves it - he excitedly ate a piece and that was the only piece he wanted. 

Desserts - if you LOVE pudding, then this is potentially your heaven. Didn't try it but there is PLENTY available in a couple of flavors.
Banana cream pie - one bite - stop
Lemon meraingue pie - best thing that night.

Again, our server was very good, kept me in ice tea and took away dirty dishes in good time.",-GtG6H1vYHCOcStY_setHw,0,0,1,gL4lXy49veChpqLuvS_Yzw

During the weekend brunch buffet (currently from 7am to 3pm), the eggs Benedict are a sure winner (though the muffins may get a little toughened up from the warmer).  The bacon is always firm but never over-crisped.  The fruit selection could be better, but unlike other buffets, much of the fruit is served in large slices (quarter slices of pineapple and watermelon) instead of canned chunks.  Be sure to get a mimosa!

In two years of coming here, the only time we've encountered average food was with items that don't hold up to warmers very well such as pancakes and croissants.

The goal of the casino is to earn your business through a hook- in this case the free buffet. This business strategy is a huge miss if your service isn't in order. Again the goal was to earn my business in the casino they couldn't even get me a drink order or clean away my plates. The manager was clueless the staff looked miserable. What a mess.

They had a nice assortment of other stuff like Mexican, Chinese, Pizza and what not and just about everything I had was pretty good. The bread pudding I had for dessert was better than the one I had at wicked spoon earlier in the week.

As of 9/1/12, each person has to enter the PIN associated with their players' card to receive the $1 discount.

With the exceptions of their special nights, Tuesday - T-Bone night, Thursday - Steak & Scampi night, Friday - Seafood night, and Saturday - Prime Rib night, the menu always remains the same. Not that the menu is bad. The food is OK, but not great.

They have the same stations that almost all buffet's have. Their salad station is not very large, but it has a lot of choices to go onto your salad. My biggest complaint about the salad bar is that the only lettuce that have is iceberg. Please give us some more choices. The Italian station has pizza, pastas, and garlic bread. All are pretty good again, but not great. The Mexican and Asian stations have some good choices. I do think they have one of the best spring rolls of many of the buffets I have been to.

The meat station usually has several choices. I have had turkey, ham, prime rib and more. They have a Italian Sausage that is always very tasty. My wife had some spaghetti and said the sauce was only OK. Then she added the Italian Sausage and it brought a lot of flavor to the pasta. Every time I go the meat station seems to have Brisket and I try it every time. I love Brisket. It can make one of the best BBQ sandwiches if done right. But, their Brisket has never been that good. It is always fatty and hard to chew. The flavor is not even worth mentioning.

I know I seem to be hard on the Garden Court Buffet. But, the chef's put out a good presentation. I think the main issue is the quality of what they have to work with. If they were given better ingredients to start with I know this would be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. If they had better ingredients to work with, the cost would have to go up though. I think it would be worth it.

We went to this buffet, for the first time, on Thursday night which features Steak and Shrimp. The steaks were delicious almost melting in your mouth. My wife cut her steak with a butter knife.

We went the next Thursday for the same featured Steak and Shrimp. This time the steaks were tough and we had trouble cutting it with steak knives. We immediately stacked the plates with the steaks for removal. We informed the waiter and he said to wait, try it again in 30 minutes, and perhaps the steaks would be from another strip of beef. We waited 30 minutes and sampled various items during our respite. The Italian Sausage was overcooked and hard, the enchiladas were also overcooked and hard. It was as if the chef wasn't working that evening and underlings were cooking, unsupervised. After 30 minutes we went back up, informed the steak server of how tough our previous steaks had been. He shrugged his shoulders and said, ""try another."" Once again the steak was tough and inedible. We tipped the waiter and left, it wasn't his fault.

I don't know what has happened, but our breakfast buffet was extremely disappointing.  It's one of the most inexpensive breakfast buffets you will find in Las Vegas.  It's only $8.  But even for that price, we wouldn't go back again.

The coffee was the worst we've ever had.  It was served in plastic mugs and was very watery.  I could barely drink it.  The orange juice was almost as bad.  We tried a variety of items.  We were disappointed with everything except the omelet, coconut donut, and cinnamon rolls.

We arrived around 8:30 am on a weekday morning in early April and there was no line.  When we left around 9:30, there was still no line.  So, I think it's safe to say you won't have to wait to get into this breakfast buffet.

Conclusion:  If you have very low expectations, you might not be disappointed by this breakfast buffet.  For the same price, we found the breakfast buffet at the Orleans to be better.  Of all the buffets we went to during our 5-day stay, this was by far the worst.

In the meantime I had gone back to the car with my daughter to clean her up and by the time I got back to the table, my wife and I were also feeling nauseous. Again, the vomit was STILL there. 30 minutes had now past. Needless to say I was furious...(and feeling pretty sick!) On our way out I told the cashier that I wanted to see the manager. I had to wait another fifteen minutes for this guy to come.  (On an aside, he vaguely looked like Uncle Junior from the Sopranos.....Vegas baby Vegas!) He promptly started getting on the case of some of the employees and then wound up refunding our meals.  Horrible experience overall. At the end of the evening I wound up vomiting back in my hotel room from the nastiness and vileness of the food from this buffet. All day I felt nauseous. Here is the bottom line. Spend a few extra bucks and go to a nicer buffet in a hotel where you won't gag as a result of the cigarette smoke wafting through air. You'll be much happier!",0e8CURuzM1JiBbFkSdwzwg,3,0,1,gUqslN-qEXEBjQKMwTTHdA

About a good 10 minutes and we finally got to pay. Then there was a 3 minute wait to get to a table because it was crowded. 

There was a Asian food section, salad section, seafood section, friend section, dessert section, pizza section...etc. There were a couple others, but i forgot. I started off with a big salad with blue cheese dressing. Then i have some pasta with a red clam sauce. The sauce was not very good so i didn't very much of that. I had some fried and baked chicken, and other assortments of food. They have a self-serve yogurt machine so that was awesome. 

Overall, like i said before, it was okay. I wish the food tasted better and i would have gone back for 3rds. Right now i feel hungry because i didn't want to stuff myself with OK food. It was Friday night so i think it was crab legs night so i got a plate of those to try and get my money's worth. The legs were hard to open so it was a pain in my ass to eat the crab.

I've been here for their Champagne Brunch. Pretty standard selection but good enough to satisfy your morning cravings. The champagne is free flowing and you can always order a side of orange juice to make your own mimosa!

Filipino tip: They have ox tail at the far end of the Asian section. My family loved it and said it tasted like ""kare kare"". And if you're familiar with that dish, might be worth giving a try. They also kept saying how the oxtail was worth the price of the buffet alone.

Lunch price player's card for $7.99 and without for $8.99. The array of food is a decent spread from the typical choices of southern style cooking to a unique Hawaiian style kalua pork with cabbage.

The deep fried chicken was moist with a pretty good crunch. The brisket from the carving station was tasty and juicy. The sides of collard greens with pork, sweet buttered corn on the cobs along with the mashed potato truly was a southern treat! The sweet potato with their great tasting butter and some stuffing made me miss Thanksgiving Holiday all over again!
 
The Hawaiian style kalua pork with cabbage I was very impressed! The pork was so tender, juicy and seasoned well! The crunch from the cabbage made it more delightful! I've gone to a lot of Hawaiian restaurants around town that serves kalua pork and this is one of the best I've had! Other locations  are either too salty or too smokey for my taste buds. The salad bar was a decent spread of greens and the highlight for me on this section was the real bacon bits that were so delicious and crunchy I could garnish it with anything and everything! I came in at the right time before they get soggy and lose the crispiness! 

I must say that they do live up to their advertisement! ""Biggest and Best Buffet Downtown""!

The buffet is only $9 for dinner ($8 if you join their player's club) and offers a whole array of American classics, from fried chicken to roast beef and manicotti, to pork shoulder and make-your-own-tacos.  There are also pasta salads, mashed and baked potatoes, green beans, steamed carrots, etc.  The only thing really missing are ribs.  The casino seems attract Filipino/Hawaiians, so there were a few Chinese/Filipino/Hawaiian offerings as well.

We weren't too hungry so we didn't taste that many dishes, but the manapua (Hawaiian steamed pork buns) were the best I've tasted.  The pork had the perfect combination of acid and sweetness and they kept very well in the steam table.  I wholeheartedly recommend this.  The other winner are the mashed potatoes.  They are perfectly seasoned and taste just of what they are.  The kalua pork was also pretty good, but as the main flavor in this dish is liquid smoke, it's hard to get it wrong.

Other dishes weren't as great.  My daughters enjoyed the ""make your own tacos"" station and I liked the tortilla chips, but the guacamole needed more avocado.  The fried chicken was crispy, but it tasted like the microwavable kind.  The lumpia and chow mein both needed more seasoning.  My husband liked the pasta salad (or was it potato salad?), but it wasn't cold enough.

The biggest loser of the day was the mac & cheese  I didn't taste it, but my daughter could barely stomach one bite - and this is not a picky child.  The other loser was the melon, which was unripe and not sweet.

Desserts were the best part.  Their banana cream pie was particularly tasty, but their key lime pie wasn't bad - though too sour.  The cheesecake was great, if a bit sweet.  Everyone's favorite, of course, was the soft-serve station.  There are many other choices, however: from pies to pastries to puddings.

The usual suspects were the Spice Market and Bellagio buffets, and while they're decent, we weren't in the mood for long lines - especially considering that my friend decided to go and break a leg, literally. 

Seeing how this place had some solid reviews, combined with the $10.99 (!!!!) price tag, we figured it definitely warranted a chance. We got to the buffet around noon and there was no line and we were seated immediately. There were a good amount of people inside. 

The buffet consisted of an omelette and breakfast station, southern and mexican food, a soup and salad bar and a dessert station. The food that I did try was quite good - although I'm sure my expectations weren't that high to begin with. The cinnamon rolls were fresh and amazing. The only downside - the desserts sucked. All of them. 

Also, the buffet included champagne, and many mimosas were had. Our server wasn't very attentive on the refills, though, and we'd see her chatting it up and have to wave her down. 

All in all, I'd come back, both for the price and not having to wait in a long ass line. (And the champagne, of course.)",BOt3e_p8O8fGFhmaKOTOcA,1,0,4,0m5BsdKq2rNOtlyT1oULKA

Service was excellent.  She asked for our drink preference and came back many times to check on us.  That deserved another 5 star.

Ultimately, it does come down to the food.  I rate that a 2.  I started off w/the garden salad.  It was iceberg lettuce only and then I added toppings.  There were maybe a maximum of 10 toppings.  The bacon looked like it was made onsite (not from jar or bag), but it was overcooked.  My second plate was the ""American"" food:  meatloaf (just okay with slightly overwhelming red pepper taste); mashed potato and corn (ordinary); and sausage, fish w/terragon sauce, vegetable lasagna (none tasted good).  Most of that plate was not eaten.  My next plate was kalua pork and chicken pancit (OK).  The best item was probably the fried chicken if you got the right pieces.  We had a couple of thighs that were juicy inside and golden crispy outside.

I visited Vegas recently and decided that I wanted to have dinner with friends at Main Street Station Buffet (MSSB) on Christmas Eve. I soon discovered that this isn't the place you want to spend anytime at, no matter what the occasion. It was just that bad. The broccoli spears were ice cold and limp. Need I say more? All other fare left much to be desired and my table mates were not raving about much of anything either. For me the highlight of eating at MSSB used to be the bread pudding. Trust me, it's not the same. As we continued with our meal, a wave of guilt swept over me for even suggesting this place. I sought redemption and they ultimately forgave me.

Once upon a time in Vegas, you could get a good buffet really cheap. Mainstreet remains one of the cheapest at about 10 bucks with all the rest approaching 20 or more. Can you imagine spending 20 bucks for a buffet? You don't even get table service except to clear your used plates and refill your drink, if you're lucky.

Good buffet and great price! 

I have been coming to this buffet ever since I was a little kid. It's always a good choice and the prices are very reasonable compared to most buffets on the strip. If you have a players card, which you can sign up for free, you get a couple dollars discount. For breakfast it came up to $8 per person. Very reasonable!!

This buffet may not have the elaborate items buffets in the strip have, but for $8 and for breakfast, it gets the job done! They have your basics; eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, ham, omelette station, fruits and other things. But what I really like about this buffet is that it has Portuguese sausage, corned beef hash(from the can, yum!) and rice. Yum!! They have lots of seating and the dining area is very nice. Kind of has that old school charm to it. 

If you are on a tight budget and in the downtown area, this is great place to have a buffet. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it has never disappointed!",8lzAZ5hLQWuOAHBd8bGQSg,7,5,4,AK00P1HRGOUuRGjZrus-0g

I admit to at first I was a bit biased because the outside looked a bit shabby and rundown and due to the fact it was located in Downtown, Las Vegas (no offense). I wasn't really expecting much, but after I walked in and through the casino I find myself standing in a really beautiful buffet. At first I didn't believe my eyes because it was $10.99 per person for brunch on weekends and $7.99 for weekday lunch! Oh did I mention that's INCLUDING refills on any and every drinks?! Now that's a bargain! (I really wish I can bold the last line, because I have never been to a buffet where the price you see includes drinks already. Maybe I am going to the wrong place or maybe I just didn't discover Yelp sooner. Who knows?)

No way something so cheap can have such great variety! But was I wrong! They have a little of everything: Chinese, Mexican, Italian, a salad bar, desserts (cheesecake yumm!), etc! For only $11 per person, it's more than you can ask for. The service great and everyone was so friendly! 
On a side note: I went around 1:30pm for Sunday brunch, so I didn't encounter the ""long lines"" or ""crowded dining area"" others yelpers have started. 

What kept me from giving a 5 star instead of a 4 because not everything was great. I found a few flaws in some of things I ate, but hey maybe for you, you would love it. All depends on personal preference. 

If you're on a budget and spending over the top already, want to save a little something for that extra cute tee or a nice pair of shorts to beat the heat, then choose Garden Court Buffet. I didn't really want to pay $60 for a piece of meat or anything really expensive. It was good food and bluntly put it, in the end they all come out the same. I wanted to find something good and for a decent price especially since I went a large amount of people so I was not prepared for the bill to come out over $200 per meal! 

Sure, it is not expensive food. Sure, it's in Downtown. Sure it's not all perfect food. Bottom line is, if you want to save money and still leave with a satisfied tummy, then I recommend Garden Court Buffet.

I love Asian food, and the Garden Court had Chinese and Japanese selections, all of which were fresh, flavorful, and uncharacteristically NOT overcooked (A sad reality for most buffet food). The miso soup was quite honestly one of the best I have ever tasted, and I consider myself a miso soup connoisseur. I went back for seconds! 

They have carving stations for turkey, ham, and beef, and the sides are delicious. The macaroni and cheese was especially excellent. Fried chicken was plump, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. You won't find any dried out nubs of rubber in that tray!

The desert selection for lunch was typical: pies, cakes, cupcakes, and cookies. But they did have some special little selections, like miniature cheesecakes which were tasty, but nothing I would scream about. 

Service was great and the restaurant was very clean and comfortable. 

It is inside the Main Street Station Casino, which has a... Railroad theme.... shocking, I know.  I thought the entire building and decor were beautiful, although the casino itself left a bit to be desired. But we enjoyed Garden Court so much that we happily went back for lunch a second time.

There was a carving station serving ham or turkey, salad bar, dessert area, as well as Italian, Mexican, Hawaiian/Asian, and American food selections.

They used to have sauced hot wings, but this time they only had fried wings so I was kind of disappointed about that and couldn't eat very many. The kalua pork and spicy tofu in Hawaiian/Asian section were pretty good too. Everything else is pretty standard buffet foods such as chicken, pizza, pastas, taco bar, etc.

I can recall the first days moved to Vegas over 20 years ago this was one of my favorite buffets. I have come back here and there usually when blessed to see visitors from 808. It was fairly consistent with the selection and quality of choices. Maybe it because the competition or all these upscale buffets on the strip that offer more took the life out of it. I feel like since my last trip nothing that stands out on ANY of the stations whether craving or the norm each station theme to particular ethic cuisine. I do like the fact they still have that local style food that not many buffets offer. The white rice action and kailua pig and cabbage. They use to have Zippy chili years ago but that long gone and oxtail soup never saw any of that when I came. The kailua pig and cabbage rather bland not that local style taste or loving in it. Some of the kailua pig was under cooked nothing worst then eating pink under cooked pork. Yikes. The salad bar the selections was not the same nothing really special but just plain normal condiments or cold salads that get at any grocery store in plastic container to go. The craving station just had ham out that night. The dessert station is BIG time out of date. Sure you have your many assorted pre cut pieces of cake, pie, and smaller ones. None of it looked attractive nor did they have display area that made them look eye appareling. The real problem is just old outdated Buffet one that not with current times. Not much of buffet person to begin with but actually would spend extra twenty dollars on strip Buffet.

2) The dinning room was clean and the seats were comfortable. The food stations were all stocked well which was a surprise considering we came in an hour before closing. The cooks were keeping the stations full until nearly closing time. 

3) The food was the biggest surprise. For the price and location (not near or on the strip) I expected average. I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful a lot of the food was. I tried many things so I won't go into too many details, but the bread pudding was really good.

Looking for something different I discovered my new addiction by mistake, it's brisket in miso soup with green onion FTW it's so freaking good. At the carving station I asked for a piece of brisket it already looked good. I grabbed a bowl to put au jus into, which is usually next to the carving station, but it was miso soup instead and since I didn't want to waste the miso soup I added green onion just as your suppose to and was going to finish it after the brisket. I ended up dunking pieces of brisket into the miso soup and loved it.  I went back for 2nds and 3rds. I've been back 2 more other times just looking for miso soup and brisket.  The last time they had brisket and hid the miso soup in another section. I found it and enjoyed just plates of it. Trust me forget the rest of the item and just do brisket and miso soup with green onion unless it's crab legs but even on those nights I might just do it only.

Overall I was pretty dissappointed =  I was raised in the south & when I think of Friday Night Seafood I'm thinking fried clams, fried scallops, fried fish, HUSHPUPPIES & fried shrimp. The ONLY fried items they had were overbreaded Fried Shrimp which were good after peeling most of the breading off.

For $21.99 after I used my B-Connected Card discount from $25 this is what they did have = Both Steamed & Iced medium sized snow crab legs, Small (50 count) steamed Peel-n-Eat Shrimp on ice, steamed Clams, Mussels. Broiled Salmon & Trout, very small oysters on the half shell, assorted california rolls & crab salad which was very mayonaised & not very good at all. The trout was very good. The salmon not so much, The steamed crab legs were better than the Iced ones which seemed to have retained ALOT of salt water. The shrimp was ok and easy enough to peel but were very small.

In addition to this they had the regular stations that they have for lunch = Mexican, BBQ Ribs, Fried Chicken, Italian, Chinese & Hawaiian as well as fruit & salad bar and the awesome desert island.

If you like the above mentioned Seafood items then have at it. For me I thought I could have gotten a better deal- price & food wise - by going to Buffet @ Asia for dinner as they have a better sushi selection, crab legs & big decent peel-n-eat shrimp.

I wont be doing the Seafood Buffet again and when I do go back it will be for Lunch which is the best value for the price & food offered and they have FRIED CLAMS for lunch",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,2,0,2,v-nIzVfkHu7uyLNyBssRAg

The service was awesome. I never had to even look for her to refill my drinks and she wasn't just refilling them, she was bringing out clean cups filled with new ice. She cleared our plates all the while maintaining that level of service for her entire area (our party size was 19). 

As for the food, it wasn't bad. I didn't eat much however, everything I did have wasn't too bland, too tough or made me sick.

To start with, their salad mix is little more than head lettuce with a bit of shredded carrot. The rest of the salad selection is ok, but everything is in a very vinegary base. Even the bread was still in the plastic bag in the bread bin, more than a bit tacky.

Apparently Saturday lunchtime is really brunch, we didn't realize that today. That means that over a third if the buffet is breakfast and not very exciting breakfast at that. 

The rest of the hot food isn't bad, but it isn't all that great either (or all that hot). The fried chicken was dry, something of a challenge with a chicken thigh.  We were in after the lunch rush and I got the feeling that most of the food had been sitting for a while.

On additional surprise was the food labeling. Quite a bit of it isn't labeled at all. The ones that are labeled just have the name written in grease pencil on the glass of the sneeze guard.

Add to the above poor service from a bored server and there aren't a lot of things that make me want to come back. Even the Hawaiian section that always made me want to come here was less that exciting today.",aBcv3vraCvaUB6nZtMrNaw,2,0,2,aIppEMCwiTWcS86yOqqFKQ

Happy Thanksgiving Yelpers!!

Our family's very non-traditional Thanksgiving was spent stuffing our faces with turkey at Main Street Station's Garden Court Buffet (~$20).

This has to be one of my favorite buffets in downtown LV, probably because I've always liked the decor of this one better than the others in this downtown area. The food here isn't bad either; a good variety of American, Mexican, and Asian options. And on this Thanksgiving Day, the turkey, prime rib & ham were pretty delish for a buffet.

There is also a salad bar & a dessert bar here--soft serve too!! My only complaint about this place...the staff was VERY unfriendly. Maybe it was because they had to work on Thanksgiving, but 1) prime rib/ham cutting guy was so rude & 2) the dessert lady was so grouchy about refilling the soft serve cones, which they ran out of.

(Dinner) winners of the night were def the festive foods but also ""the works"" nachos that our family devoured that night! Yes, to guacamole & processed cheese--YUM!

Sorry, no reservations here; it's first come, first serve! But make sure to bring your Player's Card for a discount on the per person fee!

2639433,2010-09-19,4,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"Ah how time flies.. shockingly it's been over a year since I wrote a review. I  was surprisingly happy to a new discovery on buffets... a downtown buffet. A first for me. Being a Native in Vegas, I'm skeptical on how good the quality and taste of the food is in downtown, but no need to worry when you have yelpers to help you decide if it's something worth checking out. So after reading a few reviews giving it 4 stars... my daring date and I gave it a try. Here's the conclusion:

Impressed... very very impressed. Being a busy weekend and all... the line wasn't forever long to where we had to wait for eternity to eat. A few minutes later and we were already in front. And luckily we came on Prime Rib Night YESSS Siiiir. Every Saturday!! I haven't ate that for awhile and was pleased that was on the menu. 

Our server.. I believe Gilbert? was very kind and had impeccable guest service. Our drinks were refilled when needed, always checked up on us to see if we needed anything, asked if we needed any sauces for our entrees, if we needed coffee for dessert. I mean he was on point and I absolutely love service like that. For service, I give him 5 bright stars! *sparkle sparkle...

We first went to the salad bar... I was doubting that area since the lettuce didn't look crisp or fresh... BUT let me reassure you.. anything at this buffet don't judge it by the way it looks... because you might miss the very thing that was actually Delicious. Everything... at the salad bar section was unbelievably GOOD. Usually at buffets, the salad bars are average, not much taste to tickle your fancy.. but low and behold their crab salad, pasta salad, and even the antipasto salad ( my fav. ) tasted Fresh, Light, and quite Flavorful, but not overwhelming. Even the low-fat Italian dressing had flavor that bounced off your tongue. My last impression was... Refreshing!!

Main courses.. I started out in the Soul Food section, because I was eyeing the baked yams that you actually peel the skin from instead of the canned kind. So soothing, tasty, and warm! Loved the Collard Greens.. perfect in taste, Fried Chicken was juicy and the skin.. I know it's not good for you, but just to let you know... it was crispy and seasoned well. I mostly eat the skin, because anything crispy is the most delicious part to me. Sadly, the cornbread which I am a huge fan of was dry and crumbled from biting into it. Darn... but that's alright. There's more great selection to choose from.

Round 2: A slice of heaven... My favorite: Prime Rib :) They had all the condiments that goes with it: horseradish ( the hot textured and mild milky kind), dipping sauce, cranberry sauce to cool off the heat. It was scrumptious, tender, and juicy. Even my date's slice looked dry, but he told me it was moist and perfect. We both rave about their mashed potatoes... real potato mashed not the instant powdered kind. It tasted like homemade cooking... it wasn't too rich or creamy.. it just left a flavor of wanting more. It was so good that even after trying to attempt to have a bite of everything... I wanted to end it with having seconds. My mind was constantly reminding me... ""hey hey now remember to make room for Prime Rib again!!!"" Just that made my night.

Round 3: Asian Section... my mum told me later that night that they have raw oysters in a small cup covered with sauce right by the sushi section. I must have missed it... Darn again. That's the first on my list when I go back there... she told me not many ppl know it's there.. yea like ME!?! Ugh. Well don't get discouraged by the looks of the Oxtail Stew, it was a soup for the soul. Very comforting and delicious... the oxtail meat was soft and almost like they cooked it for hours on end. Like I said before.. it may look unappealing, but the taste sure makes up for it. Fried Rice was moist and fluffy... Chow mein was like eating dry, ramen noodles not so good, but the cabbage cooked in there was tasty. Orange Chicken was too zesty for my taste buds and was over cooked. I did pick the small nuggets versus the chunkier portions since I like one bite wonders... but it was tough like a rock. They have a cucumber salad in the sushi section...very refreshing and tangy...loved it. 

I skipped Italian and Mexican food..only because I was getting overly full that I couldn't taste anything anymore even when I wanted to. I wanted to try the fresh pineapples and watermelon... desserts... But no room in my tummy. I did have one slice of sausage  :) It was decent and good. I have to say there were a lot more selections I wanted to try, but didn't want to push myself to where I'll be hurting later... I was at a point where I could barely breathe. Yeah.. that's how I get down and clean plate. My date quit after Round 2!!! But at least he tasted the dessert... cheesecake he said tasted old, but the rice pudding was good. Also he enjoyed the Tofu soup and Hot Chicken Wings ( literally spicy hot, but yummy).

2655797,2015-12-16,9,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"My family from Hawaii showed up in Vegas after Thanksgiving and invited us out for a little brunch as it's easily been.. for me at least.. 10+ years since I've seen these jolly Islanders. 

My Aunt had comps.. because they've been staying between Main St. Station & California Hotel for years. What was supposed to be a $130 buffet bill dwindled down to $11.50. Of course, being the high roller I am, took the bill proudly from here. I stuck out my chest, grabbed a crisp $10 bill and 2 singles.. then confidently instructed our hostess to, ""Keep the change.""

I grabbed my plate and aggressively searched for breakfast. Found breakfast and a lot of what was put forth before the buffet folks was a sore eyed sight.. Not a sight for sore eyes. 

The scrambled eggs were submerged in water. The chef's behind the counter'll  have fresh eggs back there and  toss out sunny sides, over easy's and mediums if you'd like. Which I do (over-easy) and they did a fine job with that.

The 'French' toast looked like it showed up from yesterday looking for some 'fresh' toast. Country fried steaks were soggy and obviously sat under that heat lamp hours prior to our arrival. 

The Bacon.. Well, the bacon looked pretty damn amazing. I must've arrived right when those batches of sweet pork came out of the oven.. cause good Lord they were crispier than my easy-iron dress shirts.. after an ironing, of course. I dedicated, as usual, an entire plate to the 3 types of bacon we had in front of us - apple wood smoked, maple and the generic thick-cut slices. Yes. YES. YAAASS!

The pancakes were good. They didn't seem old.. and were a pleasant golden brown texture and equipped with enough 'fluff' in their flapjacks to safely eat. Nice selection of syrups over here as well. 

The biscuits and gravy were up to par with average restaurants elsewhere. This buffet section was a little rough, as you had to selectively distinct the 'newer' biscuits from the old n' soggy. I was able to identify these due to the light steam and heat felt around the biscuit. Grab those, not the biscuits barely visible above the gravy line sight.

Friendly service.. though.. I don't believe I was offered a refill once, yet, a plate was removed from my immediate reach once they assumed I was done without question.. it was quicker than a runner on first trying to steal second. That's baseball, in case you were wondering.

I'd probably be back for breakfast because most the food wasn't TOO bad, had a fair price tag and it wasn't too crowded. Not the best buffet by any means.. but they're really clean here with plenty of room for larger parties and a pleasant ambiance.

I thought the same until I tried it and was pleasantly

They have a relatively large selection for a extremely
low price.


I have eaten here several times and the food is
reasonably good, from their fried chicken, to their 
Asian section, to their carving station and much more.

 This is a good buffet that is not gourmet but very
tasty and price wise one of the best buffets in Vegas
in the budget range, if you want reasonably good food  
for the lowest price in Vegas then this is definitely the
place to go, and if you want Gourmet food  then I would

When you go to Vegas, a lot of people would go to the main strip. But little do they know, the old downtown (North Side), has great things, too.

The Garden Court Buffet may not have 5 Star head Chefs, but the food there is good for the price you pay. I've been to several other buffets on the strip - Harrah's, Mirage, and Wynn. Honestly, the interior and atmosphere are excellent, but the food sucked compared to the Garden Court Buffet. All buffets serve practically the same thing but the food still have to be good and the price must be attractice. At Garden Court, you won't be disappointmented.

+Food Choices
+Spacious seating - perfect for individuals, small groups, or a large group

The quality is the best by far and the value is there, too. $9.75 all you can eat lunch with a carving station? Nice! Breakfast is a bit less, dinner a bit more. All are worth the price of admission.

The Garden Court Buffet is not one of the new fangled high-end buffets that have taken over resorts on the Strip. Rather, it offers a huge variety of decent to above-average food for a very fair price.

The buffet service line is probably a good 300 feet long, starting with Hawaiian cuisine, followed by Asian, Mexican, fried goodies, a carving station, roasted chicken, veggies, American, Italian, pizza, and a salad bar. Then, there's an enormous dessert island with  similarly vast options.

The carving station routinely has tasty meats of very good quality. It was brisket and turkey for lunch today and both were moist and delicious. During breakfast hours, the carving station is used to create custom omelets. The guy who juggles the eggs in pans over six burners has been doing it since I was teenager and I came with Mom & Dad. So, 10 years maybe? He's pretty incredible.

Pros:
* Reasonably priced ($7.99 weekday lunch w/ a BConnected Players card)
* Variety of food (from Italian to Hawaiian cuisine)
* Layout (Lots of spacious seating, it doesn't feel crowded)
* Attentive service (drinks were kept filled and plates were removed quickly)
* Unique atmosphere (reminds me of a train station).

Cons:
* Food is not incredible... I'd say it's just average.  Don't expect anything fancy.

Overall:
This place is a decent place to go, especially when you cannot make up your mind about a place to eat and having a variety is desired.  Nothing spectacular about this place, but at $7.99 per person for lunch, you can't go wrong!

Tips:
 *  Try the brisket.  It's soft and flavorful.
 *  Park at the lot right in front of Main St.  It costs $3, but you get it back if you bring your receipt to the cashier cage.  When you enter the lot, make an immediate left (heading west) and park in the far corner, closest to the Main St. Casino.  There is an opening in the corner that takes you right up to the crosswalk.  I find it to be the easiet parking!

-nice room; I happen to like Main Street Station and think its one of the nicer properties downtown, even if it is a bit dated
-service was fairly good and our drinks never reached the bottom of their glasses

Negatives
-somewhat limited selection; typical buffet fare such as pizza, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, etc

First off, its Downtown inside the Main Street Station, that right there, should tell you, ""don't expect much from it"". Main Street Station itself is small enough as is. But the Garden Court Buffet, is very roomy. Located in the middle of Main Street Station, the view of the place looks elegant. Its nicely built, and has its own spin to it. The pricing is cheap, but of course with a cheap price, you tend to get less then average. 

The staff seems to be nice and courteous which is always a plus. Even our waitress seems to be nice as well. But , we did go early in the morning, when it probably just opened. But I bet you, if you go in the middle of their shift, their cheeks are probably sore from all that smiling, and they're probably anxious to go home. 

Considering that this is a Buffet, most likely, the food is probably overcooked and been sitting out there for quite sometime. So with that in mind, it tends to be a bit to hard to chew or too chewy to chew. But I did like the fact that they still had a wide variety of food, and an omelet station, with an entertaining omelet chef. I for one, did enjoy what I ate, even though, some of the food was a bit overcooked. I was that hungry to eat it anyways. 

After two rounds, we decided to call it a day. Wasn't happy, that the dessert station wasn't even open. Other buffet's had dessert station for breakfast. But oh well, what do you expect from a cheap buffet?

The first rule of food prep safety is to keep the cold items very cold and the hot items very hot. Anything in between becomes a breeding ground for bacteria growth. Multiple items that we tried were lukewarm. I asked for a refund. The manager wouldn't take my word for it and went to check with the kitchen. Eventually he admitted that some of the items I complained about were below 140° (apparently that's the magic number). He offered a partial refund.

Then went back for the Sunday breakfast and was pleasantly surprised in the food and the service. Went back again for Sunday breakfast a month ago and the food quality was down but thought what the heck....give it another chance. So went for Sunday breakfast on Mothers Day and what a  disappointment. The staff in the dining room could not have been nicer and that has never changed. They are all pleasant and nice and make sure your drinks are never empty and the plates are cleared off the table. BUT..........

The food quality was way down and the whole time we were there.....almost no staff behind the food stations and not one of them had a smile or nice comment for any of us. It was almost like they were having a fight with the dinning room staff and the staff behind the food stations did not want to be there.

There was almost no fresh fruit.....lots of canned stuff but who wants that for breakfast? The pizza/roll station was pretty much empty and not a staff member to be seen behind the station. There were two very hard cinnamon rolls left and I finally found a staff member behind the station and asked when they would be putting out more food. Her response was....oh probably in about 5 min !!!!!! They finally put some more out but when I walked up I saw her drizzling them with the sugar coating so thought hey FRESH rolls !!! Not !!! They had been baked at least the day before, were cold, over cooked, and then they place them under the heat lamp to make you think they are fresh. Yikes !!!!!

Tried the eggs Benedict next and if you only want to eat the egg and ham....they are ok.
Did you know you can hold an english muffin in the kitchen somehow so that even a knife will not cut through them? They werent just tough.....they were solid.

What can I say about the carving station. The brisket is the most dry and tough brisket I have ever had.....even botching it up at home. When I got there...there was just a little sliver of brisket left and no ham. Other people were coming up but the guy had walked away and wasnt serving anyone. Then when he came back...he pulled more brisket and ham out from under the station and started serving people again.

We are locals and have our choice of where to go. We will not be going back here again for several more years. If you have a choice try another buffet for breakfast....it cant be as bad as this one.",8_rJOKU13E_fE4FE1H5PpA,0,0,1,g1Qg7_yl5Gm1yqFor6Oeeg

$12.99/person for brunch on Saturday and Sunday. Truly unbeatable price in Las Vegas. The only thing is that it is located about 7-10 minutes off the Strip in Downtown Las Vegas. The buffet is inside the Main Street Hotel past the casino. To park, you can either attempt to park in the outdoor parking lot, or you can park in the parking garage for $3, which will be reimbursed as long as you dine at the hotel.  You pay the $3 upfront and after you dine, bring both the parking receipt and the dining receipt to the cash cage for your reimbursement.

Now onto the buffet review... First off, FREE CHAMPAGNE! That, itself, is a huge plus. On top of that, I was surprised with the amount of food the buffet offered. The buffet is known for their chicken  but they also offered serviced steak, shrimp dishes, and a variety of ethnic-themed foods. Since it's brunch, they had waffles, pancakes, bacon, eggs, variety of different potatoes, and a station where they cooked you eggs and omelettes to your preference. They also had a salad bar, Asian-food section (stir-fried shrimp, rice, dumplings), Mexican-food section (tacos, tortilla chips, enchiladas, etc), and a dessert section. Some dishes were amazing and others were a miss for me, but that's expected with a buffet.

I managed to get there in time for their dinner buffet. For only $14 each, myself and my foodie date got to enjoy quite the cuisine they had to offer. I had to start off immediately with a plate of spaghetti paired with a garlic bread slice and chicken wings. For beverages, I had their pink lemonade which was not too sweet but just right! For my second helping, I had their chicken taquitos, dirty rice and a taco I made out of ground beef. Very good in taste! Since I was trying to not get too stuffed, I had to opt for dessert, which to my surprise, they had one of my all time favorite desserts- key lime pie! Had to grab a slice!

Inside it is very roomy with a very lovely décor. It would kind of remind you of the décor that you would expect to find in a restaurant off the Strip. Since we arrived a few minutes early for dinner, there was already a long line. If you are a card member, your meal will run for less, maybe a dollar or two cheaper.

The Garden Court buffet is inside the Main Street Casino. This casino resonates and old school trains station vibe but with a touch class. 

The decor inside the buffet restaurant has high lit ceilings and greenery everywhere sending you back to train stations from the 1920's.

A helpful hint, before paying for your meal, sign up for a casino card known as ""B Connected"". It's free and quick to sign up for from the Customer service desk. There's a big price difference and the meal will be cheaper!

Brunch is on Saturday and Sunday with champagne included.

For my Hawaiians out there, Monday & Wednesday they feature Hawaiian offerings like Oxtail stew, Kalua pig, Manapua, and Portuguese sausage.

There's also an omelette bar, beef brisket, Mexican food, pizza, salad bar and a nice dessert bar!

Whew! Can you feel the food coma coming on?

The seating area is so vast that it's almost impossible to be to close to others leaving one with more elbow room.

The atmosphere is casual so come dine in casual attire and enjoy some good food. The waitstaff is friendly and I think this place will have something for anyone!

The dessert offering is particularly satisfactory, with cheesecakes, chocolate cakes, fruit pies, etc... They even offer no-sugar options which is a nice addition.

You can get free parking at this place with validation located seconds away and it is right next to the 15 and 515 freeways which makes it easy to get to.

The two things that stand out from everything else to me is the brisket and the hot wings. 

The brisket is hit or miss. When it's hit, it's melt in your mouth tender that'll make you want to rub it all over your body. When it's miss, it's dry and very undesirable. It's like eating a piece of bark. It is so worth it though when the brisket shows up with its' A game. Once in a while, they will serve roast beef instead. I can't say that I am a fan.

The hot wings are nothing to write home about. Because I'm a creature of habit, I always have to get me at least four of these things whenever I'm feeding here. They're not even very spicy. They're just good and consistent. 

They have a little Hawaiian section located towards the back.  White rice and kalua pork is always there. Not the best kalua, but it's kalua. Sometimes I'll see Filipino dishes chillen in the cut. Not a bad selection.

On our first visit, we went for dinner following an amazing day at the Mob Museum right down the street from Main Street.

Lucky us, valet is free, other than tip, so there seems to be a theme here.

Unlike the hotels on the strip, the casino floor at Main Street is small, so getting from the Valet to the buffet was really easy.  

We waited in line no more than 10-minutes.

Now the buffet at Main Street is normally $11.99, so I would expect that the fancy fair that you would expect from the strip is non-existent.  However, if it is comfort food you're looking for, this maybe the place for you.

Waaaay in the back corner of the buffet, you'll find some Hawaiian dish like kalua pork and cabbage. On our first Sunday chicken long rice was available, manapua or pork bun (Asian influence from the sugar cane and pineapple plantation days in Hawaii). Mac salad and Korean-style cucumber salad. During today's visit, pretty much the same thing except no chicken long rice and instead, pork guisantes (peas). 

Next to the Hawaiian food station was the Asian station with chow mein, lemon chicken (reminding me of lemon scented 409), beef broccoli or broccoli and mushroom, fried vegetable egg rolls, fried rice and miso soup. So pretty much the typical items you would see at any buffet.

Next to the Asian station was the taco bar. And next to the taco bar was the southern fair like fried chicken, mashed potatoes, prime rib, ham, collard greens, corn. 

On the other side was the pizzas and salads. And then a whole separate station of desserts.

This morning for brunch, I totally missed the breakfast bar which replaced the pizza bar.

So food, was A OK, nothing bad but also nothing totally outstanding. In other words, if my husband an I receive the free buffets, we would come back.

As for service, last Sunday was just better than today's service and it might be because it was far busier this last visit because of the big event that occurred in Vegas the night before.

I do have to say that the restaurant appears to be very clean, especially in the buffet area, which is a huge plus.

To say that I was unimpressed with the quality and choices is an understatement. I guess what I was expecting was an affordable full-on breakfast buffet, not a meager selection of breakfast items, some being mediocre in quality and flavor.

One side of the buffet is open while the dessert and back sections are closed off, so everything is located at the front of the buffet. The basic breakfast items were all there, like bacon, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, Belgian waffles, and sausages. 

Some of the offerings were simply, not good. The Portuguese sausage was greasy and flavorless, and that ""omelet"" -- no idea what compelled me to put that on my plate -- was obviously artificial and straight out of the package. Speaking of omelets, the omelet station is the highlight of the breakfast buffet. The cook -- I think his name is Manny -- is such a cheerful man. He's obviously a morning person and seems like he enjoys his job. Plus, his omelets aren't bad, and you know he uses real eggs cause he cracks them right in front of you. Aside from the real omelet I had, I did like the beefy and spicy breakfast burrito with jalapeño slices. Of course, the bacon was good, but needed a good pat down on a napkin to absorb the excess grease. 

Breakfast is obviously not the strong point of this buffet. For under $10, you could probably find something better in the area to kick-start your day. However, I still recommend trying their lunch buffet. I just hope it doesn't end up being like the quality of their breakfast.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,4,3,r2y0nNMXx0wf3UkiNH0uzw

The clams are obviously frozen and recooked, had sand in them and tasted bitter. must have been spoiled. The crab legs were small and tasteless. Shrimps were the same way.  

I used to like their roast beef here.  This time the brisket was over cooked or recooked, way overdone with no taste of flavor left in the meat.   The pastas and sauces were uninspiring.

To order a  $4.75 beer, had to give the waitress so she can go to the bar and get it.  It took close to 20 minuted before she came back, at which time I had eaten over 80% of the meal.

Clean and decent atmosphere, good service, very affordable. Food is very standard for buffets. Which is better than the other three buffets I have dined at, downtown.

My wife and I went on a Friday morning, it was her idea. We started off by going in different directions as we approached the buffet itself. Suddenly I had to stop before getting any food. I walked over to my wife and thanked her for choosing this place. She asked why? Two words: Beef Brisket. One of my favorites.

1st disappointment was, no Kalua Pork & Cabbage.
2nd disappointment was pizza was not fresh. I guess if they are little slow, food stays there?
3rd disappointment was Enchiladas was dried up & stuck to pan. See photo.
A good buffet would monitor food, and at least keep food looking fresh. There were enough chefs standing around.

I kinda waited to see if they would add new food.

They did add new Oxtail Stew which was a plus.

Finally before I left, the chef monitoring the Mexican food took the dried up enchiladas to a back table. 
I thought he was going to trash the old food but he struggled, scraped off the dried up stuck enchiladas and put them into a new clean pan. Then put them back on steam table for serving.
Can you believe he had the nerve to serve that old food & didn't even freshen it up with more enchilada sauce? 
See 2nd photo of scraped enchiladas in new pan.

They had ample crab legs, oysters, clams, et al. I indulged in quite a few, of all of the above! Also macked out on some prime rib (medium rare and moist) and other entree items. The sausages at the prime rib grill were quite tasty too! I don't waste the valuable 'real estate' in my gut on most veggies, potatoes, Mexican foods, pastas (aka noodles), or pizza / breads.

Our 'waiter', if there is such a thing at a buffet, cleared our tables of the used plates in a timely fashion, as well as filled our drinks. 

If there is any complaint about the food it would probably be directed at the desserts. Nothing exceptional there, but then again I usually don't leave much 'real estate' for such items.

I read a review from a guy who stated he has been going here for the past 15 years and gave a crappy rating because they had not changed up the menu much since he first started patronizing the place. No complaint about the foods quality, quantity, etc. Yet, he keeps going back... Really? Really? WTF?",14D8NcXo_rgdkaO8WAgemA,0,1,3,M4LipbizrNOa0N8Aii1iPg

Being a petite person with a smallish appetite, I still went up three times just for crab legs.   They were warm, easy to open and tasty with the drawn butter!  I did try a couple of other items which didn't really leave an impression on me because crab legs is like crack to me.  

Oh, since I enjoy clams I got a few of them as well.  Yuck!  They tasted like lemon, gross. 

I did manage to go for some dessert...only the soft serve swirl with hot fudge and nuts.  Yum!

I dislike buffets and what I dislike more is paying for parking to dine at the establishment. Many of the casinos now require parking in their garage at the Strip or parking lot at the Fremont Street Experience so in order to get free parking we needed to dine in one of the casino restaurants to get our parking ticket validated. This buffet is located inside the Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel at the Fremont Street Experience. Actually, this buffet wasn't too bad. We arrived almost closing time at 9:45p but the buffet is open for another 30 minutes after they closed at 10:00p. 

Saturday was Prime Rib & Scampi Special. I'm not certain and can't remember how much we paid. The prime rib from the carving station was tender, tasty and delicious. The food was your typical buffet menu but this one had Hawaiian fare including pork k?lua plus more at the very end and I saw it only after I got full from my first serving. I also had menudo. Yum! All the food I had was fresh and well heated. Dinner and parking validation... we'll take it!

The dining area is in an airy room with Victorian decor. Our server was nice and friendly and always readily refilling our drinks and clearing our used plates from our table. There were not that many diners at this hour nearing closing time so she was attentive to our table. I'm still not fond of buffets but this experience at the Fremont Street Experience was alright. A gem in downtown Vegas. With our validated parking we walked to Fremont Street Experience right after for some music entertainment from the live cover bands...

SERVICE
All they do is take plates away from table. Some are friendly and others won't say a single word but I don't really mind. If anything, they need to work on improving their food quality.  

FOOD
I try to come here for their special days like the seafood day (every Friday) and prime rib/scampi day (every Saturday) because it seems more worthy. Line is usually anywhere from 20min to 1hr long on these days. NOT WORTH THE WAIT. 

They have different sections. Salad bar, Italian food, Chinese food, Mexican food, questionable food, etc. Nothing looks appealing as it all seems like it's been sitting under the heat lamp for half of the day. Food served here is usually really salty. I came here multiple times in the past few years and have not liked a single thing I had from their heat lamp paradise section.

They also have a section dedicated to desserts. From unhealthy sugar bomb cakes to sugar free options. I like to get their ice milk dessert. It's almost like an ice cream but more milk based. I always get their chocolate ice milk dessert with chocolate chip sprinkles and that usually makes up for the nasty food.

CONCLUSION
Go for the salads and ice milk dessert. If you have comps, go to Triple 7 Brewery next door or Market Street Cafe inside California hotel. Trust me you don't want to waste your comps here.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,9,5,2,K4OgjKEHOG81wSMVwLRs_g

Garden Court Buffet is located in the Main Street Station Casino in Downtown LV.  I'll go with many Yelpers here and say that this is probably the best Downtown has to offer so far as to buffets.  Case in point:  Hawaiian food offerings!

I'll start off with what I like the best.  Being from Hawaii, I often miss simple Hawaiian dishes.  Would it kill buffets out here to cook white Calrose rice properly??  None of this Uncle Ben's long grain, rice pilaf junk.  Sticky...white...rice!  Buffets out there would make a killing if you just made white rice, sautéed SPAM, scrambled eggs, and laid out a big bottle of furikake.  Feed dozens of people with little off your bottom line!

Garden Court Buffet has a little corner section on the far side of the buffet that hides these Hawaiian goodies.  It's basic in terms of Hawaiian cuisine, not always made the way locals would make it, but at the very least it's there.  On many days at the buffet you'll see:

-Sticky white rice
-Kalua pig and cabbage
-Oxtail stew (mainly at dinner but YES!)

As soon as I pay, I'm off to that little corner of treasured eats!  On the days I'm lucky I get treated with oxtail stew.  OMG...OMG!  One of my favorite comfort eats of all time!  You see me, and I'm sucking on the cartilage of a divine oxtail?  Leave me alone!  I will give you my autograph at some other time.  It's not the best oxtail stew I've ever had (that would go to ME) but dang is the one at Garden Court Buffet delicious.  Big, pretty meaty pieces of beef oxtail that has been simmering for hours in a stew mixture of carrots, celery, potatoes, tomato sauce, and other spices.  It has to be HOURS in order to make the meat of the oxtail fall off the bone tender.  A chewy oxtail is not a happy oxtail!  I'll be honest, the last time I made oxtail stew it took me a total of TWO (yep..TWO) days to finish the dish.  My guess is the oxtail stew over at the buffet is made with the help of a pressure cooker, which will drastically cut down on cooking time (but still deliver tender meat).  I will set there the entire time at the buffet with multiple plates of white rice, drenched with their oxtail stew.  By the end, my mouth and fingers will be sticky from the beefy tendon juices.  Oh, the horror!  The succulent, gelatinous horror!

Yes I just wasted an entire paragraph on oxtail stew.  But no other buffet in Las Vegas has it right now.  Garden Court Buffet does have other sections of course for gluttony:

-Asian
-Mexican
-Italian
-American
-Salad Bar (very meh)
-Dessert

They also do have theme nights like all-you-can-eat prime rib, or seafood, but I really only pay attention to these areas when there is no oxtail stew.  And when there is no oxtail stew I'm a grumpy boy!  Really, because majority of their other food is just OK.  Not bad, but nothing to write to Bon Appetit about.  It is average to what you find in your local Station Casinos buffet.  

I was so into the oxtail that I totally forgot to take a picture of anything for this review.  Sorry!  Maybe next time after I wipe the drool off my chin.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,2,3,-OYcWOIMmEWqDX1B11dNvQ

4025663,2010-09-11,7,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"Main Street Station, tucked away behind the Cal (California Casino) and right next to the Plaza, is one of the nicer casinos on or near Fremont Street in Downtown..  What I usually do is park my car at the Cal, get a good 4 hr validation and walk over to Main Street for the buffet via the skywalk to save time, money, and avoid the heat by walking outside...  Main Street has a parking lot but it's outdoors, so I prefer Cal's option much better...

So...when I was younger I remember going to Circus Circus to have their super cheap buffet!  (for those of you near Vegas I'm sure you've been there and done that too!  Circus Circus was the bomb when we were kids and thought the buffet was great until we grew up and out of it)  Well, Main Street offers a buffet that has the price of Circus Circus, but the food is actually comparable to those on the strip.  Granted it's no Bellagio but food is probably as good as I say Harrah's, Monte Carlo, etc... so it's definitely no slouch when it comes to the quality.  Went during the weekend for Sunday Brunch and it cost us $10.99 with free flowing mimosa if requested!

So what makes this place that good?  

First, the decor...  For a downtown casino it's got a grand feel to the buffet as it has a really nice european setting...  A few statues here, 30 ft high ceiling with stained glasses and windows, I believe there may also be a fountain inside the buffet, etc... real nice touch!

The buffet layout was very nice as well.. wide open, lots of seating, easy buffet lines to get your food as the line goes from right to left starting with salads and ends with desserts.

Variety was also terrific as they had everything from salads, pizza, soup, 3 varieties of eggs, country fried steak, roast chicken, steam corn, omelette station, bbq ribs, enchiladas, nachos, orange chicken, bbq pork buns, lau lau pork, etc.... a wide variety which I couldn't name them all but selection is awesome for it's price....


Here are the notables..... prime rib brisket was off the hook!  Meat looked dry yet when it gets into your mouth it literally falls apart... Roast chicken was moist like it just took a shower without much oil (which should be the case), lau lau pork has a terrific smokey flavor which I have not had in other Hawaiian places making it a very nice treat, and some chicken wing dishes (Asian) had the most juiciest chicken wings available!  Just overall a awesome meal when you are not thinking of paying $20+ on the strip as this is a great alternative.  

They even have ice cream cones you can self serve and the vanilla ice cream was tasty yet not overly sweet.  A great end to a nice meal!

Service provided were pretty superb as well.  Our drinks were consistently topped and plates were removed promptly so there were no complaints here.  So guarantee worth your $14 with tip!

One fun side note.. after eating do make sure you visit the restroom at this place...(I'm thinking of washing your hands after the meal what were you thinking???)  But for the guys restroom do take a look at a piece of Berlin wall that is used to hold up the urinals.  It's sort of all to see a piece of history while you do your business....

Come on Saturdays and Sundays for the champagne brunch and it'll totally blow your mind. (Make sure to tip your waiter/waitress well - you're saving a ton of cash by coming here.)

The atmosphere here is positively charming - I'd say it's one of the prettier buffet rooms in all of Las Vegas, including the Strip. The casino has a ""old-time railroad station"" theme which continues into the buffet room. It's a pleasant place to pass a few hours eating and drinking.

The food isn't exceptional, but there's a good range of different cuisines, including Hawaiian food - a nice touch. The breakfast food is pretty standard, but you can also load up a plate with half breakfast and half Asian food, if that's your preference. Desserts are pretty decent - I like to take a piece of pie and glob some soft-serve ice cream on top.

But the real value here is the champagne brunch. I believe they recently raised the price to $10.99, but even then, it's a steal.

The bro and I were devastated that Island Specialties at the Plaza was closed... we were so looking forward to some cheap sushi rolls. Do a Yelp search for ""sushi"" near Downtown LV and you'll find very little to work with :( We stumbled our hungry way over to Main Street, checked out the GC Buffet and saw that not only did they have crab legs both hot and cold, but oysters! We are SO IN.

No wait at all, quick drinks (and refills), and food was consistently coming out hot and fresh. We were most impressed with the chicken wings, shrimp cocktail, crab legs and oysters (natch), collard greens, right-out-of-the-oven pizza, seafood gumbo, and beef brisket.

We have been coming here to Main St for over 20 years. I remember 21 years ago peeking in the window before they finished the huge remodel.
They used to have the Friday seafood buffet with fresh seafood, including jumbo clams that were awesome!
To tell you the truth, that's why we came here!
Now they have these tiny, sand filled, sad little things that seem too small to leave their mothers!
Sadly, we will not be back next year or anytime.",hcHu6CVr5Swx3_CeOPTqsg,2,0,3,Fn8KDhPWSowtkTes81lh1g

4226752,2010-05-02,1,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"Let's make things nice and sparkling clear okay?   I am not putting this on a grading curve.  I'm not comparing this buffet to any on the strip.  I'm basing this on my sole experience with MSS's buffet.

This buffet is average.  The food is fresh and edible.  The service is meh.  The selection is alright.

Pro's: 
-Price.  I had lunch for $7.99.  If you want buffets on the strip you'll be paying double that.  Breakfast price and special dinner buffet prices are low too.

-Location.  Main Street Station is one of the few casinos downtown with well marked signs.  Finding the buffet isn't difficult, neither is the interior set-up.  The place is actually well designed.

-Food selection.  I will say, not much here caught my eye.  Even though I'm not comparing this buffet to the strip ones.......I'll use an example.  The selection isn't Bellagio or Wynn like.  Then again, it's not Luxor/Excalibur/Circus Circus/Imperial Palace like either.  They had a good selection of stuff to eat, not much that I desired though.

-Deserts.  I have to say, the deserts were pretty good.  I think I've had a fair amount of buffets and can say that they are the highlight of the buffet in my opinion.

Cons:
-Service.  The waiter/bus boy I had was nice, but he was easily distracted.  Think of a 10 year old with ADD.  ""Why, yes sir I'll get you that diet coke............HEY LOOK A SQUIRREL!""  Nice guy, but not too focused on his job.  He only had a few tables so maybe he was just bored.  I'd be bored doing his job too though.

-Beet Salad.  I am not Dwight Schrute.  I don't see how anyone would eat this.  After being there for 45 mins and walking by again and seeing it still untouched......the others in the buffet agreed with me it seems.

-Pizza.  I usually can tell how a buffet is going to be by their pizza.  Yes, it sounds insane......but it's true.  The pizza here is average.  That's not a good thing.  If they improved the basics, they'd be able to get better results.  

Overall:
Not too much to complain about.  I'll be staying here over the 4th of July weekend and I'll be gracing this buffet again.  The food isn't going to be superb.......but we only need food for energy and such so I can't complain too much.  At least it's not Imperial Palace!",NSS0m8Qz6-XCTK8RCI6RKA,0,0,3,pHENESk8cdcYLZyhjDtm-g
4226803,2018-05-17,5,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"Many have not had tried oxtails.  Think braised short ribs, but with even more flavor.  What use to be an inexpensive cut of beef, it is now pricey especially when you consider the meat to bone ratio. Since it is a tougher cut of meat, it requires braising and slow cooking so the meat easily pulls away from the bone.

I heard about oxtail stew being served at the Garden Court buffet at the Main Street Station Casino on Mondays and Wednesdays.  So, on a recent trip to Vegas, five of us had made our Wednesday night dinner here. Arriving at 6pm, the line to pay was relatively short and we were seated by a table next to the buffet stations.  The Garden Court is a large setup with an expansive dining area with a diner style atmosphere.  Our server took our drink orders and we headed to stations and I was in search of the oxtails.

The buffet consists of American, Mexican, Italian, and Asian/Hawaiian dishes.  Main Street, along with the California Hotel and Fremont Hotel cater to the Islanders, hence the Hawaiian dishes. After walking around and checking out the offerings, my mission was oxtails.  The oxtail stew was at the left end of the station with the Hawaiian offerings. 

The oxtails were the popular offering in this section.  With some steamed rice to soak up the gravy, I heaped on several large pieces of oxtails on my plate and headed back to our table. The stew was made with a tomato based sauce and was tasty. The oxtails were perfectly prepared as the meat easily came off the bone.  Delicious! The others in my party agreed.  It was so good that I went back for more. 

As to the other offerings, I had tastes of the BBQ ribs, grilled fish, and chicken.  They were good factoring the value and price point of this buffet. The dessert station had many standard selections, but nothing outstanding.

For me the star of the buffet is the oxtail stew. It is my quintessential comfort food. If you haven't tried it, give it try.  I will be back on my next Vegas trip for oxtail night.

P.S. sign up for a free B Connected Player's card at Guest Services and it gets you $1 off the buffet price for everyone in your party.",8qpFUPR1wd3uz8N1QaWj_A,9,8,4,gyuQHEMmHvKsRXGbmnJcpQ

4287749,2015-05-21,3,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"As far as buffets go, I like to weigh them on value and price as opposed to how fancy it is and where it is. I am a little (as in a sweet heart) gourmand, but I'm easy also. I don't need fancy plating, or wateralls. I want quality and value over anything, especially when you have a child it's basically a must!

Here there is a variety of specialty nights as well as brunch. I have went to brunch, lunch, and dinner here and all were pretty decent. Brunch is probably my favorite of it all, it's not my favorite brunch place, but for the price it's pretty good. The winner here for brunch is the French toast! It's large and fluffy and you can top it with strawberries or use syrup. It's also quite delectable sans toppings! The omelet station here is hit or miss and the prime rib is not delicious! I'm used to the rare prime rib and getting it grilled a little... not here. It's cooked medium well, which I am not used to with prime rib! Any who, the other offerings are your standard brunch fare: eggs, toast, pancakes, meats, and hash browns as well as fruit station and salad station. 

The lunch / dinner here is ok as well, you have your Asian station with orange chicken, Kalua pork, mushroom green beans, and white rice. Sometimes they include a delicious mac salad! You have your Mexican station; the winner here is the carnitas! They are peppered perfectly and oh so tender! The taquitos are a def hit or miss. Either they are cooked too long or they are perfect, it's been the latter recently. You will also have your standard American foods, friend chicken, turkey, prime rib, mashed potatoes, baked chicken, and broccoli . Also included is various fish, pizzas, salad bar and fruit area. The salad bar is meh, funny thing is they don't have cheddar cheese here, you have to get it from the Mexican area on the other side.

The one crummy thing here are the servers, sometimes. We just came here and our server came to check on us maybe 4 times but was extremely attentive to others around us. This isn't the first time it's happened either. But, I get it, they may think they'll get a larger tip from a family of 6-8 over my son and I. I wished I could say that's true, but it my case it isn't. I typically get comps here so I don't even pay for my meal, I have no problem dropping a $15 tip or more if you treat us well, and at least refill our tea a few times. When I have to sit there for 20 minutes while you schmooze the family of 6, I start subtracting from the tip. It may seem petty, but, I am also a patron AND I even clean up after myself. When we leave the busser / server does not have to clean a mess of bile, his/her job is pretty much done.

This buffet is just ok. If I didn't get hella comps, I wouldn't probably come here but maybe one a month for brunch... if that. They don't offer pineapple juice, and do not have cherries.  They also do not offer cream, only the little non dairy creamer cups... which are not the business. I have to use like 8 in my cup!

Then i went on the other side and bamm, a line 10-15 people deep for the HOT crab leg. No matter, I wasn't interested in the crab legs.

4468320,2011-11-29,0,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"A buffet worth the visit, and this is being said after having a better experience here a month prior. The first time was a good time, with fantastic options up until closing down Seafood Friday. There was a rather decent raw bar with oysters and some tasty cold crab legs, that is...until I spied some unwanted sea-dodgy bugs on my hands. After inspecting the underside of a cluster, I saw them, like strawberry seeds along for the ride. Immediately being put off shell fish, I ate cautiously around the other dishes which were on par for a good Vegas buffet rating. For the price and variety, I did it again a few weeks later and was even willing to give the crab legs another go. They were sweet and aplenty. No hard feelings, Main Street. I believe in you. My only qualm is the consistency of your Friday Night Buffet. You have plenty to offer, but if you cannot deliver the same or better each week, I fear the response. There are too many chatty critics out there now (YELPs) to hide under a shroud of mediocrity. So scrub them crab legs !

Here are some reasons to patronize Main Street's Garden Court Buffet:

1. They offer a fantastic Friday Night Seafood Buffet for under $20. If you want more, you know you'll have to cough up more of your gambling dollars, so...why not have a hit-and-miss buffet, par for the course in Sin City. Steak, lobster 'n caviar options are out there for the spending. Perhaps save the bucks for vice instead?!

2. I had some of the best collard greens the first time dining there. The second trip a month later was definitely a wobble. Yuk to the muck. The greens were in another dimension the time before. But other hits to be noted were the raw oysters and variety of foods, from carved meats to decent desserts. Even if one thing bombs, there's another to take the glory. 
 
3. Gotta try the micro brews in the casino. Main Street Station Brewery serves up their own with pride and a $1.75 on tap. Really delicious, surprising and completely worth the trip downtown. I'm dreaming of a foam moustache.

4. Main Street Casino is attached to California Hotel via a walkway that will shoulder you from the outdoor elements. Don't forget to validate for free parking at more than one parking location.

5. The casino still accepts and spits out coin. Remember the old times, grubby fingers, buckets of change and the jangling of victory bells and falling metal-on-metal? Get in on that before it fades into Wikipedia. Fun times with one-armed-jack for sure.

Overall, I am reserved about this buffet, but still want them around. There are too many pros to outweigh the cons. If you want high-end, you know where to search for that. If you want straight ahead, go for this and play some old school slots while you're at it. Downtown apparently has a burgeoning art scene on the weekend so don't let the facade of The Strip keep you from experiencing some classic Vegas, baby.",0_WMZweOtQJTX-diaTRoqQ,1,0,3,603NNS8rVBycB-QrpJmX2w

The Garden Court Buffet is located inside of the Main Street Hotel and Casino (which is connected to the California Hotel and Casino). You have to walk all the way through the casino itself to find the buffet, but once you find it you will be glad you did. If you have a B Connected players' card you can get a $1.00 or so discount on your buffet purchase. The breakfast is usually around $9.00 a person, lunch and dinner is around $13.00ish.

They have daily specials such as prime rib and scampi, champagne brunch, etc. I have been here for both breakfast and dinner on separate visits to the Main Street. Both times I have found the food to be good tasting, the variety to be good enough to have something for everyone and the service is quick. 

On my last visit, which was a Monday night, there was an Asian Food section (Egg Rolls, Chow Mein, etc.), Mexican food (Menudo, taquitos, beans, etc.), Brisket, Turkey, loads of seafood and a pasta station where a cook will cook your pasta to order. Everything tasted fresh, not amazing, but well worth the small price.

I tried almost everything.  My favorites would have to be the Marsala pork chops, beef bourguignon, and Italian sausage.  I wasn't impressed with the orange chicken or the turkey in cream sauce.  The pineapple swordfish looked good, but I didn't get it.  Oh, just to be a little on the healthy side, I ate some collard greens which were great.  I had a slice of the beef brisket, which was a little tough. I was hoping for a turkey carving, but I guess that's where the turkey surprise came in.

For dessert, coconut cream pie, banana cream pie, and custard pie.  I had a cannoli, but the pastry was soft instead of crispy.  I guess they were frozen before being served.  That was the only disappointment.

It was Friday night around 7:30 and completely packed.  We had to line up in a way you'd line up for a ride at Disneyland.  People walking out were saying it's worth the wait so our hopes were high.  After an hour long repeat of walk-and-wait, we were finally seated.

I didn't realize that they change their menu daily, and that Friday night was seafood night - the most expensive night at $22.99pp...and no kid discount (unless your kid is 3yo or younger)!  We had to pay the same price for our 9yo and 5yo.  AYFKM?

And the food...mostly overcooked from sitting atop the warmers way too long.  I tried their salmon (tough), shrimp rice (hard), turkey salad (bland), crab salad (tough crab)...  I couldn't finish most of it.  The only thing I did finish was the green salad and cocktail shrimp (peeling the shell off of each one was a hassle though).  Even the pizzas that my kids got were dry (but better than what I tried).  Hubby said the egg rolls and steamed buns were hard too.  My friends said the giant steamed clams were tough and chewy, and the list goes on.  The crab must've been okay though.

If anything, the dessert station wasn't as bad.  I did like their hot bread pudding (but wasn't impressed with their custard pie).  Their soft serve was okay too, but I can't see how you can go wrong with that.

Bottom line:  Waste of money (especially for kids).",zT-5xnkEwhyCmWi2lUorrg,3,1,2,yT1_5WA0iviqmFnAHwhcOw

 What had been a rewarding relationship with the Garden Court Buffet (abbreviated GCB)  has become volatile and unpredictable. On its good days, GCB is a reasonably priced buffet serving decent (not great) food. Excluding themed buffet nights, $10.99 with a Boyd card is a sweet deal for a buffet in downtown Las Vegas that is walking distance to the Fremont Street Experience. A handful of my Fremont Street Experience adventures plus two visits to the IRS were anchored by dining experiences at GCB. Although the GCB selection has trailed behind many of the popular Las Vegas buffets, there was always a few delicacies to reward my taste buds. I have enjoyed their meat loaf, salmon, lasagna, rice pilaf, miso soup, and Asian foods station. A sweet dessert would top off the experience. 

  With any volatile relationship, the bad days pull you away. Yesterday was one of my few bad experiences here. And it is a shame because it was my day off and I just happened to have my mind set on topping off an afternoon in downtown at the GCB. This experience started off promising. By 5:30 pm, a line to the cashier had developed. Being proactive, management opened two cashier stations leading to a smooth transition to the host then table. From there, I might as well been as present as a utensil to the server. It took a while for him to acknowledge me. Finally he'd bring me my two glasses of Pepsi then pass over checking up on me afterwards. When I was on the buffet cues is when he'd clear off my table (small portions on my plate).  Near the end of the meal I'd give up on waiting around for him to ask me if I wanted coffee,  if he would of even done that. But forget about the service, I was disappointed with the food. 

   Supposedly this had been coined the Best Buffet in Vegas. I tend to disagree. I have dined here on and off for nearly a decade and no way this was the Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Today GCB is supposedly one of the top five buffets in Las Vegas according to their advertisement. No way! Right off the bat I could say that better buffets include Carnival, Red Rock, The Orleans, Boulder Station, and South Pointe. And if you add the higher priced buffets in the Bellagio category, GCB falls lower on the Las Vegas Buffet totem pole. On its good days it has been simply ""good."" 

   There are a few reasons why yesterday I was disappointed with the food. First off, sushi which is  currently my favorite buffet food was nonexistent. No sushi whatsoever. Boo! Then there was no peeled shrimp. Ditto for the meatloaf. The fish was unappealing. Celery spoiled the taste of the rice pilaf. Not much choices at the Asian foods station, which is my current second favorite buffet station. On a bright note there was miso soup. Disappointingly , the miso soup that I have relished in the past was now dull and a few degrees short of the warm temperature of how I prefer my soup. Regardless I'd fill up on miso soup. A complaint I have with their miso soup is that the soup cups are not much larger than the ones that you put cocktail sauce in when there are peeled shrimp. With my options running out, I'd place spaghetti on my nearly empty plate. If this is supposed to be the fifth best buffet in Las Vegas, how come they skimp over meatballs? Why did it taste like can pasta?  And why would I go back here in the foreseeable future? 

  My relationship with GCP has become volatile and unpredictable . The way I see it, you live once. If you live once, why settle for unpredictable experiences? It has come to the point that I will now separate from GCB for at least six months.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,7,2,UWwucQ71EFMdiDvHCItN6Q

4969167,2018-04-24,0,EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"I am giving Garden Court Buffet 4 stars because I believe it is by far the best buffet downtown.  It does not have all the bells and whistles of the Strip buffets, but considering the price, outside seafood Friday, the most expensive meal is $15.99, and the quality and quantity of the food compared to aforementioned Strip buffets, perhaps it deserves 5 stars!!  This review is from Wednesday, December 13, 2017.  I just read a question on Yelp if there is any difference in the food except for specialty nights (Tuesday, Friday and Saturday). After staying at Main Street Station (the home of this buffet) many times and always arriving on Wednesday it seems apparent that Wednesday is local night for Hawaiian residents, of which many of us are.  Hawaii is multicultural and over time the food of these cultures have melded and become favorites to most of us who live in Hawaii.  Examples of these foods available on Wednesdays are chicken longrice, manapua, local style rice, pork guisantes, kahlua pig and cabbage, oxtail stew, baked Ahi, fried rice, mac salad Hawaiian style, huli huli chicken, lomi salmon and much more.  I personally love these foods as well as much of the other food here. Although many of these are available every night, they are much more abundant on Wednesday. If you want a taste of Hawaii come Wednesday night.",7uGE04TQOVHNO6wSChabcQ,0,0,4,5pwBmQ62Cis0ost9tHNooQ

I got another chance to check out this place the past weekend for their Saturday Champagne brunch.  Apparently, one of the gals from our group called  to find out what time their brunch buffet ended. She was told that it's done by 10:30 am.  So, you can imagine how silly it must have looked to see us girls running in to get there before the 10:30 mark.  (It's actually until 3 pm.)

The main reason we were there were for their unlimited mimosas.  And for that, the Garden Court buffet served its purpose because our bachelorette girl had a very good buzz going on by the time we left.  Plenty of champagne and orange juice flowing to keep this soon-to-be bride happy and content.

They had some unique sections, especially food hailing from the islands of Hawai'i.  Our token Hawaiian girl was oohing and aahing over their food selection, gorging on Kalua pig, saimin noodles, mac salad, Portuguese sausage, etc.

They also had food hailing from Mexico, your standard breakfast fare of waffles, corned beef hash, ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, omelets made-to-order, etc.  Tons of dessert choices, although none of them intrigued me beyond the soft serve ice cream and toppings.

Overall, it's not too bad of a spread for the price you pay.  It's not crazy busy either since it's downtown Vegas.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,3,3,5_mRpIfmKpH1lTxk40Tdjg

They even had oysters. I was a bit skeptical so I only had 2. They were actually all right. The fried chicken was amazing!

My wife and kids have food allergies and every buffet we've ever been to the chefs have been accommodating, but the one we approached here was just straight out of bounds. 

She seemed irritated that we asked what ingredients were in the food. Excuse me, but do you think we asked to have these allergies. Most chefs inside buffets are happy to help because they are actually cook something to order vs. mass produce something pre-marinated.

It's been months since the last time I've been here. We took the relatives from Hawai'i to this buffet (they're first las vegas buffet) last night because it was the cheapest $17.99 Seafood Buffet in town. It also has other good food and great dessert which matters to me when it comes to buffets. And some ""ok-decent"" hawaiian food. NO MORE OXTAIL. I saw reviews & quick tips for that, but I saw none. sad face :(.  Also we went here b/c Green Valley Ranch's Feast Buffet is out of crab legs till JUNE! So props to Garden Court! :) 

They open at 4pm, so start lining up around 2:30 cuz there was a amusement-park-ride long line. We got there just before 4pm and the line was already out the door. We waited for almost an hour, got seated just before 5pm. 

We all went straight for the seafood section. All you can eat CRAB LEGS. The main reason for coming here. And for $17.99?! What more could you ask for?

oh btw the cold crab legs is near the salad area, the warm steamed crab legs is near the asian-hawaiian section, I didn't know that... you figure they would put them together. I wanted warm ones, but had already loaded my plate full of XXXL crab legs. 

My family and I would say, ""JACKPOT!!!"" each time we opened a super stuffed crab leg filled with lots of meat..... SCORE! Worked out my arms cracking crab legs. feeelin' the burn! 

We're a silly & crazy family, so imagine random yells of ""JACKPOT!!!"" inside the buffet area. We like to have fun. :P

This is a pretty good buffet compared to others when it comes to selection and price.

My major rant about this one was they didn't refill the CANNOLIS! I know they weren't the best, but they were pretty good for a buffet, I'm a big fan of dessert. In my opinion this was the best dessert they had there! I haven't seen cannolis in any other buffets the last time i went. 
There were only a few left when I got some, and they didn't refill. I asked the guy behind the counter, and he said that's all they had for the day. WTH...... LOSE MONEY big time! :( sad face. I should've got all the ones i saw which was about THREE. I still can't believe they didn't have anymore for a buffet. They don't serve milkshakes so ask for a cup of milk, and grab some ice cream and mix your own... haha. Need to take advantage of everything they have to offer. ;P

DESSERT - decent -ok. lots of pies. 
self serve soft serve ice cream w/ m&m's, nuts, & syrup on the side (chocolate, caramel, butterscotch.) 
A rolled up chocolate cream thing was pretty good too if you like chocolate. 
Chocolate covered marshmallow cream filled thing, it was ok... kinda weird, but I'm not a fan of it. 

The coconut shrimp & blacked trout was good. 
The clams were chewy, not a fan of that. 
The crab & mussels soup -- only the soup was good. I LOVE mussels so i was disappointed with the mussels. :( sad face. 
BBQ Ribs - good sauce but lots of fat, not enough meat. ewww gross. I don't like fatty meat. bleh.
Enchilada, kalua pig, lomi lomi, shrimp ceviche...kinda salty. 
Hot wings - pretty good for buffet. 

That's all I remember having... 5 plates, several small plates of dessert & ice cream. I'm stuffed. I think I'm good till Sunday. 

Despite the cannoli incident, we were all happy :). Service was great, our waiter was awesome (an older filipino man), he was able to patiently put up with my dad's 10 million soda refills & napkin requests. Of course we left him a good tip. :)

The service here was super slow. There were two small families in front of us waiting to be seated when we got there, but we looked around the buffet and probably 85% of the tables were empty! I could not figure out why they were making us wait when there were so many open tables. A waitress came over and stood near all of us who were waiting in line. She started talking on a walkie-talkie to another waitress who was standing about 20 feet away from her, so close that we could actually hear her talking without the walkie. They were just wasting time talking about which tables to seat people at for at least five minutes, trying to make it seem like they were dealing with a really intense situation. It was a joke.

After finally being seated I noticed there were lots of tables with dirty dishes on them that hadn't been cleaned yet, and a LOT of servers just walking around slowly talking to each other or laughing, hardly working at all. That explains why they were making us wait- because nobody was clearing the tables. Our waiter took forever to come take our drink order; I was so thirsty I had to pull out a bottle of water from my purse to drink (that's how long it took). It's not like they were super busy or short on workers, there were probably more workers there than guests. They were just REALLY slow.

This was the highest rated, even beating out Golden Nugget, which surprised me. I agree with other reviewers that the food is hit and miss. If you like Italian, go to the chef who will prepare your pasta to order. Pizza was fair at best. Chinese seemed limited, but I liked their egg rolls. I have a sweet tooth so I saved room for 2 pieces of cake and a slice of pie. I know, right?  Chocolate cake is fair, but I enjoyed the Coconut cake. Then dove into a chocolate creme pie slice and that was pretty good. Service is excellent. Had a great grandma of a waiter who was wonderful.",U35ZrUa8wF0mWuX_NDy7XA,0,0,4,eKmD0kIBy6K2q7yIN2midg

The crab and oysters were plentiful and we stuffed our faces until we could not fit anything more. We even brought our own sauce from home since we don't care for the typical butter with lemon dipping sauce. The crabs were a little smaller than before but what can you expect with overfished oceans. We spoke to one of the the chefs and he told us they throw out massive amounts of leftover food everyday. They feed their employees with some but most of it gets trashed. Very sad. 

There is a wide selection of additional dishes to compliment the seafood. I particularly love the corn with my seafood. Go easy on the rice or you might overstuff yourself.

You obviously have to have lower standards if you're eating at a buffet, at least I always do otherwise I'm severely disappointed.

The lowdown on the food:

-Tuna Salad. Yup. I only got a little on my first go around, but you can bet that I went back for a heaping 2nd scoop. I'm a black pepper addict and this had tons of it, so I was lovin it. I put some on one of the biscuits and devoured it like I'd never eaten before.
-Chicken wings -- Fan-freaking-tastic. They were a dry rub, which led me to believe they may be disappointing, but they were perfect. The meat was falling off the bone which signals perfectly cooked to me.
-Kahului pork -- It was only meh for me. I've never experienced much Hawaiian food though, so take it with a grain of salt.
-BBQ pork -- Great seasoning but for a good pork rib, you want it to be moist and falling off the bone. This required the use of a fork to get the meat off the bone. Pass.
-Sweet and sour pork -- Pretty tasty but lukewarm. It's hard for me to get into anything lukewarm unless I have a microwave nearby.
-Fajita chicken - Also lukewarm, nothing special. I don't think I finished it.
-Beef Tacos - I liked the seasoning but I didn't fall out of my seat with love. Pass.

I had a few other random things like mashed potatoes, salads, desserts, etc but nothing really worth highlighting.

I was about 50-50 on the food, which is why it led me to 3 stars. I did love the cheapness of it though and think the price alone would be worth a few of the stand out dishes.",3wDRFdjpeq36Es97Zj2iVw,1,0,3,h2fOUQL31zzjueZDH8NVmg

Among the buffers in the Downtown area, this Buffet is the better one if not the best. They have a descent variety of different dishes representing American, Mexican and Asian with Hawaiian influences. 

A cool aspect of this buffet is the build your pasta station, which to my suprise was good. Throughout out the years I have been coming here, the servers are usually good but sometimes they lack in good and consistent customer service. However, for the value and price point. This Buffet is a good option especially if your in the area and need a Buffet to fulfill an appetite. Plus, the Titanic looking ambience adds to the experience!

Pro's - beautiful decor.  

Final analysis : Not worth it, even at the low pricel.  Even the breakfast buffet at Circus Circus could out do this one.

From start to finish, this was a horrible breakfast experience.  First, the parking says 'free with validation ' but it's pay first, then get reimbursed from the cashiers cage.  Not the accepted definition of validation!   Also, the parking attendant was a complete jerk, when asked about it. 

Once inside, we waited almost thirty minutes in line to pay.  One Cashier for a line that stretched to over fifty people?  Really? Right as we were checking out, we heard someone on the walkie talkies say she was coming to the front to assist with checkout.  Insult to injury at that point.

The selection and quality of food was absolutely terrible.  Scrambled eggs that were runny.  The line for individual omelettes was so long as to make it not worth the wait.  If you expected fresh fruit, you'd be disappointed, it was all canned.  While I know they don't make their own pudding, you don't want it (or the yogurt) looking like it had just been dumped out of a can into a bowl.  Also, three separate giant bowls of prunes seemed like overkill.  

The bacon and sausage were very good, but by the time I wanted seconds, the lines for food were ten people deep.  Bread products were obviously frozen and/or made elsewhere.  Bread still in its plastic bags was left out for toast.  They didn't even have real butter, just 'spread'.",J5-cy1GRpcqR13bHJEc4yw,0,0,1,3pio85igDydk7YJ--HsCcw

No fresh seafood, the prime rib was alright (I had a chewy overcooked piece), and they ran out of some items. I was looking to try  the lamb chops that was on the Thanksgiving menu tonight but they had run out tonight. 2 hours before the place closed. So I ended up settling and pretty much only the oxtail stew which was their saving grace. They were also out of miso soup, which I find surprising since it's really just dissolving some miso paste into hot water... 

Overall for $16/person, it's not terrible. But they ran out of stuff on a night that is expected to be busy. Would I come back again? Possibly. But I'm not sure if it would be worth $20+ for the seafood nights unless it's as good as everyone else here says it is.",WsOJwl_Uc4FsRHz4EHInnA,0,0,2,ydx-NuK7F50ZG0rwyQunyA

They had pizza, chicken wings, mashed potato, kalua pig, rice, and other dishes. I appreciated the fact that they had a salad bar and creamy horse radish!! 
The Desserts are cute, but not much to choose from and it's random fruits and cupcakes. But for the price you pay, you're definitely getting your monies worth. The food is tasty. No complaints there and service is quick. Most times. Our server forgot to refill our drinks, but no biggie since we were more eager to gamble. Lol 

I'll definitely come back for the cheap food, it's located on Main Street and we were staying at California. So to get here, just cross the indoor bridge that's connecting both hotels and go to the bottom floor. 

There were no lines when we got there for breakfast in the mornings. So that was a good thing because we normally wanted to just fill our tummies and gamble after. We would be in there for at least half an hour. It was super cheap. We didn't feel the need to over stuff ourselves lol.

Downfall; they stop serving food early. That was the only thing I disliked about it. We wanted to come for dinner but they'd be closed. So we would have to go to the other buffet in our hotel (California).

I'd highly recommend this place because for a few bucks you'll get to stuff yourself til your hearts content. Lol",1vBhMcZeZGHxu5Kc7YDS9g,2,0,5,8wue53bJWRpv4vK2Z2t85w

I have mixed feelings about the buffet at Main Street. I usually like to try places at least twice to see if there is any inconsistency but on this past trip, we ate here twice and the two experiences were on opposite sides of the spectrum. We had their Friday Seafood Dinner buffet and the Breakfast buffet the next morning. Service was the deal breaker for me.

The Seafood buffet is pretty popular and the line is already long from when they open at 4pm. Note for Hawaiian voucher users: it's a dinner voucher plus $8 for this buffet. The highlight of this buffet was the steamed crab legs! Oh, so delicious. I can eat crab for daysssss! If you're from Hawaii, you know the main staple in your diet is rice. That holds true even for me, but not when I eat at buffets. I cut out the starches so that I get my money's worth with the seconds and thirds on the crab legs! Our server was very attentive and was made available to fulfill our requests: shoyu, tabasco, extra napkins, etc. He brought it in a jiffy! He was on top of refills as well. The crab already had little slits in them to make it easier to crack. Our server noticed I had pretty acrylic nails and was having a difficult time getting the meat out so he gave me one of those little crab pitch forks without even asking! It made it so much easier for me. Thank you, Mr. Server for saving me from breaking a nail! My tummy was very satisfied after dinner.

On to breakfast. Note: Hawaiian voucher plus $3 for the buffet. Really, you can't go wrong with breakfast food. They had the spread of items from eggs benedict and bagels to portuguese sausage and bacon. I love when they have made-to-order stations and this one, you guessed it, was an omelette station. I like to watch how quickly they move to get through the line and yet they show no pressure when flipping the egg! Nom nom nom. What made this experience unpleasant was the lack of attention from the server. She was too busy setting other tables to check up on us. Or maybe it was because we were sitting way in the boonies of the restaurant. I never got a refill on my OJ and I was parched. The one thing our tour escort told us to make sure we did was drink lots of liquids because the heat was not what we islanders are used to. It is disappointing when you get free refills as part of the buffet and bringing us drinks is basically all they need to do! They don't take our orders or serve our food.

Located on the Old Las Vegas side of the strip near the California hotel (a hot spot for locals from Hawai'i) this place is an old school gem that I truly adore since this visit. 

Recommended by my boyfriend's sister before heading out to Vegas, we were eager to try this buffet for their seafood night, which falls on every friday.  Couple of suggestions before getting here: Get here early and hungry!!

As soon as you get towards the garden court you immediately feel warm and cozy, the line was long and was made up of mostly local people from hawai'i, ya know the little asian grandmas and grandpas? Lots of families, and hungry eaters.  

By the time my friend chris, my bf and I got to the front of the line we were ready to eat those crab legs. I shopped around a bit to see if they had anything else I wanted, I got chicken long rice and crab.  We stuck with the steamed crabs, which were delicious and big.

They make it easy for you by cracking the legs, since there is such a high demand for crab legs during seafood night, they don't, I repeat, they don't give crackers! Got it? We attempted asking our waiter for some and he just gave us a, ""don't ask me that again,"" look.  Okay, I know it's busy, and you're bussing tables, and sweating, but we're nice! 

Anyways, we all LOVED the crab legs, I think I had two plates, and the boys had three, I'm sure.  We got mini battle scars from cracking all of those legs, but man, were they worth it! By the time we were crab legged out, we were ready for dessert, and being the sweet tooths we are, there was a great selection of sweet bites. 

I absolutely recommend this place for the food, mostly the crab legs because that was really good as well as the dessert.  Service was: meh, but what can I say, it's buffet, it was busy, and I'm sure they were doing the best they can =)",5rDW0VrYEc9-XyuAU4aMHw,3,2,4,y-oClt1q9alLVx9fHlW5dQ

My wife actually broke out with some crazy rash after eating there. Fremont Casino's ""Paradise"" buffet is more like a paradise for heat lamps although I can't totally hate on that one only for the ""Swingers"" movie factor.  The servers must be sick of patrons ordering the age of enlightenment there.

Back to the subject at hand.  I got a buy one, get one free coupon so this was a great motivator to finally go.  I know the champagne brunch is everyone's highlight but there's no way I'm ever at Fremont that early unless I'm still there from the night before.

Most buffets don't do much as far as atmosphere but I dug the old school vibe.  The place felt very welcoming with how well lit and clean everything looked.  We didn't have lunch that day so we opted for dinner at the senior citizenesque time of 4:30pm.  Lo and behold there was already a line full of seniors but it wasn't a long wait at all.    

It was T-bone steak night which was fine.  Standard $6 breakfast type t-bones but I tore though two of them so no complaints here!  I was most impressed with the southern/soul food.  Fried chicken, yams and collard greens were all solid.  Everything else ranged between average or a little above but that's amazing compared to most downtown buffet joints.

For me, what I like to eat here for breakfast is the Chicken Fried Steak! It is a meaty, breaded, fried meat patty, which you can add on the white mushroom gravy, & throw it into a biscuit! 
Yeah, it maybe a little unhealthy............but so long as you don't eat it everyday...........it's all about moderation right? Add in a little scrambled egg & cut fried potatoes and we are good to go!

This buffet is so big, they offer the basic breakfast meats - bacon, ham, sausages, egg & Portuguese sausages. 
There is also many types of fruit if you're looking for something healthy...........and they do offer the oatmeal, waffles, & pastries too.  

Too many items to eat in one sitting I must say, but at least you can try a little at a time when you go to this place........

The staff is friendly, the cooks are all very nice, we had conversations with most of the staff, a lot of them had been there for well over 10yrs because they enjoyed it so much.  They were attentive and kept our cups full and our plates cleaned.

While the staff I encountered were friendly enough, I was unfortunately underwhelmed by the actual food. 

The biggest disappointment was the Portuguese Sausage. My eyes brightened when I saw it as I had fond memories of being introduced to that style at the Stardust (RIP) back in 2006 and had not since found it in Vegas or anywhere else. However, unlike that initial starlit experience, the Garden Court's version lacked in spice and overall flavor. I've read raves about the omelet guy but, sadly, I'm not an egg person. The highlight for me was the donut selection, which isn't necessarily saying much unless they are made in-house.

If you're already a guest of Main Street Station who wants to either refuel quickly or use their food credit then the Garden Court Buffet may suffice. Otherwise, I would not make a special trip here with so many other options on or near Fremont. Perhaps the mileage varies at lunch or dinner but I'd sooner go to Triple 7 Brewpub.

There were many pros to this buffet. Once seated, our server quickly took our drink orders and we were able to go get our food. They have a pretty good variety of options and it's organized well. There seemed to be something for everything. The food was ok as well. 

Now, onto the con and it's one heck of a con. I unfortunately caught sight of a roach on the line, right on the waffle, biscuit and corned beef hash station and that obviously stopped my appetite in it's tracks. That's unforgivable in my book, I won't be back.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,6,1,M-Znax6vnu-9wJBcxSOBfQ

The salad bar does offer fresh veggies and their dressings are all fresh and homemade. My favorite are the ranch and bleu cheese-no bottled vinegary taste, just real creaminess! There is a wide variety of basic buffet food- American ribs, carved roast beef and ham, fried chicken, etc. What makes this more unique is the far end of the buffet where you'll find Hawaiian manapua, kahlua pork, Chinese chow mein and egg rolls, fried rice, and miso soup. I know, random, but this buffet caters to the Hawaiians that fly over on special tours. Be glad! You'll enjoy their Hawaiian friendliness and smiles! For the price, it's a good buffet. Use your B-Connected card for $1.00 off...hey, it's better than nothing!",XdtIZ5tUDY6IICs4Df6nlw,1,0,3,Uva-hm5FFxpb8PnfMBHFrw
