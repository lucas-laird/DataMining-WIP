I decided to stop by here for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the McBites...the McBites are not that great, they are way too breaded. I guess I'll just stick to my McNuggets next time. 

The staff was very friendly and the service was fast.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,0,4,xwJdS3TzN4cLXpm6oYj3SA

They even assign numbers to the menu in case you can't pronounce the exotic food names.  I had this dish called a ""Big Mac"" - thank god for the numbering system because I couldn't pronounce that.  

My ""Big Mac"" was served in some sort of box - almost like a broke down Japanese Bento Box. There were two beef patties and a bunch of accoutrements.  It was amazing!  The beef patties had the texture of a bunch of crumpled newspapers - yummy!  The sauce?  Don't get me started on the sauce!  There are no adjectives to accurately describe the deliciousness.

The best thing about McDonalds?  The fact that I was hungry again three hours later!  It's like you can eat a mountain of food and your body just digests it instantaneously - almost like there's 0 nutritional value.  I would totally recommend this place to a friend!",wlV5ptCfrv3nWktjjk6nxA,0,0,5,lvM5Y99O7fGfaZ5bKJFQZA

This is a very clean and modern restaurant with a spacious atmosphere and excellent staff.  I ordered the Quarter Pounder Deluxe meal and it was freshly made and looked very appealing.  I also ordered two Quarter Pounders (buy one get one free when you fill out the online survey) for later.  I requested a bag for them and the shift manager offered to put them in a bag for me.  This appears to be a really good crew, as I've been there for all three meals and haven't had any problems.

The staff are very friendly. The reason I took off a star is because the tables/booths are usually very dirty if you dine-in. 

The drive-thru is generally quick. I have only experienced a few occasions where it was backed up. I would recommend this for the general fast-food chains, if you need a quick meal.",kktCclB2t8nDQn5VKXXvlw,1,1,4,kVu8sohScseKYa3z3oUx-A

I visit this location frequently. I've never been disappointed.

The Ambiance is awesome! The decor is very modern and artistic. The dining room is always clean, and well stocked with utensils, napkins, ketchup, plastic lids and straws.

The service has always been good when I've visited. My wife had an issue once, and it was resolved.

It's in a great location with very easy entrance and exit access. It's near the 215 freeway.

There is a huge salt water fish-tank inside and as for amenities there's a double lane drive-thourgh. That's what sets this place apart from other fast food establishments of the franchise.

Great place for CHEAP eats even if your keeping your calorie intake in mind. I love their fruit Parfait  with 150 calories and the hash browns are 150 calories too.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,2,2,4,-XbGTvA-1i5PEIG53ZU66g
3955212,2017-02-15,1,4s_kb5VXnx96fEJLZ_AkIQ,"I stopped in here for a quick dinner. It seemed like all of their cashiers were avoiding the cash registers. The one that took my order had trouble taking the deal that I had on the McDonald's app. She needed assistance from her supervisor. Still I was out of there in no time with my food.

Here's what I ordered:
*Grand Mac*
I had always thought that the Big Mac was a bit small to be called ""big"". Thank goodness they now have the Grand Mac. Everything that makes the Big Mac great, only bigger. With the deal that I got on the McDonald's app, it came with free french fries and a regular drink. The fries were unfortunately not fresh and were a bit soggy. I usually get non-sweetened tea. All they had was sweet tea. Oh well, I went with a Fruitopia drink.

*10 pcs Chicken McNuggets*
These are still one of my favorite items to order at McDonald's. Just like their french fries, I prefer McD's over all of the other fast food burger restaurants. I used to like their sweet & sour or hot mustard dipping sauce when I was a kid, but nowadays I usually get their tried and true barbecue sauce.",zFo--zdHXg6KJ1RYd8r1BA,1,2,3,GK6w3W_x1FxXHOXHlWYm3A
3970964,2011-12-11,1,4s_kb5VXnx96fEJLZ_AkIQ,"I stopped here today to get a salad and a shake.  They have a setup for the drive through I've never seen before.  Because of the limited driveway space, the entrance splits into two drives, both of which have ordering areas.  This allows the cars to get into the drive through section quicker and not block traffic in the shopping center.

Service was fast and polite, and the wait for the food was minimal.  They have free wifi at this location and I saw a sign about two nights of jazz by a live singer in their McCaf√© on two nights in December.  I wish I could make one of the nights just to try it out.  Sounds like fun!

Since this is a new McDonald's that opened within the past few months and it's only about 2 miles from home, I'll be stopping at this location more often.  Way to go, McDonald's staff!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,1,0,4,nbnqWwJeChcOeQfGvk37cw

Great spot for a late night snack after a couple of beers across the street at PKWY. Staff is always friendly and fries are usually fresh (a large percentage of why I go to McD's).

The person behind the counter said that they are temporarily not offering military discounts. Wow!  It seems more like a case-by-case basis because I went by 2 days ago and picked up a small order and received the discount. Either there's a discount for US veterans or there isn't.

5772413,2013-10-08,1,4s_kb5VXnx96fEJLZ_AkIQ,"So I felt like being naughty and getting a cheese burger, however, once I looked at the menu I saw they had a wrap and thought to myself ""humm a wrap sounds good."" 
So that is exactly what I got. I remember years ago they had those snack wraps and that is what I was expecting size wise. 

They have 3 different kinds chicken bacon ranch, chicken ranch, and a sweet chili one. I opted for the ranch grilled chicken, it had lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, giant pieces of chicken, wrapped in a soft pillowy flour tortilla. 

FIRST let me say not was I wrong about the size. This thing was MASIVE. I also got the combo so medium fries and a drink. Of course I ate my fries first then dug into the wrap and it wasn't bad, I actually liked it. I could only eat about half of it though because of those stinking fries I was full. 

I went about a week later and tried the sweet chili one with grilled chicken and like it even more. This time I just got the wrap since there was no need for a combo, I knew it would fill me up. I also really liked the way they boxed up the wrap its in a cool container that  makes it easy to eat.",UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A,0,1,4,iDLvq-BeYTniIUxwKqUPKg
