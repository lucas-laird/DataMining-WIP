917715,2015-07-22,0,-Jo0rJr2mZxBVgaJqDs-TQ,it's pretty good I really enjoyed the egusi and the jellof rice wasn't bad at all. If you're craving for Naija food on a Vegas turn up check it out they even have places to sit if you want to eat there.,NiQV7bCVH9IVpGe7SwHvTg,2,1,5,camBiNK-5KDdYfZZMhoxcA
2030207,2017-02-24,0,-Jo0rJr2mZxBVgaJqDs-TQ,Saw a review for the restaurant in the Review Journal and wanted to try it.  Went at 4:30pm when the hours on the door said they should be open but they weren't. Waited for a bit and was told they wouldn't be open again until 630p.  Won't waste my time coming back.,abNi4mf0ezXa87eQwxvdWw,1,0,1,esHShA1P2KjrhttK_z-mAw
2426761,2018-03-22,0,-Jo0rJr2mZxBVgaJqDs-TQ,"For $75, we ordered,

1. Egusi and Goat --- 2.5 out of 5 --- Just a goat skin ... Egusi was ok.

2. Jollof rice, fried rice and Goat --- 1 out of 5 --- Rice was not too tasty. Boney goat. A bite of meat and had to toss.

3. Efo (vegetable) and Goat --- 3.5 out of 5 --- Goat was a bit better, and efo was good.

4. Chicken drumsticks --- 2 out of 5 --- pepper sauce was great but the chicken was **medium rare** after the exterior bite on most pieces. Had to toss most of it so we don't get sick.

Truth is for $75, we could've just picked up something else and not had to toss most of the protein. Not a lot of money lost but still. I also wish they honored my pickup time as I had to spend 23 mins waiting for the food to be ready (after almost a 2-hour lead time on the order), which caused me to spend $50 on a taxi for a different friend as my driver was occupied with me. Note that I called again 15 mins before arriving and was told, curtly, ""it's not time yet."" Nevertheless, food was still late.

Usually, I like to support Afro-Carribean dining but it's sad because it seems it's a risk most times. It's like ... ""you know the Chinese restaurant down the street is not awesome, but it's cheaper and you are quite familiar with your expectations there"" .... get what I mean? I just expected much better food from a Nigerian restaurant.

I'll give it one more chance --- to support --- (fingers crossed).",6s149mWoASzs5MR_rw7x5A,0,0,2,Zr5GuIACnxr3iib2j039OA

I also recommend ordering before you go, it takes quite some time to prepare. We call before we dine in and carry out.",lA-WeZ9J5PMN6rAXTshbYg,0,0,5,wCFmA6qtU7p0wsD7AnmIOg
4905404,2016-11-27,0,-Jo0rJr2mZxBVgaJqDs-TQ,"This restaurant is clean, ok service, with ok food. Nothing fancy. Be careful with the menu, can be a bit misleading e.g. Suya is $3.99 per stick (ridiculous!!!), but only written in fine print, so you can miss it. I personally did not like the vegetable soup, but my sister did.",S19ejdg5wpglqGNlXz-QnA,2,0,3,6zCbk_bf2Sk8G9cRZrrkoA

My only complaint is - the pounded yam wasn't mixed properly.",hlmJDUjixQ3SSinvbwltXg,1,0,4,MCY2hCUwR0ayy3eVxgndhg
