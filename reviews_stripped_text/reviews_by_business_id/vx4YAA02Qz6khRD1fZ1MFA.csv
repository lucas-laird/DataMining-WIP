Prices is more than other places off the strip but it's cheaper than dim sum on the strip. Free refills on soda, I haven't been to any places that serves dim sum where you can get free refills on soda.

A bit more pricey than other Dim Sum places but its so well worth it. My daughter loves this place! We used to go to Harbor Palace years ago, but the quality have since dropped. The Dim Sum are just not the same quality you get there compared to Ping Pang Pong. I heard another good (real authentic cantonese cuisine) place is some Orchid Restaurant (not Thai) up in Sahara and Jones somewhere. Its in the corner, a very very old restaurant.

Inside you will find Ping Pang Pong's fabulous new restaurant. Take a minute and watch the cooks do their thing it's amazing. At Ping Pang Pong you can relax and feel at home even though you are surrounded by a full house of hungry people. The nice part is the staff will bend over backwards to make sure your food and dining is just the way you would expect. If you have any special needs just ask for Krysty she will get it done.

Seeing its popularity on Yelp and its long business hours, I assumed it would be ok to have lunch in the early afternoon. Upon arriving around 2pm, there was a line around 15 parties. Once seated, we only saw two types of carts circulating:one with hot dishes and one baked goods. That was it. When asked about other usual dim sum dishes, none of them was available. We were told the kitchen has closed. What a disappointment. For the dishes that were available, they were just ok, nothing special beyond any regular dim sum places in the Bay Area. Lessons learned: only go there during busy time but then one has to endure the long line in the smoke filled casino.

Got sat quickly and it took them about 15 minutes to ask what we wanted to drink, at the same we said we were ready to order and the person just walks away and another 15 - 20 minute wait on just order. So the order is put in for roast duck, fried rice and walnut shrimp. We start eating and drinking our sodas and no one comes by with refills so at this point I just want to eat and leave but nope. They just walk by and don't acknowledge us at all. So I had to get up and pay for the meal at the front desk and tell them straight up I'm not tipping them. The girl at the counter just looks and me and doesn't say anything at all. I will not be dining there at all in the future until they know how to treat their customers.

208919,2011-07-13,0,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"I've eaten at Ping Pang Pong twice now and had two very different meals with two very different outcomes. My first experience with PPP was for Dim Sum. It was absolutely delicious and very authentic. I've been eating at some of the great Dim Sum houses in Alhambra (East of Downtown LA) and surrounds for years and years and was quite surprised and pleased that PPP was able to serve up Dim Sum that was on par with some of the greats like Ocean Star and NBC (Both on Atlantic Blvd. Alhambra...Don't miss 'em). 

Ping Pang Pong serves a wide variety of Dim Sum and the carts filled with the steaming treats are plentiful. The prices are similar to places in Alhambra & Los Angeles, however, instead of placing four of something on a plate, they put three. Nonetheless, the food is terrific. Lunch for three very satisfied people was about $10-$12 per person...and we were stuffed. Bravo on Dim Sum PPP.

Now the downside to the story...

My second trip to the restaurant was for dinner. We ordered Hot & Sour Soup, Pineapple Beef, Seafood Noodles, and Squab in Lettuce Cups. Overall a great disappointment. 

The Hot & Sour soup was the best dish we ordered, so we started off the meal well. The Squab in Lettuce Cups were good, but not great...and a bit on the chintzy side. Because there were four of us, we were required to order two additional pieces of lettuce at $1 apiece. Come on...two extra dollars for two tiny pieces of lettuce? The Pineapple Beef had absolutely NO FLAVOR. It was terrible actually. I don't even think they put salt in it it was that tasteless. The pineapple chunks were straight out of a can...and the can was probably from the 99 Cent store. Just plain bad. The Noodles were about average from any Chinese restaurant. 

Towards the end of the meal I felt like I would only come back to this place for Dim Sum but some of my dinner companions disagreed. We did see dishes that looked really savory and tempting being served to other tables. The Walnut Glazed Shrimp looked amazing!  

The overall consensus was that we may have just ordered a couple of dishes that were lackluster and that Ping Pang Pong is worthy of another dinner experience. Their Dim Sum is first rate so I know they know how to cook.",ngk1yxWvxCuO_lvJ87PReg,0,0,4,vqsNRsou32_aOc2idzDYLg

Upon arrival, the long wait, approx 25 min, led me think that this was some place good.  All the good places have lines right?  There were also many other Chinese and other Asian people there which would also be another indicator.

When I sat down and started getting food, I was a bit disappointed.  Some of the food that should have been hot or at least warm was rather cool.  Not the best sign.  Some of the food was good, but having spent over decade in San Francisco and about four years about 10 miles east of Los Angeles, PPP could not compare to any except the lower quality restaurants that I've tried.

This past Sunday around 9pm I went to the restaurant with my family and was seated towards the front of the restaurant. We left the casino at 1130, and I realized I had lost my phone. We looked around the restaurant and casino for my phone, but it was no where to be found. After an hour or two, my mother decided to go back while I searched for it in the car and other places. 

As soon as she walked into the restaurant (she didn't even say a word), the employees aggressively approached my mother by telling her they didn't have the phone and to stop asking because they do not have it. My mom felt that something was wrong because they were acting so defensive, so she called security to file a complaint. Her and the security looked over the table but sure enough my phone was no where to be found. About five minutes after security left the restaurant, they ""just happened to find my phone."" It is a busy restaurant, the table was at the front of the entrance, the employees supposedly cleaned the table thoroughly, and this was over a span of a few hours. After a couple of hours, how did they just happen to find my phone especially when they aggressively kept telling us they looked and found nothing. 

To top it all off, I called my phone about 30 times, yet all of the missed calls were magically erased. Also, since I called my phone so much, how did not one person in the restaurant hear or see it vibrate. 

Obviously this restaurant has no integrity, and they only returned the phone after we got security involved. It is unlikely that a customer would return the phone after a few hours of keeping it, and it is so ironic that my phone was returned a few minutes after security arrived.

256576,2010-09-01,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Dinner for two, 7:30 Tuesday evening:  horrendous service.  Period.

The dining area was frigid.  Icicles were forming on every word spoken at the table.  I thought I saw a yeti leave the kitchen area with his hands in his armpits, trying to stay warm on his way to the restroom.

On second thought, that might've been our server because the ""service"" we were afforded was GROSS.  

We were scolded for standing in the empty take-out line instead of the empty dine-in line (we'd changed our minds),  the servers (we had a couple on this slow night) were hard pressed to make any eye contact - we actually had a server deliver food to the table with her back to us?  How'd she do that??  I was looking for skates at that point.

In one moment I made accidental eye contact with the server and grinned as my mouth was full of mediocre Seafood Noodles.  I could almost hear her straining as she squeezed out a smirk.

A smirk.  And I'm not even kidding.  I was kidding about the yeti but the smirk was SO real.

We recognized one of the bus boys by his warm smile and friendly service.  I'm so annoyed with myself for not getting his name this time so I could give him propers.  He was a tropical island floating in a sea of ice.

In any event, the food.  The first time I came here I had Seafood Noodles and they rocked harder than Meatloaf.  Memory is a funny thing.  This time, there was little seafood and the bit present wasn't really a great mix.  I had one or two shrimp and a fistful of squid.  Had it been called Squid Noodles I'd have been happy.  The noodles were oily and the overall flavor wasn't anything to write home about.  We also had Salt and Pepper Calamari - which was more squ-  I mean, nice.  The calamari was tender

In the end, the check came to about $20 for both of us and still, I felt bad tipping because the service was Bizarro World grade.

292399,2013-06-14,4,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"In town for the '13 WSOP event 18, Ping Pang Pong has been a must-stop-by place the last 3 visits for their dim sum. Out of our large group of friends, 3 newbies and 4 vets of dim sum tagged along.

We stuck with the basics for the sake of the folks new to dim sum but their selection really isn't that big to begin with. They have all of the typical items and they do most of them well.

Steamed pork dumplings (shui mai) were very good. They were bigger than average, lots of pork goodness and hints of chopped mushrooms. The pork bulges out of the wonton wrapping like they were on 'roids.

Steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow) were good. The translucency made the newbies stare at it for a bit but the shrimp was fresh and there was an average amount.

Steamed BBQ pork buns (char siu bao) were average. Rather typical and on the small side but the filling was tasty. The baked versions were very good and the bread almost melts in your mouth. The thin egg wash layer on the top makes it a little sticky but it probably keeps it soft instead of crusty. Both fillings were just sweet enough without overpowering the pieces of pork.

Chow mein came in a big heap. The onions and green onions gives it a decent flavor but it didn't have the crispy, wok/pan fried edges it should have. It went well with the steamed pork ribs.

Speaking of pork ribs, they were also given a double take by the newbies as they look more like sedimentary rock than meat. They were fine but lacked the bit of black bean sauce it usually has. There was also only a few pieces in the dish but some of them were pretty meaty. Careful of the small bones as they are cut from the rib tip ends.

The steamed shrimp rice noodles (har cheung fun) were great as the shrimp again is fresh and there were plenty of them in each piece; 3 to an order. The noodle was slick and not chewy. They are drowned a bit in a light soy sauce. The beef version wasn't as great and had little seasoning but that's probably due to being steamed.

The deep-fried glutenous rice dumpling (hom sui gok) were good. Crispy yet light on the outside, the filling was a bit small but the pork, shrimp, and mushrooms were tasty.

I think I'm missing an item or two but dessert came as the sticky buns (gai mei bao) and were very good. The bread was nice and soft and the coconut and custard filling wasn't too sweet. This was a big hit at the table.

No one wanted to try the stuffed eggplants but in previous visits they were very good - not overcooked limpy and the filling of shrimp was crispy. No sight of chinese broccoli (gai lan) this time but in previous visits the dish was small and the broccoli was on the small side themselves. Didn't get any crispy spring rolls but there were average with a shrimp and pork filling. Other items I never tried are the different rice porridge, jelly fish, bbq pork and cummin filled pastries, and chicken feet.

It was a Monday morning around 11, an hour after they had opened, and it was about 60% full. The water refills were pretty steady and the carts that deliver the dim sum were coming and going at a good rate. It's at the far end of the casino floor and open to a bunch of slot machines on one side. My Sprint phone struggled to get a decent signal there.

Our bill came out to about $15 per person including tip, which is pretty typical price.

From their usual menu (and previous visits), the wor wonton soup is decent with lots of it in an order. The pot stickers were nicely pan fried, a bit doughy and the filling was okay. The grilled lamb chops were ok but they were mostly bone. The beef flat rice noodles were a bit greasy but tasty. However it didn't have a lot of beef in it.",H0or19jTnvDTtl3l9oKE6Q,8,2,4,Q5FcWctmKpu4kMkMsodSGA

Things to skip : stir fried bee hoon, Siew mai, har gao .

I have lived in many cities and travelled overseas and I can safely say this is easily the top 3 best dimsum I have ever had.  It is better than LA/SF, BC, NYC; in fact, it is better than the dim sum I had in Hong Kong.  
1) They still use the authentic push carts.
2) It is easy to over season and over salt the food like so many restaurants.  But not at PPP.  It is so refreshing to be delicate and controlled in seasoning.  I don't remember the last time I ate such balanced and light dim sum.  Don't believe me?  try to cook a delicious dish with as little seasoning as possible.  It is difficult.  Somehow PPP managed to do just that.  All the ingredients shine through in an airy melody.   
3) They also have dishes that normally don't show up in other dim sum restaurants.
4) I especially recommend their bbq pork buns and steamed honeycomb tripe.  Shut your eyes and enjoy the texture, subtle flavors and the balance of the whole dish.  
5) try their mango dessert -- real mango pieces and clearly made with real mangos.

572171,2010-12-10,2,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"It's hard to believe, but the best dim sum in Las Vegas is NOT found in our burgeoning (and otherwise excellent) Chinatown district stretching along Spring Mountain Road. Instead, truly ""world-class"" dim sum is to be found in the Ping Pang Pong Restaurant in the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino.

Honest.

From your basic steamed buns & fried rice to more esoteric fare like chicken feet & jellyfish, Ping Pang Pong serves it all.

Situated in the back of the western half of the Gold Coast, it nevertheless has built a reputation for authentic, tasty dim sum, so the lunch crowd is uniformly large. I recommend coming here when you have at least an hour to spend on your midday meal. Dim Sum may be Chinese fast food, but the price of Ping Pang Pong's excellence is crowds.

A note on the authenticity of Ping Pang Pong's cuisine: On several visits, I have been the most caucasian customer seated, and I'm half-filipino. Which brings me to another point: none of the waitstaff here seems to have a firm handle on English, so, although the service has always been excellent, ordering always seems to involve lots of gestures and nodding.

I have a kind of method to my own dim sum madness: I sit down, order some tea (or a beer), and wait for the carts to roll by. And, even if the dessert cart comes first, I start pointing to things that look good. One of my favorite desserts-as-appetizers are sesame balls filled with red bean paste. Another favorite appetizer: a steamed bun filled with a single, spicy Cantonese sausage. But I'm not finicky about what comes first. The point of a dim sum lunch is to enjoy as many different tastes as you can before you're completely topped off. Before long, I typically have as many as a dozen different dishes crowded onto my table.


As the helpful cart-pushers place each dish on your table, they mark your check with a stamp or a pen, indicating how many dishes you ordered & what ""class"" those dishes belong to. As far as I've been able to determine, the least expensive dishes run about 2 dollars while the most expensive run about 5 dollars. Because I am such a pig (ordering not only my favorites, but also anything I've never seen before), my bill is usually about 30 bucks, but you can have a nice, filling lunch for half of that.

The aforementioned jellyfish is light & vinegary, a little crunchy & slightly fishy, perfectly complemented with a splash of chili sauce, and I use it as a palette cleanser between courses. They also do a wonderful little bowl of sausage & egg fried rice. (One of the few dishes -- like the perfectly-fried chicken wings -- that my diehard midwestern Princess feels brave enough to eat.) Unlike most westerners, I am comfortable with the texture of gelatinous food, and Ping Pang Pong offers an incredible serving of spicy beef tendon, slow-cooked with onions and sprinkled with chili flakes.

Other highlights include:

* The rice-noodle rolls, where the gooey white noodles are wrapped around a filling like beef or a crunchy pastry and the whole thing gets bathed in a brothy sauce. The overall texture of the dish is a flavorful jelly filled with bits of chewiness -- again, not a combination one finds in the average American eatery.

* The steamed-chicken & glutinous rice wrapped in a leaf, where the wrap (a lotus leaf? a banana leaf?) effectively stews the mixture of chicken & rice into soupy goodness that's best addressed with a spoon.

* Char-siu ribs, the red spare-ribs that are sweet & chewy awesomeness. I go at these with my bare hands and generally leave the restaurant with a fair amount of the meat still stuck between my teeth.

* Steamed meatballs, either ground beef or pork, mixed with some bits of veggie and wrapped with a thin skin of egg, these are stick-to-your-ribs meaty & delicately spongy, and they absolutely scream for generous dollops of chili sauce.

I could go on, but you get the point. In a city that built the lowbrow end of its culinary reputation on the all-you-can-eat buffet, the dim sum lunch at Ping Pang Pong Restaurant offers a sublime alternative: a cornucopia of flavors at a very reasonable price. And the buffet rolls past your table, instead of you having to get up and walk to it. Talk about convenience.

Anytime you feel like braving the wilds of the Gold Coast to get to dim sum heaven, I'd be happy to meet you there.",waadolhBnW9k2YexoLruLg,7,5,5,nX9zJkWG_GqutkYm-MvLQg

It barely qualifies as dim sum since the dining area is tiny, the only view is of slot machines, there are so few clients since it's so small that the food selection is nearly nil!!  Some of the food is brought on trays since there's barely room for the carts.

I took my wife and in-laws who were born and raised in mainland China and they agree it's nothing special compared to Orchid Gardens although they did like the chicken feet and congee they ate.  I couldn't come up with enough dishes to even eat so we bailed out after a couple of dishes and ate at the buffet instead!!  My wife commented that even the hot sauce was the cheap kind.  None of my favorite ""ribs"" and no Chinese broccoli in sight.  Prices were nothing special and it had zero atmosphere.  All this in spite of the fact that we know one of the servers.  I hate to say it but the service was also marginal.

As an example of my dim sum credentials we checked out two dim sum spots in San Francisco the week before.  How about dim sum for four people including duck for all of $12.50?  This was at the Oriental Tea House in San Leandro.  Great place and not just because the food was cheap.

My Hong Kong-hailing real estate agent was visibly horrified when he found out in casual conversation that my parents and I had not yet been privy to the local dim sum experience at Ping Pang Pong (how is anyone supposed to take me seriously when I say this aloud?) in the Gold Coast casino. So while showing us detailed French doors, luxurious hardwood flooring, and expansive high ceilings, he kept peppering home features with ""shao mai"" and ""cha shao bao."" I was sold - on the food, not the house - so not long after that, it was off to Gold Coast we went. 

The casino is not the most convenient to navigate, but the restaurant sits pretty much smack dab in the middle of it, and that's where my biggest issue with it lay. The restaurant is open to the casino pits with hip-level pillars that whisper, ""Smoky Smokerson! Enter, please."" On the flip side, however, the dim sum is solid.

790268,2008-04-26,2,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Here's the story-- I was in Vegas at a trade show, a colleague had this place recommended to him as 'great Chinese' so we agreed to try it for dinner. I had the opportunity to check out the Yelp reviews beforehand, so I could see that the general consensus was: don't come weekdays, come weekends for dim sum. We came on a Monday night. I'm a somewhat adventurous eater, so I figured, what the heck.

Bad idea. I have to say--- probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I'm a very forgiving person. So I DEFINITELY do not recommend coming for dinner on a weeknight. You can decide for yourself if you want to take the chance that it's so much better on weekends as others have noted.

The story: 3 of us got there about 8, the place was maybe 3/4 full during our visit. We ordered 3 dim sum plates for appetizers. These eventually came out, one at a time, about 15 minutes apart. The dim sum was really tasty, but the slow delivery was a bad omen.

Waitress eventually came back to take our entree orders. Colleague #1 got his entree approx. 30 minutes later. Colleague #2 got his entree approx. 30 minutes after colleague #1. Colleague #3 (me) got his entree approx. 30 minutes after colleague #2.  And I had ordered tofu!! During this hour and a half wait, we asked the waitress several times about our order, and she wandered off and came back with various excuses each time. It was clear the kitchen had forgetten entirely about my order. But even from the time they realized they had forgetten me, it STILL took at least 30 minutes to get the food out to our table.

Horrible. And just to make the night memorable for all, my colleague #2, who had ordered a scallop dish, came down with food poisoning that night which stuck with him for the next several days.

948649,2015-03-18,4,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Today was pretty busy with a line at 6:30pm.  FYI - My folks tell me it's because Gold Coast gives more comps away on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Not long after we were seated, our drink order was taken and then moments later our order.  The food is served family style and comes out when it's ready (which typically doesn't take long.)

Today we ordered lobster ($70), Cantonese Princess Chicken ($14.95), XO green string beans add cod fish ($16.95 - they charge $3 for XO and $5 for the fish), spinach with fermented bean curd ($8.95), and live scallops ($8). 

The lobster was delicious and fresh cooked hong kong style which is sauteed in a ginger scallion sauce chopped in pieces you can easily remove it's shell.  (Pic added) They don't charge by the pound which is weird.  They just charge one flat rate cost.  This lobster was a good two pounds.  Delicious.  Traditional Chinese restaurants will serve their food whole - meaning everything from the head to the tail.  It's considered bad luck to not serve it whole.

This whole chicken is served cold which throws people off.  My friends have told me they'd like it more if it was served hot.  It comes with dried scallops and a ginger and oil dipping sauce which I find myself dunking my chicken in and mixing it with rice.  Yum.

The green string beans is alone $8.25, but I love XO sauce and to add some fresh cod to it was a no-brainer.  This was cooked to perfection with the green beans crisp and the fish was fresh and delicate texture. (Pic added)

The spinach was low in flavor for me.  My folks liked it but they would eat spinach simply steamed.  The spinach itself was fresh, they just didn't add enough ""foo yee"" and when I asked for extra (pic added) and when I tried to mix it with the spinach something wasn't right.  It's unfortunate as you can't reheat spinach very well so the left overs were wasted.

The live scallop comes on a shell with rice noodles.  It's a small portion of two pieces for $8.  My mom likes it but I've had better.  They also have razor clams for $10 for 4 pieces cooked in black bean sauce.  I was first introduced this gem in Hong Kong and the flavor is close here but I shouldn't really compare it when they literally just pulled it out of the water hours ago in HK.

Other items I would recommend is their ma po tofu, gobo beef, lamb with scallions, walnut prawns, and their singapore noodle but add extra curry.

They usually have a house soup they provide complimentary but they didn't today - or maybe we just didn't ask for it.

Sadly, if it wasn't that we come here so often and they know my parents, I think we wouldn't have such great service.  I feel for the people that have to keep flagging down their server or constantly have to ask for more tea or napkins.  I do believe the servers and busboys are trying - I think it's just engrained in our old school culture that this is the way it's suppose to be. sigh.",kVAy8nol_GefMbR7awm5TA,6,4,4,1bax4MYXPKgQB_40dmTJtg
954548,2016-08-18,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Only one experience here but it was so poor that I decided to write this review. Had a room at the resort (Gold Coast) where this restaurant is located. Arrived on a late-evening flight and decided to order takeout. I'm an eggitarian and after looking at the menu, picked the mapo tofu from the ""Veggies and Tofu"" section.

Now I realize that vegetarian and vegan are difficult for oriental cuisines, so on placing my order, I checked with the cashier. Even though the item was listed in the ""Veggies and Tofu"" section. Because belt and suspenders. I asked if the item was vegetarian and she said yes. She seemed to speak decent English so I figured I was safe. Got back to the room and started eating. Less than a minute into it, I bite into something with a chewy, meaty texture. I look closer and it appears to be ground pork or beef. By this time it's close to midnight and I don't have the energy to go back downstairs, complain, and wait for another order. Cashiers and servers should really know the menu items at their restaurants. If they don't, how can they effectively serve their customers?

So I email the casino about my experience and ask them to contact me. That was 3 days ago. Still no email. It is almost industry standard these days to place a ""V"" next to vegetarian items and a ""VG"" next to vegan items. And heart icons for heart-healthy etc. Probably takes 2 minutes to modify the menu with these identifiers.

I am fairly liberal with tipping, so on takeout orders, I pay and tip when I place the order. I want my 3 bucks back.

The vibe is as follows: downtown, somewhere in the middle of a Chinatown - not in Vegas but more of some big port city (like NYC or SF) - duck-in-amidst bustling streets filled with shrimp merchants and trinket salespeople. Yeah- but it IS in Vegas! It's amazing how one can be transported someplace completely different just by a meal. That, of course, occurs when the meal is done right. 

We enjoyed the dim sum, and thank goodness we started going back to the gym. I say this because we had a bit more of a guilt-free attitude as we looked over a packed table filled with our favorite dim sum dishes-all cooked to perfection with rustic Chinese authenticity in mind. 

We started with tofu and shrimp balls, covered in hot peppers. Now, I hate tofu. My wife is very good at encouraging me to try new things, so with a little hesitation, I took a bite. Awesome! I had more, and my wife and I faced off for the last one. She won, however I had some shrimp balls hanging around waiting to be devoured, so all was not lost. We had the skinny noodle chow mein (huge portion....finished it). Amazing! For one thing, it was brought to our table steaming hot. The flavors consisted of aromatic young onion, assorted Chinese vegetables, covered in tasty fried bean sprouts. 

I could write paragraph on top of paragraph in order to describe the amazing tastes of each item we had, but don't have all day. 

I HAVE to mention those sesame balls! DAYUMMM! Not only were they the best ever, but my wife and I went into some sort of weird blissful state as we polished off both plates and washed them down with the yummy Chinese tea. We had to sit there and take it all in before composing ourselves and finally getting the courage to face rows of slots as we made our way back to the car. 

I also must mention the service. The staff was outstanding and kept our water and tea filled. They took the time to explain each dish in detail. 

Oh, and the prices! Cheap! We were probably about $20 in when we were full, but continued into the $45 range for both of us because the food was that good.

They come back and told me it was sold out already, disappointed and couldn't believe they were out in less the. 10 minutes after opening.  

We had ordered Singapore Noodles, which I've never had before so I don't know if it was good or not, but I personally didn't care for the flavor.

We used to make so much fun of this place, because let's face facts... the name sounds very racist. Does anyone know what it means, because I'd like to know.

I had a comp room at Gold Coast, and my usual eateries there are the Buffet (which is alright) or TGI Fridays, or I walk across the street to the Rio Buffet. This trip I decided I had a hankering for Chinese food, but I wasn't brave enough to go down a few blocks to Spring Mountain for the real authentic stuff, so I decided to go to the place we all joked about, Ping Pang Pong.

I was pleasantly surprised.

The service was great! Everyone was smiling with quick, prompt service. They were knowledgeable about their food too. I had the Pineapple Seafood Fried Rice, which had shrimp, scallops, and calamari in it. It was so tasty, and I filled up quite quickly.

I'm not quite sure on the authenticity of the food, I am certainly not the judge on that. But the food was good. Price was a tad high but certainly the food delivered.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,2,1,4,1CpftrtwbctiqPmgF8G53Q

The dim sum dishes are really good. Some favorites: char siu bun, stewed beef offal (pair this with rice porridge with a thousand year egg for maximal enjoyment), and their take on the youtiao (""fried oil stick"")/cheungfun combo, using prawn/shrimp paste as a filler, surrounded by a youtaio-like covering and then the cheung fun wrap mixed with cilantro... that's a killer and my personal favorite.

Hostess was not very welcoming and kept scolding us to stand inside the stanchion and to stay behind the line!  Not the greatest start, but luckily once I started eating, the experience took a 180 turnaround.

Located in the Gold Coast, this little Chinese restaurant serves up some mean dim sum.  So elegantly presented, each simple dim sum item takes Chinese dining to another level.

Delectable roast pork, cooked with a nice crispy layer of skin, thinly sliced and served with shelled boiled peanuts...what?  Who would've thought of that?

Then there was this super light custard made from egg whites served in a bowl and covered with a light pastry puff.  Who said dessert at the end?  We had to start with this popular dish before they ran out!

I kept saying I can't eat another bite and then another cart would come by with another beautiful dish.  They are so smart.  Even if you say no, they always unveil, just to make sure you know what you are saying no to.  Before you know it, one more dish added to our table!

I went there twice on my last trip to Vegas. The first time I got jellyfish and calamari with veggies in a hot sauce (a chef's special). I admit I was drawn to it for its ""weirdness,"" but also to prove to myself that it doesn't matter what you order. If you have an open mind, this place is a foodie adventure. Anyway, this dish was great. I started with the squab and pork lettuce cups, which were a little heavy on the lettuce, but they really didn't skimp on the meat either. Perfect amount of salt and tangy. Again, really good.

My second night there I had the Cantonese sausage fried rice and lamb tenderloin (more along the lines of what I would usually order) and it was very flavorful. Across the board, they do a great job with balancing flavors - hot and sweet, and a little hint of ginger when you are not expecting it. 

Also, you gotta love $3.50 Tsing Tao beer...

Service is a little spotty, but I was dining alone and checking email/Facebook in the gaps, so I got by alright.

I highly recommend this place. Especially if your idea of Chinese food is that it should come out of a cardboard box. This is the kind of place that proves this cuisine can be as good as any other in a sit down restaurant setting.",jL157I6Ye58F56diZZapRA,2,0,5,aq-whNc740GBYRN86UtuvA

I suppose that they get so many people (being in Vegas and all) plus all the Chinese tourists that they can afford to do so.

Their Chow Fun is exceptionally good (I always order it and use it as a judge for Chinese restaurants). They translated it into ""Rice noodle."" This was not as... err... random as their ""Wrinkled Beans..."" It doesn't sound appetizing, but it's name in other restaurants is ""Dry Braised String Beans,"" or something similar. Both of these dishes are good. I also tried their lamb and duck, both were good (if somewhat overpriced).

Their service is pretty good too, considering it could be a lot worse. They serve hot tea automatically like a Chinese restaurant should. Dim sum was kind of slow when I went with only 3 carts and a few waiters with trays (but again, since it was a weekday, that's to be expected).

The super high rating is due to the fact that it is literally in the middle of the casino. It's not some fusion crap that other casinos on the strip sell. Nor is it some Panda Express imitation. Nope. No longer must I take a trip to Chinatown to get my fix.

Did someone say dim sum inside of a casino?! Weird right, but this one is worth a try! It's located off the strip at a casino called Gold Coast, but the drive isn't too far. A parking structure was available so plenty of free parking is provided. When we arrived around 11AM, the wait wasn't long. There were only a couple parties in line. But when we finished, the line was filled with people waiting to eat. So make sure you arrive early! 

I'm that person who can eat dim sum anytime and everyday. So seeing all these carts made me happy! The wait for each one to come around was quick. The restaurant is divided into two sections with ten tables at most. Some of my favorites were the BBQ pork buns, the shrimp ha cao and the egg tarts. I especially liked the crust on them because they were flaky! At other dim sum places, it's usually like a pie crust and I'm not a fan of pie. 

Service here is pretty good. The server always came around just in time to refill our drinks! Our bill for four people came out to be about $80 including tip which isn't too bad.

Ambience - Clean, well lit and noisy like most Dim Sum places.  Open kitchen which is somewhat unusual and a good thing.

Price - Ordered 1 A item and 4 B items plus 2 Tsin Dao beers ($7) for a total lunch of $22.38.

Service - Funny start when they tried to make me take a menu (I'm only part asian so I guess they wanted to make me order ala carte food).  After that it was good.  The hostess seated me right away and the food carts rotate quickly and consistently.  I hardly finished each plate and it was whisked away.  Busboy offered me a second beverage before I had to ask anyone for another.

Food - Excellent selection sorted by food types: baked and fried goods, steamed goods, large sides (like fried rice), dessert and fresh beverage.

Pork Shui Mai - Good flavor but slightly chewy (like a typical chicken texture).

BBQ Pork Bun Baked (Char Sui Bao) - Perfect bun texture and flavor with a tasty glaze coating (your hands will get sticky).  Stuffing of bbq pork was tasty.

Pork Dumpling (gau style not pot sticker) - Must have! great crispy dough contrasts with lightly chewy stuffing.  Lightly sweet flavor is delicate and delicious.

Char Sui Bao steamed - Great flavor but dough wasn't my favorite (stick to the baked ones).

Shrimp dumpling (Har Gau) - Good sized value with sticky wrapper and delicately spiced shrimp filling.  Each one must have at least two 10-12 shrimps in it.

Didn't try the fried rice, dessert cart or the fresh juice cart (soup or beverage?).  They also paraded around an asparagus plate that looked and smelled wonderful but I was too full.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value of this place and would recommend it.  I'm picky about Dim Sum and this place does a decent job on everything I tried and better than average with the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Ha Gau.",u-HGDetumdTWRxecVRkzRg,1,1,5,4uz1SThiUFKa3WaR6FRkXA

You'll find many of the American Chinese classics you know and love like sweet and sour pork, as well as traditional favorites like fish stew. Everything is masterfully prepared to order in an open kitchen.

We arrived at 11am and was seated at 11:40am even with our Emerald card, which gives us priority seating. Many people were in line and some just went to the front of the line to talk to the hostess. Most were confused as to which line to get in. Make sure you give your name and the number in your party to the hostess; she will then give you a piece of paper with a number that she will eventually call out. Most of the people were inpatient and kept going to the hostess and asking her questions. There were several who looked through the reservation book when the hostess stepped away. It was definitely crowded and as soon as we sat down, we started eating.

The food was great! We had the seaweed salad, BBQ pork noodles, shrimp noodles, pork dumpling, shrimp dumpling, spring rolls, crab balls, spare ribs, BBQ pork buns, BBQ pork pastries, Chinese broccoli, chicken wings, sausage in a bun, potstickers, sesame balls - the usual dishes that we order when we have dimsum. What we couldn't believe was the bill! It was $110 for five adults and one child! Then, I looked over the bill and noticed that they charged us twice for the Chinese broccoli ($8.95 twice!). They did correct the bill, but then we started to question whether the rest of the bill was correct. They charged us for 23 dimsum plates, but we didn't keep track and count our plates! They could have easily charged us an extra 2-3 plates and we wouldn't have known it. As regular dimsum customers, with a party of five to ten people that we usually have, we would pay any where from $10 to $15 per person at the most, including tip! But at Ping Pang Pong, we had to pay about $20 per person! Even though the dimsum was good, the higher price is not worth the wait!

Anywho, once seated the service was only a little better. A few times the carts passed without stopping lol. Kind of awkward having to flag them down every time you want something, especially with this style of dinner service. 

On to the food. Great options, yet they didn't have everything I was looking for. Started off with a hot pot of tea and the Chinese broccoli.

The chicken was what was left on the bone after they chopped off the meat to put into other dishes. It was just cooked chicken. The same taste as you could get at Costco, but without the meat. 

The orange chicken was really tough. The worst I have ever had.

Open late hours so when I've come here it has usually been on the later end of the evening. They pretty much have a very traditional Chinese dining menu, but a small bowl of white steamed rice is 50cents which I was surprised with all the entrees we were ordering we were not getting a free bowl of white rice. 

Tonight we had the Kung Pao Chicken, Dry Beef Chow Fun, Salt and Pepper Pork, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Gobo Beef, and seafood mixed Soft Noodles which probably is their fancy name version of lo mein. All the food actually was pretty good.

Kung Pao Chicken - I enjoyed how tender the chicken slices were, and the sauce for this particular dish was just right, right amount of spicy and right amount of sweetness to it. 

Gobo Beef - probably my new favorite dish to order when coming to this restaurant. Small thick cut cubes of beef sirloin, every flavorful and savory taste of beef cubes. could be more on the tender side, but otherwise very tasty.

Beef Chow Fun - average tasting chow fun, a little on the oily side for my liking, but chow fun is my all time favorite chinese food dish, so I normally will order this entree at any chinese restaurant i'm eating at. 

BBQ Pork fried rice - it was a little on the dry side for me, but I guess it's better to be dry than oily. nothing unique or special, pretty standard dish for fried rice

Salt and Pepper pork - a little too much on the salty side

seafood Mixed soft noodles - this name of the entree to me is in no doubt that it's their fancy name for lo mein, very standard display and style of cooking for the seafood lo mein look-alike, 

their hot tea was very very good, but their service overall sucked and some people (the hostess) really have terrible and rude attitudes and I know the customer can sense and see it. slow service, and just overall even if they are understaffed, they dont have to be sour faced or rude about it.

It was nice to be reacquainted with the hustle and bustle of the ladies pushing the carts with nice steamed dumplings, baked pork buns, and deep fried desserts.  

To be honest with you, the dim sum here is good, but I wouldn't say its show stopping. Their Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, or lack there of, was over cooked at the time we were serviced. 

We did stumble upon one of the dim sum plates that I've never had before, it was a shrimp ball rolled in stick rice, and a broth like sauce much like egg drop soup was poured on top.... very delicious, flavorful, and filling. 

As with the other reviewers, they do charge $0.50 for a pot of tea, not so bad.

Despite the abundance of restaurants in Las Vegas, my family and I somehow ended up here for dinner because of its proximity to the bowling tournament that my mother was going to be participating in. I yelped it, saw 3 1/2 stars and thought to myself, ""ok shouldn't be too bad"". Well, it was REALLY BAD. Horrendous service - our waiters seemed to have completely vanished upon taking our orders. Food didn't come until about 30-45 minutes later, and when they did, it was cold. What the f***?!

Entrees we ordered:

Seafood porridge - I asked them to add the preserved egg, which I had been craving. Well, the porridge was bland and I had to keep adding soy sauce to make it better. The preserved egg tasted funky, not at all like what I was used to in LA's Chinatown.
Gobo beef - EW. They were basically big cubes of beef (bigger than bite size, so it was a little hard chewing on them)  that seemed to have been boiled in soy sauce. They also seemed a little bloody.
Salt and pepper pork chops - They were pretty standard. A little bit dry.
Hot braised chicken - This was the only semi-decent dish. But it was basically sweet and sour chicken. 
Shrimp fried rice - This one arrived to the table first, a good 20 minutes before the actual entrees arrived. So it was cold by the time we started eating. Not good.

I didn't try their dimsum; if that's what I wanted, I could've just gone to Chinatown. But this is definitely not a good dinner spot.",RVoeHYQ61x9CJ10hIWqxFw,0,0,1,FFvz9-3oDifuv5parnvkPA

Lack of a genuine greeting  3. Rushed order-taking. 4. Failure to touch the table more than once per dining experiece (cover). Management (on the floor) has not properly addressed these issues & is failing to ensuring any reasonable level of service. I recently noticed 2 or 3 other guests laughing in the restaurant while dining alone. After speaking with a couple of them, I later learned through our conversation that they were loyal customers for many years, but that the service levels are now ""laughable"".

if this review was based on only las vegas dim sum, this would be a 4 star easily. 

the service is TERRIBLE.  i'm chinese and i live in a highly populated asian area and i must say the service is terrible!!!!  they need to hire about 5 more waiters/waitresses to handle all the business on holiday weekends or weekends in general.  they had at least 10 tables complaining and yelling at the manager, and the manager did not say sorry once.  

the food is good for vegas standard, probably the best dim sum you'll ever eat in las vegas.  but compared to dim sum in general, it was just up to par with normal-los angeles dim sum standards, nothing spectacular or special.

price: most items are $2.88 a plate, some (but not many) dishes are $2.18 and then there are some special priced items.

WAIT:  do NOT come here with a big group.  most tables are meant for max 4 people and if u come with 5 person table...expect to wait over an hour without anyone giving you an estimate of how long the wait is.  also, if you have a gold coast member card, you get to cut, thus making the wait for other people even longer.

in short:  best dim sum in vegas, but not worth the terrible service.  just skip dim sum and drive 4 hours to LA for better dim sum.

Got a comp for this place.  Ordered it at 10:50 for to-go; had to go up and play 11PM bingo.  I knew 10 minutes was short but you figure Chinese food doesn't take long to cook.

Lady says ""14 minutes""; of course we think  ""14 minutes"" but I think she meant ""40"".  That's ok though, but my friend did go downstairs to check on our food twice. 

We ordered roast duck, fried rice and pork chop.  Unless you're chasing down Donald Duck and Porky Pig, I think 40 minutes it's more than enough for ""to-go"" food.  My friend who witnessed us ordering saw a family of 5 sit down and leave by the time we came back from bingo an hour later.

So we asked to just eat our food right then and there; I mean, bingo ends at 12am and it was 12:05, 15 min after our food was supposed to be done.  

Grateful to sit and eat we did.
 Minus service.  Had to wait super long before we asked for our check (just happened to be a to be a drink balance of $3...)

Monday night, slow service.  I really don't understand this; what pisses me off is that my food was a comp:  doesn't that mean VIP?  I didn't get my meal for ""free"", so don't treat me like I'm nobody.  I gamble a lot.  I can't rely on feeling ""VIP"" at this place.

Being the crotchety impatient hangry monster that I am and usually only having time for dim sum on weekends, I've mostly avoided Ping Pang Pong so as to not have to go out to the almost-strip and wait in an impossibly long line. 

Fortunately, I was able to try PPP for a quick snack between the 1pm and 3pm bingo sessions. As it was almost time for the kitchen to close, we were seated immediately and swarmed just as quickly with carts of food.  The swarming froze of my girlfriends into a sense of panic, but that eventually faded when the food was ordered and the dim sum-slangin ladies directed their attention elsewhere. 

I was a bit concerned about the quality of the food since we arrived right at about closing time. However, all of the food was delicious. We focused on seafood and vegetarian/vegan items to accommodate a few dietary needs at the table. As I've said time and time again, Asian food is kind to the diet-restricted. 

The egg tarts were outstanding. I haven't had a good one in a while and appreciated how warm and buttery PPP's were. 

This meal was the perfect snack for a group that hadn't eaten lunch who also fully intended to have another round of drinks at the 3pm bingo session.

The prices were very reasonable for most dishes but it depends on what you order of course, which depends on what carts are circulating.  They had quite a large selection of dim sum when I was standing outside waiting in line but very few carts by the time I got in 40 minutes later.  They kept bringing the cart of overpriced specialty dishes and another one with deserts to our table but not the cart of deep fried dishes or buns.  They did bring a cart of steamed dumplings, but then it was 20 - 30 minutes before we saw it again.  Most tables were waiting for carts.  I guess they were loading them up again since we finally saw the missing carts coming out of the kitchen as we were leaving.  Also, several carts are presented when you first sit down, but after that the servers will simply pass your table by.  You have to be aggressive and chase them down unless it's the pricey cart of Chow Mien ($6.50), Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli $9), or fancy prawn dishes..  

Of the food itself, some dishes were really good, most were excessively greasy, and a few were stale.  The bun with egg yolk inside tasted like it was made the day before or unfrozen.  The steamed rice roll/crepe with shrimp inside was very good but the Kalbi ribs were disgusting and inedible.  The chicken feet were very good, but the desert of mochi with black sesame paste filling (Gee Mah?) was cold.  I've never had it served completely cold before.  The egg rolls were fine.  The chewy deep fried mocha/rice balls with ground pork inside were really good and the Shu Mai and Haw Gow were fine.  They need to work on their consistency of food availability and food quality but for the price I allow more than I would at the higher prices of the Las Vegas strip hotels and the crowds speak for themselves.

The wait staff was pleasant to us, but the servers would not lift the containers to show you what was inside and gave very limited explanations.  One guy next to us had to get out of his seat to see what was on the cart and soon began lifting lids too, which is very unsanitary in my opinion.   He shouldn't have had to do that to find out what is offered on a cart.  He also had to get extra napkins for his table and for us.  On the plus side, the hostess didn't argue with us when we refused tea and asked for water instead and we were not charged for tea later on the bill either.",jUwcsxFnqXToqpANCpWJgg,0,0,3,ZJv5bw3VldIOwFjb5IOHKg

The porridge was okay - it was actually kind of bland and I wish I had salt. The Wonton soup was not any better - the noodles were stuck together and the wonton was also very bland. 

So even after trying the food here and knowing its not that good- why would I come back again? Well my dad didn't think it was so bad so the next day he wanted to order the same thing - I really didn't want to but he insisted he wanted to eat porridge - so this time we went to order it for take out again.

This time I experienced the service -- and it was ridiculous - took 45 minutes for two dishes...on top of that the waitress was very unfriendly. The chef didn't even remember to make the porridge until I asked the waitress three times after 30 minutes - and she finally asked the chef - which was just standing around - to make it. It took him less than 5 minutes to make it but I waited 45 minutes for it. Then after that I asked her for an extra spoon and she didn't even want to give it. On top

Definitely not a place I want to go back to. Both the food I tried and the service I experienced was pretty bad. On top of that they were pretty expensive.",nZpSxSHct3faGgonk0nmdw,1,0,1,Le8AC48savSioBxQgb9daA

Location: inside the Gold Coast casino. Parking is free and easy. The only drawbacks about being inside the casino is since this is an old casino, I feel like the air is not well circulated. For that, I'd give 3 out of 5 stars. 

Decor: They finished with the renovation couple months ago. The new place is next to the old one. It's bigger, brighter and more tables. They also have couple booth on the side wall. There is a section in the back to accomodate big parties. Overall, I like the new decor. 

Food: They have shiu may, shrimp dumpling, congee, etc. We started with Crysanthemum flower tea for drinks. For the food, we ordered salt and pepper crispy tofu, lobster ball, chicken feet, sponge cake, special hearty chicken soup and sweet tofu for desert. I thought everything was delicious and tasty, except for the congee. The congee was watery today. I also wish they have a lot more unique dim sum dishes like in HK. One thing to point out, they are now offer fresh fruit and vegetables pressed juice which I love! I'd give 4 out of 5 stars. 

Service is a 5 stars. They refilled our drinks and always checked on us, made sure we had enough food. They also made sure dirty plates were picked up timely so we had room for our upcoming dishes. 

Price: Their prices are reasonable. Even though they are located inside the casino, they are not expensive. I'd give 4 out of 5 stars. It was 4 of us and we spent below $50 before tips.

Ping Pang Pong has been voted one of the best Chinese Restaurant, according to Vegas Magazine and others alike. Nearly 3 years ago, Ping Pang Pong started their Dim Sum and I am wondering why have we only now just discovered this?

The venue is located inside the Gold Coast Casino, small to medium size and the kitchen is open where you can see the chefs prepare and cook the food.  The pros about being in a casino is that they have restrictions in cleanliness and maintain proper cleaning schedule.  Having an open expedition kitchen is a plus, because it's nice to see the chefs prepare the food depending on where you sit.

We had the best of the following, Pork and Shrimp Shumai, Shrimp Dumpling, 2 orders of Sweet  Pork Bun, Dim Sum Noodles, 2 orders  Pork Spare Ribs with black bean sauce, Crab Balls and Tofu with Shrimp paste. 

First of all, every bite and taste of dim sum was so steamy or crunchy fresh that it just dissolved in our mouths! Then the service was fast and consistent with clearing our tables or refilling our beverages. 

Ping Pang Pong is over $1 more than other places, but it is definitely worth the price mark up and hands down the best dim sum in Las Vegas!",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,2,2,5,rH--lUuGTbxkYCer1j9xxw

I don't know, maybe it was the late afternoon and I was just hangry, but I was annoyed at the long wait for everything.

I wish that there was a menu available that we could look for reference as to what the different dishes were and what the price ranges were. The servers were abrupt when we asked what the dishes were, as if, come on, we're in dim sum territory, we should know what the hell we're doing. I felt that the servers took advantage of the fact that we weren't familiar with the language and the cuisine so they kept trying to ply us with every dish on their carts. I felt bad after having to say no very loudly multiple times, but I wasn't about to rack up a ridiculous bill!  Even then, after looking over the bill, I was annoyed that they charged for the tea!

The server talked us out of the Tea Smoked Duck and into the the Crisp Roasted Chicken with Scallions, which turned out to be simply a fairly standard dish, nothing to get excited about. It tasted predominantly of soy sauce and was fairly tender. 

The Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice was the better of the three dishes. It had a nice lingering flavor, and came in a very generous portion. Still not terribly exciting.

What I ordered today: salt and pepper porkchop- was hot, crispy,juicy and had the right amount of salt.

Walnut shrimp: sweet,savory and juicy not too salty like some other places and the shrimp were pretty big this time and the sauce was creamy and not watery like at other places.

Salt and pepper fried tofu: crispy, perfect seasoning and moist inside

Pan fried noodles with beef: the sauce was amazing,thick and there was a good amount of Beef and bok choi.

It took the dim sum cart a really long time to get to our table. The dim sum served on the grill/fried/pastry cart all came out cold... like the eggplant, eggtarts, and this fried dough with minced pork. Very disappointing, especially it was the first time I took my foreign best friend out to try dim sum... bet he didn't have the best impression.

Besides the cold food, the taste of everything else was average to below average... prices are slightly higher than local spots out of the casino.

I came here a couple times, but the first time my cousin took me here. We were both craving dim sum at midnight, so what better place to be, since it closed at 3am?!

I honestly didn't know how legit the dim sum would be so I ordered Mongolian Beef and a cup of rice. I didn't think the portions would be that big, but when I got my beef and looked around the room, I noticed plenty of families eating together... hmm.. FAMILY SIZED PORTIONS! Even better!

I wanted to try a couple of the Dim Sum items, so I ordered the Baked Pork Bun, and HALLELUJAH! This right here, BAKED PORK BUN, is the BIDNIZZZ (business). If you want to try one thing, please let this be it! 

A couple weeks later, I told my friend about my dim sum craving and recommended this place. This time we were actually here for the dim sum. We ordered every single thing off the dim sum menu. Don't worry, there were about 10 or less items all $3 each.  After getting to taste them all, MY TUMMY WAS HAPPY. 

It was then time for dessert, but the server did not notice... We waited and waited, and stared into the sky, hoping they would acknowledge us. & they finally did! 30 minutes later... Thank goodness the egg custard dessert was BOMB.ORG, because it slightly made up for the time lost!

Gold Coast Casino towards the back wall. We came at about 2 pm on a Monday (Memorial Day) and there was still a long line (about 15 minutes). Get here early, they close at 3, but it looks like they stop making fresh dim sum at 2 pm. The carts had slim pickings and a lot of things they didn't have anymore, such as the shrimp noodle rolls. 

I knocked a star off for the bad service here. The service was extremely slow and rude. After we were seated, no one introduced themselves to us as our server, so we didn't even know who our server was the entire time. Our drink order wasn't taken and tea wasn't brought to us until about 15 minutes after being seated and us having to flag someone down. They don't refill drinks here and they never made eye contact, so I was constantly waving my hand in the air to call someone, anyone over. 

Surprisingly, most of the dim sum here was great! 

BBQ pork buns - We loved the bbq pork buns, they make a great one here. The moist fluffy bao buns (the white ones that look like clouds) were stuffed generously with moist and tender bbq pork. 5/5

Chicken Feet - whoever butchered the feet, didn't do a good job and there were tiny shards of bone throughout. My boyfriend almost swallowed a couple of small shards. 1/5

Shumai (pork dumpling) - small, but they were moist, flavorful and had a nice texture. 5/5

Har gow (clear shrimp dumpling) - these were also small, but I loved these! Great flavor on the shrimp filling and the clear wrapping was delicate and had a perfect texture. We ordered 2 rounds of them. 5/5

Fried shrimp patty on sugar cane - comes with a sweet mayo sauce. The shrimp ball was very flavorful and went perfect with the mayo sauce. 5/5

Shrimp and vegetable meatball coated in sticky rice - I didn't like the doughy sticky rice on the outside. Also the filling's texture was odd with the soft shrimp ball and chewy bits of vegetable. 1/5

We also ordered a plate of stir fried beef chow mein noodles because we were all still hungry and they barely had anymore dim sum by 2:30 pm. The chow mein noodles were really bland. The beef was tender, but we all couldn't get past on the taste of the chow mein, it was lacking so much! 1/5

At the sound of duck, my 4 year old will pounce for the legs and happily sit there for the next 10 minutes nibbling at them.

Since we weren't getting full off of dim sum, we decided to order some food off the menu (fried rice, noodles, and string beans), though it did take us a long time to order since nobody came by our table. When we got our noodles, they were very oily. The rice and string beans was mediocre, nothing to rave about. When we got our bill, we were surprised at the total.

I have been eating dim sum all my life, and all of the places (Portland, Seattle, Vanc BC) I have been do not charge for tea. That is BS.

But if you want some additional information- 
Ever notice how pork belly dishes always seem to skimp on the actual pork belly? Well not here. You get a huge hunk of delicious, crispy skin pork belly that will alter your perception on pork belly for life.  
I ordered a few other things and they were really good but in the presence of that belly they just couldn't be the star.
Out of a 5 day trip to Vegas & San Francisco THIS is the meal i cant stop thinking about. The Cantonese Pork Belly is what will bring me back to Vegas sooner than later.

We were seated within 10 minutes. They have your typical dim sum eats (shu mai, Har gao, sesame balls, baos, etc.) and the food alone was a solid 4 stars. But service was incredibly horrible, and staff incredibly rude so minus 2 stars. 

They seated us in a section away from the main dining tables, so the carts were rarely seen in our section. The 5 main carts being pushed around only passed us maybe 2x in the hour and a half we were there. 

Bottom line, if you don't have the luxury of time or blessed with the ability to be patient when you're starving, don't come. If you do come, try to show up early, and try to be seated in the main dining area where the carts like to pass you 10x more than the other area that is blocked off by a wall.

Sorry, but I'm from LA, and the cost of dim sum there is about 1/2 with even better food, and just as bad service lol. But I guess for Vegas quality dim sum, this is one of the ""better"" options.

He explained that while he was new to the area having recently relocated from LA he recommended the spot over in the Gold Coast. That spot is Ping Pang Pong.

Sadly I got there a little late and yes there was a wait so the dim sum offerings were scant. I was told that they have dim sum all day, but by 3 there were only 5 items left. I was there with two dim sum neophytes. In the light of all of my enthusiasm they found the offerings underwhelming and ordered off of the regular menu. The spare ribs were some of the best I've ever had. In fact we got two orders. The sesame seed balls were different from the ones I've had on the East Coast but I liked them. In fact, the remaining two items I ordered were different but not bad. I'm giving this restaurant a 3 because I believe I wouldn't have been underwhelmed if I'd had more to choose from.

So service and ambiance are just plusses for me, not a breaking point. BUT I HATE PING PANG PONG! I shrugged off the name and got ready with my friends to eat some recommended dim sum. It was in the middle of a casino, so it was extremely noisy and it smelled like cigarette smoke, but again, I was willing to overlook it for some good dim sum. First, there is no clear set way for me to get a table. At a typical dim sum place, you go up to a hostess, and you get a number, so I get ready to go up to the hostess, but there is a line blocked off in front of her. So I go and wait in line, the line does not move an inch for 20 minutes. So I think I must get a number and then stand in line. I approach the hostess again, and ask her politely in Cantonese, could I get a number for a table of 6. She proceeds to b*tch at me and say that I need to stand in line, so I start to walk away, and then she goes wait do you have a number, and I said no so she haughtily hands me the number. Completely un-phased, I ask how long would the wait be, she looks at me incredulously, like I am some sort of infant, and rudely tells me this place is very busy and there is no possible way for her to even approximate a wait and could I stand aside I was blocking her table. I hear people all around me asking the same question and everyone getting the same crappy answer to the point all, but two tables stayed to wait. Being a b*tch is inexcusable. I have eaten dim sum in Hong Kong where people get up and line up in front of the carts for dim sum and its the way it is over there. This place seemed to be conflicted whether or not it wanted to be a free-for-all or a place that carefully lines up and due to this confusion, NO ONE was getting served.",upCM15Y3YQoWNc7UXo_QhQ,2,2,1,EnxeMc5vzf9hh3I6Oenl4g

It took a chat with the manager for us to finally get some Shu Mai that looked like it was under a heat lamp for an hour. I posted a picture of it so you can see for yourself. 

At dim sum places you usually have to be patient and go with the flow as barely controlled chaos is how they get things done. Usually, the experience is fun and more than satisfying.

There was no bean curd, no shrimp balls, no shrimp rice noodles. I think part of the hustle of dim sum is selling as much as you can. I also thing the card that they use to stamp leaves a lot of room for counting errors. It was just a blank space with stamps all over the place. When you have two tables of ten, it can  get very dense with stamps. The taste of the food was nothing beyond any dim sum place in my opinion.

I am always the only caucasian person here but I don't care. I love ethnic food especially dim sum which I was not able to get back east unless I traveled to Boston's Chinatown. I did not do this at all. 

I always opt to sit at their dining island which over looks the action in the kitchen. It's like watching a show. Very entertaining. Always 3 cooks manning the hot woks and 2 guys pumping out different types of dim sum. I flag down the cart pushers and they stop. I have never tried any of the crazy stuff like chicken feet or squid. I know what I like and i go for it hard. 

I usually end up getting lo mai gai, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf. This is simple and good. Little bits of chinese sausage in the rice. I order the pan fried pot stickers which are juicy and hot. Shu mai are made with pork and shrimp. Har gow are shrimp dumplings. Shrimp and scallion cakes are pan fried. Bbq pork buns are fluffy.

Everything is served small plate style perfect for sharing. And everything is very inexpensive. I think like $2.35 per dish. I have not tried anything off their full menu but i'm sure it delicious.

It was a bit tough to find, but that's expected with most restaurants in Vegas hotels. Let's skip the details and just go straight to the food:

- King Du Pork Chops: Very tender for pork, but tasted a lot like orange chicken, minus the chicken part. Pretty good dish overall if you like that Panda Express takeout taste.

- Walnut Prawns: Somehow every place I go to has their own spin on walnut prawns which makes them unique. Here, the batter was very thin, which is always good. Who wants to be eating more dough than shrimp? The shrimp themselves were quite large and the sauce not too sweet. One of the best walnut shrimps I've had.

- Lamb Stew: Definitely not what I expected, especially for the price. This basically consisted of broth with vegetables and pieces of stewed lamb, for about $20. The lamb itself was nothing too special, and neither was the entire dish. If I took some time, I could easily make this at home.

-  Tofu: I forgot which dish this was, but look at the pictures if you want a better idea. This was a pretty typical tofu dish that our veggie friend typically orders. It was full of flavour from the sauce, not too spicy, and done just right.

- Hot and Sour Soup: Also pretty typical, although I feel like they made it too sour. I love the consistency of this soup, which they got just right, but everything else was just so-so.

-  Veggie Noodles: I hate noodles that are way too fat, which is what you get typical takeout places. This, however, was the complete opposite. Nicely sized noodles, lots of veggies, and cooked well. Not much else to comment on.

- Gobo Beef: This was definitely the highlight of the night. The dish contained probably the softest beef I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. It pretty much melted in my mouth, and the sauce just made it that much better. This is a must have if you come here.

Overall, all of the dishes were pretty typical of a Chinese restaurant, with the exception of Gobo Beef. I'm sure there are better and more authentic Chinese places in Vegas, but this place was a pretty pleasant surprise in the overcrowded Vegas restaurant scene.",1yv6GXttiII_-od7HaUcfA,2,0,3,4FWWzf8E4XZKqsQRfgTTJg

Dim sum in Vegas?  Okay!!! :D 

This restaurant is off the strip at the Gold Coast Casino.  The restaurant itself is on the actual casino floor with kind of limited seating so expect to wait unless you're lucky.  

Overall the dim sum is pretty standard when it comes to dim sum, couldn't complain in the taste or MSG overdose afterwards.  I just don't remember if they had my favorite chili paste Sambal Oelek there or not, they may might have had the regular chili oil, which IMO is not the freaking same!  (So if any Asian restaurant owners/managers are reading this please read carefully....Sambal Oelek chili paste can not be substituted with chili oil or any other brand!  Damnamit.)  

Although....one thing that I did enjoy over here specifically was their jellyfish during dim sum hours.  Idk, either the places I go to don't offer jellyfish at dim sum or I just barely missed the very last portion to some lucky sonofabitch.  :/  Other than the jellyfish, their name 'Ping Pang Pong' and that its in Vegas... nothing really stands out to me as I can have the same at any one of the numerous dim sum restaurants in Cali.  Nice place to check out nonetheless if you suddenly have a craving attack for dim sum and the 'Asian' foods at the buffets aren't satiating that craving.",Jmx3acL7JIgB3vY2qrQNWA,1,1,3,ku-tU7ubXEoTY8jLblvlsw

The rice was flavorful, but there was no ginger, barely any mushrooms, and a lot of bony chicken scraps.  You can also have a Heineken here for $3.50.  Overall, ok for the price, but I suspect it can probably be a better place than what we experienced.

3077122,2011-01-05,4,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Having given up on Dim Sum upon my move to Las Vegas six years ago, I had done all my mourning of not being able to drive to Monterey Park from West LA for a Sunday post-clubbing ritual.  I was not expecting much when I arrived at Ping Pang Pong this past weekend, but began to fan little fires of hopes when I saw a restaurant filled with Chinese people and outfitted with a long line also filled with Chinese people.

When they served us a steaming pot of Chinese red tea (forget the stereotypical Jasmine green), my hopes went from little flames to a pretty sizable campfire.  When the cart arrived and I had to explain to the Chinese cart-tender lady what I was looking for since she only spoke marginal English, I felt like I traveled through space and was suddenly in Arcadia.  

My favorites, Siu Mai and Har Gow, more than passed the test.  Siu Mai was surprisingly topped with fish eggs, which added a much-welcomed dynamic in texture.  Har Gow was delicious due to fresh shrimp fillings and a properly-made dough that didn't dry up after five minutes on the cart like the other Vegas Dim Sum joints.  My new adventure, Rice Paper-Wrapped Youtiao (Chinese fried bread stick) filled with Pork, was a perfect combination of tastes, textures, and ingredients. 

Our late arrival cost me my Dim Sum must-have: egg tarts; which provides me with a good reason to come back and visit this Sunday.  In the future, I will no longer avoid restaurants that are in funky casinos like the Gold Coast.

Wow! Can't believe it's almost a year since the first time I found out about this place through a friend. This time around, we made sure this was the first stop we made in LV to satisfy our huge appetite. Warning: get here early to avoid the long lines of people trying to get some shrimp balls. 
As soon as the host directs you to your seat, be prepared to be asked if you're interested with plate after plate of dim sum & other Chinese concoctions. Items are not priced the same, obviously, so it's a guessing game how much they will charge you at the end of your meal (although they do stamp your order summary with some item/menu codes like in other dim sum places) but it really doesn't matter because the food is good any time of the day. Try the almond coated shrimp & shrimp balls on green bell pepper with black bean sauce with any of their special fried rice. The flavor lingers in your mouth like white on rice. Lol, rice coz I'm Asian. Lots of yummy things here & there; yummy things are everywhere! Order a glass of Thai iced tea or some hot tea to wash out the after taste. Sesame balls are always good to close out a filling meal. Got my full meal, & I was one satisfied customer.",aUgZIV-T_C6id9cZPkTHVA,1,0,4,lDBB3v9uUYTM29alqu2sjA

We tried to get here by 9:45am so we could get in for the first seating at 10, but unfortunately we missed it so needed to wait 45 min or so as groups started to leave. And there continued to be a long line. 

Haha, I'm impressed by the efficient design!
The tables are arranged in a circle so that carts can go around to the tables and then replenish at the kitchen. Unfortunately since we were at the beginning of the second seating, there weren't many items we often like (chicken feet, har gao, siu mai) since they ran out. Fortunately, we got them as we were finishing up.

I really enjoyed something that seemed like shrimp tempura wrapped in funn. It was delicious! I also liked the eggplant shrimp (generous amount of shrimp inside) and roast pork. I also love gailan, and I appreciated that the sauce was on the side so I could control how salty I wanted it.

The baked char siu bao could've been softer, though, and filled with more meat. The butter buns were filled with lots of butter, though they could have been warmer and softer.

The service was generally good and some of the servers even smiled. If you're family with dim sum restaurants, you know that's rare.

I came here on a week night at about 6pm looking for some good Chinese food.  Ping Pang Pong is located in the Gold Coast so I expected the price to be a bit higher than normal but was actually pleased as it was very consistent with other sit-down Chinese restaurants in town.  

The portions are very big here and very fresh.  They are known for their dim sum so I had to at least try some of their dinner dim sum to give a true review.  I had the pork buns dim sum, lettuce cups, and BBQ pork ribs.  Add in a few drinks and the bill came out to $44 after tax.  The pork bun was just eh.  I usually like the steamed bun but this came with a dessert-type of crust which caught me off guard.  Tasty innards, but not much going on in the way of a dish.  The lettuce cups were quite tasty and I actually recommend them as a nice appetizer.  Finally, the BBQ ribs were average - still can't find an authentic Chinese BBQ char siu in town.  The meat was good but not much flavor.  And the bone was so large that there wasn't much meat on each cutlet (though there were many ribs on the plate).  The dish came with some boiled peanuts which were a nice addition to the meal.  

Service was all over the place.  I'm not sure if it was busy or what but the waitress would disappear and then show up and take 6 orders before returning to the kitchen.  So your order wouldn't be placed immediately, rather you have to wait until her rounds were up.  Very weird way of doing business but the food came out quickly and we were in and out quickly after just waiting a long time to place the order.

Ping Pang Pong is good Chinese food.  I prefer local when trying Asian cuisine in this town so I won't be back, but if you are staying at Gold Coast or nearby and don't have a car, and are craving non-American Chinese, then give this location a try.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,Ih6-nbtNRcaN7kLW7otnPA

But then again maybe they are catering to a different crowd. What really struck me as weird was the fact the place was full of asians!

Seabass hotpot: this is a hit or miss. Sometimes the seabass is awesomely delicious and sometimes I wonder if it is the same dish I ordered the last time. Overall, it's our favorite thing to order on the menu.

Shrimp fried rice: it's nearly impossible to mess up fried rice unless you tried really hard. In this case, you would dishona our famiry!!! The shrimp is big and not the small wimpy dried ones a lot of the other places give. Can't go wrong if you want a rice dish.

Roasted duck: the skin is gooey, not crispy as I want it. There is very little meat on it. I was a bit disappointed in this one..

Chow fun (dry): this dish is like Asian spaghetti. I like the fresh sprouts that they use and the noodles are always delicious.

Tomato onion scallops: yuck! I love scallops and decided to order this for the first time. There was so much sweet and sour dressing on it, it was like drinking that thing. Ugh... I expected it to be fried scallops with fresh tomatoes and onions, but i guess I was wrong on this dish. Just thinking about this dish gives me horrible flashbacks and makes me want to gag. No beuno!!!!

Service: usually really quick, but a few times we waited forever or they forgot our order.. The price is fairly cheap for the amount of food you get. I noticed that you get so much more food if you take it to go than eating there. :)",Tjuwm4XdQjlmGdKVgEHx-A,0,0,4,nk5fRwMKScm2F9pPvXWCmw

It took them one hour 10 minutes for s fried rice, noodle dish, and some pork buns. People who sat down were done and walking around the casino faster. Other people got thier to go orders faster. The food it tight, but the service lacks. I regret leaving a tip. They sure did not earn it.

Edit: when I got home the food was worse. Chicken fried rice was undercooked, looked like it had boilednl chicken in it, the pork buns were odd. They had sugar cookies baked into the tops?

We tried to call and make reservations beforehand because some of the reviews talked about having to wait a long time. However they only accept reservations for parties of 10 or more. For a group of 3, we only had to wait about 10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon.

The interior of the restaurant is clean, spacious, and looks new. Once we got seated, there were immediately 3 carts that came by, so we were able to get food right away. The carts consistently came by our table so we never had to chase anyone down for food. Tea is $1 per person. The food is great here, however the dishes are a little bit more expensive for dim sum. For example, we got a plate of egg tarts which cost $4.88 per plate. And the egg tarts had 2 per plate instead of 3.

Recommendations: 
Chive and shrimp cake -- surprisingly crisp and fresh with plenty of shrimp. 
Crispy shrimp stuffed chicken -- this was amazing. While it feels a bit like Americanized Chinese food, the meat was tender and had a light coating with a sweet garlic-based sauce and sesame seeds
Night market Fried Rice -- Strong basil flavor, tomato based sauce. Unique and definitely different from any fried rice I've had.
Yu Hong (Yu xiang) Eggplant -- pretty typical rendition of this sweet and sour eggplant dish, nothing too unusual...  this dish needs white rice on the side. 

Cons: 
Based on the menu, it's on the pricey side for what it is.

Then, a team member states she will notify the front that I'm waiting to place my order.  Well, honestly, I don't think that happened because I took the initiative to go to the front team members and indicate that I'd like to place a to go order.  She gives me a menu that indicates dim sum associated with letters.  Then, I ask what do these letters indicate?  After, she hands me another menu with pictures and numbers.  I ask her how does this work?  Then, I asked the other lady at the front how do I know how much the dim sum with the numbers cost?  She indicates that the menu with the dim sum and letters are invalid.  So, the menu with the pics and numbers, how do I know how much the items cost?  She mentions oh just ask me.  

What?  In other words, you could rip me off with no basis?  

Total wait time + ordering + verifying the menu, prices, etc. = ~45min.  

With that said, I highly recommend a revised dim sum menu with correct prices displayed for the customers' and establishments' maximum efficiency, time, ease, respect, and ethics in food service management.  

Plus, I recommend more staff training accommodating those waiting to dine in, to go, and pay their bill because after observing this establishment while waiting for to go service, it seemed like there was a lack of communication between team members that was very obvious, no team work, and lack of organization.

My biggest complaint? Because we arrived so early, they seemed to only have desserts ready & those kept coming around quite readily in the beginning. They didn't seem to start bringing out the savory dishes til about 15-20 minutes after they opened.
My recommendations? If you arrive early, be patient & wait about 20 minutes til the dishes really start coming out. If not, then show up about 30 minutes after they open, just be prepared to wait.
The challenge? Their Servers are all Chinese, which is great, however with all of the noise, hearing them through the noise & their accents was a challenge.

The wait in the line to get a table and seating is not bothersome as watching the activity in the restaurant and seeing the Chinese cooks in their crisp white chef garbs before chinese woks and hot fire, all viewable in the open cooking area. These Chinese cooks whip up authentic Chinese menu! The food servers there to serve and aid in choosing from the menu and answer meal questions. Authentic Chinese cuisine, in that it is not Americanized Chinese food. From seafood, to vegetables, soups, main meat meals and dessert, it could never been any less filling. Best recommendation is to try each and every entree in the menu. In as much as I return dining in this restaurant located inside the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino of the west side of Entertainment City, I have a constant pick which you may want to try. For starters, savor the taste of Savory Minced Squab and Pork Tenderloin (served with hoisin sauce). A Provincial favorite dish is Double-Braised Scallop Hot Pot (whole seared scallops simmering in garlic oyster sauce served in a sealed clay pot) which is just tasteful. A favorite dish is the Singapore Rice Noodles with a taste of curry that reminds me definitely of SIngapore (with vermicelli. shrimp, BBQ pork, onions). Serve me Duck and it sticks in my palate even after it's off the plate into the tummy filling: Plum-Orange Braised Leg of Duck or the Cantonese Roast Duck (Half). The Lobster and Vermicelli Clay Pot steaming in broth, or the Emperor's Seafood Stew (sun-dried abalone, fish maw with supreme sea cucumber all simmered in flavorful broth) or the Manila Clams with Black Bean Sauce definitely sends me to seafood heaven. Develop a taste for the very appetizingly filling Clay Pot & Congee meals is a definite choice: Ginger Mushroom Chicken Rice or the Sausage Duck Confit Rice. For Rice dishes, I always order Cantonese Curry Beef Brisket Stew, or the Chow Fried Rice (with BBQ pork, green onions and shrimp), or the spicy Night Market Fried Rice (with sliced beef, fresh Thai chilies, diced tomatoes, bean sprouts), or Fu Chow Fried Rice (mixed seafood sautéed in a light scallion gravy) or the Pineapple Seafood Fried Rice (which reminds me of being in the islands). A vegetable favorite is Sautéed Lotus Root (thinly sliced in an sweet and pungent sauce), or the Snow Pea Leaves with Roasted Garlic. Highly recommend ""Dim Sum"" as it is for me the best bang for your bucks in this entertainment city! A wide array presented in rolling carts pushed around by chinese-garbed food servers all too willing for passing it on to your table from the dim sum cart. Ready for small eats that leaves you wanting more, go Dim Sum! Dim Sum dining is at lunch time. As I have experienced dining here as often as possible, see for yourself why it's been voted many times as ""one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in America"" by Travel + Leisure magazine and ""Best Asian Restaurant in Las Vegas"" by readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal!

When we do go out or get take-out however, it's always from 'Ping Pang Pong' (still don't understand the logic of this name choice..). He always raves how this is a really good Chinese restaurant and they cook their dishes with all the right ingredients and proportions. The pricing is very suitable too. You would assume being inside a casino, they would charge more than the actual dish is worth, but the price range is about $6-8 for a good portion of food per dish. 

My dad would be the one to know all the technical stuff with what is a good quality Chinese dish and bad quality. The reason why I know this restaurant really lives up to the 'Best Chinese Restaurant' awards plastered around the entrance is because the traffic that I have seen come in and out of this restaurant, and the number of to-go orders that are bunched up on their large counter space everytime I am here. It's ridiculous! We've had to wait a good 45 minutes for our to-go order (3 dishes) to come out, so my advice is if you're looking for some take-out.. make sure you order way ahead of time of when you expect to actually eat.

Had dimsum the other day and they don't have a wide variety of options but for what they do have, it's superb quality in my opinion! Really loved their turnip cake. Best I've ever had!

Never once was I presented a menu, so I literally had a appetizer lunch with no menu  at all, I have never felt so bamboozled & unsatisfied in Chinese food history. LET ME TELL YOU, a bad review from me is very rare, as a matter a fact? This is my first! I hate this place now & I will never recommend this terrible customer service to anybody. 

Also, the manager at the time still wanted me to pay the full price for all the crappy little appetizers that were basically forced upon me.

We tried this place because they advertised on their billboards how their restaurant won all these awards and they were right across the street from our hotel (the palms). The food is definitely authentic tasting, but it was very salty for my liking.

The black bean chicken was recommended by the manager waiting on us, and it was a bad a call. Sounded good, but it turned out not to be so great. Nonetheless when we ate all three items together the food didn't taste so bad.

Still, its definitely not AWARD winning like they paint themselves to be. I wouldn't mind eating here again: as long as I order something different.

I think our biggest mistake was ordering the fried rice. If we had white rice instead, and ordered two other meat dishes other than the black bean chicken it would have been fine.

Maybe i'll do that next time.

We ordered a dish off the chefs special menu which was mushrooms, bamboo and sausage. When it arrived there was no sausage. When we flagged down the waitress after some confusion she devised the story that the translation of sausage was asparagus. So she did not say sorry and come back with the sausage she instead insults our meager intelligence. I'd like to point out that one side of menu is written in Chinese characters then in English on other side. So even if there was some regional dialect in which the word sausage somehow meant asparagus, it feels ludicrous to even type that, then why would the English translation say ""sausage""? The explanation itself made no sense not to mention this type of confusion would happen 12x a night if that were the case. What kind of maniac would just automatically assume sausage actually meant asparagus? The mere man hours involved in handling all the complaints would require a quick menu revision. ANYWAY, since it was so tasty we overlooked it but I'm fairly sure not everyone would just be cool with such a dumb explanation, non apology.

I always thought the food here was good, but my big complaints about the old location were the terrible service and the invasive cigarette smoke that used to get drawn into the old restaurant. The new location of the restaurant seems to have mitigated both problems, as the tables are now set back much further from the casino floor and the better ""flow"" of the floor layout means that the servers can move around more easily and thus more quickly.

I also thought the servers were friendlier than before, but tough to draw a conclusion from just one visit. I'll update my review after some more visits and if the service remains improved, I think this could be a 5*.

As I mentioned, I always thought the food here was top notch and that hasn't changed. I did try one new dish, the jellyfish and roast duck with asparagus stir-fry in xo sauce, and that was killer. Old staples like the dragon well shrimp, lamb stew hotpot, and XO calamari with lotus root are exactly the same as I remember.

We ordered three dishes to share:  The Singapore rice noodles were excellent.  There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was very good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.  

Service was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.  

The one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.

I do like the place and I will be back if only for the Singapore noodles.  That was my highlight of the meal!

Service is terrible. Servers here are slower than a turtle. However, I do want to talk about their cleaning guys (two brothers). They clean dirty dishes and wipe tables like there's no tomorrow. Holy moly. They could easily win 1st place at table cleaning contest if there's such thing. It's worth watching them while your servers takes her sweet time getting your orders.

FOOD
Some of my favorites that I get every time:

Sea Bass Hot Pot ($19.95)- it's one of their secret menu. Mainly tofu and fried sea bass with lots of garlic. Little bit pricey but worth it. Yum yum.

Walnut Prawns ($13.95)- fried shrimp with sesame mayonnaise and honey-glazed walnuts. It's the ultimate fatty dish with lots of cholesterol but it's so dang good. 

Tea Smoked Duck ($16.95)- roasted duck in a wrap with boison sauce on the side. I can eat this everyday!

Chicken with Black Bean Sauce ($9.95)- goes well with a bowl of white rice 

Shanghai Noodles ($7.95)- stir-fried Napa cabbage, mushrooms, spinach and pork

Singapore Rice Noodles ($9.95)- noodles with light curry flavor. 

Garlic Bok Choy- Always ask for extra garlic!

Last but most definitely not least, thier mango pudding. Comes with creamer on the side. They make fresh mango pudding here and it is the most flavorful and refreshing dessert. My family of 3 always order about 10 of these LOL

4016819,2011-12-12,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Ping Pang Pong is definitely one of my top choices for dim sum here in Vegas.  

First, the restaurant is small so it doesn't take too terribly long for the carts to circulate and deliver piping hot dim sum foods to you!  I am not a fan of luke warm dim sum.  This is often a problem when a place isn't busy and things circulate for too long or when a place is too big and the carts have travel vast distances from kitchen to patron.  

They offer all of my faves like chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, baked char shiu bau (sp?), shrimp and chive nuggets, crab balls, chow fun, shiu mai (sp?).  OK, OK I admit I have absolutely no idea how to name or spell most of the hot tiny treasures but I love to eat them!  One complaint here at ping pang pong, is that they serve the oyster sauce on the side of the chinese broccoli....I must prefer a heart drizzle evenly over the top.  

They are friendlier than most but still the service is abrupt, semi-angry, and without any normal pleasantries.  This is to be expected from most Chinese establishments, especially dim sum.  But the attitude adds to the experience if you ask me!  

If it is your first crack at dim sum, this may be the best place to try it.  The ladies pushing the carts even explained what was in some of the items!  Revolutionary.

Food: The food was good but it was nothing special. The only thing I thought was really good was the steamed bbq pork buns which were really moist. Only thing was that they stuck to the paper and fell apart a bit. There was a decent selection of dim sum but not that many. The shimp dumplings and shrimp rice rolls were not very flavorful.

Service: Not the best dim sum service I have had. The carts took a while to come by and some carts came by more times than others. I had to grab the servers' attention to get drink order refills.

Price. A lot pricier than the other dim sum places I have been. I paid $45 for food that would usually cost 26 to 35 elsewhere.

I am just a regular, non-ethnic white girl. I cannot eat the food that they actually eat in Japan and China.

A soup that is served with a huge bone in it with tiny scraps of meat and fat clinging to it does not look appetizing. In the spirit of adventure, I ate a few bites of everything, and it wasn't disgusting or anything, just meh.

In fairness, Ping Pang Pong also has some of the traditional American-y dishes you can get at your local Chinese takeout, but we were looking to branch out and try some new things. I'm not upset with the restaurant - I'm sure this is excellent preparation of Princess Chicken or Salt & Pepper Porkchops - they just aren't for me.

We also tried the singapore noodles, which were kinda like your standard Lo Mein, and some fried rice, which I thought was really good. Our final order was the wrinkled green beans, and they were also good. Overall, we mostly stuck to the noodles and the rice.

Yay! It's hella Chinesey up in here!

Normally you can judge how good an Asian restaurant is by the amount of native diners. Vegas is no exception.

Ping Pang Pong came as a recommendation from my friend who lives in Vegas but he did warn me it's not nearly as good as the dim sum in SF.. 

On Sunday, 9.11.11, my friends and I came to PPP at 1 PM. It was about a 15 minute wait for a party of 7. The FIRST thing I noticed was the overwhelming amount of Mandarin and Cantonese speaking patrons; seemed promising.

FOOD
Ladies push around dim sum carts and call out the dishes in Cantonese. They are more than happy to show you what's inside the steamers if you don't understand Cantonese.

We ordered the following (some in doubles):
*Hai Gow (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings)
*Siu Mai (Steamed Pork Dumplings)
*Hai and Char Siu Cheung Fun (Steamed Shrimp and BBQ Pork Noodle Rolls)
*Fung Zhao (Steamed Chicken Feet)
*Ngau Yuk Mai (Steamed Beef Balls)
*Jiaozi (Potstickers)
*Deep Fried Shrimp Balls
*Paai Gwaat (Steamed Spare Ribs)
*Ngau Toa (Steamed Tripe)
*Fu Pei Guen (Steamed Tofu Skin Roll)
*Lo Mai Gai (Steamed Glutinous Rice w/ Chicken in Lotus Leaf Wrap)
*Jin Deui (Fried Sesame Balls)
*Char Siu Chow Fan (BBQ Pork Fried Rice)

The only standout dishes was the steamed tripe which was melt-in-your-mouth soft and the fried rice which was al-dente which bits of rich fatty pieces of pork (albeit a bit greasy).  The rest of the dishes were mediocre; they either lacked quality ingredients, were tiny (dumplings) compared to the norm and/or on the dry side. But when you're starving and there's a lack of good dim sum options, it sufficed just fine.

S E R V I C E
Perhaps, I'm so use to rude service at Asian restaurants that I didn't find the service at PPP even the slight bit rude. Our waiter brought things quickly when we asked for it and refilled our waters promptly. This in itself is already a rarity in most Chinese restaurants.
 
A M B I A N C E / D E C O R
With a name like Ping Pang Pong, it's no wonder that it excudes the typical stereotypical décor of Chinese village roof shingles, red paper lanterns and waitstaff in mandarin collared outfits. Most importantly, It was CLEAN!

With a plethora of dim sum restaurants in San Francisco, PPP would probably rank a 2.5-3 STARS in SF. However, considering Vegas has a scant amount of decent Asian restaurants and we left stuffed for only $15/person (including tip) they do deserve a better than average rating.",eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg,10,5,4,x-Awy6EsRQ0ILIW0zblJjg

She shut up when I called her out on it as I have owned a Chinese restaurant before and knew what goes into making sweet and sour pork. I would've rather she just say I'm sorry we fucked up, it's coming right up. Never try and make lame excuses to the customer.

We came on a Saturday morning, and at the stroke of 10, when they open, a number of tables were already filled.  They have the standard dishes, including two types of jook.  We left probably an hour or so later, and the same carts had rotated around several times.  There were a couple of dishes brought around on trays.  The variety isn't very large, but I liked it better than Five Star Seafood (fka New Capital) in Monterey Park.

4105011,2010-09-22,0,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Hands down the best dim sum in LV.  We used to go to what is now Orchid's Garden when it was still named Chau's then moved on to Chang's, and dabbled with Cathay House.  All of these restaurants would hover around 3 stars and dipped as low as being inedible depending on change of chefs and perhaps even ownership.  Then along came the idea of trying Ping Pang Pong inside the Gold Coast casino.

The litmus test for dim sum for me are the cheong fun, the har gow, the oven baked char siu bao, chicken feet, and anything with shrimp.  While the sauce of the cheong fun was very light, the noodles were soft and the shrimp were fresh. The har gow skin was soft and the shrimp again fresh.  The char siu bao was the right combination of sweet and salty.  Chicken feet were not too soft and not too hard.  Did I mention the shrimp were fresh?!

Yes, it's considerably pricier than all the other dim sum restaurants I mentioned but it's worth it.  And yes, it's also frigid cold like another reviewer said because that's how casinos keep you awake but it's nothing hot tea and a sweater can't fix.  And yes, it can get very crowded since it's actually a fairly small dining room for a dim sum restaurant, not to mention a dim sum restaurant in a casino known for its Asian clientel, but go before 11:30 am and you'll be fine since most are either at the gambling tables or are sleeping in from being at the gambling tables all night.",sXnw6JMtCRFCiWRWCcM-bA,1,0,5,LIQcBQsxphscWDlU4_KMaA
4106830,2014-02-12,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Whoa, second day in a row that I picked a place with a huge crowd and a wait.

I think I could've legitimately done without the wait. They have a sign pointing to a waiting area just outside of the restaurant, but they didn't seem to have a dedicated host. I stood there for at least 5 minutes before they even so much as said hi to the party in front of us, and another 5 before they seated us. It was very busy, but at least I should've been welcomed, and I'm pretty sure there were at least a couple of open tables.

By the way, try to park at the side of Gold Coast farthest from the Rio if you want to have a shorter walk, which is healthier than it sounds due to less secondhand smoke exposure.

Anyway, as with any good dim sum place, we were able to dive right in since the carts made their rounds quickly. My friend started off the picks with a har gow (4 pieces), a shu mai (4), and a rather large and unfamiliar bowl of some sort of tripe with ginger and daikon. I later got us a plate of shrimp stuffed eggplant pieces (3), some deep fried shrimp balls with sugar cane (2) and some nice compact egg tarts (2). The last item was the chicken feet that my friend was pining for the whole time.

Everything was definitely on the high end of good. All the savory items had sufficient flavor and non-mushiness, and the egg tarts were very flaky and were still noticeably warm at the end of the meal even though I'd ordered them at the start. I didn't fall in love with any one dish, but the quality was solid overall. Prices are probably a bit more than you'd expect since it's a casino restaurant and there's not all that many dim sum shops here. It was most likely $5.88 each for the tripe bowl and chicken feet, per my friend, and we had one $2.18 order, four $2.88 items, and one $3.88 dish. Couldn't tell you which is which since I'm not that much of a dim sum connoisseur, sorry! 

Overall, I wasn't blown away by any single item, but it was solid dim sum and I definitely prefer this to East Ocean, which has seemed a little lacking for me the past couple of trips for some reason. I also definitely appreciated that we got a tangerine and candy here instead of a fortune cookie (looking at you, East Ocean).

We had several different dumplings, some buns and several selections from the menu as well. One standout (again, I apologize for not knowing names) was a shrimp dumpling that had a creamy, slightly sweet filling that almost ""burst"" in the mouth, and was served with candied walnuts. Oh. My. That was so good. Other dishes featuring pork, beef and chicken were fantastic.

I can tell you though that 98% of their customers are Asian and so that is a huge indicator of the level of authenticity.  In the past we had trouble communicating with the staff because they usually speak in their own language, this last time though it seems they have hired more English speaking staff and it was considerably easier to order.

Everyone is smiley and happy, the worst part is getting seated.

The wait can be extremely discouraging if you are a regular guest and dont know anyone that works here to pull you ahead of line. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes not because of the food but because of the line / seating situation. I have witnessed waiting in line for 30 mins on few occasions and noticed some workers will help their friends get seated faster without waiting which caused most of the public people in line frustrated. Also if you are a casino guest at a certain tier you also get to go in front of line. After groups of friends and casino guests were pulled into the front of line i noticed 3 separate groups of people in line in front of me left because they were upset with the way the line worked which helped me get seated faster. I no longer go inlesa im with group that knows a worker to sneak us in or use my players card for the casino tier.

Ping Pang Pong - let's just called it PPP - is also located within a Casino, namely the Gold Coast. The one big differentiation about this restaurant as opposed to others is that it's located far off the strip so the patrons are not visitors that just happen to walk by here. Most of the customers appear to be locals who drove here for the food.

For the most part the dishes are pretty tasty and fresh with high turnover rate. The roast duck was succulent, the salt and pepper smelt and the baked BBQ pork puff were delicious. We ordered a plate of stir-fried pea sprout greens and it was cooked just right. 

One of the desserts was recommended by the restaurant and they are these red bean filled circular donut-like pastries dusted with granulated sugar. I find them to be overrated as the crust was dry and the filling was overly sweet.

4460847,2017-12-31,0,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Beware of unexpected overcharge when they total the bill (charging for special item when it was a small item on the original bill)!

First visit to this restaurant yesterday, here is my takes:

Pros:
1. Nice décor.
2. Dishes are ""on the average"" slightly better. Individual dishes can be better or worse than an average dim sum place. 
3. The soy paper roll was more tasty than the one I used to have.
4. They do fill your teapot regularly.

Cons:
1. Accounting for quantity, price of most dishes are 50% to 100% more expensive than the regular dim sum place I go to.  So unless money is no subject to you, it may not be worth it.

2. Some dishes are not hot. The stuffed pepper I had was lukewarm, which made for a much lesser dining experience. I passed on the pot sticker for that reason, knowing it has been sitting on the cart as long as the stuffed pepper. Some dishes really do not taste the same when they are not hot. At this price level, one certainly expect more.

3. The Har Gow is 50% more expensive and not bigger nor better. My 7 years old label it as yucky and stop eating it after she had one! Why? She said the skin is soggy. Har Gow has been her favorite dish at our regular dim sum place and she usually finish 4 in a single setting, not this time.

4. The baked bbq pork bun taste sticky, and is small, though only 20% more expensive.

5. The waiter made no attempt to write down or understand what we want when we first sat down (we asked for 4 bowls, a pot of water and a pot of tea, plastic spoons and forks for the kids, the last three items were omitted by him) and came back with half of the items we wanted. We were left waiting, not knowing if he is going to come back with the other items, he never did.

6.. Last but not the least, the check! They overcharged me when they totaled the bill by charging Small dim sum(labelled as A)  as special dim sum (labelled as D), a difference of $3 per dish plus tax.  I do not know how that can be an honest mistake, A and D are not next to each other. 
Is it intentional? That is certainly fruit for thought. Most customers do not check their bill and would never know.   I go to other dim sum restaurants frequently (at least once a week, sometimes 3 times) and never had any billing error (I am one of the rare few who check my bills regularly). Ping Pong Pang is one for one in the department of inflating the charge at the cash register. When it was pointed out to them and  they came back with the correct bill, there was no ""I am sorry for the error"". It certainly left a bad taste in my mouth. To make a billing mistake and not apologize for it certainly leaves a lot to be desired.",XAAt7NKDOZzvGOPxY-1kOA,1,0,1,ano3ys_IwGgJOxGTFbS-_A

However, be prepared for a long wait if you come between the hours of 11am to 1pm. We got there a little before 11, and didn't sit down until 12:15. The line moves pretty slowly. The cutoff time is 3pm, and that's the exact time they stop coming around with carts. On the second day, we got there around 2:30 thinking we had some time, but they stopped serving soon after. The waitress was nice enough to give us a small plate on the house.

The service is not the best. The busboys who take your order for drinks take forever to refill ice water, as well as hot water for tea. When we asked about refills as he was passing, he seemed really pissed. Sour attitude throughout the meal. However, the ladies who come around with the dim sum carts are pretty friendly, and although it may not be their job, if you ask them about refills or missing utensils, they will make sure you get it right away.

It's a little far of a walk from the Strip, but we walked the 1 mile with no problems. The weird pedestrian walkway bridge makes it seem longer. You can take the free shuttle from Paris, Bally, or Harrahs to and from Rio, the casino next door.",-dee0n79sJW8TJStUVcWqw,1,0,4,9bw4j9SIOIWXNpqjEzfwvg

Price:  Fair
Food:  Overall is good
*Shrimp Ball - Good
*Chicken Feet - Below Average because it is not well done enough
*Chicken with mushroom over rice in a bamboo container - Not good (There were very little chicken on top of the bamboo container and it tasted frozen and stalled.  The rice is too dry.)  Don't order this dish.
*Lau Sa Bau (Sweet bun with yellow filling) - Bad.  The bun part is fine but the filling is awful.  The filling should be in bright yellow color and a light sweet taste to it.  When I bit into it, it appeared in this orange color and the taste is funny.  So, don't order this either.
*Steamed Spare Ribs - Ok and very oily and fatty.

San Pan Tiger Prawns were very good.  Head, legs, and tail on.  Spiced just right.  Fried enough that legs crunched to powder and head held together and juicy.

Ma Po Tofu with Pork was edible.  Not good.  There were flavors missing.  The heat was right with Szechuan pepper.  Its just that no other flavors seemed present.  Lots of tofu not enough pork. Bland.

Noodles were completely tasteless.

Mo Shoo Pork was excellent.  No question.  It came as an appetizer.  Two large pre-filled rices pancakes.  At first bite i realized it needed Hoisin sauce. The next bite made me realize I needn't ask for it as it was already in there.  Wood ear mushrooms even.  Plenty of pork and veggies.

The price for all this was under $60.  Myself and two Partners-in-Dine would have been happier if the food tasted as good as those few dishes did.

When we were ready to pay our check there were no servers on the floor. We realized an entire table of six or seven eating dinner one table over from ours were the entirety of floor STAFF having dinner together.

We had to get up and pay at the register waiting in line behind several other diners waiting to pay their bills.  I think under normal circumstances we would have paid our server.  What happened tonight I am not sure.

Some you'll only find as specialty items in Asia and not found in the states. Large portions as well for a dimsum plate so you get value for your buck. Nicely flavored shrimp dumplings and chinese meatballs. They had a great tofu dessert. Served hot in a bowl with sugar syrup. Delicious shrimp and beef churn fun. Freshly baked egg tarts that were still hot and flakey. Their beef chow fun was also very good with lots of ingredients and can serve a large group.

See?  Don't even front.  You're grinning right now-- or at least cracking a smile too.  :P

So I just had to check it out.

Chicken Congee.  They make special!  (For you?)  Yes, for me.

Usually I don't care for runny, Cantonese style rice gruel.  Plain, thick, bright white porridge is what makes my palate happiest.  Chicken bits, soup colour and mystery stuff that I myself did not place in the cooked down rice, just weirds me out... sorry.  Blame it on my boring Taiwanese-Japanese influenced upbringing.

However.  What's the point of being in Vegas, if you don't take chances?  In this case, I gambled on trying it.  And it paid off.  In my tummy.

This congee item wasn't on the menu, but it was kind of them to cook it up.  The waitress suggested it.  Perhaps she took one look at my haggardness and thought I needed some.

It was quite good.  Wor Wonton Soup was also basic and tasty.  Will have to try the dim sum this place is known for, next time.

The soups here were a good way to wind down a full day of travel and eating on the run.

We ate here with some friends that had lived in Vegas and said this was one of the best places for dim sum. We arrived here around noon, and there was a bit of a wait, since there is limited space in the restaurant, especially for large parties of more than 4. Ignoring our PANGs of hunger, we waited patiently. It probably took us about 20-30 minutes to get seated. 

While the selection is more limited than other dim sum restaurants, they do you have your standard dim sum items like shu mai, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fried taro cake, chicken feet, spare ribs, congee, and bao. 

The items were hot, and fresh tasting. The carts went by at a decent rate, but we were warned that you should get any items you wanted while the cart was there, since you might not see that cart again. Prices were a bit high compared to other restaurants I've eaten at (3-4 dollars per item average), but that was to be expected for dim sum in a Vegas casino.

Service was a bit spotty, but to be expected since the restaurant was filled to capacity with hungry diners. Waiters were buzzing back and forth, like a ball in a PONG game, filling water, getting more tea, and getting people's checks.

So if you're hungry for dim sum, this restaurant is a good choice. If you are with a larger party though, it helps to come here before noon when it's less crowded.",DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog,1,1,4,i7uYsRC32sG3oFu-Rft9yg

I've visited this place for dim sum about 3 - 4 times now and the food has ALWAYS been consistent.  You get the typical har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, and steamed buns.

DIM SUM: Let me just say, the dim sum here surpasses any in the area.  I've been to KJ in the Rio, Chang's, and Cathay House.  Ping Pang Pong has the best variety, quickest service, and the food is actually served HOT, which is important to me.  Some of the other dim sum places will throw plates of cold food at you, which is unacceptable!  I am a huge fan of dim sum so we will be frequenting this place for just that.  

DINNER: MUST TRY THE LOBSTER OVER NOODLES. Honestly, I don't know if I ever need to order anything else here. Their lobster is fan-TAS-tic. Best way to eat here is order ""family-style""... just order a good variety of fish (the sea bass is great), vegetables, and meat.... and SHARE!

I just laugh when I hear stuff like this. I bet these come from the same people who says Olive Garden is the best Italian food in Vegas, Starbucks having the best coffee, or voting Taco Bell as having the best Mexican food. Just remember all the awards Sam Woo got, and we all know how good that place is. Anyways on with the review!

@ Shrimp Dumplings (Har gau) - Good shrimp taste. Disappointing texture on the skin. Changs has PPP beat on this one.

@ Pork Dumplings (Siu Mai) - This was okay. But much fresher than Changs.

@ Egg Custard Bun - This is just okay. But after having the gooey and hot filling back in SoCal, this just doesn't seem that good anymore. Filing was lukewarm, almost cold here.

@ Congee (jook) - Much better than Changs by far. Flavorful and hearty. If I didn't have to share with the other people around the table, this would be all mine!

@ Shrimp Rolled in Rice Noodles w/ Soy Sauce - Tastey shrimp taste, PPP has Changs beat on this one by a narrow margin with a better rice noodle wrap and soy sauce.

@ Oysters - Good oysters, but they need to clean it more thoroughly. Almost every bite, I got grit in my mouth. Couldn't really enjoy the oysters because of this

@ Almond Covered Shrimp Balls - Yummy shrimps, but found the almonds unnecessary since you couldn't really taste it. But if you like almonds, you'll enjoy this item. Toasting the almonds a little bit would really bring out the flavor of the dish.

@ Fried Shrimp + Crab Claw - Its shrimp stuffed into a crab leg and deep fried. Yum and definitely a good item to get. 

@ Fried Tofu - Crispy, but found it a little too salty for me. HK Star got this dish down.

@ Red Bean Sesame Balls - Red bean was good, but the sesame balls is disappointing. Its the soggy and oily appetizer that reminds me what sesame balls are. Properly prepare this, and I'll enjoy this dish.

@ Tea - Usually I don't comment on the tea, but tea is traditionally part of dim sum. This tea was weak. Of course, it naturally got more weaker as the teapots got refilled. So towards the end of the meal, you're literally just drinking water. Even Pho Village gives me better tea with my meal than this place. Really really REALLY disappointing. 

""Ping Pang Pong"", the place with the name that sounds racist and probably won't eat there because of it (Lily D). I'm not sure whats up with Chinese restaurants in Vegas and crappy names (see Food Express Chinese Restaurants), but it just makes my head explodes. I swear they do the opposite of picking the best names, and pick the most stereotypical Chinese restaurant name they can think of. /endrant

This is more pricier than Changs, but this place is a little more consistent than Changs. Some stuff Changs is better and some stuff, PPP is better.

Coming from a city that is very big on dim sum, Ping Pang Pong gets the job done for Vegas dim sum. Now i will admit that it is not Los Angeles or San Francisco quality, this place still offers a lot of varieties that are seen in dim sum places. They have the old fashioned feel of steam carts being pushed around while you pick your selections, and the steam foods are very fresh during dim sum service. 

They also offer a very nice late night menu as a lot of their dishes resemble good Cantonese flavor. Selected dim sum is offered at night time. The rice plates are tasty while they serve up some of the Chinese favorites such as Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, steamed razor clams/scallops, Mapo Tofu, and Asian vegetables. Fried rice and noodle plates are also solid. Also, they have a special where they serve a 5 pound lobster for about $80, not a bad deal in this town.

The service here is what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant, quick and convenient, and the servers definitely know how to do their jobs well. The servers are very English friendly if needed be. 

As for the bad, the wait here can be very long during lunch hours, as well as opening of dinner service. Also, if you are sensitive to MSG, do not eat here as they are definitely not shy of it. You will know with crazy amount of thirst after you eat.",3gX0SnispHbO2QRdGipt0g,1,1,4,3vSHpc6Oy8M-ijqo23TIOw

Inside the casino.  It's right across the slots and a soup noodle spot.  At first glance, it looks very fancy and it's packed.  The carts start coming  but then (crickets... ... .. . ...)  Why are the  carts empty? Why are there no beef balls or congee available? Then we ordered and I am a huge DIM SUM advocate and I rarely say bad things about restaurants.  But the attitude from the cart pushers are bad.  Our congee came in old tasting and chunky.  We had to ask for it to be changed.  Also, the portions  were small and it did not look fresh. The prices here are ridiculous.  Maybe it's because you are paying for the restaurant location.  The restrooms are outside the restaurant around the corner which is an inconvenience.  I love that the carts have the same food and no one is ordering.  They do not look fresh at all.  Uber small and super expensive.  I rather go to Spring Mountain for food.  But the only plus is that the parking lot is 1 mile away but free (so you get a nice workout to burn off your food).  Overall, this place get's no love from me.  I will not be back.  I hope this was just a bad day.  Sorry guys I don't like this place at all.  By the way did I mention you will be overcharged for something that should cost $1.25 to $2.55 for a dim sum dish.

We didn't receive great service here, the dimsum carts came but the rest of the employees ignored us when we needed some plum sauce or water.  But I wasn't too surprised, if you want the authentic Chinese restaurant experience, you have to expect the not-so stellar service.

Half a year later, I was driving around town and noticed a billboard saying they're voted the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. 

So I gave them a try. The first thing came to my mind - Gold Coast is better than I thought. After minutes of walking through the casino, I finally made it to the restaurant. It's an open space meaning people outside can see inside. The tables are placed in an traditional way and may seem to be too closed to each other if you expect more privacy. 

I had no idea they had a long line waiting outside. I was there for at least half an hour. By the time I left there was no line. They did have a waitress come out and ask for party size but I don't think it helped at all.

It was lunch time, so beside regular menu, they have lots of dim-sum served as well. Actually people go there just for the dim-sum for lunch. I had 9 dishes plus one dessert. (yes I ate it all by myself) Not very good, but not bad either. Also had a mushroom tofu which I couldn't finish there, it was pretty yummy. 

I expected the bill to be around 70, but surprisingly it was 47 after tax. Some of the dim-sum I ordered were only 2.88 and some are 3.88, not even close to the price I thought it would be. (Dim-sums are divided into two categories. Every time you get something, they stamp on your paper accordingly) 

I laughed when I got the bill.The pronunciation of 8 in Chinese is similar to ""get rich"". The pricing is pretty authentic to Chinese culture.",52P9ndvJxZLlq-CbXiY9Ig,3,3,4,0WL-WKFFuR_Ge4zjuJifxw

It was really busy with a lot of older Asian people which we thought was a good sign since they are normally picky about Chinese food. We were daring and ordered three dishes: Stir fried lamb with vegetables, combination spicy chow mein and a scallop in oyster sauce hot pot. The prices were reasonable at around $8 to $10 a dish. We also got hot tea, rice and each got a bowl of soup for free with our meal. The food was delicious. We were worried about the scallop hot pot because normally scallops are overcooked and taste chewy. But here, the scallops melted because they were perfectly cooked. Also, the sauce included cloves of roasted garlic that were just as good as the scallops. We ended up finishing all of our food without feeling greasy or gross like at many other Chinese places.

     I have been here a few times and went there again today for some dim sum. Every single time we eat here there is always a long waiting line to just get seated. The food is average for a dim sum place. The only reason I go here is because I have comps to use up before they expire. After waiting about 15-30 minutes to be seated, we wait again for about 10 minutes before a waiter/waitress even shows up to take our drink order. Almost every time we sit at the table we are missing either silverware or tea cups. This place is always understaffed and could use more personnel to wait on the customers. The food is about average and once something runs out from the dim sum carts it takes over 30+ minutes to replenish that food item. This restaurant could definitely use a lot more improvements to service, training, and wait times.",M8p5qYbBEjbDJzixl4z5xQ,0,0,2,-zdYzspGmC9O4e834nZUnA

The servers will direct you to the more bland and gringo-safe food if you're not Chinese so make sure you ask them about the things they don't offer that are on their carts and pay attention to the items that the regulars all select and you'll be happy. We got a spicy snail dish only because we saw it and asked about it. It was nice if you're okay with chewy snails, but it being on our table also encouraged some servers to offer us stuff on their second pass that wasn't offered the first time round.

i came here around noon to eat. it wasn't busy but like Teri i was happy to see mostly asian families eating here.. a good sign right? immediately after being seated our drinks were ordered and our first cart came around. picked the usual shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings. we didnt have time to try it because all the other carts were on their way around. hmm.. potstickers.. beef with noodle.. fried shrimp ball  thing.. lol.. i tried the pork dumpling first. it was tasty but cold.. the shrimp dumpling was also cold and the outer rice layer was hard. definitely  old. the fried shrimp ball was oddly sweet. it tasted like they threw in cake batter into the batter. the potstickers were okay.. a little chewy.. the only thing that came out hot was the beef with noodle. which is my favorite. so i was pleased about that. 

this was my bf's first time eating dim sum and i apologized because this was not the experience i wanted him to have. i know a lot of people don't like cathay house but this visit to ping pang pong left me wondering how this place could be better. maybe i came at the wrong time? i hope so..",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,0,1,2,XYnat03KERjWQPjcwKmmDQ

Depending on the time you come, right when they open or closer to when they close around 3pm, will dictate what dim sum items are available. For sure if you go early,  the staple favorites are usually available, except for the shrimp rice sheets. And towards the end of the dim sum service, tripe and rice porridge is no longer available.  

We arrived at 130pm and we waited in line for about 30 min. I'd say there were 3 food carts max that were rotating around the entire restaurant. The shu mai was the bomb, they may be tiny but they pack a ton of flavor especially from the shittake mushrooms! We ended up ordering two of those hehe. 

They ran out of the typical shrimp rice sheets, fortunately they had dried shrimp/scallion rice sheets which surprisingly were super flavorful and tasty! The flavor of the shrimp and scallions pair really well together and has made it become one of my favorite dishes!

The bbq pork buns are also delicious here. The sweetness of the pork meat and the fluffiness of the bun is just perfect. I love the fact that the pork filling is not too sweet and the pork is not fatty at all. And they don't skimp on the amount of filling either...

The har gow was ok, not impressive by any means. We also tried shrimp tofu...it was ok, if you enjoy soggy tofu hehe. At least they give you a big piece of shrimp on top of it. I also wished they hadn't run out of the tripe or rice porridge. But oh well. The egg tarts on the other hand, were really flaky, light, and not too sweet either. Perfect dessert to end our meal.

1.  Parking - A bit of a hike as you have to go to the Gold Coast Casino parking and then walk to the restaurant. So it is what it is. Not to bad, not too close.

2.  Ambiance - I knock off a star for it being or having a very odd feeling. It is kinda open to the casino floor, and it seems to be that the restaurant was stuck here, rather than designed to be here.  You have to walk through the smokey casino to get to the restaurant and then there is always a lingering amount of smoke from the people smoking outside the restaurant.

3.  Note - You have to go to use the casino bathrooms, which while they are not far at all, you still have to go through the casino. Not an issue if you are a casino lover.

4.  Food - Not bad.  The carts of dim sum did not seem to weave an order that I could detect.  You have to flag them down. The food itself is good, yet when you have to search out the cart , wait and wait it dampers the experience a bit.  For this I knock off 1/2 a star.

5.  Service - Not bad, but kinda like ""we are busy"" and ""you should be happy to wait for a table"" type attitude.  This type of attitude does not bother me greatly, however, it also does not endear loyalty and a pleasant experience. With so many great restaurants opening up that serve dim sum, they need to up their game.

We headed straight for the Gold Coast Hotel and luckily we still had about 50 mins before the dim sum ended at 3pm.

Ping Pang Pong might be a catchy name to entice Mid-Westerners into the establishment, but in Chinese, this place is actually called ""Golden Ingot"" -- a form of ancient Chinese currency. It is 'jin yuan bao"" in Mandarin or ""gum yuen bo"" in Cantonese.

We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. After we were seated, the tea and water was promptly brought to the table.

First off, there aren't that many dishes offered anymore!  They used to have a larger variety and now they are lacking!  They don't even offer the Big F's favorite - the Macanese egg tart, which really puts a damper on things.  (They apparently are trying out this new egg souffle dish instead.)  I haven't seen the pickled pig's feet ever again as well.  Blah!

Service was pretty horrible too.  I thought it was because I get dumped at the corner table all the time, but I just think it sucks.  The last time we ate there (last month), we didn't even have all our dishes and serving utensils before the dim sum arrived.  It took awhile to wave down a waiter and get some tea.  We ordered a plate of Singapore noodles and that took forever to come out as well.  

And it's so random when it's busy.  On one Saturday I went, there was no wait.  And then other times it's a good half an hour wait for a party of four.  You just never know.

However, I have since requested that we go back and try the other dim sum places in Vegas again since PPP leaves me less than happy and not satisfied.

For four individuals it costs us about each about $25 (also take in account that we order two chef specials and one a la Carter dish). Therefore, their food was not too pricey. As for the service, I will say it is typical for any dim sum restaurant. I will say some of their popular dishes (shuimai) were running out quickly. But I will say that if they don't have it on their cart, they will send someone to another cart to retrieve it for you, so you wouldn't have to wait. 

Tea is also important for Dim Sum. Most restaurants that I've been to, I have had the tea as complimentary. This restaurant charged for tea per person and without giving me the choice of whether I wanted tea and tea choice. In addition, the tea was slightly bland. 

As an Asian American, I had no issue with communication. And I think it's important to share this because Vegas is place where people come from all around the world. The cart servers and workers all spoke English and were able to articulate the dishes well enough for my non-Chinese speaking friends to understand. 

Lastly, I will say that I would like to highlight that their shuimai, egg tarts, vegetarian chow mein, and BBQ pork buns were delicious!

Another example of waitress Ellie's inattentiveness (she didn't seem overly busy) was my iced tea glass would sit empty for about 5 minutes before she or someone else would refill it.

Chinese restaurants aren't exactly known for their great customer service.  I guess that's part of the authenticity of this place.  Another thing that I though was nice is that unlike many Chinese restaurants here in the US, this place didn't go overboard with all the Chinese artwork & other nicnacks that most Chinese restaurants feel obligated to put up.

Between the two of us, we ordered a bunch of traditional dim sum dishes including chickens feet =).  It came out to be about 15 a person I believe and we were both stuffed!

My favorite dish is probably the pork and preserved egg congee.  I was surprised at how good it was!  Could have eaten that whole bowl myself.  The Siu Mai (pork dumpling)  and Ha Gow (shrimp dumpling) satisfies my dim sum craving.  The banana leaf wrapped rice was good.  The tofu skin roll and spare ribs also tasted delicious.

We arrived at the restaurant on Sunday before 11AM, which was a smart move because by 11:30, the place was packed and a line had formed with people waiting to get in.  

The dim sum came out of the kitchen fresh and hot at a regular frequency wheeled around the dining room on small carts.  While the restaurant may have been expanded and renovated, the food was as delicious as I remembered.  Pro tip:  Larger parties (4 or more) are more optimal for dim sum dining than a party of two.

So, when you see that all the peeps in a Chinese restaurant are Asian, that's gotta be a good sign, right?  

The food was good, great even.  The prices were extremely reasonable for large, family style dishes.  We tried the usual offerings, including a spicy fried rice that had some serious kick.  Loved it.  The salt and pepper pork chops were delicious, but didn't have a ton of meat on them.

It's not on the dinner menu, but I was told you can order dimsum from the kitchen late night for $2.88 each. The selection is limited and depends on what didn't sell that morning. Hey, it's better than nothing....the only late night dimsum (Kan's) closed. 

We ended up getting:

Shrimp Har Gao- the shrimp and wrapper was fine, but I think the wrapper is slightly too thick.
Shumai- I did not like their version. Something about the taste just doesn't work for me and was just OK. 
Shrimp cake- these were tasty. They were panfried so it was crisp and inside was dense cake, shrimp and green onion. 

We also got off the menu:

Mapo Tofu ($7.95)- pretty good. The meat had a sausage like flavor to it which was interesting since most just throw plain ground meat. Tofu is always noms to me.

Salt&Pepper Pork Chop ($9.95)- the fry was light so the texture was nice. Funny that ""salt"" is part of the name, but it needed a tad more of that. 

I was surprised by the prices. I honestly thought it would be more at a casino, but it's about the same pricing as some of the nicer Chinese restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd. I think it was very fair priced and the quality was good. 

The service was friendly and pretty on it with drinks and checking up on us.

And then visiting Ping Pang Pong for lunch and dinner.  PPP offers authentic Chinese dim sum with some unique items which I don't see in SCal, or maybe I have yet to visit to the ones that serve the similar dim sum fare.  Chill waitresses, friendly service, they are more than happy to show you what's in those little tins from their carts. 

The porridge with century old eggs was very satisfying, I was half full after eating it.  Enough century old egg pieces in it to qualify for the name if you know what I mean.  Here is my YAY!(?) 

The slow cooked/simmered snails ($5.88) on dim sum menu is probably quite common in Hong Kong, but it's rare in the States.  Definitely a winner.  They were easy to be taken out from the shell, nothing broke off in the process, marvelous!  I enjoy doing that!  They were very flavorful, slightly spicy but not too spicy and had a nice chewiness to them.  What a treat!  Good times. ()

The shrimp ball with sticky rice is a variation from the well known ?????but theirs have more vegetable matter and less shrimp matter than I expected.  Still good though, and goes well with the egg white dipping sauce.  

After I spotted the snails, fried shrimp balls with sugar cane ($5.88) were put on the back burner, I ended up taking them to go.  Those shrimp balls got nothing on them snails.  They didn't taste that good when they were cold, they probably taste better when they were freshly made.  

The disc shaped sticky rice patty with lotus seed paste is the kind of mochi that I like to have for snack.  Not too sweet but sticky enough.  I should have got some to go.

Can't resist the sight of any pan fried dumplings, how can I?  Just look at their pan fried bottoms.  In this case, the bun was perfect but the filling needed to be bigger and more substantial with more meat.

This restaurant is shaped right, the circular floor plan goes well with la rotunda breadbasket of mine. I like the decor too, very Chinese in a traditional way.  (¬?¬)

Encouraged by the dim sum success, I thought I would try their dinner.  I wasn't particularly inspired by the porridge with abalone ($9.99) which didn't have much flavor as I expected.  I had better ones at a friend's house with chucks of abalone pieces.  But this is how they make it in most Cantonese restaurants, you get the thinly sliced abalone pieces in the porridge.  Dried abalone is some kind of delicacy, but quality various.  Those were definitely not the best I've had.  And they don't put much in there.  If you read the knock-off version of Sun Tzu Art of War, and take the last strategy's number, minus 2 dozens, that's the number of abalone slices I got in the porridge.

When I was having dinner, I noticed they (the managers or the ppl by the register) just let the customers waiting by the door without acknowledging them and telling them how long the wait would be, that's rude.",WAHDqdC96ZzF19FBeMPdbg,9,9,4,ubvcP_f2u4nFigGLmh5gqQ

My mom got a $40 complementary voucher to any of their restaurants, and I thought what better time than now to try it. Nestled inside the Gold Coast casino sits this hidden gem. They have a separate line for to go orders which was really convenient and dinner rush hasn't started yet so it wasn't as crazy as expected, though there were a lot of people dining in already.

Their shumai and  Har gow shrimp dumpling was delicious, so was the shrimp with chives. The pork bun was one of the best I've had in town. They also had this bun that had lap cheong (Chinese sausage) inside which was very savory and mouth watering. For dessert we got sesame balls, coconut buns and mango pudding, all 3 were great.

It's located at The Gold Coast Hotel, all the way in the back. I have to give this place props for the nostalgic Chinese feel to it. Everything from the  tables to the uniforms scream Chinese. It seems so out of place at this hotel. It's as if it's in it's own little bubble.

We got there about 10:30am and there was no wait. The place opens at 10:00am. When we left an hour later, the place was packed. When we first got there, I heard the workers speaking in Cantonese, a good sign. The hostess sat us at a table and gave us one of those stamp cards. Every time we took something from the cart that they pushed by us, they would stamp the card. That's how they total the bill at the end. This is the only dim sum place that I've been to that charged for tea. With that being said, the dim sum here is a good deal compared to Hawaii, where I'm from. All the items were about a dollar cheaper. 

We had the black bean spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, stuffed eggplant, and the hot tofu dessert. These are pretty much my staples. I tend to order the same items at dim sum. I have to say the food is excellent. Everything that we ordered was on point. The shrimp in the dumplings was fresh and the wrapper translucent. The chicken feet was plump and huge. The eggplant was stuffed with shrimp paste. My favorite was the hot tofu dessert. It was silky smooth and so yummy with the ginger syrup. It was as good or better than most dim sum places in Hawaii.

As with most dim sum places, you get better service if you speak Cantonese. After the hostess sat us, no carts came around for a while.

The roast duck had the right amount of seasoning and was decently tender.  However, the biggest flaw was the skin was soggy and not crispy at all.  My dad made roast duck at the now closed Mini-Garden on Hotel Street in Honolulu Chinatown so I know that this a big no no.  Amazingly, if you are looking for a good roast duck, the Caesar's buffet is where you will find it.

The won ton noodles soup broth was spot on, without the usual massive amounts of msg and was infused with the a perfect amount of white pepper.  Won ton was ok, but the noodles was either overcooked or poor quality (not enough egg used), as it was too soft and not enough hardness like the ones you get at Louie's Noodle Shop (you can buy their uncooked noodles nearby on Reno Ave).

The san pan tiger prawns was a big disaster.  Description was it was in shell with ""aged soy sauce with garlic and shallots"".  Not even close, looks like they used the leftover shrimp from their hau gau and stir fried it.

The only saving grace from being a two star review is the enoki mushroom fried tofu with pickled cabbage.  This is an excellent dish, the tofu has a nice fried exterior with a soft inside.  The enoki mushrooms and the pickled cabbage provides other complimentary flavors to the dish.

Perhaps trying only their dim sum is a better option.",tw1YfWwGJffPlUNTl_w1fw,6,6,3,-ArpCWgaz1KpkTO8PuFRAA

They have all the usual favorites: har gow, shiu mai, spareribs, hom gok, taro puffs, sesame balls, egg tarts, gai lan, etc. We ordered a couple items (noodles and veggies) off the non-dim sum menu (limited items) but  found them to kind of pricey for what they were.

They definitely need more staff as there were often 2-3 carts just sitting in a corner of the restaurant full of fresh plates going cold. Meanwhile, patrons were  looking impatiently all around for the next cart to come around.

However, last night, we happened to be booking up Flamingo and decided to give it another chance because for several months straight I had a serious Wrinkled Green Bean addiction, and I wanted to go back for another round.

I knew immediately I would be ordering the Wrinkled Green Beans with some extra wrinkles, and I also ordered some basic chicken soft noodles. The service was a little slow, but friendly. Our waiter smiled when I told him I liked them ""really wrinkly."" My husband ordered a noodle soup.

The green beans had a nice flavor, but they were pretty greasy and some of the magic flavor (described as a Chinese tarragon) was missing. The noodles were brown from soy sauce, which isn't my preference. Plus, the noodles lacked the amount of veggies that you often get in a noodle dish. A few slivers of cabbage, some hidden bean sprouts, but no carrots. And, the noodles were a bit chewy. The noodles were no comparison to the same dish at Noodle Exchange just across the way. Everything just seemed a tad too heavy, and my husband wasn't in love with his soup. He said, ""It wasn't bad.""

Found inside the Gold Coast Casino, and said by some to offer the best Dim Sum in a City oft lamented for lacking anything on par with other locations of similar size, it was with three friends that an 11:00am arrival was planned at Ping Pang Pong - one showing up far later than the rest, but really not missing much as the majority of items proved mediocre to decent at best, though service was admittedly far superior to several spots on Spring Mountain Road...perhaps to be expected considering the price.

Served in traditional cart format, the table provided cattycorner the kitchen giving a good vantage of carts being loaded with fresh items throughout the duration of a two-hour stay, Ping Pang Pong features most of the usual suspects with minimal variation and taking a slow-but-prudent approach to ordering as the restaurant sat almost universally full it was with teas both iced and hot that service began, a duo of crispy duck and supple pork each served with peanuts and complimentary sauces proving well roasted and full of flavor, though the former was riddled with bones that left some pieces virtually devoid of meat.

Passing on snails that later went half-uneaten by the tardy member of the party, course two featured fried shrimp balls with a sidecar of creamy mayo along with surprisingly delicate and aromatic chive dumplings that rivaled the best found anywhere in town, and moving onward to a trio of plump crustaceans covered in sliced almonds it was here that the savory highpoints of the afternoon were found, the freshness of each item assured by the good fortune of location though the increasing smell of cooking oil and gas would eventually render that impression unsound.

Underwhelmed by both shumai and har gow with skins that trended too thick, and personally finding both styles of pork buns almost 'dessert like' given the significant amount of sugar present in the sauce, it was a bit of a surprise that the lightly set egg custards were almost entirely natural in flavor atop flaky buttered pastry, a duo of coconut buns ordered as the first of several sweets equally impressive without the gloppy filling that sometimes ruins the texture of the bun.

Adding one more savory, the soft eggplant with an herbal stuffing coated in fermented bean sauce, before going all-in on a trio of sweets to finish, suffice it to say that those fancying red bean paste are well served at Ping Pang Pong, and although items featuring both green tea, pineapple, and sesame were offered the pan fried cakes of red bean as well as baked buns and filled with the same were every bit as good as any tasted anywhere to date, the lack of pressure to turn a table while drinks were repeatedly refilled without request allowing time to linger, chat, and enjoy - an admitted rarity in during peak hours at restaurants serving in this style.

Charging approximately 25% more than other similar spots in town, and failing to nail the standards despite executing a few items quite well, Ping Pang Pong is just another average Dim-Sum joint intended to cater to the growing Asian tourist population, a better option for those confined to casinos found at nearby KJ in the Rio while those with a car would be well served to check out Chang's just a mile and a half to the North.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,4,2,IpGUIaPD-G1uBJRPcm-dUg

It did win some kind of top 10 award for Chinese Restaurants in T + L magazine but other than dim sum, I haven't been to PPP for their regular menu for quite some time.   About 4 or 5 years ago, my sister swore by this place for decent Chinese food. Now it has a lot of competition. So basically, I'm just reviewing their dim sum service.

I had to explain to my husband the difference between AUTHENTIC Chinese food and Chinese food. I've learned that some (not all) that call Panda Express and PF Changs Chinese food may not like AUTHENTIC Chinese food. They are not one and the same.

There is a definite difference in quality compared to other favorite dim sum joints I've been too. PPP is hot & fresh and definitely tasty. I must emphasize HOT because that's the biggest blow for dim sum lovers - cold food! I wouldn't recommend it for 1st time dim summers though unless you speak fluent Chinese. I'm half Asian and can decipher a lot of broken English, but I've had a very difficult time figuring out what the cart ladies say is on their cart. My husband and I are not as adventurous, so we are the types that want to know what we are eating before we eat it....

But once you can identify a food by looking at it, PPP is definitely on the higher end of the spectrum for taste and quality. Their shrimp dumplings for example - are probably the best I've had and when you think about a simple dumpling is made - you have to admire that somewhere in the process, PPP does something spectacular.

The shrimp balls, shumai, pork buns, sticky pork buns - all have a little extra something that sets them above the rest.

The restaurant itself is quaint. You can see the kitchen from your table, and the a lot of what, in most places, is normally behind closed doors. Goldcoast is not the most glamorous of casinos... and the restaurant itself is still a good ways from the parking garage. But if you don't mind walking through the casino and the smoke that comes with it, the location may work for you. 

Plus, if you are a dim sum for breakfast person like me, they do open a bit earlier than a lot places around town 10:00am.

So if you enjoy dim sum, PPP is definitely a must-have on you're list. You just have to, even if it's once.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,3,3,4,0UbGUtbybsRLHUK9Ofm7kA

We were sat within five minutes of arriving and waiter took our drink orders.  She was really quiet at times but really quick.  The menu has a good amount of choices.  My recommendations is get a bowl of soup as an appetizer.  A friend who like asian spots told me once to try start off with one of the soups on the menu.   If the soup is good, then the rest of the food will be good.  We decided to try a soup that had big chunks of pork and asian veggies with had an amazing broth.
When it came time to order, we decided to get a bunch off dishes and try a little of each item.  Out of each item, I recommend trying the walnut prawns.  They are amazing!!! My brother enjoyed the roasted duck.
The place has a nice appearance and its full of Asians coming with large groups.  The table next to us was complaining about something on the order so there was a lot of arguing in Chinese, I think.  I can't wait to come back and get those walnut prawns!!

We had duck bbq pork ribs and broccoli at 9.95, wow that is a lot and the duck was not tasty where I would say Yummy yum yum.  The skin was not crisps.  The rubs and broccoli was good but not at that price. 


The Sui Mai's were okay I didn't like the sesame on top of the,  the hom suy gook were good but it had a string taste of dried shrimp. The meatballs were one star, not good or even soft it s texture is like fish balls which I don't like. 

One lo Mai gai, usually you get wi of the rice wrapped in bamboo leaves 
,ha gow was food.  The bbq pork steam bows and bakes were really good they were filled with plenty of meat. 

The aide chow mein was lacking bean sprouts but it guess it filled my carving as it went by many times and it was was calling my name. 

We got quite anew things but I didn't eat them all.  Someone told me that this was best in town, I have at it is pretty decent but they lack service.  We didn't get our water or tea until way later after sitting down.  The refills were scarce too.  Who expects service drink a Chinese place? I do... 

They have people in line waiting and there was another sign that said wait here.  I wasn't sure if you need to tell them the number in your party and then get in line.  I asked the people in line but they didn't understand me.  I waited for a bit which no one showed up until five minutes later, she tells me to stand in line and she will come.  Okay don't talk to me like I am an irritating you, I just wanted to check.  Besides she sat the first two people then she came back but the people in front of us decide to sit in those two seats and they get in first. Wth... What system is that but shame on the two that didn't say anything.  Okay so there are at least 90% Asian eating but I think that there must be an Asian tour bus coming around because this place has changed quite a bit. 

Good recommendation from friends eh...

Come to dinner and the food was yummy the service form the waiter was excellent.  He was on point tonight. 
The anchovy fried rice was good but not the better than ones in la.  Orange chicken didn't have enough vinegar but it was good.  The pork chops with the red sauce was good I would of liked the chops to have a coating on them.  The best is the spicy salt calamari.  That would get 5 stars from me.

It is all about getting well rounded flavors and plenty of food. Their razor clams and scallops on the half shell are a steal. At $8 for four and two respectively is a steal. I could eat those all night. Just be warned that your breath will be kicking. So much fried garlic goes on top of both dishes. 

PPP is a hit or miss. The green tea smoked duck was not something we enjoyed. I ended up just wanting Peking duck and was sad to see that they don't offer it. The sweet and pungent lotus roots are always a must. Add that with the three dishes I list above and you don't really need anything else.

We arrived at 11:30 am and waited for 45 minutes to be seated. Choice of dim sum was not as wide as I expected, especially the desserts.

Chicken feet (4.5/5): Well-cooked with savory sauce. Nice one.
Stuffed eggplant (4.5/5): The eggplant and the stuffing absorbed the sauce, quite tasty.
BBQ pork pastry (4.5/5): I actually came here for this dish. The BBQ pork was nicely seasoned, and balanced well with the pastry.
Fried shrimp ball (4/5): The shrimp ball was chewy. It came with a sugar cane stick, so I was expecting Vietnamese-style Cho tôm, but it turned out to be totally different. 
Rice roll with beef and coriander (2.5/5): The rice roll was way too thick, and the soy sauce was very bland. To finish the entire roll was suffering.

(Update)
Visited a second time for a gathering. Tried some other stuff:

Bovine offal with daikon (4/5): Savory dish, even the daikon in it was well-cooked and flavorful. 
Steamed beef ball (3.5/5): Balanced lean and fat meat, giving it nice texture. 
Milk pudding (0.5/5): The worst milk pudding I ever had in my life. At first I was surprised that the pudding got a puff pastry crown on it. The pastry wasn't really good - but it's fine, because the pudding itself was far worse. It was watery, strange-flavored, sweet but tasteless...Every bite was torturing.

Ladies pushing the cart were mostly polite and friendly. But most staff here were so busy that we could barely find someone to fill our tea. Seats were packed but acceptable.",qHjy5uxyLBp8sDrlkekE7g,0,1,4,2sVeMnDTyztQNW6bhkk-cA

Soup was delicious with plenty of shrimp, chicken white meat, BBQ pork and pork filled wontons. Throw in some greens, scallions, mushrooms and it is a shareable portion. He second dish was Singapore Rice noodles. Again, plenty of meat and it arrived steaming hot. I added some red chilli paste as I found the curry spicing a little lighter than my preference.

I very rarely drink soda, so when I do, I want it to be kind of special. There was nothing special about my watered down Pepsi.  :(
I told the server that the soda tasted off, and that the syrup needed to be changed.  He nodded, took my glass, ran off, and came back with the exact same crap, which kind of pissed me off.  Whatever.  We didn't come for the Pepsi.

Pot stickers:  These were really good. The wrappers were thicker than any pot stickers I've tried before.  They reminded me more of Russian pilmeni (I love those, so it worked out).

Hot and sour soup:  My boyfriend had a serious issue with this soup. He looked borderline pissed off after trying it.  It wasn't really spicy, or sour.  In fact, we were pretty sure it wasn't hot and sour soup, but the server assured us that it was.  I thought it tasted fine, but it wasn't what either of us expected, or craved. Lame.

Kung Pao chicken:  I thought this dish was great.  The chicken was juicy, all white meat, and perfectly sauced.  

Shanghai noodles:  The noodles were cooked well, and the vegetable ratio was nice.  The mushrooms in it were really tasty, but the pork was barely there.  It came in tiny half-inch slivers, thinner than the noodles themselves.  It was delicious, but it should have had more meat in it.

Overall, it was okay, but I doubt we'd come back.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,3,2,3,0RBfskZ8-s8NcdbJ4Ofqdg

It was solid and pretty consistent for Dimsum. Fresh, the restaurant staff spoke Cantonese (which is the kind of Chinese that dimsum comes from). I give it a 4 because the dimsum is what I would expect out of a decent dimsum, but not AMAZING. For being in a hotel/casino, it's pretty good as well. Dimsum is usually either good or really bad. LOL It's tough to make it bad, but it happens quite a bit.  Whatever chinatown you go to, usually the crowded dimsum places are the best and having to wait in a line in vegas for dimsum meant Ping Pang Pong was decent and it was.  I would say it's a little bit above average.

We arrived a little after 11:00 am and waited over an hour before being seated.  I just wish the wait would have been worth it-at least the service part.  For the most part the food was above average (4 stars), but the service was horrendous (1 star).  

Food
We had the following:  steamed chicken feet (good), baked bbq pork bun (very good), shrimp hargow (very good), fried sesame ball (very good), steamed pork spareribs (most of the pieces had too much fat), eggrolls (2 plates half had holes and were burnt, but good), baked egg tart (very good-only 2 on plate but they were big), sticky rice in lotus leaf (only 1 on plate and pretty bad-way toooooo much soy sauce or whatever sauce is part of it), rice noodle roll with shrimp (very good), and bean curd skin (horrible-way too much meat-it didn't taste normal-almost dumpling like, no bamboo shoots).

Service
For 3/4 of the plates we had, we had to flag people down get the food.  Once we asked for them to calculate our bill, it took about 10 minutes.  NEVER had to wait this long at any dim sum place to get bill.  Once I received the bill, I went to the front to pay.  There were two people up front handling the bills and payments.  No one was in line to pay but they were finishing ringing up the bill for another table.  I thought I would be next since I was just standing there waiting.  No.  One lady just started doing some other stuff, while I patiently waited.  This lady then went behind the screen and was given another bill and they processed this one before me-I'm just still standing there so I turned my back on them and looked out at the casino for about 2-3 minutes.  Finally, they said excuse me so I turned around and I thought that I can now finally pay my bill.  The other lady thought they were processing my bill, but the first lady said that it wasn't mine, so I had to wait another 30 seconds before they finally took my bill.

I don't expect very good service at Chinese restaurants, but the experience I had regarding the bill calculation and paying the bill takes my Chinese restaurant experience to a brand new low.",DcY70IPWXm6w5ays04TLiQ,1,0,2,-BvrrHjwEdnnjY5sYOPTCw

Since I was alone and without my husband, who usually says ""no asian food,"" I came here for Dim Sum.  When I used to work at Boeing I used to go to Top Gun in Bellevue and Imperial Garden in Renton a bit for Dim Sum and loved it, so I'm comparing this to those establishments.

I had one order of Shumai, one Shrimp Dumpling, one steamed  Pork Bun, and after I was full they had fried crab claws that I couldn't say no to.  I felt like I ate way too much food, even though the plates were tiny.  The Shumai was ok, it has nothing on Top Gun's Shumai which is my favorite ever.  The shrimp dumplings at Imperial Garden are also superior but these were good.  The real star of my meal here was those crab claws, though.  I really loved those which is why I feel Ping Pang Pong gets four stars.

So my husband, who isn't a real dim sum fan outside of baked pork buns, or a fan of Asian food in general because he never had it in his native alien territory of Montana, found out I went here and now wants to go, so I'm happy to say I will drag him here soon and get some of those crab claws again.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,1,4,Q1-IX3-jlLvWCvi53ChwEw

Only available during lunch hours, little carts containing a vast variety of dumplings and other authentic foods circle around, going to each table. They open each lid and quickly describe what the container holds, you simply nod or say ""no thank you"". Whatever you chose is quickly put on your table, and the carts move on. It's very efficient and artistic in a way. 

Ok, the food itself: everything we had was good. My favorite was the steamed BBQ pork bun. I wish I had known a bit more, or would have been braver. It would have been great to have someone more familiar with the foods to help us , but I never felt unwelcome. Each server spoke English, and was nice. 

My only suggestion is that maybe they could have a menu for us newbies, so we could better understand what delicious little treats are hidden in each of those little pots. 

Pricing is very reasonable, hard to tell what each pot costs. They mark on a card each time you make a selection. I think we had 6 selections (each pot has about 3 dumplings). It was enough for 2 to share, and our bill was about $24.",gYrOhGguJ22lhxs8IX8xvg,1,0,4,28mwMe8XK9H6wgUPE4JJIA

I loved their dim sum. You name it, Har Gow, Siu Mai, noodles, spare ribs, baos, etc...it was all pretty good. What sucked was the popular items such as the Har Gow (shrimp balls) and Siu Mai (steaming dumplings) always ran out. Every cart that rolled through all said ""later"".

When my friend and I first got here (around 1130), we had to wait about 10-15 min before we could get some tea or even water to drink! It wasn't even that busy yet, and we were seated right away! Usually, at many dim sum places, it is automatic to get tea or water right away! Also, the carts did not come to our side very often, so we had to make sure to get plenty of things before we started really eating! (Especially the dessert cart! Geez! That one took forever to come by!).

The place is also pretty small. We can barely get into or out of our seats, since they were so close together (so I just stayed in mine the whole time without moving it heheh!). 

The only thing that I tried here that was not as common as other dim sum places was their soft tofu dessert with sugar/ginger syrup. It tasted like a Filipino dessert called Ta-ho (except Ta-ho is sweeter and not ginger-tasting). That was pretty good. They also had a seaweed salad, (which looked very good but didn't come until we were waiting for our check), and we couldn't try it! Other than those two, just your typical dim sum place with a limited quantity of items!

I probably would not go back here, especially if I ever have to wait! Geez...wait for a table...and then WAIT for a drink...and then WAIT for the dim sum...and even WAIT for our check/to go boxes! 

Unless you're with a big party, this place would probably be decent to have dim sum. Be ready to FLAG those cart people! Expect a wait on the weekends starting around 12 (We went on a Sunday). 

Btw, the price for most of the dim sum is about $3 a piece, so it could add up if you want to try lots of things...(They also charge for tea!)",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,1,0,3,TGXsyTCOB-fEiT0D5Y-Bnw

It can get a little busy during meal times, so if you want to avoid waiting in line, it is best to avoid popular eating times. We tried to go pretty early, so waiting in line wasn't too much of a problem. 

It is located in Gold Coast, so it is not as easy to access as some other places directly on the main part of the Strip. However, it is definitely worth going out of your way if you want to experience Chinese foods during your trip to Vegas.",1ao85GKiWKs1NbfZAtNEkg,1,0,4,TK6hKzPGwQSxVTOtpNXs-A

We met friends who are regulars there and we really enjoyed our Sunday brunch. We ate siu mai, hargow, shredded pork dumplings, pork ribs in black bean sauce, sesame shrimp dumplings, house special fried rice and bbq pork buns. It was all good and I was surprised at how good the food was. I usually avoid eating Asian food inside a casino because it's usually a poor interpretation of the original cuisine but Ping Pang Pong is certainly the exception. Good, fresh dim sum served in carts the way they should be. There was a line to get seated but our friends were already there so we didnt have to wait, thankfully. 

I really enjoyed all the things we had. They were mostly the typical things we order at dim sum restaurants we frequent in LA & SF except for the sesame shrimp dumplings and the shredded pork dumplings. Those 2 I havent had before and I really liked them both. The sesame shrimp one was little shrimps stuffed in rolled puff pastry. It was great. The shredded pork dumplings were like stuffed to the brim potstickers. They were tasty and were perfect with a soy sauce dip.

Service was friendly. We didnt feel rushed and our table was attended to at all times. Our drinks were refilled and anything we requested (chili sauce, lemon, etc) were brought to us rather quickly.

He reassured us that the place had the best dim sum in town and everyone who ate there were Asian and he's pretty much the only white guy.  Not being racist, but that's a good sign!  

Food wise: The ladies come around in their carts and it's typical dim sum.  Some were good and some were re-steamed.  You can always tell because the shell at this point is a bit too mushy or it has a texture that you know it wasn't so fresh.  Nonetheless there was a good selection.

Atmosphere:  Yes, it can get packed and yes, there were a lot of Asians that dined here.  I almost felt like I was back in Hong Kong with people just talking super loud and being kinda rude.  Haha...

Bottom line: If dim sum is what you're looking for and you want something a little more authentic, this is an option.  I know the casinos on the strip has plenty of Asian restaurants, but it's more catered to the ""tourists"" crowd.  This feels a little more homey.",kLDcF1QprLUcXC_QvRUEqg,2,1,3,1vwsFPPrV60-CqEH9fzVHg

Ping Pang Pong is located in the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino.  They serve dim sum from 10am to 3pm and reopen for dinner from 5pm to 3am.  We were able to catch dinner last Sunday.  Wait time was not bad at all.  However, service was not the best.  It was such a hassle to ask for anything besides placing our order.

We ended up ordering fried flounder fish, snow pea leaves with roasted garlic, and the satay beef with enoki mushrooms and pineapple.  Every thing was served family-style and arrived fairly quickly.  The fried flounder and pea leaves are things they always order.  It does not have strong flavors, but when paired with the dipping sauce it certainly hits the spot for a good home-cooked meal.

5629674,2013-04-19,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Two friends and I dined at Ping Pang Pong this week for dinner, and our expectations could not have been higher. I lived in China briefly and one of my accompanying friends is from the Philippines and her mother makes incredible Asian cuisine. So, when we heard that PPP was one of the most authentic and well-received Chinese restaurants in America, we couldn't wait to try it.

Immediately, I was pleased with our server, who noticed we were ordering things without meat and asked if we were vegetarians. We said yes, and she informed us that many of the items were cooked with chicken broth, but said she'd ensure it wasn't used in our dishes. Unfortunately, we concluded that the chicken broth must be Ping Pang Pong's top secret ingredient, because we were rather disappointed in our food! It pains me to say I've had better tasting meals at Panda Express.

Here's what we ordered and my thoughts on it:
-Wrinkled Green Beans: Bland, but nothing a little extra hot sauce couldn't fix. 
-Ma Po Tofu: Good seasoning but we would have preferred a firmer tofu over the squishy one.
-Sautéed Lotus Root: The fact it was described as ""pungent"" on the menu should have been a red flag. It was too crunchy and the taste of vinegar was over-whelming.
-Shanghai Noodles: We got it without the pork, and it was basically oily ramen. Big portions a plus, though.
-Rice: Dried out and hard!  
-Iced Chrysanthemum tea: It was akin to drinking potted plant water.
-Fresh Coconut Juice: It was on the menu, but apparently not available. I hate it when that happens.

Ultimately, I was disappointed with Ping Pang Pong and don't plan on returning. Another patron might have better luck ordering Dim Sum or a meat dish, as apparently both have been praised. However, I'll stick to other establishments/fly to China the next time I want authentic noodles/have my friend's mom cook for me! :D",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,0,1,2,jR6os_cgngeJP2_uFr0cRQ

As for the foods that they did have, my sister ordered the duck, I ordered the orange chicken, my brother-in-law ordered a brisket thing and our friend ordered the chicken chow mein. The cooks all make different foods and don't sync up the food to come out at the same time. So when an entree is done they bring it out to your table, even if the other entrees aren't ready yet. The duck came first, it was a few minutes before the orange chicken came out, and then another 5 minutes at least before the chow mein came out. This would be fine it you are eating family style and everyone is sharing everything, but if you are ordering and eating your own entree like we were it creates a big problem. You can either be rude and eat your food while it's hot, or be polite and wait for everyone to get their food while yours gets cold.

You will notice that I said my brother-in-law ordered a brisket something but I didn't mention when it got delivered. That's because we never got it! Another problem with the way they bring the food out is if they forget something, you just kind of assume it's still coming, and you don't think to ask about it. Our waitress never ordered the brisket, and we didn't discover this until it was too late.

As for the food itself, my sister was happy with the duck, but I didn't try it as duck is not my thing. The orange chicken was okay, but I've had much better.

Obviously being as our server forgot to order one of our entrees I'm not going to give the service a very high mark. Additionally, the atmosphere of the restaurant was really bad. It's located in the casino, very close to all the slot machines and casino action and as a result is very loud. It's a small space and they try to cram as many people in as possible so its very cramped and uncomfortable.

So to review, the food is bland but okay, the service and atmosphere sucks and if you go on Sunday night (and I would assume Saturday too) expect them to be out of everything.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,0,0,1,DhCkTMcP-YdafdC0i6r54A

Service here is decent, with about 4 to 5 carts of dim sum items to choose from.  Selection was good, but the quality of the dim sum is both good and bad.  Good is good, not great, as the dishes we enjoyed didn't wow us tremendously.  The bad dishes, unfortunately, left a lasting impression.  The included the following:

- Roast Pork - Though the skin was rather crispy, you can tell by the color and texture of the meat that it was reaheated.  It was not fresh despite the fact the cart lady chimed that the roast pork just came out of the oven/fire.

- Siu Mai - These steamed dumplings are traditionally made with seasoned ground pork, shitake mushrooms and shrimp.  There was no shrimp in these, and some of the siu mais were prepared in the way where a couple of them were dense, dry and hard to the chew.  

- Chinese Broccoli - The dish we got had broccoli that was not as thick as the ones on the other dish.  Chinese Broccoli, as it grows older, the stalks get thicker and the inside turns from translucent (tender) to white (old).  We needed some greens to balance the meal and tried this.  Aside from the issue with the age of the broccoli used, the preparation was fine.  But older broccoli is harder to chew through and can be awfully fibrous.

- XO Sauce Pan-Fried Rice Noodle Rolls - Seasoned well, but could have used more XO Sauce to give it a spicy kick.  The problem with the dish we got was that it was the last of it's type on a cart, uncovered, and must have sat on that cart for awhile.  It was cold, not as flavorful, and cold rice noodles dry up and harden.  Best to ask to test the temperature of the plate or dish these more exotic dim sum dishes are served on so that you can figure out if it's relatively fresh, or if it's been sitting around for a while.

Prices are higher, as expected, since this is a hotel restaurant.  With other dim sum palaces in Vegas, we probably won't be back.  It's OK to good, but there are better.",-qPxBYRKN-ca9RKzdDV8Dg,3,2,3,TllBmJr8S5_WPMxanZHOuQ

No we weren't here for a ping pong tournament nor were we in China neither!

We actually planned to eat here for a New Year's Eve dinner prior to playing the midnight bingo at Gold Coast Casino. I checked Yelp prior and the reviews appeared to be decent. 

When it comes to Chinese food and being Chinese-American, you can say I'm pretty picky. My older sister is even more so as she can cook some amazing Chinese dishes plus growing up with the two parents who both can whip out the best traditional Chinese dishes. My dad actually taught my mother to cook to begin with! I unfortunately never had any interest in learning to cook and I totally regret that now!

I had ordered quite a few entrees. The Gobo beef, Walnut shrimp, Ma po tofu, chicken with veggies, Singapore noodles and grilled lamb appetizers plus bowls of white rice which cost extra. What's up with that? We also had oolong tea and water. 

The only thing I was Totally, Totally amazed with was the quickness of us receiving our food!!! It was like minutes of ordering and open & close your eyes they appeared!!! Am I dreaming or what? No it actually happened and I saw it happened at several other tables surrounding us too.

My favorite entree was the gobo beef. I wished I ordered several of those as I could have had the entire plate to myself! I will definitely remember that for next time:)

This restaurant was closed between 3-5 pm so we had waited for a minimum of an hour for it to open. There was a huge line for both the to-go line and waiting to be served line for the restaurant prior to 5 pm.  They didn't have a special NYE up-charged menu which was nice unlike many others restaurants who did especially for NYE night. That's probably why they did so well that evening as they were extremely BUSY!!! Despite that fact the food still came out in record time.

I have to admit the food was quite tasty. Maybe a slight difference in taste but not bad though that I would knock down in stars. Our server was so busy that she disappeared for awhile as we needed to pay and leave.

***WARNING Don't pay attention about yelpers complaining about service. This is not PF CHANGS, or Applebee's.***

The entry level dim sum is good (KJ Kitchen at the RIO makes the simple stuff better currently--- their LO Bak Go is so er mah gawd!). Reading other reviews on here is so funny because of complaints about service. Want to be seated? Wave some one down, ask loud, better yell it in Cantonese. Don't expect them to ask if you want water or soda. Expect tea and only tea, unless you wave someone down and ask loud for cold water, same with refills. (Although they do bring you large water glasses and it tastes good. As a kid growing up Chinese, I used to think they scoop the water out of the fish tanks because it did taste a bit fish. That must be because they keep the ice machine behind the fish tanks. No fish tanks at PING PANG PONG hahahaha.)

 Bring someone Chinese with you if you are scared. Want more tea, shit you know what you have to do with the lid. Want to pay your check? Lift it in the air  ""Màaihdaan!!!!"" or go up to the Cashier and start picking your teeth with the tooth picks.

If there is old food lingering on your new plates... I wipe that shit off with hot tea and napkin.

What kind of service do people need? 

If I read one more review about Orange Beef.... If you go in there ordering General Tso's expect bad service. Tea, take dirty dishes away, bring my food. It's all good in the Chinese hood. If you're scared go to Elephant bar, Jose or Sean Jean will make you something nice there. I'm not racist I eat black chicken. 

Seriously about the service, you can have a good ole' dim sum time without making at the least bit eye contact. Oh and lastly, I think I read a review about hot mustard... do they have hot mustard? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. I'm not going to answer that expect a hahahahaha if you ask.

A couple of friends attending the jewelry trade show at the Mandalay had invited me to a nice quiet high end dinner at the Jasmine Restaurant at the Bellagio when , just as we were about to leave for the Bellagio, my friend received a business call saying their business contacts wanted to invite us for dinner instead.....and were too afraid to decline. All I knew was that I was asked to get in the car and just follow the leader.

Being the fish out of water, I didn't speak a or understand a word of Chinese and had no idea what the plan was. We eventually ended up off the strip at some big stand alone casino across from the Palms Hotel and Casino. As we walked into the casino from the parking garage, my friend whispered to me that the host was taking us to a Chinese restaurant, and if she eats hear you can bet it's going to be VERY good! The host has been living in Vegas for over 30 years so she should know where all the good eating spots are now.....ok, so in we go. This was a medium end casino, and as we walked through it we finally came upon this Chinese Restaurant called ""Ping Pang Pong""..... yes, you got that right....just as I've spelled it. Flashbacks of the movie ""16 Candles"" flashed through my head, but I'll leave that one alone :)

Tucked inside the casino is this very casual, very Chinese looking, restaurant with an open kitchen concept where you can hear the burners blasting away and the woks clanging away. The place was quite crowded, but it appeared our host knew everybody there and I was told she is a VIP guest there. We came to the table and there sat 4 other of her elderly friends already seating and waiting for us. Oh boy.....there goes my hopes for a peaceful and relaxing dinner. Ok, lets cut it short and say that it was a very typical large table seating for a group of elderly folk who enjoyed their meals with loud talk.....the red wine they were gulping down didn't seem to help matters either. Anyway, I did not understand a single word spoken at the table all night, but no worries.....I had food to keep me busy!......good authentic Chinese food at that! And note, when I say this is authentic food, I mean authentic.....PF Chang's and Panda Express are NOT authentic :P

I pretty much left the ordering to the host and her friends since they seemed to know what good Chinese food should taste like. Needless to say they ordered all very authentic dishes that westerners likely wouldn't have known how to order. Without going into too much detail about each dish.....because I really can't remember the names of each one......we started off with lotus root soup which was very good....absolutely delicious, and coincidentally is my favorite Chinese soup! There was a roast duck dish, lotus root stir fried with celery and rice wine sauce, egg white fried rice with dried scallops, stir fried cubes of beef with a dark brown sauce, ginger and scallion lobster over noodles, farm raised chicken cooked with chestnuts and rice wine, some green vegetables with baby abalone and sauce, sea bass steamed with black beans, ............and I think that was it. It was ALL yummy, and I was really surprised at finding this quality and standard of Chinese food all the way out here! But yes, it exists. Yay! :)

All these delicious dishes for 9 people came to about $295 before tips, which was actually pretty good given the excellent quality of the food.

Din Tai Fung was probably the closest (is that even considered dim sum?), but in the more typical joints where they come around with the trays, I've never been super impressed.  We decided to try Ping Pang Pong since it was in a casino, and we figured it would provide the necessary cleanliness that I find to be generally lacking in dim sum spots.  

We got there 15 minutes before they opened on Sunday, and there was a line of 3-4 parties waiting in front  of us.  By the time they opened, there were another 5-6 parties behind us.  Shortly after we began dining, the place was full.  Good sign.  The wait staff was surprisingly Chinese - I say that because this is inside the Gold Coast and I would have thought the wait staff would be more diverse - and resulted in a service very typical to other dim sum restaurants.  They spoke little English, and often called out the dish in Chinese even after realizing we were not Chinese.  The décor was clean and typically nice for a casino restaurant, so this part we enjoyed quite a bit - dim sum in a clean environment.

The food was actually quite good.  It was quite distinctly lacking of the dumplings and shumai that we were looking for, they just kept telling us it would come later and they would come in trickles.  But what did eventually come - shrimp shumai and shrimp & pork shumai - were very good.  But alas, no har gow, no rice noodle rolls with shrimp (they had one with beef...), and just not enough choices of these little pieces.  What they did have though, were interesting and not common.  Congee porridge is common, and theirs is good.  They have a large bowl for the table and a smaller bowl for one.  They had cooked congee in spice broth which were excellent, and clams in similar sauce that were great also.  Their souffle-type dessert (they only make 10 per day) was delicious, as well as the custard flavor rolls.

One big issue I had with them were that the dessert dishes started coming out first, and just kept coming around.  Why do they do that?  Bring out the porridge and dumplings first!  We kept having to tell them ""later, after we eat!"" as the dessert trays passed by probably at least half dozen times.  They've got to fix this.

But all-in-all a good meal, and our meal for 4 came to $49 plus tips.  That's not a bad deal, and perhaps I can overlook some of their glaring shortcomings.  3.5 stars is more appropriate, but I'll bump up a half based on the quality of what we actually did get to eat.

Table-for-1 Factor:  May be for regular lunch & dinner, but for the dim sum brunch it's probably not a great option.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,14,13,4,h-ZG4y3GlPYomYiVWzdLIQ

Idon't get how anyone can say that this dim sum is amazing, unless they've only had Vegas dim sum.  I'm sorry if I sound elitest... but take my word.  If you read my review you will know not to come here.  Chicken feet had an off taste as well as being kinda cold.  I guess most Vegas dim sumers are not fans of chicken feet.  The shui mai was just bad.  The tripe was overly braised and the texture (one of my favorite parts of tripe) was just bad.  It felt like I was eating fat, not tripe.

Nothing good here.  The only reason i gave it two stars was because it really is one  of the few dim sum places in Vegas.  The other one that got the better Yelp reviews was temporarily closed I guess the kitchen burned down or something.",Jndb3IoOrN-xj1QFxvKAcA,0,0,2,lKiGUd48GKYnQj_6c7mwCg

So our friend wanted to grab some dim sum at a place he was profusely gushing about.  I was pretty unimpressed as a Cantonese person and after the meal, he echoed my sentiments.  What's the big deal?  I suppose it's the best dim sum in Las Vegas but places in Arizona have impressed me more.  I can't believe we drove all the way to Gold Coast to try this place!

It may be because we were here for dim sum on a Thursday but the food was pretty cold despite being in steam carts.  We tried a wide variety of dishes and the salt water dumpling, egg tarts, and the chicken feet were the only ones that were particularly good.  Salt water dumpling is always good because they're fried, the egg tart is generous with custard filling, and the chicken feet had a good sauce on them.  Plus, they were really plump!  I did find the roe on the siu mai and other various dumplings to be interesting.  They didn't add much the dish themselves but it was okay.

Service is that of all dim sum places: basic.  They do treat Cantonese and Mandarin speakers a lot better than the English speaking customers. 3.5 stars!",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,42,39,3,vF3AJQDTiaO_uVB3cO6YHw

We made a special trip from the Strip, arriving at 11h00 on a Friday morning. About half the tables were occupied. We were seated immediately. No trouble with the service - drinks and the carts arrived quickly. We selected the sticky rice, shrimp pastry, bbq pork bun, pork siu mai and the shrimp har gow. The sticky rice was acceptable, and I did enjoy the shrimp pastry. The other items were not to my liking.  It seemed that the ingredients were of poor quality, as opposed to the skill of the chef in preparing them.

We have enjoyed dim sum in many different cities and countries, as we try to make a point of having it at least once per trip. On this same trip we went to Noodles in Bellagio; while it was twice as much (almost to the penny), we enjoyed it much more than Ping Pang Pong.   It is unlikely that we would return, because it's not worth the hike from the strip for this level of quality.",A0kENtCCoVT3m7T35zb2Vg,0,0,2,FwiJ7DQ3a9cBwp1OYlP5VA

First off, the seating procedure is absolutely terrible. You wait in a line with a bunch of other people, whose parties can range from a small group of two to a large group of eight. Yet no one comes to sort out these groups and so because that group of eight is going to wait forever, you're waiting forever with them. 

When you're finally seated, you notice that there are two different rooms. If you're lucky, you'll be in the room near the kitchen, and you'll get your food. If not, you'll be waiting forever only to realize that those ladies with the carts are only going around the first room. 

However, I will say that their food is pretty good. Of all the dim sum I've tried in Vegas, this is probably the best one. They have a pretty good selection of dim sum, although I would say that their tripe is not that great. But I do really like their other dishes.

5871864,2010-11-10,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"This restaurant is located in The Gold Coast Hotel Casino and turned out to be our favorite.  With the sad (but finally improving) state of Chinese food in SW Florida we needed to get our fill and ate here three times.

Things got off to a shaky start.  Four of us ordered; Seafood Crispy Noodles ($10.95), Tea Duck, (half $12.95) Beef Lo Mein ($9.95) and Ma Po Tofu ($7.95).  It was a Saturday night and the place was busy but our order was taken promptly.  Interestingly after a reasonable wait we inquired about our food and it miraculously started to arrive, albeit one dish at a time making it seem like the order was never entered.  

The duck was cooked to a crispy goodness but was served without any dipping sauces - Hoisin was brought on request.   The two noodle dishes were large portions with the seafood noodle including ample pieces of fish, Scallops, Squid.  The fourth dish Tofu was a complete no-show with a different server offering to get it but advising the ""kitchen is slammed"", we declined and the check was adjusted accordingly.

Lunch here is Dim Sum served from a parade of steaming carts.  We tried some old favorites and few new things.  All was fresh and presented with care.  We tried a favorite of many Asians; Chicken Feet and now realize this is an acquired taste, however the fried rice served with it was the absolute best we ever had.  So that's how fried rice should taste!  We ate our fill and had many items with the bill for two at just $30.00.  If you've never had a traditional Dim Sum meal this is definitely the place.

One more dinner visit included our all time favorite Beef Rice Flat Noodles ($9.95) also known as Chow Fun served ""wet"".  The beef was tender and the noodles just delicious coated in the light flavorful gravy.  This dish included a few large pieces of perfectly cooked Gai Lan.  With this we had Orange Beef ($9.95) cooked just slightly crisp with an outstanding flavor.  We stuffed ourselves to help prolong the memory.

They claim to be Las Vegas' ""best"" Chinese restaurant and the fact that on each visit we were just about the only non-Asians there would seem to prove them right.",HjlmwNPgoeXhSMh0Zl-zcw,2,0,4,E1gccHyVqyYM3Ka5ncuYfA

We went back the next morning but they weren't open and then we went back a third time and then had to wait a while and they did not notice anyone in line waiting for a table. We ordered out as it had gotten busy with all Chinese people celebrating the day after Chinese New Year. The food took quite a while (we could have eaten a lot if we had just sat down), a few dishes I wanted like egg tart, sponge cake, leaf wrapped rice, they did not have but overall their dim sum was really good. They have won best Asian 2009 which is quite a feat for most restaurants. 

Their baked BBQ pork buns were so fresh and tasty I had dreams about them only 1/2 hour after eating them. Because of these buns I am willing to take a bit of abuse from lousy service. Their pineapple  buns and custard baked buns were also really fresh. Their steamed BBQ pork and custard buns were good too. Their beef rice roll was small but good and their beef balls were only OK. 

They had tons of authentic style dishes that my parents would love (but I don't), in fact I will tell them to stay at this hotel so that they can be close to their own food as they always complain they can't get any decent chinese rice anywhere.

5917264,2015-12-30,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"This is one of the best dim sum spots in Vegas. The food is always good, and has average prices. However, there are several drawbacks to Ping Pang Pong. 

The first, is that unless you get there right when it opens, you will have to wait in line. The line can sometimes take 10 minutes, but more often it will take much longer. This can be infuriating at times, because they have two sides to the restaurant and often keep people in line when half the restaurant is still empty. I understand that they don't want half the restaurant unattended by employees, but this place is so small that really shouldn't be a problem. 

Second, service is hit or miss. At times, they are attentive and you don't have to wait long to get your food. But at others, you can wait a long time before you get any food, or your drinks refilled. When it's busy, you need to leave your table with your food ticket and basically attack the food servers, since dim sum is brought out on carts. If you don't then you might not get food for a while. 

Third, while most things are great here, especially the char siu bao (bbq pork bun) and dessert buns, there are also things which are sub-par. The most disappointing is the lo mai gai (stuffed sticky rice). While it works in a pinch, I don't recommend getting it here.

All in all, this is a good place to come for dim sum, just make sure you arrive early and are ready to attack the servers for food.",k5w9EN9OOr0iM_xpu57a-Q,2,0,4,XAyGWNZewhumhcCpI2Yu1Q
5918508,2010-11-08,1,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"Have read so many mixed reviews about PPP from my fellow Yelpers in Las Vegas, and I finally went to try it with some schoolmates and guests.  The line wasn't too bad for us, and we were seated shortly, even though it was on a Sunday at ~11:30am.

The restaurant itself seems small, especially compared to the other dim sum options i Vegas.  The price overall is more expensive, and is to be expected for a restaurant located inside a casino (Gold Coast).  The per person charge for tea is only $0.50!  That is the lowest I have ever seen, even compared to off-strip dim sum joints.  But then they do make it up on everything else you can order.

The wait staff is friendly, but I think they are assigned way too many tables to watch over, especially the busperson, since our emptied plates rarely gets picked up after we finished whatever dim sum we had ordered, and the table looks like it is in a constant state of disarray. Not exactly adding to the mood of the meal. But our water glass was refilled on a regular basis, which is good. That applies to the tea pots as well.

Food-wise, I think it is just okay.  There were some highlights but also many that was not worth ever trying again.  The Panfried Shrimp and Chive Dumpling was excellent. The ""fat noodles"" stirred fried with XO Sauce (my pinyin sucks but I will try to type it... Stir Fried ChanFun with XO Sauce) is good and we ended up ordering two plates. HarGow (Steamed Shrimp Dumpling), was made with great fillings, but the skin was way too thick and you can tell that the cooks or prep cooks that make them lack the skills normally developed over many years of making dim sum.  But what do you expect from a casino restaurant that might have a really good chef, but the rest of the kitchen are cooks, prep cooks, etc that are just happy to still have a job in a state that has stupidly high unemployment rate.

Anyway, back to the food. They seem to have trouble keeping up with the demand for the essential dim sums (steamed shrimp and steamed pork dumplings), since we didn't see the Hargow until we were almost ready to get them to tally up our bill. And the Shuimai never made it to the area we were seated until we were collecting money from everyone at the table.

I did kind of enjoyed their Green Tea Mochi Cake, although the mochi was on the thick side. But I have never had this at any other dim sum restaurants in the US. The Mango Coconut Tapioca was good, according to my friend (I didn't try it).

And even though we have a party of 8, they did NOT automatically add in the ""mandatory"" service charge/tips.  I think that was cool, but we paid over the 15% anyways.

Overall, just a 3 stars dim sum experience for me, and I will likely not returned for just dim sum. But it is nice to eat at a dim sum place that at least have above average customer service.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,3,3,3,n2MoTracTgHefF4XxrD6yA

5939142,2012-01-04,4,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,"People in Las Vegas are usually too drunk or just not smart enough to realize what bad service looks like. 

I have been coming here for 3 years because the Gold Coast comps me all the time. The Food has always been 5-stars, but the service is so bad that in the last 2 years, I have NEVER left a tip. And everyone around this town knows I am a big tipper. I mean, my local sushi spot is a place in NW Las Vegas called ""Sushi Bomb"". The chefs and servers are so friendly and nice to me that even though my bill comes out to $32.00, I will pay with a $100 and tell them to keep the change. So Yes, I am not afraid to tip if the service is that good. 

What is wrong with Ping Pang Pong? At 1st I thought it was a cultural misunderstanding. I noticed that most the workers speak barely any English and most are from Mainland China and not Taiwan(Taiwanese restaurants are always much more friendly). But, even other Chinese people who come here get into big fights with the servers and complain all the time about how bad the service is. 

Common problems here: 
-You go up to the counter and wait for the host to seat you or put you on the list. 15 minutes later, the host will not come over. She won't even give you eye contact or say: ""I will be right with you"". When the host finally comes she doesn't even know how to seat you. You would think that since this has been her job for the last 2-3 years she would have finally figured out how to do it right, but somehow she still hasn't got it down. Common sense says that the person at the front of the line should be the person you should service, but she will just pick a random person at times. 
-Many times(and this happens a lot) a drunk from the casino who doesn't have the coherency to stand in line will attempt to cut infront of you. The server WILL seat him instead even though you shout at her that the drunk cut in line. 
-After waiting about 40minutes, you will get seated. After that you will have to wait another 15-20 minutes for your server to come take you order. 
-Another 35-40minutes later your food will finally arrive. Sometimes(and this happens a lot also) your food will NEVER arrive, and you will have to complain to the servers. They somehow lose your orders a lot here. If your order does come, many times the order will be WRONG. This is a headache because now you will have to wait another 30 minutes for the right one to come out.
-Once the server takes your order, you will NEVER see another server come around ever again. If you want srirachi or water...tough luck because no ones is gonna get it for you! No one will ever even come around 1 time to check up on you or ask you if there is anything you need. Yet, these people still expect a tip?
-If there is a mistake with the bill(example-they charged you for something you didn't order-And this happens here a lot too), the staff speaks such limited English that is will take forever for you to get them to understand  what your problems is.


Now the thing I see a lot is that many people will complain about all of the things I listed above. They will complain about how bad the service is, yet they will still leave a tip! By leaving a tip you are just encouraging them to keep up their rude, lazy and incompetent service.  Okay I will admit that The food here at Ping Pang Pong is the best Chinese Food in the world....So it is only justified that the service should meet up to the standards of how good the food is. So my solution to end the bad service here for good is to STOP TIPPING until they learn. 

I know the management reads these things. They know who I am. I am the guy who wears the Burberry Coats and I usually show up with  2 extremely tall Japanese and Korean-Americans. We come almost every week.

At Ping Pang Pong, they take their dim sum quite seriously. At least I'm pretty sure their dim sum is among the best I've ever had. I love how they add these bits of salted shrimp to their taro cake for flavor. Yum.

It seems a bunch of the older casinos in Vegas have a 'hidden gem'; Ping Pang Pong is Gold Coast casino's. We went there for lunch & there was this mega queue of Azn ppl (as myself), a queue that stayed long, long after we were done eating lunch (we stayed to play a bit of Wheel of Fortune). I figured this meant that a continuous stream of people kept coming in - & that that's maybe because the food is good. The things I learn from watching Sherlock.

TIP: How do you skip the super long line at Ping Pang Pong? No, this isn't that non-PC joke

If you spot a big empty table that will seat you/your group & the people in front of/behind you, consider befriending them, at least temporarily, for the purpose of sharing the table.

We cake with a large group which allowed us to get just about everything available to try. Service was good and the carts come around frequently allowing you to get to try everything that's available. 

The new renovation is a definite step up from the previous space.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,11,4,RKcWLuxVl52PD2hlWqYQHg

The restaurant was so busy which made the service extremely bad. I can understand it is frustrating when it is so busy, but they really need better management. Also, no child chair, no more of food we wanted and the time of delivery of dishes were late.",BkpDRzk_8wiLfhq1Y3UlXQ,0,0,1,aWXlkSv1E9RKW4idGXRhBg

Other than that, the food is ehhhh alright and pretty expensive for dim sum. The char siu bao was fluffy, but that was really the only good thing we had. The chicken feet were more rubbery than I like, and the har gow wrappers were dry and too thick. I just went yesterday and I already can't remember what else we ordered, it was that forgettable. 

We were two people and were seated at the end of the route, so there was never anything left by the time they got to us. We kept watching as the large groups ahead of us kept taking the last of the items we wanted. We only got some items after the large group was finished eating and left. They should put more of the popular items in the cart so there are enough to go around the restaurant.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,3,1,2,5Wq4nrtqYzpj6FRpPEOSUg

It's a small place inside a casino - never imagined this place would be inside a casino.  Got here because a friend of the family suggested this place.  I have not seen the variety that this dim sum place has, i.e. dim sum in Miami or NYC.  We had from siu mai, pork buns, yellow cake, chicken feet, custard buns, sticky rice in lotus leaf, and many more items some included sea urchin!!  they have a great variety of items, food is hot because the carts are always walking around and you can choose what you like to eat or try.  90% of the crowd is chinese, good sign!!!

I'm primarily giving them one star because of one particular employee.  I phoned in a takeout order of Singapore noodles.  They were not very good.  
I show up 25 minutes after placing order.  The idiot cashier says its not ready yet and asks me to pay now.  I give her a $20 bill and she gives me back $5 & 99 cents in change.  The bill was $14.02.  In the real world and especially the restaurant industry you never hand back 99 cents in change. (It should've been 98 cents). Its a big insult, especially in a business that does such volume.  So here I am to publicly shame this very rude and unintelligent employee.  I think its a greedy cultural thing however we're in the US. In Europe they round to nearest 5 cents.  All principle here.",4_h5AwPKPkv3J9CL7E5x2w,0,0,1,lcOPldQLKdipyvdtJzG_-w

The place was pretty packed and if one of my friends weren't bossy or the other one didn't speak Chinese I feel like we would've been more ignored. But we were seated right away and at first the carts kept passing us by. We all were confused and kept saying hello we want some foods from there. Not until our friend spoke in Chinese did these ladies with the carts come by and were nice to us. 

The food was good and cheaper than any other dim sum place I've ever been to in Vegas. We all paid $7 plus tip which wasn't too bad. 

We were on a time crunch so we had to quickly get out of there but they didn't feel our urgency even as my friend got up several times to let them know we needed the check. 

I'm not sure I want to come here without someone who speaks Chinese in peak hour. Maybe one day I'll be brave and have my parents come try this place.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,0,3,Kbd-ym-dXGaoR9J8H-RxeA
