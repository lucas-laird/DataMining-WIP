Service was prompt, attentive, without being intrusive. 

Place seemed to attract some regulars, which is always a positive sign.

It is tucked away next to Kosters finance on Blue Diamond between Arville and Decatur. They have a great lunch menu offering bento boxes, sushi specials and the usual protein or veggies with teriyaki sauce and the fixings of miso soup and salad. They do not offer AYCE but their speciality rolls are buy 2 get 1 free making it very reasonably priced without the pressure of stuffing your face to get your money's worth out of AYCE prices. The fish is fresh, and rolls  wonderfully crafted with the right amount of rice to fish ratio. They also have a special on their beverages; buy one large Sapporo and get a free bottle of sake to share. The rolls vary in price, but average at about $10/$11 per roll.. of course if taking advantage of their special that brings the average prices down by a bit.

My mom just moved here from Japan (where I grew up) and I've had a really hard time finding a sushi spot that impresses her. We were both really happy tonight. Not only were the pieces really fresh but they were nice and thick as well. Looking forward to coming back. If the quality is always this good then I'd have to say that this is one of the better sushi places in town. 

Update: Went back exactly one week later and ordered the same sashimi platter and the cuts were not as fresh and were not nearly as thick. It was still fresh but with the cuts being smaller, it's going to be hard spending the money on the sashimi platter again. Also the nigiri was smaller as well. I'll give it another try. They had two chefs there and I'm not sure if we had one the first week and then the other the second. Notice the slits in the nigiri in my pictures. The nigiri didn't have those the second time we went. Hmmmm. Dropped it a star because of this.",day9dFcIcPr0KjcxjugKaA,2,1,4,k_hhoZG9xHJJguY51V1mcQ

Any hoot and holler I always thought the location was an odd choice to open up a sushi place because it's not the busiest shopping center but hey let's hope it helps attract business. 

The small Resturant was just that ""small"" as soon as you open the door you have to duck under this Japanese curtain thing they have over the front of the door whenever entering or existing the establishment which is kindda in the way in my opinion. Staff greets you immediately and you don't go far to be seated. There is a sushi bar with pull up stool in the back right corner of the Resturant which makes up most of the place and table with booth type seating on either safe of the room. 

The menu is simple with quit a few options to tickle your taste buds. I came with my pregnant wife and 1 year old daughter. So naturally we asked for cooked sushi roll suggestions and the waitress was more then helpful. 

We order a few Special sushi to receive a free roll and a Teriyaki chicken bento box. Ok so it is pretty awesome to find a good, affordable place to grab a quick bento box I mean this box is a perfect fix and comes with all the goodies. Teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, tempura veggies and shrimp and a good size sushi roll. A great portion of food all for about $11 or $12 on top of that you get a cup of miso soups as well. With had a great taste with small bits of tofu floating in it. 

Besides the curtains in the entrance all in all it was a good little joint that I will defiantly come back to. The food was good, the Resturant was nice and the staff was friendly. Please come and try them I would love for them to stick around.

I don't know if I'm reading into this or not, but there seems to be an extremely high turnover rate among servers here. I don't think I've ever seen the same person twice.

Their buy two get one free roll selection is extensive. We ordered the Monkey Brain, Caterpillar, and Spicy Girl roll and the lowest priced roll was free. All 3 rolls tasted fresh and had delicious sauce. Come here for their rolls!

The sushi was a hit and miss. The Chu Toro sushi (one piece) was fantastic! The Uni (two pieces) was good but small. The Aji was ok. The Hotate (two pieces) lacked texture (more like mush) and did not taste fresh. It was also missing a citrus seasoning. This was listed on their blackboard special but turned out to be a disappointment. Also, the sushi rice fell apart easily...

Overall, it's a 3.5 stars place due to their sushi quantity and quality. The service brings it up to 4 stars.

Let me start by saying, this food here is good it just wasn't 5 star good. I have been looking for a new AYCE but haven't found one that I'm in love with so I thought I would give this place a try. 

I ordered the volcano that everyone raves about and was given something else entirely. When I mentioned to the chef that I didn't think that this is what I had ordered and I thought that it had shrimp tempura in it (as opposed to the crab/mayo mix), he told me ""oh, that's something else."" -Well, not according to the pictures on Yelp. I'll never know how good it is because I wasn't given one. I didn't hate what I got. It just wasn't my thing and unfortunately it didn't appear that I had a choice and for $13.95 I was annoyed. Look at the picture that I posted and the picture of every other volcano...

I also ordered yellowtail and scallop nigiri. Both were okay but there was too much rice and the rice seemed chilled. (NOT a good thing) Since I was still hungry, I ordered a Salmon hand roll. Again, nothing to write home about, cold rice. I spent over $40 with tip and didn't even get what I wanted. 

The food was average.
The atmosphere was average
The service was just below average (but came with a warm smile)
-and this is the kicker - 
The price was above average.

I don't mind paying top dollar for top quality, presentation and atmosphere but it just wasn't there. I regret not trying out a new AYCE place instead, at least if I didn't like it much, I would have gotten to order more Nigiri, soup, salad AND a roll for less $. Overall, I've just had better.

It might be okay for the buy 2 get one free roll deal or bento boxes or various soups, but for the hardcore sushi lover, not so much....",CiPLSXLY2T3-bufr8ml5DQ,4,1,2,BgnozqjUTTWcjFjPqxQmrw

Unfortunately, there was one server that kinda killed he whole vibe. I read one review and it seems they've described her as well. She basically just dropped off the menu on our table and left. The older Asian lady was much, much nicer...so she saved it.

3907109,2015-08-05,3,NTtLuuBKpywlyIz6oyd9kg,"Went here the other day for lunch and Sawa Sushi did not disappoint!  They are much like other Sushi restaurants offering similar foods, however, the quality of the servings, quantity and presentation were totally top notch!  The room setting is somewhat small, but comfortable enough and cozy enough to have small talk conversation.

One thing I noticed is immediately when you walk in, you're greeted with a banner in your face.  Not a bad thing, just kind of different I guess.  I'm not sure if it's there on purpose or a gag, but something we chatted about at lunch with my colleagues.  Aside from that a very easy menu to read and order.

My entree consisted of the Teriyaki Chicken Bento Box and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  Check out my picture posted to see how generous the portions were.  I didn't leave an ounce of food unfinished.  I especially really enjoyed the side salad part of my dish.  Usually the side salads at Japanese restaurants miss the beat in my opinion, but Sawa Sushi delivered ten fold.  It had a hint of thousand island and Italian vinegarett?  It was a very good dressing whatever it was, forgot to ask.  So good I've been craving it again for the last two days.

The wife had chicken potstickers and that was just as good.  Very few times do I enter a restaurant where I'm truly amazed at every dish that comes out.  All of it was delicious!  I haven't stopped thinking about come back for two days now.  I guarantee I'll see myself coming back many more times.",u90s9wJ9pMK2FMpy5F8Wpg,7,3,5,Ng59LpkJmJaafhn99gJ_Rw

We looked over the menu and order water. When the waitress came, we both ordered bento boxes which were recommended. I don't like miso soup, so I asked for a double serving of the ginger salad, and the waitress said not a problem. I also ordered a Sapporo. The waitress brought out our salad and soup, and there was a creamy white dressing on my salad, I asked what it was and she stated it was a creamy dressing, I explained that I asked for ginger dressing and she ran to the back to fix. After a few minutes wait, she came back with a salad that had what looked like a soy sauce/oil dressing on it. I have to say it was absolutely awful!!! It tasted like salty, oil and dirt. I then motioned the waitress to let her know I still hadn't received my Sapporo, which I now needed to wash down the dirt taste in my mouth. 

After about 15 minutes, we were served our bento boxes, which although looked appetizing had no flavor. I stopped eating and so did my friend. Within 10 minutes, both of our stomachs were turning, and we immediately left the restaurant.

Cold winter nights ignite my adventurous side to seek out new dining. Craving sushi I stumbled upon this humble & unassuming restaurant.

A personal favorite, the chu toro is quite simply brilliant! Soft, succulent & quite delightful, the chu toro is something that I'll be fantasizing about tonight. 

The broad range of specialty rolls & the buy two get one free will leave you feeling stuffed. Craving spicy tuna after the chu toro I opted for the Baja roll, bonzai & spicy sea. Whilst the Baja & spicy sea delivered a little heat, neither came close to bonzai's. The siracha & jalapenos are subtle enough & meshes with the overall flavor. Their creations are for all to enjoy.

In a sense i'm glad no more having to find ways to hide my last few pieces in miso soup bowls or flattening them under two plates hahaha oh boy.... My friend wanted to get some sushi, and she saw sawa and guys it is sowwwaaa

Setting: A decaying ""grand opening sign"" is latched on the back of the restaurant, its right by the in n out on blue diamond. When you first walk in, they have that japanese mini curtain hit you in the face which my first instinct is ""this is covered with face and dirty hair"" so careful of that when you walk in. Pretty standard looking with the sushi bar and a few tables around.

Service: We had a younger white female server that just dropped off the menus to our table and walked away. So i was like ok.... morale here is bad. A different asian lady had come by later who provided better service by just being cordial. They had served as cucumber salad, and i asked if i could just seaweed or just anything else (i had cucumbers) and the chef had told the server he would charge me to replace it. Not a big deal but it would've been appreciated if he had accommodated. 

Food: They have deals here if you buy 2 rolls you get 1 free but I am not a roll eater whatsoever, so we got the Sawa Boat. $40 boat (chef selection of fish) but we were served standard pieces of nigiri and sashimi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail). The quality of the fish was pretty decent.

As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were warmly greeted by the waitress and the sushi chef. The waitress gave us a couple of seating options and took our drink orders right away. Our food came out quickly and our drinks were continuously refilled. The waitress was friendly and attentive. 

The menu here is great, offering a large selection of sushi, 55 types of rolls (!), and ramen among other items. Everyone will find something to enjoy here. 

I started with a House Salad with creamy dressing and Edamame. The salad was packed with greens and other vegetables. The dressing on top was delicious. 

We shared a Crispy Rice Roll, a Spicy Girl Roll, and a Godzilla Roll. All of them tasted great and tasted fresh. The Crispy Rice Roll was my favorite. It was crisp without being greasy.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,5,5,4,lZnQ8VM75CCdG180UtdH_g

I ordered HOT GREEN TEA to drink and it came warm.  In fact barely warm.  I could barely taste the tea- tasted more like just water.  Started with CALAMARI and it came like onion rings.  No tentacles- and the only dipping sauce they gave with it was this tabasco looking thing.  My son had YAKITORI and it was hardly tasty.  It was good it had sauce on it.  My Godfather ordered this this SUSHI COMBO.  We both had MISO SOUP....it lacked taste but at least it was hot.  It tasted like those instant MISO SOUP you add water to and like too much water was added.  My BENTO BOX- omg...the so-called Grilled Beef Teriyaki ...looked like wet beef- no taste.  The salad was your typical mixed greens and the  dressing is really important and that was like it was mayo mix IDK what flavoring it had.  The Tempura: Shrimp looked like it was on the skinny side, one tiny sweet potato, one tiny broccoli and I think a small zucchini.  The Tempura dipping sauce- it was not watered down correctly because it was too strong, and too sweet.  The Cali Rols was ok.  
I would have ordered more to see if maybe something else might have been good...but at this point I was already turned off. 
I usually try a place a couple of times just in case they were having a bad day with their service or whatever but BLEH!",LT1Lsa0zLR7RkPUGsLiy3w,3,0,2,dNbHndihE1wnoxf-gJByvw

FOOD-Their signature rolls are always buy two get one free which is great deal. I find the quality of the sushi extremely delicious for the price. Taste like most sushi joints around the city . My boyfriend, my cousin, and her friend all enjoy this place as well. They also have some great combination platters if you don't want just rolls. They do not have all you can eat sushi. 

DRINKS-If you buy a large Sapporo you get a house sake for free. In my personal experience with ALL house sake's, they are never the best tasting sake's but it's free and it taste great for free. They also have delicious Arnold Palmer's which can either be raspberry flavored or regular depending on what they have that day. 

SERVICE-Every time I have been in they have the same kind waitress with dark hair who always has a smile on her face and it's nice to everybody. The chefs are also very friendly if you choose to sit at the bar. Great service all around. 

PARKING-Plenty of parking as this place sits in a shopping parking lot

ATMOSPHERE-Small, cute and clean. Nice music playing while you eat.

When I drove up, the Sapporo sign, showing through their front window was soo inviting that I decided to eat there.  As a matter of fact,  Sapporo was the first thing I ordered.   Unfortunately,  they ran out of Sapporo.   What a bummer... that's ok cuz I decided to take a bento box to go and drink my own beer at home (cheaper).  

I ordered the teryaki beef bento box and added an order of  spicy tuna roll.  They did not hold back on the amounts.   Geez, for under $20 I felt I came out winner.   Teriyaki sauce and tempura sauce were on point.  Didn't care too much for the salad and the california roll.  Everything else is what I expect of a bomb bento box; vegetable and shrimp tempura,  miso soup and rice.   

My goto spot for Japanese take home for sure.  I suggest calling your order in instead of waiting.   Gets uncomfortable waiting for food to go when there isn't a waiting area.    

 I'll give another review when I actually eat there but definitely going to call first to make sure they got Sapporo.   Can't imagine stuffing myself with sushi without it.",_enjdNDnH6MlLIOT6G7Jsw,3,1,4,R56jFKY1cA5nxMdbz2XTcw
5029812,2018-03-12,0,NTtLuuBKpywlyIz6oyd9kg,"We stopped in here on out way out of town as we headed back to San Diego. It was about 2om, so it wasn't very busy and we got seated right away. 

The place is small, but the ambiance is nice. There is a small sushi bar towards the back and tables in the rest of the space. There was only 1 waitress, but she was prompt on serving us. 

My husband ordered a Tonkotsu Ramen, and I ordered the Tuna Tataki. My sushi came out about 5 minutes before his ramen, so I waited for his until I started eating.

I loved the tataki. The sauce had just enough of a kick to make the dish appetizing but didn't make the taste unbearable. There were 12 pieces, which for $13 (I think) is a deal. The tuna was on top of a bed of rice noodles and they were also delicious.

My husband's ramen was a bit plain. There was no egg, no hearts of palm, no seaweed, no pickled ginger, none of the regular items you usually find in tonkotsu ramen. On the upside, the pieces of meat in the soup were very generous. He ordered his spicy, and said the same as my dish, that it was just spicy enough to make the dish taste really good. He was disappointed though about not having an egg and asked for one on the side. They apparently didn't have any boiled so he ended up finishing his soup before our waitress came back over and apologized that the egg would be another 5-10 minutes. She offered him another piece of pork, but he passed on it since he was already finished with his soup.

Overall, we may be back when we come into town again, but he won't be getting the soup.",JqaIH8O6i9OOXgEvwzLVsg,0,0,4,6CdA0D9smHISZZ7OvSb0CA

So happy to have found our date night spot. Highly recommend coming here!",pWNIcge9NjOsX2qwRNs0bg,1,2,5,s0MnELtdeAd_ktlm-RKrag
5447570,2015-04-02,0,NTtLuuBKpywlyIz6oyd9kg,"Quality and freshness wise I would say this place is on par with the ""all you can eat"" deals you find all around town here.  I thought the portions are a bit small considering the prices. 

They are running a buy 3 speciality rolls for the price of 2 as a grand opening special. If you're able to take advantage of the special deal, the place seems more worthwhile. I don't recall seeing if they offered an AYCE option at this place. 

Service was fine, servers were helpful, courteous, and attentive.

5546227,2016-11-21,0,NTtLuuBKpywlyIz6oyd9kg,"I have been without sushi in 6 months (working at a lake in Oregon) & needed a fix. We used to go to Hamada's on Flamingo but they are no longer open. So we checked Yelp! and found Sawa. 

It was in a shopping center so I wasn't so sure but we were starving so in we go. The sushi chefs are so friendly & welcoming! I'm getting more confident! And if you get a large Soporo, you get a free saki! That really says welcome!! Steven was our guy. He was fast & they were made well. 

Big menu with all the standard sushi selections. We started with 2 nigiri salmon (me) & 1 nigiri red snapper (him). The pieces aren't huge but a good one bite (2 for me). The salmon was very good-favorite and the red snapper was topped with a very tart marinade-not my favorite. 

My husband also got a Bento Box with chicken teriyaki. It also came with salad-good but needed more dressing, miso soup- so delicious we got one to go , 2 pieces shrimp tempura-good crunch & excellent flavor & 2 pieces vegetable tempura-amazing (the sweet potato-YUM-another favorite! It also came with a scoop of rice & a California roll (which we don't normally get but was really good!)

I also got a spicy tuna roll. The nori was too chewy like it had been open too long but the flavor was still ok.

The beer & saki, 3 nigiri sushi, HUGE bento box of food, the roll & extra miso soup to go came to $50. Good price for all the food we got. Maybe not the biggest or best we've had but good- food 3.5, Steven 4.5 so round to 4. We were full  & definitely will come back.",2z2A6ayPZmlVwZFK-uz60w,1,0,4,xx-GK4ig-rf64BEedlv-PA

5574633,2016-10-24,1,NTtLuuBKpywlyIz6oyd9kg,"The place is small but nicely decorated, great atmosphere and comfortable. Our server was a nice lady - we think she was Japanese. And that made me all excited because it's gotta be authentic! Most sushi restaurants here now are mostly own by Korean or Mexican sushi chef, although that's not necessarily bad at all but I'm just saying I'm expecting something authentic here at Sawa. 

However, I'm extremely disappointed at their sushi. It was very tiny and seemed poorly made. I said that because in Las Vegas now there's AYCE sushi everywhere. If you're not doing AYCE, you should provide higher quality or quantity of ingredients, and better presentation. For what I'm paying for, I wasn't satisfied with my sushi at Sawa. 

I ordered 3 different sushi, but they were made and delivered in 3 separate times. I have never been to a place that done that unless I sat at sushi bar, which felt little odd. So they were just tiny sushi, tiny fish on top, and no presentation what so ever. The fish was good though very fresh.

We also ordered hamachi kama. That was very very good. I would recommend order this instead of sushi for sure.

Hot tea is NOT complimentary - it's $2.25 per person. It was authentic good quality matcha. 

So if I'm craving for sushi - If I'm really hungry I would go somewhere AYCE. If I'm just having a little crave for raw fish, I would go for Soho because they're always generous on their portion with great quality. I wouldn't come back for sushi at Sawa again.",_KJRnZAxwEPyPhgJzQOxYA,6,1,3,03NJKzOKincMQCqBJ2iU4A

-the albacore looked spoiled 
-the yellow tail didn't look fresh. 
-while looking over at our table whispering words and shanking their hands definitely made us feel as tho we shouldn't have done what we did such as return food that as not suppose to be served!
DID I MENTION-they put that fish back into their fish area after being out on our table(how did they know if we didn't touch it?) We actually ate/touched the pieces GROSS!!!!

5745687,2018-06-06,0,NTtLuuBKpywlyIz6oyd9kg,"It's time for you to hire a new chef. Tonight we heard repeatedly that the chef is new. I would give you zero stars if that was an option. 

My husband and I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Bento boxes. I ordered the yellow tail collar for my daughter (13). We ordered soda and tea for each of us as well. $12.95 bento boxes x2, $9.95 yellow tail collar, and $1.99 drinks x3. Not worth it. 

We waited for almost an hour for our food to be served. People that had entered before us (they ordered sushi) were finished before we were served our food! 

Finally the two bento boxes came out. FYI: they do not have regular soy sauce. The rice was delicious. The California rolls were good. The salad was yummy. However, not all was great. Like, the lack of tempura in my bento box. There were 4 pieces of what looked like donuts with a vegetable in them. They were either oily and doughy, or oily and over cooked. Then there was the fact that they missed the shrimp tempura completely. On a bright note, my husbands bento box had all the pieces. The teriyaki chicken would have been better if it was hot, not luke warm. 

The yellow tail collar eventually came out. The yellow tail was meaty, but the center was cold. I could see there was uncooked spots but fed my daughter enough of the cooked spots. 

At this point, our food had come out and the servers who were very polite had to hear my complain. They repeatedly stated that the chef was new and that he was confused. Our server contacted the owner, Steven, and tried to get the entire bill erased. But -- that didn't happen. He did take off the yellow tail collar. 

It's time for a new chef because you'll lose your customers with this kind of food that you're serving.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,2,0,1,_EfxRWI-3NQg5wSKagUcDg

DRINKS
* This place does NOT serve alcohol. NO SAKE and NO BEER.They say they are waiting for their liquor license... So maybe that will change.
* They do not have fountain sodas, only bottles.
* They have Pepsi products. (I like diet Coke)

SUSHI
Seaweed Salad - It was tasty but extremely small. It was the size of a seaweed salad you would expect at an AYCE (about a half cup, maybe less), but it was $4.50. For that price I would expect a good sized portion.

Las Vegas Roll - Deep fried rice. I like deep fried rolls but I like them when the rice is on the inside of the seaweed. The rice here is on the outside, there is a lot of it, and a lot of tempura. There is a small amount of salmon and cream cheese on the inside. I felt like I was eating fried dough, not sushi.

Ichiban Roll - The garlic sauce tasted nice, but lots of rice.

Oishi Roll - Yummy, but small and lots of rice.

This place adds rice to rolls and portions their items as if it is an AYCE, but it is NOT. For $12+ rolls, I expect better quality and quality of fish. They have a special going on now, buy 2 special rolls get one free, but you can go down the street to Ohjah and get their 3 roll special for the same price (and they serve large seaweed salads and sake at Ohjah)

There was one lady at the place talking about how much she loved it and how she had been there multiple times, but she also asked the waitress what NIGIRI was..? So she obviously has not had much sushi. Otherwise, we were on only customers there.

SERVICE
The waitresses were nice and quick, but the place was dead.

This place might be okay if they were an AYCE and you were ok with lots of rice, or if they had a happy hour, but definitely not a la carte at their current prices. There are so many better options.",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,3,1,2,mXZAlDdmp5iyCrmyb4PKEA
