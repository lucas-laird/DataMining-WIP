Family owed place that keeps the food quality high and doesn't skimp on the products like another nearby place. Welcome back!,0WEPe9QxTqUnMTveT_fSKQ,0,0,5,BHMB45Oljqmi9myemrtIIw

Would rate the chilli cheese fries 2 out of 5. Price is too much for what it is. One time experience for me and that's enough for this place.,4VQQbaJp1H7Kkk4x6GPGhQ,0,0,3,FFBETwdEXHJX5ubg6W3dQA
