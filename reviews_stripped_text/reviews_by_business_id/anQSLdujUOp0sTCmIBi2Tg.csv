66690,2015-11-09,0,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"I don't know what other reviewers are complaining about with this place. Parking is valet-only here, so suck it up and thank the valet guy with a tip. Or if you're from out of town, take a taxi from your hotel. Both times I have been here the service has been excellent. Saw Pia Zadora on a Saturday night. Pia's husband went out of his way to ensure we had seats at the bar, bringing in additional seats to accommodate us. Bartenders are great and Pia is fabulous. 

A couple weeks later I took some visiting guests for dinner late on a Sunday night (last night). I called ahead to check availability and when we arrived we were seated immediately and the service was excellent again. The waiter was great. We all chose different entrees and everything was excellent. Previously I have heard/read complaints that Piero's food is Olive Garden quality but that is simply not the case. Piero's food is excellent and exactly what one would expect from a high end Italian restaurant. I had the Osso Bucco and it was to die for. My friends were thrilled with their meals as well, and said they will make Piero's a regular part of their Vegas trips from now on. 

I suspect those who complain about Piero's are either cheap or just not used to real high end dining. FYI, most of the restaurants on the strip aren't exactly true high end. They may offer good food and ""fancy"" environs but they are still just another overpriced cattle call to appeal to the masses who want to see and be seen as ""living it up"". Piero's is exceptional. 

I will most definitely be back.",YSwulpcKhbt2L5gQrfMW7g,1,1,5,nxRmymMF41Y6D-6A-6dlmA
75894,2012-09-05,0,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"If it were only about the food, I'd give this place a 4.  Upfront, the food was great, albeit on the very expensive side.  However, the service was horrific enough that all I remember from dining there is that the food was good, but overshadowing all of it was the terrible, terrible service.

We had to not only ask our server for everything, but to ask the waitstaff to FIND our server.  From the menu to the checks to water, we spent ten minutes in vain trying to find our server and then waiting ten minutes once we actually found him to get our menu/water/check/etc.  This was incredibly annoying.

But the biggest irk of the evening was the management..  Clearly they favor the Vegas regulars as well they should since they're regulars and repeat customers.  However, walking the dining room for the entire two hours and stopping at every table EXCEPT ours (even for a hello good evening) and not even making eye contact is just rude.  Were we not supposed to notice that every table except ours got gladhanded?  Or the fact that the tables that arrived after us got service first, food first, and left before we even got our entrees?

For the $300+ we spent there, I'm more than happy to spend that money elsewhere.  Vegas isn't exactly lacking expensive high quality restaurants.  Give this place a pass if you're not into getting treated like a fourth-class citizen.",DNFX44rLbZCGlOPkEGzboQ,0,0,2,eDVlzixGT8fpU1DG2m9IGQ

Nothing special about it at all. Really very similar to pot roast. The pasta and sauce was also ""whatever."" Nothing at all was very tasty or special about the meal. My wife had a chicken dish with cheese and egg plant (can't remember the exact name), but that too was ok. Nothing great.

I should have returned my Veal Sorrento - it was so tough, I basically ate the prosciutto and left the veal.  That was my fault but I hate to break the flow of a meal.  The least expensive bottle of wine was the house wine at $55.  Our bill came to $304 without the 20% tip that we include.  Outrageous!!

In der Regel ist es in Las Vegas teuer, laut, aufdringlicher Service und viel zu viel auf dem Teller. Dabei höchstens gutes Mittelmaß in der Qualität der Zutaten und/Zubereitung. Das Piero's ist da eine löbliche Ausnahme. Jaja, es ist seit über 10 Jahren Las Vegas number one, in Vegas ist alles etwas lauter und marktschreierisch - aber man sollte trotzdem in's Pieros gehen. 
Empfang an der Bar sehr zuvorkommens, hier haben wir unseren Apero genommen und es dauerte nicht lange bis unser Tisch frei war (ca. 10 Minuten). Das Interieur ist sehr gediegen, plüschig und geschmackvoll. Serive aufmerksam, wohltuend im Hintergrund. Wie in USA üblich rasselt der Kellner in gut einstudiertem Italo-Englisch alles herunter was es so ausserhalb der Karte gibt. Wir haben die Hälfte verstanden und etwas heruasgepickt was schmeckt.
Als Wein kommen mehrere Flaschen vorzüglicher Barolo auf den Tisch, ich konnte den hausgemachten Pasta in Salbeibutter zur Vorspeise nicht widerstehen, danach Schwertfisch mit knackigem Gemüse und Risotto Reis. Als Nachtisch Espresso und ein guter, nicht zu teurer aber um so besserer Grappa. Das Essen war auf den Punkt genau gegart, die Küche hat's drauf und der Service erst recht damit es auch rechtzeitig an den Tisch kommt. 
Essen ist hier ein Erlebnis, und auch wenn man wie üblich die Rechnung unaufgefordert bekommt wenn man nichts mehr bestellt so kommt doch fast so etwas wie Gemütlichkeit in den sonst so hektischen US Restaurants auf.
Billig ist es nicht: mit 120USD pro Nase sollte man mind. rechnen. Nett: sie haben immer eine Limo davor stehen die einen dann zum jeweiligen Hotel bringt. Fahrpreis nach gusto, man sollte dem Fahrer so 20USD geben.",sIYSICJxD0ro0cmNi5fMqw,0,0,5,_E14WMfZ5giCrAcTFSLQ5Q

With Don and Bernie behind the bar you will never get a bad drink, and they always know the best glass or bottle of wine to go with your meal. The wait staff is also amazing one in particular is a gentlemen by the name of Tim, he knows the history of Vegas and always has a great story to tell.  The one and only reason that Peiro's only got three stars (it truly deserves all five) from me is that, I went for dinner last night and I was sitting at the bar. About 3/4 of the way through the meal I hear F*ck this and don't you ever F*cking do that again. It was one of the most unprofessional and inappropriate things I have ever seen in a restaurant. The individual that I would consider head of house I believe his name is Evan has one of the wait staff backed into a corner yelling and ripping papers out of the staffs hand. The four or five people around me at the bar to include myself got extremely uncomfortable to the point where I asked for the check to leave. When Evan realized the scene he was making, he stopped and then came over to apologize, that's when you could tell he had been drinking pretty heavily and was slurring his speech and couldn't make complete sentences. As much as I fell on love with this place I will be hard pressed to sit down and have a dinner or drinks if I see that manager again, which is a complete shame. Don, Bernie, Tim thank you for always welcoming me, giving me an unbeatable dining experience; I'm sorry that all of your hard work and dedication was ruined by what I would consider a self entitled prick.

Evan,
 My apologies; I'm sure your a great manager and I'm sorry for the personal attack. I will continue to recommend the restaurant and the amazing experience you get from this one and only type of place.

While waiting for our table we sat at the bar and talked with some of the other patrons who were mostly locals and evidently frequented this establishment enough to be on first name basis with the staff. That is always a good sign that the food should be something special. 
The decor reminded me of a bygone era when the rat pack ""owned"" Las Vegas. 
Enough about the ambiance, now on to the meal.
We started off with the crab cake appetizer and the special of butterflied gulf shrimp that were grilled and placed on a butter based sauce.  Crab cake was good, had a nice touch of heat and plenty of lumpy crab meat.  The grilled shrimp were slightly over cooked and hard to extract from their shell, thus making them a little chewy.  Despite their chewiness, they were delicious and had a great flavor.
We split the caesar salad which they were kind enough to bring us separate plates. My only disappointment was that the salad was WAY over dressed thus making the romaine soggy. I tried to scrape some of the dressing off but it was stuck on there like glue! It was also pretty skimpy on the parmesan cheese. Next time will ask for dressing on the side.  
Now for the highlight, Osso Bucco! This dish was worth 5 stars!  We decided to split the dish and they brought us each our separate pasta side and served the veal shank ""family style"". The taste and texture of the veal was amazing, the marrow was fabulous and we fought over who was going to get the last bite. If this wasn't such a nice place I would have used my fingers to get every last bit out!  The pasta had that nice bite to it and with the addition of the braising sauce made it something special!
Our only regret was that we did not have room for dessert!  Maybe next time!",FqQqnzfn08vZVOIxxfbZnw,0,0,4,VQhm0AmcGQGb8ABuEbgy4g

I have eaten at Pieros probably 100 times over the past few years. I eat there solo, I entertain clients and I've brought my family.  There is good reason I've eaten at Pieros 100 times - there is simply no reason to eat anywhere else for me. It is that good here.  The diversity and quality of their menu is amazing. Got a meat fix? Eat the veal chop parmesan, blackened ribeye or osso bucco.  Want perfectly cooked seafood? Sea bass, halibut and swordfish are among the best I've ever had.  Special occasion? Splurge for a 25 year MacCallan or Louis XIII.  

Let's talk about service:  from the leadership at the restaurant  (Evan and Pat) to the Captains (Philippe, Patrick and Tim) and the bartenders  (Heather and Bruce) and the front desk (Anton) it is very clear that there is a culture of service, warmth towards customers and attention to detail that you will seldom find in other restaurants.  There is real passion and authenticity  among all the Piero's team and it shows, day in and day out as if it's the last performance they will ever give.  That is incredibly hard to do in any kind of service profession.

In Vegas, the cityscape gets torn down and rebuilt seemingly every decade, but Piero's persists and thrives off the strip and does it with timeless style.  Go here, eat here, drink here, chit chat with the staff and absorb what will be an enriching dining experience.

1) off the beaten path
2) old school Vegas

Very cool!  Reminiscent of the old Venetian restaurant that used to be off Sahara, just West of the 15.  I just dropped in for a few classic cocktails and was swept back in time to what my imaginary view of Vegas in the 70s would have been.  Great old-timer bartender who likes to chat.  An eclectic mix of people from various walks of life and history all enjoying the somewhat dim, yet lively atmosphere.  I feel like I should have been in a disheveled tux with an untied bowtie and long lost cuff links, sipping straight bourbon while smoking a Camel.

You are started off with warm bread and butter. We ordered their agnolotti pasta with cream which was almost like a light spinach filled ravioli, fettuccine alfredo and House special veal chop Parmesan. The pasta and entree comes with house salad. Their pasta is priced between $28-$36 and entree Veal Parmesan was $50. It's a pricy place but the food was excellent. Wine options were good with bottles of wine starting at $45. 
For dessert we had their chocolate rum cake which was one of the best I ever had. Light and moist, yummmy! 
The reason for bumping a star was that the experience dampened after we were served dessert. Our waitress forgot about us and we sat 30 mins just waiting for her to box the dessert and get our check. Finally asked one of the food runners to locate her. Another unpleasant surprise was our check. We were charged $36 for fettuccine alfredo which was listed at $29. I brought it to my server's attention and she argued that it was $36 on the menu. I had her bring me the menu to verify and of course it was $29. She took it to the manager to get it fixed. My total came to $187. However my card gets charged for $207... REALLY?? So I had to call her again to correct that.. she did some research and told me that the manager accidentally charged for a salmon dish that I never ordered. So finally I had my check all corrected.

This is the most incredible restaurant that vegas has to offer.  The food, service, and atmosphere are worth every penny (and that's a lot of pennies).  

I have enjoyed Pieros on special occasions for the past 5 years I have lived in Las Vegas.  The atmosphere is iconic Vegas (or what I imagined Las Vegas to be like before the mega resorts).  I hope one day I can afford it more regularly!

From arriving you are greeted by their valet.  When you enter you are greeted with classic Vegas decor.  Check out their tiger print carpet...it is beautiful.

They have a bar to one side, I am not a drinker, so I moved on in to the smiling hostess.  I would recommend making a reservation but I have never been turned away.

Seating is prompt.  Usually you will see Mr. Glussman socializing with his guests (he is the owner and he is always there!). 

Once seated you have a wait staff of 3-5 people waiting on you.  The service is top notch.  Even when busy you are being served properly.

Their food is on a whole other level.  Everything I have had has been delicious. From steak to seafood it is perfect.  Pieros has the culinary Gods themselves cooking in the kitchen. 

I always get the garbage Caesar salad.  It is loaded with avocado, shrimp, artichoke hearts,etc.  It is a must.

I usually opt for the special.  Last time I was their it was a hefty 6 oz filet.  The saying it melts in your mouth does no justice.  It was cooked to perfection. 

Don't forget dessert.  Cream Brûlée all the way.  My wife and I usually spend about $150 on the 2 of us (+tip) and remember we don't drink.  It is worth it.  It's a Vegas staple.

1641785,2017-08-05,0,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"Unequivocally recommended. One of the last strongholds of vintage Vegas. Super-solid quality of product and truly fawning service inside a Mid-Century-classic luxurious décor. This venue has been a local's top-pick time and time again, including by legendary Mayor Oscar Goodman, as recommendation to recapture old-school Vegas ... as well as Vegas' best Italian restaurant from a poll of local cabbies. Given Piero's is seen as knocking-out all the opulent Italian dining available across all the casino properties, well, that says it all. 

Over the years, Piero's has been dined by thousands of celebrities, the famous ... and the infamous. The list of such, should you research it, is literally endless. On one visit, our server advised we had just missed Nicolas Cage & Carrot Top as patrons. That duo sounded unlikely as wing-buddies ... but the next day the RJ gossip column confirmed it. (Piero's staff is apparently quite meticulous about protecting the privacy of such patrons from gawkers, autographers and the like.)

I've dined Piero's several times, always with a lovely lady companion who deserves the experience. And I always end up ordering the Chicken Vesuvius, given it's rumored that Frank Sinatra would occasionally send his jet up from Palm Springs to order-out ... way-out ... for a plate of it. If it so impressed Ol' Blue Eyes, well ... (Apparently, he also favored the linguine and clams here as well.)

Piero's has tons of additional backstory. This is the second venue for this restaurant; the first opened in 1982. This second venue was previously operated as Villa D'Este, owned & run by Joe Pigatello. Back in those days, Pigatello's joint was frequented by certain wiseguys, including Tony Spilotro. So it's quite fitting that this space was showcased by several scenes within the Martin Scorsese 1995 film ""Casino,"" in which Joe Pesce portrays Spilotro (incorrectly) as its owner.  (As Piero's, it is owned & run by the Glusman family.) There's a scene in the film where Robert DiNiro & Sharon Stone argue in a corner booth (over her tying their child up to their bed with pantyhose so she can go sleaze up to Pesce). That booth - not surprisingly called 'The Casino Booth' - is currently quite available for seating (though it sports new leathering) and it provides a very nice view of one section of the venue and the main bar. (I've tipped into it before, finding my companion, once so informed of such history, was quite impressed.) 

There was a time that Wayne Newton called Piero's his favorite dining haunt ... and from time to time Piero's would be re-opened after closing ... and after Newton finished his last show of the evening ... just for Newton and his entourage. In 2012, when San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos was looking for a new head coach, he held the interviews over dinner at Piero's. Then there's the story about Bob Stupak, one of Vegas' back-in-the-day legendary characters/hucksters, who conceived and built The Stratosphere & its Tower; at the time the property was named ""Bob Stupak's Vegas World."" Stupak, a poker addict, had a beef with Binion's (a Downtown/Fremont casino) over the millions in chips he had stashed in Binion's vault, a beef that culminated in a couple of tough guys ruining Stupak's dinner at Piero's -- with a beating. In classic Vegas tradition, almost none of Piero's staff remembered seeing anything. Currently, Piero's Lounge has been instrumental in reviving the career of none-other than Pia Zadora. If you aren't old enough to remember of Ms. Zadora, I'll leave it to you to check with Dr. Google about that. If you dine here on a weekend, don't be surprised if she table-touches you for a bit of a chat, as she has done at our table.

If all that history, aside all the five-star plates and service, doesn't cause to you to crave a dining experience at Piero's, well you just don't know how to appreciate what Vegas is really all about!",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,2,1,5,siHuKZrj_UsDEHx7Un8MEQ

If you're in the mood to get off the strip or just want to try a new place, I would highly recommend Piero's as the food is fantastic and the service is top notch.",KCR6R09YuGp8H4WR-JZY3g,1,0,5,9pNVkMb_wZHNazvwmyd5HA
1763899,2015-02-16,8,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"A Vegas classic...

This place has been around for many years and even featured in one of my favorite movies ever, Casino! We came here for Valentine's Day per my man and I was hoping for the best as it wasn't exactly on my radar. We both left disappointed. 

To start off, an older lady who has probably been the host since it opened wasn't friendly and that's how the experience began. We arrived early and were seated near the kitchen however there were many other tables open including booths. Not cool. The room itself was a little odd. The low ceilings and outdated furniture wasn't pleasing to my eyes as I'm always into the decor. Odd space and it didn't feel like a classic Italian restaurant. 

We must have been served by 6 different people this evening which was a little odd however they were all very nice. Now let's get to the food -

Started with a few cocktails, a lemon drop for me which was very smooth and a belvedere and ginger ale for my man which he enjoyed and had a few of them before the end of the evening. His second drink wasn't correct so we had to send it back. Crispy bread was brought over with very good butter. 

Next we ordered crispy cheese with house marina that was a little on the spicy side and this happened to be my favorite part of the meal. After that came a garbage Caesar salad that was traditional with a few extras like - avocado, shrimp and tomatoes. The salad was on the bland side, was hoping for a more flavorful dressing. 

Next came out entrees - osso bucco for him and penne alla vodka for myself. The osso bucco was fantastic loaded with flavor and bone marrow. We both enjoyed it very much. My penne was bland and boring. I make this dish better at home, was very disappointed. 

For dessert we had two large chocolate dipped strawberries that were super juicy and we thoroughly enjoyed them. 

The bill came and it was nearly $250. Not worth it. I've had cheaper meals that were much more memorable. At this price I expect at least one food orgasm and it never came :(",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,16,12,3,m3xJQSmh7vGYttxMiq-k4A
1773328,2015-08-20,6,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"We had early evening reservations for a group of 4 on Tuesday of this week. We were seated at a table in the bar area where it's a bit noisy but convivial, especially the one chick grinding on her boyfriend's lap at the bar. Group orders cocktails, appetizers, salad, 4 entrees, a bottle of wine, dessert. Service and alcohol are wonderful; food mostly bland except for the veal chop parmesian, which was excellent. The service has been paced perfectly: no long waits between courses and no courses overlapping. Group has just finished dessert and has paid the bill -- a mere $600 -- and two of the group are slurping up the last of the wine. Older dude (I'd generally use the more respectful ""gentleman"" but it doesn't apply in this case) comes over and says, ""It's time for you to leave. You've been here long enough."" Group looks up and thinks he's being funny. Nope. Crabby dude says, ""I'm serious. I'm the manager here and I need this table."" Group looks around. There are two empty tables next to us. 

Most of us are fairly cosmopolitan and have eaten at swanky places all over the world, but never, repeat, never has anything so uncouth and rude happened to us in a supposedly classy but definitely expensive joint. We could certainly understand if the four of us had been loud and obnoxious or rude or cheap or spent an extra hour dawdling after we'd finished our meals. And even then we would have expected the manager to say something like, ""Hey, I'm sorry but we need this table for a large group. What if you head over to the bar and I'll buy you a drink?"" The woman who had treated us was not only livid, but embarrassed, and she dashed out of the restaurant. Two of us were slower and a different manager came up to apologize for the old man, saying that had happened a few times that week. What? We then made our way through the throngs of people waiting to be seated -- oh, sorry, there were only about 4 people standing in the lobby.

So, a fun evening with friends was soured for no reason whatsoever. Plus I had to use up time which could be spent on better things writing this because I could never forgive myself if I didn't. For the record, the dishes I classified as bland were the mussels (puny mussels in broth not even interesting enough to dip bread in -- if you're into mussels, try the green mussels from New Zealand served at The Barrymore up the street), the shrimp appetizers, the garbage salad and the Osso Bucco, which was tender but didn't taste much different than mom's pot roast.",YNuvbOb6cZxck2HJOLK6pQ,12,2,1,mV_Rpc9LSLG2x1zXxzpP8g

The chef, however, missed the mark with my Koho Salmon.  I asked for it medium-rare, and received a filet that was very thin on either side (it looked like it had been flattened with a meat hammer), with a sort of thick in the middle. Both ends of the filet were very overcooked, and the middle of the fish was so raw amd uncooked, it probably could have still swam away.

The waiter didn't come back by until after I had already eaten all of the vegetable and when I told him about the problem, he said he could bring the piece of fish back and have them recook it for a minute.  That would have done nothing about the overcooked parts of the fish, and the experience of enjoying a nice meal was just ruined already.  The watier took away my plate, brought my check when asked, and said no more about it.

There were other restaurants more highly rated than this, yes, but I had hoped to find a balance between good food, great service and reasonable price. Not cheap, just not ridiculous as many of the higher rated places were. And, not French. 

So, we chose Piero's. First, the place was nice. Not stuffy or formal but classy. We were eating early so it was very quiet when we came in but filled up quickly. Second, the server was gracious and jovial. No real complaints about that. Third, the food was good. But just good. I wanted something to knock me down with it's amazingness, but that did not happen. Not that I didn't scarf down every morsel, but I feel I've had as good at other places. Portion sizes were large but not stupidly large like many Italian places. 

It didn't help that the women seated next to us were loud and talking of things more suited to a private space, kind of killed the romantic mood I had hoped for. Nor did it help that there was a small child who clearly wanted to leave in the next room over for most of the meal. 

Again, I shouldn't be so hard on a place that fails to live up to some imaginary perfection I often expect. But I will visit another restaurant for my ""splurge"" place next time.",R7USsOAHLx98vv83Cwxr3A,1,0,3,h3Sr_N24-DU1T6TIxxBHsw

2509102,2013-12-16,1,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"I love old Las Vegas, and Piero's is a place you must try out if you feel the same way. It doesn't look like much has changed since the Vegas' hayday with Sinatra, Sammy Davis, and Dean Martin. Piero's is just one of those cool, old school places. The food is overpriced, the quality is decent enough, and you can justify paying the final tab if you remember why you're there - to experience old Las Vegas.

From a food quality standpoint, I would say Piero's is definitely above average, but nothing that would make me feel like I need to go back. I ordered a pasta dish, exactly what it's called, I'm not sure. It was a Spinach Ravioli with a cream sauce. Very good, but not outstanding. I thought the spinach inside the ravioli might be a little creamy or have something in there to go along with it, but it was simply spinach. The best dish at our table was the Veal Parmesan. If I was to go back, that would definitely be at the top of my ordering list. The best part of the entire meal was the service - it was second to none. Our drinks never needed filling, everyone at the table ordered from the bar and we were asked several times throughout if we needed additional drinks (of course we did). The food was spaced out perfectly. There's nothing worse than getting your appetizer and 4 minutes later the entree's come out. It was a good 15-20 minutes between appetizer's and entree's. That said, don't go to Piero's if you're in a rush. This is a place that forces you to sit back, relax, take in some of old Vegas, and enjoy a quality meal.

Certain places make you wonder, if the walls could speak what would they say. This is definitely one of those places.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,2,4,OZAHnCvJ7oX6LQWpwkey5Q

The veal Osco bucco was excellent and I could eat that with just my fork.  The pasta with meat sauce was freshly made and has a nice texture.  The side salad was huge and had nice tomatoes and mozzarella cheese balls that worked well with their sweet basalmic dressing.  All our desserts were fabulous.  The house Chianti was excellent and I suggest you try that as it was dark and fruity like a well aged cab that would cost much more than this house wine.,TqEOK7uxaXj7SbJZKEktxw,3,3,5,tgs-mUf61Te2FficdicCMA
2563069,2017-05-04,1,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"I am not sure which was a better day for me; when I finally managed to worm my way into the this institution (took a vacant seat with some friends- hangovers are good when they leave vacancies for me to fill) or when I returned for my 12+ time and felt at ease and at home. 

Make no mistake this is a fine dining event. If you want some sauce and starch on the fly there are plenty of food courts to fill your needs. (I won't judge) But if you are discerning and patient, and you believe that performance art can be accomplished by staff in tuxedos, then you MUST experience Piero's. Make reservations though or your night could be a wash. 

I write of the restaurant, but plenty of enjoyment can be had at the bar. So don't dismiss it if you desire a top notch drink (absent all the hipster craft ideals). These are beverages to be consumed- not photo flashed off to friends. But the orange slice added to a Basil Hayden does make for beautiful look (props to Brandon Jimenz for making it acceptable for a man to enjoy fruit with a drink).  

As for the restaurant itself- brother I could write eight sequels to this review and still miss dozens of points. With brevity in mind let's hit the high bits (if you read this far congrats).

The service is amazing. You will be ushered, questioned, treated, encouraged and thanked. You will not be rushed. So please return the favor and allow the same. As with all art things take time. Sit back and enjoy the sights and sounds without agonizing on whether your next drink will make it to the table (it is likely prepared for you before you even know you need it- the soothsaying is gratis). The waiters (there must be a better word for their professional magic) are magnificent. They direct you through the evening with aplomb. I always leave as feeling as I dined with a group of friends. 

The food is without equal. The menu has normal fair- done with unique flourishes- and some outstanding high notes. 

The Stone Crab must be ordered. 
Get the Garbage Cesar. (extra points if you can be true and eat it after the main course)
Select your preference for pasta.
Have someone else order Osso Bucco.
Sample the dessert. 
(And repeat)

Basically you cannot go wrong with your food choices. I have friends ready to take aim if I disparage the Kosher chicken. Others never shut up about the eggplant. (fine, the others are me. I can admit it). The steaks have yet to meet an urban cowboy who doesn't wish they had room to order another one. Order away and know that you can choose your own adventure here- but there are no wrong turns- just new outposts along the way. 

A moment to address some elephants- please don't talk incessantly about ""the movie"". Please don't act like anyone in a suit is connected. Know that the more time you spend craning your next for a celebrity subtracts from the time you have to enjoy all the other colorful characters that make this place special. Yes, celebrities come here, but only those with taste. Shouldn't we allow the tasteful some respite from flashbulbs and handshakes? (Side note, the staff makes YOU feel like a celebrity- so act accordingly and maybe people will start watching you instead.)

I love this place nearly as much as I love this town. And with time they have become so intertwined that no force could separate the two. Do yourself a favor and experience on your own. I look forward to reading your reviews.",m2YcjzCC-mlXIkW6cfXecA,4,2,5,a_8SUGRxUFdOgCRH2C3oMw

It just didn't seem acceptable to make a patron wait for as long as I had to order/enter my name for a reservation. The food may have redeemed this place in most areas, but it just barely made even. By the way, the salmon was incredibly crispy and a bit medium rare which I loved but the Brussel sprouts (which I were told were crispy and roasted, tasted more like bagged and boiled). The final part was the value for the cost. I'll add that while I was told my Caesar salad was an additional charge of replacing the Italian salad, I didn't expect it would be $14 additionally! Four drinks and two entrees is steep at $180.00 especially for this nutmeg state gal. I might be back, but only convenience.",K3PgpKA8NcSWlPSBucg5qg,1,0,2,UGJB5UCTsFv4FVRrcCq_sw

There are a lot of great places to eat in Vegas and pieros definitely belongs in that category. But what makes pieros stand out is all the little things other places miss. When we first pulled in, we were led to valet. Valet is free and seems to be the standard so we happily stopped. The valet opened my wife's door and helped get out of the car. Great start to the night. Upon arriving we were greeted by the front desk and they were expecting our arrival. Our table was ready with little wait and we were sat immediately. The table was moved out to make room for us to sit and perfectly placed for us to be comfortable. The decor was simple and classic. Music was pleasant and soft enough to have a chat. The staff was over immediately taking drink orders and wine orders. Javier and Jonathan were very attentive and friendly. Ian our captain came over and explained the specials and the menu. His knowledge was vast and descriptive. I came in wanting fish and ended up the succulent cut w your knife osso bucco (house special) because of Ian's recommendation. He also got us excited for stone crabs which were out of this world amazing. The food was without a doubt amazing. But what really stood out was the finger cleaning warm cloth after the crab was finished these small touches are fantastic. The osso bucco was amazing but the bread paired w the sauce really stood out. We never had to ask for more bread or drinks. Everything was there when we needed it. The small fork for the marrow was delivered In perfect timing.

2633077,2013-01-11,11,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"For my Century Yelp review, I couldn't go with any other than what is becoming a breed dying off faster than the gangsters who built Vegas did: a true institution which still lives up to its past glory while taking you back in time during your dining experience. Having a strong drink and a chat with Don at the bar can yield some fantastic Rat Pack lore. Usually, a crooner and a band will lend to the vibe. 

If you've seen the movie Casino, you've seen the interior: dark, clubby, with well dressed patrons (make reservations) Captains, helpful Sommelier and slightly reminiscent of the interior of the Venetian Restaurant (on Sahara, where Herbs & Rye holds court) My folks and family have been frequenting Piero's for years and are greeted as familia. It is always bustling, with locals and tourists alike. 

Famous for the ""garbage"" Caesar (delicious and chock full of unexpected, but perfect ingredients which takes a classic to another level) Osso Bucco is one of the most famous dishes this kitchen prepares (for a rumored 6 hours) and everyone I know who has had it, raves and orders it again and again. Simple dishes such as Pasta Puttsnesca are also given the respect and a twist which makes them stand outs. Seafood dishes are stars here, as are saltimbocca, lamb and chicken standards. Steaks come prepared as ordered and with raves, always extra sides arrive, the creamed corn being a favorite. My dish is usually Zuppa di Pesce, though sometimes since they know me so well, I'll go with a suggested special, or just ask for an off menu item. This is the kind of Italian fare we'd have at Nonna's in Bensonhurst on Sundays, slow cooked with great love and simple, fresh ingredients. Meals are never rushed, it is an experience. 

Usually aperitifs like Limoncello, grappa and Sambucca are savored with demitasse and an array of desserts suggested or sent by the house. By all means, trust the experience and suggestions of the staff here, choose a wine with the help of the Sommelier and take a step back in time while enjoying a very rare place where old Las Vegas meets new Las Vegas without losing any of its glory. One almost expects Old Blue Eyes, Sammy and Dean to sidle up to the next table...

I was lucky enough to try the meatballs hand made by one of the owners of over 20+ years, and it took me right back to my roots. I felt like I was in my own family's kitchen for a moment. True hospitality at its finest. I always feel welcome and never rushed out the door. It's a dining experience, not just dinner. Need help pairing a wine with each course, they will assist. The dim lighting and large booths make it perfect for a romantic night out. However they offer private dining areas if you wanted to throw Holiday dinner, or birthday party here.
It's pricey, but you're not just paying for an amazing melt in your mouth dish. You are paying to leave your worries at the door for 2 hours, and be taken somewhere else.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,6,3,5,KoVl5n_312Afm_-PXE6klA

There were just a few things that made our meal a little lackluster. This could be preference rather than Piero's fault, but I'll lay it all out regardless. 

First off, they only do valet parking. They have no self lot so either Uber there or have a few dollars on hand. Next, they have no cocktail menu. The waiter says order whatever you want and the bartender will make a fine version of it, but he came back with an awful Manhattan and Old Fashioned which tasted just like whiskey dumped into a glass with a random cherry or orange, respectively, as a garnish. Some of the worst renditions of a cocktail I've ever had. Strong but definitely not worthy of a cocktail price. Next thing that happened was that the specials were given before we received our menus and listed about 15 which I couldn't really register as there were too many. It's a little overwhelmed for when you throw out all the specials and don't list prices or ingredient listings or anything. 

The food itself was pretty good. The bread was a great French bread and the garbage Caesar salad was a really solid rendition of a Caesar that included tomatoes, avocado, and shrimp (is it even a Caesar salad anymore). This is a great salad and can easily be split or taken as a meal if it's own. The osso bucco was top notch, fall off the bone, deliciousness. It even came with some bone marrow which complimented the French bread perfectly. The side of creamed corn was a nice touch as well. It's sweeter than usual though so beware. The accompanied pasta was just average in the osso bucco dish but you get the dish for the meat not the side so no worries. The mushroom pasta special was very lackluster. Very soft sauce and again the pasta was just fair. The mushrooms were good but there weren't enough and too small to recognize. 

Price is pretty steep as well. Most pasta dishes ranged high $20s or low $30s with the meat dishes around high $40s. I think Piero's is one of those romantic locations that you come if you're on a high class vacation or at a convention and on your employer's dollar.

Our reservation was at 8pm and before we were seated we headed for the bar. The bar was a separate room and there was a piano and a lounge singer on the corner which reminded me of Frank Sinatra. He sang the classics: Fly me to the Moon, Luck Be a Lady...I was transported in another time, a glimpse of that Old Vegas that is now hard to find amongst the new glitz and glitter that Vegas has now become. 

The cocktails at the bar was served stiff but expect steep prices...my hubby's kettle and soda was $12 and my wine was $15. 

The servers, hostess and lounge singer all seemed like a character from an old movie...they were older, very proper, but with an Italian flair so much like those I would see in Sopranos, minus the gangster attitude.

Our waiter who greeted us was very friendly and told us about the specials. He mesmerized my group with his explanation of the food. he had a great italian 'soprano"" accent and a pompador hair which he kept in character the whole time. 

I ordered the Osso Bucco, a special of Pieros and a dish I have never had and most of my friends ordered veal. It seems veal is the way to go here, as the menu is full of veal. 

All I can say is everyone in our table ooh'd and aah'd over the food. My osso bucco was cooked for 4-6 hrs with the bone intact and my waiter stuck a little fork in the bone as I realized Im to eat the bone marrow! Cool I never had that before. The veal is tender, flavorful, and the bone marrow is unforgettable. My hubby's veal with quartered mushrooms, capers and wine butter sauce was also amazing. I couldn't help but be greedy as I ate from his plate too. 

This place is an experience in its own...receiving many accolades and culinary awards. its not the glitzy in-your-face-Vegas so don't expect a contemporary and ultra modern space. It is fine dining but it is unpretentious, has a dated feel with an old vegas charm.

The Italian gentleman running the show was a riot.  He's very passionate about the restaurant.  I can envision the cast from Casino eating here and getting in character.  

The veal dish I ordered was the best veal I've eaten.  They also have a good wine list.  The server recommended a Pinot Grigio that was reasonably priced and enjoyable.  As a matter of fact, the server was nice and conversational.

Just make sure you ask the waiter what's good b/c my wife ordered a pasta dish that was a total dud.

3457369,2007-07-29,3,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"For some reason, I felt skeptical despite the good reviews here, but my brother (in from Los Angeles) wanted to go and since he'd picked such a great restaurant (The Capital Grille) the day before, I allowed it instead of following my gut.

First, the place is butt ugly. I don't think anything has changed in their in 20 years and in this case, that is not a good thing. Tacky paintings. Bad lighting. Okay whatever.

Service was slow but I'm thinking maybe it's relaxing and not slow. My lemondrop was sour but it tasted of fresh lemon so that was okay. I had a craving for anchovies and asked to have them added to my salad. They brought me a big plate and that was nice because the salad was lacking in flavor, so the anchovy turned out to be helpful.

Slowly on to the main course...I ordered an osso bucco that was supposed to be their house specialty. It's braised all day and served in a red wine reduction.

But while waiting for the food, I'm realizing that the heat is becoming stifling. I ask the waiter and he says the a/c has failed. (Uh, it's 105 degrees outside, if you have no air, maybe you need to shut down.) He asks about moving but since no one else at my table seems to be complaining and we've already had our salads, I say no. (I should have said yes.) They bring a fan out and it does help a bit.

It turns out the air was out in one dining room. There is a second dining room where it's on but I didn't understand that when he offered to move us. By the time I'm realizing something is seriously wrong, my whole table is griping about the heat.

We ate our meal in hot misery. At best, everyone's dish was mediocre. Mine was overly salty. The rigatoni tasted like homemade, but homemade by someone who wasn't a very good cook. My brother's pasta with shellfish was bland.

The heat is rising.

I get up to use the restroom and complain about the heat. The guy doesn't know what I'm even talking about and points me to someone I assume is the manager.

The manager says, ""well, have you already eaten? Then what do you want me to do about it?""

He's surly and confrontational. I don't know that I was looking to DO anything in particular, but I wanted to know why they had seated people in a room with no a/c when they had another dining room with functional a/c.

Manager, ""it went out. What are we going to do? Announce to everyone that it's out? No, we want you to enjoy your meal in peace.""

Uh...""enjoy meal"" and no a/c in Las Vegas in July are two things that do not go together.

I walked away from Mr Surly vowing to never go back.

At $30-35/entree, mediocre food, surly manager, no a/c, ugly (I mean butt ugly) decor, and apparently a near fist fight in the parking lot (I didn't see it...someone who was with us went out to smoke and saw it), I would not only never go back, but would tell you you'd be a fool to go.

Bah! The topper that made the worst taste in my mouth was really the manager. It's rare to encounter someone that nasty in a food service industry.

One of the all time worst meals I've ever had. If I could give it negative stars, I would.

If you want great Italian at a better price, go to Pasta Mia. If you want great Italian at a more expensive price, go to Valentino's.",KefuZdgU_o1A6GM95T39Nw,6,0,1,tBZStqB1LHfYXf9FJpceow

The two gentlemen out front - professional, funny, gave good overview of restaurant since we had never been there, and provided great service. 

Gentleman at front area who greeted us - personable, showed us to the bar, made us feel right at home. 

Nancy the bartender - once again, took care of us, made us feel at home, excellent mixologist, personable. 

Once my sister and her brother in law arrived, the event only became BETTER. We were very fortunate to be seated right behind the bar at a great table for the six of us. 

Sidenote: If I lived in Las Vegas (we are from Seattle) this would be a mainstay for watching MNF, as there are 4 unobstrusive big screens up above the bar. 

Billy, who was the primary person who took care of us for dinner, did a great job of explaining a litte about Pieros (per my request), the food, and some recommendations for the evening. 

The appetizers were amazing - the calimari, and especially the fried cheese were delicious as my favorites of the ones brought out. 

For the entree, I took Billys recommendation and ordered the pounded out veal parmesan, and it was the best culinary decision I have made in quite some time. It was the best serving of veal I have had in my adult life - bar none. 

During our entire meal, the entire staff at Pieros was there, but not there, as everything our table needed was provided seamlessly. 

Drinks were replaced without asking, cutlery magically showed up when needed, and all done with the understated elegeance of an establishment that knows how to take care of its customers. 

I cannot state how appreciative  I am for our visit to Pieros and the service we received - I would recommend Pieros to ANYONE looking to have a world class experience - the food, ambiance, and underlying feeling of the place is truly AWESOME. 

Thank you PIEROS (all members of the TEAM we interacted with), as you gave my wife and I a memory that will truly last a lifetime!

This is not your very american Italian restaurant, in fact I don't even want to call it that but just the real Italian restaurant. Alright here is my experience- I spent a second dinner there as a married woman with my husband, parents in-law and new friends for a dinner prepared by some of their business collegues. The dinner is to support local traders and they do it when they are in Las Vegas during a trade show. As we enter the place we were greeted by dim lights and drinks at the bar, then we were escorted to the function room thats held for private events. At first I wasn't really used being seated with a very dim light but I get used to it, it gives more Classical Italian style, the room was decorated with renaissance style paintings, and there was floor-ceiling wall cellar. We were just flooded with food from Aperitivo, anti-pasti, primo & insalata. Made me only to have very tiny space for dolce. Also we were given a toast as a newly married couple and thats why this place was also very memorable. I remember one of the restaurant managers being there most of the time to introduce the food and tell whats next,next and next. Also the servers were top notch making this formal dinner vey fantastic. For few hours I felt like I was having that dinner in Italy!

We made reservations about a month ago and got a table for 6:30pm on a Monday night. Which, if you have heard about this place, I'm so lucky to have gotten. There was a real estate convention in town, so the place filled up quickly. 

We got seated in the most romantic little corner booth. It is very dim in this place, so it was great to cozy up for our dinner. The staff here is incredible. They are nicely dressed, super polite, and want to make sure you enjoy the entire experience. There really isn't a dress code to this place, but it is nice here, so I suggest if you are visiting to go on the dressier side.

My husband and I ordered the house chianti ($60) but boy is it not your typical house bottle! It was perfection, especially with the meal. He ordered the veal osso buco (their signature dish) and I had the agnolotti with stuffed spinach and light cream sauce. Both came with a salad that had this delicious house vinaigrette that tasted like it had a touch of mustard in it. The veal shank was like melt in your mouth veal. The fettucine that came with it, perfectly drenched in the juice from veal and veggies. My agnolotti was perfection, light pasta to spinach stuffing perfect ratio. 

We really did not have much room for dessert, however, when I saw a waitress bring the dessert tray around I HAD to have the creme brulee (which I believe is made with some grand marnier).

I've been wanting to try Piero's for many years.  It's one of those places that have a lot of history with the city and some of its famous entertainers and residents.

I was brought bread and iced tea soon after being seated.

For the first course, there was no choice.  It was an agnolotti and cheese combination.  There were five agnolotti in a cream sauce and a triangle shaped piece of fried mozzarella.  The server ground parmesan onto the agnolotti to my liking.  This starter dish was very good.  When eating the fried mozzarella, I couldn't help but think of my students and their senior prom.  They always cleared the place out of mozzarella sticks.  

The second course was a choice salads.  I chose the Caesar and the server did freshly ground pepper to my liking.  The romaine was as crisp as can be and the dressing was great!  A large salad course but I managed!

For the third course, I had to go with the house specialty--Osso Buco.  It was amazing!  The meat gently came off the bone and the sauce in which the veal shank was braised was very good.  The server brought me a cocktail fork and stuck it in the bone to use as a marrow fork.  A straw would have been a good idea, too!  Along with the Osso Buco, there was a nice sized mound of fettuccine.  It had the brazing sauce poured over it.  Again, the server round parmesan over the dish.  I've had Osso Buco a few times before but it was never this good.  You can tell their process takes hours.  

Service throughout the night was exemplary.  There must have been 10 people at least on duty and every one of them worked every table.  I was asked several times if I wanted a fresh iced tea.  When I finished my first glass, immediately a server appeared to take the glass to be refilled.  An empty pack of Sweet 'n Low was removed within moments of putting it on the table.  One of the servers who hadn't been at my table took my check and payment.  No waiting.  It's all for one and one for all.  

Many of the Yelp reviews refer to this as old school.  I agree, and I think it's a great idea.  Seeing the servers with white jackets, watching the plates be pushed by my table on a rolling cart, having service that is outstanding--these may be characteristics of old school, and it's good that some places retain their old school ways.

My only complaint with the place is the mandatory valet parking.  The lot isn't that big.  I can walk.  If some want to valet, let them.  A requirement--no, it shouldn't be!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,9,5,5dfBdH3W3iE4rO9J63dSeQ

I'm addicted to the pillowy softness of their agnolotti.  So simple, so delicious. Perfectly cooked. I don't even like pasta. The sauce is Amazing, not too rich like other cream sauces. I think I teared up eating it.
I ordered the Halibut as a main course. I don't remember it. And I love halibut. I dont remember it because I ordered a second round of agnolotti. Nothing else mattered. Nothing else existed. 
The martinis are decently sized. I felt like I was REALLY in Vegas, where your glass is filled to the brim. Not like all these other places on the strip... well, you know what I mean.",-PP2PBPpbrYdITLHJzNb4A,2,0,5,bTZ2g9t99BaesPp1gPNLCQ

My wife and I had always wanted to dine here when we were in Vegas but it never worked out. We had a reservation but we had to sit in the bar and wait. They were a little late. When we got seated we were in one of those split booths where you are almost sitting with the other party. Star one removed! I asked to be put in a quiet area. We then waited 30 minutes before anyone talked to us about the menu. Star two removed! The waiter was Scottish or something and I couldn't understand him, but wanting to try the food at this so called great Italian restaurant I already knew what I wanted scaloppine parmigiana my wife had the la zuppa di pesce. We also got shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. My wife got a lemon drop and when the waiter poured it into the glass it splashed all over us. Star three removed! We received our shrimp cocktail that had huge fresh shrimp on it but the cocktail sauce had so much horseradish that it made your eyes water. The main course came my veal was okay the sauce was bland and was accompanied by mash potatoes? I didn't get that. My wife's seafood soup was also bland and had no flavor. So I am taking away star # four. I wanted to give Piero's no stars but yelp makes you rate at least one star. We only saw the waiter once when he spit out the menu and we were never asked how we liked the food or given the least bit of attention. Star # five gone.

So when my GF suggested Italian for our girls night I was totally in the mood!  Our search began and ended here we decided to go old school I remembered a client telling me of her old days in Las Vegas when she was a showgirl hanging with the ""in"" crowd (the mafia) the show people and their cohorts.  So in the mood for some ambiance we decided to have some snacks here then move on for the rest of the night.

We pull up (Valet only) nice guy and walk in we already know we did not want the restaurant because we only wanted a few shared plates and cocktails.  So we opted for the front bar.  They had a small 3 person band think Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin style.  They have nice booths against the wall to cosy up in or a bar to sit and watch the small rooms happenings.  We chose the end of the bar to watch the performers eat our food and enjoy a couple of glasses of wine.  The decor of the room I thought was both fun and funny, completely decked out in monkeys, monkeys everywhere!  

Now on to the food...
Prosciutto Con Melone thinly sliced Parma ham and melon.  I loved the way the salt of the thinly sliced Prosciutto went both agains and with the sweet, slightly bitter of the Mellon.  
Agnolotti Freschi Alla Crema, country style fresh pasta stuffed with spinach, served with cream sauce.  Amazing, one of the best pasta dishes I have had.  The home made pasta breaks apart easily (but not to easy) to be able to tell it really is fresh.  The cream sauce has enough flavor to showcase the gentle blending of flavors of the spinach and cream.  I chose to add pepper because I like the kick of it.

On to the service and ambiance the service is top notch but with a bit of the New York attitude (if you've been there you know).  Everyone is taking orders,bringing, cleaning or walking around to see if one of the priors need to be done.  In other words great old school service.  Ambiance, lots of interesting things to keep your eyes and ears happy.  Sit at the bar and get to know a few New York transplants, or tourist who have heard about the great pasta or some old questionable members of our community who could quite possibly be in the old school mafia...

Any how The Pasta is great, the ambiance is fun, the bartenders know the wines and the servers know the menus, the people around you are a free added bonus.  I will be back and have a few times since I started this review.  

A side note the prices on some items have been raised about $1 since my first visit.  Still worth it.",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,2,2,4,W6JMHDyY9K-9dFxPhLb9OA

To me, it wasn't so much Rat-Pack-y as it was '80s Vegas -- more precisely, Golden-Girls-Go-To-Vegas: pastels on the wall, lots of beige, smell of Geritol in the air, old-school food and drink, Pia Zadora (!!!) playing in the lounge. FABULOUS! 

As mentioned, I don't care much for Italian food, but what I had here was excellent: prosciutto & melon appetizer, ""garbage"" Caesar salad and osso bucco. Bonus: this is one of the few spots I don't feel out of place ordering a Campari & soda, so I had two of those, as well! 

The prices are a bit steep, but just do as I did and have a fast-talking name-dropping deal-making TV producer/pornographer take you. Problem solved!

To be honest, because of this place's pedigree, I was expecting a bit more mob shtick here. But rather than be disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised by the weird 80s grandma vibe.

While I was dining I could literally envision the rat pack making Vegas their playground- dining there. It's seems like it's a bit of a time capsule from a bygone era where the Sands was at the height of it's heyday.  It's dimly lit which adds to the ambiance. It's a little bit off the strip but I do not mind as there is virtually no wait to be seated and there are no crowds not to mention it is TOTALLY worth it.

Every item was well prepared, rich, and big enough to share amongst a group. My companion and I had way more food than we could handle, but I scraped every last bit of that marrow out, let me tell you. We also paid through the nose...but for large dishes!

We were seated right away (at the closest seats to the kitchen, ugh). They were quite busy for a Tuesday, so I imagine that the weekends are extremely busy, and you will need reservations.
Staff was not super friendly on this particular evening, it seemed like they all were in a bit of a funk. (maybe they had a rough staff meeting before opening)
The atmosphere is very ""old Vegas"" and really charming.
We had the Fried Calamari appetizer and the Stone Crab Claws to start. The Calamari was not one of my favorites. Very bland and a bit chewy. 
The Stone Crab on the other hand was amazing! Some of the best I have had, and nice size too with a good amount of crab meat.
I had the Burrata Salad, which was very good. Perfect beef steak tomato on a bed of arugala, with a wonderful Burrata cheese.
Our entrees for the evening were the Bone-In Veal Parmigiana (from the daily specials) and Penne Vodka. 
The Veal was delicious, tender, and super flavorful. Cooked perfectly and the portion size is huge.
The Penne Vodka was good, not the best I have ever had.
The prices are a bit high......... I don't mind paying for a good meal! I will always opt for quality over quantity, but I don't think the quality equals what they are charging.
The Burrata Salad was good, $16.
The Stone Crab was delicious,  $112 for 8 claws.
The Veal Chop Parmigiana was also delicious, $54 for a very large chop.
The Penne Vodka was okay, $34.
Drinks were top shelf and were $20 each.

Oh yeah, they have a ""required"" valet. You can't park your own car. It is complimentary, but I wish I would have know this ahead of time so I would have had cash for a tip!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,5,3,3,wq-WjrgSpbOFw-UOvlqTrg

When we asked the waiter he said our salad would be right out. 45 minutes later still no salad. I left. I have to work this morning. My husband and friend stayed for dinner. I spoke with the matri de on the way out, expressing my concern. I drove thru In-N-Out on the way home. I called the manager to express my concern that my party was being over served without food. She was dismissive.Said she would look into it and I could call back to check on it or give my contact info and they would call me back.

Piero's is a place my husband and I have taken our staff and family to multiple times for special occasions like our company Christmas party and family reunions.  Our last experience here on 2/19/2017 is our very last.  

My husband and I brought our folks and 4 other family members with us.  There were 9 people in our party.  

Here's what I could not believe:

1.  We were ignored.  We were seated and it took 15 minutes for our server to arrive to take our drink order.  This continued through the evening.  
2.  We ordered the Stone Crab claws, 9 of them at $16 per claw for an appetizer.  We were excited to try them however, I believe our order was forgotten and it never came.  
3.  The food was disappointing.  
My husband ordered the Sea Bass which was overcooked and a bit fishy smelling.  
My father in law ordered pollo al carciofi and the chicken was overcooked and dry.  
My folks ordered the otoletta alla griglia -- a simple veal chop cooked on the grill however they received something else which was breaded and slathered in sauce.  
4.  Piero's charged us $20 for Johnny Walker Black and charged an additional $2 to add ice.  

ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?! $2 MORE FOR ICE CUBES???

With 9 people at an average cost of $120.00 per person, there were too many mishaps and lack of attention to us, our food, and our overall experience.  When I reviewed the itemized bill the next morning, the $2 more per Johnny Walker to be served on the rocks was just ridiculous.

 We decided to come here since the place we wanted to check out at the Bellagio had closed. And of course, Piero's never lets down. 
 We started with apps, and went all the way! 
 Calamari: Fried to perfection. Marinara sauce on the side was good, but a bit overpowering for the tiny morsels. 
 BB-Q Shrimp with a spicy sauce: Though not a shrimp fan, these things were cooked just right and had a kick ass sauce to drench bread in! I thoroughly enjoyed. 
 Maui Onion and Anchovy Salad with Tomatoes: I can't stand raw tomatoes whatsoever, but I had to give 'em a chance, and this salad was delish. The white anchovies and sweet onions paired perfectly with the diced tomatoes. The tomatoes almost seemd slightly cookedm they didn't seem raw at all! 
 Veal Saltimbocca: 5 stars! The veal, wrapped in sage and prosciutto were sauteed perfectly, and the prosciutto was very generous, not just some skimpy piece most places give. And the Garlic Mashed potatoes were silky and velvety, and stayed this way the entire meal. Most places they get hard due to excess butter and the like. 
 Desserts: Chocolate cake, creme brulee, and tiramisu. All looked fantastic, though I didn't try. 
 Their espresso I had was prepared perfectly though.
 Piero's really exemplifies what a true fine dining restaurant is really about. From start to finish, it's always flawless. The staff: friendly and not pushy or overbearing.

We've been here many times and after the last time we went there, I can truly say I've seen the ultimate downfall of this restaurant and we will never go back. 

The food is hit or miss. Sometimes it has been good (never great) but again, as of late, it's been mediocre at best. In the past, the ambience and venue made up for only ""good"" food... Not anymore. 

Cold artichokes, frozen seafood, bland sauces... I'll pay top dollar for food- if it's worth it. However, the food has become nothing more than Olive Garden quality at an insane price. 

I will say, the waiters and bartenders are friendly and attentive, however the owner is a rude old man who does not understand customer service and has a huge sense of entitlement. Just because your restaurant has been around for over 30 years does not mean that it will survive 30 more. Based on their Friday night crowd, I'd be surprised if it lasts more than 2 more years.

Also, the servers were as friendly as it gets, and they were quite knowledgeable on the menu. The service was excellent and attentive. Crusty sourdough loaves were promptly placed on the table and the house salad was exceptionally tasty as well.

For my entree I had the Linguini Portofino which contained the most succulent, candy-sweet scallops that I've probably ever tasted. The seafood was cooked to perfection! However, it seems the hit of the night was the gargantuan slab of red meat known as their Prime rIb special that had everyone's mouth watering (i don't eat red meat or pork, so I can't vouch for the taste). I swear the size of that prime rib would've put Fred Flintstone's brontosaurus ribs to shame!


Anyhow, for dessert I had the coconut sorbet and mixed berries. Heaven on a spoon! 

Yay! They had my Hendricks gin martinis, and that made me oh-so happy!  Of course I was the life of the office party (even though I didn't know anyone and my career isn't even remotely affiliated with dermatology! haha!)

It's decor is not only very dated but a bit shabby. Second the service is slow. Our reservation was for 8:00pm and we didn't order until 9:00pm. While some of the staff were courteous and efficent our waiter didn't seem particulary enthused to interact or wait on us. He read off the nightly specials with a dizzying speed that left most of us questioning what was what. I orderd one of the fish specials because I recalled that it had lemon and capers. When my dinner finally arrived approximately 90 minutes into the dining experience it neither tasted of lemon or had a single caper on it. After that long of a wait I wasn't sending it back. It was overall cooked perfectly but very bland. My husband's opinion of his entree (Pollo Al Carciofi) was the same, perfectly cooked but a little bland and boring.  

The wine list is extensive but expensive, bottles start in the $70.00 range and go up over $2000.00.  If you are interested in bringing your own bottle the corkage fee is $50.00 which was literally barked at us when we brought in a bottle as a gift which we had not planned to open there.

Lastly the restaurant was NOISY. Noisy to the point of nearly ruining our dining experience. Between two large gin soaked parties and the live music entertainment I had trouble following conversation at our own table.

We were handled by Patrick who took our drink orders and Manolo who handled our food orders.

Let's start with the salad which was ok but nothing special to say the least.  We move to the $14.00 bowl of soup which was again nothing special and here the waiter never brings the missing salad for the 1 person who had an appetizer even though it was requested.  

On we go to the entrees the Veal Parm's were pretty good but sides of potatoes & Vegetables with Veal Parm UGH.  The Veal De Chef which was covered with a couple of roasted peppers and cheese was virtually tasteless as was the Saltamboca which was burnt prosciutto on top of thin veal sautéed which was neither tender or very good.  The Sides were ice cold a mashed potatoes & grilled carrot & greens.  Both sides of pasta were POOR simple as that.  Let us also state that 45 minutes past from salad to Entrée which was completely ridiculous.  PASS on deserts or coffee.

Believe it or not, but the list of people who have eaten here could top the who's who of any restaurant in the world.

The service is phenomenal. The owner(s) are there every night, keeping an eye on everything that happens in there. All the waiters work together, so there is constant coverage of tables. Seriously, top notch.

I had the avocado and heart of Palm salad. It is deconstructed and simple, but is pure deliciousness. I ordered the bolognese and my husband had the filet. Both are over the top. The portions are huge and everything is just REALLY GOOD. My husband couldn't decide between the cut of meat he wanted, so the wait brought out both cuts RAW so my husband could see the marbling.

I don't know what planet he's on, but reasonable is not the first thing that comes to mind... it is a high ticket place... min. plate is $40... wine list starts at $50 a bottle... plus $50 corkage fee.  My Makers Mark on the rocks was a $19 drink.

With that said, that was some good Italian food.  The service was amazing, the ambiance was bang up good... and to boot there was a guy railing on Harry Reid at the table next.  Excellent!

Piero's has been featured in some major movies Casino for one, and it is a celebrity hide away. It is very unpretentious, you'll see Vegas locals and high rollers and everyone in between. I saw Justin Timberlake here once and Penne from Penne and teller.


OK...now to the food and service. The service is topnotch. Your never without a drink, they even offer bottled water for free not the usual filtered tap. When the bread basket comes it just out of the oven a delish!!!! The menu offers classic Italian and seafood. The Piero's classic is a bone in Veal Parm, I think its like 30 ounces.  

This is def a must for people who visit Vegas often and want to get off the strip. It is very old school Vegas, and reservations are a must.

5028716,2017-01-13,0,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"It's been 23 years since I last dined here. I remember it being a great meal. 
The place was exactly as I remembered. Old school off-strip dining for high rollers, mobsters, and tourists seeking Italian-American favorites a not-fussy atmosphere.

I didn't do as much restaurant eating back then, so it all seemed pretty amazing. 
I just returned yesterday and these days I'm more discerning...

When you drop $150/person on dinner you're going to expect perfection to earn your 5 stars. So here's the rundown on the food, and yes I'll nitpick everything:

Cocktails: Large, well-made, absolutely no complaints.
Wine: Just a few glasses since our cocktails were more satisfying than we expected. Only gripe was the advice of our waiter, which was more tuned to Vegas-folks than wine folks.
Appetizers: 
Shrimp cocktail (hey, it's Vegas right?) - excellent. Large well-cooked prawns with suuuuper spicy cocktail sauce in a good way.
Garbage Caesar salad: Delicious and well dressed. One of the hits of the night.
Tomato w/ Burrata: Maybe it serves us right for ordering a tomato in winter, but Vegas is all about out-of-season foods. This was a miss. Underseasoned, underdressed, poor quality control coming out of the kitchen.
Pastas:
Penne Vodka: Giant serving, well-sauced, perfect balance of tomato and cream. One of the better renditions, but the pasta could have been a bit more al dente.
Fettucini Arrabiata: Middling. It lacked that fresh-pasta-elasticity. Again, perhaps cooked a tad too long or sat too long waiting for service. Sauce was fine, serving size was also giant. 
Mains:
Veal chop parmigiana: This was huge, bone-in, pounded thin, breaded and sauced. Granted, after doing so much to the dish it's hard to judge the quality of the meat, but damn it tasted sooo good. This is a winner and probably the sort of thing you want in an Italian-American dinner in Vegas.
Osso Buco: This is their signature dish and oddly, it was just OK. Meat was quite nice, meltingly tender and with generous marrow, but the seasoning was kind of boring. I've had this with much better and more interesting sauce in other places.
Ginormous New York steak: It was delicious but cooked more than we had asked. We did point this out to the waiter and he agreed, but my agreeable friend said it was still fine for his purposes. (Perhaps our server could at least offered to fire a new one.)

Service: Very good. Cheerful, good sense of humor, added to the fun atmosphere of the night. Host, valet, bussers were all terrific. They do train their staff well here.

Ambience: Clubby old school vibe in a 1980's building with crappy exterior architecture. 

So nitpicks aside, our group had a really fun time at Piero's. A long, satisfying, uncomplicated meal. The prices were decent compared to on-strip dining at the fancy-chef places. The portions were generous and the food tasty. It's a solid 4 stars. The details could have pushed it to 5 and I hope the kitchen is open to feedback.",QyjBMVB_zE5K4xFNT74etA,3,0,4,KDZliVH4ywCSZ2emCHyO2Q

The portions were perfect for sharing (party of 3).  I ordered one of the specials that was told to us by the waiter, the veal & eggplant parmesan, this combo was absolutely delicious.  It was cooked to perfection and the veal was very tender.  My friends ordered the Ribeye which I had a taste of and not only was it the largest steak I've ever seen and cooked perfectly med/rare but the flavor was outstanding.  My other friend had the fresh fish I believe mahi mahi with pasta on the side, he ate it so fast I didn't get a chance to taste it but he said it was excellent.  For dessert we shared a creme brulee which I think I can say was the best I've ever had.  Our wait staff was very attentive and kept the drinks flowing.

A bit off the strip near the Las Vegas Convention center. We walk in and the mood is chill and on the upscale side. Definitely want to wear something nice to this restaurant. A classic, old Vegas atmosphere.

We were in a large group of 12. The restaurant was a little over half filled so you can tell it was a popular place. The service was prompt and great, the menu looked very good, and the specials of the day made it hard to choose a dish. I ended up with the Osso Buco, a veal shank with bone marrow and fresh egg noodles and creme sauce. The whole dish was very tasty. The shank meat was very tender and flavorful. The egg noodles were just right and the bone marrow was the highlight. 

Other dishes that were enjoyed by our group was a thick cut sword fish, lobster and chicken. Prices vary but can easily get up there, especially with the specials.

5158395,2015-06-02,2,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"Picture this:  Day 2 of a full day of ""Magic: The Gathering"" Grand Prix tournament at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  9:30 at night, no car, one very tired and hungry 11 year old.  I turn to Yelp for help....Piero's looks like my kind of place, but will they mind a kid, or the fact that we are dressed in shorts and t-shirts?  I call ahead and speak to a very kind maitre d, who assure me that it won't matter to them how we are dressed, they will have a table for us.

True enough, we arrive exhausted, in need of food and wine, and dressed at least 10 levels below the rest of the patrons, not to mention the wait staff.  Maitre d doesn't blink an eye, simply finds us a suitable booth and welcomes us to Vegas.  He was awesome!

Now for the important stuff:  food and service.

I'd love to say that for the price of this meal we were treated to 5-star service and the most amazing Italian fare outside of Tuscany.  In fact, other than the very prompt delivery of bread (hot and tasty, by the way) service was quite slow.  It took at least 20 minutes for our waiter to check in with us and deliver menus, and another 5-10 to get our wine order.  I know that this is not a ""fast food casual"" restaurant, but this delay had nothing to do with pacing -  we were simply forgotten!

On the plus side, the restaurant does offer half orders of pasta, which was the perfect solution for the kiddo.  The bolognese was quite tasty, as was the my tomato/cream based pasta dish with veggies.  Salads?  Not so great.  The greens might have been crisp originally, but once they were coated with the very thick house dressing, that crispness disappeared and we were faced with a limp pile of veggies.  Sad.

Cons: overpriced, rather ordinary food; slow service
Fros: right across from the convention center; close to our hotel; welcoming to all comers, even the under-dressed",tSV2koGpNi5F7uc0ldhWrA,2,0,2,98QvY_TOh1iAe-lJSwyNPw

Upon arriving, the maitre'd was unable to find our reservation. However, unlike the experience we had at El Dorado Cantina, he was able to seat us and ensured it would not be a problem.

The restaurant has a classy feel while embodying that ""mafia"" Vegas feel without the gimmick. You just feel like you're dining in a nice Italian restaurant that doesn't have to even try to be cool--it just is cool. The serving star is extremely attentive, personable and always knows the extensive menu and specials like the back of their hand. 

I have an issue branching out here...I always order the ""Garbage"" Caesar Salad as a started and the Osso Buco for a main. The Garbage Caesar is you standard Caesar salad but with the addition of shrimp, avocado and hearts of palm. The combination is really tasty and livens up an otherwise traditional salad. The Osso Buco isn't on the menu but is arguably the restaurant's number one seller. The shank is braised for 6 hours until tender and served along side a nest of fettuccine. What I love about their Osso Buco is the size of the shank -- it's huge, which means a lot of buttery marrow to go with it.

First trip was a few years ago, ran into a couple celebrities from CSI. We ordered a nice bottle of wine, calamari, and I got the ""a zuppa di pesce"". Sooo good and sooo much food. I finished the lobster and a lot of the large items, but couldnt finish some of the calamari. Really good dish that I almost got it the 2nd time I went.

2nd trip was more recent. Nice bottle of wine again, started with Calamari which may of been the most tender calamari I've ever had, the garbage ceasar which a few of the people were raving about, than the butterfly veal parm with eggplants. MAN!!! that veal parm was ridiculous. It was on special that night and I think a double cut, I only got about halfway through it and devoured the rest later. I was a bit shocked when the bill came to see the price on it (think it was $65 or $68). Holy crap! thats more than most steaks i've had at steakhouses, than again it was better than most steaks i've had at steakhouses so that eased the pain. There is a on menu veal parm which is nearly half the cost, so if I go back I will probably do that since I didn't need it to be that large.

We got there, valet the car and walk in. Very nice in the front, huge private party in the bar. We are then sat in this oversized corner booth that is connected to another couple sitting there, so romantic and intimate it is not, wait staff running around everywhere, like chickens with their heads cut off, very loud, and we seriously sat there with water and bread for over 10 mins, no menus, no waiter to take drink orders...just bread and water. Had our water refilled and a second loaf of bread before our waiter ever showed up. He finally showed up and took just our drink order, still no menus, even though I had asked the water guy for some and the waiter when he took our diet coke and tea order which we didn't receive for another 10 mins. Then finally after almost 30 mins sitting in our non romantic loud booth we receive our menus. The waiter then walked away, we reviewed the menus, ended up ordering the special features which were the garbage Cesar, caprese salad, Oso bucco and rock crab claws. 
Salads came out, those were great. 
Dinner came out and the display was ok. 
Rock crab was delicious but they were the same as any other restaurant that I've had them at, I had 6 of them. The oso bucco was a new experience for my fiance he had never had it before. Honestly it tasted like a good pot roast. Nothing special. He's actually made me a better pot roast in our crock pot.
The ambiance was terrible... the wait staff running around everywhere was very distracting, the old couple next to us yelling at each other because they couldn't hear each other talk was very distracting. The man at the next table upset because their calamari appetizer never came out and then his steak was wrong was all too much. Our drink glasses were empty but the water man was on our water...
But drinks empty. At $5 a soda and ice tea they never should have been empty. We saw our waiter 1 time after we were served and that was because he was dealing with the guy next to us with his steak issue. So he came by us after. 
The booths are not made for average size people...we are not huge people but felt very clostrophobic in the booth. The decor was random, not like the front, the back room they took us to had random pieces of 80s artwork on the walls, nothing like their website. 
Then we get the bill for this dinner that was nothing special ..
 $209.00!!!!! We would have better enjoyed the Golden Steer which had amazing ambiance, incredible service and food was the best we have had since living in Vegas. Being locals I feel like these tourist traps don't care how you are treated because they will probably never see you again, expensive for that reason, not because it is worth it, but because they can charge it knowing you will pay it and just never go back.  If you really want great Italian, great ambiance, service and food, go to Capos or to Chicago Joes!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,2,0,1,2YI18IYZJw1yXR98GHNjXg

We've been to Capo (lousy, never going back), Ferraro's (pretty good, never going back, but try it you might like it better than we did), and Casa Di Amore (love it, you will too).  Piero's has it all including some of the best bone in Veal Parm this guy has had in a long while.  They pour a pretty generous arctic cold vodka martini too.

Let's be honest, Piero's isn't cheap.  But hey, it's Vegas. Throw around a little cash once and a while and take that special someone in your life out for a terrific dinner and experience.",gJXuy_foQEwYINnlLZxZsw,3,2,5,dGmznfOlL7b_uP_zIiuVrg

We had 6:00 p.m. reservations, and, when all Las Vegas Convention Center lots were full at 3:45 p.m., restaurant management was kind enough to permit us to park here without charge.  Normally it is valet parking only.

When we returned from the Las Vegas Jewelry & Watch Show, Diane and I were quickly shown to our requested booth, and soon enjoyed a starter of cheesy and gooey Mozzarella Fritta with thin and spicy Marinara Sauce, along with exceptional crusty Italian bread and butter.  By the end of the meal, we (mostly me) had collectively consumed almost two entire loaves. 

A House Salad with fresh tomato, carrots, Green Bell Peppers, Red Onion, Iceberg Lettuce, and a light Italian Dressing was cool and refreshing, and a half Garbage Caesar Salad with Romaine Lettuce, tomato, a generous amount of avocado, croutons, Hearts of Palm, and large chunks of tasty shrimp was even more delectable.

I wanted to sample the Verdure e Legumi in Brodo, so I requested a half order.  When the so-called cup of soup arrived, I was shocked to see that the white lion-headed crock containing the hot liquid would have qualified as a bowl almost everywhere else.  But not here!  After being on the lookout for a bowl, I finally found one being carried through the dining room by a server.  And it was a huge white ceramic tureen covered by a plate.  As good as the soup was, I was glad that I only had to face a half order.  Filled with cauliflower, spinach, carrot spears, celery, vermicilli, mushrooms, and a very tasty vegetable broth, the soup was simply great.

The chef then surprised us by sending out from the kitchen complimentary Creamed Corn Au Gratin with Parmesan Cheese, which was sweet and creamy.  But nothing overshadowed my delicious signature dish entree of tender, falling off the bone Osso Bucco: a perfectly prepared slow-cooked veal shank mingling with a light tomatoey sauce and al dente fettuccine.  Meanwhile Diane greatly enjoyed her main of Veal Scaloppine Parmigiana topped by requested homemade Alfredo Sauce, and accompanied by splendid Roasted Potatoes.     

A dessert tray then beckoned with several tantalizing treats.  But, since Diane is allergic to berries, we had to turn back a chosen Cream Puff when we saw that it contained pieces of strawberry inside.  With sincerely expressed apologies, a slice of Carrot Cake with Coconut-Flaked Cream Cheese Frosting was quickly presented as a suitable replacement, for which we were not charged even though I was quite willing and poised to pay for everything we ate.  There was no reason for any restaurant employee to know of Diane's allergy.

Service from our highly competent waiter John Y. and his able assistants was on point all evening, with unbidden water refills, and requests for more bread and butter quickly accommodated.  Our booth was very comfortable, and, despite a bustling dining room, the ambiance was somewhat romantic with dimmed lights overhead.

For that reason alone, they deserve 5 stars when and if you can find them.  It's all old school all the way here, and I stress-- authentically old school, not a cheap chain knock-off.  It's the perfect place for people who have already found the men, women and friends that they want in their lives and don't give a rat's sphincter about seeing or being seen.  We're barflies so we eat and drink in the lounge and enjoy Pia Zadora when she's in town paying homage to all her old Rat Pack friends and lovers and their music. 
 The Osso Bucco is delish.  As is the eggplant parm. The last two times we were there they had Florida Stone Crab in the shell at $15 a pop (yeah, that's EACH), with a minimum purchase of 3.  We had 6, (yeah half a dozen) so, you do the math.  Only order them if you really, really love Stone Crab and haven't had them in a while and are absolutely dying for them--then, and only then, will they be worth the price. But, they were very fresh, large, and good, just like Joe's Stone Crab in Miami. Once you get past the sticker shock,  you won't be disappointed.",6c1t4iWwA-gcKFyyicPulA,0,0,5,_mHBXKUuty_UO6Z_VUcJPw

Well known for its elegance and sophisticated style dining and a hot spot for locals and celebrities, politicians and the worlds movers and shakers. The staff from valet drivers to bartenders and management will treat you like family especially if you're a regular patron. Live singer performers on the weekend too.",oDeTuwQ6N9NUX-HZaaD_dQ,0,0,5,0Ec4pRXUJ7xs0cphRM6-DA
5913442,2016-06-30,0,anQSLdujUOp0sTCmIBi2Tg,"We had heard such good things about Piero's we saved it for our last night this trip. It was a stunning disappointment.  I had the highly touted osso bucco and my wife the veal saltimboca. We did not finish either. As I told our very nice waiter, they were both unremarkable. I am a huge osso bucco fan and this was below average. My wife ate about 1/2 of hers. She rated hers the same. Rao's is head and shoulders above this. I should have smelled a rat when at 8 on a Wednesday it was maybe 1/2 full. The crab cake appetizer would have been good had the crab been fresh and not covered in a nasty sauce. The cook (chef would be too generous) send some complimentary cream corn which was made with either frozen or canned corn and could have been Stouffer's. The salads were airline grade. To cap it off we couldn't get a cab for about 15 minutes. I feared we were trapped in 'The Twilight Zone'.  The best part of the meal was we didn't get food poisoning. i rarely review on Yelp but Piero's is deserving of it.         As an addendum, I had dinner with a friend last night who goes to Vegas 4-6 x year to gamble and entertain clients. He told me ne was going to Pieros for the first time next month. Thankfully he has now changed his mind.",UjmGdhf48P-8Sx9tYKSG3w,1,0,1,eopj-PLyFsjivRRYO94Cjw

A lot of scenes from the movie Casino was filmed there and I'm sure that the mob has eaten here at one point haha. 

I've been here 4 or 5 times and every dining experience was phenomenal! I don't think I've ever looked at their menu because I've only ever ordered off the verbal specials. My boyfriend and I almost always order the Garbage Caesar Salad,  Osso Buco, and the Bone-in Veal Parmesan. Once you have the garbage Caesar salad, every other salad comes second. This is the best Caesar salad ever! They have somehow made a simple salad taste exceptional. The Osso Buco has been a house specialty for forever now! The meat is always so tender and the bone marrow is always a delightful treat. The Veal Parmesan is so yummy and just melts in your mouth. It's really flavorful! 

It's definitely a fancy pansy place but they don't have have artfully plated dishes. What's more important? Food that looks good or food that taste good? Definitely food that tastes good! I'll definitely keep coming here for years to come and I will recommend this restaurant over and over again! 

Other than the great food, the service is also outstanding so go try this place out!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,5,4,5,Piv7AW170PS4NaqT3-rjsg

Completely lives up to its reputation! Old school Italian restaurant with the classic clam sauce offered (optional gluten-free pasta)! Bruce the bartender made an exquisite Old Fashioned and the meal rocked my world! Not to be missed!",iHDBSzkBXPmERPGekfC7-A,0,0,5,hD7EqJeM5bl2jnAK1OQp8A
