I got off of work and was very hungry, realized I had no food at home, and made the impulse decision to stop in here.  There was no line so I ordered quickly.  My food was ready in a few minutes.  

First, these sandwiches look absolutely nothing like the pictures.  Smaller, grayer, and totally unappealing to the eye.  The taste was blah but whatever I just wanted some food in my belly.  

Second, the place was full of crazy people.  They were being loud and obnoxious and generally behaving like crazy people do.  I should have gotten drive-thru but ate inside because i was hungry.

The place seems great and the cashier was friendly. My only knock on a star was you have to ask to use the bathroom. And there is no drink machines. They get your drink for you. Some people like this but I do not. That's all I have so guess. WiFi is slow but they use CenteyLink so what do I expect. It's going to be slow.

1460871,2016-02-26,5,RBVtuVodydOMkNr-RVTVYA,"This Jack in the Box is so scary, at least for me. I can't come here at night anymore. I'll be honest and say that during daylight hours it's almost as decent as a 2-star... But I still wouldn't recommend you to try this location. Its on the corner of Flamingo and Swenson, very dark area though.

The customers and people lurking around this area seem very sketchy/suspicious. Wierd things happen whenever I come to this locaion. I would go through drive-thru whenever I can only to avoid the bums around this place. I only come here because it's less than a minute drive from my apartment. The food quality is as every other Jack in the Box. The service is a little below average, kind of slow, once had to be asked to park in the parking lot because the 24 hr drive thru was ""closed"". I give props to the workers though, being able to deal with their customers who come in and out of there using their bathroom without purchasing anything.

Also, everytime I use the drive-thru they're always out of desserts, so much for late night cravings...

On the bright side, theres another Jack in the Box on Maryland if you do decide to find another Location. (I'll warn you that its not that much greater of a location either but theres more light there.)",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,7,4,2,037N-wny-cQh2Ap5zSHIcw

It was my first time at a jack in the box and the guy at the intercom was extremely helpful and patient.  While the food was a cookin' he struck up conversation and said he was going to include some free things since we were visiting.  This guy and the woman packing the food really wanted to make our experience one worthy of 5 stars.

I turn from Flamingo road into the strip mall and, going across the lot traffic, maneuver my car into a parking space from the opposite direction. A small feat considering I'm driving across the drive-in lane to park. But it's Jack-In-The-Box....It's gonna be worth it because I'm hungry. Go inside and a loitering customer is talking to the guy at the desk. Dude is friendly so I cut him some slack. The server is friendly too. I'm not sure what I want so I wait a bit before ordering a portabello mushroom burger. I wait a bit and it seems longer than usual because I'm hungry. I pace a bit sipping my drink because I have that part of the order already. When my order arrives, I walk towards it. A girl from back in the kitchen asks ""Who's portabello is this?"" When I step up to get it, she glances at me, makes a disparaging face and tosses the bag on the counter in my direction. Fucking bitch! It had been a long day and I was hungry and not ready to start a fight so I just took the burger, left and figured she has having a bad day. Nah she was just a bitch. I don't see myself coming back here again. Not like I'm in town all the time, but next day I went to In-N-Out burger and if you read my review of that location, you'll see why this Jack Off in a Box won't be seeing me anytime soon.

No problem with service but my son LOVES the toys that come in the kid's meals why I always get them. This trip he got an antennae head as a toy even though the plastic covering for this ""toy"" clearly states ""this is not a toy."" Poor kid was so disappointed. I ordered the kid's meal chicken nuggets and my son was loving them. He LOVES chicken nuggets. I noticed after the third one he was trying to remove a small rope like string from his mouth. I took it out and I'm pretty sure it was in the chicken nugget. It looked like a white string stained brown probably from being in the breading of the chicken nugget. Now if it was cooked into the nugget this wouldn't be Jack in the Box's fault but I thought it was quite strange. I give it an extra star because my burger was delicious!

4103819,2012-02-15,5,RBVtuVodydOMkNr-RVTVYA,"It has been so long since I did a review, I feel badly that I am doing this for Jack In The Box. Especially since I had done one a year ago for this same location... But my experience today was so bad I feel it needed to be documented.
I arrived at 5:05pm. There were two people in front of me at the register. When the man who was ordering was finished the cashier/manager walked away without saying anything. A few minutes had passed and she was still gone. I was 2nd in line and stepped to the Kiosk to place my order. Smart thinking on my part, not waiting till the cashier was back from break (or maternity leave).

My order was placed and I waited, and waited and waited. Being tall made it easy to look at the display monitor and see that my order had been in for a little over 10 minutes. But I kept waiting, and waiting.

At 15 minutes I flagged down the Drive Thru cashier. I told her it was obvious I was not getting my food, so could I get my money back? She called to the manager in the back that she needed a refund, then looked back at me and said ""your food is ready. Do you want it""? I told her I would take the food.

She scrambled for a moment, then told the manager she better give me the refund. 
After a couple minutes of pushing buttons I was given my money back without an apology or even an explanation as to why I wasn't getting my food instead. I did get a snotty comment from her about them being short of help and how she needed to give the cook a break. (Seemed odd that the cook gets his break at 5pm dinner hour and the dining room closes, but like my brother says, ""you can't argue with minimum wage"").

I went home and began cooking dinner. As it cooked I took the online survey at ""talktojackinthebox[dot]com"" and gave a pretty bad review. Oddly enough, I had little problem with the slow service time. My gripe was the poor way my complaint was handled. 

Now, for the total shocker. In under 5 hours from submitting the online form I received a call from the store's General Manager. At first thought you would be impressed at just how important that feedback is to them. You might assume that someone in the corporate office saw that and called the GM at home to deal with it. As for me, I was thinking ""Who the #@&# is calling me at 9:48pm""?

Being in that restaurant for more than 20 minutes without a single employee acknowledging I was there has me suspect they are out of touch with the customers. Calling me at 12 minutes to ten to talk about it just proves it.

So Jack, here is my summary: I love you commercials, but the customer service is worse than deplorable. If being short of help is the problem I will do everything in my power to assist you. By NEVER returning to one of your restaurants you will need less staff, therefore, you are no longer short of help. Problem solved!",Jql0kDX77dWUZcRzGjPXLg,3,2,1,xuxJEqhnL7fDilY3Spk10A

Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and 2 orders of the value tacos and a number 5 double jack with cheese. Here is the break down for tonight's disappointing eats

1/5 value tacos was so bland taste like cardboard

3/5 spicy chicken sandwich nothing special or stood out

1/5 double jack with cheese I didn't eat it because I was full of disappointment 

4/5 Onion Rings not bad 

3/5 large strawberry shake it was ok nothing god or bad

For late night owls saved your stomach and $ and go somewhere else.",4EFxo9eO04hOHuPDF7d43Q,1,0,2,SCjk5aS4LXwsIzUz_fNCCQ
