1375847,2016-07-03,13,1fG7Xg4dLzcKIApzJiXtXw,"Tae Heung Gak is a new restaurant next to the Greenland supermarket. It specializes in Korean-ized Chinese food. After a visit, I liked what I saw and tasted.

After walking in, I sat down and noticed that the interior was simply done, but that there was no AC but a fan, it could be that the AC was down or not in operation as of yet, but hopefully, this will be remedied in the near future.

Looking through the menu, it seemed to have some items such as similar restaurants, like Red Gate Wok, or Island Style on Sahara, have, but more. I ordered #11, the Sacheun Style Jjam Ppong. I've never had this version of this soup before, so I thought it was worth a shot. It's basically the non-spicy version of this soup. I thought it was good, I prefer the spicy version of the soup, but everything tasted good. All the seafood was fresh, and the noodles were cooked really well. They had some sides of kimchi, pickled daikon, and onions, and it was good, the kimchi was really good.

I think the better deal might be at the Red Gate Wok inside of the Greenland Supermarket, but the quality here is definitely much better. I would compare it to the Korean-Chinese dishes at Island Style on Sahara, but I would probably say that the quality at THG is slightly better. I would like to be back to check out some of the other dishes here. But I thought the quality was good, and I thought that value-wise it was OK.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,20,23,4,fhdZzRgEG7GsfcuAXzM0Yw

I didn't had high expectations with the food over here considering the fact that it's a small restaurant right next to the supermarket. After we sat down, we ordered a combo #1 which comes with either black bean noodles or spicy seafood noodles with either the fried chicken/shrimp or the sweet and sour pork.
However, the food was better than I expected; I personally loved their kkhangpung shrimp which is the fried shrimp mixed with tangy sauce. It was pretty crispy and good. Overall, we enjoyed the food that we had here and would definitely come back.",xs3WkB0hD_8Aa0Xo7Uypvg,0,1,5,GMjGqcmu48xwV5zErxuXwQ

I hope you read this. You use too much MSG in your food. Too. Damn. Much.

If my body feels like it's completely shutting down after I ate a bowl of your jjajangmyeon, it's easy to know what's the culprit. It all started when my coworker and I lamented there aren't too many good black bean noodle places in Las Vegas. He mentioned several of his friends tried Tae Heung Gak and so we decided to try it for lunch. We ordered the jjambbong, jjajangmyeon and tangsuyook.

The service was excellent. Once our food arrived we digged in and loved it. I was even close to saying the jjajangmyeon is better than the one at Baeklian which is currently my fav jjajangmyeon place. We began driving back to the office.

While on the drive back, that's when we both felt it...holy shizz..The impeding MSG drowsy doom from hell. Except this time it was one of the strongest ones I've felt in my life, hands down. It's like the biggest coffee crash ever and as if I just got done writing a 20 page paper on -insert boring ass topic here-. The drive alone was tough but once we got back to the office, we had to sit in on the most mundane office meeting regarding project management + version control (fun stuff right?) for over two hours. Two hours! In the darkest meeting room in the building to boot. I think I honestly snored a few times during the meeting. If my boss wasn't in the room I probably would've just lied down and taken a nap on the floor right then and there.

Not only did the drowsy MSG spell completely engulf my physical body, I was parched out of my life. I never had MSG make me so damn thirsty like I was that day. If I didn't have access to water I may have needed an IV to resurrect myself.

I'm throwing alot of hyperboles but my point is I seriously will never return unless they change their MSG usage. I'm willing to try the place one more time because during the time of eating, it was pretty damn good. But if I have a negative experience again, I'm definitely dropping down to one star. My first ever one star at that.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,3,1,2,91V63hVZgJoDPDR4boN7Mg
2976608,2018-02-09,0,1fG7Xg4dLzcKIApzJiXtXw,"Super good restaurant for your Korean Chinese food cravings. The seafood spicy noodles was excellent broth with  plenty of seafood and noodles, the black bean noodles were heavy and satisfying, and the fried pork was crispy and light with a sweet sauce. 

Definitely will be back again.

*I also agree with a previous review, they seem to use a lot of MSG. Knocked out within 30 minutes after the meal so beware! It's delicious food but packs a knockout salt punch.",ZsxCFrJm3Q_XTNtb4koaFA,0,0,5,nghgrS0JSZkHDV5gC9uLFg

I need to start eating here more often. It's quite far from my house, but it's definitely worth the drive. They have Korean style sweet and sour pork! OMG!! It's so good. Not to sweet and super crispy! It's like I'm in heaven. Plus when you sit you get yummy boricha (barley tea)! Mmm.. order the pork and send me a thank you!",_PN5byES4XWl2vTKLAN6dw,1,0,5,F2U-YUmOROLIIq6mrnjOEw

Being next to puppy town isn't very apealing either. I keep going back because it's the same owner as  jin me on sahara when jjampong, jja jjang mein, and tangsuyuk was awesome but i guess it's not the same cook. It's just not that great.

4412077,2018-06-20,0,1fG7Xg4dLzcKIApzJiXtXw,"FINALLY. If you've ever had jjajjamyung from South Korea you know it's one of the best dishes over there (at least amongst my peers). This is the only restaurant I have been to in America that actually serves it almost as accurately as the ones in South Korea. I have tried it in many other states such as Arizona, Seattle, Portland, Beaverton, and Los Angeles and none of them fill the perfect combination like this one.

Service/Atmosphere: Good. Lot of asian restaurants I feel are more oriented towards getting food out being as productive as possible while keeping the quality in tact so sometimes they neglect service. Not saying it was bad or anything like that, it just wasn't memorable or anything special (AND THAT IS OKAY FOR ME). 

Price: Also good! It's cheap and definitely even more cheap when you compare to other places to eat especially during the strip when you visit for Vegas. You're not going to be breaking the bank and also going to get quality food. I definitely think it's worth every penny.

Food: This is why the 5 stars are here for me. The gyoza was good and better then usual gyoza but that's not the star of the show. Now I love Jjajjamyung or Black Bean noodles and this is the only place I have ever been since I've been to other cities/Korea that accurately depicts the same taste as the one in Korea. Other places always try to throw in their own mix/variety into such a simple dish to make it off for me. I am so happy that I found someplace that understands how to make black bean noodles effectively.

Small little place, cheap, great food. What's not to love? Also side note: it's next to a shop with puppies!! You can go look at so many cute dogs afterwards.",ML8TIZVdqF9nB27QE2gzHQ,0,0,5,oGwMX4t1DlhOXRLJln-XTA
4586735,2017-05-21,0,1fG7Xg4dLzcKIApzJiXtXw,I really like this place. Must try their kkhangpung chicken/kkhangpung shrimp! It is super crunchy on the outside and the sauce that goes with it tastes like a sophisticated sweet and sour sauce and it's really good. I like their jjambbong and special jjajangmyeon as well (has more flavor than regular jjm). I'm never disappointed here.,_9ahnqiGkHKOEDIlibAT2g,0,0,5,eV1TNcm63vbK1OVtW9A4MQ
4701435,2017-05-15,6,1fG7Xg4dLzcKIApzJiXtXw,"I came here for one thing and one thing only: Jajangmyeon (Korean Black Bean Noodles).

It's a generous bowl for $7.99; served with the traditional accompaniments of Takuan (pickled daikon), fresh onion in vinegar, and concentrated black bean sauce.

The sauce is rather viscous (this could be remedied by simply adding water) and decent in flavor. The noodles were okay albeit overcooked. Overall, it's not a bad bowl of Jajangmyeon, but certainly not special.

There's not much else to say about this dish as its preparation is simple and the price is inexpensive and basically the same everywhere. Bottom line: Would I come back for the Jajangmyeon? No... not when there are better versions in town.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,9,8,3,Sq_Iwg-wRrzCQ3n5bVj9HQ

5928773,2017-03-21,0,1fG7Xg4dLzcKIApzJiXtXw,"I think this place is super underrated. I love their fried chicken and shrimp thing. It is called kkhangpung chicken/kkhangpung shrimp on the menu but I have no idea what kkhangpung means. I usually get the combo that they offer. 
I recall combo #1 comes with the fried chicken/shrimp thing or sweet/sour pork with choice of jiajang myeon (the black bean paste noodle), Jjam pong (spicy seafood noodle), or fried rice. 
I think combo #2 you get sweet/sour pork with fried chicken/shrimp and choice of starch. 
Depends on how hungry we were we usually rotate between combo #2 or #1 with occasional menu adventure. We were never disappointed with their food. 

There's one time that we decided to try out the mandu. When the food came it appeared to be 4 huge steam buns with meat filling. I was really surprised because whenever I order mandu at Korean places it's always those tiny dumplings. 
I looked up mandu on wikipedia and it means mantou in Mandarin. However mantou is indeed steam bun but with no fillings. 

Service here is always nice and attentive. Definite recommend people who want to try some non-Kbbq places.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,3,0,5,7wuQO8jHl3g_ShQYiwNIFQ
