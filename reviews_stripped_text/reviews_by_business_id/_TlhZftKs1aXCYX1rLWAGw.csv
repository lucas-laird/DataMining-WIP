201741,2014-02-17,1,_TlhZftKs1aXCYX1rLWAGw,"We came to town on Valentine's Day to celebrate my youngest son's 21st b-day (yes, it's on V-Day).  Sadly, the drive from L.A. was more hellish than usual and we got to our condo so late that we skipped out on driving to Fremont.  (however, we did find Ellis Island nearby and enjoyed that for what it is! see my review)

I really wanted to make sure my sons went down to Fremont where I knew we'd end up in Bayou so we came Sunday after breakfast (Omelette House- divine!) .  I've been here before (of course, back in 2001 I think the daiquiris were about 1/3 the price!).  I really don't enjoy gambling, but I do like to sit at a REAL coin-op slot machine and pull the arm of the one-armed bandit with my own hand.  There is something very satisfying about plunking coins in and hearing your winnings clink into the tray.  A classic Vegas experience that is hard to come-by today. 

I truly hope they NEVER get rid of those machines!  

It's a friendly place and a must-visit stop on Fremont.  We had a blast and were only sorry that we couldn't come at night and get they whole ""Experience!""   We will be back!

*note to self:  The drinks are stronger than they look.  
We got the hurricane, white Russian, and mud slide flavors and enjoyed them all.  I think I liked my son's white Russian best because it tasted like vanilla ice cream.  YUM!",-2LAw4y4cqjP7vAbv8zCMQ,1,1,5,djgTF8pn4tKJn7wIJMxIrA

Leave all your expectations of a flashy, on the strip casino at the door. This place was probably the length of a trailer and the mood felt as such. If your nostalgia of old-school, mob run Vegas casino is a thick of smoky air, visions of retirees throwing away their Social Security checks, all the while hacking into the open air, then this is the place for you.

While we did indeed intended to play the coin slots, it began to be cumbersome when switching from one unlucky machine to the next to cash out your funds. Even more irritating was the fact that not all the betting denominations are the same, and not all machines will take particular coins. They do give you plastic buckets for the coins, even if they made you want to find the nearest hand sanitizer after handling them. We only put in $20 each and quickly realized why the rest of the casinos have adopted the printed ticket voucher system.

The cashier was very nice as were the employees that greeted you at the entrance. They'll give you free Mardi Gras beads when you walk in the door as well as a spin voucher for a chance to win up to $10,000.

The ladies at the daiquiri bar were super nice and friendly, offering any samples we wanted. We ended up going for some red bull and vodka in a football cup, its worth the money and isn't as sugary as those daiquiris, which albeit are delicious, but will do more harm than good in the end.

2659237,2015-09-21,9,_TlhZftKs1aXCYX1rLWAGw,"La Bayou deserves a 5/5 rating because you get what you pay for and considering the niche market that it goes after, it fits the bill quite perfectly. My largest criticism is really rather historical in nature and cannot be held against the current owners in the slightest. Allow me to explain: 

Make no mistake, La Bayou is a dive. A throwback to casinos from the seedy 1980's days of Las Vegas. Actual coins are heard throughout the tiny slot house clinging almost musically to the ear reminiscent of days gone by. When Benny Binion and Jackie Gaughan were in constant battles over who controlled Downtown and when a cheater had a back room and a tack hammer to look forward to if he got caught. Of course, La Bayou is strictly a slot house so no table games to worry about. The staff us minimal at best but work hard to manage the property. The cocktail waitresses are a pretty hard working and borderline overworked group of ladies as they seem to work both Mermaids across the street as well as La Bayou. Drinks served are strictly low shelf, well only, but you wouldn't expect much more. And they are served in tiny 6 ounce plastic cups, which once again, goes with the territory and you get what you pay for. 

One point I did want to address is that the cocktail waitresses are nothing if not aggressive. As soon as you walk in, before you even drop a twenty in a machine, a waitress is asking what you would like to drink. One major tip I would say to ANYONE is that you are prepared to tip the ladies for the beverage. The fact that it's a slot house doesn't matter in the slightest and don't even think of tipping one or two quarters. Though this casino may be a time capsule to 1982 doesn't mean that inflation hadn't occurred. Have cash or several quarters and tip the Vegas standard of $1 per drink. There. Tangent over. 

La Bayou was once known as Coin Castle. It was known as Coin Castle for the better part of 25 years from 1969 through 1996. Here is where we come to my one and only major criticism of the property: I totally respect that times change and the need to rebrand and stay relevant are integral to business success, but why La Bayou? Why not leave well enough alone and keep that glorious Coin Castle King atop the tiny little building. He looked a hell of a lot like King Friday from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood (with an oddly Asian eyeline) and he was literally an institution in Downtown Las Vegas. I do not hold this against the owners of course, but the nostalgia bug in me saddens me every time I go to the Neon Museum and see the once tall Coin Castle King that overlooked Fremont now on display in a museum instead of welcoming guests to a classic old Vegas throwback. 

The history of this tiny slot joint doesn't end there though. Predating the Coin Castle and the Monte Carlo Club, this site was once home to the very historical Northern Club. Mayme Stocker was the first woman ever to be granted a gaming license and she did so on the very land that the Bayou currently occupies (but not the same physical building, unfortunately). Nestled adjacent to the Golden Gate, the La Bayou is truly a throwback in every sense of the word. 

The owners of La Bayou also own Mermaids and the Girls of Glitter Gulch strip club. Mermaids and La Bayou are pretty much run by the same team I believe and the girls that give out the beads walk back and forth across Fremont constantly. 

La Bayou does not offer a restaurant but they do offer a simple change counter/cashier that cashed you out in the back and a bar that offers value priced daiquiris and mixed drinks in oversized glasses. I would like to see the daquiris offered complimentary to players (even if only served in the tiny plastic cups) but beggars can't be choosers. 

Overall, La Bayou is worth visiting because of the history alone. Because of the true throwback to 1970's and '80's Las Vegas. And because places like this are disappearing faster than you can say MGM Resorts International, and you definitely want to visit it before it and places like it all disappear and are remembered only in Travel Channel retrospectives. Grab a coin bucket, dig out those quarters from your couch cushions, and a pack of smokes and head out to Coin Castle.....er.....I mean La Bayou as soon as you can. And most importantly, don't take anything there too seriously. Just have a good time and enjoy the passage into old Vegas. Tell the Spirit of the Coin Castle King that I said hello.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,17,12,5,PPY43--Bw4jbnwZvrVReSQ

You can also get an extra shot but it makes the drink watery and in my opinion a little too strobg and kills the drink. Upon entering you also get beads and a ticket to enter a raffle.

I wouldn't mind so much except I had an issue with the security guard who pinpointed me as ""trouble"" i suppose since it was Halloween and I was wearing a HAT that looked like a lion- it's a hat for CHILDREN. Perhaps I scared him, but he told me in order to remain in this establishment I'd have to remove my hat. 

I found this to be interesting since there were PLENTY of people inside of the casino wearing hats and not being asked to take theirs off. Many were in costume. Many were extremely shady looking, but he just passed by them without a second glance. 

Maybe he really dislikes lions. Either way, he pissed me off.

1. As you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a women in a bright purple Mardi-Gras like jumpsuit holding beads. Before you enter, she chooses three beads for you (that just so happen to match your outfit) and puts them around your neck. Then she gives you a raffle ticket letting you know that the raffle happens every thirty minutes for the chance to win prizes. 

2. Next you step foot inside. Immediately you are welcomed by a cocktail waitress who offers you a drink. The drinks are complimentary as long as you gamble. 

*** Like I said, this is a teenie tiny casino with two walls of slot machines and one row in the middle. It's the old school type slot machine with quarters and the plastic tubs to put them in. 

3. As you gamble quarter slot machines and sip your free drink, beware because you might win and if you do, the staff will treat you like you won a million bucks (even though you just won $80 in the slot machine). They will also immediately hand you a business card so you remember where you were. And guess what? I did remember which is why I'm writing this review! 

4. During your time here you will get great service, free drinks, mardi gras beads and you might even leave with a prize. 

Now remember, this isn't a casino on the strip and it's pretty old and rundown. But it's cheesy in a great way and worth the experience.

I've never gone when there wasn't a line, but it moves pretty quickly. Make sure to grab your free beads on the way in. Also one of the last places around where you can find slot machines that actually pay out and take coins.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,6,3,iKmLVC_xVElfjPJDTxdI0g
