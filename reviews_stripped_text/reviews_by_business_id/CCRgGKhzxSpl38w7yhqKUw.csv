The chicken noodle soup tasted so fresh and if you aren't used to fresh bland flavor, then you will just think it is bland. I loved it though becuase I can taste the ingredients and veggies instead of seasonings. 
The chow mein, fried rice, and sweet and soup chicken were great and some of the best asian food choices I've had. It was flavorful and didn't taste ""fake"".

Tasty yet you don't walk away feeling stuffed or bloated after eating them. However, also ordered the wonton noodle soup. They provide good number of shrimp wontons but broth was bland and served in a small soup bowl. Noodles in the soup were more than adequate however they tried to pack the noodles with the wontons in a small bowl, with little to no soup that the noodles get swollen if you don't eat the dish quickly. Also ordered Garlic sautéed pea shoots were average. But this side dish can complement an entree for 3-4 ppl. Vegetable dumplings were ok.

47697,2009-01-06,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"We were quite tired after our drive from SoCal, so we decided to eat at the Bellagio, where we were staying for a few nights. The ""cheapest"" thing we could find here was this Asian restaurant named...Noodles.

At 15 bucks for something like chow mein, you're paying for the decor or something else, certainly not the food. Rows and rows of dried noodles were on display on the shelves.

Even with my parents paying our tab, our hands were tied from being thrifty folks, so we tried finding some of the cheaper things on the menu. This meant things like the Signature Premiere Rice..

...which was bland fried rice despite the bits of pineapples and raisins they stuck in there.

The Signature Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles with Barbeque Pork was surprisingly good, although the dish was a bit heavy on the onions. The noodles were thick and tasty.

And the Yaki Udon with Chicken was just average, on the salty side, and heavy on the bell peppers, although I liked the texture of the noodles themselves.

The chicken slices were quite large in this dish.

These three dishes cost about 50 bucks and barely fed three adults and two young kids. When you're stuck in a Vegas casino and you've got few options, a place like Noodles is a decent place to get overpriced food. Otherwise, get in a car or taxi and head over to Vegas Chinatown for better Asian food.

112226,2013-08-31,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"Here is how to eat cheaply on the Vegas Strip. Well, relatively cheaply. Eating at McD would be the truly cheap option, but I thought we were on vacation, were we not? The answer to eating relatively cheaply on the Vegas Strip is... wait for it (don't worry, I won't switch to commercial break on you. Please, I am not Gordon Ramsay)... Noodles at Bellagio.

Noodles is an Cantonese restaurant located right off the Bellagio casino floor. Super duper convenient, if I do say so myself. Noodles specializes in Cantonese cuisine. Decor wise, Noodles was simple and humble, nothing extravagant in comparison to the other Bellagio restaurants. 

We liked Noodles so much, we ate here twice during our short trip to Vegas. The first time was on a Sunday, where they went the traditional route and had Dim Sum cart service. This is when the restaurant makes a bunch of small plates, stack them on a cart and have a waiter/waitress push the cart around the restaurant floor, where patrons can flag down the cart and order a small plate directly from the cart. Even though this is the traditional way, I have never been a fan. You can only choose what's on the cart and it's often served luke warm. Okay, I'll stop my complaining now. Moving on, we had the pan fried shrimp & chive dumplings and fried radish cake. Both were luke warm (of course they were! this method is flawed). The pan fried shrimp & chive dumplings had great flavours, despite being slightly oily. The radish cake was not the best I have had.

We also shared the Wonton Noodle and the Roasted Duck Rice. What I loved about the Wonton Noodle is that the wonton fillings were all shrimp, giving each wonton a great springy bite and also making this a light dish. The Roasted Duck Rice was awesome. When I ordered it, the waitress asked me ""with bone or boneless?"" You can get boneless roasted duck on rice? This is brand new information to me. I was impressed. Cantonese style BBQ duck served on rice is a pretty common dish and being a BBQ-duck-lover, I have had it many times from various restaurants. I have never been offered the option of going boneless before. I can finally, for the first time in my life, eat roasted duck on rice like a proper lady with no need to wrestle the meat off the bone with my teeth and channelling my inner animal self while gnawing on the bone. I do paint a vivid image, don't I? ;) The duck was delicious, nice and fatty, just how I like it. I ordered it again on our second visit.

I highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you are spending your day gambling at the Bellagio casino floor. ;) I recommend saving this restaurant for a weekday lunch, because I think Noodles and The Buffet are the only restaurants open for lunch service at the Bellagio on a weekday.

Please visit my blog, where I documented my recent trip to Las Vegas. I have food photos! Thank you for your time. :)

121912,2011-06-09,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"My friends and I ate here in April on a Friday night, after the ""O"" show ended.  We wanted some Asian food, saw the name ""Noodles"" and we were sold.  We went in expecting the food to taste Westernized, but it was actually pretty good.  The restaurant was pretty full, but we were seated within 15 mins.  

I saw ""Laksa Curry Noodle"" on the menu and my eyes lit up.  I still reminisce about the authentic and oh-so-good food I had while in Malaysia, so I was looking forward to trying the version here.  

The bowl was full of chunks of chicken breast, fish ""cake"" slices, an egg, a load of noodles, and creamy curry sauce.  Although it wasn't as authentic as the laksa noodle dishes I had in Malaysia, Noodles' version is pretty good.  Of course the price ($18) is a bit steep for a bowl of noodles, but it's to be expected since it's located inside the lovely Bellagio (see pic).

My friends ordered the Vietnamese Seafood Pho (just ok, not authentic enough) and the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle (nice hearty flavor).  

I would eat here again if I was too lazy to catch a cab to the plethora of Asian restaurants located on Spring Mountain Road (off the strip).",o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,0,0,3,-tMxI-y2c3tHdqkG27JrXg

We came to Noodles because my husband and I had too much fun the previous night and wanted soup. We were staying at Vdara and Noodle was a short walk over. We were aware the lines may be long but we arrived at 1 pm on a Sunday and there were 4 parties in front of us. We were shown a table in 20 minutes. 
They have an extensive menu with all the favorite dishes (like egg noodle and wontons, fried rice, Chinese broccoli, etc). It was confusing because they had a dim sum menu inside their menu and a dim sum menu on a piece of paper (like how you would normally order dim sum) and the prices were different. It took us a while to figure out that dim sum was still available via the cart and is cheaper to order from there than on the menu. 
My husband and I ordered the shu Mai (2 ordered cause it ended up being so good, but only comes with 3 pieces instead of 4), har gow, egg noodle soup with wonton, cucumber salad, and Shanghai noodle. 
The shu Mai was the best, but everything else was mediocre and over priced. The cucumber salad was too sweet and the Shanghai dumpling was dry. I compare these two items to Din Tai Fung and it's better there than it is here! It was an experience that I don't want to have again.",tXwjzAqrnEtRQnQs9XNehQ,0,0,3,ajl9rr6BrZ9wA6C8J8HELA

The beef noodle is pretty good that the beef is really tender and well boiled. Also, you could add ducks and chashao for small dishes to save your dollars at a really late time. 
They only have a few options for dim sum, taste normal.

Basically $20 per order. The portions are small compared to your typical chinese restaurants. We were there with six in our party and we order five dishes. Two noodle dishes, one fried rice, one meat and one tofu dish. Thinking that this should be plenty of six people as one order is most chinese restaurants if far more food than can be eaten by one person,  but we polished off everything and could have eaten a sixth dish but we had a show to catch so we decide not to add anything. We ate around 6 pm and no line to be seated but when we left there was a line of around 20 people. The restaurant is small  and decor is interesting with the bottles of dried food items on one wall and the other wall had these rope wall hangings that seem out of place for a chinese restaurant .  Nevertheless it is probably the lowest priced place for dinner in Bellagio where you can get dinner for $20/person. Basically it was okay but have to rate it down due to the price and portion size.

We ordered the Hainan chicken, ate some of the white meat, and then noticed that the dark meat was a color that we had not seen from chicken before -- like a muddy gray. I pointed it out to the waitress, and she offered to replace the chicken but at that point, I thought it was kind of risky. She gave us a mango pudding and an ice tea to go, which was nice but still not worth the $20 plus dollars we paid for the dish. 

The oxtail soup was kind of a joke.  The soup was the standard dark broth you get when ordering beef brisket noodle soup.  

The pork lo mein was overly drenched in sauce.

The pork chow mein was fine. Everything tasted fine--a SoCal point of reference: on par with a meal from Sam Woo's. But it was definitely not worth $75.

It's a very casual place that caters to convenience of being right there and serves trendy and upscale Americanized Asian bistro. Of course, like most of these hotel restaurants, it prices itself way high and makes you think you're getting a better experience than you really are getting. The service is decent, not great, but decent. 

On my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.

I applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of ""what do you want to eat,"" not ""can I answer any questions you might have?"" 

Overpriced, yes. Underwhelming, no. If you find yourself in a pinch like I did, needing to grab a bite to eat while on a break, Noodles is a good choice. Otherwise, I'd stick to finding other real-deal restaurants in Vegas and steer clear.",jierO7pbroyHWTjDDhMubQ,1,1,3,BLVfST0_DN6tMmlfklXvuw

Many people seem to know this because the line can stretch pretty far out the door. We try to eat earlier rather than later because it seems like the line doesn't diminish after a certain hour.  Turnover is fairly quick, though.

Okay, so you order a bowl of won ton and noodle soup because the rum and cokes you're drinking have been eating away your stomach lining.

599653,2010-10-11,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"Noodles (the food) are great for a hangover, and it is tough to visit Vegas without ending up with a hangover at some point.  I wandered the strip for hours looking for just the right thing to cure my previously over-indulgent night, and was about to break down and eat just about anything, when I remembered the curative properties of a bowl of noodle soup.  I broke out my trusty iPhone and yelp app, and narrowed it down to Noodles (the restaurant), which was closest to my current location.

Noodles is right off the Casino in The Bellagio, but has neither that crowded casino feel, nor that high end, 'I am going to get fleeced' feel.  Pleasant contemporary decor, with a lot wood, and a not-too-crowded-or-noisy atmosphere made me feel immediately comfortable.  The Dim Sum cart was making rounds, so I tasted a few basic dumplings, all pretty solid.  Followed that up with a bowl of wonton noodle soup.  It was served piping hot, and the dumplings were tasty.  Overall, it was pretty good, although the broth was not incredibly flavorful.  It went down quite well with the Asahi Super Dry beer.

All in all, I was pretty satisfied...just what the doctor ordered.  It was mildly expensive for a quick lunch, but the service was great, and it hit the spot.  Other dishes I saw coming out looked delicious, and were huge portions.  So much so that the girls sitting next to me at the sushi-bar style counter offered to share some of their food, but I was already stuffed by then.

I would definitely go back, and probably would have rated 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed that, but they just don't quite rank a 4 star rating.  I will try them again some day, and maybe grant that extra star.",caQAXDdwHuwsL8AERXa8iQ,2,0,3,kc-5LVx4ZxuXE7H2sRK5ww
638997,2012-09-09,1,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"Go for the dim sum... Did I forget to mention the dim-sum? Yes, please try the dim sum!

I've had the pleasure of dining here three times, and I never had a bad meal. However, my last experience was more like an epiphany: I came here for dim sum.

I live in NYC and took an interest in tea houses that serve excellent dim sum, yet what I ate in NYC did not compare the dim sum served at Noodles. I was knocked clear off my feet with how scrumptious, flavorful and delightful it was. The line for dim sum was out the door (mostly asian customers who know where the good stuff is), and we waited for 45 minutes to be seated. Now we know why, it was sooooooooo worth the wait. 

First, you must try the chicken feet. This is a must for any adventurous eater, and even the meek might be converted. It was perfectly braised; the tender gelatin fell off the bones in my mouth, and the sauce was a perfect balance between salty, sweet and savory with just a kiss of chili. My husband and I polished off 4 plates of this alone. Piles of bones on our plates laid testament to our enjoyment. The manager noted how much of it we'd polished off and mentioned ""It's very unusual for Caucasians to try chicken feet."" we smiled and said we were from NYC, and then he said ""Ahhhh!"" with a big smile and nodded understanding that we weren't strangers to chicken feet (""phoenix claws""). 

Our next in the line of favorites was the pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings. This has always been a favorite of mine, and Noodles carries the crown for the best. 

Not to be missed are the almond shrimp! Perfectly fried, studded in crisp almond slivers these shrimp are a joy to eat and have a wonderful texture.

673531,2011-07-15,1,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"Went to Noodles the day after my friend got married at the Bellagio.  We had a large party (10 people) and waited for an hour and a half as other groups were seated before us.  After waiting this long, the staff finally thinks to offer to split our group.  (Really?! You just sat about 5 parties in front of ours, and from what I saw of the restaurant, you probably could not have found seating for our entire group anyway---so what took so long?)

My now shrunken group of 6 finally gets seated, and the waiter takes 15-20 minutes to come over and take our orders.  (BTW, what restaurant does not offer a side of veggies?  The only veggie offered separately on the menu was edamame, for $7!)  

When the food finally rolls out (slowly), the orders are completely wrong.  

I ordered the Beef Brisket Stew Noodles.  What I got was oxtails with noodles and bok choy.  One of my fellow dinner companions ordered the beef brisket fried rice.  She also got oxtails with fried rice.  We tried to talk to the waiter and he raised his voice to tell us that it was brisket (we simply asked what kind of meat it was) and then ran off.  We flagged down a waitress that was bringing water and asked her and she said ""london broil"".  I'm sorry, but there is no way that I am mistaking oxtails for brisket (I am from TX, I know my cuts of cow) or london broil.  (Presuming that either myself or the waitress were correct, what was in my bowl is not what I ordered.)  My friend absolutely refuses to eat her food, as she doesn't mind eating ox, but just doesn't want to eat the tail.  I nibble at my food (mom used to make oxtail stew at least once a month when I was a kid, so I'm familiar) but I am not pleased.  Brisket/ London Broil does not look like medallions of meat connected by ligaments.  The meat was tender, and there were no bones, but I was reconstructing oxtails (minus the bone) on a plate on the side by the end of the meal.

 Another one of our group ordered chicken chow mein.  Her meal did not arrive for 20-30 minutes after everyone else got their food, and only came out after we flagged the waitstaff down multiple times to ask about her meal.  

 My friend's mom ordered Soya Chicken with the chow mein noodles.  She got poached chicken (there was no way that chicken was marinated in soy sauce-- we all know what boiled chicken looks like!) and the wrong noodles.  When she asked the waiter about it, he insisted that it was soya chicken and argued with her about the noodles.  

She had also ordered combination fried rice with bbq pork and chicken, only to receive rice with beef and shrimp.  She decided not to argue or ask the waiter about it because we had so many things wrong with our table's meals and no one even tried to correct it.

Ok, so I'm not one of those ""the customer's always right"" people when I go out, but for a restaurant in the Bellagio, I expected way better service.  If you are out of brisket, tell us.  Don't lie and say it is something that it is not.  Don't argue with your customers about what they ordered when you bring what is clearly the wrong thing.  This was a horrible dining experience, and I'd never repeat it again. 

In Summary:
Overpriced. Limited Options. Rude Waitstaff.  Unwillingness to correct errors even when confronted, to the point where the servers are lying about what is on the plate.",mOifnWQ5JoE2uCzll3G4HQ,1,0,1,38AKb0PWBXyR6ExgbSFeYQ

First of all, I have never been charged for hot tea at a dim sum place. We ordered the Homemade Garlic Ginger Sauce (Deep Fried) Chilean Sea Bass, which tasted great, but was gone in like three bites since it was so tiny. AND, we paid $33 for this tiny thing.

alright, when we ask for a refund, they only refunded the mixed vegetables, at the same time expecting us to pay for the other two dishes LOL. Are you serious?!

Service was always fast, and on the friendly side.

My mom and I came here twice (we were staying at the Bellagio). On our first visit I ordered the mandarin beef noodle soup. While the beef and tendons were well-cooked and tasty, I did not like the soup as much; it was more like marinade/braising sauce than beef broth. Some may argue that this is common in beef noodle soup, but being from Taiwan (a place where beef noodle soup is extremely popular) I'm not a huge fan of this type of soup. All-in-all I still enjoyed the dish, the beef chunks and tendons were nice.

The seafood pho my mom ordered was also plain, although my mom liked it. 

On our second visit I had the Dan Dan noodles while my mother ordered the Hainanese chicken rice and a side of Shu Mai. While I'm not an expert at either of the main dishes, I quite enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles; they reminded me of tasty dry noodles with sauce that I used to have as a kid living in Taipei. I would have preferred if there was more soup; the noodles were really taking up the small bowl and sucking up most of the soup.

 The chicken rice, on the other hand was not so good. The rice itself was dry, and everything else about the dish was mediocre. The Shu Mai were dry and average-tasting as well.

Still, Noodles isn't all that bad for a quick bite of Asian food; it gets the job done.

Taking into consideration that the type of food Noodles serves is - to my knowledge - quite rare in Vegas, it might deserve a 3.5.",tltD70Hvgyqi5OqF08Fpzg,0,0,3,1dB0MhX5lURht48KOaL2OQ

After half an hour of reading Yelp reviews and deliberating over whether we wanted to pay higher than LA prices for Asian cuisine , we sucked it up and decided to give Noodles a try.  

Decor and ambience: not at all pretentious.  Moderate Asian influence, minimalist decor, and comfortable atmosphere.  Seating is away from the gaming floor so you forget you are at a casino.

Food: had the sweet and spicy noodle and Mandarin beef stew.  Flavors were good and meat was flavorful and tender.  The place is known for its wonton soup, but we were not in the mood for it this evening.  Looking around at other tables, classic dishes like the fried rices and BBQ pork looked excellent.  The menu is a fusion of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese flavors / dishes.

Service: excellent - we arrived hungry and ready to over order.  To our surprise, and in an environment where we expect to be upsold, our waiter was extremely helpful in deciding how much to order and flat said No when I wanted to get a third dish, Lol.  This was a huge service because being on vacation, I would have had no where to keep the leftovers.  All staff were courteous and very accommodating as well.

Portion size is relative.  Contrary to many of the reviews in Yelp, we found the portions to be adequate.

A quick scan of the restaurant offerings seemed to suggest that Noodles would hit the spot.

We ordered a pair of specialty cocktails, the steamed dumplings, the Szechuan Dan-Dan noodle soup and the Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodle Soup.  I had high hopes, given the decor of the restaurant and the emphasis on ""Authentic regional dishes from all over Asia"".  

Food snob warning:  I have fond memories of Dan-Dan Noodle Soup from visiting Szechuan province, and there's a restaurant near my home that does a pretty accurate version.  I also make it pretty well myself.  It's not hard.

What I was served at Noodles compares only in name - the flavor of the broth was extremely muted and there was no measurable amount of heat to the dish.  It needed chili oil, and I tried to get some Szechuan chili oil from our server so I could fix it, but no can do - she said the kitchen doesn't have it.  Which seems odd, being that Szechuan chili oil is a key ingredient in this dish.

I'd liken it to serving pho without having Sriracha and hoisin sauce to dip the meat in.  It's edible, but would be missing an expected set of flavors.

After a little prodding, our server did bring out a dish of the house chili oil, which was chopped green/red jalapenos and garlic in vegetable oil.  It helped a little, but it doesn't exactly replace the complex flavors or the numbing sensation of Szechuan peppercorns.

The wife's Spicy Thai shrimp noodle soup was similarly bland and would have benefited from some additional fish sauce and Thai chili pepper.  She wasn't very happy either, but she doesn't feel a need to go off on a tirade about it.  That's my turf.

Authentic?  Not one bit.
Palatable to the average American?  Sure.

I did get to pay more than 50 times what a bowl of Dan-Dan noodle soup costs on the streets of Chengdu, and almost twice what it costs at home. So it had that going for it at least.  ;)

These anxious people know a secret: Noodles is home to the best authentic wonton-mein soup outside of Hong Kong and Toronto.  I have been to this Chinese-American-operated restaurant approximately 12 times in the last 5 years; and, its quality has not degraded since my inauguration.  The broth of its wonton-mein is delicate (not salty) and its fresh thin egg noodle is firm with the perfect starch-egg ratio taste that melts away in your mouth.  

To complement this dish, I recommend their quarter roasted duck.  While it is on the expensive side, their tender dark meat selection is usually outstanding and beautifully cooked, leaving a nice crispy skin.  The duck comes with their bone neatly trimmed off; however, you can request for the bones should you want to extract some its flavors by dipping its caramelized seasoning into your soup as some people do.  

The other selections on Noodles' extensive menu are very good but not spectacular save for the delicious oxtail soup.  Though the dim sum here is usually excellent, especially the gorgeous Shanghai dumpling and the siu mai, there have been two occasions where these selections have failed me.  

The service here is usually quick and fast like most Chinese restaurants in New York, San Francisco Bay Area, Toronto, or LA.  The wait staff is straight-forward and no-nonsense; and, the hosts are friendly and efficient even when the line is 10 parties deep.  

As mentioned by another reviewer, I would not order any beverages here other than tea.  The sodas do not come with refills.  I personally recommend their Jasmine Pearl tea, which comes in a porcelain pot.

1200746,2013-08-29,2,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"I will not ever recommend this place to any friends.  Maybe a few enemies.

I'm not sure how anyone can rate this place higher than 3 stars.

I don't care if the place is in the Bellagio, the quality of the food and service are not at the level of the prices.

None of the food we had was any where near exceptional. 

Pho for $17 is triple of what you should pay.  There wasn't anything fantastic about it, the same bowl that I could get in a neighborhood Pho shop.  Plus we had to ask for sriracha and hoisin sauce.

The Singapore noodle dish really lacked curry flavor.  In the neighborhood restaurant I visit at home is packed with flavor and is $8 less.  Oh, I forgot I'm in the Bellagio.

Service was fair, but after our food arrived, there was almost no attention given.

Here's where the meal went really wrong.

One of the wait staff began clearing our table.  In her desire to get as many dishes off of our table as possible, she had way too many dishes in her hands.  She dropped one of the dishes on the floor and broke, with one of the pieces hitting me in the leg.  At first I thought, oh it hit me on the leg, no problem.  A few minutes later I felt liquid running down my leg, so I looked down and saw blood.

I used my napkin to wipe it off and then called the waitress that dropped the plate.  She looked at it and was going to wipe it with a towel that she was using to wipe the tables with.  I pulled my foot back and asked that she bring me a clean cloth and bandages.

She said she would tell the manager.  We waited for about 5 minutes and no manager came.

We found the manager ourselves and let her know what happened.  She said no one told her about the incident.  She had security come talk to us to make sure I didn't need paramedics. I told him I wanted to report this as an incident to make sure management had a record of it.  I never asked for anything other than to have an incident report made.

He told me that he would talk to the manager and have her adjust our bill.

What is really odd is most restaurants, when a customer is injured by the staff with blood, they will comp the entire bill.  She only took off half the amount and wasn't really apologetic.  Her attitude was more like I was an inconveniencing her and I should have moved my leg to avoid the dropping dish.

In summary, this place is way over price for mediocre food.  You can't blame the wait staff for poor service since they perform at the highest level of their manager.  And her low quality of service sets the bar really low for her team.

Oh yeah for the reviewers that said it had a great Asian ambiance, the decor reminded me of a casino cafe.  The only thing that made it seem like an Asian restaurant is the art work on the walls and the menu.

Stay away from this place!

The first time was at 12am and I was super tired but hadn't had a late night eat in a long time so was really excited about it.  Waited a few minutes for a table and got seated relatively quickly.  We have heard how great this place is, how their beef stew noodle is great, and etc.  So we ended up eating and my dad had Taiwanese beef stew and my mom had the won ton soup.  Both agreed it was good and portions were generous.  The gf had congee which was average and I had the hainan chicken rice which was disappointing.  Rice was dry, chicken just didn't look fresh, and then I thought to myself why did I order rice in a place that is named noodles?  Man I really missed out on that one.

So the next night after happy hour, we came back again.  And honestly speaking this place is probably the least expensive place you'll find in Bellagio.  We ordered noodles, fried rice, greens, roti naan bread, century egg, cucumber salad, and bbq pork/chicken.  Why did we order the chicken after seeing how it was last night?  No idea but even though it was a different kind of chicken it wasn't a winner winner.  The bbq pork was much better than the chicken and better than a lot of places in SF.  The fried rice, eh, it was okay, not great but not bad.  The roti naan bread passed, the century egg was okay (not a big fan), and the cucumber salad was too sweet.  The greens and the noodles (see?) were the winners.

After a short 10 minute wait (while checking out the exorbitant price gouging on the menu....$9 dimsum?! $18 beef noodle soup?!), we were seated. The service was quite prompt.

As a group of starving Asian girls - you do NOT keep us waiting for our food. Our entrees took quite some time to make, even though they told us everything was already pre-made. As a result, we were forced to order a variety of the aforementioned pricey dim sum. The dim sum wasn't terrible; we shared the turnip cakes, spare ribs, and two zhong zi. For the price of those few dishes we could have had a FEAST back in NYC. But I digress.

Finally the noodles come out & the portions are deceivingly big! The noodle soup bowls look small, but are actually quite deep. The dry noodle dishes are definitely large - can definitely feed 2 people and keep them full. I had the Laksa noodles; coconut broth was heavenly, but I struggled to find enough of my broad flat noodles in there =( We also ordered a side dish of steamed bok choy, oyster sauce on the side (cus we health conscious like that! ;D).

When we got to the Bellagio, there was a line for the restaurant, but menus were posted so you could read while you waited. And the person in charge of the line was very efficient at seating people.

When we got our table, two of us immediately ordered ridiculous cocktails called White Tigers that might not have technically gone with the Chinese food we ordered, but were nonetheless delightful.

One of the people in our group ordered the pad thai dish people were slagging, and we both liked it. I tell you this, friends, having eaten some pad thai in my day.

My dish was a bean curd with mushrooms and bok choy which is exactly up my alley, especially since it came with white rice that I could just ignore and so had a fighting chance of finishing my food. (The people that order noodles will need to share or take some home.) 

The bean curd (like fried tofu pieces) and shiitake mushrooms were great, and they cooked the bok choy like you're supposed to, so they're still tender-crisp instead of being overcooked into little puddles of limp green sadness.

After my cocktail I ordered coffee, which might have been The Best Cups Of Coffee I've Ever Had. I wouldn't shut up about it for the rest of the day.

To be frank, it's a place you should come each trip you're in Vegas. Their straight forward menu and service lends itself to be a clutch late night spot. Hainanese Chicken was perfectly oily, the prata was flaky and gooey, the char siu pau was superbly steamed you could take a nap on its pillow-y top, shiu mai was plump and juicy, the hot and spicy cucumbers are made in house and just right when paired with the Hong Kong noodles or Mandarin Beef Stew.

Save your money and eat elsewhere for some quality food!!!

Noodles is tucked away at the Bellagio Hotel near the high roller tables. Without someone showing it to you, you might have walked past it without knowing. We dined here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait at all. The restaurant decorations were on par with the rest of Vegas. Interesting and unique.

We ordered pan fried potstickers, pad thai, kung pao shrimp, seafood noodles and the hainanese chicken rice. When I bit into the potstickers, the meat and texture didn't taste quite right. I felt like something was missing. I think the meat wasn't as juicy as I would have hoped for. The dipping sauce that came with them was pretty bland too. I personally ordered the hainanese chicken rice and it came with a side of house rice, chicken (you had the option of bone in or out, which is nice), soup, and dipping sauces (ginger, soy sauce and chili). I was really hoping for some unique flavors for the dipping sauces. The only side that I actually liked was the soup! Pretty flavorful, but not enough to make me order it again. When I looked at the kung pao shrimp, there was at most eight shrimps for the entire dish! Not to mention that it costed $22. For that amount of money, you'd think that they would at least give you more or decent sized ones. 

Service was good though. One of the servers noticed that our food was taking awhile to deliver (even though I didn't think so) so she personally checked on it without us having to talk to her. I noticed it out of the corner of my eye. 

Overall verdict: For the price that we paid, I don't think I'll come back unless they up their game!",0UYAMbuCvSpfOc4HSTP6lA,1,1,3,42UtK0-Uv8_zX_7OcFaCBg

In any event, I got the Laksa Curry Noodle and was not at all disappointed.  It was rich, hearty, and flavorful with just the right amount of spice - like a nice warm hug of a soupy-noodle dish.

1614871,2012-04-20,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"Between 2 and 4 stars, so it averages to a 3. 

What was 2 stars?  The service, the price, and the food.  The 2 star service was mostly how we ordered a Diet Coke and a Coke and we got two Diet Cokes and how they brought out a noodle soup dish first and then the other three fried noodle dishes about 10-15 minutes later.  The price was a bit much for what you get, although it wasn't unexpected in Vegas, let alone the Bellagio.  But seriously, it's noodles.  The dish probably costs $2 to make and is usually marked up to $6 or $8 at a normal restaurant....but $15 or $20 here?  Pffffft.  That's what I have to say about that.  The 2 stars for food is for the upset stomach about 20 minutes after leaving.  

The 4 stars were for the service and the food.  The service was great because no matter how fast I drank my drink, it was rarely empty and when it was, it didn't stay empty for long.  I got the spicy dan dan noodles which turned out to be pretty tasty.  The ground pork could have been any cut and didn't have much flavor.  The spiciness was on the very low side so I had to add a lot of the chili sauce they have on the table.  I got to try some of the fried noodle dishes and they seemed pretty similar to each other.  But the flat Thai-style noodles were pretty tasty. 

Overall, this restaurant is just okay.  It's the budget Bellagio meal and it honestly doesn't feel like it belongs in the casino.  I think that was because the ingredients are cheap to begin with and the menu was mostly stocked with the standard Asian dishes you can find anywhere else in the country.  There were some interesting things, I'll admit, but for the most part I've seen it all before.  This sentiment would probably be different if they had something like chicken feet in the dim sum menu, but alas.  If you don't want to spend a lot for food, I'd suggest walking somewhere else, you'll get more bang for your buck.

As I recall, the price of the soup was approximately $20 (give or take add-ons of several dollars each).  The service was fine, and while my meal satisfied my craving for some noodles, it wasn't what I'd call a memorable noodle soup.",Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ,32,27,3,rE31MZ-vHFNpyzIdeRpdmg

My parents ordered.  We shared 4 dishes.  Soup, fried rice, veggies and duck.  My favorite was the vegetable stir fry.  I ate all of it.  The fried rice was ok.  But one thing that caught me off guard was the roast duck.  I have had Chinese roast duck for many years.  It was my grandfather favorite.  The duck was so gamey.  I didn't know what to do. To follow it with rice or drink water.   It was an ok experience.  It's is beautiful inside the restaurant but if I was there for food.  I would pass there are other places to try.

We got there around 11am. There was already a line forming by the time we got there. Noodles only seats complete parties (and in some cases nearly complete parties if its reasonable that they will be there soon, like in our case). We were a group of 9. While we waited I took a shot at the Baccarat tables and learned a few things! 

Dim sum was spot on. We had the following (ordering in multiple dishes):

- Shiu Mai, Cantonese style shrimp and pork dumplings steamed

- Pot Sticker, a Chinese staple. It tasted as good as actually being in Asia.

- Char Siu Pau, Steamed bbq pork buns, the kind that has the puffy white breading. It was great. Moist (as it should have been as it was steamed).

- Malaysian-Style Roti Prata, It is a pan fried flaky bread. Was really good and came with a better than reasonable curry sauce. Perhaps I was caught up in the moment. 

- Roasted Pork, Was awesome....the name of the dish defines itself. prepared well. not too fatty though enough to keep it authentic. 

Probably one of the few meals that didn't include alcohol...instead we had THAI ICE TEA!!!!! I found out it was on the menu and ordered one to complete the memories from Asia...and then after I got mine everyone else got one following my ""tastegasm"".

Towards the end of our meal my friend saw that legendary Poker Player Johnny Chan was eating a few tables away from us. He was apparently the Bellagio's resident poker player.

A place that serves Chinese, Thailand, Vietnamese, Singapore, and Malaysian food, and turn them into a mouthful of MSG with a little hint of regret! 
-Actually that's all you have to know about this place, but if you're curious about my experience here then continue reading:

Singapore's national dish is called Hainanese Chicken Rice, and since my girlfriend and her brother grew up there, it has become a craving to have this dish every once in a while (like how we crave for french fries every so often). Anyway we've visited several places that serve this dish all over Vegas and decided to try a more upscale restaurant on the strip instead of the cheap local places we usually go to.

Noodles is located inside the Bellagio Casino, and as soon as we got there we saw a long line outside the restaurant, which I take as a good sign since people line up just to eat here.

Now this is where everything turns into a disaster. The friendly waitress was showed us to our seats, took our order, even gave us hints on how they serve their dishes. she left and returned later with our appetizers. 

I ordered some Calamari, Chinese Sesame Balls and Roti Prata.

The Calamari was served with a sweet and chili sauce. The breading was nice and crunchy and the calamari was soft. It had a bit of curry taste and it was the only delicious thing we had that night.

Roti Prata is a Malaysian dish, it's basically a flaky flat pastry that you dip into a curry sauce, and is actually one of my favorite apps (not here though). The pastry was not flaky, it was tough and chewy. The dip had too much Turmeric and tasted powdery.

The Chinese sesame balls tasted like Chinese sesame balls.. 

Our Waitress then returned with our main dishes; The Hainanese Chicken Rice and a Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle. (note: this is the last time we would see our waitress.)

The Hainanese Chicken Rice was served with  chicken stock soup,  chicken flavored rice (which was dry and bland), the boiled chicken (of course) and accompanied by the 3 sauces: the red chilli-garlic sauce, a ginger-garlic sauce, and instead of the thick black sauce they usually serve with it, they serve it with soy sauce....... why not be creative and serve it with oyster sauce? it's thick, it's black, and the flavor makes more sense than soy sauce you lazy chefs! 

I don't even want to talk about the Mandarin Beef Stew..... The noodles were old, the soup tasted like tap water infused with MSG which made my head hurt the rest of the night and left an itch on my tongue..  The beef was tough... 

We didn't even bother for dessert..

When It was time to pay, all three servers were just talking and laughing at the host table. We felt so ignored... They didn't even fill up any of our drinks to wash the filth we just ate.

Since my friends and I fell in that category  the last time we were in Vegas, we gave Noodles a try.  Overall, the food was okay but I wasn't overly impressed by the establishment, especially in Vegas, given that Vegas is full of great food options.

Noodles offers a wide variety of dishes of various different Asian cuisines - Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese.  We tried the Hainanese chicken, beef noodle soup, chicken chow mien, Malaysian fried rice, agadashi tofu, and steamed dumplings -- yes we were very hungry.  I was most impressed with the beef noodle soup - which was surprisingly authentic and flavorful.  The chow mien was okay.  The fried rice and steamed dumplings were really good.  The agadashi tofu was flavorless.  

We also tried their Thai iced tea, which was really good. 

Service was really slow and crappy.  There was a line outside the restaurant of people waiting to be seated even though there were many empty tables.  The servers were not friendly.

This is a beef stew noodle soup and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's also good hangover food. They give plenty of beef (they better for the price) and the broth (stew) was refreshing. 

Before leaving I had the dim sum and was not impressed. They didn't have my favorite dim sum dish and the items were limited. I would not come here to get the dim sum. We left with a large bill and feeling hungry.

The dipping sauce was not too sweet and with a bit of chili paste was the perfect compliment to the deep fried veggies. 

For our entree we split two dishes: chicken Penang fried kway teow which is comprised of flat rice noodles, sprouts and chili - this was the star of the show, although in retrospect we should have gotten it with pork instead - and the Xo crab meat vermicelli which was tasty but a little flat (chili paste and soy rescued it but if it takes that much seasoning what's the point?).",slvOBlJPuycV9Mn2VS17Nw,1,0,4,UoHSLULoNP2xLFLh4uQ1Cw

Its a little hidden (off the main floor) and staffed to accommodate and pamper the high rollers.

The secret has been out for years and the place is generally packed, so plan ahead and go off hours.  A little insider secret, on busy nights you can order from Noodles from Room Service.  The food is amazing, take your pick.  A few favorites: Spicy Thai Noodle Soup, BBQ Pork, Roast Duck, Shu Mai, Satay, Pad Thai Noodle, Ox Tail Soup, you really can't miss here.

It was bland and there was barely enough to share but each of us tried a small bowl.  The noodles themselves and the wontons were fine.   I ordered a plate of fried rice and it was a sorry excuse for the real thing. Absolutely no flavor.  Nothing was greasy so I guess that was a plus and the Thai iced tea was good for a pricey $5.

If you like fatty, greasy, tasteless food, this is for you.
The experience started with the long wait. Once we were seated, the service was horrendous.  We go out to eat a lot and have a solid understanding of good service, this was awful.  Angry, frustrated staff. No smile, barely a hello. When asked for recommendations on the menu, she pointed to one section of the menu and said this is all good. 

We ordered: 
Hong Kong Noodles: Came out as crispy noodles with shrimp, fat dripping in oil, just lard, yuck.
XO Green Beans: We expected spicy green beans and these were a big disappointment due to lack of any flavor or any spices.
Noodle Soup: Name started with an L (cant remember full name) was the only semi-flavorful item. It was in coconut milk with noodles and chicken. Decent, and actually tasty. The chicken however did not look like real chicken, must be imitation.
Beef with Asparagus: Not good, not spicy, also greasy and definitely not worth $21. 
We sent the Hong Kong Noodles back, we couldn't send back everything obviously, that would be too much. They still tried to slip us the check with the noodles though and when we objected she said we'd have to talk to the manager (keep in mind, this restaurant is in BELLAGIO), after a stare down to the manager they adjusted the bill.

We live in San Francisco and are used to good quality Chinese food and excellent service. We have no qualms to pay good money for good service and good food.

Having lived in China and traveled around Asia myself, I am always up for some ""authentic"" Asian cuisine, and as Noodles boasted renowned chefs and dishes, I figured this was our best bet. 
The only thing authentic about Noodles was its customers and staff, most of whom were Asian. My husband ordered the BBQ steamed bun appetizer, which was decent though nothing to write to Asia about. He also though ahead and ordered a $2.50 cup of white rice (no brown rice on the menu), while I ordered the Chinese broccoli ""entrée."" The dish was nothing more than a few large pieces of Chinese broccoli doused in a garlic sauce. Since of course there were no knives available, I had to gnaw at the broccoli bite by bite in order to finish the plate. The broccoli had been Americanized with its heavy, sugary sauce and was so fiber-esk that it was nearly inedible. By the end of the meal I had eaten more rice with soy sauce (the latter being the most delicious part of our ""meals"") and went back to my suite $30 bucks poorer. 
Go to Noodles if: You are with a family or group and intend to eat entrees in the authentically Asian ""family style"" (as they were most likely meant to be eaten); are willing to put out a good $20 per person minimum; if you want some Japanese sake or Tsing Tao beer for $7 a bottle (it's a quarter in China!); if you are an interior design buff who gets off on elaborate and somewhat exaggerated Chinese décor (which gets a bit overwhelming fast).
Don't go to Noodles if: You want a quality meal for two under $50, you prefer to cut your food before stuffing it in your mouth and gnawing off the leftovers.",jDP4L-8nQvRUpdM7QNzO8Q,2,0,2,TAEukyAvJWmxmd-CdJV2MQ

The decor is really pretty, lots of soft ambient lighting and extensive use of wood and plant material everywhere. Our group sat at one of their bench-seat tables and the seat was really bizarre. It had a very low-rise back rest which felt weird to have only my lower back supported while dining.

This is more of a stop-by-on-a-whim place than a restaurant you'd go out of your way to eat at. It's very laid back and casual so they don't expect diners to show up in expensive suits or dressy outfits.",LxPec3cT1sNPMAQiQ0_avg,0,0,3,Vy5T3gG02brOulaJI0ivTQ

On Sunday my son and I walked around to check out the strip and walked through the Bellagio. When he read the menu, his first impulse was ""this is where we're bringing Mom to dinner.""

We came back around 8pm and had to wait in line for 50 minutes (after reading other reviews, we got off easy). We waited in line with a wonderful older Asian couple from Manitoba in town to watch the Rugby Sevens. This was there 5th time eating there over the last couple of years. Their recommendation, ""order whatever you want, there is nothing bad here.""

The food was excellent. I loved the sweet and spicy cucumber salad, and the beer was as cold as could be without icing up. The shrimp dumplings were steaming hot and the filling was a savory shrimp mixture that was fantastic.

The XO Crabmeat Vermicelli was delicate and had complex flavors. I was wanting something with more punch to it but I think this was my poor choosing not a shortcoming of the dish. The BBQ pork was so delicious, smoky, sweet and tender. My son had the BBQ pork and roast duck with jasmine rice. I will take him at his word that it was ""really great."" There was none to try after he annihilated the platter.

It is pricier than you might find elsewhere, but you are in Vegas, so it comes with the zip code. Its the Bellagio so it looks good, the food is awesome, the (mostly) Chinese staff is aloof, but I would certainly go back.",XX5iBN8AW3_rUqKgfVYMdQ,0,0,4,eMrgePdsIqkKZSSfd_i76g

The restaurant itself is very clean and nicely decorated; staff are friendly and food usually comes out pretty fast. Reasonably priced for hotel restaurant standards. Most dishes are about $18+, with decent sized portions.

Most of their appetizers are nothing to write home about with the exception of the Roti Prata (Roti bread with curry sauce), the curry has just the right amount of kick without being too sweet. The Laksa curry noodle is my favorite dish hands down (huge portion too). Perfectly cooked noodles in a rich coconut curry broth. It's a little spicy so I don't recommend this for people who like their food mild. Another recommendation is the sea bass congee. Mildly seasoned and the fish is very fresh, great choice for someone who is looking for something tasty and light. Their BBQ is surprisingly good and authentic, duck and bbq pork are the two popular choices. Though it can be a little too salty at times. Be sure to try their Mango pudding as well as fresh mango served with a side of coconut sesame rice (forgot the actual name of the dish) if you're craving for something sweet. 

Nice restaurant, friendly service and great food. There's really nothing to not like about Noodles. Only downside is they tend to get pretty busy, if you go during dinner time there's usually a wait.",YBa116q7RFrXZq6a0yVlCQ,0,1,5,WHDL7EJTST_-3RQBJX4o4g
2440338,2015-02-20,3,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"Admittedly, I came in with distended expectations. Unfortunately, Noodles left my hopes rather flaccid. 

I was expecting to pay considerably more than usual for Noodles and dim sum. Noodles is located on the Strip and in the Bellagio so that is a given. The return would be that these noodles and dim sum would be some of the best in town. I would have been quite happy with this trade off...but it didn't happen that way. For dim sum we had the shrimp & pork Shui Mai steamed pork dumplings, shrimp Har Gau dumplings, and the Spareribs with Yam Cube. The dim sum was all good, but not significantly better than what you can find in town at a fraction of the price. For noodles we went with XO Crabmeat Vermicelli...a dish that sounded amazing: lump crab, egg, bean sprouts, cabbage, XO sauce with an option for mild or spicy. The crab was ample and tasted fine, but the dish completely lacked flavor. It was one of the most bland noodle dishes I remember eating. The XO sauce was virtually non-existent and literally consisted of minimal bits of caramelized sauce...so disappointing. The dish we ordered spicy, yet was not even mild. This was the most expensive of the wok-fried noodles and as I walked out I was looking at other tables wondering if any of their dishes had any real essence of flavor ...and wishing I had ordered something other than this ""Signature"" dish. I started eating the noodles the way they were served.  1/3 of the way through I added some of their spicy chili paste that brought the dish up to a mild level, but the essence of the dish still lacked flavor. On the side of our noodles we also ordered the roast duck. The duck was fine. It had a good flavor, but was not as good as other considerably cheaper options in town. We finished the duck, now 2/3 of the way done with our lackluster noodles, when we minimally redeemed the otherwise uninspiring noodles by adding the duck sauce/drippings to the remaining portion of the noodles. It wasn't as good as a true XO sauce would have been, but it was certainly better than the dreary noodles.

In theory I'm the perfect local resident for a place like noodles. I want to pay more to get a better product. Too bad there wasn't anything to set them apart.

A tourist would do just fine to come in for over-priced dim sum since any other immediate options are equally inflated in price. I would only come back with someone that personally could recommend a specific dish they thought was incredible. Regina C. has good things to say about their Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle.  Overall I was certainly disappointed...so much so that I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars for Noodles. Some of the food was A-Ok, but in general I have experienced better at other Strip properties and even a mile away on Spring Mountain for a significantly smaller portion of the cost. Trying to take my expectations of a wonderful taste bud experience out of the equation I decided to go with 3 a generous 3 stars in the end.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,8,5,3,XvHNIKpFBeRh_193ImKdyA

Service is always better than I expect it to be, but as is standard in many Asian restaurants, you'll sometimes wait around for a long time (for more water, for your check, etc) unless you wave down a server. It's not something to complain about really, just something you have to get used to.

They serve my favorite dish in the world, Hainanese Chicken Rice, but it's not a very good version of it really. Nonetheless, it's the main course of my ""last meal"" fantasy, so I order it almost every time. I've also really enjoyed the Chicken Curry (be careful of bones, and once I got a huge chunk of ginger in my order), Malaysian Fried Rice, and every noodle dish I've ever tried. I don't recommend other stir-fried dishes or fried-meat-with-sugary-sauce dishes (e.g. sesame chicken), as they rate only slightly better than Panda Express.

Noodles is alright, and I'm going to continue going there on a regular basis, whenever it's far more convenient than popping over to Chinatown on Spring Mountain.

My shrimp dumpling soup was pretty good, with a fishiness in the broth that didn't wrankle my nose, which can be a hard feat with a diner who didn't eat much fish growing up. But you're paying a lot of money for a small bowl of noodles. The ambiance, like the rest of Vegas, covers up structural problems with a dazzling and dizzying array of exotic looking noodles in jars against the wall, almost as if a noodle crazed mad scientist had taken up residence in the restaurant. But the food was on the meager side, and expensive, evn given the quality. And we found the service to be wanting. I think they were short a waiter, but we had to call one over after waiting an unusual amount of time for someone to take a drink order. The food also took a long time, even though we arrived well after the typical dinner hour. Also, I wouldn't come here if a member of your party is a frequent visitor to bathrooms and has trouble walking. The bathrooms are on the other side of the casinos (of course), so you'll be trekking through slot machines and hordes of well dressed career professionals to get to the facilities. Unfortunately, while Vegas may have good food here and there, often there isn't a lot of choice once you're anchored in a casino. Each one has their pride and joy restaurants. For what it's worth, I'd either skip the noodle section of the menu here and hope for something better in, say, the Mappo dofu, or try the Cantonese restraurant across the way which may or may not be a better choice.",832YyHP2Vjcteb9009Uw6w,0,0,2,dyIdVzOsR7lV_hUDKjEGiw

But lo and behold, among the five-dollar-sign eateries in the elaborate casino is a semi-reasonably priced noodle house. By no means is this in the same class as Picasso or Le Cirque. It's a place for the rest of us, the ones who forked over a hundred bucks to see Cher across the street at Caesar's Palace and didn't want to sink the rest of our savings on a meal we were too tired to enjoy anyway.

This being Vegas, it's a lot nicer and contemporary than your standard noodle joint. It has rows of jars filled with all sorts of dried noodles set against a lighted wall - lest you make a mistake that this is not a noodle joint. We were served right away at about 9:30 on a Saturday evening, and the waiter was super-attentive. Jamie and I shared an $8 basket of five Shui Mai...pretty good and in need of the mustard sauce to spice them up (see my photo). Jamie went for the $18 plate of Spicy and Sweet Noodles with Chicken - which impressed us with the heft of the poultry pieces (see my photo).

But on my own, I decided to try their Congee Chicken - a smallish bowl with iddy-biddy chicken bits and scallions (see my photo). Not the best jook I ever had but it was nice balm for my then-sore throat. I thought the price was high at $13 - but it did hit the spot at a time when I least expected to have some comfort porridge. We got out of there for a little over fifty bucks, which does seem ridiculous, but hey, this is Vegas. I should be happy I got away with my shirt intact.

FOOD - 4 stars...jook in the land of over-plenty? who da thunk it?

* Meals: food coming out very fast. Noodles are tasty and authentic. Desert options are pretty good. 4 star.

We were hesitated at first after reading some reviews on yelp but one of Taiwanese friend recoomended this place... Also we were looking for some low key and casual place to grab a dinner. It is actually not bad!

There was no wait. The service is OK. The food comes out is super fast. My friend went to bathroom to wash hand before dinner and his food got to the table before he came back!
We had sweet and spicy cucumbers, seafood udon, thai seafood noodles, chilled coconut and mango pudding for desert, and thai ice tea. The meal cost about $85 minus tip! It is not bad for the location!

- Sweet and spicy cucumber $7: not pretty to the eyes but really tasty and fresh.
- seafood udon $18: good portion, very light broth with plenty and quality sea food.
- Thai seafood noodle $18: spicy and tasty tom yum broth, perfectly cooked vermicelli, shitake mushrooms and half a dozen large prawns! Very yummy!
- chilled coconut $10: very fresh young coconut with shred jelly. It was very fun idea and light desert without worry about calories.
- mango pudding $10: served with fresh milk, very creamy, light but strong mango taste.

I noticed there was cooked tobiko caviar on top.  yum.  the crab noodles were okay.  they used rice noodles with a lot of pieces of crabs.  a little bland but we put soy sauce on it.  the food was pretty good.

For our pot of tea, an orange juice, 1 appetizer, and 1 noodle, our total was $44 without tip.  I thought it was a little over priced considering the quality and how much food we got.  The type of asian food they had were thai, vietnamese, japanese, and korean.  some of the items were ridiculously priced.  for example, vietnamese rice porridge was $13 when normally it would be only $5.

I won't lie, my mom tells me the same thing.  Anyhow, with that state of mind; he started his search for a place to eat, which he had never tried.  Alas, Yelp led him to a place called Noodles in the Bellagio.  Looking for a place to eat noodles... what better place to go than a restaurant called Noodles!?  Blah!!!!!

Pros:  
  * Very Beautiful Atmosphere
  * located inside Bellagio (fancy schmancy)
  * spacious seating w/ large family style tables
  * diverse selection of noodles from pho to singapore noodles
  * large portions
  *  The sauce that came w/ the calamari had a nice kick to it.
  * Hor Fun was Yum Yum.
Cons:
  * I haven't been to Bellagio on a Saturday in awhile, but let me tell you... Parking sucks!  No exaggeration, I was looking for parking for 45 minutes.
  *  Way over-priced, but this was expected for a fancy restaurant.
  *  The quality of the food sucked.  I'll talk more about that later
  *  The wait to get in the restaurant was almost an hour.
  *  After getting seated, it took the server 25 minutes before saying hi
  *  Took nearly 10 minutes for water
  *  Server forgot to bring my friends soda (she had to ask 2 times)
  *  My tea took another 10 minutes to bring

Ordered:
  Calamari - I'm a big fan of calamari, but this was chewy in a bad way.
  Hot Tea - nearly $9, but it does serve 4 so it's not too bad
  Singapore Noodles - definitely not what i expected, big portion though
  Ice Water- if you want water, get it w/ lemon to mask that ""tap"" taste
  Total cost:  nearly $40.00 !

Verdict:
  *  I wouldn't recommend this place.  I have no intention of coming back.  I do love that the portions were heaping, but I didn't really enjoy it much (at least not the Singapore Noodles).  My best friend ordered the Duck.  It was crispy on the outside, but the meat itself was a bit dry.  My friend's girlfriend ordered the Hor Fun.  This was pretty good.  If I had to come again, I'd definitely would order this.  I expected it to cost me what it did, but for that price, I was disappointed with the quality of the food (maybe I just didn't order the right stuff.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt) and definitely was not satisfied with the service.  Eek!  Me thinks not !

Tips:
  * go to Chinatown off Spring Mountain... there's plenty of selection for a quarter of the price.
  * you know how some place have water that has that weird taste, yea... Noodles has that type of water so get a hot tea or soda.
  *  Hor Fun was Fun indeed.  It's a safe bet for your Noodle virgins",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,3,1,xrDvEGHpmtE6Wg4eIR-NPQ

3014436,2010-05-13,1,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"I was sorely disappointed at the lack of flavor and service at this restaurant, being that it is in the Bellagio.  Despite being a casual dining place, the prices were fairly high, but typical for something in this hotel.  To be honest, I get much better Chinese food off the strip and felt robbed of my money when paying the check, but I'll explain that in a bit.

First, we were in the Bellagio for something to eat, since I wanted Jean Philippe's afterward.  We walked toward the buffet and I was adamant on trying this restaurant because of the lovely decor and simple menu.  We were seated immediately at the back corner of the restaurant against the wall.  The part that irritated me was this grass skirt hanging decor that hung over our soy sauce and touched the table and I.  To top it off, it was extremely dusty and dust particles were falling slowly, like snow, onto the table.  I was shocked to see filthy decor on the wall.  Still, we ordered our food and we had to stick it out.

The shumai and chicken satay appetizers came out first.  Both were okay but nothing to rave about.  Although it was packed with flavor, the shumai reminded me of mushy microwavable shumai from the grocery store.  I wasn't impressed at all.  As for the chicken satay, it was dry and the sauce wasn't flavorful for my taste.  It simply fell short.

My husband wanted the main courses to be outstanding, as did I, but alas--they were sad plates of Chinese food.  We ordered a chicken chow mein, soya chicken (skin on) and bbq pork fried rice.  All of it was blase.  I wasn't impressed with the flavors, textures, or presentation.  The fried rice was extremely dry and was fluffy, almost as if they used Uncle Ben's rice instead of regular rice to make the dish.  The chow mein was okay, but it was overpowered by salt for some reason.  As for the soya chicken, it was moist and tasted good enough to chew and swallow.

After an 83 dollar check for what we ordered, I was upset at this place for charging those prices for meager Chinese food.  The service was prompt on drinks, but that was it.  Our server was also very pushy.  After ordering our first entree he was ready to leave.  

After all that I wanted to stop at Beijing Noodle at Caesar's to get shumai and noodles, and then HK and Food Express for other chinese dishes to make me feel better about Chinese food.  It was sad, sad eats at this restaurant.  I hate being depressed over food so expensive.  I will never eat at this place again, although the food was edible.  It lacks luster and authenticity despite the 100's of asians working the kitchen and the floor.  Either someone dumbed down their taste or they believe dumbing down Chinese food appeals to the masses.  Either way, someone did something very wrong at this place, and it will kill them in the long run.

Steer clear of Noodles.  I'm thankful it's in a corner that most people don't walk by because it doesn't deserve an audience.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,1,2,jYm20fRQiarZWrrdwgprgw

It took a while to be seated but it was worth the wait. My boyfriend, friend and I got some dimsum. We didnt get to try as much as we would have liked and it was almost over, but what we did get to try was fantastic!! Way better than expected.

The food was okay. We ordered veggie spring rolls which were good but i've had better. We also got the mongolian beef and some chicken friend rice. All yummy but by no means the best.

If you are looking for dim sum on a sunday i highly recommend this place but if you are looking for some tasty chinese food you would probably have better luck at Chonois in Caesars.",24SDHbBnqK4qHRHUuNPBww,0,0,4,gGh1JIDg6cuuJxQHam_i_A

Craving food so late at night/early in the morning, I passed by Noodles and seeing that the line was so short, decided to wait it out.  Let me just say that the length of the line is deceiving.  Even though there was only 3 parties in front of me, I was in line for almost two hours...

I ordered the beef noodle soup and shui mai, and my friend ordered the BBQ pork rice. Because of the high prices I was expecting my food to be beautiful , but was not impressed with the plating at all.

The part that sucks the most is that the food was just mediocre.  It tasted just like any beef noodle soup I could get for 5 bucks in chinatown.  It's actually pretty likely that it was below mediocre, because food tastes better when I'm hungry and having skipped lunch and dinner I was starving.  The beef was so tough, perhaps they should of provided me a hammer along with my chopsticks to help me break down the meat.   

Another thing I'm going to add is that the water tasted so bad, it seems ridiculous that I'm complaining about the taste of water but my friend agreed that it left a strange unsettling aftertaste.   I was actually kinda pissed off because after looking at my glass I found that it was dirty.

 My review even based on the first time still remains unchanged. Let me start with a few good points if you find yourself in a late night Chinese food craving. This place has a good turn over (they need it cause it's tiny). Once seated after an initial wait the food comes very quickly and it's open late. One reason we stop here on a Sunday night.

Now the major fault of Noodles is two things price and attention to detail. And these two work in conjunction. For a $20 dollar bowl of pho there should be a very high end sense of quality. Expectation of the what they served is hardly any different from any Chinese Asian restaurant for way less. 

Service aside which is better than most Chinese restaurant but still can stand major improvement is there attention to their own food. Normally when you  serve Thai food you ask how spicy the customer enjoys it. I ordered a spicy Thai shrimp noodle and received something so spicy it was almost inedible. If I have been aware I would have avoided the heartburn but that was my mistake no thanks to the person taking our order. 

Venom aside this is a traditional Cantonese restaurant serving very basic Asian classics. If you don't mind the high prices and enjoy average wonton soup,fried rice ,pad Thai, congee, and dim sum yes you found it on the strip no doubt. 
Alternative is to find the china town in Vegas.

Easy choice was the chicken satay with an amazing peanut dipping sauce. Also sampled the shrimp tempura. So perfectly fried and tender beyond imagination. But the barometer of a noodle house is of course noodles in broth. I added the BBQ pork with egg noodles and the scrumptious bowl wafted out  the smell of the deliciousness to come. A perfectly cooked noodle with a fantastic broth were what i came for and received. I told my wife i could eat all my meals here this week. It was that good.

first, the service is horrendous.  even for a chinese restaurant, this place is up there with the worst of them.  second, the food is terrible.  pretty much anything you order will be subpar.  a bunch of my friends and myself have gotten sick eating the seafood here.  the last time i came, i ordered a bowl of pho which did not taste like pho.  it was overcooked, soggy noodles in water + msg and some shrimp.  pretty awful.

My good Caucasian friend wanted to show off his favorite place. Thanks J. He had a few favorite items not found elsewhere. He loved the baked BBQ buns with sweet crust and almond fried shrimp ball especially.

It's located in Bellagio. So it was crowded with Asian tourists. The staffs spoke Cantonese. The service was great. One of the best service in USA... just a bit shy of those 4-star restaurants in Hong Kong.

I know exactly what to expect before I came here with my friend. So I can't really trash the foods here. So this was just my observation.

The foods were pricey. I didn't try the regular menu. It started from $14.95 and up. The appetizer was $7.95 and up. Side orders like preserved duck egg, starting at $3 each. My take? They are all 2-3 times the price of regular restaurants in Las Vegas. You can read my ""tasty"" reviews on other Las Vegas restaurants too.

So, here's the breakdown:
Service: 4 (they were all eager to help, from push cart servers to our server Denny; very efficient and friendly)
Pu-er tea with chrysanthemum: 3 (good, $2 each person)
Siu Mai: 2.5 (not the best cut of meat here... too chewy with fatty meat; or not minced with the right cut of meat)
BBQ bun: 3 (2 per plate; small size; it's BBQ pork pun, my friend had to order 2 plates to satisfy)
Shanghai Dumpling: 0.5 (3 little one on tiny aluminum shell; $6.95 for 3; minimal juice inside; I could tell it tasted like Shanghai dumpling).
Chicken feet: 3 (Well done, easy to suck off the bone; a bit too sweet... my friend commented that they didn't have to alter the ""taste"" because most Caucasians won't even look at it; server brought it to me from the kitchen and not on the cart).
Egg tart: 3.5 (crispy shell)

The food here is pretty authentic, but super overpriced, with small portions. There is almost always a short wait to be seated, but they take your order pretty quickly once you're at a table. I've been here a few times, but this is the first time I'm finally writing a review. I've tried:

-Cantonese Dumpling Noodle (Shrimp Dumplings w/Bamboo Shoots, Mushrooms, in Rich Broth, $15.50): Definitely not worth the price since this is typically a bland dish. The dumplings are good but you only get like, three.
-Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle (Beef Brisket, Tendons-Spiced Herb Broth, $18.75): Really flavorful actually, and they give you a generous amount of beef stew. You can also request for no tendons if you prefer.
-Laksa Curry Noodle (Chicken, Fish Cake, Bean Sprouts, Dried Shrimp Paste, Egg, in Rich Coconut Curry Broth, $17): Yum- this is one of our go to dishes. The broth is super flavorful, with the perfect amount of coconut milk in it, and the noodles and other ingredients work very well together. It has a decent amount of spice, so don't get this if you hate spicy food. Otherwise, a must order!
-XO Crabmeat Vermicelli (Lump Crab, Egg, Bean Sprouts, Cabbage, XO Sauce, $23.75): Despite the hefty price tag, they do give you a decent amount of crab, and this dish is actually pretty big although it doesn't look that way when it first comes out. It was good, but not so great I would order it again for the price.
-Scallop Dumpling & Almond Shrimp Dumpling  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noodles-las-vegas-2?select=kcv1w_k60jxA_5EsAJX1Mg#kcv1w_k60jxA_5EsAJX1Mg): Both were not very good. The scallop was on the gross side since there was barely any scallop and instead a lot of fillers like water chestnut. The Almond Shrimp was bland, but at least there was a good amount of shrimp. I wouldn't order either again though.

I've tried a couple of their other dim sum items like Har Gow and Shiu Mai, and they were good, but if you really want dim sum, you might as well take a cab to the Chinatown area and get a full dim sum meal there. The cost will probably work out to be the same, or cheaper depending on how big your group is. Although the food here is pretty good, the prices are so expensive it makes me cringe as a cheap Asian person!

The staff are always so nice and the service is great. Many of the staff members are immigrants and it is really special getting to know them and their stories throughout our visits. We make sure to visit multiple times during our trip because in my opinion, one time isn't enough.

We order the spring rolls and tempura veggies as appetizers and then individual bowls of chicken or wonton soup with egg noodle. We also enjoy a few pots of Jasmine tea during our meal.

For dessert you MUST try the mango sticky rice. It is simple but so delicious! During our most recent visit they ran out of mangos for the evening, but our waiter Kenny saw how disappointed we were and literally went to the cafe in Bellagio to grab another mango for us. What a rockstar!

To address the reviews saying that the menu is expensive, it definitely isn't cheap, but it also isn't over-priced. All of these restaurants are pricey and atleast you get quality food and excellent service here!

Although the food here isn't amazing, it's pretty good. You'll find a lot of food here that you won't anywhere else in Vegas. This place is pretty much run by Asian people, so a lot of the diners here are actually Asian people as well. Waitresses usually speak both Mandarin and Cantonese, and of course English. So even if you come with your non-English speaking parents, you won't get into a mess with ordering. Asians have a hard time adapting to fancy food, so this place is very comfortable to eat at. The price is bit high, but it's Vegas. If you're complaining about the prices, why are you in Vegas in the first place? Walk down the street to a McDonald's or something. Most of the dishes here are pretty authentic tasting, though some do have a modern or 'American' touch to them. Don't expect their iced teas to taste like the Asian cafe type! They're still the unsweetened American restaurant version. The decor is pretty cool. Just lit up walls with shelves of different types of dry noodles in glass jars. Also very clean! Waits are usually no more than 30 minutes from my experiences, though sometimes I see some pretty long lines.

Overview:
Great Asian food, especially for Vegas.
Modern decor. Nice utensils and plating. Well-lit restaurant. Very clean!

3497438,2009-12-17,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"I was in Las Vegas for the Pacqiao vs. Cotto fight and happened to meet my friends for breakfast at this place.

According to the name of the place and what I have seen online, this place is supposed to be a ""noodle house."" Now, I didn't get around to any noodles because it was breakfast time... so being half Chinese myself, I ordered Chinese breakfast... aka Dim Sum.

As far as Dim Sum goes, they had everything I could have wanted:
   - Pork Siu Mai
   - Shrimp Siu Mai
   - Har Gow
   - Sio Pao
   - Chicken Feet (gross to Americans, delicacy for Asians)

Everything was nicely prepared and tasted excellent... especially the Chicken Feet. I guess my only complaint would be that it is a little pricey (due to the number of people in our group) and that the Dim Sum was a little small in size.

There is however a sweet consolation---264 miles away from my area,there is Noodles. Surprisingly, I would find my favorite chinese food place inside a vegas hotel. But it's true, the exceptional taste of the food here brought back memories of my Hong Kong love affair with congee, dimsum, peking duck and noodles. Unlike other places I tried, their roasted duck is tasty yet not as greasy (you can even order it de-boned which makes for an even more enjoyable pigout). Their dimsum is topnotch. Basic selections like har gao, siu maai, bau and ma chang taste exceptional. My most favorite of all though is their seafood congee. Not a lot of chinese restarants serve this well, if at all, but in Noodles, they have it great. It has savory stuff like squid, scallops, mushroom, bokchoy, fish fillets in a tasty base (not watered down or too textured).I do wish they'd expand the dismsum menu and serve woo kok (mashed taro with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp, pork), and bring back the seasoned jellyfish. Other than that, I have no complaints. If you do love chinese food, and you know chinese food by heart, this place won't disappoint. And for those of you who prefer other asian cuisine, like korean, japanese, vietnamese or thai, Noodles also has tasty selections to satisfy your cravings (eg. pad thai, pho, kimchi, udon, and other favorites). Not the cheapest place, but definitely worth it. Did I mention the ambiance? It's a casual, comfortable place with minimalist beautiful decor by Tony Chi.

We ordered the traditional Chinese beef noodle soup and jook with century egg and pork.  They were extremely generous with the meat in both dishes. The beef noodle soup had a gigantic piece of tendon/cartilage (AWESOME!!) along with other pieces of beef. It was obvious that they had been stewing for a long time since the meat was very tender and soft, and fell apart each bite. The soup was what I considered to be quite precise with traditional taste, but definitely milder in spiciness, which makes sense since they also need to appeal to non-Asian customers. The jook was good and tasted close to what I am accustomed to. They were super generous with the century egg (!), though slightly less so with the pork.

Prices were a bit high, but that is expected. The service was top-notch and super friendly! The food we had was most definitely better in taste and texture than Noodle Asia in the Venetian. We were very happy to have discovered this place!",7KsXJ8MvU9VIG78W10s0SQ,0,0,4,bWJGpklHBc7RIqv3avrvsg

I always order the same thing but it's a good combination and I can't seem to stray from it.  Edamame is nothing special, but at $7.50 it's probably one of the most expensive edamames out there.  Spicy Cucumber is really really good too.  It's more like a Korean kimchee style and I don't get how they get the cucumber so consistantly  crunchy, sweet, and spicy but again, it's expensive..  I think it was about $7 or $8 for a SIDE DISH..  

My favorite all-time dish here is the braised beef & tendon soup with egg noodles.  The meat is cook well and is very tender, the egg noodles are thin and delicate, a really good combination, but the broth is a little too soy saucey.

I was extremely hungry on the casino floor and there wasn't much open, but I remembered my friend telling me that Noodles was pretty good. I came a few hours ago but the wait was 45 minutes. Around 12am, I probably only waited around 20 minutes.
Once we sat down, the server came relatively quickly to take our order and our food came soon after. We ordered the kimchi, hot and spicy cucumber, roast duck and roast pork, bokchoy in garlic sauce, and 2 congee with century egg and pork.

A lot of reviews say the service is horrible but all the times I have been here with the BF they have been nothing but nice to us.

Lobstah (with salt & pepper, chilis, garlic, and onions). (4 stars)

LOBSTAH was deep fried and quite tasty although it was just a bit salty for me. Good size portion although it is market price. I think the next time I'll just try a different version.

Shrimp dumplings. (4 stars)

This was my favorite so much so I ordered it twice! The shrimps are steamed perfectly and not mushy like a lot of other places.

The wrapper was steamed perfectly and not sticky.

XO Crabmeat Vermicelli. (4 stars)

If you love crab this is a very tasty dish. You definitely see the crab is the star!!

The vermicelli was a lighter version of noodles which helped due to the fact that we order a lot just to try a variety.

I would order this again! Especially since this is a Noodles original!!

Kung Pao Shrimp. (3 stars)

I want it to be spicy!! This unfortunately was not.

The shrimps were pretty big but it was more like a sweet and sour shrimp to me. The BF liked it.

Pork and Vegetable Dumplings. (2 stars)

My least favorite and I am a dumpling lover!!

The inside was just like a mushed up unidentifiable meat with no sign of veggies. Very disappointing.

I would not order this again.

Noodles In-House Special Spicy Sauce. (5 stars)

This sauce is awesome and it definitely has a kick to it!! 

It's probably around the heat level of a Serrano pepper. I love habañeros so I wish it were spicier but nonetheless I loved it!!

All in all, Noodles is a good place to get seafood.

The place was busy as most places were the weekend of the Pacquiao fight. We both ordered the beef brisket noodle soup and an order of shrimp dumplings. My friend who enjoyed most of the dumplings said they were ok but nothing to rave over. We both agreed the broth of the soup was too rich. Even with the addition of salt, pepper, and hot sauce we couldn't cut the richness of the soup.  I hoped that the noodles would save the dish but they were bland and flavorless. They seemed to be overcooked as it didn't compliment the broth at all.  The brisket came in really large pieces that were too tough for a soup so they had to be broken up by fork and knife.

She returned to the table after asking her ""what happened""......& Shelly said they had sold 10-12 of these dishes without complaint throughout dinner service......there's nothing they could do to help us!

It wasn't like we were asking for the whole dinner to be comp'd but to put something out there that you couldn't eat at such a nice resort was so egregious.  

The quality of food and service (if I could) would be a -5 Star; to hotel management, you should take a look at their personnel and management because (well).....they make Bellagio look bad!",qn8IYeNRvz0e2b45Xir4eA,0,0,1,lepdRyJXABY87rvV4yiDNA

First, they do not take reservations. I called the # listed on the Yelp listing which took me to Bellagio reservations. They then transferred me to Noodles and they said just come by (even though I called to make a reservation bc we had a party of 5 and didn't want to stand in line too long). We get to Noodles and maybe there was an influx of people who suddenly craved the hodgepodge of Asian selections, but there was a long line. Sad face. Understandable thought because they tried to move the line as fast as they could.

Unfortunately the service was mediocre and somewhat rude. We did not get water or tea until close to 15 minutes AFTER the server took our order. We then had to ask for the condiments that usually accompany our dishes (sriracha and hoisin for the pho and red vinegar for the wonton noodle soup). 

I can't speak for the other dishes but my wonton noodle soup was overcooked and flavorless. 

Also, I understand this is a casino food outlet but I would have expected better service and a little more than tasteless soup.",HOX9cwFv6JLAc3ox5ejJ6A,4,3,2,rfgaHGD9DHAxUznD1kv9kw
3920983,2016-01-25,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"My first Vegas review! I have to admit that it's difficult to rate your dining experience in a casino. The hustle and bustle and eclectic crowd mix can vary widely and greatly affect the meal and ambiance. Very little went into the research and selection of this quick lunch grab, however the place offered some warm tea and hot dumpling noodle soup; as such, I was in!

The food was probably a 4 or 5 on its own merit. Had a very authentic feel and flavor. Really good noodles and dumplings! The menu seemed to have a South East Asian influence and that suits my tastes well. Also their tea was unexpectedly delicious, unfortunately I didn't ask about it's specifics (apologies!); definitely have some if you partake in a meal here. 

The setting was very bright and felt well suited for a business meal, which was fine for me as I'm in town on business; however it does give a bit of an impersonal vibe and the proximity of tables around you only compounds that. The service is succinct but rushed due, I suspect, to the volume of business running through the casino. 

Overall solid 3 stars, ideally I'd like to come back to solidify my evaluation but unlikely to be able to return on this trip. Go for the food, but don't plan to having your signature meal in Vegas here; there are likely more fantastical experiences to be had around the city.",I-KCduI3V7ODyNiUWgqygg,0,0,3,TsT6xNrT1eBjgaSFq-tTAg

The dishes were mediocre tasting and somewhat expensive - oh well, it's Vegas right?  Little did I know that as we stepped out and began walking to Planet Hollywood, I would start to feel a little uneasy in the stomach.  I quickly looked for a restroom and dashed in as I set my eyes on one (I will leave the rest to your imagination- what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas... hehe).

Started by ordering a Thai Iced Tea. I asked our server if they could substitute the regular milk for soy milk. She told me no... Something about the tea having lots of sugar, plus the sugar in the soy milk... Just too much sugar. Um, what? That doesn't make any sense. It's easy to sub soy in any milk-based drink. I do it all the time. If the drink was pre-mixed with regular milk already, then I can understand. But you're telling me no bc you think I think it'll taste too sugary with soy? Soy doesn't typically have lots of sugar. It's a fine substitute. What if I like lots of sugar, anyhow? I don't. But the point is... It's my drink, personalized to my tastes, and the server doesn't know me... So let me order it how I want to. 

After losing that battle, we ordered our food. My dad got the Noodle Soup with Chicken and again, we got another wonderful recommendation from our server: ""That's not my favorite. It's too light and not very good."" Thanks? We know she meant well, but there may have been a bit of a language barrier (it sounded like she didn't know English very well.) Her recommendations were probably helpful in her eyes, but to us, they sounded discourteous. Luckily my family and I are laid back and we just laughed it off. 

Food: Dad got the Noodle Soup, as requested, and it was actually pretty good. A little bland, but not bad. Same for the Wonton Soup and the Cantonese Dumpling Soup. The fried rice was basic. Don't bother. On the better side... the Shiu Mai and the Sesame Balls.

We both ordered drinks too. I got the White Tiger martini and my bf got the Zombie drink. Now if you order this drink and the server advises ""this is a big drink, is that ok"", she/he doesn't mean its just bigger than say a martini. She/he means that you could probably share it with another person, and it comes in a bowl with a flame in the middle. Craziness.

The bill was just under 115 with tip. On the expensive side for what we got, but we knew that going in. Its defintely not a must eat place for me, but I might go back to try another noodle dish sometime.",vS1hVEpZSv6_D-PtFExA_A,0,0,2,EFbT74Ced6Xila1wX9Cv-g

We all ordered their Roast Duck rice and Chinese broccoli ($16.75) which definitely hits the spot. The rice is service piping hot, and the duck was pretty flavorful, albeit a bit fatty as expected. Portions are average in size, more of a personal-size which may or may not fill you up if you're hangry.

Service is quick, as we were seated quickly and our food also came out quickly. Any special requests will most likely not be honored, so don't set your expectations too high.

Overall everything here is pretty average, but not bad per se. It's hard to stomach the prices, as I've enjoyed delicious beef stew noodles in LA for 1/3 of the price as the beef stew noodles on their menu ($18.95 R U SRS BRAH?!).",Ta0ki1Fi2fcDpOjiQcR1Qw,5,2,3,hH7gYbWweo4iie7a9B3nRg

My group was comprised of three couples. Couple one ordered some white chicken and broccoli noodle dish that they really liked. Boyfriend and I/the 2nd couple got potstickers, miso, and pad Thai off the Pre-Fixe menu. All tasty! I loved the miso flavor--the saltiness was perfect. The postickers were okay, I'm not sure if they were sausage or what but the meat was kinda pink. Pad Thai was great--they used wide noodles in this dish, so that was a change but one I liked.

We had the wonton noodle soup, the broth is a clear consume pretty flavorless so I doused mine with some chili sauce. The shrimp wontons were nicely seasoned with salt and seasame oil. But for a 16 medium size bowl of soup- I expected way more

We ordered the following dishes since we are originally Singaporean:

- Laksa - Delicious and very close to the authentic Singapore Laksa Lemak!  That coconut broth reminds me of home right away!
- Hainanese Chicken Rice - So-so.  I've had better.  The chicken has the correct Hainanese taste and so does the rice but I think the chicken could be more moist.  Also, the chili sauce that comes with the platter is not the correct Hainanese chili.  The ginger sauce is ok.

As for the dinner, the Hong Kong style noodles were soaking in sauce that had a weird flavor. The noodles were really thin for egg noodles. If they were thicker, I think it wouldn't have absorbed all the sauce. The duck was excellent, boneless and full of flavor.

Staying at the Bellagio for a conference, didn't rent a car, it was already 3:30pm and I hadn't had lunch yet. So my options were pretty limited. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this adorable restaurant. All of the waiters and waitresses are Asian. I don't know why I was so surprised. Being that it is in the Bellagio I think I expected this place to be not very authentic. 

The menu has food from every Asian country I could think of! Is this place Chinese food? Vietnamese food? Thai food? All of the above???

Lulu, my waitress was lovely and very attentive. Since they keep these casinos below freezing in the summer I opted for a hot tea, egg noodle soup with BBQ pork and a side of siu mai. The food came out fast, lucky me bc I was starving by then! The noodles had great texture and the broth was very tasty. The BBQ pork also had great flavor, although it was cut a bit thicker than I'm used to with my regular OC restaurants. I had a little difficulty biting it into smaller pieces. No biggie. The siu mai was very yummy as well (pretty standard). The check came out to $32. This is actually a very nice looking restaurant inside the Bellagio, so the price is to be expected. 

Maybe bc I was starving. Maybe bc I already had low expectations due to previous reviews. Maybe bc my palate isn't very sophisticated when it comes to Asian dishes. But in my humble opinion I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Noodles. Lulu was so sweet it just made my experience that much better. 

Unrelated side note, the couple next to me (I will not disclose their ethnicity, but you can figure it out) order fried calamari and asked for cocktail sauce.

The dim sum itself was good. Not as good as Lucky Dragon was and double the price with less of a variety.  The vegetable dumplings were really good and the stuffed mushrooms.

The roast duck was very good. Flavorful and tender and bonus points for taking it off the bone.

That was the only item we ordered off the menu.  We wanted to try the spicy cucumbers and a soup but after the experience we had trying to be seated we decided against it.  Of we ever come back maybe we will try that and skip the dim sum",ldSocJvfHDBX5491WNcjVg,0,0,3,pPWz7l86OIncIJsr79RRww

They don't use msg (or so I am told) and the food is not greasy at all!

$18 for a noodle soup?  Only in Vegas!  Go off the Strip and go to China Town and get the exact same thing (probably better) and more for your money - guaranteed.

CONS:
- everything I tried was nasty! 
- even the presentation of the food was ugly ESPECIALLY for a place that is $$ 
- the food is made for people who don't like flavor OR who don't know what the food is SUPPOSED to taste like. My bf ordered the shrimp won ton soup and it literally tasted like water. I ordered the roti which usually gets me excited because not a lot of places serve it but the curry it came with was NASTY & trust I've had Malaysian curry before. My cousin ordered the chicken curry rice dish and even that was nasty. I ordered the coconut curry noodle soup that I've ordered at other places before and again NASTY! I recommend asking for the shrimp paste on the side, just the smell of it ruined it for me. They put way too much of it in my soup it didn't even taste like curry anymore. The pad thai was made with the wide rice noodles and NO flavor. The sesame chicken (I think) reminded me of when my dad tried to make my sister & I sweet and sour chicken with ketchup from some cookbook he had YEARS ago! 
- this spot is a perfect example of why Asian fusions are BAD! 
- the service was HORRIBLE it took forever to get our food, forever to get the check, forever to get our money/cards back... & everything else UGH!

During the weekend lunch, while they're pushing carts, the dim sum rates aren't bad at all.  They're actually quite reasonable.  However, if you opt to get dim sum as appetizers in an ""off peak"" time then it will cost 2 to 3 times as much. My fiancé and I ordered dim sum, as appetizers, during dinner and paid ~$8 per order.

We ordered shrimp dumplings as appetizer which were really yummy but hard to get off the sticky paper in the bamboo steam box. I ordered the lump crab vermicelli and HIGHLY recommend it. It woudl be most comparable to Carbonara on an Italian menu. The flavor was light and without a doubt THE best meal I had the whole time I was in Las Vegas! I will certainly come back when I am back at this resort casino next time. 

One note that it was a bit hard to hear the wait staff as the place was very busy shortly after we arrived and my husband ordered a plate with shrimp and got chicken. He was happy with it though so I will say we have no complaints. It was also very reasonably priced. If I had to say something- I wuold suggest descriptions on the menu so people know what they are ordering. That was the hard part- we didnt order anything we didnt recognize by title but were pleased with the food choices.

Take Cindy, for example, who took care of our party of 9.  For some reason, I think she didn't like me because I wanted warm water.

OK, I get the fucking point.  You have tea and you're trying to charge me for it, but I don't fucking want it.

Whilst taking my order, Cindy didn't understand when I pointed to what I wanted and specified ""chicken.""  Because instead, she tells me i can choose from bbq pork, duck, or chicken.  I said, yeah that chicken.  

OK, that wasn't even the worse part.

When she brought back everyone's dishes, my order was missing.  However, she had a two bbq item rice plate in her hand.  I realized the person next to me had switched her order at the last minute, and Cindy the server must have accidentally switched my order.  

Cindy hands me the rice plate and says ""Here you go.""  I told her, ""I didn't order this.  You must have accidentally switched my order out instead of the person next to me.""  Cindy responds with, ""You don't want this?""  I said, ""NO, I didn't order this.  I ordered the poached chicken rice noodle.""  Cindy says ""Oh."" and runs off.

It's not cheap - I think my bowl of Vietnamese Seafood Pho was about $18 - but it was soothing, aromatic (lots of cilantro, just the way I like it), and delicious (and huge, with large chunks of fresh seafood).  It was actually one of the best bowls of pho I've had (mind you I live in NYC, which is notoriously lacking in solid Vietnamese cuisine, but still).  The shrimp and pork shumai ($9) were gorgeously plump and tasty - an excellent way to start the meal.  And the Fresh Young Coconut ($8) was a terrific way to end.

Service was a little slow, and my waitress wouldn't serve me congee because she didn't think I would like it (I beg to differ, but no sense arguing with the person in control of preventing you from passing out from hunger).  The menu is vast, not for the indecisive, and a little schizophrenic, drawing inspiration not from one country, but four (Thailand, Japan, China, Japan).

45 mins wait for dim sum and noodles. Even though the foods weren't all terrible, I still found it silly that we waited so long in Vegas to have generic Chinese foods. 

Dim sums - they have cart service! Genius on their parts since they approach you with the carts while you wait for your entrees. They don't have the price listed on the carts so you are more likely to grab a bunch of overpriced items. Each tiny dim sum dish starts at $7 plus. Although I did enjoy their spare ribs and minced meat in fried footballs, neither were something I was dying to have seconds of. Save your wallet and hold off your dim sum craving until you find yourself in an actual dim sum restaurant. 

Hainanese chicken - one of my all time favs ruined here at Noodles. I had to send back my first chicken because the center came out cold (with oozing gelatine/fat). On the second, slightly warmer chicken, the skin was rubbery and meat was extremely tough. The dish was nearly inedible. 

Stewed beef noodle and dan dan noodles - the stewed beef was so tough (again) I couldn't get a bite in. My husband however said the noodles were tasty. He also raved about the dan dan noodles. Maybe the restaurant does know a thing or two about Noodles.

My recommendation is the Yellow Indian Noodles. I know that when you're in Las Vegas you feel obligated to drink alcohol, but if you're at Noodles take a break from the booze and order the fresh soy milk.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Even my friends who don't like soy milk like this stuff.  But if you absolutely won't try it, get the Thai tea instead.  It's potent.

The mango pudding was probably the best. It wasn't over sweetened and it literally melts in your mouth. 

Total came out to be $60.

On another note, I can't say I'm a fan of their bowls / spoons. The bowl is pretty steep, making it hard to scoop any soup. Also, the spoon being really thick doesn't help with that.

Went at 8pm, and were seated by 9pm. In the evenings, there is usually a line, and the later you go, the smaller that line is. Option to make reservations, so you can skip the line. Or you can order takeout at the host stand. One of the hostesses was very busy, going to the line, asking how many people per group, so she could get everyone in faster. She was running back and forth from the restaurant, getting menus, and probably looking at available tables in each waiter's section. 

I think the restaurant is fairly large, as in addition to the ""main room"" right when you walk in, I think there were sections to the left and right, but were hidden by walls. 

Bar type seating by the kitchen, but there was a lot of foot traffic as the waiters moved back and forth. Really loved the mix of standard tables and long bench tables/seating. Gave a cozy, family vibe to a modern restaurant. The wall of noodles was interesting decor as well. 

Our server, Kenny, super friendly! Oh, and everyone here spoke English. With accents, but can definitely understand them without repeating yourself. 

Our dishes:

Plain jook - very plain as described and good if you aren't feeling well, want something hot, or a small, simple soup that won't make you full, thirsty, or mess with your taste buds. This was perfect! Although I did add a bit of soy sauce. 

Spring rolls -- nothing special here, typical fried appetizer. And appeared to not not have any filling. No vegs, except for a wisp of green that I assumed was cabbage. In fact, was mostly dough, and the dipping sauce was so watery and thin. 

Basket of steamed veggies -- after all the Vegas junk eating, craving something fresh. Got very little asparagus, pepper, bok choy, and carrots (1 piece each at minimum, 2 if you were lucky, and 3 if they were feeling generous or mistakenly counted the pieces) and mainly broccoli, yellow squash. 

Dory fish with scallions and ginger -- light and flavorful. Ginger was sliced thickly, as opposed to finely chopped/slice, so it's more for garnish than for eating. Fish was subtle, and reminded me of really tender chicken. 

Chilean sea bass with black bean and garlic sauce - flaky, juicy, and amazingly delicious with the flavorful sauce. Melt in your mouth tender. Wish we had ordered two of these. 

Fish dishes come with rice, but they were not brought out with our food, and it took about 5 or so minutes before we finally flagged someone down. I just chalked it up to being busy.They were very courteous when mentioning this. 

We had ordered a lot, and the waiter didn't bring out one of the pan fried noodle/gravy dishes. When we inquired about it, Kenny said it had not been taken down during ordering. So either we confused him or we misheard him when he was reading the order back to us, Lol. Either way, no big deal. We were not charged for it, and he ended up doing us a favor since we were so full from everything and ended up bringing leftovers back upstairs to our room.

Inside of the Bellagio is this restaurant, beautifully decorated with bamboo, wood, and light colors, set back so it's quiet and away from the smoke and slot machines. 
To start we got tempura vegetables - awesome! Probably my favorite Japanese appetizer; all nicely friend, crunchy, but soft on the side. Also got the special which came with a small miso, very nice. 
We got the spicy beef, and the shrimp with bok choy. I preferred the beef, though they were both really good; The bok choy/shrimp was more fresh with the vegetables, and the beef had the delicious wide noodles and juicy beef. The only downfall was that they both had a bit too much oil; they were almost swimming in it at the end. We'd come back because this place was one of the best meals we had while in Vegas - but would try something else, to try something new but also to see if there's something less oily.",6u49z3pjNVKs1O4rBmKXvA,1,1,4,9Ou9EsukBJmmcpzZ-37XYQ

Noodles is the Asian version of that cafe, only it closes at 3am.  A variety of random Asian dishes, some better than others, but nothing that stands out or that you'd want to go back for.  

I had the double happiness with BBQ pork and roast duck.  It's a dish with all meat, so I ordered a small bowl of rice on the side.  If you get the fried rice with duck, it's 90% rice, 10% duck.  The dish was $22.50 and while overpriced, still the best plate on the table.  Both meats were tender and flavorful.  You could easily order this dish and share among 2 people.  Well worth it.  

My hb got the laksa curry noodle.  It was a decent sized bowl, was steaming hot, but a bit on the fishy side for me.  More fishy, less curry.  Not my favorite.  

Our friend got the braised beef brisket rice.  He said it was good, but not great.  It was more of a meal for one as opposed to a dish to share, so plan accordingly.  

We also tried the tempura shrimp and at $12.75 came with 4 pieces.  They were decent sized, and done well, but easily something you could get anywhere else.  

Service was just ok.  It seemed there were many servers, but a lot of waiting around.  We weren't in a hurry, so we weren't bothered by it, but I did see a server straight up eating behind the counter, then with food still in her mouth and chewing, she picked up a few dishes and served them.

Tip#2 - do use your comps here, it's a good way to get a decent meal after a long day to the poker tables.  If you pay out of pocket, expect about $5 to $10 per menu item more than what you would pay in Chinatown (go to Spring Mountain Road).

Tip#3 - don't worry about not speaking Cantonese or Mandarin when coming here, their customer service is efficient and helpful (but not friendly, remember this is a Chinese restaurant).

Tip#4 - do order their crab meat vermicelli with xo sauce ($24), it has tons of real crab meat.

I ordered white rice and enjoyed the sights around me, this restaurant is very well put together and has an upscale yet authentic feel to it making it very enjoyable nonetheless! The staff were very attentive, and they even serve you sides from a cart with little metal containers for each to keep them warm!

It was a very sweet and comfortable experience for my mother's birthday. The tonkotsu was her favorite bowl of the evening, and everything was well organized in means of menu.

Noodles serves food from all different Asian cuisines, but the majority of the menu is Chinese.   Don't let the name fool you, they also have rice dishes, meats and seafood, vegetables and dim sum.    

A group of us shared some dishes family-style.  We started with Shu Mai (5 pcs/$10), Crispy Shrimp Balls (4 pcs/$10) and Vegetable Spring Rolls (3pcs/$10).  All three came out piping hot and were enjoyable, but the shrimp balls stood out with their perfectly fried crunchy exterior.

For the main dishes we shared Fried Rice with BBQ pork ($18.25), Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodle Soup ($19.50), Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles ($19.88) and Sauteed Bok Choy ($13).  Surprisingly, the chow mein was just okay.  It had too much vegetable and not enough noodles, and I'm used to chow mein noodles being thinner and longer.  The fried rice was a better dish to me.  The bok choy was nothing special, we just wanted veggies.  The Thai soup had a very flavorful tangy/spicy broth and came with good sized shrimp.  Although we shared everything, the soups are really individual size servings.

The food here is good but I would've liked it even more if they served fresh, house made noodles given the name of the restaurant.  If you don't mind paying the price of convenience on The Strip, give this place a try.",c_HRWeQtTIyT1ICK09C6FQ,7,5,4,qZkMmem03ktu58Edzq8v8A

The waiter was nice and fast and the food was also. We had the bbq pork buns for starters, and they weren't as good as I hoped. It was the breading around it, because the pork inside was tasty. 

They give you such a good amount of food, and it tasted great. It was a peaceful place which I loved because it sucks trying to talk over people or hearing someone else's convo.

There was a line in front of the restaurant and about 6 parties in front of us, but we decided to wait since no one was particularly hungry. The wait ended up being about 25 minutes. Some were seated sooner but we had a party of five so it took a little longer.

The restaurant has a variety of rice and noodle dishes from different countries, from your Chinese meat over rice (roast duck, char siu, soy sauce chicken) to varieties of fried rice, to udon, pad thai, chow fun, and chow mein.

We decided to eat family style and ordered chow fun (rice noodles with soy sauce, bean sprouts, and BBQ pork), BBQ pork fried rice, chicken pad thai, double happiness (roast duck and soy sauce chicken), and steamed book choi with oyster sauce.

At first I thought we may have ordered too much, but the food was so delicious that we ate everything. That is not to say the portions were too small, just that the food was really good. The duck was crispy and lean. The pad thai was made with flat rice noodles which gave it an interesting twist. The chow fun had big pieces of pork in it. All and all, the family gave it a hearty thumbs up.

Upon being seated we were greeted by a female server that seemed very annoyed we were taking up her space. I asked a question about the menu and she acted like I had two heads and simply pointed at the menu (no, it wasn't a language barrier). Then the noise began. The tables were so close together the lady to my right's phone conversation made it difficult to hear my fiancé ... and the call lasted the entire length of our meal. About the time the entree arrived (food: average at best) the servers decided to reposition every chair in the restaurant by sliding them over the tile floor instead of picking them up, creating an unbelievably loud screeching sound from every direction. This was also the time  the kitchen staff found it necessary to begin pounding on something that apparently needed a LOT of pounding ... Really loud pounding! The couple to our left finally had enough and called over the server to complain. The server listened then  disappeared to the kitchen ... and the noise continued until we'd almost finished. I was so annoyed and uptight all I could think of was getting out of there ... So we did ... But they weren't done with us ... My fiancé and I had stomach trouble for the next 24 hours. 

Bottom line: Noodles is a great location ... for some other restaurant.

Update: Let me be clear: The service culture and facility that is Bellagio (other than Noodles) was FLAWLESS during our stay. We ate at several restaurants that were excellent; visited bars, tables, etc. Noodles may be part of Bellagio but it was on another planet from the rest of our Bellagio experience.

After our most recent delicious plate of snow peas, we decided to return, and this time, the snow peas were missing that addictive flavor. They weren't as sweet, nor as seasoned with wok-iness. I ate them, but I wasn't compelled to eat them faster than my husband to ensure I had more (which I did last time!). We also ordered a noodle dish, and it seemed a tad dry although the flavor was solid. I still think the nice sized, $4 miso soup is a good value on the Strip, but it doesn't have seaweed.

My friend got the cucumber salad.  When the waitress brought it out it looked like a side order or extra stuff like cilantro that you'd put on your food.  Plate was hella small in portion.  And it cost $8.  So glad I didn't opt for salad this time.  I would've been super disappointed and pissed.  I ordered the fried rice which cost $15-16 bucks.  I was so happy with this order compared to the rest.  It tasted decent and It was bigger in portion LOL  I did have to add a lot of hot sauce to it and peppers.

It was okay, not great, but okay. Kind of pricey, but then again, you are eating in a restaurant inside the Bellagio in Vegas, so what do you expect. 

The bf had the beef chow fun which he said was pretty good, and I had the BBQ pork noodle soup (my comfort food after a night out hehe). The BBQ pork noodle soup wasn't spectacular (I didn't particularly like the charsiu because I thought the flavor was a little off) but it was definitely nice to have that option of eating it without leaving the strip. The dim sum looked legit, but I have a sneaking suspicion it doesn't taste legit. I would suggest sticking to dishes that are hard to mess up, i.e. chow mein or chow fun.

My hubby  ordered the seafood pho that was TWENTY DOLLARS and I ordered congee (rice porridge) with pickled veggies, even that was overpriced. 

Don't get me wrong, if the food was worth all that money, I wouldn't complain. The Pho came out in this extra tiny bowl! I mean, it was a small bowl, like those Asian soup bowls that we all have in our home. The Pho was bland and they only give you 3 measly shrimps and few slices of ODENG (fish cakes). REALLY? THAT's SEAFOOD PHO!! So disappointing. Now,  onto my dish. The congee wasn't anything special. The pickled radish was whatever too, nothing special. 

It really wasn't that great. I rather would have gone to Monte Carlo to their Asian noodle house instead. They have better size portions (u can definitely share) and better price.

When I did my result for Chinese restaurants in Vegas, there were several but I think a lot of them are either modern/contemporary so all sorts of fancy stuff and/or very expensive. Noodles is a good ""normal"" tasty Chinese restaurant.",4nLHwGu02U_LTA-fuV90SA,0,0,4,UkFPJLKrf-bfbzM9zLKbWQ

The casual eatery has a large selection of dishes to choose from. I recommend picking something with noodles, hence the name. I had gotten the wonton noodles before, and it was pretty good after adding some salt. I also recommend the Thai iced tea. 

Unfortunately, today I ordered the Hainanese chicken with bones in, and this was the worst I have had. The chicken tasted a bit funky and was very salty. The soup that came with the dish was salty too, but it tasted ok after eating the chicken. That's how salty the chicken was. It overpowered everything. The side sauces were nothing special just minced ginger, chili, and soy sauce. I had to ask for a sweet chili sauce to make the chicken more bearable. The fragrant rice that came with the chicken was the only good part of the dish. It costs around $22 too! 

Overall, come here for the wide variety of Asian food and stick with noodles. The menu has traditional Mandarin too for those who like a Mandarin menu.

If you are Chinese and gambling and you dont like white or fusion food, you're probably the target audience for Noodles. The only fusion thing about this place is the decor. 

We tried to avoid Noodles because, well, it's in the Bellagio; but I was craving for some warm broth at 11:30pm and the PF Chang was conveniently just closed when we walked in at 11ish. 

My boyfriend got the $16 BBQ pork on rice (cha siu) and I got the $14 wonton noodle soup. It's authentic, no doubt and the bbq pork on rice was REALLY good. The wonton was a little dry, and the whole thing was good (not really really good). True Chinese comfort food.

The decor is elegant, because, you know, it's the Bellagio. 

I guess the main thing is that it opens really late (even after O finishes at 11:30 you can still eat there) so that's where they get you (well, if you're not interested in eating a FAT burger down the road).

My coworker and I ordered:

Sesame chicken: looked like thin strips of plastic dipped in starchy sweet and sour sauce. Funny cause it tasted like it too. Only thing sesame about it were the sprinkles on top.

XO Green beans: I asked the waiter what XO was (HEY, JUST CAUSE IM ASIAN DOESNT MEAN I AUTOMATICALLY KNOW ALL THE SAUCES GEEZ) and he said I shouldn't be worried because it's very tasty and not too spicy. I wasted my time asking cause I didn't even taste any sauce. It was so bland. The string beans must have been grown in a neighborhood farm (note this is Vegas) cause they were sooooo small and skinnnnnnnny. I felt so bad for those guys I almost wanted to just drench them in my water. Well, atleast it had a nice crunchy texture.

Laksa curry: Our other coworker said it was difficult to eat bc of a strange fishy taste although it was a chicken curry soup...*cringe*

Beef noodle soup was the best bowl of the table so we just stared at her as we crunched or sipped politely on.

Long story short, I love this place. This is the only place I eat when I play poker at the Bellagio. This is the only place my dad eats at too. All their noodle soups are awesome. Wonton noodle soup, Mandarin beef noodle soup, I feel like I'm in Hong Kong again. Except it's slightly nicer and the money is paid in US dollars. Their roti prata is also quite good.

Instead of the traditional kimchi, we had hot and spicy cucumber, cucumber and kim salad, udon soup, and kung pao shrimp with warm saki and a Coke for me.
Everything was delicious. I enjoyed the cucumber dishes. Very yummy! The prawns for the kung pao shrimp cooked to perfection with a wonderful sauce. The flavor of the red bell pepper complimented the sauce and shrimp. The portion sizes were exactly right for two.

After a long 3 1/2 hour drive from California, checking into the Bellagio, and getting settled in the room, they start craving for Asian food. The first restaurant that comes up in Noodles because it's not too big like the other restaurants and it's tucked away right by the Baccarat Bar and table games. 

Every time we wait to be seated, it takes about 15 - 20 minutes but when Chinese customers wait, they are seated right away like they were, V.I.P.'s. Sounds like discrimination to me!  The Contemporary decoration in this restaurant was very relaxing with various jar of ingredients they use for their overpriced food. 

Our server was friendly and personable and gave us our drinks right away with some time to order. 

We ordered: 

*Hot Tea $4.50 -- Jasmine

*CHILEAN SEA BASS $34: Nonya curry sauce, bell peppers, onions (steamed) Homemade garlic ginger sauce, broccoli (steamed or deep fried) Soy sauce, green onions, ginger (steamed)

*BEEF $22 Kung pao sauce, bell peppers, onions, peanuts Broccoli, straw mushrooms, carrots Mongolian style, bell peppers, onions, green onions
Black pepper sauce, asparagus Black bean sauce, bell peppers, onions, garlic

*CHINESE BROCCOLI $12.50 Sautéed in garlic or steamed (oyster sauce)

*CANTONESE ROAST DUCK $18.50 Plum sauce

The food in my honest opinion was delicious and I couldn't fault on anything. What bothered me and caused the review to go from 5 stars to 2 stars was the service. It took us a while to get our refills for out water and the food took about 25  - 35 minutes to be served. 

Our server kept telling us, ""the food was on it's way,"" my Dad got tired of waiting and went to hit the slots. Around the restaurant, I noticed a lot of Chinese customers were getting their food much faster than us and that made me irritated. I never experienced this level of service.

We got their (only) seafood pho and pork chow mein.

Seafood Pho: $18.50 for a tiny (small) bowl of noodles. I actually really liked the broth BECAUSE it wasn't salty... you can tell they don't really put MSG or salt in it cuz it was bland. Therefore, probably healthier. however, it's practically $20! you can't give me another cup of noodles?! I got three decent sized shrimps and lots of fishcakes (in Korean- o-dang). They charge extra for lime and bean sprouts... wtf?! Save your money and get pho from anywhere OTHER than here.

Chow Mein: the noodles were REALLY good... tender and the pork, just right. i highly recommend it, though it was also almost $20. 

Overall, the food wasn't all that bad, just overpriced by 200%.

My REAL review is for their service. Why are there 10 people working, but no one to check up on us? What is WRONG with your service?

They just lose a star because they're pretty expensive when factoring it all in! (I know I know, it's all expensive now on the Strip, but seriously... $18 for chow mein... $24 for kungpao shrimp... $21 for hainan chicken?) But in my eyes, for anyone to grab five stars their food has to be exemplary and/or at a great price for what you get... Don't get that here, but don't get me wrong; I dine here at least once each time I get to Vegas. It's my go-to when I need my Chinese fix. At least they don't charge for hot tea (like that Chinese place in the MGM does....) They're not WAY overpriced for what you get, and the price won't stop me from getting my hainan and pei dan jook.

Oh, and a last note, I don't know what that person is saying about how they wish it was more authentic...... It's pretty authentic to the stuff that we have back home. 

Eat their jook, and not everything is outrageously overpriced, but when in Vegas, c'est la vie! Satisfy that craving!

EDIT: btw, whoever keeps complaining about how overpriced and everything is probably doesn't gamble at bellagio with their $25 table minimum, or cries over having gambled away their $100 fortune.... i'm just saying. yes, i am chinese. yes, the price makes me cringe sometimes. and i realize even i took away a star for it, but i admit i am one of those who cries over that $100 i lost and i steer clear away from those $25 tables. but if you're going to focus so much on it why the heck are you even in vegas? for their really overpriced shows?? sorry, it's late and i just got done reading post after post about how expensive the food is and comparing Noodles to some hole in the wall. go to chinatown if you want and know that's where you'll get chinatown-priced chinese food. how about instead of croaking on about it on a bellagio restaurant, you praise that chinatown locale instead? gaaaahhhhh appreciate, don't hate!",zPWBR9BDEc3arZ8cc1quUg,2,1,4,OowFQxt2--R-4vLV1cvhMw

My friends and I discovered the simple logic of Noodles' pricing. Take the price you would pay at any regular Asian restaurant not located in the Bellagio and multiply it by 2. We found this out the hard way when we all decided to get a bowl of white rice for each of us and saw that once we got the bowl it was $4 per bowl and that my glass of cranberry juice was $4.50. I mean I don't expect anything else since it is in the Bellagio but just giving you all a heads up.

The food I would give it a 3.5-4 (Crab vermicelli is delishhhh) but the reason I gave a 2 is because of the service. Unless they are trying to give you a really authentic experience of an Asian restaurant, which includes horrible service, then I get it. Other than that, there should be no reason why the service in such a high class place such as the Bellagio should be so bad! They seriously need some extra hospitality training. We would call our waitress to get us another glass of water for the billionth time and she would raise her finger up at us as if to hush us and rush off. Granted she did give us our water eventually, but every time we asked for something it was as if every waiter and waitress were walking by so fast to avoid being called on by anyone or it would be given reluctantly. Come on now, if I'm paying $4 for a tiny bowl of white rice I better be getting some tip top service!",JcCNyiiwxprHRsdP4tKijA,0,0,2,-v261cSMbV7k5qTO4aL3Wg

It is a cute spot with benches and benches of seating, it was pretty empty when we arrived so we were seated immediately. There are a variety of items on the menu, noodle dishes, rice dishes, soup dishes, etc. This restaurant is pricey, but it is open late night (till 2am daily) so I guess the up-charge is for that convenience. 

I ordered the Congee and a Thai Iced Tea. The Thai Iced Tea was average, nothing amazing (refills are not free for this drink). The Congee (rice porridge) was very watery... for $6 it was way overpriced. It is literally rice and water! Most congee dishes I have ordered from other restaurants use a chicken or veggie broth to give the rice some flavor, they do not do that here. There were other congee options on the menu that came with protein that would likely flavor the dish (poached chicken, egg and pork, fish fillet, seafood, abalone). The other congee options were insanely overpriced as well, chicken with some rice and water for $14?! No thanks.... After dumping soy sauce and hot peppers into my congee, it became bearable to eat. My friend ordered the Beef Stew Noodle Soup, the broth was decent, but the beef was too fatty for my taste.

The service was good, our drinks were always refilled and our waitress checked on us numerous times. This is the main reason why I am giving 3/5 stars versus 2/5 stars.

5593838,2017-04-19,2,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"We were hungry. It was Saturday evening. We didnt wanna wait in a long line and we wanted to stay on Bellagio property. Noodles to the rescue... Or so we thought. I thought it was just ok. I definitely expected more but having grown up on authentic Chinese cooking in San Francisco and living in Los Angeles as an adult, with all the options there, I should have known better. Noodles was just an americanized version of Asian cooking.

I was starved so I went with the $30.88 prix fixe menu. Probably my first mistake... Ha! I chose the wonton soup over the miso. It was just ok. The broth was fine to me but others at our table thought it was too salty. The wontons were filled with shrimp and were just ok. It was on the bland side for me, as far as the dumplings go.

For the appetizer, I ordered the pan fried potstickers (gyoza) over the spring rolls. I love gyoza and you get 3 pieces in this order. They were fried just right and were filled with pork and vegetables. The dipping sauce was tasty. Sad to say that these pot stickers were the highlight of my meal at Noodles.

For the entree, I chose chicken chow mein. You can choose between chicken, beef, bbq pork or shrimp for this dish. I had visions of Hong Kong style thin and crispy chow mein noodles like I am used to eating at Asian cafes in San Gabriel Valley. Nope... Not even close. What I got were big, wide egg noodles that were rather tasteless. Definitely not what I wanted or expected. It was a huge serving and I hated to waste the food so I just tried to eat all the chicken pieces of the dish. Yeah, it was that tasteless to me. I had to add soy sauce.... That should tell you something. The other entree options were pad thai or sweet & spicy noodles. The same meats I listed above are the options for those dishes as well.  

Service was good. Our waitress was nice and our drinks were refilled almost immediately... The food just wasnt up to expectations. Especially considering that its located inside Bellagio. It should be better. And with what we got, it should have been much less expensive than we paid.

              Located next the  Pai-Gow Tables at the Bellagio! My fav spot to have a bowl of egg wonton noodle soup when I need a break from Pai-Gow. 

               This time it was brunch Dim Sum with my folks, no gambling on this trip. We came 10 minutes before 11AM when they open. There was a few people in front of us. By 11:30 AM, the line was 45 minutes wait on a SAT lunch?!?!

               We ordered the same thing each time we are here:

- Wonton egg noodle soup - the egg noodles made fresh daily, super fine, Cantonese style, served with shrimp wonton, & cabbage. The broth is nice & the wonton is fine. 

- Roasted Duck egg noodle soup - the duck got no fat between the skin & the meat, tender, free range duck. My dad loves it.

- Calamari with Thai sweet and spicy dipping sauce - nice snack.

- Dim Sum - Fung chao chicken feet & XIu Mai prok dumplings are mu FAV. Shrimp balls were equally good!

-Stir fried garlic pok choy.

- & Cafe Sua Da - Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. 

                This NOODLES shop by far is the most consistent noodles in all the high end hotels around here, better than Red8 @ Wynn or 9Noodles @ Caesars or even Mandalay Bay!

               All noodles soup runs between $14-$17, consider it's cheap for 5 stars hotel, stop complaining on the cos people! It's the Bellagio! To me it hits the spot when I need it & for me, that's priceless!

We didn't get the app until the couple next to us was leaving.  And I'm sure of this because the lady was getting up and asked what we were eating because she had never seen steamed buns before.

1. consistency - it's not fantastic one day, dreadful the next. It is consistently good;
2. cooperation - I have two food allergies. One of the few things that sends my beloved off the deep end is when I explain them in detail, and then a dish is served that features foods containing one or both of the prohibited items. Not so with Noodles. If I pick something that contains a no-no ingredient, they advise me in advance; and
3. variety - purists will decry the all-over-the-map options, but sometimes a wide selection is the best way around group dining issues.

So there was a LARGE plate of tofu and the agedashi sauce was served on the side.  No diakon, green onion or much flavor for that matter.  I had to add soy to the sauce to bump up the flavor.

Food was alright...kind of mediocre, I wouldn't come here again (& for more reasons below!). The five of us each got different dishes and they were okay...pretty subpar. I guess being Asian, you have a bit of a higher standard for noodle dishes, but as non-biased as I am trying to be, the food here was below average.

The worst part came AFTER we left Noodles. One of my friends had an allergic reaction to the food (she ordered the pad thai) after we left. She had trouble breathing and broke out in hives everywhere until she took some Benadryl to alleviate the reaction. She is allergic to nuts, not peanuts (peanuts are legumes, not nuts!), so we assumed there may have been other nuts in the pad thai they might have not listed on the menu. We called the restaurant to let them know of this and after talking to several (at least 3) people at the restaurant, they repeatedly just read the menu to us and said she might've had a reaction to the peanuts. Like I said...she is not allergic to peanuts and orders pad thai all the time. There were probably other products in the food that were processed in a place with nuts, we assumed. We talked to the manager and he was very apologetic over the phone, got our information down (what hotel we were staying at, what room, how bad the reaction was, etc.), and insisted that he send someone up to our hotel room to check on my friend. She was feeling a little better (able to breathe, thank God), but we agreed to the person coming up to check on her just to make sure she was okay. We waited quite a while in the hotel room...no one came up. The manager ended the phone call with ""Sorry about that, hope you feel better."" ...thanks, NOODLES.

Overall experience: mediocre food and bad customer service (even before my friend got sick). And then they did not keep their promise of having someone come up to our hotel room at the Monte Carlo. Yes, my friend did feel better after taking Benadryl, but after getting our information down and extensive phone conversations with us regarding the situation, and all of us waiting in our room, you would think management would come through. We also e-mailed them after we left Vegas a couple days later about this, but no response. -_-

Get it together, NOODLES!",8YUo5Jx-ZCB_hHuGTmo35g,2,1,1,u4kA79RybwH2z0tEiHjPBA

The Pad Thai noodles were the best I have ever had. My spouse ordered ribs. So tender and full of flavor. We got full and couldn't finish the generous portions.

First time I ordered something simple everything just ok, second time, the food was way, way, too salty, long wait, no condiments and on and on and on.
Never to return

We ordered pork buns and noodle soup.  From a taste perspective, it was fine.  However, the service was bad.  The food was almost thrown onto the table.  If this restaurant was on Fremont Street, you deal with it.  But since Bellagio is ""five stars"" you would think this eatery would focus on customer service.

The noodle came in a large ceramic bowl that is loaded with noodles and beef, but too little soup.  The ratio of soup to noodle is out of balanced.  Only 1/3 of the bowl was filled with soup and the rest noodles.  For some people who like to eat a lot, maybe those extra noodles would help, but to me, it's gorse.  To make the matter worse, the noodles are soggy, not tender and chewy at all.   Blah, will not come here again.",xRbBt5MVKZ5-_8HhhfI26g,5,2,2,e0ZF83ODNkgoxIHIub2YCQ
5950644,2014-07-05,0,CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,"Noodles is apparently ""known"" for its noodles and dim sum. Psht dim sum, more like dim a lot(of money) [sorry bad pun]. 

Anyways, the decoration of the place was pretty cool and unique. Noodles everywhere! The service was interesting. It took our server 15minutes to realize that we were sitting at our table. After swinging our arms and giving her the head nod. The hostess finally went to get her. (-1 star) When she got to us, she was friendly and even spoke Chinese, which I guess is a plus if you can't speak English. 

To the food: we ordered the premium fried rice, some kind of soba noodle soup, beef noodle soup, duck egg congee, crab meat vermicelli noodles, a few dim sum items. 

Hold on to your hats, I'm going to do a quick run through of everything. 

Premium fried rice: contains pineapples. Has a sweet taste. However very dry, so I'm assuming they used fresh cooked rice, making the fried rice dry. Tasted like nothing to me. L

Soba noodle soup: tastes like sake.

Beef noodle soup: good soup base, but there was not enough soup. The beef was well cooked, so it was soft and it easily ""melted"" in your mouth. The egg noodles did not match the taste of the beef noodle soup. The noodles tasted like flour to me.

Congee: tasted pretty good, the chicken had no taste.

Vermicilli noodles: crab meat was dry. Dish was okay but really salty for my taste. 

Dim sum: it was dim sum but it wasn't with like 9-11$ for a plate. Haha.

Overall, if you're craving Asian and are too lazy to walk into the hell wrath heat outside, go here. Otherwise I don't recommend. :)",sKeR2FlexQJU9_zzFlWk5g,0,0,3,Z0ZeCadjdCt4cCgzMA4nwQ

I love the fried rice they make at Noodles. I ordered the duck which came with fried rice and vegetables. The duck was moist and flavorful but not fatty as most of the fat had been rendered. Paired with the fresh vegetables and delicious fried rice, I was very happy to stuff myself,  not something  I usually do.

The dumplings are very good too.
