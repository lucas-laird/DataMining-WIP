They received 4 stars because the ordering took awhile. There were two people working by the counter and I was the customer.

1466374,2017-08-31,0,wPqt3SVl0h3_P3-wW__gYg,"While in Vegas to celebrate a milestone, my wife and I had a strong desire for some street tacos. A Google search generated a bunch of Mexican restaurants on the strip. However, we were both exhausted and not in the mood to deal with the inescapable hustle and bustle associated with the strip. A quick Yelp search for ""hot and new"" restaurants revealed a Mexican restaurant called Trillo's Street Tacos.
 
My Google Maps navigation led us to a small business complex with a Arco AMPM gas station on the corner. After a quick survey of the business complex, we realized that the restaurant was located within the AMPM. To be honest, we were both skeptical of the setup. In my experiences, restaurants located within gas stations (even well-established businesses such as Burger King) have an indescribable generic, mediocre taste (or maybe it's a mental thing). However, we were both starving so Trillo's Street Tacos it was!
 
When we walked up to the register we were warmly greeted by one of the owners (the business is owned by a couple). She took our orders (two Ground Beef nachos and four chicken street tacos) and gracefully accepted my Yelp offer for a free street taco upon ""check in (woot woot!)."" A little over ten minutes later our food was ready.
 
The nachos were delicious and were prepared using homemade chips (the difference between homemade chips vs. prepackaged chips is substantial). The large portion size of the nachos did not allot for any room to eat our street tacos (therefore I can't provide a review for the street tacos).
 
If you're looking for good Mexican food in Vegas, stop by Trillo's Street Tacos!",PNhwVhoMrR4QeEx29bcw-A,4,2,4,ttznMCBmsPJhxa1xNvrkCQ

The real surprise came when I bit into the food. I actually had to pull over and eat them because I didn't want to wait any longer. The taste was that good. It was fresh and delicious.

With our respective Mexican Corn to go and the BEST  part is that they have a grade "" A "" ( so we don't have to worry about our kids getting sick, like unfortunately they've used to be after running behind the elotero guy) Customer service is amazing! This place is run by a family, very nice people, they are always on top of their game, asking if we need anything else, very attentive. I have two suggestions, #1 will be to add natural fruit waters, like mango but that's only because I love to eat my qesadillla or my tacos with my agua de mango fresca.

There were 6 chairs - 1 was totally ripped, the other one I sat on was leaning forward making me feel like I was going to fall out of it.

We ordered a burrito for $7 and Chicken Nachos for $7 - plus drinks came almost to $20 for 2 people to eat.  The gas station light was very bright and annoying and we ate our meal facing the beer cooler section - how romantic.  

My ' chicken ' nachos should have been called refried bean Nachos as there were a lot more refried beans then chicken.  The chicken was cut in TINY cubes and there were about 10 cubes on my entire huge plate of Nachos.  They were also COLD and the shredded cheese was NOT even melted.  The chips were hard, the Salsa was like water but very hot - more like Louisiana hot sauce then Salsa.  The Burrito was flavorless.  I would not go back if you were giving me the meal for free.  Employees were nice though and therefore I still tipped them a couple of $$$.

Before walking in I decided to check Yelp and saw they had an ""Buy Three Get One Free"" offer on tacos Mon-Fri. Today is Sunday and they still offered the deal to me. Awesome.

So I ordered three carne asada and one chicken taco. The meat was well seasoned and tasted great and had the perfect amount of char on it. And I felt like the amount of meat on the tacos was great. The tortillas were full, but not overstuffed. I saw other people complain about the tacos. But at roughly $2/ea, it's a damn good taco. It's not going to shoot out rainbows or cure the blues, but well worth the price you pay. 

The service was great. The lady at the counter was super nice and ordering wasn't difficult. The guy at the grill came out to ask what sauces I wanted with the Honey Sriracha fries I ordered. Which may seem stupid to some, but I think it's a great level of customer service to give a choice rather than just shove something in a bag and hope the customer likes it.

The only thing I wasn't a fan of, was the Honey Sriracha fries. I didn't really get the taste of honey OR Sriracha. Also, the fries were a little ""soft"" for my liking. But, to me, that doesn't warrant a lower rating because every place has things they make well and things they aren't as amazing. And the taste of the other food paired with the service, it's a well earned five stars from me.

Also, if you are scared to eat tacos from a place inside a gas station, you're not living. I have yet to have gas station tacos there weren't damn good!",M5UgvsHFT8yTHB9IEmORbA,0,0,5,mquXeQq3qfF-ylkIb0JNRA

I tried the carne asada with guac... three tacos and tortilla chips with homemade sauces, definitely filling and delicious for the price. The horchata was also good, if you prefer it a little less sweet and less thick than usual. My friends got burritos which were massive. If you're hungry, skip the gas station snacks.

Since I came back from LA it's been really hard to find good tacos, burritos, and nachos. Everybody in Vegas is always like tacos el Gordo this and Roberto's that. Absolutely not! Those places are the worst to get Mexican food from. Trillos on the other hand hasn't let me down yet the owners are very friendly and genuine people. Their tacos are to die for fresh cooked asada and chicken daily, burritos are exquisite! And the nachos had me in a food coma. They even make the nachos themselves no store bought stuff at this place. I come here almost everyday for lunch as I work across the street. So if you're looking for a quick bite to eat that's satisfying go ahead and stop in you won't regret it!",UKFUT9rJIZVBwfSAYldRzQ,1,0,5,F-M8P3s4vJKES1MoK7TUdQ

5068577,2017-09-04,2,wPqt3SVl0h3_P3-wW__gYg,"I'll start right off by giving this place a 4 out of 5 star rating. The food was amazing and didn't leave me feeling like I had Taco Bell after it settled. That being said, there's a few things that I would change, when compared to the hundreds of other taco shops that are around the area. Keep in mind that these are just my personal opinions and in no way reflect poorly on the quality that this new restaurant has established. Being inside an AM/PM isn't that bad, with the exception of it being a complete pain in the ass to park and actually get inside. The lady at the counter was extremely nice and helpful with questions and suggestions. They were even kind enough to take our order over the phone so were weren't standing around waiting for it when we got there.

Let's give each item their own break down...

Tacos (Him):

We ordered (2) taco plates which equaled a total of (6) tacos. They came with a side of chips, green sauce, red sauce and a healthy amount of salsa. They were priced fairly at $2.00 a piece if you broke it down, which isn't bad considering you get a good sized side of chips and salsa as well with them. For me, the onions were unbearable. I always get only cilantro and onions on my tacos, but there were massive cuts. They should be chopped much finer so that it's not so overwhelming per each bite. The limes that were included where no where near ripe and had a sour taste that is far from the taste you would expect from a ripe one. The amount of meat in each taco is much appreciated. It's enough to fill you up if you have a small stomach and not leave you taking bites of tortilla that's meatless. That being said, it's no where near the amount of meat that almost every other taco shop includes in theirs. I should be able to pick that taco up and have meat falling out the other end with each bite.

Street Corn:

The Street Corn was fantastic. Not a single complaint about it. Next time, I'll be ordering more than one...

Burrito (Her):

The burrito was very good. I am a huge fan of having beans and rice in a burrito, so I'm glad it came with both. The tortilla was fried a little on the sides, which really added a nice touch to the burrito. It came with chips and salsa as well, which is really an awesome added bonus.

Salsa:

Not quite what I was expecting, nor what anyone else who tasted it was either. Hard to explain, it wasn't bad but it wasn't that traditional ""red sauce"" if that makes sense.

Overall:

The place is great. They are a new business and no one expects them to be amazing. From what I've heard, it's there first shop and they will get the kinks sorted out. If they don't... They will end up like the other taco shops who start off strong and end up being forgot really quickly (like Sin Frijoles). At the end of the day, it's just my personal opinion. Take that for what it is. I'll definitely be going back in the coming weeks to see if anything has changed and I'll update the review and hopefully kick this up to a 5 star where it belongs.

This place asked for honest feedback, so that's what I'm doing.

On a completely different note, the review from Oklahoma was written by one of the most ignorant Yelp reviewer's on here. They should have their rights to review anywhere revoked and account deleted. What in her mind would ever think that going into a gas station to get tacos would be romantic... Duh.",5_aEGcaMmKB0kjuTcoa4Pw,5,3,4,PvY67Ls-S6C_WuOtZmZ9hQ
