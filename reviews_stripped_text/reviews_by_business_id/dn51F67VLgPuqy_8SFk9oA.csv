On the down side there is always waiting ... We had to wait 20 minutes when half the dining hall is fenced off and closed. They could easily open increase capacity immediately by opening the hall.

My dining partner was upset as she tried to get a new bottle of catchup ... Twice calling the waiter no response.

The beers and house selection is very respectable. Some day I may raise number of stars... Based on this consideration ...

Also it is important to go at the right time. The bad singing and obnoxious noise of the worst Kareoke bar in town ( most bad Kareoke  singers and drunks attempting to remotely sing) drive most serious dining customers away.

427562,2013-08-28,0,dn51F67VLgPuqy_8SFk9oA,"Got a tip from a co-worker that this was the place to go for a reasonably priced dinner in Vegas.  He also made allusions to picking up the tab to sweeten the deal.  Fine.  As they say in Vegas, I'm all in.

The cafe is tucked into the back of the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery, which is off the Strip just southeast of the Westin Hotel on Flamingo.  A three minute walk from there.  

Once your eyes adjust from the glare outside to the darkness inside, the first thing that hits you is the cigarette stink.  Hey, it's Vegas, I know.  It's a casino, I know.  And this place is a throwback, I know.  I get it.  But god almighty, the place reeked of stale Marlboros long since converted to ash and emphysema.

Classic (some call it 'retro') vinyl booths and simple 4 place wood tables at which to dine.  Do not expect antiseptic cleanliness, however.  Everything I touched just kinda felt grimy.  Server took his time showing up to our table.  He was nice enough, but really slow.  Looking around, I saw LV bus drivers at one table, plenty of retirees, a cop or two and just a few random tourists in pleated shorts, t-shirts and sandals.  It's a local place, for sure.

Yep, the ""off the menu"" steak special is still there.  But you need to have the players card and a coupon to get it now.  Still, $8.99 for a hunk of meat, green beans, spud, salad and beer is a pretty good deal.  My co-worker ordered that.  I ordered the fish and chips with a salad and beer.

First, the beer was good.  I had a Hefe.  Coworker said his IPA was tasty as well.  SIde salad was typical iceberg with cherry tomato and croutons.  At least it was fresh.

Coworker said his steak was ""great"".  He didn't finish it, though.  Which kinda struck me as odd.  It wasn't like it was so gargantuan that he needed a stomach pump or a bucket, he just decided to take it back to his hotel room to ""have it for breakfast"".  Whatever.

My fish and chips was impressive looking.  3 huge slabs of freshly made cod, dipped and deep fried resting on a generous bed of 'chips'--you know, thick cut french fries.  

But...the fish was really greasy (and kinda dry, alas) and the chips were soggy--all of them.  No amount of lemon, malt vinegar, tartar sauce or ketchup could save what really was a balloon angioplasty in a basket.  I rarely have fish and chips, but the menu said that it was one of the 'house specialties'.  I didn't come close to finishing because the grease really was overpowering.

So...some greasy food served up in a cigarette stank house where you sit on vinyl booths that stick as you move around.  Bottom line: good beer, it's cheap (for Vegas), old-school throwback cheesy (it's Vegas) and certainly will fill your gut, if that's what you want, and if you disregard what your cardiologist might say--and hold your nose for the stink.  

As they say, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, indeed.  Keep it there.  I won't be back.",R5GvraTzRxgZyEQPuM5fow,0,0,2,L8HfUEsR9yHbGImd3h8A_A

Had dinner here with a friend this past May and ordered the Split Pea soup. Surprise!!! Bit into a big pork bone. I could have cracked a tooth or worst, choke on it! Called server immediately and showed her the bone. She was apologetic and understanding of my shock. After waiting for about 15 minutes, a very rude woman, who said she was the Manager, approached the table. She said that she had been to the kitchen and asked for the soup to be discarded. Not apologizing nor showing any concern or understanding for what had happened. She walked away.

Everywhere that sounded good was too far and my poor feet were too tired. As we sat at Paris trying to decide where to eat, my boyfriend found this place on Yelp and said that prime rib sounded good. I had actually bookmarked this place previously for their steak and eggs - so off we went! 

This place is off the strip, but literally just the street behind Paris/Bally. Not too far at all. As we were walking other pedestrians were headed that way as well. The area definitely looked a little sketchy, so I probably wouldn't walk there too late at night. It was around 5pm so still plenty of sun. 

The place is pretty small for a ""casino"" - the parking lot is in the front - but we were there just to eat anyway. The restaurant is straight back and to the left when you enter. 

The restaurant was busy! I took this as a good sign. Seems like a lot of locals, but also people who discovered this place from Yelp. We decided to share the prime rib special which came with a salad, prime rib, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a pint of beer. We don't drink so we asked our waiter if we could substitute it for something else - she said root beer - which we don't like either. She said ""that's the special - take it or leave it"" so we just opted out. Would've been nice if we could just have Sprite or Coke, but oh well. Still a fair deal. The menu said to ""ask your server about the double cut"" so we ended up getting that. And BOY did we f--- up hahahah. 

So as we're waiting for our food, the table next to us gets theirs. The gentleman gets a HUGE slice of prime rib, and we're thinking - ""that must be the double cut."" Then the waiter comes over and says, ""see, that's the regular size."" OHH. if we had known the regular was THAT big, we wouldn't of got the double cut. Hahah oh well - when in Vegas...

The salad was a standard green salad and we got ranch. Lettuce was clean and cold, croutons were crunchy - what else can you ask for. 

When the prime rib came it WAS huge and every one stared at us lmao. After we took the necessary yelp/Instagram pictures, we dove in! The meat was juicy and flavorful - I expect if we got the regular size it would've been more tender, but it was still good! Mashed potatoes and gravy were tasty and green beans were good. They were fresh green beans too, not the weird grey canned kind. 

Overall, very funny experience and tasty. I would return because everything is priced very reasonably and it's only a short distance from the strip! If you're looking for a local spot, try this!",ex3S55NOPGc-ZSrgOy_DCg,4,4,4,zZG4OekSr7JCPaYEx4skRw

Steak used to be so moist, tender and juicy but now that they probably rack out so much steak every day, lately I've been having super dry steak. You used to be able to order Caesar Salad with the special, but now you have to order it separately for almost $9, which is more expensive than the special and lastly, the price went up as well.

At that time, we arrived late into Sin City to discover that our room was still not ready at 11 pm.  Took a very long stroll to these digs and we were introduced to the excess that is Vegas!  Had an incredibly large omelette which could easily have satisfied both myself and my husband.

This time in Vegas, we showed up to a much busier restaurant at 9pm and found that not much had changed.  Ordered the broiled chicken breast, green beans and side (I chose rice pilaf) and was shocked that I'd also get a choice of salad or soup with all that for $8.99!  Even the wimpy dollar can't cringe at that!

Again, food easily could have been split for two as the plate arrived with a cup of rice and a cup of beans and TWO chicken breasts.  Salad was a mundane affair of iceberg lettuce, croutons and grape tomatoes, but not too bad for the price.  

My husband had a huge chicken baja wrap and fries and was happy with his plate.

Overall, another good experience with the food.  Only minor complaint was that the service had slid a bit compared to our prior visit (eg no one took our drink order for more than 10 minutes and the water didn't arrive at our table for 15 minutes  after that and food took quite awhile to show up) but overall, we'll chalk that up to how busy it was.

First, after waiting over and hour, they tried to seat our party of five at a small table for four when there were bigger tables available.  Then they didn't want to move us to a bigger table. 

Our son just eats pasta with butter. At first the waiter said if it's not on the menu we can't order it. We had to convince him to just do pasta with marinara without sauce, yes, that's how we had to order it. Next, our appetizer came 10 minutes after the entrees, I'm just confused about that. My brother-in-law ordered the pork chops (waiter said they were good). It (one) was over done and came with canned vegetables, ew. I had the steak and shrimp which was adequate. The rest of the meals were just okay (cheap diner food).  However, about 5 hours after the meal and my stomach is still a little funky. 

I do have to say that the waiter was very nice and very friendly.  I think he has to be when feeding people this stuff.

Service was a little slow from our server. Restaurant was about 60% full. She greeted us, got our drink order and it took about 8 mins to get our two waters. We ordered around 12:30am two steak specials and a cup of chicken noodle soup cause I figured the soup would come out fast and I was starving when we got here. Soup took a while to come out too but I was just happy to get a little something in me.

When they say ""cup of soup"" it's like half a cup lol the thing was super small. It was on the watery side, barely had any noodles and chicken. It was served hot though, which I appreciated.

Onto the steaks! We finally got it at 1am! 30 mins to get Steggs, which has been the longest I've ever had to wait for it, ever.


I agree with other yelpers that the stegg late night special here, even though it's like $2 more than other places, is probably one of the best I've had in Vegas. (The cafe at Arizona Charlie's on boulder highway is a close second for me. It was a plus that you didn't need a players card to have the special here at ellis) 

The quality of the steaks are actually good and cooked almost perfect. I ordered medium and my bf wanted medium rare. I got medium well and he got medium. 

The steaks weren't grainy or tough and when you cut into it the delicious juices actually were retained in the steaks and you can notice it in the pic posted. They were also seasoned well.

The potatoes o'brien were luke warm and not hot, sadness.. and my poached eggs were cooked half soft boiled and half hard boiled. The toasts didn't have much butter on them.. sadness again..

The karaoke did get annoying but was somewhat entertaining at the same time lol

Overall, we came for steaks and we got steaks that actually satisfied. I'd  rather pay a little more to enjoy my food rather than rely solely on the price and not enjoy it while eating.

We did see the table next to us order the king cut prime rib and I must say, it looks darn good. That thing was HUGE! Definitely plenty for two to share as it was 2 inches thick! At a good price to boot, $16.

We'll be back to try that prime rib out the next time for sure as well as the raved French onion soup (:",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,1,0,4,wOZr2DfsExau3oBqEva-Jw

We were asking around for some good places to eat from some fellow vacationers and someone told us about Ellis Island. We decided that we would give it a try, due to how highly this tourist talked of it. 
This place had a couple of good things about it but overall I don't think I will be going back. 

First of all it's really loud because it's in the middle of a casino and karaoke goes on right next door, so if you're looking for an intimate place to take someone, this is not your place. I know it's Vegas and there are casinos everywhere but I feel like this place would have more success if it was a secluded restaurant. 

We ordered calamari for an appetizer and then I decided I would go with the spaghetti with sausage. It had a fancier name on the menu but that's what it was. I WAS NOT impressed at all with the spaghetti at all. The noodles weren't cooked very well and the sauce tasted like it was justo poured out of a can. The only thing that got me through it was the sausage and even that wasn't very good. I would honestly give the food a 2 star. 2 because I saw some other meals that were there and they looked decent. The hand brewed Rootbeer is amazing if you stop by here though. 

What made me give that extra star for this place was our waiter. This guy was pretty awesome. He was personal, he did a great job and incredibly helpful when we were all ordering. I really appreciate that in a higher end restaurant.

The meals in the end were great. I had my steak cooked medium, baked potato (sour cream/butter), beans, chicken soup. The meals came before the soup but we didn't care. In the end, the plates and bowls were cleaned. My steak wasn't difficult to cut through and had a great flavor to it. I also had a homemade root beer to quench my thirst.

Graveyard specials run from 11PM-2AM. Parking is easy for this small locals casino: a small lot connected to a Motel 8. I drove my 4 drunk friends the 0.6miles from Caesars Palace at 4:30AM and we ordered and ate like college kids, all on a college kid budget. Total for the evening including tax =$56.66. The family-style order: 

1. Biscuit Special ($3.99): scrambled eggs, 2 biscuits smothered in gravy, 2 bacon (or sausage) - gravy was ok, had tiny bits of meat in it, everything was standard

2. Turkey Sandwich ($5.99): turkey, tomato, lettuce, mayo on bread. Comes with thick-cut fries. We shoved the bacon from the breakfast special into this and were so proud of our delicious, resourceful creation. 

3. 8oz NY Steak Special ($6.99): comes with toast, home fries, and 2 eggs how you like. We got one with over-easy and one with over-medium eggs and both were made correctly. Love smearing my toast with runny yolk. 

4. Hot wings ($7.99): dozen bomb.com wings. This was way better than we expected. It's really hard to find hot wings that make me happy- the struggle is real. These were good and although they tied for most expensive thing of the night, I'd come back and order them again and again. (RIP Hooters casino $.25 wings)

5. Chicken Fried Steak ($7.99): tied for price and deliciousness with hot wings. Fyi This is PORK. Comes with toast and 2 eggs how you like. Crispy fried pork cutlet with a ladling of gravy on top. Empty plate in 4minutes. 

6. side order Biscuits&Gravy ($3.99): 4 biscuits smothered in a ton of gravy. This is a dinner plate of biscuits and gravy. 
7. side order Bacon ($2.99): 5 crispy bacon strips 
8. side order fries ($2.99): basket of thick cut fries. ""steak fries"" if you will. 

9. House Brewed Ellis Island ""light"" beer: 20oz of very cold, very refreshing beer.",K8byELF3mfZxbVA_FPVo9w,8,6,5,AxjkoKMdd29pXZofjYj49g

Often times we'll go in w/ a group of 8-10 and every single one of us will order the same exact thing: steak and eggs. We found out about this place after a drunken night at some club. We were looking for some cheap steak and eggs, they got good reviews, so we gave it a shot. Back then it cost $6 or $7 if you stumbled in early enough. That deal may still exist, but I'm not sure. As of late, I haven't gone early enough and I haven't seen any signs advertising it.

It's a pretty basic steak and eggs meal. Decent steak, nothing special, however they are pretty good about cooking it how you want it. I can't stand when I order a steak and it's not cooked to how I ordered it. You also get a side of homestyle potatoes, which are pretty good, and your choice of toast (white, wheat, sourdough were the options IIRC). 

One of my friends ordered the country fried steak the last time we went. That thing was absolutely massive, unfortunately, it was super salty. She was trying to get us all to help her out, but I couldn't stomach more than one bite.

I was surprised to arrive with a 45 minute wait on a Saturday night since this was not exactly the prettiest place in town.  It's a cafe with a lot of casually dressed, possibly older crowd.    

While not on par with Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, or Morton's by any means, for this price point, I would say the prime rib was pretty damn good and tender too.  They said it was only 12 oz, but I've worked at a steakhouse and it looked more like 16 oz to me.  It  was a big cut of prime rib for sure!  If you're super hungry they have a double cut of 24 oz for $26.99!  It comes with your choice of salad or soup, sauteed garlic green beans, and a baked potato, fries, or mashed potatoes.  I opted for double green beans.  I was so full from this meal I could barely eat the next day.  My brother got a steak and eggs for only $10.49 which is also good, and the rest of our party got the prime rib dinner and could barely finish, so being the garbage disposal that I am, ate part of their steak.   I definitely hit my protein macros for the day!  Katie, our server, was super quick and on top of it, knowing that we were on a time constraint and was unaware the wait would be so long.  She was incredible, so I'm not sure what these other people ragging on the service was talking about.  Everything came out in a timely manner.  The bill came out to $60 with tax.

They are known for steak and eggs which I got. My steak was medium and came out pretty much perfect, very tender inside and still a bit red.

Even better, this is not a one-special, take-it-or-leave-it place like many on the strip.  Many other meals are reasonably priced - more than we could sample, actually.

The extra half for the root beer) service: our server was friendly enough but messed up the check 3 times... And still didn't get it right (2 stars) value: not as good a value on the price as before,  service could use some work (2 starred review). 

FYI -  they must have recently raised their prices on the 8oz steak and eggs deal. There was a sign in front of the Cafe that lists it as now $6.99. 

So I was hankering for prime rib without the exorbitant price tag.  We decided to hit Ellis Island for some eats after the good reviews/pics on Yelp. As their top sirloin steak special is listed perennially on Las Vegas advisor as one of the top 10 deals in Vegas,  we thought we could check it as well. This joint is no secret from the locals who frequent this place. At 11am on a Sunday,  there was a half hour wait for a table of 2.

Just FYI -  the steak special with 20 oz Ellis Island craft brew is $9.99 with their players card. (It isn't $8.99 like the signs say in the hotel) If you play $5, you will receive $2 off this deal. You have to redeem both these coupons at one of the player card kiosks. 

Also,  despite what their website says,  they also raised the price of the prime rib dinner to $14.99 from $13.99.

Both the steak special and the King cut prime rib special comes with green beans,  choice of potato/rice, soup/salad and a choice of their Ellis Island craft beer or root beer. 

The highlight of the meal was the root beer. Creamy with a hint of spiciness, it was pretty wonderful and I would not hesitate to get it again. 

After that, our side salads arrived at the table which were pretty generic. It was basically iceberg salad from a bag with a tomato on top with really cheap croutons. Not something you would order on its own  but because it comes with a meal,  it's okay. For a side salad, it was a pretty good portion. 

Next came our main entrées.  My prime rib,  ordered medium rare, came out medium well. Being as hungry as I was, I just ate it. It tasted not bad for the price with some minor fat and bits of gristle. It just isn't a superlative experience. The portion size was respectable (like a regular cut of prime rib) but certainly not a super large portion as suggested by the ""king"" cut moniker they use. The meat comes with horseradish and au jus. 

The hubs' top sirloin steak special fared a bit better although the cut was a bit too lean(didn't melt in your mouth). It was done to a perfect medium rare with a bit of charred flavor from the grill. 

The green beans were a bit overdone and stringy but adequately seasoned with a good amount of garlic. The baked potato was okay and large but lacked the perfect golden crispy skin. 

If it were only the food,  I would give this place a fair 3.5 stars with the half star bump up purely from the awesome root beer. However service was spotty at best and I think it had more to do with our server. 

Although friendly enough, she forgot things - like the waters we asked for. After we got our food,  she checked in with us once and then we didn't see her for a while. Finally,  it took 20+ minutes to get our check done incorrectly. It took her 3 corrections and she still didn't get it right (she forgot our coupons, then she didn't put all of them in, then she forgot to take off the charge for root beers which is included in the price of the meal). She did some sort of correction where the fees for the root beer were waived but we still paid tax on them... Even though the meal price included the root beer! At 25 minutes in, we weren't going to argue about it. But it is largely the principal of the matter that was bothersome. 

Overall,  the food is okay but the service needs to be better. Is it worth a half an hour wait and 20+ minutes of messed up checks? Not so sure. If you consider that Station Casinos offers prime rib buffets for $16.99 on weekends, the price for the prime rib dinner is not so great (after experiencing the lackluster salad bar and cooked veggies at Feast buffet this week, it still beat the side salad/veggies offered here hands down). The price of the steak dinner however is a decent deal only if you get the aforementioned coupons. Given this experience, I give this place a 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,1,2,VeNzQFpxebpSgsVAvpHdaw

For me, it's not really a complete Vegas trip anymore if I don't make that stop here at Ellis Island Cafe for some of their yummy food. It's kind of a tradition now. I haven't been eating meat lately, so I tried their penne pasta, and grilled cheese this time. The pasta was pretty good, better than expected. Creamy, cheesy and delicious! Their grilled cheese wasn't a joke either, it was extremely toasty, and flakey. Mmmmmmmm. I did wish the cheese was more melt in your mouth, but overall it still didn't disappoint!! I was spending forever and a day looking for it on the menu, but couldn't find it. No worries though, the servers will be able to punch it in on the register! Also, I don't know if they still do their $5 steak and eggs combo, I think it's 8.99 now! But that's still a steal!!

Overall, you still can't beat a budget meal here! Great for after the clubs too!! Definitely a step up from the chain diners (IHOP, Denny's, etc) The service may be a little slower... but well worth it!

TIP: They don't do take out so if you plan to order, you'll have to be seated, order then ask for boxes... They aren't stingy with their sauces though! Pretty awesome, they let us take whatever we needed for our food!",1-2Oed3A3J2lzLnRp12FWw,1,1,4,SGu8AR-UK0Lx4QHyH_zypw

The Ellis Island Cafe happens to meet a sweet spot in the above dilemma. Their wait times to get in are usually 45 minutes to an hour, but after a few turns of nearby slot machines and a beer, your number is usually called.

Be nice to the staff because they like regulars. I've even brought groups of friends to eat here, they seemed to like the pub atmosphere.

Beer is made on-site, is cold and competitively priced. The food is decent enough and the steaks are pretty good. I really like the thick cut steak fries and the soups are tasty.

We both ordered the steak and eggs platter and my mom wasn't pleased with her meal. She stated her eggs tasted like powder eggs and she couldn't eat them. She enjoyed her steak and mostly ate that with her potatoes. Initially she wasn't pleased with how red the steak was when we both requested well done. However, the steak was tender and nicely seasoned. I enjoyed my eggs, steak and potatoes.

My family and I came here for a late lunch and this place was empty. I was quite surprised, considering it was a Sunday afternoon and especially after reading that it can be a long wait.

We started with apps and ordered the jumbo onion rings and fried pickles. O-rings were average, but oh my god, I loved their take on fried pickles! Not your typical sliced dill pickles, but a whole spear coated in batter and fried to golden brown perfection. 

Three pieces of Icelandic cod dipped in beer batter and served with a basket of steak fries for just $9.99- It was good, but not the best, and certainly does not deserve the title for the best fish and chips in Las Vegas. The cod was tough and the beer batter was good in flavor, but did not maintain its crisp. It was extremely oily and soggy, the batter falling off with each bite.

Like other typical casinos, we had to wait about 30 minutes before being seated.

2741683,2013-09-30,7,dn51F67VLgPuqy_8SFk9oA,"Ellis Island Café is probably one of Vegas's best kept secrets. Located in the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery, this place has some good eats at decent prices. I like how they have the vibrating tablets they give you if there is a wait so you can go about the casino and hit up a slot machine or just people watch.

If its your first time here, I recommend getting a player card so you can get all the perks that come with it like the 8.99 steak special. You get a fat juicy sirloin steak cooked to order (I suggest you get it medium rare) green beans, and your choice of mashed potatoes, baked potato, rice pilaf, or fries. You also have a choice of salad or soup. Lastly, it also comes with a your choice of beer or root beer. This price applies to all people in your party. For 8.99 that's a very good deal. Just make sure to go to the players kiosk towards the left of the café to print out your 8.99 voucher.

They also have great breakfast specials. So for you drinkers, the steak n egg special is great for hangovers. Did I mention these guys are 24 hours? Yup. Nothing better than a decent steak at 2 or 3 in the morning. 

As for the atmosphere, I thought it was very roomy. Plenty of tables and booths. The lighting is bit low but bright enough to notice your surroundings so it gives you that date night type of setting. 

Service was pretty good. I was already gonna use my 8.99 steak meal voucher when the waiter noticed I also had a dollar off voucher next to it. He proceeded to tell me I can use it in conjunction with the 8.99 voucher. Wow. I assumed you couldn't use two vouchers together but after going over it, there was not anything that said you couldn't. Props to our waiter for that. I should of got his name so he can get recognition. Next time I go I will look for him.

Where they are situated I think is in a very good location. They are literally a few blocks away from the strip so its walking distance from a lot of the major casinos. So whenever you drive by this place and not even think twice about it, check it out, im glad I did or I would have never known about the great specials.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,12,7,4,1iGaz5zgqlJlU30uiOXa4Q

But it was impossible to scrape enough of it off.  It totally overpowered the steak.  The steak was just to weak to defend itself.  Two or three bites and I was finished with it.

The breakfast potatoes tasted old.  Very old.  And bad.  Like even when they were fresh, they still would've been bad.  They looked good, but they tasted like cooking oil.  Couldn't eat them.

I ordered my eggs poached, soft.  They were OK.  The toast was barely toasted at all.  More like warmed bread than toast.

The side salad I wanted was to have the dressing on the side, which was not done. My salad was drowning in dressing. Ugh. The baked potato with the steak felt and looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last hour because it was hard on top. The NY steak was tough. The fried chicken was dry and because it wasn't drained properly after frying, all the grease was soaked up by the steak fries sitting underneath. That's disgusting to the say the least. The salmon was dry and also had the hallmark of being overcooked with a hard crust on top.

Sometimes the wait is bad but I think you can get on waiting lists from yelp now and also see how long the wait is before going, very cool improvement because not that long ago you had to be there to get on the waiting list. 
I haven't had to wait at all the last two times I went, last visit was a busy Friday night/ Saturday morning even. 

They've remodeled the restaurant and casino but they kept 'most' of the same great food. You (or one person in your crew) will need to get a players card and print a voucher to get the 'Steak Special' unlocked for anyone that wants it. I think they took away the Ellis Island Chicken meal I use to get often so maybe other changes. They renamed the chicken meal once but was told it's no longer available awhile back but with all the continuous changes they may bring it back. 

I'll be back to for sure. Check them out, enjoy!",2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg,6,4,5,J3XHQ19UIxHAr8jJCbHNuA

We got here about 9am and were seated by the hostess of the restaurant. We ordered our food with a young lady (Asian). She was so sweet with us. She was very friendly, she talked to us about her daughter being a DJ in Vegas/San Diego.

Ellis Island is always the must stop hang over breakfast before heading out of Fabulous Las Vegas. They have steak and eggs specials and make your own omelets deals. The service is fast, friendly and I have never left disappointed.

They have an amazing steak and eggs deal here for $5.99 between 11PM and 11AM. It's great for any cheap late night/early morning cravings when you're in the city that never sleeps. 

Ellis Island Cafe is located in ... you guessed it! Ellis Island Casino and Brewery. The place is definitely a bit run down and it definitely shows. It's a fairly small casino which is found near the corner of Koval Ln. and Flamingo Rd. 

Inside the casino, Ellis Island Cafe is just called ""Cafe"". The $5.99 special isn't really advertised on the menu, except written on a small chalk board by the hostess. 

I'm definitely a huge fan of the steak and eggs here (which you can probably already tell). The steak is definitely delicious (however don't be expecting quality compared to Gordon Ramsay Steak). They also serve potato cubes instead of hash browns which I absolutely enjoy. 

The service here can be a bit slow at times, and is a ""hit or miss"". I've came here and had some of the best service ever, as well as waiters that never came back to help us.

Let's just say that it wasn't my idea to come here in the first place but a friend of mine suggested it after we left a concert. I am all for giving places the benefit of doubt so with that being said I agreed! Let's talk about service and how it's completely non existent in this place. I believed we arrived maybe around 2:00 AM seated quickly but that's when the problems started. Our server this morning was JOEY and wow what a smart ass he was. I didn't appreciate his service at ALL. Our table had questions on the menu and he just had this nonchalant ass attitude with us and thought that it was funny. I specifically had my issue with him because I decided on the Italian style omelet and inquired about having it made with egg whites. I asked him if it was possible and he says of course but it will be a charge ranging from maybe $2-4? I'm thinking to myself how don't you know the FIRM ACTUAL up charge on this but whatever he checked with the source whomever that was and confirmed it was $2. You are the server so know your menu! I said that's no problem at all go ahead and order it! When our food came everybody's plate came correct but mine. Want to guess what didn't get done? Yep! My omelet came full of cholesterol and yellow as ever! It was clear that my simple request didn't get put in because he was to busy being so damn condescending. We brought this to his attention right away and he brought me a small plate to scoop my plate of potatoes on and the says ""well do you want me to have them make it over"" DUH wtf? After about 20 minutes I had finished my side order of pancakes and some of my friends plate because she felt bad that I still hadn't received my order. Another person in our party didn't et her wheat toast that came with her meal and had asked 3 times for it! Just a complete train wreck he was unapologetic for all this and then when our bill came we had a random 6oz New York steak and eggs added to our bill and I was double charged for my omelette. When again we brought this to his attention he says oh only the manager can fix this hold on, took the bill and went missing! After waiting about 10-15 minutes we still haven't got our correct bill so we spotted the manager TRICIA who was behind the scenes flagged her down and said can we get this done asap?! Her response was somewhat like she cared and when I pulled her to the side to let her know the unacceptable behavior from her serve JOEY and the lack of hospitality she apologized. Did nothing about the bill though they made sure they still collected them coins! Won't be back that's for sure!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,3,1,1,mbnPQ2AqCnsbQ96VZb38ug

My girlfriend and two of our friends went here on a Sunday night. Now it wasn't horribly busy but it wasn't empty either. We get to our table and our waiter gets us our drinks. We all order appetizers, soups/salads and our meals. So far so good. A few minutes later, we all could use a refill of our drinks. Our waiter has disappeared and it looks like the other waiters are busy. We are brought soups/salads but no appetizer. Given the portion size, I actually didn't mind not receiving the appetizer. Asked our waiter for a refill of our drinks and he just nods his heads. We don't ever see a refill. Our meals then shortly came out and once again we asked for a refill of our drinks. Waiter nods his head, and still no refills and no sign of our waiter thereafter. This is getting ridiculous. 

The food was amazing! Definitely made up for the lack of service we were receiving. We finish our meals and this is where Ellis Islas cafe goes downhill. So we get our check and notice we were charged for the appetizers we never received. So we grab another waiter to get our waiter. Our waiter reluctantly comes out and we tell him that there was a mistake with our check. He looks at it and says sorry he will correct it. We also insist we  speak with a manager/supervisor. He agrees to get him for us and then says ""oh would you guys like refills?"" ....we have only asked for refills a few times already and never received them.

We wait 15 minutes, manager doesn't show so we ask again. Another 15 minutes pass and he finally shows up but doesn't come to our table. He talks with our waiter, looks at us, and then rolls his eyes and whispers something to the waiter and walks away. So now we get our new tab and it shows $5 off with the appetizers we never received still on the tab. So once again we ask our waiter to please have the manager talk to us so we can get this straightened out. We never got to talk with the manager but finally after another 20 minutes, the problem got fixed.

I really did enjoy the food especially for the prices. However, the service was a little less than desired and almost makes me hesitant to come back.",7x1cQIVrFWbGhDzZUFgDiA,1,0,3,4uzzn-MyEIGLItRnsKJj4Q

My brother's, however, was nice and bloody (he, too, had ordered medium rare). It's crazy the two steaks could differ so much.

I got tired of wrestling with my steak, that after eating about half of it, I gave it to my brother. I think maybe next time i'll get their prime rib instead (if there is a next time).

Tucked away in the smokey corner of Ellis Island is the cafe which serves up one of the best steak deals in Vegas. Its sort of a poorly kept secret but for 8.99 you get a great cut of steak with all of the fixings, a house salad, and a microbrew or house root beer.  Most places featuring steak specials serve up a thin fatty NY strip but not Ellis. The steak is lean thick cut, pretty surprising for the price. The cafe also features daily specials, steak n eggs and a few other standard offerings. 

One of the best things about Ellis Island is that they feature their own microbrewery. They have about 5 different beers brewed on location for around $2 bucks. You get a 22oz draft with your meal or you can trade it in for a fresh root beer. The 'hefe-weiss' I had was refreshing and tasty, no IPA though =(. 

In order to get the special at the cafe you have to sign up for the players card which isn't a big deal.

The menu is simple and is only comprised of a front and back of a menu. It's filled with simple American dishes that can fit nearly anyone's taste. The items on the menu are relatively cheap compared to other restaurants out there now, and so I couldn't argue with the prices. My recent visit, I got the chicken parmesan while my mom got the salmon. Both items came with a salad. I would recommend asking for dressing in the side because it was just globbed on my salad and it was a lot just concentrated in the middle, so that wasn't fun. The chicken parmesan was quite delicious. The pasta was cooked well, the chicken was delicious, and the garlic bread was good. My mom's salmon wasn't as lucky, for it was a little dry and the green beans that it came with weren't that great. 

The service really sucked when we went. It was understaffed for dinner and the place was almost completely full. When I had a general question that anyone in the restaurant could answer, I tried to ask someone who wasn't my server and he rudely told me that he wasn't my server and he can't help me. That's a no-no in my book. 

Their food is cheap and you can get lucky or unlucky depending on what you order. Try not to go during peak hours and the service will be more than adequate.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,1,0,3,FegBGGI-4qWrAG93FB9EWg

No crackheads and homeless camping out for $$, just nice people (clients and staff). Slight wait to not oversell the kitchen (about 20 minutes at 10 am on Saturday). 

Had two eggs, NY Strip - cooked perfectly I might add, and better flavor than an $18 Ribeye from Chili's!, wheat toast and fried potatoes - $5.99!!!! Saw where they were voted best breakfast in Vegas in 2014! Cannot disagree. Easy parking and a nice small casino and sports betting area. I really feel like I've found a gem in Vegas!

Her green beans were stone cold, as were the onion rings that I had ordered with my fish instead of the 'chips'. So, when I was able to finally flag down the waiter we asked for replacements, which we promptly got. One of the onion rings still had the onion skin on it, and the rest was just blah, nothing special, or overcooked- again. When we finally flagged the waiter, we asked for the manager- she came over and just made excuses, no apologies at all. She did say she would adjust our ticket, which she did begrudgingly.

Wait wasn't long on a Sunday night. Server took our orders very quickly. I ordered the NY Steak and Shrimp / mashed potatoes / with a cup of chicken noodle soup while my Fiancee ordered the Prime Rib / baked potato / with a side salad. 

They were definitely not going slow tonight. A minute after we got our appetizers, our entrees appeared. Never thought I would get all my food TOO soon but that was the case. The appetizers were fine. The chicken noodle soup had some good chunks of chicken in it. Side salad was simple, can't complain.

Main dishes. Both steaks were cooked medium rare like we asked for. That was impressive as many places get that wrong. The NY steak was decent, just needed a little salt and pepper. The mashed potatoes were very bland. Not much went into spicing it up at all. The shrimp were not very good. It was mostly breading and the breading was greasy. I envisioned something a little fresher. Homemade cocktail sauce was just as bad. No flavor and I highly doubt there was any horseradish in there.

The prime rib is the way to go to order. This prime rib won't be the best prime rib ever, but you feel like you got your money's worth. You are going to have to work for your meat a bit as this cut had a lot of gristle. Again, this needed just a little salt and pepper to get the flavor going. Once you hit the meat, you'll be having a good time. The baked potato was just that, a baked potato. Nothing fancy. Green beans were a nice touch and you had plenty to it. 

A fool would go to this cafe and NOT order any beers. Ellis Island has it's own brewery and their draft beer is $2.50 a pop. $2.50! The amber ale was my favorite. It helped wash down bad shrimp.

I went with the steak and egg breakfast which was priced at a locals rate. The steak was cooked perfectly and was generously sized, tender and included potatoes, toast and two eggs.

He forgot my boyfriends beer after he went through the whole process if checking the ID. his excuse was that he forgot to write it down. Food took forever but it was busy so I will give them that. But nobody came to check on us at all. The food was good and I think that is why they are so rude. Because by the time you get your food your so hungry and its so good that you can't really complain.

Of course! They're scarfing down on some good ol' American grub at Ellis Island Cafe. Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week AND they offer THE best steak and eggs special that Vegas has. For $5.99?! You better bet your bottom dollar that's right!

I thought Mr. Lucky's was a done deal but boy was I wrong. Ellis Island Cafe is where it's at. It's a little off the strip on Koval and Flamingo and it's located inside the Ellis Island Casino. This place is perfect for a 3 am grub session after hitting those crazy clubs all night or even just for a plain and simple breakfast at 8 am. All-in-all you just can't beat those prices AND portions.

I've been here a couple times and I ALWAYS get the $5.99 steak and eggs special. It's not included in the menu but it's usually written on their chalkboard sign by the front of the cafe. The special comes with 2 eggs (any way you want it), 6 oz. sirloin steak (cooked any way you want it), home fries and toast. The portions are perfect and I never had a problem with the chefs over or under-cooking the meat. Plus, those home fries are so deliciously crisp and well-seasoned. For $5.99 what's to complain about?

SIDE NOTE: the special is only from 11 pm to 11 am. Other than that, everything is great! 

So please stop by this place whenever you're in Vegas. If you're going to spend $80 on drinks at the Marquee or Tao, might as well treat yourself to the tastiest, cheapest breakfast they got.",Wz9LLd-P8UDNFNqxKuz1gg,6,3,5,Mmv06Y_uWD_asYYdLaDeUQ

4240979,2012-10-01,11,dn51F67VLgPuqy_8SFk9oA,"Ellis Island is a local dive that's been around FOREVER, and they're mostly known for their karaoke. I used to hang out there back in the day when I worked at the MGM (because they used to let casino employees drink FOR FREE (!!!!! Can you imagine!!!! I can't believe I didn't get a DUI until 2010.) 

Then for awhile, there was talk of imploding poor old Ellis Island for another douchey high-rise condo tower -- which thankfully, a little something called the Recession put the kibosh to! So Ellis Island still squats in squalor, in the shadow of the Strip (it's on Koval Lane, for all you non-locals...check it out!).

Either way, I'm here to tell you that the cafe here has an AMAZING steak special -- around $8 or so for a big-ass (8 oz or so) filet, with salad, green beans and a baked potato. PLUS a beer is included...but I hate beer, so I had a glass of wine (which cost extra, but not much). I thought the $7.77 steak special at Mr. Lucky's in the Hard Rock was good (and it really is)...but if you like beer, Ellis Island is the better deal. (But if you like fake tits and poseurs, then Hard Rock is the better deal for you.)

Aside from the steak special, they also serve typical Vegas cafe fare: breakfast, sandwiches, chicken-fried strippertits, etc. Something for everyone.

One caveat: every cheapass in town comes here, so if you go at regular mealtimes, there can be quite a wait. My advice is to do like me: sleep til noon, drink black coffee and bitch about stuff online til 5, hit the gym/go to work/run errands (whatever you have to do that particular day) til about 10...then head to Ellis for dinner at 11.

This place is right off the Strip, on the main road behind Bally's. It was probably a fun hot spot back in the day, but now people only want to bother with what's currently hot. The restaurant is right up front when you walk in. There was a short wait since it's plenty busy, even on a Monday night. 

The restaurant decor could be best described as ancient and dated, resembling a relic from a bygone era no one cared to update. but why fake it here, right? This building is a relic, and even if the walls show signs of being redone three or four times over it still looks like somewhere my grandparents would eat. 

We both wanted the same thing - prime rib, served with a baked potato and green beans. And, best of all, a 20 oz. stein of beer. All for $13.99. That rules so hard. 

The prime rib was really great, cooked to a perfect medium rare and so soft and succulent. Each piece melted upon entering my mouth. My only complaint is that they use creamy horseradish instead of the real deal good stuff. Potato and beans were both great, too. The green beans weren't even overcooked. 

They brew all of their own beer here, and they've got all varieties covered. I went with their hefeweizen, which was unremarkable but tasted just like a good hef should.

Ellis Island Cafe is off the beaten Vegas strip, only a block or two away, but is definitely worth checking out. 

The food in Vegas is pricey whereas fabulous shows are comparatively cheaper than what you'll find in places like NYC. Years ago, the opposite was true. The shows are amazing so if you're going to spend money in Vegas, I would suggest spending it on the shows, not the food (or more precisely, the restaurant overhead).

To qualify my review, I've been to Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in the Paris Hotel, and Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. All are 4+ star restaurants and have some great food but so does Ellis Island Cafe although you'll find it at a fraction of the price. The difference is you're not paying for expensive overhead, or handsome servers with British accents.

Ellis Island Cafe is a family restaurant with a Casino (of course) attached to it and the area might seem a bit sketchy but you are in Vegas, remember, and I'm sure you've seen sketchy if you've spent even a minute on the strip. 

No worries, once inside you'll feel like you've entered a time machine. Burgundy colored pleather high-back booths and antiquish framed artwork adorn the dark wood paneling on the walls. If you can get past that, you're well on your way to a delicious, satisfying meal at a very reasonable price.

Of course - don't expect a five Michelin Star dining experience. We're talking about a low end Casino restaurant. However adjusting our expectations to this venue, here's the scoop.

1. Before you go, sign up - via internet - for the Ellis Island players club card. (It's free) This gets you $4 off the already low price, $10 free chips to play, and a free beer with your meal.

2. DONT stand in line to eat at the Cafe. Either; eat in the BBQ cafe (cheaper and good, no wait) or ask to eat in the bar. (Same food, no wait)

3. Place is dark, dimly lit. Smells like a college bar. (Deal with it)

That said:  The steak special is a good value for the price.

A good 8 oz. boneless filet, perfectly char broiled. A good baked potato with butter / sour cream. Pretty good green beans. (Not canned) A descent bowl of soup. (Clam chowder when I visited) plus a pint of house brewed beer.  All for less than $10.

I've been doing cheap-ass breakfasts at Ellis Island since my first trip to Las Vegas over a decade ago, and still find myself inexplicably drawn there each time I'm in town.

Seating is comfortable, with both table and booth options available. Best of all, a solo diner like myself can get lost among the patrons, though still noticed by the attentive eyes of the wait staff, who have long been one of this establishment's strengths. The waitresses have good chemistry and camaraderie, helping each other out to cover a busy floor filled with breakfast bargain-shoppers. 

My favorite item is their Country Fried Steak breakfast platter, featuring a deep-fried breaded pork chop smothered in a bechamel-based southern breakfast gravy, 2 eggs done to my preference, 2 slices of pre-buttered toast, and a hefty helping of home fried potatoes with onions and peppers. All of this comes to the table for $7.99 and is so filling that it takes care of both breakfast and lunch, and compels me to need a late dinner.

I also occasionally order one of their 3-egg omelets ($6.99), my preference being to have them filled with ham and covered with melted slices of both American cheese and Monterey Jack cheese. Omelets also come with the home fried potatoes and buttered toast.

Each table has a bottle of A1 Steak Sauce -- as if Ellis Island is daring you to try their 10oz New York Strip Steak with 2 Eggs, Potatoes, and Toast for $11.99. I've had this in the not-too-distant past when Ellis Island was more under the radar and you could get a surprisingly-decent steak and egg breakfast for $5 if you showed up early enough in the morning. Alas, those days are gone.

For better or worse, Ellis Island has grown up, and so have I. Although I won't have breakfast here every day for a week like in my younger days of visiting the city, I will still dine at Ellis Island a couple of times each visit -- it is the esteemed old friend who reminds me of how I vacationed in Vegas before spendy chef-driven outposts started popping up all over the strip.

The waiter came up after us waiting for 15ish minutes and just said are you ready. Then proceeded to look at us crazy when we did not have our side items fully memorized during the order.  He never asked us if we wanted their delicious root beer (which I saw advertised on the wall 10 minutes after my order). 

Our food was delivered and it was very good and worthy of 5 stars. But because we finished without a pass by from the waiter to refill our water we ended up just leaving what we thought the bill should total in cash on the table with a little buffer.

The country fried steak is ginormous!!! Potato O Brian, eggs and a huge chicken fried steak with gravy. It was a little bready then most, but definitely will not disappoint your appetite. 

The NY steak with eggs was a little dry, which was cooked medium, is decent. I personally didn't have it but my friend gave me his view most of the meals come with toast which was nicely buttered! Yum!

Recently I decided perhaps I would try their much raved about cheap and yummy breakfast served at their cafe with my sister in tow. She was staying at The Signature at MGM so Ellis Island was very close by.

When we arrived the cafe was busy. Not busy enough for us to not be seated quickly though. Our waitress came by and we were ready to order. There's not much to the breakfast menu, so you don't have a lot to mull over. I ordered the Denver omelet and my sister ordered the french toast with bacon. The prices are quite cheap, but not dirt cheap.

The wait wasn't long. Our food arrived rather quickly considering how many people there were in the place. My food was placed in front of me and I knew then why the food was that quick. I realize a Denver omelet isn't a gourmet meal, but mine looked meh. The green peppers were diced very small. The ham looked as though it had definitely come packaged and sliced into small bits. It tasted meh and it was a bit hard for my tastes. It certainly wasn't a nice, fluffy, soft omelet. The potatoes on the side were overcooked, but okay - nothing special. 

My sister didn't feel good by the time our food came out, so she didn't eat her french toast. I'm not sure if it was good or not. Since we had to retreat quickly since she wasn't feeling well I was able to flag down the server quickly and get our reciept. I think she sensed our urgency and was quick about it, so at least that was nice of her. 

The service, to me, was better than the food. Maybe I'll just stick to karaoke here and the beer and Metro Pizza every once and awhile.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,3,zkRkI7WlkFEGx4wIJ-uDjQ

The most popular entree is steak and eggs for $6.99. Friend ordered his steak medium rare and eggs sunny side up, which also came with 4 pieces of bread. They were all apparently delicious.

Everyone comes here for that. Ellis has the best steak and eggs in town! Nowhere else compares to their steak and eggs. The steak is a good, non-cheap quality piece of meat. It's tender, not dry. Eggs are eggs, not really hard to mess up. Unlike most other places, the hash browns are little chunks instead of the traditional kind. I actually really don't like the traditional hash browns. Ellis Island has a crispy outside and soft inside potato cubes. I LOVE IT! I wipe out the potatoes every time I'm here whereas I would hardly even touch the hash browns at another restaurant. 

My usual choice is steak medium, eggs over easy, and white toast. However, I think I'll switch over to sourdough my next visit.

I had looked up Ellis Island on the Internet before we left and it was about 1/3 of a mile from the Flamingo, where we were staying, Ellis is a little off the Strip, but felt perfectly safe.  It is located next to a 7-11, so if you want to pick up a beer on the way back to the Strip, it makes it easy.

Ellis has a morning steak and eggs special with home-style potatoes and 2 slices of toast. A heck of a deal, and the steak is actually really good and the eggs I got were a perfect sunny side up. Not too runny. 

Ellis also brews their own beer, I got the IPA every time, plus you get a huge pilsner glass of it for $2.25. They also have a light, a stout, an amber and a hefeweizen.  Plus they have To-go cups. Score!

We ate here about 4 times, but it was too late for the breakfast special so I got the chicken Phillie hoagie, again, really well made. Lots of flavorful onions and peppers with juicy chicken and I got a $3 side salad with blue cheese, which hit the spot.

Our service was fantastic every time. We even had the same waitress three times. 

This place is a solid five star for what it is. Old school Vegas eating with quality food and cheap prices.  I usually got the breakfast special and 2 beers, and with tip it ran about $12 every time!

Each time we went at night, it was a 40 minute wait to get seated, so Ellis also has a pizza place and an awesome hoagie shop, both were very good back up plans!

   Sometimes I wonder if they call Las Vegas Boulevard the Strip because the inflated prices of the restaurants strip your wallet. Maybe I am exaggerating but the prices are high. Take the Nathan's in the Bally's food court. A fast food hot dog, medium drink, and fries is around $17. A block east of the Bally's food court Nathan's is the Ellis Island Cafe where you can have a chicken parmesain with pasta and marinara sauce dinner including cup of soup or salad plus beverage for less than $15. This was the kind of deal I appreciate when I am on the Las Vegas Strip. 

   Ellis Island Cafe is one of those restaurants where locals and tourists mingle. It really is a short walk along the south sidewalk of Flamingo Road from the Bally's food court doors into the Ellis Island doors. The upshot is there are a sundry of tourists sharing the full service cafe with the locals. Being a local, the restaurant is familiar. Ellis Island Cafe is the flagship of the Village Pub chain that is a popular restaurant /casino lounge chain across the valley. Although I was dining in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, I was truly in a Village Pub. 

   There were two omens that Ellis Island Cafe is a great deal. The first omen is ""People love us on Yelp"" and the second omen is the hour wait. Upon placing my name, the friendly woman at the podium informed me that there was an hour wait when she presented me with a beeper. I was free to roam the smoky casino or enjoy an Ellis Island draft beer at the bar. After tiring of walking the second hand smoke clogged casino, I took to waiting on one of the comfortable plush benches in the dimly lit restaurant. 

   If I wasn't decided on the chicken parmesain, there was so many choices to choose from. If it were any day instead of Saturday, there was a weekday special. And this was one major difference from the Village Pub. I recall the Village Pub offering a prime rib special on Saturday. Then again I could of opted for a steak special or several deals on the sprawling menu that I am sure included prime rib. Then again I could of ordered the delicious fish and chips, shrimp, or meatloaf that I have enjoyed at previous Village Pub visits. 

  Subsequential to the buzzer illuminating, I sat at a table in the dimly illuminated dining area. The waiter took my order. The waiter was a nice guy who volunteerily charged me for a coffee in lieu of a Coke to lower my check; however I would have liked to seen more of him. After placing the chicken parmesain on the table, if I'd seen him again I would have kindly asked for grated cheese because it does make pasta taste better. And I'd ask for a soda refill. From all my Village Pub there is usually a flaw with service. It reminds me of a Diner serving decent food at a reasonable price with a quirk in service. 

   For $9.99 off the Las Vegas Strip the food was a jackpot. We are talking chicken parmesain with pasta and soup for $9.99 that is a 777 a roll of the dice from the crossroads of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road. This time I had a cup of  cream of broccoli soup. Tasty and good! Last time I had salad with ranch dressing. Good! Both times the chicken parmesain topped with that melting cheese and delectable sauce complimented by pasta was satisfying and filling. 

   Just a roll of the dice away from Bally's value lives on at the Ellis Island Cafe. Thank you for taking the time to read this review. It's been a pleasure to share with you on Yelp the outstanding deals that Ellis Island Cafe offers in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,21,13,4,QsEi2eV4J-yt7PFSpZuz0A

We went on a Saturday morning and there was about a 10 minute wait but as we were going to our table we saw the crowd coming in so always expect a wait. The wait is definitely worth it though! My wife ordered the omelette and was impressed how they actually used real eggs instead of the carton eggs most restaurants use nowadays. I ordered the pancake breakfast and I have to say those were some of the best pancakes I've ever had they were really soft and fluffy. The guy at the next table ordered the Ham steak meal and let's just say..ill be going back to try that the next time!! Two meals that you will need to-go boxes and two drinks for $16?

I CAN recommend LOLA'S for genuine CAJUN food though! Anyhow, in my search for REAL bar-b-q, the reviews led me to try out ELLIS ISLAND a few days ago, even after reading that their ""bar-b-q"" ribs were ""steamed"" for 4 hours then flopped around on a grill for a few minutes (this is NOT ""BAR-B-Q."" by the way.).

 My wife and I arrived there just before 4pm Monday to beat the crowd. We signed up for the players cards to get the meal discounts and then were ""greeted"" by the hostess at the ""bar-b-q"" restaurant door who promptly told us there would be a ""wait"" even though there were only about 10 diners already seated in a dimly lit room that holds maybe 30. Almost immediately after telling us there ""will be a waiting time"", the hostess asked my 26 year old wife for her I.D. This less than attractive and unfriendly ""hostess"" seemed disappointed that my wife was in fact of ""legal"" age. I did tell my wife that this ""hostess was in the wrong business.""  We were waited on by a nice Philippino waiter named ""PHILLIP"". The advertised price for the full rack rib dinner was $12 and we ordered two of them. I placed my meal discount tickets on the table and they were collected by the waiter as we ordered our meals. We got the bill and it totaled $28.00. $33 including my tip. I wondered what kind of calculator they used to add up our bill because $12 + $12 = $24 on MY calculator! Yeah, the 8.1% tax drives the bill up to $26 but where did the other $2 come from? The meal was mediocre at best which makes me wonder what planet all these rave reviewers came from. Rather than quibble we just paid the tab and left, NEVER TO RETURN!

Those of you who want to experience ""REAL"" BAR-B-Q RIBS and are visiting the DALLAS area then drop by ""SLOW BONE"" on S. Irving Blvd. but be sure and get there before NOON coz the ribs are SOLD OUT by then!  The hours at SLOW BONE are 11am till 3pm!

The thing to have is Steak & Eggs and after 11pm I think it is a mere $5.99. The steak dinner is $11.99 or $8.99 with a coupon and includes a piece of filet mignon, green beans and a baked potato. A soup or salad accompanies.

French toast is only $3.99.

This is the place to come if you've lost all your winnings and only have a few bucks in your pocket and wanted some decent food.

I highly suggest ordering one of their home brews. I love the stout and at around $2.50 it is one of the best deals around. And it's delicious too.

THE Steak Special ($8.99) : Includes choice of house beer or root beer and side! 

This is THE best steak in town anywhere near its price point!  It's a thick 2in cut LEAN beast that you can eat end to end...no fat on it.

All the beers including the amazing root beer is made in house, and are stupid CHEAP...$2 for a tall.  This makes the Steak ONLY $7, and I'd eat this everyday before spending a Jackson at a Denny's or similar.  It's good enough to eat without steak sauce, and it was cooked perfectly last time I was here.

They make you use a PLAYER'S CARD to get the special now though, so make sure you print out your coupon for it while you're there!  Of course, it's free to sign up...my friend did it while we were waiting for our order to arrive to the table.

It's in the DIVE known as Ellis Island though, so make your way past all the smoke and poor karaoke vibrating through the walls, and eat your cheap a$$ steak and enjoy it!

The steak special has been synonymous with Vegas trips for us, so I am disappointed to write such a negative review. However, our most recent experience today was extraordinarily poor. We were seated and had our order taken like any other time. We asked for four cups of water prior to our order. We had to ask another three times before three of the four waters were finally brought. Then, we had to ask another 2x before our fourth cup of water finally arrived. Meanwhile, other tables around us received their orders of soft drinks and beer. 

We ordered an appetizer in addition to 4 steak specials. We received our salads in a timely manner, but proceeded to wait an hour and a half before we received our appetizer of shrimp cocktail. We started seeing every table around us get their food (some of whom ordered steak specials). When we asked our waiter about our order he said that our food was coming and that it wasn't his fault since he wasn't the one making the food. Irritated by the brush off we spoke to the manager who assured us she would rush our order, which she did since the steaks came out rare though we ordered medium. We asked for our check so we could leave and showed the waiter the rare meat. The waiter told us he would show the kitchen how much they messed up...the waiter gave us our check and once again blamed the kitchen for messing up and gave us a $5 adjustment to our bill and a free side order of onion rings. I spoke to the manager again as I was irritated with the waiters disposition on the matter. She informed me that she does not work with the waiter often, but has gotten multiple complaints about him today...she also made sure to note she did everything she could to make things right. We felt that the manager was trying to brush us off as well, and seemed at most mildly concerned with the poor service and undercooked food. I guess what was disappointing was the fact that she wanted to deflect the blame rather than take any actions to rectify the situation. 

We ultimately feel that the service was just plain poor. It was disappointing the lack of accountability taken and the lack of effort given to make amends for the ordeal. Furthermore, the waiter did not seem to want to take responsibility for his mistake and the manager only seemed to want to blame the waiter rather than make amends herself. I am disappointed that the cafe did not seem to care about providing such poor customer service and food quality.",HE3wW1BMJfaYgoLmL2TVHA,0,0,1,0tgD6Ykfu9Pu8PMc_YgKzg

Now mind you the steak here hasn't been aged for 6 year's in some type of sophisticated refrigerator nor are the cows given special diets or whatever.

Today, I came in to grab a late breakfast and paid a higher price 10.99 which didn't bother me, but I found that my server wasn't really on top of her game due to it being somewhat crowded but I tried to overlook it.

What bothered me is when I was given my check and I was informed that I would be paying her which is what I expected. I was sitting on my phone waiting for her to come back for at least ten minutes and I was going to leave her a 3 dollar tip in spite of the lackluster service ( tip would have been better, but I decided to leave a dollar instead as I decided to get up and pay the front instead. I ALMOST never tip so poorly and I am often chastised by my friends for being too generous, but frankly I was at the end of my rope.",DH33jk6JCu18bDttLCalRw,1,1,4,W7IZB9BvzcjNRi5gmz9itQ
5195243,2017-04-13,2,dn51F67VLgPuqy_8SFk9oA,"I have tried. I really have. Food is cheap. This is true. But it is so painfully obvious why. And the waitresses do not give a damn. They just don't. They have attitude. I'm in Vegas. I have money to spend here. I'm not in a tight budget. I did come because I had 100$ free play and 50$ food coupons. I like Ellis island table games. 

Let's put it this way. I was there 8 nights. I left Vegas still having a 25$ Ellis island food voucher because I'd rather pay $$ in Vegas for an experience of quality then have a free meal that sucked. 

The photos look MUCH better than they tasted. This is our second visit in 4 months. First time I didn't like it either.  Famous fish and chips. Well greasy soggy mess makes you famous ok. Hubby had Rueben sandwich. It too was soggy. It more edible then my fish. But I digress. 

This trip good free. I agreed to give it another shot for lunch. I ordered the club sandwich hubby the 50/50 burger. Supposed to be half ground bacon half hamburger meat. 

Ok. I'm from Texas. Maybe it is just here but I have never had a club salad or a club sandwich with NO cheese. Small thing right? It's a big deal on a sandwich like a club though. I asked about it and was told it was 2$ more. Nope wasn't gonna do it. At this point I was already irritated because I spent 4$ for a side salad that was lettuce and croutons. I asked for onions on it and they wanted 1$ for a slice of onion. My club sandwich wasn't toasted at all (see pics). Fries were good. 

Hubby's burger was ordered medium and came dry as the Sahara. No bacon flavor in the meat. It was an odd crumbly texture. The bacon should have added grease and flavor but it did not. It wasn't horrible bad but not good either. 

I'll never eat here again. Not because of the food. I'd probably try it again fir breakfast but the staff is terrible. The hostess (a blonde woman shoulder length hair 45-55 yrs old) was super sweet. We'd been seated in a section and waited and waited. No one bothered to greet us (this was after a 20 min wait for a table in a more than half empty restaurant, which I've never understood) we flagged her down and asked to switch sections which she kindly obliged. About 5 min later the waitress from that section came to our table to scold us. She said ""I told you I'd be right with you but you couldn't wait!"" I just stared at her. She never acknowledged us at all but whatever. Then she said ""well did you want to stay here or come back to my section?""  Shocked, I said no we'd stay here. So rude. Omgosh. Our waitress was ok. She was surely, brisk. Didn't smile. Wasn't friendly but efficient enough to earn her tip (we always tip 20%)

Anyway. Come. Eat. It's not going to kill you. It's cheap. It's ok. It's not great. The casino and workers are great. Don't come expecting more than a dennys type meal however. I did, and was disappointed.",UQ524fth4Sj6WVDnJODcYw,2,0,3,HMycH8vuIDgk4CZOwW8Z6A

Now, they want you to have a tracking device, I mean a players card (even if you don't gamble) just to get the steak special for $9.99. By the way, that does not include the homemade Rootbeer, which will run you an additional $2.50. 

As a Las Vegas local, I am outraged! I'm aware that I sound very frugal...because I am!!! If I were at an upscale steakhouse, with a nice atmosphere and attentive servers, this same meal would cost me at least $80, but the Ellis Island Cafe is a hole in the wall. 

In regards to their service, it was my servers second day on the job (I'll cut her some slack because she was a sweetheart),however, it was Christmas and the restaurant was slammed. Why would management do that to their employee? I guess they believe in baptism by fire.  Our server forgot to bring our salads, so they arrived well after we received our entrees.

I am not a fan of runny eggs so I asked that they make sure the eggs were done, again was told absolutely no problem. Our breakfast arrived quickly and our waitress had been attentive, so far so good! I cut into my omelet and runny egg spread over my plate.

On December 21, 2016, my wife and I decided to have breakfast at the Ellis Island Café located on Koval Lane in Las Vegas. The café is within a walking distance from The LINQ Hotel where we were staying and is open 24/7. We decided to drive there and that took us less than 5 minutes. We arrived there around 7:30 a.m. The parking lot in front of the café was full so we had to park in an adjacent lot and walk towards the café. Should have walked from the hotel and get our daily exercise. We were immediately seated in a booth.

My wife had the ""Two Eggs Any Style, $3.99."" This plate consists of two eggs any style served with Potatoes O'Brian. I had the ""Ham Steak & Eggs, $7.99."" This plate consists of grilled slice of bone-in ham steak served with two eggs and Potatoes O'Brian. Each plate comes with two slices of toast. Both meals were prepared to our perfection and they tasted great. Both of us enjoyed our breakfast at Ellis Island Café.

Our waitress was very nice and her services were perfect. The water and coffee cups were promptly filled.

In summation, the food was good for the price, parking was not as I would have expected, but the service was good. If we find ourselves in Las Vegas again, Ellis Island Café is a good choice.

I think I would order medium rare next time as it was cooked more than I'd like towards the ends. I heard later on from cousins that frequent the place for this same special that they always order down as they tend to slightly overcook their steaks. Duly noted. But my meal was enjoyable nonetheless. The steak hit the spot. I enjoyed it with the provided A1 sauce. The country potatoes were fried crispy and were just the way I like it. Perfect with some ketchup. The toast was super buttered and I enjoyed it with my runny eggs. I was tempted to put some strawberry Smuckers on it as they had some on the table but it was great the way it was. I must say, they put a lot of butter on their toast.

It's most famous offering is a steak and eggs special for $5.99 available between 11 pm. and 11 am. which surprisingly I've never had it in all my visits here as I've generally come during peak dinner hours.

I've always found them to be packed and have had to wait about 40 minutes before getting a table. A good thing is that they give you a token that lights up and beeps when your table is ready so you can roam around the casino and play rather than hang around waiting at the Café.

Over a couple of visits I've tried a bunch of their house specials. During my first visit I got a King Cut Prime Rib ($13.99) and asked for it to be done medium, but what I got was too rare for my taste. The cut of beef also had a lot of fat so I did not like this very much. During subsequent visits I've tried their Chicken Fried Steak ($8.99) which was pretty good but the gravy was a let down, the Wild Alaskan Salmon ($11.99) which was cooked nice and juicy and the NY Stake and Fried Shrimp ($11.99) which was cooked to a perfect medium. Their service is a bit slow right from taking your order to clearing your check but it is bearable. Last word of advise would be to add a large glass of one of their in house brewed beers (Amber Ale - European style beer, Hefe Weiss - wheat beer, Dark Larger - Stout, Light - Regular beer and IPA - hoppy bitterness) to any entree for $2.25.

Anyway, we waited about half an hour which went by pretty fast.

I do wish they had a drink menu but there's an open bar and they have craft beer at $2.50 a glass! It's on their chalkboard walls but it's not always so convenient looking for it. 

My boyfriend and I wanted to try both the chicken fried steak and the prime rib so we shared the two dishes. He started with their soup (which is delicious btw) and I just had a salad. We chose fries and mashed potatoes as our sides. Being a potato lover, I was disappointed. Neither of it was freshly made and the mashed potatoes were kind of hard/tasted old.

Their signature steak dinner isn't really a ""steak special"". The proclaimed non menu item ""steak special"" is always advertised, albeit not in the menu. Ellis Island jacked up the price for this dinner by over 100% over the last 5 years. Has inflation jumped that  high? Of course not. 

The service is always mediocre  here. First timers will be shocked how bad it can get. Regulars know this is the norm. However, an often surprise for both is reading how EI has got into doodoo with the Nevada Health Department many times. 

We always have this steak dinner when in Vegas.We don't like Prime Rib. The steak dinner is cheaper and better than McDonalds, that's why we come here and endure the long waits, but that's really the only reason.  The attached motel is frightening to even look at, their guests who stay at the Super 8 are even more frightening. As seen at the Super 8 parking lot, many Canadians from Alberta Canada stay at the Super 8 here. Those Albertans love to drive long distances, don't they?

EI used to have bogo deals for their regular menu items. I tried once their chicken chicken parmigiana and it was simply ordinary so we stopped ordering anything but the steak dinner. The steak is supposed to be 10 oz, I find that hard to believe. I never brought a scale to measure but the steak is quite tiny; however, overall satisfying. It leaves you with enough room in your stomach to go elsewhere and buy some desert or a hot dog an hour later. 

Incidentally, to get the steak dinner now at the advertised price, you have to spend at least $1 per person in the casino or slots to get a voucher for the steak dinner. When ordering a beverage, avoid the root beer. While it's home made, it has no fizz to it at all. Have a beer instead. Their ice tea is simply awful.

If you're not into steak, then by all means suck up an hour or so wait for the bbq ribs grilled on a charcoal grill outside after 5 PM. It's quite large, comes with beans and other good stuff.

Never have I sat for 20-30 mins then for you to sit three other people before us.   Then right as we sit. Waitress comes and we place order. We tell you what we want. You come back and get two out of three drinks wrong. Then you don't even know the special for the day. I ask for. Steak and eggs and you come back and ask me about some. Sausage!! What the fuck are you talking about!! Seriously

They were severely under staffed and the wait time quoted (the first time) was 25 min then the (2nd time) the wait time quoted after being there 45 min was stated to be 45 more minutes. The manager was not helping his staff out by busing tables or getting on the floor to serve his customers. Worst place in vegas.

It's nice because you get texted when your table is ready so you can be at the casino and hang out while you are waiting. We got seated at a table near the back but our waiter made sure that he always found us. Ricardo, super nice and very memorable, always refilling our drinks and hooking us up with the steak deal that you need to ask about that isn't on the menu. He was personable without being creepy and so genuinely caring that we were enjoying our meal. I had the salad with their homemade balsamic dressing and the soup since my boyfriend didn't want his, and it was so good. The steak, green beans, and mashed potatoes were excellent! I think this was the best meal we had in Vegas. No need to win money at the casino here when you will win with this dining experience. It's like I pulled all 3 cherries on the slot machine - taste of food, price, and service was just phenomenal. I will be back here when I come to Vegas and I'm gonna let everyone I know who's heading out to this way as well that this is a place they need to go to.",igaoaFNkX7ieMuyUBg0u5w,0,0,5,usVRIFudgKT8I96uxeXSnA

5811306,2015-11-10,1,dn51F67VLgPuqy_8SFk9oA,"Been going here for years. Been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Breakfast the eggs and steak are good and have had many times.
The steak special that is not on the menu you just ask for the special , it is amazing, We have always loved this special. We remember when it was like 4.99 or 5.99! 
The steak always had the most amazing taste and flavor just like your eating a very expensive steak yet so much cheaper! Believe me we ate one night at a local steakhouse paid over $100 for 2 steak dinners and there was no comparison to the steaks we have always had here. And so much cheaper! The place is older not like in bellagio or one of the upscale hotels. Ellis island is a smaller casino off the strip and is a bit older without the glitch and glamour.. This cafe is not far from the front door and sometimes near dinner time the wait can get pretty long.
The only problem is service can take a little bit depending on when you go but it will be worth your wait.
Some nights you will hear when they start the Karaoke next door and get a good laugh out of some people who are singing.
If your here on Vacation make sure to make this a stop to try, we have brought many friends over the years who are hooked and they go everytime they are in town now.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,1,1,4,zrCVJr0crqZP637n5soIkg

Although this is a small casino and kind of a run down one, the food at this cafe provided top notch value considering your options on the strip.  Eat here with minimal wait or wait two hours at bacchanal buffet in Caesars for $$$$...  Ellis Island is a pretty good alternative I must say.",jIfhz5Njn1gGNeMiGFzGkA,0,0,5,m0lGAocCTGcWaleiD2AhWA

The guy at guest services at our resort recommended it and OMG we ended up going there a couple of times during our trip!! 

The food is sooooooo good and they give you a TON of food for the price!! You can eat a good meal for under $10 and I guarantee you won't be able to finish it!!  They are open 24/7 and they brew their own beer (or root beer if you're not a beer drinker)

The entree came with s salad, green beans and mashed potatoes. The portion was large and the price was great ($9.99). I'd say the food was good, especially for the price. There was some gristly pieces around the edges and the green beans weren't great. The star of the show was the tall beer for $2.75. On a side note, I saw a neighboring table eating the steak special and prime rib. The prime rib looked amazing, but the other patron was sawing through steak special. It looked extremely tough. Overall, I would come back for the beer and probably try the prime rib.",FNr1vklb5iJZ4Cx-8vPSPg,0,0,3,3P4Qoc47F3AJpfEx6qR7sg

My Vegas trip truly isn't complete without stopping here for a meal after dancing all night. It's kind of like Walmart here. You can find all sorts of people from the sober to the ones you know won't remember anything the next day. I'm guilty to say my group usually consists of both kinds. 

You can't expect too much from the chef at 3am, but most of the time the steak is cooked to my liking. 

During the summer, we stopped by here after the pool party and they wouldn't serve our girlfriends who only had bikini tops on. Luckily there was a store nearby that was selling t-shirts so they bought some. 

Be warned: it's extremely hard to catch a taxi in this area at this time, so use Uber if you can.",H9LVW5HzFvsLzUxC-0W4hA,1,0,4,QQyV7bBDvMhn4eBC0TSJuw
5880158,2016-08-07,3,dn51F67VLgPuqy_8SFk9oA,"I'm giving this place 5 stars because if you come to Vegas, you gotta go here at least once. Complete with singing Elvis, Karaoke and cheap casino restaurant prices like a bygone era, this is what I envision Vegas to be. I mean really what happened to all of the cheap places to eat? I thought you were supposed to save your money for gambling? Well, maybe it is cuz there are so many like myself who don't like gambling that most of the restaurants have upped their prices? Or maybe it's inflation? Either way, Ellis Island has succumbed to neither. Their prices make you feel like you are stealing and there food is great casino/diner food. What really puts them at 5 stars is the fact that they are a brewery and sell their craft beers for 2.50 for 20 oz. Wow! We spent $21 on breakfast including tip. Their chicken wings are quite good. I could probably eat here every day while in Vegas and be content. But at least come here once when the horrible Elvis impersonator is here :-)",4bQqil4770ey8GfhBgEGuw,3,4,5,h9M-Faowbcjd5_qkh_F_dg

When the food finally came, it was actually pretty decent. I ordered a cranberry juice. It never came and they charged me. When I brought it up, they questioned me for about 10mins accusing me of drinking it. WTF?! When we finally left and went out to the car, there were two homeless women fist fighting right outside the casino. Yeah, I'll be back soon.
