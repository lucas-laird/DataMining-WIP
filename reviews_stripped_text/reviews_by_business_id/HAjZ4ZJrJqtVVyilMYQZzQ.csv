It is a family owned business and I love to support small businesses: come to find out this place has been around 10-15 years.

Like most of the reviews stated, this place seem more Chinese than Thai. Broccoli chicken seemed microwaved because the broccoli was crunchy and the chicken didn't taste like chicken. The eggrolls tasted like plastic, and the rice was very soggy. I will probably just come back for the Thai Tea and That Iced Coffee.",gragZfJdmY460vX2ym2UNg,0,0,1,QvAeK47hi2A4Gj-fZAXJdg

My 5 star review is only for them.  

There have only been two other places that had similar fried spring rolls such as these - one in Florida and one in California.   I prefer the fried spring rolls that contain more than just cabbage and carrots.
These spring rolls have a mixture of shrimp, pork, and glass noodles and I'll drive across town to get some.

I always place my order to-go so can't rate the place for anything other than spring rolls and their fried rice.  The BBQ pork fried rice is the best I've tasted for something so simple.",2AZDhZZjJDBwb7wJHG5SBg,0,0,5,PHy201avtRH_j75nC9OgFA

Went here for lunch with coworkers and was disappointed.  The Pad Thai was pale looking and both tasteless and too sweet at the same time.  Another co-worker ordered some chicken dish that pretty much tasted like your run of the mill chinese sweet and sour chicken, but with the sauce already poured in.  The Tom Ka was bleh...

All in all a disappointment... and this is after reading the reviews on yelp.  Las Vegas yelpers let me down on this one.",FYuSYO1PvJU-I4Hlgio6mA,1,0,2,6e5JgYHhTZnim6fE5UCcVw
1368025,2018-02-01,0,HAjZ4ZJrJqtVVyilMYQZzQ,"Thai Place is located adjacent from the Target shopping center. When you enter the restaurant, the interior space look like it has different shades of green and it makes the restaurant appear outdated. Somehow I feel like the place is in need of a makeover. 

I ordered the Hawaiian Curry ($11.95) with chicken which comes with pineapple, and the meal is served hot with a side of rice. The chicken taste soft, the pineapple is sweet, and the Hawaiian red coconut curry is spicy. The curry is flavorful, there is a good amount of chicken and pineapple. However, I wish they had given a little more rice with the order. I end up having to request for extra rice, which cost $1.50 and I find that is pricey for just a small serving. I also got a Thai Ice Coffee ($2.79) and request for the drink not to be sweet. Unfortunately, the drink taste too sweet. 

Now almost every Thai restaurants I have dine-in offer mango sticky rice. Sadly, this restaurant doesn't have it on the menu. I ask the server ""why"" and if they were going to have it sometime in the future, and she said ""no."" The only dessert on the menu is Fried Banana ($5.50) which is banana and coconut wrapped in spring roll wrappers, deep fried and topped with honey and sesame seeds. The Fried Banana is served hot and crunchy, it's accompanied with a sweet salad, and it taste okay. I just wish there was ice cream to go with the Fried Banana so it will make it taste better. Overall, I feel the service is friendly and the food is decent. Hopefully the restaurant would at least consider adding a little more options for dessert.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,0,0,3,yil6qwrDbM1_J1vAZZX5NQ

2621855,2010-11-15,2,HAjZ4ZJrJqtVVyilMYQZzQ,"This is a classic, hole in the wall, average Thai restaurant.  The decor isn't anything too fancy, and the radio blares bad club music.  The walls are decorated with Thai tapestries.  The service isn't especially friendly.  Yep, my kind of Thai restaurant!  Today I ordered the Thai iced tea (which was quite nice, and served in a large glass), the pad see ew with pork, and the spicy fried rice with chicken.  

The pad see ew pork was average, but good.  It might have been a little bit on the greasy side, but not too much.  The only real complaint I had here was that they don't serve Chinese broccoli.  It could have had a bit more flavor to it.  With some chili powder though, that problem was mostly solved.  

The spicy fried rice was different.  It had more of a peppery flavor to the spice, and it was a flavor that I haven't had before in Thai food.  The rice was slightly greasy, but at least the peppery taste provided an interesting flavor.  Other than the unique flavor, there wasn't anything to rave about.  If the overall quality of the food was a little higher, I might have changed my mind on this one.

Overall, I would say Thai Place is a descent enough Thai restaurant, but not somewhere I would go out of my way to get to.  The service was a little bit annoying, and the food was average.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,3,3,-aanP8JAJrW1ZRAgQJ3H3Q

3577037,2012-07-29,0,HAjZ4ZJrJqtVVyilMYQZzQ,"I went here one afternoon and wasn't very impressed.  It's close to where I live, kind of tucked away by a Target.  It's virtually impossible to see it from the street.  It's a fairly small place and just one person was dining there.  Not exactly a good sign.  

The menu consists of a lot of standard Thai dishes and other Asian-style dishes like sweet & sour chicken.  For a hole in the wall type place, some of their prices seem a bit high.  They are quite close to Lotus of Siam in terms of price, but Lotus is a highly regarded award-winning restaurant with a menu twice the size.  

Anyway, I'm a big panang fan so I wanted to order chicken panang, but they only have beef panang on the menu. I got it anyway and was a bit disgusted by it.  The rice was OK but a rather small quantity.  The amount of beef and sauce was insane though.  Definitely a large serving but most of the beef was full of gristle and inedible.  It was also cut into very large chunks, which is different from the panang I've had at any other place.  It tasted like the panang had been cooked (like in a big roast) and then put into the sauce at the last minute.  The sauce itself was quite watery -- not at all creamy.  I had asked for a ""15"" spiciness on a scale of 1-10 and made sure they knew I wanted it as hot as possible.  Not so much as a lip tingle -- I'd call it about a 2 or 3.  

I figured I'd give them another chance and go with something involving chicken and rice the next time, but I never got the chance.  I went back a couple of days later around 2:30 and they said they'd be closed for the next hour.  Note that their sign and menu says they are open from around 10 to 9, seven days a week.  I left and then came back a few days later at 5 PM or so and they aren't open again.  Nothing is on their website about their closure or anything.  So, I give up.

Long story short, I'd advise not going here.  The one dish I had was outright disgusting and they were closed two other times I went, for seemingly no reason.  This place is only like 1 mile from the James Beard award-winning Lotus of Siam, which has comparable prices and is sometimes called the best Thai food in the world outside of Thailand.  If you want something a bit more low key, a bit cheaper, but with amazingly delicious food then go a couple of miles west to Thai Style Noodle House.

I said 6 cause i like my food spicy & i thought i could handle it. I hella needed some milk with that plate of mint chicken. Still delicious tho. I love thai place. I haven't ordered anything i didn't like from this restaurant. The quality is excellent.  The only thing is if you order food to go, I suggest you call first and then pick it up becaue it might take a while. Delicious none the less!",jbXJzKisHhNysBbkZEa8EQ,1,1,4,yPGzLa9xRqhkDCu_BBbxFw

I have sat down to eat in restaurant once as well and very good then too. They have beef Satay which was a nice change from the usual chicken. It was great! No complaints about the food!

It's a very small place in the Target shopping center and it's easy to miss, so if you are facing Target, it is in the little strip mall on the left next to a Vegas souvenir shop. My stepdad and I come here once a week, and the food is always perfect!! The girls that work in the front are so nice too, and they remember us when we come in.  Panang curry is my favorite food on earth and theirs is amazing.  They do it with the thick sauce and that's the way I like it, not watery like some places do it.  And they will make it really spicy too, if you ask, you just need to tell them that yes you do indeed want it really spicy.  You know it's gonna be hot because they will ask you if you are really sure about that.  Level 7 has me sweating and crying a little, so you have been warned...  If you want it mild they will do that too.

It was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. Out of several Thai places that we have tried here in Vegas, this is our favorite. The Pad Thai is very yummy and the Papaya salad was enough to satisfy my spicy taste buds. The fried banana is a sin to die for!
Not to mention the high quality of speedy service.
I agree the facility is ""basic"" but very clean and inviting. I feel more comfortable here than a fancy restaurant with bamboo trees growing out of the floors and aquariums with exotic animals. The stark booths make me feel like I am getting away with enjoying good quality for little expense at a unknown humble and tucked away treasure that only a few know about.",sd4qR4rjOKpAIlK6rmrzog,0,0,5,XuTrAb6oNOHClMhiGu09RQ

Radio music in the background, nothing too culturally fancy. The afternoon I came here the place was virtually empty. My waitress was very attentive to my questions and my needs, even when she herself was having lunch (it doesn't bother me when employees themselves sit down to eat and are visibly doing so, at least I know they're not starving on the clock!)

I enjoyed the cucumber salad, and was surprised when I got the Tofu Delight dish, since it's much more than one person could eat alone! It comes with a heaping scoop of rice, so the meal in itself can get you full relatively quick. Judging from the menu it seemed to be a typical hole in the wall Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, with the prices being around the typical average they would be in a Thai restaurant. My reason for four stars was the service alone, because when can you beat service when they are friendly and attentive?",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,1,0,4,JM5JSq_98DRAumCJjY_Kog

I had the pepper steak lunch special, a cucumber salad and delicious Thai tea. Some plates have more items than others. My lunch came with a soup of the day, little salad w/sweet clear dressing, steam rice, and egg role. All 4 of us enjoyed the food. The hot peppers on the cucumber salad are truly ""SUPER HOT"", don't eat them if you are not accustomed to that. The service is great, the food doesn't take an eternity and its greatly flavored.
The place is not luxurious and the prices are reasonable. The restroom is worned. 
I'm guessing that the owner doesn't speak English because he refused to talk to us and hear how great our experience was at his lovely little restaurant. 
YES! I recommend the food here.
