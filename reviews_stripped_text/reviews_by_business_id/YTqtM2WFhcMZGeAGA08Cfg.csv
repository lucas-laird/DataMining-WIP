So we pild into two cabs...cabbie has never heard of the place.  We are driven to a location in Las Vegas that is...well, seemed a touch sketchy.  But we are there, so might as well have an adventure, right?!  No one is in the restaurant, and I'm thinking to myself 'that's not a good sign'.  The guy who welcomed us, the owner possibly (excuse me, can't remember his name, it is Vegas and I may or may not have been drinking since breakfast, resulting in memory loss concerning names), was super friendly.

Everyone ordered something different, and everyone liked their meals.  Definately worth going off the beaten path for this place.",bSSq1dEkDu2cFsIK2IR8EQ,0,0,5,oa1NzI1KKhydXZG22rtuJA

Instead they welcomed us with open arms ! Served us and were so sweet about it.

We ordered shrimp empanadas , shrimp tacos , and tostada de aguachile. All amazing and seriously worth your money.

Get greeted and seated right away by a super friendly waiter (part of the family who owns it). Order: apps: Aguachiles, oysters preparado. Entree: I get the mariscos molcajete and wife gets the fried catfish with pico de gallo. HOLY CRAP!! Everything was off the hook. Bold, in your face flavors, incredibly fresh and authentic. The Aguachiles, ceviche style shrimp in a spicy lime chile sauce, was mouth watering and perfectly spicy at a 5 out of 10. The oysters were topped with a generous pile of ceviche mixto with a great hot sauce and even under all that you could still taste the creamy, briny oyster. My molcajete was huge and the sauce is so balanced and deep in flavor. The catfish was PERFECTLY fried and was juicy and tender. Washed it all down with a free horchata for checking in. 

This is serious Mexican seafood, and could command a much greater price, but it's location and family oriented style makes it affordable and outstanding. Truly a gem on the Vegas casual dining scene. GO NOW!!",Pdkr6ajlAYWApTOXbni2hw,2,1,5,-bOAYS5qfkLsq8knlnvqRg

992680,2014-12-22,0,YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,"A friend recommended Mariscos Playa Escondida and boy did it win us over. This Mexican restaurant specializing in seafood was completely off my radar. It's located on East Charleston near Maryland Pkwy in a stripmall tucked behind Tacos Mexico. It could easily be missed if you weren't specifically looking for it. It's a true hole in wall, but let me tell you it is a gem! 

This was an experience equal to those we've had off the beaten path in the Riveria Maya. No flight or passports required. It's hard to believe they can achieve these flavors and create this delicious seafood in the middle of the desert. But they do it. 

We let our friendly server guide us with our order. He recommended the aguachile tostada and the shrimp empanadas. We had to have both. The empanadas were too hot to handle from the fryer so we let those cool, while we dug into the aguachile. They offer spicy dishes on a scale of 1-10, we ordered an 8 for everything. There was no false advertisement everything had a nice kick just the way we like it. The aguachile is diced shrimp marinated in chiles and lime. If you like ceviche, you'll love this. We gobbled it up between bites of the house salsa and chips. 

The empanadas are the best I've had outside Ecuador. These were filled with tender shrimp, onions, tomatoes and garlic. Damn tasty! I'd go for some now, if they were only open on Mondays. Definitely a must a try! We had three for $8. 

I was easily swayed on the whole snapper ($9/lb) its topped with spicy cream sauce, onions, jalapenos and avocado, and served with rice, beans and handmade tortillas. I prefer the corn to the flour. I've enjoyed snapper half a dozen ways but snapper tacos were a first; they did not disappoint. A two pound fish left plenty to share with the husband.

He ordered the appetizer of the el tecolote shrimp per our servers suggestion. He warned that it was a lot of work, but definitely worth the effort. He was right. The flavor was fantastic. 

They have a nice variety of Cerveza ($3.50). We had five Victorias between us and a few pounds of seafood for $75. It was a steal and a real treat!",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,2,5,h4DPKjnZsnEaliEUtSHPiA

It was a little ways off the strip but right off the freeway. Tiny hole in the wall place in a strip mall. The family I was with ordered a bunch of specialty appetizers I had never had and said they were prepared perfectly and in comparison to the restaurants right on the beach in Mexico. My husband and I had shrimp cocktails. The juice and large amount of shrimp was perfect! We had soda, aguas frescas and prepared beer and it was all on point. The prices were great and they even accepted credit card which was great for us travelers. The salsa is delicious and the waitresses were so attentive and friendly. We ordered so much food and were enjoying our company we were probably there for a few hours; it was such an inviting atmosphere.

1st nobody greeted us, we were unsure if you sit yourself or wait for a hostess to seat us so we stood there for about 3 minutes looking like total idiots until we decided to take a seat ourselves. 2nd after they took our order the food took 27 minutes to come out (yes I counted because I was starving) and not once did they ask what we wanted to drink they just assumed we both wanted a water. 3rd I asked for some lemon after my plate arrived and I never got it and they never came back to ask if we were okay or needed anything else 
It's 2017 so we only carry cards on us, but they and don't accept American Express and that's all we have. I asked the lady if they don't take it because of the fee it charges them and she quickly responds yes because of the fee. So I tell her to charge us extra if that's the case so we don't have to drive all the way back to our hotel on the strip which is a 25 minute drive from here, so she goes inside to ask her boss come out with the bullshit that they just don't have the machine for AE cards, BTW all machines take all cards but AE just happens to charge the most fees so they don't want to do it. 
Now I'm sitting in the restaurant while my husband drives back to the hotel room go get a different method of payment lol 
I'm all for supporting mom & pop restaurants like this one but this place sucks!! I would've been more satisfied and would've had better service at a McDonald's drive thru",tf9ieIXLl9jRHDgzhPfprA,2,0,1,LddHJyVzWB0Rc_5ov6bBzQ

We also tried the large shrimp in a spicy red sauce (sorry I'm writing this in Vegas and I don't remember the name) and that was also amazing. We almost licked the plate clean it was so good.

The server was attentive and informative. Took the time to explain to us the items on the menu. He also asked us to tell him how spicy we wanted our food from 1-10. We chose a 7 and to us it was perfect.

So my wife now says this was her favorite seafood place. We're definitely going back now!

But here we are.

First things first. You WILL fill up on those damn chips and salsa. I normally hate chips and salsa. It always seems like they take 2-day old stale chips with whatever garbage left-over salsa from the night before and slide it in front of you.

But as I write this, my mouth waters for the spicy-ness of the salsa they serve here. I almost ruined my meal by filling up on chips and salsa.....

So spicey in fact that I had to get up and grab a handful of hot fritos to quench that spicey craving.

Moving on.

We had a party of 6 with 5 seperate checks and our waitress did an amazing job of keeping track of us all. She never missed a beat.

The food was delicious. I had the camarones a la diabla and they tasted really damn good.

The reason I knocked off a star for this establishment was because the waitress asked how spicey I wanted it. Now.... the fact that my mouth was on the verge of fire cause of the salsa, I wanted more spicey.

She asked me on a level of 1 to 10, how spicey I wanted my food and I said 10. She asked me 'Are you sure?'

This question took me back to a time when someone asked me that while placing a hot wings order and I said yes. 

I ended up getting the ring of fire.

I felt like the salsa was level 2 so I asked for level 5 fearing I would die if I got level 10.

Fast forward to eating my delicious meal and there was no spicey whatsoever.

I felt robbed. I wanted to sit there uncomfortably fanning my mouth asking for water.

I'm glad this place is sort of a hidden gem. Keeps all the asshole out-of-towners (no worries, I feel that way about you all anyways) away and hungover on the strip.",T2h6OlazEQRU9y4j1AlgIw,1,0,4,Qubwhb5-LE5Vnkz6WJHenQ

The restaurant is tucked on a corner of the strip mall and decor is cheesy. Painted scenes of the beach. The service and food are 5 star.  amazing and delicious.

1636816,2015-03-02,5,YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,"I really came in here with optimism seeing the high ratings, but sadly this was another dodge at Mexican food for me.   Maybe we came in on the good cook's day off, but I doubt it and will not return to find out.

The place was packed so I thought that's got to be a good sign, right? But no, the place is just really small.   The next big test would be the chips and salsa, and unfortunately bottled salsa and stale chips are not a good impression on what's to follow.

We tried to order the yelp check in offer of a free Horchata, but our server said this was only good during the week, so our  impatient server said he'd be back and we continued to search the menu. 

A different server dropped off two large Horchatas and so I thought wow we didn't really put in our order, but thought oh well they're here now, and I then asked if these were the small or large drinks, and she said ""large, because there are no refills""  WoW!  I didn't think the first server even took our drink order and then to find out we didn't have a choice of small or large really did not impress me further.  The Horchata was clearly just rice water with a little sugar and cinnamon, not good at all!

On to our appetizer and entrees.  We ordered a half a dozen of oysters that were prepared with pulpo (octopus) and crab ceviche type of thing.   They were very bland with no taste of seafood whatsoever and the crab of course was imitation crab these were served with some kind of  runoff liquid, gross.  At this point I was not looking forward to the rest of our orders, but they came out before I could finish with my thoughts.  I had the bandera burrito which came with carne asada, chorizo rice and beans, covered in some red and green tasteless sauce.  The chorizo totally overpowered the carne asada taste or anything else inside the burrito and was just not good at all.   My husband ordered some kind of shrimp dish which had six or seven overcooked shrimp all shriveled up buried under sautéed onions, accompanied by bland rice and overly refried beans.  

The food was not good by any means, and to top it off there was a two man band playing nice music but way to loud for such a small establishment. 

Hole in the wall places like these normally are the best type of eateries but this one unfortunately for me was a wasted hole in a wall and could stay a playa escondida (hidden beach). The best part was the company, (thanks Norm and Nels) but as far as the food here, nothing I would ever want to try twice, in fact I wish I could take this one back.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,7,4,1,tv3chozXXI_qUJa8a3vdCQ

This restaurant is off the strip about 3-4 miles (driving) and is very hidden. Nestled in a corner of a shopping center the restaurant itself is very small.

Upon walking in we were greeted right away and sat immediately. Cue the chips and salsa! Fresh chips and salsa- the salsa was very spicy which is good because it woke me up from my hangover comma. 

I immediately ordered the ""buen dia"" michelada and it was very tasty and delicious. Fresh shrimp on the rim and with some surprising floating oysters ( I must have not read the description properly) but my reaction was ""what the heck"" in a good way. Mind you- I was nearly dying after binge drinking/partying all night. Plus I LOVE OYSTERS. That buen dia michelada was chugged in matter of seconds.

Onto the main event: I had the ""Vuelve a la vida"" translation = COME TO LIFE and boy did I come to life. It was presented in a this shell shape bowl filled with delicious seafood. This cocktail of seafood was beyond tasty. No joke but after finishing my meal- I felt like a brand new person. LOL.

We got here around 8:30 on a Friday night. The restaurant is in a ghetto area and you can easily miss it if you aren't paying attention to your GPS. When we walked in, it was full of customers, and the interior looked like something you'll find in truck stop restaurants of third world country, same with the smell. I ordered the horchata drink that was free with the yelp check in (extra small glass half full of ice, but hey its free). 

We ended up getting molecajete, which contained skirt steak, shrimp, cheese, grilled cactus and grilled green onions in a stone bowl. It was an unique appetizer, the steak and shrimp were pretty good. The steak was tender, but little greasy. However the cactus was pretty sour and didn't jive with the whole dish. May be it's best as a decoration. 

Our main meal orders contained shrimp in spicy sauce and fillted fish in spicy sauce with rice and beans. The sauce was perfect, however the seafood was even better. The fish and the shrimp were very fresh and tender the sauce complimented both of the dished perfectly. 

This restaurant could have been a perfect 4 star restaurant in my book, but it needs to look cleaner and the service has to be better. They are charging more money than Lindo Michoacan , so I would except the quality in terms of hospitality to be there.

SHRIMP EMPANADAS: Got an order of 3, just as good as everyone else says. Empanadas are perfectly cooked without being oily, and the filling is just the right amount with a slight kick of spice and they don't skimp on the shrimp.

MARLIN TACO: Be still my heart! I fell in love with marlin tacos on a recent trip to San Diego and can't get enough of them since. A small taco, for $3.50, with cheese, several avocado slices, and perfectly roasted marlin. So good I almost ordered a few more to-go.

AGUACATE RELLENO: Special of the day, a ceviche-stuffed avocado. Each 'cado half was overflowing, and there was a pile more on the plate. I don't think I've ever had more ceviche for $12, and the avocado was huge. Plating was beautiful, with a rim of cucumber slices serving a functional and decorative purpose.

Our meal was good.  Started with their Campechana (shrimp/octopus cocktail) and it was excellent and shrimp was plentiful.  I had their snapper deep fried served with an onion jalapeño spicy sauce.

We have a tremendous amount of authentic Mexican food places where we live so while I thought it was definitely yummy and didn't quite understand all of the hype.

Also while the salsa was really flavorful, the chips were too thick for my taste.

The ceviche tostada was heavenly and generously portioned with ceviche cascading onto the plate. I could have eaten 5 of them, lol.

I ordered the seafood molcajate and I guess I didn't realize that it was nothing like the pollo/carne/shrimp version because mine was served like a seafood stew. It was decent but certainly not what I thought I was ordering. My hubs got a shrimp dish that was good but a little small in my opinion. 

Now the shrimp cocktail that everyone has raved about was a huge disappointed. There were plenty of shrimp but the ""cocktail"" was nothing more than tomato juice with no seasoning and no flavor. I emptied almost half the bottle of Tapatio into it just to give it some flavor. Oh well....

I ordered the molcajete de carne. I did not like it at all. The meat was so overcooked and tough. Am I eating beef jerky? The beans that came with it was so oily and greasy. Chorizo had no flavor and it was a crumbling mess. I took one bite of the cactus and didn't eat the rest. The only thing I liked was the Mexican cheese.

Also, noticed the shrimp was not deveined in the aguachiles so cleaning shrimp poop was a joy. They didn't honor the free horchata when you check in which I was turned off by. It irritates me when businesses don't honor stuff. The waiter looked peeved too when I asked about the check in.

I don't know if I'll be back. The service was good until the check in part at the end. The empanadas were good and I have enjoyed other shrimp dishes there on previous visits but damn, that molcajete turned me off.",TS4RfxKny-c8QYcnMpfkiQ,10,8,2,SJSTNqhDqH2SCnDoQMDYpw

We were greeted and served immediately upon coming in. The menu had something for everyone, including non-seafood eaters. The prices were not cheap, but it's Vegas. Back home, at 18 bucks a place you're at a decent sit down restaurant - definitely not a hole in the wall.

I chose the ceviche topped on a corn tortilla while the hubby had loaded fresh oysters topped with ceviche. The taste was so fresh and amazing; my hubby was in heaven! The shrimp empanadas were stuffed with shrimp with a delicate thin dough. Perfect!

I was a little bit scared to tell you the truth. It's in a sketchy area BUT we decided to go through and check it out. 

Our server (which she was AWESOME!!) took her time with us. She brought us chips (which were pretty stale) and salsa (which was spicy but tasted like it was hechado a perder). I ordered a mango margarita which was pretty good, my husband and uncle ordered a ""Buen Dia"" michelada which they LOVED and my aunt ordered agua de mango. 

On to the food...I ordered fajitas de carne. It was seriously DELICIOUS! The fajitas had the perfect sazón! I wasn't a big fan of the rice or beans because most of the time it doesn't matter what restaurant I go to, they never get it right. So I didn't have high expectation on that. My husband ordered ""Vuelve a la vida."" I honestly don't know what it had but he said he liked it. I'm guessing it was shrimp, oysters and imitation crab. My uncle ordered shrimp cocktail. He was pleased and surprised that they filled it up with a lot of shrimp. Most of the time at some restaurants they usually get real cheap with adding more shrimp on their cocktails. My tia had flautas which she said was pretty good. 

All in all the service was fantastic! They just need to keep an eye on their chips and salsa. Stale chips and spoiled salsa isn't fun to eat.",hAjfXIvUmJZ0Ll6XTdOSvA,1,1,3,TmxEKRzQJz1LK7moEJZUvQ

I ordered 2 tostadas de camarron and  they were pretty good & they're really big so one is plenty! My honey ordered the cocktail and  aguachiles, it was all just ehhh ok. Again all the seafood just didn't taste fresh like I was craving. We ordered a side of fries and beans (for dipping lol don't judge) and to be honest THAT was the best part of our meal.

The inside was filled with shrimp, onions, tomato and garlic. I guess that why it's so tasty. Oh yes and my shrimp cocktail was very fulfilling to me got my craving out. The hubby ordered the Camarones a la diabla. Now that was delish, lots of shrimp. They didn't skimp out on us which were great. 

The service was good. When I needed service they attended to us. Which is great, I didn't have to flag them down.

Service has always been fast and friendly, and the shrimp empanadas are a must-  piping hot and tasty, if a little spendy at $7.50 for an order of three.

They have some meat and chicken dishes, but you really want to stick with the seafood. (Mole was on the menu, but they never seemed to have it. Noticed they finally went ahead and crossed it off).

And speaking of the menu, it's one of those kinds with pictures of everything, A practice perhaps frowned upon in finer dining circles, but it sure do come in handy when venturing into unfamiliar territory like actual Mexican food that doesn't come in a bag with a picture of a bell on it.

My favorite new (to me) thing I tried was the deep fried whole tilapia, which comes with your choice of sauce. The skin was brown and crispy to the point of crunchy, with moist, white meat that you ferret out whilst on a treasure hunt of its little dead carcass. Yum! The Anaconda seemed alarmed by the french-fried face staring up at us, but I was undeterred.
He opted for the red, white, and green burrito, which was almost too much food, even for him. Note I said almost.

Service has always been friendly and attentive, even when they're busy. I haven't encountered the dreaded live music yet, but the space is very small so can't imagine that it wouldn't be annoying even without amplifiers.

All the food we've tried has been really good. They do garnish the plate with the ubiquitous and inexplicable undressed lettuce leaves called ""salad"", and the chips are just okay and the salsa is too hot for my taste. Wish they offered a milder option, especially since the soda comes in cans, meaning no refills when lots of cold liquids are mandatory.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,1,0,4,jTFPBlF7JPH3DC6wwOfGAg

The decorations are very cute inside as well.

So naturally, the next time I was in Vegas I felt like I needed to go back to this amazing place! However, this second time wasn't quite as special.

I was looking for something comparable to las Islitas with out the high price tag and, playa popped up. Small yet clean little place. Very attentive server and prompt. I got the shrimp a la diabla, shrimp mojo de ajo, ostiones preparados, langostina, and shrimp al vapor..(I came with a party of 4).

Shrimp a la diabla (spicy shrimp)- spicy but bleh flavor, garlicky rice was ok, lettuce on the side was just a waste of lettuce, but I really enjoyed the beans bc it had pieces of chicharron.. Atleast I hope that's what it was.
Mojo de ajo shrimp (garlic butter shrimp) tasted more of onions than garlic. Definitely not memorable. 
Shrimp al vapor (steamed shrimp) was nicely seasoned but was almost too sweet for my taste, due to all the bell peppers. 
Langostinas (langoustines)- nice spicy sauce, but only came with 3 langoustines. There was hardly any meat in them which made that dish disappointing. 
Ostiones preparados (prepared oysters with a shrimp salad on top)-were ok, but you can tell the oysters weren't fresh. I'm used to the ones sold at ""las Islitas"" so I might've had my hopes too high. The shrimp salad needed more lemon and some salt and maybe a nice sauce to top it off. 

All in all, the place was nice and clean and service was friendly and prompt. Food was ok, but not worth the 5 yelp stars in my opinion. The prices are fair, but I think this would be my first and last visit since it didn't wow me.

3600447,2015-03-02,16,YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,"""Five Stars? You Kidding Me Right???""

Packed locals' restaurant tucked away in the corner of the Charland Plaza on E Charleston and Maryland Parkway, this tiny hole in the wall has received rave reviews and maintained a 5-star rating. That was enough to persuade us to see what it was all about. Live music goin' on, everyone seemed to be enjoying the food and a pretty extensive menu too. 

We decided to start off with some Ostiones Preparadas and a couple of popular items suggested by the employees, The Shrimp Tecolote and Carne Asada Burrito. We order a couple of watered down horchatas(check in offer valid only Mon-Thur, 1 drink per table FYI) and stale-ish chips and possibly the spiciest salsa Pace Picante makes its way to our table while our order is being made.

The Oysters are the first to arrive, good sized plump looking oysters piled high with mixed seafood-shrimp, octopus, and IMITATION CRAB!? Seafood is what you specialize in!?!? This mix was borderline rubbery. Underneath was even worse because the oysters were flavorless. I'm pretty sure whoever shucked the oysters dumped the oyster liquor down the drain, rinsed the oyster and shell, and re assembled everything again. So disappointing

Other flops of the evening...The burrito was plentiful but the red and green sauces on top were straight up enchilada sauces from a bottle/can like the Las Palmas kind. The Shrimp Tecolote were rubbery and overcooked, and halfway through, I was done after seeing that some shrimp weren't deveined properly(see photo).  Are you sure that you're a restaurant that specializes in seafood??? I also later found out we were served the wrong dish by our waitress who suggested this dish! The picture of the correct dish I saw on the Yelp photos shows shell-on shrimp in a red sauce. Ours was nowhere near that. Lots of kitchen errors and a service error recieve no stars from me. The only star is for the great company we had. Seafood specialists? EEK! METHINKS NOT!!!  smh... ALOHA!!!

I suggest you make a point to find this place though because it's a really decent spot for mariscos. It's small but comfortable inside. Our server was very friendly and helpful. 

Beer is pretty cheap here, which is always a plus.

The chips and salsa are okay. Chips were served cold which is kind of a bummer. The sauce had a sweet, canned tomato taste at first, but the flavor finishes off with an unusually spicy kick, so I can't really hate it.

Our dinner was great though. I got the filet with Diablo sauce. It was a huge piece of white fish smothered in spicy red sauce with sautéed onions. The beans and rice it came with were very good, although I would have like a little bit more. My wife loved her shrimp cocktail. I didn't try it but it looked wonderful. The ceviche was delicious and very vibrant.

3884243,2014-11-13,1,YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,"HOT HOT HOT! Real Mexican Food

NO fake watered down Americanized food here says the owner as he was helping me with my with my menu selection. I needed my hangover cure Mexicano style after a long night of remy martin and loud ass music. 

First things first he could tell my wife and I were hurting offers a $5 Michelada. Serve it up please. He quickly comes back with Fresh Chips and Salsa. Chips were warm salsa was spicy a bit salty for me but good. The michelada is about the only item not on point served in a large glass cup, rimmed with the usual fruit salad salt, however there was no Ice or whatever remnants of ice were melted through. Not much mixed inside tasted like clamato and beer it was not terrible but Ive had and make way better thus -1 star. But Im here for the food so bring it on. 

We wanted something cold and refreshing but also something hot and filling. The owner recommended their shrimp empanadas to start off. I ordered a plate of 3 $8. They were soooo good. Served super duper hot nice and crispy not oily, plenty of shrimp inside with pico de gallo and a wonderful green salsa on the side. This salsa was very good not salty just perfectly spicy and citrusy. I burned my mouth eating it, dont care love my food piping hot. These were very filling and big, Im already full WTH. 

Next my wife ordered the large shrimp cocktail $12. Cocktail had plenty of shrimp, not like other restaurants that either have tiny shrimp you need a magnifying glass to see or 5 medium shrimp bobbing up and down with nothing but vegetables. This cocktail had tons of medium sized shrimp with just enough veggies and lots of avocado in the mix. The shrimp were soft to the bite, the juice was tasty enough salt and citrus flavors perfect for the hangover cure. 

For my filling apetite I opted for the Camarones a la Diabla. Now for you hueros be careful when ordering this plate. The owner asked me, no warned me do you want the house style or medium level of heat the sauce comes with. I says man make them how you make them bro dont water em down for me ""este cabron thinks I cant handle it, im don chingon fool"" Alright you got it. My plate arrived everything fresh and piping hot. Lots of medium sized shrimp onions and bellpeppers served in a thick mole type broth with white rice, salad, and beans on the side $14. My first bite of the shrimp reminded me of my wifes home made mole recipe passed down from her grandma in Zacatecas not that mole u get in the jar. This Sauce was delicious, first bite I says good what the problem is, well u ever here of an afterburn and no Im not talking about working out. Shortly after swalling my mouth was on fire but even though it was on fire and could not be quenched by the michelada or my wifes cold coktail I immediately started to drink; I kept on eating it was too delicious. The owner came by several times ""te lo rebajo si quieres?"", I can reduce the heat for you if you want. Each time he passed my nose was running eyes were crying but I kept trucking on best camarones a la diabla  ever I had I told him. He says if they dont make your nose runny their not camarones al diabla.This is real mexican food just like my mother makes it. The white rice was delicious soft and not oily like most restaurants that serve orange rice. Beans, be careful sooo good, but that also means they may be cooked with lard so yes later you may have a gas issue. Although surprisingly I did not. 

All in all good quality food, good service, great prices. Location is totally ghetto yo, downtown area 10-15 min drive from the strip but worth it. Located in a strip mall behind the TACOS MEXICO. We thought they were closed at 10:10am on Sunday but owner just opened up for us as we were leaving glad he did. The inside of the restaurant is clean, very small tastefully decorated with murals throughout.

3973946,2015-03-01,6,YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,"I recently found this place on Yelp and decided it was a must try.  Before leaving the house last night, I saw a Yelp friend had just checked in.  When I got there, I joined his wife and him as they finished up and I ordered.

The chips were standard fare but the salsa was very good because it had a good spiciness to it which I like.  

For an appetizer, I ordered three shrimp empanadas and for the main course I got the carnitas platter.  I also got a Diet Coke which was served in the can with a straw.

My error was in ordering the two things at the same time or not specifying that I wanted the empanadas first and then the main.  Instead, both dishes were brought at the same time.  The empanadas were very hot (temperature).  The carnitas were lukewarm at best and the food was plated on a cool dish making the beans, rice, and carnitas all not very hot.  This is so different than most Mexican restaurants where you sometimes can hardly touch the hot plates.

The empanadas were the star of my meal.  They were very tasty with a good amount of shrimp pieces in each one.  The green sauce that accompanies them was excellent.  Another spicy sauce that helped make this dish a winner.  Unfortunately, the carnitas were a fail.  The meat was dry and I need to put some Tapatio on for flavor and for moisture.  The beans and rice were standard.  

I was going back and forth between my appetizer and my main course at the same time and this detracted from the enjoyment of the meal aside from the temperature problems with the carnitas noted above.

The servers were very friendly and helpful.  As other reviewers have noted, this is a small, hole in the wall restaurant that doesn't seat a whole lot of people at one time.  I joined my friends and there was an extra bit of wait for service--my fault because I didn't stop anyone to let them know I wanted to order.  When brought a menu, it had dripped salsa on it in two places.

There was live music last night with two talented guys.  It was however very loud.  We really had to speak loudly to each other to be heard.  

If I come back, it would be for a shrimp cocktail that looked very good (the neighboring table ordered one) and I'd come back for the empanadas.  

Finally, you shouldn't have difficulty finding this restaurant if you go to the Charland Plaza at the corner of Charleston and Maryland Parkway.  Just go in the door under the open sign and you won't enter the beauty shop as I did.

As one group was leaving, another friend on Yelp stopped to introduce himself!  Yelp, you're amazing!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,8,3,bgNifYGgRQWfnKRNaXp3QA

I took yelpers' advice and tried the aguachile shrimp tostada, the shrimp empanadas along with a small guacamole. Chips were warm, shrimp was clearly made / marinated in lime upon my order because they still had that velvety-raw mouthfeel. The lime/salt/chili kick was great. I ordered an 8 heat level and my server side-eyed me...you really want it that hot? I did -- but I think she adjusted because it was definitely not super hot, but it was delicious nonetheless. 

Please note, food is not cheap - but you wouldn't want it to be since they specialize in seafood dishes. They're also closed Mondays which is worthy of another nod. (No fish deliveries on Sunday so fish is always less than stellar on Mondays...) Nice to note that they are busy and do a brisk business which is what you want to see. It's definitely worth the trip. Lots to taste and try. For those who aren't interested in seafood, you've got options, but seafood is definitely the star here. 

Even though they take credit cards, the machine may or may not be working so to be safe bring cash -- $20 per person minimum without beer.  

Several large tables were enjoying lunch so they can accommodate a few groups, but not much...but the small size made it even more enjoyable -- and probably made the dishes feel that much larger...",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,1,1,5,Qv-vhset8uBTEYV5ZSVenA

4108282,2017-09-29,7,YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,"Going off the overall emotional and visceral reaction, I'd give it the highest rating on this little scale of ours. After taking an objective approach and considering some of the flaws, I think four stars will more than suffice.

Mariscos Playa Escondida is literally a ""hidden"" gem, or hidden beach if you know enough Spanish to translate its name. It's in a nondescript strip mall on the northeast corner of Maryland and Charleston, and most visitors definitely would grant it hole-in-the-wall status if they should dare to venture to this slightly sketchier area of town. My friends and I have been doing dinner on Thursday nights recently and our chooser of the week served up this highly-rated and surprisingly not-very-busy spot.

We started off with heretofore unfamiliar beer ""cocktails"" from their drinks menu, specifically the Preparadas section. These reminded me of Bloody Marys, but I don't like Bloody Marys; in contrast, I actually enjoyed my Buen Dia ($7.50), a tall pint of your choice of beer mixed with tomato juice and other ingredients, along with a lone fresh oyster at the bottom and garnishes of shrimp and cucumber slices. There was an overall salty character and the bitterness of the beer was drowned out.

One of my friends got an Aterdecer ($9.50), which is another Preparada and has what were described as spicy oysters... yeah, riiight. A more apt description would be napalm oysters. I ended up with the 3rd and final oyster after he gamely took down two, and I learned why he was so eager to offer it up. It set my tongue on fire and kept it ablaze for several minutes. If you're into that kind of thing, then this is what you want. If not, then stay the burning heck away.

Complimentary tortilla chips and relatively medium tomato-based salsa were provided. The chips come out warm and crunchy and the salsa was the typical accompaniment. Another good option is guacamole ($3 for a small, $6 for a large), and our small bowl was shared among four people just fine (disclaimer: we had already eaten some snacks, enjoyed some relatively filling drinks, and been victimized by palate-numbing bites). It was a good guacamole, and it contained tomatoes but didn't taste much if at all of lime.

I was my typical indecisive self when it came time to pick an entree, but following the employee's guided questions and eventual suggestion, I grabbed the individual-sized portion of the Parillada de Mariscos ($21.99, includes 3 tortillas; unsure of English translation ), which is a grilled mixed seafood plate. Shrimp, real crab, fake crab, bay scallops, diced octopus, fish, and even abalone were all present on a metal and wood plate. This is not a sauced dish, but they must have used a great dry rub before grilling. All of the proteins were delicious, and the Mexican green onion garnish was surprisingly intriguing. The sides of not-so-plain white rice, refried beans (with some cheese), and salad were also tasty and useful (more on this shortly).

Alas, I couldn't overlook some of my observations. Most notably, the salt variation was too much; the cut of fish was underseasoned, whereas most of the rest of the items veered toward the high end of the salty scale. Yes, liberal usage of the sides and the tortillas helps, but it becomes too much eventually. I loved the thickest parts of the crab legs and the claw, but the exposed and thinner parts of the crab legs ended up falling apart and becoming too dry. Smaller bits of seafood didn't come out perfectly either. On that note, they really could've utilized larger shrimp. Those can't be that much more expensive and simply have higher potential.

My favorite bite of the night was actually the namesake of a friend's Carnitas plate. What a marvelously fatty and tender bite of pork that was! I also liked the savory broth in the cheese-topped Seafood Molcajete and the more briny broth of a seafood soup enough that I would consider trying those on a return visit after I get some of those carnitas.

I didn't pay that much attention to the costs of my friends' entrees, but they were lower in price than mine. Two of them also didn't have to worry; as a result of not-having-awful-luck, I won a credit card roulette game (in other words, the host/server chose his card out of a random draw) and resultingly wasn't on the hook for any of what we got. I think the victim had actually proposed this draw, so big props to him for tonight.

Mariscos Playa Escondida isn't perfect, but it's well worth your while if you want great Mexican seafood, with at least one awesome terrestrial meat to boot. I will strive to return for carnitas and for further menu exploration.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,10,4,aL6U9xNmb8sw_gwUeuXUFQ

Food: Regular Michelads were spot on, great mix. It's their homemade mix, delicious. To start we had shrimp tecolotes, shrimp in a spicy sauce, great favor and not to spicy. You could chose whatever level of spiciness you want. We tried level 2 (bcuz we had some people that don't like spicy) still delicious. Oysters preparados, imagine oysters with a seafood mix on top. This were good if you add lemon, salt and tapatio. Only had 1/2 dozen and believe me they were topped with plenty seafood mix. Husband had a mojarra frita (fried fish) he loved it. Friend had shrimp enmantecados (buttered shrimp) similar to shrimp scampi. This shrimp were cooked in butter with onions. Delicious. And I saved the best for last Pescado Zarandeado (grilled fish) this is the best I've had! Once cooked it's covered with a sauce and grilled onions. It's ordered by the pound. My plate was 2 lbs because I thought I was going to share. Lol I was so good I ate it all!!! 
Atmosphere: the restaurant is small. It was half full so we didn't have to wait to be seated. You could tell they have a lot of regular costumers because on more than one occasion I heard staff calling customers by name. Very friendly environment even the customers are friendly we had great conversations with customers.

To start, the chips and salsa are top notch. Something so simple can vary greatly, but the complexity of flavor in the salsa and the fresh crispy chips make these stand out as one of the better versions I've had. 

The shrimp here are especially fresh, and the restaurant takes a lot of care in cleaning and preparing them. They may be small but they are plump and tasty. I recommend trying them in the Aguacaliente ceviche style (either chopped on a tostada or whole in the full appetizer version) or the Chipotle entree style. 

Fajitas are hit or miss (once the veggies were overcooked with far too much oil), but they do come with a nice added touch of a little quesadilla on top. House specialties are done well, but I find myself coming back for the shrimp. All entrees are served with deliciously authentic beans. 

For the value, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better Mexican seafood restaurant in town. I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Escondida!",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,2,3,5,9qJJ2wq3J116CFO0GvUC7A

Facility: Do NOT be scared by the outside of this place. You step inside and feel very comfortable. It has about 12 tables and chairs, and the murals almost give it a Mexican Riviera feel.  

Service:  I was greeted by Berto. He was very friendly and super helpful. He told me how it was a family business and his mother did all the cooking. He pointed out his cousin too. It started to get busy, but he managed the crowd well as the only server. He did seem to get a little caught up chatting at a young gal's table a few times.  ;)

Food: when you check in, you get a few Horchata, which is a cinnamon sweet rice drink...it was very good, but a tad sweet for me. 
Since there were 6 of us, Berto suggested the giant mixed platter for 4. He said to substitute with a few appetizers, which we chose Shrimp Empanadas, and Ceviche at his suggestion. 
The ceviche was a huge portion and was very delicious. The shrimp empanadas were good, but I filled up on one. Should have saved more room for the seafood platter.  
The platter was amazing. There was plenty for 4 people...could have fed 6!  I liked everything I tasted on it. It had several kinds of shrimp, clams, crab legs, scallops, imitation crab, and fish. I think the fried fish was my favorite, but all of it was amazing!!!!!!
Also, I have to give a shout out to the homemade corn tortillas, the tasty tortilla chips, the salsa, and the best was the green sauce on the side. We asked for a 5 out of 10 and it was nice and spicy, and had a great citrus flavor. I loved this sauce!!!

There was a fifteen minute wait which is not bad when you see how tiny it is in there. The wait was totally totally worth it. There were five of us and got our orders right away. Everything was delicious and full of flavor. The servings were big enough to share with the table and the prices were decent. Don't let the wait scare you it is worth it. AND there is a bakery next door where you can get free smells while you wait for your table.,LDPVkNDhdYNw1HlXAEEKsw,3,0,5,SpTnJPOmNLu3fddRwtn65A
4535164,2015-03-23,0,YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,What do you eat after a night out drinking and feeling a little hungover? Yup! seafood and a beer. We drove about 15 min off the strip for this place that my friend recommended. It's a little hole in the wall in a shopping center that you would not notice it was there. We walked in and got seated and were brought out chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and crispy and salsa was delicious and spicy. We all ordered and I had a shrimp cocktail and a ceviche tostada de pescado. It took a while for our food to arrive because we were a table of 9. To start we also had agua chiles that were fresh and spicy and enjoyable. My michelada was very good and hit the spot. A little spicy but not to much and nice salty rim to compliment the beer. It was a good experience and the staff was very friendly and always asking if we were ok.

In an ancient strip mall in an old part of town, it  doesn't look appealing from the outside. 
Heck, if not for the reviews on Yelp I wouldn't have set foot in this place. 

Luckily we did and had one of the best meals we've had in a long time. I don't give tons of reviews and most if not all are 5, but we go tons of places.

My friend has raved about this hidden little restaurant since we met. 

The restaurant is definitely smaller than I anticipated but the service was pretty decent.

Useful Tip: Brace yourself! The complimentary salsa is hot af!  

*Half dozen oysters were loaded with ceviche and the presentation was delightful. Regrettably, the oysters were a bit gritty and stuck inside the shell making it not so sexy to devour during date.  
*Camarones al la diabla was a simple and safe Pescatarian choice. The menu has a variety of items but my Spanish is pretty non existent so I opted for items with pictures. The shrimp was pretty bland. No bold hidden flavors.

Don't let the fact that it's in a slightly sketchy part of town and in a run down strip mall scare you off. They also close kinda early, but trust me it's so very worth it. 

We decided we were going to split everything because everything on the menu sounded amazing.Of course we used our Yelp check-in offer of a free Horchata. Normally i'm not a big Horchata fan, but this was homemade and delicious. The chips and salsa set the tone of awesomeness right away.
Ultimately we decided on starting with the Shrimp Empanadas. Next, Seafood Molcajetes and the A La Diabla Filete. The Shrimp Empanadas came out steaming hot, crisp and full of shrimp. You get three in an order and they are truly little pockets of goodness. When the Molcajete came out we were both shocked! They serve it in a heavy stone mortar that is super hot. It was filled to the brim with seafood, broth and completely covered in cheese!! It had crab legs, clams, shrimp and fish. The broth had a great spice to it. It was like nothing I've had before. It got even better when the La Diabla Filete came to the table. It's a whole deep fried fish (Yes, head, tail and all.) and they cover it in a spicy red sauce. This was excellent. The flavor of the sauce and the tender fish made a great combination. I could not stop myself from picking at it even after I was full.
Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is super friendly as well. Even though we were still eating past closing they didn't try to rush us out at all. I love family owned businesses and this place has great charm all around.

For starters, I must say the have probably THE BEST CHIPS AND SALSA I've ever had, true authentic flavors with a Spicy slap in the face- so beware if you can't handle the heat too well. We thought it best to get a bunch of side items instead of the combo plates which was a great idea. 

Must have: Shrimp Empanadas. 

The seafood molcajete was unbelievable! Comes served in a hot stone bowl, shrimp, clam, nopales(cactus), green peppers, onions, cheese. This is enough for two people to share. I recommend ordering a side of rice to pour the food on, rather than eating w tortillas.. Be sure to order an extra set of plates. 

Also tried a ceviche tostada, which is also enough to be shared by two people. The rice and beans are delicious too! Tasty alcoholic drinks are available, such as Micheladas. 

The menu is varied so Definitely coming back again!",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,12,7,5,46hxynq1wjJKM-nNf9dJ8w

First it's located in a sketchy area. It's noted it opens at 10:30, but it was locked they didn't open till 11. The other stores around there are kinda old and beat.

I have no idea why a restaurant would take out a table on your busiest night and put a band in there.  I love live music, but this place is way to small for a band - way too small.  It actually made the dining experience unpleasant.

I had the combo ceviche - and that was awesome.  The ceviche was fresh and we devoured it!  Also had steak fajitas.  They were okay, the steak didn't seem to have much flavor, but it was still good.

So as far as we were concerned they just raised the price on the beer to $6 to cover for the BOGO.  We could have had 4 imports for $16. So we really only got 1 free.

I love Michelada's and have had some of the best around the state. Yeah, funny that I didn't say Mexico, because I sadly didn't get to discover the awesomeness of Michelada while I was traveling out there. Yes, shame on me. Now you can start throwing rocks and food at me for that. 

I chose to mix my Michelada with Negra Modelo. They say this is the best combo so I thought, why not go with the best. 
The one I had here was mehhh. It was missing some lime, and the ratio of clamato and beer was a bit off for me. 

We ordered the giant mixed platter for 4...this can feed 6 people in my opinion. It had imitation crab, real crab (delicious by the way) and shrimp three ways (as a sampler), scallops, clams, and fried fish. The crab (which I think is fried?)  had a great marinade and was delicious. My favorite was the Shrimp Diablo. The flavors in it were so amazing, I'd definitely come back and order this. 

I love ceviche, but he one we ordered was a bit too raw for me. 

Shrimp empanada- I didn't like this very much, as the outer dough part was too mushy/soggy for me, and I prefer my empanadas to have a little crisp and crunch. The inside shrimp filling was delicious. 

The horchata was dang good. The check-in offer is one per table FYI. 
Chocolate cake was simple, yet moist and delicious.

If they are busy it does take a minute for big parties to be seated but well worth the wait!    We had the tacos de marlin, tacos de camaron, empanadas, Agua chile was one of the best & most traditional preparations I have had outside of Mexico.   We will be back for sure!!!!   Saludos y gracias por la comida excellente!!",e9EI-7qLx_mzI98eHfs6yQ,0,0,5,cwltA1cI4dXVHU_HYCn2Eg

I always get the Camerones a la Diabla.  I eat this dish at many mexican restaurants and this place makes it great.  I love that it isn't loaded with salt like a lot of places...just loaded with flavor!,Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,5,gU-yzbO-g0G3FPU1UGRbtw
