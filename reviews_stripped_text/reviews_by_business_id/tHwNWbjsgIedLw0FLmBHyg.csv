33309,2012-12-19,0,tHwNWbjsgIedLw0FLmBHyg,This is my favorite pizza place in Vegas. I've probably ate here about 10-15 times in the last 7 years. I just love how cheesy it is and hot crispy the crust is. If you are around Circus Circus you have to try the pizza. Price is good and size is good. They fill it up with toppings. Service is good also.,Oh3-OlNtJr3puD0Px5c94g,0,0,5,D_fepXQzBIhtIuybuzIahw

It is to avoid any other interaction with staff after receiving a sub par product. The location is high volume. I don't mind waiting, but was very disappointed. The pizza was flavorless with low quality ingredients. The truly frustrating facts was that the pizza was not   Cut all the way into slices. The cut was only partially visible in the cheese and did not penetrate to the crust.  There was no one available to resolve the situation. A major let down considering we payed 40 dollars for two medium pizzas. Another annoying aspect were the trick tea urns.

445891,2011-08-23,1,tHwNWbjsgIedLw0FLmBHyg,"I'm going to TRY to limit my review to this ""restaurant"" and avoid going into a rant about the casino it's located in based on the fact that it's inside the stain upon society known as Circus Circus. Again, I'll try. No promises.

So, I had never been inside Circus Circus and really only went because my boyfriend and I both had never been and felt like we needed to go just because we live here and make fun of it all the time and yeah...

Basically, Circus Circus was just as gross as we thought it would be and long story short, we were hungry and decided to just get something inside the casino. We picked this pizza place since it was midnight and it was one of the few restaurants still opened. 

The staff at the order counter were nice enough but the food was extremely overpriced. I ordered a 6 inch personal cheese pizza and my boyfriend got a meatball sandwich. We also both got drink cups. The total was over $22.00. 

Uhmmmm... it's a personal pizza, a sandwich, and two fountain drinks AND inside Circus Circus... where do they get off charging this much? I thought this casino was where all the broke ass families on a budget go. How can they charge this much and get business based on the clientele inside this dump?

Nevermind the prices, it's Vegas, it's nothing new. HOWEVER, this food was beyond nasty tasting. It wasn't just like ""Oh, this tastes kinda fake but secretly I kinda like it (i.e. Dominos pizza)."" It literally tasted like how melted plastic smells. 

I forced down half of it just because it was so overpriced but after I saw that my boyfriend wasn't eating his sandwich for the same reasons, we just admitted that our food was gross as fuck and decided to go.

I don't really give a crap about service because we weren't having to pay a waitress or anything since it was order-at-the-counter style. However, the people running the dining room area basically pushed us out of the place because it was close to closing time. They shut down the soda machine like 30 minutes early and as we were finishing up, a lady came over and was like, ""Do you want a box for that stuff?"" We declined and she assumed we meant we were going to finish eating it so she said, ""Well you need to get one cause we're closing so you can't stay here."" It was just rude but we were on our way out so I didn't really care. Nonetheless, don't push customers out of the place cause you want to go home RIGHT at closing time.

Overall, this place is a ripoff and really nasty tasting. I don't know what all the other reviewers are talking about when they say this place is amazing. I'm not a picky eater when it comes to fast food like hamburgers and pizza - I understand it's not going to be phenomenal but this place was just awful. The food tasted like the ingredients had expired. 

Congrats Circus Circus, you fulfilled all my expectations.",vtVVJyHnZUTaY7WEhOuPrg,1,1,1,belYruuvt7GtBoUe7YKdSg

My siblings and I would usually visit this place during our stay at Circus Circus. Although we've had this place many times before, it has never been THIS bad. 

It all started off when we entered the line to order before getting seated. This was at around 9:00 pm. The line was a little long, so we expected to only wait AT MAX 30 minutes because there wasn't that many people ahead of us. BUT NO. The cashier seemed to have taken 30 minutes on ONE party of people, and was scrambling around to find things. This led to no progress on the line whatsoever. A few minuets later, my family and I started to notice tables were emptying, yet the line was not moving. When another 30 minuets passed, we finally reached the front of the line. The cashier apologized for the wait and asked for our order. We ordered a ""midway meat medley"" but he didn't seem to know what it was. He stared at the screen for what seemed like a minute, and kept asking us, until he finally got it. We then got our number and was seated.

It didn't end there..

As my family and I sat at the booth, ANOTHER 30 minutes passed, and our pizza was nowhere to be seen. My sister asked one of the workers to check on the pizza, and the worker returned saying it was in the oven. We then sat down for another 30 MINUTES and pizza finally came. At this point, we were starving and we started eating. When I wanted to refill my soda cup, I noticed the floor is covered with pizza sauce and oil, to a point where I almost slipped. When I returned to my table, there was even a knife on the floor, that for the almost 2 hours I was there, no staff member (even as I saw them look at it) picked it up.

Highly disappointed and annoyed.",hhTt2S3I4lDChiQvToKb3g,2,0,1,krhGNSjHvuuv_nva2zJPdQ

I arrived at 11pm, only for a Caesar salad, no chicken..typically with dine in service it takes about 5 minutes to arrive, sometimes less. I wanted one for my daughter for take out service, I figured with only 2 people ahead of me, I would be in and out of there in a few minutes. Guess how long it took? 30 minutes wait time, no apology or acknowledgement from staff who were not doing anything since nobody was really there. I asked several times what was the hold up and kept getting the same reply, it's on it's way, it's on it's way. That's a crappy way to treat a loyal customer, now I know what the other Yelpers who left a poor review are referring to. So, with that said..do what you want with this review, I'm not exaggerating in any way..see for yourself. 

I found the same quality Caesar Salad at Westside Deli which tells me they are all pre-made and packaged with same dressing, etc. That just tells me that here at Pizzeria they had it packaged and could have had me on my way within minutes but I was intentionally ignored for whatever reason. Little marks like this make a big difference especially when I've been a patron for well over ten years. 
Mulling things over, I decided this review is accurate and based on the fact I spent 75 dollars the day prior on 2 small 12 inch pizzas, 2 drinks and 2 salads..this gives me reason to move forward and order my pizza elsewhere, not a value at all .

Summer 2016

Adventuredome is exhausting!!! What was I thinking when I bought an All Day Pass?!?! I needed a break after two rides with my toddler! 

Since my nephews joined us, I thought pizza would be a great snack for everybody. They agreed. We found Pizzeria by the main casino and I was bummed when I saw a long waiting line. After 15 minutes we were at the register and we ordered a 16"" pepperoni pizza. Hooray for free refills! We waited another 10-15 minutes until it was served on our table. 

The pizza was pretty decent. It was very cheesy and I liked how it wasn't  too soggy. I wish the crust was crispier, though. One of my nephews mentioned,""This is good but the pizza from the liquor store is way better. Do you guys remember that place?"" Of course, I remember! He was talking about Giants NY Pizza and Subs in Oregon. I totally agree but Pizzeria is conveniently located in Circus Circus. The pepperoni pizza was a sufficient snack before running around in Adventuredome with my toddler again!

Everything in Vegas is more expensive than it should be. So, I get it... but for what we got, I felt it was a fair deal. Considering the other hotels had their brunches starting at $50 per person. I ordered a salad and just had water. It was very weird that they had no glasses for water. Sandra found me like a Circus Circus shot glass type of glass for water. I had to go back several times to quench my thirst. Very odd. But all in all...

They were hustling in the back and food came out quick and when you are hungry and the lines are so long everywhere else and the buffets are closed or you have to pay over $50 for a meal...it is a good deal. My salad was good and it was a pretty hearty portion. Sandra and the other staff members are the reason that they got 4 stars. I saw how hard they were working to please all of their tables and in the back they were on fire to get the food out as quickly as possible. Sandra had a genuine personality even though no one was leaving her a tip, I watched 3 tables get up and not even leave a few bucks on the table. We finished our meal and I did the right thing and found her and left her a bigger tip than our bill required. You should have seen the look on her face. She smiled so big and said thank you so very much. I told her, thank you. I see how hard you work. I know what it is like to bust your tail like that...I have been in the service industry.

Their form of pesto = basil and pine nuts on the pizza, not bad at all. We ordered the pesto pizza with pepperoni, but they accidentally made us a regular pepperoni pizza.... 10-15 minutes later, we had our correct pizza.

Like any dining area in a casino, there is not smoking, but it's close enough to the casino area where players can easily light a cigarette. 

Overall, the service was friendly, the price was decent, the dining area was comfy and clean. You can't ask for much more from a restaurant operating inside a casino. 

Pro tip: there's a Foursquare offer if you check in.
