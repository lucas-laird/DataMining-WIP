was good when the father founder ran it. Now they are hateful to unhappy customers. If you
want to throw your money away and...like...every service call just hand over $5,000 for a new unit...well, you get the picture.  The business as I see it this year is only happy with their hands in your pocket...the one with all the money they think everyone should have. Save yourself from an ulcer and look further than this for a reputable company. It doesn't exist here any longer.  If not the first visit..it will happen..but don't tell them you are unhappy.,.,.they want unhappy customers to just go away.. In our community we have over 400 owners and I will be pleased to be sure they all hear about the company as it now exists....not how the original founder and owner envisioned it. Be careful ...that hand in your pocket just might not be yours.

UPDATE: Since the above visit, the owner called and assured me he would be out to check our system. Never came or called (not surprised since the woman who answers the phone is his wife and hates any caller complaints.  But my update also concerns her who does the bookwork. Since the visit was unexpected extremely costly, we paid the bill divided between
a personal check and a credit card.  Well, what do you suppose happened?  This company
first charged the entire bill (over $500) on our credit card and also cashed our check. Then
for some reason the mistake was found and 2 days later the over $500 was taken out and the proper amount was charged. So my credit card got to charge me 2 extra days interest on an
amount that should never have gone to them.  Stay away from this company.

I used to be a fan and believed in this company but it has changed and completely for the worst! The original Anderson who started the company must be turning over in this grave.
He was honest and never nasty to customers and did not overcharge....ever.
How they got themselves on Angies List, I'll never know but they do not belong there if it
is truly a business that only allows honest companies to get referrals. Just remembered that Angies List says this place gives Senior Discount.  Never saw it in all the years used them .start with a lie to Angies List and where do they go from there?

Call at your own risk and do not say you were not warned. Thumbs down!!!!!",4BSySBDTOujmL22MhYTLwQ,1,0,1,PtuM1qfQox4_phRpvg-Okw

They told me the compressor was shot and I needed a new one: cost $3400.00. Called Anderson Air, talked at length with the owner Tom, whose father started the company in 1976. We discussed all possible options and I requested a service rep. come out to investigate my problem. Turns out it WAS NOT the compressor at all but a ""run cap"" which needed replacement. Total cost of repair was $215.00!",s_Bj02n-ZtNVM89C_89RdQ,0,0,5,TvzKAW47wSlvAysPSRnXQw
890486,2015-05-11,0,pBL32_x4eWZ6Pt4MFoEJLQ,"Many years ago I asked someone who worked for Nevada Power to recommend a reliable company that wouldn't rip me off. She gave me two names. I called Anderson. They have been my company ever since, Their service charge is in line with everyone else, their service techs are professional and they are honest (Wow!). 

Let me tell you a little story -- a few years back at the beginning of the long New Year's weekend, our heat went out. Anderson came out right away and turns out we needed a new motor. Problem was that their supplier was closed for the next 3 days. This was one of those bitterly cold years when it froze every night. The repairman (and it might have been Tom, the owner) asked if we had any space heaters. No, we don't. He then drove back to his office across town and returned 90 minutes later with 2 space heaters for us to use until they could repair the heat pump. A very kind thing to do -- way above and beyond what any ""big"" company would do. 

I highly recommend Anderson. You can trust them.

I see a bad review here and am puzzled because in all the years I have been using them, Anderson has always been honest with me. (Also gave me a plumbing tip that unclogged a stubborn drain and saved me an $85 plumber's fee. Thanks, guys!)",Jy9LdvAHx39Jk8mZS6bm0g,1,0,5,-8hNaOCisXDJFRmpC9l2CA

Mind you I know that there is a substantial mark up on parts from a repair facility, Double, maybe more. I have used Anderson air for years and recommended them to others. Last time. the next time I want to get screwed out of $300 I'll go to Pa rump.",8_Mo5EkqWbR1rrUZ_CmZAg,0,0,1,_LoarIcfG9-l3ckaJbn50w

They sent a tech within an hour and he fixed our unit within 20 minutes. He was clean and professional. Their pricing is very competitive. The lady who answered the phone, Renee, was super sweet and set everything up right away. She truly treated me like I was her only customer and that my problem was hers to handle. I have been a customer of theirs for over 16 years and trust no-one else in town. They NEVER up-sell anything, service or products. They are family owned and operated. They are honest and dependable. If you want to have an AC company that will treat you like family, this is it. Thank you Anderson Air for awesome service!!",DE25ExE64iEzB9H0JUwEAw,0,0,5,UwIsogYiaHQy2iP7LlU-WA
4189107,2016-03-23,1,pBL32_x4eWZ6Pt4MFoEJLQ,"First off they worked on the wrong air conditioner(the one that worked). Replaced the fan and charged quite a bit. He worked fairly unsafe standing on the handle of my ladder which I was even cautious about him doing. After the service of him working on the wrong air conditioner  he said he might even have to charge us more for a wire. Honestly it was a horrible experience and am still calling different companies to fix the other air conditioner which he told me had to be replaced. I wouldn't of had a problem if he just worked on the right air conditioner in the first place then blame me for it.

Update: I had a second air company come out. The tech for Anderson air left loose wires on the air conditioner which sparked. The fan that he replaced(on the wrong air conditioner) was quoted at $200 less by the other company.

All in all I would have to say avoid this company at all costs.",PBW0MBZXtEdxLasdPtKJ6A,1,0,1,JuHbakYNzcLmxkoUbfWQMQ

Our air went out right when it starts to get too hot here.  With three small pets and a 3 year old, we needed it fixed ASAP.  After having a few other companies come out, Tom (the owner) agreed with replacing the unit as an option, but he recommended a fast, cheap fix to try first.  When that didn't work, he tried to find us another pre-owned unit to save us money!  His estimate of a brand new unit with warranty was so fair we just went with that option.  He reserved a crane and crew to come out the next day!  

They get things done, and they do it well.  The crew who installed were just as efficient and professional.  I am beyond impressed with Tom and his business.  Customer service is rarely a focus for businesses anymore, they make it a priority.  We even got a follow up call to make sure we were enjoying it!",y7gYGCAEHjqjw9FqeZKg7Q,2,1,5,dXnnY8i6JZPv-fmNAJznXQ
