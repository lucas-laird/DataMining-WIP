They seem annoyed to be there every time and don't have a positive attitude. We went there today and the girls name tag said ""Fireman"" and she had such a poor attitude it ruined the experience. The food is delicious but I think it's worth it to go somewhere else and feel welcome.",YfEHCuAo59OTkaCR0aSlyg,0,0,2,rqcKaIZtOHGcswcWa0WCJw

We were in the mood for Acai Bowls. I chose the Sea Sider & my husband chose the Red Zinger. Sea Sider was good but had very little granola or fresh fruit. The Red Zinger tasted too much of ginger for me but over all both had a generous amount of Acai smoothie blend.

Cute & clean location that offers wifi.",gITluIdpx1Ed_vPySoN1BA,0,0,4,4EQrcyyhAgwI9Cm5HWigyA
3726767,2016-03-12,1,0S2fiheNzQLDSCs89Kmgnw,"I was so disappointed!  I thought I was getting a bowl with fruit on top of the acai and there was only a few banana pieces and hardly any granola.

I recommend the acai bowl at Rachels kitchen a few doors down if you want the real deal.  Or the one in Waikiki Beach but that will cost you a plane fare.",QZleAB0LVYrim9kT8liFLg,0,0,2,UPPhjApOFfIshfQglhZByA

So I came here again on 4/11/16 for lunch after looking at the competition's prices. Bowlology is far more reasonably priced than any other place in the area (mostly juice and smoothie bars). The price Bowlology charges for their large is in most cases less than what the other places charge for their smallest size. I loved my first experience here and now that I'm more enlightened about the pricing of acai bowls, I think this place deserves 5 stars.

Additionally, my second experience was even more fantastic than the first. There was a sweet girl that helped me decide what to order. First, I knew I wanted the PB lover and she recommended pitaya instead of acai so I did that. I've changed my diet to mostly vegan (and I maintain 100% vegan on weekdays) so I was concerned about the chocolate in the bowl. She went to the back to check the ingredients and we confirmed that it was not vegan. She was however able to use the vegan raw cacao powder in the bowl instead. She also dusted the top of the bowl with this powder instead of the honey drizzle. She did all this with a smile and did not seem inconvenienced at all. Excellent customer service!

The bowl, which I ordered a large of, was once again delicious. I shared some with my brother and he thought it was amazing as well. I will definitely keep coming back! I hope they change their name on Yelp soon so this can be a proper review of the new company.",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,2,0,5,UI-IFwGmiSM842ZFrWKhgQ

I find the similar dishes are better at Acai to the T in Summerlin. I would really like this location but they are more expensive for less product. The blending stations are extremely loud.

5319975,2016-03-10,4,0S2fiheNzQLDSCs89Kmgnw,"I like Bowl of Heaven a lot. The consistency of their Acai bowls is superb. The one I normally go to is across the street from school. I'm not sure if they treat me better at that location than here because I go there a lot. But the point is service is not the same. The good thing about this location, I must say, is that they open early (7am)...but this is not my usual morning route so, it doesn't really matter to me.

My favorites include: Sea Sider, Peanut Butter, North Shore, and Sunset. Whatever the choice may be, I like adding protein because I need it. The granola they use stays crunchy.

You get points for being a regular customer. They have bars, dried fruit, and other health foods.

I just wish the people that work here would smile more and at least pretend to be friendly.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,5,7,3,6smtK3m4f1B3tVHsImxiYw
