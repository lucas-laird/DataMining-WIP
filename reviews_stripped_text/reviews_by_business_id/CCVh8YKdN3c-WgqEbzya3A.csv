The ""market"" offers a decent selection of snack food and drinks to grab and go or to keep in your room, but definitely pricey when compared to what you pay for the same items in a grocery store, but of course, its Vegas. 

Two secrets: First one, go to the fitness center for your juice and smoothie selections. One bottled brand in particular was a dollar cheaper in the fitness center. Second, if you desire picking up food for your room and have the time, go 2 miles south to the Whole Foods Market. Sure you spend 15-20 on a cab, but you can grab whatever you'd like for your food, fresh produce included, for half the price of what the market offers.

Comfortable seating area as well, which is nice to have so close to your hotel room. Overall, great selection of food, beverages, desserts, and souvenirs.",E9LKlL08nn4IAToQfcqu6g,1,0,4,w_PmQe0UBOWEVKQSM5UdAw

The way the menu reads it says that all the sandwiches come with fries and when you substitute a side salad it replaces these fries.  The sandwich description says it comes with soup but it doesn't say it does not come with fries.  

So I thought I was getting a grilled cheese sandwich, soup, and side salad.  And this was going to be around $15.  I get just the sandwich and the side salad and the person at the counter simply says that the menu means there is soup instead of fries.  That alone would be unacceptable because it isn't what the menu says.

In addition, I took the sandwich up to my room and the thing was disgusting.  It was somewhat burnt on both sides and I think maybe there were two pieces of cheese on it.  That is not even worth $3 nonetheless $15.

Any bodega in New York can out do this place, any. Yea, it's a bit cheaper than the average price of food in and around the strip but not worth it at all. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese on a bagel yet something as simple as that they couldn't get right. The eggs were definitely the same eggs I'd get at mcdonalds, the bagel was chewy and old. The time it took to come out was way too long.

It's not just the sandwiches that have this crappy egg product, no sir. My friend ordered the heuvos rancheros and it had these rubbery eggs in them as well. 

Furthermore, I think the management at this place is just amateur. They give people table numbers, even though it's to-go, and yet they don't even check the numbers, they just yell out the numbers and expect you to hear it.

My shrimp wrap was pretty good; although it was mostly salad which may not fly as well with some other people.

Too bad I couldn't have any *shakes fist at my fried food ban!* :( The portions are decently large as well.

We also purchased some booze from here for some quick pre-gaming. The vino ran $40 for a randoz bottle, Veuve Cliquot was the cheapest bottle of bubbly for around $70. They also sell cute little pastries and cupcakes, which we picked up for one of the gals' birthdays :)

The staff here are amazing! When you walk up to the counter they greet you and don't rush you to make a decision. And provide recommendations. 
Some issues was the seating. It is a small space so seating does get full. Like on busy days, weekends, it is hard to get a seat. And the food takes a while to be prepared.

Obviously the market stuff is overpriced (sure, if I want low prices I can just walk to the other side of the Strip to get stuff at Walgreens or CVS), this one is only convenient if you're heading upstairs to your suite and forgot something - I mean, how can you live without chipotle-flavored hummus?!?. 
But the real problem is the attitude of the staff: we had a MyVegas 2-for-1 breakfast offer (which is not really a 2-for-1, but only a $15 credit) and asked the concierge to redeem it, he was super nice and told us that everything was set, to go to the Market Cafe and get our food. When we got there, the waiting time for seating was 15/20 minutes (they only have few tables) so we asked the lady there if we could get our 2-for-1 breakfast to go and she said we could pick anything from the menu or from the counters with our offer, so we picked muffins, sandwiches, juice and yogurt and when we got to the cash, they told us it was not valid, we could only pick stuff from the menu... then we picked something and they weren't able (or willing to) use our offer, we headed back to the concierge and explained, he went with us to the cashier and after about 20 minutes of going back and forth we couldn't get our breakfast because of some sort of problem with their system - and the Cafe staff couldn't care less if we stayed or not, they seemed bothered by the requests, so my advice if you're planing to use your MyVegas rewards here (or spending your money here) is don't, go elsewhere where they'll at least know about it.",Qe7dwOKdAI_J6Z4XmupOvw,1,1,1,77fGbGB1HMWKRkB-sh1sUQ

Initially I was looking in the refrigerator area to look for something i could grab quickly and take back to my room but unfortunately, there wasn't much in there. They had a bunch of cheese and cracker packages as well as some frozen microwavable food but nothing that was ready to eat. 

I then make my way to the counter and figured I could just order a burger and bring it upstairs. I ordered the chicken sandwich with fries and got it to go. It took about 12-15 minutes for the food to come out but it was boxed up and in a bag for me along with some ketchup. They also gave me some ranch upon request.

I took the food back and ate it in my room. The chicken sandwich was decent. Like most of the other food in the hotels I ate on this trip, nothing special to write about other than, it wasn't bad but i've definitely had better. The prices were expected inside the hotel, about $15 for the chicken sandwich if I remember correctly.

My only problem is that they (as in the employees at the cafÃ©) do not give you what you exactly order. Now, I know this is not a big deal, but it irks me when I place an order and tell them what I specifically do not want, and they give it to me anyway. 

For example, the first time I stopped here for breakfast, I asked for just bacon and eggs. No potato and no bread. I told them that I couldn't eat it and that I don't mind paying extra for items that I will not be receiving. Of course when my food came out, what did I have on my plate, potatoes and bread. Sadly I had to waste the food and throw it away. This could have been simply avoided if they actually listed to me. 

Then the second time I came here for breakfast (I thought I would give it a second chance) I said the same thing. I even told them about my first experience and they promised me that they would not give me potatoes and bread. But of course when it came out, I got it.

1. Overpriced: bad bagel with smoked salmon, all but undrinkable coffee and a weirdly heavy pistachio macaroon: 15 dollars.  
2. Very, very slow and disorganized. 
3. Worst coffee of my life--a tie with Burger Heaven which serves bilge water but I drink it anyway because I like the people who work there and it's on my street in NYC. 

Market Cafe is intended to provide an alternative to the 20 dollar omelets and other breakfast foods in or out of the room. Admirable, but frankly, Doubletree and Hyatt Regency charge 15 for omelets (not in the room which is more), so their breakfast prices are not that out of line with the regular overpriced breakfast fare in hotels. 

The omelets looked okay but not great. I heard the scones look better than they taste. The sandwiches are clearly your best bet here and you likely can take them out to the pool. The macaroons are not traditional: they're extremely heavy and more like straight marzipan. I had one (pistachio) and was unimpressed. 

Beyond that, it's incredibly slow. I saw a blonde runner about my age, who didn't know there was a marathon this weekend either and has been to Vegas a ""bazillion times."" She says Market Cafe service always pretty much sucks and that the bagels aren't bagels (true). 

I loved her very large and gorgeous wedding band/engagement room. I'll say more about the Vdara, which like a handful of other hotels in Vegas, strives to make you forget you are in fact in Vegas. Even the casino and slots at neighboring Aria are civilized and the very reverse of the traditional casino on the other side of the Strip. 

My salmon on ""bagel"" with capers, onions, cream cheese and chive was 8.75, which is not that much. But the coffee is 4 dollars and I don't know how you manage to make coffee WORSE than Burger Heaven in NYC, but the Market Cafe has managed to do so. 

Service overall at the Vdara is impeccable and I never , well, yes at some point, want to leave this 570 foot room, which I did not get to enjoy until 12:38 AM when I finally checked in after the closure of the Strip for that stupid idiotic marathon they could just as well put in the middle of nowhere or suburbs but choose rather to put in the center of town, thereby shutting Vegas down for the day.

Everything on the menu feels especially expensive compared to non-vegas pricing but I felt like the portions and quality of food justify the pricing. At least you're not paying $14 for a crappy continental breakfast through room service.

My husband and I were staying here with some friends. Little did I know that this hotel is pushed back off the strip and the furthest hotel in the City Center. Also I didn't realize that there was no casino! We received a $100 food/beverage credit with booking the room. Granted the food credit is usable within most of City Center (not Crystals or Cosmopolitan since they're owned by another hotel and not part of the MGM). Either way we thought it might be good to try another hotel within City Center since we stayed at Aria last time. However the ONLY restaurant in Vdara is this Market Cafe. So you can imagine it gets busy because of the convenience. 

However both times we've come here there was lots of people sitting at the tables waiting for their food to arrive. We never saw a steady stream of food coming out. The food service was super super slow. But I just read another reviewer said that room service for Vdara guests all comes from Market Cafe also! Maybe that's why theyr'e super slow because they're servicing the people eating in the cafe and the entire hotel for room service. 

We ordered two items -patty melt sandwich and the breakfast burrito and we probably waited 20 min? Another person waiting complained to the service people that they had waited probably 40 min! Holy moly! 

The second time we came here we ordered the pre-made sandiwches and I think they just heat them up, so it's sooo much faster! And in my opinion those pre-made sandwiches were way better and yummier! My favorite was the chicken sandwich with a aioli sauce maybe chipotle? Whatever it is, it was delicious with roasted bell peppers too and the chicken wasn't dry! The other favorite was the Italian with salami and other yumminess! We also had the tuna melt and that was okay in my opinion, not a lot of tuna meat in my opinion. 

The other items here at the market are like what other reviewers stated that you can buy wine, frozen foods, juice, fruit, etc... Or you can place order at hte counter for foods or smoothies and coffees. 

Oh yeah and we got the smoothies, I got the mango one and it was yummy but on the sweeter side. My husband got the berry smoothie and it was good as well but more tangy with lots of seeds.

One thing is that there isn't really a waiting area, so all you can really do is loiter around and wait till your order came. This was really ineffective because we couldn't go too far - it would have been better if they had a beeper system. We were told that our order would take 15 minutes, but ended up being 30 minutes.

After about 5 minutes of waiting I went up and asked about my sandwich and then some lady told me that I ordered a club sandwich that's made from the kitchen and that it would be out soon. If there's two different types of club sandwiches..shouldn't you ask and specify which one I want..anyways kinda annoyed but I waited standing up cause I thought it would come out soon.

WRONG. Fckin stood there for like 30-40 minutes.
Then finally saw a bunch of togo orders coming out and everyone got there order but me..
Until I had to ask someone again to check up on my order, and the guy says ""Someone just came out with your order, let me go find her"" 

UGH R U SERIOUS.
3 minutes later, finally got my sandwich.

The chicken was a good piece of meat and the combo of tastes, textures, and a kick of heat went really well together.

Cons: service is ok, not terrible and it takes forever to get your food

Well, the food is pretty good...if you don't mind waiting 30 minutes or longer for it. My bf and I are staying at the hotel and thought we would go down and get some breakfast to go. There was only one person in line ahead of us and they got a coffee and a pastry. I ordered the ""Skinny Scramble"" which is literally scrambled eggs and veggies thrown in together. Nothing complicated. He got a bagel with bacon egg and cheese which he got right away. 

After 20 minutes of waiting we said something and I watched the lady pick up the phone and basically reorder my food. By this time his bagel was cold so we asked for a new one. The one they gave us seemed a bit greasy, but we didn't think much of it. I finally got my food and the lady was nice enough to give me a fruit cup for free (which here is $6). While we were waiting, there were also other people waiting forever for their food and they too had to go say something and then and only then did they get their food.

So...the bagel was so greasy it was literally falling apart. My scramble was amazing, but it definitely looked a little rushed. 

This place is consistent in that, the food is really good, but it takes forever to get it. We actually went here last night and it took forever, again, to get our food and he got a grilled cheese and I got gnocchi (potatoes) with meat sauce.

The not so nice part of Market Cafe is that the food (appears) comes from room service.  At least every meal that I saw being served was wrapped in plastic and covered with room service trays.  This process caused some issues.  One was that it took an extremely long time for our meal to arrive and food that should have been crispy was instead soggy and limp. 

This was unfortunate for my husband because he ordered a meal with potatoes and bacon.  Unfortunately, the bacon was not crispy nor were the potatoes.  This was the first time I haven't seen my husband finish a meal.  It was pretty sad.  He offered me a taste and I had to decline to save myself.

I ordered oatmeal and greek yogurt with fruit and granola.  Both dishes were plentiful and I wasn't able to finish either one of them.  They were both tasty too.  My granola was lacking in crunch but I was okay with it because I didn't have to deal with limp bacon and sweaty potatoes.

It may be a bit on a small side and a little too close to the lobby area, but when you seat on the back you stop noticing this things. It seems cosy. The local is nearly always packed but I never had to wait for a table more than a few minutes. There isn't much of the decor, it looks like a part of the coffee chain, but still has a good vibe. And the smell is always great, fresh coffee and juice. The waiters are awfully nice, lots of smiles and tips about the food. It takes them about 15 minutes to bring the food, but the place is always packed so...

The breakfast selection is wide. Few skillets, eggs any style, buttermilk pancakes, waffles, french toasts, breakfast tacos, steak and eggs, chicken and waffles, biscuit and gravy. Pretty much everything you fancy eating. And I love a juice of the day offer, it's always good and interesting - like carrot, orange and ginger. I also made a mistake of ordering the french toast with berries on my first day. It was soooo soooo yummy that now nothing compares! I ate fried eggs and I ate eggs benedict with bacon and spinach and it was all very good, but I still crave the toasts every day, and I don't even like eating sweet things in the morning! So be warned, it's addicting.

I also liked the fact that they had a little shelf filled with drugstore necessities like nail clippers, make up remover, medicines etc. 

So on to the tea and coffee!! The tea was delicious, the coffee was good but I thought the coffee at Francois Payard at Caesars Palace was much better.

Our scallops were so hard and rubbery that my friend didn't even finish them and ate only the sides, with a bit of reluctance I might add. My filet was grilled on three sides and so dry I was pretty sure I was gnawing bad beef jerky. The vegan pasta was probably single handedly the worst thing we've ever tasted and became a bit of a joke amongst us. Pork belly steamed buns were pretty much candied and unchewable. I will admit out friend did like his burger but this was only after he removed the grilled and burnt bun and said it was over cooked, the lettuce that was offered to him was brown and wilted the tomato was only half of a slice. But I think what tops it all off is the service. Our food took forever and when we expressed our complaints the lady on the phone  she said she was sorry and would be happy to send someone up to grab our food and fix it for us and then we never heard anything else from anyone!!!

Overly priced for bland food although the portion was a good size. The only thing good on each plate were the potatoes AND they made it fresh, I think/hoped. Haha 

I guess it can be confusing to order. As we walked up to the hostess stand she immediately came out from the back to help us. So my cousins friend came down and joined us but she went up to the register to order her food and then sat down with us. She didn't know there was dine-in and take-out. 

I thought the little market area where I saw they had cold cuts to make your own sandwiches (in your room / to go) was a neat idea. Especially if you're tired of spending so much money on dining out while visiting Vegas. 

I wouldn't come back unless I really, really, really have to. I know there is good breakfast somewhere on the strip just a hop and a skip away. 

We got pancakes, chicken and waffles and an omelette. My pancakes tasted like flour straight from the packet. I couldn't even cut it with my fork. I had to slice it back and forth my butter knife which tore the thing apart. I'm no chef but I can make better pancakes at home.

5560479,2017-08-08,1,CCVh8YKdN3c-WgqEbzya3A,"This place is DEFINITELY overpriced when it comes to their food and not for those that are looking for cheap eats/on a budget. We ordered here because we got back to the hotel late after day club and we were too tired to head out to look for food so we came downstairs around 9PM and this place was opened until midnight. Although I am glad that it's conveniently downstairs (I definitely didn't have the energy to walk The Strip to look for food) and it's opened late. I guess you can say, we paid for convenience.

We ordered three meals for me, boyfriend and my friend-- ordered the Classic Vdara Burger ($16.00) that was made with an 8-oz. Grass-Fed Australian Beef Patty, Onions, Tomatoes and Lettuce protein style that came with fries while the boyfriend Classic Pomodoro ($14.00) added chicken (+$4.00-- seriously? $4.00 for chicken??) that included garlic bread and a Club Sandwich ($14.00) that had a side of fries, chicken noodle soup and a tomato basil soup ($6.00ish /each). All of that was $65.00... GG. It better be hella delicious.

When we opened the tray boxes, the food portions was definitely generous, my burger was HUGE. That was the only good thing though, I took a bite out of my burger-- it was REALLY bland. The patty was tasteless like it wasn't even lightly salt and peppered for taste, a little disappointing seeing how much we paid for it. The fries were quite delicious though, lightly seasoned for flavor. It was the only thing that had any taste. The chicken noodle soup had far too much shell pasta (I guess good for some people) and not enough actual soup, but I did enough the tender chicken meat inside and the little soup that I got was pretty as well. I would definitely order that one again.",6nvUppVogRTTwZCgaYCPjw,0,0,3,pRUEqGX6P6O9pqTddLeqeA

I ordered the ""lite"" omelette with avocado, egg whites, potatoes and bacon, along with slices of bread. It was very good and plenty of food for me! My husband ordered oatmeal with a side of fruit. It looked good as well.

+ Food was hot, freshly made
+ Convenient for Vdara guests/residence

I came down here to get some breakfast since I didn't want to walk out in the hot heat at 8AM. I'll tell you what, this place..keyword is CONVENIENCE. I see lots of complaints for the price, but you come here out of CONVENIENCE. I came here, paid $17.30 for one of their breakfast dishes.. it was DAMN good. Was it worth $17.30? I wouldn't say it was, but it WAS worth not having to walk in the heat on the strip.

The ease of just going down the elevator, going there and ordering breakfast then going back to my room to eat it was great. I wasn't bugged by the price at all. The service was also friendly and welcoming. The market itself is very well kept and clean.

Overall, come here if you're lazy like myself and get hungry at times..but don't want to walk. :)",BYPGd5MbjU_ry3KxB0_8bg,2,1,4,6AtHxqiy0cC7QPkhwCHS5Q
5593927,2017-12-13,1,CCVh8YKdN3c-WgqEbzya3A,"I have stayed at Vdara many times over the last 3 years yet it was only recently that I got to check out the Market Cafe. I usually get a breakfast sandwich at the Starbucks in the lobby but opted to get a bagel & cream cheese and a 1L of Smart Water. The bottled water was expensive but we were all out of drinking water in our suite. $7 is STEEP for bottled water. 

The toasted bagel & cream cheese was just ordinary. It was about $4... Again, not cheap. It was nothing special at all. Not sure if I would go there again just for a plain bagel as I can just get that at Starbucks and pay less for essentially the same thing.

I cant comment on the other food they serve. There are some good looking options and people seem to be dining there throughout the day/night so maybe its not that bad. I have read the reviews of many other Yelpers about the place so I am leary to dine-in on full meals at Market Cafe.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,0,0,3,WKiTL2k_aHj0o5vA-dNuHQ

5738809,2018-05-20,0,CCVh8YKdN3c-WgqEbzya3A,"I chose the cafe as a matter of convenience. I really didn't know where to get food for the fam and they were still in bed at the time so I would be delivering breakfast in bed. This was part of my early mornin walk of shame from the casino. I just dropped way too much cash in the Wheel of Fortune slot machine and I needed a plan for breakfast that didn't entail a long walk or an Uber. On the walk of shame back to my room, I remembered seeing a cafe by the elevators. I'm already staying at the Vdara, so why not give it a shot. 

   I put together a nice range of breakfast choices for my crew. I ordered a waffle with stawberry butter on the side. I added an egg white frittata with asparagus. The last 2 dishes I ordered were a standard 2 egg breakfast with roasted potatoes and last but certainly not least, I got avocado toast that had a Southwest kinda feel. 

   The process was easy, the cafe is simple to navigate with paper and flat screen menus. They have an assortment of market staples, plus a baked goods section and a full kitchen as well. There's also a couple of tables to sit in if you wanna people watch by the lobby. Once your order is set, you take your beeper thing and wait by the lobby seating area. After waiting a decent amount of time for the food, maybe 25 minutes or so, I got my to-go order with a side of hot latte and some plastic wear and mini jars of maple syrup, jam and jelly. Those little jars btw are like heaven. I made sure to conserve as many of those unopened jars as possible. I pocketed that stuff like it was a game show prize. Don't judge me! Everybody takes something they like from hotels. My thing is fancy jelly and jam. I run into a lot of honey people. I'm not personally an aficionado of mini honey jars, but to each their own! In any case, the jelly and jam was top notch stuff and it went so well with the toast that came with the 2 egg breakfast. 
   
   The eggs on that 2 egg meal were cooked to perfection! Over easy with just enough run in the yolk. The roasted potatoes were great and seasoned just right. They were soft inside without being too greesy outside. Moving on to the frittata, it was light and the veggies inside were cooked the way veggies should be cooked. The outside was crisp or crunchy with the inside cooked through. I didn't eat one soggy piece is asparagus. Next was the giant waffle with the strawberry butter. The waffle was made light and fluffy and sweet. But the the side of stawberry butter was outrageously good! What a perfect compliment to the waffle. There were fresh chunks of real berry in that thing and it just made something good taste great. I put that butter on everything and so everything tasted better! I am of course saving the best for last. The avocado toastie really stole the show. It looks beautiful, it's tasted great and it made me want more. In fact, I put my money where my mouth was. I went back the next morning for another! Bro, it's a good meal and you get a decent amount of food on your plate. Plus is quiet and kinda feels private if you choose to eat here. I thought it was very good and convenient. I can't ask for much more!",xv_eXt8ewNuep87sIUKejQ,0,0,4,7AuSPBu4JMT_gzoRB8VIkg

Convenience is what this little store has going for it, and the prices definitely reflect that.  We didn't try the cafe portion, so I have no comments on that.  We grabbed a bottle of soda and some chips to hold us over while we watched some football before our dinner reservation (sad day for Detroit Lions fans :(  ).  Prices are high, but that's to be expected at a little market in a hotel.  They had a nice selection of items ranging from wine and beer to what appeared to be homemade bread and muffins.  They also had some packaged Boar's Head deli meat and cheese, which would be a nice snack.  Overall, I wouldn't stop here unless I really needed something.",QE-aL9xrz1pc6MOY_rky6g,0,0,3,ouVWgkFPBqMHp85crx0NoA

I was drooling over some of the pictures that I saw online of this place but then it quickly dried up when I saw the damage it'd do to my already swiped too many times debit card.  I don't really understand the pricing of the food that they have here...i was looking at some of the salads, they're just medium sized and honestly kind of looks like someone ate some of it and it was $13..what?! haha how could it be that expensive? They're leaves!  

Anyways the food that I did get though was good.  I got the Vdara cheeseburger that comes with shoestring fries.  Asked for bleu cheese and they smothered it yum!!! (sorry to those that hate it)  the fries were really good too except they put a little too much salt..my lips were chapped by the end.  

Overall, if you're staying in Vdara, I would say, it's so easy to get something here, might as well.  But honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to come here just because it's so expensive.  If they dropped the price a bit, I bet it'd have a line out the door every time...or maybe that's why!!  I figured it out obviously.",FzT-ujff-c11Wa_WdItwig,0,0,3,Oc81gVVBJ-F-Sfdu4XsrDQ
