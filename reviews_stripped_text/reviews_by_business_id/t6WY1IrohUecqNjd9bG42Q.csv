1055,2010-04-22,0,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"I love Red Velvet Cafe, for their baked goods alone.  I have never eaten the food here, but have visited many times for tea and cake and often pick up their baked goods to bring home.  The owner's wife does all the baking herself, and it is clear that great care has gone into developing her recipes.  My favorite is the red velvet cake, which looks like a large cupcake and is topped with a deliciously sweet frosting and a whole strawberry.   They also do a delicious chocolate peanut butter cake, also in the shape of a large cupcake with a moist chocolate cake and rich peanut butter frosting.  The best part about these cakes is that they are under 200 calories, vegan, and free of any saturated or trans fats.  She does not use artificial sweeteners or make things that are low fat but still unhealthy- these cakes are all natural, preservative free, and taste delicious.  I highly recommend this place for their baked goods alone, and I look forward to trying their food.  The menu features sandwiches, pastas, salads, and an assortment of vegan meats and cheeses that are all made on site.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,4,8g3N6sHKf89MwS6znhqraQ

60278,2011-02-21,0,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"While researching vegan restaurants in Vegas, my husband and I found this place, thanks to quarrygirl.com.  We drove off the strip to check it out.  We weren't disappointed.  We had a salad and tomato, mozzarella, and basil pizza.  The mozzarella was no-this-can't-really-be-vegan cheese and was out of this world.  I had to ask what kind it was, and learned its a soy cheese made specially for them (darn - no buying some at the market :))

We also split a red velvet cupcake and there are hardly words to describe it.  Vegan baked goods can be on the dryer / harder side (or maybe that's just my vegan baking) but this red velvet cupcake had to have been the most moist, fluffy cupcake I've ever had. 

Not only am I glad we tried this place out, I'm glad that places like this exist.  Vegan diets can and should be promoted and in our culture, where eating out and socializing while eating are important to us, I'm glad options like the Red Velvet Cafe exist.  By seeing them and promoting them, it helps inspires other restaurants to offer more vegan friendly options and help people think about accessing vegan options -- either exclusively or occasionally.",Sf1rlqqpD1cz9oq8gCGo6w,0,0,4,C2Yrp5ho47bnzvQmrhnFmA

I bought the red velvet cupcakes and cookies dozens of times and always doubted that The Red Velvet Cafe could be telling the truth about the fat and calories. I even asked the owner myself how it was possible. He and his wife said it was because of their ""secret"" recipes.

This is from an article in the Review Journal on July 25th....
""Would you believe one of these Red Velvet Cafe cookies is a mere 27 calories? Well then you're gullible. An independent analysis showed the cookies advertised at 27 calories each at the Red Velvet Cafe actually runs 157 calories each."" 

The service was always terrible and slow, and the regular menu items were not good. The only delicious thing were the ""healthy"" desserts...

I had the veggie tuna wrap & my husband had the avacado basil spaghetti (with veggie chicken & veggie bacon).  For dessert we split a red velvet cake.

Everything was absolutely delicious.  It's our new favorite restaurant.

The staff is fantastic.  The owner came over to out table to make sure eveything was up to par. He also informed us that the vegetarian dishes are prepared on its own stove, separate from the meat items which is awesome.

Also notable was the low calorie count. The tuna wrap was 300 (for both huge pieces), the spaghetti was 400 and most amazingly...the red velvet cake was only 150!! Including the frosting and the strawberry.

177875,2010-08-19,1,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"Just ate here for lunch today. I went with the Taco Salad with chicken. It was pretty huuuuge. I only ate half and I am ready to ktfo! I have 2 hours more of work.. let's hope I get through it without comatosing. 

The taco shell is a chipotle shell.. wondering if it is homemade.. probably. My favorite part is the black beans & rice. I was thinking it'd be full of beans, but has a nice balance between the rice and beans. It also had grilled chicken and topped with iceberg lettuce, cheese and avocados. On the side were two containers of mild if anything, salsa. I do agree with Honey T. that $12.95 for a salad is just plain outrageous!! 

I really wish they had their dinner menu at this time because that has soft tacos, teriyaki, curry, etc. 

I did place a phone order, knowing it'd be busy. They told me it would be ready in about 25 mins. I thought that was a little long.. good thing I had called. It was pretty busy in this small little cafe. It is very modern looking. Most of the tables were full. They had my phone order all ready to go when I arrived there about 10 mins early.

I had been here a couple years ago when they had first opened and I noticed their food really has improved since I last ate there. When I first went there, I got some sort of rice salad.. I didn't even see it on the menu. I can't really describe it being such a long time ago.. but I do remember it not being very good and me wishing I had ordered something else. My boyfriend got a panini and said it was okay. 

They have also expanded from the last time I've been there and have a little bakery section and more tables. Very cool.. I think it took over a part of 8ono8 musubis. (man i miss that place!) 

I have not tried any of their desserts except for their vegan cookies which are... ughhh.. like drugs!! They are soooo tasty and full of flavor and not to mention addicting. I can eat a whole pack by myself and they are less than 100 calories for 4. Not that I really count calories.. but just the fact that it is.. is pretty awesome in itself. I swear, better than non-vegan, hydrogenated oils, refined flour/sugar crap like chips ahoy. They melt in your mouth and are sweet but not too sweet. 

Will definitely be back again.. but probably will try their pastas and/or give their panini's a shot again.",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,2,2,4,nIfmch0yAHXIiGQPtkHdqQ
194314,2011-08-02,1,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"Red Velvet Cafe...my heart is melting just typing. This little hidden gem of a cafe is by far one of my favorite places to go for vegetarian and vegan alternatives.It is nice to have a place with  healthy alternative. Here is what I ordered Trust me...you'll love them as much as I love you. Which is a lot.

Taco Salad:  Chipotle Shell Filled With Rice, beans, Grilled Chicken or 
Vegan Meat, Topped With Shredded Lettuce, Cheese, Avocado, Salsa, and love. 
         Ay yi yi! This is possibly my favorite salad ever! Although very simple it is quite the proportion. I actually first tried it with grilled chicken. Although that was divine and the chicken was so fresh and perfectly cooked, I decided to be adventurous and try Vegan Meat. That contradiction alone made me a skeptic. What the heck is vegan meat?!? I'll tell you what it is. It's DELISH. I highly suggest the vegan meat for you carnivore dare devils.

Orange & Blueberry Lemonade:  Don't ask questions. Just drink it.

Now I may have gone a little overboard on the desserts. They were all vegan, but I couldn't say no. So I ordered four different mini cakes. Don't judge me. They were mini which means I can have that many. ( oh and I bought some vegan chocolate-chip cookies for the road.)  ANYWHO

Tiramisu cake, Raspberry/Blueberry cake, Banana Split Cake, and Vanilla Chocolate Chip cake.  

The only one I did not enjoy was the Tiramisu. It was really strong. Like drinking your coffee black and this girl likes 3 Splendas and cream if you know what I mean.

Alll in all my experience was phenomenal. From the food to the over and beyond hospitality from the Red Velvet Team.  

Now go enjoy these delectable options. I double dog dare you. But if you do, please invite me. It is the right thing to do.",T0ua11LxP335TfFsuawbNw,1,1,4,TbM5Jr0jIZATJI4HzV9UAQ
202763,2011-08-04,0,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"Seriously, I am beyond shocked that this place gets the critical acclaim that it gets. My thoughts are it is because, to its credit, there is no competition in the city for this style of ""healthy"" dining.  Part of the issue, I would guess is that people automatically assume that Vegan is ""healthy"" when in reality, Vegan is only healthier than other food if it's prepared healthier than other food. Being a transplant and a foodie, with serious withdrawals for excellent, organic, sustainable dining found in other cities, I have returned to the Red Velvet Cafe numerous times hoping that it will be all that its followers build it up to be. 
I ordered a vegetable stir-fry with chicken, assuming it would be healthy chicken (I never eat meat out because I want to know where it came from etc...) Anyway, I trusted that this was a healthy, organic restaurant and when the order came the meat was prefab, injected, marinated, chicken with the fake little grill marks on it. The kind you buy in bulk from Smart and Final or Costco that is injected with fillers, sodium, and mystery flavoring. I was really shocked. Baked lays potato chips accompanied a friend's meal. I'm all for simple cooking but I feel that if you're going to tout yourself as healthy and organic then there is a standard to maintain or at the very least identify on the menu for people what is and isn't organic so they can make educated choices. I couldn't help feeling really duped by the whole experience. 

That being said, the people who work there are for the most part really great. The guy who waited on our table was so sweet and funny. He made the whole experience really enjoyable, despite the crappy food. 
The desserts, if you are into Vegan desserts, are amazing. Again, Vegan isn't necessarily healthier than other options so chocolate cake is chocolate cake, but they definitely did an amazing chocolate cake. 

Can't see myself returning to this restaurant any time soon and I would never recommend it to anyone, which I feel bad about because I know how hard it is to run a restaurant. The issue isn't even that the food wasn't that great, it's more that I feel like the presentation is dishonest...and that really bugs me! It's hard enough for people to try to eat right without being misled.",FM2L9x-cex6v3jZhYoW2Jg,0,0,1,N6_38_AdhZ_cxr_Kf4gpXw
224026,2010-04-12,0,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"I knew beforehand that Red Velvet was not exclusively vegetarian/vegan, and I eat at many establishments either on vacation or at home that offer omnivore options, so that wasn't a factor in this review. 

I do appreciate that every single item on the menu can be made either vegetarian or vegan. There's nothing worse than being told that a place has vegan options, but they end up being three items on the menu, one of which you're allergic to, one of which is totally disgusting, you get the idea.

We ordered the bacon-cheddar fries (vegan) for an appetizer- they came out mostly cold, and smothered in way too much daiya vegan cheese, which is best used sparingly. As a result, the daiya clumped rather than melted, and rather than lending flavor to the fries, ended up as slimy goo in our mouths- yuck.

I had the vegan taco salad, which was for the most part delicious. It was layers of rice and beans, faux carnitas, lettuce, more daiya, avocado, and salsa in a crunchy shell. I scarfed it down- it was actually not bad, although I definitely think there's room for improvement. My boyfriend, however, ordered the vegan chicken teriyaki. The teriyaki sauce was waaaay too salty, and lemme tell you that man LOVES his salt. He could hardly eat it. 

Service was overall friendly and courteous, although a bit slow. We waited forever for our check before finally being told there was a printer malfunction- totally understandable, but we'd probably have been a lot more patient if we knew that sooner. The decor is nice, quite clean and modern and I like how they've included a lot of red to tie into their name. There was a huge flat-screen TV playing CNN on mute, which I felt didn't go with the classier environment in there.

It was also very confusing as to whether we were supposed to order at the counter or not. It seemed as though it was counter service, and they took our order and told us to take any table we liked, but when we sat down at a table to wait for our food a ""server"" came by and told us we should have ordered from her!

Being from California, we miss having healthy and tasty food options and were excited when we found Red Velvet. There are some great dishes that never seem to stay on the menu conistently, but most of the food is mediocre. Still,  the best as far as ""healthy"" goes in Vegas. I never write reviews but I must say I was appalled when the last time I went in to order my red velvet cupcake, I saw them put the plastic container with the cake into the microwave. Plastic #6, the most toxic and extremely dangerous to heat in the microwave. I am 7 months pregnant. Other than being INCREDIBLY carcinogenic,  this method of heating food is potentially harmful to developing fetuses. I had been going in 3 x's per week for the last month and a half or so, to satisfy my one pregnancy craving: SWEETS.  Also, I had asked prior to make sure they did not heat the cake in plastic and I was told ""no"". We had also asked the owner what was in the red velvet cake (or at least what was not in the cake), being that certain sweeteners are contraindicated in pregnancy. We were told she could not disclose specific ingredients and the employees told us conflicting things regarding what was not in the cake, so we were already leery. The cake did taste pretty good for being ""low calorie"" so I am bummed I won't be able to enjoy it anymore. It's a lot of trouble for a cake, yes, but where the problem lies is all of the health claims are obliterated by the toxic and carcinogenic result of microwaving it in dangerous plastic. Also, never returned a smile to good paying customers that frequented her restaurant several times per week. The rest of the staff were always friendly.",-OYeSOz_vMX9-V-p_mG89Q,0,0,2,FXOJaqE89f3SC4u55sMvZA

I have been going there since opening, and yes, their Red Velvet Cake is a definite reason to go; however, there are so many areas that need improvement, that it is definitely worth mentioning. After being told that the carrot cake cookie sandwich is the 2nd house favorite dessert, and that we should definitely try it, my girlfriend ordered it (I stayed with my favorite RVC).  Unfortunately, after taking one bite, she decided that it was far too sweet for her. When we were asked, ""How is everything?,"" she mentioned that she was not enjoying the carrot cake, and that she would like to have the RVC instead. After we finished dessert, and received the bill, we had been charged for all 3 desserts.  Lastly, as we paid our bill, my friend apologized for sending back the dessert, explaining that it was too sweet for her - the staff said, ""Well, everyone else seems to like it."" With comments like that, why bother to ask how everything was? Compared to the other small issues that make the RVC disjointed and sometimes frustrating, this was a deal-breaker for us. Having worked in the restaurant industry in Las Vegas for the better part of 20 years, I usually give new restaurants the benefit of the doubt and focus on their redeeming qualities (ie. their organic food choices), but encouraging a guest to order something, charging them for it when they didn't enjoy it, then telling them that everyone else seems to like it, has gone too far.  I will not go back, nor will I recommend that anyone I know go their either. (The other issues they have are mostly front of house.  Here is a shortened list: upon arriving at their location, there are 2 doors, both of which have a blinking, neon 'OPEN' sign; the east door is locked, yet there is no sign saying to use the other door; after entering, there is no sign letting you know to seat yourself, go to the counter or wait to be seated (I have experienced all 3); after being sat, it is not unusual to wait upwards of 10 minutes for any acknowledgement from staff). So, if you have a few hours to kill for lunch, and you can overlook the issues for a $7 veggie sandwich with some Baked Lays, then RVC is for you.",iZT3J9v_mFHPLw9PgaT9Iw,1,0,1,lCbeRZtLRj9c6NSp447HIg

Pros:  
- Great desserts (mini vegan cakes) at under 250 calories.  
- Great guacamole and outstanding hummus (not on menu anymore but you can still get it).  It costs more here than the same order at the Fashion Mall location, I believe.
- Never very crowded

Cons:
- Pricey!  (esp. the cookies!)
- Don't stay open past 8 pm
- Some of the worst wait staff I've had - it is consistently bad - have had a couple of different guys and girls - both equally pathetic.  You will need to flag them down for a refill of tea.  Went there last night and waited 15 min before the guy came and took my order.  
- Again, Pricey for what you get!  Our tab was more than $86 for dinner /tea/desserts(I had a wrap and tea and dessert) - we did not have any appetizers.  Imagine if we would have had good service, the bill would have been higher due to higher tip!  LOL!
- Not many table tops that will hold 4+ people -- I think maybe 6-7 total.

We made our mind up last night, after the consistent bad service and high tab for an average meal that we won't go back there again except for desserts and that will be ""to go""...

The owner/chef is there a lot - I don't know why she doesn't notice that her wait-staff is horrible and killing her business.  She also needs to lower her prices by 10-15%...She should read these reviews or at least have a suggestion box at her register...",8h1n9EAM36TO3gF4cHlydA,2,0,2,C6IpOTG03NzHWIn2MwWnyw

The staff was extremely helpful and informative, they were happy to share their pride in their product, and the food was superb; plus it was owner operated - which is something that I really appreciate. 

My vegan turkey wrap was fantastic, and my friend enjoyed her (real) chicken salad very much. 

I am a big eater, not a typical skinny vegan, and although I was very full from the wrap, the helpful manager convinced me to get the Red Velvet Cake and it was unreal. It was the best vegan desert I have ever tasted, bar none. If it had been possible, I would have ordered another.  

The details of the place really impressed me. The vegan meats were scary good - I had turkey flashbacks to 1996. The soy cheddar was top notch too; both items are specially shipped west from an east coast company that prepares them especially for the cafe. 

Bottom line: eat at this place!

However, I had heard raving reviews and it was supposed to offer healthy food and (gasp) vegan meals.  

I was disappointed to find out that the entrees offered were almost all meat-based or had cheese.  Red Velvet prides itself with being healthy?  For the Standard American DIner, offering baked chips instead of potatoes chips may cut it.  I eat plant-based for my health.  So for a healthy vegan, offering to swap out the meat with faux meat and dairy cheese with soy cheese is not healthy eating.  

I ended up with a panini sandwich, where I asked for the cheese to be swapped with avocado.  They were happy to accommodate the request without an extra charge.  I also tried the tiramisu.  By the all, all the desserts are vegan.  It was more of a cake than the traditional tiramisu style.  It had the right taste, but not the texture I was expecting.

I would return to Red Velvet for dessert and a cup of coffee, but I wouldn't return for a meal unless they offered more healthy plant-based entrees.

I firmly believe that the Las Vegas area needs more restaurants like this place! Their vegan cakes are pretty fantastic, and it's not a ""fantastic"" that's restricted to vegans alone.  And, as are many a fantastic thing in Las Vegas, the prices of the vegan cakes are not cheap but also not the worst that you will fine (about $5-7 for a 2-3 serving cake... depending on how much you want to savor it ;) ).

That being said, for the menu food the prices are a little steep for the quality of food.  Yes, they do use higher quality and overall more natural items than most places ( = more expensive).  However, the prices that I paid here were on par with similar style cafes that I've gone to in Manhattan.  And trust me, the Red Velvet Cafe has some pretty good food, but even though the prices are on par with Manhattan cafes, the food itself is not. 

In particular, the fake meat and dairy products have very little flavor and the sandwiches and taco salad I've had made very little attempt at dressing up the taste (even with just some simple spices).  However, their veggie grill paninis was one of the most fantastic food items I've had in Vegas, so I think as long as you steer clear of the fake animal products at this place you'll enjoy yourself. :)",oG6zUYCWKUy46G6foXnMdA,3,3,4,XSZjIJNXSJG27qaMOjKYuw

Overall, the place is fine. It is small and a bit cramped in terms of seating. It is a little disorganized when they have over-flow and you are not sure where to check in to get a table or wait for a table. But the place is clean and modern. And the staff is friendly.

The service was inconsistent. At first our waiter was very attentive and did take time to go over the menu and food options as we had a mixed table of vegan, vegetarian and meat-eaters. They also put on their menu to tell them if you have any food allergies and if you are vegan/veggie. So I did that and the waiter was very good at handling that and answering questions I had. But when we were ready for desert and the bill, it was hard to get anybody's attention. So, the service waned over time.

The food was good. Everyone seemed to like what they had, so that is good. The high marks were for the deserts, of which they had a lot of vegan options. Always nice to see, especially in Las Vegas.

The downside is that it is only sort of kid-friendly. We have a toddler and there were no high chairs that we could find. No changing tables in the bathrooms. And with the tables so cramped together, it made holding and handling our toddler pretty difficult. Bringing in our stroller to sit our child in was not really an option, either because of how close the tables are. However, we did see several people with smaller babies in carriers and that seemed to work great for them. So, if your baby is still a baby or if your child is a little older and can sit still, then it would be fine.",4r-NBwZBp1qdNstgw4tHvA,2,0,3,8woR6FH9zW8W5dHSsZ7eLw

Some people complain that they have to wait too long for service but lots of people actually enjoy talking to the company they are with and are there to relax, hence the ""cafe"" part?Just because the cakes are labeled vegan doesnt mean they taste any less than DELICIOUS!

as far as the reviewer is complaining about hidden calories in the peanut butter cookies. Have you heard of PB2 or powdered peanut butter? They probably use that.

If you are visiting Vegas and want to eat healthy food. Go to Red Velvet Cafe.

I was searching for SOMETHING to order, when I noticed the footnote stating that all items can be ""made vegetarian"" - i.e., they can have seitan or tofu substituted for the meat.

From what I could see, the place wasn't full at all. It had maybe 2-3 couples in the dining area. The staff told Ben that our order was not prepared yet which was no big deal. He paid not too long after that and we took our food home. What we discovered was very disappointing. Our vegan tuna melt was not a melt at all. It was very crumbly, the bread was not toasted and was overall soggy. The same goes for our vegan ham and cheese sandwich. We also ordered a vegan spinach and chicken quesadilla which was slimy and barely had any cheese in it.

I wasnt impressed and wouldnt order it again, esspecially for the price. 

the actual food menu is okay (at best), being vegan i seem to be taken here by at least one person everytime i am in town so I have had a few different things off it. the taco salad is pretty alright, a decent portion for the price but not a complete knock out for me. a couple of the paninis where alright, but again not a knock out. 

the knock out is the super cute boy behind the counter. red velvet needs to keep him staffed because he is the highlight of this place. being super sweet, having a great smile and being knowledgeable about all the menu items.

I had the vegan tuna melt sandwich and and did enjoy it. It is still pretty pricey at 8.99 plus a buck to make it vegan... It looks like finely chopped veggie meat with chopped onions and celery in a vegenaise sauce on regular wheat bread.
My husband ordered the vegetarian spicy chicken wrap which was also good.
Both dishes comes with either a plain mixed greens or chips. 
Husband ordered the sparking blood orange ice tea. Refreshing but again... 5.50 and no refills....
We ordered the apple crumble cake and the lemon raspberry cream cake. Both were good! I think I remember the red velvet cupcake being a bit more fluffy and light but it may be because its baked in a smaller mould.
 I definitely enjoy seeing the display of various vegan desserts. This is definitely a huge plus for vegans who always get screwed when it comes to dessert (sorbet or fruit cup?)

I can't say if the place is very crowded or not during normal business hours as we had arrived just as they reopened their kitchen after a young beginner driver had crashed her mother's Lexus through the glass door.  However, people started to trickle in and it seemed like a popular local place.  The staff was very friendly and the menu had something for everyone, especially by having the option to make everything vegan or vegetarian.

I ordered the taco salad upon the recommendation of our server and my sister had the curry with fake chicken.  Everything was a bit bland and I was surprised by the shredded iceberg lettuce party that was my taco salad.  It was about 90% iceberg lettuce with a dab of avocado, fake ground meat with taco seasoning, Daiya cheese, and some rice and beans.  The curry wasn't terrible but it was extremely boring and came with the saddest scoop of flavorless rice.  We ordered the red velvet cake, which was good... but had buttercream frosting instead of the traditional oh-so-delicious cream cheese frosting! 

Again, everyone was so cheery and nice that we stuck around a while to read the old Vanity Fair and health magazines lying around the table and no one seemed to mind.  Despite the meh quality of our meal, I'd probably come back to try something else, especially some of the other desserts.

Some upfronts: I am from Tucson (and elsewhere) where there are so many choices for wonderful and imaginative vegan / vegetarian food -  RV just fails on so many levels in comparison.  We came for lunch so the only thing I can say about the desserts is that they looked pretty and are expensive. 

We ordered the Caprese and Tuna Salad paninnis. With the exception of the baked fries (1.99 extra) both meals were just bad.  I would say mediocre but that means something about the meal was ok. Caprese paninnis are one of my favorite sandwiches - when they are done right.  This sandwich is supposed to create a delicate balance between melted mozzarella, basil and pesto with a light crusty bread. My paninni came to the table and it was cold.  There were two thick slices of cold unmelted cheese, one measley basil leaf and the pesto was undetectable. The whole grain bread is an inappropriate choice too.  It was a decent bread - but it overwhelmed the ingredients and tasted buttery from the oil spray they use on the paninni maker.  

The tuna salad sandwich also failed.  My companion stated that the tuna was overwhelmed by the red onion. Serving Baked Lays also shows a lack of imagination. Is it because of the low fat/calories?  It is not a healthier option overall.

I gave them a chance to fix the situation.  I told my server ( who tried...) and she took the sandwich away.  She came back with the same sandwich which had been reheated on the paninni maker.  Well, it did a help a little...BUT -  did anyone consider that it was probably a health code violation to put (at least) the part of the half that I had already eaten back on the grill???

You know,  I'm avid supporter of independent businesses.  Maybe I should give it another chance and try some of the salads or veggie dishes.  But, my first impression are usually accurate.  I also asked about the canned soda.  I accepted the answer that not many people order soda.  However, they only recycle ""most of the time"".

As much as I hate the phrase ""lipstick on a pig"" it seems appropriate for RV cafe.  I think they have a genuine identity problem that translates to the way they make their food.

It is sort of pretty (though not very comfortable and loud) and the desserts also look amazing, but it just seems like there is nothing there - there.",y2nsH0RXJrDbfwTfZSTV4w,0,0,1,43a-4tW1HjIQvE_Gtt81jg

The eggplant dish was good, but not what I expected. It was a dry spice, no ""sauce,"" but still tasty. The veggies were crisp and fresh. There was more than enough brown rice provided as well.

I've been to this place twice and found it unappealing and so haven't been back until this week, only because myself and my lunch mates had a limited amount of time and it was close by.

We ordered the avocado quesadillas which were great! (thank god we got those!!)

I chose the grilled veggie panini with fries, Cyndy chose the vegan chicken sandwich, Chef Mike chose the veggie shrimp with rice dish.  Appetizer came out pretty quickly but our entrees did not.  Maybe 25 mins went by before they arrived.

The server was dressed like he should have been lounging at home not serving at a restaurant.

When our food eventually came (we were one of two tables there, it was empty) my fries looked under cooked, and tasted like they were bad and/or had be cooked in rancid oil, my panini had just 2 half slices of nearly unrecognizable tomato, some spread and a lot of spinach, not much else. My bread was so soggy it just fell apart. I was pretty unhappy.

Mike who is a chef and restaurant consultant was not impressed and was wondering how they were even open with food that is either under cooked or over cooked and with such bad customer service. his veggie shrimp dish was so overcooked that he couldn't even eat it.

Cyndy's sandwich was terrible too, it wasn't the same as she'd had before and so didn't eat her meal either.

A server came to give us more water asked how our food was and we said ""not that good"". She left and didn't come back.  Our original server came to check on us and i told him the fries tasted awful and seemed under cooked, and none of us liked our food, he responded ""the fries are baked"" and didn't say much else. so i again said ""Did you hear that we all didn't like our food"" he said ""yes i heard"", i replied, ""so you can see that we still have food left on our plate because it wasn't good?"", he just looked at me and walked away. He didn't care, didn't even  attempt to make us happy in any way, he came back with the bill and didn't discount the food.

One of our favorite cafes was closed on a Sunday afternoon so we decided to try out RVC. The place is nice and their food selection is pretty good and our waitress was very nice, but there were some disturbing things I did not particularly like: 

1. When we first got there they only had one table. A few minutes after we got there a table of 4 came in and a couple minutes after a party of 2 came in. Mom and I ordered and while we waited for our drinks our waitress took the two other tables their orders as well. After waiting for longer than 15 minutes, I noticed the party of 4 got their food. Then another 5-10 minutes later our food came at the same time the party of 2 got theirs, which I was not too happy with because we waited a very long time and got our food after the 2 other tables who came in after we did. 

2. My mom ordered a chicken wrap, she was asked if she wanted regular chicken or vegan chicken, which she chose vegan. I had a chicken panini and was also asked if I wanted regular chicken or vegan chicken. I had never tried vegan chicken so I figured I'd give it a shot and also ordered mine vegan. Our waitress never told us there would be an additional charge for the vegan option, but there was in fact 2 additional fees on my bill at the end of our meal. Luckily, my little brother had the regular chicken on his chicken burger, so no additional fees were added to his meal, but still ended up paying nearly $60!

I have to start by saying that the salads here are always awesome!  Today's lunch portion of Bacon, Avocado, and Shrimp salad was plenty to satisfy me, and I'm a fan of hearty lunch portions.  The shrimp was so fresh, firm, and tasty.  I hate getting rubbery pre-cooked shrimp on my salads.

To be fair, my previous visit was less than inspiring, as my turkey sandwich was on 2 slices of bread from the bag with circular slices of deli meat like you get in the lunchmeat section of Von's.  I was not happy about the $9 price for what I could have made for $0.39.

My overall experience with this location definitely merits the 4 stars though.  And although I'm not a dessert person, my friends always leave with a little bag of goodies and rave over the sweet treats they make.

I started with the much talked about red velvet cake. Yum! 

I give it three and a half stars overall for the clean food and cozy atmosphere. 

I went the simple route and got the chicken, spinach, mushroom panini. It came with a side salad. 

The salad was very green and fresh. 
The bread needed an upgrade. The spinach tasted like it was boiled and drained weird, but not bad. Lots of mozzarella cheese. I would've asked for a little less. The combo of the 3 aforementioned ingredients was good together and the chicken slices were hearty-just the way I like it.

Everything has a vegan option for those that want, but i ordered the Grilled Chicken burger with Baked Fries.  What a great and healthy alternative to fast-food!  The service is fast and SUPER friendly.  I think i get a friendly ""high"" after visiting this place as I become the nicest guy you meet when I leave.

The baked fries are a great alternative to their deep fried cousins. Though not as crispy they still have great flavor.  
The chicken was moist and not dry at all and loaded with fresh lettuce, tomato, and I had them add fresh avocado for a dollar more (great alternative to mayo for you health conscious folks).  

On another visit i tried the Chicken, Mozzarella, Tomato Panini which was just OK.  It came with a bag of baked chips.  The Panini was what was expected but was not knock me out of my seat delicious.  I preferred the chicken burger as it came with baked fries!

I was not impressed with that meal unfortunately. Pass. My friend said it was awesome so I'll have to kick her for making crave it. All the items were super-duper salty for some reason. We hate salt. This year I will cook or maybe we will just go out. Whole Foods here we come! 

We are a fan of some menu items especially the guac dip with baked chips. It seriously is a meal in itself. Their portions are ridiculous huge and I wish they would stop that! Wasteful.

Husbands gets a vegan chorizo taco salad and talk about huge, he can't eat 1/3 of it. Kinda gags me to think about it. Why so overfilled?!?! I have tasted it before and it's good but nothing I can't whip up at home. 

I have had brown rice dishes, vegan chk spicy sandwich, vegan chk nuggets, salads, wraps...nothing really stands out to me.

BUT.......the desserts........wow. The mocha cake is my fav. The chocolate chip cookies are just how I like them firm but soft inside. I guess if you want to vegan dessert binge this is 100% the place to go. All that diabeeetus dream stuff is amazing. Oh and they make a mean soy latte to go right with it.

Soo...don't take my opinion just go try it out yourself. I will continue to visit RVC when I need to stretch my stomach out or gain a few pounds. Hey it's A-Ok!

He ordered a turkey-bacon-avocado panini club vegan-style, and I got the vegan macaroni and cheese because I was dying for some comfort food. Both came with a balsamic salad as a side. Both our portions were huge! I almost didn't finish the mac and cheese but it was so good I had to, it was a good-size hearty bowl. It didn't taste exactly cheesy, but it was nice and creamy, kind of like an alfredo sauce. It did have some melted cheese on top and tasted great with some added pepper. The salad came on the side of the bowl on a plate and it was also a generous portion with spring greens and just enough dressing.

We ended up getting the same server as the last time we came in, but service was a bit better although she is a bit of a ninja, randomly popping up every now and again. 

Even though we were most definitely satiated, what's a birthday without some birthday cake? I eschewed my usual choice of a red velvet cupcake as the vanilla chocolate chip cake was calling my name, and Matt got the cinnamon swirl cake - both vegan. They were brought to us WARM which made all the difference. Note to self: even if the portions are huge, don't get dessert to-go or heat it up yourself at home, it is YUMMY. The cake was just sweet enough and warm enough, and HUGE. So freakin' delicious, their desserts really are can't-miss. 

I have a feeling that even though the service is a bit spotty at times we'll still be coming back over and over again since I'm now a vegan, and I'm going to try and branch out to try all of their vegan desserts because HOT DAMN that cake was so delectable, Matt's was too!

LV generally sucks as far as vegan options go (outside of donuts). Being from out of town and based primarily on The Strip, RVC is a bit of a trek. Of course, if you are vegan, on the strip, and have transportation, you will need to go here.

The menu is quite diverse and they easily substitute any of the meats with meat analogs- even (kinda) crispy chicken! The portions are also very generous. I had a (vegan) spicy crispy chicken wrap and I totes enjoyed it. You might as well skip the side salad and Baked Lay's. Save room for dessert.

The desserts are deceivingly large portions as well. Who doesn't like various nomz cakes with very sweet frosting?

When a place hypes themselves as being ""vegetarian"" the menu probably shouldn't include chicken in every other dish. But hey, I understand wanting to appeal to a larger audience- every dish can be ""made"" vegetarian/vegan using tofu. Which is questionably nutritious, as it's processed soy, but hey...

Much like the nearby Panini Café, this place somehow expects you to find it reasonable to spend $16 on a sandwich. I don't know about you, but I'd rather hit up the Strip for a gourmet burger from a celebrity chef if I'm going to pay that. And no, using organic ingredients doesn't justify it.

Tried the veggie Panini and the chicken pesto Panini- pesto was missing but even with it, I'm not sure the flavor would have been saved. Everything inside the sandwich is overpowered by the bread. And not in a good way.

http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/cookies-might-be-too-good-be-true

To summarize really quick, this article tells about how people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies, which claim to be only 27 calories each. Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.

I've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating. 

I know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true! 

I just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed. People rely on accurate information on what they eat, if that information is available. Now, I cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says about any of their food. Can you?

I even inquired about the ancient recipe.  They said for allergies you had to list specific ingredients and they would ask the chef if those ingredients were in the cookies.  I still love the cookies but haven't been here since the LVRJ wrote the article.  I will get the cookies for special occasions but definitely won't be enjoying as many as I used to.

Given my experience that v&vs think any place that has more than one vegan-friendly option is ""amazing,"" I went in thinking this place would be completely overrated and serve incredibly bland food.

Red Velvet Cafe has a wide variety of vegan options, but there is plenty of meat on the menu, as well.   And most importantly, the restaurant understands that v&v food doesn't automatically have to be tasteless raw food.  The group I went with had the buffalo chicken wrap with an excellent, spicy buffalo sauce, fresh ingredients and a quality piece of chicken; a hot, cheezy vegan panini which was loaded with faux turkey (actually pretty substantial and tasty), cheeze (a.k.a. fake cheese that actually melts, which if you have ever been subjected to vegan cheeze, is a pleasant surprise) and delicious bread with deep panini-style grill lines.

They actually have quite a variety of items from salads, to small pizzas, to sandwiches and other entrees. I had a few of their salads before and they were all very fresh and good. I've had their pasta and so far, they are very light tasting. Maybe not as good as their calorie-ridden counterparts, but what do you expect? For my most recent visit, I tried their Frisco Burger, which is a Chicken sandwich with spicy peppers and lots of cheese. This sandwich is very slippery so you may end up using your fork and knife for this one. They do upsell you on options that seem to be $2 each, such as upgrading to baked fries instead of the standard side salad. But perhaps the best thing that they carry is their desserts. Many are gluten-free (if that matters to you) and their cookies are wonderful. They will even heat them up for you to enjoy on the premises if you like. They're a bit pricey, $5.50 for 6 small cookies, but they are worth a try for sure. The food does seem to come out slow. Sodas are by the can.

My vegan friend (he lives in Vegas) and I met our meat-loving friends and their son here for lunch on new year's eve and the place was PACKED! They must have gotten really popular since they opened the place, because they seemed short-staffed and short on space. My friends and I sat at the bar by the coffee counter and waited to pounce on one of the tables once the people eating there finished. 

I didn't expect anything too amazing as far as service was concerned because they were so unbelievably busy, but our server was actually very friendly and as attentive as he could be. I ordered the vegan taco salad, my vegan friend ordered the vegan tuna salad, and our meat-eating buddies ordered a wrap and a panini. Both of the vegan dishes were very tasty, but the taco salad really blew me away. (Almost as good as the taco salad from Karyn's Cooked in Chicago!) It was so filling and warm and perfect and delicious! I had a hard time finishing it all, but for the price I was paying (and due to the fact that I couldn't take any leftovers with me), I gobbled it all up. 

The best part of the meal, in my opinion, was the dessert. OH. MY. GOD. So many vegan dessert options!

Warm, gooey, moist red velvet cake with melt-in-your-mouth VEGAN butter cream frosting?!! Yes, please! Swoon 

Anyway, if you're in Vegas from out of town, this is really one of your only options if you're a vegan. Hate to break it to you guys, but Vegas isn't all about us vegans YET. :) If you have severe food allergies (gluten, etc), just go to Whole Foods like you would in your home town.

Their buffalo chicken wrap is particularly good and I appreciate their veggie and gluten free options. The truth is that there are not many places that cater to these choices.  While not entrenched in either camp, I like to make those menu choices on occasion.  

Service is good for me because they remember me.  Good is good not great.  Thankfully I have not seen the owners as I may lose control of my mouth. :).

This place is definitely good, but I do think it is quite pricey. 

Their salads are fresh and tasty, but too expensive. I particularly enjoyed their taco salad.  I really like the avocado and basil spaghetti. There are more Veggie items that I want to try and will give an update. 

So far Red Velvet has not failed me yet, except for their prices in Salads ($12.95 for a salad is just way too expensive in my book)!",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,0,0,4,96GdXeAC-Qwme7GAYWtj9A

Our first trip there, we had vegan cheddar bacon fries and a taco salad.  When I saw the fries, I had to call the chef over to ask if the cheese was really vegan, because it definitely didn't look vegan.  The chef told me that not only was it vegan, but she makes it herself.  She was explaining how she couldn't make it some days if the weather wasn't cooperative, and so on and so forth.  In any case, it was SO good.  I told her she could easily sell it commercially; she smiled and said she could never make enough at once to make it commercially.  Damn shame.  She'd be a bazillionaire.  And that's just from the amount I'd buy from her.  

Oh, and did I mention that the fries were baked?  They did not taste baked.  But I know she wasn't lying, because I didn't feel like crap after eating half a plate of them.  Yummo.

The taco salad had a little too much Iceberg lettuce for my taste, but it was still yummy yummy yummy, and I loved that the taco shell was a baked crispy whole grain tortilla instead of a deep-fried flour one. 

For dessert we had the red velvet cake, and all I can say is, now I know why the restaurant is named after it.  Holy Mother of Yum.

We went again the day we had to leave (because we just couldn't resist).  We got a ""chicken""-spinach-artichoke panini and a ""chicken"" salad wrap.  The panini was amazing.  The wrap was really good.  And the package of 6 cookies did not taste low-calorie, although they told us that the whole package was something like 130 calories and 6 grams of fat.  For the WHOLE PACKAGE.  Unbelievable.  

It was all I could do not to kidnap the chef and steal her back to LA with me.  Now I have a reason to go back to Vegas.  A lot.",cu5THnu8k6pJ5GHA9MtLgg,3,1,5,GSVMIC0H1HXR8rp6f2PLeg

WHEN: I have no clue when they open, but I will be sure to ask and update the next time I am there.  The last time I went was on a weekend, and they close doors at 9pm, but they close the kitchen at 8pm, so get there sooner before they close on you!! After 8pm, you can try the desserts that they do have left.

WHERE: Located on West Sahara & Buffalo!

WHAT: As their menu states, ""deliciously healthy""!!! I would come here every single day if it was a little bit closer to me, wahh!! I've noticed that people are discouraged to test this place out as soon as they hear the word VEGAN.  Honestly, I was a bit uneasy myself when I heard they served vegan food, but since I love trying new things, I walked in with an open-heart, open-mind, and an OPEN-TUMMY!

FOOD:
-mac&cheese: I had to have a spoonful of my mac!! You can never go wrong with mac&cheese, but it was just an okay dish here.  I don't think I'll be ordering it anytime soon.
-fire fries: Everyone has their own crazy french fry dish!! This was actually pretty unique!! The fries are baked in pico de gallo and cheese... and when they brought it out and I took my first bite, it was for sure FIRE!
-grilled chicken avocado panini: When I took my first bite, I experienced the deliciously healthy part!! It was something different, but it was Yummyyyy!!

DESSERT: The only dessert worth tasting and the only one that I have ever tasted was the Vegan Red Velvet Cupcake!! It is gluten-free, no butter, no dairy, no egg (NO ANIMAL PRODUCT AT ALL) & is mouth-watering! I did not know how scrumptious one cupcake could be... UNTIL THIS ONE CAME INTO MY LIFE! 

The only this I have left to say is.. TRY THE RED VELVET CAKE!! While you're at it, order one for me and send it over! =D",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,16,16,5,3jaGyznjO9aPiAAaJApi0Q

I have to admit I'm not much for writing reviews, though I do read them and that is how my wife and I found Red Velvet Cafe. We have been vegan for about two years now, and everyone who is vegan knows that it is very difficult to find awesome food that we can eat. We came to Vegas for my wifes birthday(a tradition for us on our birthdays), and on this trip we found a top 5 vegan place for us to eat. YEA!  we look forward to coming back next trip and try something more. So if you are vegan and visiting Vegas take it from me, as i used to live here, there isn't much for vegan fare here. Thankfully the gang at Red Velvet is doing thier part to change that. Great job and keep up all you do! And yes the red velvet cake was simply amazing. Thank you for making my wife's birthday special. Just let me say that the people of Las vegas are very lucky to have a vegan frienly place of this quality! Greg & Lisa (phoenix) 

Yesterdays meal was so good we decided to return today. We shared the vegan taco salad. It was amazing. both of us commented on the rice in the tortilla. Very different, and tasty. Todays dessert was vegan carrot cake. OMG! Simply the best i have ever had vegan or not!  And believe me i know carrot cake, it is my second fave. (german chocolate w/coconut icing is #1 and always will be)

Tomorrow is our last day :(, and we are contemplating our third trip. Everyone was so friendly we may make this happen. I saw a vanilla chocolate chip cake with my name on it! 

Anyway, we will always find a way to get here when we come to town. If you are vegan and you can visit Red Velvet please make the time, you will not be dissappointed.

I tried this place a few years ago, prior to their expansion, and I remember it being a pretty good place.  The only reason why I haven't gone back is because its a good 25-30 minute drive from my house.  It's located on the corner of Sahara and Buffalo.  This little trendy lookin' place is good for lunch or dinner, or maybe just some desert or a coffee.  They serve sandwiches, paninis, wraps, pizzas, salads, pasta, and rice plates all of which can be served up vegan.  They have specials for November, but I ended up ordering the Chicken Provolone, which had chicken, spinach, roasted tomato, basil, provolone and pesto dressing grilled between two slices of whole wheat bread.  It came with a choice of chips or salad all for about $8; pretty cheap, considering the size of the plate and the freshness of the veggies.  To me, it tasted slightly bland, but not enough for me to complain.  I heard from another patron, that the specials were pretty good, so I'll probably give that a whirl next time around.

The service was so-so.  Granted, it was really busy--peak lunch hours (1:00pm).  My server tried to be attentive, but with the influx of customers that trolled in, I felt like she was flustered.  I was surprised I found a table.  If you're coming in here around this time, get here early and just anticipate to wait a little just so you can forewarn your belly.

So... the main thing that brought me to give this place 4 stars (and almost pushed me to 5... almost) were their vegan desserts.  OMG, their vegan desserts.  It's like heaven in your mouth.  Their dessert case displayed a wide variety of cakes; each one, based on what the lady behind the counter had told me, were under 200 calories (say what?! lol). I asked her a little bit about her preference and what was popular, etc, etc, to try to narrow down my options (seriously, there's so many cakes I had no idea which to choose from).  Apparently, the vanilla chocolate chip cake and red velvet are among the popular ones.  I ended up choosing the lemon cake along side my espresso.  It was delicious; moist and dense, with a light and sweet topping that had lemon rind bits mixed into it.  I also brought home their vegan chocolate chip cookies: tasty, not sweet, soft, chewy, slightly crisp around the edges, not too many chocolate chips---perfect.

Definitely would go here again.  Wish it weren't too far.  Wish it weren't too crowded.  I wanna try their breakfast for sure!",t2nPIKI2iy8VG_cfFD0Vmg,1,1,4,L_MU3cDdVlk9X83AZIOIcA

Vegetables with dressing between two pieces of grilled bread. Only drawback, the bread was warm along with the spinach, however the artichoke hearts were still cold. Still tasted great. 
Afterwards I decided to get some cookies. I'm guessing since they were the target of a food editor a while back, they changed the recipe. They almost seemed half back.. They were not crisp anywhere and tasted very much like dough. For $5.50 you get 6 regular size cookies, at that price I really wanted a spectacular taste, and they did not deliver, instead just a blah taste.

This was the only place i actually made it out to because we did bring some of our own food and we were only there for 2 days.  anyway, we were pretty impressed with our findings.  

the restaurant isnt all that big but there enough tables that are pretty spread out. its clean, sleek, and have modern decor. they have big, tall tables (most for 4 people) and highchairs (which resemble stools). only one table was shorter and had chairs with full backs.  unfortunately it was snatched from us as we went up to the counter and ordered.  i think i would have preferred more of those shorter tables or chairs with some back support...but thats just me.

i ordered the chicken and spinach wrap- vegetarian style.  meaning, its just mock chicken instead of the real stuff.  the wrap is stuffed with spinach, artichoke, tomato, mozzarella, and pesto.  served on the side is baked potato chips that sort of reminded me of baked pringles. it was tasty and satisfying. you could probably stretch it out into two meals but i ate the whole thing. hahah

my friend had the vegan taco salad.  it was very delish.  the veggie ground beef was really well seasoned and the chipotle shell was not greasy.  stuffed inside was rice and beans, veggie ground beef, shredded lettuce, cheese, avocado, and salsa. my friend claimed it was the best taco salad she had ever had. 

we both had a red velvet cupcake for dessert.  the man working there said it was only 150 calories.  i don't know what to make of that because i dont believe him.  maybe he means per serving....and the cupcake has multiple servings. haha!  otherwise they are geniuses at Red Velvet because the cupcake was pretty amazing...and i dont like red velvet cake much because it is usually too sweet for me.  the frosting they used tasted like powdered sugar rather than the usual cream cheese frosting.  

i guess my concern is that i dont think they are organic, which means they could be putting who knows what in there. to me, low-fat doesnt necessarily equal healthy if its made from chemicals.  i didnt ask much about the ingredients.   i did have quite the enjoyable meal, though and we were pleasantly surprised.  we are definitely going back next time we get out to vegas.   its nice to find a place (that isnt whole foods) to eat at in vegas.",772ymfzITLdLEE8yQbtMeg,0,0,4,dQX11_0RVYMegzP6CDhb7g

The first time I ate here I had vegan pizza. I was a little skeptical about ordering this because the only time I had ever encountered vegan cheese before this tasted like someone had sprayed the remaining aerosol from a cheez-whiz can onto a thinly sliced piece of tofu. Man, this was SO not that cheese. The Red Velvet vegan pizza is soy (badumshh) delicious, I just wanted to eat the topping off of it because it was so melty and perfect. I've only been here about 5 times total because it is a little pricey, but every food experience here has been a great one.

The vegan taco salad is excellent and highly recommended, although the faux-beef seems to be a tad greasy. The red velvet cake is freaking unbelievable, and it ought to be since it's in their name. You won't regret ordering this cake, especially because it's not as calorie heavy as you might think with all that delicious frosting.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the seating. Even though I've been here at least 5 times, I'm always a little confused about whether or not I'm supposed to just seat myself, or wait near the door for someone to put us somewhere. The seating in the main area is incredibly uncomfortable to sit at for an entire meal. The chairs are very high and since I'm only 5'3"" it just  feels like I'm sitting in a high chair.

2927264,2010-08-18,4,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"I have no idea how this place has such good reviews. I came here with my bf recently and once we entered we weren't greeted for a while. We went to the cashier and asked him if we just sit anywhere and he looked at us like we should've known that already. 

He gave us our menus which was your generic ""vegan"" menu with wraps, paninis, salads, and a minuscule variety of anything else.  We opted for pasta that had fake meat and avocado in it. We got fries with cheese and tomatoes for our appetizer. The pasta came with a very bitter side salad. And drinks? We just stuck to water, there was no way we were paying for their ridiculously priced drinks. 

The whole time it seemed like the server/cashier guy was mad at us. He kind of sighed when we only ordered one dish and every time we looked at him he wasn't smiling, unless he was talking to a regular. 

The bitter salad came after 10 minutes. 20 minutes after that we still didn't have our food, not even the fries. We noticed a couple sitting in front of us that was already there when we got in; They looked like they were getting antsy and nothing was on their table yet. The girl went up to the cashier to ask her how much longer they're going to have to wait since it looked like they weren't doing anything in their kitchen, and he told her it won't be much longer. THEN you see them start making their sandwich and chickn nuggets. They got their tiny plate of chicken nuggets along with their sandwich and boy did they look mad! I would've been mad too if it took them almost an hour to bring out a sandwich and 5 nuggets. 

About 40 minutes into waiting we got our fries and pasta. 

Wow, those fries were disgusting! You can totally tell how dried out and gross they must've been by the pictures I provided. It was like they chopped some potatoes,sprinkled cheese on top and left them in the oven to burn. Then took them out and sprinkled a few pieces of tomato on it. If I had my eyes closed while eating this I probably would've thought it was cardboard that a homeless person wrote on. 

The pasta....was even worse. It tasted spoiled, like they went and left it in someone's car for a day, then took it back inside and put some fresh avocado on it. It was just sour and very bland. The fake meat on it tasted just like the pasta, it added no flavor. The only thing it added to the dish was the artificial appearance of it looking good. 

It really bugs me when ""Vegan"" places stick to serving bland food and charging more money for it just because it has the title of being Vegan. Considering I've gone to many other REAL vegan joints, I can safely say that this place deserves one star. Their fake meat has absolutely no flavor or any texture that makes it seem real at all. 

Just go to an asian restaurant and order lots of flavorful vegan selections for half the price.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,4,1,1,GJNOMpU1mLZ-if_zD4gW2g

I ordered the ""baked"" Mac and Cheese which was served in a bowl with a side salad. At first glance I saw no noodles but what looked like soup like consistency. While it was tasty, it wasn't outstanding and the runny cheese was very hard to eat without strings coming out from my mouth. 

I sampled my dates panini which was very tasty, something I will note for next time!  I got a double chocolate banana cake which was amazing! I keep hearing that their desserts are gluten/sugar free and it is hard to believe!

It was about 1pm, and the place was packed.  We patiently stood around for a few minutes waiting to be seated.  We figured they were busy so we'll just seat ourselves.  The busser cleaned a table, and we sat down.  He gave us our menus, but we were ignored for the next 10-15 minutes.  (We should've just gotten up and ran.)  Finally, I walked up to a waiter and asked if we could order.  He came to our table, apologized & said it was busier than normal.  As someone from the industry, I was sympathetic.  We ordered a California panini, eggplant pizzeti, & chicken/mushroom/spinach panini with side salads & chips.  They were out of the french fries.  How could you be out of fries for the next 2 hours? The food was such a disappointment!  I don't care if it was organic & the lettuce came from the garden of Eden & watered with holy water; it was simply not good.  The side salads were completely uninteresting.  I could buy organic mixed greens from Safeway and throw some vinaigrette on it, and it would taste exactly the same.  My CA panini was barely warm.  The bread was tiny and the meat looked turkey bologna from the sale section of the grocery store.  I could've made this garbage at home but no, I spent $7 on it.  The pizzeti was equally disgusting.  No flavor whatsoever.  My bf's panini was ok.  Not terrible but edible at best.  And it was served with a small handful of broken Lays potato chips.  I cannot believe we wasted $30 & 1.5 hours on this place.  I initially wanted to try the red velvet cake, but from the experience with the food & service, we decided not to waste any more $ here.

The place is full of frou frou vegetarians/health conscious people who are willing to pay $$ for awful food because they probably don't know better.  The lady at the table next to ours was a calorie counter and wanted to know the calories of everything.  Listen lady, you don't look that great.  Save your time and money & eat somewhere else that actually tastes good & hit the gym if you feel that guilty.  I consider myself a health conscious person but I definitely think that taste should not be compromised.

I told her my mom was diabetic, and if her calories counts were correct, then she should be able to eat some of her snacks. She went on to say they weren't sugar free. I went on to argue that they must be low sugar because one cookie only contained 27 calories. She agreed. Needless to say my moms blood sugar spiked after two cookies. One cookie technically couldn't of had more than 5 grams of sugar and zero grams of fat based off their nutritional counts. LIARS. News reports confirmed my accusation in 2013. Not only were they claiming this crap was healthy, they were underestimating the calories by 6x the actual amounts. They were sabotaging people for financial gain. My mom and all diabetics alike could of gotten really sick, or even died. Personally, I wouldn't trust a single thing they claim

(baked lays.) devoured it in less than ten minutes. something about their buffalo sauce had my mouth watering for more. so yummy! my dad enjoyed their strawberry banana shake. i had a sip and it tasted like a meal in itself so i suggest if you have a small stomach like me to just stick to water with your meal. i have also tried the california panini from there and it was pretty good, but still my favorite is the buffalo chicken wrap.

However I have no option but to give the 1 star rating as I was compelled to immediately post a quick review on Facebook due to the total lack everything that I expected when I arrived...here goes!

The smell - Enchanting
The Decor - Upbeat, clean lines and overall makes you smile
Ambiance - Good modern music, plenty of flat screens.

The Food - The blandest chicken pesto Panini EVER...Their pesto sauce is pesto mayo...how do you take one of the tastiest, healthiest and easiest sauces to prepare and do that to it...YUCK YUCK YUCK. Plus, they maybe had it on the grill for 2 minutes as it was lukewarm and the bread was soaked in that mayo...Salad dressing way to strong as well for a balsamic vinaigrette. The saute shrimp special was enjoyed by my fiance so well done there.

The Service - Loved the hi's and hello's when we first came in but from there on it went downhill. There seems to be 25 people working here but most of them seem to be doing absolutely nothing...well they did seem to be efficient ""texters"" so give them their due. After finally getting our food and being generally ignored I went up to pay, when asked if everything was good for lunch I replied that the Panini fell very short and it was not good, his response was not what was wrong, but a very abrupt sorry and here's your check!!! Do you not want to know what is wrong with your food...come on get serious when you are in the food business!

The Red Velvet Cake - Don't even bother, tasteless and dry with no flavor at all. Go to Nothing Bundt Cakes on West Sahara, don't come here!!!

Dear Red Velvet Cafe,

I would say you are on a very slippery slope and i think my views are supported by some recent posts. Be very careful because when you slip to much, there is nothing to grab a hold of and you will be flat on your ass. I'm sorry, but while I normally give second chances, your manager/server and cake are going to keep me away for a very long time.

The staff are really friendly and look super happy to work there. Great restaurant!

The only drawback to this otherwise awesome place, is all the meat dishes on the menu. I heard the place was originally intending to be more vegan, but I suppose restaurants needs to make money by catering to larger audiences. :(

Furthermore, there are many options that are both vegan & gluten-free.  It's also really cool that everything on the menu of normal food items can be made both vegan, gluten-free, or both.  This is a great spot for a quick bite or casual meeting since there is really something for everyone.  

My absolute favorite thing there is the Red Velvet cake (gluten-free and vegan, but you wouldn't know it) - go figure.  My Dad who is a serious dessert fan and definitely not vegan...and criticizes most of my GFV desserts said it was one of the best red velvet cakes he has ever had.  Seriously folks, the desserts do not skip a beat.  They are moist, dense yet fluffy, and amazing.

I was visiting Vegas just last week and on our second to last day there we had google searched vegan friendly restaurants in the area and came up with the Red Velvet. We went based on the good reviews of the food to try out our luck and were pleasantly surprised. The food was in fact absolutely amazing. I have never had a vegan dish that was that health consciously filling. The desserts were something to die for and I couldn't believe that the cakes were all under 200 calories AND vegan. NOW, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.... I would've loved to been able to write that and end it on a happy note however an issue occurred that was VERY off-putting for me as a customer. The very next day we found and ate at the Red Velvet we went back to grab food to go for our trip back home, I had also bought almost $100 worth of cakes to take back to my friends and family to try (some vegans some not), you know, to wow them with the news of the good food. I am not the kind of person to excessively worry about how well people are doing their jobs because with how many encounters we have with other businesses as consumers today, that's just too much worry. With that being said, I guess my fault was in the fact that I didn't check our bags to make sure everything was in there. I had only realized that when we got home 2 days later. When I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager he told me he'd look into it and get back to me. Now normally, I would take that as ""you're bugging me, I don't have time for this sh*t, so I'll pretend I care to get you off the phone."" But because I had such an initial pleasant experience there, I assumed for the best. Not getting a phone call back, I called back the next day and spoke with the manager again who told me their ""records and inventory"" match and they didn't have any extra food left. I told him I understood but I had basically paid $13 (6.50 each cake) for something I didn't even receive, and continued to ask him how he planned on rectifying this. Longer story short, this manager who originally came off as if he gave a crap basically told me I'm not gonna do the right thing which would have been to just refund me my money and move on. Instead he kept stuttering and ended up hanging up on me.


Now I'm not sure what day and age this man got his so-called ""business experience"" through or at, but a word to the wise when you go here for anything. Check your food be it to-go or ordering in and make sure you're gonna eat the food you order because chances are if this  guy did this to me for a simple to-go order he'll be a tight ass even if you found a dead rat under your panini, or simply didn't like the food. Most restaurants are smart enough to hold onto customers, NOT PUSH THEM AWAY! Especially the enthusiastic ones who like me live in another state and are your marketing tools! Word of mouth is a very powerful thing now a days, but that doesn't just go for the positive things people have to say about businesses like this, it goes for the NEGATIVE AS WELL!!!",njrHkV2VddXyva3s7dAfCQ,0,0,1,lrkUPCscOb1eVMsD45nsZw

Tobasco should not be used as a main flavor - it was so much that I just picked the nuggets out of my wrap & ate it w/ the side salad. I notified the waitress who let me know that the menu did say it was spicy but she didn't understand what I was telling her is their combo of flavors was killed by a flood of tabasco saturating the whole thing.

The service was good, the waiter had charm and patience with my order anxiety and my families slightly dysfunctional restaurant etiquette. My Wife and daughter #1 had the grilled veggie panini and salad. I had grilled chicken panini and salad and #2 daughter had pizza. My sandwich was marginal, chicken was warmed not cooked, the cheese barely melted and pretty flavorless. The ""salad"" was mixed greens from a bag and slathered in vinaigrette... Not a carrot, onion or tomato to be found, that was no salad it was a cry for help. I probably will give it another try just to seal the deal or let it go.

3517509,2010-10-03,1,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"Everyone knows Red Velvet Cafe as a vegetarian and vegan hot spot. That reputation has made this carnivore less than excited to ever try it. I finally gave it a try and I'm glad I did. Walking in, I wasn't sure if you're supposed to order at the cash register or grab a seat and wait for the staff to come to you. Looking a little confused, the manager walked us over to an empty table and told us someone would be with us shortly. We waited and waited and 10-15 minutes later someone finally dropped off menus.

I was pleasantly surprised to see chicken, ham, and even bacon in many dishes. According to the menu all of those dishes can be made vegetarian-friendly. We ordered a chicken panini with spinach and mushrooms and a caprese panini. The chicken panini was bland and I couldn't taste any of the pesto that was supposed to be in the sandwich. The other sandwich was decent. Both came with a side salad with a tasty vinaigrette dressing.

While the sandwiches were solid, if unspectacular, the best reason to visit Red Velvet Cafe is to taste their red velvet cake. It's said that they're only 150 calories. That's hard to believe because the cake was so rich, dense and moist and the topping was delicate, light, and sweet. It wasn't the best red velvet cake I've ever had (that award goes to the one at Nothing Bundt Cake) but for being under 200 calories it's excellent.

The service never really recovered from it's slow start. Our waiter was very personable, but he just wasn't around much. So, if you're looking for a quick meal you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, don't let their reputation scare you off. If you get shivers down your spine whenever someone mentions the word ""vegetarian"" don't worry... they have something for every taste. And, don't forget dessert.

3821025,2010-05-23,0,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"In that I herald from Chicago, land of fantastic, independent restaurants that express independence and uniqueness, it is no surprise that the lack of such things in Vegas is a point of contention for me.  A friend of mine invited me to have dinner with her at the Red Velvet Cafe. I did the requisite Yelp research and learned that, though it is oft described as a veg/vegan restaurant, it in fact serves some meat. Despite that fact, all recipes can be made either veg/ or vegan with meat replacement. I was impressed at the off-the-beaten-path vibe that the reviews suggested.

I entered the place, and was struck by the clean, pleasant decor,highlighted in red, but definitely not overdone.  The place is family-owned, and the greeting was friendly and welcoming.  My friend let me know that the service isn't fast, but we were hanging and enjoying the evening, so that wasn't an issue. The server was attentive, personable and very accommodating, which was nice. Additionally, the owner stopped by the table a couple times and even remembered my friend from her last visit!  I ordered their (somewhat acclaimed) spicy peanut chicken on rice, and my friend ordered the tortellini bolognese. Both entrees were under $15, and were very large - definitely 2 meals in one entree. I also saw others, who ordered salads, be ushered into mountains of fixins. Our meals were both delicious.  (I have been told that their sandwiches, wraps and more casual menu items are also great).

I was told by my friend that we had to share the place's namesake, the Red Velvet cupcake (which is really more of a little round cake - larger than a cupcake). Having been told that the delight is 150 calories total, 4 gm of fat, AND completely vegan, I was skeptical at best.  

It was phenomenal.  The cakes are made fresh daily, and this one was still warm from the oven.  The white, whipped frosting was sweet and light, while married to the red velvet cake which was more subdued in it's sweetness.  Divine.

Kudus to the Red Velvet Cafe for providing a unique, clean, friendly and delicious alternative to the parade of chain restaurants in this town.  It was like a little piece of Chicago in Vegas.

I recommend it highly.",sM0FJN2NfXBmPjOgz7tv-g,4,2,5,Sz4LJ2GIh7FZMWstRurJ0g
3826878,2010-12-18,8,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"Stopped by for lunch with a fellow Yelper the other day.  Heard this was an organic healthy, Vegan & Vegetarian hangout.....that also served the Carnivores, so I was eager to give it a try and see what it feels like to be a Vegan in a Steakhouse (since I'm a Carnivore).  

This was one of the most difficult reviews for me to write.  This place has so much potential.....I wish there was a 1/2 Star system because I want to give it 3.5 Stars and was on the fence for 3 or 4 Stars, here's why:

The menu is pretty extensive and has a lot of items that pique'd my interest, such as: Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos ($12.95), Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($7.99), Pepperoni Pizzetta ($8.95)....wait, what's a Pizzetta?  Turns out it's a Pizza.....come on, enough with the goofy names already, just call it a Pizza and call it a day!  A lot of stuff looked good and I was surprised at the number of items available for Carnivores....I ended up ordering their Fire Fries (Baked Fries topped with Hot Sauce, Pico de Gallo, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese $7) and a Chicken Panini (w/Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with Pesto $7.95).  The server asked if I wanted the Vegan Cheese on the Fire Fries....I passed and wanted the full monty.

To wash it down, I had some Iced Tea ($2.50)....which was awesome BTW.

The service was a bit slow.  It took some time for the waiter to take our order and the table next to us had to stop a busperson to get their order taken too.  It was 11:30 am and the lunch rush hadn't started yet, so I don't know what the issue was.  Anyway, it wasn't too bad but was borderline annoying.....another few minutes and it would have cost them a Star.

Our food came out after a short wait and I was surprised to see how HUGE the Fire Fries were!  I thought this was suppose to be a ""healthy"" restaurant?!  LOL  For a minute I thought I was in Claim Jumper!  The Fries look too good, so I attacked them first.  The top layer of Fire Fries were awesome....baked well and had good flavor.  However.....the middle and bottom portion of the Fries were undercooked and semi-raw, not good.  Also, the cook didn't spread the ingredients throughout the dish.....the Hot Sauce and Pico de Gallo was only in one corner of the dish, buried under the top layer of Cheese.  The other 3/4 of the dish was only melted Cheese and the Fries.  This was a damn shame because the portion with all of the ingredients was awesome!  The rest of it was just so/so.  He/she needs a lesson in making a consistent dish.

The Chicken Panini was next.....after I took one bite I realized I made a big mistake.  The combination of Fire Fries and the Chicken Panini wasn't good.  The sharp, spicy flavor of the Fire Fries overwhelmed my taste buds so when I ate my Chicken Panini it tasted bland.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but mine.  So my review of the Panini is incomplete.  The side Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette was awesome though.  

Another note....the Panini came with Whole Grain Bread as a default....I wasn't given an option for any other type of Bread, but saw other people with Panini's with what appeared to be White Bread....wish I had the choice.

Overall, this place has a lot of potential.  That's what made it so difficult for me to rate it....the 1/4 of the Fries that had all of the ingredients and were cooked thoroughly tasted awesome but the raw Potatoes in the middle was a turn off.  For now they get 4 Stars for their Vegan/Vegetarian menu options and the potential of their Fire Fries.

I took a couple bites of my friends shrimp tacos and I wanted more but that wouldn't be fair to her since I wouldn't share more than I spoon of my ""gdlk"" yellow curry.  The veggies were fresh and the yellow curry made absolutely perfect.  The chicken were cut into nice size bite pieces.  

I boxed my extras and waited for my red velvet cake.  I'll be honest, it taste like any other red velvet cake  but it's still good.  I like the cookies better.  In the past I've had their tiramisu, that was good too.  

Overall, I was very satisfied with my visit this time around!  I wish they were open at least one more hour later but this time was ""good times"".",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,2,1,4,y7CKj6aLYM8g9G_raMtJ8g

It was kind of confusing when you walk in because you don't know whether to sit down or wait to be seated or what- it seemed like the waiters/waitresses were just as confused as we were about this, haha.  

The food was pretty good.  It seemed like the cheese was Daiya, which is a cassava root cheese.  They boast soy cheese on the menu.  I guess I have kind of a problem with this because it is potentially mislabeled.  It is more for my husband's sake- he hates melted daiya and it was pretty much all over his food and he was expecting maybe teese or follow your heart cheeses.

I had the chicken avocado panini and the taco salad (went halfsies with hubby) and they were both pretty good.  I am a little bummed the chips were chemically baked lays, not exactly what I would call ""healthy"" but low cal nonetheless.  The taco salad was pretty good, the shell was what I thought made it special- otherwise I could have made that at my house.  The sandwich was super delicious.  My mother-in-law got a vegan buffalo chicken wrap, which tasted a lot like Franks hot sauce, which if they used the Franks buffalo sauce, then the wrap is not vegan because that sauce has milk products in it.  It was still really yummy and spicy though.  

I will definitely return here to try some of their other dishes next time I am in town.  I am stoked that a vegan friendly restaurant exists in a town where most people look at me like I am crazy for being a vegan.",N5CzlKsBUWR8IblSe7nL3Q,0,0,4,ZHLLPduWSJAc5FpQ_Zjizg

The food I think is hit or miss.  Having never been here before, I asked the waiter (who I think was the owner) what he recommended.  We started with the Avocado Quesadillas, which were pretty delicious, but heavy on the cheese (just a warning to you lactose-intolerant kids like me).  Then I had the Caprese Salad....and I give it a meh.  Lotsa lettuce, a good piece of chicken, and a crap ton of mozzarella and tomatoes.  Definitely perfect for the plain-dieting-eater, but I could done with a bit more fixins'.

For the main entree we had the Spicy Peanut Chicken, and this was a home run.  Great flavor and plenty of food for two.  Please try this dish if you go!  Also the owner said that they were happy to add heat to this dish if you wanna sweat a bit more....

Finally, the cake, OH THE CAKE.  As I said before, if you get nothing else, get this amazingly moist, warm, delicious Red Velvet Cake!

On a side note, the service was....well...weird.  I think we had a waiter, but didn't see him much, so ended up just kinda meandering over to the counter to order, pay, etc.  Coulda done with a bit more attention, which is why I downgraded from 4 to 3 stars.",HRA2E5C2OigQ5O-CxYZ9EA,0,0,3,dv00ckTdXxf-v-khtqgreQ

The food was solid, healthy --in concept, taste, and the feeling one has after eating. In the city known for its excesses, this was a welcome break. I appreciated the focus on having options --vegan, gluten-free and cleansing juices. Thoroughly enjoyed the Sweet and Sour Chicken (gluten-free) --that being said, don't expect it to be exactly like the belly-bloating wheat flour-coated, salt and sugar-loaded, fried in likely-rancid oil variety at other more, uhm, standard chain restaurants.

But really, I visited (twice!) for the gluten-free desserts. Blood sugar and calories be damned! Thankfully I carry supplements to aid for these, ahem, dietary indiscretions.  Some happened to be vegan as well so kudos to inventiveness for those creations. 

The cakes were simply delicious--moist, flavorful, the perfect creaminess, and the joy that they brought. So my favorites in order:

#1 Mocha cake (gluten-free)
#2 Tiramisu (glute-free/vegan)
#3 Red Velvet cake (gluten-free/vegan)
 
Also got a Mexican mocha which was not as noteworthy.

Service here was mixed, one great, the other time not so much. I did find that Thursday night crew to be stellar and welcoming.",3vv6HproTC_6rlhfZ3ikdQ,0,0,3,yeqaiIGMu0djnah53kIzng

There is no publicly available wifi here, and the espresso was HORRIBLE. I'm fairly sure they use that pop-a-canister into a machine type espresso instead of real coffee beans. I receive the check and it's around $5.00 for one double espresso. I don't think I've ever paid that much in the states, but I digress.

I tried to pay my bill with card since I only had a little cash on me and I wanted to tip my initial waiter since he was pretty attentive/nice. The (I think) manager came by, told me in a very condescending tone that I had to spend at least $10.00 to use card and left. I threw down a $5.00 and left this place.

Food is decent, but I think overpriced. The Red Velvet Cup Cake is good, and makes a great treat to bring to the office or to bring for individual deserts at a dinner party.

Slow, but friendly service.  Friendly, because I used to be a regular. 

I used to frequent this place, but no more, and here's why.......

The owner would tell me that he had to keep his price point "" a little higher because all the ingredients were special, like free range chicken"" and that ""all produce was organic"".

One day I was going into Costco, and guess who I saw taking out a large commercial push cart? The owner of Red Velvet Cafe, Sonil Tolani. 

There on his cart was tons of Chicken, Meat, Produce, and other things needed to run a successful restaurant.  That's okay, but don't give this BS, that his ingredients are more costly because they are special. 

Bottom line: Again, read Clint's review; I think it is accurate, but read other ""less than five star"" reviews. This owner is less than truthful about other things, such as the calorie content of their food.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,8,0,3,7MgWVAqOu2PC60sQdlkVzg

First, the customer service is and always has been TERRIBLE.  Back when the male owner was around, he would always chat with us and was very friendly.  But anyone and everyone else has always either been awkwardly quiet or just overall unfriendly.  You don't go here for the service... also don't call and ask questions over the phone.  That is a nightmare!  I can't count how many times I've just gone ""Forget it!"" after getting off the phone with them.

Some of the desserts are really, really good.  The cookies in particular.  That's a plus.  There's a few menu items that are really tasty too (vegan soft chicken tacos).  But there's just as many other regular menu items that are a total miss (crispy chicken wrap).  Most of the time, we only go to pick up a dessert or two.

Now, finally.  The great cookie calorie debacle of '13.  LOL.  Ok, so they lied about their calorie count.  I have always been secretly worried that they weren't upfront about all the desserts being vegan myself.  Now, without the calorie controversy, that wouldn't really sway me from going here.  However.... as one other yelper pointed out, if they could so easily and knowingly lie about the calorie count, what else are they lying about?  Do they use real butter?  Do they sneak in cheaper, non-vegan ingredients and still hike up the prices?

I also need to point out that there may be a sanitary issue... I saw something here before that would get them a big fat F on a health department test...  So, just be aware of that.",C-O1hKW7_ZIA3kZbQg0WmQ,6,0,2,GuNjzk2VKDoNJlj_lyoQPw

Although Red Velvet  self identifies as a ""vegan"" restaurant, it is, in fact  a traditional eatery that offers vegetarian/vegan  alternatives to their menu items. This is a wonderful option for carnivores who want to dance on the side of compassion, but it does not make it a vegan restaurant.

4632215,2012-04-16,1,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"Weighing out service, atmosphere and food altogether, I'd think it sums up a good 4 stars. Let's start with the good news and work our way down to bad:

FOOD: Honestly, the food was fantastic. My galpal and I ordered chicken provolone panini which came with a side of either salad or chips. We sticked with the greens. In a while, our dishes came in a big serving plate and mind you, the salad sauce was really good - balsamic vinegar and olive oil (at least that's what my friend said it was) $7.95 for an order that big is verrrry reasonable. 

ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere was contemporary and club music was playing in the pipe-ins. We were expecting a more ambient vibe. RVC felt more like a restaurant than a cafe seeing as we actually had waiters - It should practically be called Red Velvet restaurant. 

SERVICE: It could really do with more impovement on this part. When we got in, we sat down on some tables like we'd always do at a cafe. There were no barristas, some of the customers seemed to have a menu but we weren't given one so I went up to the food counter and asked for a menu. Our waiter seemed a bit hesitant, we'd think he's new but as far as recommending food selections or anything, we didn't get any. 

In the end, go there for the food. Don't expect to be able to read a book, bring in a laptop or do your homework at RVC's settings which encourages a more social atmosphere. Nonetheless, it's a place worth visiting and although we have yet to try their cookies, the chicken provolone paninis were enough to let us come back.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,2,0,4,20hslrmILI4pUiqZDg8Tcw

My boyfriend and I are VEGAN and were totally stoked that everything on the menu could be made vegan. I can't tell you how nice it is to go into a restaurant and be able to get ANYTHING you want on the menu. Really. It's unbelievable. 

Our waiter was super nice and accommodating both times. In fact, we saw the same guys each time we visited. They even recognized us! 

First Visit: 

I got the buffalo chicken wrappini, veganized. My boyfriend got a vegan taco salad. My friend got a vegetarian taco salad. Her boyfriend got vegetarian chicken tacos. The tacos were actually a dinner menu item, but our waiter asked the chef to make it special during lunch. We were totally impressed. We were also impressed with how CHEAP it is. Compared to vegan food on the Strip, this place is bargain basement prices. For dessert we were stoked that they had vegan red velvet cake. VEGAN RED VELVET CAKE. OMGAWD. Amazing. I was squealing the whole time. Everything was just so good, and service was top notch.

Second Visit: 

Our waiter seemed really busy this time around, and he kept getting confused, was slow to the table, etc. But he was still really nice. I ordered the mac & cheese veganized. My boyfriend got the taco salad again. My friend got a pasta but it was strong on the lemon flavor. I can't remember what her boyfriend got the second time. I was too busy paying attention to my delicious mac & cheese. This time we were all greedy pigs and got our own pieces of cake. I got tiramisu, my boyfriend got coconut orange cake, my friend ordered the banana peanut butter-something cake, and her boyfriend a tiramisu. Freaking incredible. 

I can't rave enough about this place. If I lived in Vegas, I would be broke regularly. It's really good food. It's not overly greasy, it's well made and it's a really friendly place!",OvQtTXbpzJFGhbjNqWjGOA,1,0,5,BOOfSoEiDUMGmKfc8vE85g

5049725,2011-03-14,2,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"Came for lunch with Elnino F. and Angela H. I'm down for healthy eating so I've been curious to give this spot a try. 

I ordered the Chicken Hummus Wrappini ($9.99) with the vegan ""chicken"" (I was curious!) and regular mozzarella cheese. It also had lettuce and tomato in a chipotle tortilla. The ""chicken"" and hummus part was decent, however there was a huge amount of lettuce in there in comparison to chicken, hummus or cheese and for $10, I was hoping I could get at least a even spread of topping and not get a bunch of cheap filler iceburg lettuce. At least pour on the hummus for some nice flavor in it but it was sparse and not evenly spread. After I ate the spot with the hummus it was bland and dry....It was frustrating to get a bite of promise of something good and then bite into bleak nothingness. It comes with a side and I chose salad. What I found odd was that my lettuce didn't look dressed so I moved it around and saw a few leaves were, but not enough to say it was ""dressed"". It's like they dressed one salad for someone, had a few left and poured it onto my plate and then forgot to dress up another batch and just threw it on my plate. I got vinaigrette after asking but sparse dressing, sparse hummus- is this supposed to make it uber healthy to not add so much sauce or are they just sauce nazis? Give me flavor! No flavor is unhealthy to my state of being! 

I traded a half wrap with Elnino and since his buffalo wrap came with a side sauce, it was better since I can pour on some flavor. 

I heard though desserts were shining. I know Red Velvet is the namesake, but since Elnino got that, I decided to get a comfort favorite of mine- chocolate chip banana bread pudding ($6.50). I was really curious how this was gonna be moist and tasty without the milk aspect of most puddings. At first it kinda tasted like it had some rum in it which was odd, but it was doable. Then I got to a banana chunk and stopped eating- the rummy flavor was made because the banana had gone bad and fermented my cake. 

Elninos warm red velvet was surprisingly good and the service was fairly nice and kept with the ice tea, but I left disappointed. I had a bit of a hope a good spot for veggies exist and after thinking about it this weekend and thinking of all the glowing things people have said to me, I'm rather upset to have paid $24 for that. That can get 2 delicious vegan entrees at my favorite Thai spot around town. 

I'm far from being a vegetarian but I know good flavorful food and this didn't make me want more. I'm from LA and I loved the vegetarian fare at a lot of the vegan spots about town. I loved it that I was a regular at Real Food Daily because it was creative and tasty. I was hoping and wishing that RVC  be my no brainer healthy meal spot but not even sure I want to go back- ever.

I can't give it more than a 2 when taste and value isn't present and makes me wonder how long they let pastries sit around if bananas were allowed to go rank. 

Maybe if you're vegan and don't have much food choices then this place would be okay to go to but I think you're better off going to a vegan friendly Asian place or getting sandwiches from Whole Foods.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,2,2,mEVkb9udpX3vuTe82fWwKg

Being the hip vegan/vegatarian cafe that it was, it was pricey but the food was mediocre. In fact, it's the same shit you can go a couple blocks over and buy at Whole Foods. 
Me and my friend ordered two different things. She got chicken burger with fries, and I got a panini sandwich witth tomato, we both opted for the vegan options. 
When we got our order, which took forever, we were brought pretty much the exact same thing, except different bread. The cheese was your standard out-of-the-package Daiya vegan cheese. They didn't try to even melt it down and mix it with some sort of flavoring to boost the choices coinciding with the menu. We had the exact same chicken patty. Again, same thing I make my lunches with to take to work.
What's the icing on the cake though, was my friends hamburger bun. It looks like that shit you buy at Wal-Mart, with its yellow poppy seeds and its large cookie cutter shape roundness. It wasn't vegan. I asked the guy at the front what it was and he said it was white-wheat bread, like we were stupid enough to believe that. Because it definitely wasn't.

This place just pretty much does your grocery shopping for you then charges you triple the price. Nothing is organic and truly made for you, it's all frozen shit from the supermarket that they pop in the microwave. 
I wish Vegas would get a REAL vegan/vegetarian cafe, cause this place is pathetic.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,9,5,2,5nUn-G2iYyFgrU14DetCGQ

I will make sure to revisit and update my review accordingly. I love, love, love the premise! Vegas desperately needs more health-conscious, vegan-friendly restaurants--and Red Velvet fits the bill for those perfectly. I liked the decor, modern, glitzy, fun. Service lacked however. I tried to get in and out as quickly as possible (was on my lunch break), and it was tough to even find the waiter, not even talking about talk to him. He was nice enough, but very difficult to find. 

I liked the food--it was creative and simple at the same time. Although the food did not ""wow"" me, I appreciated its healthfulness. I liked the healthy, baked fries. I did not particularly liked the buffalo ""chicken"" wrap. I found it to be a bit  tasteless and not as described. The deserts did not strike me as very creative.

It makes sense as to why it was so dead last time I went in. This review is a bit late, I went here probably back in March or so. Maybe a little later. Anyways, I am on a very strict diet due to health issues and there are not many restaurants I can eat at without having complications later. So when my husband told me about this place, I was very eager to check it out. When we arrived, it was clean, not busy, and the waiter was fantastic! I ordered the gluten free chicken, spinach, panini with french fries and let me tell you IT WAS PHENOMENAL. I can't get over how delicious it was. I've never had anything that was gluten free taste so yummy. (And I love that every choice had a gluten free option and is ORGANIC)  My husband Ordered the taco salad, which wasn't too bad. At that time I didn't care much for it cause I couldn't get over how tasty this panini was. Haha.

5345035,2010-09-26,0,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"It appeared very obvious that Red Velvet Cafe would win me over, upon the moment we arrived- due to their lovely decor, likely furnished by IKEA. The modern bar stools & high tops were aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, not very practical when dining in such a confined area. I couldn't really get comfortable while eating, which was a turn off, at first.

To start out, we ordered ""Chicken/ Vegan Nuggets"". When I read this on the menu, I thought ""Oh cool, you have an option to get either chicken or vegan style"". Apparently, I was very wrong. Our vegan nuggets were average, definitely not chicken, but not horrific either. I really enjoyed the tangy red sauce that they were served beside. I'm still kicking myself for not asking what it was- I wanna go with...something vinegar based?!

For our main course, my boyfriend & I shared the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. I wasn't really sold on this when we ordered it. Not because I'm shy about spicy things, but because its described as "" Lettuce, Tomato, Buffalo Sauce, Ranch and Cheese"" (I mean really, how exciting can you be, Buffalo Chicken Wrap?). Despite its very bland description, there are so many complements it deserves! First of all, you know when you're eating a wrap & its hard to take bites without pieces of lettuce, meat, or other veggies escaping because they are too long? How about chopped lettuce (no yucky iceberg pieces) mixed with cheese, lightly covered in ranch & cubed grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce- all cozy in a wheat wrap. Very easy to eat, without excess food particles falling out! I also loved the fact that it was served with baked chips. I give this wrap 4 stars!

Lets get down to my favorite part of every meal...DESSERT! So, you can't go to the Red Velvet Cafe without ordering Red Velvet Cake. No regrets there, at all. Although I was very shocked when I found out that the entire piece of cake that I consumed was only 150 calories (not that I'm couting) AND completely vegan!!! It tasted like a heart attack, although its significantly less volatile than that Little Debbie Snack Trash your mom put in your lunch box. Without a doubt, the best red velvet that I've ever experienced. The frosting was heavenly, the cake was rich, & the strawberry on top- refreshing.

5390822,2012-05-02,2,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"My first review!   (please, take a seat)

Let me start off with the obligatory ""I'm not a vegetarian/vegan"" statement that I think should accompany reviews of places that cater to these unfortunate souls (kidding!)

Been here thrice.  First time was a year and a half ago or so, and I tried the Chicken, Artichoke and Spinach Panini with Vegan cheese (I'm lactose intolerant :( ).   This was my first time trying Vegan cheese.    What do they say about the first time?  Awkward?  Painful?  ""They"" were right.   I have successfully avoided vegan cheese since, and though the rest of the ingredients were fine, I avoided RVC in a ""guilt by association"" sort of reasoning.

Finally getting the courage to go back, I tried their Taco Salad last week based on all the positive Yelp reviews it seems to garner.   Well I'm happy to say they are much deserved.  First, it's HUGE.  I only ate half and am convinced it could successfully feed a family of vegans for a week.   The baked(?) taco shell was the highlight, and within it contained a ton of rice, lettuce, chunks of chicken (vegans can substitute for a lot of of non-meat meats), and salsa (no cheese for me, vegan or otherwise).  I thought the taste of all the ingredients was spot on and I definitely didn't walk away hungry.  

Went there again for lunch today and went with the Chicken Burger (hold the cheese) with Baked Fries.    I'm officially in love with this place (statute of limitations on Vegan Cheese infractions has run out).   The Chicken Burger was almost exactly like the Chicken Sandwiches you can get at Wendys, McDonalds, etc except that it actually had flavor and was made with fresh ingredients.   The Baked Fries still had the same great taste of fried french fries and to me the texture wasn't off-putting in the least.   For $7.95 I thought the meal was a steal.

All three of these experiences were getting take-out for lunch, and the service was friendly enough and I've never had to wait more than a few minutes before my food was ready (they usually say 20 minutes when I call it in and I do as I'm told).  

I was close to giving this place 5 stars based on the last two experiences, but I think I just spontaneously decided to reserve 5 star reviews for places that provide me with a life altering experience (and places that have never served me Vegan Cheese)",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,DcU03g_sAPSVC-6UFBdNMQ

My family got the red velvet cake, Vegan panini with vinaigrette dressing, Banana cream cheese cake, and vegan buffalo wings. The panini was good, because of the oil and fatty daiya cheese, and the pesto sauce in it. I wouldn't say the salad that took half of the plate was fresh though. I thought the red velvet cake was okay. It was sugary and sweet. My whole family thought the desserts were great. 

I guess the workers just served. They just minimally tried to do their job. Get orders and give the food, and bickering at the back. They can get a bit defensive, so like what china plates warn: "" treat with extra care."" 

All in all this is what I thought: 

Food: Good, not great. Was missing punch factor. I liked the vegan bakeries at home better though. 
Service: Ehh
Ambiance: Chillax 
Sensitivity: Afterwards, my body had no severe reaction.

Because that is what you are paying 8$ and up for. Factory. Made. Shit.
Not even seasoned factory patties, oh no. 
For you meat eaters let me break it down for you, factory made vegan/vegetarian patties are the equivalent of the hamburger patties you get at Mickey D's and Burger King. At least there they know it's cheap crap, and you get the price for it. Here, they charge you a ridiculous price for stuff you can go to ANY store now days and buy yourself, make yourself, and it would be better and cheaper for you.
My friend brought me here, bless her soul, because she wanted to try the highly touted veggie food, since she is converting to the green side. 
So here is the meal we got after half an hour of waiting (where mind you others who arrived after us were served waaay before us):
I got the grilled chicken burger, vegan style, which consisted of the vegan patty (a very thin, small patty not big enough for the ENORMOUS bun they throw it on) with mostly iceberg lettuce and one sliver of tomato, plus thawed out Daiya cheese shreds and the most lethargic fries I've ever had. They claimed that the fries were baked, but most of them were cooked just enough to not be raw, but were so soft that it was basically a mound of unmashed potatoes. Oily too.
She got the panini sandwich, which was the same thing, just different bread. And baked chips. LAYS BAKED POTATO CHIPS. WTF!? This place claims it's organic and healthy, but they serve LAYS CHIPS here!? That shit is so processed they legally should not be allowed to put 'potato' on the bag!
The only logical reason for this place to have the reputation it does in the vegan/vegetarian world is because they have no real competition. And the location is in an area where people are too rich and lazy to make their own meals, so they go here and feel better about themselves.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,5,1,2,7ZCsmNFQJIhckr4QtZVz7A

We had the red velvet cupcake, lemon cake, and tiramisu all of which are vegan and delicious and very hard to believe they are ""low in calories"".  Now for the bad, our lunch.  My mom and I each ordered a taco salad without any meat, real or vegan.  The thing had tons of rice, very few black beans, a small bit of cheese and avocado and was served with salsa.  I had to ask for a lot of extra salsa because it was so bland.  When the server came over to bring the salsa, I mentioned to him that we both had the salad without any meat and still had to pay the full $11.95 (completely outrageous for the quality). I asked if we could have some extra avocado to make up for it.  He immediately got an attitude explaining that ""everyone tries to modify the food here, so we absolutely won't do any modifications!"" He then added that we could of course ""order"" some extra avocado for $1.  Of course $1 isn't a big deal, but that is also why he could've just given it to us, his attitude was a huge factor in our dining experience.  My 4y/o who was sleeping at the time we ordered, woke up and was hungry.  They do not have a kids menu and the guy behind the counter said people usually order mac/cheese or the pizzettas for kids.  Each of which were $9.  I ordered the vegan pizzetta for him and hoped for the best.  It took forever to make and there weren't many other people in the restaurant.  My son was seriously crying because it was taking so long.  It came out and looked ok.  Too bad I tasted it and it was awful.  I am shocked to hear people rave about the vegan cheese here because it was really horrible and slimy.  My mom also tried it and said the same thing.  My poor hungry son barely would eat one piece.  I was too afraid to send it back after the attitude the waiter gave us.  Oh, I should also mention that it comes with a very plain green salad-only greens and vinaigrette.  Really, how many 4y/o would eat that?  You would think they could at least have given him some baked fries or chips, but remember, absolutely no modifications here!  By the time we ordered dessert, we got a new server (not sure if the snotty one didn't want to deal with us or what) the new server (I wish I knew his name) was Hispanic and wonderful, so sweet and nice, Thank-God.  We ordered the delicious desserts from him and even ordered 2 to go.  Even though the desserts were decent sized, they still seemed over-priced.  Our dessert bill was $30!  I should also mention our gross lunch bill was $44 including a tip.  So, we spent about $75  which just seems completely outrageous, could have had a fancy dinner out for that.  I would NEVER come back here for the food, but would get the desserts to go again sometime.",Ncgjgfhjl27x-V7xG2Rk3Q,0,0,2,X-TvvA2_vPveCtrQNH5ZZw

All of the Ingredients were very fresh and flowed well together, the spinach was fresh as well as the artichoke hearts. and they did not skimp on any of the ingredients used. One of the only things that I think could be improved on is the side options for the sandwiches.

Cons: SUPER SLOW SERVICE, 2/3 people complain of a stomach ache after eating here.

Today when my BF and I dined at RVC we waited about twenty minutes for an order of fire-fries and a panini with fries. I saw the kitchen staff didn't fire my panini until the fires were finished and waiting on our plates to be served, getting cold. When the food did arrive my panini was barley grilled and cheese not melted entirely or throughly, and the panini didn't have all the fixings described on the menu.

This is third time in a row I've dined at RVC and received super slow service, making today's experience not a fluke. 

Additionally, my tummy starts hurting immediately after I finish my meal. I am a vegan who eats very clean, mainly plant based foods and whole grains. Possibly my tummy hurts because I'm not use to eating products like vegan meats and cheeses? But my BFF also complains of upset stomach after a RVC experience and will not go back.

So when I was invited to go to Red Velvet Cafe with a co-worker for lunch on a Friday in Lent I figured it was a great idea.  I've given up eating meat on Fridays so I thought there would be good Vegetarian/Vegan options for me.  

When we entered, there was a couple empty tables and a counter with a register, which appeared to be where you place your order.  At the counter we were instructed to take a seat and we would be waited on.  We took a couple laminated menus and sat at a table just across from the register.  After looking over the menu I selected a Salmon Quesadilla from the March specials menu.  After an unnecessarily long wait, we were finally visited by our server who was the same person that told us to take a seat from behind the register.  I was then informed that they were out of Salmon.  The 2 other members of my party ordered and I asked for another minute to find something else.  However, it took so long for our server to return that everyone else's food arrived shortly after I placed my 2nd order.  The other two orders at the table had errors (missed substitutions, meat product instead of real meat) but they didn't want to spend the extra time to complain about it.  My food finally arrived as everyone else was finishing theirs.  Being on a 1 hour lunch break, I had to request my order to go, because I needed to be back at work.  They slid my sandwich and handful of baked Lays into a box and I ate my lukewarm sandwich in my office at work.  Food was decent, but not worth the $11 bucks I paid and the lousy service I received.  Based on other reviews this is not uncommon for this location.

Other things to know before going:
The only thing ""Vegetarian/Vegan"" about this restaurant is the fact that anything on the menu can be ""Made Vegan"".  This means they substitute the real meat for fake soy based meat product.  Almost all the items on the menu contain real meat and will have to be ""Made Vegan"".  I also noticed that the same grills/griddles are used for meat and vegetarian/vegan, incase you care about cross contamination.  For a place that markets themselves as a vegetarian/vegan restaurant they do not have many non-meat selections.

There is a $10 minimum on all Credit and Debit Purchases.  This is against merchant agreements by Visa and Mastercard.  But with the prices, you shouldn't have a problem spending less than $10 bucks.

There are no fountain sodas, everything is canned/bottled.

Would I go again?  Maybe, but only if I was eating meat and had a few hours to waste on lunch.  If you're looking for somewhere to get a meal on a 1 hour schedule, look somewhere else.  If you're a strict Vegetarian/Vegan that is sick of eating soy meat product, look somewhere else.",NMaLfCZ1aEyMgbQSbVK-4g,1,0,1,s69Mae9NRbqKwoYXSp34mg

We didn't get a full meal here this time around, but I do recall using a few moans and suggestive metaphors to describe the taco salad I ordered on a previous visit. After a very pleasant exchange with a very pleasant employee (Alex?) with unending patience for our indecisiveness at the dessert display (tiramisu, chocolate peanut butter cake, banana split cake... it's seriously hard to not buy everything in the case), we wound up with a maple cake and half a dozen chocolate chip cookies.

The maple in the maple cake was delicate and understated, and I suspect illicit substances in the icing because it was just plain addictive. The cake itself was spongy and moist and full of flavor, as cake should be. More, please.

The cookies were nice and soft, and the chocolate chips they used were mighty fine. There was a little bit of a health food taste to them, but in the best possible way. Not my all time favorite cookies, but I certainly wouldn't turn them down.

So go to Red Velvet. Eat yourself into diabetic shock. Give Alex all of your tip dollars. You won't regret it.",BDUIaeP_ZzL0vOdXqCcgxQ,1,0,5,NxmNPnrX6Eg1ZCyowFrIxQ

Anyways, ordered the vegan chicks cheddar panini and a similar vegan chicken wrap.   Both were disgusting to put it simply.  I have no idea what type of mock meat it was but they did not do it any justice in the way it was cooked.  In fact the 'bacon' on my sandwich was NOT cooked at all.. Vegan or
Not that is gross.  No flavor in the wrap, just felt like mushy rice with undercooked mock
Chicken.  

I did get a piece of vegan banana chocolate cake as well which was alright.  Typical vegan baked good.

When ordering I asked the 2 girls behind the counter questions about the vegan meat and cheese like what kind it was or made of and all they said was 'it's just cheese or meat but vegan' not much else.  Perhaps if they could of answered I wouldn't have ordered what I got and wouldn't have had such a nasty experience.  I didn't even finish my meal, that's rare.

5787024,2011-09-20,0,t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q,"We ate at Red Velvet Cafe after a long afternoon of swimming and roasting in the hot late-summer Vegas sun. We ordered quite the variety for three adults and two kids and we all enjoyed our food very much!

We ordered take-out so I cannot comment on service other than to say that my husband went in to pick up our order and the store employee said ""I should recognize you by now!"" and we had to laugh because we've never been there before. Heh. She must have thought he was someone else.

+ Let us discuss dessert first! 160 calories for SIX (yes, SIX!) amazing, delicious, SOFT, chocolate chip cookies? Yes, please!

- The Red Velvet cake itself tastes like play doh. The frosting is delicious, though, and mixed together they are yummy enough. I wouldn't order the cake again. (PS - Don't name your restaurant after your least yummy menu item! Free advice!)

+/- We shared an order of the cheddar bacon fries. They were ok. Sometimes when I am desperately craving fries and I don't want to go out, I make fries out of fresh potato at home. These tasted a lot like what I, the uneducated only moderately good cook, can cook without any thought. They were tasty and they were covered in cheese and turkey bacon, so I'm not complaining. But baked fries are generally rubbery and kinda blah-ish. Don't expect the texture of fried fries.
The fries were quite uneven in the way that they were cut, so some of them were overcooked, others were undercooked. This is easily remedied when the fries are cut evenly.

+ The taco salad was very good. Very big and very filling. My husband ate half-ish of it at lunch and my son finished it for an after-pool snack. Everyone liked it a lot.

+ The portion of guacamole is enormous and the guacamole is quite good. They don't give you enough chips, though.

+ I had a chicken, spinach, mushroom paninni, which was very very very good. Even as take-out it was warm and melty and yummy. The sandwiches come with baked lays. I would have preferred salad or something, I think. Processed chips aren't my idea of a yummy side to accompany a delicious sandwich.

+/- We ordered a Mac and Cheese so everyone could try it. It wasn't the greatest, but if we're talking about healthy food, it is good. And it will satisfy your Mac and Cheese craving without forcing you to eat straight Velveeta melted on noodles. :)

+ The tuna melt was good, but pretty standard among tuna melts.

+/- The veggie grill was good, but my daughter thought it was ""too sweet"" I don't know what on it was sweet, but that's what she said.

In closing, I will say that I'll definitely go back. The food was great and just the cookies alone are reason enough to go in.

Yum!",55nh4phmUp84Z3UZoxpNCw,0,0,4,RMlOh5WKNTpD07GhApEmSQ

When we walked in, it looked like there was a speed dating service going on. The tables were set up weird and there were two separate rooms. No one acknowledged that we had walked in and there was no sign to inform us whether we should wait to be seated or seat ourselves. Finally we walked to the kitchen/register area and someone asked if we were picking up or dining in. We told him we were dining in and someone else told us to take a seat in the next room if we didn't have reservations. 

We waited probably 15 minutes and were seated. The waiter tried wayyyyyy too hard to impress us with everything he said and every question that he answered. We ordered the firecracker baked fries to start. They were terrible, too much cheese and soggy/drenched in tabasco (or some sort of thin liquidy hot sauce). I got a zucchini and veg chick'n dish that was entirely too bland. I asked our waiter if I could get some soy sauce and he never came back. My boyfriend got the ham and cheese panini, neither of us liked it either. 

When we were getting ready to leave we asked a woman standing behind the dessert display case if we could get the last apple pie (they were mini) to go. She then informed our waiter that we wanted an apple pie and we saw him carry it away, knowing that he was going to heat it up and put it on a plate. Surely, he did just that. So we had to tell him that it was TO GO, so he transferred it into a plastic container (PAY ATTENTION) and we left. 

No one checked up on us, the waiter was annoying, none of the employees communicated to each other while we were there, the food was gross, the atmosphere was off and it was too expensive. I just know that I will never go back nor will I recommend this place.",__2Xu2F0Z1gAodYpIdOsCQ,5,2,2,4XIjnOVcC8Y3RFR0GcBKHA

The owner spent some time with us explaining his menu and philosophies about food. He was very nice and I appreciated his focus on health (although I am not sure about the sole focus on low-cal/low-fat).

The food was 5 stars, but red velvet can improve on the ambience(turn down the overhead lights) and some nice beer/ wine selection would go a long way. Not sure if they allow byob.
