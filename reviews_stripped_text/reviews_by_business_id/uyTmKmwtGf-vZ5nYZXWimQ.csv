  EVERYTHING was LUKE warm except the CALIFORNIA ROLL which had steam rising from it when I opened the box that contained the freash water eel and rice!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I lived in JAPAN for 2 yrs. and NEVER had a bad delivery, nor in Calif., New York, Chicago, etc.

I ordered a roll and chicken teriyaki. I know what chicken teriyaki is and what it tastes like. This was not chicken teriyaki. It was some kind of oil drenched fried chicken and I'm not sure if the pan that they used had been cleaned or if it was their version of chicken teriyaki but all I could taste was grease and garlic.

My son ordered AYCE and was very disappointed.  The rice was hard, and the color of the fish was off from what he has experienced before.  Except he did say the octopus was pretty good.

I ordered vegetable tempura, and it was not very good and pretty a small portion for the price.  There was half a mushroom, a potato, an onion ring that wasn't even covered in batter, and two other things that were decent, like squash or something.  

I also ordered a vegetable roll.  How can you screw that up, right?  When it came to the table, it looked great!  Very colorful.  But the rice was so thick and pasty, and the chef put seaweed into the roll, and it was not good at all.  Couldn't finish it.

The sushi rolls were small too and way overpriced for what you get. I had a shrimp tempura roll that I was not nearly as good as grocery store sushi. We also ordered a tuna poki that was not fresh. It didn't even look red, but a cloudy dull color. I only ate a bite and had to spit it out and worried about becoming ill.

We decided to do all you can eat and the waitress told us we could do half orders which I always like, you can try more and not have to worry about eating a lot of something that wasn't good. Halfway through our lunch though the sushi chef said ""no more half rolls!"" Is it so much harder to make a half portion or something. Like I said, we were the only ones in the restaurant so we definitely weren't adding to his blistering workload.
Next the quality of the fish was questionable. The tuna poke had strands in it equivalent to the gristle, or cartilage, in meat. All the fish lacked flavor, had a poor texture and worst of all, everything was literally room temperature. That is the last thing you want when eating sushi. 
The staff worked slowly, again, only customers in the restaurant, the waitress offered no recommendations because ""I don't eat sushi."" 
Needless to say, I probably won't be going back even with all of their ""eat here we are new"" ploys and specials.",5v6LjnZ5rzl-ZBNvuMezSQ,4,2,2,09Y4KyLjr__2oxjQsF741A
3757882,2014-12-11,0,uyTmKmwtGf-vZ5nYZXWimQ,"We ordered four rolls and an order of nigiri for delivery. We waited for over an hour and a half and then called, and they told us that the delivery boy had left 40 minutes ago and should be there soon (the estimated delivery time was 75 minutes). We waited a total of 2 hours before getting our food, and we noticed that the amount of food handed to us seemed small. When we looked closer and checked our receipt, we found that we were missing a roll. We called them, and they said they would give us store credit which we didn't want. I didn't want store credit because I didn't want to order from them again. I asked for just a refund, and they said no, they made it sound impossible for a refund. I asked if they could just send us another roll, and he said he would have to call the owner. He called us back and asked us how many containers we had received, to which we said two, and he said that his delivery boy told him that he had given us three. We said no, we only got two and he asked us to double check, as if we could somehow miss a container. We told them we got the three rolls and the nigiri, but not the missing roll. He proceeded to argue with us, saying that the nigiri had been packed with the missing roll, and pretty much accusing us of lying. We argued and argued, offering to send pictures of the containers with the rolls we had received written on them (they write the name of the roll over the respective roll so people can tell them apart) and even saying that if they delivered the new roll, the delivery boy could look through our trash to prove that we were not lying. Finally they agreed to deliver the roll, but that it would take TWO MORE HOURS to get here, and they didn't even offer to give us something for our trouble, not even a free appetizer or something.

We finally contacted eat24, which we ordered through, to see if they could help us. They were able to get the restaurant to refund us the roll, thankfully, but it was too much trouble. We will not be ordering from them again.",wwt50S3s-84ePc5T7CjpHQ,3,0,1,C38rDyMXxnYUVw8uMNHy6A

3965351,2014-06-30,0,uyTmKmwtGf-vZ5nYZXWimQ,"This place is convenient for me because it offers delivery service and is between my office and home. I've done both Delivery and AYCE. I will go back to this restaurant for both any time I can.

Delivery service:
I get the impression this is not their primary function. The driver I suspect is the owner, and he's nice enough. To be honest I try to make sure it's worth their time, and my delivery orders are almost always over $60. I use the eat24hours.com service to order. It's not the fastest service, the quoted time is 45-60 minutes, and I've have it delivered at 75 minutes once. When they are not busy I've received the order once at around 30 minutes. Overall I'm fine with this, as I said it's not their primary function. Infact some might consider delivery sushi a sin.

Order process is a little limited. This isn't the fault of Arata, since we go through a 3rd party. They do follow notes and comments on rolls and upgrades.

Presentation is always good. I order deep fried rolls they come hot and the taste is always great. Now with that in mind my hot rolls come packaged with cold rolls or sashimi. I can deal with luke warm fish. So normally it's not even a concern. I had have luke warm sashimi and I've re-chilled it for comfort before. They usually include extra sauces at my request on the notes. I dont have to pay extra for basic requests. Also they write the names of each roll on the packaging which is helpful for beginners.

As for the quality this has also been great. Taste is amazing and the sauces are adequate, and not watered down. I've never felt shorted by different items. I have not really enjoyed crab, then again I avoid it where possible from ALL sushi restaurants so I can't fault Arata.


AYCE service:
Only done this once. It was pleasant and I had no issues. I sat at the bar and the service was quick and they provided everything I wanted. Taste as always is amazing. The chef I had was new he was a little unsure of himself, but the experience was fine, and he tried hard on the rolls. Which I deeply enjoyed the experience. There are other AYCE dinning options around and I try to branch out when possible.  Though there was nothing wrong with this location.


I will do both services again. I am deeply thrilled with the delivery service.",EkaDpEaJGyXG4Jaq8uQoDg,2,1,4,6AXSfk4lOgJgB9wiATMe9w

4558386,2013-07-15,0,uyTmKmwtGf-vZ5nYZXWimQ,"I work like three seconds from this place, which is enough for me to visit it whenever. Thus I've been here a few times and have also ordered from them, so I feel like I'm now qualified to comment on it. 

First of all, yes, this is the same sushi place that was here before, but it's under a new name and management and the like. The decor is a lot nicer than it was before, but I kinda dislike going in and seeing the owner (I think it's the owner) coming in and trying to fix a sink. I get it, dude, you're bootstrapping... awesome. But maybe don't do that when the place is open for business? The price is alright: I think I paid $26 for AYCE, and I believe they offer an AYCD for an extra $6. I just get water, though, so I can't comment on the drinks. 

The service from the staff here has been consistently good. They're really good about making sure I'm not wanting water, more sushi, ginger... what have you. They clear my table quickly and are really polite. It's not necessarily five-star service, but they're good. The sushi chef, too, is good. Twice I've had service from the younger chef, but his name escapes me. He's really good when I don't know what I want about suggesting something I might like based on what I've gotten already, and is also a friendly dude. The older sushi chef is also good, though he's less of a talker and more of a doer. That's cool. 

The sushi here is good. The flavor of the stuff is solid, and some of the rolls (Surf Turf, Japanese lasagna) were really good. Having said that, the sushi isn't a home run. There's something missing that I can't place that keeps this place from going up a notch. It's good, but not great. I think this isn't the place you'd bring a date you were looking to impress in terms of quality/flavor alone. 

Ultimately, I think the food here is more along the lines of three stars, or maybe 3.5, but not quite a 4. I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt with the four in hopes they grow into it.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,3,1,4,nM3AyhsHKvqrjCEPbOBZaQ

All of the rolls were fresh, dessert was included of red bean ice and I gave the 3 year old my mochi because I was beyond stuffed.

Service was pleasant and attentive although they seemed to be out of their raspberry sake and white zinfandel. Other than those little hiccups I'm willing to go again.

The rest tasted and looked like something you would get out of a Gas station. It was way Too expensive /for crappy quality and it took almost 2 hours for them to deliver.. wtf.,p25jjl3Ywtyp6SgMDiNjeg,0,0,1,D14FsuX3FzrFyXGXKsJUBA

It was a strawberry ice cream that was in a freeze dried thing I am still not shure how it's done but omg I had 2 so good. The prices for sushi traditional or non traditional are very affordable compared to what I have seen here so far.I still cant for the life of me figure out the ice cream thing.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,1,0,4,v6dIPPSIPsBg0xLNqH62gw
