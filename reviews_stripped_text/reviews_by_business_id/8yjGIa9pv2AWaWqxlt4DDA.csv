Not a lot of people here but it's only been open a few weeks; hopefully that changes.  The bartender's were great!  Awesome mojitos and really great food.

We had the chicken skewers, meatballs and churros.  Everything was really flavorful and unique.  The bartenders were extremely nice and friendly.  I wish I remembered her name but she was gorgeous!

A really nice break from the usual 'Strip' stuff.",-7UURB-qhCeST2DGjjRyeQ,0,0,5,6C6CaEz2VM1YISRtvw-TEw

We started first of course with some drinks. My boo ordered a strawberry basil margherita....when I asked her if she liked it she simply replied ""this shit is hella good, I'm getting another!!"" I order a cucumber mojito...I like a stiff drink but mine was a little rough....I won't judge it on that as I'm sure every other one they make is excellent. I sent mine back and had it replaced with the diablo dulce. It was different it had some rum pineapple juice habenero and garlic....I'm sure there was some other stuff but I'm a little fuzzy writing this at the moment.
We went on to order the chicken empanadas....they were excellent....get them....they were the perfect amount of flaky and crunchy....not too much oil....after that we had the spicy tuna chiviche....it was good as well....big chunks of. We had the ""hamachi"" as well...that was excellent....cut like sashimi but cooked in citrus juice. We were up for more....we decided to ask rauqel what she liked....she said the dates....I said no thanks we are already on one haha (that was corny but who cares its fun)...we ordered the dates and calamari.....the dates were awsome...super sweet and wrapped in bacon....that calamari was just calamari....not too special...we finished off with the short rib tacos......if you decide to visit ca√±a order those for sure....they are good....we were stuffed.....good food, good atmosphere,  and pretty unique drinks......its all reasonable tapas pricing too....go to townsquare and try it if you haven't before.

Ok the service at the bar Not so attentive for patron rather they are more interested in what is happening in their lives, second the food it was ok the best is the empenada, THE WORST is the MEAT BAllS please owners read this remove it and fire your cook.third the  rib is good but it tasted like it was boiled in BBQ sauce for 20hrs, bcuz melted in your mouth, not so great.

786066,2010-02-13,4,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"I'm surprised this place is getting such great ratings. They market themselves as a ceviche place, and the ceviche is terrible. 

This was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time. 

When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. 

The first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. 

Finally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent. 

I was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor. 

I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat. Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed.",5jvSmFteDF5ghyTZ4D1PBg,4,4,1,M02txxaoA6YTRK7f5QPohw
814680,2010-05-23,5,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"This review is not about the food but about the hosts. We went in for an early dinner. As we arrived, we are told by the hostess that we cannot be seated inside since the place was booked by a very large group. I asked if there was a comfortable area outside since I was still cold from seating outside in the shade on a very windy day at Blue Martini. 

We're told not to worry since we'd be sheltered from the wind. We get outside and we asked to sit at the only table located in the sun. 

As we are looking at the menu and finally warm up, the hostess comes back to our table and asked us to move to another table in the shade since apparently, the table in the sun is going to be used by the big party. Which by the way, we have yet seen. 

We decided to leave. Very unhappy. 

We ended up going to Nu right downstairs and were seated on the patio right next to a very pretty and warm fire pit.",WQmsiMpsbLCQWjhsEhPIkw,5,4,1,-pZNSJ9UxtFhWvizc0t_oQ

We ordered the meatballs, hamachi, beef tenderloin, calamari and they were all great. We also ordered the Cevichi mushrooms but that was the only fail out of the things we ordered cuz it was very citrusy and a bit sour so we had it sent back and the waitress recommended the spicy tuna and it was very good!

Met the General Manager and he hooked it up with their special dessert that evening which was with ice cream, fried bananas and chocolate and like some waffle haha, IT WAS AWESOME!

It was a bit pricey for the portions that came out but its a nice place to take a date out to and the atmosphere was really chill...

I had the habanero pepper jack and cheese, it was VERY SMALL and tasted not too much different than Kraft Mac&Cheese. I heard a lot about ""TRUFFLE CHIPS"" but all I could taste was the truffle oil. The ceviche was okay but overpriced. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and the patio is great as it looks over townsquare park. I would possibly go back for sangria but nothing else...

929917,2010-06-21,8,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"Waitress was talking with some people at the other side of the bar. After 5-7 min waiting she came, put the menu in front of me and ask, with that very well known impersonal smile, ""what do you like to start"", ... I ask about Mojito, Seviche classic, ...and if there was any possibilities to turn the TV to sports, like soccer...(Consider the situation: World Cup; Brazil-Coast of Ivory game; only two girls and a guy at the bar talking on my left side and just me, in front of that TV, watching ""Jeopardy...."") The waitress told me: I don't like soccer, I don't watch it, so, I don't know where they broadcast the game"".  I just start  seeping my Mojito and forgot about the game. Minutes later came the seviche (tiny and good), and a second Mojito. 
Just before I finish, another couple arrives and ask about Brazil vs. Coast of Ivory's game, and then, just after 20-30 min after my first request, the bartender ask one of the guys working in the kitchen how to find the soccer game on ""...that TV""
Funny end: the TV audio was OFF=MUTE=SILENT (natural, in a bar environments, right?) and the waitress was swapping channels, back and forward, until I said, ""STOP...there is...that one..."" (It was the Hispanic channel of Univision), and then,  she said the most interesting part of her appearance that night: ""Oh, that's why couldn't find it, it is in Spanish and I don't understand that language!

Food- I came here the night before Easter Sunday. So, I was not able to try any of the meat dishes.  The food is a bit disappointing. After you have the tapas at Firefly, it is difficult  to match the quality, quantity and taste of the food. 

Location-The location is great. Across from Blue Martini and steps away from the movie theaters. Town square is a great location. 

Price- A bit on the steep side. You do not get enough bang for your buck. You cannot really expect much because of the expensive rent  these places have to pay at Town Square. 

Service - It is OK, nothing special. 

Overall- I am a bit disappointed. Maybe it is because of the Five Star ratings that this place received. I expected a lot.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,7,7,2,fxqiH1JwuPbJ83uvRLbpiA
1627786,2010-06-03,0,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"I recently revisited Cana and I'm glad I gave them a second chance.  I was very impressed with the waiter and the owner who were so welcoming and impressive with telling of what they enjoyed and the care that went into food preparation.

I had far more food that I normally do but was glad I tried out so many things.  I'll list it out since my eyes were very hungry that night.:

Hamachi - fresh and zesty
Duck Empanada - delicious unique butter crust and sweet to bite
Mac N Cheese - so bad for you but so good when it hits your lips
Calamari - crispy and peppery and using the dipping sauce really adds to the flavor
Pork Chops - Loved the marinade, tender, and full of flavor
Bread Pudding - This hit all my senses as soon as it hit the table and really lived up to expectations
Churros - Best churro I've ever had, arrived warm and hot and the glaze just really made the flavor jump in you mouth.

My friend had the white wine sangria and was very satisfied which is quite the compliment since she's very discerning.  I had a faux-jito, which was equally flavorful and fun.  Overall it was a great experience, nice ambiance, great service, and a welcome spot for friends, dates, and even business dinners.",LjDSVQGLLiOO7NCfvmV_MQ,1,1,5,Kfrir3t8vg3wC_E6B9MzPg
1997475,2010-04-19,5,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"Last night was my second time trying Cana, and quite frankly its not worth the money. My boyfriend and I got a pitcher of mojiots, empanadas, and a sorry excuse for a flatbread which was basically three slices of pita bread with a little smudge of melted cheese in the center... no sauce, no flavor. This cost us $75 after tip. We left still starving after a day of laying by the pool in the sun, and grumpy for wasting money. 
The only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito. He probably used half the bacardi bottle on us. 
But, needless to say, we met up with friends right after this, and immediately walked over to Brio for some hearty pasta, breads, and salads.

My father and I arrived for happy hour at 6 and were told it had just ended! Luckily the cordial manager Mike let us indulge in happy hour since their yelp ad lists happy hour from 4-7pm.

First off, their happy hour prices are so inexpensive!! I posted pictures of the menus- beer $3, Cocktails 4.50, and a glass of wine for $3.50? Absolutely awesome.

The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing, but the flavours weren't really intermingled well. One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland. I definitely wouldn't write it off though.

Our cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria. Sierra Mist is the contributing sweetness : /

There was also an interesting selection of South American Beers!

Their Hamachi Tiradito was a winner, and entirely cooked as opposed to raw. Raw might have been more delicious, but sashimi isn't exactly tapas.",n78PhLGZAiBiQIErPNMn2g,2,1,3,2DVB1f6VIqB6qT7AK9z-eg

My work colleague and i decided to try Cana because of the 1/2 off mojitos.  I probably could have drank like 10 of them.  I tried the strawberry, original, cucumber mojitos.  DELICIOUS!  I had two strawberry.
The small plates were also delectable.  Each had their own personality.  And we even ordered the churros for desert.

About the Restaurant:
Mojitos... Great.
Tapa style plates.... Great. I tried: 
The Ceviche: Lychee/lime/lavender
The flatbread pizza: Grilled Chicken/mango/cilantro/queso blanco
The Mac & Cheese: with Habaner jace (my favorite)
The Lamb Chops: with mint chimichurri (okay, also my favorite)
Tried two of the three desserts: Bread Pudding with banana/rum sauce and the Chocolate Kiss, with Chipolte Foam... was not a fan of the foam...

Service was outstanding, this was the second night they were open... so i hope they keep this up. Very friendly. 

Atmosphere was nice/modern/chic, I could use a brighter candle on the table... i had to use my iphone for light to read the menu... but they noticed right away, and said they would be working on it.",aA3lKyCEUvZ5-JYovl7W5g,0,0,4,rhWt49Hndz-Cf-rmgOaZJw
2983465,2011-01-21,0,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"I'm not sure if I'd give this place 4 stars or 3 stars. I really wish we could do 1/2 stars. 

Went here for DINNER last night with some friends. 

Ambiance: 
low lighting, dark woods, modern feel, one big open room with tables plus outdoor patio seating which looked like it would be a great way to go in the Fall and Spring... they had cool (I thought they were cool) paper-like, scrunched lanterns hanging from the ceiling 

Menu: 
2-page menu.... 1-page for drinks and 1-page for food 
What's cool is that they keep it simple but it's not a far reaching menu like some other tapas places I've been to... and if you're vegetarian this is NOT the place for you... I think there were 2 items on the menu that did not have meat or were meat based 

Downside: (and this is why I'd give them 3 stars) they were out of a number of items 
- out of all but 2 wines 
- out of 2 of the 8 beers 
- out of the short rib tacos and some other dish that I can't remember 

Taste: 
Excellent... everything we ordered was very tasty and well executed with a flair for presentation. 
Note: the portions are not super big.... so each plate is good for 2 people... we often ordered multiples. 

Enjoyed the Tuna Ceviche... Chicken Empanadas (now these were on the big side).... Chicken Tacos... Fish Tacos... Crispy Shrimp 

Dessert: 
WOW! If you like bread pudding... or even if you are just mildly interested.... try their Banana Bread Pudding.... YUM! It doesn't look like much when it comes out... but then you take a bite. Oh MY! :) 
We also ordered the Churros which were more like Cinnamon twists.. nevertheless... very good as well and I dipped the churros in the sauce the BBP came in... oh Yea! 

Service: 
Our waiter was cool.... super busy as it seemed like he was only 1 of 2 guys taking care of all the tables and it was a pretty busy night... almost all the tables were filled plus a big party of 10 
The hostess was ... I guess... I'd say indifferent... she wasn't mean but she wasn't friendly either so.... 

Drinks: 
I ordered the raspberry mojito... and to me ... it was way too sweet... I personally think it needed more rum and less sugarcane but that's me. Plus they muddled the heck out of it so that there weren't pieces of fruit swimming around as I had expected... I like the chunks of fruit in my muddled mojito... I know... I'm strange. 

The white sangria however was FABULOUS... it too was sweet but in a different way. I know... that doesn't make sense... so let's just say this drink would be perfect for sitting by the pool .... refreshing and delightful. 

All in all... we'll go back... it's different from the norm and I want to try their Red Sangria.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,1,4,MSWz3pDdI5ueWOSfo_cvsg

We ordered a plethora of dishes, and I have to say that this place is pretty good, but not great.  The only thing I really loved were their short rib tacos, but the meat was overpowered by some serious guava jelly.  if they just held back a bit on the jelly, that dish would bump my review up to a 4 star.  I did break a glass on my way out, but they were nice about it.  I can't say much about this place because the dishes were pretty but not memorable, with the exception of their short rib taco.

Everyone raves about the pork sliders, but we found them to be very dry...needed a little more mustard or BBQ sauce in my opinion (cough cough...another drink please!). Maybe that was their intent...

Drinks were great as she made sure we never ran dry.

We've lived in Vegas for a year and this was the worst food for the price we've had so far. We ordered the scallop ceviche, chicken flat bread, bacon wrapped dates, salad, and meatballs. The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked. I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces. Our meal ended up being $74 and we were beyond disappointed. Cana should change it's layout into a lounge instead of a restaurant because it's more about the ambiance and view.

The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!

This visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.  

Speaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.  

But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.

Things to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!

The service was good, and the ambiance is contemporary and inviting, however it's not the kind of place to indulge in, just feeling like snacking and paying $70 a person for basically an appetizer.

I'm telling you, every thing about this place is amazing.  Not only the food is delicious, the drinks are unique and yummy, the decor is modern and comfortable, and the staff is very helpful when it comes to explaining the menu and giving suggestions.

I was introduced to this place in November 2010 and have been there 6 times.  This says a lot, because my boyfriend and I eat out often and it's hard to find a place that makes me want to come back time after time.  

Cana's tapas are ALL delicious.  Beef empanadas, halibut, tuna ceviche, tacos, CHURROS!!  Oh my goodness, I need to go there for dinner!  LOL!

Anyways, their drinks are also amazing.  Fresh sugarcane...lime...DELICIOUS and consistently good every time!!

3514839,2010-02-14,0,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"I'm a sucker for tapas (or bocadillos in this case -- although I used to think bocadillos were sandwiches, which shows you how much I know, but I digress...). So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.

First of all, there are 2 entries for Ca√±a on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.

Now for the review... Ca√±a is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the ""behind the bar"" area before getting to the dining area. With Ca√±a, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.

As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even ""really good"" either.

- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.

- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.

- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.

- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.

- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.

- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.

We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Ca√±a might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2,1,3,f3eDO1zvEFN_Gep0nFnsqA
3541474,2011-01-18,0,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"6 of us came out here tonight, a Monday night for happy hour, and we were happy.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.

These are the tapas we ordered:
-Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.

-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum

-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.

-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.

-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.

-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.

-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.

-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.

-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.

-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.

-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.

Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.  

Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.  

Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...

So, happy hour is definitely the time to go to try out many different tapas and drink the sugarcane sangria.  I will come back!",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,1,2,4,x_ilr7pNgD-1LC97-C2ZRg

SO when I sat down at Cana I thougt I would end up dissapointed again..it was the complete opposite of a let down. I loooved this place and it was not as annoyingly busy and loud as Firefly. 

We got spicy tune ceviche..amazing especially with the chip thingys they bring out with it, beef emenadas..the crust is super flaky and yummy, mac n cheese..SO good and surprisingly spicy, and the meatballs.

We asked for the dates sans bacon and they were delicious--crisp and perfectly baked. Much better than Firefly where the dates are served soaking in a bowl of bacon grease (although I have to admit that Firefly introduced me to this dish so I shoudln't complain).

The best part about my experience was the service. John is an amazing bar tender. All of the bartenders are very friendly and focused on the customer. They were genuinely interested in whether or not we liked our food and drinks. John introduced us to Cory, the owner, who is also a friendly, genuine person.  I don't think you'll find better service anywhere in Vegas, really. I have been going to Firefly for years and have never left feeling like the employees knew me or cared about my return. It's the opposite at Cana.

But there were many other highlights too, seemingly all of them unique takes on well-known dishes:  crispy shrimp, short ribs, bacon-wrapped dates, Cuban sliders, halibut ceviche, picante mac and cheese -- I think you can throw a dart at the menu and end up with a delicious dish (and the staff is so accommodating they just might let you!).  Drinks were also sublime -- my sangria was fresh and light, but all the cocktails got raves around our table too.

But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your ""foodie"" DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said ""I wish I could try 5 plates"".  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.

If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?) 

- Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish ""cooked"" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) 

Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop. 

Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. 

Piggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have. 

- Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. ""Not as sweet"" as most. 

Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult. 

I want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square. 

Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason. 

I think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, ""I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had"" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it.

Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):

Beef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.
Mac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.
Cuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.
Crispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.
Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.
Sangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.

During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.  Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far, but the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,2,2,3,sfYmS5UAtqh61qQup5QqXw

I went with a friend and sat at the bar to eat. We had to get the bartender's attention after being seated for about 5 mins, he was busy chatting with a friend at the other end of the bar. We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates. We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare. And we thusly found out there was no comparison. Cana's offerings were ok, but nothing outstanding.

Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.

Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.

Despite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.

So if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,4,4,3,35g0Lz41L7jv5eAyUz3d6g

My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks; they love it so much that they are driven in a sugar frenzy to giving 4 or more stars. I can respect this. I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.

The atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the ""crispy"" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.  

I am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff.

5231662,2010-02-23,2,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"My new favorite bar /hangout spot in the city of Las Vegas ! I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:

*Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.

*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly

*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. 

--------------------------

I've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.

We've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.

On the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. 

If you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better! You might just like it .",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,5,4,5,_SOxX5KhLB87ljcVUcsNHw

We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say ""sorry you just missed Happy Hour"". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good. For sure it won't be until summer. I hate eating in a winter coat. Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?",FAsoP7gzkDmFdP-eYuysmw,1,1,3,mvAh3a3KJpKADj9eWVejUA

I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas.  I found them to be tasty and well cooked.  Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable.  I had also tried their ""Fire Water"" drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well.  A bit of a small glass, but the flavor was good.

I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal, but my friend and I enjoyed our individual meal selections, and the overall vibe and view were pleasant.

Perhaps in returning at a later time, I'd be able to make a more concrete decision on where I want to place my enjoyment factor, but the first impression was pleasant enough to want to check it out again.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,1,1,4,DaD9JQvurWdjMKTq5h4eMw

Both my wife and I wanted a small dinner and this was a perfect place to do it.  Went with the hirame ceviche which was was done w/ lavender, lychee and lime.  Interesting mix for a ceviche and tasty but I just prefer the regular stuff.  We also ordered the beef empanadas and the cuban sliders which were both very good.  

While the menu was fine, my wife kinda wished there was a larger selection of stuff but it wasn't that big a deal.  

Atmosphere is awesome.  Great place for drinks and this place is gonna rock when the weather gets warmer.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,3,2,4,YB59O-pcCNSUU7s89FuOHQ

All drinks made fresh, try the mojitos  :)  To top it off have a chocolate kiss or a churro, they are outstanding :)  Located in Town Square.",PPYZQDoyQ4Wfg6oL80MVFQ,0,0,5,j3Y5_sws6nNgTBGvQ9567w
5688657,2010-03-07,3,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"A nice location sandwiched between Bar Louie and Blue Martini at Town Square. I have to say that this should be ""the"" spot of the summer (for drinks). It has a central location, Miami-ish d√©cor, balcony that overlooks the Town Square park, and two additional balconies on both sides that are all perfect for people watching. Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot. 
However, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand. 

What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.

The sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly. As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better but how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway). Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat. With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,3,3,3,Ck6O0cRtKLR6wTG32MwtHA
5802951,2010-07-15,0,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"The mojitos here are delicious... I love the original and the cucumber version.  The food is decent.  I've tried the mac-n-cheese (a bit spicy, but yummy), the flatbread (kinda bland, nothing special), the bacon wrapped dates (yummy, but you can only eat a couple before they are just too sweet), and the papas (very tasty).  My only complaint is that the place has been pretty dead every time I've been there... sure I don't like super crowded places, but I would literally be the only one talking in this place at times when the other 5 groups of people that were there would collectively have a lull in their conversations.  I don't know if people just haven't heard of this place or what.  The mojitos will keep me coming back, and hopefully a following will build for this place so it's a little more lively in the future.",sD_uLJBHHozK-poMkY2l7w,1,0,4,vU_IpMaxsqVFTZMnpJYE-Q
5868522,2010-02-01,0,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,"We stopped in on a Saturday night after seeing the sign.  We were going to grab some sushi but hadn't noticed Ca√±a before and wanted to try it seeing as we're fans of tapas.

Lots of small plates meant to be shared.  We ordered a salad, meatballs, hamachi ceviche, crab ceviche, churros, Cuban sliders, ahi tuna flatbread, and several drinks.

Drinks were great.  Food was excellent.  However, the ceviche isn't really ceviche if that's what you're looking for.  The hamachi was sliced sashimi style with an delicious dressing.  Crab was more like a crab salad and had a metallic taste as if it were canned.  The crab ceviche was the only dish that wasn't excellent.

Service is good.  Definitely a good place for groups.  It's rather noisy so be warned.  Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can try the outside patios.",bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,2,0,4,KwYQNiCIn0s4IDySMadjcg
