The garlic parmesan were a grease sponge and the bbq ones weren't very flavorful. We also had to order a medium side of blue cheese for $1.79. At other places, this is typically included with the wings and not charged separately.

The fries were pretty mushy, greasy, and tasteless.  

And to finish it off, both of us got food poisoning!!   I noticed that when they were serving them, a couple of wings fell on the kitchen counter and they just put it right in my box.

Walked in to two people sitting there waiting for there order, or should I say pacing! Warning one!!

You order by the pound, not by the quantity. How many chicken wings in a pound? We'll come to find out, couldn't get a precise answer...somewhere between 6-10 I was told. 
Warning two!!

Girlfriend comes back with sandwich 10 minutes later..long line she says, sorry it took awhile! People in front of me still pacing. 
Warning three!!

10 min later peeps in front finally get their order, still waiting for mine. Meantime notice  wings go in, no scale, wings come out, no scale? Didn't I buy by the pound??? Warning four!!!

Finally get my order! For the record..I got 7...for $7..hmm you do the math!! I ask for blue cheese, not ranch please. Oh no I'm told, you only get wings..sauce is extra..Really??

She talked to me and gave me suggestions as I spent around 5 minutes looking at the menu deciding what I wanted. I settled on 1/2 sweet and spicy, 1/2 lemon pepper, side of fries, and a side of veggies. As everything was made I order, it took around 15 minutes for everything to be cooked and prepared. Thankfully I was the only one in the place. As she bagged my items, she insisted I try a French fry.... They were hot, crispy, and seasoned extremely tasty, I really enjoyed them. Enjoyed them so much I ate most of them on my way home. Once I got home I dug into the wings. 1st was the sweet and spicy, the wings were very plump which I'm not a fan of, I like them real crispy. The flavor had a weird aftertaste that I couldn't figure out till I tasted the lemon pepper. It was butter. The sauce was made with butter, lots of butter. Not for me. The lemon pepper should have been called lemon salty pepper cause it was so salty you tasted really no lemon flavor. I ordered I think 18 wings and ate about 5 wings then tossed them. I usually NEVER get flavored wings but traditional buffalo and maybe that's where I went wrong. I will definitely give this place another try especially cause of how friendly the owner lady was but I will be sticking to buffalo sauce only and requesting extra crispy.

My son ordered BBQ and I ordered Cajun and Hot Garlic.  I wasn't really into any of the sauces to be honest.  I didn't think either of them were very hot at all.  The biggest issue was with the chicken strips.  What we received looked absolutely nothing like the combination picture they have right on the wall/menu.  The strips pictured are what you would typically expect, some sort of long strips;  however we received something that more closely resembles chicken nuggets and they were so caked on with breading that there was hardly any actual chicken.  Not sure what sort of crusty concoction the use for the crust of these strips, but it was way too thick so I felt like I was eating about 75% breading and hardly any chicken.  Even my 9 year old commented on this a few times, and chicken is just about all he likes to eat.  We and my son were the only guests the entire time we were eating and I can tell why.  I honestly don't see myself coming back.  I would recommend Johnny Macs, Wingstop, BWW, or Chicken Shack over this place.  I also didn't get any dipping sauce for the fries which is crazy, it looked like I would have to pay .49 for ranch which I understand if I am buying extra ranch, but for one that is lame.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,0,0,2,mHFG_i472coV3KP7GnwhKA

When we stopped in to get takeout, there was exactly one staffer working. She was very pleasant and friendly.

The restaurant itself has a rundown, dive feel to it, and it's rather tiny. This is really a spot meant for takeout, not dining in.

We ordered 2 pounds of wings (which come with 1-2 flavor choices) and seasoned fries, with ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces. There are several flavors of varying heat levels to choose from - everything from super hot to Hawaiian to lemon pepper. We went with cajun and buffalo hot (they're 2nd and 3rd spiciest according to the menu).

The wings were alright. Good size. Ok quality. Neither flavor was spicy at all - both were very mild. I perhaps would've liked the wings better if I'd ordered them wet. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces were decent - better than what you get at most places.

The fries were...fries. Cooked well, seasoned well. Tasty enough.

The wings were large, fresh and cooked just right, unlike the overcooked chicken wings from malnourished chickens at Buffalo Wild Wings. It's a good idea to call-in your take out orders because it takes at least 15 minutes to fry up a batch of wings, but it's definitely worth the wait. The buffalo wings are not as spicy as I have come to expect, so if you like them spicy, give the Hell Fire wings a try. You can order as many pieces as you like, but you will be charged by the pound. In general, you get six wings per pound at a cost of $6.99 per pound. For each pound of chicken wings, you can choose up to two different flavors.

The original tasted like a cross between Louisiana hot sauce and Tabasco. Very runny. I prefer the thicker wing sauces myself. My husband had the BBQ and lemon pepper and he was happy.

Tonight was just the icing on the cake for me and I will no longer be coming here. During our first experience a few months back we waited almost 45 minutes for some chicken tenders and fries. At the end of the day however the food was alright. The fries have a great seasoning and the tenders tasted almost buttered and were so good. Although we had to wait the food was good enough to want to come back. I came again a few months after and this time the wait wasn't as long and the food was once again really good. So that leads me to tonight. I was craving chicken tenders so my husband and I packed up the kids and headed over. We ordered the usual, two #2's. This usually comes with 7 tenders per basket as well as fries. Altogether we should have received 14 tenders and a good amount of fries. This would have been more than enough food for the kids and myself being that my husband wanted food next door. We waited about 15 minutes for our food. When we received our food we were presented with two baskets. In each basket there were 6 pieces of chicken, not tenders, I mean small little nuggets that you can tell were clearly tenders cut in half. You can see the cuts in the tenders. We paid $25+ for two basket combos and an additional drink. In reality we only got a total of six tenders cut in half split into two baskets. We brought it to the workers attention and she said that ""that's how they come"". We even showed her the picture on her wall and she reiterated that that is how they came. She then gave us one additional tender caught in half. What a joke. Never again.",-A_H0msLm8VuLH4TU7euYA,0,0,1,yhmxBs7IYt9hc9FS-UqJGw

Suki tells me every time I order the ""Hellfire"" that it is way too hot, but I think they are perfect.  Yet again, I am a spicy guy.  Each time I go in, Suki jokingly threatens to retire.

After waiting 15 min for a #1 combo (4 wings, 2 chicken strips, fries, 1 dip, and a drink for $8.99), I was dismayed to find that my wings were barely warm, while the fries were mouth-scorchingly hot with a weird thick mushy consistency inside, and the chicken fingers were somewhere in between on temperature. Not to mention, the chicken barely looked or tasted like it had ever met any sauce. While the wings were a decent size, they were ultra bland. Fingers were Sam's Club frozen out the bag style, so no redemption there.

Tried this place today, and got here at about 5:00 pm. I was the only one here.

1.  Service - Not bad when you are the only one here. However, the servers must be busy, because there is a ton of grease on their shirts. I may suggest to wear aprons however.

2.  Selection - Very nice - good choice of sauces, flavors, spice levels, fries, chicken fingers, boneless and basic wings.

3.  Size of wings - Well, we all know that Grade A USDA Wings are plump and very meaty ""well to moderately fleshed"".  We also know that Grade B wings have a sufficient amount of flesh to prevent a thin appearance.  Guess what, we got a B here. You want your humans beings Grade B, and your wings Grade A.  COME ON FOLKS.....

4.  Price - The price for 50 wings is 29.99 which is not bad, if it were grade A wings. you  would expect 50 wings to be somewhat heavy, I felt as if I was holding a bunch of ballons. Served in a generic container in a generic bag, not sure how this helps with their branding.

6.  Taste - edible!  The polynesian style had an odd dark color, yet the flavor was acceptable.  The Garlic Parmesan, well, there was garlic taste and parmesan taste, just unfortunately a smattering and not well covered.

7.  Tables - Plenty of room in this place, you can sit and eat as well. Odd that people just walk in and out of the back room without any uniform or acknowledgement. You don't know who works here or not.  I don't plan to eat in anytime soon, a bit dodgy if you ask me.

Overall, I would say that for a  hungry person, these wings are definitely acceptable and you can compare it to ordering a hamburger at McDonalds. Compared to In and Out of Five guys, there is no comparison, however, it is certainly edible.

She made me feel very welcomed. She made recommendations on the food and I bought the Lemon Pepper and they were cooked to perfection!

5254158,2015-07-18,0,OaM2Bjeo2Ftt84ruTrzPNQ,This place was made out to be the best wing place you have ever been to by the lady working. She was sadly mistaking about the quality of her wings. They were awful. At the time of eating at this place I was pretty hungry and things normally taste better when you are hungry not this meal. My wings were dripping in oil at the bottom of my container. The homemade ketchup was terrible and the fries were terrible to. My Parmesan wings just had sprinkled Parmesan on top.

Made to order, right there and it's not as salty as WingStop or Wingerz or even Buffalo Wild Wings. The place definitely has a local vibe to it.

5456788,2014-02-06,0,OaM2Bjeo2Ftt84ruTrzPNQ,"I went in around 3:30 today and there was only one person besides myself eating in. 

The specials are written on a white board and seem somewhat decently priced, the look however seems very sloppy and the specials were a little hard to read. 

I ordered the 8 boneless wing special with a drink and fries for $8.43 with a Cajun hot flavor. 

I was a little perturbed that the woman asked me multiple times what drink I wanted and still didn't give it to me until my wings were finished (guess they try to avoid having to give you a refill before your food is done). 

I took my order to go, the fries were absolutely terrible, they were soggy and wet, and a weird dark brown color. Also I found their blue cheese to be very watery and bland. 

The best part of the order was the wings, I'm not used to a dry rub but these were pretty good and seasoned very well. These don't seemed fried like normal wings, and the spice I picked wasnt as spicy as I expected since it got a 4/5 rating on the spice chart. 

All in all I appreciate small businesses and admire the people who take the chance to start them. I think with some small changes this place can be really good. If you're in the mood for wings, that's all I would order from this place.",nnSNAPC7gT_Oqg_6IkZJag,0,0,2,16IrNqkVcw4Vz6zujWhUiQ

I decided to order 2lbs of wings, fries, celery and carrots. It didn't take that long for my order, about a 15 minute wait. Had a pleasant conversation with the staffer. She was very friendly and helpful...  

The wings and fries  were delicious! Will definitely go back! There's lots of flavors to choose from and planning on trying all of them...",b2T3yx_n_axnRD160xUjjA,2,2,5,hzwfAAQS1_MYOWB0oJWfuw

5698109,2017-08-30,1,OaM2Bjeo2Ftt84ruTrzPNQ,"First of all let me state that I LOVE chicken wings!! I have been wanting to try try this place since I saw their sign when I moved to the area. I kept putting it off usually just going to Buffalo Wild Wings just up the street since I love their asian zing flavor. Well tonight I figured I'd call in an order for pick up  since I was gonna be driving by on my way home. I called ahead of time and placed a pick up order for 1lb of spicy teriyaki wings with a side of ranch. When I got to the restaurant it was empty with just one employee working, no big deal, the gentleman working was a nice/funny guy. Driving home I felt like I smelled a little bit of a sour smell coming from the take out box so I was a little worried, so I got home and tried them thankfully there is no sourness thankfully. One pound ended up being 7 wings with the price tag of $8.10 after tax so not bad. Anyway, after digging in I gotta say I'm a little disappointed, maybe it was just my choice of sauce/flavoring but they just tasted bland, and the spicy teriyaki had no spice at all and didn't get much of a teriyaki flavor either. They're really nice meaty crunchy wings which is pretty much on point, but the flavor is disappointing there's just not that much flavor. Maybe I'll give this place another chance with a different flavor cause I really do want to like this place so I don't have to only rely on Bdubs little baby wings. I wish we had a Wing Stop in our area but we don't. Final thought, I would try this place out with a small order before ordering your Super Bowl platter from here, again the wings themselves were nice and meaty and crunchy it was just flavor that disappointed.",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,1,0,3,OG5eCtM_m8LH-dg4fz2Oyg
