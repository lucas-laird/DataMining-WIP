16267,2013-06-30,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"My husband and I decided to end our trip to Vegas with a fancy dinner out. The concierge at Encore, where we were staying, was very helpful making the reservation. Since it was over 100 degrees outside, we opted to dine inside. Luckily, we got a great table in front of the window overlooking the patio and the Lake of Dreams. This is definitely a nice restaurant (business casual, no shorts) but it wasn't overly pretentious or stuffy. The slightly funky décor and unusual music choices (Gwen Stefani, Michael Jackson) made it feel a bit more comfortable. Yet this is the type of place where they place the napkin on your lap and show you the bottle before pouring a glass of wine.

Our server was friendly and attentive without being pushy or intrusive. We started with the calamari, and it was the best I think I've ever had, not at all chewy or rubbery, with an even, crunchy fried coating. It was a large portion, too. My husband and I each had a plate of scallops for dinner and these were cooked to perfection, too. Melt-in-your-mouth on the inside with the perfect sear on the outside. We also split a side of king crab mac 'n' cheese, which we should have passed on. It didn't taste like anything special, just an odd-tasting mac and cheese. It also had peas sprinkled through it, which seemed strange.

I had expected this to be the kind of restaurant where you leave still hungry, but we were surprisingly stuffed. I had mentioned to the concierge that we were on our honeymoon, and the waiter brought us two complimentary mini-cupcakes with ""Congratulations"" written across the plate in chocolate syrup.
We had a great view of the little lights and music show out on the lake. Our final bill wasn't as high as I was anticipating: about $135 before gratuity for a shared appetizer and side, two entrees (granted, some of the more affordable entrees on the menu), and one glass of wine. Not cheap by any means, but not bad by Vegas (and Wynn) standards.

It did get pretty busy by the time we were leaving, around 8:30 pm on a Wednesday, so make a reservation or dine earlier, like 7:30 pm or so on a weekday.

75618,2011-09-02,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"Reservation-seater problem. The hotel owner kept telling about Lakeside on TV, and what a great chef is there. So we reserved a table there the day before from our room in Wynn and asked for outside one. On the phone they told us about great food there and dressing rules, so we dressed up. When we came in, they asked us to wait. We ordered a couple of drinks. In 20 minutes the seater calls us to follow her and leads to the inside table at the entrance. We were really confused. Why we waited 20 minutes, if the restaurant inside was less than half full. We told her that we ordered an outside one. She asked, did we say to the hostess here, that we want on ""the patio"". No, when we were reserving from the room we asked ""outside"".  She didn't check and just said, that they don't have this information and if we want the patio, we can wait, but she will put us down on the list, so it will take an hour or more. This sounded like ultimatum, and we got a feeling we had no choice, so we sat down at the table. But the sitting was not comfortable - entrance and under the air conditioner. We didn't want to spend $200 like this. My husband approached the main hostess and explained her the situation, she was very courteous and professional and we moved outside. 

Ambiance and service. The lake is beautiful and shows are interesting. Waiters are friendly and courteous.

Food. Everything was delicious, but the highlight is spice crusted big eye tuna. That chef and cooks did a great job.

Overall, I guess it would be a much better experience if not a reservation-seater problem.",zT3JgXSz2tNmK2B-W5ESgw,0,0,3,0jlGGWrxo6E_IUz30bhWiw

To start we split a caesar salad, which was really good and dressed perfectly.  For my entree I had a side of roasted veges (delicious) and crabcakes, those were also great. 

My fiancé's entree was a real disappointment.  He ordered the filet, which had a char on it that was more of a charcoal flavored burn. It was also not cooked as he ordered it (a pet peeve of mine, if you don't know the difference between rare and medium rare you don't belong in a professional kitchen).  It also came with a ""chimmichurri"" sauce, which was not even close to being chimmichurri, it was more like salsa. 

The worst part of dinner was dessert. We ordered the chocolate doughnuts, expecting a fluffy doughnut with a chocolate glaze on top. What we got was 4 pieces of raw dough that had been microwaved for 10 seconds and dipped in Hershey's syrup. They were gross. 

The ambiance really saves Lakeside, watching the waterfall at night is stunning, and the drinks and service are great, but especially given the prices (everything listed above and 4 drinks was $180 before gratuity) I expect the food to be much better.",ltZwh9ETs-WRuFWvomNgKQ,0,0,3,cjqBvCbBukiBN7Ci6CuMkg

Our waiter made me anxious with his hyperactive presentation style. The menus are covered in this weird orange rubbery material that reminded me of Howard Johnson's. We ordered apps and mains and a glass of wine each. It's not like we were being cheap, but he kept up selling and it was annoying.

The pretzel roll was the best thing I had. I ordered Ceaser salad because I needed a little crunch. It was pretty soggy. Over dressed. The scallops themselves were delicious, but whatever the purée was was tasteless (and it looked like someones thumb had gotten stuck in it on the way out) and the sauce looked like it had just been thrown on the plate.  Disappointing. The husbands crab/avocado was tasty, if not a major throwback, but his fish was just heavy w butter and under seasoned. 

On top of everything, I felt like we were really being pushed through. I just never felt like I could relax and enjoy my not inexpensive meal. The only time I felt like we were wanted was when we didn't buy into the upsell for coffee and dessert.

Additionally the lobster meat was sparse, like the lobster had been sitting a while and eating its own flesh due to starvation. 

Also, ordered a cocktail ""neat"" and they charged for 1.5 shots (something about how neat comes with more and therefore (Casino rules) they must charge more). Didn't ask for a double, asked for a single but got charged for a double. Again, manager had nothing of value to say about this.

Ended up salting and peppering to try and get something out of it. Risotto was also flat, could have been eating spackle.

465592,2012-07-05,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"We decided to start our night with dinner here as my fellow diners had already tried several of the other restaurants at the Wynn. 

The atmosphere was wonderful - peaceful, calm and serene yet refined and elegant. We sat on the terrace overlooking the ""mini-lake"" and waterfall were entertained every half hour or so with a 3-minute show emerging from behind the waterfall. The first one was a frog singing Louis Armstrong - yes, you heard that right - even at the height of classiness, this is still Vegas. The second feautured two glowing orbs that danced around the lake before giving birth to a baby orb - again, yes, you heard that right - although mostly an adult-centric atmosphere, I could just hear any children who may happen to see this choosing that moment to ask, ""Mommy, where do babies come from?""

But I digress. The first thing that impressed me about the food itself was the fact that they were able to bring gluten free and vegan bread, as well as vegan butter, to the table upon our request. I've been to places where you could order a sandwich on gluten free bread, etc., but never had that option as part of a bread basket that has been brought to the table prior to the meal. It wasn't bad, as GF breads go, either. 

My main course of scallops was absolutely delicious. The scallops were fresh and perfectly sauteed and the celery root purée, apple chutney and vandouvan sauce that came with were all excellent. My fellow diners seemed to really enjoy their meals, as well.

Overall this place is on the pricey side but the atmosphere is amazing and the service was perfect. My water and wine glasses were never left empty and all of our requests were attended to promptly and professionally.

The arugula salad was simple and delicious. The tuna poke was good, but not great. I could do better in my own kitchen.
The bone-in New York was excellent and could feed two. The halibut was good as well.  These were probably the only highlights of the evening.

What a shame that a fine eating spot died and the exquisite space filled with overpriced mediocrity. After taking in the great show - Sinatra - we decided on a late night bite and thought about trying the new Lakeside Grill. Without a reservation, we waited around 10 minutes to be seated in what looked to be a half empty restaurant. The nice woman at the reception desk lead us to our table and got us seated. That was about the best treatment we had, considering the hyped up status of the place. A polite young man took our drink order and promptly came back with a bottle of Pellagrino. Our waiter showed up soon thereafter and handed us the menu. I am totally used to paying decent money for good food and service to match, but I was sort of surprised to see the prices on this menu. I think $50 for a 9oz Fillet Mignon is a little high. Everything is ala carte. We were not starving and decided that we were just going to order a quick lite bite - Strip Steak Sliders, fries, and braised greens. The steak sliders were $7 a piece, 10 bucks for the fries, and 10 bucks for the greens. The sliders consisted of a mini slice of steak stuck in the groove of a sliced mini-baguette. The fries were great - but $10? Greens were so-so. Bottom line - $60 for some mediocre snacks is a joke. I am glad we did not go for a full blown meal. Oh - one more little thing - after the waiter took our order - we never saw him again. Not once. Later in the meal, another woman came by to clear the plates and ask if we wanted any desert. She also brought the check. For that kind of money, someone should have asked if we were satisfied with our meal. nuf said -I warned u. Many better choices.

The only reason I am not giving a ""terrible"" is because the Manager Alex was accommodating, and the food was good.

What drove down the rating was the SERVICE - lack of..  

The Host staff were great, welcomed us and sent us to the bar to wait on our table.  Then when the table was ready came up to us and address us by name to leads us to our table.  That nice touch instead of calling out a name to a room of people.

The table service started out good.  They rolled our the lobster cart and we ordered immediately.  Great energy and sense of humor.  

Then we get turned over to our waiter and table staff.  All down hill from here.  Once the food arrived, there was no check back to see if everything was good.  To get drink refills we had to rudely call out at wait staff as they dashed by - at times more than once just for drink refills.  

Price point - Vegas reasonable.  With menus online, if you are surprised by a bill you just didn't plan ahead.  But the service concerns WILL prevent me from bringing guests back here in future trips.  Botero is safer option at Wynn.",YAVDnIaq0yKwCd6rfhMYUg,0,0,3,xYaL5pkftkyNGVqV-UlhWQ

So, Lakeside worked out great. We made reservations and were greeted at the hostess station. When it was our turn to sit, they said the reservation name, and we obliged. Apparently, the name they said was in fact not ours, and we misheard. We realized once they walked us to our table, which was in a private dining room with a pre-fixed menu (clearly not for us!). When I shared with the hostess that I think there has been a mistake, she berated me like a child stating that she ""said the name three times!"". So disrespectful! Your mistake is not my issue. I dismissed her and decided to approach a manager to address the situation rather than deal with her. I was assured he'd be right over to speak with me, which never happened. She must have let the entire waitstaff know her experience with us, because the whole time we were treated so inappropriately. 

Here we are, six hard-working girls from all over the country coming together to celebrate each other, and we were treated as if we were 18 years old on spring break. I'd also like to make mention that none of us had been drinking, we were dressed our age, and all of us have an appreciation for a nice meal and are willing to pay the price. In fact, our only intention for our final night was to enjoy a relaxed, beautiful dinner together. We were so disappointed. 

The food was subpar. My swordfish was okay, the scallops were good. Small portions, large prices. The waiter was not interested in sharing specials or suggestions with us.

Now that is a name that conjours up images of a restaurant perched at the edge of an artificial lake in 'any-burb' USA. Yikes! We almost didn't walk down the 'grand staircase'. But we did. So much for second guessing the quality of the food by the name of the restaurant. The food was great! We had: uber fresh, briny, sweet oysters on the half shell--YUM!, a generous serving of thin sliced Iberico ham (but not paper thin) served with arugula, small wedges of manchego cheese, green olives in olive oil and grilled ciabatta points, super soft grilled octopus served nestled on a tasty white bean salad with sherry vinegar and roasted garlic aioli, braised wagyu short ribs with gnocchi, parmesan cheese, roasted tomatoes, english peas, and flavorful wood fire grilled lemon garlic king prawns. The food was fresh and the flavors bold and forthright. No complaints about the food at all. The food was deeeelish! The 'show' in the 'magic pond' (aka the pond of dreams) was entertaining and great photo op amusing. Our waitperson, Douglas, was personable, polite and very accomodating when we asked to be moved indoors (the outdoor tables were too cold for us). So, the flaws with this reastaurant?...The outdoor patio is the place to be, however, the outdoor 'heaters' don't throw off enough heat to keep the outdoor patio diners warm and cozy. We had to ask to be moved indoors. Unfortunately the indoor tables lack the 'ambiance' of the outdoor tables. The lighting in the indoor dining area is bright and when combined with the modern dining room tables and the overall modern decor, feels jarringly harsh. The combination of the bright light and modern furniture gives the dining area a 'cafeteria' feel. So, to summarize, great food, junk name for the restaurant -- come on--you guys at Wynn can come up with a name more creative than ""Lakeside""? and junk ambiance in the indoor dining area (too bright and not cozy).",PFif9xJ2Cy_xpvrNqA36sg,0,0,4,4RNguiWhh5E9qJz0R11dIA

I have not actually eaten a meal here, however, my wife and I were at Parasol Up and saw a sign for a special oyster happy hour at Lakeside below. We decided to check it out and it turned out to be the find of this stay at the Wynn. The special is $1.50 oysters in the bar. They were amazing. We loved them so much that our first night we ordered two orders of a dozen (two of each of the six varieties they had that evening). When they arrived, the waitress explained which were which (I always find this helpful) and left us to just be wowed. The oysters also arrive with a nice garnish tray if you like saucing yours up. An Asian sauce, vinegar and onion, and a cocktail sauce. Lots of lemon and horse radish accompanied. 

We enjoyed our oysters on the nights we visited with very nice dirty martini's. They came with traditional pimento olives or blue cheese stuffed (these were always being made and never available when we asked for them)

Swing by Lakeside. If this special is offered, take them up on it. It will be well worth your visit.

1267170,2014-10-03,1,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"This is one of my favorite of the many excellent restaurants that Wynn Las Vegas offers.  

First of all the place is absolutely stunning.  Located across from Wynn's premier SW Steakhouse, Lakeside sits right on the Lake of Dreams.  Patio dining at this restaurant, on a beautiful evening, is almost 2nd to none.  The service is professional and can be friendly but I've also noticed a little snooty at times. 

I have enjoyed both the Chopped Salad and the Caesar but, the Manhattan Seafood Chowder is my favorite starter. The Shellfish Platter, Maryland Crab Cakes (sometimes I get this as my entrée) and Steamed Littleneck Clams are all excellent.  The steaks that they offer, which are all scrumptious, are the same steaks that you would find at SW across the hall.  Lakeside's specialty is their seafood.  They feature several lobster options and also a variety of Hawaiian fish.  My favorite is the Opakapaka (Pink Snapper).  Additionally, the Lobster Risotto is absolutely excellent.  If you're in the mood for a steak and don't mind a little kick, I would recommend the Chili Rubbed Ribeye & Prime King Crab.   A little warning, the serving of crab is definitely on the light end. Want to pass on the spice? You cannot go wrong with the filet.  It literally melts in your mouth like butter.  

Dessert Tapas!!!  Need I say more??? Probably not but I'm still going to. I love the dessert here. They are priced and sized to enjoy a few at a time. My favorite is the Key Lime Pie and the Strawberry Shortcake. 

I noticed a lot of reviews mention that this restaurant is pricey. I firmly believe that you're getting exactly what you pay for here. Highly recommend!!!",jOX6aVwI9sA-sQFWBZSsFw,4,1,4,vUJXb_LDQR-r_WTGwepnfg

The food is pricey but very good. There is a vast wine selection. This is an outstanding and very unique restaurant and location to host clients.

The presentation was great, but fish itself  was strange, I'm not sure if the sole was wrapped around another fish but the flavor was definitely not quite right.

1333703,2013-04-24,1,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"I'm all sorts of conflicted about Lakeside Restaurant. First of all, I should mention that Lakeside is located at the glitzy and glamorous Wynn hotel at the Las Vegas strip. That alone deserves some kudos. Ears perked yet? 

I think I like the idea of Lakeside: I like the decor, or at least parts of it. I like the prompt and attentive service. I like the simultaneously calming yet high-end ambiance. I like the over-the-top and abstract lakeside show. I like the concept of fresh, lakeside food. But in terms of execution, I can't say that's its all there. Almost, but not quite. 

Decor: You will see orange and lots of it. Think ING Direct; it's probably the orange lion and orange ball's safe haven after their direct acquisition merge with Capital One. But it kind of grows on you in a strange, Great Gatsby kind of way. Or am I just reminiscing about ING Direct? Probably a little but of both... I miss you, orange ball! Anywho, the decor is at once mismatched and modern and homey. Think eyebrow-raising mermaid mural with inviting floor lamps and cozy couches, and a heavy dosage of Ancient Greek buffs in the nude. It feels like a page out of West Elm or Z Gallerie, but in a restaurant instead of a home. It's weird, but it kind of works. 

Service: The waiter service here is so good and fast and attentive you might be slightly put off. How is that for a contradiction? Every time you leave for even a few minutes at a time, your napkin will be refolded and your plate might be re-angled to be just right. Are you properly creeped out, or strangely attracted? Whatever floats yoyr boat. And to my overly-attentive waiter, I apologize for the fact that I inhale water like a cow and absorb it like a sponge. Nevertheless, it's five-star service. 

Ambiance: Quiet place for a business dinner or power lunch? A good choice. What about a romantic dinner for two outside? Excellent as well. I think the ambiance can potentially be both romantic and professional, and Lakeside has this balance down pat. This is probably one of those felt-but-not-seen areas of attraction about the restaurant. You may not realize it at first, but once you do, you appreciate it and fall in love with it. 

Show: So weird, yet not so strange in the context of Vegas. It's a recurring show every 30 minutes, with a handful of different ""shows."" The one I watched included 2 independently existing balls floating on water, interacting with corresponding music, water, and lights. Then, two seconds before the show ended, out popped a baby ball. Guess that is the beauty of conception, in the form of an abstract and therefore ""appropriate"" show. Appropriate for Vegas, I suppose, and strange, to say the least. 

Food: Their seafood is incredibly fresh, and options are wide and varied. I was caught off guard when a waiter came by with a tray of lobsters from different places. It was like a scene from an Asian seafood market, misplaced at a super luxe American restaurant. We didn't order too many entrées, for money's sake, but we ordered quite a bit of appetizers and sides. We ordered the salmon entree, lobster macaroni and cheese, king crab and guacamole, lobster risotto, marinated king prawns, lobster poutines, truffles, complimentary fresh bread, and dense chocolate sponge cake with strawberries. My favorite as the lobster macaroni and cheese; immediately, the cheesiness attracted me to it, and the subtle and fresh taste of lobster reeled me in. I also enjoyed the slightly-grainy and unique-tasting vanilla and raspberry sorbets that came with our cake for dessert. The cake was solid as well, as it was both light and dense, and not too sweet. Some dishes, such as the truffle mushrooms, skewed to the salty side. Other than that, I must say their food is good but not jaw-dropping or life-changing in the way I expected it to be. I think the thing about it is that I felt the high quality elements and extremely fresh seafood were slightly cheapened but everyday, commonplace ingredients, such as salsa, guacamole, or kimchi. If I'm eating quality seafood, I need to feel and know and be able to acknowledge that it's in a mind-blowing league of its own. Also, I know that the seafood factor ties their food together, but genre-wise, it still feels like it has some sort of identity crisis. King crab and guacamole dish was Mexican, tuna and kimchi dish was Korean, poutine dish was Canadian, Mac and cheese was American. For such an upscale and swanky restaurant at a five-star hotel, I expect(ed) a much more, dare I say, ""specialized"" dining experience. Not to say the food was not good - not at all; just a few inches short of amazing. 

Do you see what I mean? I genuinely and desperately want to love, not just like, Lakeside. But something unspoken about it which I can't quite pinpoint - albeit tiny and insignificant - needs to be tweaked. Just ever so slightly.

1350992,2012-03-25,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"While my wife loved Lakeside, I thought it was little more than fare that tried to be imaginative, wrapped in mediocrity. The calamari was slightly better than average, coming with Ancho Chile Aïoli, Chimichurri, Lemon dipping sauce. I used just lemon, finding that the sauce was, well, nothing special so why ruin passable calamari with it. Frankly, the chopped vegetable salad was the best dish I had, but at $16, again overpriced. I gave the Marinated King Prawns on Toasted Israeli Cous Cous, Salsa Verde at $38 a try and it was clear they tried to hard. They were jumbo and I were four in number, a more than reasonable portion for a dish that lacked flavor, or if it had it, I missed it. I have to idea what ""Israeli Cous Cous"" is, notwithstanding spending a lot of time in Israel, though the components were relative large, about the three times the size of regular cous cous. My wife had Pan Roasted Striped Sea Bass with Braised Fennel, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Saffron Sauce, which she characterized as very good but a tad dry.

It was my wife's birthday dinner and she selected the restaurant. She did enjoy immensely, though I think the ambiance had as much to do with it as anything else. We were fortunate enough to have them fulfill our request to be seated by the lake and the view, with the waterfall and dancing balls is wonderful. We very much enjoy the Bellagio's Dancing Fountains and thought this was almost, if not equal in entertainment.

Lakeside is clearly overpriced for the quality, though probably not for the quantity, as the portions were about the only thing that was perfect, other than the ambiance.

I suppose, overall, that was my major disappointment...but that my wife was happy with her selection and enjoyed herself mitigated that somewhat. Oh, knowing it was my wife's birthday, they did give her a small cupcake with a candle which she said was very good....not enough, however, to share.

This has been a rather prolix review for me, so I'll leave you with this thought: There are many far better restaurants in Las Vegas...skip this one.

Oh, and my repeated final note: It is neither polite nor classy to be tapping out messages or talking on cell phones in a restaurant. Save it for a truck stop. You're neither that important nor do you need to be that well-connected.",o5WZkkTuNwMvDhfYuzT-5A,0,0,2,Eok_yj6Bhilu2ICDv9JfhA

The fish we ordered was superb. Perfectly cooked with some very nice garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. 
To add to the experience they baked some gluten free bread for my wife and served it right out of the oven. The chef also stopped by to personally check that her allergy concerns were addressed.

Perfect for two with the sides and app. The lobster risotto was creamy and had large chucks of lobster meat. The spinach was also super creamy and seasoned perfectly.

The sides...
- Lobster Macaroni and Cheese - cheesy and delicious, but this was just the side.
- Crab Fried Rice - The wok flavor was there.  The slight kick of curry was just enough to create a happy party on my tongue, but the rice was slightly dry.

The main dishes....
- Smoked Ribs - They were cold and not fall of the bone tender.  I couldn't make myself eat more than two and just give up.  Couldn't bare to waste precious calories on non-delicious food.
- Prime Rib - It's hard to compare to Lawry's Prime Rib's glorious meat, and Lakeside's prime rib certainly was NOT the juiciest and most tender.  My man even complained about the meat and the sauces, and he usually enjoys EVERYTHING.

food-
king crab & guacamole- ok, good amount of crab, but flavors lost and muddled by the odd and slightly difficult to handle presentation

fried calamari-pretty good.  fresh and crunchy.  nice flavor

rib eye 20oz-nice and juicy!  small bone and a bit of gristle.  Ordered med rare, but felt more rare than what i was use to. 

orange glazed salmon-good.  nice and moist.  asked for well done, but came out under possibly to save the fish.

My steak was ok but i ate maybe half as it was nothing special.

Lobster poutine was very bad call to use mozzarella as it was more like congealed wood glue rendering the dish one solid piece. Maybe a few pieces of lobster were free but almost impossible to eat/serve without a knife.

We had a large group and several servers and they were functional but with little personality or passion.  Maybe they are trained to serve stoic people from other places, but this is Vegas so let's at least have some energy.

I had the filet which was solid but no comparison to STK, Delmonicos or Del Frisco.

The atmosphere was much flatter than I expected for a Friday night.  We brought a fun group with the intention on being in the middle of some action.  The show that goes on over the water was a bit disappointing.  The upside was it was so quiet, it felt like we had a private dining room.

1747056,2015-05-25,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"Lakeside is a hard restaurant to give a rating to. Generally, I like to break it down into ambiance, service, and food. In this case, I want to add a fourth category of value for the dollar. In terms of ambiance, Lakeside gets a definite five stars. We sat on the patio right next to the lake and waterfall. SPECTACULAR. The tables are nicely spaced so you are not too close to other diners. And there is a ""show"" on the lake/waterfall about every 30 minutes that is just a lot of fun to view (a huge animatronics singing frog, dancing light orbs that procreate, musical laser imaging projected onto the waterfall, and more). Very entertaining. The service is a bit harder to rate. Our server came to the table almost immediately, explained the fish special, answered our questions about the menu, and took our drink order. He returned n a timely fashion to take our food order. However, after that we didn't see him again until the end of the meal. The food runners and busboy did a nice job bringing the food in a timely fashion and keeping our water glasses filled. But the waiter should really come by to make sure that things are going well. We had a couple of problems (minor) but no one to talk to. So for service, 4 stars at best. Next, the food. For the 4 of us, we got 2 tasting menus and 2 entrees and a side. The tasting menu, for $125 each, consists of 7 smaller courses that should give the chef a chance to show off what he is famous for. We had done this at Wynn's Country Club restaurant and it was one of the best meals I had ever eaten. Not so much here. It started with a caviar slider. Disappointing at best! While it was a very impressive presentation, all you tasted was the bread. Next came the seared big eye tuna. This was done very well, seared on the outside and near raw on the inside. Very flavorful. As good as I have had at Bone Fish or Kings Seafood locally. But not better. The remainder of the tasting menu was okay. Each was very impressive on presentation but just ordinary in flavor. Which brings me to my ""new"" fourth category - value. For $125, each dish on the tasting menu should knock your socks off with special preparation and flavor. This certainly didn't. For my separate entree, I ordered the tuna special, seared rare. It was quite good. At $48, much more than it would cost at one of the local upscale seafood restaurants for a comparable dish, but you expect to pay more on the strip, especially when they throw in the animatronics show. So Lakeside gets a begrudging 4 star rating from me. But will I come back? No! There are just too many upscale restaurants in this town that will knock my socks off at $500 for 4 people.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,3,2,4,-LPBmwyau_iua6u-OhqPJQ

Price: the main sticking point,,, I know it's the Wynn but couldn't help but feel it was a little overpriced for the offerings and fairly unoriginal menu and the drinks really double up the price QUICKLY.

Service: The service has always been excellent here,, but sometimes the bussing by committee and expediters get confused.

Ambiance: Excellent ambiance, great view of the lake, extremely clean, wide open.  Some people think the music is loud, but I found it to be a non-event.  Cool bonus to see the show as well!

The ""Lakeside"" is a funny man made lake where they do a water show starting around 8:30 (think singing frogs, dancing globes, cowboy hats- a real eclectic variety show). We sat outside to see the show, and can't deny that it was weirdly entertaining.
Everything in Vegas is expensive, especially when you stay within the hotels, but this place was crazy expensive for a pretty OK meal (expensive = $500+ for 3 people, drinks, apps, and sides- no entrees or desserts!)..
The sommelier was not so helpful, and was borderline rude. I guess that's what happens when you ask for a good value wine and the best options he can give are upwards of $200. 
We ordered apps to start (4 for the 3 of us) and were not so much feeling full entrees after the first round. We went with the King Crab guacamole, the tuna sashimi, the octopus and a salad. Everything good, not great, with the salad probably out-shining the seafood which should not be the case at a seafood restaurant! We ended up ordering a few sides as our second course and we were plenty full. Of the sides, the lobster Mac was pretty good, along with the creamed spinach.

This was by far the fanciest restaurant  (ive ever been to). Doesn't mean its the fanciest for you people who dine like this regularly :)
So the two dishes we ordered was lobster and steak. 
The steak (i dont remember which cut) was cooked to perfection when we asked for medium. As a side we had mashed potatoes. They were the creamiest mashed potatoes ive ever tasted. So good.
The Lobster was cooked perfect as well. It came with a couple butters if i remember correctly. 

The bill: two dinners and two alcoholic drinks came out to $200. :x
Kinda a lot but it was a special occasion. 

We requested over the phone to be sat outside in the patio by the water but after several attempts we got denied saying it was booked for the night. 

After dinner we decided to quickly try our luck on the nearest slot machine just for fun.

Ended up winning over $450. Lol. 
So that paid for our $200 dinner. (So dinner was free and on the wynn hotel) and its like they also paid us $250 cash as a thank you. :)
So needless to say.... it was a great free night plus they paid us.",VaPYoEJn9UQGqkltAqQb_g,1,1,5,jwNp7ORJqWm4vbR_DE2FAw

I can see why people would expect a lot, since the competition is tough as sh*t. But putting other restaurants aside, I did enjoy my meal here. The food and service were great, and the place was very very pretty :)

I came here with my bf's family (+ a friend) for my bf's brother's birthday. The good thing about going with his family is - they don't seem to have a budget for food (or anything, really). Big, wealthy gamblers.. lol yup.

Anyway, they ordered two chilled seafood platters, a couple small plates of foie gras, a dozen kumamoto oysters on the half shell, and one fried calamari dish for appetizers. This was appetizers for 6 people lol... a bit much, but I wasn't complaining.

The seafood platter came with cocktail shrimps, king crab legs, lobsters, ceviche, and oysters. The oysters (both from the platter and the kumamoto) were as fresh as it gets, and comes with the usual tabasco, cocktail sauce, etc. BOMB. I love raw oysters. The cocktail shrimps were huge and crisp, and although it was probably as good as cocktail shrimps get - they were outshined by the lobster and king crab legs. Lol, but of course. Everything on the platter was great though - fresh and flavorful.

I ordered the rib eye cos I was feelin meaty, and it was YUM. It came with a chimichurri sauce that was a bit spicy and it paired well together. It had this delicious peppery char on it, mmmmmm.. I only ate like 15% of it though... the appetizers filled me up good :( My bf ordred the rib eye as well, and added a bacon and blue cheese crust. It was GOOOOOD. We also had sides of mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese, and asparagus. Mac and cheese was just ok, but I didn't try the other sides.

The birthday boy ordered a 5 pound lobster because why not........................ which totaled to $575........ which puts it at $115 per pound. WTF. LOL. I mean, it was shocking.... but I suppose not that surprising...... haha. I did get to try it, and it was amazing. Succulent, fresh lobster meat, and I LOVED the green dipping sauce. Maybe like a basil-y butter sauce? SOO delicious.

So like I said, I enjoyed my experience here. Oh and the show at the lakeside... lol, they were weird I guess. Very whimsical but also kind of random... floating, colorful balls and singing frogs among other things. LOL but I don't really care about that stuff.

Starters:
Ahi poke - tasty with jalapenos
Soft shell crab, fried with a spicy sauce - just ok (reminded me of an Outback bloomin' onion)

Salad (most disappointing course of the evening) - should have gotten the lobster bisque.  The heirloom tomato salad was icky (soggy cut up big chunks of tomatoes and bits of mozzarella and they forgot the pistachios and the flavor; when I asked the server about them, he looked confused.  Shouldn't you know the dishes?  This salad was definitely not worth $20!  Wish I could give this dish negative stars.
(Maybe I've been spoiled from eating the most amazing heirloom salad at Jaleo in Wash, DC.  Now that's how it should be done!)

Entrees:
Dover sole - covered in dry, crusty bread crumbs, couldn't even taste the fish, and the broccolinis were mostly hard stem pieces.  Hope all their other fish dishes aren't as disappointing.
Lobster risotto saved the day - very well done
Sides - crab mac&cheese and asparagus were good but pricey at $14-$16

Dessert:
Absolutely the highlight of the meal and saved it from being totally mediocre.
Get the Strawberry Napoleon, but only if you like basil.  Who knew ice cream could be basil flavored?  Surprising and delightful combination of flavors.

The service was very good and brought the star rating up.  I read some of the other reviews, but we found our waiter to be very attentive and, unlike the server, he knew everything about the menu.  Wish he had turned me off the dover sole, though.  He was the one who recommended the Strawberry Napoleon, so all is forgiven.  We never had to ask for drink refills and plates were cleared without our even noticing.

It's definitely a no-brainer that you need to call early and make a reservation especially on a popular dining night. Which is basically any night in Las Vegas. Ask to be seated by the lake so that you can enjoy the show and the view of the lake. I would suggest making a reservation around six - 6:30 PM, as that way you get to experience the Lakeside view during the day and night. I think, if I remember correctly, the shows that are done on the lake, start around seven or 730 and performed each half hour there after. The service is wonderful, very classy and intelligent wait staff accompanied by a sommelier to help make your liquor & wine choice. The food itself is delicious, no question about it.

First, we walked in with no reservation and although there were multiple tables available at the ""lake side"" the entire time we were dinning, we were told that those are reserved for people who make reservations.  So yes, I joked with the guy about going outside and calling him... but, in fact we were ""punished"" and had to eat inside for being walkins!  
Next, I know this place has a $$$$ rating , but we didn't know that, and what was shocking to me was that there was no bottle of red wine available under $70.  Period. Zip. Never seen that on the strip before.
Next, the food...  I had the scallops, and my wife had the Lobster risotto, and while it was ok, it was highly unremarkable for the price.  Also, the portions are ""euro style"" so if you are a hungry American used to decent sized portions, better give it a miss.
Finally, the ""shows"" over the water are really tacky.. there's one with a giant mechanical frog that sings ""it's a wonderful world"" and then some ""dancing colored balls"" on the water that act like a flirting couple that eventually has a baby ball!?!  Embarrassingly tacky at the very least and just makes you shake your head.  Imagine the people in a meeting designing that... ""yeah, and then we'll have this giant frog sing on top of the waterfall!  It will be amazing!.. Yeah!""  

Suffice to say, this was sufficiently bad as to assure we never step foot in the Wynn again.  There's plenty of choice in Vegas after all.",2kM35MjiCVAV08tfN49aZA,0,0,1,B2KBGOc4_6OCcWbiqLwbmA

I am still dreaming of the amazing steak and lobster tail I had- the steak had a delicious, salty crust which surrounded tender and flavorful meat. I am not usually a steak eater but I almost turned into Spalding from ""Caddyshack"" asking the table ""Are you going to eat your fat?"" The lobster was perfectly cooked and buttery and the whole she-bang was put on a tomato sauce that tasted like the most intense, flavorful marinara you have ever had. I had one of the truffles from the dessert menu and it was this interesting combination of rich chocolate and salt- sounds weird but if you are like me and love sweet/salty, this is your jam. One cool part of the meal is the Lake of Dreams show that occurs every 30 minutes. It was weird and quirky and the highlight of my kids' dinner.

The service is about * * *

The only negative about this restaurant at The Wynn is the fact that even with reservations, the communication was fairly poor.  We had to continue to ask the front desk for a status update and it took actual proactive complaining to get any results.  We had a reservation, so not a walk in.  It was a scheduled appointment.  The entire party was present.  A 15 minute wait was given, which turned into over 45 minutes to nearly an hour before, because it was a professional business dinner, the host of the party who made the reservations felt embarrassed enough to have his clients wait and wait and wait that he had to take issue with the front desk to which the squeaky wheel I guess got the oil and we were seated.  An apology gesture of a free appetizer was given in lieu of their tardy seating.

The food overall was good, it's a bit expensive, especially The Lobster.

The food, regardless or despite the price, if I had to evaluate it was excellent.",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,4,2,4,cKpj5tV1iZCiOX3wpbFaRA

I called two weeks ahead and made reservations requesting outside seating by the lake for our proposal dinner.  The receptionist was very friendly and made annotations in the reservation reference out special night.  

A day prior to our dinner I arrived at the Wynn and spoke with Lakeside manager Elian.  He was extremely helpful and suggested a few creative ways to execute the proposal.  I had a special jewelry box crafted for her ring and did not want to risk her seeing me bring it to the restaurant the day of, so he held it at the restaurant for me.  He assured us prime seating by the lake the next day and guaranteed a magical evening.

The next evening we both arrived in anticipation of a spectacular dinner, and a little surprise for her.  We arrived 30 minutes early and were immediately seated next to the lake.  I excused myself for a moment and met with Elian to give him the ring.  He assured me the staff was informed and would do everything they could to make our evening special.  I went back to the table and we were both treated to a spectacular dining experience.  

They start by bringing by a large tank of lobsters directly to the table.  A description of each is giving with a price attached.  My girlfriend (fiance now), thought they were too adorable to eat....lol.  Our waiter, Renee, was personable and very knowledgeable about every item on the menu.  We ended up sharing a bowl of delicious king crab corn chowder and prawn cocktail to start.  The chowder is seriously some of the best we have had.  For entrees, she had the chili rubbed prime rib with king crab, and I went with the 20oz prime rib with a roasted lobster tail add-on.  Everything was excellent and cooked to perfection.

After finishing our entrees, a small tray was brought out with my custom made jewelry box on it, flanked by two complimentary deserts.  She took one look at it and was speechless.  I removed the ring from the box and took a knee to propose to her.  After she said yes, complimentary champagne was poured and staff and patrons gave their congratulations.

We stayed and had more drinks, enjoying the fun and quirky shows they have every 30min right on the lake.  We never felt rushed and Renee continued to stop by to make sure we had everything we needed.

On our way out, I stopped by and made sure to let Elian know how much we enjoyed dinner and the extra special attention given to make our evening special.  He thanked us for choosing the Lakeside and hoped we would return.  

After the excellent service we received, I assured him we would definitely return to their wonderful establishment.  My fiance suggested we return every year now for an anniversary dinner.  I don't have any problems with that.",T8bwidIJrJ0Th3Depq2e-w,1,3,5,NXmOkBe8YK6SM-NcQXNwLQ

All in all, although it is pricey, you will definitely get what you pay for thanks to the deliciously decadent food, attentive service and incredible ambiance - indoors or out, it is a nice treat to have the gorgeous view overlooking the Lake of Dreams and being able to view the show.  Set to various types of music, the show is every 30 minutes and sometimes romantic, sometimes lighthearted and fun (even for kids).  

We ""conservatively"" ordered what turned out to still be a ton of food & drinks between 7 of us and after gratuity, I believe the final bill was just under $800.  As our company was footing the bill, nobody ordered anything very extravagant (ie. Caviar for $165 or Rock Lobsters at $95 per pound), but we totally had many reasonable options to choose from at fair prices for the quality and substantial amount of food.  One coworker is Vegan and was thrilled with not only her Old Bay ""Crab Cake"" dish, but the fact that ALL Wynn restaurants feature Vegan menu options.  A few of us ordered and enjoyed the Alaskan halibut and could not even come close to finishing it due to the heaviness of the starters and shared side dishes that we ordered for the table.  Some people ordered salads while some of us shared the oh-so-yummy Crab Guacamole.  We also ordered Asparagus with Balsamic Cream, Alaskan Crab Mac & Cheese (rich & creamy is an understatement) and Harissa Spiced French Fries (which virtually went untouched, not for lack of flavor, but for lack of space in our bellies).

So let me tell you what I would order NEXT time (cause yes, I will return!):  One coworker ordered the Mesquite Smoked Prime Rib and HOLY COW...it was amazing!!  Like, SO good that he gave each of us (except the Vegan) a bite or two and we all had dish envy.  Technically the dish envy started when his cut of beef arrived at the table in a glass chamber to contain the smoke!!  See what I mean about presentation!?!  

Needless to say, we did not even entertain looking at the dessert menu.  However, I would be remiss to not mention the amazing cocktail that i had!  If there is a passion fruit flavored drink on a menu anywhere, I go for it and I am so glad I went for this one:  the Fiesta Fatale Margarita!!!  Translation??:  A margarita with Passion Fruit and Sriracha that will knock your socks off!  No, it wasn't spicy (though the side dish of spiced nuts to complement it ARE tasty & spicy), but it is just THAT good!!  Wines by the glass were also very good, but VERY expensive.  Brace yourself for bottle prices, too.  Eek!!  I could almost hear all of us getting in trouble with the Accounting Dept for even THINKING about ordering some of the bottles on that menu.

The view of the waterfall outside & show is cool.
The waiter was pleasant.

Cocktails were $15 each and tasted terrible.

I had a reservation months in advance and requested a table by the water but somehow we still could not get this. The hostess was friendly enough and gave us the best table available which still had a decent view. The first server we had did not really explain the menu and seemed put off by my questions about the lobster options. We were sharing some appetizers and trying to decide whether to get it to all come out at once or appetizers first or a combination and he offered no advice except silence. We placed orders and he was to come back to take the wine order but I sat there for 10 minutes with the wine list open and no service. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and they poured this from the bottom of an open bottle and this tasted like it sat overnight or for out for too long. The server had to change shifts and I had to request another glass of wine. Our appetizers arrived and there no serving spoons provided to share and we had to request these. During the appetizers we still had not received bread and we had to request. The mains arrived as well as my lobster order but no butter was provided. I had to ask again and they brought out the 3 different butters but these were not heated in advance so I had a lobster entree ready to eat but cold drawn butter. Many restaurants get the table ready and start heating up the butter well in advance. On eating the lobster it was undercooked and I had to request assistance again to cook it a little more. When It came back there was the same issue and for the first time ever I did not finish lobster on my plate. The whole evening was a series of unnecessary requests repeatedly which was not enjoyable. There is a bizarre light and music show lakeside which did not go well with the restaurant and intended ambience. Washrooms are nice.

We had reservations and were seated out on the patio by Natalia, who was a friendly helpful hostess, with whom I bantered a bit with about wishing there was no smoking allowed on the patio.  

Our server was Vince and he provided excellent, efficient and affable service throughout the meal. 

It was also nice that Richard the manager dropped by and chatted and made us feel very welcome.  I told him that some reviews on Yelp have been kind of negative and he acknowledged the issue and we both realized that it's hard to control opinions on a public forum like Yelp.  

But regarding some of those complaints about slow or poor service, our experience was exactly the opposite.  We had superb service throughout our evening.

We started with the crab/avocado salad and the shrimp cocktail, My favorite of the two was the shrimp, though the shrimp crackers that came with my wife's crab/avocado were super tasty. 

Our entree was halibut for me and scallops for my wife.  I asked that my halibut be cooked simply without sauce or embellishment and this was done to my satisfaction with simple butter and lemon. This time, I think my wife's sea scallops were my favorite.  They were super sweet and very tender.  Not that my halibut wasn't lovely, it's just that I liked the scallops a bit more.

Sides were asparagus and fried mushroom rice.  This mushroom rice was very good and made a great side.

For dessert we went all out and had a super sundae, and man-oh-man, this was over the moon and over the top good.  So rich, so decadent, so yummy. 

Again, we were very pleased with our dinner at Lakeside and like all the Wynn/Encore restaurants this one is top notch.

After a less than par customer service experience at another restaurant on the strip the night before, my husband and I decided to head the lake for a drink before seeing David Spade. When we got to the lake, we realized that the wait for the cocktail-only area was going to be pretty long, and since we were hungry for dinner, we decided to give it a shot and ask if they had any tables at the Lakeside. 

We walked up to the hostess desk and timidly asked if there were any tables available outside. Now keep in mind, it was 8:30 PM on a Saturday night with the beautiful Wynn lake shows going every thirty minutes, so a patio table was gold. To our complete surprise, the host very nicely said yes! He said that we got very lucky and that they had a couple no shows, so he quickly showed us to an amazing table right on the lake and sat us within two minutes of a show starting. I was completely blown away by their level of customer service. But it doesn't stop there. We didn't have a ton of time (unfortunately because I could have sat there all night), since we were seeing a 10 PM show but when the waitress came up and took our order she was extremely receptive to our time crunch and put our order in right away. She was extremely friendly every step of the way. From there we enjoyed the beautiful weather and atmosphere and watched the spectacular shows on the lake that were going on every 30 minutes. 

If you are anything like me and love atmosphere, you must (I repeat must) eat here. It's expensive but so is every other nice restaurant on the strip. Is it overpriced? Well of course! But they can do that in Vegas and don't think every other nice restaurant isn't doing the same thing! I will spend my money here because they treated us like royalty, accommodated us on a whim and listened to our needs in rushing our meal. This was one of my favorite parts of the trip because of how relaxing and beautiful the environment was. Oh and the food isn't bad either! In fact, it's quite delicious! I highly recommend the lobster mac and cheese with huge chunks of lobster and the crab cakes. Their Cesar salad is a hearty and flavorful salad to start with.

We arrive, sit down & they send over some guy who clears tables to give us the bad news, it doesn't start till 10:30. Said it doesn't say that on the website, he agrees. We decide its not going to spoil our evening. This poor guy was their sacrificial lamb to give us the bad news. Nice of them, isn't it. 

However we were on to the game they thought they were so clever in playing. It was a charity fund raiser, the difference in what they made  screwing the charity was nil compared to the good will they would of got. Good judgement trumped by greed. Now I after reading another post on here, someone else was told something different about the timing. Yet all of this was absent on the 3 Square website?  We've eaten at several dining places in the last 2 weeks. This isn't a new event in Vegas. They bait & switch using a fundraiser.    

Have dined here a few times, I liked the food. Past tense. Last night was very underwhelming & the last time we dine there. The quality has been cut to squeeze out the biggest profit margins. Those into fine dining can see it. The descriptions would emphasis the most expensive ingredients & those would be missing or barely there. We've experienced this at the last few times we dined out at the Wynn. doubt if we'll be going back. But the beauty of Vegas is there are plenty more places to go.  
 
After hearing/reading Wynn's greedy paranoid rants over the current administration, I said to husband, watch the quality of offerings go down on his properties.  Well its happened.  Never enough for these kind. 

Next move will be Wynn charging using a form of measuring he understands very well - Grams.

This place is nestled in the Wynn Hotel next to the lake of dreams.  I wasn't sure how expensive this place was, so when I saw the prices I had some sticker shock!    

I rolled with it and picked the Prime Rib.  It was 20 ounces of pure DELIGHT!  I had it cooked medium rare and it came out perfect. It had some mushrooms on it and it was the best rib eye I've ever had.  The prime rub is GRASS FED. 

We also had the Salmon and Far Qua.

Service was spectacular.  This was real fine dining. My Cherry Pepsi was always full, except for 10 mins when a large group next to us sat down. 

The waiter was very nice and friendly. No stick up anyone's behind here!

We got to sit next to the window which is next to a lake that plays a unique little 3-5 minute show every 20 minutes.  Had a fun time here for sure.  This place and its ambiance is great for a romantic evening with a significant other.  Highly recommended for sure!

The setting in front of the Wynn waterfall is great and a lot of fun to watch the show every 30 minutes. But the food was just average. They bring a giant cage of lobsters out...which our painfully overpriced...115$ a pound hahaha! Oh by the way they only have lobsters over 3 pounds. They pride themselves on being the only restaurant on the strip with south Australian lobster...well when you charge that much it's not doing you any good!! I've had those same lobsters shipped to my house for half that price! The bread they bring you is pretty good, I love pretzel bread. We had oysters on the half shell...they were just okay. My husband had swordfish which was pretty tasty and the lobster poutine which was the star of the meal!! I had Maine lobster which was just okay. They split it for you so you don't have to do any work. We also ordered Brussels sprouts, they were very undercooked. Drink selection was good.

When we called to make reservations they told us gentlemen must be wearing ties and slacks. That's fine...except we got there and people were on shorts and a polo.

3432216,2015-09-27,2,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"My husband and I have been wanting to come here for sometime, but because it is a fine dining restaurant, we really needed a good reason to come. So we came to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary. 

My husband easily and quickly made reservations online and added to the notes what we were celebrating and that we would prefer patio seating.

A few hours before our dinner reservation, my husband received a call from the restaurant to confirm our reseravations. My husband also took the opportunity to ask what the dress code was and they did let him know that it was business casual. It's nice to get dressed up when my husband loves his t-shirts, shorts and sporting his kicks. 

Upon arrival, because of our request, we waited for a bit. During this time in the bar area, my husband got a chance to enjoy a ""STELLA!"" Apparently something my husband and the bartender have in common on how to say Stella Artois.

While waiting, instead of a dessert cart or dim sum cart wheeling through the restaurant, it was large very alive lobster cart. Apparently, the Maine lobsters don't even compare to the lobsters served by Lakeside. The most expensive and largest lobster feeds 8 people, which includes the whole lobster and the meat goes through half the  body and into the legs. It is an Australian lobster at $178/lb. Great learning experience, but not in my budget. Additionally, I am not much a lobster person and prefer crab. I learned from my father and have experienced that the larger a crustacean,  the tougher the meat and lacks flavor.  

As our table was ready, the hostess led us to the patio where we were met by the restaurant manager to wish us a happy birthday and anniversary. Apparently, the seat they had for us is the best in the house and I would agree. We were able to see everything and enjoy the ""cultured"" watershow. 

My husband ordered a glass of syrah. As I get older, alcoholic drinks just makes me tired. So I ordered a refreshing raspberry fizz. I also recommend ordering the bottled water as the house water does not taste filtered. They serve Fiji water. 

Being from HI we appreciated the Hawaiian fishes that were available. The bread selection included little french baguette, foccacio and naan. The naan was my favorite as it was made with furikaki (sesame seeds and seaweed flakes). For starters, my husband enjoyed the oyster Rockefeller and we shared my king crab chowder. My husband loved his starter and the chowder, not only tasty but filling.

My husband's entree was a medium chili pepper rubbed rib eye with grilled crab leg. The steak also had two grilled chili's on top so there was a small portion of his steak that was a little too spicy for him. The steak portion was large that my husband could eat only half of it. I ordered the Hawaiian sea bass. You can choose from 4 preparations, I went with the Mediterranean which included artichoke, olive oil. The fish was a little smaller than my fist and it was thick. I felt the outside of the fish was cooked just a little too much that I used a knife to cut through. However, the inside was cooked perfectly. For our sides, we ordered the lobster poutine and bok chow. They definitely don't skimp. The bok chow had 8 bundles. When you go to the Asian market, there's a dozen to a bag. The bok chow was cooked well and went well with the steak and fish. The poutine was just okay but I'm a poutine novice.

The water show runs every 30 minutes which is perfect to take a break in between bites because it is a lot of food. Did I mention that the water shows are very ""artistic"". I like all the technology used.

Dessert was yummy! I ordered the creme Brule which was made with lychee and passion fruit and topped with mamgo. Lychee is my favorite. You can taste the lychee in the dessert and the mango pieces were a little tart so it was a perfect compliment. Because it was also my birthday, they gave us a small red velvet cupcake. It really was a perfect size to follow our filling dinner.

Before we left, the second waiter who delivered the desserts offered to take our picture. Super sweet, and they made it a point to refer to us as Mr and Mrs Santiago, even upon leaving, wishing us a good night and one last happy birthday and anniversary.

Mahalo to all the Lakeside staff for taking the time to make this a beautiful evening for my husband and I.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,0,1,5,ZFxCYe1vsU3eo9CxSpGtgQ

Our dinner started at 8:30pm and we were seated near the outside view of the waterfall/light show.  As I walked past the other tables, the server had brought out a live lobster on a tray to show other guests.  Too bad I am not a fan of lobster!

This restaurant doesn't offer a tasting menu.  Everything is a la carte.  The average price for each dish is around $40 which I find it being very reasonable for its location and ambience.  We ordered couple appetizers and four entrees.   The only dish I thought was average was their foie grais.   The seafood dishes were all above average.  Even the bread basket they served was pretty good.  

My favorite dish was the lobster risotto.  The shrimps, scallops and fish dishes were good but I would order their lobster risotto next time.  And yes, this is one of those restaurants I would dine over and over again when I'm in Vegas.  

We looked over the dessert menu after our dinner and noticed they did not serve coffee ice cream.  The waiter tried to best to find that flavor ice cream by calling the restaurant next door since the pastry chef works at both restaurants.  We suggested a shot of espresso and a scoop of their vanilla ice cream instead.  Affogato style!  He was able to make that magic happen and we happily ate this amazing ice cream that was made from scratch by their own chef.   Next time I am ordering my own!   The espresso was from illy which made the overall dessert taste that much better!   

Lobster risotto and Affogato for dessert.  That's all I can say about this place that makes them 4 stars!",_m3SyztWE_ji0wLxsL2Ycg,6,4,4,PHFftVESAc3P_N5IN1_pUA

When the meal arrived, the scallops were on my filet mignon instead of my husband's plate.  We told the server who brought out the meal, and I moved the scallops off my plate to my husband's.  After several bites of my filet, I noticed it was not cooked long enough.  The server agreed.  She offered to start cooking a fresh steak, or to put my partially eaten steak back on the grill.  Since we were going to see Le Reve at 9:30 pm, and needed to watch time, I said to just cook the filet a bit longer (it was nice that she offered to start fresh).  My husband's rare rib eye was overcooked.  We realize what happened - the kitchen cooked my steak rare instead of medium; and my husband's steak was cooked to my request - medium - and thus overcooked from his rare order.  That explained the mix-up with the scallops as well.  For over $200 for the meal (without wine) - I expected more and was disappointed.

Liked the Strip Steak Sandwich that's moist with heap of juicy caramelized onions and truffled Robiola cheese which made it even taste marvelous with every bite. Large portioned.
For the love of chocolate or sweets, there's a sweet cart named Desire that is desirable for sweet cravings in bite-sized dessert portions in chocolate, nuts, fruits and with creamy fillings.

They had these rare breeds (at least in the US) of lobsters... Do something different than steamed or as a thermidor, to show off the flavor differences... Something...

Crustaceans are delicious, and have different and unique flavor profiles. I'm probably in the minority, but I think I would have rather seen them showcased and prepared so the differences popped, rather than leaving it up to us to pick out the subtle nuances in our typical/favored preparation.

3618226,2013-04-01,12,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"Lakeside is for when you're too cheap to pay to go watch Le Reve, but still want to treat your special someone to a show. Sit outside if it's not too hot/cold and if seating is available. You'll be treated to a dazzling display of colors, along with animatronic blue balls, colorful butterflies, and more. The show sorta incorporates all the feelings of a first date. All this takes place against a beautiful man made waterfall as a backdrop.

While we weren't able to grab a seat outside, the hostess put us in the next best spot. A seat in the middle of the gorgeous dining room looking out onto the water show. Once we were seated, the waiter placed a napkin on my lap. Not too sure I'm diggin' some of these fancy dinin' traditions.

They brought out a delicious looking spread of various breads. Unfortunately we were told only the raisin bread is Vegan. The guy did offer to swap out the butter for margarine. The raisin bread made for an excellent tasting appetizer. 

I brought my girl here because I had read about the ""clam"" chowder. Clam Chowder was always one of my favorite things back in the day, and one of the few things I missed when I first went Vegan. Since I've never seen a Vegan version before I was excited to try it out. Now, my memory may be slightly hazy since It's been over 15 years but it tastes just like Campbell's used to make. I say that seriously since that's my memory of what clam chowder tastes like. It was pricey ($15) for a small soup but totally worth it. Besides with a cashew base, it's a very rich dish so you probably wouldn't want to eat a giant bowl of it anyways.

My sweetie and I both spotted the Old Bay ""Crab"" Cakes due to the fact the sexy orange menu description noted that it sits on a bed of toasted pasta. The idea of getting two meals in one sounded good to me. The ""crab"" cakes themselves were amazing. Even better than the pasta that originally drew us towards this dish. The chefs at all of these places in The Wynn really know how to dress up these Gardein products.

I'm not too keen on the sad looking lobsters being carted around from table to table being offered up for a boiling death at $95/lb. Something else that always annoys me at these high end restaurants is that they look at you like you have a dick on your forehead when you don't order ""enough"" food. Since we intended to sample many of the Vegan options throughout the Wynn during our stay, we only ordered the two things here. The waiter seemed to be disappointed by the fact that's all we ordered. It's ok dude, The Wynn as a whole will earn the majority of my spending money throughout this and future stays. I'm not gonna drop it all in one place when we're not even that hungry.

Other than that, Lakeside is a beautiful restaurant with delicious Vegan options that are sure to impress. I would come back here again once I tried all the other offerings in The Wynn first.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,12,8,4,MyV4m8Bxu7hw6o6DrJWLtQ

To my disappointment, they did not carry the bacon chocolate bars, but the view was nice.  The hostess hooked us up with an outdoor seat by the lake since it was my birthday weekend.  We weren't super hungry, so we took a little time to order our food.  Afterward though, their service was a bit slow and they didn't come back to check on us often.  I ordered their lobster soup, which was really delicious and then I simply ordered a side of mushroom fried rice.  The waiter wasn't kidding when he said the sides should be shared, as they were large (enough for three people).  The rice was good, but on the salty side, so I wasn't able to finish it.  My boyfriend had the prime rib (even though one of my coworkers who was originally from Vegas insisted that we never, ever order prime rib  anywhere).  The rib was good and tender, but contained lots of tendon and fat.  My boyfriend liked it overall.

I think the view was the best part.  We stayed there for about an hour and a half, so we saw three different shows. They play a little show on the lake every 30 minutes where they project images and music onto the waterfall.  They had a singing frog and a little animation clip.  They animation clip was my favorite, we saw that part shortly before we took off.  The staff even surprised us with a mini cupcake for my birthday.

I had the ""Saute'ed Atlantic Sea Scallops', with celery root puree, apple chutney, and vandouvan sauc. It was four pieces, nothing special. She had the Roasted Organic Chicken. She didn't even finish it, but said it was really good. Our desert was the Smores, which was unique and really good. It's strong point was the graham cracker, and it's weakpoint was that it had too much fudge, and a little too much salt. I hate to sound too picky, but at a restaurant like this, I think you invite scrutiny.

Atmosphere: Beautiful, 5/5, perfect. 

Service: Not the best we've ever experienced, but far from the worst . We reserved a table at 8pm on the lakeside area. When we arrived, we were taken to a table in the inside. When we told the host that we really wanted an outside table, he advised us to wait in the bar. We waited 25 minutes, before I went back to the host to see what the status was. He quickly and nervously said, 'Ah! We're ready for you!' We saw a few open tables on the outside, and I think he may have forgotten about us. :\

When we were seated, the staff was very attentive, except for the very end, where they forgot to give us our desert (after a 12 minute wait) and handed us our bill instead. When she realized, she didn't ask us if we still wanted any, she bolted to the chef counter and we were given the desert about 3 minutes later.

This was uncomfortable; should we leave? The server brought us our wine, but spilled dessert wine over the side of my husband's glass and grinned about it instead of apologizing. 

The dessert and wine were wonderful and well made, but it was really uncomfortable and upsetting to be there when our server kept glaring at us from across the room.

This Restuarant is beautiful & has a waterfall outside. They played a laser show every 20 min or so. It was so nice. The lighting & the colors of the restuarant is just perfect. The bathrooms are so nice with orange sink. Very unique & trendy ambiance.

They have the Rib Eye Glatt Kosher steak!!!! I personally asked to see it, it was sealed & had the OU sign. I was so happy that they had this service. 

We ordered the Glatt kosher Rib-eye steak, the black bass & 2 of our friends ordered the regular steak with chili & crab on it. All dishes were very delicious.

We just have to sit & watch our friends eating their yummy steak while we eat our boring salmon!! So the fact that we could have our kosher steak with everyone else was just priceless.

I also heard all restaurants at Wynn have vegetarian & vegan menu.

I'd like to give it maybe 2.5 stars for the fact that I love the Wynn for most of its venus, and I was happy mostly with the food when dining at Lakeside. 

We're frequent diners about town and really wanted to go someplace neither of us had been. (Between the two of us, that's few and far between:) We decided on Lakeside because we both really dig the Wynn property and wanted to give the old space where 'Daniel Boulud' once was a try. 

It started to get a bit wonky beginning with reservations. We went to 'OpenTable.Com' to make a reservation for 9pm. Apparently the 'Restaurant Week' menu we wanted to try was only available after 930, and would end at 1030pm. (Though numerous websites with the 'Restaurant Week' menus stated that many of the started at 6pm...) The menu was priced at $50.11 per person and offered 3 courses. The choices wern't so spectacular, but we figured we would add on to the menu if needed. 

[sidenote: For some reason, when trying to reserve on OpenTable, the website would not allow us to make a reservation later than 715pm. I then called and the hostess at Lakeside moved it to 9pm for us. ]

Ok so 845pm rolls around, we head to the bar to have a couple of Stoli martinis ($28.50) and waited for our table. We were seated around 910pm after we indicated we would like to sit on the patio since it was a nice evening.

We get outside to a table nearly in the doorway and looked around for something else. All other tables for 2 were taken, so we stuck with it. Here's where it started to get bad. 

The table was directly downwind from the 'Parasol Down' bar terrace that sat in the water next to us. MUCH cigar smoke was blowing in my direction as a result. With the door from the restaurant open, it was tolerable due to the draft from inside the restaurant.. so I dealt with it. Then the server closed the door to the restaurant. lol.. I asked if he could re-open it, to which he told me he had to ask his manager. The door never got re-opened. My friend even decided to take a Benadryl to combat the allergy she has to crappy cigarette smoke ;|

We wern't  trying to make issues so we dealt, as the smoke had started to subside due to a breeze. THEN a guy in a seat directly behind me began to literally chain smoke. A guy in the restaurant where we were eating.. This guy was lighting up like he was in a contest. Cigarette after cigarette.. im like.. ok dude, you win.. stop! It was so bad.

This pretty much began the ruin for me. Due to new laws voted into existence by the residents in Jan 2007.. smoking is banned in all establishments which sell food other than prepackaged snacks. Im pretty sure at nearly $100 a head, this is not a prepackaged snack kind of establishment. I was getting less tolerant. 

*
Then the very nice bread basket arrived that included warm fig rolls and that kept me quiet for a bit :) The food started to arrive and we enjoyed the 'King Crab Guacamole' we ordered to add on to our tasting menu. It was excellent!

Crisp, rice-like tortillas sprinkled with what tasted like Togoroshi spice accompanied a very well seasoned and tasty guacamole that was accented with sweet corn. Very light, very good. This was  the best part of the meal. 

My friend and I both had caesar salads as the first course on the tasting menu.. and they were so-so.. pretty basic caesar and that was it. You can't expect too much from a caesar salad, and you wern't going to get much from the presentation of these.  Boring at best. The other choice was a crab cake, and I have had my fill of those.. so caesar it was. (should of had the crab cake)

Her petit filet mignon garnished with a potato slice arrived, my swordfish with tomato sofrito came, both cooked perfectly and very tasty. No sides to accompany, but we were filling up right about now, so that was ok. 

The food at this point was very good. My friend even noted that whatever they are paying the grill guy, it wasn't enough.. because of the quality of the grilling. It really was excellent. 

From this point on, it was mini desserts offered with the tasting menu (a chocolate bar and a buffet-style piece of caramel cheesecake), 2 luke-warm, very short shots of espresso that we ordered, and just disappointment after disappointment. No check-backs from the server on any course, nothing to write home about for most of the meal and alot of smoke. 

I don't know what else to say.. it was a less than stellar dining experience. I know that having dined at many Wynn establishments, it's not usually something I regret.. but this was just bad. I don't see myself rushing back. The bill was just under $250 and was sort of disappointing for the price. 

Maybe it was an off night, maybe it was that most of the staff seems to be under 25 and inexperienced, but overall it was nearly a fail situation. Sorry! Better Luck to you!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,12,11,2,Xl0Q68xkJUeB9hSs9zTxDA

It's a dramatic setting with excellent food and service to match.

But Lakeside is the perfect balance between SW and Costa di Mare offering great steaks and freshly caught expedited Hawaiian fish in an upscale but still casual setting.

This is the perfect place for party that can't commit to either a full steak or seafood experience. The Hawaiian fish offering is the real deal and usually boasts Mahi Mahi, Mongchong and others with a variety of preparations.

Our servers were all super nice, and I've always loved the ambiance and location, especially getting to overlook the colorful fountain show that's outside. 

We started off with a 2000 Brunello Di Montalcino, which was one of the surprisingly tastier red wines that I've had. Appetizer wise, their ahi tuna delicious! It was very addicting as well. Once u stop, u just couldn't stop! I ordered the filet mignon with bone marrow as my entree, which was very good, but I must say that the LAMB was THE BEST. If you like meat and lamb, definitely order that! It was just so flavorful and tasty, just melted in ur mouth! But the BEST thing that's not on the menu has got to the the TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE! it is by the far the BEST mac n cheese that i have EVER had! seriously...order it and you WON'T regret! I would go back to this place anyday just to get the truffle mac n cheese, even to go! 

Once you're done with dinner, they roll out the dessert cart which totally sparkled in my eyes. There were a lot of choices and being a dessert fanatic, it was hard to choose. We finally decided on the chocolate covered caramel apples with nuts, a peanut butter cappuccino mousse (SO DELICIOUS omg), and a tirimisu in a cup.

I am most definitely NOT a vegan...but I like to try new stuff, so a friend took me out for a little sampling one night. We started with appetizers at SW steakhouse (see my other review), and then walked across the hall for dinner here.

Food-wise, the vegan menu was about the same as at SW. We ordered the ""clam"" chowder, which was ASTONISHINGLY like real clam chowder -- they use chopped oyster mushrooms to give that rubbery clam mouthfeel you know and love, and I swear even the crustiest old sea dog out of Nantucket wouldn't know the difference.

For entrees, we had the ""crab"" cakes and the ""fried chicken,"" which was made from this weird protein substitute called Gardein. Whatever it is -- it is AWESOME! Tastes like chicken, feels like chicken, looks like chicken...who knows what the hell it REALLY is (knowing the capitalist kingpin proletariat-grinders who frequent the Wynn, probably Soylent Green).

The waiter (actually, now that I think about it, it was the sommelier...the waiter wasn't too engaging)  was very attentive to our desire to try vegan stuff, so he had them send us a vegan bread basket, with vegan butter (more soylent green). It was great! We also had some wine, and then strayed from the vegan shtick for dessert, and ordered a few fun fruity little things that were fantastic.

Atmosphere-wise, I appreciate the fact that this restaurant is half open-air, on a sort of patio overlooking one of the fake lakes at the Wynn, facing a giant waterfall. Every 20-30 minutes or so, a cheesy 5-minute ""show"" takes place on the waterfall: two balls of colored light dance around, cooing and making weird sex noises until a little baby ball pops out. Weird! Another show features two giant steampunk-esque mechanical flowers that bloom and sort of flirt with each other in a creepy flowery way. Another mini-show is a weird avant-garde 80s pop-art extravaganza set to that lame-ass 80s song ""Oh Yeah"" by Yello. YOU know the one. And the last vignette (or whatever the hell you want to call this weird/lame-ass shit) is this SUPER-cheesy giant frog in a UBER-corny black Stetson who sings Garth Brooks's ""I've Got Friends in Low Places.""

4260692,2013-03-15,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"We try to come to Las Vegas at least a few times a year.  Although we generally stay at the Venetian, I make a point of researching the best restaurants before we arrive as the fine dining and concerts are what Vegas is all about for us.   There are a few restaurants that we dine at each time we are in town.  Although this was our first visit to the Lakeside, it has made ""the list"" and we will be returning in the future.

We asked specifically to have a nice table outside by the lake and it was spectacular!  The temperature was perfect and it was a wonderful experience.  I think that the only restaurant that can really top the view is the Eiffel Tower.  And while we had an amazing view at the Eiffel Tower the previous night, it was very hot and stuffy there.  The Lakeside was far superior.  (Likewise, we were at Delmonico's several nights ago and our ""view"" was an exit sign near the door even though the restaurant was not crowded and we will not be back.) When you are paying $100 per person, you truly want the whole ambiance of the restaurant to be perfect.

Our waiter, Douglas, was superb.  He was knowledgeable in suggesting a wine when I asked for a dry, ""oak-type"" white wine.  He was helpful in every way and went with the flow when I engaged him in conversation.  He suggested that the side dishes were quite large and I appreciated this information.  The entire staff was excellent and even the waiter who brought the bread and other amenities was THE BEST.

I have to state that the Lakeside has the most unique and delicious breads of any restaurant we have eaten at in Las Vegas.  Their raisin bread was AMAZING!

Additionally, I had one of the most enjoyable appetizers consisting of an Alaskan King  Crab/Guacamole combination.  It was excellent!

My main entree was jumbo shrimp and they were huge.  Moreover, the restaurant fulfilled my every request when I asked for specific ingredients    on the side.  

The Lakeside also has some of the most unique (and yummy!) side dishes.  We had a scallop/shrimp fried rice dish and an Alaskan King Crab type of macaroni dish.  Both were superb!

The dessert menu was extensive, but nothing really grabbed my attention so we decided to pass on it.  I know if we had not been so full that we might have sampled it, however.

The ONLY criticism that I had of the restaurant was that they do have the fresh lobsters on a cart and wheel them to your table to help with enticing you to order the lobster.  Although I love the taste of lobster, I personally don't like being their ""executioner"" and having to look at them.  I realize that this is simply good form, but I just found it to be really sad.  

The Lakeside is a marvelous restaurant that lives up to its reputation in every way.  I spoke with the Manager and it was clear that she values the feedback from diners.  The place is exquisite without being pretentious, yet is impeccable in following fine dining etiquette.  However, when their diners are of a more relaxed persuasion, they have no trouble adapting.  It has my highest recommendation.",nJivT1Htei2B2Jiw9fvfww,0,0,5,QUX8p2myAHDKpquDPgbCHg

I was very excited because the menu looked fabulous and I've never had less than a fabulous meal at the Wynn or Encore.  We were very excited about the fresh Hawaiian fish they boast about.  Three of us had the Opakapaka (pink snapper) and although the fish was fine, the preparation was completely lacking in flavor, unimaginative, bland and boring.  Two of us had the scallops with the same preparation and we all felt the same way about our meal.  The only satisfied person in our party had a filet.  Considering Lakeside is a seafood restaurant, the fish should knock your socks off.  The desert trio which includes cotton candy was very good though.  The view from the outdoor patio with the light show made a nice background but since we had just seen LeReve, (fantastic!!), this light show was about as disappointing as the food!

There are so many fantastic restaurants in Vegas, many of which we've eaten at before.

I came with a party of 5 late on a weekday evening in January, so there was no trouble getting seated immediately.  I think the total bill for all 5 came out to somewhere around $300 with tip and most people did not have a full, multi-course meal.  A few people had 1-2 glasses of wine, and I think there were a couple of appetizers and desserts along with each person's entree.

The good - Lakeside Grill has both vegetarian and vegan items.  That's great when you have a variety of diets in your group.  Unfortunately, the menu as a whole is pretty small.  I wasn't asking for Cheesecake Factory menu-length by any means, but it would have been nice to have a few more choices.

I ended up sharing the mushroom risotto and truffle pizza with a friend.  Both were amazing, but the pizza should have been called ""Onion Pizza with Truffles"" rather than a truffle pizza.  The onions were completely distracting, and the pizza would have been about a million times better without them.  The risotto was delicious - not like the ""Rice a Roni"" tastealikes you get at most places.

Dessert was not quite as good, unfortunately.  I had 2 of their small desserts - a peanut butter cup thing and a s'mores dessert.  Although they were pretty good, they tasted a lot like stuff you'd get over at the Wynn Buffet.  I was hoping the s'mores dessert would be gooier, and that the peanut butter cup dessert would at least be possible to eat with the spoons they brought.  Neither one was silverware-friendly at all, which made for some awkward dining moments.

The atmosphere was great, albeit a little cheesy and weird when the giant Max Headroom-style head was being projected out over the water.  

My only major complaint was that the service was surprisingly bad for the price range of the meal.  Our waiter was extremely bad at reading signals (like all menus closed, making eye contact, etc.) and the delays in service easily added at least 30-45 minutes to the length of the meal.  Even paying was difficult, as they guy basically stopped coming around after we received our entrees.  We had to flag down someone else for dessert menus, and to order, and again to get the check.  They dragged our guy back to us, but you really shouldn't have to go to that much trouble when you're eating at a place with caviar on the menu.",eXPjio3AjM0gjSyXyCZJmg,0,1,4,L20S_kzQpgZaH_xrelMQKA

Wait staff was extremely knowledgeable regarding wine and the food and was very prompt. We started off with some crab cake appetizers, which were excellent, and then sauteed mushrooms.  We added asparagus because we all like it and it was fantastic.  But the best thing we ordered was the Yukon Gold creamy mashed potatoes.  Outstanding.  We may have never had mashed potatoes this good.  For dinner, I got the Salmon, which was large and delicious in itself, but I did not care for the base sauce and onions.

The cocktails were delicious and flowing and our view of the lake show was a perfect added bonus.  Not to mention they offer a vegan menu and the items ordered were incredible.  

For the 3 Star part. When we initially made our resos over the phone, the Lakeside employee informed us there was a dress code...collar shirts and no open toe shoes.  We packed our dining clothes accordingly but called back 2 days later to confirm the open toe shoes for women and the 2nd Lakeside employee said the open toe shoes only applied to men, not women and added men could not wear shorts either. Men had to wear long pants and collar shirts. As we were dining, we all clearly witnessed other guests (men) dining in shorts and T-shirts. We kept noticing throughout our meal men not dressing to the ""dress code"" and still able to enjoy a meal. Clearly they were not turned away at the door and that upset the men with us bc where we were seated in the restaurant, the men were sweating. The a/c was being sucked right out the sliding doors and they were wearing jeans and slacks with collar shirts, occasionally wiping the sweat off their foreheads.

I ordered the identical 2011 bottle of Spanish red ($86) that I previously enjoyed at a different restaurant the night before. They inadvertently brought the 2013 (which was noticeably inferior). After a few sips, I called the waiter over and said I thought the wine list said 2011 not 2013. He checked and said they gave us the wrong bottle and can collect the wine, dispose of it and give us the 2011. I didn't want them to just throw it away an acceptable but clearly inferior year, so I kept the 2013 and ordered a 2011 when that was finished. In retrospect, I thought they could have comped the wine and given us another bottle (which I subsequently ordered and paid for). As the evening progressed,  I called the sommelier over and asked for them to comp the bottle; but he said their ""policy"" didn't permit it. Apparently Vegas has policies! He said they would refill the bottle and return it to the vendor for credit. First they said they would throw it away and then they later said they would return it for credit - a bit unethical, wouldn't you say - or is that their policy as well. The bill was $1200 so an $86 bottle it should have been no biggie to comp when the bottle retails for $23. For a classy upscale restaurant, they didn't show a lot of class.

So why Lakeside?  One word:  lobsters.

Lobster lovers, this might be one of the few opportunities to try four of the worlds best cold water varieties side by side.  Grab a friend.  This tasting is four mains, over four pounds, and a $450 price (don't gasp, you know you paid more for other ""services"" in Vegas)

Simply roasted in a wood burning oven and served with drawn butter.  Light smoke permeates the dense tail meat, enhancing its flavor while maintaining its juiciness.  Pronounced flavor differences make for a mind blowing tasting.  My notes:

1. Maine - Classic.  Clean flavor with a hint of celery.  Well balanced sweetness.  Firm texture.

2. West Australian - Incredibly sweet.  Citrus and cucumber back flavor.  Not as firm as the others but far from soft, pasty texture of warm water lobsters.

3. South Australian - A powerhouse.  Complex sweetness mixed with a subtle hint of fresh seaweed and iodine (Hawaii yeeps, think ogo).

4. South African - A blank canvas.  Enhanced by anything on it (ie herb citrus butter).  Firm texture.

Deserving of mention, the grilled octopus with white bean salad, sherry vinegar, and roasted garlic aioli starter is a party in your mouth with its charred bitterness on the octopus, sweet and sour of the vinegar, heat from the garlic and a creamy, richness from the aioli.  

The decor is modern and not for everyone.  Request an outdoor table.

Service is good with the only distraction from obnoxious diners taking calls on their mobiles.

Wine by the glass is surprisingly reasonable, though their bottle start a little high.  They have an interesting bottled beer list, as well as some number of ""normal"" choices for those so inclined.

The bread basket was very good.

We ordered the octopus app - correctly cooked, though a relatively small serving with some salt bombs.  The foie appetizer arrived nicely seared, though the biscuit it was served with was both a little large for the portion and somewhat dry.  The appetizer assortment was nicely plated, though it took a while to show up, and contained some cool squid on sticks, pieces of wagyu, whole shrimp, little bowls of scallop, four rather strongly fishy siu mai and a small serving of tuna tartare with what appeared to be trout roe.

A shrimp entree in tomato sauce contained four large, if slightly over-firm shrimp.  The scallop entree likewise had four large scallops, but was overly salty.  Salmon arrived nicely moist for being ordered medium-well, on a shallow bed of rice, and the Blackened Swordfish was a generous portion.

They offer a ""Dessert Cart"" where you can choose from some number of options, though the cart itself appears to be more theoretical than actual.  At $18 for three small items to share, it was a better value than many other things on the menu.

One of the things we loved the most about Lakeside is they serve warm pretzel bread and herb butter with the meal which we both agreed made this place really special. We ordered the wahoo fish blackened for our entrees and it was delicious. 

My wife ordered a sangria. She said it was the best sangria she had ever tasted. I took a sip and agreed it was awesome. It had apples in it which was something I hadn't seen before.

For dessert we shared the Godiva brownie mouse cake. It was so light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness that we didn't want it to end. The coffee was also excelllent. They also presented us with two mini red velvet cupcakes and ""Happy Anniversary"" written in dark chocolate. A beautiful gesture and delicious as well. 

One of the things that makes this restaurant magical is that it sits on the lake at the Wynn with beautiful music playing in the backround. There also three different mini shows on the lake every half hour which feature holographic images and cool music, So you are getting a bit of a show with your dinner as well. The whole night was just spectacular for both of us. It's not cheap but when you want to celebrate a special event like a 25 year anniversary this place should be on the top of your list if you like seafood.",CJrEq1Y8dPPPJLXARb3Wfg,0,0,5,TPh6WCyT_Rf-13OgqAV7Iw

Let me start off by saying that I believe restaurants on the Las Vegas strip are often very overrated. Hear me out. My theory: People are in Vegas to party and have a good time. They often eat at these places while they're having a great time regardless of the quality of the food or restaurant. When they go to write a yelp review, they assume that the high price tag and the fun evening must mean that the restaurant was great. 

Lakeside is the epitome of this phenomenon. Bland overpriced fish is masked by the conveniently distracting singing frog light show in the lake overlooked by the patio. Sure, it is a fun experience and everyone is having a good time. But the bottom line: the food isn't good.

I had the mahi mahi, prepared with citrus and olive oil, and it was just bland. I know, I know, I picked the most bland preparation. But the fish itself was nothing special. The favorite part of my meal was the pretzel breadsticks.",C4X1lb__3XIdNfl_SNYBSw,1,0,2,FKQFsbsJYwBcUEtyBYabtg

She finally saw me say this is ridiculous, and asked them to quiet down. By this time I was fuming. Our food came during this 30 min fiasco, was not enjoyable by any means. The server was embarrassed, I told the manager she let it go on WAY too long. Our check comes- 245.00, didn't offer desert, or anything!

The bf and I were fortunate to get dinner reservations at this upscale restaurant the day before our visit, a Sunday at 8PM.  Outdoor seating by the Lake of Dreams with its huge curtain waterfall (which is where the one-minute light/water show plays every half hour) was booked so we ended up inside. The interior of the restaurant was dimly lit and of amber, gold, red and white modern retro decor.  The atmosphere inside was relaxed and quiet enough for conversation.  Every seat inside the restaurant had a view of the outdoor waterfall through the huge window so even if you are seated inside, you can see parts of the show.

The menu housed a wide selection of mainly seafood and meat options.  A separate vegetarian menu which had a wonderful variety of options was available upon request. 

From the vegetarian menu, we ordered the roasted mushrooms, the crab cakes, the Beef Wellington and carrot cake. From the regular menu, we ordered the Market Salad, Scottish Salmon paired with Grgich Hills, Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  Before our meal arrived, 2 small bread baskets were delivered to our table- one with a regular variety of bread with regular butter and the other with vegan bread and vegan butter.   Our ordered food arrived in a timely manner and everything was artistically plated and absolutely delicious.  The carrot cake was especially amazing for being vegan.  

Our charming waiter, Chas, was professional, very  well versed in the menu, patient, friendly and attentive.  Other staff was great, too!

Restrooms matched the decor of the restaurant and were clean and functional. 

The outdoor 1 minute shows were fun and entertaining and were different each time.

Dress code was business casual.

Risotto dish was quite dry, my mother regrets not telling them at the time.
Scallops and jumbo shrimp was really tasty.

5342220,2012-06-26,1,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"So, part 2 of my conference stint in Vegas. After Bradley Ogden -that somber cave- we ate on the next night, Sunday at 8 pm, at the Lakeside Grill in the Wynn. A completely different atmosphere. The space was occupied by Daniel Bouloud last time I was in Vegas. A prime spot in a luxurious hotel. Bouloud is obviously gone (mmmm, wonder why?) and now it is the Lake Side Grill. The restaurant was half empty that evening like Ogden, and we still did not order any alcohol, but we immediately got taken care of. And courteously so. The decor in the restaurant is refreshingly perky (orange and white) in that "" tasteful over the top "" Vegas oxymoronic way ( Vegas can be so quaint, ah ah!). A note on the ladies' bathroom: what an amazing cocoon, lovely and precious, with just enough glitter to make a lady feel grand.

The hostess placed us at a fabulous table on the terrace overlooking the man-made ""lake"" and its ""waterfall"": a luxury we keenly enjoyed. The service was friendly and at the same time very professional, sprinkled with discreet touches of personalized care ( I requested an ingredient should be taken out of the quinoa dish and another added, and both wishes were granted to me after consultation with the chef. Yeah, power, baby! The exchange felt mature and not phony.) My co-worker and I shared a fois gras appetizer that was just scrumptious (don't hate us) . His main course grilled chicken was juicy and plump. My quinoa was tasty. On the dessert menu, lo and behold, we spotted a Strawberry Napoleon, like at Ogden's, so we ordered it to compare; I don't know if it was the atmosphere, or the decor, or the great service, but it tasted fresher and more flavorful than the Bradley O. one. Atmosphere, baby, is everything.

We ended up spending 2 leisurely hours on that terrace, basking in the peace of the ""lake"" landscape placed in front of us by the Wynn architects' s crazed imagination.
Every half hour, I think, some electronic 3-minute show pops up to animate the waters for the diners' enjoyment. Some of it was silly but inoffensive, and some of it unexpectedly touching, like a Pixar cartoon. Nor here nor there: it was a full experience, and a very pleasant one.

And I loved -LOVED- being de facto outdoors on that terrace, enjoying the night's natural desert heat. When are Vegas' powers going to learn that there is nothing pleasant about being stuck in a dark corner of a freezing casino eating under fluorescent lights, when sunshine beckons all around?",shxRU0OPiIHV57Yc-hIjow,2,1,5,Vf8mXI98vGEOGqNzlvpX-g

Large pieces of crab meat tossed in a light creamy dressing and served with avocado and plantain chips. I was in heaven. I could have done without the calamari. It was beautiful to look at, but the batter went soggy too quickly. 

The drinks are really what brings Lakeside down. The apple sour was one of the worst drinks I have ever tried. The Sinatra Smash was much better. At this point in the night, I was done.

Lobster - decent. Didn't try any of the 3 butters since I prefer only lemon on my lobster.

I had the arugula salad on both visits as my first course. I have a thing for arugula, it is my favorite type of green and the way they prepare it with lemony dressing is just fantastic!
I also tried the crab cake as a main course on visit number 1 and the fried Gardein vegan chick'n with corn sauce the 2nd time. Both were really good. I asked for extra sauce both time. I loved the sauces!
The second visit we were there with 2 friends who also loved their food. They all tried my vegan chicken, loved it and said they could have been fooled if not told... Well done lakeside!

Another station was an omelette station where you also already had prepared scrambled eggs, chicken apple sausage, bacon, and more. The egg white omelette they made for me was outstanding. The next station had a lot of different cuts of meat and different choices of warm food. Another station featured a large boat full of seafood. The king crab legs were massive and delicious. The shrimp was huge but I cannot say that I was crazy about it. It had ceviche and oysters and all kinds of different seafood. The dessert station was very nice. There was a carrot cake and a dark rich chocolate cake, little pecan pies as well as little strawberry rhubarb pies and blueberry pies.

The coffee was very good and included. We were there for about two hours and all of it was absolutely delicious.
Service was lovely and we had great people helping us. We sat outside which was absolutely gorgeous.
We would easily come out here again and absolutely loved it. The reason for four stars is because I felt that the dessert bar was somewhat limited.

The service from the moment you walk in the door is stellar.

We have never had to wait for a table when making a reservation.

Now the food is ""off the hook"" amazing seafood.  Although my steak last night was hard to beat!

5565155,2013-05-26,1,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"My husband and I went here last night for dinner and I booked the restaurant ONLY because it had outdoor seating by the Wynn lake. I made the reservations on OpenTable over a week beforehand. When we got there we were told that an outside seat would be an hour wait...immediately I was annoyed because this is the reason I made reservations ahead of time and I requested a seat outside. I've worked in the restaurant business...if you can't guarantee outdoor seating then make a note of that on reservations sites etc. OR don't overbook your patio. If wait had been 15-30 minutes I would have been understanding and had gone to the bar to wait...but an hour wait is ridiculous...poor planning in my opinion.

Dinner was pretty good. My husband and I ordered a bottle of wine and got a dozen oysters to start. Usually at restaurants they will explain where the oysters are from etc. at a seafood restaurant I would expect that an more...nope...nothing. If I'm paying $40 for oysters I'd like to know a little bit about them and since I noticed we got 2 different kinds it would have been nice to have know the difference between the two. I guess I'll ask next time.

Next, my husband and I ordered the specialty...whole lobster from their 4 different choices offered. They bring live lobsters to your table beforehand and explain where each one is from and the price per pound. My husband got the Scottish Blue ($160ish total for 2.5lbs) and I went with the classic Maine ($100 2.5lbs). We opted for the chili rub. Food arrived beautifully prepared. Butter came on a warming dish but flame underneath was not lit...so butter got cold quickly. 

My husband's lobster was perfect but mine had a little surprise waiting. I started with the tail and once I started cutting into it there was a massive amount of slimey black/dark green ooze coated on the inside of the tail. The lighting was dim so I kind of ate the parts that weren't covered and finished off the claw meat. I then asked the server what the black/green slime was and he said it was ""roe"" meaning lobster eggs. My lobster was pregnant. He told me I was lucky that I got a lobster with roe...however, it's not what I ordered and was expecting...plus it's slimey and not pretty to look at and there was so much it made it so unappetizing. The server also said one time they had a live lobster that they picked up that had been oozing roe just before cooking. He explained that it was apparently illegal for it to be sold in that condition...I'm assuming for ecological reasons but then why would you still serve that? He also said I got a lot of it...

I was looking forward to dessert after dinner but because my lobster was not appealing at all I lost my appetite. I'm a huge fan of cavier but because lobster roe is slimey and black and there were huge gobs of it...it was not something I found to be a delicacy and I did not feel ""lucky"" at all.  I didn't have the heart to tell them I didn't like it because I ate the claw meat and as much of the tail as I could muster despite some chewiness. My husband looked up online regarding the situation and found different reviews regarding lobster roe being a delicacy and other reviews explained that usually the lobster should not be served if roe is found inside. 

I felt really disappointed with our $500 meal. Won't be going back. If you get lobster with roe make sure you put all your money on black then...you're lucky I guess...",hA6EJqv_ArMpwzNN0dFlGw,0,0,3,lgyOfXE5WditummY8LfPcA

So tempted to give lakeside 4 stars due to spectacle of light show and animatronics on display from outdoor seating. My friend saw Mr. Wynn dining in the restaurant the night before my meal. Lakeside is an experience but I am too starstruck by all the celebrity chefs starting restaurants (even if they never visit their Las Vegas creations) and therefor  I find it hard to recommend that you spend one of your few meals at lake side.

Both pastas were so mediocre.  Olive Garden has better food than this.  All of these dishes were around $35.  Originally planning on going to SW, we knew we would be paying out of our noses for dinner, so paying $35 for pasta wasn't that big of a deal.  However, $35 for crappy, half-ass food is a crime.

*Black Truffle Arancini -  Delicious and they went fast

*Whipped garlic feta cheese with mushrooms and bread - Could have skipped it

Shellfish Platters - made up of the largest shrimp I have ever seen, lobster tails, oysters and Alaskan king crab legs.  These were awesome.  everything tasted fresh and great.  Nice portion for everyone at our table

Salad Course was good, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peppers, manchego 

King Crab Risotto -  This dish was very rich and very tasty.  the risotto was perfectly cooked.

Our entrees consisted of 
Dover Sole - my guests who ordered this said it was OK and wished they got something else.  It was not prepared properly

Filet and Lobster tail -  the filet was perfectly cooked as were the lobster tales but the tales were tiny.  I mean baby lobster tiny.  Still very good though. 

Bone in NY Strip - The steak itself was very good, however, our guests did not get a choice on temperature.  So most were very rare.  I know that this is typical for most large parties but still..

After this unpleasant beginning, we found the crab shell in our avocado appetizer and another shell in my lobster risotto!
At this point, i was totally disappointed. For over $400 bill, I would expect better experience!!",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,4,3,2,6pC7EDpo1JeqtmE-FqIhXQ

The server offered to take care of the situation; but we declined.  My wife had a different fish and enjoyed her meal, which was prepared to her liking. 

We have been staying at the Wynn/Encore hotel for many years, and have always enjoyed their restaurants. This was our first time dining at Lakeside.  The previous two nights we dined at SW Steakhouse and Andrea's; and had a 5 Star experience at both restaurants.",VbXFUEw_JNx2bUMwx3gfSA,0,0,3,vtN79lEbRlQd_H_XA1ylZg
5887092,2014-05-12,1,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"Went to Lakeside for Mother's Day dinner - just my spouse and myself.  We had a reservation, were greeted promptly and taken to our table.  When I mentioned that it was a little cold outside the hostess asked if I would like a wrap.  I said yes and she returned immediately. 
That is where the great service ended.
We waited over 5 minutes for a someone to come and take our drink order, during that time we were not even offered water.  Once our drinks arrived we did order our dinner but had to wait to do that as well.
The soap was OK and my husband enjoyed his salad.  
Apparently this restaurant is known for it's seafood.  Guess mine missed the boat.  My fish was dry and tasteless.  
My husband did enjoy his steak - image that a good steak at a seafood restaurant.  When the waiter came to clear our table he asked my how mine was and I said that it was actually very dry.  His comment can I bring you something else?  Don't you think that if during our meal he had of stopped by it would have been more appropriate and I could of told him at that point and he could of fixed it then?  I said no thank you we need to be leaving and to that he returned with our bill - no discount, no nothing. 
Summary, nice hostess, poor poor food, poor service, nice atmosphere but I don't go to a restaurant that charges what it did for poor service, poor food and nice atmosphere.  I would prefer great service, great food and OK atmosphere.  Won't be returning there.",K6SwU-RKlxh_n1Sp_Rw77g,1,0,2,T07a5JZEiR-ZYxFvhL9Z1Q

5897765,2016-10-30,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"I eat a different restaurant every Saturday including a high-end restaurant at least monthly. My meal started with the crab bisque. It was horrible and I took a few bites and passed it to my date who said it was fine. To  me, it tasted like it had undercooked flour in it with poor flavor. Next, I had the chili rubbed ribeye and crab. The strip of crab was steamed perfectly and I loved it. I ate 1/4 of my steak and could not finish. The chili rub was horrible. There was mild heat (from the chili, which was nice) but the seasoning was bland and lifeless. However, it was a great cut of meat and was cooked to perfection (medium rare). I took it home and will season it and enjoy it for breakfast. The Yukon whipped potatoes with lobster were disappointing and tasted like they were made with water instead of cream or milk (this may be wrong because I did not ask but the taste lacked the richness that milk or cream provide). The mushrooms were amazing and perfect. The chicken (sampled from my date's plate) was very good. A spinach porcini cannelloni accompanied it, which was horrible. Again, it tasted like it had undercooked flour in it and lacked any real flavor. My date did not eat it, which shocked me because he eats everything! In two years of dating, this was a first. 

I love the view and the ambiance was great even from the booth at the back of the restaurant. The service was slower than we would like but still within an acceptable period. If I did not dine out as much as I do, I might not have found this to be an issue but for a high-end restaurant, they need to step up the service.",iBeLu__Fr2S0SaKyTvMVrg,0,0,2,pMejyREHIqFwFGbdYfr9JQ
5904089,2012-03-15,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"Unfortunately I was under the weather when I dined here last month.  I only had their oyster's Rockefeller, lobster bisque. and Cesar salad.  My other dinner mates ordered from filet Mignon to lobster risotto.  Their dishes looked very nicely presented but there was a mix of reviews from the tables as some plates were devoured and others weren't.  We all shared the oysters for the appetizers and it was okay.  Nothing special.  My lobster bisque wasn't spectacular either.   Cesar salad was plain as well.  Not sure if my taste buds were off cause I was sick or the food just failed to impress me.  But non the less, I kind of expected more from such a pricey establishment.

We had patio seating, so we were able to see the little water show that would play every 15 minutes or so.  Very cute. 

Service was great, but for the amount we paid for the dinner, it would have been nice to have a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday people then just a tiny lemon cupcake.  I don't think I will be back, but hey, it was worth a try.",oikXg4SUWH0ERfL_E6shhQ,0,0,3,fKcJZ58xIob_wAzOYus39g
5932142,2011-08-29,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"We stayed at the Wynn were going to see Le Reve later so we decided to dine at the Wynn too. After looking through all the restaurants that the hotel had to offere we chose Lakeside for the view and the more affordable prices. Yikes were we wrong! Our dinner ending up being over $200 and it wasn't even that good. Portions are small and over priced for what they are. They gave us bread and butter at the table and we ordered the crabcakes as appetizer and it was good. I also ordered one of the specials that was not on the menu - crab, guacamole, and corn salad...what I got was more like a chip and dip so I don't know why they would call that a salad AND it was $22! For drinks we ordered two glasses of red and entrees were a rib eye steak, seared foie gras, corn succotash, and scallops. The seared fois gras was the size of half your palm, was $22, and not that great. The rib eye was a little bit too rare but was probably the best thing we ordered. It had a nice seared crust and the steak came with a sweet tomato salsa that was pretty good. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the puree that it came with I could have done without. Four scallops for $39. Thomas our waiter was very nice and I had made a reservation with comments saying we were celebrating our anniversary so when we declined dessert he insisted that he bring us something from the kitchen to celebrate. Two mini red velvet cupcakes with happy anniversary chocolate on top. We had originally requested seating outside next to the lake and waterfall and when we checked in the host asked if we still wanted outside because it was rather warm and suggested that we test the weather outside before making our decision, that was nice. Service was good, food was mediocre, prices were high.",YNOFyIbm3YI9Vcr9I_1Hpw,0,0,2,a93MMY1xzULChvhEojSghw

My guy and I ordered both steaks. He ordered filet mignon and I ordered new york strip and had mashed garlic potato on the side. Then we ordered 3 mini desserts which were the nutella profiletos??, amaretto cheesecake and vanilla mango mouse. with our food we ordered a glass of malbec and cabernet sauvignon. Even though what we all ordered were all pricey. you can get your moneys worth because the food is just delish and wine selections were great. 

Amazing server. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and recommended what good wine goes with our steaks. She gives you good personal service and very attentive to the guest.

5936286,2011-05-26,0,oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw,"I was looking forward to a good steak dinner. Unfortunately I chose this restaurant. 

 The ambiance was very bright and loud with Chris Isaac music playing loud enough to make talking difficult. At the tables around us people were constantly on their cell phones. There was a ""show"" put on every 30 minutes that consisted of two beach balls falling in love and having a child beach ball. And then there was a music video of a woman riding a snake. This was very different then the last restaurant that was here, Daniel Bouloud, that was a great place. 

The food was not worth the $300 price for two people. I started with a Mac and Cheese appetizer with crab and asparagus. This was the best of the dinner. I then had the ""rib chop"" which was a ribeye steak. I ordered it medium it started out ok but about an inch into it it got rarer and rarer. And it was tough. The wine list was impressive but expensive. We had a $72 bottle of Chilean wine which was the cheapest on the list and fortunately very good. 

Service was ok but no one came to our table to ask how we were enjoying the meal. Maybe they already knew the answer. Our waiter didn't know anything about the wine list but he called over the   sommelier who was able to answer my question. 

All in all go somewhere else. This is way to expensive for this kind of experience. I wonder if Mr Wynn has eaten here.",lIGxqJRxBOEvX8rNfLrwTw,0,0,2,3TEN7Nsar2Dex1jaiYg3lg

Let me start off by saying the computer systems were down when we arrived so we were lucky enough to have one of the gentleman managers helping out our server. Sterling insisted on taking our cocktail orders and gave a full breakdown of their menu. Lakeside (as well as all the other Wynn properties) offers an exquisite menu for vegan guests (I am pretty sure you have to request the separate  menu). Not only do they offer a variety of options but they even brought separate bread and butter options for the one vegan in our party. As most vegans know the options at most restaurants are very limited, but the Wynn is taking Vegan life to an entire new level!! I am no longer vegan, and opted for some of the fish dishes, but the highlight of our dinner was the Vegan Beef Wellington!  The puff pastry on this thing was cooked to perfection and the gravy was salty and delicious.

Yes, I do expect great things from the Wynn, but Lakeside exceeded our expectations. Thank you to Sterling and his staff for allowing us to have such a wonderful dinner!!! Can't wait to go back for that Beef Wellington!!!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,2,3,5,z7fppqi5Sf76ab1V7PptPw
