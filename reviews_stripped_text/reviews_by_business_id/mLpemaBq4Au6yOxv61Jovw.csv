Did the Southwest bowl and fab and fruity smoothie. Delicious.",YL6HiztW8cnlldJC2jaAnQ,0,0,5,pCnQk8kygBLj93axULXfUQ

Not to mention I just happened to go on national smoothie day so they gave me half off! Definitely try this place out!,s1x3NmrnTcjhw5s20b5tew,0,0,5,X5RI6kvc_R39Mn2agMuidw

3684563,2018-06-16,0,mLpemaBq4Au6yOxv61Jovw,Staff was really nice and generous. Never been there before and they welcomed me with open arms. They gave me information about their menu and their choices. Gave me a free coupon to bring a friend for a free bowl which was delicious. I had to French quarter bowl.  A little zesty but good. I recommend this place if you want to eat clean.,i7FmWeaHiD8BrhgvyIvJBA,1,1,5,hu3DXlTkxqyHUH2LXnaZ9g

We grabbed 2 smoothies after the gym and were greeted by some lovely guys behind the counter who were friendly and knowledgeable!
I was a little confused as I'd checked the menu before arriving but couldn't find it on the board when I got there. Turns out it was on the smaller children's menu, but that didn't stop them from offering to make it in a larger form for me, which I was really pleased and impressed with! As a new company who's establishing themselves in an already founded industry of health foods, it's things like great service, going above expectation and delivering excellent product that will keep people returning and rating highly. I will definitely be doing both those things!",Xsyw11gZiltqWL5RvWGKJg,0,0,5,0SIHBE1UXpoGAxMFThNEfA
4008301,2018-06-23,0,mLpemaBq4Au6yOxv61Jovw,"If Greens and Proteins and Chipotle had a baby, it would be Grabbabean - served Chipotle style but with healthy bowl and wrap offerings and smoothies and fresh-pressed juices! 

They have pre-set signature bowls to choose from, including breakfast and açaí, or you can customize with a grab your own bowl, which is what I did. I went with spinach but I love their different grain offerings of quinoa, brown rice and even quinoa noodles! I topped my bowl with the miso ginger sauce and it is delicious! 

I tried the Power juice and while it was a bit on the lemony side, it was still tasty and so refreshing as I gulped it down on this 100+ degree day after a good workout.

There's still so much more on the menu I need to try like their smoothies, soup, açaí bowls and cold brew. They even have a few items on the menu for the kiddos so they can eat healthy too! 

They have only been open about two weeks so there were minor hiccups with preparing my order correctly and working the front counter, but that's to be expected and it'll be worked out in time. The owner and staff were all very nice and smiley and I'll definitely be back based on their friendly service and great food and juice offerings. 

Located inside the Village Square shopping center next to Jollibee, Grabbagreen is a cool new place for healthy eating! Want to eat clean? Then get to Grabbabean!",0qqbT4_eMwWYHB126Fk6XQ,0,0,5,TacyGR3XTEyabUax4iQzXA

The super brew is truly worth trying as well! Additionally, the staff is incredibly friendly and the location is super clean. The menu is an awesome value given the freshness of the food and the healthy, diverse ingredients. Definitely give it a visit. You won't regret it and it will likely become one of your favorite stops!!!",0D2fGwPWni0D4P3orwKn1Q,0,0,5,AfmSZXXpPLvqPJ_W5vxZeg
