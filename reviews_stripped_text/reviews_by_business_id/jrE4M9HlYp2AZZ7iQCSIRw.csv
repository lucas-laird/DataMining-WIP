We ordered dim sum and regular menu items and it was hands down the worst Chinese food I have ever had in my whole life...and no I'm not being melodramatic. The dim sum was rubbery and had a gelatinous layer covering it and nothing we ate had any seasoning in it. We ordered the fish fillet and my husband bit into something hard that can only be described as rock-like. To top off the disappointing meal, the service was horrible because we had to ask multiple times for everything from our waters to a clean spoon. At the end of our disastrous meal we got handed a $90 bill for food that we didn't even really eat. I begrudgingly paid the $90 and chose not to leave a tip because of the lackluster service and the fact that the manager/owner completely ignored our comments about the quality of food, and after all of that the waitress had the nerve to ask me where her tip was.

When we arrived we were greeted and seated,  there were just a few people working we were offered several types of appetizers, we only accepted the dim sum, after about 10 minutes we asked for menus because they didn't hand them to us, a lady took our order; we ordered half a roast duck & steamed rice, as we waited the little carts kept rolling, and rolling, we ate our dim sum and waited for the duck, 45 minutes later we began to feel anxious, we didn't receive a "" it'll be here soon"" or "" we apologize for the wait"" NOTHING.. I say let's wait until the hour, we'll ask what's going on, so we did! After that one lady came near and asked if we were ready to place our order?! We said we already did and showed her the copy of the order & she said oh we're not serving duck at this time... ?!?! We were very upset, the lady who took the order in the first place should have said that to begin with, there was no communication between the employees, they didn't even apologize instead they handed us a check for the drinks and the dim sum.

There were a lot of people that came all at once to the restaurant and for some reason they were able to get their food quick as hell, while my family waited patiently an hour for our food. 

Moreover the waiters did not check up on our tables like they did with others. I felt as if I was constantly ignored. 

Food was alright. Customer service-  lets me honest - was horrific! They barely had any common customer courtesy. 

If you're a tourist finding some food around China Town, #1 rule - and I mean it - don't go to this place! You'll be waiting until the sun goes down for your food! Go somewhere else and get some pho. There's better restaurants out there than this piece of crap.

It must be because the place is not that packed. Our servers were fast to request for water refills, etc - place overall decently clean/presentable. The man who initially took our order actually came back towards the end to ask if everything wz ok ... that never happened before in any of our previous visits.

162006,2011-09-30,0,jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw,"Ive been coming here for years and this place is alright.
Not the best I have ever eaten but not the worst either.

I usually come here late at night or in the morning/early afternoon.
Late night I usually order a fried rice.  Either the Yang Chow, BBQ pork or the salty fish and chicken fried rice.
I also usually get an entree like fish with black bean sauce, fried pork chop with salt and pepper, fish with spicy salt and pepper or a soup like the won ton or the hot and sour soup.
All the above dishes are pretty decent flavor wise.
Good enough for 3am as far as im concerned.

The other times I goto this place are in the early afternoon for dim sum.
Last time I went for dim sum they had the carts rollin around as usual.
I have never had to fill out any type of paperwork to eat dim sum at this place.
The dim sum is decent.
I usually get sesame balls, pork bun, shumai, harcow, and chicken feet.
All pretty standard in terms of flavor.
Nothing really stands out or lets me down.

The service not bad at all.
I have been eating at Chinese food joints for over 30 years from Hong Kong to Thailand to San Francisco to New York to Jakarta....you get the idea.
All that ""Asian folks are so well mannered and polite"" is some stereotype junk.
These cats wanna know what you want to eat and drink and thats it.
Dont expect any type of convo/banter especially if you dont speak the same language.

Lots of folks mistake cultural differences for bad attitudes.
Dont get it twisted folks.
We all have bad days and good days.
Maybe I got it all wrong but then again im not an over sensitive attention monster.

Food: B - Step up your food game guys, dont get complacent.
Service: B - Train your employees to handle problems better.
Cleanliness: C - You really need to do a complete cleaning of the store
Overall: B-/C+ - I will continue to eat here just wish they would improve.

This place aint as bad as people are saying.
All the basics for a great Chinese restaurant are there.
Management just needs to remember that they have to try and improve every single day...",oZCNoohYSfVlDEz4f4evaQ,0,0,3,iqi4fsBUBaTemranrEcGLw

Everything else: 0 out of 5 stars.

The food was good. The service was horrendous. We had made a reservation for 20 people after my cousin's wedding, they only sat down 1/3 of us and gave other tables to other people. Once my group finally sat down 20 minutes later, my table of 9 waited 20 minutes to put in our order (we couldn't catch the waitress because she kept running around and wouldn't listen to us) and then we waited 1 hour to get our food. We were so hungry, we finished our 6 plates of food in 15 minutes. What a lame way to spend our post-wedding dinner! So sad haha.
The busser was more on top of it than our waitress. 6 out of 9 spoons we were given had visible food stains--when we asked out waitress for new ones, she seemed confused and in disbelief. Everyone else around us got their food well before us, even though they sat down after us. When we asked our waitress where our food was and if we could talk to a manager, she shook her head and mumbled something and ran away from our table.

 I will beat you, however, if you order the honey walnut shrimp.  Picture Long John Silver's fried shrimp topped with room-temperature, Kroger mayonnaise.  Yep, that's their ""famous"" honey walnut shrimp! I'm still hunting down the person that recommended it to me.  

Also, be warned that their waitstaff may or may not mistreat you.  I personally enjoy rude Chinese restaurant waitstaff but you may not.  They get three stars  simply because their staff are extra grumpy.  Really, I love brusque waiters.

I've been here in the late hours to eat peking duck which wasn't bad, but wasn't great.   

Then I decided to bring a party of 17 to this restaurant for dim sum on Sunday and made reservations.   

I was asked why I chose this place as everyone was disappointed that the food was not that great.   

It's hard to explain, but it's just hmm...

Service was good.   But the food just didn't seem up to par.   Was it bad?   Not really... but it wasn't good.   

The place we used to go to on decataur which tends to change ownership or names every time we visit (yearly or longer) that I thought I would check this out.   

The other place had poor selection of dim sum vs. this place, but the food was tastier, hot, etc.   Here is was just... average.

So I hope the rating drops below the 4 stars because this is not above average and while I would go there again... I must protest their dim sum is not the best and what's funny is that the elders I brought would have rather gone to the restaurant with less selection and packed.

I rather enjoyed not having to fight to get food, but oh well... relaying the message of the party of 17 so that Yelp gives a better or accurate score.

I asked him if they had the cakes, he walked over to a nearby cart and held up the asked for cakes.  I nodded and said I would like two orders.  He went to a little side table to box them and came back with them in a bag.  He said the charge was $5. Which I paid in cash.
At home I opened the styrofoam container to find two 5x5 inch squares about 1/2 inch thick.  That was 2 orders for $5!  They were just okay, taste wise...

They served dim sum and other Chinese dishes.  Dim sum looked ok on average, while some of them looked somebody like vomited on it.  The taste was mind blowing in a negative way.  Some of them tasted like cardboard, while some just tasted bitter, and choices seem very limited.  The regular dishes had a unique bland flavor and gooey look to it, which was not appetizing at all.

Service was terrible here!  We called out for to the staffs a few times with no response and finally had to make some loud noise to get their attention, which really reminded me of mainland China.

I remember how dirty the place felt with the tacky decor, should have been a sign to run. Second issue the host had attitude to seat us in a booth with two children said no children allowed in booth. Didn't wanna hassle finding another place though because kids were hungry.
We ordered walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, salt n pepper pork chop and fried rice.
About thirty minutes later I ask a guy where our food was. He said what food!? So I say never mind we are leaving. The original lady who took our order saw we were trying to leave started shouting ""why u leave no pay, food coming u need to wait"" [sic] 5 min later they proceeded to bring out food, they brought out fried shrimp, soup and Chinese broccoli. I said we didn't order this. She argued yes you did. By now I'm so livid I didn't wanna make a scene so I asked my husband to deal with them before I explode. So I go to the car. 20 minutes later he is walking to the car with the food we didn't order and I guess our order then I see the lady chasing him and saying no tip for me not even one dollar!! OMG are you serious?????!!!!!! She had the audacity to literary follow him outside and say this in the parking lot! Of course no tip, not after the absolute worst service ever !! That I thought was the worst part. My husband gets in the car to tell me the check was $83 meaning they charged us for the food we did not order!!!!!!!!!!!!

We love our Chinese Broccoli....seriously love it too! They have a very homestyle flavor to their food here. Not that I know what homestyle Chinese food tastes like so much as the food has a really basic flavor to it here. It doesn't really stand out. Some of the dumplings reminded me of Mexican style chicken soup flavor. Not that that is bad really, but still I am used to better tasting dim sum. Service is not bad. They kept on asking if we wanted tea refills which s really good for this kind of place - especially when it's busy.

Prices for the dinner menu are on the high side, but that seems par for the course for LV chinese food. You won't find those family meal deals available at 99% of the California chinese dives.

Let's start off with how the hostess skipped our number. Our number is 83. She called 82 and suddenly jumped to 87 and 85 went to complain. So she gave 85 and 87 a table and then when we asked she claims she already called us.... so because of her mistake, she stuck us at a table in the back- a table that I don't think was meant to be a table... why do I say that? The table was not set and was never set. Server just put plates down and didn't even put a white cloth over it. I was the only awkward wooden, wobbly table... with no sauce ... I went ahead and took the sauce from table beside me... okay .. whatever. Server bought us our tea and was never seen again... except to serve the tables besides us. CART ladies... simply looks at us and turns around... they would serve the tables next to us and stop beside them.. look over at us and turns around. LOL! WUT???
We only had two dishes and it got so ridiculous I chased after them TWICE. Both times, I let them know we need food, you guys don't even come to us. One lady had the nerve to ask ""where are you sitting?"" I saw you look at our table and turned your cart around and bounced.....
Service was non existent. Like wtf. Couldn't even find a server to pay our bill. I would have LOVED to walk out and not pay. Carts rarely came around. Like are ya still serving dim sum or na?

I have to say, the dim sum was not good! It was very disappointing. I ordered siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, shrimp rice roll, glutinous rice wrapped with lotus leaf, pork bun, and this vegetarian dish. The soy sauce for the shrimp rice roll was really watered down for some reason so the rice roll tasted really bland. The chicken feet was alright but it was a little too oily for me. The siu mai and shrimp dumpling was alright too. You can't go wrong with ordering that at a dim sum place! The vegetarian dish was a little weird. They used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce and you can tell because the sauce was chunky. It was very unappetizing. 

The decor of this place is kind of runned down and old. It definitely needs some renovation, especially because it was one of the restaurants in the main plaza of Las Vegas Chinatown. They should make an effort to build a better image for themselves and for the town. 

The place was also understaffed. There was one lady taking care of 3 carts! I felt bad for her that she had to take care of all these tables and also manage her carts.

Still being guided by my rumbling stomach, I looked at nearby restaurants in Las Vegas' ""Chinatown"".  While walking around, The Love us on Yelp Sticker on Harbor Palace's door caught my eye.  I thought to myself, ""How awesome!!  Another loved yelp spot, the food here must be great!"".  Oh how I was wrong.  Immediately, when I got in there, the atmosphere was dreary, somewhat old fashioned, and a little unkempt.  I then thought, "" Well, maybe all the energy is poured into the excellent food and service, yelp will not let me down!  Again, I was completely wrong.  I started with the noodle dish and BBQed beef, and I ended with those.  I second that prior review, the noodles were both bland, dry, and greasy if you can believe that.  The BBQed beef was damn near all fat too.  I was like ""What the hell?  I didn't remember ordering a big dish of just meat fat.""  This place needs to be checked out by the restaurant sanitary inspector because it looks a little dirty.  My waitress even brought out a disgusting looking fish bucket to show the table right behind me.  What was that all about?  And to top it off, I waited nearly 20 minutes for the waitress to bring me back a doggy bag.  My bill was 20 or so dollars for some reallyyy crappy food.   I felt ripped off, let down, and regretful I even entered the door with the supposed ""They love us on Yelp"" sticker.  How did they get that sticker?  Did they steal that?

My girlfriend and I took her father here. We entered the restaurant and the host was on a personal phone call with her back to the door. We listened to her for a while, then she realized we were there and quickly hung up. We were sat at a table with a dirty table cloth under a pane of glass. 

The president was in town and Channel 8 was showing the speech. I asked if they would show the speech on one of the three TVs which were all turned off. The manager said the TVs were reserved for advertising, and turned on one of the TVs to some type of advertising channel which did not show advertisements for the restaurant (think video games and movies.) The other two were not turned on. 

The menu has approximately 200 entrees and took a while to read. The servers seemed impatient, and I do mean servers, as we had multiple servers.

We got our appetizer, and the server spilled the sauce on the table. She said, ""Oops,"" but did not clean it. The entrees were not far behind, and the same server set the first dish in the sauce she had spilled. 

The food was food, and I cannot say it wasn't. Her dad and I ordered a two person family dinner. It was greasy, bland, and surprisingly poor quality for $15 a person, but it was still food. My girlfriend's hot pot was bad. It was still food too, but she did not enjoy it. We ate until we were full, and then I used the bathroom.

Which brings me to the bathroom. The exterior door was filthy; the kind of filthy which causes you to dread entering the restroom. Think ""behind the gas station in Kingman, AZ"" dirty. Once in the men's restroom, you will find there are two urinals. The one on the left was leaking onto the floor, and the leak spread under the other urinal. This makes it impossible to use without standing in the leak. The leak runs even further under the stalls, and I imagine your pants would get wet if you had to sit on the toilet. The floor was sticky in the dry spots.

The dining room is pretty rundown and the tables and chairs looked like they had been through the ringer a couple times.  

On to the food.  The carts zipped around pretty quickly, and i was pleasantly surprised that the service was clutch.  I was seated furthest away from the carts so i had to get up every time to see what they had.  Despite that, good service i must say.  I will list the foods (some with my patented terrible description) that i liked and didn't like:

Likes:
-chicken feet - i like to eat these things, but i think it's cooler to watch other peoples' grossed-out expressions when i do eat them
-smelt - surprisingly flavorful
-spare rib - tender and tasty
-shrimp dumpling - basic but good
-the flat thing that tasted like shrimp and looked like an egg, also good

Drinking haterade:
-all egg rolls were bland and blech
-calamari just ok
-the steam rolls i had were kinda cold and blech
-other dumplings we ordered (not shrimp), take a pass

So some good and not so good things here, thus my useless 3 star rating.  I will continue my vegas dim sum search to other places, though i may come back here.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,3,3,3,kedJ50EZNaLyJ26npNJZlw

The fact that it is located in Chinatown was a little concerning since I tend to think overrated and Chinatown, but this strip on Chinatown was crazy jam packed with Asian restaurants. The decor is very typical dim sum restaurant and is also very typical Chinese service. FYI, the bathroom is not good, so if you can hold off, you should.

The food:

Churn Fun with Shrimp- The crepe was more thick noodle like but still had good flavor. It was good.

Churn Fun with Spare Ribs- Similar to the above but I was expecting the spare ribs to be more tender. The flavor was good.

Pie Kwat- This spare rib is the same as the above, good flavor but needed to be more tender.

Don Tot- I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of the egg tart, this is a must get.

Sesame Ball with Lotus Paste- I never get this but a member of my group ordering it and it was great. The outer dough had a perfect chew and the lotus paste had a nice sweetness and nice smooth consistency. Highly recommend.

Bell Pepper with Shrimp Paste- It was good but not a terribly exciting dish.

Dow Meow- or Snow Pea Leaf for $15.95. I really liked the flavor, it is pricey but this is the same price as New York but it was flavorful and tender. I would get this again. 

Pork Congee with Thousand Year Egg- It was respectable, the flavor is subtle but the pork and egg adds nice flavor.

Braised Tofu Skin- These seemed on the small side but the flavor was decent.

Shumai- This was bad, it was dry and grainy, I would totally skip this. This was the only thing that I really didn't like, everything else was good or really good.",Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA,7,8,3,j4YdCB6U52wAzYAfgUAyiQ

I've been eating dim sum for over 30 years of my life and never once have I ever been treated as rudely and as disrespectful as I was treated here. Me and my mother and my sister came here to eat one morning and we were greeted with the most rudest of attitudes. When we asked one of the servers that was pushing a cart around did she have certain things we don't serve that here in a rude and nasty tone. We asked our server for basic condiments such as hot mustard chili and she got an attitude with us. Overall to put the icing on the cake I brought it to Management's attention about the rudeness and the lack of customer service and basically got Shrugged off did not receive an apology no type of discount. So for all you out-of-towners that come looking for good dim sum I would not recommend this place at all. Going forward me and my family will take our business elsewhere since you guys do not know how to treat customers with the respect. So for all use that are reading this please never eat here or go here unless you just want rude and bad service and maybe after they read this I'll finally get an apology for the rudeness that me and my mother and my sister experience there.,nR7qSADMnAIzrEWAlUo6tA,1,0,1,bDRQywWQVgTvUeQ8j0NxEA

They have a couple of separate banquet rooms which can accommodate large groups -- hopefully you won't need one at the same time a tour bus pulls in.

On our latest trip, we had: fish fillet with black bean sauce, string beans with minced meat, shrimp w/ lobster sauce, deep fried salted & spicy squid, the house special chow mein, orange peel chicken, and eggplant w/ garlic sauce hotpot.

The good: the string beans were fresh & crisp, and the eggplant hotpot was very tasty. The Hong Kong-style chow mein was very good as well.

The bad: fried squid was unremarkable and the chicken in the orange peel chicken was tough & chewy.

The ugly: the fish fillet w/ black bean sauce & the shrimp w/ lobster sauce both had way too much brown/white onion. The shrimp w/ lobster sauce had only six shrimp, and the lobster sauce had pieces of pork, which is something I haven't seen before. The flavor for both dishes was good, but just not enough fish or shrimp in each.

Family Dinner Combinations are also available starting from $12.95 - $17.95.

Sweet and sour fried fish was done very well. Crispy fresh fishsteaks drizzled with yummy sauce. Similar taste to squirrel fish. 

General Tso chicken (my banana sister wanted this) tasted exactly like a mediocore replica of the fish dish above, except with dry chicken pieces. Disappointing.

Veggies - they ran out of the ones we wanted so we tried asking about a different type (but very popular) mushroom dish. They looked confused and did not understand, maybe from a different part of china? We did not get what we wanted, but a much slimier kind of mushroom. 

Chow Fun (seriously I dont know why my parents let her choose the menu so american) - very oily, HeFuns were pieces rather than long strands, making it difficult to eat.

3690559,2012-04-06,0,jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw,"This is a dim sum review only.  Sis and I were craving us some dim sum on Sunday morning in Las Vegas.  The hotel recommended Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant because ""many of our guests liked it"".  I'm not sure if their guests had much experience with dim sum because our meal was pretty disappointing.

Not that I've got that much experience with dim sum, but...

First of all, I love Las Vegas.  The city originally didn't have a Chinatown.  No problem!  They built a couple of strip malls on Spring Mountain Road and slapped pagoda roofs on them and asian businesses set up shop.  Now there is a proliferation of chinese, thai, korean and some japanese shops, bakeries and restaurants along Spring Mountain.  if you build it, they will come!

Harbor Palace is a large restaurant in (I think) one of the original strip malls.  The interior is very basic restaurant decor, without much in the way of fancy wall hangings or artistic pieces that you see in some Chinese restaurants.  But basic is okay and sometimes a good thing, if the food is good.  Sis and I were seated by the hostess and  served a lo mein dish (not sure if this is complimentary or not, more later).  We were being eyeballed by three cart ladies, who were standing with their dim sum carts a few feet away from our table.  After we have been sitting for a few minutes, each cart lady rolls her cart out of our area and disappears. The carts looked pretty full before they left so I don't know if they were serving other tables or reloading or what. By the time they get back to us and we've chosen our food, items are lukewarm at best.

The shiumai and the steamed wontons tasted pretty similar and everything was dry.  The steamed barbecue pork buns were okay but not hot.  There were a coiuple of other things that were fine but nothing that really stood out.  We passed on the chicken feet and porridge and ribs.  There were also other choices, such as seseme steamed buns and rice, but it didn't seem like a vast amount of choices.  We finished up quickly and got out after paying the bill which seemed reasonable but it was all in Chinese, so I'm not sure exactly what we got or whether the noodles we had were added to the bill. 

Next time we will do a little more research, instead of relying on what ""other guests"" liked .",BvG5OhbojdUF0xlCK_9NCg,0,0,2,M8XpURlC5sXYowVNiUiphQ

They have the little push carts that go around and that's a rareity to see these days in many of the new dim sum tea houses. It does help to speak the language (Cantonese or Mandarin), as the ladies on the carts will be more attentive to what you want to try or eat.

now about the food.  i would come here mostly for the steamed foods.  so the har gaw, pork shumai, cha shu baos, and the steamed rolls.  the egg custard tart was also so good.  the only fried item on the list that made it was the fried sesame balls, which we only tried the yellow bean one, cause they do offer a black bean sesame oblong as well.  the best thing was the sweet silken tofu dessert, which was spot on, and is probably the best tasting, well syrup wise, that i have had.  it was smooth, light, soft and very warm.  the syrup was just the right sweetness without being too sweet, and the ginger taste was perfect.   

cons... well where should i begin.  well the place was a bit run down, carpets need a steaming, the chairs and tables were also very run down.   neon sign not working, and the windows were pretty greasy.  

the wait staff must have been afraid of me and the wife with the boxes of chinese herbal medicines on the table, or were they just ignoring us for the first 10 minutes.  but then they came by and it was good from there.  

the fried foods were disappointing, egg rolls were soggy, no sauce with them.  fried noodles also no sauce to accompany them.  somewhat a bit greasy with the fried foods, sounds wrong but if you fry things correctly you get very light and relatively oil free foods.  think of a good tempura, which is light and not greasy at all.  enough said.  all in all just a 3 star place.  when i go back in november i'm finding the other dim sum place in las vegas.",f7pbQuon-3GbyNbzcNSQdQ,0,0,3,01hnjIB3Scor7FzJ3uLZLQ

Came here for late night dinner one night with family and friends. It was the only restaurant open in this plaza after 11pm. We were seated right away and the manager came over right away and took our order. We ordered about 6 dishes to share between 5 of us. 

The food came out really quickly, and everything tasted very authentic, a bit greasy and salty though. The dishes are medium to smaller portions compared to the normal size at chinese restaurants, and the prices are higher as well. The service was quick but absent at times.

3790966,2014-12-17,0,jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw,"The ONE star rating this place earned is for the non-smoking atmosphere.  And that's it!!

The bench seat was missing the back half (where your butt & tailbone would touch) of the padding, so the seat was lumpy and had a steep decline.  VERY UNCOMFORTABLE!!  I had to go to my car to get a blanket, roll it up lengthwise, and fill in the crevice so we could eat comfortably.  The ONLY reason why I didn't just get up & leave, which I would have done had it been with other company, was that my 73-year-old aunt wanted to eat here & out of respect, I didn't complain to her.  (I waited to do it here)  Plus she paid.

That was the first bad experience.  The second came when we were greeted at the table rather blankly by our waitress.  Maybe she was having a bad day, maybe that was her personality, whatever; still didn't make my experience any better.  Yes, my aunt has a strong accent, but the waitress couldn't figure out what exactly she wanted even after I tried to explain (I have a North American accent & spoke slowly & articulated my words).  I think my aunt got the food she wanted.

3rd bad experience:  The crab rangoon had curry in it!!  I made crab rangoon before & could have sworn it doesn't have curry in it.  The waitress looked at us through slitted eyes & said that's how they normally make it (curry was not mentioned in the menu).  So I double checked a few websites, and sure enough, NO CURRY in a traditional crab rangoon recipe!  I looked at allrecipes.com, chinesefood.about.com, and damndelicious.net.  My sister told them to take it back, that we didn't want it.  Since our aunt paid the bill, we didn't get to see it (actually forgot to check) to make sure the 2 orders of crab rangoon was taken off the bill.  I hope so.

4th bad experience:  Waited A LLLOOOONG time, each time, to get checked on and for a water refill.  This is even before the crab rangoon incident.  Can't blame it on revengeful, horrendous service.

5th bad experience:  The breaded shrimp is WAY TOO BREADED!!!  When we removed the breading, it almost tripled the size of the shrimp that was lost inside.

6th bad experience:  Price for and taste of food were at opposite ends of the spectrum!!  Guess which ends they belong?  I don't eat at McDonald's anymore, but I know McDonald's food tastes A LOT BETTER!

Needless to say, we will NOT return.  I'm noticing a few one-star reviews to my right as I write this.  I'll steer my auntie somewhere else next time we visit her.  And my sister or I will pay!  
THIS IS THE **WORST** RESTAURANT MY SISTER AND I HAVE VISITED!!!!!!!  Actually, I'll read my other posts after posting this and remove the previous statement if I see that I've experienced worse.  If you're still reading this, though, consider yourself warned.

I looked over at Sam Woos, and the placed looked like it was closed even though the open sign was lit up. So I decided the food is probably going to be better over here judging by the crowd. 

I went up the front, and waited about 5 minutes and never got acknowledged. I was just trying to get a number to get seated. A Chinese couple came up and spoke in cantonese and they were given seating numbers immediately. So I decided to interrupt and ask for a number as well. The asian lady gave me a dirty look, and the Chinese couple were nice enough to say that I was ahead of them and I deserve a number ahead of them. The asian lady refused and still gave me the later number. As I was walking away I heard .. "" he jus stan der like a wood, no say nuthin so no numba!""   

Hmm so I guess customer service is not exactly their forte here. Since its my last meal in Vegas, and I have been meaning to try some great off the strip Dim Sum, I just had to deal with it. 

I was finally seated about 20 minutes later. The dim sum came at us hot and heavy. I was able to get all of my orange county favorites. The taste however was just as not as good as Seafood paradise in Little Saigon, but I would say its better then Cathays in Vegas.  The price of the food is definitely very reasonable. However the tip they earned was not so much. I expect at least to be acknowledged when I want to pay for service next time. 

I have dined at Sam Woos and Shang Hais in the same shopping center, but as far as Chinese food goes, this is the most authentic out of them all.

Big mistake.

This is definitely the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.

My family and I didn't really have a problem with the servers, it was really the food that was quite lackluster.

We ordered dim sum (I want to give an extra star for the fact that they serve dim sum for dinner, but I just can't) off of an already used dim sum order form. We got the siu mai, har gau, shrimp balls and salt & pepper squid. The salt & pepper squid was basically fried squid flavored rings of batter. It was like eating hard squid chips. And that was so disappointing because my family loves well made salt and pepper squid. The siu mai had an odd aftertaste. The only dim sum I thought was okay was the har gau. 

A lot of their condiments (soy sauce and chili oil) resided in dirty containers, so we were afraid to use them because they seemed old. The chili oil looked to be more oil or some other liquid than chili, which was kinda gross. 

There's also no refills on drinks.

Even with 6 of us, we couldn't begin to try all the things I spotted.  I disagree with Keith (which is unusual), in that I thought they had enormous variety.  You definitely need to go with a large group of hungry adventurous eaters.  We had everything from  taro cake to shark fin dumplings, chicken feet, seaweed salad, crispy tofu -- tofu so many ways I couldn't keep track, simple things like eggrolls, dynamite dumplings of all shapes, sizes and fillings...we had chinese greens and bao buns that were to die for.  Our host explained that we should also order something from the menu -- he picked his favorite soup -- fish maw...but wouldn't tell us what it was until we'd tried it.  I liked it -- until as he suspected -- once he told me what it was -- then somehow it didn't taste as good anymore -- and I'm pretty adventurous...

He also ordered walnut shrimp which were also great - but one bite put me over the edge -- and I couldn't eat another thing....

I saw lots of things going by that I'd have loved to try...but it will have to wait.  

We met our host at 11:30 and it was packed with a wait.  They have a separate room for large tables -- 8 or more -- which seems to be the way to go, interestingly, to bypass the line.

The owner is a good friend of our host's and picked up the check -- so I have no idea what the bill was and never saw a menu....what I can tell you is that we were the only non-Asians that I saw in the place -- and that, to me, is always the best sign of where to find something truly delicious and authentic to eat.

""Excuse me, can we have some water?"" 
""Hello? We asked for some water earlier -- can we have some water?"" 

Maybe they didn't want us to get full from drinking, but I sounded like a broken record. When we finally got the water, the waitress didn't apologize or seem sorry that her service sucked!

Dropped by here last Sunday night with Mel and her family.  It was 100+ degrees outside....and 80-something inside.  Don't know if the A/C was on, but it was hot inside too!  The restaurant wasn't very well lit, and the place seemed like it would be dirty, but not dirty enough where you're grossed out by it.  

Anyways, the wait staff was friendly (engaging in small talk with Melly Mel's mom) and offered suggestions while we were ordering.  Food came out super quick - not fast like a typical Chinese restaurant, but SUPER QUICK, like the dealers-taking-your-money-quick at the casinos down the street! 

Things of note:  
* Peking Spareribs were good, but a little sour due to them using a little more vinegar in their sauce than what I am used to.
* Orange Chicken...yeah, just don't order it.  All white meat, but not good enough I'd order a 2nd time.

Ordered tons of food, but the only thing that was memorable was the roast duck and the deep fried Chicken.  Everything else was either gross or off taste to what I am used to from a Cantonese flavor stand point.  

What got me was they charge on the steam rice and extra bun for the duck.

As soon as we sat down, the metal carts surrounded us and kept on coming.  We started with:

Shark Fin Dumpling:  4 good sized thin skin dumplings filled with meat.

Pork Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce:  Average, a little fatty and not much black bean or jalapeno.

Custard Tart (Don Tot):  3 small bite-sized custard tarts.  I got these off the cart before they ran out.  Too many times I've gone to Dim Sum and the Don Tot are not ready or they are sold out.  This is one of my favorite childhood pastries.

Then we ordered:

Shu Mai: 4 shrimp and pork dumplings with a small shrimp on top.  More than bite-sized.

Har Gow: 4 dumplings filled with small whole shrimp.  Most places mince the shrimp.

Deep-fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork (haam sui gau): 3 crisp dumplings filled with ground pork and dried shrimp.  The shrimp was a nice touch.

Green Bell Pepper with shrimp: 3 slices green bell bepper topped with a shrimp paste.  This was a dish that not all Dim Sum houses serve.  My friend will be back just for these.

Baked Coconut Custard Buns: 3 baked buns filled with coconut custard.  My friend said Oakland (California) Chinatown is better.  I thought they were decent.

The carts kept on coming around. They didn't have a large selection of Dim Sum, but we could have ordered some items off the menu.  I was looking forward to the Chinese tamales, Sticky fried rice, and BBQ pork pie, but did not see any.

It's funny reading these reviews due to the extremes of ""Yea it sucks"" - "" Eh middle"" - ""WTF THIS IS FANTASTIC"" . So I'm not sure if I'm being retarded...but I always get great service there. Maybe it's my wit, and charming personality....good looking, dashing, debonair, fun, smart,......yea...But this isn't a review about me. 
One thing I like - LATE NIGHT! I LOVE LATE NIGHT AFFORDABLE DINING. ESPECIALLY CHINESE! Because you get that craving on Mmmm I'm hungry. But the cool thing about chinese is you can eat a lot - 20 min later you're hungry again! I'm not sure if it's MSG...or it's the little parasites living in everyone's body from swimming in infested rivers. 
To be honest. I like the food here. It's definitely chinese. But at the same time they do serve to curve the All American Apple Pie Appetite with things like orange chicken, lemon chicken, broccoli beef....zzzzzz Oh I'm sorry if you order these things...STICK TO PANDA!
It helps if you've been to a chinese restaurant with a chinaman. Because they can order! They order fast and in small syllables. Next thing you know you have a feast to feed a small village. 
I do like dim sum here....mmmm dumplings, shrimp or pok. Mmmm and the sesame ball. Ok so good. Good for vegetarian too. I find myself typing but in my head I'm speaking in a chinese accent....Weird.
I think they've been friendly to me because I'm filipino. Oh yea that's it. Because the menu is catered to filipinos. Sure I can read most of the Tagalog on the menu. But where's the filipino food?? Oh...Rice....",UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,0,0,4,ug1S2I2hqgFhNaRjQ_fjcQ

I brought two of my friends here because they wanted some good Dim Sum, and ended up wishing I went to practically any of the other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.  

We ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup, Green Beans with Minced Pork, Hong Kong Style Crispy Noodles, and Fried Fish.  The only thing that was even remotely flavorful was the green beans, and everything else was bland, cold, and under-salted.  The noodles were soaking in a bland gravy that tasted like they thickened water and put it on top of the noodles.  The fried fish wasn't crispy and was bland, as well.  The soup came out last, and very cold.  I couldn't believe they actually served this to us.  We tried to complain but no one understood what we were saying, and we didn't see the waiter after we ordered until we got our check.

But then again, this is a Chinese restaurant and everyone knows service is going to be bad. If it were good, I'd be shocked.

So after several attempts at trying to find good dim sum, we ventured to this place after I saw it advertised on the Chinese channel while watching TV in the hotel. Believe it or not the hotel had Chinese satellite TV feeding from Hong Kong. I was up late watching old Cantonese soap operas -- but I digress.

So anyway, one of the places advertised was this one. Hubby thought for sure the food was going to be good seeing it obviously catered to a Chinese clientele. Well he was right. The dim sum, although not artistically created into teeny weenie morsels, were done well. Not only that but everything tasted good. The tripe was steamed with ginger and scallions -- lots of flavor, not like the one at Chang's. In fact, the har gow was also very very good (unlike that of Chang's). Cha siu bao was above average (and I don't even like cha siu bao) and so was the stuffed bean curd sheets.

I was a bit annoyed at the fact that when I asked for iced water, they kept passing the buck to someone else. Finally I just yelled out at a dim sum lady who then yelled out to 'amigo' in the back who rushed out towards me. Before he could even walk 5 steps I yelled out ""DOS AGUAS"" and he immediately turned around and got us 2 iced waters pronto.

4 stars for decent dim sum.

We had a quick lunch at Harbor Palace and it consisted of:

- steamed pork buns
- shrimp dumplings 
- rice wrapped in lotus leaf 
- sesame balls with red bean paste
- long rice noodles with bbq pork

It's tiered pricing and about the same as in most places in the San Gabriel Valley (Southern California).

4974833,2010-03-07,5,jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw,"There's a reason why Harbor Palace ranks on the bottom of my list of dim sum places in Vegas.

It was my second visit ever and it just reconfirmed my experience from the first time I went.

Saturday brunch - 11:30 am arrival.  Not as busy as I would expect.  (Bad sign.)

We have a large party, five adults and four children.  As a result, we're seated in one of the larger tables in the room set off to the right of the restaurant.

We had barely sat down, especially with getting all the young kids seated, when the cart lady was hollering, ""You want dim sum!?""  I was immediately put off with her attitude and probably would have left if it was just the Husband and I.  (My Chinese friend mentioned that her mom has a simple standard of dim sum restaurants - tea should be placed on the table before the food is brought out.  And she's right.  Growing up, that's the first thing I remember from my many dim sum brunches.  The waiters ask what kind of tea you want (usually as you're getting situated), and before the carts come, the tea is on your table.)

But in this case, we felt so pressured to order from the lady's cart and had baskets of food on our table way before the beverage guy came around to ask what we wanted to drink.  (I will say that he brought the tea and water over quickly and had our tea pots filled the whole time, of course with my help of flipping the cover up.)  

We got the typical orders of pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings.  Nothing special here, more dried out from over-steaming, if that makes sense.  We got a couple orders of beef balls and was surprised they didn't cut it in half (I've always seen it cut in half), nor was any Worcestershire sauce given.

Rice noodle dishes came by and I asked (in Cantonese) if they had Beef Noodle Roll.  She said they did, looked around, then asked if I wanted the Pork Spare Ribs one.  I said fine, and then she asked about the Shrimp one too, which I said was fine.  (Although she did try sneaking another one onto our table until we caught her in time to just say only one!)  And of course, the beef one never showed up.  

I asked for Egg Custard Bun, and she said they had it, but tried passing off some yellow bean one as well.  We did eventually get the Egg Custard Bun and it was not good....hard, dry and old.  Bleh!

Deep fried chicken wings were decent the first time around, but even better when we got them nice and hot.  The deep fried salt and pepper shrimp was also nice and hot when we got it too.

Other dishes included steamed pork buns, chow mein noodles, Chinese broccoli (been sitting out too long), shrimp and tofu, chicken feet, and steamed beef tripe.  Nothing memorable though.

The Husband wasn't eating much from the very start and I had to wonder why.  He discreetly pointed to the HAIR that was sitting on his rice noodle dish.  Oh. Yuck.  (And unfortunately we did not say anything about it then or at the end since we were with guests.  But normally, we would have at least tried to point it out after we paid.  And no, you never say anything during your meal because we all know what happens at Chinese restaurants if you complain.)

Overall, Harbor Palace is just not that good. We weren't that impressed the first time and we aren't impressed now.  And the service is beyond bad here.  Sure, I know everyone says you can't expect much on service at dim sum restaurants, but this places leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  It's not even worth tolerating.

They do have hot chili oil available on the tables, not just regular chili sauce.  And please stop asking for Sriracha sauce, you know who you are!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,9,6,2,rDmR3VxFkgFTEZ_L0IIf3g

5360602,2011-09-23,1,jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw,"Un-be-lievable!  We should have stuck to our gut instincts and said ""no"" to trying out another dim sum place, other than our usual, Orchids Garden.  We should have also read all of the Yelp reviews on this place before entering their restaurant.  What a mistake we made!  Never before have I asked my family to ditch a restaurant the moment we got seated...until this day!

Walking in, my family didn't get greeted by the host upfront with his head buried in a newspaper.  No.  Instead, it felt as though we had disturbed him.  It took him a while to muster up a ""how many?"" before he removed himself from his seat to sit us at a table.  STRIKE ONE.

Next, we asked our server if they had dim sum.  To which she rudely replied, ""Dim sum, no order!"" seeing we had their menu before us.  Okayyyy.  Understandably, we weren't going to order dim sum from their menu, as we are accustomed to ordering from CARTS!  She walked away and returned with a paper menu of dim sum items and a pencil and dropped them at our table; no explanation.  Weird, so I assume, we DO have to ORDER, as we see no cart in sight anyway.  STRIKE TWO!

We finally get to writing down our list of dim sum items we would like.  We then proceed to asking her for two more settings for our table of four (we were seated on a table set for two).  Without a word, she turned around and grabbed two settings from an open table.  As she began to ""place"" them on our table, she pushed past my two young children reaching over them, resulting in her ""thrusting"" the fork and knife toward my husband as he was writing.  Really, woman?  She basically poked his hand with a fork tine, never excused herself for it, and simply walked away.  RUDE!  STRIKE THREE!!!

At that point, I asked my husband if we could leave.  So upsetting!  As I walked past the server, who then realized we were walking out, I pointed at her and scolded her with a ""YOU NEED TO BE NICER!""  Then we left.

Now, I apologize in advance if I offend, I have no intention of it.  But, seriously?  At some Chinese restaurants, you are commonly accustomed to experience a kind of abrupt, hurried kind of service that is typical of their customary practice.  I should know.  I'm Chinese myself.  So, I'm not being overly sensitive of the situation at Harbor Palace that night.  I know what to typically expect, or not expect.

But, this???  The customer service at Harbor Palace should not be experienced by any paying patron, no matter what!  (I should say, the lack of customer service).  They have no common sense of decency when it comes to working with people.  In fact, I believe that because they are ""fed"" their business via tour buses (don't ask me how or why it is that way), they feel the need to not offer good, if any, customer service.

I'm not one to typically mind a dingy and dirty place (see my other reviews). But food quality should make up for that. In this case, it didn't.

Take-out or delivery ""Chinese"" food is ubiquitous in any American city with a population of over 100k. And most major American cities have a neighborhood designated as ""China Town."" In spite of that, there are few Chinese restaurants here in Vegas that serve food that people in China eat, as opposed to Chinese food.

This restaurant serves what Chinese people call ""food."" And I call it ""delicious."" And except for their specialties, very affordable (they have abalone braised in oyster sauce. $80, but who's counting. Maybe I'll get a GoFundMe account, 'cause I REALLY wanna try that! I imagine that's not precisely what GoFundMe is for, though.)

The chicken with ginger and scallions is sublime. The ""mustard greens with top soup"" is a bit hard to understand; they pack the greens and soup separately. It is delicious, too. And fried rice is fried rice, but they raise the bar a bit.

I understand they do dim sum. I can hardly wait to visit them and have some authentic dim sum, which I hear they do very well.

I subtracted one star because they serve shark fin soup. But I won't pontificate here, it's not appropriate. Suffice to say, if you're tempted, and have never tried it, it's not worth the money (shark fin soup in general). I had it once, in Hong Kong, and it was so ""meh."" Okay, I guess I pontificated a little. So sorry!

Please do try this establishment out. If you prefer American style Chinese food, they can accommodate your tastes, and if you want try something different and closer to what they eat in China, they have plenty of options.

They said they have it but when we ordered it they say not available. We ended up not odering anything and just paid for the Dim Sum we ordered and left.

But most of the time, the guy in the front, maybe the manager, i really don't know who he is, IS SO EFFIN' RUDE!!! He's usually there late in the afternoon to late night. He showed me where my table is without giving the menu. I waited for it and nothing. I stood up and walked back in front and asked for it politely, he was writing something and did not even say anything or looked at me, when i was asking him the menu. I walked away thinking that maybe he was just really busy, then when i was already seated, he said Hey! Here's the menu, without moving his feet and trying to say, come here and get it! So stupid! Then i actually realized that he really did ignored me face to face when i approached him about the menu in the first place. And because of that, I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER AGAIN! RESPECT YOUR CUSTOMERS! CUSTOMERS EXPECT SERVICE! GOOD SERVICE!!! THAT IS WHERE YOUR TIPS COME FROM!!! WE PAY FOR IT!!! I STILL PAID FOR IT!!!  I will not hesitate anymore to drive to the next block to go to ORCHIDS! Tourist come here because this is the one in the main Chinatown block and because they didn't know about the other ones around. Maybe now i know why there's more customers at Orchids. I am not connected with Orchids, i just had the oppurtunity to compare the two big ones. and i am just a of dimsums. So customer, do your research first. You can always feel full after you eat, but don't you think it's much better when you feel full and feel good after you eat?!!!",Wh7378g_yTQOh6dJ2dw50A,0,0,1,o7O4UpCelD1z-aXpDWWXwg

Today I was craving the Walnut Shrimp. 
I pull into the parking lot and there's a crowd of people waiting to go in. What !?!? That's never happened before. I guess this is a popular place on Sunday morn compared to the weekday afternoons that I have been here before. I get inside and am seated quickly. And there are ladies with dim sum carts. I have not had that since I left LA years ago. The Walnut Shrimp can wait for another day.

Hot green tea was brought to my table quickly.

I got my food from the first carts to come my way: calamari, fried shrimp, steamed shrimp in a thin dough and 2 dessert type buns: pineapple and coconut. I liked it all. The hot food was hot; the fried food was crisp; the dessert buns were soft. It all tasted fresh.

Took most of it home since I was alone and could not possibly eat it all in one sitting.

I think the servers did a good job. They got people in and out quickly. There is a language barrier but to me that just adds to the experience.

p.s. After reading Yelp reviews, I guess it's a good thing that I have never seen the lady's bathroom LOL.",wIH9huA5PCkvoOSycvK5oQ,1,0,4,UfnI22BRxnccym0UoHr1MA
5735867,2012-01-03,0,jrE4M9HlYp2AZZ7iQCSIRw,"The only reason why we went here was because after a 4hour road trip from CA we wanted some dim sum to start our weekend off and since the Harbor Palace was listed off offering it on the Malls board we walked over and decided to give it a try.

There wasn't much variety after looking at 4-5 different carts that's all they had to offer. The siu mei and the chicken feet were the highlights everything else was bland and not exactly worth the meal . Go save your stomache for one of the places to eat at in the malls or try out ping pang pong down the road for better dim sum.

Though for some reason the place was filling up pretty quick i'm assuming is because of that sign thats posted listing off all of the restuarants and what they have to serve. I guess its a plus that they serve until 5am on weekends.",fPzM8rESloa6Leh0Ye7D5A,0,0,2,IPAvJMzFxFxyooZDZ7n5Ww

The next day when it was time to eat again, there was no way that we were gonna do any buffet! 
Had to look for something to take out, and something light for my loved one, so off I went to the little Chinatown area on Spring Mountain Road.........I found this rather large Chinese restaurant called - Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant.

In I walked, and the first thing I asked them is if they sold juk (Chinese porridge)?

Lucky for me this was our savoir! I was able to get the juk that I wanted for my loved one, it was rather expensive, but when you need it, you need it!

This place offered seven types of juk -

1. Frog Leg Porridge  -  $19.00 for Large
2. Seafood Porridge - $17.00 for Large
3. Fish Porridge - $17.00 for Large
4. Fisherman Porridge - $17.00 for Large
5. Pork Porridge - $12.00 for Large
6. Chicken Porridge - $12.00 for Large
7. Beef Porridge - $12.00 for Large

My parents and I had longer-than-usual stay in Las Vegas and were tired of food and buffets on The Strip, so we decided to venture into LV's ""Chinatown"" and see what we could scrounge up to eat.  We saw lines in a few places, but we decided to settle for dim sum.  It seemed to be really popular because the restaurant lobby was vomiting out people.  I mean, really, spewing people out everywhere, loitering and waiting about.  My parents, being the stubborn people that they are, decided to take a number and wait.  With a small party of 3, the wait shouldn't be that long.  

Well, it was.  By the time I got in, I was starving.  We waited for almost an hour.  By that sheer fact, I thought the food would be wonderful.  I mean, why else would people be waiting that long to eat?  Let down again.  I mean, it was relatively good considering I've been living in NH where their dimsum selection is a little... well, non-existent.  And it's the first bite of dimsum I've had in months and months.  So, it wasn't bad.  But I am still well-aware that there is plenty of good dimsum back in SF.  I mean, much better.

They were sooo busy, that no one paid attention to us when we wanted to pay our bill.  And the place smelled funny.  And it was SO crowded.  I was such between my dad's elbows and someone else's baby carriage.  With a baby in it!  Watching me eat!  Good Lord.
