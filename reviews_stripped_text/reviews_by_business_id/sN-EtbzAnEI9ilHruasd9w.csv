The whole process took about half an hour from the time we walked in and left with our to go order. The line wasn't really that long but there was one woman taking orders and getting the orders handed out. There were two men, one cutting ribs and one putting the food in the containers. They definitely needed at least one, maybe two more employees. The majority of the food was in warming units and already prepared, so I'm not really sure what took so long. The food itself was very mediocre. The pulled chicken and pulled pork tasted like it sat in water all day, but was tender. The green beans were seasoned a bit but were very rubbery. The potato salad tasted like the kind you buy at the grocery store in the plastic containers. The baked beans were good. The mac and cheese wasn't too bad. The cornbread was very sticky like it wasn't cooked all the way or sat in moisture too long. All in all we probably won't go back here. The wait and the price are not worth the food you get. If they want to beat Rollin Smoke they have a long way to go. I think this was their opening weekend so keep trying and maybe it will get better for someone else.",NphdjrE8H45jEt5GjBo9SQ,6,1,2,8BS3Y9IuAVouw1TBMdatMA

My husband loves Sweet Baby Rays sauce, but couldn't understand  why they wouldn't make their own. I got cabbage (way too much butter), and mac n cheese (watery powder boxed on a good day). Hubby got green beans (not fresh, straight out of a can), and baked beans. The baked beans had ground beef in it. Like seriously.  He said it was more of a sweet chili than baked beans. Now on to the corn muffins... They were rocks. Im not kidding, I banged one a couple of times on the table and there was a distinct knocking sound. There was another guy there eating, he took one bite of his muffin, looked at it in horror and then set it aside.  I am not trying to be mean as the couple who own it were really nice, hence the 2 stars. I just want to speak the truth, and it was absolutely awful.  Never again.

We were the only ones there so we did get serviced right away. We ordered the 2.3 which consisted of pulled pork, ribs, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, mac and cheese and corn bread. I was highly disappointed. The pulled pork was just okay, it was a little dry, the ribs were decent but nothing to brag about. My husband said he rather have ribs from Chili's. The meat lacked BBQ smoke flavor, not sure how to explain. It tasted like it was made in an oven versus a smoker or a pit. Mac and cheese was dry and seemed like it was sitting all day. The mashed potatoes were impossible to eat as they were cold and rubbery and lacked flavor. The corn in the cob was decent but again cold. The corn bread was disgusting! I literally spit it into a napkin because I couldn't swallow it because it was so grainy and dry and also cold. 

The atmosphere was nice and place looked clean. The portions were a good size, hubby and I shared the plate. A bit pricey $25 for the plate and drink (I wouldn't mind the price if the food was good).

I've had BBQ all over the country, I've been to most of the BBQ joints in Vegas, have only been impressed enough to return to 2 or 3.  I won't be going back to Tennesseasonings.   First of all how can you come up with that name and serve BBQ without any seasoning???  When I first got there I told the owner that I was a BBQ snob, she seemed confident and a few of her responses made me think they knew what they were doing, especially not putting sauce on the ribs, usually BBQ joints the have bland meat use the BBQ sauce to mask that.   Anyway I ordered the half slab with a link and mac and cheese.  I didn't even notice the couple eating until after I ordered, I asked them how the food was and was given a terrible look, they guy invited me to try a rib, I did and it was very bland.  No smoke flavor and no seasoning, don't think those ribs were smoked!  Damn!!  Nothing I could do at this point except hope that the link and mac and cheese could save the day but I knew they couldn't because I'm all about BBQ ribs.   So I get home, start to eat, the ribs didn't magically become better than the one I tried at the restaurant, they weren't terrible just bland and flavorless, well I guess that is terrible.  They may as well sauce these ribs up because that's the only way I could eat them.  Sauces were good.   I had the chicken link, it was OK, better than the ribs.  The mac and cheese was terrible, straight out of the Kraft box, one bite and I was done!!  My quest for good Q in Vegas continues.  :(",u4BHxiH2fBlH6bRJxDl8Xw,1,0,1,kaw5sG4DhHN3BmXmdhi_GA

Have known better.  No smoke smell=no smoke flavor. These were baby back ribs cut by individual bone. They were not shaved and when they came to the table they were literally bubbling.

4620309,2017-05-14,5,sN-EtbzAnEI9ilHruasd9w,"I found out about their grand opening through Twitter. Their website boasts East TN BBQ. Having had some excellent BBQ just outside of Knoxville (and later trying another place that was just OK), I was looking forward to what Tennesseasonings had to offer.

We showed up around 4pm and they already ran out of chicken and baby back ribs. Not a good sign for your grand opening. Or maybe it is a good sign and they had a nice lunch rush.

We decided to get a ""Plate 2.3"" to share (2 meats and 3 sides) for about $20. We chose pulled pork and chicken sausage along with green beans, greens, and baked beans.

The sausage and the sides were all good but the pork stood out for me. It's been a while since I've had good pulled pork. I tend to avoid ordering it because I find it's usually just dry pork that needs a lot of BBQ sauce to help it along. I appreciated that their pulled pork was chunkier and was more juicy.

All the sauces were on the side and it was interesting that they have a Carolina style mustard sauce. It turns out that they are from Chattanooga (possibly my favorite city in TN) and their BBQ is influenced by their neighboring states (AL/GA/NC/SC). Granted I know nothing of Carolina BBQ, but we'll be traveling there in August, so I'll consider that a preview.

I still need to go back to try their baby back ribs, but I'm going with 4 preliminary stars. We enjoyed our food, the service was super friendly, and she even got my name exactly correct, which is quite rare.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,13,7,4,EZvSReZAsidP5VA-FSQz0g

A full slab should be enough for two people with a couple of sides.  They could be improved upon with a spicier dry rub with more kick to it.

5170140,2017-09-20,0,sN-EtbzAnEI9ilHruasd9w,So I was intrigued by the awesome smell of the BBQ that was cooking up as I walked in. But I gotta say that the food was lacking. I ordered ribs and chicken wings with the sides of mac and cheese and corn bread. I can tell you that the wings got smacked with a fancy name but just simple fried wings they were good. The ribs I got were undercooked. I felt like as I ate them I was looking for the perfect cooked part those parts were good but I I didn't want to get sick. The mac and cheese was not good it tasted like velveeta and the corn bread was dry. The sweet tea is super sweet i mean man I don't know if I was going to get diabetes after drinking it. I will say though after all the bad I've had to say this place still has potential the portions were insane though I'll give props to that,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,2,0,2,Y2ICo-oACUro2SKpIXe_3Q

We lived 27 years within 5 hour drive of TN and went frequently...had Corkys before they hit QVC..Nathans another favorite..these didn't come close.  Now for positive thoughts. Green Beans with onions and bacon, BBQ Beans with bits of crumbled sausage and diced ring sausage and Cole Slaw were supe...so good, we're  willing to try again with a different meat.  The Mac and Cheese could use less American Cheese and some Colby Jack added   It's quite small and a noisy place. ...maybe 6 tables in front and another 2 in the back.   There's a granite counter that didn't seem to be used. ..maybe in the future.  They're new...think they will improve with age.",ShuaLn8hWFnjp5f45JeUVg,1,1,4,O9CwVmbi6FMam62LUnl-Hg

When I pulled in there was only two cars in the parking lot (on a Saturday at 5:00) and when I walked in the place was empty!  The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helpful with me on my two orders, and the cook with the beard tied up in a rubber band that made my orders acted like I had inconvenienced him and interrupted his Conversation. They lady bagged up my orders and helped me choose which sauces. When I got home (less than five minutes away) we sat down to eat dinner my wife got the ribs with greens and Cole slaw and I got the mac and cheese and potato salad ($27.60) The ribs were SUPER tough and dry and the greens was ""ok"" but not cooked long enough and the Cole slaw was store bought and bland. My smoked bologna was ""alright"" but the mac and cheese was nothing more than out of a box and runny and the potato salad was also store bought and bland... overall We was totally disappointed and we won't be returning.",-ZCGdGLtETgNEaOtqHQmSQ,1,0,1,qZC7e-fd2Qx9pR6cB95QTA

Open for approximately three months on West Warm Springs Road, Southwest Las Vegas' dining scene continuing to grow by leaps and bounds, Tennesseasonings sees the Harris family bring a unique style of regional Barbeque to Sin City, the couple from Chattanooga certainly not shooting for Texas or Kansas City in style and equally far from the Mop-sauces offered in the Western half of their home State.

Located in the streetside storefront of the same strip mall as Japaneiro, the interior bright with Volunteer-Orange and pictures of Peyton and Reggie, guests entering Tennesseasonings will immediately be struck by the lack of a 'smoked' smell and the sounds of Sports Television, a sleepy-eyed team of four tucked behind the counter on a recent Saturday visit that found the space devoid of guests around 12:30 in the afternoon.

Thus far receiving mixed reviews that seem to be based on misperceptions of intent, comments about not being ""Tennessee BBQ"" clearly referencing Memphis and thus unaware that the East's dry-rubbed style is as different from that as St. Louis is from Kansas City, it was as a group of two that the counter was approached with a big smile offered from a young man happy to make recommendations, he and his colleagues previously entertained by their cell phones and a re-run of Dunk Kings.

Bridging the style of Jack's in Music City with North Carolina 'cue, though the obvious lack of smokers at Tennesseasonings leads one to believe that the meat is prepared in an electric oven next to wood chips as opposed to directly over them, it was after a bit of decision making that two ""Plate 2.3"" combos were ordered along with Desserts and a Drink, the total cost coming out to just over $53 before tip and a nearly fifteen minute wait to follow as Food was prepared.

Offering a fairly diverse menu, the rotating specials including Turkey, Bologna and four styles of Sausage while the ""Everyday Meat Choices"" include traditional smokehouse fare plus several sides, it was after being approached twice more by servers to inquire about Wing Sauce and whether the order was to-go or for dine-in that several Styrofoam containers were presented, the sweet BBQ Sauce and seasoned Vinegar not particularly memorable, yet necessary as both the Ribs and Pork are served naked save for a bit of Salt, Pepper and Chili Powder.

Taking a look first at sides, the Macaroni and Cheese no better than straight-from-the-box Kraft with a touch less salinity while the tri-color Pasta Salad is virtually flavorless, those looking for something better are encouraged to try either the BBQ Beans mixed with Ground Beef or the tender Collard Greens teaming with Pork in a generous ladle of Pot Liquor.

Not particularly impressed by two complimentary Cornbread Muffins, the texture a bit too crumbly and sweetness for lack, it was by way of Pulled Pork that Meats were first tasted, an ample amount of crispy Skin mixed in with the flesh creating a pleasant texture that only required a bit of Sauce, the Ribs an entirely different story as they were plenty juicy but without any evidence of a Smoke ring and thus totally reliant on the Sauce for flavor beyond the basic seasoning. 

Offering two links of Sausage to an order, the ""Peg Leg Chicken"" nothing more than smoked Wings and Drumettes slathered in a choice of Sauces, it was with hopes of a good spice profile that a Hot Link and Chicken Chorizo Sausage were selected, both of them clearly store bought and merely finished in house despite being flavorful enough while the 'homemade' Desserts were a hit and miss way to finish, the Hulk-Green Key Lime Pie buoyed by a buttery Graham Cracker Crust that played well off sour Filling that would have been better off with less Whipped Cream  while the Banana Pudding was completely devoid of any whole Fruit with just a single Shortbread Cookie adding texture to a mix that was almost certainly straight out the box.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Offering ""good for what it is"" as a sort of backhanded compliment, East Tennessee BBQ not especially well known outside the region for a reason, Tennesseasonings finds itself in a tough spot for trying to do something different in a city notoriously bad for Barbeque, the results largely marred by the lack of a smoker and reliance on what seems to be a lot of low-effort non-Meat items.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,3,V-7vZhO9KIcWfKOtPloE2Q

5607364,2018-01-07,0,sN-EtbzAnEI9ilHruasd9w,"Solid barbecue from some really nice folks from Tennessee.  The baby back ribs come to your table un sauced which is perfect for me.  They provide a multitude of different sauces for those that want it.  The ribs were flavorful, tender, lean and smoky. I could have eaten 10 more of them!   The smoked chicken was juicy and smoked well.  It could have used a bit more seasoning for tastes but a bit of the barbecue sauce solved the issue.  

The sides were a mixed bag.  The corn on the cob and the Laura's baked beans were both top notch.  Laura knows something about making beans!   The cabbage and the cornbread were tasty and well done.  The mashed potatoes were just OK.  They use a golden potato  and they are not whipped enough for me.  

We usually drive out of town for our barbecue but this place gives us an in town option. We will return to the little bit of East Tennessee right here in Las Vegas.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,3,1,5,e-yASws74d2lfPCsFIYg_Q

The first time we went was during their 'soft opening' and were still figuring things out. It wasn't impressive then, and it wasn't impressive today. My wife and I each ordered the 1.2 plate.  I ordered the chicken, Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The chicken had a lot of fat attachments on it and was greasy.  Additionally, the Mac and cheese was pretty terrible. The wife got Mac and cheese for both sides with the pulled pork. The pork was hardly pulled, and was so fatty it was lacking the actual meat... the corn bread that comes with it is just too simple. I can't think of any reason to ever come back here.  I really want this place to be good, but they have exhausted every opportunity to give any good impression on me.",eYNLZkBYHTgGUcmgTVOWBQ,1,0,2,kcKaArTPWzVJSWAbekL0qg
5719891,2017-05-24,0,sN-EtbzAnEI9ilHruasd9w,"I'm only giving 3 stars because my husband seems to be enjoying most of his meal. He likes his ribs. I had a bite, and I didn't like the taste or texture. He got a plate with sides of Mac n cheese, coleslaw, and cornbread. There was also some pulled pork on his plate. His plate cost $17.50. The cornbread was burnt and extremely dry. Tasteless. I was going to get the pork plate with green beans and Mac n cheese. They had no green beans. So I went with the pork sandwich with some coleslaw on the side. It was $11. If you want chips instead of slaw, it's an upgrade. This place, to me, is in no way worth the price. It's expensive for what it is, and it's just not that great.",MV3Pfu7x205_3OBtyRIusg,0,0,3,jLdsgs10r_YhoQoz3AF1nQ

Actually the pulled chicken was decent but I said smoked chicken i was expecting a piece not a plate of pulled chicken.we were not served any bread or onions n pickle like traditional bbq joints. Husb had pork ribs said they are soso. Not really any smoke to it. We wish them well but they have really gotta kick it up a few notches.   Decor was cute. The greens were nice n tender but needed some butter and bacon grease for a little pazazzle.,n_x7Nuq2P6jG7_NrBvUN3Q,0,0,2,vjEkQpRq-_J5HhE6ARLvdQ
