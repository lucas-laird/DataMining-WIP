49675,2015-09-21,1,0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw,Ive been largely disappointed with this restaurant. I always order the same meal and its always a different price. That is absolutely ridiculous. I've also found large black hairs in my food twice. Yukk! I see that another reviewer found a rubber band in his meal. How does that happen? THIS PLACE IS WAY OVER PRICED!

This is my third visit. I ordered Mongolian Beef (the one I had great experience with during the first visit). All I have to say is, the food tastes good this time, but the beef is still awful.

I don't have more to say except this to the owner. Please use the same beef you use before. This batch of beef is terrible. Too many tendons in there, some are too soft (baking soda burn) some are too hard to chew (full of tendons).

I just recently discovered their awesome lunch specials.
Lunch specials are available until 4pm daily. It is served with fried or steamed rice and chow mein. They also have egg drop soup with the lunch special but this is not included in takeout orders. Lunch special prices are from $5.95 to $6.50. (The higher priced lunch specials are those dishes that have seafood).

I got to try two lunch specials from here. They were the L8: Moo Goo Chicken and the L10: Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce. I was pleasantly surprised with both lunch specials. They were very generous with their servings. There was a fair share of fried rice and chow mein and there was so much chicken in the entrees. Not only did this place have great portions, the food was good as well. The Chicken in Hot Garlic sauce had a nice spicy and sweet flavor to it. The Moo Goo Chicken had a more subtle flavor to it. The emphasis on the Moo Goo Chicken was more on the veggie/mushroom flavor. Both chicken dishes were delicious and both had their distinct, unique flavors. I liked that this place had delicious and generous entrees. It was plenty of food for lunch and there was plenty for dinner as well.

China One also sends coupons in the mail. For spending over $10, I got my choice of free egg rolls or crab ragoons. I chose to get 2 free crab ragoons. The crab ragoons were yummy. It was crispy and hot and when it arrived. It was filled with lots of cream cheese! There were two types of sweet and sour dipping sauces that came with it too.

I think China One will be my new number one go-to place for quick and yummy Chinese takeout/delivery when I am in Vegas :). Yay!",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,6,5,4,4s5Q6ctk9E5bB7UImuR84A

Good selection of Chinese and even some Thai options.  We got the Kung Pao Beef, Orange Chicken, sautéed broccoli, egg rolls and butterfly shrimp. 

Kung Pao beef was well spiced and tasty.  Orange chicken was good but this dish is hard to mess up and didn't wow me.  Egg rolls were crisp and tasty.  Best of all was the sautéed broccoli actually!  Still crisp so it wasn't overcooked and just the right amount of garlic.  Well worth the broccoli farts I subjected my lady to.

When we came home our food was nice and hot.  Each take out box was filled to the brim and our family of five were completely satisfied.

The over all experience has been positive! :)  The service is consistent and we had a memorable experience when the place first opened:  We dined in and they were super friendly and gave away freebies and extra food and were very accommodating to our rambunctious little boys.

The fried rice was pretty good, but a little on the oily side. Then again, I may have only noticed the oil because of the styrofoam plates we were eating on. The plates were absolutely covered in oil by the end!

As for the GTC, I got it to go. So yes, this is not a review of freshly cooked China One GTC.

My usual go-to GTC lunch destination is Chopstix; they don't include veggies, so this was a nice change-up.

    Without a menu outside, I was lured inside the restaurant. When I walked inside, I saw a take out style Chinese Restaurant with some tables. The menu was displayed on a large board on the wall. When I looked at the menu, I saw a similar menu to the majority of the Chinese Restaurants that I have patronized in Las Vegas. The average lunch special (served to 4 PM.) started around $6. The shrimp based entrees were slightly higher priced.

   For something in the ballpark of $8.38 plus a $1  tip; I chowed down a lunch special that included noodles with duck sauce (Yes! I did not have to leave my seat and ask for the duck sauce.), egg drop soup (for dining in), pepper steak, fried rice, and chow mien noodles. With the food, I drank from a cup of Coke that is fairly large for a Chinese Restaurant. The food was OK. Nothing sensational where it would make my day if they added a store in my neighborhood, and not bad. My minor complaint is that too much of the plate was taken up by chow mien noodles, which I regard as filler.

  The employees were friendly. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door. They checked up on me to make sure that the food was good, It was when I was about to leave that left me a positive last impression of China One. When I paid and they were cleaning my table, the nice woman that works there refilled my fairly large cup of soda to drink after I left. In some cases it is the last impression that is memorable.

Usually get food here to-go, but if you do choose to eat in, they have good service, unless they're busy.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,5,2,5,Ms2r30UC8o_0gq73QmMF_w
5190792,2013-02-25,0,0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw,"This place deserves 3.5 stars but since I got coupons in the mail, China One gets the 0.5 star boost.

I live around the corner from the place so whenever I crave Chinese food, this is the only place I go.  And let me mention that I've only ordered to-go, although they do have ~5 tables for patrons to eat there. 

To-go service is so speedy!  Order by phone or just sit and wait for the food - either is fine & quick. 

FOOD:  (they give a carton of rice--plenty--per each entree dish ordered)

- shrimp with vegetables: felt like there were more vegetables than shrimp, or at least the to-go box was PACKED with veggies on the top with a layer of peanuts on top of that. Had to dig down to find a shrimp.  This dish wasn't anything special.

- walnut shrimp: good, typical, no complaints with it

- general chicken: it is actually a LITTLE bit spicy reflecting that chili pepper next to the dish.  You know how sometimes places like to put those chilis next to spicy dishes when in reality they aren't?! Well this place is somewhat accurate.

Had a coupon for free 12 fried chicken wonton for spending $20.  They were SO GOOD!  Warm, crispy outside with a hearty nugget of chicken inside.  This whole side could have been my meal. 

BOTTOM LINE: decent Chinese food, they cook/prepare the food quick if you order to-go, try to get some coupons!",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,4,0,4,ZxlIZzKsM7JpV59lh4_Icw

If I were in the area, I would still run in for my old stand by broccoli and tofu lunch special, but it's not a stand alone lunch destination for me any longer as our neighborhood China One far exceeds this location in quality of service.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,11,3,uEiANtF8eH6vFVLmQr_U4A

5446171,2012-01-18,1,0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw,"I phoned in my order to pick up for Won Ton Soup and to get the free egg rolls I needed to spend $10 so I got the Hong Kong Crispy Noodles.  So I spent $16+ instead.  I live 2 minutes away so why not try it?  

It was ready for me by the time I got there as promised and waiting for me on the counter.  I was not greeted or acknowledged as 3 cashiers/workers were staring at the cash register as if it was some kind of video game.  I greeted them instead and told them my name.  They check ID when you pay with credit card so I handed them my government issued ID.  It took her a minute to find my name that matched my credit card and I told her where she could find it.  THEN, she asked me ""where did you get this.?""  So, that just pissed me off more!!!  Really?  Was she about to question me about my ID?  

SO I finally went home and told myself if their service is this bad their food better be good.  I'm glad that they took the time to separate the noodles and the sauce.  I put everything together and it was so salty.  The noodles I threw away because I felt ashamed to even share with the rest of my family.  The soup had fried shrimp in it so it made my soup oily.  I ate half of the soup and put it into the refrigerator thinking it might taste better the next day.   I added water the next day and finally ate the rest.  

I'm giving them 2 stars because they were fast and I'm sure they pay a lot for their location in Summerlin so here's a free one.  

The only thing I liked was the free won ton chips you get with sweet and sour sauce.  I wonder how much they charge for that?  If it's $1 I think I might go back for those.",DVf8I3x6yoLNX7-w6Y-JVQ,2,1,2,4F7JQ3KZbUxZZfL9xTi2vQ

Some of my favorites include Singapore Noodles, War Wonton Soup, and Chicken w/broccoli.
