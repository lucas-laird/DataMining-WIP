1380647,2018-01-22,1,K1SzOXV70qDbcq6T64PZsw,"Came here for the first time last night for dinner with some friends after finding out about this on Yelp. This restaurant sits inside the mall in main Chinatown, in the middle restaurant area. For those who's been in Vegas since Chinatown opened, most have realized how this specific location has changed ownerships many times. The last I heard about this location, it was ""known"" for its AYCE steam pot. This is exactly what we had saw other people eating while we walked around the restaurant on the outer perimeter before entering the restaurant. Everything is still labeled with the previous restaurant's name ""Spicy Crawfish"" or whatever it was. On the front counter, there were menu's for XiangXiang Noodle. It took the waitress a good 5-10 minutes before she noticed we were there. She ran up and quickly sat us at a table. 

The restaurant seemed to have renovated after this XiangXiang combination was introduced or maybe before (i never come into this mall). For the longest time, it had never had an actual wall besides a small fence around the perimeter. I guess recently, they had put up actual glass walls. It is a fairly open restaurant but very little diners. This specific location was never a popular spot, hence why the change of ownerships in the past. From what

On yelp, there was a check-in offer for a free appetizer of either tea eggs or buns. The first male person to help us had no clue what it was, he asked another person to come and they were clueless as well. He asked if we spoke Chinese, which we responded that we spoke Cantonese. He had a 3rd person come and help us. She knew about the check in offer and said the buns were available. She asked how many we wanted and we told her as many as the offer allowed. We had a party of 5, and surprisingly, she gave us 5. They were 5 small freshly steamed buns with a yellow custard like filling, that you'd normally see at like Dim Sum. 

We had no idea what to offer so we had tried some ""fail safe"" items and ones that sounded good. 

3 of us had tried the ""G5 - Lamp with Quail Eggs Round Noodle"" under the Shanxi Style Specials, and tried the ""C1 - Traditional Beef Sirlion Noodle Soup"". We had also ordered a wood ear mushroom appetizer to share and try. 

The wood ear mushroom appetizer came out first as it was a cold appetizer. Seasoned with some sesame oil, and maybe a drizzle of seasoning, it was a very simple appetizer. Mushroom was nice and ""crunchy"" in texture, not overcooked and mushy. 

I personally had the ""G5 - Lamp with Quail Eggs Round Noodle"". Yes that says lamp. not a typo on my part. It says Lamp in the menu but it means lamb. They did not have round noodles and said they only noodle they had and were doing was the knife-cut/pushed noodle. So we were like ok. Thats fine. When the noodle soups came out, it smelled nice but it seemed mild. Soup base was very mild, at best. Noodle quality seemed pretty good. It was nice and chewy/al dente but unfortunately, the soup base nor are the toppings up to par. Everything was very mild in flavor. The ""lamb"" were like those slices of ""preserved/seasoned meat rolls"" and not actual lamb meat. My friend and I were reminiscing how good the lamb noodles we had in Flushing, NY at a food court was. STRONG lamb flavor in the soup. Yummy meat. Man if only this place was anything close. Everything was everything but strong but quite opposite. 

Service was ok. The 3rd waitress that helped us with our order ended up helping our table for the rest of the night. The other ones seemed to be just standing around. She was mildly attentive to our waters, filling it up when it was near empty. 

There was also a guy who walked in from the entrance either video recording or video chatting with someone. Seemed kind of weird. He walked around the entire restaurant corner to corner with it going. 

Anyway, unfortunately, for the food, nothing special, or if anything, even that good. Probably won't come back again unless their recipes get re-vamped. I understand how people don't like strong lamb flavors but dang, it was borderline mild to nothing. Friend said their beef sirloin noodle soup base was more decent but still mild. Rather prefer to go to Noodle Man or Shang's Artisan for similar.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,3,2,KSUbJgEalzl4__6hCPmtFg

1633627,2018-02-09,0,K1SzOXV70qDbcq6T64PZsw,"Went to this place few weeks back.  With all the nice noodle places open in Vegas, this place is not competitive at all. 

The servers are like zombies.  They are talking in front of customers but when you need them, they are not very responsive. 

The noodle itself is good.  
The soup is not very impressive.  It taste like water down by the noodle.  I need add some salt and pepper to make it more tasteful.  

Here is the reason I will not go back.  We ordered an appetizer ""spicy chicken gizzard"" and it came after the noodle.  This is not a good sign.  The dish taste like old left over and recooked.  I can tell from two different type of oil from just taste it.  

Credit card receipt shows Craw-fish restaurant which cause me a 30 minutes phone call with credit card company.  At least the music was good.  



PS:  There are several restaurants offer free appetizer for a positive Yelp review.  So Some of the review that is short and sweet might not represent the true dinning experiences.

I went back to this place yesterday.  The food shows great improvement.  The previously mentioned servers were no where to be found.

1989410,2018-01-23,1,K1SzOXV70qDbcq6T64PZsw,"More like 2.5 stars but I'll be nice and round up to 3. As previous reviews have stated, this restaurant is located inside the Chinatown mall. I've lived in Vegas for 18 years now and this particular restaurant has changed so many times. I feel like every time I'm here, it's a different restaurant. This is actually my first time stepping foot into this spot mainly because my friend wanted to try it, and I never really had the desire to try the previous ones. 

The workers here speaks mainly Mandarin. Here is where I wished I had paid more attention in my Mandarin classes in college (I speak Cantonese, and the only thing I can say in Mandarin is ""I will treat you to dinner"" which was totally not helpful in this situation). There was a language barrier with our waiter when we tried to redeem the Yelp check-in offer (free tea egg or buns). It took a while for us to communicate to each other until she finally got another waiter that spoke some English and was able to help us redeem the offer. They didn't have the tea egg so we got the buns. 

Appetizer:
- Pig ears: I thought these were alright. It was too salty for me whatever they placed on top. You can also tell it's been frozen before (pic attached)

Main course:
- Traditional beef sirloin noodle soup: the noodles were the knife cut ones and it was cooked well. It had nice consistency and was not mushy at all. The beef was tender and had nice flavor. However, the broth was way too bland. I'm used to a much more beef-flavored broth and this wasn't it. 

Dessert:
- we ate the buns as dessert since it had custard in the middle. My custard bun was alright. It was forgettable. 

Side note: this place used to be called Spicy Crawfish. They still have the signs for that. The water cups have the Spicy Crawfish logo and even the receipt is labeled the same. I feel like if you're going to change the name of a restaurant, don't change just half of it...it's confusing.",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,4,2,3,2wS2mST-laZIE_EVzxERaQ

2876818,2018-03-16,0,K1SzOXV70qDbcq6T64PZsw,"Went here with my parents after hearing about a steamed  all you can eat food place. I didn't know what a steamed all you can eat is, but decided to check it out. For $30 you have a large selection of meats and seafood to choose from. The process is fairly simple. Underneath the steamer the workers pour in grains of rice so that when you steam your seafood and meats the juices drip down forming the rice into congee. The menu is very simple and tells you how long each item should be steamed for. The reason for the 3 stars is because the place is difficult to find (located inside the Chinatown mall), meat and seafood were not fresh at all, the timer to set the steamer was not working properly, and staff was not attentive. Overall, I would only go back to this place is if my friends wanted to go.

Pros:

- Unique concept
- Place is clean
- staff is friendly
-menu tells you how long to steam the items for

Cons

- Location is hard to find
- food was not fresh when we went 
- staff wasn't very attentive

5349087,2018-01-27,1,K1SzOXV70qDbcq6T64PZsw,"Came here one night with my husband and some friends to give this place a try. I saw it pop up on Yelp as a new restaurant so naturally we would want to give it a try. Even better? It's NOODLES. I LOVE NOODLES.

The establishment is located inside the Chinatown mall in the Chinatown plaza. It's in the same mall that No. 1 Boba Tea is located at. I used to be a crawfish place? I was super confused because everything on the outside did not suggest that it was a noodle place. They had signs for all you can eat steam pots. And everything in the restaurant still had their old name: Spicy Crawfish. 

We stood there for a good 5-10 minutes before anyone noticed us. It wasn't busy in there at all. And when the waitress finally saw us, she rushed over to us. Apparently you can choose to eat the all you can eat steam pot or you can get XiangXiang noodles. So they're two restaurants in one? Who knows. 

XiangXiang Noodles specializes in the knife cut type of noodles. So they're the wide noodles that are not too thin and not too thick. XiangXiang is supposed to also have other types of noodles, such as regular round noodles and buckwheat noodles. However, the night that we went, they only had the knife cut noodles. Perhaps they are still new and haven't been able to get everything that is on their menu? 

There is a check offer! You get tea eggs or buns. That's assuming that whoever you talked to even know what you're talking about. I showed it to our second waitress, she said yes but then she called for help. A guy showed up and clearly did not know what was going on and he just asked if we spoke Mandarin. We did not. We speak Cantonese. They decided to call our first waitress over because she spoke Cantonese. I asked if there were tea eggs and she said they only had the buns available. They were kind enough to give us five buns -- one for each of us. The buns are sweet egg yolk buns though so if you don't like that type of bun then be sure to pawn it off!

Also, this server seems to be the only one who is working. I suppose that mainly rides on the fact she is the only server that can speak some English. 

I ended up getting one of their specials: lamb with quail egg noodle soup while my husband went with the traditional beef sirloin noodle soup. Just based on their noodles alone, they were perfect. The noodles were done really well and had just the right about of bite to it. Keep in mind, with their special bowl of noodles, they also put glass noodles in there as well as seaweed. 

The soup base, on the other hand, was on the lighter side. If you like lighter soups then this would be for you. However, I was expecting a heavier flavor. I love lamb and I've been wanting some really good lamb noodles but to make it good, you need a really good base. I once tried a fantastic lamb soup filled with lamb flavor and XiangXiang, unfortunately, falls short. It's understandable though -- not a lot of people like the taste or the smell of lamb. But honestly ... if you don't like lamb but you're getting lamb noodles, you can see yourself out. 

We also shared the wood eared mushroom appetizer and it was pretty nice. I mean, it's normal .. there isn't anything bad or spectacular with it. Just a nice and light appetizer. 

Overall, it's a pretty average place. It's a pretty average yet confusing place. Service was pretty decent after we ordered because the initial confusion is gone -- they kept our waters filled. I'm not too sure if we'll return only because, well, there are better options in the city.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,1,2,3,VlL_fF8reXeGaT0lAMD-zA

Hubby had the fried noodle, he thought it was just so-so and liked mine better. He really liked the broth of my soup.  I liked it too. It was full-bodied and the pork was SUPER tender and tasty. Both of us agreed that on both dishes the noodles were over-cooked and veering on mushy. That was very disappointing. They really need to work on getting that al dente. 

We would come back if it wasn't for the severe MSG usage which totally conked us out on the couch when we got home! That was the biggest disappointment.

Probably will have stick with Noodle Man.
