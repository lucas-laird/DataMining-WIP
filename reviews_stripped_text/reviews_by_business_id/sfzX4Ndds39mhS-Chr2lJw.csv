They were a big hit back then and then they switched to DeMarcos (and the quality went down) because of some personal issues of the owner.

Then the economy took a hit and they closed their doors. Another restaurant came in and quickly closed its doors too. I wasnt sad about that because it wasnt very good. Then a good budy of mine let me know that Don Antonios re-opened. I was really excited and so was the rest of my family. We went in for dinner (party of 5) and it was bad. The first item I ordered was not available that night so I chose the Dons roasted lemon half chicken. The food took a very long time to come out of the kitchen about 50 minutes and when it arrived they served me a grilled chicken breast. Not what I ordered. The server told me that they were also out of the roasted half chicken and that some one should have told me. I guess sooo. The three pastas we ordered had soooo much garlic they were inedible and the meatball soup had no meatballs. We complained and the following day I called and spoke with one of the owndes Don. He made it seem as if my complaints were not really valid and I was an amature diner. I happen to be a chef for the last 24 yrs. I explained to him that I well understand the way a restaurant runs and that my expectations are based on where I am eating. I dont expect to sit in a 3 michelin star restaurant and get fed in 30 min but I do expect a place like Don Antonios to get 2 courses out faily quickly (not drive thru quick) but you get my drift. So he invited us back to give his place another shot. It was great. Both the food and the service. So we returned again tonight ready for another good meal. Not to be...First off the bruscetta that we ordered had so much garlic it could have killed a horse. We sent it back to the kitchen only to here Don shout ""they should have ordered it light garlic if thats what they wanted. Thats rude! They made us another plate and it was much better. Then our entrees arrived. My son and I both got the same entree the chicken franchaise. It was sooo salty it was inedible but that wasnt the worst part of it. My sons chicken was raw. He ate 2 bites and then noticed that it was really mushy. I asked for our check and for our server to please take the chicken into the kitchen to let them know they could have made my son sick. She spoke with Don and then returned to let us know that their would be no charge. I tipped her and left. I was really disapointed not only in the food but Dons attitude. As a restaurant owner when a customer returns raw chicken to the kitchen the owner should go talk to the table and appologize. Not send an embarassed server to that for you! I will be calling the health dept in the morning to let them know about my experience",XkWo8OXMWQUcYRbhiIbA6w,2,0,1,V3Ey51jwOBwljpJuq-F6XQ

Unfortunately - first impression was BAD. They made the pizza then smashed it down into a box that was made for a thin crust pizza. Seriously? When we questioned what happened, they offered to make us a new pizza - which meant sitting there for another 30 minutes waiting for it. No thank you.

At the end of the day, pissed off at the experience and no money off for the bad move on their part - the pizza tasted ""ok"" but was a complete goopy mess. In hind sight, we should have left the pizza there and walked out.

I got food poising from eating the Italian wedding soup. It was the first time that I had ever eaten it, and I decided to try something new. I didn't get to eat my eggplant Parmesan which is what I normally order cause I got full off of the soup.  I work on call and got called into work. I left the restaurant around 4 pm. I arrived at work around 7pm. My stomach started bothering about 30 minutes before, but I didn't feel totally bad so I went to start my shift. around 7:15 pm I started throwing up and didn't stop until the ambulance showed up at my job and gave me anti nausea meds in an IV. 

The next day I called the restaurant to report what happened. I call to speak with the manager after spending the night in the hospital to voice what happened and my first call was ill received by the waitress that took my first message. After I called three days later to speak with the manager. I got blown off saying that they would have the owners contact me and they never returned my call. Since I wasn't insured. I missed a night of work. The hospital and ambulance is billing me for $5000. Needless to say I will not be eating there again. 

But since no one that we know of reported getting sick but me. It was an isolated incident, and one I won't forget. What I was hoping for was an apology, and at least an offer to find out what happened.

I mean, I know a lot happened, you opened, then you closed, then you opened under a different name in a new location, then you opened back up in the old location. But the most important thing is you're back! And we were excited that you were back! You were the best! You offered great food at a decent price. Service was never your forte, but it was at least bearable. We brought people from many miles away to your restaurant because you were that good. On a lazy Saturday night we ordered your food and rented a movie and considered it a ""perfect"" night. On Fathers Day we brought Pops by to enjoy the lunch special because that's what he wanted...but things have changed...

So we came back, after so many years of loyalty there was no doubt that we'd be back. In the interim we hit up Mama D's and the food was great, tasted just like Don's. This time around, in the old, but new venue we ordered our traditional favorites. #1 on the list was the Fettuccine Carbonara. Back then, the sauce was better than some of the finer dining options in this city. So the excitement to eat this bowl of awesomeness was brewing. My frown was not turned upside down though. It was bad. Bad in nearly every possible way. The sauce was flat, tasted nothing like the ""olden days."" The bread prior to the meal became tasteless breadsticks. Gone are the days of Oil & Vinegar at the table. The meatball calzone we ordered had 6x's the amount of ricotta cheese to the mozzarella that was in there. The service was bad. It took a while to get a drink order in, then another 15 minutes to get salads, then another 30 minutes to get entrees. This was on a Friday night when the place wasn't even a 1/4 full. 

Something has changed. The meal felt effortless, and that more than anything is what bothers me most. I don't know if the challenging ways of today's economy has gotten the best of ol' Don Antonio and his famous recipes, or if a new chef was hired, or what the heck happened. But whatever it is, I want the old Don Antonio's back, and I want it now! Do it right, or don't do it at all. This should be a one star review but Don has some street cred with me. I hope Don Antonio's returns to it's old glory, otherwise this guy is riding off into the sunset never to return again.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,8,3,2,SOQX0vamk0REGwwKTdNeHg

The problem is the leadership at this restaurant. We eat here almost weekly and 90% of the time we have an excellent meal and 30% of the time we have great service. I hate that it is so hit and miss. The food is quality and the recepes are excellent. 
We were there last night and the place was packed (not the usual). There was one waitress and Tom the cook. The waitress was getting drink orders and my son was thinking. The waitress said, ""Hey I am the only one here so what are you going to have"". We should have walked then. My wifes order, ham calzone with no ricotta cheese lightly cooked, was completly wrong. We received a sausage calzone with ricotta cheese over cooked. There was no way we could wait for another one. They took it off our bill. Tom came by to explain how he gave our order to someone else but he did not seem as pissed off as I would have been if I owned the place and now 2 customers had wrong orders.
Why do we continue to go back? We still beleive that this can be a really great place if they got quality wait staff and proper coverage in the kitchen. They need one of those restaurant make over shows to come in. They start putting chairs up on tables an hour before they close while customers are still eating. They seem to be out of more and more items on the menu. The wait staff is all part time and do not have the passion or the experience to serve. The kitchen staff, Tom, is over worked and is a heart attack waiting to happen. Tom, stay in the kitchen. That is where your strength is. Hire a proper restaurant manager who knows how to serve the customer. You will be packed every night! I hope everyone gives this place a try or a retry because they get it right most of the time.

The meaning of ""solid"" is a place that has very few flaws and will be a strong operating business for a while... I could not have been further off.

Ever since the original owner left this location it has snowballed downhill fast.  Upon entering today the entire additional bar area was closed; only the restaurant side remains open.  Alas, the bathroom on the restaurant side is closed but the bar side bathroom is open (a little inconvenient).  

The staff is well below the quality it was during it's opening few months.  The restaurant itself is dead during lunch hours.  The menu is half as unique as it used to be... very simple easy to prepare items all over the menu.  Lunch specials aren't special at all.

3104219,2008-06-22,0,sfzX4Ndds39mhS-Chr2lJw,"Excellent value. 

Innocuous little place in yet another architecturally bland, semi-occupied Las Vegas strip mall.  I had the lunch special, an 8"" pizza with one topping and salad.  The salad was straightforward, with minimal frills but fresh lettuce, tomatoes and a pepperoncini with the stem already removed (a nice touch I have never seen before).  The pizza was a bit oily, but that's why it's called pizza - and the thin crust pizza was nice and chewy.  It could have used some more sausage, but at $7.99 for the lunch special pair, I'd still say it was an excellent deal.  

Service was fine, and I had no issues of promptness (but the place was only about 30% full).  The place was clean, and assuming the bathroom was representative, it was well taken care of and/or brand new.  The fixtures were uninspiring (the tables reminiscent of what you'd see in a big chain like TGI Fridays).  I'd heartily recommend Don Antonio's to friends for a solid, non-fussy, good value dining experience, especially for lunch.  I can't find a single bad thing to say about my experience at DA's, the food was satisfying and there's particularly strong value in the lunch specials menu.

The sauce wasn't really to our liking; it seemed they had way too much oregano because we tasted it the next day! Overall, the pizza was very good and we will go there again - maybe we will just skip the sauce!",Vth2iRVJE6rnovR2OcdNog,0,0,4,LkQJ7LxEF1U4Jw1z09lnhQ

Whatever you do you must get the garlic knots. Hands down the best I've ever had. Also a fan of the Italian Wedding soup they make from scratch here. Pizza is decent, too although I can't rate it in my top five. I need to give them another try at that. Pasta dishes are incredible. The gravy is well developed in taste and texture. Definitely would like to try more like the eggplant or chicken parm. Service is friendly, too.

Overall a great place to dine in the neighborhood. You can tell because on any given night it will be packed with locals. 

If Italian food is your thing or good food is your thing than this is a great restaurant to check out. Just don't kiss me with that garlic breath.

On a side note I feel I need to create a new list called: GARLIC BREATH and/or TOOTIE BOOTY.

It took about a half an hour.  The pizza could have arrived hotter than it was, but it was an easy fix with a few minutes in the oven.

We had a Sicilian Pizza with meatballs, sausage & cappicola.
It was tasty, but not nearly as good as my favorite place in NY.
None of the pizza west coast is though.  To be expected.

I also had a house salad.  It was ok.  Not terribly crispy or exciting.
Their bleu cheese dressing left something to be desired.

Their cannolis were tasty & crips, if not a bit too bland, but not too sweet.

I ordered the cheese lasagna lunch special, and made a point to make sure there was no meat inside, nor was there any meat in the sauce as I am a vegetarian. When my lasagna arrived it was covered with meat sauce. My server immediately took it back to the kitchen and not five minutes later arrived with a fresh piece of lasagna sans the meat (sauce). I double checked the inside and lo and behold - pieces of sausage were nestled in between the folds of cheese and pasta.  When I brought this to her attention, she said she would have another one made for me. By this point my boyfriend was already halfway through his meal, and I was a little frustrated so I declined and asked her to just charge me my drink and salad that was included in the lunch special. She returned with a piece of tiramisu (also very good), and the check which had my lunch order omitted, so I was appreciative of both gestures. I would have given a five star review, but the two mix ups deterred me. However, I do appreciate the efforts taken to rectify the situation, and what food I did eat was good.

On the way out of Vegas we stopped in here and they weren't open yet but were catering a private event.
We were ready to walk out and the guy,Don says. ""Wait a minute,were you just going to have pizza?""
""yes"" we replied
He sat us down we asked if we could get salad too and he got the salad and served it to us as if we were his own personal house guests. The Italian dressing was to die for served with fresh baked Italian bread that was the most perfect texture of light and crispy outside and melt in your 
Mouth on the inside.
Our pizza arrived just as I pushed my empty salad plate away.
I could tell by looking at it that it was going to be exquisite and I was not disappointed.
This was the best new York pizza I've ever eaten topping some of the most well known places I've eaten in new York.the crust was perfectly crispy flaky and the cheese was so fresh you'd think they keep the cow our back and make it fresh every morning. As we are finishing up we tell Don how happy we are and compliment the food and he shares with us that his chef has won many awards for his food and asked us where we live. We tell him where we are from and that we came here to celebrate my birthday;he immediately grabs an ice cream cup and scoops a large scoop of butter pecan ice cream for me. Seriously? This is too cool!
We then tried to square up the check and he won't take our money. He insists that it's on the house and just tell our friends what we thought of his food.
I give him a hug and thank him and my boyfriend shakes his hand. As we say goodbye he asks us to wait and walks to the back. Returning with a hat he hands it to my boyfriend and says ""I like people who appreciate things, this is for you, wear it in California""
We will definitely go back. For the amazing food, for the atmosphere and to visit our new friend who made us feel at home.",2C332rExhdaj2_oxkEjU5g,1,1,5,p4BUsiszuztah0KiG83eRQ

From talking to the waitress, the switch happened on December 4th (or maybe January 4th, I forget).  For those that don't know, this location used to be Don Antonio's but then went out of business and became DiMartino's.  Don Antonio's took their business a few blocks south and became Mama D's.  Mama D's had the same menu as Don Antonio's did, but was more of a to-go type of place instead of a sit-down restaurant.

The menu is much larger than DiMartino's is and more affordable.

The best part about this place is the lunch specials.  Today, for $5.99 I got bread (all you can eat), salad, lasagna, and a soda.  I was very full.

It took a while to get our food today.  It looked like there was only one cook in the kitchen.  That's the only reason why this isn't a 5 star review.

I have after trying out Don Antonio's.

Sure, it has a hole in the wall feel and because it's grown popular quickly, has the shoulder-to-shoulder feel of a subway, but that gives it its charm.

While its pizza would probably fall just below excellent to me, they win huge points in this market full of Chicagoan and New Yorkers by serving BOTH thin crust and deep dish.

But the rest of the HUGE menu in this place is just some of the best tasting Italian food in town. And the prices are pretty good too.

4540313,2014-01-18,0,sfzX4Ndds39mhS-Chr2lJw,"This is a place we will not give a second chance.  

This place was chosen by my neice for my sisters birthday.  My neice called & told them how many we would be & what time we would arrive.  I was the first to arrive & the lady who met me at the door who also turned out too be our server, my neice was supposed to call back & give her an exact number.  When my neice arrive she again repeated this to which my neice said she did call & tell them a definite number.  Either way, nothing was set up for us & they had to put tables together so we could be seated.

As soon as we sat down we were immediately told they were out of Calamari, Ribs, Veal & something else, REALLY??? Someone obviously does not know how to manage the supply of this place.  The place was not real crowded but there were a few other tables seated.  We watched her run around for a while & finally I asked if I can order a drink.  She said yes, took a few drink orders & left without asking anyone else.  After I got my drink at least 10 minutes passed before she came back & asked everyone else if they wanted a drink.  Drinks were ordered & then some asked for bread.  WELL, we were told bread was $1 a loaf unless we ordered food & then it would come with our dinner, REALLY???

Almost 15 more minutes passed before she came back & asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered our food & our server decided instead of offering us the choice of soup or salad, she would just bring two big salads to the table.  Two people wanted soup instead of salad & this really annoyed our server.  Also some people asked for straws because they were not offered with the drinks to which she went & grabbed a handful & threw them on the table.  NICE TOUCH!!!  The salads came along with the soup but still NO BREAD.  As we were finishing the salad, one person in our party asked if we were going to get bread & she said it was in the oven.  The bread finally came just before the food came out & the next disaster began.  Some of the food was over cooked, some asked for vegetables, no pasta or potatoes & this request was totally ignored.  Supposedly they have a Potato/Broccoli mix, well SURPRISE, they were out of Broccoli so a tiny bit of spinach was substituted with the potatoes that several DID NOT AsK FOR.

The entire night you had to ask for refills as they were not automatic & after the food came out some big guy roaming around looking lost came to our table to ask if everything was ok?  We told him it was as he looked clueless & nothing would be accomplished by telling him anyway.  We watched him walk around & just chat with people at tables never offering to bring more drink or anything.  There were two servers, one seemed to be stuck with all the tables in the place with the other occasionally helping but when asked for more drinks, she brought one out & then went in back & started yelling for our server???  TEAM WORK is not part of this place that is for sure.  

Once all the plates were taken off the table, two plates with cannoli's were brought & literally just dropped on the table with a, ""I decided to just bring the table cannoli's instead of taking desert orders"".  Nothing was offered to my sister for her birthday, no candle nothing.   Finally at the end my sister who I guess has been here been her before asked the two servers who owned this place & what was the issue.  They said one of the owners is still a guy named Tony, but he took 3 or 4 days off for the first time in years.  Well if this place can go to crap with ONE of the owners gone, Tony should consider getting new partners.  The entire experience made you feel like family they had no desire seeing or coming over for dinner.  Even if things were a little shaky with Tony gone, unless Tony is the only one who cooks, there is no excuse for OVERCOOKED  food.  The cooks should cook the same every night.  The clueless guy did come & talk to my wife about her overcooked burnt chicken & after she explained the issue, he said I will take care of this.  They took her dish off our bill.

OH, the BEST PART  OF THE NIGHT, just as we were finishing our dinner food, a table of about 6 came in & sat behind us.  After they ordered they were told that the there was NO MORE CHICKEN, they had run out of CHICKEN???  REALLY???  This is one of the main items on the menu as there are several chicken dishes.  We were told this was a slow period for them & they BLEW IT.. IF the service can be this frightening with 6 or 7 items off the menu because they ran out, the busy high times must really suck for this place.  Then the bill came & 20% was added for tip automatically into the bill.  This was service, food or experience warranting a 10% tip.  They are going to charge you 20% which actually is now against the law or soon to be & charge you for a basket of bread.  This is a place going down hill fast.

Absolutely Outstanding on every level.  Serious! 

Ignore the ""hater"" reviews.  This is one of those out of the way Vegas places that pleases you to the point of goose bumps.  Again... Serious!

Sitting with my wife and two children, 13yo & 11yo, and looking around after the meal I had this warm fuzzy feeling in my gut that's hard to explain.

Ambiance.  Outside walking in?  Not so good.  Strip mall parking lot... ick!  However, you enter a new world once inside.  Checkerboard tablecloths?  Check!  Open kitchen for viewing?  Check!   Clean, warm, Mediterranean atmosphere?  Double Check!  The photos attached above are good and give an indication of what you're going to encounter but once you're there, it's even better.  A LOT better!

The good vibes were flowing through me upon entering and only went through the roof from there.  I read some of these reviews and still went there.  Bad service and rude employees?  Puh-LEEEZ!  Over the top and out of control NICE and POLITE to the extent that an off duty waitress chatted with us Montanan's for 20 minutes when she could have been en route home.

Before I get to the Pizza, I'll start with the Sausage & Peppers in gravy (red ragu).  Our kids normally wouldn't touch this dish.  We couldn't keep them off it.  Even the pepers and onions they were all over.  Good thing I didn't tell them what they were eating LOL =]

That dish was delicious and we treated it like an appetizer.  Not spicy at all which at first disappointed me but later I appreciated it for what it was.  A tad sweet with a tangy aftertaste.  Wonderful.

The pizza however is off the hook (I'm 46 so it's really something for me to use this phrase).  It doesn't matter what pizza you order.  The secret is in the dough and crust of the pizza.

Most may not recognize greatness when they taste and chew it.  This crust is the best you can get bar none.  Here's the test.... when your pizza arrives and is hot out of the oven, take a slice an place in on your plate.  Before you dive into the section with all the toppings, rip off an enormous hung of the back end of dough that doesn't have any cheese, sauce or toppings on it.  As you bite in to the crust, you'll enjoy that wonderful sensation of ""crunch"" from the outer shell of the crust but that's not from being over cooked.  There's no crumbling of dough to the table from your mouth like a piece of dry toast.  The crunch is the result of a masterfully designed crust that is followed by a chewyness that only bubble gum can compete with.

You can't appreciate the crust with all the cheese and toppings on it so try it before you dive in to the heart of your slice just to see how how good it is.  Then, when you attack the pizza you ordered you'll have more appreciation for the pizza as a whole instead of judging it solely on the toppings and cheese which may, or may not be up to your standards.  Let's face it:  Every pizza place chooses different types of cheeses and toppings of varying quality.  My type of pizza sausage does not match what some restaurants decide to serve.  That's not their fault.

But I digress....  You want a good pizza?  Come here and order one.  And go simple.  Choose a topping or two that you love, try the crust before digging in, then enjoy a spectacular meal the likes of which are hard to find in the pizza world.",RNKwQjJ3cKRUnsaTjB7NrQ,1,1,5,QC1S5-NDCOqBreSUmcD_iA

Eaten there 3 times. Not treated like family by the owner

1st time a Saturday: a wonderful singer entertained the room, had pizza and chicken parm that was very good. The bread and knots are freshly baked, ask for the balsamic and olive oil for dipping, its great.

2nd time a Thursday: came with family to celebrate my daughter's birthday. I had the veal piccata.  There were 4 of us, the portions were smaller. The owner walked by twice but never said anything to us although we had 4 meals and 2 bottles of wine, and we were the only customers there. The waitress provided cannoli and they sang to her :-)

3rd time a Friday: had veal piccatta and fettucine alfredo. Enjoyed the fresh bread. Again the owner was there, and again he said nothing. Again, I was the only diner.

I'll be back at least once more to use my last groupon.

I finally mustered up the courage to step in and try this Italian eatery. The moment I stepped in I could see the open kitchen and the baked deserts. The place smelled great and the hostess was less than friendly. She must have had a bad day or something. The second thing I noticed about the restaurant were the red and white checker pattern table. Now, usually the tables have a red and white checker table cloth, but not this one, nope, these tables had the red and white check directly embedded into the table. A little odd indeed, but I didn't think too much of it. 

Food:

They started the table with some warm bread and butter. It wasn't anything fantastic but I definitely held me over before my appetizer and entree came. I had their BBQ drumettes, and the 8in NY pizza with chicken. I like the idea that they separate the wings and drumettes, I like that I can choose which one I want. When the food arrived it looked very good. The drumettes were crispy and juicy in the inside the BBQ sauce was very tangy. The pizza was not the greatest. To me they over topped the pizza with too much chicken it kind of held back the taste of the pizza. Perhaps their regular cheese would have been a better choice?  

Service:

The waitress, Allison, was extremely nice and anticipated all my needs before I asked for anything. When the wings came out she knew that my hands would be messy and brought me a warm towel since they didn't have moist towelettes. To me, as small as it is, is a great sign of good service. I can't remember the last time a waitress took that initiative to do something like that without someone asking for it. When I finished my meal and my check came out, I asked her for a refill of my drink, and she asked me if I wanted a to go cup instead. I happily obliged and thanked her for her great service and anticipating my needs.  

Quality:

The only thing that worries me about the quality of food is how vast their menu is. To me, a shorter, more concise menu would have been better. The chefs wouldn't have remember as much and the food quality would definitely increase. 

Final thoughts:

Don Antonio's is a breath of fresh air especially with the vast amount of really bad Italian eateries around Vegas. With a little bit of more concentration for the food quality, they will no doubt do a lot better. Their service is great and I have no complaints in that department. As for a Italian restaurant that caters to the locals, they are doing a great job. I hope they keep up the good service because that alone will bring people back. I will look forward to trying other things on their menu in the near future.",VUrTgQhEB4Vo04xbnNiNyQ,3,1,4,ot2--OuwDtA5iwRzB6cDvg
