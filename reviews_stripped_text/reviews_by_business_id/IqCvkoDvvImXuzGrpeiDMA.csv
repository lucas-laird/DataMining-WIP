65666,2015-09-01,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I came here September 1, 2015 for their advertised happy hour with $2.00 tacos!

Upon arrival, the happy hour menu had changed to $3.00 tacos. The advertising outside of the restaurant on the Tvs still said $2.00 tacos. After speaking with my lovely waitress Connie, she said that the happy hour menu had just changed today but the PR team didn't make any of the changes. It makes the restaurant look poorly managed and like they don't have their stuff together.

As far as the food;
Tacos
Al pastor- adobo pork, pineapple jicama salsa: it was the size of my palm, felt small for what I was getting but was flavorful
Ensenada fish- cabbage slaw, chipotle tartar sauce, crema: fried block of fish with the sauce and slaw on top. It was also the size of my palm and it was ok

Mushroom tinga quesadilla- marinated mushrooms in a quesadilla with oaxacan cheese, guajillo sauce and blue corn tortilla- this was delicious. Full of flavor

Service
My waitress Connie was lovely! Very attentive and she felt horribly about the false happy hour advertising.

My only recommendation would be that when they bring out the chips and three salsas that they explain each sauce and what they are.",qqiMvpTgiNTr7WGLU7sYwQ,1,0,3,p4iekVxiLD2P565BxqiCuw

The first time I got the ribeye steak that was great, but the side (purple potatoes) were really starchy. The second time I got tacos. The carne asada was ok and the shrimp was fishy tasting. The guacamole is good, but nothing amazing. The ceviche was good.

226385,2015-08-15,1,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"The reviews puzzle me - we went for happy hour, and I've never been more disappointed with a meal.  The tamales tasted like creamed corn (and JUST creamed corn), the quesadilla was fine, but it tasted only like mushrooms - there was no trace of the highly anticipated huitaloche that was in the description, and the tacos were bland and boring.  The Margaritas were just 'mix' - nothing authentic at all. I liked the chipoltle salsa, and the tomatillo salsa was good too - but that was the only redeeming quality.  

It tasted like really bad tex-mex - not Mexican food, and not even good Tex-Mex.  I don't get the hype!  Substantially disappointed - I'm very glad we returned our travelzoo coupon to try happy hour instead, or else I'd have been even more upset!",JSaJ3gRpizQjWDgUYpE8Ug,0,0,1,thJp4vKZA6f1bCd7-TQcpQ

Even though we just had Mexican food the night before we decided to look at the menu anyway.  The greeters informed us about the high quality ingredients, attention to detail, etc.  I told them I didn't see anything on menu of particular interest.  Without skipping a beat, I was asked ""what would you like?""

This was unexpected.  No restaurant, especially before sitting at a table, had ever asked me that. I said ""ok...how about 3 cheese enchiladas?""  She said, ""ok..we have 3 cheezes, what kind of sauce do you prefer...red or green?"" When I said I've no idea, she told my friend and I to have a seat at a table and she'd bring me some samples to taste so I that could choose.

I mean really?  I've never had such customer service BEFORE ordering a meal.  
To cut to the chase.....my food (3 cheeze enchiladas with chicken filling, and my friends food (short rib enchiladas) were both outstanding.  The watermelon lemonade is to die for.  I could go on writing postive things about this place, but I'd rather you take my advice and if you're hungry, go have something to eat at the Border Grill.  You'll be glad you did.

Update: 8/28/16 and 8/31/16

Since we had such a great experience in 2015, we decided to return for early dinners on the above dates.  The food and the experience was just as outstanding as our previous review.
Be sure that you try the strawberry lemonade and the sorbet sampler for desert.
During our dinner, we started chatting with the people sitting next to us and amazingly they lived near Chicago just like us.  We had a great time chatting.

765365,2017-07-06,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"It pains me to write this review. I've been a huge Border Grill fan for many years and faithfully trekked from one end of the strip all the way to Mandalay Bay every time we visited to enjoy their food. Some times we went twice in one visit. We have 2 of their cookbooks. 

So when the location at The Forum opened up a couple years ago, we were beyond excited to have a closer location. And it was pretty darn good, at first. Not quite up to the same level as the Mandalay location.

We were in Vegas in February 2017 and went for brunch. Which we've done many times before. They were very understaffed that day so waits were long. The few wait staff they did have that day were busting their butts to serve all the tables. Some of our food got messed up but they were trying. So we didn't make a big deal out of it and assumed it was a one-time thing. Both of us suffered from some heart burn and gastro-intestinal distress later in the day. I just assumed I over-indulged and vowed to take it a little easier the next time.

We were back in Vegas last week and after the last brunch experience, decided to skip brunch and just go for dinner one night. To ensure we didn't over-indulge, hubby and I decided to split an appetizer and an entree. 

The tamale appetizer was just ok. For the entree, we went with the pork carnitas (one of our favorite dishes). And  omg, the carnitas were soooo dry and lacking in flavor. I started pouring the salsa for the chips on it just to give it some moisture. I was so disappointed. This is not the Border Grill I know and love.

But the worst was yet to come. Within an hour of leaving, both hubby and I got severe heart burn. It was bad. And my stomach was so upset for several hours, I really thought I was going to get sick. Actually, I think I might have felt better. We went back to our room much earlier than anticipated and tried all the over the counter medications we could take hoping to relieve the heart burn and discomfort. But we were both pretty miserable for several hours and unfortunately it ruined the rest of our evening...and it was a Saturday night in Vegas to boot.

Now that it's happened twice, it's no longer a coincidence. The quality is just not the same. I will not return to this one. And honestly, I'm hesitant to even go back to the Mandalay location. Not worth the risk of the physical discomfort and ruining another day of my vacation.

So sad!",mPAH4VK6Kk0IGEleh25oSQ,0,0,2,08nRLUtewDlNl7m56K767Q

They truly made our night at Border Grill an amazing and unforgettable experience! My sister and I wanted to take our cousin, who was flying back to New York later that night, to a truly unique Vegas restaurant. We decided to take her to Border Grill and we could not be happier with our choice! We started off with the green corn tamales which were to die for. We also ordered the fish tacos, kale salad, caramelized plantains and baked cauliflower side dishes, All of which could be eaten family style and shared. I would also definitely recommend their ceviche, it was fresh and you can order two different preparations to try. I also had their blood orange sangria which was delicious! I highly recommend having one of those! The service is outstanding and we stayed and lingered over our meal for several hours. We did not feel like we were being rushed. Jill, the manager was so friendly, attentive and really made us feel at home in her restaurant. I will be coming back with my husband to enjoy their famous brunch! I can't wait!

Service was mediocre at best. I didn't set the bar too high because I seen the spotty glasses and silverware.  Not a good sign when you walk in to a place. Hostesses seemed lost and we're more concerned with gossip than helping. We didn't expect for four star service but we did expect our server to see how we were on our cold food. But alas no one came by. I did flagged down a manager and notified them my food wasn't hot and he took it away but by this time my friends was cold as well, since she was polite and was waiting so we could eat together. After receiving our food hot, we never seen Hyde nor hare of our server or manager. Enough said. 

Food... well again a good attempt at trying. Not really mexican more tex mex, but it had always been that style. Guacamole was ok. Lacked salt and acid. The shorty enchiladas were ok, but too much sauce made the tortilla mushy. Rice was hard like it was in a steam table for hours. Beans were dry and not a lot of flavor either. 

Overall...maybe they are just getting their footing and I will be back in the near future to try again. I do miss the old border. Much more intimate with the chef and staff , but hinges do change. Hopefully it can get back to what BG was years ago.",9btvskLk2yjJZiaehqmT9A,1,0,2,3ne5txrDoWxidcafJBxJnQ

I said, ""I'll have the shrimp tacos.""  He replied, ""no, no you won't, you'll have the chicken pablano enchiladas.""  Ummm, okay, I'm easy.  Good suggestion, this dish was amazing.  Fresh chips and three different salsas were brought to the table and they were really good too.

When a restaurant is that good you have to have dessert, right?  I ordered the flan and it too was great.  It was wearing a lovely halo of candied sugar.  Hard to describe but really interesting and creative.  I took a photo but it doesn't do it justice.

Will definitely return.  Saw some people eating a small plates brunch and that looked good so might have to try that next time.

1192073,2015-01-22,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"After having eaten at the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay, we knew we had to make the trip here to check out this one. 

First of all, the location: this restaurant may not be in the most convenient place to stumble upon. If you're going here from the front desk, this will be a bit of a trek, but that's totally okay because it works up that appetite, so you can devour even more food. It's worth finding. 

Second, the decor: it is just the right blend of casual and classy. I felt comfortable here, and I enjoyed the fact that the glasses and light boxes were Mary Sue's husband's design. 

Third, the service: their staff is incredibly attentive and friendly. They were accommodating and efficient. 

Finally, the food: the variety of salsas is always welcome. I love being able to try each one and find your favorite. Personally, I love the spicier one that can be brought out when requested. The chile relleno burger is incredibly messy, but it is such a unique burger and an incredibly good one. The only complaints we could find with it were that we wish the chile relleno was a little bigger, and the burger wasn't quite as smashed down. But that being said, you really can't complain too much -- it's quality food. The carne asada quesadilla is fantastic. It's flavorful, and a lunch that could last me the rest of the day. The corazon lemonade is incredibly. Easily the best I have ever had. You can just tell that the quality of their ingredients is higher than most anywhere. The juices are hand-squeezed. The meats are antibiotic and hormone free. Most everything, including tortillas, is made in house. This is the real deal. So, if you find the prices to be a little high, consider how much work the staff puts in to make quite literally everything on your table and the natural ingredients that each item is made from. 

Ultimately, this is a great restaurant. Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Feniger are women I have watched on Top Chef and the Food Network time and time again, and this is a great opportunity to try their food. These women also entrusted the right person in choosing Jennifer Holley as their general manager. She has done an incredible job at opening this location.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,0,0,4,cZwDhdYDOnPeY-9yyMwt8g

The type of fish for the tacos and the ceviche ($7) varies every few days. This time for the tacos it was Ono... Yum! Would had preferred it grilled than fried but was good. You receive complimentary chips with 3 types of salsa with the happy hour menu too. Overall great price for what you get & we enjoyed everything. 

My only complaint is they are stingy with plates. My husband and I each ordered 2 different kinds of tacos and they brought it all on 1 plate & no offer of a side plate. The couple next to us got a quesadilla that they were sharing struggling to eat from 1 plate. It's way too hard to eat like that!

It's been awhile since we've visited the Forum Shops, and they've added a new section right off the strip. Border Grill is right inside. After reading some of the review and seeing they had gotten so many 5 star reviews we were excited. The staff was helpful and seated us right away. I can't remember what time it was but I'm thinking it was a late lunch. The chips were like pitas - thick and super crispy. They were so good. I either like them extra thin or thick like theirs. They also brought out 3 kinds of salsas - one somewhat hot, one green, and one with a little hint of smoke. I loved them all. I ordered the steak nachos (not the real name - can't remember right now though), and they were so good. Not a huge portion, but I still couldn't finish them. Probably from all the chips beforehand. The steak they used was tender and flavorful. The cheese they used was creamy. Other toppings were gauc, black beans, and sour cream. What I loved most was there was a little hint of sweetness. The rest of the family loved their meals too. Dakota got a 3 course meal for $20. He had a shrimp ceviche first followed by taquitos, and then a coconut flan for dessert. It looked good. I didn't realize they were a chain. They gave us a VIP card to use in the future so that we can always get 15% off when we go.",GRTdXjXvU7525d3hyRWqdg,2,1,5,0LOP1FEDkL-9BgIao_3huQ

Food: 5/5. Yummy in my tummy. Boyfriend ordered the tacos and I ordered the quesadilla ($5). I love happy hour here. The prices are so reasonable/good which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars. But they don't skimp out on quality just because it's happy hour. I'm from Texas so tex mex/mexican food in any other place usually can't beat Texas places but this place had pretty good tacos and quesadillas! Flavorful and the meat was good. The oysters were the highlight of our meal. So refreshing and perfect in flavor. Fresh!

The free chips and salsa (3 different ones) were also on par with Texan restaurants...Wow! This place is a gem in Vegas and a must go. 

Our bill turned out to be only like ~$18 for two tacos, one quesadilla, and two oysters. we came here for a short snack before a buffet.

Walked a little further from Joe's and my eyes lit up when I saw Border Grill.  I've been wanting to try the location in Downtown LA for brunch and lucky for me it was 1:15pm and I still had time to partake in the $35 unlimited small plates brunch.  Woohoo! I loved the idea of small plates, almost like a buffet but everything was made to order and we could share amongst the table.  Everything was pretty delicious, except I would have to say the weaker dishes were the pigs in a blanket and the lettuce cups.  My favorites were the tamales and the steak and eggs.  Each dish was quite creative and a pretty decent size.  If you are eating alone, it might be a bit harder to try everything on their small plates brunch menu.  It's nice to have their brunch in a group setting because you get the opportunity to try everything and then know what you want to narrow in on if you want seconds.  The churro dessert was a little disappointing, I wish it had more of a crunch, I think texture-wise it would have made a huge difference, hopefully that one gets re-created soon.  Service was really kind and our waters were frequently being refilled.  Saw that there was also $10 bottomless mimosas and wished I could have some of that.  Considering the circumstance, I figured I'd save that for next time.

Instead of expensive elite bottled water or tap water, they serve water that has been through a triple filtration process on site and poured from from recycled tequila bottles that are washed and reused every day.

The relleno shrimp tacos had a huge pepper with baby pieces of shrimp in them- definitely not what we expected. The queso tasted good however the consistency is similar to as if you were to melt cheese on nachos- very sticky and not necessarily a ""dip.""  Margaritas were good.

The bartender came over and took our drink orders 10 minutes after sitting down and said our waitress would be with us shortly.

After 25 minutes, TWENTY FIVE, we were served the drinks we ordered. I was on the verge of getting up and walking out when they arrived. The timing was unacceptable. After we placed our order, both going with brunch items, the food arrived promptly. 

We ordered the steak and eggs, breakfast fries, eggs benedict, huevo rancheros, and shrimp and grits the first go around. These are tapas  portions and the food was absolutely AMAZING. For our second order, I got the chuuro bites and pigs in a blanket. Both were excellent.

Food is absolutely outstanding, but the service was very lacking. VERY. The bartender was hustling the whole time, and in my opinion, there should be 2 bartenders for brunch, especially with a place the offers bottomless mimosas. It took forver just to get a drink refilled. 

I would have loved to give 3.5 stars, but sadly that's not an option. 4 stars would be too many, considering the poor service. We will try again, and hopefully it will be better next time.

I'm not sure how we went from wanting raw oysters, to ""settling"" on ceviche, but I'm glad we did!

We ordered a couple things, that were all sort of blah, HOWEVER, their Caribbean Carpaccio, chips and house made salsas (ask for their habanero salsa if you like heat, you have to ask for it, they won't just bring it out) are what keep us coming back!

Their Caribbean Carpaccio is basically ceviche plated like carpaccio. It's their catch of the day with a coconut chile broth, celery leaf, shaved red onion and shoestring yams. Fresh, clean and crisp flavors, It's amazing. I could eat this everyday! 

Now, here's the thing with Border Grill, their menu seems to differ from location to location. This particular location, located inside Caesars Palace, is the only one we've found that has this particular carpaccio that we love so much.

Also, pro-tip, sign up for their VIP Club. It's free, and you can do it online, or right in the restaurant and it'll save you 15% off your bill. Boom!

I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews about the service but I have been a fan of The Two Hot Tamales since the beginnings of the Food Channel.  The family and I gave it a try and were glad we did.  
The service was top notch and what you would expect from this type of restaurant. We experienced nothing like some of the other reviewers.   We were promptly seated and greeted by the bus person with chips and salsa.  He went over each salsa with us.  The server was professional and pleasant.  The bus person never let our chips or glass go empty.   
The food was also excellent.  My 9 year old loves tortilla soup and if a restaurant has it he has tried it.  He ranked theirs at the top.  My wife had the potato tacos which she described as very flavorful and crisp.  I had the short rib enchiladas.  The sauce on the enchiladas was fresh made not from a can.  It had the right amount of heat and was very flavorful.  The enchiladas themselves were packed with short rib and excellent.  My only complaint for $27.00 for three enchiladas there shouldn't be an extra charge to add rice or beans.

Knowing how much we love their food and customer service, this place just has to be a contender for the wedding reception! Plus, it's in Mandalay Bay, which I honestly consider as one of the nicer hotels in Vegas. 
From day 1, Karly has been sending me info about what the restaurant can do in terms of hosting special events, such as our wedding. She also connected me to several outside resources, such as hotel reservations (possible block rooms), and their preferred vendors. What really blew me away was the amount of courtesy and enthusiasm she gave me, my fiance and my sister (MOH). The fiance didn't even phase her during his ""interrogation"" of finances and other services we hadn't even talked about. 
I will say that I'm not worried about the food or service. The only downside I saw was that the lower level of the restaurant was separated. Not particularly ideal for a whole, large function, but I think it'd be worth it.

Upon entering, they asked if we would like a table or if we would prefer to sit at the ceviche bar. Ceviche? Bar? Don't mind if I do. 

After scanning the menu, we decided on a couple of appetizery things (places to go, other things to eat): the queso fundido and the smoked mussel ceviche. We also had some of an autumn-spiced white sangria our server recommended (delicious!) 

We loved the queso fundido, full of chorizo and delightfully melted manchego. However, the ceviche was absolutely the highlight here. I'd never had a preparation quite like this. The slight spicyness with the smoky mussel flavor and sweetness from the mangoes came together perfectly. I want more!

And a funny story, while enjoying our ceviche we were approached by someone I later figured out was Mary Sue Milliken. She was entirely too excited that we were sitting at the ceviche bar, because she loved the idea but was disappointed that not a lot of people sat there. She decided we needed to try a couple of the raw oysters, so she had the guy working the ceviche bar make some for us. They were, indeed, wonderful, and not just because they were free.

1829134,2017-10-01,1,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"My wife and I were in the mood for Mexican food. We had eaten at Border Grill about 10 years ago and each of us remembered that it was well above average. We thought it was time to give it another try. No problem getting a table at 6 PM, even on a Saturday night. We opted to eat on the patio outside. Really nice patio overlooking the pool. Much less noisy than the inside dining. Plus the tables are nicely spaced so you are not sitting right on top of your neighbor. Bonus points for ambience.
While the water service came to the table right away, a server didn't appear for many minutes. When he finally did show up, he asked if we saw the check from the prior occupants of our table. When we said no he disappeared for another 10 minutes. Service stayed at about that level for the entire meal.
Check in on Yelp entitled us to a free green corn tamale. Because we weren't terribly hungry we decided to share the chicken tacos and the vegetable quesadilla. The vegetable quesadilla was okay. Nothing special. But I expected more for a $16 quesadilla. We have had better at much less upscale restaurants. The chicken tacos were quite good. The food had been brought buy a food runner, not our server. Our server made his next appearance just as we were finishing our food. I reminded him that we had also asked for the green corn tamales. He did bring them a few minutes later. Those were also quite tasty, even though we basically had them for dessert.
The pleasant Ambience did not make up for the mediocre service and the average food. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things. Perhaps the more exotic dishes are what you should order when you come to this restaurant. But I really think at this price point,  the kitchen should be able to do everything very well, and this kitchen doesn't. 
More frustrating still was the fact that we were charged $7 to self Park our car for this dining experience. As a local I have lots of options for a good quality Mexican food off of the strip. There is no way I'm going to return to this restaurant and pay to park my car for this kind of dining experience.

Battered Fish Tacos were excellent as was the Handmade Guacamole

The negatives that took them down a couple stars were the carnitas really needed to be strained a little before being put on the fresh corn tortilla, they were very greasy and we ended up just letting the tortilla act like a sponge. We didn't finish them.

Also the margarita I received for checking in was normally priced at 11 dollars and if I had actually paid that for it I would have been disappointed.

YES:
Ceviche Del Dia- duh, always get the ceviche
Peruvian Shrimp and Grits- probably the best dish, we ended up eating three!
Plantain Empanadas- better than they sounded, more savory than sweet
Steak and Egg- nicely seasoned med rare skirt steak, egg, tasty aioli
Yucatan Egg Benedict- looks good, filling portion, biscuit was super dense though
Fried Green Tomatillos- thin, light coating complemented nicely by the brie and light sauces
Esquite Lettuce Wraps- so simple but so good, would get again

MEH:
Chile Relleno- served as three mini peppers for easy sharing but didn't have much going on
Breakfast Fries- ours had minimal short rib and bacon, and added jalapenos that weren't in the description, all on unseasoned fries. YMMV?
Huevos Rancheros- average, fill up on other things
Green Corn Tamales- no, they aren't spicy
Chilaquiles Verde- sauce was too subtle, one of the few dishes we didn't finish
Tres Leches French Toast- pretty but the tres leches flavors were too subtle to matter
Churro Tots- just okay but better without the weird salty chocolate sauce on the bottom.

While I enjoyed my brunch because it was with great company and a few standout dishes, the experience would have been better with a few tweaks, starting with our odd seating in the back area in the dark, which made photos difficult. Dishes were oddly coursed and came out a bit slowly, refills had to be requested a couple of times, and we never did receive the shrimp relleno tacos.

2045288,2015-02-14,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Why am I giving this three stars instead of four that I gave the one in the Mandalay Bay, it's just not as good.  The menu is much smaller and lacks some of the favorites I've come to depend on when dining there.  My absolute favorite is the chili relleno and this iteration of the border Grill doesn't serve it.  I did have some chicken enchiladas that were very good and I'd have them again but think next time we'll go back to the one at Mandalay Bay. We always order the guacamole and while it was tasty, it also wasn't as good as the restaurant down the street.

One of the things that made our experience less positive was the person who showed us to our table.  Believe he was the manager and asked if we'd been there before.  When we said no but we generally ate at the one up the strip, he said oh, he'd be back to see how his compared.  Now the place wasn't that busy but we never saw him again. guess he didn't really care.  He also mentioned that one of the owner/chefs was there and when I said I'd love to meet her and give her a compliment, he said he'd make sure she stopped by, that didn't happen either.

We ordered the Carne Asada Quesadilla and the Chicken Torta lunch special. The quesadilla was huge. Lots of food but great flavor with cheese, Mexican crema, pico de gallo and guacamole. The Chicken Torta was also huge and came with fries. Seriously the best Torta I've ever had. The chicken was moist and had carmelized onions, avocado, chipotle mayo sauce, bacon. I would highly recommend. Food is a little pricey, typical for Vegas, but the flavors in their dishes are suburb.

Amazing, amazing, amazing Mexican restaurant tucked far away at the end of the Forum Shoppes at Caesar's Palace. There is an entrance nearby from the strip but if you're already inside the Caesar's casino it's a long walk.

We had an excellent dinner and PLATINUM CUSTOMER SERVICE from Kimberly our server. She was seriously the best! It was a Monday, so we took full advantage of their Monday madness deal and had a pitcher of skinny margaritas for only $20. We got 6 glasses out of it, with a lot of ice, but it's still a killer deal. They also have all you can eat tacos for $20 a person. And all of the tacos are DELICIOUS. They are the same tacos they sell a la carte or as an entree with rice and beans on the menu. We tried just about every single one. The two best ones are asada and al pastor, the chicken was okay, I didn't try carnitas but my friend enjoyed. Two least favorites were battered fish and fried avocado, but that's just preference. 
We also had green sweet corn tamales and black bean and plantain empanadas to start, which were BOMB! Their guacamole is to die for too, they make it in a real molcajete. 

Can't wait to try the location in my hometown, LA.",3AWA4lLJJESedTxP1begWQ,4,3,5,IpxjDsRL3x8KtybK06b7kg

Wife' s steak cobb was good. Ancho Vinaigrette a little bland. My Cuban Sandwichnwas great without tasting greasy. Fries were well seasoned, not oversalted but a little undercooked.

I knocked a star off for 2 reasons..A.) No alternative to fries with sandwich. Its 2016..any nice place charging 17$ for a sandwich has to offer an alternative to fries. B.) NO side salad or house salad offered. I wanted salad with my great Cuban..cheapest entry was $17. How they dont offer a tossed signature house salad for $7-10.is beyond me.

Was good. But nothing id recommend. We ment to eat at Joe's but there was a long wait. You can do worse than this place.",Hd6pD2G26ObK3gtvdhyHGg,0,0,3,i7uTXbH2dPmxU6uwWtqlTg
2107669,2015-04-18,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I was so disappointed in our meal at Border Grill. We went in on a Sunday evening around 7:30. Our waiter seemed ready to be done for the day already. I don't know why but he was extremely difficult to even get any attention from at all, despite there only being 5 tables in use (2 weren't even his). He was great to a table of 4 young women but actually seemed to go out of his way to go around us rather than checking in to see if we needed anything. I really think it had to do with the fact that we only ordered water to drink at first. The tables he was more attentive to were buying multiple drinks from the bar. Maybe he just saw that we wouldn't be a big ticket table? I don't know. 

The busboy was fabulous and far more pleasant, despite being treated like crap by the waiter (I saw and heard our waiter berate the bus boy for not moving fast enough...)

We ordered the guacamole, which was quite good. I ordered the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas, and they were...weird. I literally needed a steak knife to cut them, but I couldn't flag the waiter down to request that, so I had to muscle through them with a butter knife. The tortillas were a really strange texture, almost like a taquito, but not fried properly so instead of being crispy they were just very, very tough and chewy. I've eaten and cooked a TON of Mexican food and I've never encountered that preparation before. And it was just very salty. 

My husband had grilled fish tacos and he was not very impressed.

We looked at a whole list of places to host our wedding reception while in Vegas, and opted to go with Border Grill.  I would say one of the first reasons we choose Border Grill was because of Christina, our event coordinator.  Christina was on the ball, and made the entire process as simple as could be.  She was a lot more helpful ad insightful than even that of our wedding planner.  We did work with Jennifer and Jill in the days leading up to our event, and they were both more than accommodating.  This seems to span the board at this establishment, as their employees all seem to exude the same type of mentality.  The customer is definitely number one here! 

We actually grabbed some drinks here on the first visit, during happy hour, and their margarita was spot on!  The bartender made it to perfection.  On our second time through, we grabbed a drink and had a quick bite.  The fish tacos were delicious and once again the drinks were right on par.

When it came time for our event, everything was taken care of.  We weren't left wanting for anything.  The staff did an amazing job getting the venue ready for our group, and they continued to go above and beyond throughout the event.

2362398,2017-03-02,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"You guys all know Vegas can be a bit pricey especially with all those fancy looking restaurants. This one looked fancy from the outside but it is quite affordable. That is if you don't mind a Latin American fusion restaurant.

The service was awesome here, the guy was very attentive to us, came by and asked if all the things were good including the food. Even offered if I wanted my left over lemonade drink to go. Now that is service. A+++

If you're undecided and not really sure what to get, try the lunch special combo - appetizer, entrée, and dessert for only $25. And let me tell you it was quite fulfilling unless you have a huge appetite. 

For my choices:
App: corn tamales (didn't see this in the regular menu) - one was softer than the other but I kind of liked it even though I'm not a huge fan of actual corn pieces in the tamales. 

Entrée: grilled fish tacos (2pc) with 2 sides of rice and black beans, the tacos were tiny and they were about average tasting. 

The bf got taquitos and they actually gave out a better portion of taquitos than mine. Oh well...He liked it. 

Dessert: there's only 1 choice and it is coconut flan, now I didn't taste the actual coconut cause there wasn't any in the flan and just coconut flakes. However, the flan was good and not overly sweet because the syrup was designed into a hard candy on top of it. 

We also tried the ceviche, the Baja and Caribbean. Caribbean was unique and it wasn't too bad, I liked the sauce they used. 

Complimentary tortilla chips and 3 sides of salsa were given. I think that's what also stuffed me beforehand since I was starving.

So very pleasantly surprised with our choice.

They start you off with fresh homemade chips and 3 types of salsa, all very good but my favorite is probably the green 1; also got talked into the guacamole which was a really good choice( no this item came toward the end of the meal which was a little annoying). We got the Baja shrimp ceviche(a little bit sweeter than regular shrimp) and I have to say that's probably the best ceviche I've ever had anywhere including Mexico, the short rib enchiladas which are to die for, & a perfect desert with the sweet corn tamales for those that don't like their sweets too sweet. 

Got a few other items in our party but those are the ones I remember the most, only weird part is that appetizers don't seem to come when appetizers should, along with entrees and other stuff. Everything's a little bit all over the place.

Definitely a must try, so glad to have found out they have one back home in LA. All their flavors to all their dishes are like a party/club in your mouth!!!  can't wait to come again!",EqUlPxZHF15UVNZTKScDHQ,3,1,4,DgYRooKih33cI01RQBJAVQ

2457318,2015-05-13,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"We were thrilled when we found that one of our favorite Vegas restaurants opened a second location in the Forum Shops. And the Hot Tamales did not fail to impress. The green tomatillo salsa was better than I remembered, even more addictive. The oysters were a briny slap in the face (and that's a compliment from a Bostonian...) and served with different granita toppings. The appetizer trio was solid; our previous favorite - the plantain empanadas - were off, but the rest were delicious. Our entrees were a shrimp relleno taco and the rib eye. The taco were incredibly complex with chili, huge shrimp and a topping of pickled vegetables. The rib eye was perfectly cooked and served with a delicious chimichurri. The star of the evening though was a side of roasted beets served over a carrot purée.  The mixture of beets each had individual flavor, a pleasant char and seasoned with cumin and lime (we think). 

Our server, Matthew, was fantastic. The restaurant was slammed after we arrived and he and the rest of the team hustled. He brought us out sorbets at the end of the meal - the mango was to die for.",WOjIncmhNG4GLVv87w3l9A,1,0,5,_sUzToWmCaYJzQIz36t8iA

I came with a party of 6 and half of us received the free margarita upon check in.  The margarita came before my glass of water - odd.  We were given the entree menus and were a bit hurried about ordering by the waitress.  We ordered.  After the order was placed, one of us in the party inquired out the cerviche bar we spotted when we walked in.  The waitress said they have a menu for it if we wanted it along with nightly specials.  It would have been nice if we were informed this before we were rushed to order because the specials looked a lot better than the boring menu options we chose from.  We all discussed how disappointed we were that the waitress didn't provide this simple duty and we guessed she might have heard us as she went MIA for most of our dinner.
Food comes and still not impressed.  I ordered the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas and it lacked something.  It was edible but not work the price or its place permanently on the menu.

First of all, our service was excellent. Super nice servers and other waitstaff - very friendly and efficient. Myself and one of my friends also spent the $10 more for bottomless mimosas. They have many juice options to choose from that I've never had. We tried watermelon, pomegranate, prickly pear and blood orange. The blood orange and watermelon were probably my favorite!

To begin they bring you out some banana bread and empanadas with a jelly inside along with some sweet cream cheese. The banana bread and cream cheese combo is delicious!

As far as the brunch food goes, we got it family style for our table. A favorite at our table were definitely the bbq sliders, we ended up getting two plates of those. My other favorites were the biscuits with chorizo gravy and cauliflower taquitos. Really you could order one of everything on the menu if you wanted since it's endless plates, but believe me you'll get full! I wish I took some pictures but I was too busy eating :)

The guac here is also great - even though it's not on the brunch menu we heard we had to order it and our waitress switched it out as one of the brunch plates so we didn't get charged any extra.

He recommended ordering 3-4 plates per person at a time as the items are tapas (small plates), but some portions are definitely more than small plates--the French toast, for example! Our group of 4 ended up trying all but 6 of the items on the menu plus the special item of the day (breakfast taco). Our first order of tapas came one after another and together on the table, it makes for one nice Instagram picture. We only did that for the first round since we were busy chowing down on the food thereafter.

Towards the end, we abandoned ordering separate orders of the same items for our individual selves (in the beginning, three of us each ordered the French toast!) and instead we all took bites off of one order. Yes, we got stuffed around Round 3. My favorite tapas included the steak and eggs, French toast, shrimp and grits, and breakfast fries. We finished off with one order of churro tots for dessert and thankfully there were only 4 tots on one plate, perfect for each of us to have one morsel to taste. 

I forgot the exact cost of the AYCE brunch, and looking at the menu now, the cost appears to have gone up to $34.99! Our brunch per person was abound $32 after tax, before tip. There's also an option to pay $10 for unlimited mimosas, which we passed on since we wanted to focus on food!

The AYCE brunch is a refreshing change from the casino buffets. While you don't get a variety of types of cuisines, it's nice to enjoy the carefully crafted Mexican fare Border Grill chose to highlight on their brunch menu.

Since it's the Forum shops at Caesar's, you can park at Caesar's, though they charge for parking unless you have a Nevada driver's license (for now). If you're staying on the Strip, you can probably walk to here. We passed on walking here from Planet Hollywood because even at 10 am, the temps were already in the hundreds in late June!",wV4uhvJGok8nOR56Ex5mAg,7,2,5,eNAK5nH4iV8V9FgAE_oOqQ

For the same price, I could go to Javier's at Aria where the food is top notch and the atmosphere is sophisticated. Border Grill feels like a casino cafeteria.

As soon as we arrived we were seated, and didn't have to wait, which is always a plus! Our party got the unlimited small plates, and drinks which is about $55/person. I drank more than I ate, BUT we were able to try every dish on the menu - including deserts! Some better than others, but nonetheless it was all great!

There were 6 of us. The nice waitress gave us the rundown on the place; its background, its fresh and organic use of ingredients and its distilled and filtered water. Hmmm. We ordered the guac. It was delicious but the chips were delayed. After her recommendation we ordered the whole snapper Veracruz. Fried fish in a sauce with olives, tomatoes, peppers. It was ""ok"". I've eaten whole fried fish before and I was underwhelmed esp since she talked it up so much. My friend ordered rice, which was not on the menu and it was dry and horrible. Like it had been sitting there forever. He had to send it back. 

We inquired about the ceviche bar. The waitress said the hostess must've forgotten to give us the extra menu. We had already ordered because we had a show to catch. But afterwards she brought us the menu and there were a few things that we wanted from, including the ceviche and some special tacos. Annoying.

I was disappointed with my braised short rib tacos. Despite the sauce they seemed dry. There weren't very many people dining. Not a lively atmosphere. Decor was lab and dark. And the waitress was not very attentive. 

When we walked out to catch our show I saw the celebrity chef's pictures. Mary Sue milliken and Susan feniger. I loved them on top chef masters. Top chef is the only show I regularly watched.

Overall, the menu and each dish were constructed with a lot of thought. We ordered barbecue brisket flautas, cumin grilled skirt steak, and pablano chicken enchiladas. I was able to try a bit of everything. The flautas were enough to eat as a dinner meal for one. They had a great smokey flavor, a hint of spice, and were deliciously crunchy from being deep fried. The grilled steak was cooked perfectly medium well, the cumin based rub was very flavorful, and paired well with the accompanying arugula salad and sweet corn. The enchiladas were fabulous I probably could have licked my plate clean. The pablano enchilada sauce had a beautiful deep green color and the perfect amount of heat. They were stuffed full of moist chicken and the sweet corn relish on top added a perfect sweetness to balance the dish. I wish we had ordered something from the ceviche bar everything looked great. I'm rating Border Grill 4 stars because I felt like the overall atmosphere was lacking a bit and I am disappointed the chile relleno with goat cheese was not on the menu. But, if you are craving Mexican food made with quality ingredients while in the Forum Shoppes this is a great choice, just be prepared to spend a little extra moolah.",kxYYCmcGVvU4idDu5hj5qQ,1,0,4,gEx0Yk1Lr_gFr1YBcwd-Xg

I was pretty stoked to try this place out, since my friends raved about their first visit. The food was great, but the service extremely lacking considering that the place wasn't even packed. Mimosas came out slowly to the point that we had to ask; not only that, the food too was slowly paced. Ok, onward to what was ordered. This was last month so I sort of forgot my feelings toward some dishes.

Fried Green Tomatillos

Bacon and Egg Quesadilla

Chicken and Waffle

Churro Tots - strangely, I think I prefer Costco's churro for a crisper execution.

Huevos Rancheros

Machaca Chilaquiles

Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - there was so much grits leftover; I think at this point we too much heavy food.

Egg White Oysters Rockefeller

Green Corn Tamales - these were great. Warm and smooth corn right out of the wrap.

First off, they are super generous on chips and salsa! Now onto the dishes me & my family ordered:

- Ceviche Duo (Peruvian & Baja):
Definitely preferred the Peruvian ceviche over the Baja. A lot more diversity & freshness on flavor, and the portion was sufficient as an appetizer for the four of us.

- Barbacoa Enchiladas (from special menu):
Not sure if this dish will stay on the special menu for long, but I enjoyed this dish a lot! Topped with an arugula salad that balanced out the meaty/cheesiness of the enchiladas.

- Cumin Grilled Skirt Steak:
SUPER tender and very flavorful! Would honestly prefer this steak alone over steaks at some of your average steakhouses to a certain extent.

- Spicy Shrimp Tacos:
My family agreed this one was slightly underwhelming, as the breading of the shrimp was mushy and didn't offer as much flavor as the other dishes. I can't recall if this was on the special menu or not.

- Yucatan Pork:
Some places either get the pork too chewy and/or too dry, but this was definitely neither - super tender and moist. It lacked a little flavor which would've made this complete, but still enjoyable!

Overall, I think this restaurant lives up to its Yelp rating. I came out full & with satisfied tastebuds, while not spending excessively as is common in Vegas - especially since Yelp offers 15% off! What more could I ask for :)",BQBZJ_MDRWhNribFyCCGIQ,0,0,5,UJf0n_J0vpeOhbpFBVBGCg

3455338,2016-06-12,1,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"This review is for Border Grill's 2016 Las Vegas Restaurant Week Menu.

Maybe I had high expectations for this restaurant? The menu offerings sounded mouthwatering, but my orders were disappointingly mediocre. 

First Course: Green corn tamales:  Overly sweet, creamy mixture of corn kernels, cheese, and cream wrapped up in corn husks. This was unappetizing.

Second Course: Grilled Chicken and Mango Salad: This would've been a decent salad except for the dressing. I enjoyed the grilled chicken, slices of avocado and the seasoned dices of mango and slices of jicama, which added a kick to the salad. However, the menu noted that the dressing was a chile lime vinaigrette. Instead, the salad ingredients were tossed with a thick, honey mustard concoction that ended each bite I took with a tangy taste that lingered. 

Third Course: Flan De Coco:  I like my flan sweet, and this wasn't. The flan had a hint of coconut and had a creamy texture. The accompanying pineapple salsa was too sweet and didn't pair well with the flan.

A girlfriend and I came for a girls' weekend and we were looking something light to eat for lunch knowing we'd probably go out for dinner.

Citrus Grilled Chicken Taco - Soooo tasty and they give you lots of meat.
Ceviche Duo - Peruvian Ceviche was good but spicy; really great flavors but a little too much sauce. They also only give you two plantain chips so thank goodness for the free tortilla chips. Carribean Carpaccio is not your typical ceviche in the sense that's it's not chunky. I don't know what I was expecting considering it says carpaccio in the name - thin slices of fish as opposed to chunky salsa like. Still very tasty although I didn't care much for the celery leaf or red onions.

Sangria - I loooove Sangria but I usually prefer white Sangria. This one was red but not overly sweet with just enough alcohol for a lightweight like me.

Service was great. I'd take about two sips of water and someone would immediately come fill it.

Great first impression and I would definitely go back!",MyOH75RSsjvpWKQ3N37C8Q,4,3,4,UJ4A_gxeBw671EMnid95Cw

I ended up taking home half of the meal because I was full very quickly. A lot of flavor overload but in a good way. Definitely not a place for someone on a diet but if you just want to enjoy your vacation or lunch out on the Strip then YES! very delicious. Guac & dips were yummy too. Waitresses were very nice, easy access to (large!) bathroom, & chill ambiance. Price was about $15 which is fairly standard for The Strip dining.

We had a party of 10. Pre-dinner drinks were wonderful -- great mojitos, margaritas, tequilas and IPAs. Appetizers come out quickly, and tasty. Good stuff, especially the ceviches and the guac.

Meals came out all at once. Not sure how it happened, but 1 of them came out room temparature and 4 of them came out cold, including a steak that was extremely rare (red bordering on purple inside). Alex apologized profusely and was able to get the dishes fixed and/or refired, but it took quite a while, so we weren't eating at the same time. He spent a lot of time apologizing and trying to make it right. He brought the GM out, comped 4 of our entrees, and comped us some desserts.

The food itself was terrific. Duck breast mole was wonderful, as was the seafood stew, the short rib enchiladas, the achiote-roasted pork. Everyone enjoyed the meal, just not the process.

Not sure why food came out cold. Place was only 1/3 full, although there was a big private party in the back. Maybe the kitchen just got hammered or lost their focus.

3758614,2015-06-26,7,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"On my most recent trip to Vegas, it was totally planned for me to visit both locations at Border Grill.  I did the Border Brunch at Mandalay Bay (which you can read here -- http://bit.ly/1J9rf0S) so with my other visit to the Forum Shops location, I decided to try their famous Chile Relleno Burger which was on Eater Vegas' list of Top 10 Burgers to try.

Chile Relleno Burger -- http://bit.ly/1J9Cedu
Ground short rib and brisket, panela cheese relleno, pickled chiles, tomato jam aioli, arugula
This was a very solid burger!  And different as well.  Using a Chile Relleno for a topping was a stroke of genius since it added a spicy, crunchy, gooey-cheese enhancement to the well-cooked burger.  I would recommend giving this burger a try.  And it came with fries as a bonus.

As for the location, it's located at the entrance of the Forum Shops where the escalators are in the the former P.J. Clarke's space.  The layout is essentially the same with the bar in the back of the restaurant and patio out in front which is great for people watching.

In terms of which Border Grill I think is better, I'd say the edge goes to the Mandalay Bay since it has that almost beachfront feel to it with their patio being outside near the Mandalay Bay Pool.  Nevertheless, both locations are worth visiting and have almost identical menus including their famous Border Brunch.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,11,11,4,jI3eK-kR-QewRJizR9lvYg

The bartender had everything whipped up super quick.
The Sangria was alright. It had a strong syrup taste but it was strong liquor-wise as well. I finished it off and moved onto my house margarita. The house does only come in one flavor, but it was good! Strong, but not gross, good balance to it.

There are not many places that I struggle to find even 1 negative thing to write about, but Border Grill is one of those places. From the start of our visit we were treated as if we were the only table being occupied. The food arrived quick and the meals themselves tasted extremely fresh. Be warned!...this isn't your usual Tex-Mex or Mexican restaurant, each thing on the menu has its own twist, making Border Grill a unique experience. The charm of Border Grill is how unique it is, but if you're looking for traditional Mexican food, this may not be the place for you.

It's like getting a brunch buffet where every item is hand cooked for you. Not one item I had of the 15 we chose from the menu of 20 was bad and some of them were truly fantastic. It's exactly what I like about the idea of a buffet, getting the chance to cajole many different items. 

For $10 more you can add on unlimited mimosas which is a good deal in Vegas where most drinks cost $15 at minimum. I wish they offered more then 5 flavors however, but I can't complain, each one I tried was good.

Will definitely be back for lunch or dinner to try their regular menu. Be sure to join their VIP program on their website so you can get 15% off your meals. Such a great deal and such great food.",G4p3A6VFPpTPF1EsMRFOcQ,0,0,5,LBd774g2QnjWkfvITjhWSA

Some favorites:
Steak and eggs: The steak was perfectly cooked medium-rare and was really tender and flavorful.

Green corn tamales: They don't look super-appealing when you open them, but the flavor is pure sweet corn.

Eggs Benedict: The biscuit was amazingly light and fluffy.

Tres leches French toast: As good as it sounds--genius!

Awesome! Definitely a sleeper pick here. 

He also recommended I try the fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade and boy what a treat coming in from the Vegas heat. I also tried the carnitas which were moist and tasty, but didn't wow like the chicken Poblano enchiladas.

3877305,2015-04-15,1,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Aside from Frontera Grill, I can't imagine fancy Mexican being a successful venture. However, if there was one place to open a restaurant where the rich can blow some cash on expensive tacos, Vegas is the city to do it. While Border Grill has a pretty well-known weekend brunch, their ceviche bar is also a big draw. 

While I'm sure all the waiters are trained to push the border guacamole as a tableside show and appetizer, it felt a little too Chili's to me. There were three ceviches to choose from and I figured the closest one to being local, the Baja, would be the freshest. Unfortunately, there was a metallic aftertaste. Hopefully, it wasn't the taste of mercury poisoning and we won't get Jeremy Pivened. 

For entrees, we tried the quesadillas and tacos. At first look, they may seem overpriced, and they still very well could be. But, I have to admit that most ingredients for quesadillas and tacos at these types of restaurants are haphazardly thrown together. The hope is that the overcooked meat is covered up by the melted cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. But, I found the citrus grilled chicken to be juicy and tender. The grilled fish tacos were great as well - I loved the substitution of grapefruit as the acidic component. 

The portions are pretty large and the service was excellent. The drinks were refreshing and went great with the meal. If they still have the coconut mojito, it's a must try.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,3,2,3,cCkVeldKwdH8Tz8AAgX9tA

Went for a hangover-cure lunch and BG definitely delivered.  We were seated right away, and had a nice, attentive server.  Started out with the sparkling blood orange lemonade, which was super tasty!  Would make a fabulous cocktail if vodka or rum was added. ;)

The chips and salsa were deeeeeee-lish.  And we're from San Diego, home of some of the best.  Loved that they gave us 3 salsas to try!  And loved the fresh-cut, hot chips!

I ordered the crispy potato rajas tacos and my hubby got the Yucatan pork.  Both were pretty amazing.  I loved that his came on little soft-fried tortillas and had picked onions on them.  But mine were the show stealer.  I'm definitely not a vegetarian, but they sounded interesting, so I took a chance.  Glad I did - the filling was amazing.  The contrast between the crunchy outside and the creamy inside was on point!  Sooooo good.

The only reason I had to take a 1/2 star off was for the beans and rice on our plates.  At first I was excited to have both red and green rice, but upon trying them I was very disappointed.  They were both undercooked and virtually flavorless.  The beans were also bland, and were almost cold.  Totally not a deal breaker, because our meals came with 3 tacos, and we had plenty of chips to fill us up.  But, being a Susan Feniger restaurant, I would expect a half decent side dish on my plate.

All in all, we will totally be back.  I think next time for dinner, so we can try all the cocktails!  :)",jnUECQSItgACyvhyzHXvXw,1,0,4,bb-WFMXHmC1I6NgzG7zXsA

Our visit to Border Grill was fabulous! The service, food, drinks, and ambiance were great. Our server, Luis, gave great recommendations, checked on us frequently, and was very friendly and personable. 

We went during lunch, so I opted for the lighter route-- Tijuana Kale Caesar and the Border Classics (green corn tamales, plantain empanadas, and quinoa fritters) so I could try an assortment of their classic Mexican dishes. SOOO good! The kale caesar had the most amazingly addicting cotija croutons and the plantain empanadas were a nice combination of savory and sweet.

Our server was super nice and explained how everything worked. 3 tapas at a time, if I'm remembering right. And of course, as much as we want. 

My brother's a vegetarian, so we tried to make sure we ordered a lot he could eat too - which wasn't a problem with their extensive tapas menu. 

They also brought out some sweet empanadas, banana bread, and cinnamon butter. Oh man!!!

My favorite dish was the breakfast fries which had bacon, egg, cheese, and a bunch of other tasty stuff on it.  I also loved the tomatillos - actually that rivaled the fries. My mom liked the fish tacos which had different kinds of fish within a pepper within a small tortilla. However, we found one of the two we ordered was actually very spicy, and the other wasn't at all. My brother liked a dish that I can't remember what it was... it has sunny side up eggs and red sauce... ehh I don't know.

It was only $10 to add on bottomless mimosas. Hell yeah! And they had a ton of flavors to choose from! I tried like 3 different ones, but didn't want to get drunk in front of my family so I kept it at that.

3952472,2018-01-05,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I hate to ruin their reputation based solely on my taste preferences so my 3 star rating includes all aspects of our experience.  Note that they are not about traditional Mexican food, which they do not claim to be, but they also are not typical Southwest flavor either, which they do claim (it has the traditional SW look, but not the taste). 

Main complaint:  Everything we ordered had an interesting flavor/ spice added to it, and for me it was not subtle at all, just overpowering, & made everything taste the SAME!  Not sure what it was-- chipotle? curry? smokey, spicy combination of something or other-- but it didn't work for me at all.  I got bored with the same taste in my rice, my beans, my pork, the other rice (green), ugh... I even tasted the other entrees in our party of 4, and that same strange flavor permeated them all.  

5 star service from an amazing waiter! 

4 star salsa & chips.  Super yummy!  This is where that strange secret ingredient worked best, in the salsa. 

4 star presentation & quality of food/ seemingly fresh. 

2.5 star execution. Undercooked green rice & barely warm beans.  (Although, perhaps this style of green rice is supposed to be slightly crunchy?) 

2 star taste & flavor creativity.  


They have great reviews so obviously people like their food, but our group agreed, we would not return.  More for others to enjoy, I guess.  It's worth trying while in Vegas if only to experience an interesting, non-traditional take on Southwest/ Mexican food.",CSnPiKGBOVdeW1rGxFJ6Dw,3,1,3,CbL4XZNaKKUZR3LLP-Ua4g
3974457,2015-01-02,4,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Two of us started 2015 off with a special New Year's Day brunch at Border Grill normally offered only on weekends.  Offered our choice of any table becasue we were the first people there, we chose to sit on the indoor patio along the Forum Shops. It was also well lighted for better photos.  It's always fun to watch tourists.  

We started with two complimentary guava empanadas and a bowl of fresh fruit before ordering.

Between the two of us, we ordered (descriptions from their menu):

Yucatan egg Benedict - manchego cheese biscuit, achiote roasted pork, avocado crema, hollandaise, pickled onions (2 orders)

Green corn tamales - sweet corn, salsa fresca, sour cream (1 order)

Fried green tomatillos - triple cream brie, hominy grits, spicy romesco, smoked chile hollandaise, pepper bacon  (1 order)

Bacon jalapeño PBJ - housemade peanut butter and grape jelly, crispy bacon, over easy egg, jalapeño  (2 orders)

Chicken and waffle - blue corn waffle, mango habanero coulis, spiced fried chicken, crème fraîche  (2 orders)

Peruvian shrimp and grits - aji panca salsa, roasted green chile, creamy parmesan grits (1 order)

Red velvet Johnny cakes - ancho chocolate shavings, candied pecans, wild berry syrup, vanilla crème fraîche (1 order)

Egg white oysters Rockefeller - seasonal tempura oyster, creamed spinach, crispy bacon, spicy tomato chutney (1 order)

Huevos rancheros - black bean panucho, ranchero salsa, sunny side egg, tomatillo relish, serrano chantilly (1 order)

Breakfast fries - beer braised short rib, chipotle hollandaise, applewood smoked bacon, over easy egg (1 order)

Churro tots - dulce de leche infused churros, cinnamon sugar, cajeta (1 order)

Capirotada French toast - bourbon maple syrup, walnuts, ancho cherry marmalade, goat cheese crema (1 order)

Rice pudding - shortbread cookie, brûléed banana slices (1 order)

The Border Grill brunch is an all you can eat menu with a cost of $34.99.  We ordered two dishes at a time and they were generally brought out at the same time or close to each other.  Where it's indicated 2 orders, we each got one.  Neither one of us repeated any dishes and we didn't share except for the churro tots and the rice pudding--a $9.00 up charge because it's not one of the brunch dishes which total 16.

My favorites were: Yucatan egg Benedict, fried green tomatillos, bacon jalapeño PBJ, shrimp and grits, chicken and waffle, churro tots, and rice pudding--basically everything I ordered.  The chicken and waffle was quite deceptive.  At first, I thought the mango habanero coulis was too sweet until I got a slice of habanero and the rest of the habanero flavor kicked in.  No longer sweet, it was a tasty, zingy dish.  The shrimp and grits were very good as was the bacon jalapeño PBJ.  The peanut butter was excellent and with the jelly and bacon, the biscuit had a very flavorful counterpoint.

Finishing off, the churro tots were good but the rice pudding was exceptional.  The pudding is well worth the up charge.  The portion is huge--easily shared--and it's a great finish to a wonderful brunch. 

Service except for one blip was exceptional.  Coffee was not refilled.  New cups of coffee were brought to replace empty or almost empty cups.  Someone was around often changing the coffee cups and adding water to our glasses.  The general manager, Jennifer, came early to introduce herself and welcome us to Border Grill.  She explained some of the designing done by Feniger/Milliken or their families, and we talked about the way some of their dishes are made.  Jennifer stopped at almost every table while we were there to make sure guests were satisfied or had any questions.

4074555,2018-02-09,2,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I hate having to write this review because Border Grill is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, but I usually visit the location at Mandalay Bay. I will stick to that location from now on. This one is located at Caesar's Palace and it's a pale comparison to its sister restaurant. 

I dined here for the first time last night and was sorely disappointed. The restaurant is hidden away and difficult to find, and there were probably 3 other tables seated on a busy evening at 7 pm. The hostess took us to a nice booth and was very welcoming. Our server, Vanessa,  came right over too -- the service was top notch the entire evening. 

The menu here is almost completely different from the Mandalay location, it's extremely pared down. They don't do the all you can eat mini plates here either, which was a big letdown for us, and a couple of my favorite dishes weren't offered here. We did get our usual guacamole appetizer to start (absolutely fresh and fabulous, but it's not that difficult to make great guac), and the homemade chips and salsas were as delicious as always. 

We ordered a glass of Cava and a margarita, and both were terrific. The margarita was one of the best I've ever tasted and was worth the expense. In fact, all of the appetizer items were delicious so this would be an A+ place to hit up for snacks and drinks. 

I started out with the tortilla soup with chicken. I was shocked at the huge portion size of my soup! I was totally full after I ate it and I asked for another spoon so my husband could help me eat it (the server brought out a heated empty bowl along with the additional spoon, which was so nice and made it really easy to share)! The soup was fantastic, a rich tomato broth with cheese cubes and shredded chicken, topped with crunchy housemade corn tortilla strips. I wish I had only ordered the soup. 

The huge missteps came along with our main courses. Hubby had the chile rubbed ribeye ($39) and I had the Sauteed Shrimp ($27), although I first ordered the Shrimp Relleno Tacos and Vanessa warned me that they were ""super spicy,"" so I changed my order. We added on a side of roasted cauliflower ($9) and sat back and waited. 

The kitchen was notably slow. Our entrees came out with the entrees of the people next to us who were seated 30 minutes or so after we arrived. One of the folks at their table had the same dish I ordered, so I don't know why ours took so long but theirs didn't. It wasn't a big deal but I did notice it. 

The ribeye was a beautiful plate of food, carefully arranged and colorful. My dish on the other hand was not. It was brown and unappetizing and swimming in a sea of liquid. 

Neither of us was happy with the taste of our entrees either. The ribeye was deemed ""not very good"" and my shrimp was super, super salty and had the strangest, most bitter flavor ever. I'm not even sure what it was. There were bitter greens in the dish which I ate most of, and the shrimp was pitiful and boring -- basically just cooked shrimp slapped on top of the dish. 

The rest of my huge bowl was all couscous, and the portion size was outrageous. I was hoping for a tiny little scoop when I ordered it because I'm trying to eat low-carb and this totally ruined that! It was well prepared but the portion size was just too gigantic (and I eat a LOT but this was nuts). 

The roasted cauliflower was bad. We didn't even touch it. It was undercooked and boring with no special spices or anything. 

One spice the kitchen isn't afraid of is SALT. Everything was so salty; my entree unpleasantly so. It tasted like I had swallowed sea water. My mouth was puckered for hours after and I had an unquenchable thirst. It was gross.

I'm so sad to have to give this place a two star rating, but I need to warn others -- stick to what the kitchen does well (appetizers, drinks) and avoid the fancier entrees. It was such a disappointing experience food-wise and worst of all, I had a terrible tummyache that kept me up most of the night.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,9,5,2,swMXV24GrNKabtsoS-y33w

We shared a few dishes to start. The queso fundido was incredible and cheeeeeeesy. I could put that on anything. We also shared the ceviche which was super fresh and tasty. 

I ordered the crispy potato rajas and let everyone try a little bit. This was hands down the best main dish. Paired it with the blood orange lemonade and you have yourself a meal.

4126408,2015-08-07,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I am sorry. Nobody wanted this place to be the bomb more than me.  We watch Food Network, love the ladies who created the restaurant and have even tried to recreate the 'Ciudad Chicken' dish after watching ""Best Thing I Ever Made"". 

We ordered the appetizer ""Queso Fundido"" and at 1st blush it looked delish. Not so.  The homemade chorizo was dry and tasteless and the Manchego cheese mixture needed salt or acid or something.  It certainly did not taste of Modelo beer which was much described by the server.  We ate the appetizer with little fanfare...

For dinner we both ordered tacos. One order of carne asada and one order of fish tacos. 

1) Steak - tasteless and chewy and ultimate sent back to the kitchen. 

2) Fish -  larger chunk of avocado on each taco than actual fish. We didn't send these back as we chalked it up to a preference thing, but in all honesty these tacos were completely off putting.  

3) Ciudad Chicken (replacement for the sent-back steak tacos at substantially higher cost) - chicken breast completely dry and no sign of the pickled
tomatoes that were both on the menu and were also the highlight of our home version of this dish.  Completely underwhelmed by this replacement dish. 

In the end the only people who lost out were the server, Matthew, who was wonderful and tried to make things right. The food just was not good and he price was too high and no compensation or acknowledgment of the fact that we really didn't eat anything. 

This experience COMPLETELY disappointed and nearly ruined our final night in Las Vegas.  Thank goodness for the show ""Absinthe,"" also at Caesar's, which lifted our spirits!

I'm not really one for latin food so my enchiladas weren't my favorite, but I could tell it was very well made and would be enjoyable to anyone who likes latin food. Overall it was a great experience. The waitress was great and so was the service. It was also basically empty from about 5-7pm on a Sunday evening on spring break if I remember correctly. One small thing, the batch of sangria that we had was actually rather bitter, which was really the point being that it was border grill's take on the sangria recipe, so if you're looking for sweet sangria be cautious. It was also a bit noisy on the patio because of the acoustics in the atrium. Other than that it was a great experience and they even really encouraged us to leave feedback after we left.

Our server recommended that she would just bring out 4-5 plates at a time and continuously bring out plates as we finish up. We told her about Paul's corn allergy and she made sure to inform us when corn was used in the dish. She also would substitute flour tortillas for corn which was great.

4293179,2016-01-24,2,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"In Vegas for a long weekend, then a week on business, and then stranded for three more days because of the blizzard known as Jonas. Long story short: good food, great drinks, awesome people. 

We originally stopped in to Border Grill to grab a drink before a dinner reservation elsewhere. Great drinks - my favorite is the blood orange jalapeno margarita - at not too terrible prices, especially at Forum Shops/Caesars. (Folks who complain about how much Vegas costs have no concept of it being Vegas. You think they built this glittery spot on cheap food and winners? Go off-Strip if you want the cheap stuff.) A few days later, my coworker says she'd like Mexican for dinner, and I immediately thought of Border Grill. It's a nice relaxed spot, the menu looked good, and I still had that spicy margarita on the brain. We shared an order of guacamole and I had carne asada tacos; they were both delish. We shut the place down, finishing out the meal with drinks. A couple of days after that, I am stressed because I'm now stranded, and I need a relaxed spot with a good drink. Duh, Border Grill. This time, it's more margaritas and chicken poblano enchiladas. They aren't giant portions, but it's plenty and it's good Tex-Mex food. Still stranded, I made my fourth appearance tonight for drinks (mas margaritas, por favor), but it's really because of how awesome some of the people at Border Grill have been.

To that point, my most sincere thanks to Dylan, Luis, Matt, and Betty. Dylan - my bartender and guide to all things yummy at Border Grill. He did not miss on a recommendation and is a really great guy, despite what his coworkers say about him. Luis and Matt - Dylan's partners in crime behind the bar - were great for laughs and just chatting to this random chick who had taken up residence at the bar (me). Betty - the manager - super sweet and concerned about my being stranded. She offered up toiletries from a stash they had and even asked if I needed a place to wash clothes. I can't say enough about how nice they all were to me this week - they could have been weirded out that I kept coming back, or they could have treated me like every other tourist that stopped in. I'll definitely be back and will bring others with me.",UU5wGRD5NmvvMercfUQqTA,1,2,5,jsxfDnFtHHW8iIxSuXz0EA

Price  - The price was perfect, not too expensive like everything else in the Shope's, but not too cheap that the food quality suffered.  It was just right!

Food - The Mexican was premium home-made quality.  I enjoyed everything from the home-made guac to the soup (not too heavy, not too light) that the server reccomended.

Service - My server Alex (with glasses) was friendly, engaging, and had dead-on reccomendations.  He was prompt when I needed service, and left me alone when I wanted to eat and focus.   5 star service, really!

Environment - Just right for a Mexican place in a casino.  I felt comfortable in my jeans and dress shirt, drinking a beer, while people at the next table were dressed finer then I was.

Bottom line - have a meal there when you're in Vegas, it's just the right place for lunch or an early dinner!",zxVBwmv5C8tP28EUED39wA,2,0,5,JV_yYRb_TL-N170jCv0iMQ
4410657,2014-12-02,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Definitely better than anything in Caesars Palace.  

First, they serve you chips and salsa.  I grew up in San Antonio and this was still the best chips and salsa I've ever had.

For my entree I ordered the carne asada quesadilla.  The meat was tender and lots of it, just a hint of cheese, crema and a topping of guac and tomatoes.  Was a little salty, but quite quite good.  Texture was perfect - crispy outside, tender meat, luxurious guac.  Nice.  

Rudy was my server, he was quick to refill my water glass, check in to see how I was doing and his food recommendations were spot on. 

Very happy.",OPMWWa7j4sD_xuXE8_oDvg,3,0,5,LhxqZ8_0ihwkFEpMVVHhGw
4415261,2015-01-08,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Since moving here from LA I have hunted Vegas for anything similar to the ever popular Bottomless Mimosa Brunch. This is the closest thing you can get and it just so happens to originate from LA! I recently dined here during their Saturday brunch. They have an amazing brunch menu that serves up ""modern Mexican"" cuisine with unlimited small plates for $34.99/ person as well as Bottomless Mimosas for an additional $10. Worth every penny! If your appetite and group is big enough you can savor and taste all 16 dishes. Each dish provides enough for 2-3 people to sample. Dishes range from savory and sweet so you can capture the best of both worlds. Few highlights for me were the Chilaquiles, Churro Tots, Egg White Oyster Rockefeller, and The Bacon Jalepeno PBJ which is one of the most interesting dishes to try! Forgot to mention, the delightful sweet empanadas and fruit plate you get as an appetizer prior to getting your food served which was all quite superb! 

Not only do they have bottomless mimosas for $10 but they offer 5 different flavors! My favorite is called The Corazon, which is mixed with blood orange, passion fruit and orange juice. 

Our server was Perry and be did an amazing job making sure my glass of Mimosa was never empty and anticipated the right times to take our next batch of order. The food came out at a reasonable time!

We ordered a steak burrito, fresh guacamole (no flavor what so ever) and the 4 different types of ceviche. Of the 4 only 1 I genuinely enjoyed. The steak in the burrito was dry - year cost $18.

4427211,2015-07-03,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Well, I really wanted to like this place. I'd heard such great things. But after our dinner taking 2 hours and the entrees being so-so, we won't be coming back. It started out well - got our sodas and chips right away. We ordered the queso for an appetizer and despite not having enough tortillas to dip, it was phenomenal. But this is where it started to go downhill quickly. We waited, and waited, and waited for our entrees. Our waiter Charles never came back to our table, a large group and in his mind a bigger tip capturing his attention. After an hour passing from the time we sat down, I finally had to leave to make an appointment at the Apple Store, so I told my husband to have my entree boxed up and I'd eat it at home. You can imagine my surprise when I walked to the Apple Store, had them fix my iPhone, and still, an hour later, hadn't heard from my husband. I called him to find out he and our kids had JUST LEFT the restaurant. They continued to wait after I left, finally got the food from a different server, ate it and were disappointed to realize the food wasn't worth the wait, and finally had a couple sitting next to them take pity on them and ask THEIR waiter to close out our check since 25 minutes had passed since the food had arrived and no one had ever come back. I went back and expressed my displeasure with the supervisor on duty, who was very nice and apologized but didn't do much more than say, ""I'm really sorry this happened."" Needless to say, we won't be back and will tell our friends not to waste their time either. Pretty sad too, because I often entertain clients for work and am always looking for new restaurants to bring them to, but Border Grill will not be one of them.",4OcP_Pve-RujKtw1XljSQA,0,0,1,-hNCtmnU9p9emuEDo-Hw-A
4434644,2017-12-04,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Border Grill had been on my Bookmarks as a restaurant to try for way too long, until last night I finally had the opportunity to dine there with three other people.  I find that with Vegas, restaurants are often over-hyped, but such is not the case for this lovely establishment. Everything (food, beverages, service, price, and ambiance) was top-notch.

We had Jaclin assigned to our table who was not only lovely, but also very helpful. She recommended various dishes and drinks for us to order, and I am glad to report that her suggestions were great! There were four of us, and between us, we began our dining experience by sharing ""El Jefe"" sized (the equivalent of 3 servings) blood orange and smoked peach margaritas; both were great! The manager, Ciara, then came to check on us regarding our drinks, which we thought was a great gesture. 

Onto the food... I ordered the chicken poblano enchilandas, my boyfriend ordered the skirt steak, and my friends ordered the flautas and the carnitas.  All were fantastic, though my favorites were the enchiladas and the steak. 

Two of us decided to close the night with the coconut and the mango cilantro mojitos, and a coconut flan for dessert. The mango cilantro mojito was great, but nothing compared to the coconut mojito... that was AMAZING! The coconut flan was just perfect, not too sweet, but just the right way to end our meal; thank you, Jaclin for this amazing pick!",HKKOdbhn4nPihy1FDfD4bg,4,2,5,K-bdlbUrLGdhZdcisx-cpg

4548430,2017-02-26,3,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I really hate to give a 2/5 because the food was really solid and our waitress was great! But the wait and the way the hostess (and a manager) handled it was really frustrating. 

I arrived at 1p on a Saturday and was told it would be a half hour wait for our party of six (including my six month old). I was okay with that considering my out of town guests hadn't arrived yet. I figured that by the time I used the restroom, got my little boy settled and they arrived, things would move along. Well, it got to be 1:35 and I went back to the hostess station to check in. She did apologize for the wait, but said that they were clearing off our tables now.

So I went back to chatting with my guests. But time went on, and on, and on. Before I knew it, it had been an hour. I checked in again, she assured me that the previous party just now left, and they were now clearing the table.....so....the same answer she gave me 25 minutes ago?? 

A few minutes later we were finally led back to our table. The nook meant for my baby's stroller was SUPER tight. After our waitress noticed me struggle-busing with that she told me that the sliding door behind me could be opened further to give us more space. How sweet of her to tell me!!! Why hadn't the hostess done that?!? She saw me having a lot of trouble trying to get my little one settled, but just stood and watched.

Worried about slow service, we all ordered almost immediately. Our food did come out in a timely manner. And it really was quite enjoyable.

Another woman who I assume might be part of management came by later and thanked us for being so patient during our wait. Again, I felt like I was just being placated. I felt like they were simply going through the motions and saying what I wanted to hear. But don't apologize, do something about it!

At the end of this experience I just felt embarrassed that I had suggested such a place to my friends and out of town guests. They were nice and didn't complain and I had my hands full with a fussy baby and didn't have the opportunity or mental capacity to say something at the time. But I really felt bad that this was the experience I gave to my guests. I'm not sure if I would recommend this place to anyone based on this experience.",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,11,4,2,Pg9TV1u6kdJHEmHzgc66jA

4583868,2015-04-06,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"We were fooled by the amazing reviews on Yelp, and decided to dine here last week.  We were a group of 4 girls staying at The Ceasars.  We were super excited to have some Mexican food at a place that is so highly rated.

Man - were we wrong and disappointed!!

Service: We were seated promptly and our waitress seemed friendly.  No issues so far.  We ordered our drinks and an order of guacamole for the table. We ordered our food (more on this disaster later), and started chatting.  After 20 minutes, our waitress stopped by to see if everything was ok.  We asked her what happened to our guacamole, and she said ""Oh no - I forgot...sorry"".  Yup - we knew she had forgotten.  

Food:
3 out of 4 of us ordered the following:
BLACK BEAN & CORN ESQUITE SALAD
baby bibb | chipotle aioli | corn tortilla strips | panela | avocado 12

****WARNING******
- This salad appears to be vegetarian on the menu (check the description above), but came with a big piece of chicken on the top.  Our waitress confirmed this was vegetarian, we saw no mention of chicken on the menu, and here comes a big piece of chicken. When we asked the manager about this, he completely ignored the question and said that he would get the salad re-made.  Of course you will, but where does it say chicken on your menu?  No answer.

- This salad is $12 on the menu, but we were charged $18 on our bill.  Seriously???
********

This salad is awful.  There is a big piece of green covered with big chunks of cheese, corn, black beans, and very very spice dressing.  The dressing was so spicy, that I could barely eat 2-3 spoons.

During this whole process of our orders being messed up, our waitress didnt come over once.  She knew the order was messed up, knew she had told us the salad was vegetarian, but not once did she come by, apologize, and asked if we needed anything.  She just stayed at a safe distance.

We did not finish our food, left the salad as is, and told the manager about our disappointed.  He did not charge us for the salad, but that's besides the point.  Maybe the tacos, or other things on the menu are great as the Yelp reviews look amazing.  But our experience was terrible....both in terms of service and the food.

There is a plethora of restaurants at The Ceasars, so next time I am at Ceasars, I will avoid this one and go to the other restaurants.",eLwBpaKnlbKEhOZGy7bnyQ,2,0,1,ePCLqKccR53_h78i0ZV-Sg

This is a great idea for large groups as you can taste every single item on their brunch menu. Also, If you are tired of your regular orange juice mimosas they also offer champagne with pomegranate or passion fruit. I personally like sweet and fruity drinks so I enjoyed the passion fruit one the most. Must try dishes, the Chilaquiles, the chicken and waffles, the fried green tomatillos and steak and eggs.. Or if you can eat more just order one of each, at the end of the day every dish is unlimited!

I love how we were drooling over her food on TV, and then be able to dine at her restaurant located a few blocked away. That's another beauty of Vegas - almost every celebrity chef has a restaurant here! This one is located in Caesar's Palace.

It was really empty on Sunday around dinnertime. We were seated immediately and were served chips right away along with 3 different types of salsa. I'm not a huge chips and salsa person, but those chips were too addicting. We ordered guacamole and their famous ceviche to share. For entree, I got carne asada tacos, and for drinks, a free house margarita with Yelp check-in! What a deal!

Guacamole: Delicious, with huge chucks of avocado. Really fresh and bright flavors. You know how you're supposed to eat chips with a side of guac? Well I was eating more guac with a side of chips. Literally eating the guac with my fork and just sprinkled some chips on top.

Ceviche: I don't remember the name of the one we got, but it was on their specials menu. It had giant pieces of prawn in there, along with tomatoes, cucumber, and mango. Light and refreshing. It came with only 3 pita crisps, so we used chips again to dip the rest. I would come back to try the rest of their ceviches! 

Carne Asada Tacos: The meat was a bit on the dry side, so I was a little disappointed. But nothing extra guac can't fix! Comes with a side of black beans and two different flavored rices. I tasted tomato in one, and either cilantro or spinach in the other, but both were good. 

Our waitress was really nice. She made recommendations, checked up on us regularly, and even told us stories of Mary Sue and Susan Feniger coming into the restaurant.",9IX2jJzDNvODLA9EzSKV5A,1,0,5,HE_ggXuUwjE7mxCfeSlzQw

The brunch menu offers a great assortment of ""small plates"" options for the table to share.  They start off with some wonderful pastries including their guava empanada and a fresh fruit plate.

With larger groups, the server will bring out an assortment of items for you.   Alex was awesome and very accommodating.  We enjoyed quite an assortment from the menu - the huevos rancheros is always great, fried green tomatillos (which can be ordered without the bacon), steak and eggs, oysters rockefeller, and breakfast fries (also available vegetarian).  The back and jalapeno PBJ is a great way to end the meal!  Add on the unlimited mimosas for an additional $10 per person, and you are set for a great experience.  Yes, they are very attentive with beverages, too, so you won't get dry!

I LOVE this venue and encourage you to try it out.  For parking, there is a convenient valet off of the Strip near the Planet Hollywood Restaurant sign near Forum Shops.  You can also self park in the Colosseum Garage and walk across the Casino, out the doors between Fizz and the Colosseum to bypass the long trek through Forum Shops.

They get my ""A"" rating for terrific service (have yet to have a bad experience for six visits), consistently great food, and great value.

In house chefs, and delicious unique drink selection. The salsas are a tasty variety of 3 different kinds served with chips just to start. It is ABSOLUTELY worth every penny!! The flavors are delicate and plentiful, which mix beautifully!! 

Truly no words for how delicious and wonderful the food blends, mixed with an attentive waiting staff and polite hostesses. They truly understand their customer. I would hands down recommend this to anyone and everyone. You CANNOT go wrong. I rarely give such a review but they are entirely deserving based on their phenomenal attention to detail in every aspect.

4943758,2016-04-14,1,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I happened to be in Vegas for a conference and lo and behold, found out that my Uncle and his wife were in town as well and staying right next door at Caesars. Hooray! So I was looking for a reasonably priced place with reliable food that wouldn't be too ""weird"". Enter Border Grill - I'd enjoyed their Mandalay location and think this one is just as good.

To start, it's a PITA to get here - they're on ground level (not casino) level of the Forum shops, and signs aren't clear at all. Calling the restaurant didn't help much - my advice - look for Carmine's and keep going, it's at the end of that hall, down the silly spiral escalator. Anyway, after much fruitless wandering of the Forum Shops much like Moses in the desert, we finally made it.

I started with a house margarita ($11, not bad for Vegas) and we shared queso fundido ($13) which was really good. I mean, you can't spell ""fundido"" without FUN, right? Their version includes chorizo and poblano strips and is quite tasty indeed.

For an entrée I picked a chicken dish - basically it was roasted chicken on saffron rice and it was very good. A large portion and the chicken was super moist. I'd order it again. Service was outstanding - very attentive and fun.

4958546,2016-10-11,2,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I had brunch with some friends at the Border Grill Forum Shops on a Saturday.  Our reservation was for 11:30 but some of us arrived earlier and we were seated early in a comfortable half booth/half table.  

As others note, the brunch deal at Border Grill is pretty good (by Vegas standards):  for $35 you get unlimited small plates from a list of about 15 or so.  For an extra $10 you get the bottomless mimosas, with flavors well beyond the typical OJ.  Our servers were fantastic.  To begin, when we ordered a dish instead of preparing a single serving of each dish for each diner, they would have a larger order of the dish prepared for the table.  So, we got 4 shrimp and grits on one plate instead of 1 or 2.  Made the table less crowded with fewer plates.  Also, we were brought more mimosas on a fairly regular basis.  There was never a time when I had an empty glass until the end of the meal.  Fantastic service.

Of the small plates, I tried:  french toast, brisket sliders, pigs in a blanket, plantain empanadas, steak and egg, shrimp and grits, churro tots, serrano ham waffles, breakfast fries, and chicken tamales.  There is so much, I could go back and have a fantastic meal with just the items I didn't try this time.  My favorites were the steak and egg, shrimp and grits, and breakfast fries.  The steak and egg is not a large portion, but it's larger than I was expecting given that it's a small plate brunch.  The steak was cooked properly every time we ordered it, and the egg is appropriately runny.  It's served with some hash browns which could have been crispier, but overall, it was my favorite dish.

The shrimp and grits were strong as well.  The grits are smooth and seasoned well, and the shrimp is not overcooked.  We ordered several rounds of this as well.  The breakfast fries are enormous, nothing small about this plate.  They are topped with all of your breakfast favorites.  We only needed one for the table, but it was great.

Nothing was a miss for me, but the pigs in a blanket were too dry for me, the serrano ham waffle didn't have much ham flavor (but it still tasted like a waffle, so that's good), and the bun on the sliders was too hard.  But, these aren't huge issues, and certainly not reasons to skip brunch at Border Grill.

I am not a big mimosa (or brunch drinks in general really) guy, but these were strong.  Passionfruit, pomegranate, and other flavors beyond the typical offerings.  They were refreshing and had a nice mix of booze to juice.  And, as I noted earlier, they were brought to our table with great frequency.

Before we knew it, we had been at Border Grill for 2 hours.  You don't realize how quickly the time passes.  It was a great, easy brunch and they really take care of you.  I will absolutely do this again on future trips to Vegas.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,5,2,4,PYSnKf3vov1JjP795Kszxw

Queso was good. For entrees everyone was equally disappointed. There was just no spice or flavor to any of the dishes (tacos, enchiladas nor quesadilla). The roasters cauliflower was tasty--just very oily.

I ate here with a girlfriend on our last day in Vegas.  The location of Border Grill is really easy to get to, even though it is in a huge complex at Caesar's Palace Forum Shops.  Border Grill is conveniently located on the bottom floor of the shops right off of the Strip, but it was still fun to shop around the many stores before heading here to eat.  

Our server was very nice and attentive. She quickly brought us out chips and salsa, which was all very good.  I ordered the steak nachos which were delicious and a very good portion.  My only complaint is price, but at a place in Vegas and especially at the Forum Shops I was not shocked that the food here is a little more expensive.  They do have a limited menu, so there weren't too many choices to choose from.

If you follow me, you know I've spent three to four  months a year for the past 10 years in Vegas.  That's a lot of meals in a lot of restaurants.  It means something when I call this the single worst restaurant in Vegas.

The food is awful and uncharacteristic of Border Grill, it forced my dining companion and I to try the Mandalay Bay location on another evening just to compare.  This location has a serious problem.

Peruvian Ceviche - excessively tight and chewy pieces of fishy mahi mahi with ginger, lime, chili and DISTILLED VINEGAR.  The vinegar had an acidic bite so pronounced it masked all other flavors while accentuating the aroma of the fish.  Exact opposite of the vibrant, refreshing, tart flavor at the other location.

Roasted Beets - extremely bitter thanks to burnt pepper coating the surface of the beets.  The bitterness overpowers everything else in the dish.

Short Rib Enchiladas - Supposedly topped with a chayote, watercress slaw as presented by the other location, this one was simply sauced.  Very dry, dense, finely pulled short ribs on the inside.  Obviously premade, refrigerated, and poorly reheated.  Very one dimensional in flavor.

Special Fish of the Day - Spice rubbed then blackened (an understatement).  A quote from my dining companion ""This taste like I licked the burnt inside top of a Webber grill"".  Inedible.  

The kick in the nuts, the manager on duty's cocky response that his employees all liked the dishes before walking away.  (He sent our server to apologize for him and comp the meal).

Finding the good; warm ambiance, very good servers (excludes the manager), well made cocktails.  Unfortunately that doesn't cut it in a city with so many incredible dining options.  

A failure of a restaurant and one that will definitely bring down the reputation of Border Grill as an enterprise.

The table next to us somehow managed to hit every item on the menu, whereas we barely made it halfway. It would definitely help to bring more than a couple stomachs. The mimosas were good, although some were almost straight up champagne, which was great. There was just enough juice in them to not make it feel too boozy. 

Of the items we had, the standouts were the chorizo tacos, green corn tamales, shrimp and grits, and the chicken and waffles. The only real miss was the bacon pb&j, which might work for a different set of taste buds. They also started us off with sweet empanadas which were delicious but not on the brunch menu. 

The best part of all of this was the service. We had Perry as our server, and let him choose the progression of plates that came out.

5119278,2015-06-27,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I came for dinner for restaurant week and was disappointed.  For such a highly reviewed restaurant, I was surprised how poorly executed some of the dishes were.  

The service staff was polite and attentive but needs more training.  It may seem like a small issue but, at these prices I expect to eat my soup with a soup spoon, not a teaspoon.   I brought it to the attention of the staff, but did not want to seem precious, and did not make a big deal of it. 

The salsas were OK.  The highlight in my opinion was the tomatillo salsa. The arbol lacked heat and the chipotle had a muted taste of something. Perhaps garlic?  Anyway, not my favorite. 

The shrimp gazpacho was good. A solid dish.  Fresh and simple, I enjoyed it. 

The ribeye was a disaster. The meat was overcooked with one side obviously cooked longer than the other.  It seemed that the person minding the grill forgot about it for a couple of minutes then served it anyway. 
The chilaquiles under the meat were too greasy and soggy and did not let the flavor of the meat shine. I think this would have been helped by putting them to one side  and letting the cut of meat speak for itself. That said, I personally thought the meat was under seasoned. 

I was conflicted about the flan. The texture was thicker than I expect from flan. I have had flan many times from many countries and this was the thickest consistency  I have had. Just shy of extra firm tofu. The flavor was good.  Not too sweet... And the berry on the side were a nice touch.   

Decor was beautiful and pleasant. 

All in all though, I would not go back. For $50 on a restaurant week prix fixe I would have expected more from the food. Other dishes may be much better but I would have thought they would have highlighted their stuff for Restaurant week.",bmp2b6JNeCMIZ2HGtBSVFA,0,0,2,spbkLEgRlOLtUo3Rl4OpTw

The short rib enchiladas were too. They were covered in spinach and drizzled with a sauce that only a wanna be California cook would think of. The server said that everything was prepped in the morning so I couldn't have carne asada enchiladas instead of chicken. The bar is nothing special.

Even though this is a review of the Caesars Palace Border Grill at lunch, I first want to recommend that you go to Mandalay Bay for brunch. Lunch at Border Grill is good but the brunch we had at the Mandalay Bay location (probably the same as the one at Caesars Palace but with improved ambiance) is AMAZING. Best meal of our trip.

The Caesars Palace location isn't as nice as Mandalay Bay's. While the Mandalay Bay restaurant has a patio and energy, the one in Caesars Palace is at a dead spot in a mall. When being seated, I think everyone passed up the empty interior in favor of the patio area, but this ""outdoor"" area was still in a mall so it still had that annoying echoing mall effect.

The complimentary chips with three salsas were quite good. However, I wouldn't order the appetizer sampler again. The highlight was the quinoa fritters. They were yummy but the downside was that we were able to eat them in one bite. (I took two bites to savor them.) The green tamale bites had good flavor but they were less like corn cake and more pasty like creamed corn. I was not a big fan of the plantain empanadas. I couldn't identify the odd flavor when I tried them and had to be reminded of the filling (ah yes - plantains). Still, they were only okay.

The ceviche changed everything around. Well, the good ceviche did anyway. The Peruvian one with albacore, coconut, and plantain chips was one of the best I've had. The Caribbean one with mahi mahi carpaccio, shaved celery, and cilantro was only okay and paltry on the fish.

The crispy potato rajas tacos were pretty good but not amazing. I recall mostly just tasting the chipotle crema.

One of my kids got a cheese quesadilla and the other fried fish. I was disappointed that the fish came with ketchup and there was not even a tartar sauce option. I really don't like kowtowing to the lowest common denominator for kids' meals. At least make them a little more challenging than the usual ghetto of kid-friendly items on every kids' restaurant menu.

The chips and 3 salsas were very good. Obviously made in-house, the chips were hot and done just enough and not burned. The salsas were tasty. Tomatillo, a fires roasted and a regular type. Very good. 

We ordered Yucatán Pork and Short Rib Enchiladas. The pork was braised in a banana leaf with caramelized onions and topped with guacamole. Different. Almost Caribbean style. Served with black beans and rice. Excellent. 

They also came with some pan caramelized plantains. Very good. Sweet and good side to the pork. 

The Short Rib Enchiladas were very flavorful. The shredded beef was very tender and also too mushy, but if that's the way it's supposed to be, then alright. Great flavor since we love short ribs. 

It was late so we didn't order dessert but I'm sure we would have liked it as well. 

If you want traditional Mexican with some fusion type twists added, you'll like it. Prices were reasonable and service was fast and courteous.  They didn't rush us which was nice. I'm sure we'll be back.",5P4J6isIOngEkFsT17Gh7w,2,0,5,Zp2q_EcFuj8AX1QP9zum4Q

Appetizer:  house guacamole-was a bit overpriced for the portion size and nothing really to write home about.  Should have tried the ceviche, which is what they are famous for.  The house chips and salsa is delicious, ask for the extra hot sauce.

Dinner:  
carne asada quesadilla- as elevated as as you can make quesadilla.
Carne asada tacos-pretty good tacos on homemade tortillas
Roast chicken-this one sounded so simple yet was over the top delicious.  Half chicken served whole with saffron rice.
Short rib enchiladas-very good and one of the most popular items

How many of us wake up on a Sunday - last day of a weekend trip to Vegas - tired, hung-over, hungry, hating life, and have about 5 mins til check-out time???

I usually slug it over to the buffet to get some protein in my stomach to try to get over my hang-over and for bottomless mamosas for... no good reason whatsoever.

This was a great alternative. Its nice that the servers bring the food to you versus you having to walk back and forth to the buffet.  

Our group shared a little bit of everything (some things twice) and it was all good. My favorites were the Bacon and Egg Quesadilla, the Chilaquiles, and the Chrizo and Egg Tacos.  

The Michelada really hit the spot.  Great to get over a hangover while giving you that little buzz required to stumble back out onto the strip to find a place to hit the tables til its time to go home.

Having last visited Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger's second Las Vegas outpost of Border Grill on New Years Day for brunch, it was not until General Manager Jennifer Holley tweeted a picture of festive holiday pumpkin that I recalled an invite to stop by for some ceviche - a special ""Day of The Dead"" menu launching on the anniversary of my second year in Nevada an added bonus as I sat with a friend and her son on the ""patio"" for a celebratory multi-course meal.

Conveniently situated at the base of spiral escalators on the ground floor of Caesars' Forum Shops with the Too Hot Tamales signature style offering a backdrop to upscale Latin favorites crafted from largely local, sustainable, and organic products, it was moments after 6:00pm that menus were confiscated, Jennifer taking the reins and steering us through eleven plates, four cocktails, three types of salsa, and a few too many warm tortilla chips.

Tasting a refreshing Cucumber Cooler before sipping the sweet Pineapple Margarita far more quickly than usual for someone who usually nurses his drinks, it was with smooth Haas Avocados pureed with a bit of heat that the meal got started and having been promised ceviche Mrs. Holley delivered precisely that just a few moments later, all four items crafted at the specially designed bar absolutely outstanding in terms of taste and texture, the candied pumpkin with cinnamon notes offering the best bites from my standpoint as sweetened plantain chips acted as spoons with heat turned up by Aji Amarillo.

Minding the youngster with chicken fingers, though he more than happily tasted from the special duet of Enchiladas and Pork as well, suffice it to say that anyone with a sense of ingredient quality is bound to appreciate the obvious time and skill involved in crafting such a deep and aromatic mole, the green ""sacred leaf"" tortillas another well thought piece to the puzzle with a slightly sweet finish helping to lighten the heft of the meat with a bit of crunch added by crispy chicharrones.

Thrilled by two more Margaritas, the Acai infused iteration a bit more my style than the smoke and spice infused Blood Orange, another round of savories featured two items off the regular dinner menu and although the flautas were essentially traditional Mexican fare benefited by superior ingredients the warm beet salad was a spotlight-stealing sort of side dish with great texture provided by creamy fresh queso while the natural sweetness of carrots provided a deft foil to bitter beet greens.

Generally unimpressed by most flan, though happy to have my mind changed, it was with a Día de Muerto duo that desserts got started and although both the creamy coconut and textured sweet potato rounds were better than most they simply could not compete with what I still consider to be the best Rice Pudding on this side of the Atlantic.

****Admittedly trending more European in my tastes than Latin (or Asian for that matter) Border Grill disproves those who seem to believe that ""Ethnic Food"" shouldn't be 'upscale,' and with superior ingredients generally yielding a superior product the experience is further benefited by top notch service with both the food and beverage offering enough variety for virtually all palates to be pleased.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,5,4,89RoJCUjy44VqVCdBs2f4Q

PROS:

Ambiance: Very spacious, clean, modern and beautifully decorated. 

Service: 5 star service! Our waitress was amazing. She was very friendly, made wonderful suggestions and was very attentive. 

Food: Our group opted for the unlimited small plates for $34.99. Since we had a larger party, our waitress told us that she would bring a variety of the more popular dishes in more generous potions so all of us could sample a bite. The food was extremely fresh and flavorful. 

-Peruvian Shrimp & Grits: This was my favorite dish! I am not a big fan of grits due to the texture of it. Their grits were very flavorful and soft (mashed potato like consistency). The shrimps were huge and perfectly cooked. It was also drenched in the most amazing sauce. Must try!

-Ceviche Del Dia: Fresh ingredients. The lime juices gave everything an extra kick. 

- Breakfast Fries: My group first picked on the outside, then we discovered that there was braised beef in the middle which made this dish 10x better. The beef was very tender complimenting the crunchiness of the fries and oozing egg yoke from the egg. 

-Steak & Eggs: The steak was cooked perfectly. The hash browns could have been a tad crunchier but it was still good. 

-Esquite Lettuce Wraps: Great use of all the fresh ingredients. The chipotle aioli was perfect, not too strong but not too bland either. 

-Yucatan Eggs Benedict: The perfectly cooked egg and the pork was very flavorful. 

-Pigs in a Blanket: The flakiness of the puff pastry went very well with the chorizo. 

-Chili Relleno: Great flavor. The spiciness of the chili slowly creeps up on you!

-Shrimp Relleno Tacos: Lightly battered shrimp. The avocado cream was on point. 

CONS: 

-Green corn tamales: Not a big fan. It was too sweet and too mushy. 

-Tres Leches French Toast: Too soggy and sweet for my taste.

-Churro donuts: A bit too soft 

Overall, $34.99 is not bad at all for the amount and different variety of food that the offer. I highly recommend!",l6Z76oifiTSp4zNb4o91TA,16,11,5,HbuIRQIFzC8In8jz1aw7OQ

5306104,2015-03-30,3,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Looking for a place to have dinner I decided to come to Border Grill. I was familiar with the name and know about the celeb chefs that created this chain so I figured i might be in for a treat. In all honesty, its a step above El Torito. 

They started off the dinner by bringing out some chips and 3 different types of salsa. The salsas were not bad but not spicy enough for me. But I have a very high spicy tolerance so cant really fairly rank the salsas. Not bad though. with my Yelp check I got a free blanco margarita. Pretty average margarita and glad I got it for free, as the price for this drink was $11 and it was not worth $11 by any means. 

To eat I ordered the Pork Carnitas.. Pork Carnitas???? Kind of an oxymoron because carnitas are always pork.  When you see Carnitas on a menu that automatically registers that it is pork. Theres no such thing as beef or chicken carnitas right? I'm mexican so I like to think I know what I'm talking about in this matter. Anyways, I ordered those and they came with a couple of corn tortillas plus rice and beans. The carnitas were fine. not going to win any awards. Rice and beans were average. Tortillas could have been hotter and heated up over an open flame to give them that burnt flavor that I love. Like I said at the beginning of this review. A step above El Torito. That pretty much describes this place in a nutshell. And at the cost of $24 not worth the price. But that applies to pretty much anyplace in vegas.",d7CK2tNS7mwwR-MlSjs23w,3,3,3,Kh4bo-5l5vnXWJssJSxM0A

Wooo! Border Grill was great! It blew me out of the water with how tasty the food was! I've only tried the AYCE brunch, but I left feeling like it was a great experience. At $35/person it might seem expensive, but you get so many options and they are all made fresh to order. It's like a buffet with all the choice, but all the freshness of a restaurant. And a buffet would cost about the same anyway. 

I think we literally tried everything on the brunch menu, but a few standouts were the steak and eggs, the crispy shell chorizo taco, the braised short rib on the fries, the bread pudding (YUM), and the steamed sweet corn. Everything was tasty, but we tried so many things it's hard to remember it all. 

Service was excellent and the food came out quickly. But not so quickly that we felt like we were shoveling it in. We took our time and had a really lovely loooong brunch. I'm not sure how quickly I'd return because Las Vegas has so many options that I'd love to explore, but you really can't go wrong with eating at Border Grill.

After searching for a nearby Mexican restaurant to grab a cocktail and an appetizer, we landed here based on positive reviews and celebrity chef - do not make the same mistake. Two decent margaritas and three entirely flavorless salsas in, we asked the waitress for a recommendation between the steak nachos and the queso. She RAVED about the queso. It arrived and I was optimistic about its appearance despite having just eaten three salsas that make mild Pace seem like a flavor explosion. First bite of queso and I couldn't tell if it was just my dulled-down taste buds so I asked for a second opinion and took another bite. Nope. It literally tasted like nothing despite being machengo topped with grilled poblanos and chorizo. The most interesting part about this is I had been texting with a friend who is a Vegas aficionado and was describing the experience and she GUESSED which restaurant it was based upon my description of the subpar, overpriced food.

I live off of Mexican food and never had one like this before.  The service was awesome, thank you Perry!  The guacamole was very good, a little too much lime for me but didn't stop me from scraping the bowl for the last bits of it.  The chips were fresh, warm, salty and thick.  The three salsa selections were perfect with great flavors and just the right amount of heat.  The queso fundido with chorizo was heaven.  A scoop of that in the flour tortilla is a bite I'll remember for a long time.  We had the skirt steak and short rib enchiladas for entries.  The flavors, textures and sauces were incredible, and the skirt steak was cooked perfectly.  Finished off our feast with coffee and donuts, the donut being the best churro ever and the coffee being a wonderful espresso ice cream.  The place is difficult to get to but well worth the effort.

5425616,2015-04-07,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Food good. We had the charred ribeye and pescado veracruzano. I never say no to a whole fish. Both our plates were really good. My fish was excellent and I would order that again. Ribeye very tasty. 

The only misstep? The free margarita that comes with the Yelp check in. It was premixed and had no alcohol at all. We sent it back. Got a little 'tude, but I think our waitress tried it (at the bar) and realized it was pretty bad. So she had a fresh one made. Seriously tho'. If you're going to offer a drink like that for free, then don't have an offer at all. It really doesn't start you off on a good note, you know? 

I like the Mandalay Bay location better, but it's nice that this one is an alternate location and more centrally located. Like the chips and trio of salsas. 

Tip: for $3 per person, you can buy a 1/2 off your entree discount at the halfpricetickets box offices. Considering our entrees were $39 each, it's worth it.",TzMlvuLT3qYtlMbhfH4LJg,1,1,4,1YpnK64LnH-ikblaFizg7Q

5430881,2017-07-27,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"This is one of the top Mexican restaurants in the pacific time zone IF YOU STEP OUTSIDE OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE. Do not order a quesadilla with your Bud Light and expect fireworks to go off or something. I'd advise you to come at night for their dinner menu as well.

The Yucatán Pork is their signature dish. It's a slow roasted pork dish based off cochinita pibil. The flavor is amazing but I understand that not everyone is seeking red meat for dinner so I also recommend the Ciudad Chicken. Saffron rice, rotisserie style chicken and cilantro cream sauce... it's my personal favorite. For vegetarians, I'd go with either the Esquite Salad or Chile Relleno.

Take advantage of Border Grill's margaritas. They use all natural ingredients and you can really taste the difference (and feel the difference the next day). Blood Orange Jalapeño margarita has a chile mole as the rim instead of salt. This is a tart and spicy drink. Spicy margaritas that incorporate jalapeños are becoming more popular but this is still the best one I've had.

Lastly, I want to mention their ceviche bar. I'm not always in a ceviche mood but again, Border Grill does wonderful things to the flavor of their ceviche. The sauces they garnish with are all unbelievably vibrant. I believe it's still the only ceviche bar on the strip so if you're a fan of ceviche, this particular location will be fitting for you.

Overall, I certainly recommend this place but as I've mentioned you must take risks with your order and try something new to fully appreciate what this restaurant has to offer!",dNTPm5Qo3o40chNGytsi8Q,2,0,5,Hm2D5kBl1-AwtCNbQy5exw
5434722,2018-06-11,1,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"They closed this location right after our visit on Mother's Day, but I think this review is still relevant because the menu for unlimited small plates brunch at Mandalay Bay is similar. On our visit, there were no complaints about the food and the price was a good value. We came early enough to avoid most of the holiday crowd. But the service was on the slow side with the heavy volume and our server covering too many tables.

The special brunch menu consisted of a about 20 plates with two additional choices offered at the omelette station. Pricing was $42 for unlimited small plates for adults with bottomless mimosas for Mom and $10 for anyone else that wanted to take the unlimited citrus champagne route. The guava empanadas were a great start and we gladly obliged when offered a second order, but don't eat too many and save room for your tapas. We tasted 12 of the tapas with our favorites being the tres leches French toast, the Baja ceviche, and the Peruvian shrimp and grits. Our least favorite was the breakfast fries, which seemed to be just a filler. If you're a heat-seeker, you won't be disappointed as most of the dishes have a little spice to kick things up.

We made the mistake of letting our server time the delivery of the courses and simply, the food was not brought out fast enough because our server had extended absences dealing with other tables which included two double-digit parties. By the time the two hour mark hit, we had received 12 of the tapas. I would say out of the 120 minutes we were there, 30 minutes of it were spent eating the small plates and 90 minutes were spent just waiting. We intended to try all 22 of the dishes, but after a certain amount of time, that window closes of being able to eat more and you just start to feel full. I'll cut them some slack with it being one of the busiest days of the year. And I'll definitely be back to the other Vegas location with a better game plan of taking the initiative and ordering 4-5 plates at a time at our own discretion.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,1,1,4,TTp4UGmlGi_1vFBaQH43Lg

5707250,2015-09-17,2,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger are the creators of the Border Grill restaurant. The first restaurant was located on Melrose Avenue and in 1990, moved to its current home on 4th Street in Santa Monica. Since then, Border Grill has expanded to Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (1999) and The Forum Shops at Caesars (2014).

We were staying at the Nobu Hotel in Caesar's Palace, and decided to have a late 9:00 pm dinner at the Forum Shops location.  It is not located in the heart of the mall, but closer to the Strip, next to Joe's Seafood, where the spiral escalators are located.

If you use the Yelp app, you can get a free Blanca Margarita, an $11 value, just for checking in.  In addition, if you sign up for the VIP club, you can get complimentary appetizers, dessert and 15% off the check.  In addition, Border Grill is a supporter of #NoKidHungry, and for the entire month of September they are donating $1 from every Roasted Tomato and Bacon Guacamole purchased at Border Grill and Border Grill Trucks.

Even though it was 9:00, we were still not very hungry and decided to share the Border Classic appetizer and the chicken poblano enchilada plate.  The appetizer plate had 2 green corn tamales, 2 quinoa fritters and 2 plantain empanadas. The enchilada plate came with 3 per order, but the restaurant was kind enough to split the entree for us.  Very thoughtful. 

The dinner was exactly what we needed, and, since we were VIP, we were given a small sorbet for dessert, which cleansed our palate and was a perfect ending to a great meal.  After all the applied discounts, our bill came to $31 before tax and tip.... truly a great bargain on the Las Vegas strip!",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,10,6,4,LKA2JDVh7TBm6aGMKr0ZFQ

My boyfriend ordered the 2 dollar happy hour Barbacoa tacos, (spelling? Sorry, I don't eat meat), and he, who is consistently a very neutral person, was drooling over these. He loved it so much, he ordered another one. You must stop here when passing through the shops at Cesar's!",9U6guzTfe1jptkTEUZSkYQ,0,0,5,jnG9yrDb4DRRuC7psHoYwA

5779359,2017-03-03,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Stopped in while shopping and found a new ""go to"" while at the Forum Shops. 

Atmosphere - It is hidden and I've walked by many times before stopping in. It was not crowded during a slow period but they quoted a wait so we went to the bar and we are glad we did. The interior is nicely decorated, comfortable and a nice place to hang out while hydrating from shopping.

Service - We had some great advice at the bar on the different margarita options and enjoyed the education. Later found out that a manager had jumped behind the bar while they were busy and he made some killer margaritas. I like the teamwork attitude of the staff and the fact a manager is jumping to help, they were all professional but fun.

Food/Drinks - The only food we had (beside the chips/salsa, which were very good) was the ceviche. They have many different types and liked that we could try a combo plate. It was great. The Margs were all great but we really enjoyed the homemade sangria. It was the best we've had in recent memory and will go back for a glass next time were in town.

Thanks for a great afternoon.",nYCuT2XuhFvxgg7906-wyg,0,0,5,neU-VJRlTXNFR5mdDO1fSA

The issue I have was the service. It was terrible. I had to ask to order a drink,  ask for a menu to order food.  No one checked on how our food was and never asked if we needed another drink or anything else.  I had to ask to get additional drinks!  I would have spent well over $100 for just two of us and got better service at Chili's... The sad thing was, they were not busy! However,  the saving grace was that the Manger came up to take care of our bill and she asked how everything was. I hesitated and she asked if there was a problem and so I proceeded to inform her of our experience. She was very nice and appreciated the feedback and was also kind enough to pay for our our drinks. It was a very nice gesture and much appreciated that she asked and had done something to help remedy the bad service. That got the 3rd star!",K2J-s6E9XlltNTvHTbxlmA,0,0,3,yyBD0iMLm2Jq_H-YgXcUxQ

5891315,2017-07-29,0,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"Came here with the wife yesterday during our final night in Vegas. She loves Mexican food and we wanted to go out with a bang and this had quite the high rating. Plus, since we were staying at The Flamingo, Ceasar's is right across the street. 

For location's sake (because we struggled), this is on the first floor right when you come down the stairs or use the elevator. 

The hostess was friendly and seated us right away despite not having reservations. The place is gorgeous. My wife and I discussed it for a bit because it was difficult to articulate the mix of upscale ambiance with the ""fun but classy"" decorations and designs throughout the restaurant. Not cheesy or corny at all. 

My challenge with this particular review is that I've only been once and see the potential for greatness in this place that we possibly missed. I think our problem was the waiter. 

He wasn't all the way there. Wasn't rude or lazy or anything just...not all there. His interactions felt forced and his volume was too loud for the ambiance. Every time he approached the table he would clap his hands loudly and go ""OK GUYS SO...!"" 

We asked for the plantains as a starter and since it took a bit for him to come back, we ordered our entrees at the same. The plantains never came and their absence was never acknowledged. We got our entrees and said, forget it, waiting to see if it would somehow be on the bill. Thankfully it wasn't.

My wife had the short rib enchiladas which were good but not 5-star worthy. I had the skirt steak and it was quite flavorful but, unfortunately, came out a bit lukewarm. 

I had a Jack and Coke because somehow, in a place like this, they did not have Gentleman's Jack and my wife had a Black Cherry Mojito. When the waiter came back to ask about a second round, I asked if he had any recommendations on specialty drinks that used dark liquor rather than the tequila and vodka staples that permeated the menu. 

My man was at a complete loss. Didn't offer to ask the bartender, didn't try to ask about my preferences, was just like ""ahh, yeah, not, I mean, not really,  like, those are the drink specials, I mean unless you know something..."" THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU. Just ordered a Corona and Patron which wasn't bad but they game a lime that wouldn't fit inside of the bottle neck so I had to peel it myself. Seems minimal but in a place like this, they should know how to size the lime for a Corona bottle. 

And I found an eyelash that was clearly not mine on my plate. 

We'd give it another shot; our initial visit just leaves me thinking the place to be a bit overrated.",fkZVEWJiBjGbmeBKJGOL3g,1,0,3,uGSxxOZufgEmLELdIrJ32w
5893369,2015-04-03,1,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"First time at this location was for a complimentary LV Weekly Tequila Appreciation Tasting. 
Besides an in depth lesson on tequila making & tasting with reps from el jimador & Herradua, we also got to enjoy chips & salsa, guac & chips and a taco bar. The salsa was good, the guac was lacking in flavor and the beef tacos were very good. The rice and hot salsa with the tacos was also very tasty. The menu has a nice variety and the one margarita I had at the tasting (some fruit flavor) was very tasty. 
The restaurant is located in the Forum Shops lower level and was hard to find, as it's near the spiral staircases which to me are out of the way from everything.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,1,4,HaD44DLFry2lu0MfyshUXA

So I ventured out to the strip and hit the Forum Shops. This restaurant is located in the Forum shop near the Joe's Stone Crab and Other Room entrance. The Restaurant isn't to far from the strip entrance and valet. Not too Shabby!  
Now onto the restaurant, it has indoor and outdoor seating. A full stocked bar and a wait for it..... A Ceviche Bar!  Yup- a Ceviche Bar, that also makes cold pressed drinks.  I inquired a little about the Ceviche Bar and it's open all day and they have someone there who will prep your Ceviche in front of you and even let you try some of there favorites!  Perfect opportunity to sample a few and probably change your order around lol.  I think it's such a brilliant idea! 
On to the dishes they have a lot of choices that all sound good. We ordered a trio of Ceviche to put our taste buds to the test, I really loved the one with the Celery leaf. It had a perfect balance of flavor and texture, it was also more on the citrus side which won points with my taste buds.  We also order some of there enchiladas and I loved the one seafood one, it was like no enchilada I've ever tasted!  I also loved their Limeade Sparkling Pomegranate drink, it kept my mouth happy and rehydrated with all the chips I kept consuming- they have the best fresh salsa and chips to keep your hunger at bay.
Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant and look forward to coming again and tasting all there unique dishes and coming back for some more tamales....",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,0,0,4,Z7wmi1eEnL9Uz40SGNpWxA

Much like the first time I discovered 99 cent pizza in NYC (and realized it was actually good), I did a serious double take when I saw the prices.

As you would in any Mexican restaurant, start with chips and salsa. Free.
Move on to a tamale or two or three or seven. Hot, delicious, fresh. $1.
Order one of the tacos, or order all three. $2 each. Brisket was the favorite, but they were all good.

Classic beers on the menu, but we went with margaritas and sangria - both definitely worth getting. I'm a big fan of good sangria, so I remember having two or three while we were here. Big glasses, extremely aggressive prices.

We ate and drank for almost an hour, and the bill was no more than $15.

5979682,2016-04-28,2,IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,"I could not believe the value you get for brunch at this place. It was by far one of the best meals that we had on our LV/Sedona trip and I am a dedicated foodie.

I was very surprised when our waitress explained that out of the 12 or so items that were listed, tapas style, we could order any we wanted, as much as we wanted, for as long as we could eat!?!?!

This is the same as going to a buffet, but completely different! The dishes are not only prepared for you fresh when ordered (not sitting around like in a buffet) but the executive chef has come up with some amazing renditions that taste ridiculous. Not all are 10/10 you may have to settle for 9/10 and 8/10 but most were simply amazing.

I really felt like we were ripping the place off. Anywhere in LV else it would have easily cost 3 to 4 times for the quality, presentation, and overall experience.

Unfortunately, as I mentioned above, I am a foodie, so knowing that I may not be back, I had to try a lot of the dishes, leaving me feeling way too stuffed but super happy :)

I write this review 4 weeks later and I still remember the Benedict, the steak and eggs, the Chile relleno, and the tamale (not the traditional one), the shrimp and grits (we ordered it twice), and the super fresh ceviche. Crazy good.

WHAT A FIND! Anyone coming to LV would be nuts not to come here for a great meal (believe me I don't sing restaurant's praises very often).

My margarita was solid but not excellent. The guacamole was decent and the chips were above average but the presentation of the guacamole was lacking- like it had been slapped onto a side plate. All three salsas were excellent. My chicken poblano enchiladas were disappointing. The biggest issue was temperature as they were barely luke warm. The flavor was ok but not enough to make up for the near absence of cheese (apparently my favorite part of an enchilada). The side of plantains were excellent.
