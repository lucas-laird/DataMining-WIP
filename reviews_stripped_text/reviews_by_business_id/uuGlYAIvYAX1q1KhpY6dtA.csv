2231,2011-09-21,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Wow! I love BRAND STEAKHOUSE!! My husband and I went here for our 1st wedding anniversary. The food was absolutely perfect. The service was top notch. 
We began with the hot rocks appetizer. The steak was thin sliced and had a marinade that was full of flavor. You cook the steak to your liking and eat. Wonderful idea.. After the appetizer, I had the wedge salad. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors were consistent and well balanced. Yum. My husband had the caesar which he enjoyed.
We both had the Filet Mignon medium which was cooked to perfection. The side sauces were so good and really brought out flavors of the meat. We ordered the asparagus, the mac and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. My favorite was the mac and cheese... Seriously, I wish I had the recipe.. They were amazing!! The asparagus was not soggy which I find is the case alot of times. They had a fire roasted flavor which I enjoyed. The garlic mashed potatoes were great also.. some of the best I've had.
Overall I think that Brand Steakhouse is one of the best steakhouses that I've eaten at. It should be in the top five of Las Vegas... I will definitely go back. I dream about the Filet with their signature steak sauces and the baked Mac and Cheese. 
The atmosphere was also something to be admired. I kind of relaxed yet elegant feeling. Just perfect.",hvZ5o9YNJJ-TVCcdT42VoQ,0,0,5,eImVGLtS5Gs381Vo-JYIFg
3142,2010-02-25,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"I was looking for a Steakhouse for my bachelor party last weekend. We had a group of ten who were all on mixed budgets but I still wanted a good steak. With a group of ten guys in their mid twenties I wanted a restaurant that was more trendy and less romantic. This worked out nicely with it's ambient lighting, good music and easy going staff. 

I'm surprised of the complaints about service. We received excellent service especially considering we had a few guys who had been drinking since noon and were not the easiest to deal with. They were friendly and we received prompt service.

The food was great. The only thing to beware of is that they cook their steaks a little more on the well done side. So since I wanted a medium-rare, I ordered rare and it came out perfect for my taste. A couple guys ordered the sea bass and were very impressed. Only the two who ordered chicken were less than impressed, but who orders chicken at a steakhouse anyways. 

Make sure you get the 2 for 1 drink coupons from the girls handing them out in the casino. They were more than willing to take the coupons for our large group which knocked 100 dollars off of our total. Well worth it.",xalYrMlbmh0idu8rtNih1g,0,0,4,nDDzquWMZQyOBCsUln4hlQ

Food was just mediocre. The beef was rather tasteless and tough, and the extreme sauces couldn't even mask the poor quality. The sides were fine. The service was actually good but did not save the so-so fare. 

BTW, the building of the CityCenter monstrosity has delivered a blow to the Monte Carlo. (It is now completely disconnected from Bellagio, and the MC-Bellagio walkway and tram are bye-bye.)",MZuQLxzuGtmobRsD4YDq4w,1,0,3,YmXtnd8ah1JvFUEjo6TcMQ

46919,2008-05-27,1,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Located at the Monte Carlo Hotel, this restaurant was a pleasant surprise.  We were lucky enough to be there for it's first day of business.  Although, the dining room was fully booked, we were able to find a seat in their lounge / bar area.  While seated on the low couches, which does have a table, we ordered from the full menu. To start we chose a very nice Cab wine from Paradigm Winery that was suggested by one of our waitresses, Rose.  You will notice several wait staff always available to help you out.  Our first course was Caesar salad.  The dressing was not over done and was just enough to not get us too full.  The crouton's were an excellent addition to the salad. For our appetizer we order crab cakes.  These were fantastic!  I would not expect such fresh tasting Lump Crab Meat from a restaurant in Las Vegas. Fantastic!  For our main course we ordered the ""The Ultimate Steak""!  This porterhouse come in 40, 80 and I think 160 oz sizes.  Since it was just the two of us, we chose the 40. We also added to the steak Lobster Thermador.  Along with the steak comes two sides.   We went with the Lobster Mashed and the Asparagus. 

The presentation was fantastic.  The steak was served already cut with the Porterhouse Bone upright in the center.  The flavor was fantastic.  The cut was prime and very tender on both sides of the bones.  It was also accompanied by two sauces.  Although they were not needed, they did add an nice flavor to the steak.  The sides were also very good.  Especially the lobster thermador.  My wife, whom does not like Lobster, could not stop eating it.  The other two sides were just as spectacular. Especially the Asparagus with a fantastic sauce.. As we got down to the bottom of our 2nd bottle of the 2004 Paradigm Cab, we checked out the dessert menu. 

This menu did not do the rest of the meal justice. Good thing for the waitstaff that was able to interpret the menu.  We went with the Strawberry Baked Alaska.  It was a great dessert we would be regretted if we overlooked it..  

We both came to the conclusion there was really noting bad we could say about the meal.  The only slight issue that is worth mentioning is the temperature of the steak.  Again, it was fantastic but it was a bit on the cool side.  This was either due to the time we took consuming our crab cakes or the fact the is comes sliced to the table.  

All in all, the was one of the top 5 Steak places we have visited.  The prices were very fair and comparable to other high end steak houses. We look forward to our next trip to Vegas to enjoy this place again.",svNpB7YRUcgv7NZncSEJEA,1,0,5,0Ua5nzInMwpExIn98hVPvg

I was sharing it, and they kindly split it before bringing it to the table.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare.  The two sauces that they served with it were both kind of one toned.  I felt like I needed something acidic.  The mushrooms were also good.

I saw the table next to me order the hot rocks.  If you're not good with chipsticks, this is probably not the appetizer for you.  The stone is so hot and the slices of meat so thin that you basically only really need to put the meat on to take it off right away.",XE4F99D2jA6Fj0BWSVbRWg,1,0,3,2awCbhLjsrjRMOIYlyWvPQ

138678,2008-10-26,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"We stayed at the Monte Carlo last weekend and ate at the Brand Steakhouse on our last night there. I have to admit the primary reason we decided to eat there was the convenience. We had walked the strip during the day, our legs were tired, and we didn't want to lose our parking spot in the self parking lot.  Not to mention, we were handed 2 for 1 drink cards earlier that afternoon...which I thought we'd put to use. We decided to eat a fairly early dinner, so there weren't a lot of people dining yet when we got there. I thought we'd be seated somewhere in a dark corner because although my wife was dressed decently, I was wearing a t-shirt, shorts, and slippers.  Surprisingly we were seated right in the front, along the walkway between the restaurant and the casino. The most casual person there besides me was an older gentleman who had what appeared to be a Tommy Bahamas shirt, khakis, loafers, and a gold watch of some kind.  After being seated, we found our waiter to be very friendly and attentive. I ordered the rib eye and my wife the Chilean Sea Bass, both of which were delicious! I thought my rib eye was going to be tiny, but on the contrary...it was large. My rib eye came with two kinds of sauce on the side, but it was extremely tasty without any sauces. The only side we ordered was some kind of Lobster Mashed Potato. We had a Cesar Salad as well.  We couldn't even think about dessert after our meal, we were so stuffed. We ordered a couple of their special cocktails and they were delicious too!  Delicious...but not at the expense of the alcohol content, they were still very potent.  I recommend the drinks, ""impeared"" and ""passionfruit"".  Now for the rating reductions...the bread they bring out is presented nicely, but does taste like an ordinary dinner roll that you could buy at the supermarket.  The only thing good about the Lobster Mashed Potato was the lobster, the mashed potato was awful and not worth $9. It's amazing that a steakhouse could mess up such a standard menu item. Finally, the 2 for 1 drink card could only be used in the ""lounge"" which is the bar side of the restaurant.  The catch is that it doesn't state that on the card...apparently you're supposed to realize that because it says ""lounge"" in smaller letters under Brand Steakhouse on the card.  Our waiter told us that we could've ordered the drinks in the lounge and brought them over to our seats, but since we didn't...we couldn't use them.  I guess I could've made a big deal of it, but I opted not to because we were in Vegas spending a lot more money than we should doing everything else anyway.  Bottom line is the service was good, better to stick to the main menu items,  pass on the lobster mashed potatoes, and order your drinks in the lounge if you receive 2 for 1 drink cards.",GJWw6_nCcPqqnuW-bBOSEw,0,0,4,Ng3OVxAXw3sRb6HlKPlCyg

I'm sad to say I strongly disagree.

My husband and I came here for a rare night out while my parents watched our 2 year old daughter in our hotel room. 
We arrived around 8:30 pm, on a weeknight.  The restaurant was not busy at all, but they seated us at a tiny table even though there were plenty of open tables that would have been more comfortable.
Our server took a long while to even bring us a menu or offer drinks.  We got the drinks and our appetizers ordered without any issues. 
The buffalo wings were the highlight of our meal.  It's the one thing I can say we enjoyed.  
 I watched a server bring out our main course, see that we were still eating our salad and then go to the back of the restaurant and set our food down on a random empty table.  
A couple minutes later another server came and took away the salad I was eating before I was done.  Annoying.
She then brought our main course out again but this time put it on our table.
My steak that was supposed to be cooked medium rare - medium was very well done.
I have to wait a good 5 minutes to get the waiters attention. I tell him I'm disappointed in my steak.  He offers to have it re-made, and I say ok.  
Sadly, my husbands food was not re-made.  So we did not eat together.  In fact, I did not get to eat at all.  By the time my steak was done, so was my husband. He had eaten.  His dishes had been cleared.  
At this point a very polite manager came to our table and offered me my steak.  I had to decline however.  I was in no mood to eat alone.  I was irritated.  All excitement for the meal was lost.
To their credit our meal was compt.  They were very apologetic.  

But they are far from the best steak house on the strip.",4DrtQoV20cbDOlnOk_rxHw,0,0,2,yPgcUkvOrh2MIuQCGIpmDg

192014,2015-09-16,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Brand was a pleasant surprise. 
 
While walking through the lobby of the Monte Carlo, we were greeted by a Security Guard with a friendly, ""How are you doing this evening?""  That greeting eventually led to his suggestion of giving ""Brand"" a try.

It was much later in the evening when we walked up.  We glanced at the menu and then walked away to look at the other sit-down choices at Monte Carlo.  Brand seemed to fit our craving so we went back.

The restaurant was not very busy but there were at least 5-6 other tables that were sat and scattered around us. The hostess was nice and she welcomed us back after we checked out the other places and finally returned to get a table.  She said we made the right choice.

Our server was excellent and the rest of the staff from the runners to the bus folks did great as well.  Now to the food....

We took the recommendation of the Security Guard and ordered the Ultimate Porterhouse Steak for 2.  For sides, we got the mac & cheese and loaded baked potato.  His words were...""On my rounds, I walk through the restaurant and kitchen sometimes....everytime I go...I get hungry afterwards because it looks and smells delicious!"".

Porterhouse - cooked to perfection of medium rare. The tenderloin side was delicious and flavorful.  Although I was weary about it being pre-cut...they had let it rest properly and it was juicy and tender.  The strip side was firm as expected but it seemed to melt in my mouth like a filet. I usually avoid sauces of any type when I enjoy steak...but the 2 sauces that came with the steak were really flavorful and added a different way to enjoy the meal. 

Sides - baked potato was as good as any....oddly enough, it was so good I ate some of the skin.  The mac & cheese was good with a multi-cheese blend to add dimension of flavor.

Overall, it was a real surprise and we are fans.  In Vegas, we have been to Gordon Ramsay's Steak, Jean George's at Aria, and Coicchio's Craftsteak.  I would rate Brand equal if not better than the places mentioned.  

A great value if you are looking for that high caliber steakhouse at a reasonable price on the Vegas Strip.  We will definitely be back.",WmXouMxdpbiXen4H-PCMUg,1,0,5,Y9UG2LojanDcmhMHXRIPPw

Having worked in the business, I get it...just hope the food is good for that price point.  Ordered a Medium New York steak  and it came out well done!  Server did check back, apologized and brought out a new steak.  The second steak was rare, boy was I disappointed.  I didn't want to bring it to the servers attention again but he never checked back anyway.  I had to flag down a busboy to get our check because server never came back after our plates were bussed for a good 10-15 min.  When the check arrived (brought by a different server), I noticed an autogratuity was placed.  Never in my life have I seen an autograt for a party of 2.  Not only was I offended but felt discriminated against.  Other than bringing the well done steak to the attention of the server, there was nothing else that would lead this establishment to put an autograt for a party of two.  Seriously?!  We were not rude, actually more patient than usual given the circumstances of the night.  I did bring it to the servers attention and he stated they do that on holidays.  Ok I can live with that, if that's really their policy.

- Our party of nine were seated early on a Friday evening at our request (thank you)
- Although we were greeted promptly, our server took ages to get water and our drink orders (roughly 20min+ all told)
- After we received our drinks, he disappeared and I was forced to flag a busboy for help so we could place our appetizer order
- Shortly thereafter, a completely different server appeared and explained that our original server was busy.  This new server was helpful and attentive, and took our appetizer order.  We hoped that this new server would remain with our party, but sadly it was not to be.
- Without going into hideous detail, the remainder of the evening basically went in fits and starts (we'd get some attention from our original server, then he would disappear for a long stretch, etc.).
- Finally, and after some debate, we decided to order dessert.  While waiting for dessert to arrive, our server brought us the bill!  I've never had someone bring me the bill in advance of the meal finishing - never.  To his credit (yes, this is sarcasm), our server pointed out that the gratuity was included given our large party.  Thanks for the heads up - as if it wasn't totally obvious that you had zero incentive to even make an effort since your payout was guaranteed.
- After paying (!), we received our dessert (again, after some delay).  After we finished, another member of the staff brought us the ice cream that they had forgotten to include with one of the desserts.  Wonderful (again, sarcasm).

All told, I would rate the food at three stars, perhaps four in a few cases (the steaks were nicely cooked, the macaroni and cheese was great).  Service?  Zero stars.

More than anything, I was disappointed that our fun weekend in Las Vegas started on such a dismal note.  My brother and I were hoping to treat our friends to a nice dinner out to kick things off, and this experience was deflating.

My girlfriends and I were in Vegas this past weekend (memorial 2009) and we were looking for a good steak. What we got was incredibly disappointing. 

From the service to the food the whole meal was a nightmare. Our waitress could not keep a single order straight and when she delivered our drinks (each one to the wrong person I might add) she said, and I quote, ""this is what we do when one gets the wrong drink"" and she slide my drink from in front of my friend across the table to me. And that was just the beginning. I heard every excuse in the book from the runners being new to them being super busy... there were maybe 4 other parties in the whole restaurant. 

The food was sub par at best. I order the 9oz. Filet Mignon and what I got was a fatty piece of beef that I could not identify. In addition, the potato pancakes were a greasy gooey mess dripping with oil... YUCK!!

Our waiter was top notch.  He knew all of the specials, had recommendations and gave us time for a nice slow birthday dinner.  He was well worth the gigantic tip we left him.

We also ordered the fried Calamari, which came with two delicious sauces that I couldn't get enough of.  I ordered the NY Sirloin and was not disappointed.  It was absolutely the most delicious, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat that I've ever had.  I didn't even try the sauces because my meat was so delicious.

We also got the lobster mashed potatoes, which were incredibly unique with delicious lobster chunks in them, and the wild mushrooms, which were buttery and very well seasoned.  

It was one of the best meals of my life, so good that it prompted me to open a yelp account and write about my fantastic birthday experience there.

He was trying to impress me so he told me about how he gets comps and first class services with his blue card or whatever. Anyway, screw him. The hostess was gorgeous. Blonde & super friendly. Our table wasn't ready yet so we sat at the bar and enjoyed Happy Hour. 

The bar had like 6 people. Bartender was a smart-a$$ and thought he was the shit. Took him forever to serve us while he leaned on the cash register typing forever! Wasn't hot or anything but what a sweaty son of a bitch! Took him a while to give us a menu. Didn't like his attitude.

The 2nd guy was hella cool. He was funny, attentive to our drinks, water glasses and food. He made me a great drink with Chili's. Brought the bread out for us and even offered us passes for the Dance lounge later on. Cute guy with an accent & beautiful smile. His jokes were hilarious. Wish I took him home instead of my ex. Close...

The hot rocks and Carpaccio (sp) were amazing. We saved some room and after Happy Hour was over, we sat down for our dinner. I think at 7, the blonde turned into a Brunette. She's the one who walked us to our table. Super nice. Gave us menu's and chit-chatted for a while.

He enjoyed the steak with the big bone.  Had he offered me a bite of it, I would write a review. But he didn't. The salmon was tasty, had a bed of a salad that was so well seasoned & sauced. Our server was very wine knowledgeable and after one bottle, we tried the cucumber martini. Their Martinis are the best. Wish I had the recipes.

Manager was nice. Came over and said hi, cleared a few plates and was actually the one who opened the wine. Not sure if he has a twin but his presence was surely felt all the time. Banana smores were amazing and after all this, we stumbled to the exit.

I think he paid $20 for my all u can drink and our friends joined us later as we danced through the night. More Morphing. The asshole bartender dude had turned into a gorgeous chic bartender. Funny guy was still there working his ass off. Both served fast. DJ Finea$$ or something had me dancing all night. We sat at a reserved table and they were nice about it.

I would definitely go back there, this time ALONE or with a group of girlfriends. Don't feel so bad about my short dress pulling up coz that one waitress ass was out every time she bent over.",K_FKo_NUXF0gQQuHyy5zgw,1,1,4,sUSpfFd0w6hu2RL3D5PvKA

With reservations for 700pm and high reviews from yelp and other sources, we ended up sitting at a 2 person table very reminiscent of Bob Evans, rendering the  'romantic' ambience instantly negated.  Followed up with Techno music playing as loud as any Rave. It contrasted starkly with the rock music and gaming that filtered directly in from the casino floor.   It seemed it was meant to drowned out the casino sounds. 
The food. Let me start by saying the waiter offered drinks. I had a beer, my wife declined any alcohol. He failed to offer her any non-alcoholic beverages. She drank water.  The steak carpaccio was sinewy, fairly tasteless, and nearly impossible to pick up with a fork.  My guess was it was cut frozen, placed on a warm plate and then refrigerated. 
We had the '40 oz' steak for 2. We had more than enough steak for 2 ; but it was more like a 24 or 28 oz cut.   Asparagus was on the menu but the only had broccolini ( baby broccoli spears).  Not fans.  
We voiced our concerns with the waiter who was more offended than interested in corrective measures.  
Definitely somewhere we would NOT recommend OR return to.

Hostesses and wait staff were all personable and professional.  We were met, greeted and escorted to our table promptly.  Friendly but not overly so.  Efforts are made to employ good looking people and the female staff should please the lads and dads.  Service was polished and prompt.

We both enjoyed the steak very much--""himself"" got the filet mignon and I tried the Flank (or whatever it is called that is flatish).  His was so tender you could eat with a fork--mine which is a more robust/flavorful cut arrived sliced, and was very good,too.  They came with 2 sauces --worchestershire and black peppercorn--served on the side.  Neither cut of meat really needed any enhancement.  We both ate every bit.

We tried scalloped potatoes and asparagus.  Note:  sides are not huge as in some steak houses--if you are a hearty eater you may need 2 all for yourself!  Dessert was the bananas foster bread pudding with ice cream which was ""deconstructed""  (i.e. do-it-yourself with brioche type bread pudding accompanied by sliced bananas and syrup),  and it was just to die for.  Big portion which --in all honesty--was so good I would eat the entire thing myself next time -calories be damned.

The room is dark wood, modern with emphasis and mood created by light and dramatic (spare) asian-style floral arrangments.   Good for a business party or for a date.  The room is open to the casino.  We sat further into the room--which would be my choice in the future,too--bit more private and intimate, and far from the noise of the casino.

Diners were a diverse group.  This was Memorial Weekend Monday. Moms and Dads from mid-America, newly-weds and younger hip people.  It was not terribly busy.

We didn't spend time in the bar--it looked inviting.

I would eat there again.  Note: the day after we had dinner--I saw special deals for dinner for 2--which would have represented quite a bargain--makes me wonder if the place is still trying to establish itself--hope it does.",iHbrtxeY2Vp715WrcvnVDw,1,0,4,qoObp6pQoK4q2EqWp8JByQ

I'd say the only drawback to this restaurant is that it's located within the casino, and it's all open to the casino floor. It's by the table games rather than slot machine, so at least noise and lights aren't super distracting or anything. Some previous reviewers mentioned that the cigarette smoke from the casino drifts into the restaurant, but we didn't notice that too badly. There are tables located right at the edge of the casino, which would be good for people-watching if you're into that, or you could request a seat further back in the restaurant in order to feel like you're a little more removed.

That would be the most important part of a steakhouse experience, and the one I received was completely underwhelming. The service was good and quick, and the restaurant was clean and very nice. 

The Kobe beef tartare appetizer was good, not as good as the one at Ramsays ""steak"" restaurant though. 

My girlfriend had the wild mushroom ravioli and it was an excellent dish, absolutely delicious. I wish I had ordered that instead of my steak. 

The steak I ordered was the dry aged New York. I ordered medium rare and received something that was cooked past medium but I was too hungry to wait for a replacement as offered by the waiter. It wouldn't have mattered much, as it was a flavorless and stringy cut of meat, with the dry aged flavor only coming through in the last bits around the bone.

It is definitely a trendy steakhouse with a good size bar area to sit at, but it is right off the casino floor which might bug some.

880605,2010-09-07,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"After a day of swimming and walking around, we decided that a late dinner would be in order after a very late lunch.

We wandered down to Brand Steakhouse around 8:30pm and opted to sit in the lounge section of the restaurant.  

It was a Wednesday night and the lounge only had a few tables when we got there.   

As we were looking though the menus I noticed that a few more tables had come in and that there was a single server on in the lounge.  I didn't think much of it then.

We ordered a couple of mojitos.  Great, well balanced and well mixed.

We then ordered the New York Sirloin, with the Asparagus(with Truffle Fondue Sce), Baked Mac and Cheese, and the smokey mashed potatoes.

Now this is where the single server in the lounge becomes a bit of an issue.  Within 15 minutes I see our food go by and taken to a table beside the bar.  I assume that it was brought there so our server could bring it to us.  I mentioned this to my wife and she said, it must have been taken there as we did not have our Cutlery yet.  So 5 minutes passes and our server comes running over with our napkin wrapped  cutlery, followed immediately by our food.  The server looked very worried.

Now our food wasn't cold, but it wasn't 'right off the grill' hot either.  Did this hurt the taste..mmm maybe.  But the food was still outstanding.  IF we would have gotten our food right out of the kitchen, I may have given this meal 5 stars.

I chalk this up a small staffing issue.  And that happens.  

I fully recommend this restaurant and will give it another chance to earn the 5 stars that I think it is capable of.",zLcvwYULq9rXWbsSTH06gQ,0,0,4,5tOco0M8NseVO1JIaDqtKA

I was walking with my group from Diablo Cantina to The Bellagio, and one of their many promoters on the street convinced us to go to Brand. I have stayed at the Monte Carlo before, and I did not even know they had a lounge. Anyways, he confirmed with us it would be $20 bucks each. He even walked us to the line. We saw that the line was a little long, but he assured us it would only be about a five minute wait. After a while in line I noticed that the only reason it was getting shorter, was because people were leaving the front of the line. Someone from the back of the line yelled at the hostess monitoring the line and told her that they were spewing lies, but some how we did not connect the dots. When we got through the rope, the girl working the line told us it would be $30 each. We confronted her and told her the name of the promoter that told us it would be $20. She did not even consider this, and goes on and on about how it was technically Saturday night, and now we had to pay the ""weekend"" price. Naturally, we left.

Our server was great and professional. Maybe a little bit of ""shtick"" when he talked to us but I enjoyed him.

Possibly the best bite of steak I have ever had. Our sides were a loaded baked potato, mac and cheese (really good) and asparagus. We added a side of shrimp and crab which were $20 bucks a pop. These were the only let down. 4 shrimp and not too much crab. Oh well, seafood is expensive for what you get so what can you do.

1042058,2012-05-30,1,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"So because we were staying at Monte Carlo, for our Anniversary dinner, we decided to try out this restaurant. I searched on Yelp for a nice restaurant, and this one happened to come up as closest (obviously, since it was inside Monte Carlo) with 3 money signs. Plus it said it was romantic. 

So we made reservations and headed on down there. First of all, the hostess was not friendly. She asked for my last name and when I told her, she replied ""what??"" instead of ""excuse me"" or something similar.. And then when she located my reservation, she said ""ah"" with no further instructions. And as I looked around, she finally said that another hostess was coming up to escort us to our table. (awkward of her to make us momentarily confused).

Then we get to the table.. The restaurant is literally right next to the tables at the casino so it's pretty loud.. (specially when some Las Vegas Virgin is overhyped and keeps yelling VEEEGAAAAAASSSS every time he wins a hand.. Uff) So it's not quite romantic.. 

Then the service was ok.. I felt rushed by the server. He seemed rushed as well too. We ordered the calamari, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the Chilean sea bass.

Calamari - was amazing. Probably the best calamari I've had in a long while. They were fried to perfection

Filet mignon - was amazing as well and I don't even like steak! HOWEVER, the steak came with NOTHING. It as just 2 bits of steak on a plate plus 2 different sauces and that was it. Um!? Usually, at a steakhouse, steak is served with at least a side of veggies or fries.. or SOMETHING. NO. Here, it came with nada! WHY!? Idk. But fine, if the steak comes with no sides, I would expect the server to inform us ""the steak does not come with any sides. Would you like to order any sides such as fries, baked potatoes, or etc?"" But no. He didn't say anything. 

Chilean Sea Bass - was amazing. It came with lemon risotto. Cooked to perfection. I finished the entire plate way too quick!! Excellent. 

We didn't order any dessert here so I can't comment on that. 

All in all for the above items plus a beer and a glass of wine, the total came up $130 + tip. For that price, I wish the server was more attentive to us and MAYBE told us about the sides situation for the steaks. ""/ Also, as mentioned above it was pretty loud.. Not a good place if you want a quiet dinner with conversations. Also, the wait time between taking the order.. and getting our appetizer.. and then finally getting our entrees was quite long...

Seating on the casino floor with really loud music inside the restaurant.  So loud we asked if they could turn it down so we could talk without yelling.

Booth seating upholstery was torn open and had cigarette burns on it.  Not the atmosphere if you want to have a great dinner with your friends, especially when you have so many better options.

My steak was overcooked and tough especially when ordered med rare and gnocchi my wife had was sauce less.  This just isn't up to the level you expect for a $50+ steak and overall meal.  I explained to the waiter who was trying to do his best and he comped our deserts.  Unfortunately the cheesecake tasted like it was right out of the freezer section so that didn't help matters.

The exception to the ground beef rule - the veal cheek slider !

hit Brand last night - part of the Light group restaurant chain ( fix. stack, etc ) similar to those places - they put twists on old favs, but the bottom line, this place is a steakhouse.  my focus the sliders, but real quick - the other dishes ( brought the gf on this trip  and we ordered WAY TOO MUCH )  - the veal porterhouse - not good - very little quality meat on the bone !!  the mushrooms, mac and cheese and lobster mashed - the mushrooms ( 3 sides cost $24 )  get the nod ! the lobster bisque with what i believe was a bacon/goat cheese grilled sammie ( $11) - 2 lil chunks of lobster and a whole-lotta cream in that bisque.  the sammie was tasty !! and what appear to be a trend - the drinks - some pineapple thingy with bitters - there can't be more than 4 ounces of liquid - $11 - yeah, whatever !

now the sliders - it came with a generous portion of tasty fries.  2 veal cheek sliders with a bbq style sauce - a little too much sauce - but the veal cheek ?  i liked it.  very tender, nice flavor - i believe it cost $17 .  the total bill $130.

also a side note - decor - not as ""creative"" as their other restaurants - the gf liked the flower arrangement , whatever !  no dessert - hit the craps table afterward - everyone at the table wanted the leftovers - hit the hard 10 3 times  made over $300 - got the hell out of Dodge !",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,1,1,3,pr6OO5SZVJrPmtffR_eQZw

When the Onion Soup came, it looked pretty glorious.  Super thick layer of cheese!  Whatever the 4 types of cheeses are, it tasted awesome.  Not much in terms of the ""croutons"" but I like it that way.  The soup itself is intensely rich, and they say they caramelize the onions for 24 hours and hell, I believe them.  The only thing was that it was very salty.  That might turn some people away, but it didn't bother me too much.

The steak was a perfect medium rare to medium.  Very nice seasoned crust too.  I think the best part about the steak was the sauces that it came with.  Loved the red wine worcestershire sauce.  It's like the grown up version of your A1!  The peppercorn sauce has a nice touch too, but definitely went with the red wine worcestershire much more often.

The Penne Pasta looked really simple but it is one of the better pasta dishes I've had in Vegas.  Came  prosciutto, peas, and truffle sprinkles in a rich parmesan cream sauce.  Not much in terms of quantity for the truffle, but just the sprinkles are enough.  Pasta's also cooked to a perfect al dente!

Service-wise, our main server was great.  However, the other wait-staff looked like they are PO all the time haha.

We frequent Morton's, Ruth Chris, Lawry's, Providence, London, Melisse... and many other michelin starred restaurants for a piece of good meat. However, I must say Brand's Tomahawk steak is our fav!!  Every time when we visit Vegas, this is a must have. 

When we are here, we always order the Tomahawk steak, their Cesar salad, and their mac & cheese side. Those are the must haves. 

Their caesar salad is made the proper way and the taste is superb... Perfectly balanced caesar salad. In some places, the dressing tastes too creamy or has a sour note... But not in this place. Each lettuce is individually seasoned to perfection. I'll try to add a few pictures of these dishes with this review so you'd know what I'm talking about.  

Their Mac & cheese is the best Mac & cheese I've ever had!!  My husband doesn't even like cheese but he can finish the Mac & cheese here by himself. The flavor is great and I love that they make the Mac & cheese with a crispy top.  It's delicious. 

The Tomahawk steak is juicy, tender, with just the right amount of fat. It comes with two sauces - a horseradish and a red wine sauce. These sauces complement the steak very well. They make eating the steak fun and interesting.  As I indicated, this is our favorite restaurant for my husband and I for steak. 

We occasionally ordered their French onion  soup which is not bad.  Their lobster bisque and colossal shrimps are only ok. 

Oh and don't forget to ask for their bread .... It's delicious and buttery but they don't give it to you if you don't ask for it.

I was pleasantly surprised when we reviewed the menu; a steakhouse in Vegas that isn't trying wring your pocketbook dry!  I thought $39 for the filet mignon was completely reasonable.  

PROS:
* Impeccable service
* Fantastic decor - hip but elegant... go figure
* Steak done P-E-R-F-E-C-T-L-Y.  I always order blue rare and very few places will serve my steak this way.  Slightly cool in the middle - melted in my mouth.  Delectable!
* Mouth-watering sides.  Their mac n' cheese was so amazingly creamy and delicious... I miss it still.
* Decent portion sizes for a steak house!  Left feeling full and although we finished every bite of the food we ordered, we weren't left wanting more.

CONS:
* Ask for a table away from the casino floor if you're looking to hold a conversation.
* It was over too soon!  :)

They have an option where you can purchase 3 sides for $28 dollars, but neglect to list the price of sides solo. They are $9 each we found out although we ordered 3 sides. (the deal makes no sense mathmatically). I inquired if they were large enough to share and she said they weren't. That's odd b/c the cast iron pan of Mac and Chz could easily serve three people. Also, if you bring in your own cake its a $4 chg per person, which they waived. And they auto-grat parties of 6 or more.

I wandered in here because of their $3 cocktails and $9 apps sign and sat at the bar for a few hours. My bartender's name was Gustavo - he was fun, personable, charming and attentive. Normally I feel a bit off downing drinks by myself at a bar, nonetheless at a steakhouse (albeit a small one in a casino, lol) he made me feel right at home.

The restaurant manager needed a charger for his iPhone and his employees didn't have one, but I did so I got free drinks after happy hour...for a few hours and this was great.

The following day I went back with a few friends and we had the hot rock appetizer (pieces of nicely seasoned and very thinly cut pieces of raw beef sirloin and grill  it yourself with VERY hot rocks in a bamboo steamer like thing) - I LOVED it and thought it was delicious but those with me weren't crazy about it...granted I do agree with them that it would have been tastier had the sirloin pieces been thicker, at $9 I wasn't expecting the stars - when it's NOT happy hour the hot rocks are $17 - THEN I would have been really disappointed, but for $9 I was pleased.

I also had their beef sliders (Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, louis sauce, fries) they were pretty juicy, small and the 'louis sauce' (whatever it was) was quite good. My friends also ordered the crispy calamari and the Finger Licking Lollipop Wings (Signature sauce, blue cheese, carrot sticks). The calamari was ok, nothing to write home about and I didn't sample the wings because I don't do spicy...

My 4 star rating is really because Gustavo was super cool, I liked the ambience, great happy hour specials, people were friendly (staff and clientele alike!) and the location was convenient to my hotel and to getting our night started. If I come back to Vegas (which honestly, I'm not clamoring to do anytime soon - I mean I'm from NYC ;-D) I'd definitely make a point of stopping back here :).",wQ0lKC5BMg3ZvCco8FI1EQ,8,7,4,2Tu4kjgPjMINtjNCPOBhug

We have been going there for years, I would think its for a reason. 
This time... The sauces were totally off- the sauces are one of the main reasons we go to Brand! 
They were a liquid, watery, basically gravy and wine or chicken stock w/out salt. 
Interestingly enough the waiter asked the chef about it and he apparently said he had done them the same way he always does and the manager said the chef hasnt changed in a while. They refused to accept the sauces were destroyed. They have also taken out the butter from serving on top of the steak. 
Not returning - the star is for the onion soup and the bread ( and perhaps a bit to the free dessert offer we didnt take) 
Very disappointed
Not to mention the young lady that served as ""host"" was extremely flirtatious and almost a bit disrespectful - not classy at all :(",0JzIDpRUdnc_qgo5MEy5rA,3,0,1,CAGjUC-fhADALhASLi7A3w
1556963,2009-02-17,5,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Brand was definitely one of the redeeming factors of staying at the Monte Carlo with a group on a strict budget -- good food was actually right there under our noses. Ballers for only a night just two friends and I dined here our last night to cap off our vacation in style. It was about time, too, because I had enough of McDonalds and Rubios from the Monte Carlo food court.

We strolled down to the lobby and got a table with ease from the foxy hostesses around 7pm. Brand is both a steakhouse and adjoining small lounge, with the steakhouse dining room separated from the casino floor by only a waist-high counter. I was already numb to the casino funk, so it didn't bother me at all. We were seated right along the counter, a prime location for people watching.

Steak, steak, steak, and more beautiful steak. I love steak and I might go ahead and say my 8oz filet mignon was probably in the top 20 best steaks I've ever had. They have all kinds of cuts, with or without the bone, and tons of sides to boot. Not quite the selection of beef at Alfred's in San Francisco, but pretty good.

The dinner special for two seemed like a good idea, but sadly, by the day after Valentine's Day they were out of it. My two companions split a hefty bone-in porterhouse and added on three sides ($9 a piece or 3 for $23).

For appetizers, we collectively split two cesar salads, kobe carpaccio, tuna tartare and a jumbo shrimp cocktaill. The cesar was good with whole pieces of romaine with homemade herb croutons. The kobe carpaccio was thin and buttery with capers, shaved parmesan reggiano and a delightfully bitter frisée thinly dressed in what tasted like a nice peppery balsamic, with a few slices of subpar brioche toast. The tuna tartare was mixed with crisp jicama and it came with brioche toast and a bed of watercress. So far, so good.

My filet mignon was medium and had a proportionately flavorful seasoned exterior. Their porterhouse came with a bone about the size of my forearm and two sauces. Steaks come a la carte, so be sure to order something to go alongside. For $25 you can add on lobster to your steak, but it isn't a lobster tail! It's like a lobster in a thick cheesy, buttery gravy sauce. Still good, still plump, it just took us by surprise. For sides we opted for the asparagus, mushrooms and the hashbrowns. The asparagus was my fave, perfectly tender with a white dipping sauce. The mushrooms were earthy and good and the hashbrowns looked like little triangle-cut club sandwiches with bacon in the center with sour cream on the side; I didn't get to eat one because I was so full, but they made for great leftovers.

Brand isn't obscenely opulent nor expensive like many restaurants in Vegas. I felt it was a great value for the money, the staff was professional and attentive and it was easy to walk in without a reservation. In addition to the two steaks, lobster, three sides, three appetizers, two salads, we had one non-alcoholic beverage, two cocktails and one glass of wine, and our bill was $240. With tip, we spent $100 per person and left stuffed.

Now, they do have one special I would like to see someone order... Brand has a 120oz steak, meant to feed six people, for $267. If one person can finish it by themselves, it's on the house! AMAZING!",4pzr6KuS85859EICMI7MDw,10,9,4,_mxv7otOg46Ql3vDMibHHA

My man and I decided against getting  any appetizers, and went ahead and ordered our entrees. I ordered the bone out filet minon, and he ordered the veal porterhouse. The steaks were quite tender, but the sauces severly lacked in flavor. We chose the three sides for $24. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes were the highlight of the meal, very rich and creamy and very buttery. The Asparagus with 'truffle' fondue sauce was watery and bland. The sauteed wild mushrooms were okay, but leaned towards the oily side.  For desert, we ordered the Bananas Foster's Bread Pudding. The bread pudding was nothing great either, I was so dissappointed. It literally tasted like straight up mushy bread. 

Aside from the food, the service was A+. Maybe the chefs had an off-nite, or maybe we didn't order the right things.. either way, we probably won't be back.",pCpWHjAiEf6ptK_W6Qb2jw,1,0,3,4HJVSHqKsoZVajwR59bQSg

It didn't start off so well - we ordered the Seafood Platter which was very lackluster. At $35 I thought it would be more impressive. It came with exactly 3 tiny oysters, 3 large shrimp, and some lobster. I wouldn't recommend ordering that but the restaurant certainly redeemed itself later in the meal.

For my entree I ordered a duck special that was so delicious and cooked to perfection. It was a TON of food - I only ate about half of it and I love duck and it was delicious but it was an extremely generous serving - especially for the price - which I believe was around $35. We also had a side of asparagus (huge spears, very lightly cooked) but what really stole the show was the gnocchi side. OH. MY. GOODNESS. These suckers will knock the most stringent of dieters off the wagon and it will be worth every single calorie. They were divine. They were cooked with brown sugar and sage and were firmer than other gnocchi dishes I've had in the past and even had a bit of crispness on some of the edges that may not sound good but it worked beautifully. 

Our server was top notch. He was very friendly and helpful and went above and beyond for us. I wish I could remember his name but he was great. My only gripe was that for such a nice restaurant they sat us overlooking the casino floor instead of back inside of the restaurant (where we sat last time and which looked mostly empty this time) and I felt like it kind of cheapened the experience a little.  I'd definitely request to be seated further in the restaurant next time if you can - unless you like watching slot machines and such during your fine dining experience...",yTOkWNX5uOet0YxohhsWFg,1,1,4,teHI7wnxNseCJX78bY1TKw

All I can say was damn best steak I've ever had and my gf agreed. I have been to other high end steak houses like mastros, Morton's, and blt and they were easily beaten by brand. Keep in mind that this place according to the waitress only serves USDA choice meat compared to the superior USDA prime, but I guess there cooking style is superior. The next morning I ate the leftovers cold and damn it was still good I was eating off that bone like a dog 5/5 for my leftovers.

2nd time me and my gf brought my bro and his gf. We got the 80oz for 4. And we were not disappointed. My bro also said one of the best steaks he's ever had. For me and my girl it's the best steak we've ever had, and we are going back in 2 weeks:)

Went again for the 3rd and 4th time. The porterhouse for 2 is no longer the same did not have that buttery taste. it looks like the chef cuts the porterhouse thicker now which I do not like.

We were pleasantly and promptly greeted by the staff and our server was very attentive and made us feel very welcome.

To start we ordered the Passion Fruit Cocktail. It was a good drink, but wasn't as sweet as I thought. None the less, great. For our appetizer we had the Hot Rocks. Basically they bring out an immensely hot rock in a wicker basket type thing and a plate of raw beef. The beef was marinated in what seemed to be their homemade Worcestershire Sauce and was peppered as well. What we then had to do was cook the beef on the rock. Soo much fun! My only complaint is that for $14, they gave us 6 thinly sliced squares of meat, so $7 for 3 pieces each. If they brought out at least 12 pieces it would be well worth it and wouldn't make you feel like you ate too much, as with 3 pieces each, it only made our empty stomachs feel empty.

We ordered the Filet Mignon and the Veal. The filet was amazing, but the veal wasn't as tender as I thought. I've never had veal before, but everyone tells me it is sooo tender since it is a young cow that I would love it. The filet was more tender than the veal.

Remember that one scene in the first Matrix where Cypher was doing his dirty deal with the Agent and he was eating the steak? That kind of reaction but from the steak not the thought of betraying all your friends to get plugged back into a battery.

From start to finish the entire dining experience at Brand has been nothing but super amazing. Gustav knows his cocktails and he will sell you on the menu. He doesn't just know the menu he believes in it as well as can recommend wild and crazy hacks on certain dishes to improve the dish. When the steaks came off Gustav grabbed another plate and poured the two offered sauces on to the plate so we can try it and in the middle was a mix of both sauces. Didnt even cross my mind to mix the two sauces but man it was a great idea.

An amazing place. Highly recommended and locals get 20% off. So what are you waiting for? GO NOW!",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,4,4,5,XI0LaAnSEKChcoP8WOOtzQ

I was a little hesitant, knowing it was located on the casino floor, but we were sitting in a table closest to the casino floor and didn't have any problems with smoke or noise. Entrees start at around $30, and steaks seem to hover at around the $50 mark, with sides unincluded and costing an additional $10 on average. I was with a really large group, and the service was excellent (seriously one of the best service experiences I have had in Vegas), and everyone really enjoyed their food (I think we were all pretty much split between steak and seafood, and it was all delicious). Everything seemed to be cooked to perfection and very flavorful. We were there for a celebration and had coordinated with the concierge to have a cake delivered to the table, and the staff was very good with the cutting and delivering of cake in addition to the great service they provided during the meal.

I had the 8 oz filet and it was perfect medium rare. Hubby had the NY Strip and that was perfect too. Sides were OK, mashed potato and roasted veg.

The Medium Rare steak was served sliced off the bone, yet it had obviously been allowed to rest before slicing. It was so juicy! The Mac and Cheese was actually a homemade Shells and Cheese with a crunchy topping that will blow your mind. SO GOOD!

MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR THE BREAD AND BUTTER - IT IS ONLY GIVEN WHEN REQUESTED! It's delicious, you won't want to miss this.

Steak: 
Our group of 6 ordered the Ultimate Steak Platter (ordered medium rare) which is 120oz of steak for $250 (breaks down to about $40 per person which is a phenomenal deal). It was out of this world delicious. The steak is cut into slices making it easy for everyone to dig in and share. Every piece was so delicate, juicy, creamy, so mouth wateringly good, that it rates as one of the top 3 steaks I've had anywhere, ever.

Side Orders:
Mac & Cheese - It was pretty good. It was baked with a nice crust on the top, very decadent, with a good amount of creaminess from the cheese. I'd order it again.

Cream Spinach - Meh. It wasn't that great, but it wasn't bad. I'd probably order something different.

Dessert:
Cheesecake - Top 3 best cheesecakes I've ever had. I'm a man with a sweet tooth for pastries and I'm telling you, without a doubt, if you miss this, you'll regret it. It's one of the richest cakes I've ever had. Make sure you split it with someone, 1 slice is too much for any one person to handle.

Smores - Not very good. I could make it better myself at home. The grilled banana is a nice touch but it doesn't save this dessert.

Strawberry Backed Alaska - It was good but a little heavy on the whipped topping for me. The ice cream was good but it was an overall average dessert.

I paid a total of $70-$80 and I was stuffed to the brim with great food and great dessert. You can't go wrong here.",SJO7TOFKsAtRG9v7vXpB6Q,2,0,5,zNyZreOFQ3bXSz9YoRM6BA

For some reason when my friends and I go to Vegas, we always get something for free at a dining place...last time it was Bouchon, this time it was Brand Steakhouse.

We were really disappointed because our friends come here all the time and swears on their rib-eye. We say okay and the restaurant apologizes and promises to send us free dessert.

Next, my friends who order a porterhouse medium rare and a medium get it both well done. Disappointed, they asked the waiter if they could get another steak, and the restaurant happily comps them 3 free steaks for the mistake (and the previous mistake of not having enough rib-eyes for our group).

The steaks itself and the sides (macaroni, spinach, etc.) were all good but not comparable to Mastro's. I was happy that the restaurant honors itself of being a fine dining restaurant by comping us with free dessert (enough to feed a group of 10+ with barely any leftovers) and comping us 3 free steaks.

The next night, we took full advantage of the Yelp Spring break prix fixe. I started with the hot rocks. It's a cool gimmick that makes people want interactive dining. Basically a huge blazing hot rock comes in a bamboo steamer, along with some thinly sirloin steak marinated. It wasn't too special, but when it arrives, everyone looks and watches. For the entree, I ordered the Chilean sea bass. The fish was a generous portion, seared atop of a lemon risotto with shrimp and lobster broth. The fish was cooked spot on, but the risotto could have  been cooked a little longer. Last came the strawberry baked Alaska. The extremely tart strawberry syrup on the bottom of the plate threw the taste off and the short bread tasted a little stale.

It was cooked to perfection, juicy, tender and tasty. This place for sure knows how to cook one hellva steak to make any mouth water and savor it. The whole meal was more than enough for two very hungry people. 

Sides: baked mac and cheese- creamy, nice crust on top, steaming hot and so cheesy and the cream spinach. Cream spinach was good but nothing spectacular yet it was gone by the time we finished our meal.

We split a bone in ribeye... Man what a bone!  I could grab it with my whole hand and just take a bite out of the steak if I wanted. (Secretly wanted to). It was cooked perfectly on the inside. Extra charred on the outside.  If this is your thing, I would recommend it.  However it isn't my thing.  I felt like it countered the fact that I wanted my one cooked medium.

The sides were smaller than I am used to.  I did think this was great because we can get more variety and still finish our food.  Mac n cheese, mashed potato, and green beans. Enough for the 3 of us to share. All really great. Mac n cheese was the best out of the 3.

2267522,2012-12-09,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"I tried Brand for the first time this weekend. I was there with my significant other's parents and we were just looking for a nice sit down meal. 
The seating arrangement is comfortable enough. The tables are not too cramped and there is space to get in and out without smashing into the person sitting behind you. It seems to be a trend to build casino restaurants that are open to the casino floor. I find this very disturbing to the social nature of eating a meal with other people and to the enjoyment of the meal itself. Brand is directly across from the table games and the sounds and blaring music from the casino make it nearly impossible to carry on any sort of intelligent conversation. This is more a critique of casino restaurant design in general than Brand itself.
We ordered the steak for 4. They cook it to order but this can cause problems if some people like it rare and others like it well done--you only get one choice. We ordered the steak medium but it came rare. Not a problem for most of us but one in our party was disappointed and searched for the more well done end pieces. The steak itself was fantastic. Very tender with a nice bark. I don't usually eat steak in large quantities but this was so good I ate way more than I should have. The dipping sauces were OK but completely unnecessary. The steak didn't need any kind of sauce.
Be forewarned that the steak for 4 is easily enough for 8 normal people. We all left stuffed and we still had plenty left over for 3 more meals. 
The steak for 4 came with 2 sides. We ordered the mashed potatoes and grilled mushrooms. They were both good sides and the portion size was just right for everyone to have an ample serving. 
For dessert we got the banana s'more. This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. The banana was served in the peel with roasted marshmallows on top and 3 different toppings. It was very underwhelming as are most restaurant desserts. 
The service left much to be desired. We were largely ignored and we waited as long as 15 minutes between seating and order taking. We had to flag our server down to ask for anything including the check. They seemed understaffed which is odd for a weekend when there was both a big fight and NFR in town. 
Overall I enjoyed my visit to Brand and I'd recommend trying it out. It is expensive but that's to be expected at a casino steakhouse. If you're entertaining visitors or just want to splurge Brand is nice night out.",_zoR3pxRFp98bGYoNhH46g,0,0,4,sf3h2snuSvH0HmN4BZUozA

2288223,2013-12-19,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"I must admit, I was VERY excited to try this restaurant after reading all of the great reviews and seeing the pictures of the food.  When we arrived, we were early, so the hostess suggested that we sit at the bar until our table was ready.  We sat in the lounge area and ordered drinks.  Shortly after, our table was ready, so we asked the hostess to tell the bartender/server that we had been shown to our table and to please bring the drinks when they were ready.  After being shown to our table, we waited for about 15 minutes before the bartender brought our drinks and said she had been looking for us since she had no idea where we had gone.  Turns out, the hostess never passed our message along.  Very poor communication in a restaurant that should pride itself on great food AND service.  Moving on, it took some time for our waiter to finally address us, but when he did, he was very nice.  I had already decided that I was going to get their Seabass, and my mom was going to order the Filet Mignon.  When we go to order, our waiter informs us that they're out of BOTH of our selections.  Wait, so this is a steakhouse, and you're out of the Filet Mignon at 8pm????  And the Seabass???  Very very disappointing, but what can we do at this point?  So, we order and ask for some of their bread, which looked so delicious from the pictures that other Yelpers had posted.  He brings us out two orders because, guess what, they're about to run out and he wants to make sure we have enough.  Very sweet and thoughtful gesture, but you're going to run out of BREAD?  What is going on here?  My mom and husband shared the 40 oz. Ultimate Steak, which I thought was a good value.  But, the steak wasn't very impressive.  I got the Salmon, and didn't even finish half because it was just....eh.  And, the waiter had no idea how I felt about the meal because he didn't check on us.  The favorite part of the meal were the sides of the Mashed Potatoes (YUM!), Macaroni & Cheese, and our drinks, which were very creative and tasty.  Service was just okay...it took a while to have plates cleared and we were never checked on, despite the fact that there were multiple managers walking around who passed our table plenty of times.  I understand that running out of food wasn't our waiters fault, but then he didn't even offer a complimentary dessert or anything, which again, just seemed a bit odd for a nice restaurant.  Having been so excited to dine here, I was very disappointed when we left.  My family always lets me pick restaurants because I love yelping and reading other reviews, but this time, I was completely let down.  Maybe it was an off night, but unfortunately, I'll never return (and, we go to Vegas quite often...actually going in 5 more days).",0gfckXjayNp0_O9jP8RAbg,2,0,2,CtkEZkVgfWx_Vrn7aVJMRA
2290429,2013-09-21,2,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Had a fun third meal here because of great company and conversation. The 10 of us enjoyed the locals' discount (20%) and half-off bottles of wine which reduces the 300-350% wine menu markup to a more local-friendly 70% :)

Had six Beausoleil oysters ($4 each), albeit on the smaller side (RM Seafood attracts larger specimens). I had a Ritz-cracker-crab-stuffed Lobster Tail ($25) add-on to my steak entree which I definitely wouldn't order again. It was a small tail, from a 1lb-ish lobster, and I found the stuffing too sweet, too pasty, and lacking any visible crab. The tail is one of those $5 tails you see at the fishmarket, so it isn't a screaming value. The creamed Spinach is still tasty as usual.

Be warned that the 24oz. Tomahawk bone-in Ribeye is easily 12oz. of bone. The bone was enormous, almost a foot-and-a-half long. If you're planning on sharing this steak, it's not a ton of steak. On top of this, some the fat weight on the Ribeye cooks off so you end up with maybe 10-11oz. of actual meat. From a distance it makes for a great Instagram, but if you're looking to eat like Fred Flintstone, pick a different steak. (maybe the Brooklyn Filet instead?)

We asked for a few separate checks, and I can understand an included gratuity on parties of 6 or more (we were 10). But service was on the lame side - almost European-like. We had one server in charge of our table the entire meal, and she would disappear for 7-8 minutes at a time which was odd because the restaurant was really empty that Wednesday night. In example, only one tray of steak sauces was left in our vicinity (good for one or two persons max) and short of actually getting up to ask the manager, I was left no option to ask for additional sauces (worcestershire & ketchup, yeah that's how I roll) before my Ribeye would've gotten cold. 

When the checks come, everyone is hit with a 20% included gratuity. Which is kind of a mind-fuck because that is the same amount as the locals' discount. Ha!

It's a nice environs - might good for a business dinner / expense account kind of thing. 
Rather low on the value scale. Service was far from spectacular. The people we were with made it fun, but shit - this ain't summercamp. We just spent $1000+ up in here!",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,2,2,3,Huis_igaAQbL4XhgUSECxw
2292748,2013-08-09,3,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Brand is an extremely high-quality steakhouse without the unreasonable wait-time or reservation availability. Anywhere else, you normally wouldn't eat at a restaurant that's located inside of a hotel. In Vegas, it's a different story. You SHOULD eat at ALL the restaurants inside ALL of the hotels :).

We stumbled upon this place during a night out (of course) and decided to pop in before watching the Jabbawockeez. The bar was first-come-first-serve seating and it was completely open, so we sat down at a table for 4. We had the tomahawk ribeye (medium, without a doubt) and a couple of sides of vegetables. It was a perfectly cooked steak with great marbling and fantastic flavor. We came here during another Vegas trip and had the same steak and same experience! That definitely shows consistency of quality. We also tried the banana s'more dessert, which essentially is a banana stuffed with chocolate inside and marshmallows on top and roasted to perfection, then scooped out onto a piece of graham cracker just like a regular s'more, but infinitely better! Sorry for the run-on sentence, but the dessert was too good to be described in anything less than that. Too bad we couldn't pack the bone from the steak home for our dog as we normally do. 

From many seats in the restaurant, you'll have a complete view of the casino, which can be fun for people-watching. I noticed that a lot of tables ordered the ultimate steak for the whole table, which can be 40-120 oz. That's just like Thanksgiving in July. :) We would definitely like to return next time we are out there, but would also like to try all the other steakhouses in the area.",iG19Knv19qUnoDjR8pDwQw,2,2,4,M4c1C1teW1MTF-VNlj59fg

2347827,2010-07-14,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"While playing my favorite 2-cent slot machine at the Monte Carlo, I noticed the sign outside Brand advertising their Happy Hour. Hmmm...hubby and I were not starving yet but were getting hungry, and the prices looked great, so we gave it a try. This review is for the Happy Hour stuff only. I haven't tried the restaurant itself.

Happy Hour deals (5-7pm daily) are only for the bar/lounge area, so we found an empty sofa and sat back to relax. The $3 drinks cover beer, house wines and Skyy vodka drinks (not mixed drinks like a Cosmo, but you could add *a* mixer to it ). Appetizers were half-price. 

My drink was fine - Skyy vodka and cranberry juice. Hubby had a couple glasses of the house red (I think it was a Cab). We ordered the Kobe beef sliders and the meatball pizza. 

O. M. G. the sliders were AMAZING. The two sliders came with a side of fries that were equally delicious, but the burgers were perfection. They were perfectly cooked and just the right size.  $8 - what a bargain.

The thin crust meatball pizza ($7) was definitely not in the same league as the sliders. The meatball slices were not flavorful, and the crust was so thin it got soggy in the middle very quickly. I'd skip this one, but there were a number of other items that looked good (crab cakes & ""hot rocks"" - sliced sirloin). 

We think we found the winning combo to eating in Vegas - go to a buffet for lunch (better prices than dinner) and pig out. Then at happy hour, find a deal like at Brand and get half price food.

We aren't exactly foodies, but we enjoy splurging on fine dining, and while in Vegas for a weekend getaway we decided to try out Brand. We got there right at opening as we had show tickets to get to, and they did an exception job of keeping our meal moving quickly but not too fast. We were at first seated right next to the casino floor, which actually would have been fine, it was fun to watch the action, but this evening we wanted something a little more quiet and romantic and they were happy to oblige with a booth towards the back. Right behind us was a bridal party in a private room, it looks like a perfect spot for a very small Vegas wedding reception. 

It was restaurant week, which benefits the Las Vegas food bank, so we went with the restaurant week prix fixe menu. I had the wedge salad, crispy skin chicken and creme brule.

The bone-in filet (Brooklyn Filet) was cooked perfectly, and so tender, I could almost cut it with a fork.

The Crab Louie as an appetizer was presented like a work of art.

Service could stand some improvement.  Service staff was not as attentive as it should have been for the price point of the restaurant.

2575519,2011-11-13,6,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Fail, Fail, Fail. Waste of my valuable time walking into this establishment.
I write this review as I sit at the table.

After having our reservation  pushed an additional 50 minutes (table had to be cleaned and set according to the staff) we finally sat down.

Its ok we were to told by the staff to have a seat at the bar in the mean time. By the way I really appreciated the 15+ minute turn around time to deliver cocktails, I under stand how busy it can be for one waitress to serve a total of 6 total people in the bar on a Wednesday.

After finally being seated a well deserved meal was on my mind. Note to owner you might want to wipe down your suede menus before you distribute them, not a very pleasurable thing to hold a greasy and  messy menu.

After deciding on the Colorado Lamb Chop I sip on my beer anxiously awaiting my meal.

Entrees are served and I patiently wait for my meal. The second round makes its delivery and still no meal for me. At this time I instruct my party to commence the meal assuming my Lamb was on its a way out.

10 minutes pass and I start to get upset since I see no signs of our server or the manager. I ask another server to locate our server in regards to our missing meal. A few seconds later the ""Manager"" appears to my side, he ask how my meal is. I point to my empty place setting and sarcastically ask him how does he think my non existent meal taste, suddenly he darts away to the back to speak to our server.

After I am sure a heavy load of verbal abuse from the ""Manager"" our server come out and humbly apologizes for his mistake promising to correct his mistake.

So while my table feast on Tomahawk Rib Eye, Tuna Tartare and Colossal Crab. I sit here like a jackass staring at an empty place setting snacking on some dinner bread contemplating why I am still sitting here. 

Oh that's right the manager and the server both reassured me my meal ""WAS ON ITS WAY""

As meals are winding down the server comes to collect the plates with another reassurance ""My Meal Is On The Way"" at this point I tell him not bother because my party was done. He collects the remaining plates and walks to the back. 

Seconds later my meal arrives courtesy of the manager and wishes me a pleasant dinner, when I ask for the status of the crab legs I ordered as well he gives me a look of confusion a replies ""You Ordered Crab Legs as Well?"" As he starts back to the kitchen my frustration peaks and I inform him to take the meal back, I refuse to eat in front of 8 other people that have already completed their dinner.

A debate arises and the manger points out that I should still enjoy the tasty lamb regardless of the delay since its not good to just not eat, he even offers to compensate the cost of my meal and a free round of drinks. I refuse and request my table cleared.

The server makes another appearance and humbly offers his apology I can clearly see he was reprimanded by his superiors in regards to this ordeal. I accept his apology and ask to speak to his ""Manager"" in order to smooth things over, I under stand humans make mistakes.

The manager arrives and instead of  listening he begins to defend his position and goes as far as blaming my attitude for the horrible experience. At this point I am hungry, tired and upset. I walk away back to my party and dismiss myself, I figured I would head over to Subway and order a meatball sandwich for dinner.

Suddenly the ""Manager"" comes back to the table and speak to another  individual in our party trying to justify our poor experience on my attitude and sarcasm. As the two head to the corner of the restaurant to continue the argument I start this review on Yelp.

After spending $10,000 for a weeks block of rooms at the Monte Carlo I would have expected a little respect and satisfaction.

If I could give this place a zero star rating I would.

I can guarantee that this is the last time myself and our company will be using the Monte Carlo and the Brand Steakhouse services.",lY95DZCUQIpnid7eAiYmHQ,7,1,1,Y4ScynPs-hWSob6IJQqFsA

I found the setting tacky.  You don't get a feeling of calm or glamour that you expect with a pricey dinner.  Instead, the restaurant overlooks slot machines and old people plucking pennies into them.  If you're looking for some romantic ambiance, head elsewhere.  

Why four stars then?

The food was quite good.  Others in my party ordered the steak.  I had the fish.  It was a bit on the salty side but still good.  We each ordered one side which was perfect b/c then we were able to sample a little of each.  The asparagus was great as was the mac and cheese.  Also, their bread was really tasty.

I remember going to Monte Carlo, where I LOVE to gamble for some reason, and seeing a white wall where construction was being done.  Well, apparently it's done now, and the restaurant looks awesome.  This is pretty similar to Fix at the Bellagio.

I'll rate the things I got:

1. Unlimited bread to start: 5 stars - I'm a huge fan of this.  If I come back here and gamble my life savings, I'd come here and order just a soup, and gorge on this stuff.  I like it even better than the bread at Texas Roadhouse.

2.  Kobe beef burger - 4.5 stars - this was pretty much the cheapest thing on the menu at $20, but it was mainly the Kobe label that got me.  The burger was huge, and I was definitely stuffed at the end.

3.  Asparagus appetizer - 3 stars - nothing special here, it was good, but only came with about 6 pieces.

4.  Lobster mashed potatoes - 5 stars - this was pretty awesome.  Definitely treated my palate to a treat.

The lounge is spacious yet still very intimate.  The layout and colors are quite nice. Very comfortable and a great place to grab drinks and relax or have a business lunch cocktail.

The large group I went with ordered a lot of different cocktails  during the evening spent there. Every person was impressed with their cocktail. The bartenders are very friendly and from the evening I went they were both skilled mixologists as well. The cocktail waitress was friendly  too.

You will get a nice pour and great cocktail for the price you pay.  When you come across great service or skilled bartenders or servers make sure you are taking care of them (tipping well). 

Being in the liquor industry you come across a lot of places that have sub -par service  and/or outrageous prices.  Brand delivers great service and  fair prices.

I expected there would be some delays, even with a reservation, given the date.  The greeting staff was very friendly and managed the crowd fairly well.  It was pretty clear that they had overbooked for the day, but nonetheless, they were able to accommodate everyone.  What became the problem was they server.  She was fairly inattentive to some of her customers, including us, but friendlier with others.  She took our order and an hour had gone by without as much as an update.  During that time we had seen several other couples sat, served and closed out before we even got our food.  Sadly to say, they only obvious trend of who was being ignored and who was not was racial differences.  A nice black couple was sitting across from us, who were already there when we arrived.  They had their young son with them as well.  Out thought was that they had already eaten when we arrived, but then an older man approached us to tell us that they had to wait over an hour for their food and that the couple with their son had been waiting even longer.  That poor child seemed tired by the time their food came, which coincidentally came only minutes before ours.
After losing every ounce of patience left in me, I finally asked for the manager.  He was very professional and apologetic for the delay and asked the kitchen for an update.  Throughout all this time, our server avoided our table and continued to serve the tables she clearly had a preference for.  There was never an apology or explanation for the delay.  To add insult to injury, the food was pretty bad.  How can a steakhouse screw up steak?  

Despite what that server may have thought, we deserved to be in that place.  I shouldn't have to show my paycheck to prove that we are worthy of her service.

Our waiter (John) was excellent. Extremely knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. His relaying of the daily specials was so convincing that it almost sold me on a $120 wagyu steak. Ultimately, my coworker and I both got the bone-in rib eye. The steak was very good. Maybe not quite as good as I had hoped for, but tender, juicy, well-seasoned. My medium rare was basically rare, but I didn't mind. I got it topped with goat cheese, and while I absolutely love goat cheese, they put so much on that I had to scrape some off. The sides were standard. The mashed potatoes were pretty tasty. I also had Rodenbach Grand Cru on tap which is the first sour I've ever really enjoyed, and it complimented the meal perfectly. 

10/10 for our waiter, 8.5/10 for the food. If this wasn't a paid-for business dinner, I might've been slightly underwhelmed for $80/person. Still a solid option.",pl9w4iMnxzOu-R76YNC20Q,0,0,4,WSbEV2cgsTyHbXnw7vnr5g

With that being said, I had one of the most incredible dinners here to date. Starting with cocktails, I had to try the cucumber martini as this is one of my favorite drinks, but I'm very picky about the preparation, has to made with Hendrick's Gin, I'm not much of a vodka drinker, so I was hesitant to try this, but our server encouraged me to try it, made with Square One Cucumber Vodka, cucumber essence, lime, cane nectar, this was actually pretty good, but the next cocktail I tried is still haunting me in my dreams to this day, Heat of The Moment, made with Patron Silver, fresh lime and passion fruit, smoking hot fresno chiles and smoking peppers. Hands down best cocktail I've ever had. Ever. When you take a sip, the passion fruit comes together with the chiles to create a magnificent spicy and sweet drink. They have an amazing mixologist behind that bar. 

We started out with The Big Wedge Salad, I have a soft spot for this kind of salad, and it came out on separate plates without us even having to ask to split. I needed help ordering as I honestly have no idea about cuts of steak and what not. I went with the Tomahawk Ribeye only because it looked like so much fun. My date had the Brooklyn Filet, I had a bite and I liked this WAY better than my steak. Dang I hate when that happens. I learned that I prefer a filet over a ribeye (less fat and more clean tasting). Both were cooked to perfection. We shared a couple sides and the Baked Mac & Cheese stood out the most.

The atmosphere is fun, the restaurant is open to the casino, so you have a birds eye view of the tables, and we even got to see the Blue Man Group Parade come through.

Group of girlfriends and myself had dinner here for a bachelorette weekend. For a pricey steakhouse the food was subpar.

I am in hospitality and am always more forgiving when its busy and servers are behind but this was a joke. 

The absolute worst and unforgivable part of experience involves server FRAUD which was never resolved much to my dismay. My credit card was incorrectly charged almost $400 dollars. I tried to contact the manager, JONATHAN, for months only to make no progress. I tried to connect with the website emails with no response. My last resort was to report it to my credit card company but this is where they slipped through the cracks. The bill was originally paid with my credit card but was supposed to be reversed since the bill ended up being paid in cash. Careless me, didn't wait for the receipts for proof and that was enough for the credit card company to dq me even if I didn't sign the receipt. They say it was b/c the card was swiped and that is considered enough for approval.

My husband was immediately put off by the 10 minute wait for the waiter to get our wine order.  I'm okay with a slow dinner, but if you're not, pay attention.  The wine list was decent, nothing special.  The wine my husband chose (even though I am usually the wine-chooser) was gone, so the waiter did a substitute for us that was okay.  We had some oysters - they were $3 in the menu, but he informed us that they had just jumped to $4 because they were bigger (I'd hate to see what they were before, these were not large by any means).  He had the tomato soup, which came with mini grilled cheese, he loved it.  I had a filet mignon, cooked just fine, but wasn't that tender.  He had the Tomahawk rib-eye, which was decently flavored.  The sides were nothing special at all.  Overcooked asparagus, mashed potatoes that need the sauce they served the steak with (first clue:  steak needs no sauce if it is truly stellar).  He had the mac 'n cheese, I am anti-cheese, but he liked it.  The service was merely okay.  If I am paying this much, I want a server with some charisma, though.  This one lacked it.

She also got pissed off that most people in our party needed separate checks. Granted, there was about 20 of us so I definitely understand how annoying that was but we had all just came for a wedding and that's the last thing that the bride and groom need to spoil the night. She said ""well, how do I know you all need separate checks unless you TELL me first?! I don't know who's all together!"" RUDE!

Lastly, my friend ordered the chicken breast and in the fine print, it said that you get mashed potatoes with it but he didn't read that part so he asked to get a side of the baked potato. So, he ended up with 2 full sides of potatoes. He asked why he got 2 & she informed him about the mashed potatoes. He said he had no idea and she shoulda explained why he wanted 2 full starches.

-We've had two experiences with....
-THE GIRL'S AT THE FRONT COUNTER, I DONT KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM, MAYBE THEY THINK THEY ARE THE BEST SH*T IN THIS WORLD, hmM  BUT they seriously need to knock off that fake smile and the hello's and goodbye's that come with a major attitude. 
-They are cute, but with that ""IM THE BEST SHIT"" that ever happened to brand STEAKhouse attitude,  their faces can be EASILY overlooked and masked with a  ""BI*CH YOU UGLY"" if they keep their snobby ass attitude up! 
-they will stare at you from a good 5 feet away, even while you walk up with NO smile or grin. than wait for you to speak. they WAIT!
as soon as i say ""party of 5"" it's like they are programmed to not say anything else! 
""Do you have a reservation?""

-No...

""ok, wait on the side and we'll call you right up while they set up the table""

-Here i am thinking, THIS SNOBBY bitch was too bust hatin on me that she didnt even ask for a name??? how the hell is she going to call us...
""Uhh hey you??""

RUDE, WHICH TOTALLY puts THIS HI-END STEAK HOUSE in a bad light!

Anyway, Our server was great, he was very attentive and friendly.
My party had exactly 5 people which meant tip is automatically deducted.

So with the tip immediately added, i would hope for nothing less than excellent service!

THE food here is GREAT, their steak is cooked to soft PERFECTION.
IT IS NOT CHEWY NOR RUBBERY.
WELL, DUH WITH THE PRICES THEY CHARGE HERE, I WOULD NEVER WANT TO GNAW ON A RUBBERY PIECE OF MEAT!

the bread is brought out *ONLY UPON REQUEST* SO i suggest you ask for that cause it was delicious!

BUT IF ONLY THEIR BUTTER THAT came with that WERE SALTED, which it wasnt! it was plain unsalted butter with regular oven baked dinner roll type bread.

nonetheless, that is the only thing that is free besides water.
so don;t pass up the opportunity.


*their spinach was a tab bit bitter-

*their hash-browns are ok, nothing out of the ordinary, i would not pay $13 or so for regular hash-browns.

*they were out of a few items we ordered! after 15 mins of placing our order than he comes at let's us know (it;s like why not be considerate and add a note in the menu, or even word of mouth?)


I GIVE 2 STARS FOR THEIR OYSTER'S!!

THEY WERE THE BEST!

NO GRAINY TASTE.
NO OCEAN SEA FISH AROMA!

2834529,2012-05-25,3,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Thank you, Brand, for offering such an amazing value on your prix fixe menu for Yelp's Spring Break! I admit, that's why I came - having never really heard much about the restaurant, but what a gem! We were even there right when dinner started, and although we were one of the only folks in the place, the service and ambiance still made it feel very special. And on that note - service was really great.

For our starters, Mr. L and I shared the Hot Rocks and the Brand Salad. Hot Rocks was so much fun! What's not to love about an 850F rock that you cook razor thin slices of sirloin on. And the amount of flavor they were able to get in those little slices was surprising, too. The Brand Salad: I know, salad, boring, right?... no. There wasn't even lettuce in the salad --- straight shrimp, green beans, and tomatoes --- big chunks of shrimp, and plenty to share. Impressive.

Entrees: Let's be honest, we both wanted the 12oz bone in Brooklyn Filet... but in the interest of variety, we only got one, and we got the Chilean Sea Bass. And quite honestly, I think the Sea Bass was a contender for the title. Both were amazing. Tender/flaky, perfectly cooked, seasoned, the works. The risotto with the Sea Bass was also a winner, and was cooked with lobster broth and gave me even *more* shrimp! What's not to love?

There's also nothing not to love about the mac and cheese, and believe me, I know my mac and cheese. This had a thick creaminess to it, with that crunchy breadcrumb topping. Lots of flavor, lots of cheese, nicely cooked pasta.

Dessert was just excessive, but we forced down one of them... Baked Alaska was a nice meal ender - not too heavy, strawberry icecream concoction. I'd order that again. We brought the cheesecake home and that made for a great breakfast ;-)

Wine list was also pretty extensive and had a good range in prices. I'd definitely go back for a special night - I might split a few more dishes than I did, but hey, hard to turn down such a generous prix fixe deal!",1FPrIJ7TASO595N8oRXAzg,3,2,5,7-6nMoRIvkjIMB5jOfEVJA

the ribeye was phenomenal. i have a weakspot for wagyu but it was so good. i almost didn't have to chew and if my stomach allowed i wouldn't have. great mushrooms and the mac n cheese was phenomenal. they know what they are doing and i can't say that about many of the famous steakhouses in the country. some places have a bazillion staff members but very few know anything about truly great steak. actually most steak house in vegas have great clout or branding but execution is pitiful

service was phenomenal. of course im beautiful but im not exactly screaming 'whale'. however they never once made our party feel like we're tourists from the middle of omaha nebraska. they know many tourists go through the place and make sure that all of them can recall brand as one of the highlights of their time in vegas. 

i am surprised its in monte carlo. cosmo or aria should QUICKLY steal it if possible. monte carlo is lucky that it has this place. however the perk is that if you're near by you dont have to fight through all the crowds and cluster yet still get one of THE best meals in vegas. if this place was in aria or cosmo or etc it could easily add a 20% mark up

However, Brand served up a Salmon with assorted greens on top with a sauce that was unbelievably good.  Not only was it the best Salmon I've ever had; it was the best fish I've ever had (and salmon isn't even normally a fish I like that much).   SO good.

We stayed at the Monte Carlo during our Valentine's trip last week. While we could not get reservations on Valentine's night, we got them for the following night. 
Service: The service was seriously impeccable. I believe our server's name was Chris and he was absolutely amazing. 
Appetizer: Fried calamari. Perfect. 10 out of 10. Probably the best we have ever had anywhere!
Meal: We got the steak for 2 which was the porterhouse, sliced off the bone. I am a rare steak kind of person and my boyfriend is more medium rare. The steak came out pretty rare, even for me. But we ate it anyway and we were not disappointed in the least. The flavor was awesome despite being a little under-cooked. I wasn't too crazy about the house sauces (red wine Worcestershire and a peppercorn sauce) but they weren't terrible. They were out of asparagus but they subbed us some broccolini cooked in browned butter which was just out of this world. We also split a baked potato which could have been fluffier but was still delicious regardless.
Dessert: Strawberry baked Alaska. This is like a 15 out of 10. If we could have licked the plate I think we would have. It was spectacular. 
The only things I will take points off for are the music (it's pretty loud but I think that's because it's right beside the casino and it has to be sort of loud to drown out that noise) and the little things we found wrong with the meal.",X9TszgvmUhIivGbXlsM-BA,0,0,4,gXJiKViIYeyWVKKtQJV1Lg

located inside monte carlo hotel casino, the lounge area of this steakhouse turns into an upscale karaoke joint. the crowd were mostly groups celebrating their bachelorette or perhaps visiting from out of town and just want to be in a place to people-watch. there's a lot of good looking people in the crowd. the songs that were sang were all crowd pleasers. 

song selection: 
LOTS! if it's not in the book, just go tell the DJ what you want to sing.

TIP:
turn your song in as soon as you make up your mind otherwise, you will never get to go!

First off it's located basically in the casino so it's not very romantic but we settled to eat here because we were starving and the reviews on yelp were great.

We ordered the steak for 2 ($99)added a lobster tail($25) and glazed mushrooms($5each, which the server insisted we would need 2 of) and the mashed potatoes($10) & creamed spinach($11) sides. We were starving but concerned it would be way too much food, but the server insisted it wouldn't be too much.
The food came out with an interesting presentation and we began to feast. Now the steak and lobster were COLD and the server didn't really swing back around to see how things were so we just ate it. It was also waaaaay too much food and there is no way any 2 ppl could ever finish it. 
I mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday and they did nothing special or even acknowledged it. At this point very annoyed the server drops the check and I just pay to get out of this casino trap filled with cig smoke.

Fortunately there are more secluded booths farther back in the restaurant.

Decorated in dark wood with dim lighting Brand certainly looks the part of ""steakhouse"" There is a full service bar and lounge area as well which showcases half priced apps and reduced drinks for Happy Hour.

We ordered the Prime Rib and added a lobster tail.  The normal cut 12 ounces was $35 and the lobster tail was an additional $25.  I ordered the large cut which was 16 ounces and cost $39.00.  The prime was tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, seasoned well and just darn Yummy.  Au Jus and creamy horseradish came along with the prime.  The lobster tail was about 6-8 ounces and also steamed perfectly.  Accompanied by melted butter, there was a hidden surprise inside the lobster tail shell was a cornbread type stuffing flavored with lobster bits.  The stuffing was scrumdelicious and made for a perfect bite paired with the sweet lobster.

Sides averaged $9-12 each and they had a special of 3 for $25. We tried the loaded potato, mushrooms and green beans.  The potato and mushrooms were good, but the green beans were way to ""Al Dente"" for us, our server swapped the beans out for creamed spinach.
All the sides were good and the mushrooms in particular were very good :)

Although we didn't have room for desert, we did look at the menu and prices are only $10 per desert so don't worry about desert breaking the bank if you have room to order some.

And to top it all off, it was a great deal because of a Yelp Deal (thanks to Yelp Las Vegas CM, Misti). Even at regular prices, though, it is well worth it. My first course was the ""Brand Salad,"" which was a mixture of large chunks of chilled shrimp, bacon, tomatoes, and beans tossed with  vinagrette. The salad was of substantial size, and in and of itself could be a meal for many people. The salad was simple, elegant, and well balanced. I had the bone-in fillet mignon for my main course. The fillet had a nice smoky flavor, was well seasoned, and perfectly cooked to my request (medium rare). It came with 2 dipping sauces, of which I thoroughly enjoyed the peppercorn sauce. For a side I had the mac and cheese with 4 cheeses, peas, and bacon. It was very good, but a little too rich as an accompaniment to a fillet mignon. For dessert I had the cheesecake.

Peppercorn or red wine reduction Worcestershire.

Baked Mac and Cheese - this was really good, so heavy.

Broccolini (they were out of asparagus) - I love veggies.

Creme Brulee - freaking awesome.

Kentucky Butter Cake - good, came with a candle for the birthday girl.

FOOD - 3.5 stars: This was my first visit, my date raves about the ribeye at Brand Steakhouse so we'll come back so I can try it. I prefer my steak without any sauces.

SERVICE - 3.5 stars: The staff was great in clearing our plates. However, I thought it would have been kind of our waiter to comp one of the desserts for the birthday girl. After all, he received a fat tip from us.

For dinner we had the meal for four it was an 80 oz steak we shared with two sides which we got garlic mash and grandma's mac n' cheese dinner was equally as good loved the mac n' cheese it was super creamy. As we rolled right onto dessert we got a kentucky butter cake to share simply light yet delicious. Over all experience was stupendous!! Service was great, a must go next time we hit up Vegas again.",2F0USVCt5826T8Fq8H4AiQ,1,2,5,fynIIb2KFlmxr6NESrHf9Q

We had reservations @ 9:30pm and by the time we got there, our table wasn't even ready.  Waited about 15min. which was getting me upset since I noticed there were plenty of empty tables.  So I was thinking, the food better be damn good to make up for the lack of competence by the hostess.

By the time we sat down, I was starving.  Took us only about 5min. to decide on what we wanted.  I ordered the prime rib, she ordered to filet mignon and her friend ordered the chilean sea bass.  We also had 3 sides, mac & cheese, grilled mushrooms, and mashed potatoes.  

All 3 entrees were sublime.  The filet melted in your mouth like ice cream on a hot sunny day.  The prime rib was juicy and tender.  The sea bass was amazing also.  The mashed potatoes was so creamy, it's like they just put a tub of butter and mashed one tiny potato.

I wouldn't have came here otherwise since I'm not a fancy fan, but this is the time for splurging and rewarding yourself for being an awesome person. My group purchased a prix fixe which included appetizer, entree and dessert.

-=-Beef carpaccio-=- Thin cut slices of raw beef. Here's the kicker, they were topped with truffle slices. These were delicious. We also had tuna tartare at the table, but I preferred this for an appetizer.

-=-Mac cheese-=- I got to try this from a neighbor. It's cheesy and good. Really, the frills here are the bread crumbs on top. While it wasn't unique enough to meet the caliber of gourmet food, I would have gladly scarfed these down in any other situation.

-=-Filet Mignon, rare-=- It was either filet, salmon, or chicken. It came with 2 different sauces, but none that I really liked. The cream sauce was too strong on the milky side, and the pepper sauce had an undesirable after-taste. I ate the filet the way I usually eat my steaks, sauceless. While a filet cut is usually the most tender, for some reason my meat just seemed a bit too tough for my taste....tough meaning too warm of a temperature.

-=-Cheesecake-=- It seemed there was no way to go wrong with the choices of 2 desserts here. I enjoyed this cheesecake thoroughly. It wasn't too sweet and was rather large and fluffy, exactly how I enjoy my cheesecakes.",N6llta3D8IVSPQ2k_rvWbA,0,0,4,fU5VmeM5cavhXdCTnuIr-w

The first to go down were the amazing loaded baked potato mashed potatoes (order that after a few of Brand's delicious Cable Cars). There were vegetables involved somewhere, creamed spinach and killer macaroni and cheese (yes, mac and cheese is a vegetable as far as Im concerned, it doesn't have seeds you know) but those were a mere tasty calm on war our ravaged table.

3309517,2014-03-11,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Reservation for bachelor party for 9 at 7:30PM on a Saturday, prompt seating, attractive host.  Sat at a long rectangular table with battery powered candles, and very dim lighting.  Didn't appear too crowded.

We were served dinner rolls that came in small cast iron pots.  Rolls had the texture of Kings Hawaiian Rolls only they were baked fresh and not as sweet as a Hawaiian Roll. They were served with whipped butter and the rolls were refilled at least once.

Drinks were typically priced per a $$$ restaurant charging around $10 for most drinks including Stella which appeared to be the only beer from the tap.  Stella was served in a stella glass.

Ice water was refilled constantly which was great for a group of guys suffering dehydration.  During rehydration, by the time the water was refilled for the last guy, the busser would have to refill the glass from the first guy.

If you plan to share an ultimate steak, do yourself a favor and figure out the price per ounce for the steak for each option.  There's actually a fairly big price jump from a steak that serves four people to a steak that serves six people and I wasn't quite sure why.  So we decided to just go with our own selections.

Our table ordered three Tomahawk Steaks 24oz, 2 chilean seabass, 3 prime ribs, and a filet.  My Tomahawk 24oz was medium rare, and came out perfect.  Crisp char on the outside, warm red center.  Couldn't tell if it was purple on the inside due to the dim lighting, but it was perfectly salted, marbled, and bursting with flavor and I devoured it all including some gnawing on the bone.  The 24oz tomahawk steak had a slice of baslamic butter on the top that slowly melted.  The plate wasn't very hot, but it wasn't cold.  Sometimes I don't think the steak needs a 500 degree plate so this wasn't a bad thing.  I tried the prime rib from a friend's plate, however I had four slices of prime rib at the Mandalay Bay Buffet the night before with Au Jus and there isn't a whole lot of room for improvement on a decent buffe prime rib so I stand by my choice to order the Tomahawk Ribeye and have no regrets. 

The condiments were supposed to serve two people according to our waitress, but I think they should be considered just 1 serving (except for the mashed potatoes) because the brocolini's, and the mac/cheese, corn, etc was quite small.  The green beans were on par with hometown buffet, and the mashed potatoes were a little sticky and gooey that they were as good as the mashed potatoes at the Exalibur buffet.  At least the broccoli wasn't overcooked and didn't taste like tap water.  These were, afterall side dishes but the price tag and very small portions left me a bit dissapointed because I feel there is room for improvement.

For dessert I ordered the bread pudding and my friend ordered the chocolate cake.  The cake was not all that impressive and even the plating composition needed some help with the layout of chocolates, a cupcake, and some syrup.  My friend said it wasn't special and I agreed that it tasted like microwaved lavacake from a grocery store.  The bread pudding was above average, the sugar glaze was over the top sweet, and the portion was very generous for $10.  The bread pudding I would consider to serve 2 people because it comes in its own cast iron pot that was about 3 inches deep, and maybe 6 inches wide with a side of glaze.  I didn't even have the urge to try the cheese cake due to the lack of excitement we all had for the desserts, and we ended up leaving some chocolate cake, bread pudding, and cheese cake behind on the table.  BTW, this place serves expresso if you need to a pick me up.

Brand made my steak perfect, the rolls were great, service was top notch, but the side dishes and dessert need a little help.  Luckily the steak was good enough for me to come back someday.",rnjBdYyS48yXqCK8dedsQQ,1,1,4,RAd3e_sP6e_jMtJBEvVF0A

So we came downstairs last night after getting settled in our room. Thursday night, 4th of July weekend. We ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye done medium rare again and split it. The service was very slow, especially given there were more empty tables than occupied tables in the place. That would have been ok since we weren't in a hurry and just felt happy to be there. Then, we ordered wine from the wine list. We live in the San Francisco Bay Area so I'm keenly aware of all things wine, especially vintages and the difference a year or two can make with the same wine. So we ordered our wine... It was supposed to be a 2010 Knights Valley Cabernet. When the waitress brought the bottle, it was a 2012 vintage. So we sent it back and this time selected the 2008 Jordan Cabernet. She came back and apologized and said that they only had the 2011 vintage, and gave us a taste. So, we sent that back and tried again... This time we ordered the Joseph Phelps 2010 Cabernet and the waitress graciously gave it to us for the same price as the Jordan would have been... And this is why I've bumped the place up to 2 stars... The waitress made good. 

Food- we ordered the Tomshawk ribeye medium rare. I found it tough and not terribly juicy or flavorful. For $58 I expected more from this steak. I couldn't finish it... Too chewy.

So my boyfriend and I went here this weekend as part of our weekend in Vegas celebrating our 6 month anniversary. Read the good reviews and we were also staying at this hotel along with a $50 dining credit from MyVegas made this an easy choice to choose as our first fine dining Las Vegas experience. I made reservations online, requesting a booth and stating it was our anniversary. This restaurant is open to the casino floor, but surprisingly, inside the restaurant, you do not hear all the casino noise. Anyways, so we checked in and were seated right away... in a corner with a TINY table with neighbors in the connecting seats... I was NOT happy with that as I had requested a booth ahead of time. I asked the waitress if there was a booth instead as I had already asked for a booth with my reservation... she was nice and moved us to a booth with a LARGE table! Honeslty, for a high end steak house, I think the small tables they have are not practical! They are so small that you will be lucky if you can fit your steak on the table. Also, those tables were not stable and shaky... I'm glad our waitress was nice enough to move us to a booth. 

Anyways, so after being moved into the booth, we were both much happier! There was actually room for my clutch, our drinks and food. Despite the table mishaps, the service was great. They were very attentive and our water cups were never empty. For starters, we ordered the hot rocks appetizer that everyone seems to rave about. It was 6 slices of beef that you cook on these hot rocks they bring out to the table. Expensive as it was $19... but it was so good! The meat was tender and tasty and it was fun to cook it on the rocks! about 3 seconds on each side unless you want it really well cooked! We've never done that before! The marinade tasted like a vinegar marinade. 

For our entree, we went for the ultimate steak for 2 for $99! A 40 ounce t-bone porterhouse cooked to perfection. As our side, we chose the mac and cheese. I personally did not think that we could finish it... but it was so good that we devoured the whole thing!! We were trying to get as much meat off the bone as possible too! They bring you the steak already cut up so it's pretty easy to eat. The mac and cheese side was a good choice!! It was creamy and not overly cheesy. The bread crumbs baked on top added a delightful crunch! I'm not too big on mac and cheese and even I was loving this mac and cheese!

They also have complimentary bread... but you have to ask for it. I saw people post pictures of bread... so I asked our waiter and he said we had to ask for it, so I did. They brought it quickly with butter. the bread was so soft and warm. We loved it with the butter. I wanted to make steak sandwiches! I was stuffed with my half of the steak... but my boyfriend wanted more because it was so good. He claimed he could eat another ultimate steak by himself... I told him there was a steak challenge, lol. I've also heard about the ""ultimate steak challenge"", however I never saw it advertised anywhere. We did not order dessert as I was full and I was hoping they would bring us something for our anniversary... but nothing came unfortunately. Oh well...

Conclusion, excellent steakhouse with excellent service. Minus 1 star because I had made reservations asking for a booth and instead we were seated at the smallest table possible that shared seats with others. The original waitress had no issues with moving us to a booth, so I don't know what was up with that... also, they didn't do anything to acknowledge our celebration like Andre's did... so while service was excellent, it was not ""above and beyond""... so 4 stars for this place in the end. Prices here are high, but the food is excellent and comes out quickly. Even with the higher prices, I think it's worth the cost. I would definitely come here again!

The orders came out with decent speed for the quality of food.  We came here twice in a row and enjoyed each night.  In the center of the Monte Carlo hotel in Las Vegas we saw Brand Steakhouse.  Not one for tight budgets but a nice experience nonetheless.  A nice bar where some try to pick up women or enjoy drinks and of course, the tables for eating.

The sliders (mini-burgers) were  delicious, made of Kobe beef with good seasoning, no salt, sauce or ketchup required.  They must have been about 2-3 inches in diameter.  The beef tasted soft, moist and pink (keep your mind out of the gutter, lol).  Thier steaks are excellent, not rough, juicy, prime choice meat.

I dug thier fries, mac/cheese and thier veggie sides.  The serve you good tasting fries on a metal cup like the in pictures shown.   I also shared a Baked Alaska with a freind, at that moment it tasted like it was the worlds greatest.  The baked alaska was a pink creamy heaven, every mouthful was top notch.

The waitresses were great, they are all in formal uniforms.  They were both freindly, informative and entertaining.  The second night, our waitress was informative, cool and lovely.  She explained the steak challenge, which our biggest guy could not finish, since he ordered half the amount and did not finish that steak.

I made reservations through Light Group for the Bachelorette Package which also includes VIP access into their affiliated clubs and lounges in Vegas.  All-in-all, a good deal, but probably not something I'd do again as the meals can get rather pricey and VIP access is not really needed into the lounges, just the clubs, and I'm not much of a clubber.   

Our server was excellent with attending to our needs and the hostesses were also very helpful and courteous to us. The look of the place screamed; ""Heifer!"", from the ginormous bull nostril portrait, to the suede placemats, to the cow-print ceilings, it was one of the last places you'd expect a Veggie like me to be, but it was for my sister's bachelorette, so I didn't have a cow about it (pun intended). 

On to the food, appetizers of shrimp cocktail were put on the table, I didn't try it but the other girls in the group loved them and finished them all. I did have the fresh bread,  which didn't real need butter as they had so much flavor and were very soft. I ordered the Veggie Pasta and it was your run-of-the-mill penne with marinara and some sauteed vegetables tossed in, nothing spectacular. The dish came with a side of crispy fries presented in an adorable paper cone while the ketchup was encased in a teeny glass Mason jar. The place is dedicated to their steak, and three other girls ordered it but I heard neither rave nor poor reviews around the table so I assume it was more of the run-of-the-mill fare that I experienced with my pasta. 

The last course of the evening included an offering of  mini desserts, each one too cute to eat, but we hoovered them still. They presented us with mini powered donuts with a serving of caramel sauce, bon bons dipped in peanut brittle and  coffee flavored creme brulee. The bons bons were the star of the show; the peanut brittle coating harmonized with the chocolate shell and vanilla ice cream so well..I would go back just for those, too bad it's a four hour drive away!",AFli7zIkk9XdZ2bYHU9Sxg,0,0,4,aR2B39SvlQKndaPO8F5yxA

But this restaurant came up with an incredible prix fixe menu for Yelp Spring Break, and my party of six was blown away with the quality of our meal.

Our waiter and the rest of the staff were attentive, although, if I recall correctly, it may have taken a while to get the bill.  Other than that, recommendations were awesome, drinks were always refilled before they went empty, service was prompt, etc... and I really enjoyed the environment of this restaurant as well; just feet away from the casino floor, yet not too loud that you can't carry on a conversation.  Our booth was comfortable as well.

My group chose a bottle of Terrazas Malbec from their plentiful wine selection, although the cocktails looked awesome too.  And before our first course, we requested Brand's infamous cast-iron baked dinner rolls, which were doughy heaven!

The best part of the experience, aside from the company, were the courses that followed.  Be forewarned though: portions are huge!  I had a wedge salad to start, the Chilean Sea Bass as my entree, and I shared sides with Katie B: the creamed spinach and the asparagus.  Everything was delicious!  I think I was in a food coma half way through my entree, but I managed to almost polish off my Baked Alaska dessert as well!

Others in our group were also pleased with their selections: Filet Mignon, Chicken, Tuna Tartare, and more.  

Time to start watching my diet again now that Yelp Spring Break is over, but I'm sure I'll be ready to dine at Brand again next visit to Vegas.

I took my friend here to celebrate his birthday in December 2012. The hostess in front of the restaurant was very nice, and we were seated promptly because I had made reservations ahead of time. The lighting was very dim and you could make out ""cow decor,"" you'll see what I mean when you eat there. It's definitely a very relaxing environment.

Thank you to the Yelpers that gave me the tips about the Hot Rocks appetizer. We ordered it, and LOVED it! It was so much fun cooking it like that, and we wish there was more because the meat was so flavorful.

I ordered the New York Sirloin and honestly, I've never had a softer steak. It cut easily and they cooked it a PERFECT medium rare. Which is hard for me to find around here for some reason. My friend ordered the Chef's Nightly Wagyu Selection. I had a bite and mm mm mm! It was juicy and delicious. I wanted to finish his, haha. 

During our meal, the Blue Man Group was parading around the hotel. They even had a conga line going and that was certainly entertaining.

the steak was tender and the portion was perfect. however, it was accompanied by a spoonful of mashed potatoes. seriously. it was like two tablespoons of potatoes. again strange. the best part of the meal was the banana smores. so simple yet so perfect. i wasn't a fan of the coconut peanut butter sauce though. thankfully, it was served on the side.

So happy we chose this place though. It's located in the Monte Carlo hotel, which wasn't far from Vdara at all. We took a taxi, but found out we could have taken the Tram Train there instead for free. The ambiance was relaxing, lights were dimmed.. Could be romantic for couples. We were seated right away and also greeted by our server (forgot her name already). We both ordered the Passion Fruit cocktail and received it within 5 minutes. It was SO refreshing and reminded me of a mojito, but very tasty and not so minty like a regular mojito.

I wanted to order the ""Big Lobster"" (2 Pound Crab Brioche Stuffed Maine Lobster), but they ran out, so instead I ordered the 24 ounce Tomahawk Rib eye with a loaded baked potato on the side. My cousin also ordered the Rib eye and lobster as her side.

We didn't have to wait too long for our food which was great. We were both very hungry and anxious.

The rib eye was VERY overwhelming, but looked so delicious! The bone was the size of my forearm, no lie! I also couldn't wait to get a taste of the loaded baked potato as well. It was definitely loaded and I knew both items would fill me up for the rest of the night.

Of course, both items were very delicious. The only negative thing I would say is that it was a bit chewy and bad more fat on it than I imagined. So maybe the next time around, I will have it cooked to medium well done instead of medium rare. The red wine sauce it came with was magnificent. It had a similar taste to A-1, but so much better. You could definitely taste the red wine, but it wasn't too potent. It was perfect.

My cousin loved her rib eye as well as she got the same kind as me. But she loved her lobster tail even more. They stuff it, but I'm not sure with what... she couldn't stop picking at it, even though it was all gone! (lol) Our bill came out to be about $200, which wasn't bad in my opinion. I had so much rib eye left over, I had to take a to go box. 

Our server was so kind, very attentive.. I would give her 5 stars alone. At the end of dinner, we were offered dessert but we were way too full to eat. We actually went back to the hotel to take a nap LOL.

This place blew my mind. Mind you I had eaten all day and we only came for appetizers but that was still great.

Hot Rocks- what the place is basically known for. They bring out an 800 degree volcanic rock and you cook your sirloin meat on it. So amazing, fun, bitchin, and tasty.
Caprese_ My absolute fav. Fresh, crunchy, and the toasts were savory.
Ahi Tartare- Just the right amount and very flavorful with garlic. 
Mac n Cheese- This needs to be eaten wearing sweats. Straight up. That's so fat fuck it was. 
Ceasar Salad- My friend got that one. It was more traditional.

Lobster tail has a bed of ritz crust which is very rich and filling, I feel it is unnecessary if you have a really nice lobster tail.  Friends had large lobster tail, they loved it.

A year ago we went on our anniversary and they were so kind and provided us each a free glass of champagne. We returned this weekend for my husband early birthday celebration! Everything was perfect from start to finish. We were greeted by a very nice gentleman who walked us to our seats and even placed the napkin on my lap. Alex was our server and she was out of this world amazing. I remember her serving us over 5 years ago. She makes a lasting impression. She knew the menu top to bottom. I had a question about an unfamiliar ingredient on the menu and she provided me with thorough details and description. She checked on us often which was so sweet. At the end of the meal they provided my husband with a dessert and candle as I had mentioned going in that we were there for his birthday! Our meal was phenomenal. They brought us out hot bread and butter the minute we sat down! We ate it all- it's that good! My husband enjoyed his oysters and steak which was cooked to perfection. We split a French onion soup and they were so kind and put it into 2 separate bowls. The onions in the soup are so caramelized and tons of cheese on top!! Best soup I've had in my 32 years of life. The side dishes melted in our mouths. I used to enjoy a carbonara type pasta they once had and removed from the menu.

That actually ended up not being a problem, so I think it says a lot that that chaotic element was mostly eliminated from the dining experience. The restaurant interior is slightly dark, but not so dark that you can't see the funny cattle-inspired ceiling paint job. Appetizers, salads and drinks all had that extra Vegas dollar (or five) that you only find in Sin City. I didn't think the entrée selections had similar markups.

Our table shared the ultimate steak for four, which was easily shared by six grown men. This was thanks to the free rolls (DELICIOUS!) and the three sides that come with the ultimate steak. There is plenty of food to go around. The steak was mostly cooked medium rare, but they did make an appreciated effort to get some medium portions as well for the two of us that preferred a longer cook. I had some of the more medium rare pieces and thought they were quite good despite that not being my normal preference. The ultimate steak comes with two house steak sauces that I thought complimented the taste of the meat quite well.

We ordered asparagus and some mushrooms as our sides. I didn't try the mushroom plate because I'm not one to eat mush. The asparagus was supple, and had a delicious flavor. They came with an even better sauce that could be poured on them. A side of potatoes also comes with every ultimate steak. We did have to send those back because they were very crunchy. The new potatoes came out quickly and were better cooked, though there were still some crunchy pieces towards the bottom.

All in all, I paid $70 for my share of the appetizers, entrée, taxes, tip and my soda. Not bad at all. Brand turned out to be a great place for the nice bachelor party dinner we were looking to have for our friend.",WTiaDkingt4REyh4bH_qUA,0,0,4,jmTjS41P3MMNVoeqadtddQ

I think it was a pretty good deal, $20 entry fee and ladies get free drinks all night.

I saw sooo many people around the bar and only one bartender... dang I thought I was going to be there forever.. but I was wrong, the female bartender was super quick to get to everyone.

We started off the evening at their lounge and enjoyed two for one drinks. The bartender was friendly and the atmosphere was just right. We were seated at our table by the casino floor which was the best seat in the house for people watching. Our waitress, Alexan, was friendly, attentive, and professional throughout our meal. I definitely recommend getting a table in her section.

We started off with some appetizers to split. We all enjoyed the wedge salad, tuna tartare, and a Hot Rocks (a large hot rock to prepare some thinly sliced sirloin at your table). All apps were awesome and I recommend each.

For our main course, my friend and I ordered the 12oz bone-in filet mignon, while my girlfriend had the Chilean Sea Bass. The filet was fantastic and prepared to medium rare perfection! I sampled some of the CSB and enjoyed that immensely as well. For side dishes, we split creamed spinach, asparagus, and macaroni and cheese. The spinach and mac & cheese were particularly out of this world and the asparagus was fresh and delicious, seasoned with some lemon.

We were pretty full after all of that, but some how found a way to muster up the strength for dessert. We decided on splitting the NY Cheesecake and Strawberry Alaskan (basically a strawberry shortcake with ice cream). Let me tell you something...these are enormous desserts! You don't need one per person. One should be enough for a table of 3 or 4 to split. The slice of cheesecake would still have been huge if they cut the sucker in half! Size aside, both desserts were delectable.

Not a fan, the banana tasted weird and grainy.  And it didn't really work together.  The only thing I enjoyed about the dish was the roasted marshmallows on top of the banana which I wiped clean off the plate.  Oh and I ate the vanilla ice cream...I mean you can't really mess that up.

I added an extra star for the dessert that my friends had, I think it was called the Baked Alaskan something...not 100% sure.  But it had the mildly sweetened strawberry glaze and fluffy as a cloud cake with a frosting so light and delicious that you'll think you're eating extra whipped cream.

I ordered the Brooklyn filet, a 12 ounce, bone-in filet.  I ordered it black and blue.  I opted for the loaded baked potato as my server suggested it was more of a single diner option for a side than some of the others which are almost large enough to be shared.  The baker had butter, sour cream, cheese, and bacon.  

For dessert, I got the banana s'mores, a unique dessert of a banana with with some chocolate and toasted miniature marshmallows on top of the baked banana.  With the banana came 3 dishes, one with some extra chocolate bits, one with vanilla ice cream, and one with a sauce of peanut butter with coconut.  There were also some graham crackers to dip or just eat with the other things.

The food was good.  The filet was grilled nicely and done the way I requested.  The dessert was quite creative and something you don't see anywhere else. 

Service was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled promptly, my server came by several times to see if I needed anything, and they passed the dead sweetener packet test with flying colors!

So why 3 stars.  One, they had no bread service.  Really?  At these prices you can't do bread.  I also am not fond of the openness of the restaurant to the casino.  When I'm at a casino steakhouse, I want to be cut off from the sights and sounds of the casino.  Here, I had a view of several flat screens at the blackjack pits and i could see lots of flashing slot lights.  Finally, there really wasn't anything special about the food.  The s'mores dessert was special but the rest was OK.  Hence the 3 stars.  It's not a place to which I'd come back.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,1,3,P4GNjVqZhBYj1WoDOeuDwQ

""Hot Rocks"" - Tasty.  I was a bit worried it'd just be plain sliced beef, and thus just a gimmick, but it was nicely seasoned with ponzu.  Don't cook it too long obviously, otherwise it'll be tough and chewy.

Crispy rock shrimp - Pretty good.  Almost the same as Dynamite Shrimp at Sansei's, or other similar preparations of lightly tempura battered shrimp with a tiny kick.  

Tomahawk ribeye - Surprisingly really delicious.  I honestly  wasn't expecting much, but it was quite nicely salted (on the heavier side, which I prefer), with an excellent char (not too burnt, not too bland).  If I was a tad picky, or Tom Colicchio on Top Chef, I'd note the bone wasn't uber cleaned/Frenched, but still one of the better tasting steaks I've had.  

Ultimate Steak 80oz - only had a piece, which I found a bit on the bland side, as well as a tad chewy (though not from being overcooked).  

Sides (mushrooms, mac & cheese, broccolini) - on the smallish side, but given the size of the beef, sufficient for sharing with ~4 people.  Mac&cheese was a tad rich, though the crust was great.  

Ambiance/service/etc:
The decor is dark and trendy, though there's only a partial wall separating out the main casino floor, which sort of detracts from the ambiance with all the flashing lights and hubub.

Avoid Brand.   Visit Stripsteak, Cut, or Prime instead... 

We arrived at 7:10 for a 7:30 Saturday night reservation.  They weren't busy but we were finally seated at 7:50pm after complaining to the hostess 3 times and finally to a manager.  A gentleman in a suit who seemed to be overseeing the dining room.     
Crowded tables.  We were crammed in a row of two-tops.  We had the pleasure of dining one foot away from 2 other couples.  We wished we had the time to complain like 2 other couples who refused the table beside us.   But we didn't have the time to waste due to issue #1 above and 9:30 Le Reve tickets.  
We were asked to finish our drinks bought at the casino bar ""outside"" before even being allowed into the bar.  At these prices, I wouldn't think that restaurant management should be so concerned about outside beverages.  
Not the quality steak one would expect for $50.  More gristle than every other $50 steak I've had in Vegas - and I've had many.  
Misleading advertising.  The menu board outside the restaurant advertises the ""steak for two"" as including 2 sides, but then they charged us $9 for the second side. 
Not greeted by the waitress until almost 10 minutes after sitting down.  
Bread arrived at table ~10 minutes later...  Bread is served in a cute cast iron pan, to appear warm and enticing.  But don't be fooled, it was stone cold and likely cooked off-site and transferred to cast-iron in the kitchen.",Yt-HMe2KniqEjUKKFDsZ8A,2,0,1,4LxVmSZ_wsDSJsSX95YnmQ

I highly recommend the shrimp cocktail, Caesar Salad, Filet and Lobster Tail Combo...it is awesome, and for a Steakhouse of this quality, very reasonably priced. 

In addition to the food, the wine selection is great and the people watching is fun as well. 

Finally, I have to talk about the staff: they are second to none. From the hostesses, to the manager, to the waitstaff, to the waitstaff assistants, they are fantastic. They each go out of their way to insure that your experience at Brand will be the best you have in Las Vegas.

We got a great spot, our table was all setup. Chris, (manager? owner? not sure) came to our table and congratulated me on the engagement and gave us the special they had which was a 120 oz (thats one-hundred-twenty) porterhouse cured in bacon for 2 days that serves 6. We got 2 of them... and hardly finished one. 

It was absolutely amazing. Take a look at my pictures to see how the final presentation was. The mac and cheese was delicious and easily the best side dish. Followed by the creamed spinach. I think we got asparagus and mashed potatoes too, but at this point we were completely stuffed.

We passed on dessert but a few of us did order some glasses of 28 year old port that was a good ending to a filling meal.

I'm thinking it wasn't that crowded because it's at the Monte Carlo... which isn't that happening of a place. But I will say, I'd rather go here and get quick service for a large group and not have to fight lines and wait times than another steakhouse where I'd be in lines paying double for who knows how good of food. I'm not sure if Brand management would agree though... ha

In summary, food is 5 stars and I'm taking 1 star off for ambience. It just seemed a little dead in there other than us of course. Also, bread & butter or something before-hand would be a nice add... especially since it's a nice steakhouse. Service and food were delicious. And for a really nice steakhouse, I'd say the prices were very reasonable. 

All in all, I'm happy we went here for my bachelor party dinner. It worked out perfectly.",zL8tZdvdx6YPemBBWV3ogw,2,1,4,DEir3HMpziGvd5N0TtTr8Q

Over $12 for a 6 ounce glass of watered down Crown & Coke? Y'all can haul @$$!

As for the lounge itself, it costs $20 per person to enter. Unfortunately we realized that we donated to the cause as there were a lot of couples and not as lively as we had hoped. It's very dark inside. Almost all of the seats were reserved and there were no stools at the bar, so we were forced to stand the entire night. 

Ladies get free drinks throughout the entire night while they charge an arm and a leg to us guys for our drinks so they can recoup some of their lost revenue. Is it fair? No, but I can't blame them for wanting to draw more females to their bar. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as the ratio of guys to gals stayed the same throughout the night.

I've come to the conclusion that I will never have that awesome nightlife experience again like I did when I was living in Japan. The Japanese women are nicer there, not at all stuck up, and always willing to engage in polite conversation. They don't have that ""I think that I'm better than you"" attitude and they treat you as a human being. And the parties don't end there until about 8:00 in the morning!

Appetizers: finger licking lollipop wings were cooked perfectly, flavored perfectly, and had ample meat. Hot rocks was fun and delicious. Colossal crab Louis was tasty with huge lumps. We had a carpaccio, but I could not get it off the plate with my chopsticks; it crumbled apart. The jumbo white shrimp cocktail looked amazing, but it got devoured before I could get a piece.

Main course: I had the Wagyu steak. Per the waiters recommendation I ordered it rare. I did not like it that pink. It was too rubbery. I tried a friends Brooklyn filet. It was amazing. Wonderful flavor.

Side dishes (ala a carte): Mac and cheese was really great. Crunchy cheesy crust with hot creamy noodles. Yum! Loaded backed potatoes were really good. Served whipped in a cast iron skillet. Grilled asparagus and roasted and smoked mushrooms were also delicious.

Dessert: baked Alaska was a nice ending. The cream top tasted of marshmallow, not whipped cream. Kentucky butter cake was also good.

On a side note, I did not like the yellow lighting.

Wait staff was polite and attentive.

4439026,2014-03-12,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"4.75/5 for Brand Steakhouse. To outline the experience, i will say the following:

Service: 5/5, if it wasnt impossible to obtain more than 100% I would gladly give it. My server was SPOT on, and I have a great history serving tables. He clearly understands the value of, ""Silent Service"". Attentive when needed, non intrusive and very helpful. My advise, ask for Robert (gentleman with salt and pepper hair), his demeanor and attitude were a delight.

Appetizer: 5/5: The calamari was AMAZING. Crisp, light, not over or undercooked, with a delicious dipping sauce. PERFECT!

Management: a truly nice addition, i had just finished my appetizer and the manager took my plate and ensured i enjoyed it. Great attitude.

Dinner: 4.75/5: i had the 8oz. Filet (mid-rare) and perfectly cooked, accompanied by the mac n' cheese. First off the steak was MAGNIFIQUE! However, 2 things...

A. The mac n' cheese needs some help, slightly bland, and in need of more seasoning. Sorry Brand, but for my money, the mac 'n cheese at Galagher's in NYNY is superior. 

B. Albeit a small grievance, regarding the two sauces (which were DELICIOUS, by the way), perhaps a better method of delivery is in need. They come in 2 small creamer pourers, which can make for keeping them separate on your plate a small challenge. Perhaps two small accompanying saucers (as recieved for soy sauce with sushi).

Aside from that, dinner was excellent. I left filled and delighted i stopped in. I will definetly bring back friends and co-workers for a nice dinner.

Excellent work Brand!",FJ_NWeeiqFkg-h6nt-aoSA,2,1,4,cZiUJR8_vyPeC1WQWZTFFg

 So the PIC got us tickets to the Jabbawockez and we had to figure out dinner since Gordon ramseys steakhouse was booked for like a damn week :( :( :(  Im still sad about that! Oh well, we knew we wanted to do a steakhouse dinner at least once  during our Vegas stay! So what better place to do it , than the hotel that has both our show and a steakhouse! Cool thing we received, was a 20% discount off our meal  since we were watching the show inside the same hotel. SCORE!
 
  So we made rsvps and got there with no waiting. Service yet again was great. Man im loving Vegas for the service we've been getting! So we scale the menu and we decide to be easy going and not overfilling before the show. We order some cocktails that were tassssssty. I had this cucumber drink with a very plump cherry tomato with it. Very refreshing.  We started with the tuna tartare appetizer and man I wasn't expecting for it to be so garlicky. It was good BUT man you breath on a vampire and they're ghost. The mixture had cashews  as well. I liked the crunch and the crustinis were yum as well. For the main course we did a ribeye split with a lobster tail. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) but lacked some seasoning for real. The lobster tail was the best one I ever had. I loved that they deshelled it and sliced it with this CRACK stuffing stuff under it , Im still thicking about that stuffing under the tail! I could eat two of those! Damn. For dessert we did the strawberry baked alaska. That was aight but then again by this point I was wasted LOL. So can't say to much  on that HAHA.

My husband and I decided on the porter house for two. He would eat the burned parts ( he likes steaks burnt...I am the opposite) and I will eat the red pieces. My cousin was like how can you eat that much steak? My response was easy lol. I love red meat so I have no problem with it. The steak even though it was cooked a little too much for my liking it still tasted good. Since my husband doesn't like seafood I settled for the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. The shrimps were big and plump. I'm glad that they don't try anything fancy with the shrimp like other places . I expect shrimp cocktail to be a certain way and not have like guacamole in it like I have experienced in other places. We also had a loaded baked potato for our side which was also good.

The more expensive steak was dry. Your better off getting the other steak the advertise from 5pm to 6pm. If you order steak it doesn't come with sides you have to order it separate. I told the manager my concern. Might sound dumb to complain about the bread. But at-least offer the bread. He said he would express his concern to the chef. He was to busy looking at the people passing by. He should no concern for my opinion.

4532668,2015-02-28,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Bit of a hidden gem, located directly adjacent to the Monte Carlo's casino floor. Walked 10 steps from the blackjack tables to get there, and I'll admit that even with the recommendation of a friend, I was concerned about the location. But it's definitely worth a try. Presentation of the steak was nice, and the portion was reasonably large for the price. The macaroni and cheese was by far the best I've ever had, even compared to various mid to high-end steakhouses like Morton's. If you really like macaroni and cheese, it may be worth the trip just for that.

The steak was good, but not incredible. I've definitely had better, but you have to rate it on the full package, and I think Brand does a good job, especially given the location (which honestly isn't a bother at all, and the convenience is actually refreshing) and price.

The only thing I would say they drop the ball on are the plates. In a good steakhouse, the plates need to be heated, if not outright hot to the touch. It keeps the meat at a good temperature so your last bites are nearly as good as your first. The steak we got came pre-sliced into mouth-sized morsels, which meant more surface area was touching the air, and cooling the meat down. A hot plate would have mitigated this somewhat, and prevented the final bites from being just lukewarm, which is a bad experience. Not worth asking them to throw a few pieces back on the grill for, but still something that shouldn't be difficult to change. I will admit the last time I went was in July of '14, so this may have been changed since then. I will be going again soon to see.",_g7GcyPvGXUCHoNX_5iLIQ,1,0,4,vmTz3Q8nU9B7IANGhU2nqQ

When we were deciding on a restaurant to check out, one of the criteria was a place that neither of us had tried before. Well, I failed on that. Hence the review update. But that previous visit was just to the lounge to watch The Skooners play. I had never dined at Brand before.

Let it be known that I'm pretty cheap. RW doesn't normally interest me. So with that in mind, I have to give up the five stars to Brand. Everything was excellent (to my admittedly unrefined palate).

1st course: Onion Soup - 24 Hour Caramelized Onion, Four Cheese Gratin
I don't know that I've had a lot of onion soup in my life, but this was a tasty start to the meal, especially since I was recovering from a little cold.

2nd course: Chilean Sea Bass - Lemon Risotto, Rock Shrimp, Lobster Broth
The fish was perfectly flaky. The risotto had great flavor, but wasn't quite perfect. Granted, I just had the best risotto in my life the previous week up in Napa Valley. Still, it was an excellent main course.

3rd course: Grilled Banana Smores - Coconut Peanut Butter Sauce, Vanilla Ice Cream
O. M. G. Each course of this meal just kept one-upping the previous. Talk about a creative and delicious dessert. As Angela H described, it's cracktastic! Think of a grilled whole banana filled with chocolate and topped with marshmallows, and served with graham crackers, peanut butter, more chocolate, and some ice cream. It's truly redonkulous.

Apparently, Brand has a happy hour from 5-7pm. I think our next plan of attack is to check out the HH and just order some more of that grilled banana goodness!",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,2,5,9lLfpTXBcgB273UoSSU8Lw

Out of the group, I was the only one who had gone to Brand before so I recommended a few items to the girls. We had the hot rocks appetizer and calamari, both insanely good.

Review the menu and we are presented with your standard fare of mix of steaks and chops / appetizers salads etc.  Wine list is extremely overpriced but its a steakhouse in casino and we roll with it.  Couple drinks ordered bottles of wine in route we are off to the races.

Couple of wedge salads were cold fresh and good though they needed more dressing and it was promptly delivered. 

Several shrimp cocktail are great looking but to be honest MUSHY and a little fishy and the cocktail sauce was bland with no bite.  Asked for extra lemon, horseradish at time of order yet it never did arrive.  Either way the Shrimp failed. 

Couple of Tuna Tartar's were ordered not my thing but 6 on the 1 to 10 scale from the persons that sampled them.

The ""Ultimate steak"" 40 Oz Portherhouse carved in back not tableside with 1 side and steak sauces was good but lacking any great depth or flavor to the strip or the filet and it was luke warm to cool at serving temperature. This was accompanied by the extra $25.00 stuffed lobster tail.  Well I don't know what this was but it certainly wasn't lobster.  It was  chunks of fish stuffed inside the tail with a ritz cracker bread crumb stuffing. It tasted funky no explanation of what it was but it I've eaten many a Maine Lobster tail and this was NOT IT. 

Two $90.00 stuffed lobsters were absolutely awful.  Same funky lobster taste with the stuffing doing nothing to save these sorry dishes.  

Sides:
Wild mixed roasted mushrooms in oil and garlic were undercooked. 

Mac & Cheese pretty good flavor no complaints here. 

Baked potatoe $10.00 cold and undercooked and certainly not worth 10.00.

Garlic Mashed pretty good.

Broccolini was blah. 

Deserts good especially the donut holes and chocolate dipping sauce.  

Service was OK.. lots of the extras were never brought even though requested during ordering process.  The room must be right next to the broilers in the kitchen as the flame and frying smell permiated through the walls.

All and all a few good things but absolutely totally over priced $1500.00 for 10 people with only 3 small priced bottles of wine and not heavy on the drink orders, makes this place a HORRIBLE VALUE.  Night before we were at Hugo's cellar 10 of us with incredible wine 1k.  No comparison.

Because they can make you amazing vegan food if you ask.  Yes, it's true.  The dirty little secret about REAL chefs is that they know how to make anything, even vegetables, taste good.  

I ate here during the soft opening of the restaurant, with another vegan, a vegetarian, and one omnivore.  The chef (at the time, he has since left... hence only 4 stars), was totally accommodating, and the pastry chef also made us a special vegan dessert.  

I was amazed at the fluidity of the service (especially since the place wasn't actually open yet, from the cocktail servers to the sommelier to our main server.  Everything was perfect.  

The dishes the chef created for us were perfectly seasoned and made the most of highlighting fresh veggies.  The specialty cocktails were terrific as well. 

I will also add the the meat eater at our table looooooved his Kobe carpaccio, tomahawk steak, and all the dairy-laden sides and bread.

4856692,2013-04-09,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Brand is definitely not your father's steakhouse. It's a bit more chill and relaxed given its lounge vibe, which makes it ideal for a first date, a corporate gathering where you need to flit from table to table, or a burned out couple's weekly date night away from the kids.   

The appetizers fit that bill, as they're interesting conversation starters, particularly their Hot Rocks, where you cook thinly sliced pieces of sirloin on rocks heated to what is supposedly 800ºF, which is equal to the average daytime surface of the planet Venus. And you thought Vegas was hot?

We ordered the above as a starter, and I ended up with the 24oz Anton's Tomahawk Rib Eye as my main, which is not as big or as intimidating as it sounds, as it is served bone-in. My first choice was the New York Sirloin, but they had already run out, with only three hours into their dinner service. How does a steakhouse run out of steak in just three hours? 

While I loved salty the exterior crust of the Rib Eye, my medium rare cut took a bit of effort to saw through, to get to the more succulent meaty parts near the bone. It wasn't as tender and buttery as I had hoped it would be, and was just okay. 

Part of my overall dissatisfaction with my dining experience might also be due to our inattentive waiter. We waited a good 10-15 minutes for our menus, and then another 20-25 minutes for him to take our order and put it though to the kitchen, even though the restaurant only had a few other diners there. 

The restaurant opens up to the Monte Carlo casino's floor, which is both a blessing and a curse. While the seating that is further inside offers some people watching opportunities, diligent non-smokers might want to stay away from the seats that line its exterior railing to avoid being hit by wafting clouds of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide from passing smokers.

As I do believe restaurants can have a bad day, and the food did come out fast and hot when the order was finally put in, I may try Brand again sometime, but earlier in the evening, as my first choice would have been the sirloin topped with crab. But for now, Brand failed to impress and sits near the bottom of my best steakhouses in Vegas list, with T-Bones Chophouse and Craftsteak remaining confidently on top.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,2,1,2,owe14Dnq_bmWtMUTDgxGMw

Oh, we also got cocktails, which were tasty. If you get one of those ""2-for-1"" Brand cocktail coupons they pass out on the casino floor, you can use it at your table.

After finishing the steak, we decided to test the limits of how much food our stomachs could hold by getting chocolate cake (at least we split it). Fresh and cakey. Mmm.

I wouldn't say my steak was perfectly medium rare - more like medium - but DAMN it came out fast. We were in and out of the restaurant in just about an hour.

4922377,2015-05-05,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Brand Steakhouse is one of my most favorite restaurants ever!  This place has exquisite food, and equally phenomenal service.  Whether you are celebrating a birthday, anniversary, or just want to treat yourself, this is the place to be.  

The GF and I had $100 Monte Carlo food and beverage credit.  So, we figured we would treat ourselves to the most expensive place there. :) We did not need to make reservations.  It was less than one quarter occupancy when we arrived at 6:30 pm on a weekday. 

We were led by the hostess to a table on the main dining floor.  Unfortunately, there was a big party of drunk people already sitting next to that table.  They were all standing up and clearly intoxicated.  Without us even saying anything, she kindly led us to another table.  A few moments later, we were greeted by our server.  He was extremely nice and welcoming.  He asked us what we wanted to drink ,and briefly talked a little bit about the restaurant.  He definitely exhibited a sense of pride in working there.  Give that man a promotion.  

After spending quite a bit of time looking at the menu and trying to order just enough to slightly exceed the $100 credit line, we finally agreed on six dishes.  Our server tried to play hero and did not write any of this down on a piece of paper.  Sadly, without even realizing it until after we left the restaurant, he would come to forget one of the items.  As an appetizer, the hot rocks were a must.  For the soup, we would try the lobster bisque.  We decided we would get the crispy skin chicken as the entree to share.  We would also get the cream spinach and baked mac and cheese.  Of course, we could not forget the dessert.  We anticipated it would cost $10-15.  

The hot rocks as expected came out first.  The presentation was so simple, yet so sophisticated.  Imagine a bowl filled with one giant stone surrounded by many smaller stones.  Accompanying the pot were the fine pieces of thinly sliced sirloin.  The stone was so hot that in a matter of four seconds of placing the beef on it, it would cook to a perfect medium rare.  The taste was divine, like a happily ever after to a fairy tale.  Keep in mind, this was just the first course!  

Unforunately, the lobster bisque will not be getting any feedback because the order was never put into the system.  Shortly after finishing the hot rocks, the main course and the accompanying two sides arrived all at once.  There was barely enough room on the table to fit all the food!  Our server was kind enough to tell the chef to split the chicken into two portions and present them to us in two separate plates.  The presentation was excellent.  Under the chicken was delicious smoked mash potatoes and fried onions.  I am going to assume that they gave us double portions of mashed potatoes and onions because there was just so much on both of our plates. The chicken was moist and went well with the mashed potatoes and onions.  The sauce was spot on.  Now, we move on to the sides.  The cream spinach was mouth-watering.  The truffle was heavenly, but not overpowering.  The mac and cheese was just average.  I wish there was less cheese and more pasta.  Nonetheless, it made a good companion to the main course.  

Of course, room was made for the dessert.  We decided on the bread pudding.  It came out quickly.  It was full of flavor.  The salted caramel ice cream was a great combination.  It was very good.  We were so full that we could not finish it though.  

All in all, I was very impressed with this fine dining establishment.  Service and food were on point.  The ambiance was amazing and peaceful despite being located in close proximity to the casino floor.  The only pitfall was the forgotten lobster bisque.  However, even that was not enough to lower the number of stars to anything below a five star rating.  I will be back!",RQqfT8WQlmFHmPp9X8G9jA,0,0,5,g56IoR62ZivCeeaun25xtA

The seafood platter is always excellent, as are the oysters.  But, the star here is the steak.  My groups usually get the steak for 2 or 4, depending on how many.

Bottom line, you're paying for beautiful plates of ""contemporary"" cuisine unjustified by the quality of the ingredients.  In other words, want to impress a non foodie, this is your kind of place.

To start, the ""Hot Rocks"" (Japanese style of cooking thin slices of beef on super heated stones), fun but it's USDA choice at best and a chewier sirloin cut.  Not much internal fat, marinated in an acidic ponzu, olive oil mix causes the protein to tighten up even further.   Fun and visually cool but misses the mark. The tuna tartare, much better.  Deconstructed at service, mix everything up to enjoy.  Everyday sushi grade tuna mixed with well toasted pine nuts, crisp Asian pair and some soy with a hint of horseradish on toast points.  Refreshing and texturally interesting.

For mains, no mention is made on the quality or aging of the beef.  It appears to be USDA top choice, not prime.  Steaks are well trimmed.  Cooking temperatures off.  The tomahawk rib eye cooked mid well when ordered mid rare (twice) was OK.  Not as tender as it should be.  Good bitterness from the wood burring grill but lacking intense beef flavor of a well aged piece of beef.  The menu says 24oz but a lot of that weight is the bone.  Maybe 12oz of actual beef.  The bone in Brooklyn fillet is OK.  Cooked to temperature.  The bone, slightly cut away from the beef for looks fails to impart sufficient flavor as dry aged versions of the same cut.  

Pet peeve:  they put a pat of COLD butter on top of the steak.  Am I supposed to rub it around in the beef drippings and make my own sauce?

Correct sides.  No real standouts.

Good happy hour where you can try scaled down versions of the starters for $9.

Good wine list.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Our reservations were for 6pm and the restaurant was pretty empty which was kind of nice actually. We didn't have to yell over a bunch of noise to talk.

We each got a glass of champage, our choice of salad and we all shared entrees which were really delicious. We had hot rocks, shrimp, penne pasta and calamari as well as individual desserts. The food was good and very plenitful. The servers brought out two of each entree, so for six girls we had a ton of food. In addition to celebrating the bride to be, it was also the birthday of one of the girls in our party so I secretly asked our server if she could bring out a little something special for her and she did, which was nice. 

The one negative thing was that hostess tried to seat us in the lounge area for our dinner even though I had the women that set up our dinner put a note that we wanted to sit in the actual dining area. If I wouldn't have said anything the hostess wouldn't have seated us in the correct area as I had arranged. Luckily, as I stated before the restaurant was empty so we got a table anyway.

Overall, the dinner was lovely and I would definitely go back.",OdBdt2-gnbJLcjvyQ-0MZQ,1,1,4,hV8drmT5W0H8dggXk1U7Yg

Wednesdays are 50% wine bottles....and if you are local, you get 20% your entire bottom line...INCLUDING your already 50% discounted wine!!

Ex : Veuve Cliquot ($85). My favorite champagne under $50 (in stores)....On Wednesdays, bottles are half price, and with local's discount, it's an extra 20% off the bottom line, so it only costs around $35!! GREAT deal...since you can't even go to Total Wine for that price most days!

Started off with the Complimentary bread...we had to request it for some reason. It is sweet and slightly sticky...good stuff!

I shared the 24oz Tomahawk Ribeye ($51) and Maine Lobster Tail stuffed with Ritz Crackers ($25). This is THE best non-aged Ribeye I've had so far, and the price was CHEAP! After the 20% off for locals, it's a $40 steak!! 

The lobster was very TENDER and flavorful, and the Ritz Cracker stuffing in the tail was delicious!  One of the most enjoyable tails I've had in town, and for a $20 bill after the discounts :P

For sides, the Cream Spinach ($9) with Boursin Cheese. I love Boursin Cheese, so this was an easy win for me!!  The Mashed Potatoes ($9) with Roasted Garlic as well...good amount of garlic flavor...tasty!  They didn't blow me away, but they are solid choices.

So even at face value, this is a great steakhouse on the strip.  Are there better ones in town?  Absolutely, but considering their very fair prices, AND THEN the Wine Wednesday and Locals discounts, it's a STEAL of a deal!

Once explaining what I had accidentally done the hostess wasn't going to allow us to eat there because they were ""fully booked"" luckily the Manager was there and allowed us to keep our reservation. We waited a while for our waiter to come by they finally brought us water and in about 15 minutes we were able to place our wine order. It was clear to us at this time because we had accidentally cancelled the reservation (15 minutes prior) that we weren't going to receive the same level of service as the others dining near us.

About an hour into dinner I decided I would rather go up to our room because I wasn't feeling well.

At some spots, you may love the steak, but skip dessert, but from start to finish, Brand delivers creative, delectable dishes. It's the complete package.

I had the luck of enjoying the Yelp Spring Break prix fixe, and so unlike my usual meal, I actually had both an appetizer and dessert. I admit I did not have a steak entree, but from the drool rolling out of my husband's mouth as he sliced up his bone-in filet, I am confident they do the steak right.

For an appetizer, I had the hot rock: thinly sliced sirloin brought to the table uncooked with a smoking hot rock that you employ to cook up your meat. Regardless of the taste factor, I just think this is a fun appetizer, perfect for a date.

For my main entree, I ordered the chicken. I know it is a shameful steakhouse choice, but it was perfect: not too thick and served with a dreamy, crispy skin. 

For dessert: Strawberry Baked Alaska. They did not set fire to it tableside, but the sweet strawberry goodness stood on its own without the theatrics. Although I haven't had it, the Grilled Banana Smores Restaurant Week dessert is the stuff of legend, so judging from my experience and the word on the street, Brand is a dessert destination must.

But, I have saved the best for last, as the dish that I am still savoring weeks later is the creamed spinach. Eating your vegetables never tasted so good, and I am a vegetable lover.

Our service was solid, despite a little delay at the end receiving our check.

In conclusion, Brand is particularly well-suited for dates and groups. There is something for everyone, and everything from small plates to dessert is executed with deliciousness.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,27,21,5,Km0S89KlYNxPaueU4NjuVA

After our original dinner reservations at PRIME fell through due to timing, we decided to give the Brand Steakhouse downstairs a try.  Despite many reviews talking about the lack of quality restaurants within the Monte Carlo and they do not recommend this place, I decided to heed the advice of one my co-workers and give the place a try.  We originally made reservations for 6:45 but decided to pop down around 6 to see if anything was available beforehand.  I am glad we did because the place was relatively empty and we were seated immediately which saved us time and allowed us to not rush as much to ensure we made our show on time.  

Our server John was great, real down to earth, helpful in making suggestions and telling us of the specials for the evening and staying on top of everything.  We aren't drinkers so they quickly ushered away our unused wine glasses and our iced teas and water came out quickly.  Being as this was not the intended restaurant I went in with no knowledge of the menu but quickly settled on the 8oz. Filet Mignon (cooked well done) and a loaded baked potato on the side.  Yes; I know, well done and Filet do not go together but I don't like the pink and bloody steaks and am often told my steak more resembles a hockey puck or shoe leather as opposed to actual meat.  Well rest assured, Brand cooked the steak well done and it was still full of flavor and absolute perfect for my liking.  This to me is the surefire sign of a good restaurant, being able to adapt to a customers wishes and still deliver a great product.  I know a few other restaurants who could learn a thing or two from this place.  Both the steak and potato were delicious and quickly devoured.

My wife, who tends to eat much lighter and healthier than I, went with the crispy chicken.  This came sitting atop a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and she seemed to also really enjoy the dish.  We decided to go with the New York Cheesecake with berry compote for dessert.  This was quite a large slice for the price and being as we were sharing it, the size was quite adequate to close out the meal.  The food, service and ambiance were all amazing and for the price this place would be hard to beat on the strip.  For 2 meals, 2 drinks and dessert our bill was $113 bucks and after a generous tip we got out having spent significantly less than we would had if our original plans did not fall through.

I ordered the Tomahawk Rib-eye Medium-Rare-Plus, extra char and was extremely pleased. The bottle of wine we had requested wasn't available so the team offered another that was typically more expensive at the same price and just as delicious.

A group of us went here on a Wednesday night since they were offering 20% off on dinner for locals. We got there earlier than the rest of the group so, we decided to have a few drinks at the bar which was offering 50% off bottles + the 20% locals discount.  We ended up with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot for only $35! Oh my word!

I was debating whether to split a Tomahawk or the 40oz Ultimate Steak with somebody. In the end, I'm glad I listened to his decision - if the 24oz Tomahawk was hard to finish, what more the 40oz steak? The price can't be beat at $51 for a 24oz steak. The quality and flavor of the steak were not compromised though. We also got a lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes and cream spinach.

Anton's Tomahawk Rib Eye:
24oz rib eye cooked medium just the way we like it. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. Careful with the huge bone though. Regular price: $51. 5/5

Maine Lobster Tail:
For an additional $25, you get a nice lobster tail with crushed Ritz crackers. The lobster tail is already split and sliced. 4/5

Cream Spinach:
The Boursin cheese makes a world of difference. This is not your boring cream spinach. Super creamy and delicious. 5/5

At the end of the night, we spent about $140 for steak, a bottle of champagne, 2 sides and a lobster tail. I was so full and completely satisfied. Definitely cheap for what we got. GREAT VALUE!

5323820,2011-08-08,2,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"I hade extremely high hopes for this steak house.  Doing my research for steak houses in Vegas this one always made some of the top list by user reviews.  

Service-  I made a reservation well in advance which was good because we were seated right away.  The server was very kind and knowledgeable about the menu.  She answered all our questions.   She told us the specials up front which was nice.  So overall the service was good.

The food-  To start we had the Hot Rock appetizer.  It is pretty gimmicky but its something you have to do.  They basically bring a rock out that is heated to 900 degrees and you cook thinly sliced sirloin on it for a few seconds.  At 17 bucks its pretty pricey for the 6 thinly sliced pieces of sirloin you get.  The flavor was good but price wise they should have included a little bit more meat or something in addition to it.

For our main dish my wife ordered the kobe short ribs 36 bucks and I ordered the ribeye 49 bucks.  We also shared baked mac and cheese and some parker house rolls (they are not on the menu but I recommend because they are free).

The Kobe Short Ribs are nothing to write home about.  For kobe beef it sure tasted about average.  The meat was actually a little under seasoned for my taste.  

The Baked Mac and Cheese was great.  The crust on the top was very tasty and the cheese not to greasy.  This side was full of flavor no complaints.

The Ribeye steak.   This is where my whole meal got ruined.  Now a ribeye is my absolute favorite cut.  It is supposed to be juicy and melt in your mouth.  I always pick the most marbled cut that I possibly can when I shop for one and I would expect a high end steak house to do the same.  For starters I got my steak medium rare.  It was absolutely burnt on the outside.  All the wonderful fat was crispy and tasted like pure well burnt no if ands or buts about it.  To give them the benefit of the doubt I cut into the middle which was rare but instead of a tender peace of meat my steak knife had trouble cutting it.  It was rubber!  I couldn't get passed the burnt parts to fully enjoy my 49 dollar steak.  I was expecting luxury but it came out no better then something you could get at Denny's.  It ruined my whole dining experience.  The cook must have been having an off day because the table behind us sent back their steaks also.  

Overall for the value I would avoid this place.  There are better steakhouses who take pride in what they serve to their customers.  Just because you charge a fortune does not mean you are good.  

I am giving this place a one star simply because I was expecting something amazing and got all my hopes dashed.

The spices, while good, are the stars here. The fish plays second fiddle. The steak is tender, had a nice crust from the fire and was tender (yup, I said i twice, I was tearing it with my fork.). Also, it tastes like beef. That one is a bit had to explain. I've had many steaks that don't pack the beef punch. This one does.  You get two sauces, their steak sauce, which seems like their version of A1 sauce. You also get a pepper and cream sauce. Hands down, this is the sauce to go with. If you are a fan of mac and cheese, then you must come here. If there is a better mac and cheese anywhere, please let me know. I will drive, fly, swim to there. They use shells and a penko bread crumbs topping, as they bake it on their individual iron skillets. Then dessert came. Take a pound cake cup, line it with fresh sliced strawberries, pour a scoop of strawberry ice cream, cover it with meringue then cook the meringue.... and there you have their baked Alaska. It all goes so well together. Your mouth will thank you, your waist line not so much. Some of my friends had the NY cheese cake. They are the biggest slices of cheesecakes I've ever seen.

Went here last Sunday for dinner, told the hostess we didn't have reservations and she said they were fully booked and we could eat in the bar if we wanted. The place wasn't even half full. We left to smoke and finish our drinks and this time we came back the manager Justin was up front next to her and I said ""I guess we're eating in the bar since we can't get a table."" He asked why I said that and I explained and then he said it would just be a 10-15 minute wait and I should have been informed that instead of not given a choice. 

We order a drink and wait to get seated, which was very quick, not even 10 minutes. Sat down and our female waitress Alex gives us our menus, a couple minutes later comes back and takes our order and that was the last we saw of her until we flagged her down for our check. We didn't know of any specials they had until a couple sat down next to us and we overheard their server Russell tell them. I told Russell I wish he was our server because Alex was horrible. Russell even cleared our table because he noticed how long the plates were sitting there. 

Besides the service, our meal was perfect! My Brooklyn filet was prepared a perfect medium rare with a nice char and flavor to it. Her filet was also a very good medium and tasted great to me, even though she added a little more salt and pepper. The best mac and cheese i've had yet and the creamed spinach was also excellent. 

Bottom line, the food was amazing, the hostess that night was a bitch, our female server Alex should work at a fast food restaurant, Russell cares about his job and is the man and the manager Justin did his job to try and rectify the problem.

It blends with their bar area which is also open walled during the evening but 10:00 it turns into a ""club"" and they close off the walls with glass panels, crank up dance music, and charge outrageous drinks prices for drinks in plastic cups. as well as a cover charge. So the dance music bleeds over to the restaurant and so do the drunks.

This was one of the best meals we've since we moved to vegas  that didn't make me cry from the price and I felt like I got a high quality meal.  Not a bargain but for a strip hotel steak house was very reasonable.  It might have to do with that we didn't eat steak (I wanted to cut down on my saturated fat and my husband didn't want heavy meat), but we were extremely pleased with the quality of the food we had.  

We ordered:

Hot Rocks - meat was marinated perfectly and tasted good quality
Green Salad - One of the best vinaigrette dressings (citrus) on a salad I've ever had, so much that I might go back and ask them for the recipe.  The portion was huge and was great to share.
Seabass with risotto - one of the best fish dishes I have ever had
Penne - lots of real shaved truffles in this, and sauced perfectly

We had originally wanted to try the doughnuts for dessert but we were way too full from the meal.

We had stayed at the Monte Carlo before, and even walked by the place several times, but never had the desire really to eat there. We should have! The food was delicious, and before the meal you get your own little round of dinner rolls in an iron baking dish, and if you know me, you know I'm very fond of bread. 

I had the Chilean Sea Bass, which was cooked perfectly- moist and tender, served on top of creamy risotto, which was, in fact, creamy, and just plain delicious. My bf had the Kobe beef hamburger, which came out on a rectangular plate with a metal cup of fries and a little glass jam jar of ketchup, so it was just cute to look at. Now, I ""don't eat beef"", but the hamburger was good, and I know this because I've stolen many a bites of my bf's burger before.

Then we also added a shrimp cocktail  to share which I think was 17. There was quite a bit of food and it was very well done and even as a togo dinner was amazing. The steak came with some sauces that made it so flavorful. One of the best steaks I have ever had. The lobster was cut for us into to bites which made it easy to devour. Wow it was so good. The shrimp cocktail was also large and fresh and really good too. It made for a very nice ending to our trip here. I wish I could do this every time. I did order loaded mash which they forgot but there was plenty of food otherwise. I also had one drink in the bar which was 19 and customized for me the way I like margaritas.

We shared the dinner for 2 at $99 and WOW! The filet was easily some of the best steak I've ever had! We got the side of baked Mac N Cheese and it was a wonderful compliment, not too ""gouda-ey"" which is always nice. The entire experience was really amazing and made even better by the service. 

The only downside is being literally on the casino floor, a nice glass wall would do nicely; as its a little awkward to see the casino patrons and Taylor Swift music whilst enjoying a decadent steak dinner.

For my birthday dinner, we made a reservation here.

Brand Steakhouse is located within the Monte Carlo hotel and on the same floor as the casino. I know what  you're thinking.. a restaurant surrounded by the casino?

The restaurant itself is 5,000 sq ft with a nice sleek and modern design. The chairs are so comfy! The restaurant setting is elegant and perfect setting for a nice dinner.

We ordered:
Classic Caesar Salad ($14)
8 oz Filet Mignon ($44)
24 oz Anton's Tomahawk Rib Eye ($53)

The bread they give you is so amazing. Delish!

Desserts are $10 and they offer things like chocolate cake, key lime pie, toffee bread pudding, creme burlee, Doughnut ""Munchkin"" holes.

5604303,2009-10-22,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"I was pleasantly surprised since this place was picked solely because it was in the Monte Carlo where we were staying. I came here with a bachelorette party for our last night in Vegas. We had 18 people in the group so I thought there might be some issues from the sheer amount of people. Our waitress did an excellent job answering questions about the menu, giving good wine recommendations, splitting out checks, and making sure we all had an enjoyable dining experience.

First off, this place is smack dab in the middle of the casino floor and the front is open out to the casino. Since we were seated towards the interior of the dining area, I hardly noticed the action out there, but I'd imagine it might be pretty distracting if we were sitting towards the front of the restaurant.

So they bring these delicious little buttery rolls in mini cast iron pots that are so adorable. I could've ate my weight in those rolls! For dinner, I split a Caesar salad and the bone-in rib eye with a friend and the group shared side dishes so we could try a variety of things. The salad was a standard Caesar, nothing to get excited about but that rib eye... the visual aspect alone lets you know this is gonna be a damn good piece of meat. It did not disappoint and especially the meat around the bone was so good. We took turns gnawing on the bone, and this is starting to sound explicit so I'll move on to the sides. I got to try the spinach, asparagus, mashed potatoes, crispy fries and mac n' cheese. They were all fine sides, but beware portions are pretty small. I would say 3 sides should be plenty for 2 people.

I feel like I got a good deal because I split my salad and main entree with someone and I left very full and satisfied. I didn't get to try dessert because we had a cake waiting for the bachelorette in the room but I'm sure it would've been as delicious as the rest of the meal.",qSMFYZ00vskIW3LDsHh0xw,1,0,4,0cWLmxEY7mZQAhLbpvzqMQ

The potatoes were very flavorful and the chicken was good. But my husband was very disappointed in his steak. It was tough and didn't taste very good. I tried it and agree. Incidentally, the steak isn't served with sides. They must be purchased separately.

5731863,2013-01-22,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"The steak is delicious.  Easily in category of the TOP 3 best steaks I've ever had.

""The Ultimate Steak"" platter, 120oz of steak for $250 - DELICIOUS!!!!! -The steak is cut into thin slices for your entire party to enjoy, so you don't have to worry about dividing it up.  We had it medium rare and it came out PERFECT.  Slightly bloody, juicy, and tender.  Just writing this review makes me mouth-water for it!!  

We had a party of 5 guys and 1 girl sharing this and we were all STUFFED w/o any leftovers (keep in mind 3 guys in my party were over 200 lbs).  You can probably get away w/ 7-8 people sharing this monster.  Plus for the price?  $250 seems like a lot but split between 6 people is $40 a head.   Score!!

Sides
Macaroni & Cheese - Above average - The Mac & Cheese is delicious.  It came out baked and was still crunchy (I hate when it's creamy/runny).  Worth it.
Cream Spinach - Average - Wasn't anything memorable, standard spinach.  

Dessert-
NY Style Cheesecake ($10) - Exceptional - This is a delicious dessert!! The cheesecake is rich & thick.  I was amazed w/ every bite I ate.  
Strawberry baked Alaska ($10) - Average.  Don't remember it being any memorable. I'd pass on this.
Grilled Banana Smores ($10) - Below average.  This was ok, but wasn't anything special.  You can buy all the stuff at home for half the price and it'll taste the same.  I'd suggest asking for extra graham crackers tho.

TIPS:
-Bread is complimentary UPON REQUEST.  Ask for bread!  It's delicious too.

My meal choice was the Filet Mignon and it did not disappoint. It was tender, juicy and moist. The sauces they provide we're very flavorful. My husband had the Sea Bass which was very good; it was light and moist and a good portion. He also tasted some of my steak (after my raving about it) and agreed that it was delicious and wanted more of my steak. We also ordered 3 sides: green beans, creamed corn and sautéed mushrooms. Again, these were fabulous. And not that we needed it, we finished it all off with creme brûlée and coffee. It was amazing and I must add that our server, Randall, was very pleasant, attentive and helpful which added to the experience.

This restaurant also seems like it would be fun for a group as they offer a 120 oz steak for 6 people! A table near us has the steak for only 2 and that was impressive.

Brian was our server and he made it his mission to make sure I had everything I could want. He was excellent in making recommendations that would suit our indecisiveness and expedite our experience, as we had a show to be at after wards. He never once seemed annoyed at our ""hot mess"" of a table and we appreciated how our casually dressed friends were still welcomed with open arms. 

I immediately ordered a glass of Silver Oak Cabernet and enjoyed that while Brian pretty much ordered our dinner for us. When I first tasted the mouth watering buffalo wings I knew what kind of experience I was in for. My Ribeye was to die for and the mac-n-cheese was the best I have ever had. I also couldn't believe how incredible the creamed spinach was, considering I can't stand cooked spinach. I ended this incredible adventure with my favorite, Creme Brûlée, and again....perfection.

Look, I'm a bartender of 22 years and I can be a harsh critic, but I can't think of one thing I wasn't pleased with. Brian even said he would split our check 8 ways without even hesitating. Really? I wouldn't have been able to hide my annoyance in that! (We didn't split BTW! Ha!)

5837376,2012-06-01,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"Diane and I enjoyed a dynamite dinner at Brand during Spring Break ordering off a special menu for the occasion.  We knew right away that we had chosen wisely when we bumped into our outstanding and vivacious Vegas CM Misti Y., the very talented Bobby Y., immensely capable Chicago CM Andrea R. and her friendly husband, fantastic Phoenix CM Gabi M., and lovely crackerjack Los Angeles West CM Katie B. seated at an adjoining booth.  The ambiance was nice and classy, with driving jazzy music playing throughout our meal.  The place is sprawling, and it required a hostess to guide me to where my wife was sitting after I dropped her off in front of the Monte Carlo before taking the car to valet parking around the back.  

We started with two fine appetizers: Hot Rocks, that featured very fast cooking of thinly sliced sirloin strips with a Thousand Island type dip that tasted like Louie Dressing, and Ponzu Sauce in olive oil; and The Big Wedge, which consisted of refreshingly cold Iceberg Lettuce, very tasty warm Applewood Smoked Bacon, two Red Onion circles, and small crumbles of Roquefort Cheese mounted on top of the lettuce mesa, and Bleu Cheese Dressing, that I had changed from the normally presented Creamy Ranch Dressing, draped over all.  The salad also had several components laid out on the side, including more bacon and cheese crumbles, more dressing, yellow and red Grape Tomatoes, diced egg yolk, and a very crunchy strip of crouton that when cut yielded nice tasty individual croutons.  When the meat was placed on the steaming and thermally treated rocks, it immediately began to sizzle, and reached medium rare doneness in less than 3 seconds.  I also ordered a Loaded Baked Potato that was prepared perfectly with butter, cheese, chives, and bacon, and its skin rubbed in salt.

My entree of 12 oz. bone in Brooklyn Filet Mignon topped with Maitre d' Butter was cooked just right (again medium rare, as requested) with good Peppercorn Sauce and an excellent Red Wine Worcestershire Sauce.  It just got better near the bone, and came with very good grilled asparagus tips. 

Diane's Chilean Seabass was very good, served beside a tasty Lemon Risotto with Rock Shrimp and Lobster Broth.  The bass was delicate and very good tasting.  But it was barely cooked enough, and could have used just a bit more fire.  Her included side of Baked Mac & Cheese, prepared ""Granny's way,"" was comforting and outstanding in taste and texture.

Diane enjoyed a great New York Style Cheese Cake with a fine but unusual Graham Cracker Crust for dessert that would have come with fresh berries but was nude because she is allergic to berries.  Meanwhile, I enjoyed a fine Strawberry Baked Alaska, complete with Strawberry Ice Cream, meringue, and a moist cakey bottom.  I didn't notice any fresh strawberries as advertised.  But big chunks of frozen strawberries were definitely embedded in the Strawberry Ice Cream.  

I had never sampled a Brooklyn Filet or Strawberry Baked Alaska before.  Both were delicious.  I asked for and checked the regular dinner menu, and our special three-course meals with one included side were slightly less than half price.  Servers were omnipresent, and their service was excellent.  What a terrific deal!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,5,5,IUR7qxWnGBVpkDGZWPciYg

Shouldn't happen in a high end steak hous - reheated steak=bad steak) Filet was nothing special, a bit dry for my taste. Service was good, just not impressed with what we got for $240.",n3uNM1q7zePpXdTX-t9GQQ,0,0,3,sjjIPvfVNdGNdHEkkcftsw

My friends ordered a 6oz fillet which probably came out the best.  Other friend ordered a prime rib, and it looked like a skirt steak.  Nah, way over priced with mid level food.",CerZy20B4Eo0ZlaLoPF5qg,0,0,3,aUcg65YFfnKTbWaFUqZaxg
5950151,2015-01-28,0,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"If I could give more than five stars, I would. Our server, Brian, truly showed us what a great dining experience could be. We ordered the 40oz Porterhouse steak that they are known for. Paired with gnocchi and asparagus. The steak came out perfectly cooked, slightly seared, and displayed neatly on our plate. The gnocchi was slightly crunchy due to being cooked in shallot butter and the asparagus was delightful. Tip: the gnocchi tasted great with the creamy sauce served with the steak. Our drinks, the pear martini (Impearment, I think?), and the passion fruit (mojito-style) drinks were spectacular. And to end the meal, we got the seasonal fruit crisp with salted caramel ice cream. LOVED IT! Our server was attentive and helpful throughout the entire night (our finished plates and glasses didn't stay on our table for more than 5 seconds before he removed them). I am local and worked at Nobu in Caesars, so I know high-end dining experiences. And this one was by far one of the best I've ever had. My mother, who was visiting, had only great things to say. We will definitely be back! Tip for management: if I didn't have to look into the hotel while eating, the ambience wouldn't have been cheapened. If it were top level with a view, I would easily have paid even more for the already amazing food and service. ""Food"" for thought...",fiaClUmPLo5hHDCh5t979w,0,0,5,S2AY8eyPlWyzCR9G1m7ofw

5986770,2011-01-30,1,uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,"I was in Vegas for the first time in about 10 years, and the Monte Carlo was our place of residence.  Arriving at around 8pm and ready for a good meal that could accommodate a group of 8 who didn't feel like venturing out of the hotel, the Brand was a great choice.  Despite waits at most restaurants on a Friday night, its large dining room just off the blackjack tables provided the perfect medium for our evening's start.  

The service was a little slow here, and that was my one reservation about a giving it a five star rating, as the food was wonderful.  It wasn't unattentive once we ordered, but getting our waitress to take the order took some time.  Drinks around began the night, and for me it was a perfectly made gimlet with lime juice, not roses, which was a pleasant surprise.  

We didn't splurge on appetizers but went right for the meals.  My entree was the 18 oz bone-in Veal Porterhouse steak cooked medium rare.  Warm to the core but deliciously pink, this was a fantastic choice.  The well seasoned veal was salty but not over-seasoned.  it was a bit like eating meat candy, and I loved every bite...or, at least most of them.  It's worth saying that this piece, and only say this because it was $50 dish, had a bit more connective tissue around the bone than I would have liked, but I didn't let that ruin the meal.  Still, it was a bit disappointing and was not the signature of a great steak house.

As a side, I ordered the wood grilled asparagus topped with truffle oil.  This too was tasty, but not what I expected.  It was both a bit smaller (very thin rods of asparagus) and a bit soggier than I expected, as though it had sat in the back under a heat lamp after they cooked it.  The flavor was enjoyable, but the experience wasn't what was expected.  

If I were at an outback steakhouse and paying $35 for a steak and side, I would've given this a higher rating. But the cost and the billing made me expect more.  This is a restaurant that had a lot of things going for it, and gave us a relatively enjoyable meal, but wasn't a place I would write home about...but, obviously, a place I had to yelp about.",bIj9V-65IohUp6zB3eiyEQ,1,0,3,mh5ixkAPBk2aVW6nRL_aKA
