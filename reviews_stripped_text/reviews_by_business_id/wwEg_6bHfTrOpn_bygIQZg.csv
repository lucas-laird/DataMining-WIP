You would think you could swing by and grab a pizza after a long 10 hour shift. They are complete unprepared for a dinner rush, and beyond unprofessional. The only employee I saw busting their butt was a older women behind the register. The other younger employees are goofing around in the back. This location is very small and now room for waiting which make things intimate, awkward and allows you to hear the employees in the back not doing there job. There is a very dirty care bear in their drink display as well as the front counter is disgusting. I order a simple cheese and pep pizza, nothing to hard. Although to watch people who came in after me to walk out with the same thing it's infuriating. Seriously Wtf. Severely disappointed!!!",kzfopKfUmjP0HCdPcNDL1A,1,0,1,6SthX-FE-7ZEp-e-qnLjmQ

723234,2016-01-11,1,wwEg_6bHfTrOpn_bygIQZg,"This place sucks balls. The employees suck balls mostly. except for the ONE girl doing her job way in the back and making pizza by herself, as other employees were either on their phone or dancing, you go girl. The point of ordering a PICK UP order is to be able to walk in, pay and take it home, not listen to loud employees argue about football with each other and curse back and forth while they are in the middle of taking my order AGAIN since they obviously don't know how to take orders over a phone, and obviously don't know what customer service is since when I first called in the guy that answered kept saying ""I got chu"" after everything I said , very unprofessional ,No apology when I walked in either, I didn't even get a receipt or an estimated wait time, I gave up twenty minutes later after seeing about 5 other people walk out with their pizza that had walked in after me. Then tried to get convinced to wait a little longer because it was almost ready, HAHA yeah fucking right. This was the last time I will ever walk into this place. If the customer service was better and they were actually doing their jobs. I might have waited , but I'm not giving this location my time or money after this experience. And no stars I only put one because it wouldn't let me post without it :) good luck with this location ! It's a nice spot, too bad the service is horrible.",540jRPuxliI6CnEdb3_rqQ,1,0,1,DX815Lk6xakUowivYFbudQ

So...  If i wanted to wait this long for a pizza, i wouldve spent the extra $$ to get a real quality pizza.

Avoid this place at all cost.

Oh, and they ran out of crazy bread. 

Manager compd our whole dinner. I'll give you an extra star for that.",mlXLPBayYqjbUMmtFrlw4g,1,1,2,FjWldLzIedQ-mHc6JBFS9Q

A big thank you to Baneshia and Joseph for the excellent quality food fresh hot out of the oven, and made just the way I want. Customer service is on point, I wanna personally thank you for being kind friendly and personable and helped me very quickly. Mention I called in my order but it was ready when I got there even sooner. So thank you, keep doing you and god bless you, most Little cesears have went way downhill this one is definitely not one of them!!!

I gave this location multiple chances. The crew takes forever to make pizza. There is never hot n ready pizza ready. Today I had to wait 10 minutes to order my pizza. (Mind you, I was the first one in line with 6 other people waiting behind me). Then after ordering my pizza it took 15 minutes to receive my hot n ready 5$ pizza and bread sticks. 

Last month, I literally had to wait 30 minutes for two hot n readys and wings! This place is horrible! Horrible crew. So rude and unprofessional.",-WkOKCQxbVreEFQLBZex-g,2,0,1,EHxtAyywvvJ-mWEriqkNng
3997843,2017-05-08,1,wwEg_6bHfTrOpn_bygIQZg,This has to be the worse Little Caesars in Las Vegas and the upper Management needs to do a surprise visit to truly see them in action.  The cashier is so unprofessional in action and how she wore her uniform.  The manager is no better b/c he needs to correct these actions but he just watches.  The time of service was super long.  If they keep up this way this store will close down due to lost of business.,C4Q8HL0pDMUTj5ioWeEsjQ,0,1,1,uG1RvPSWAQU_WoWjVxNgog

4763620,2016-06-18,0,wwEg_6bHfTrOpn_bygIQZg,Don't get me wrong I love little Caesars pizza but this particular location is beyond terrible. The staff is extremely unprofessional the pizza is never ready. So that kills the whole hot n ready slogan they have. I watched one of the dough preparers not use any gloves and touch everything in the dang area. I called in ahead of time for one cheese pizza and asked for two jalape√±o cheese sauces and the guy taking my order acted dumb as if he didn't know what that was. He didn't ask for my name or anything. I had to rudely tell him how to do his dang job.,dr33hGEXuoiFi7TZpTijsQ,0,0,1,hFlpzQ7c_wLUIAYIiAD84g

5227776,2017-01-14,3,wwEg_6bHfTrOpn_bygIQZg,"I don't particularly understand why the super low ratings.  I wonder if there's been a staffing or management change recently?

Tuesday, I was craving pizza something fierce on my way home from work, and so my husband asked me to swing by Little Ceasars.  

I walked in, and while they didn't have a Hot n Ready sausage...well...hot and ready, I placed an order and was told it would be about 6 minutes.  I also ordered crazy bread with extra cheese and butter topping.

About 6 minutes later, I had my pizza and crazy bread, and was heading home.

The food was good.  Its pretty standard for a chain like this, but they used a lot of sausage, and the crazy bread was great.

Service itself was polite, but I was a little miffed that I got all the way home only to discover that the young lady who helped me had NOT put a marinara sauce in the bag or box for the crazy bread.  That was upsetting, and honestly, the only reason for 3 stars instead of 4.  

I'll be back again, for sure.

The cashier Adaja Y.
takes my money and tells me it will be a little bit before they are ready. I ask what she means by that since I'm looking at 4 pizzas in the warmer. There are 2 families and 3 other people standing around in the place. She says they are for orders that are taken.  I asked why was everyone  standing around waiting for her to give them their order.No answer. ....she turns around and removes 2 pizzas to give me. First one she scans is over its time limit and she puts it on the bottom shelf of the pizza cutting station .Next she scan 2 more and now I can see there are 4 more pizzas in the warmer. She hands them to me and out the door we go. Get them home and both have to be recut cuz they did not cut one piece of both pizzas through.
