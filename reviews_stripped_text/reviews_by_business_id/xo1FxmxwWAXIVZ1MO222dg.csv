First off, the female bartender (don't think she told me her name, but did say she was new to the establishment) was super sweet,  and provided excellent service. I was shocked that it wasn't very smokey! It was in the afternoon and there was only one other patron, so perhaps when it gets busier it would be, but it was just fine then.

Started off with fried cheese curds, that were awesome! They come with a Dijon- type mustard dipping sauce, which I didn't care for, so i asked for ranch. Their ranch is delicious!! Tastes like they make it from scratch. My friend ordered a Philly cheese steak and tater tots. I tried the tater tots and they were yummy. I ordered a Mediterranean salad, (I'm a vegetarian). Salad was a good size and was delicious! Very fresh, with just the right amount of dressing. Pretty decent prices for everything.  As with most gaming bars, there is a separate server for the food. She was great. Definitely will return, and highly recommend!!",u2kUEnt88S7iumV-3Vdmbg,1,0,5,a3vziBG59iWoPHGw6joC2w

The vicarious recommendation led us to this watering hole, where the food was apparently delicious. I thank whomever that young Las Vegan was because he was right and Rounders absolutely did not disappoint.

We started with the lobster quesadillas and wings...one word--YUM!! For the entrees we ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was seriously the best one I've ever had! Also had the Asian chicken salad, which was OK, but then again, who orders salad at a bar? Won't make that mistake again when I come back. 

We were the only ones sitting in the dining area (since everyone else is at the bar), but it was a welcomed silence considering we had just driven into town that morning and just needed some good food with no distractions.So glad to have found an excellent place to chow down without making the tiring trip down the Strip.

1884898,2014-01-22,1,xo1FxmxwWAXIVZ1MO222dg,"Graveyard Male Bartender is a Thief:  

I was playing a video poker machine and left my money in it while I was sitting at a pub table chatting with my friend. They usually put a reserved sign on a machine when you step away from it but I was just a few feet away.   I could see the machine from where I was sitting w/ my friend. It was actually kind of slow and not busy at all.  The bar tenders did a shift change...the girl (long dark hair) leaving kissed the guy coming on to the next shift so I figured it was her boyfriend and that she told him what we were drinking and that we were playing that machine. (It was the low handicapped machine so it's not along the bar top with the rest of the machines) 10 minutes later a young guy walked up, quickly played a few hands, and hit ""cash out"" I jumped up and said ""what are you doing, that's my money!?""  

This is amateur hour and I knew exactly what was going on.  The bartender and patron thought someone left the money behind and they were going to split the cash.  I confronted the guy that hit the cash out button on my machine.  The great thing is when the idiot bartender ran over he said ""Yup, it had $83.50 on it when he started and he played it down to $80."" SInce when does a bartender know down to the cent what amount a machine had on it before and after a few hands of poker play?? He admitted his guilt right there.

Long story short the patron felt bad and ended up telling me that he and the bartender were going to split it.  The patron had to cash it out and was going to give $40 to the bartender that's why he played it down to $80 even. I was beyond furious that the bartender thought this was a good idea.  I was sitting right there and he was to lazy and stupid to ask if either of us were playing that machine? They planned to take something that didn't belong to them and they got caught doing it.  The bartender sheepishly retreated when the some-what drunk guy told me that I was correct and they were indeed going to share the cash.  I can see a patron taking a cheap shot at some quick cash but didn't expect it from the bartender here. 

I was sitting right there the whole time.  You could have just asked if we were playing the machine and saved yourself the embarrassment.  I asked the guy "" if you would have hit a Royal Flush...then what?"" He said he would have given me one third...yeah right, it was all my money to begin with, loser!  

I probably should have called the Gaming Control Board to tell them that a sneaky bartender tried to steal my money out of a machine.  He is supposed to be there for the patrons to sling some drinks and payout slot wins---not rob them!!

2388738,2013-03-27,0,xo1FxmxwWAXIVZ1MO222dg,"Rounders is a bar that serves food and drinks 24/7. It was one of those places that I'd always passed but never thought of going into.  I don't know why I ever thought I wouldn't like this place but I am definitely a fan of Rounders.  Actually a non-yelper convinced me to go cause their wings are suppose to be great.  So why not I had to try them.

My first time there I order 6 wings while everyone else order 12.   I thought about the 6 wings not being enough but when they came out I was satisfied with the size.  They are pretty meaty wings in comparison to those wing places, not double the size but definitely larger.  You can sauce them like other wing places too, BBQ, mild, hot, etc.  If your looking for a food challenging they have their Atomic wing challenge I don't remember the rules or details but if you're successful you get your picture on the wall.  I asked the hot female bartender there about how hot the wings were.  I think she said stupid hot then put a jacket on.  It's probably the way I asked and what I was doing, I don't even know but she covered up. Usually I'm cool with hot I've don't some insanely hot wings before, back in the day.  When I tasted their firecracker wings, which isn't their hottest, it was nice and delicious tasting but it had a spicy after taste which was making me sweat, I wasn't expecting much heat but it had some. Maybe I won't do the challenge and just ask for 1 wing dipped in their hottest sauce and see if I can do that first.

The K.C. Burger is another item I tried it was a monster of a burger and very tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rounders-las-vegas-2?select=kvMiLVGbvDHK2ugy6dQbvQ#20dvj-huFQxX6dOWmpCGSQ It was a juicy 1/2 lbs burger perfectly cooked with bacon, tasty BBQ sauce, cheese, and onion ring The bun was pretty cool.  It was about $10 with onion rings substitute over fries. I would eat it again.

They have these fried shrimps and jalapenos sides with their dipping sauce another delicious offering.  Really enjoyed the dipping sauce and shrimps. I like the rest of the menu, would mine trying more.

They have an sweet happy hour at least its still running when I get off at 1:30 am.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rounders-las-vegas-2?select=kvMiLVGbvDHK2ugy6dQbvQ#5_z0YjXBCJCo7e05B3W94g  The HH is from 2 pm- 7 pm and 12 am - 3 am and includes 50% off apps, $2 drafts, $3 wells, $4 wine, and $5 you name it martinis.  They have an awesome selection of beer.

So why did it take me so long to try Rounders!? Probably because there aren't a lot of yelpers living in the area or a lot of yelpers reviewing them, they are good. Great friendly service, atmosphere, and interior. I'll be here on a weekly basis.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,3,2,4,ZDT2BjgGTEun0qHZV9xjmg

The parfait was great but the ratio of granola to yogurt was off (too much granola!).

The service was great (there were only 2 other people in there gambling and drinking). Bartender was very attentive and friendly. What minused a star was just the fact that it wasn't a true restaurant experience. I don't care to eat my meal in a bar with people smoking nearby.

Well today I went for an early morning drink. And as usual I play music via their touch tunes. I always play a good mix rap, rock, country and of course some good ole Mexican music ie Selena and Elvis Crespo. Nothing crazy like I said a good mix of music and no one has ever complained. Well today I played a nice popular Selena song and about halfway in the owner Ed walks over to me (obviously the only Hispanic customer there) and asks me if I had picked this song. Awkward I go well yes I did why is there a problem. Ed tells me well I just wanted to make sure someone paid for this and it is not a random song, usually we skip music like this. As my jaw drops I ask why. Well Mr. Donald Sterling tells me well it's early in the morning and I don't want people to get uncomfortable  it's almost like playing hardcore rap music with a bunch of F bombs no one wants to hear that. Whoa whoa whoa it's an open juke box and if you don't want certain types of music played then block it. Simple as that. So I tell him to give me my money back and he can skip the song. Ed tells me no that's ok he will let me play my song this time. And I could already see who had complained as an older woman and her maybe mother or friend had a sour look on their face as they were staring at me. Well my response to all of that was hello you are at a bar before noon and there are no listed guidelines on what music to play. So I will take my money somewhere else where my brownness will not offend anyone.

I understand bartenders don't necessarily have to do that so I appreciated it. 
My friend got some chicken fingers to go and they smelled so amazing! The only downfall of this place is it felt kinda dark and dingy. I feel like we have so many nice brand new bars within 10 minutes of this place, despite the good service and food it just didn't stand out to me and I felt the atmosphere all around was kind of lacking.

Rounders is a amazing bar with amazing food! They also have a separate dining room but the smoke can waft over so if your freaked out about that then don't come here. Every time I ask my kid (who's 6 now) where she wants to go for dinner she says Rounders...

The staff is great no matter how busy they are they try their hardest to make sure it is perfect. My husband and I have been going to rounders for about 15 years now... For gambling and drinking only. When we had a child it got hard trying to find places that we could have a sit-down dinner and practice with her manners. This became the automatic favorite instead of the typical McDonald's or other fast food option for a small child.

When it is just my husband and I we enjoy going to the bar playing keno and getting appetizers and our drink on!!!! Porter and Sasha are amazing bartenders who always try to work the entire bar making sure everyone is happy.

As far as the restaurant goes, the staff is  is over flow from the bar. Don't forget to be patient with them as they are still serving food for the entire place.  Being regulars they always treat us amazing. 

As far as the menu goes they have everything from apps specials for the day and a really good chef who continues 2 add something extra special every couple months to change it up. Lastly don't forget about the happy hour specials which are awesome.

In general, I can be really iffy about eating bar food, but they do a great job. My favorites have been the turkey burger and the grilled chicken sandwich. I recommend getting them with the pretzel bread, which is amazing.

The chicken fingers were an old favorite of mine. The fries are really good. And the warm homemade chips and the dip they give you with it are amazing. And just recently I tried the steak and cheese quesadilla for half price during happy hour, and it was bomb dot com!

Furthermore, I am a fan of craft beer. I like that they have a good selection of craft beer bottles. I do prefer draught beer, but the bottle selection they have appeals to me more than their draught selection, and I like that I have that option.

So, i decided to go in & order something to go. I got the ahi tuna wraps & sliders, to go. I was really surprised how awesome & fresh everything was. Great portions, not greasy bar food at all. So, tonight when I just  couldn't  decide what I was hungry for, my memory went back to my first experience.  Uh, so round II not so good. Straight away, I call & say:  ""Hi, I have an order for pickup.""   Douche bartender : ""You mean you'd like to place an order to pick up?"".  Ok, I didn't know that this was for a fucking grade but whatever, so I say  ""Uh, yeah .""   So, long story short, I order the ahi tuna wraps that I so loved the first time around, and the Texas rock shrimp & jalapeños w/drambuie dipping sauce.  When I open the box, I got lettuce cups brimming with a shitload of minced water chestnuts & scant few strips of completely unseasoned ahi. Very sad. My Texas rock gulf shrimp looked more like dried up microscopic sea monkeys, with watery ass mustard sauce. Oh, and my husband got the KC Burger which he found to be average. Grand total for a jerkoff to correct my diction, sub par shrimp, and lettuce cup ""filler"" = 32.96  All and all, from the difference in my experiences, I'd say that it's highly likely that management has changed, and gone straight to the business of cutting corners via food quality, & experienced kitchen staff.

3591790,2013-10-23,3,xo1FxmxwWAXIVZ1MO222dg,"Rounders is another one of those bars in Vegas with better than the environment food and cheap drinks. They have a nice seating area around the bar with big comfy chairs which is a big plus.

On the minus, the environment itself is a little mediocre at times. We literally had a catfight between two women bust out here where the bartenders and such did little to react and service can be a little slow at times. You can't really fault a business for the actions of the customers, but I think an attentive staff would have noticed these women were too drunk and screaming at each other for quite a while.

As for the food in particular, I've had probably 8-10 different things here and most of them are tasty. For example, the lobster quesadilla has big chunks of ""lobster,"" but it does taste like lobster at least. The steak quesadilla is really good, and my favorite might even be the chili cheese dog. One thing that didn't come out that well was the mini hot dogs. Scooter's version is 10x better. The sliders are average, but the wings are pretty good.

Best of all though is that nearly half the time it seems like they have a happy hour going. All football games and like 2-7pm and 12-3am are happy hours, and all the food above costs around 4-5 dollars when it's half off. It's an absolute steal!",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,5,4,4,AD7Sq9sp5hgYd7MWFl7OMA

So, speaking of Burgers. Rounders actually makes the only Turkey Burger I've ever been able to eat in my entire life. I've tried them nearly everywhere and I can only eat Rounders. The appetizers are awesome especially during Happy Hours everyday and the dinners and side dishes are great. Since I live around the corner it's like a home away from home even though I'm not a big drinker or gaming person. Yes, of course there are more upscale options which would be considerably more expensive but when comparing pubs to pubs this place is tough to beat. 
The head bartender/Mgr... Porter is not only a warm, welcoming gentleman but he engages the customers in good conversation. The rest of the bar staff....Laura, Gurley, Rebecca, Ava and the others are awesome and attentive as well. You won't ever wait for a drink!!  The other great thing is that you can eat quietly in the restaurant and non smoking section or eat at the bar which I usually do and or take out service.  You can watch the games from either spot in the pub. The waitress staff are incredibly friendly, funny, always smiling and provide great service. I'm only sorry that I don't know all of their names at this moment but I do know every face....:)  And yes...they are all pretty...There you go, I said it and why would reviewers not mention a great looking staff.   
I see some complaints here that I've never ever experienced in 4 years so it could've been just a bad night for whoever served you as nobody is perfect in this world and we all have bad nights once in a while.

Now I like 70s music but not the whole night. The bartender did say she would comp our bill but when she started skipping all my music I was pissed especially when that guy started talking crap. Called the manager the next day to file a complaint, he told me that they had problems of bartenders favoring certain customers and she should of written the songs down, let it play and delete the song later. The manager said he would remove the juke box since it was causing him too many problems. I never went back since that night due to that issue never really being resolved.

Perhaps they don't like men who come in alone. I'd be better off sitting in the restaurant section so I could at least be waited on, but I prefer to sit at the bar when I'm solo.

I honestly got better conversation from the server than the bar staff. They also won't add food to your bar tab! You have to pay 2 separate bills in this place if you order food at the bar! What a hassle.

Not a lot of people under 45 hang out here so forget about hooking up with anybody decent. Just a bunch of frumpy baby boomers. It kinda reminds me of Tommy Rockers near the strip.

We have only been a few times now but I am addicted to the Tuna Crisps and if you go on monday when there is a game going on, you can get half price appetizers. I believe you can also get them from 3-7pm happy hour as well (still doing my research on that as I have to find out when I can get the crisps at the best price so I can have more than one order :-)) Additionally Cory usually serves us at the bar and he remembers our drinks each time. The drinks are also reasonably priced during these times as well.
If you play the games at the bar (and in some instances you have to to sit there) bet 4 at a time and the bar will keep you from getting parched.
It definitely gets crowded on the nights there are games on and if you dont sit at the bar it could take a minute to get a waitress over to take your order, but a trick we use is that we go to the bar and order our drinks and take them over to where we want to sit (big cushy chairs by the telly) and Cory usually asks if we want food.

4913463,2017-03-20,0,xo1FxmxwWAXIVZ1MO222dg,"No longer my favorite tavern in the Mountains Edge area.  They've had a problem for quite some time.  The problem is long waits to be served in the main dining area.  Sometimes this is caused by heavy business in the bar area, but many times it's caused by the wait staff being in the back and forgetting to check the front for customers.  

Yesterday morning was the worst.  When I came in I could tell the bartender saw me enter.  I was alone in the dining room at the time (it was after the time when the dining area opens).  I sat and waited, and waited and waited.  A couple came in and waited, and waited, and waited.  A man who is either the chef or the manager came in from the bar area.  He obviously has no peripheral vision because he didn't notice either set of customers.  I guess I could have screamed or thrown something at him to get his attention, but it's his (and the rest of the staff's) job to notice customers, not for the customers to be noticed.

So he walked by and started having a personal conversation with the waitress in the back.  Both the other couple and I could hear it.  The phrase ""Hey, you have customers waiting to see menus and give their orders"" was not uttered during the conversation.  The other couple left, yelling ""Bye!""  I thought ""what a good idea"" and started to leave too.  Just then the man and waitress came out, but it was too late.  I informed them that they lost my business and other business due to the overly long wait.

I ended up eating at The Lodge on Shelbourne.",8YaFdh5fGg-M6KPIHv7ivw,0,0,1,ojqW4nPTaiJ0NMWePA_Y9w

Each time I return I kick myself for having been gone so long; 

I really have to give two reviews for this place; the first is for the restaurant; great food; great portions. I love their walleye plate; great fresh fish and flavor; the sauce they serve with it is great; the side dishes and vegetables compliment the flavors elegantly; it's almost like they knew what they were doing  the service can be a little slow to notice you at first but once they realize you are there they are friendly; prompted and always willing to answer questions. Oh and you will absolutely love the Lobster Quesadilla. I can't come here without ordering one.  

I've mentioned before in my reviews that I love hot wings; these guys have by far the hottest wings I've ever had and I've done the triple nuclear at BWW and a few other crazy hot local restaurants where I had to sign a waiver promising not to sue. Not sure how they get away without a wavier but if you are bold enough I recommend you give them a try. 

On the bar side of things; you can still order from the full menu but have to deal with the smokiness of the bar; I like showing up for their many themed parties (Redneck New Years was a blast!) they are always running some type of special even if it's not ""happy hour"" I really think they have happy hour 3-4 times a day here.
