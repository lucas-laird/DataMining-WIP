20185,2014-08-13,0,eqRYda9F_4ziinRW-N6ixw,Go to robertos all the time and like this location so decided to give a good review. Its located inside the litle mini mart. Whenever I go the employees are always very nice and patient with me seeing as how I useually order about $30 worth of food off memory(dang my forgetfullness i.e. list) My order has never been once wrong which is very important due to hypersensitive eater towards onions in my family. So definately stop in if your craving some good tacos and the churros are worth a try :),brpQYqvKKbIr29J0_rcrgA,0,0,5,9Sks6jrQLT_VwtwRg83VZw

They want a 1.50 more for lettuce and 1.50 more for cheese???? I know that normally a taco comes with at least cheese and lettuce. On top of that the lady was wonderful but the rice was still uncooked.... I've always loved this location but lately they've gone to the way side and I'm not to sure I'll be back.. This would be the second time I have received uncooked crunchy rice. The 2 stars is for the service and quality in meat....,_em750NBrW-Ihc6F-jqFOg,2,0,2,U4ZqQwx0K669puE774quzA

He ordered the rolled beef tacos, I ordered the steak tostada. When we got our food & started eating I noticed that more than 50% or more of my meat was way under cooked, & mostly all fatty tendens stuck together in one huge ball. Other customers enjoying their meals next to me noticed me holding it in the air, they we're disgusted as well. It was as if I had got the end of the scraps bag. I took it back up to the counter & explained how I couldn't eat it & asked if it was possible to trade in what I had for 1 rolled beef taco. No not 1 order of the tacos...just 1 small rolled beef taco. The chick at the windows body language was as if I had offended her & everyone she worked with. She told me no & that the beef would be the exact same even tho I knew better considering my boyfriends food was just fine. So I asked for my money back & she wouldn't even do that. So in the end I paid for something I didn't get to eat & almost threw up from the disgusting overload of tendens & fat. I'll never go here again, which in turn looses business for the shell.

In the interest of full disclosure, I will state that the Great Bearded Bird is allergic to avocado is all its forms.

I've ordered the carne asada nachos numerous times (specifically ordered WITHOUT guacamole), the shrimp cocktail a few times (also without caterpillar guts in any form), and the flautas/rolled tacos/whatever they call them a couple of times.  Never any complaints.  Super-duper-classy?  No.  Decent food at a decent price?  Definitely.  The condiment bar is a nice touch (I do tend to eat the carrots in escabeche, and the scallions).  And, if you aren't in the mood for a standard fountain soda, you can grab a can or bottle from the gas station convenience store that's in the same building.

I've been back, and unless something quite untoward happens, will continue to do so.

2688634,2015-05-07,0,eqRYda9F_4ziinRW-N6ixw,"I just had the most unpleasant experience at this location. I ordered the carne asade QUESEDILLA, and was given the carne asade fries at the drive thru. When I realized it was the fries, I waited for someone to come back to the window with no luck. So I parked and went inside to get it fixed. I stood at the counter for a couple minutes before someone decided to finally come to the counter to help me. On top of already waiting far too long to be assisted, the lady that helped me was so unbelievably rude to me. I told her the situation and from the get go, she started arguing with me telling me that I ordered the fries. I have never ordered the carne asade fries in my life and was actually ordering for a co-worker straight from the order she wrote down for me. So I KNOW I ordered the quesadilla. The lady kept blaming me and telling me it was my fault. At this point, I was furious but didn't want to cause a scene. So I stood there quietly while they made the quesadilla and decided to check the prices of both items and noticed the fries are more expensive than the quesadilla. Typically, I am the type of person to just shrug it off and not worry about the price difference. However, when she handed me the food with attitude and immediately walked away without offering any type of compensation for the price difference, I decided I had enough of being treated like crap and wanted my money back.  As she was walking away, I had to grab her attention again and she was NOT pleased. I explained to her the price difference and immediately she threw her hands in the air and said again ""it's not my fault you said fries"". I was so baffled that someone would treat a customer so badly no matter whose fault it was that the order was wrong. No matter who is at fault, I came in here calmly to get the issue fixed. I did not deserve to be treated the way she was treating me.  She then said something to one of her co-workers (which she had likely been talking badly about me the whole time- too bad I don't understand Spanish). He told her the price difference between the items and she opened the register and basically threw a dollar at me and said ""Here"". Mind you, the price difference is $1.15 and I was charged the tax on the more expensive item. Again, I normally blow this kind of thing off especially because it really wasn't a big price difference. However, no customer should EVER be treated the way I was treated no matter who was at fault for the order being wrong. At this point, I only wish I would have made a bigger scene and demanded a full refund and ate somewhere else.",psn6mExIajFyif-QL4y5QA,4,0,1,F8-V2k6JmV295pXqShGniw

Now, on to this specific Roberto's.  This is the third location that I have tried so far and this one is by FAR the worst; and this is coming after a couple pitchers with the munchies raging!  I ordered the rolled tacos with gauc which tasted just like the other 2, hence why they got 1 of the stars.  The other star is because the food was served very quickly, but alas, I believe this is why my second dish was not great.  

I got the cheese enchilada meal.  The sauce tasted okay, but the main problem was the cheese was not even melted inside, just a bunch of shredded cheese that I did not enjoy inside my luke-warm enchilada.  My friend also ordered our 'GO TO' meal, chimichanga, mmm mmm mmm; however, at this Roberto's it was bleh bleh bleh!  The tortilla was not fried nearly enough, the chicken was wet, not moist, wet, and overall it was barely even warm.

However, there are times where I wait at the speaker and wonder if it's broken as no one asks to take the order and no one is in front of me in the drive thru at least.  So, that has lead to driving off as I have to get to work.  Also MOST times, I don't get the salsa I asked for (I get the wrong kind) - being the drive through, I don't have access to the salsa bar.  This is frustrating as it obviously effects the taste and flavor expectations.

The food is just like any other Roberto's Taco Shop which is wonderfully greasy, cheesy, and delicious.  Great hangover food.",7QXtasoVTQJuEjbmbLsDGA,0,0,4,P8oO5DFrmh193_O-s4cOaQ

 They like on the gauc and cheese, and never over cook. I hate it when the tortillas are darker brown, haven't had one yet like that here.
 My new go to Roberto's. Ps tip them, they appreciate it, and the gauc glows even freer. :)",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,5,5,4,9Wt5K_1WmeXRUN2AxgoAyQ

I couldn't help but laugh when I realized that they also sell buffalo wings and fries, and there was a family sitting next to us that had ordered it.

They have a stainless steel cart next to the cashier with pickled carrots and cucumbers, salsas, and whole strips of green onion.  The trays were kind of empty when I went, which was around lunchtime on a weekend.

Carne asada fries or nachos.  That is all.",7Q_qeyO8qA71sM5pao8Fbw,0,0,4,OTqkTeYWvp-eJ38rwPLXcg

There's a billion of these types of Mexican food places in San Diego: Adalberto's, Himiberto's, Wookieeberto's, Ernie and Berto's....

Okay, so the last two I made up, but there's still a billion Berto's variants in San Diego.

""But what about my experience in Vegas"", you ask?  I'm getting to that.  After a night of drinking, I stopped by Roberto's in the Sinclair gas station.

It's the same stuff.  The same blessed stuff as I'd find in San Diego.  And the rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole are just as good.

So is this food merely tasty only with the extra alcoholic kick?  I couldn't help myself.  After being reminded about how enjoyable the flavor was, I went back without drinkage, and still just as good.

The food is value priced, tasty, and consistently dependable, right down to the little salsa bar.  It's not gas station fare.  It just happens to be located inside the gas station.  Don't let the setting scare you off.

It's not life changing, but it is good fast food, and a nice continuations of one of my old late-night traditions that has carried over to my new hometown.

But after a late night of socializing, there's not much better that hits the spot.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,3,1,5,zUpA-IOnVc8PRvSNL8LkYw

The food is great, but the place itself is really old, and ghetto looking, so I usually take my food to go. They are open 24 hours, which is a huge plus, but their menu is limited late at night.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,2,1,4,0XCE1kKn8fLpO_grDRGOLg
5657913,2011-07-12,0,eqRYda9F_4ziinRW-N6ixw,"Pretty cool little spot hidden in a gas station. I've once had their burrito here and it was average. What I did get when I was just here recently was the rolled tacos aka taquitos. Those weren't that great I think I should of stuck to the burritos or have gotta the street tacos. My meal came with beans and rice which again weren't that great. I'd rather of gotten beans and rice at another spot, but hey it did to the job of filling me up especially in the middle of the night. I'd still come back here for more rather than going to Taco Bell. Price here isn't as cheap as a normal fast food place like Taco Bell or Del Taco, that's because it's not really considered fast food. Open 24 hours with better burritos, would get me here rather than Taco Bell, unless I'm on a budget.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,0,0,3,2LKRaAdSSx8lUaMOL3iPuQ

However the rolled tacos had no flavor at all. The meat & guacamole had no taste, the beans it came with didn't have any flavor either. The only thing that tasted decent was the rice. Even the hot sauce was tasteless. I really wanted to like this place but my food was too disappointing. Unfortunately, next time I'll have to stick with my original plan of going to Del Taco, haha.",raFyVr7n3DtJ0oRG3H244A,1,0,2,iSQBEX5RbZjp3kNJQ3xu8g
