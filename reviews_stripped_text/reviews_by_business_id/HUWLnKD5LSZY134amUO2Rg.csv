120066,2011-12-16,0,HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg,"1 star = Terrible. Multiple things went wrong. Never going back.
2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful.
3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back.
4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here.
5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.

I am a bit surprised at all the 5-star ratings. Maybe I am a pizza snob. This place was fine, but nothing to write home about. Mark Rich's II in Summerlin pwns this place. Words like authentic, NYC, etc. seem, to me, to be a bit of a reach.

Everything was ok. We ordered mozz sticks, friend mushrooms, a medium pizza and 2 cokes (Pepsi, bleck). The apps were good and the pizza sauce they served for dipping was good too. The pizza was blah. The sauce didnt have a lot of flavor and there wasnt much cheese on the pie. Toppings were sparse, which would have been fine with better sauce and higher quality cheese.

The people were really really nice, but our waitress came in from a smoke break, headed right to the kitchen and brought us out our food. Ew. Also, we paid over $40 bucks with tip for the items listed above - 2 sodas, 2 apps, and a medium pizza.

One other thing: the decor is really run down. That didnt bother me -- I like hole in the wall places -- but just FYI.

We scrolled through the pics and drooled over how good the garlic knots looked and someone's specialty order of Sicilian pizza. We were sold. We showed up and the man behind the counter knew we were first timers and told us to have a seat anywhere, he took our drink order and asked if we wanted garlic knots while we looked over the menu. It was as if he read our minds. We also ordered the specialty pizza that we saw on Yelp, Sicilian pizza with spinach, mozz, meatball, & ricotta. First off the knots, holy smokes were they delicious! They were accompanied by piping hot homemade marinara that complimented the knots so perfectly. Next, the Sicilian pizza. As it made its way to the table it was admired by all, everyone in the joint couldn't take their eyes off it. As we stuffed our faces, patrons came to our table to ask what kind of pizza we had. Not only did it look good, it tasted phenomenal. The crust was thick and held the toppings well, the cheese was stringy and delicious, the meatballs, ricotta, and spinach madonna mi! My mouth is watering as I write. To top it off, our waiter hooked us up with complimentary cannolis since it was our first time. The shell crunchy, the filling not too sweet and complimented with chocolate chips, the powdered sugar covered my lips like Tony Montana in Scarface.

I've had this pizza as take out and it's just not as good as when it comes straight out of the oven. 

They have very garlicky garlic knots. This last time they were a little undercooked but still delicious. 

The Greek salad was delicious. It may be better called the feta cheese salad because it had so much cheese on it. I could have used probably half the cheese and more lettuce. Unlike most places that give you mostly lettuce and scarce topping this place gives you lots of olives, cucumbers, tomatoes and mounds of cheese.

We then went to the register to pay and explained it to a very nice lady and she was very apologetic and said what he did was not right. 

We returned for a second time only for the server to act smug towards us, drop slices and waters off...never refilling our waters or asking if we needed anything else, and then dropped the check off saying ""make sure you look it over carefully"".

I ordered the chicken susan for delivery. (Chicken, broccoli, fetticini, and cream sauce) Its pretty good. It took exactly 50 mins for it to get here. But my expected time was 60 mins. So its okay. Everything was super wrapped in foil. My tin plate, my cup of marinara sauce, my garlic twists, my garlic bread. Everything!!  Which was greatly appriciated because i saw a review saying they recieved their pasta cold. (Maybe they took note and tried to fix their mistake) Everything was nice and hot!! The sauce needed a little salt but iv always felt that way about every cream sauce iv tried. But OMG the broccoli is perfect!! A little buttery. Not too much. Yummy! The pasta comes with a side salad.. but they forgot mine :( I forgave them because most places you have to pay for a side salad. And they also include a pretty big slice of garlic bread :) yum!! I wasnt even expecting it! I also ordered the garlic twist. Pretty good. But if you like your bread with ranch instead of marinara sauce be sure to let them know. My only complaint about the actual food is.. I wish they grilled the chicken instead of boiled it. Its not bad.. I just think it would taste amazing grilled!!

My mom went to go get the pizzas which we ordered 1 with mushrooms and 1 with sausage. She gets home and we're starving can't wait to dig in. Go to open them and they're both mushroom pizzas. It's too long of a drive for us to go back and why waste our gas for their mistake. So we call them up and she says she can give us a credit of $7. $7?!? The 2 pizzas with a bottle of sodas came to over $30. What school did this chick go to to even think that a $7 credit was worth what we paid for. Unbelievable. So we tell her we'll just take the pizza we originally paid for and for the inconvenience they were going to deliver it even though we are out of the radius. It was at this moment that they just lost us forever. She had the NERVE to ask for the wrong pizza back. She told us they would deliver our right one if we can give the wrong one back. Ok, so what are they going to do with the messed up pizza? Throw it away? Try to RE SELL it to someone else? She could have just let us keep it for the inconvenience. That just completely turned us off. It was very unsanitary to even consider taking it back, and makes you think if they're gonna try to resell it to another customer.

First time eating here about 5 years ago just by reading reviews from yahoo trying to find a good New York style pizza. Once you walk into this local spot of a hang out you see how everyone feels so comfortable.  In one corner you have family/friends enjoying their time laughing and catching up on gossip and in another you see a regular come in and sit down at his usual spot. And at this particular time the wife and I came in to try it out the place it felt like we've been there before by just the way we were greeted and the whole atmosphere. The waitress was great she kept ending her questions for us with ""doll"". And when we told her this was our first time there she asked, you wanting pizza...yes, slice or pie...pie, a lot on it...yes, then you'll like ""The Works"". After that...the rest is history. After meeting Anthony and Jimmy you feel like your apart of the place. Anthony has such a regular following for the way he makes his pizza he'll even half bake and not slice it so you can enjoy it hot when you get home. Thus, everytime I come into Vegas I stop off there to eat and when I leave to head back to Cali I get my half bake for the trip home as well as an order of garlic knots(so so good if you love a lot of garlic) for the drive. Oh and if Anthony is working don't ask for ranch dressing for his pies haha.",znc81oPgkcSIXwBm91Y0Qw,0,0,5,6585vOznHM-kSD3ptelkBA

The people working there are so nice, and seem to be from New York. There were a couple of New Yorkers eating pizza there when I walked in to place my order, and they were conversing with the employees. Pretty cool if you ask me. 

The food was tasty, the pizza perfect, and the garlic knots were good. I have had better cannolis, but no complaints about this one. The lady was nice and ordered me a drink of my choice while I waited for y food. The staff there seem to get along really well.  

There are many specials and they also have a rewards program. If I lived in the area, I would totally be a regular here. Supporting local businesses who do right by their customers is always a good decision. 

The only thing I would have done differently was to either order two whole pizzas instead of a half half, or order the 16 inch instead of 14 inch.

But on a recent visit, we ate in and tried some other things. The chicken parm is good and HUGE. Plan to share that and you may still end up bringing some home. Crispy, crunchy and hearty with a tasty marinara. Comes with a smal house salad -- crisp head lettuce with tomato and cucumber. It's even a kid-friendly salad, I discovered. The garlic bread that also accompanies the dish was perfectly cooked and crispy. There was maybe a flavor of margarine (?) about it, though, which I didn't love.

Can't beat the Garlic Knots. Olive oil, garlic and crunchy spheres of carb goodness. Mmm.

The gal who was our server has been there for years, and is very nice. This time, I even met Jimmy, the owner -- a very nice guy who likes to kibbitz with his friends, his customers. It's a nice and homey scene, really.

Are they the friendliest bunch? Not always, but do you really care? I may be showing my New York, but just give me my pizza and send me on my way. This is a hole-in-the-wall mostly meant for takeout or delivery, not a five-star steakhouse. Come for the pizza, not the freaking ambiance.

I'd recommend picking up a copy of the menu and calling in your order. For one, there's a $1 delivery fee through Eat24 while their printed menu says it's free.

They have pretty decent garlic knots. I tried this place back in the day, and for some reason, I wasn't a fan. Then in the past month or so I've had delivery twice and a couple pickup orders.

I opted for the thin traditional pie the first two times. Everything was great, except for some reason this place doesn't seem to know how to make a pie well done. I ordered it well both times, each time it was slightly undercooked. Considering that they use a brick oven, that's a little baffling and somewhat frustrating. It isn't enough to make me stop going here, but hopefully next time, they'll cook it longer. So with that little annoyance aside, I'll move on to my pickup experience.

I decided to try their Sicilian when I went to pick up. When I arrived, the guy at the counter was pretty unfriendly. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but it was kinda crappy. There was lots of older people that seemed like they owned the joint. I liked that! If it's family owned and operated, they get a few bonus points with me. The Sicilian pizza was pretty incredible. It was one of the best I've had in this town. It was close to a New York Sicilian. That automatically made up for the shoddy customer service and the previously undercooked pies. Those issues prevent me from giving it 5 stars, but damn, that was a delicious Sicilian. I think they beat Verrazano's. The garlic knots here beat Verrazano's as well. So definitely try it out if you haven't already. It's currently my favorite pizzeria! Update: I think the customer service was an isolated incident.

5672240,2011-07-14,0,HUWLnKD5LSZY134amUO2Rg,"Living near the restaurant for many years, I always wanted to try their pizza. For one reason or another, it never seemed to materialize.

A couple months ago, we had some vendors stop by work, and they asked us to order pizza. Their dime seemed like the best time to give this place a shot.

It was very good. Why did I wait so long?

Today, the boss stops by my desk and asks me where we should go to order pizza for everybody, remembering our last good experience, we went with NY Pizza & Pasta again.

I was given a budget, and (we learned after the fact) stayed under it for 5 multi-topping large pizzas, a couple orders of fries, some mozzarella & zucchini sticks, garlic knots and misc dipping sauces for around $120.

Normally, when pizza is on hand, there are a few people that eat anything and will grab some slices, others that are picky and eat a slice or two, and a few people that NEVER eat pizza.

Jokingly, after lunch, the boss told me that I was going to be fired if I didn't order enough food again. As there was NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING left. It even looked like someone drank the last of the ranch.

The food was so good that every member of our staff fought for as much food as they could get.

The delivery estimate on the site (as I ordered the food online) was 45-60 minutes, I got a call back stating that it may take up to 90 minutes because it is such a large order. Between the original estimate of 45-60 minutes the delivery driver arrived. He set up all of the food in our conference room and surprised us with some 2 liter bottles of soda thrown in as well.

Quick, good food at reasonable prices, if you are in the area, give them a chance!",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,1,0,5,JBuktJpzyDVSuQ8XNOJQhg

My stromboli was ready within a reasonable time considering they make all their foods from scratch. It was definitely proportional to my appetite and loved every minute of it. The meat and cheese is good quality and they don't bog it down with extra dough; perfect meat to dough ratio.

This is a cool little place off Jones and Sahara. They have lots of tables for eating right off the red checkerboard vinyl tableclothes. It ain't fancy, but it is good. 

Menu has plenty to choose from, pizzas to pastas to meatball subs, and lots more. Its family run, they are originally from NY, so expect that when you talk to them. You won't get fancy service here, just good solid friendly folks with a NY edge.

So, I was on this side of town craving pizza and Yelp directions to the nearest pizza pizza joint.  This one had good reviews so I decided to stop in. I'm glad I did!
I got a medium two topping pizza with extra sauce and surprise, surprise they actually gave me extra sauce!!.  I got an order of garlic knots which were very garlicky...which is my favorite...and soft;  just yummy little nuggets of love!!!

I never eat the crust because I'm usually full and I had to actually forced myself to eat them they were so delicious the crust is fabulous the sauce is incredible and what is Italian food... It's ALL about the sauce!

I have been back twice since then and from now on when I want pizza or Italian food of any type, this is where I'm going!  It takes me a good half an hour to get there and back...but it's well worth it!

 I have since had the meatball sub which is excellent and a sausage, onion, green pepper sub which was good.
