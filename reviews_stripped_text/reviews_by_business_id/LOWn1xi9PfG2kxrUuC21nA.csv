We special ordered hoagie rolls (wheat & white), for pick up the next afternoon. These rolls held ALL of the ingredients of the sandwich and did not get soggy!! 

Fantastic bread and service! We will be back!

I really like how visitors are welcomed with samples upon entry, with a choice of about eight different daily breads and sweets such as lemon bars! Great touch.

I tried the Turkey Pesto sando but switched out sourdough for garlic-cheddar, which is incredible! The sandwich held up despite the pesto and balsamic sauces, and was super thick for the $8 price tag. It was filling even without adding on a side, though Lisa and her hubs praised the soup they tried.

I do think it's cool they give you a free slice to sample.

However, my sandwich was just blah. My three star rating is a combo of high pricing with an average sandwich. For 9.00 I got a sandwich I probably could have made at home in about 2 minutes.

A side that induced a different feeling; a feeling of warmth, closeness, and health.  Great Harvest Bread Company is like the Good 'Wich of the West! Great Harvest promotes for the healthy conscious with their variety of whole-grain freshly baked bread and hearty ready-made products.  Their welcoming offer of a sample of their freshly baked bread when visitors enter their bakery is their way of saying, ""Hey! Try this delicious slice of flavorful goodness!""

My gf and I decided to give GHBC a try. As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted with a smile and a generous sample of their artichoke parmesan bread and pumpkin spice loaf with butter! We munched on them while we were glancing over their custom sandwich ordering sheet.  You have your different choice of meats, breads which also have a daily special for an additional .50, cheeses, and different deli toppings.  We got our sandwich grilled (an option to choose) with the daily special bread with pastrami, basil mayo, yellow mustard, provolone, peppercinis, and lettuce!  Yuh-meehhh! :P

We took the sandwich to go so it wasn't as fresh as we'd hoped it to be, but judging from how good the sandwich still was, I can tell it'd be even better! I'm excited to try more of their sandwiches and buying some of their loaves.

I was absolutely floored with this place when I first went (see previous review) but everytime I went back, it lacked a little bit more luster. They must have cut back on what breads they have because the last few times I went, all they had was white, wheat or sourdough. They're always out of the specialty breads. And the sandwiches - bread is dry and the whole sandwich is a little bland. What changed?! Last time I went, I had to go back up and ask for a side of hummus because the sandwich was soooo dry. This made it palatable but nowhere near deserving of the high price I paid. I think I'll just go to Port of Subs across the street.

The menu is nice for a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich. I got a turkey melt essentially with build my own and grilled it. So yummy on light wheat!

They didn't have it here BUT I was offered Cinnamon Honey but took a sample of this Cinnamon Bread with butter, Bread Pudding, and Coconut Loaf. My favorite was the coconut as it was fragrant and tasted slightly sweet.  I checked in and used the soft drink voucher and had breakfast in my car. Walked away with a Salted Caramel Cookie and a new place to hang out with friends.

Atmosphere: Reminds me of Colorado Coffee Shops...very chill music, folks come abd go, quiet and calming with caffeine and food. Great potential for a meet up or a ""get to know you"" kinda date.

Cost: About $8 for a loaf BUT its the best tasting bread you'll ever have. They have sandwiches and honey and jams too. Inexpensive-Slightly Expensive.

Samples: Are a thing and you should always try with butter bcuz...BUTTER.

3583502,2014-11-30,5,LOWn1xi9PfG2kxrUuC21nA,"VERDICT: Come for the delicious bread, leave for the atmosphere.

I really like Great Harvest Bread Co.  They do regular sliced bread a service, by making it fresh, preservative free and delicious.  The difference between Great Harvest Bread and Panera is dramatic.  Great Harvest shies away from croissants and danishes.  Instead they focus on white, wheat, and various other basic sliced breads.  They are really good though.  It really makes you detest going back to the normal grocery store fodder.  The downfall, as is with quality, is the price, about $5-$6 per loaf.  They also have cookies and a few bready desserts.

Part deux of this review really has to focus on the experience and atmosphere.  First, I was really excited to find a Great Harvest over by my Costco on Decatur.  I forced Greg to pull over and rush in.  However, there was a group of six or so teenage n'er-do-wells also approaching the store at the same time.  I was determined to get to the store before them and told Greg to hurry or they were going to beat us to the door.  He said, ""don't worry, they'll eat up the free samples and you'll get a fresh loaf to sample"".  He just said that because he is a lollygagger and hates to ""pick up the pace"".  I must be getting old since I've already used the terms ""n'er-do-well"" and ""lollygagger"" in this post.  Anyway, I let the hooligans beat me to the store.

Inside the narrow store, the teenagers turned out to be less of a threat.  It appeared to be closeted gay boys with their Christian-youth-group-approved girlfriends out having a wild time by venturing to the bread store to get a couple of sandwiches and get an inappropriate amount of free samples.  You know, basically being complete rebels.  They were kind of too outwardly excited about their bread samples in a wholesome way, saying things like ""I love bread"" and ""bread rocks"".  It was like those Totino pizza roll ads where the kids wax feverishly about their love of frozen food.

This process actually took a long time, giving me an ample amount of time to give Greg the I-told-you-so eye for being a lollygagger.  Something I'm sure he was oblivious to noticing.  During this time, I was also able to look around at all of the customers sitting at tables.  There were quite a few of them.  I would say at least ten people scattered through the sitting area.  Then it struck me as being incredibly odd.  Every single person was facing the counter.  Every single person was not eating, drinking, or talking.  They were just staring at the counter.  I felt this existential feeling like I was starring in Sartre's ""No Exit"".  They were the audience and I didn't know that I was in the play.  It was bizarre.  I know, I know, I often accuse restaurants of being cults, as in crEATe and the nearby Salad Creations, but I think I'm on to something. It was odd.  I have no idea what is going on there.

In any case, I get the counter with my Dakota wheat bread (sooooo gooood).  I get my choice of free samples and the girl behind the counter offered me the heel of the bread.  Those n'er-do-well, hooligan, gays and their beards stole my chance for a decent sample.  And Greg's lollygagging didn't help either.",pd5ouypeFcAlLEZ25o2uBg,0,0,4,tWzUJnoKA4RFUg5Ku1f1YA

The Gingerbread cookie is yummy and I don't even like gingerbread -

The cinnaburst bread is perfect with a slab of butter.
The Marzuka bars (granola N raspberries) are yummy but may need to be cooked just a little bit longer. Their other bar is called a Kahuna Bar and it's made just like the Marzuka bar but instead of raspberries they put chocolate chips,caramel and coconut. I don't care for coconut but it's a yummy bar!!!
My disappointment is with the Smores Bread -
 Dosen't Marshmallows,chocolate and graham crackers all mixed into a bread sound just sound delicious ? Well it did to me but man it didn't taste good to me or anyone at work. The concensus is that it tasted like wheat bread with mini chocolate chips in it. The lady also told me that she couldn't put this bread into the bread slicer because of all the marshmallows - boy that got me excited. Well, no one spotted or even tasted a marshmallow. FYI-They will hand cut this bread for you if you want.
I love fresh bread and I'm happy that there is a place close to work that I can buy fresh bread from and just from Walmart or Vons. Great Harvest is not cheap but sure is tasty. Don't forget that they have a bread slicer  and a frequent buyer card.
 Just yesterday they had for sale green colored bread made to look like fingers with red nail polish and orange colored bread that looked just like a large spider - Very cute.....

I am here to edit my review. After writing this I got an email from the owner and well turns out there was a lot of miscommunication with the staff and myself. Seems the staff that day didn't I understand the policy. Well after speaking with the owner Maria I will be giving it another chance and sticking with what I know I like  I am giving three stars thanks to Maria for making things better and communicating with me. 



So I went there today with a friend to ha w a great lunch. It had always been good. Well today I went with the recommendation of the cashier and got the meatball sub. I get my sandwich take a bite of a meatball and spit it back out. It was totally disgusting. It tasted like freezer burned meatballs with a touch of wet dog. I take it back to the cashier and ask if I can get another sandwich because I didn't like the meatball. She starts to make a different one and then says she needs to call someone and ask. Then tells me that to get a new sandwich I'd have to buy a new one because they can't afford to remake. So basically if you hate your food or they mess up you have to pay for another sandwich. I then say I would just take a refund minus the drink. So they can afford to give me a refund and lose my business but can't afford to make a customer happy. I will no longer be going there for food or even the bread I love so much. I will now go to Kneaders for my bread cravings. You can afford a bad review it seems as well.

I usually go to the location off of Tropicana and Hualapai, it's quite a bit bigger.  I think this location is about half the size, selection a bit more limited.  No worries though, was able to get a couple loaves of lemon poppy seed cake, a banana chocolate chip cake, and a cinnamon chip loaf of bread.

Their breads are always great here, baked fresh daily!

This location is a bit small, so it looked like their selection was smaller.  Store was nicely set up given the space, and staff was great.

4539267,2011-06-18,1,LOWn1xi9PfG2kxrUuC21nA,"Really enjoy me some Great Harvest. The free sample of bread that you get when you walk in the door is nice, but here's what happens to me every time I go there: 
I walk in and go to the counter where they ask which type of bread I would like as my sample. I quickly make that decision and get my large slice of bread with butter on it, then proceed to order my sandwich (which will most likely have waaay too many toppings on it). While I wait for the sandwich, I eat the bread. A few minutes later, they bring out my sandwich, which is great. And it looks so good! There is one problem, though; I'm not that hungry anymore! 

I literally do this every single time. I know, a little self-control would go a long way in my situation, but all of the bread is so good! Maybe there's something I haven't tried before. How could I pass that up? The sandwiches here are great, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every loaf of bread I've had bought from Great Harvest. The potato cheese is probably my favorite. 

The one issue I have with this place - and another review has already mentioned this - is the smell. It doesn't smell like a bakery, a sandwich shop, or even a food place. I don't know what the smell is in there, but it doesn't smell like food. At all. It's a little off-putting, but the sandwiches here are great and more than make up for the olfactory confusion. I go here whenever I'm looking for a sandwich, and it's pretty close to my house, which is great!",yQSb5pj4tXzslWlgysqhzw,0,0,4,qLc81nlH-7CQKbWBUyXG2Q

When I saw they made homemade breads they already had me sold - reminded me of home in the midwest and traveling through Minnesota. 

From the moment you walked in, till the moment you walked out we had some of the nicest, most polite service.

The air was filled with smells of different breads.

They offered us about 10 samples to choose from.. ranging from different flavored breads to desserts. 

We ordered both soups, potato bacon and vegetable - and both got a breakfast sandwich. While waiting we met a couple that made the overall experience the best. They visit Vegas once a year and come to this spot... 6 years in a row. We talked about how amazing all the food sounded on the menu and I was actually getting hungrier as I was eating!!! 

Afterwards, we couldn't leave without get the desserts we sampled! Simply delicious.

The service was quick and friendly enough. Maybe I'll try the bread next time. They offer samples when you come in of the breads of the day which is awesome.

Great Harvest has a really amazing selection of breads, sandwiches, sweet treats, and drinks.  They have a daily bread selection, and also a different specialty bread for each day of the week.  

When we came in on Saturday, we saw the beautiful bread tray, and were offered a sample of whatever we wanted.  
We tried the lemon bar, the challah bread, the pumpkin bread, and the dakota.  
Each different bread (and bar)  was mosit, delicious, and soft.  the dakota had a crunchy crust, and was a thick, dense bread that was absolutely delightful.  

For our meals, we tried: 
The Roast Beef chimichurri:  Roast beef, Swiss cheese, Chimichurri sauce, red onion, lettuce and tomato on Honey Whole Wheat Bread
Clam Chowder, served with cheddar garlic loaf.

The sandwich was amazing.  My husband and I split it, and split a medium chowder, and that was definitely a filling meal.  The roast beef was delicious, there were plenty of toppings, and the honey whole wheat was soft, but didn't get soggy.  Loved the chimichurri too, it had just a tiny little kick to it that was wonderful.

The clam chowder was delicious.  Very flavorful.  Paired with the cheddar garlic bread, we were very happy,  let me tell you.

We ended up purchasing a loaf of the cheddar garlic bread.  It was too good to pass up, and for $7.95, there's a lot of bread there.  I want to make grilled cheeses out of it tonight!!

Also...the salted caramel cookie?  To die for.  Chewy.  Sweet.  Salty.  Perfection.

Can I talk about service?  So nice!  The young man and the lady that helped us were both super friendly and super nice.  My sandwich took a little time to come out, but I'm not mad.  The quality of the food, and the friendly service was more than enough to compensate for a little wait.  And it wasn't even that long of a wait anyway.  

Great Harvest also sells apple butter, syrups, jams, and other goodies.  

All in all, this was a great visit.  
I'm going back tomorrow to try their Autumn apple loaf!!  I can't wait!!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,5,5,74t6_RIdoHeHvLD0vlKOQA
5278301,2015-11-15,4,LOWn1xi9PfG2kxrUuC21nA,"Fresh quality sandwiches with impeccable service - that's what Great Harvest is offering up. Specialty bread loaves of bread ranging from pumpkin chocolate chip to honey whole wheat are also available for purchase, priced at $5-8 each. Let's not forget the giant cookies and desserts either! I've ate here twice within a month and have not been disappointed thus far.

GRILLED CHEESE ($6.95): Comes with 3 types of cheese - you get to choose between cheddar, swiss, provolone, and pepper jack. Grilled on sourdough bread. Super cheesy and filling. 4/5

VEGAS VEGGIE ($6.95): Comes on honey wheat or cheddar bread, with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach leaves, purple onions, balsamic vinegar, and some kind of hummus spread. The only thing that's missing is cheese! Technically a vegan sandwich I guess but it was delightfully crisp, flavorful, and light. 4/5 

LITTLE ITALY: ($7.95?): My husband inhales this sandwich. As he's demolishing it, he gasps in between breaths, this is SO good!!

CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE: If you get a combo the meals comes with a drink and your choice of a cookie or chips. The cookie is huge but a little sweet for me. More cookie for the mister! 3/5
FUDGE BROWNIE?: This square chunk of fudge and caramel was an upgrade option to the combo for $1.50 more. It's a super heavy dessert item, but it was fun to try just once. 3/5

SERVICE: They greet every customer that walks in, and say bye as they exit. The staff are super nice. On our first visit, the manager gave us a complimentary coconut muffin because she said the wait was too long (it wasn't). There's a couple of loaves by the register - ask for a sample! They'll even add butter if you'd like. 5/5

VIBE: Small, quiet cafe seating inside and outdoor seating as well. 4/5 

VALUE: For two people and with the 10% military discount, it costs about $17.  

Worth a Return Visit?
I see many sandwiches from Great Harvest Cafe in my future.
