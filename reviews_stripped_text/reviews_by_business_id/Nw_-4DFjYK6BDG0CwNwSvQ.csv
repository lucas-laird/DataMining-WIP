I was greeted by Teyanna who was friendly and quick to take care of the transaction. She also let me know about the promotion to win cash and prizes if you go online and let Pizza Hut know about your experience.

Pizza was cooked the way it should be and no drama going on behind the scenes, I waited for my pizza to be done.

328557,2015-03-03,0,Nw_-4DFjYK6BDG0CwNwSvQ,"I don't normally bother writing reviews for fast food chains. Everyone knows about them, and even if the reviews were low, they would still go because of price and convenience. That being said, this particular location always gets my pizza dollars when I want takeout. Ordering online is easy (as it oughtta be), with the little timer that tells me when my order is ready for pickup. This place is a five minute drive from my place, so I don't mind. The pizza is always consistent when I order here--I never have to worry about it being decent some days and barely edible others.

But what made this location earn my customer loyalty is the service. The people inside are always friendly, prompt, and professional. From the manager to the cooks, everyone is super cool and never show it to the customers that they're working fast food for minimum wage. Even the young high school-looking workers are happy to assist you. That should tell you a lot about how the management hires and trains their staff. I've even taken time to answer the little survey on the pizzahut website after picking up my order--in hopes of this location gets recognized by corporate.

Drawbacks: It's located in a semi-sketchy part of Boulder Highway, so be prepared to be asked for $ by beggars in the parking lot at any time, day or night. In fact, make sure to lock your vehicle if you come after dark. The parking lot is busy and well-lit, but I've often seen unsavory folks lurking about. And it's still pizza hut pizza--the kids love it, but it is what it is. I'll have a slice or two, but that's my limit. Not the healthiest pizza and definitely not gourmet, but it's fast and cheap.",OKdLRP7nWMXHVHqPrkJUyA,1,0,3,E8dDqHgVDPP_7LClQ2we-Q

I waited a few and two people exited with their order. I entered but wasn't greeted. There were two guys on the bench, ronda rousey type on my right and older woman on my left. After five minutes of the loud chatter between the guys on whether someone played football or basketball in college, another group enters. A small greeting finally from the back I will be right with you. I made the comment loud enough to be heard back there "" okay but you running out of room up here.""  a few moments and a cashier arrives, but has no clue who was here first. I gave the direction of who was here before me and that mine was ready. The ronda rousey was kind and let me get my boxes and go. The couple that came in behind me decided on chicken next door rather then wait for pizza.

2354894,2014-01-12,0,Nw_-4DFjYK6BDG0CwNwSvQ,"Each and every time I pickup a pizza here, I feel like I'm entering Chuck-E-Cheese. There is NEVER anyone up front, which I don't know how many staff are on at any given time of day, but if you have a list of 12 pizzas on the board, 5 of which are showing READY, I would suggest maybe having someone float near the front waiting for people entering the store?  This particular night, I walked in and noticed a male worker near the front, ignored me, and walked to the back. Shortly after, I heard a, ""I'll be right there!!!"" from the back. Hmm..ok?  This was followed by giggling and bantering about how that statement could have also been said, to which said loud mouth replied asking if Yoo Hoo, Hold on a second, would be more appropriate?  Laughing afterwards again. When a human finally appeared at the register after my 5 minute wait, she asked my name and must have noticed I was not amused, and her tone changed.  I asked her to add dipping sauce onto my order and she said, no worries, gave me the same total. Ok...   I gave my card, and he got my pizza, asked if I needed anything else, and I said the blue cheese?  She started getting grated cheese, and I asked again for the blue cheese, to which she must have forgotten (giggle giggle), and got two for me. 
I don't mind having fun at work, but don't do it in front of customers waiting, and who may or may not have had a shitty day.  It's not amusing.  These workers act like children, and this is not the first time I've encountered this at this location.  I order from here because it's convenient for me from where I live and I know the consistency of Pizza hut pizza.   If these workers don't care about their customers, I can only worry that they don't care about the food they're preparing either and I'll be utilizing local, non-chain pizza places going forward. I've also sent a complaint to corporate.  Lesson?  Don't piss off someone who has had a shitty day by making them wait around and then acting like clowns.


UPDATE: I received an email from corporate addressing the issue and apologizing saying they would contact the store manager. I received a phone call from the store manager apologizing and offering a $15 credit to my account which is valid only at this location. I am not positive I will use this as I don't trust the workers there. If they see this credit, what would they do to my order?  Very generous solution, and I thanked her, but probably won't be using that credit.",48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,2,0,1,y3V-WnskWTtHa4ZQvVH4Jg

4187815,2015-06-22,1,Nw_-4DFjYK6BDG0CwNwSvQ,"Pleasantly surprised.

We were looking to get a pizza, and quickly. It was too hot to go out, but we debated on whether or not to get Pizza Hut. What we don't like about it is that the pizza never seems to be baked long enough for our taste. We like the cheese to be a bit browned. The cheese on their pizzas always seems to be just melted and warmed through. 

Anyway, we saw that they had new flavors, and chose the 'Flavor of Now' Cock-a-doodle bacon pizza, hand tossed. Silly name, but the ingredients sounded good. Creamy garlic parmesan sauce, grilled chicken, hardwood smoked bacon, diced roma tomatoes and toasted parmesan crust.

The sauce was great, very flavorful. I love tomatoes on pizza, the taste changes a bit to make them tangy. The chicken did not seem to be grilled, but more like frozen strips of chicken that were thawed and heated through. However, the crust was excellent with the toasted parmesan.  I would prefer that the crust be more of an artisan thin crust, and the cheese baked a bit longer...but this was a pretty tasty pizza. I would definitely order this again. 

Our delivery guy was great also. Very pleasant. I placed my order online, using my credit card. Although I was told to show my card at delivery, this was not necessary. There was no place to add a tip online, but he brought the receipt for me to sign, and there was a line to add a tip on this.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,1,2,4,xn-NhHaQr3HY1KPJ6S1xYQ
