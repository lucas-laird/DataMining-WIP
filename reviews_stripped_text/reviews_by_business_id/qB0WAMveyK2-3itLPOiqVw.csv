The steak was very tender and came in a good sized portion with rice, beans and salad. The pupusas are perfectly cooked - nice, moist and fluffy, with just enough color on them. The service was friendly, and they checked in with us several times to refill drinks and see how we were doing.

2028820,2012-11-10,0,qB0WAMveyK2-3itLPOiqVw,"Apparently Yelp hides reviews written in Spanish or sends them to the bottom.  Being that this restaurant is a Latin restaurant where most clients speak Spanish, I wrote my review in Spanish but here's my review in English.

THREE TIMES, I have received bad food!  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone for Salvadorean food.

I tried to give the place a chance but after three times of the same bad food, I just decided its best to let go.

The chicken or fish dinner plates are horrible.  The meat itself is dry and it seems they are not fresh.  When these complaints are brought to the staffs and subsequently to the owners attention they simply are indifferent and do nothing to resolve the problem.

The last time, I ordered to go and was so angry after I got home and discovered a poorly cooked and tasting fried fish. Gross. I immediately called and over the phone the owner offered to refund the money or another replacement dinner the following day as they were closing for the night. So I was without dinner that night and had to put something simple and quick at home. 

The next day and the following days after, nobody wanted to do good on their word of giving me a replacement dinner, even though the owner claimed he would leave a note to inform his staff in charge.  i didn't even want my money but after a few days i demanded a refund, and it was then that they offered to replaced the fish, the fish ONLY because they felt that was the only thing that was not to par.  seriously?lol i laughed at their lack of professionalism.  who buys a dinner plate just for one of the items? a dinner plate is made up of all the items on it to provide you with a delicious eating experience. that means the salad, the rice as well.  so that day they only gave me a fish! LOL i felt that i was transported to El Salvador, a third world country.  Certainly thats the only place where they would think this to be good business practice.

They're a joke! The food is horrible. The chicken and fish is not fresh. Even the second fish was in the same condition.  One of the waitresses even made a comment that's how they do things. She even suggested ordering pupusas as they tend to have less issues with that, some times.  

Only because you are a Latin restaurant that doesn't mean you have to provide a substandard service.  There are many other Latin restaurants that do a great job.  This place needs to take notes from them.",vykR9vl9F_a1FAn3kJ95VQ,2,1,1,6Txs4m89Qxk5rIFhyqykpA

2927166,2011-11-07,4,qB0WAMveyK2-3itLPOiqVw,"Yum yum yum, I love pupusas!

I came here with my mom and sister. We all ordered pupusas revueltas (cheese,beans,pork) and I also got a side of plantains, beans, and cream. They gave us a bowl of curtido (cabbage slaw w/ chiles and vinegar) and a bottle of tomato salsa to share. The pupusas came out very nice and hot. They were so hot that I had to wait a few minutes to dig in (that's how you know they're fresh). I always tend to drown my pupusas in the tomato salsa because it's soo good, but I noticed that no one else really does that. The waitress kept on checking on us to make sure we were always well stocked. We ended up getting 2 bowls of the curtido because we were all eating big forkfuls of it (so fresh and tasty). I actually got 3 pupusas which was two too many. They're very filling, so I suggest you just get one or two, especially if you're going to get beans or whatever else on the side. The fried plantains were just how my parents make them at home. Perfectly cooked, soft, not overly sweet, and delicious with the cream and beans. 

Pros:
*Very fresh pupusas
*Yummy curtido and tomato salsa
*Fast, friendly service
*Large menu (they also have tacos, burritos, burgers, fries, etc)
*Authentic food
*Cheap prices (we spent less than $25 for 3 people)

Cons:
*The location is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but that makes this more of a ""locals"" joint, which is a good thing!

Tips
*Don't order revueltas if you're not big on cheese. I gave my boyfriend one and he said it was too cheesy. Stick to just pork or beans
*Try the fried plantains with the cream and beans!
*Ask the waitress for more time to look at the menu. She tends to come by kind of fast and you want to make sure you go through the whole menu before ordering.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,4,4,4,YQW3ioDDtGuNFHm1T9sToQ

3214944,2015-11-06,1,qB0WAMveyK2-3itLPOiqVw,"For a a year now, my Salvadorian friend has been teasing me about going out for pupusas.  The day finally came.  We were at a convention not too far from Las Pupusas, and he said today was the day.  Naturally I was pretty excited.  This day was a year in the making.  My buddy told me that the pupusas here are good and pretty much the same stuff he grew up on.

We got in around 2pm.  First thing I noticed was that the restaurant was pretty big.  Lots of seating.  Dove into the menu and I started asking questions.  His go to is the standard cheese pupusa.  But I felt adventurous so I got a loroco (herbs and cheese) and a revuleto (beans, chichorron, and cheese).  And got an order of pork pasteles (deep fried dumpling with shredded pork filling).  I found out very quickly that the Salvadorian version of chichorron is not the same as the mexican way.  The Salvadorian version is actually pork meat, not the pork skins.  The service was good, the waitresses spoke Spanish and perfect English.  I had no problems ordering my food.  

So, the pupusas come with curtido (pickled cabbage) and salsa roja (tomato sauce condiment).  I piled the curtido on top of my pupusas, drowned them in salsa roja, and a heavy helping of tapatio hot sauce.  First up was the loroco.  The dough is nice and thick.  It soaks up all the salsa roja and does not disintegrate, holds up very well.  I don't know what kind of herb the loroco is, but it is a bit floral and quite tasty.  The cheese was ooey and gooey, melted to perfection.  The curtido adds a nice crunch and very complimentary to the soft and doughy pupusa.  The revuleto was mostly cheesy with shreds of pork here and there.  I could really taste the frijoles, which is a good thing as I'm not a huge fan of them.  Or maybe I just drowned them out with the curtido and salsa roja.  The chicharron added some taste and texture to the pupusa, although the pupusas aren't overstuffed, you definitely taste the meat.  Both pupusas were very tasty in their own right.  But that curtido and salsa roja really put them over the top for me.  Really liking this dish.

Time for the pasteles.  These shredded pork filled dumplings reminded me of Indian samosas. They both have a similar bite and texture to them, although the filling is quite different.  According to my buddy, these pasteles are some of the best he has ever had.  Being that this was my first time eating them, all I can say is they were delicious!  

One of the best parts of the meal was the bill.  at $2 a pupusas, you really can't go wrong.  I ordered 2 pupusas and a order of pasteles (3 large pieces), I was overstuffed, I could only eat 2 of the pasteles.  

My pro tip would be to order 2 pupusas and share an order of pasteles.  For the really big appetite, 3 pupusas and share some pasteles.  if you go for 4 pupusas, you'll be super full and need someone to roll you out in a wheel barrel.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,0,0,4,v7I9uVB_zGROgvVdC5ICSQ

We entered and it was like a big warehouse type restaurant with lots of tables. We ordered the mixed/combination (cheese, beans, meat) pupusas and plantains. Also, had horchata. My portion was less than $5 so, MAJOR score.

It came with some kinda of slaw and hot sauce. I tried the slaw on my pupusa but, didn't like it too much. Hot sauce, on the other hand, I loved on everything including my plantains.

Anyways, I finished my 1 pupusa and half of my plantains. And I was stuffed. And such a happy lady =)

1) Having a server who speaks english would be great! I love, love, love El Salvadorian food, but it was hard to communicate our needs with our server because she didn't speak english very well- I wish I spoke Spanish, I really do, but I don't! 
2) Stuff for the kids would have been nice- crayons, etc. 
3) A bit overpriced for what I am used to paying for papusas, but I guess it's because it's Vegas and everything is a little more expensive than I am used to. 
4) I didn't get everything I ordered.. my hubby and I ordered one of the same papusas and he got one but I didn't.

I came to this restaurant with a lady, and we ordered a few pupusas revueltas with some sodas and some strange chocolate-y drink. I've got to admit, the pupusas were good. They were hot, and they seemed like they were made just then. I don't know that they actually were, but still. They were good enough that I will return to this place, despite some of my issues, just for the pupusas. 

The service was slow. Really, really slow. Slow enough that when I wanted to order more food, I had to go out and find someone to help me (the place was empty, btw). Also, they never refilled my water. It took us forever to get more soda (Cola Champan) when the brown mystery drink was put aside.

I couldn't wait to get them pupusas in my belly stat! I went with my husband and friend. Right off the bat we told the waitress we wanted separate checks and she was cool with that. 

 I ordered horchata, pupusa de frijol, pupusa de pollo con queso and a flan. My husband ordered 2 pupusas de loroco and a pupusa revuelta. 

My horchata tastes horrible. It left a weird burnt aftertaste in my mouth but they let me exchange it for another drink. Why an horchata would taste like that is beyond me. When the food came out the waitress forgot our silverware. Not a big deal. She brought them after we let her know. My pupusas were good, I liked the beans better than the chicken one. My husband got 3 loroco and no revuelta. We informed the waitress of the mistake and she seemed to have a hard time understanding the problem. The conversation went something like this: (it was in Spanish so I'm translating to English)

""I ordered 2 loroco and one revuelta and I got all 3 loroco""
""What did you order?""
""I ordered 2 loroco and 1 revuelta""
""And what did you get?""
""I got all 3 loroco""
""So what is the problem, I'm not understanding""
(At this point we all start chiming in ""it's not what he ordered, you gave him the wrong thing)
""It's not what I ordered""
""So what do you want me to do""
""I want you to fix it""
""So do you want to buy another pupusa?""
""You know what, forget it. It's fine""
""It's ok I'll just get you another pupusa""

She did not return until 30 min after we finished our meal and only because we called her over. She did not bring the pupusa and she forgot about the flan. I should mention the place was pretty empty so she was not overwhelmingly busy. We asked for the flan and our check and reminded her we wanted separate checks. So she asked us to tell her exactly what we each ordered again so we did. 

The flan I got was slightly burnt. The flan my friend got was delicious. :/ and of course my husband never got his pupusa revuelta. When she came back with the check she told me, ""I charged you for your friends flan"" umm...Ok. When it was time to sign she just stood there waiting while I calculated the tip and signed.

The food was amazing. I ordered one chicken taco and a pupusa pollo con queso which is basically a thick corn tortilla filled with cheese and chicken.
This was my time trying Salvadoran food and I was really impressed. One taco may not sound like a lot but the pupusa itself was quite filling. It came with a side of cabbage salad (some kind of coleslaw) which had a kick to it.
My friend ordered the steak nachos and boy were they good. Not only was the steak very tasty but what I loved the most was the homemade tortilla chips. If you love spicy food, one thing to try is their homemade hot sauce.

The prices are reasonable about $2 for pupusas which is pretty cheap for the amount of food served. The service was not that great. It took an average of 20 minutes to get our waters refilled. Another thing, that bothered me was a $2 ""miscellaneous"" charge added to our check. We didn't notice it until we left the restaurant, so please check your receipt before leaving.

The pupusas are always so hot and fresh and always cooked perfectly. Not oily, or too much masa and not enough filling. The curtido here is always crunchy and delicious. Never too salty or vinegary. 

I also love the variety of fillings they have at this location for pupusas. Chicharrones and cheese is one my favorites but the calabasas and cheese is definitely in my rotation now. 

I recently had the yucca and fried chicharrone and while it was not as delicious as my pupusas, it was good. The fried pork was definitely fried as it was super crispy and once I added some salt and tomato sauce it was good eats. The yucca was perfect. Soft and creamy on the inside and a nice bite on the outside.
