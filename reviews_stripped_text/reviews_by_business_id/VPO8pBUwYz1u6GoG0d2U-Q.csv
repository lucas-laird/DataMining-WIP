No communication regarding being out of mild chicken while waiting patiently in the drivethru, but they did upgrade a piece to a breast no charge. The high school kids manning the store seem friendly enough but seem more focused on the never ending free soda dealie. I can get a 6 piece 2 side 2 biscuit for $6.99 for printing out a coupon at the other location, I guess it'll probably be my last visit.

First time, paid and the cashier said ""thank you, by"" so I started to drive, then I hear her yelling out for me. She forgot my drinks! So, I just stopped, thinking she will bring them out.....no cars behind me..... NOPE! Never came out, so I had to park and get out to get my drinks from inside. Meanwhile, they were all just chit chatting inside. No apology. 

Second time, just today..... I ordered, paid.... cashier tells me it will be ""3 minutes"" for my fries and to go park and wait. So I do. Waited longer than 3 minutes, it was actually 7 minutes. I go inside, and the order was just there off to the side. No one cared to bring it out. Defeats the purpose of using drive thru!!!
My food was cold, biscuits were old and we ordered a 12 piece family meal. Apparently they thought giving me 6 wings and 3 legs as part of the 12 piece was a good deal.

If I had it must have been a forgettable experience and could have saved me approximately $8 today.  I was out and about running errands and realized I had not eaten yet.  I was on my way home and thought I would check out this location, because I had never has Popeye's....or so I thought.

I cruised into the drive-thru and was met with a voice on the other end of the squawk box purely going though the motions.  I ordered a #7.  This consists of three fingers, a side (I chose fries), and a drink.

I was pleasantly surprised when I pulled up to the window, I thought the lad did his best.  He was polite and courteous when he told me they did not take American Express (all about the points), I gave him cash instead.  Another lad asked me if I would like some dipping sauce with my meal.  He was also polite and handed me my dipping sauce.

Off I went....When I arrived at my domicile, and opened the box, I discovered where chicken fingers and fries went to die.  Every bite was cold and tasted of a chicken finger and fry graveyard.  I felt soulless and empty as I ate my soulless and empty meal.  I even mixed up my own version of a garlic and ranch sauce trying to play Dr. Frankenstein while attempting to resurrect my meal.  Alas, nothing could save it.

Prior to writing this, I conducted a search of my previous reviews and discovered I had indeed eaten at another Popeye's location.  I did not like it.  I do not like this location either.  Based on two reviews of the franchise, I am sure I will never dine at another.

I would go more often except that at least half the time they get my order wrong, and the staff apparently couldn't care less about it. Yesterday the family wanted Popeyes. I knew what was coming, and they didn't disappoint. I ordered a five piece chicken fingers dinner, plus a coupon special that came with five fingers, two sides and two biscuits - allegedly. I got the food home and found that the five finger combo had only three pieces of chicken in it (for over $9), the coupon special only had one biscuit, and there were no utensils for the sides. I drove back to the store, where I waited at the counter as employees ignored me for nearly five minutes. When one finally did approach me and I explained the problem, she asked, ""Do you want me to replace it?"" No, I drove all the way back here just to tell you this and leave. Just keep the extra money for the three pieces of chicken you gave me when I paid for five. Duh...

After all of that, the chicken tasted dry and stale after I got it home, like it had been cooked hours earlier and left to sit.

I have contacted corporate about this store before, and they apparently don't care either.  I have never gotten a response from either a store manager or anyone at the corporate office. Judging from the other comments here, the staff is costing them business and they aren't doing anything to fix it. This store has been open long enough that these problems should have been sorted long ago. If it were up to me, I would never patronize this store again, but the family likes Popeyes.

The food itself is worth coming here. I love their mashed potatoes and their spicy chicken is really good! Now this time kind of confused me for a second. I thought it was original and had to wait a second for a little bit of spice to come in! This location is in a great area right across the street from Smiths! Everything was really clean, including the bathroom. Maybe it's just the night staff that everyone complains about, but day time is great! They are a little too over priced in my opinion. 3 pieces of chicken, a biscuit, one side, and a drink was a little more than $8. Nothing really to complain too much about. All fried chicken places are over priced to be honest.

I've been here 3 times and each thine the wait was loooonnnggg. The first time I came was through drive thru. Not too bad except for the wait time. Second time I went to the counter and order the chicken meal. After waiting almost 15 minutes my number is called. I looked down at my tray and realized they gave me tenders. Immediately I bring it to their attention and they lady said hold on I need to get a a manager. Really??? I have my receipt in front of you and you can see the order is wrong. They ended up fixing the order after I had to wait another 5 minutes. As I'm sitting there looking around I realize there are 6 employees on their break eating. Don't get me wrong everyone is entitled to their break but when there is a long line of people then perhaps that many people shouldn't be able to go at once. The third time I came was in drive thru again. Omg. The girl couldn't get my order right even after repeating it 3 times. I ordered 3 separate items with the third one being a chicken strip meal. At no time did she ask me what side item I wanted or my drink. I sat there waiting to see if she would ask. She hands me the bag and tries to send me off. I ask her what about my side and drink?? Don't you want to know what I want? She said oh I rang it up as ala carte.  I looked at her and explained the whole conversation and said I wanted mash potatoes. Can she please give it to me and I'll pay for it. She ended up giving it to us for free but it still doesn't make up for the bad customer service. 

When I brought the chicken home it was a bit undercooked. 


If you want chicken and don't mind canes then go there. If you have your heart set on Popeyes then drive a little further to the one on Craig road. Trust me it will be worth the drive.

I first asked for 10 pieces of chicken tenders with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy...the ignorant girl at the drive-thru said they didn't have a 10 piece combo so she couldn't serve me 10 pieces....I reiterated my question and said ""do you guys sell your chicken tenders individually?"" She said yes...I then said ""ok, so could you ring me up for an individual chicken tender 10 times on your computer?"" 
She answered ""no, because it will be more expensive this way."" 
I asked for 10 pieces of chicken in every single way possible and I NEVER got my ten pieces of chicken. 

On top of that, the gravy was literally just gravy flavored, brown water. I didn't notice until
I got home and opened up the order...I called the store and asked them if they had changed their gravy recipe and the drive-thru attendant said to me ""no, it's just like that cause of the delivery truck...all of the Popeyes are the same right now."" 
Which was a complete lie!! I had to finally go get my mashed potatoes and gravy at a different store and they had the original Popeyes gravy (which I find to be delicious). I simply can not believe this store was just simply watering their gravy down and then lying to customers saying all Popeyes were like that. As a franchise, they are supposed to stand behind their product and not WATER DOWN their gravy!!

   This past Sunday evening on July 10 I had just returned from hiking up and down Cathedral Rock. Just like the Yelp ratings did to this Popeyes, the 1,000 plus elevation change gave my stamina a beating. By the time I returned to Las Vegas and exited off US 95 onto Durango Drive, my hunger had kicked in. In this hungry state I pulled into the Popeyes parking lot. 

  When I walked inside Popeye's,  there were only a couple of customers. I don't know if it is the bad Yelp ratings or just a slow Sunday evening that caused the lobby to be nearly empty. All I know was that I decided on the two piece chicken meal with a side, biscuit, and medium Coke beverage. The woman who took my order was pleasant. She was pleasant to the point that when the other customer decided she did not want the green beans, she exchanged it without a problem. However if the woman that took my order was rude or extraordinary nice, I was cognizant of the Popeyes signs and table brochures inviting me to take a brief survey by calling 1-800-682-0219 or visiting www.tellpopeyes.com. Likewise when I walked into the restaurant my first impression was Popeye's gives the perception of taking customer service seriously by posting a sign on the door with the store manager's name and a phone number. 

  Right off the bat (or in this case you could say right off the bone), I noticed that Popeye's does something different that quite a few chicken restaurants don't. This difference is that their customer can choose any two kinds of chicken from the wing, thigh, or leg. I chose the thigh and leg spicy crispy with Cajun rice. I realized that ordering the thigh was a mistake because the wing was far superior. The wing was a large size portion of white delectable chicken meat. After this mistake, I will order two chicken wings the next time I return to Popeye's. As far as the Cajun rice, I have been a fan of it going back as the 1980s when Popeye the Sailor Man was the official mascot of Popeye's Chicken. Complimenting the chicken and Cajun rice was my favorite all-time drink Fanta Strawberry soda. This post-hiking supper came out to less than $8.

  Now in my car and headed toward Durango Drive, I observed that the drive-thru business was busy. Whether or not my three stars will rejuvenate Popeye, I don't know. What I do know is that eating in this Popeye's rejuvenated Me after hiking up and down Cathedral Rock.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,11,3,MfzJ2WuO3iZXEUpUtSxFzQ

Over cooked, dry, very small and hardly any meat! Where is the quality control? They should not have served this chicken! Actually it was so small I thought it might have been pigeon! 

Everything else was good.

Well when I finally got home my shrimp po boy was spilled all over the bag. It's the most sloppy sandwich I've had. The bread is dry it's kinda hard. It just looks like they put no effort into it. Super dissapointed.

Whaaaaat!!!!

Just spent the most on popeys chicken in one stop ever... $12 for 8 pieces. Yup, it's tuesday, but no 2 for 1.25 here. Really? Ok that's fine...just go to another one next time right? Guess living in Centennial Hills means we can afford a whole meal... we like deals too.  Gas or food, gas or food... Damn V8.

It's clean in here though. Better be for a brand new spot. Customer service is good(training paid off). Let's see how long that lasts. Wait time was bleh... Drive thru lines is mad crazy... 

It's nice to have one just down the street, but I think we all should get the same deal as well... got everyone here juked.",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,17,9,3,zkX3aLETWUzvtOkEvy77aA

When I received my 8 piece dark they were serious about it being dark! It seemed as if they recooked it a few times because it was old and cold. It had looked AND tasted as if it had been left from yesterday and they needed to refry and serve it. When it came to the 5 piece tender combo I ordered, I got 3.5 pieces. That being 3 were full pieces, looked to be broken in half and I was just plain missing the 5th piece. And my side of fries ended up being mashed potatoes I didn't order more want! When I called 6x back to back to try and speak with a manager, the phone just rang.

5987566,2016-09-22,0,VPO8pBUwYz1u6GoG0d2U-Q,"I've given this Popeyes more than just a few tries and each and every time I'm beyond disappointed. Although the food is usually good (if you can get anything you actually ordered) the service is beyond terrible/ rude. Not only do the staff mess up on every order, taking over an hour to get through the drive thru, they screw you up intentionally while laughing to the the other employees. 
The first time I came to this Popeyes I asked for extra BBQ sauce and extra honey over three times. When I looked in my bag I realized she gave me some weird spicy sauce instead of BBQ and ketchup packets instead of honey packets. She tried completely sabotaging my meal!! 
The second time I come, over an hour and a half before closing, they say they're out of chicken tenders. I had already been in line for OVER 30 MINUTES already just to be told they were out of food, then proceeded to be stuck in line FOR NOTHING for another 45 plus minutes. The entire time the kid (michael Robinson) was mocking me through the window. When I got to the window I asked ""if you can't make any more food, then what's taking 20+ minutes for each car at the window?! Makes no sense"". They're doing it on purpose! 
Third time I come to Popeyes, they only have spicy tenders (imagine that) so I try those. I see the same girl packing my food who was involved in the first incident, when I get home I realize she gave me green beans instead of mashed potatoes. Seriously on purpose again! Ruined my night once again. I should have gone back and gotten what I ordered but who wants to go out again and wait in another hour long line.?!? Oh and same day I ordered a Dr Pepper with my meal, after I already pay they tell me the Dr Pepper is gone. (Probably just too lazy to fill the machine) 
Today I go to Popeyes again but I decide to go in and make sure my order comes out correct. Out of Dr Pepper once again, when the one and only nice/ good employee there told a coworker to change the Dr Pepper, he whispered under his breath to ""shut up"". She then proceeded to tell me Dr Pepper was gone.. The same kid who was in the second incident (Michael Robinson) was taking orders in drive thru and he's laughing telling the coworkers the customer ordered half and half with blackened and mild but to give him all spicy. The girl boxing the food tells him no, stop doing that (obviously he does this often) and to stop ""fucking with the orders"". He then proceeds to tell them ""no no he ordered all spicy"" (he didn't). And I'm sure that customer was very disappointed when he got home and had all spicy chicken when he wanted mild and blackened!!! He thinks it's funny I really don't understand. SO irritating. The place was DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY as well. While eating my food there was a hair in/on my chicken. These workers are so crazy they probably put hair in people's food just for the hell of it. I'm never going to Popeyes again. These people should be fired/ sued.",q0etceAX4xx4y6WoE3ZweQ,0,0,1,WoUj4h8EZn-QH-KCuDf9ig
