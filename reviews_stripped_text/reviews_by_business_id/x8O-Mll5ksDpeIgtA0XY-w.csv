29443,2015-01-14,0,x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w,"One of the restaurants in this mighty conglomeration of restaurants, the menu/buffet offerings here is like the one located on Sahara/S Rainbow, although there are very slight differences. For example, this location had tuna sashimi and ceviche (or the Asian equivalent: a mix of seafood bits mixed with jalapenos) which I didn't see until I finished gorging myself on other items. It's not a mark down, just a lack of observation on my part.
But I want to obsess about the frog legs. They were delicious: juicy and well seasoned. And the size of the legs are pretty big. Between frog legs and lobster, I would prefer frog legs because they have a very subtle and delicate flavor. Not to say lobster on their own isn't subtle and delicate in flavor, but having eaten as much lobster as I have, frog legs are a wonderful change.
If you're repulsed by the thought of eating frog legs, here's a protip: you're at a buffet. Select one leg from the tray, and only one. Do not take 1/2 pound of legs. After returning to your table, take a bite, without any additional sauces or seasonings (salt, pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce, and so on). How's the mouthfeel? The taste? Gag reflex in check, you're not dying because you had taken a bite of a frog's leg? If you feel more seasoning is needed, season away. If you can't continue eating the frog leg, you at least tried. If you can, that's great, and get more if you like.
Service itself was spotty. I understand the nature of the business, and I'm not looking for constant interaction with the waitstaff, but nearly halfway through my first delicious plate of sushi, no one asked for my beverage order, and I eat slow. Again, I understand the nature of the business, and I think it was due to the amount of business at the time, so I'm willing to believe nothing wrong with service.
The replenishment/turnover rate of the food is fairly good, depending on what you're looking for. Of course, the more popular items will be depleted/replenished more often.
The problems I have, which doesn't reflect on the restaurant at all, are the customers. Like walking the Strip, people tend to not mind where they are, or that there could be other sentient beings nearby. Not too much of a big deal, but one wonders how self-absorbed people can be in an enclosed space.
The one difference between this and the Sahara/S. Rainbow location is that carbonated beverages are part of the bill, as opposed to an additional charge. Maybe it was a fluke, but will update if it was.",XHSG6sp-QnW5TSLgeYHm9Q,0,0,3,-edD82lCNEci4jXKnQcYfw

The staff is very friendly and they will pass by your table often to remove the plates.  Because I love seafood I go here often. It's very family friendly and usually the wait time is about three minutes. If you are arriving with a large party call ahead to reserve some tables. The decor is relaxed and comfortable booths or you can dine at the table with chairs if you choose. I prefer a booth because it gives us extra room for all of the yummy dishes we get. Asian ribs there are tasty just a bit too over cooked for me. In the back of the bufet they do offer peel and eat shrimp which sometimes can be on the pasty side. They also have delcious pepper shrimp which I love.

Pizza never has sauce it's mainly bread and cheese so I don't bother with it at all. I am not a frog leg eater. My family has said they are fried a bit hard for them. There's also baked Tilapia and Swai fish too which is delicious. The lunch isn't as great as the dinner because even though they have a good selection of the basic foods there's no seafood during lunch except fish. Because of the high turn over of guest the food is always fresh and hot. TRY IT YOU WILL BE BACKkkkkk !!",OjxsJwvJY2ArIQlDLQmIwA,0,0,5,mNsmqlCygXy6t3tcRp1QNw
918527,2011-01-16,0,x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w,"I've eaten at the Rainbow/Sahara location several times, and although it's not the greatest food, I've considered it OK for the price (lunch was recently $6.99, 7 days a week there, but now up to $7.29). This location, at Flamingo and Eastern was $8.29 for Saturday lunch. We actually wanted to go to Thai Spice (4 stars), but it was closed for remodeling. We then though we'd go to FUJI (4 stars) down at Tropicana & Pecos, one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Vegas, but apparently they changed their weekend hours, so we finally ended up here instead.

First off, I got a sense of overall ""ickiness"" the minute we walked in. There's just a humid, sticky sort of feeling inside, and when we were seated, the booth had loose seat-back and the table was dirty and sticky. The first thing I got was a bowl of Won-ton soup, which I had to load with salt & pepper, because it had no sense of flavor whatsoever. My kids said the same thing about the egg drop soup. The Pad Thai noodles were flavorless as well. Everything I ate had the same sort of greasy, flavorless, coating to it. Seeing Pizza, French Fries, and Fish Sticks is just a joke - shame on the spineless parents who can't get their kid to experience something other than fast food/junk food.

I also noticed meat just pulled from the freezer being used at the Mongolian station, in thick, frozen blocks, not even thawed. Not safe - won't be cooked through all the way. Also, up above the kitchen, up on a shelf with some decorations, I spotted a food prep bucket...catching a leak maybe?

Anyway, I'll never go back to this place, and probably will not frequent the other location as often either. I'd rather pay $8/$9 for a smaller portion of enjoyable food, than this all-you-can-eat slop.",i6ta0Jjyl-bFbG_yxPSWNg,1,0,1,YlT2J2HCUhOcKWR2haz7iQ

942225,2013-08-25,5,x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w,"The worst Asian buffet that I been to. To start off, I knew this would be a bad experience the moment I stepped in the door and pay. We came with a big group (17 people) and decided to split into 3 separate groups to avoid the automatic 12% gratuity fee. However, when I tried to pay with my credit card and it got decline, the lady was already giving me attitude. Tossed my card back and gave me an ugly frown. Also, they have senior discount, but it hardly counts for anything because its only $1 off for a senior discount! 

Anyways, we got seated, took our drink orders, and went to get food. My brother and aunt were both vegetarian and soon found out that the place hardly had any veggie food so they decided to asked for a refund. Again, the lady at the cashier gave us a hard time again. She finally gave the refund for my brother and aunt after a bit of argument but charged us $5 for the two drinks that they never even touched. At that point we were really pissed, but hungry so decided to stay. My brother and aunt left to eat somewhere else. 

The food was TERRIBLE. Only 4 soup available, no hot and sour soup or crab soup (thats funny because almost all Asian buffet would have one of these), Tom Yum soup was very bland and tasted like water. They had mongolian BBQ so I decided to try that out. Waited almost 20 minute to get the food and was very unhappy. My noodle and meat were overcooked and burnt. My corn and veggie were undercooked and still raw. Their ice-cream was also terrible, watered out and disgusting. 

Service was horrible. The entire time I was there, I noticed none of the workers ever smiled. The waiters/waitress came by to pick up our dirty plates but never once did they asked us for a refill even though they clearly saw our empty soda cups.

If you want good Asian food, go somewhere else. This buffet is meant to serve mostly Non-Asian people (I saw mostly Hispanics) who doesn't really understand what real Asian food taste like (No offense to them).  

In short, food and service was extremely terrible.",GCdNe3Z-xsHCGTNZIVq2pA,2,1,1,RTVBhk8Fdkxj3V7EzYYHqg

What brings it down to 1 star is the incredibly rude service even for Chinese restaurants (and I'm chinese). Worst service I've ever encountered in my life. Someone in my party ordered soda for everyone. I wanted only water and asked a nearby waitress for an extra cup of water. She gave me the stank eye right away and demanded in a very rude tone ""Where's your ticket?"" I was like ""Wtf are you talking about? I need a ticket for water?"" Then she said with a really mean face ""I already got you your drinks, 1 more is going to cost you extra."" After some back and forth she finally got the message that all I wanted was a cup of water and not another soda. Seriously? I had to get into a near fight with a waitress and make the rest of my party uncomfortable over a cup of ####ing water? I'm surprised she didn't slam the cup of water on my table. She probably spit in it or something. 

I was so pi##ed over the whole thing that I wrote a note of complaint and dropped it in their tip box. I was literally fuming the rest of the day and this review is pretty much the first thing I did after getting back from my Vegas trip. They deserve this bad review wholeheartedly.

The problem is that owners are so cheap that they write the number of your party on a tiny #ss little fortune cookie slip of paper. You're supposed to put that slip on your table and waitresses use it to give you the right amount of drinks. This little piece of paper can fly away easily or slip underneath the table. Waitresses literally demand for that slip of paper before giving you drinks. I'd give it 0 stars if yelp let me because of the cheap owners and waitresses with serious attitude problems.

But then there's the food...the sushi was a hidden gem. Have I had better? Of course...even and especially in Vegas. But for the money, that was worth the trip alone. Great variety, fresh, even a few things with some imagination. The cooked food was also pretty good; there was nothing on my plate I didn't finish or that was prepared poorly. It was greasy, but I've been to greasier. So the food was 4/5.

Service was...okay. I've had worse even at a buffet. I've also had better. 3/5. 

So, all in all, it kind of averages out to a 3/5. If they took a weekend and scrubbed, fixed the bathroom, got new windows and fixed the tables (and tried some kind of ambience?) the place could easily be rated much higher.",gHEKFO_C1_xtEkaX3rnuIg,0,0,3,CgTeNN2in8P2H2u-9k_Wtw

I came on a weekday last week for the first time and it's not the same. Do yourself a favor and come on the seafood days. If I went on weekdays my review might be different. 
I've read most of the reviews and it seems most people are giving them a low raising because their service is THE WORST. I completely agree. Their service is complete trash. But their food is heavenly. They pretty much don't care.
If their service was better I believe the would have 5 stars. 
Their sushi is the best bugger sushi I've ever had and usually buffet sushi is terrible. The spicy shrimp is to die for. Actually one of my all time favorite foods. I crave them constantly.

Buffet @ Asia offers a huge large selection Asian food from seafood (clams, muscles, crab), Chinese food (stir fries, orange chicken, hot and sour soup...), to any Asian food you may be craving (pad Thai, sushi). They even have Mongolian Barbecue! 

The restaurant gets really crowded and service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant; a buffet at that!  Waiters were always refilling drinks and taking away plates.

I got a couple plates- chow mein, fried rice, chicken on a stick (i really dont know what it was called), a few other things... and everything was average.

The dessert was average... below actually. I got this little cake with pink frosting on top. No real flavor to it. What I think was ambrosia... but it was nothing but marshmallows (isn't it supposed to have fruit?), and a soft serve. The texture was... off, but the taste was ok.

At under $9 for lunch and under $15 for dinner, why not? The food isn't bad and once you've found your favorites, you'll find that the quality is consistent whenever you come in. 

The value of this place is reason enough to try it. Thai iced tea is a free drink option and I've heard beer is as well (just ask). Even at lunch there is plenty of seafood, beef, and chicken.

Dinner isn't too different from lunch, but the addition of crab legs is definitely something worthy of coming here after 3pm. Either way, the food... tasty!

Unless you get the Mongolian BBQ the food never really tasted completely fresh. So, I'd be hesitant to eat the sushi.

Although, this place has potential. I'd be willing to pay $10-12 if they stepped it up a little. Fresher food, a little cleaning/renovation (has an old school feel) maybe.

Lastly, for the price it might have been an enjoyable experience if they refused service to the lady sitting next to us (horrible body odor).",yWhVz6DPCQWZBpb0CRsjhA,0,0,4,xo7AAp_n21sq_T-we9Un4Q

It turns out that this location wasn't too bad, depending on what you ate, but the majority looked decent and safe to eat. They had a soup, hot foods, sushi and Mongolian BBQ section. The sushi was surprisingly good and when I ran out of stuff to eat, I opted for the Mongolian BBQ where you select the veggies, meats and sauces you want and have them stir fry it for you. Weekday lunch was about 10 bucks including tax.

The dining area, however, was super crowded and old looking. There were a bunch of fatties and weird looking people but I'm sure that's common just because of the side of town we were on. When I first walked in I immediately noticed that I was the only Asian customer which made me think the food was going to be terrible so I was definitely glad that it turned out being ok.

I finish my first plate and go for a second. Still no cream for my coffee, nor is there a duplicate receipt at my table. I try to get her attention, but she's ignoring me.

After 30 mins she finally brings the cream, but now duplicate receipt, but now my coffee is cold. I asked again...... I was a bit pissed, but I don't mind ice coffee and poured the coffee into the excess ice leftover from my water. 

Finally they brought out the crab and I grabbed a big plate full. I sit at my table and eat a couple of legs. The waitress and the manager come over to my table and say that CRAB IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO PAID FOR DINNER. I STATED I PAID FOR DINNER AND PAID YOU PERSONALLY IN CASH. DID YOU FORGET ALREADY. I ASKED FOR A RECEIPT, BUT YOUR LAME AS WAITRESS TOOK IT AND REFUSED TO GIVE ME A DUPLICATE. I WAS LIVID! WE WERE YELLING AT EACH OTHER. THE MANAGER ASKED ME TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $5. I REFUSED.

I went for lunch ($9.95 total with tax) on a monday afternoon around 1:30. You would think the place would not be that busy but it was packed as usual. 

Like other visits in the past, their set up has not changed. You have 4 islands. One is usually designated the sushi bar (not very good imo). Another is the fruits/dessert bar (its ok). While the other two are main entrees like fried rice, soup, wings, beef ribs, steamed fish, fried squid, peppered beef, green beans, and pot stickers. These items mentioned are what I usually get because they are actually decent.

So the food quality is still the same. Not awesome by any means, but good enough for me to consume and be satisfied. Originally when I first tried these guys a couple years ago, the lunch price was only 7 bucks. My how times have changed. The dinner price is usually about 3 to 4 dollars more because they have crab legs.

Service is ok and it shouldnt be any worse. Heck, you are getting up to get your own food. All they need to do is get your drink and clean up your excess dishes. Nevertheless I still at least put down a dollar for tip as long as they are consistent.

The minus 2 stars are mainly for the price increase and the bathroom. Im sure they try to keep it clean but those idiot vandals always seem to write stuff on the walls, mirrors, sinks, etc with sharpies or with something actually sharp to engrave it. Sometimes I come in there to find that there is no more soap or paper towels. Also they will charge you if you get too much food and then dont eat much of it.

To put it in perspective, I will still come here occasionally just to switch things up a bit but due to the increasing prices, the timeframe in between each visit is gonna get longer and longer. As long as the masses keep coming here, they will continue to raise it until they notice attendance starts going down. Its all about supply and demand.

It is what it is.  What do you expect when you go to an all you can eat buffet that is only 8 bucks for lunch and 13.00 for dinner.  If you want stellar service, food, and ambiance then go to the Wynn or Bellagio, that's what you're paying the 40.00 bucks for! 

I swear this is like a tourist attraction for my fam and I bc we go here every time we are in town visiting my aunt and uncle .  It's not too far from the strip by car because really who wants to walk anywhere in that heat.  It offers a huge selection of Asian cuisine from seafood, to the mongolian style bbq, and sushi (not sure if I would touch the raw fish here but the crabmeat should be fine!).  While some dishes are hit or miss, I did like most of it especially the dumplings, fried chicken wings, Chinese donuts, shrimp, crab rangoon, and garlic tilapia.  I think they have crab legs only for dinner or the weekend?  The service and environment are fine, they take your drink orders and your dirty plates away, what more do you need?

The place was fairly packed on a Sunday night. This is usually a good sign.

I don't know. I just wasn't all that impressed. They do have quite the selection of food there. There was much more variety than I was expecting. The quality of the food was just so-so at best.

The skewers were, by far, my favorite item here. The meat was nice and juicy and was almost falling off the stick. I tore thru my share of those things! They have a Mongolian Beef station that was unmanned, so I really didn't try that out. 

They have planty of your standard Asian staples liek fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken and so forth. They also have fresh fruits available. I grabbed a bunch of strawberries and grapes and some honey dew to boot.
 

The tom yum was too sweet , though. I couldn't finish that.  Tried frog legs here for the first time. Tatsed very similar to chicken(really!), just a bit ""chewier"" lol I'm not sure how to put that!

The inside is a little on the dingy side and the have some odd decor(like a disco ball). I guess they rent out part of the space for parties. lol I don't know who or why someone would want to rent out this space ....but okay...whatever floats your boat.

For the price I paid, I just wasn't overly impressed. Much of the food seemed rather bland. I may go back one day, because my friend seemed to like it, but I don't see myself going out of my way to come back.

I was terrified to try this place based on some of the reviews, but it was our first night in town, we were exhausted from the 5 hour drive, and we were craving something Asian/seafood near our hotel at Hyatt Place. So we came at dinner time and paid $14 per person. Drinks included. Booze is extra. 

They have a large selection of Asian food, seafood and sushi. It isn't ""large"" like the Rio buffet where you will find food from every part of the world, but a decent amount of options within the Asian food genre. It all tasted pretty good, made by Asian cooks, which meant that something like the fried rice had better flavor than the fried rice at even the ""fancier"" buffets on the Strip! What comes with buffets tends to be a lower standard of food quality, so don't compare the sushi to an Omakase restaurant, but I would eat here again! The calamari, pad thai, sashimi, and crawfish were amongst the things I tried and enjoyed. I recommend getting the sweet and sour sauce to dip the crispy calamari into. I love that there was a Mongolian BBQ section as well, but was too preoccupied with the ready food to try it out. 

I wasn't concerned about the cleanliness of the restaurant as it didn't look like any sanitary violations occurred. The food was hot, fresh, and tasty which matters more to me. In my opinion with ethnic food, the grungy-walled places had the best tasting authentic food, and this place wasn't even dirty. If you're looking for a bourgeois ambiance then please go eat at the Paris buffet instead. If you would like to save $12, try this place out! It's a good selection of foods, typical fried Asian fare, and decent enough to please my mom and 2 aunts (who also went crazy over the fried banana there).

When we got to the buffet, we were sat all the way in the back of the restaurant, in a dirty two seater booth, which was right next to the garbage, the dishwashing station, and the soda dispenser. We asked nicely to be moved to another table so they took us into the other room and made us stand in the middle of everyone holding our plates and drinks. After much confusion, we decided to move to a table next to our original one that was a little bit cleaner. That was just the beginning of a bad experience. The food was okay, typical chinese buffet food - nothing special. We both love sushi, so we were happy to see that they had a good selection. However, all of the sushi was sitting under hot lights!! It definitely was not safe to eat! Then, while we were eating, a family was sat behind us. About five minutes later, the waiters came running over to their table telling them that they needed to pay more (for an infant)! They were going back and forth until the family decided they would just pay for the baby so they could just be left alone. It was extremely distracting, uncomfortable, and awkward. The waiters were incredibly rude, laughing at the family and mocking them. Overall, it was an awful experience.

Go to this place STRICTLY for the quantity of food, not quality... it's a buffet after all.  It's inexpensive and an abundance of food, but don't expect too much as far has having an authentic, high quality food.  You can definitely pay a little bit more somewhere else and have better buffet food.  

They had Mongolian BBQ, which was alright.  Their Sushi Bar was ""eh,"" and the Chinese food was just okay.  I did like the variety of fruits (it was fresh) and Jell-O but who doesn't like Jell-O?

My boyfriend and I came in a half an hour before closing so we already knew not to expect much. We walked in and the ladies at the front counter told us to look inside at the food because they would not be bringing any new food out, which was fair enough. We said it was fine and they gave us a discount which was nice of them since we did not expect them to do so. They quickly showed us to our seats and then we took off to the food. 

After rushing to bring back our food to the table our server asked us for the receipt and I told her that we paid at the front already but if she wanted my receipt was somewhere in my bag and I would gladly find it for her. I knew all the servers were eager to get out of there, they were all sitting in the back and looking at us so I was looking in my bag in a hurry and it took me a few minutes to find it (it was in the side pocket of course lol). During this whole time she looked at me with a disgusted look and kept talking to her coworkers in Chinese. I swear she was thinking we never paid in the first place. I finally found it and she was like.. 'it says one' and then gave me another disgusted look. I told her it was a discounted price for two meals. Bad communication from front counter to servers I guess. 

Anyways, the food was pretty good. The sushi was not fresh of course as well as other food but it was closing so I wouldn't mark down for that. All in all, the food was over all, good!

It was the servers that really made me upset about this place. When the table next to us all left, one of the servers rushed over to the table, counted the tip of three dollars and threw it back on the table. She shouted to her coworkers 'three dollars' and other words in Chinese and started laughing. Her doing that in front of all her customers was not cool at all.

We left in a hurry, since all 15 workers were staring at us hahaha. No 'thank you' or 'good bye'. Weird. LOL whatever.",YTl5q-1rvWGqtPs1bX7-hQ,8,2,1,ftgiEnK5CT7mx5IEqs147w

The service here Is tremendously average, servers and bussers don't smile , I get a "".what do you want to drink."" At least say it in question form ? lol. But the main reason i took a star off is wrong or lazy drink orders , if i ask for water with lemon and you agree to that and then you come back with water with out lemon that's a problem. It's either you were not actually listening to me, or your just plain too lazy to put a lemon wedge in my water. Besides that we still keep coming back and that's because of the food! The food carries this restaurant on its back. One of their most popular dishes that they serve is their ox tail soup ! super rich and beefy broth, good size chunks of ox tail. Delish! They also have a wide variety of sushi here and not just your average California rolls with imitation crab, they have actual tuna ,salmon, and clam  nigiri ! Along with some impressive sushi rolls , especially for a buffet it's quite surprising. But there is one more thing that bothers me and that's the actual upkeep of the restaurant, I remember being seated and one of the bus persons was clearing off a table and ended up dropping and breaking a glass Tabasco bottle , they cleaned it swept a little bit and sat us but I could clearly see glass on the floor and that was annoying but whatever.

It's a bit off the strip, but well worth the drive.  There is quite a bit of seating, and they were really busy at 1pm. We were seated pretty quickly, and our drink orders were taken. We didn't really see the waitress again unless she was clearing plates or filling drinks, which is pretty good for a buffet to be honest. 

The buffet itself is quite big. There is sushi (surprisingly good), peet'n'eat crawfish, grilled fish, a few kinds of soups, quite a few fried and tasty fish dishes, salad, veggies, fruit, and desserts to go along with the normal staples at an Asian buffet. I would say it is more seafood heavy than non, but there is plenty of food for anyone to eat and get full on. 

The biggest surprise was the sushi. It wasn't the usual, buffet sushi with dry rice, but it was actually made with a good amount of care. Fresh, moist and flavorful.

4063531,2017-02-27,4,x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w,"4/5 Location:

The location of this place is right on the corner of Eastern and Flamingo. It is at a very busy intersection, but is very easy to find and getting in and out of the parking lot isn't usually a problem. They have a good size parking lot, but it does get filled very quickly during lunch and dinner hours. I never have had a problem finding a spot to park, even if I had to park out a ways. 

4/5 Food:

Food is your typical Asian buffet food. Noodles, rice, various meats, sushi, soups, fruit, dessert and so forth. Come early if you want fresh food. They do constantly bring out new food, but if you come during Lunch or Dinner hours, you may have to wait for the popular items. Almost every time I've been here, I've not been able to get any of the crab legs. People will come and get food like that and not just get a few, but several plates full of crab or shrimp!! Food that I typically would get, would be tasty and fresh, but on occasions I've seen dry out food and food that didn't look so appetizing. Not the best food, but for the price and seeing it's a buffet, I would come back again. 

3/5 Service:

Not sure if it's because they don't really speak good English, but most of the staff are so unfriendly. They have one person that seats you and takes your order. She never had a smile on her face and she was so monotone. The waitress/waiter are no better. They don't talk to you, just bring your drinks and or refill them (mind you, they don't ask if you want refills either) and of course they come often to pick up dirty plates. They are definitely there just to do their job and nothing more.  

1/5 Ambiance:

Building is old inside and out. Everything is outdated. Tables are old and wobbly for the most part. Many of the booths are falling apart and are hard to sit on. Don't look like anything has been updated since this place was built. Kind of smelly also. Bathrooms are almost always dirty and not well stocked with the essentials. 

Please note, my review is based off of when I lived there a year ago. Things may have changed since I was last there.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,12,7,3,jkN5711A6kUdAblV7GuFgQ

The service is also great, but If you can help it, avoid sitting at the booths - they are tattered and weirdly arranged in relation to the table.

So, since I dont have two kids, I usually sit at the edge of the seat, and take it from there.  So yeah, if you can help it, sit at a table. 

Anyways, the food is good, but again - hit or miss.  Sometimes their sesame balls are soft, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes the beef is tender, sometimes chewy.  Sometimes the sushi is fresh....you get what I mean.

When my family and I arrived, the cashier was on her cell, playing a game. I had to interrupt, after standing there and not being acknowledged (should of walked out, THIS should have been a clue). 

We were 4 adults, 1 child, & infant (no charge), totaled to almost $90. We were then escorted to sit in TWO booths (isle separating me from my kids). Requested we have somewhere we could ALL sit together (she seemed agitated that I asked). We were then walked to a larger booth (someone was sitting there, an employee), he was waved to get off (which, made me feel bad). I asked to be seated in the area where there were tables and she said, ""that section is closed"", so, we had to take the booth. The table was not cleaned, so we cleaned it as best we could.

The restaurant states they close at 10pm (we arrived at 9pm). In resturants we have been before, 10pm would be the time to stop letring people in, we figured we had about an hour to eat. My husband was able to eat a serving when our infant child had woken up, so my husband started feeding him. When he was done feeding our child, he went to get food. The staff had started to pick up the food. The waitress approached us as we were trying to get food and said, ""pick up all the food you want and take to the table"" (we were noticing that employees had packed the sushi in to-go containers, along with other food). I ask my daughter what time it was, it seemed that an hour had passed quickly, it was 9:35pm (and, it started smelling like Pine-Sol and other cleaning chemicals). At this point, I got upset. I went to ask for the manager and, according to Ingrid (she was the one who seated us), the manager had left. I asked for who was in charge, she said that there was no one, she offered to help. I told her to  all her manager, I wanted money some back (can't ask for all of it back, we were able to grab some food). The manager was unable to talk because ""his battery was low"". I was getting more upset AND agitated at them!!!! I said that my husband and kids were NOT done. That if 10pm is there closing time, WHY are they picking everything up early!!! According to the waitress that approached us earlier, she said that ""because it was slow"". I could NOT believe it!!!! I said that how were we supposed to know that 10pm meant only when they were busy!!! And, if that was the case, WHY not tell us when we walked in. We would have walked right out!!! Ingrid was very apologetic, she understood why I was so upset, but that I needed to call the next day for the manager. The waitress that approached us said that the only thing they could do was offer two to-go containers. She asked me to follow her into the kitchen (which I did and almost fell, very slippery. AND, as I am trying to catch my balance, saw a child in the kitchen), she was offering the food that was pilled one over the other. I just looked at her and said, ""seriously, THIS is what you want me to take?"". She said, ""Yes, there's shrimp. Shrimp is good for you"". I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!! I was done. I no longer cared about anything, other than just getting out of there....

I showed up 45 minutes before closing time and the lady up front said I was still able to stay and eat but the chefs stopped cooking the food so I basically had to settle for the food that was leftover which was cool because there was more then enough to feed this beast. The only thing that I had a problem with which is very common in Asian restaurants was the horrible customer service. The staff was so eager to go home that they rushed us out of the restaurant. They must have asked if we were done about 5 times and started to clean and get rid of all the food before we even got done eating. I thought the staff was very rude and unprofessional.

Got it covered. Buffet at Asia isn't special or better from the rest (except for that awful China Star. Todai is actually awesome, though).  My parents love this place, I've developed some animosity towards this establishment. It's loud, full of elderly Filipino people who think they're dining at Spago, and kinda gross.

Food wise, it's generic with a few bright spots at best. I avoid the deep-fried shit because I feel they use the same oil for everything. Desserts and meat cooked in the same fryer. Ugh. So I stick to their steamed white fish in soy sauce with green onions. Desserts? I stick to their fresh fruit and avoid their nasty ice cream station that sweaty kids flock to. Expecting great service at Buffet at Asia is like asking a fat kid to not touch a bowl of candy. It ain't gonna happen; servers are there to refill drinks, give straws and utensils.

It was before the airport and it was Vegas, so you know we were beat.

But it was nice to get away from the strip, take a romp in the desert and see what life really is like in Nevada. And we found Buffet Asia. Our my friend's family introduced us to Buffet Asia. The selection was generous, they had almost everything. They tried their hand at sushi, chicken strips, pizza, BBQ pork, steamed buns, orange chicken, miso soup... anything under the sun. Basically, any food that you have seen Asian-ized, they have it. It's been noted that their selections revolve and they offer a huger seafood selection, then they do regularly.

By buffet standards, I would go here. The food is not great, but it's good. It serves it's purpose, you get what you came for and you do definitely leave full. Service as to be expected, is uninspired and borderline rude... but when you are dealing with hungry people who are getting full... couldn't you smile? Cultured people could bypass this by supplying tips, I'm sure. You are lucky that you don't have to deal with them on a regular basis... and you get your own food.

I came here several times during the 2 years I lived in Vegas. Not my number one place to come, but it was a good choice when I was craving some Asian food. 

Looking at the building from the outside, you wouldn't think this place would be any good. The building is very old and outdated. The inside also is old. Old tables that wabble and benches that have holes in the seats and are loose. Flooring is old and looks as though it has never been replaced. The decor is old and not very tasteful. It's like they didn't put any effort into making the atmosphere very inviting. 

Putting that aside, they have LOTS of food to choose from at this buffet! They have stuff from noodles, rice, lots of different meats, sushi, salad, fruit, desserts, American food like pizza, chicken nuggets, fries, etc. I'm not one to venture outside of what I know when it comes to food, so I pretty much didn't have any of the meat except for chicken and fish. If you want fresh and hot food, come when they first open. They do continue to refill pans with food during the day, but sometimes I've been here and food has been sitting for awhile so it's gotten dried out and not so tasty anymore. Also, if you want crab legs or shrimp, come and get it right when you get there as there are so many people that don't think of others and fill plates upon plates of just those items. I've hardly ever been able to get shrimp or crab legs cause no sooner they refill it, and the pans are empty!!

Peeps all up in my grill tryin' to sell me oranges at the back of trucks, stands selling necklaces, beads, and all sort of other home made jewelry. Come on Buffet of Asia, get this crap out of your parking lot if you wanna attract business!  But then again it's not the nicest location so I wasn't surprised.

It is not the greatest looking restaurant and most will probably pass by it without ever giving it thought but for what it is, it's a pretty decent buffet with a big selection.  Here's what I found good in there: Beef Pepper, Fried Squid, Oysters, Scallops, Chicken Jalapeno, Ribs, Sea Food Salad and some sort of fried crispy crab.

Even playing angry birds on my iphone couldn't get my mind how disgusted I was using a public restroom to take a deuce with my conscience repeatedly saying how much I regret in eating those sushi! 

The crowd inside is a mixture of ""Fresh off the Border"" Hispanics and ""Fresh off the Boat"" Asians. This is not the place where you would want to bring a date and because of the fact that its kinda dirty with loud ass people.  Especially these group of filipinos. Loud ass hell, laughing off the top of their lungs, and just hanging out in large numbers blocking walkways. Sadly I'm talking about my group of friends haha, the group of girls we have with us are always the loudest everywhere we go.

I'm not sure if they got rid of the Mongolian grill, but it wasn't up on our visit and that's always safe for me to go to when I'm in doubt.

The sweet and sour chicken, potstickers, cream cheese rangoon, and peel and eat shrimp were edible. And I actually liked the asparagus and of course, as always, the doughnuts. Overall, everything looked just cluttered in the restaurant and the food wasn't getting regular rotations at the buffet.

Our server was consistently behind with removing plates and with refills. She also could be a world class poker player as she didn't change her expression or demeanor the whole time we were there.

Our family will choose to go Buffet @ Asia again. But I'll just make sure we go to the Rainbow or Eastern location.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,6,2,2,DAiHVJt-M_ts-FxLBiynpw

Place is dirty with a poor selection of food. Most of their food in the buffet trays have that 3 hour old film on it, definitely not fresh ... and not the tasty. If I was desperate for food on the corner of Flamingo & Eastern again, I'd rather eat at the McDs across the intersection. Their so-called mongolian BBQ is just meat & 4 or 5 veggies and the cooks are sloppy and flick everyone elses stuff into your bowl (I'm allergic to seafood, so not much here for me to eat). There are always hugh families with 20 to 30 unattended screaming children and babies running amok putting their germ riddle fingers in all the trays and ice cream.

 Being from MD, we should have know better. They were tasteless, cold and mushy. The sushi was good, other food items were delicious. They even have frog legs for the adventurous type.  I tried but didn't like very much. Upon leaving I started to feel I'll. By the time I got to the car, the feeling like I was going vomit came over me.

So far this one is the best.  Notice I did not say that it was good.  But you get what you pay for,  I went for Saturday dinner and I was not dissapointed.  
The sushi and sashimi came out fresh and there is a stir-fry station where you can have a cook prepare it for you.  That is a nice option at a buffet.  
My only down point was that the salad was wilted and warm.  I know most people don't go to an Asian buffet for salad but I like to mix in some roughage.  
The staff is not very ""smiley"", but there were quick to remove my empty plates and refill my diet coke.
So far if i had to return to one buffet in Vegas it will be this one.  Please see other posts for reviews on other buffets.",1Qca4FtV1tUp-WZz9APgzA,1,0,3,cdhM7x74pB0s8dqZhRImGw

Entrance: Courteous professional cashier. You prepay beforehand. Clean front lobby. 

Ambiance: Casual, typical all you can eat buffet. 

Price: For the price, you can't beat this spot. All you can eat Chinese buffet. 

Food and quality: We're regulars at this restaurant as well as the location on Nellis. There is a very nice selection of dishes to choose from. The sushi bar offers a variety of different selections. The quality of food is very good and tasty. Just take what you can eat only and don't waste the food because they frown upon that. 

Service:  The service is decent and don't expect to hold a conversation with the servers. They're there to bring your drinks and napkins and refills. It's very busy at lunch and dinner at this location. So basically you just need to eat, get full and go about your business. 

Overall, I would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual all you can eat Chinese buffet with good tasting quality dishes especially for the price. Great for bringing a big family or group.",Yny4tKfTnLHjMJ75dXPQ-Q,0,0,4,4zvJII3lff9eZRQ9J0DHtA

The place is always packed and that's not a good thing. People are crammed in here like sardines and on a hot day with limited air conditioning capacity, it sucks. It was hot and uncomfortable, combine that with a cramped setting and hot plates and I was not a happy camper. Service was fair. Better than most Asian buffets I've been to in the past, but the food just wasn't good. It all seemed to be sitting on the line too long, which was weird since there were so many people, you'd thing the turnover would be quick.

Some items may not be fresh because they are not popular, and some items may not be very tasty, and you should not go to this location for sushi or quality of service.

For the price we always enjoy the salads, the crab legs, the Mongolian BBQ, the Singapore noodles, the spicy chicken, and the mussels and clams which the clams are my absolute favorite. Give this place a chance, and if you want quality of service do not go to an authentic ethnic food buffet, as that kind of service is more a cultural thing (specifically American)",8m_Z5WrNv_Kjpv4T0yihnA,0,0,4,wE9SClsRCoZGy4DeMWm2Fg
