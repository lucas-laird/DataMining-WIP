Nothing better than escaping the Vegas heat and having a cold beer up in the mountains! :) we discovered this place a few weeks back and have returned pretty much every weekend since then. The strawberry spinach salad with shrimp is seriously something else! Definitely recommend!,xwz2ch-kdEq3DAyAJAFhmw,1,0,5,blT2WbbxYzbVx21H_0pcyA

I had a grilled cheese here.  And I apologize for being so dramatic, but this ranks among the worst grilled cheese I've ever had.  Serious. It was american cheese on white bread. Serious.  What is this a 1985 Wonder Bread commercial?

The veggie chowder was pretty good.  Super-cheesy.",lX8DqXFDfNPF5whHw4a4rA,5,1,2,w5LcIWoin0pDF_W7iIRWKQ

I had the $10 grilled cheese with stale potato chips and the tomato soup.

the grilled cheese 2/5 ehhh I wouldn't get it again
tomato soup 3.5/5 it was pretty good",fcWV1fBSupIcuCgyHiLPTw,0,0,2,s9Ga9WnHHSGcDvjpQkZbeQ

This is touted as a ""family"" resort offering a variety of kid friendly activities in both summer and winter, yet no kids menu?  Really?  There were LOTS of kids with families dining Saturday! Really you can't offer grilled cheese, or kid size burgers, chicken nuggets, etc.  Its not too much to expect, is it? I could understand if this ski resort was adults only, but it is NOT!  AND there are a lot more kids here in the winter months for tubing, etc. PLEASE PLEASE add some kid friendly meals! I don't think that is too much to expect for a venue that see's a LOT of families and children, year round!  But if alcohol is what you are looking for, it is in abundance... because that makes sense, drink then do something dangerous like skiing... but I digress.  This was NOT our first time here, but was hoping after several visits things would change, but nope!  It hasn't!",0ZpApT0cq3Kg0SIwSUKyNQ,0,0,2,SqiNz8EyvtuaI6TxnIoeag

   The Big Horn Grill is a one of a kind casual dining experience that rises above it all. Literally! Standing on the top of Lee Summit 8,000 feet above sea level and 4,000 feet above the Las Vegas Vallet in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, the Big Horn Grill brings casual dining up to the stratosphere.

   Last Sunday, my brother and I decided to try the Big Horn Grill between hiking in the bristlecone forest and riding the Mount Charleston scenic ski chairlift. This was on our radar since two weeks ago when we caught eyes on the refurbished complex. When we hiked the Bristlecone Trail last summer, the Las Vegas Ski and  Snowboard Resort with the Big Horn Grill were closed for renovation. 

   The Big Horn Grill is located on the upper floor of the ski lodge. The restaurant and bar is a dining room and patio. We joined the majority of the guests outside on the patio. This is a patio 8,000 feet up in the sky that elevates the patrons to Cloud 9. The views are off the charts mezmerizing. A frisbie golf swing away from the patio are the ski lifts that reach toward Mount Charleston. These are ski lifts that the public can pay to sightsee for $12. Meanwhile, there is spectacular sightseeing from the patio that is surrounded by ponderosa and bristlecone forests that merge with the low canopy of cumulus clouds. You are so near Mount Charleston that it seems that you can touch it. Closer than Mount Charleston were the wildhorses on the hill. The landscape of Mount Charleston is quintessential relax in nature scenery. 

The Daniel S-pectation:

    In a World where competition is 4,000 feet and over 20 miles below, I thought that I could get ripped off or overpay for mediocrity. Then there was a part of me that thought the food could be just as good as Mount Rainer and Yellowstone National Parks.

The Daniel S-perience of Big Horn Grill:

   As I explained earlier in this reporting of Big Horn Grill, the patio is unparalleled. Additionally it is twenty degrees cooler up here than Las Vegas. When it was summer down in Vegas it was Spring up here. 

  I ordered the $13 Yeti Burger with fries and a Pepsi. For a restaurant in the wilderness, I was impressed that they only charge $2 for a Pepsi. I was even more impressed with the Yeti Burger. In all truth, it was just good as many of the burger grills on the Strip. The Yeti Burger is a half pounder all beef burger with saut√©ed mushrooms and swiss cheese. The texture and temperature of the burger was just the way I like it. The fries were also good. Owing to the fact that the scenery is as good as it gets, an extra star was called for. Regardless, the burger is worthy of 3.5 stars. By the way, here is an unimportant fact: Yeti means abominable snowman. Now here is an important fact: Big Horn Grill is a full service restaurant where a waitress serves your food. Our waitress was pleasant at the exact time that she wasn't overly friendly. Here is one more fact: this is an appropriate place for families and dogs. I saw a few guests with dogs. One dog was even drinking out of a dog bowl.

Conclusion:

   Sitting outside in the Spring Mountains National Conservation Area overlooking Mount Charleston while taking bites of a delicious Yeti Burger is a dining experience that rises above it all. Another way of saying that Big Horn Grill is 4 stars. Big Horn Grill is also advantageous for hikers that prefer to maximize their time in nature instead of leaving leaving cloud 9 to have dinner in the city. Big Horn Grill put my brother and I in a position that after a hike, we rested up and dined nearby, then walked a few steps to experience scenic ski chair ride. In conclusion, I might return for lunch or just to enjoy a cold beer on cloud 9.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,9,4,JKzMMhqmAurBeTyCDlw2jg

I just wanted to post this for people so they know.",XkPQcKkGkZH-US8osDp5vg,6,0,4,ony1vqPWnhLdi0Na8-D3jw

Aside from the obvious issue above, the service was a bit slow, actually really slow. It was about 35 min to get the chips and salsa we ordered. Drink order was wrong and one of the burgers came out wrong as well. 
The good: The fries were good and tasted fresh and they allow dogs on the patio.",SAtcFX2_qGMLZisNylwR3A,0,0,1,xZomcQkZmQOqGwbb-5q3Fw
