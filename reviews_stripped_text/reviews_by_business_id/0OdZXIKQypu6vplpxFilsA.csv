11634,2016-07-21,4,0OdZXIKQypu6vplpxFilsA,"I have been here three separate times since the opening less than two weeks ago, specifically for two different loaves of bread that had been recommended by friends, and I was excited to try each. 

Every time the service is extremely slow, but I understand the process is a little slower for better quality food from scratch. I've been satisfied with the food itself but each time I have been, the customer service has progressively been worse. 

Today was the breaking point and I have already contacted management. I went through the drive through today for the first time and someone named Vesta (even though my receipt says Kaydon, so I am assuming she lied to me?) was absolutely horrible. I got to the window and started to ask what the loyalty card was that I had been given my previous trip (no one ever explained it to me). She rolled her eyes and stuck up her pointer finger without saying a word apparently to shush me? Then took my cards out of my hand and closed the window without a word. I was frustrated by this but held my tongue. When she gave me back my cards I started to ask again, and AGAIN she simply closed the window without even an acknowledgement that I had spoken. 

When she finally brought out my food almost a full 5 minutes later, I was fed up and told her that I had tried to ask her a question twice and I don't appreciate being ignored. I asked her what her name was and she hesitated, then told me it was ""Vesta"". I told her I would be contacting her manager and she laughed, said ""thanks"" sarcastically, and proceeded to close the window and refused to open it again. 

Long story short, the food is pretty good when they haven't run out of certain breads half way through the day, BUT the service is horrible. ""Vesta"", you need to learn that your customers are your most valuable asset. Without them you wouldn't be working. So try a littler harder next time, because you never know who the next person may be that you mistreat!",yfGE-f7nxLpIWrsVaqSb-w,17,2,1,gh0Bbzvpi7Vs8tIJ2OC64w

I opened the cup, and there was a solid two inches of not  coffee between the lid and the liquid. Frustrated, I called Kneader's, asking if it was normal for them to not fill up the coffee all the way. 

The manager explained that due to the amount of milk, coffee, and foam they put in, the coffee comes down to that amount, and they just have that one size cup to put the drink in. Despite the fact that they did nothing wrong, they decided to throw me a free drink. The manager I spoke to, Christopher, was very helpful, and made it known that customer satisfaction was his priority. 

Aside from that positive anecdote, the staff is always friendly, and the food and coffee is always good. There may be a little bit of a line, but what do you expect, it's a popular coffee shop.",4sNBhoQ-4daVLdeLC3-t2g,0,0,5,sLATdYJS6g0Nv4VgiBmH-w

However, as others have already said in the reviews, the service is less-than-stellar all because of the wait time! The wait time is atrocious!

Please, Kneaders, hire more people and/or do better training with the ones you have. I can tell that your staff is not working as a team and too much responsibility is falling on the shoulders of a few. I've literally sat and watched your staff as I bitterly waited for my food and it's a bit of a mess. I think this place has potential.

My husband was disappointed in his sandwich as well. The third time I went inside with a friend to have breakfast and decided on the French toast. It was cold and dry so I asked for a replacement and ended up with another cold, dry breakfast.  It wasn't even warm enough for the butter to melt.

The first thing I had was the French Toast. I don't really order french toast often but it was recommended to me so I figured I would give it a shot. Totally nailed it! It was light and fluffy on the inside and a crisp golden brown on the outside. I will say it was a bit too sweet for me so I probably wont be ordering it again (but I do recommend it ). 
I did the drive through for the french toast a few days ago. Today I called in an order for a french dip with cream of broccoli soup. The sandwich looked like it had too much bread and not enough meat. Turns out by adding the au jus you get perfection. The cream of broccoli was great as well.

The ONLY reasons I gave it 4 stars is the new counter staff needs LOTS more training! & prices are alittle high for sandwiches but you get what you pay for here! 
I requested provolone cheese on my sandwich & she put it in as Parmesan cheese chips (made for salads!) thankfully person making my sandwich came out to double check such a weird request, so she fixed it and was a great sandwich!
They don't confirm which breads you might want & have a hard time figuring out what the prices for certain items are if they aren't marked & many of them aren't. 
It took two of them to figure out the price of some Caramels I was thinking of getting I finally just said thanks but never mind. 
They try hard but like I said being at the counter they should know what they're doing more than they currently do . If you request added cheese or ask what types of bread are available  they don't have a clue & they should, other than that like I said LOVE this place. I don't mind paying more for such great & fresh food! 

UPDATE; 
I down graded to 3 stars from 4 I would give it 5 stars because I LOVE the fresh food. But the customer service SUCKS!! 
At first I attributed poor customer service as they were new but come on!!! TRAIN PEOPLE!! 

UPDATE: it's my third time coming here. I called in my order asked if I could go thru drive thru to pick it up... BIG MISTAKE! They couldn't  even FIND the order!! They had to re-take it went inside to wait ANOTHER 25 mins to get it. Then they had the wrong dessert!! 
Any pick up orders CHECK ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE!! 

I repeat they need better people better/more training ... Whatever I would hate to have to boycott based on poor
 C.S/ management as food is so damn good!!

We tried their turkey cranberry sandwich and the signature turkey avocado club.  The sandwiches are big and you can also choose just about any bread they carry.  We had ours on their country sourdough bread.  DELICIOUS!!!  My favorite and go to sandwich is definitely the turkey avocado club which has carved turkey their special sauce, avocado, onions, lettuce and bacon.   

I also was offered a delicious pumpkin chocolate chip cookie to try and I think I even closed and rolled my eyes back with my first bite like shut up this is so darn good!!!!!  I have come back for sandwiches time after time but that cookie has me finishing my sandwich fast to get to it.  Soft pillowy pumpkin goodness with just the right amount of spices and chocolate chips.  I really hope it is not a seasonal item as I would be super sad.  My husband likes their mint chocolate brownies which were a seasonal item, but due to popular demand are now a permanent offering.  

Carbs and calories definitely do not count here hehe, but seriously I look forward to continuing to come back and making my way around their menu and bread baskets and pastry cases.

+ So much fresh bread, several varieties as well as seasonal specials. I really like the harvest grain and rye. Pumpkin bread is $1 off in September.
+ Service was really friendly and polite, checked on me several times.
+ Cute retail area to browse while you wait, customizable gift baskets available.
+ Sandwiches and salads are very fresh, available in whole and half sizes.
+ Baked goods and desserts are really the highlight, especially the tarts and petite cakes!
+ They have a drive-thru for those in a hurry (haven't used it yet though).


CONS:
- Posted menu doesn't provide detail for ingredients in their salads, you have to browse the hand held menu, of which they didn't have extras. I can see the line getting backed up easily.
- Pastry case doesn't have prices, so your total may be a surprise. Some of the desserts are under $3 while others are $4+, I'm not sure why this isn't on the label. 
- I really don't care for their poppy seed salad dressing. I wish they'd ask for a dressing preference (like how they ask for a bread choice)  as it was unclear what other options are available (again, posted menu can only fit so much info).
- No GF options available. I realize this is a bakery, but it's pretty common to have some GF accommodation these days.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,18,3,EAuxbZnDV9KRsjBjdn7Cjw

I went back a second time later on that day and ordered desserts. My mother got a cinnamon roll, my dad got a German chocolate brownie, and I ordered a regular double chocolate brownie.

They start out by using their homemade cinnamon bead sliced thick and grilled up with a nice thin batter of egg coating, and god love em for leaving the frosting on top of the bread intact.

My addiction to this French toast is because of the syrup, it has Carmel in it, yep I said Carmel. They must put something in it to make me crave it so much it's  ridiculously delicious. You get 2 slices per order and the syrup is served on the side so I always ask for a large extra syrup cup as I don't pour it over the top I dip my toast in the cup of syrup to make sure it's fully engulfed in this tasty yummy deliciousness! 

To top it off when eating it there in the dining room they give you all you can eat, a cinnamon French toast buffet and for only $6.

(For the record, I don't care WHAT your religion is, as long as your food and service is legit.  It's just present, that's all I'm saying.)

I have spent the last few months seeing this built in front of the halfway vacant plaza on Craig/95 and was glad SOMETHING was finally going in there.  I have some personal beef with the Indian Restaurant behind it, so I haven't had a reason to go near the plaza until today.  

I had the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The bread wasn't soaked - it was crispy and the sandwich was flavorful.  Not bad.

The sides?  Potato chips and a pickle? I wish I saw where that was noted, because I eat neither and I wish I had a choice of something else.  Or I wish that the cashier told me that.  The cashier was sweet, but a lot of the staff seemed a little nervous and wet behind the ears.  My table I sat at was just cleaned and was pretty WET.  Not damp, WET.  

The girl at the front said neither thank you, hello, or explained the place to me.  She just stood there, looking around.  

The presentation of the place was super cute - but very something my grandmother would like - knicknacks and all sorts of things to buy with cute phrases and everything that doesn't appeal to my demographic.  However, if you have KIDS and you are looking for a place that is welcoming for that kind of thing - there were tons of kids everywhere.  

I don't see myself going back as I'm a big fan of chains with more of a focus on protein.  This place is legit with their love of bread, (which was pretty good and offered free samples.)

To the owners or management - train your staff. They were not welcoming nor engaging.  You've had plenty of time. I expect better from a Mormon chain.  Look at Z***a's! They're personable and amazing!",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,4,0,2,QJ9LBRmzQV5WTmwvDSHL8Q

It was opening week, new employees who looked fresh out of middle school. Ok. I'll give you a pass. 

2 weeks later, I order the same thing. Same thing. Messed up again. I guess children have no idea how to make salads? 

We ordered online both times. Both times it was a 20 minute wait past the time I said I wanted them. For SALAD. 

3rd time I said screw it, let's get breakfast rolls! Hop in the car, get there 15 minutes later and cruise thru the drive through. It wasn't bad as much as it was weird. The sweet girl at the window pet my dog. (Sorry people behind me! ). Then she asked me to show her my nails. And said my hair was super pretty. I think she had a girl crush? Not sure. But I came away with 3 tarts, 2 brownies, 4 cinnamon rolls, and a coffee (I just ordered the last 2). Tarts were great. Fresh fruit. And you can't knock a freebie. Brownies were terrible. They had some awful storebought frosting on them. I can't complain too much for free brownies. The iced coffee was terrible. 

Terrible. Maybe I'm a coffeehouse snob (I totally am), but this was disgusting. I asked for light ice and it was full. 

Bottom line? They need to hire people above 18-20. People who give a shit about their jobs. Terrible, immature people. If this chick touched my hands and my dog, who knows what else she touched.

turkey bacon avocado 5 star. Get this. The foccacia is thick in size but nice and airy. 
Chicken cheese and ham 5 star. Super yummy. I got this cause I love ciabatta.

French dip 2.5-3 star. Bread was delish but the amount of meat they give you is pretty pathetic. Au jus is good. Needs horseradish.
Chicken artichoke panini- I didn't try it but hubby was missing his turkey bacon avocado and wished he ordered that

I did go back and buy a loaf of their zucchini bread after sampling it. However when I asked the girl at the counter how long the entire loaf would last she said 24 hours...

The decor during this visit had a grandma's house home for the holidays feel.  With the maple wood cabinetry and Christmas tree and even stockings hanging from the fireplace, it just felt cozy inside.

Kneader's has a pretty simple menu that includes a handful of sanwiches, salads, and house made soups. I decided to go with the famous Club sandwich with roasted turkey (like thanksgiving style), ham, roast beef, LTO and Kneader's sauce. The sauce was an amazing combo of mayo, mustard and sour cream which was quite delicious.  Served on country french bread which was definitely a highlight of the  famous Club sandwich.  The bread was so soft and fluffy on the inside while have a crunchy crust, one of the best breads I've had in a while. 

I also tried the Artichoke Portobello Soup. With chunks of carrots and mushrooms through the rich and creamy chicken broth and artichoke base. The soup was pretty good. On the menu they also had Broccoli cheese, French Onion, and Chicken Noodle, I'm looking forward to trying these flavors as well. 

I am disappointed I did not get to try the desserts.  They are very tempting because you have to walk by the pastry case to get to the ordering counter.

Things I always get: 
Chunky cinnamon bread 
Chicken pesto panini
Turkey artichoke panini

Almost crossiant 

For the paninis I would prefer more meat as they are kinda cheap with that.  It's more bread than anything.  The paninis does come with some fresh Parmesan kettle chips and homemade pickle slice.  

I love the cinnamon bread but wish I could get it plain and have the frosting on the side.  They top the bread with frosting and it melts and the plastic wrapper gets all nasty and super messy.  It would also be nice if they can cut the bread as well.  Me cutting is a disaster.  

The fruit tart and crossiant are good, nothing over the top.  They have a drive thru and some kind of rewards card.  You just gotta ask at the store.

3519517,2016-11-11,47,0OdZXIKQypu6vplpxFilsA,"If I were writing a review solely on their pastries and freshly made breads it would be much easier to give 5 stars since they are the true gems on the menu. I have been by a bunch of times now ordering both inside and the drive-thru. The employees have been very friendly and willing to answer any questions I have about the menu. One thing you might want to do is check out the online menu for this location because there is much more offered there than on the actual menu board in the restaurant and you could be missing out on something delicious by not even knowing it's offered. They slow roast turkeys at each location and hand-pull then each morning for sandwiches and salads. I have had several things with the turkey and it tastes so good! Sometimes there is a wait for your order, but they are making things fresh, so I don't mind. 

Banana Cream Pie French Toast ($6.49) - Get this! Sliced bananas and almonds with whip cream and a delicious caramel syrup stop some of the tastiest french toast you'll ever eat. No joke! They use their Chunky Cinnamon Bread loaves, sliced thick, to make the french toast here. I previously had the Chunky Cinnamon French Toast for $5.59 that came with sliced strawberries and caramel sauce and it was great, but the banana cream pie is so much better! If you don't see it on the menu board in the restaurant, just ask and they will make it as it's on the online menu. 

I was able to make my french toast a combo #2 for an additional $5.39 which gave me a pastry and a smoothie. I chose the Eclair and it was soooo good! The smoothie I chose was the Morning Sunshine Smoothie, with Orange juice, non fat vanilla yogurt, strawberry and banana was actually not as good as I'd hoped. It was a bit bitter and didn't live up to the description. I also had a Cafe Mocha for $3.99 on another visit and it wasn't anything bad, but it wasn't great either.  

Turkey Bacon Avocado on Foccacia (8.49) - Some sandwiches on the menu are available on half/whole sizes, but not all of them. This one comes whole and it was by far the best thing I've eaten on the menu here! The bread was so fresh and tasted great, the turkey was slow roasted over night and hand-pulled fresh that day and had a little salt and pepper added which I loved. They put a decent amount of fresh avocado on the sandwich and there was also provolone cheese, kneaders sauce, red onion, lettuce and tomato making for a very tasty sandwich. I'll absolutely be ordering this one again.

Provolone Muenster Cheese Melt ($6.69 for whole) - This one you can get as a half or whole sandwich. This sandwich has 3 layers of Three layers of french country sourdough bread, yes you read that right. Muenster cheese, provolone cheese and fresh pesto butter are melted in between and it really hits the spot especially on a cold or rainy day. For $2.99 you can make it a combo #1 which gives you a cup of soup to dip your sandwich in. Mentioning soup, it changes daily so check their website or ask when you are ordering what's offered that day. I've had some hit and misses with the soups. You can also get your soup in a bread bowl, score!

Pastrami Sandwich ($6.99) - This was terrible. I know this isn't NY or L.A, but come on the veggies were fresh and the bread was good, but the skimpy, flavorless pastrami they had on there was a joke. I'm amazed that call it a pastrami sandwich and that it doesn't compare in size as well flavor as some of their other sandwiches. If this sandwich was my first experience here, I'd have probably never came back, so I am glad I had such great previous experiences to avoid that. 

Chunky Cinnamon bread ($4.59 for a loaf) - They also sell many of their breads by the loaf and this one happens to be the one they make all their french toast with. The price is very fair for what you get and it pairs so nicely with milk, coffee or tea. Ask for a sample they usually have a few different kinds out for customers to try. 

Frequent Diner Card - It's free you just have to ask for one and then register it online. Give it to them each time you pay for your order and you will get 5% back on every dollar you spend that builds up and can be used towards future purchases.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,62,62,4,G4Su8A5Qct5lnIagYNVl7Q

They offer free samples to taste while you wait which is nice since it seems to take a long time to get anything. One was something chocolate filled and the other was some sort of berry filled. Both were dried out I assumed from sitting too long (they had just opened) or that is what they do with their day-old stuff. For some reason they both had a bitter lemony flavor.

The $2.79 cinnamon roll I ordered was very disappointing. I could see a fresh batch sitting on the pastry cart but the one I got must have been yesterday's leftovers. Dry like the samples and very little cinnamon or icing. It also left a disgusting yeasty taste that doesn't wash away with 2 cups of coffee.

At first I was surprised at how few customers were there at 7:00 on a Friday morning. Now I understand. They need to step up their game or this place will be closed.",FTAA5IEXlEVDBF5-b5I6Ow,4,0,1,ia8bOJFBJBzpc1ZEX4xZNw

We bought lemon blueberry bread, fruit tart, peanut butter cookie, and a scone. It only cost about $20 for eight items--not bad! As we were waiting they had a few retail items to look at such as aprons, glassware like mugs and other cute dish ware. We were able to sample Some cookies and a mini coconut cream pie tart and s chocolate eclair. They have a lot of delicious sounding pastries as well as a variety of breads to choose from. I was sad that they were out of the almond croissant. So I'll return back earlier for that and to try their breakfast. They also serve sandwiches, soups, and salad.

I've been here once. I had a Coke Zero, which was truly terrible. Their mix is way off. This cost them half a star.

I also had the Al Mondo salad. It was very good. Fresh ingredients with well trimmed chicken. No flabby bits. No weird seasoning blend (like Panera uses on their chicken).  I didn't want the sweet dressing, so I got ranch dressing instead. 

The salad came with bread and I chose country French. This is basically sourdough sandwich bread. Boo. They also didn't give me any butter. The bread was nothing to get excited about, which is too bad at a place called Kneaders. 

The service at the drive through was great, which I appreciate.

Edited - I noticed that their ranch dressing is not that great and I got a couple of bites of flabby chicken. Their bacon has an artificial, chemical smoke flavor but it is otherwise good.

I ordered the roasted turkey sandwich on ciabatta and my dad ordered the french dip. We both ordered the roasted red pepper soup and the berry bread pudding to share.

My sandwich had absolutely no meat on it. Considering it was put on a ciabatta which is a larger roll for a sandwich there just wasn't anything substantial about the filling. I also asked for extra cranberry since the spread they put on wasn't a spread at all.

My dad's sandwich had the same problem, not enough meat to bread ratio. 

Our soup was barely warm... soup is supposed to be hot. It's hard to eat it when you are concerned that you might get sick from an improper temperature. 

Our bread pudding was just ok as well. It didn't seem to be cooked long enough and the sauce they drizzle it with was barely noticeable. 

I have always loved Kneaders, but I feel like they need to stop skimping on simple details and portions so that the customers leave happy and satisfied.",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,7,4,3,Mt7tQ1mapPCL8R7MsRaKpw

3943299,2016-07-27,2,0OdZXIKQypu6vplpxFilsA,"This place just opened a week or two ago and the start has been both smooth and rough. Here is our experience:

We read on Yelp that the drive thru took forever and always got food wrong. Due to having a large order, my wife went in. The line was to the door and moved at an okay pace. Considering that every seat was taken, the drive thru was in use, and the line was a good 10+ people it is not surprising that it took a while. She was slightly annoyed that it took nearly an hour from entering to exiting with food, but the food is supposed to be fabulous so it might be worth it! The food we received was definitely worth the wait!!! 

HOWEVER...

We didn't receive several things we paid for and several of the things we did receive were incorrect (the wrong type of pastry, the wrong type of pie, etc). 

Let's get back to the food.
So delicious! The orange rolls are sweet and sticky and divine. The orange flavor permeates the entire thing. A+
The paninis seemed like they were lacking and a little thin. I feel like sandwiches should be a mouth full though. In the end my wife says that they tasted great and weren't like scary thin so over all I would give a B- for quantity of filling and an A+ for flavor and overall size (large side to side). 
The salad was a surprisingly large size for one of these types of places. We got the sunflower turkey one and it was very good and very fresh tasting. A+
Pastries over all were a win! A+

So let us get to the big issue on the table, missing and incorrect product. My wife called immediately and a higher up guy from the franchise company answered. Apologized and was ridiculously friendly. FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Offered us a remake or a credit. We accepted the credit and my wife just went in. The manager on duty (she thinks) Chris took really great care of her. Made sure to talk with her, apologize profusely, went way above and beyond. Took off the large credit that Jody had written in for us. They had a specific employee working on packaging our order. He came out to go over the entire order with her. In going through it there were still a few mistakes. A couple were the fault of putting it in incorrectly and a few were the packager. My wife pointed out the packaging mistakes but felt bad and didn't want to make them remake the stuff from the cashier inputting it wrong so she didn't mention it. One of the fixes included giving her a higher priced item than she ordered. Very nice! Chris then offered to walk her to the car because the ordered was large. She accepted and he kindly helped her out. 


I wish they had half stars because I would have gone up a half star. They have their service issues which we are attributing to being freshly open with a new computer system and being swamped non stop. Food quality and customer service are top notch! Just make sure to only go when you have a spare hour to pad your lunch time and you are okay with having to triple check your order.",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,1,1,4,WnEk8_nlmMwwkTFFuSLblA

4014492,2016-10-11,6,0OdZXIKQypu6vplpxFilsA,"Nice....just what I need not too far away from my house....fresh baked CARBS!

Kneaders is very much like those other chain companies that advertise lots & lots of fresh baked in-house breads and baked treats.  Kneaders has it in spades!  I assume it's busy because it is basically one of the only bakery/restaurant types in that area of town.

But actually it's not a bad place to visit!  Upon stepping in you get hit with that scent of fresh baked goods and boy can it be totally inviting.  Step right in...get your daily dose of gluten!

Before this review, I'd say we have gone to Kneaders at least 3 times.  A couple times at night and once in the wee of the morning.  I gotta say I don't mind the food at all.  Very rustic charm, very old-timey country American.  Kneaders is known for their sandwiches, breads, and pastries.  They also do soups and salads and even pies too.

On our first visit there we had:

-Club Sandwich ($8.39) - turkey, roast beef, ham, Kneaders sauce (similar to 1000 island), provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, salt & pepper, all on French Country Sourdough

-French Dip ($6.99) - roast beef, Swiss cheese, salt & pepper, au jus on the side, served on a baguette

Damn, they make some mighty fine sandwiches!  Wifey's club was a good side and loaded with meat.  Bread was baked relatively fresh, good crust on the outside with a nice tangy taste from the sourdough.  French Dip for me was great!  I love me a French Dip!  This one sure didn't disappoint!  Au jus wasn't too salty, baguette was crunchy and hearty but not stale.  Quite surprised, a decent sandwich from a chain!

With the sandwiches you can also combo up and add a small dessert/pastry, chips and a drink for an extra $4 or so.  

Don't forget the breakfast!  Upon a return visit the little one got the all-you-can-eat French Toast or Sourdough Pancakes for just $6 and change.  She liked their thick slices of French Toast!  Comes with a side of strawberries, whipped cream & caramel syrup.  Beware though, you can only choose French Toast OR Sourdough Pancakes.  When you refill, you can only get the same item you first ordered.  Which seems kinda silly to me but I guess that's just how they do it at Kneaders.  Same set price...why not let us try BOTH?

They also do something I've never seen in a restaurant before, build a basket?  Yep!  Have one of the staff create you a gift basket to take home while you wait or while you eat!  Full of fresh baked breads and pastries!  They really have all the boxes/ribbon/wrap all right there in store.  Strange, but I guess it works!

Only downgrade I have is that it can get a bit pricey dining at Kneaders.  I guess it would be on par with that of a deli joint.  No value meals here, but I suppose you do get value for your money regardless.  Just be careful, wifey's sandwich combo alone set us back more than $12!  To make up for it, grab an extra helping of some of Kneader's samples up at the checkout counter!

4175381,2018-04-14,2,0OdZXIKQypu6vplpxFilsA,"This location is right down the street from me so it is very convenient. 

They have breakfast items, salads, soups, sandwiches, specialty coffees, smoothies, fresh baked breads & rolls, pastries, cakes and pies. You can also make your own gift baskets. They also have misc. items to purchase such as aprons, mugs, ceramics, etc... 

There are two separate lines; one for the bakery and the other for food. Lines can get long depending on what time of the day you go. They also have a drive thru. I personally have never used it. 

Items tried and liked (so far):
Turkey Cranberry Salad
Southwest BBQ Chicken Salad
Thai Chicken Salad
Turkey Cranberry Croissant
Sugar Cookies 
Chunky Cinnamon Bread
Aloha Coconut Sweet Bread
Asiago Cheese Bread

Their salads are pretty filling so a half order is perfect for my daughter & I.  *Note- we usually order the full size salad at Panera & Cafe Zupas. They also have free samples of breads (2 or 3 different varieties) at the order/register area so don't forget to grab a slice or two :) Also please use the provided tissue to take your bread and not your bare hands! :0  I swear some people have no common sense! 

They have a Frequent Diner card.  Ask for it at the register.  The more you eat, the more points you get. You earn 1 point for every dollar spent. For every 100 points, you will earn a $5 reward that will automatically be loaded to your card. 

They have an ongoing fundraiser called ""Hope Fights Childhood Cancer"" on their website and sometimes items are available at the restaurant. All proceeds go to childhood cancer research. Everything is elephant themed; cookies, t-shirts, stuffed animals, etc... If you are able, please help by purchasing any of these awesome items! 

Place is clean & organized. The decor Farmhouse.  It's quite roomy and perfect for big groups. There are also tables outside.  So far the staff that I have encountered have all been helpful & friendly.  This franchise is Mormon owned which means they are closed on Sunday's. 

Overall Kneaders is a nice & relaxing place to grab a bite to eat.",jp1cDthqcWX62NtL1oAKlQ,6,7,4,G7tIcUFAZkdpP1VaJEFR7A

I got there today around 11:15 just to avoid the lunch crowd. When I walked in, I noticed the place seemed a little disorganized. Customers were standing around looking at the menu which you can only see if your in the front of the line. Once I finally got to see the menu, it's very basic it doesn't really tell you a lot about the items food etc. I decided to ask the Cashier about the Ruben panini...she had no idea what I was asking about. She had to go and grab someone else. I know they just opened but really??? How difficult is it to learn what your serving? Then I wanted the sand which on their cheese bread and no sour kraut. That took another 3 minutes how to input that into the register. Then I wanted a chocolate eclair. So just these two items ended up costing me $12.20. This was not a combo etc! WOW! I sit down find a dirty table to sit at...waited another 18 minutes for a very small sand which with a pickle and a few chips. I must say the food is tasty but extremely small in size for the $12.20 price tag. Customer service was non existent and it seems like they have a lot of issues to workout. For this price I could have saved some money and eaten somewhere else or had a bigger meal. I actually walked out of this place starving! I do not think I would come back.

The location was easy to find and the parking lot was designed to guide traffic efficiently. It was clean with ample parking. 

The wait to place my order was minimal and they were busy so I give them credit there too. Besides to your right are these beautiful display cases of delicious baked goods to look over. They also have cute aprons and items for sale too. Plenty to keep your mind off of the minimal wait. The cashiers and food runners were organized and friendly.  

I ordered the turkey cranberry croissant and it could not have been any better. It was freshly carved turkey breast with cranberry on a fresh baked flakey croissant. 
It was super filling. On my way out I ended up buying two cranberry white chocolate cookies that were equally satisfying. 
And it is all about the bread. I also. Light a loaf of white bread and some dinner rolls. I have already had the pleasure of making a sandwich on the bread. The cost is about 3.50 a loaf. It so worth it.

So we waited in a long line to order our food. My boyfriend got a plain coffee, I got a hot latte, and we got one sandwich to split. My boyfriend got to get his coffee instantly since they have the coffee out on the counter for you, but I had to wait. In fact, not only did we have to wait quite a bit for our one sandwich, the sever didn't realize I didn't have my latte until after we got our sandwich. So I had to wait an additional 5 or so minutes for my basic hot latte. I was excited to try it, regardless of the wait but boy that latte was HOT! So i couldn't really try it until after we had left the place when it was actually at a drinkable temperature. And thats really sad for me, because I like to drink my coffee while eating. The sandwich we had was some chicken pesto sandwich I can't remember the name- but it was OK overall. Not the greatest, and so not worth the price.

I've been looking forward to this place since it's right down the street. We don't have a Panera TOO close by, so I was hoping for a nice alternative when I wanted a good sammich. And I was very satisfied. 

I had the Famous Club. Everything about it was great. The bread, the meat (they pile it on), the quality of the meat, the veggies...it was great, guys. 
My Sugartoosh had a panini and said it was really good too. 

I'm really looking forward to their breakfast. I don't eat bread much...but I love, LOVE bread. And this place is off to a great start for me. 

Plus: They have a drive up and it took less than 10 minutes to order and be on our merry way.

They also serve breakfast which i think we may try this weekend. Ordered a turkey bacon and avocado sandwich on country sourdough and my husband had a pastrami sandwich with the chicken noodle soup.

 I have had the chicken salad sandwich on the croissant... which was probably the best person that I've had since I was in Europe.

 My son ,the first time, had the pumpkin cheesecake which was phenomenal ...the second time he tried the cinnamon roll which was equally as delicious 

We  took home a cinnamon bread (which lasted about two days in our household lol)

The last time we went I had the poblano soup which was delicious creamy, but not heavy or greasy. Everything there is so fresh, you never feel like you've eaten anything processed when you leave there ...it really does have a Bistro- like homemade feel and taste to all their products-- highly highly recommended!!!

 both times we went it was not crowded we went on a weekday around 2:45 to 3:30 and it was just great

We did try the banana crumb bread, eclairs, and apple pecan bread pudding. The bread pudding was good and I would get again if I return. Both the Eclair and the Banana bread really did not have much flavor. My wife bought the loaf and I honestly did not know what kind of bread it was and at first thought coffee cake. It's sad when the most tasty part is the butter spread. 

I can't recommend this place when not too far away is a place called the bagel cafe. They make everything from scratch and offer a greater selection of baked goods among many other items.

It was cold, but I was leaving because I didn't want to eat in a filthy restaurant. When I got home, I found that there were about 4 pieces of bacon the size of a dime in my salad.

Not including the time it took to stand in line to place order, it took 22min (based on receipt) to put bread in a bag and a piece of pie and bread pudding on plates. There was no cooking or prep involved! Then it was brought to us in a to-go-bag because they knew we were waiting so long and thought we may want to leave. 

There were no prices in the display case. What they brought was not worth what they charged: pie and bread pudding were both $3.99 each. It tasted fine,  but my mood ruined the flavor. They sliced the loaf bread we ordered, and we asked them not to. While we were in line, someone else returned a mistaken order (they gave her the wrong bag).

It seems as though they were spending too much effort in the sale of bakery baskets with all the wrappings and knick -knacks to dress it up in. I would hate to be that person who actually attempt to have a basket put together. Plan on being there for 3 hours...
