Then the clerk stated mileage charges were $1 per mile  for anything over 5 miles per day. Unbelievable. Firefly is owned by Hertz where I am a long-time Goldmember. Customer service apologized but would do nothing to fix this rate problem at Las Vegas McCarran Airport,5Bc_hLpw_WfYCH_ehkVcLA,0,0,1,eBKYE0Sqlafgk1LkT3-MdA
13032,2016-10-20,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Firefly recently started serving brunch, and I have been wanting to try it since they started. I finally decided to go to celebrate my 22nd birthday with some friends. The brunch was so good, and you can still order from the rest of the menu if you want. It is a tapas breakfast still, which at first I was a little skeptical about, but it ended up being great! I had their patatas bravas (Potatoes) and the carne asada breakfast taco. The tacos are like little street tacos, but they were SO good. I also tried one of the Pumpkin Beignets, they look a little bit like donut holes,  they didn't really taste like pumpkin, but they were still a tasty treat. 

Most importantly, for brunch they have all you can drink (with a 2 hour limit), mimosas, sangria, and bloody marys. I obviously had to try all of them. The mimosas were very good, I am not a big fan of bloody marys while I'm eating, but besides that it was a very basic bloody mary, still tasty. Their sangria is always good, so no surprise there. I like to get the sparkling white, because I'm not a big wine fan. We definitely stayed the whole two hours. 

Besides the food, the service was great! There were about 10 of us so we had a lot of people coming over to help. The manager even stopped by to wish me happy birthday which was very nice! I also got a birthday shot, great place to go to celebrate! I would definitely recommend!

The food was cold/lukewarm the drinks watered down and we were basically told it that's the way the dish/drink is prepared. Even though its something I'd ordered many times. The rest of my party had been there independently of me and felt the same way some stating this would be the last time. The service was not at fault and she did remove an item from my bill I could not eat. But the food quality unfortunately as not as great as it once was.,48VNJDb0cWVl2-GTpYU_WQ,0,0,3,vz71aNSoabfwg0ez5rBZ6Q

Service - We were greeted promptly and were seated within a couple of minutes. The servers were friendly and came by every so often to refill our waters and ask how the food was.

Food - Oh my god. Everything was so on point. We ordered a lot of food, but my favorites would have to be the Babyback ribs and the Apple and manchego salad. The salad was delicious; it had just the right amount of dressing to counter the sweetness of the apples. The ribs were also amazing! The meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was drool-worthy. Everything was perfect. The portions are decently sized, allowing you to order a variety of tapas to try. And just to add on, the mixed paella was just as tasty.

Everything was perfectly cooked. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. The stuffed dates in the wine reduction are a must! The warm salad was amazing! We were not big on the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. It was hit and miss on whether or not there was enough stuffing in the mix. 

We loved it so much we came a second time and ordered all the same dishes except we had lamb instead of the stuffed mushrooms and we ordered TWO of the stuffed dates (so friggin good!). The lamb was the first dish we had that we were not impressed with. We love lamb and eat a lot of it. This was tough and lacking flavor. The lentils that come with it were great though. The cook on the Tierra y mar the second time was off too. One of the shrimp tasted raw. Meat was tougher. I think it is probably different chefs on different nights?

129778,2014-10-04,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"My husband and I just went there for lunch today and it was extremely disappointing. We ordered a veggie paella because we missed the paella we tried there couple years ago. So after 40 mins passed, the paella came with so little rice, and it was really more like a stir fried veggie instead of paella. Paella is a rice dish, there should have been a reasonable amount of rice but there was really not much rice! I remember they gave more than that years ago. And I have eaten paella in various restaurants, so I know how a paella should be. The paella today at Firefly was absolutely ridiculous. It was like a stir fried veggie with little rice sprinkled on it and then stirred together. We felt totally cheated. We didn't send it back because we didn't want to wait another 40 mins. And we totally lost faith in this place so we didn't bother to ask them for making a new one or ordering some other tapas instead. I ended up not touching the paella after 2 bites, and my husband ate the whole thing; he was able to finish it by himself because there was hardly any rice to make him full. the menu said paella is meant for 2-4 people, so u can imagine how little rice there was when my husband could finish it by himself! Compared with the paella we got there years ago, we couldn't finish the whole thing together years ago, while my husband can finish the sorry pathetic ""paella"" today by himself. It was really jacked up and we got out of there as soon as my husband finished it, and now we are sitting in another restaurant to get fed. We will not go back to Firefly again, it was not like what we had years ago. I never see any paella with so little rice in it in my whole life!

It was recommended to me first by a close friend that worked in the restaurant industry in Vegas as a locals place. I went to the original location one block away and since the move, have been to the new location a few times now.  I make it a point to visit this place each time I visit Vegas on business or pleasure.  I recommend this place to all my friends, family, and co-workers.

On my recent visit on 12/28/13, my family (4 of us total..kids were 10 and 14) enjoyed:

1) Red Sangria - Get a pitcher(s) of this stuff.  It is the nectar of the wine gods.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and tart on a hot or warm day and compliments all the dishes they have well.

2) Tapas Style - Since moving to the new larger location, they changed their menu and added more flare.  
  - Tomato-basil soup and grilled cheese is light, flavorful, and refreshing.
  - Shrimp ceviche is cool refreshing, seasoned well and balanced in flavor.
  - Stuffed Dates had a smoky bacon wrapped around a semi-sweet date with an almond inside.  It was a great combination of flavors and the crunch added a nice texture.
  - Firefly Fries are a large portion of garlic and parmesan goodness.
  - Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese was the kid's favorite.  Fresh and homemade with real cheeses.
  - Chicken Skewers was another kid's favorite.  There was a roasted garlic cream that added some good flavor to the chicken.
  - Serrano Sliders were really tasty and tender.  We added some of the onion straws it came with as a garnish in the slider to kick it up a notch.
  - Merguez...my wife doesn't like sausage but this lamb sausage was great.  Not very gamey but a good rich tasting meat complimented with red peppers.
  - Lamb Chops - It was like eating candy...it was lamb as it should be with a base of seasoning that brought out a slight pleasant sweetness.
  - Camarones a la Diabla - Shrimp in a spicy sweet sauce.  Hands down one of the best dishes there.  The sauce is so good...ask for extra bread for dipping.
  - Desserts for us consisted of our favorites...flan and tres leches cake.  The flan is traditionally made and the flavor of the custard has an almond taste to it...the tres leches cake is moist and sweet to eat.

3) Service - The servers, runners, and bussers were fantastic.  Our drinks were always filled, table was clutter free, and our server checked in at the right moments.  

4) Ambiance - The new location is much easier to get in and out of.  The décor and layout of the restaurant was very open and relaxing.

Overall...great job on the new location and new menu!",WmXouMxdpbiXen4H-PCMUg,3,1,5,QFlMzlbRC8Xu8oKTtuZr-w

Went in with high expectations and boy we were not disappointed! The padron peppers were delicately fried (no hint of greasiness!) and piping hot. Some peppers were spicier than the others so order them if you like spicy. Our server was so pleasant and welcoming! He recommended several dishes , one of them the Camerones Diabla which was beyond delicious with the most complex sauce that was finger licking good. The refreshing artichoke toasts with a tasty aioli and the white anchovies with avocado were second to none and great palette cleansers because both are topped generously with fresh, chopped basil. Lastly, we ordered the eggplant cannelloni - 3 delicately rolled eggplant stuffed with airy goat cheese mixture - wow! We ended with the cherry bread pudding with port reduction and ice cream...it was beautifully plated . It was a feast for all the senses.  Oh, don't forget the sangria- we had the red and it was so flavorful with a perfect balance of alcohol and sweetness. 
I wish we had another night because we would go back to try more tapas that we could not devour tonight. We have been fortunate to dine in some great places and when you come across friendly and attentive staff...neat setting...and food you would pay double for in other cities..Firefly is your kind of place!

Anyways, I only ordered the Firefly fries and Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms. Even with the small selection I chose, I was not disappointed.

We've had the apple and manchego salad as well as the chopped chicken salad and both were unexpectedly delicious. The apple and manchego has a delicious, tangy bite. 

My boyfriend got the Beef Wellington, which was one of their specials. I wasn't the biggest fan but it's not really my cup of tea. He loved it and it was only $15! Great way to try a dish and be able to do smaller portions. 

Ceviche of shrimp is the last dish I'd recommend. I'm such a snob when it comes to ceviche and Firefly's is always delicious!!!

She said the food was great and she and her family enjoy it.  I looked them up online and and came across the event section, I sent a quick email for someone to call me.  That day, the event coordinator Regina Simmons contacted me.  We corresponed via email text and by phone.  We were a party of 35 and were able to have the private room in the back.  

On our way to the venue I sent Regina a text that we were on our way.  Once seated our waiter, Jesus was on it.  We had water bread and drink orders.  Oh did I mention that I left all my centerpieces there and Regina and her staff decorated for me.  She even ordered linens and napkins to match our rustic chic wedding decor.  Everything looked beautiful.  

Within 10 minutes of settling in, BAM!!!!  The food, oh the food.  We had artichoke toast, the bacon wrapped dates, salmon toast, beef and chicken skewers and the diablo shrimp.  Everything was delicious.  The service was awesome and the food amazing.  The value was definately there.

Parking, use the valet parking, it's FREE!!!!!

When we were leaving, the place was bumping, it was a great vibe and great mix of people.  I will definately be back on our next trip.  Can't wait to try new items. (Will definately order the bacon dates again)

We got there at 615pm and the room wasn't quite ready but no worries, we all went into the bar area and ordered a drink.  About 15 minutes later we were ushered into a really cute room with a long table and then drink orders were taken and then appetizers started to flow!

They have made a few changes to the menu that are great.  Specifically, they have mini Italian Beef sandwiches Chicago style.  As a Chicago native, I thought they were spectacular.  The new restaurant is roomy and has great ambiance.  Our interest in Firefly definitely has been renewed and it will be back on the list of regular places we frequent.

Room for improvement: The service was a bit slow, especially since we went on a Friday night and the place was not packed.  We prefer to order a couple plates at a time. Though we told our waiter this, he was not very good at checking back regularly to see if we were ready to order more.  Also, something has to be done about the noise level.  I suspect that due to the low ceilings and type of flooring there is nothing to absorb the noise all the patrons make.  It was very difficult to carry on a conversation due to the loud crowd noise.  If the place was packed, it would have been unbearable.  I hope management will do something to help minimize.  If the noise issue is resolved I would give it a 5 star rating.

THE SERVICE - awful, confused, unattentive. Our tapas arrived long before our silverware and plates, or water. I tried flagging someone down 3 TIMES to no avail. Finally, I had to pop into the bar area to request plates, silverware, etc. Not very good. Then, it seemed like we had several waiters, none of which communicated with each other. After we were almost finished with round one, another waiter brought bread to to the table and seemed quite confused that we were almost finished with the plates already on our table. So, word to management.....  TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION.

THE FOOD - wonderful! We ordered the stuffed dates.... OMG!! We ordered an additional plate! We also ordered the pulpo, the lamb sausage, manchego Mac n cheese (holy lord that was good!), patatas bravas and a couple of  other plates that escape my mind and a pitcher of sangria.

We did a destination wedding with only 18 of us, so I wanted somewhere small, with drinks, and food for after the ceremony before we all took off to party on the strip.  This place fit the bill perfect.

The Food - It was amazing.  We only had the passed appetizers, but if this is any indication of their menu, then omg we are definitely going back for dinner the next time we're in Vegas. We had the bacon wrapped dates, the ham and cheese croquetas, and the steak and mushroom skewers.  Everything was delicious!  Our guests had nothing but good things to say about the food.

The atmosphere - The decor was nice and fit the theme of the restaurant.  Everything was clean and well presented.  The area where our reception took place was private and well decorated.

The staff -  The staff were awesome.  Everyone was polite, attentive, and very professional.  When we arrived at the reception there wasn't any seating or low tables.  I asked one of the staff if we could please get some chairs.  We got a full seating, I was so thankful as we had people who needed to sit and ladies in heels looking for a rest.

Booking our space was easy.  We worked with Regina who was friendly and responded to my emails quickly.  We were able to make last minute adjustments to the reception due to last minute changes with our guests.

Why 4 stars.  I held back a star due to how our reception ended.  As we were winding down staff started coming in and moving tables, clearing our cake, and bar service ended.  The clean up went on for about 10 minutes before the staff came over and very politely asked us to please wrap it up.  Our reception was from 5:30 - 7:30, and I checked my phone thinking we must have gone over our time.  It was 7:20 when I checked and I estimate they began cleaning up around 7:10.  While not the end of the world, I was a bit miffed that time that I had paid for was basically shorter than I expected as staff closed our reception down about 20 minutes early.  Again, not major, but if I were to ever do it again I would make it clear I want my space for the full time.

The atmosphere is very cool and lounge-like, with low lighting and great music playing. It's right off the strip, but it's more popular for locals, so the vibe is laid back.

The salmon toasts, veggie empanadas, and calamari were excellent! I went with my sister and a friend, and we ordered 6 savory apps and 3 desserts to split, and we had plenty of dessert left over. I absolutely recommend the mini cheesecakes and lemon berry tarts for dessert, and the goat cheese and eggplant cannelloni as a starter. 

The house shandy is an excellent choice of drink; they mix up the traditional beer-and-lemonade cocktail by taking a light Belgian beer, mixing with fresh strawberry bitters, and adding a bit of Amaretto to top it off. So refreshing and so delicious!

The only note is if you are looking for a quiet place to have a romantic dinner this is probably not for you as it's a little loud inside the restaurant...it didn't bother us at all, but a warning if wanting a more intimate setting.

I was there on my birthday, dressed up in a pretty dress and my guy friend was wearing a nicely pressed button down shirt. I'm pointing this out because the staff treated us like we were filthy street people. The staff was literally fawning over every table around where my friend and I were sitting -- yet they were beyond rude to us. At least four times they tried to take plates away long before we were finished, brought the check before we asked for it and while we were still eating, then trying to take the plates away again while there was still food on them! Two nearby tables had the opposite experience. The waitstaff was attentive, smiling, and even engaged in polite little chats. I thought maybe they were the owners or friends of owners... until I realized the waitstaff was being that way with almost every single other table! They were being NICE to them!

Here is the sad fact: My friend and I are not Latino, sorry but there is no other way to say it. We are white people and there were only a handful in the entire restaurant. VERY DISAPPOINTING to be treated that way because of our skin color. As delicious as the food was, I will never go back to Firefly. 

It was when we were leaving that I realized what was going on. Here is why: someone had accidentally left a car key near the front door. So I walked it over to the bartender who wasn't even taking an order or making a drink -- he looked at me with a quick little nasty expression, then ignored me. All I was trying to do was return someone's lost key. I had NO other interactions in the bar area while at Firefly, so there was zero reason why the bartender would give me a dirty look.",99kaWsTb1l654nOXxRSG0Q,1,0,1,xlDgA4u7xUYuQF8suufB6w

The food was amazing, the drinks yummy (and strong!), the vibe inside was classy, and the prices were good.  We made a reservation in advance through the Firefly banquet contact (the information is easily available on their website) and did a pre-fixed menu of family style tapas for a great price!  We did the Tapas Banquet for $33 and with (copious) drinks on top of that, it came to $60 pp including tip.  If we had had the same dinner on the Strip, we would have paid more than twice as much!  
Firefly was super easy to work with in making the arrangements.  

What also was great is there were great options available for my vegan and gluten-free friends, in addition to the yummy food for us meat-eaters.  We also had a ton of leftover food that we had boxed up and ate the next day as hangover breakfast food.  

This worked out super for us based on our bachelorette party schedule, which was as follows:  
6 - 7:  Pre-dinner light drinks at The Platinum Hotel (we booked the Marquis Suite, which easily slept 6 ladies with space to spare!), 
7 - 8:30 Dinner at Firefly (we ubered there from the hotel, about $6 - 8, the uber ride was about 4 minutes), 
8:30 - 10:30:  Back to the hotel to freshen up, pregame, and do some bachelorette games, 10:30 - late:  We went out clubbing to Tao in the Venetian

The overall night went great, and Firefly was one of the best parts!",ekYRsEBSBRb9ia3k_e8jQw,1,0,5,NMizhjbgqLIbp-xhsu_chw

Called Firefly in the afternoon on Sunday and was able to get a reservation for 7pm for 4 people that night. Parking was easy to find there's a medium lot in the back of the restaurant. The interior has a clean and modern night club type feel. We arrived at 6:45pm and was seated right away in a booth. 

We ordered the stuffed dates, padron peppers, boquerones, petite filet, merguez (lamb sausage), and chicken paella. The only underwhelming dish was the peppers I would skip those the next time. But please do yourself a favor and get the petite filet! It was super flavorful and perfectly medium rare. I've had a lot of stuffed dates but this one was one of the best I've had. The paella is AMAZING. Perfectly cooked and not too salty. Chicken can be tough if cooked for too long but this chicken in the paella was tender and juicy. For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and flan. They're both good but the star of the dessert was the little cookie that came with the flan! They should have a dish with a bunch of those little cookies. On a side note we ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria to share. Delicious and smooth! You can't go wrong with the drinks here either.

This place was all around fantastic. 

We ordered the red sangria, which was lovely. It had flower petal tastes incorporated...that's a first for me. Never had that flavor in a sangria. It was great. We ordered a couple mojitos as well - they were good, but the sangria just blew em out of the water.

We were vegetarians and I went here after reading someone else's review that said they had vegetarian options. He was right on the money! It had a good number of vegetarian options - and they were willing to customize the almond stuffed dates to make em veggie-friendly as well. And all the dishes were excellent.

Honestly, I'd have given these guys 4.5 stars, but I rounded up cuz the food & drink were so good. The -0.5 stars would have been for 2 things :

1) for loudness. Try asking for outdoor sitting to help with that (it seemed quieter outside). There was a longer wait for outside seating when we went
2) When we did ask to move from inside to outside the waitress insisted that we'd have to close out our bill and then move and re-open a new tab. I get that we'd have a new waiter/waitress (i.e. I don't want someone else getting my tip?) , but as a customer, that should be transparent to me. They should have been able to figure it out between themselves, and leave me out of the picture.

Having said that, this place is a must visit for me now.. I'm going here (and asking for outdoor seating) next time I visit the area!",VsbR3Tnd0pqVpEJcpJG9mw,1,1,5,w9Gq4bdOSEp2lgnjZKKfsg

1049982,2016-11-07,4,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Firefly is my go to place for a late night munch.

FRIDAYS: Friyays are Latin Nights! They move the table and chairs out on the patio deck and make it a dance floor. There is sometimes live music from a band or just a loud DJ playing the best of Latin music. It gets really cramped and full on Latin Nights. Parking is hard to find because people love to dance and drink!

FOOD: Their tapas menu is amazing! Bread and sweet butter is served complimentary with a sweet butter(bread can be hard if you come late at night). My favorite dish here is the Mac n cheese. It is prepared with small shell pasta, yummy cheese, and baked to perfection. I LOVE the Mushroom Tart here because it is a dish you can't find anywhere else in Vegas. It is a flakey dough with a mushroom sauce on top. If you want more mushroom dishes, the stuffed mushroom is also really great. I would recommend more dishes but honestly their menu is pretty big so your best bet is to be adventurous and order a dish from each section of the menu since it is tapas:)

DRINK: They have a full bar offering whatever you're craving for the day. So you can even go here for drinks if you're not feeling hungry.

ATMOSPHERE: This place has a really great Latin setting with Latin music and Latin food. Great place for a date or just to hang out with friends.

TIP: Be careful of your own sensitivity to foods. Latin foods can be raw because that is how the food is supposed to be prepare (many customers complain when they get sick from raw foods but it's not the restaurant's fault).",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,7,5,5,HjXBI_IhkYeTOy8i02pFsw

The Summer salad features thinly sliced french green beans,  marinated in a balsamic dressing surrounded by halved red and black cherry tomatoes and a few dollops of smooth, lucious burrata cheese.  Delicious! 

The Albondiga -meat balls in tomato sauce- doesn't sound exciting but it is irresistible.  Serrano ham and Manchester croqettas- sublime.  Crispy outside soft and delicious inside.  The red Sangria was perfect.
We had other dishes and all were top notch.

He is the best and always on point with the most excellent service and attitude. The sparkling white peach sangria (pitcher) is a must have and we drink every drop of it, even eating the blue berries too!

We told the waiter who called the manager! Wow! What a joke!!! He treated us like if we wanted the meal for free (we didn't even ask for anything). He never apologized however proceeded to tell us that the sangria is filtered 3 times. I don't care!! Hello! He was rude and defensive. We all work in hospitality and honestly wanted to laugh in his face. He asked us what type of sangri we wanted, he would replace the pitcher. (I hope!) we sAid white and he sent out red!!!!!!

You will leave this place with ringing in your ears. It is as loud as a night club, which makes for a totally unromantic, get-me-outta-here dinner experience. Service was rushed and felt IHOPish. Food is nothing special, and when you can't hear yourself think, you don't really care what it tastes like. Sangria was too sweet. Definitely not worth going when there are so so many dining options.",emLNW6tae7RWSGhenwTRsA,2,0,2,mfaclo3AZghKBTd7feqEiw

All the food was delicious.  Our waitperson, Irina, and her main helper, Jesus, were attentive and personable.  5 Stars to them.

Only negative was the noise.  It was hard to listen and talk.  Would have rated it a ""5"" if the noise level wasn't so high.

We had the chicken & mushroom paella (if you like paella, make sure you order it as soon as you sit down - takes awhile to prepare), beet salad, warm spinach salad, merguez (lamb sausage) and chocolate tres leche cake.

This restaurant serves Tapas, which is basically small plates and/or appetizers. Our table decided to just order a bunch of these small dishes and share them all, which was nice because it would have been so difficult to just select one! Everything we ordered tasted fresh and amazing, and have AMAZING flavor - from the stuffed dates to the mac n cheese to the tuna tartare. For us, they brought out the dishes one by one, so we were able to focus on one dish at a time, passing it around the table for everyone to serve themselves. It is quite a different experience than most restaurants, but I definitely enjoyed this method. We also ordered a pitcher of Mango Mojitos, which we SO yummy. The mango did not taste artificial at all. 

The atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty modern and artistic. We had a unique dinner because we were able to experience both the inside and outside seating. At first, we chose to sit outside because there were beautiful round fairy lights, and the inside seating seemed a bit to dark for my liking.  We really loved sitting outside, until the thunderstorm started! We were quickly moved inside, just before the large amounts of water soaked through the thin cotton overhang. The inside has a great ambiance - dark and candlelit - but I did like the outside more, before the storm obviously. 

The staff was very accommodating and helpful, especially when we had to quickly move inside. They said ""grab your drinks, and we will take care of the rest"". It was very nice of them to brave the storm outside which got crazy pretty quickly.  Our server was also very friendly, and was helpful with our questions about the menu. This is amazing quality food for not that expensive, ESPECIALLY for Vegas.  I don't know if/when I will be back to Vegas, but if I do, I will definitely be coming here again!",JiiCP8TSf5dDFygtfS_Dxg,3,5,5,aqjw9bbdGvzSdtlE2jQHzA

The food was great as I remember it from the previous location, with their signature items such as the bacon wrapped dates. We tried a handful of plates and with each tapas order, we were impressed. I can't even really repeat back to you everything we had but there were plenty of delicious and savory options. We tried so many and didn't feel like we broke the bank in the end. We opted for two desserts, one that was the flourless cake and both desserts sent us straight into a food coma as desired/expected.

We visited on a Saturday night and the one thing that was a little annoying was how loud the music was. There was a nice mix of songs - some Spanish, some radio hits, some rock - but it was all very, very loud. At one point in the beginning of the meal, we considered asking to move to the patio because it was just so so loud inside (seated at the bar). Since it's a very open layout, maybe that wouldn't have even helped.

I used to frequent their location on Eastern at the base of Anthem over the past years and when they closed, the dark clouds covered my blue Firefly sky. I have not had the opportunity to check out the Paradise location but when I was given the opportunity to on Friday night with other Yelp Elite friends, I jumped on it. 

The vibe is pretty busy, sexy and swanky. The amount of people who were there was like visiting a popular New York restaurant on a Friday night. It was wall to wall humans but due to the size of the location it was better than said NY location. Although we had reservations, we waited at the bar for our table. It wasn't bad because I got to catch up with friends and drink a Ginger Smash. Excellent pre-cocktail by the way.

We ordered tapas. Lots of Tapas. Shared those lots of ordered Tapas. One thing I have always liked about the Tapas experience is that you can just try a bit of everything. Can one get full from trying a bit of everything, of course one can! I have always enjoyed their bacon wrapped dates. When they first closed I was sad, so sad because I have not found Bacon Wrapped Dates that even nail Fireflys. The added smoked almond does it for me. Most places don't add the almond so it just mushes. The ham and cheese Croquetas, stuffed peppers and beet salad are also a fabulous choice. I recommend those for tapas  ordered. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, so fun to explore Spanish style tapas here.

1312416,2015-04-19,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"We were looking for a decent place to dine at midnight. It's Vegas, so I figured there had to be something open. They served tapas until 2am and had excellent reviews, so I initially thought it was perfect! However, I came across multiple articles on how this restaurant just couldn't get it together with health inspections and multiple cases of food poisoning. I was skeptical, but I still decided to take the risk! 
We ordered the firefly fries - good for a big group to share, but not worth getting for 2 with all the other options. The Tierra y mar skewers with salsa verde was ""ok"" - I wouldn't order it again. It just wasn't special and I've had better. The manchego mac n cheese gave me a mini heart attack with every bite, but those basked pasta shells were delish! The chicken tinga empanada was excellent, but it left me wanting more of it! The camarones a la Diabla had a real sweet and spicy kick to it. It tasted like it had quite a bit of siracha. It was tasty, but not my favorite. 
The last item was the bacon wrapped dates. I do not like dates, but these bites were little pieces of heaven. Sweet and salty, with an almond crunch in the middle. I still couldn't believe how good it was. I don't like dates, but I liked these! It comes with 5 per order, so perfect for 2-3 people. 
The evening was topped with the trio of gelato - vanilla and chocolate were good, but not as good as the pistachio flavor! Love love love! We also ordered the chocolate tres leches cake to go. Our server said it was a must have, so I wasn't leaving without it. Hopefully, it's still good tomorrow! 
I gave this review 4 stars because of a couple things, the hostess wasn't very friendly (our server was good though) and there were so many options on the menu. They should really cut it down and focus on the items that are really good. Not everything we ordered was that good, I will only rate a restaurant give 5 stars when ALL the food is excellent.

This place is marvelous. Their old location was about 500 ft away and that's where it was love at first bites. Tapas style makes it easy to have a variety of flavors and share amongst family and/or friends. There are many choices to choose from that consist of seafood, beef, veggies, and much more. Some of my favorites are the ceviche, stuffed mushrooms, tuna tartare, tomato basil soup, tierra y mar skewers, baby back ribs with mango sauce, the pork chops are a must, and the empanadas with roasted pork are yummy. Whatever fulfills your pleasure, I'm sure you'll find it here with the endless choices. The table set up is the perfect setting that gives you plenty of room to work on multiple plates at once. The atmosphere has a romantic setting for date night during the week. But the beat picks up Thursday through Sunday and the place gets a little loud, but that's what makes this place a great experience. The staff is great, the vibe is trendy, and music sets the tone for a wonderful evening. If you want to avoid the larger crowds, I suggest to visit during day and the food will be just as delicious as it is at night. Also, if you're staying anywhere on the strip, you're a short $8 taxi away from most hotels on the strip. Oh yeah, the drinks are amazing too and you must try the red sangria.

Being that this is me and my now husband favorite place to eat, we love the atmosphere, but of course the food and the RED SANGRIA. 
Being said, we just had our wedding reception there in the patio area. The outside is very nice, the hanging light bulbs, the red and black walls, everything about it made my reception amazing. Ana, Alejandra and their staff was amazing. 
Instead of ordering per person, we ordered from the tray menus. We ordered about 5 trays for each 15 different tapas. My guests loved the food and they got really full and the food were still coming. LOL. But they were able to take to-go, which is good, so food doesn't go to waste. Plu, our 4 year old son has severe food allergies to all 8 allergens, they were able to accommodate that and my son loved his baked chicken. 
I also was able to do my own kind of decorations, i was also able to hire a DJ, a photographer and a photobooth without going through there vendors. I had a Sweethearts table, a guest sign in and Cake and Sweet Bar. By sketching out how the tables are going to be set up, i was afraid it was going to be tight, but it wasn't...i was able to have a decent size dance floor and still had space to walk around.

Deducted 1 star because it took a while for the hostess to realize their was people waiting by the stand and it was confusing. Most of the night people would just walk in think ing they could just sit anywhere or were actually looking for the hostess. 

4 stars for the food and ambience. Very trendy, but somewhat casual atmosphere. This is definitely a ""Date Night"" Restaurant. Gets loud with large groups, so you may need to speak up with whoever you're with. The service was awesome! Our waiter was kind, he broke down ingredients and flavors in a lot of the dishes and helped determine some of the tapas we may enjoy. I ordered the Sparkling Red Sangria, very good. They have a lot of space for large and small groups. I noted one booth had a curtain with it, so even if you wanted to have a more intimate dinner you definitely could.

Favorite Tapas include Camarones Al Ajillo, Firefly Fish Sticks, and the Baby Back Ribs

You can easily do quite some damage at this restaurant and you're bill will reflect that. Walking away, I paid close to $75 on the bill for 2 people. So you can only imagine what you can do with more food and drinks.

All in all a good experience, and would like to return.",HGj8FYzkxJ0Uw8vNjbyluA,0,0,4,YCm_YG9_aMLcFu15TrKbkw

1361066,2013-10-25,1,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"So I wrote a really scathing review of this place before it moved and when I walked in, I told the concierge. I basically got treated like garbage by the bartender because (I'm pretty sure) I didn't fit their hipster classy crowd. They reassured me that the place has vastly improved.

I came with Angela and Kent. We ordered about a dozen dishes here. I'm only going to mention the two that we would order again. The stuffed dates and the spicy beef salad. Everything else we had wasn't even ok. We also got seated outside and there were only two servers outside and we actually waited 5-10 minutes until we got our drinks! Seriously, have you ever waited that long for alcoholic drinks in Vegas? Yeah, it's like we walked into some pocket dimension not in Vegas. Our food also took a long time gettin' to. Even the bread and butter they give you, I had to ask for twice before we got them and they took their time also. What really made no sense was that we got our dessert before we even were served all our main courses! WTH? That's a first, never happened to me. 

I will say that the sangria is pretty awesome here and the pear-ginger martini was pretty outstanding. Only reason why I'd ever come back, the drinks. But then again Angela made a good point that you can find better in Vegas if you looked hard enough. Yeah, probably so it's a question of whether I would go out of my way to come here just for the drinks. Nope.

So I'm really, finally done with this place. I was done before they moved and now I'm done again with this place.",np_PA4ejejVhk4klYvnMDA,0,0,2,xEAdMcT1FdDJH3eQ3KIvXA
1361117,2014-03-14,1,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Ahh! One of my favorite places EVER.

Every time we come here I get Sangria.  They have red, white, and sparkling.  They are all delicious, but I think sparkling is my favorite.  **Half off pitchers of sangria during happy hour!

They bring you complimentary bread with almond butter.  AMAZING!! Seriously. I would order this stuff if it wasn't given.  We always ask for another order.

My top 3 tapas are the firefly fishsticks, the ham & cheese croquetas, and the salmon toast.  I was really excited for the parmesan fries, but they aren't very good.  I have tried them twice and both times they were soggy and bland.  I also really like the babyback ribs (with mango BBQ sauce), the lamb chops, the petit filet mignon, and the fruit & cheese platter.

My boyfriend loves that they have Pacifico here.  He loves the stuffed peppers, bacon wrapped dates, and the tierra y mar skewers.

I like that this place is tapas style that way we can get a wide assortment of food.  I'd suggest getting at least 3 dishes per person as they are pretty small.

We have tried a couple desserts here but weren't very fond of them.  Last time we tried the flan.  We have had the banana nutella sandwiches twice and both times they were made differently.  The first time they were delicious.  They were fritters stuffed with bananas and strawberrys in them and nutella on top.  Last time we went they were literally nutella sandwiches, which we can make at home.  I don't know why they were different.. Maybe because the fritter styled ones were at the Sahara location?  But no more desserts for us, we'll just stick to the tapas.

Service is usually pretty good.  The food comes out as it is prepared.  We will continue being repeat customers.",FWYjGKHmbjxrkXROctTGYA,6,2,4,vtRNEhw7ReHs6PzMdRg4iw
1364398,2014-01-14,4,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Bacon wrapped around your dates!?......end of review.
Came here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday, the choice was perfect, elegant, clean, affordable and with a menu so intensive anyone would surely find something to their liking. I had the fried calamari, pardon peppers, the dates wrapped in bacon and the paella which was very delicious and loaded with seafood. The peppers were medium to mild but you may end up with a very spicy one, but as Forrest Gumpzalez once said ""life is a plate of peppers, you never know which one is going to burn you"". I asked the waiter if they could fry the calamari in tempura mix instead of their regular mix and they did which means that everything is made to order and not frozen ready like other places do.
 I also ordered the sangria and a mojito and they both were perfectly done, a harmonious mixture of fruits and wine made this sangria one of the best I tasted. 
  Service was great..at the beginning and then it slowly became nonexistent, but to be fair I think we might have overstayed our welcome. I blame it on the sangria. 
Tip was included on the bill as any establishment would do for parties of 8 or more but we added some more to cover lingering fees.
Great times and great food will surely keep me coming for more and if you keep on making good drinks as good as your dates wrapped in bacon, you'll definitely have me wrapped around your sangria for sure.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,4,5,5,C-p7kcA4NELR1IqFLPC3kg

Having worked in the industry, I can confidently say that a place that has undergone such public humiliation is not going to drop the ball again. I am sure this place is now cleaner than one of those crazy decontamination suits in Outbreak. But, unlike that movie, Firefly does not suck. This place is the bee's knees. Try getting quality tapas at such a very reasonable price elsewhere - I dares ya! This new location (about time!) is much larger and nicer than the last joint. The once overly packed patio area is now open and spacious, and the same goes for the interior. The cramped bar has been traded for a full encompassing rectangle of drinking goodness. And the food lived up to the atmosphere. The bacon wrapped dates are a stalwart, and not to be missed. My only knock is the bread. I have never cared for it - hard and flavorless (closer to a cracker than bread). Although, it could be a blessing in disguise, as skipping he bread leaves plenty of room for countless small plates.

Hot: Tuna tartare, artichoke toasts
Mild: Shrimp tempura, camarones al ajillo
Cold: Ahi tuna skewers (not great flavor)

My favorite parts of the meal were the sangria and the dessert. Not that alcohol and dessert being the favorite part of a meal would be surprising, but that was definitely the high point of the day. The cheesecake and the flan was great from the dessert platter, and the banana nutella sandwiches were delightful.

I can't say enough about the delicious food! Prices and quality are always great. Our go to's are always;

Ceviche ; super limey just how I like it. Big chunks of avocado and shrimp. Just delicious.

Shrimp A La Diabla; sweet and spicy and just the best. The sauce is thick but not overwhelming. We usually get two of these dishes as my husband and I don't want to share! 

Tierra y Mar: Yum yum! Chorizo, shrimp and filet mignon skewer with a salsa verde drizzled on top. Another must have a must order 2! 

Bacon wrapped dates: I don't need to say anymore. Get them. 

We had our toddler with us this time so we explored beyond our usual 4. 

Mac & Cheese: This was a large portion and just so so good. I know you can't really get too crazy with Mac & Cheese but it just tasted different, ans super cheesy. Our toddler loved it.

Unless you're in Espana, great tapas are hard to come by--BUT not at Firefly! 

This is a go-to spot in Las Vegas, especially since it is located a little away from the chaotic strip (and there is parking). I visited Firefly both times I was in Vegas since my cousin who is a local introduced it to me. My go-to's are the tuna tartare w/ taro chips, bacon wrapped dates, and ham and cheese croquetas. The gelato was nothing great but I would recommend the flourless chocolate cake for dessert! The portions are small and don't leave you feeling gross after eating--which you don't want to feel like when you're in Vegas heat and going to be walking around all day/night. You just get a good taste of everything. 

Not so positive but still ok...

The chicken-skewers here are nothing spectacular, and my friend ordered the sliders which I thought were average--but I'm not a sliders fan to begin with. I'm not a fan of the sangria here but it's also partially because I've been making my own sangria. It seems like the fruit hasn't been properly soaked in liquor, more wine needs to be added, and they could def use more variety of fruit besides apples/oranges (cheapest fruit you can find -_-).  

Overall, I'm such a fan of the tapas I listed that I would come back anyways esp for a midday lunch or light dinner. Cheers!",2ssdUPp0u3HcRdn5C2MiVA,1,0,4,mtTPZeOp0bHWRIw-5VljGA

We made reservations for 5:30pm on a Wednesday. I know it was early, but I like to eat an early dinner. This was a birthday also for my friend so this is where we went.
When you pull in the parking lot, there is some street work going on and the parking lot seems plain. Most of the parking is in the back. Not really impressive looking. But when you walk in the front door, it is like an oasis. Beautiful inside. VERY nice.
I had checked the menu ahead of time and about the last 50 Yelp reviews so I had written down the accumulation of the six most recommended food items. You will need about 3 items each for a man my size (6'1 225 lbs). My friend got a red wine sangria, which I tasted, it was VERY good. I'm not a wine drinker either. I'd probably get the sparkling sangria next time. I got the strawberry mojito. Good but too sweet to have with dinner. 
We got and shared the:
Bacon wrapped stuffed dates. Everybody says to get these. These and the sangria were probably the most listed items on the prior 50 Yelp reviews. I didn't see it. They were ok, but not to die for. Would I eat them again? Oh yeah. Would I order them again? No. 
The petit filet. This was the most expensive item at $12.50 and a very small piece, but very good piece of filet. It sat on a bed of tomatoes and spinach and diced potatoes that was very good. Wouldn't get it again as money can be better spent.
Chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms topped with melted cheese. Yummo! I would get this again. I am half Mexican though so I may like chorizo more than most.
The scallops escargot. There are NO snails in this, just made with garlic and butter. You get 6 decent size scallops cooked to perfection. I would totally get these again. Gotta try these.
Camarones a la diabla. Fantastic! The best thing we had. Decent size shrimp, cooked perfectly, in a sauce that is hot, but not too hot, and sweet also. The sauce is so good that you want to dip the bread they give you into any remaining sauce. Five shrimp came in a serving. 
Tierra y mar skewers. These are skewers that are maybe $8.50. So $4 cheaper than the petit filet. On each skewer is a chunk of filet, a shrimp, a chunk of tomato and a piece of chorizo. You get three skewers and if you combine the amount of filet on each skewer you get more on the skewers than in the petit filet. So get this instead of the petit filet and save. 
We both had the chocolate and cherry bread pudding for dessert. We could have shared one dessert but weren't sure how big it was. It was a big serving of bread pudding and a rather large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. No bourbon sauce. But like I said, even if there are three of you, just share one as you will already be full. If it is not someone's birthday, I'd just skip the dessert.
My TIPS:
Ask for Alejandro, as he was a superb server. He was always around if you needed him, but never a bother. 
TIP 2: order all items at once as they bring them out as they get cooked. Ours were staggered and since they are small plates, the most we had at once at the table were two items out of 6. 
TIP 3: get the tierra y mar skewers instead of petit filet.
TIP 4: get the sangria. It really is that good. 
TIP 5: Make a reservation. We got there at 5:20pm on a Wednesday. Maybe 1/4 full at most. By 5:45pm it was 3/4 full and by 6pm it was completely full. On a Wednesday. It's a nice place and worth it. We were dressed fine and we were in shorts and Hawaaian shirts.
Our bill with two drinks each and 6 Tapas and two desserts was $86.75 and with tip $102. If you cut out the desserts, that would be $17 less after tax and tip. Which would bring the bill down to $85 for two. Of course if you drink water instead of the 4 alcoholic drinks, that would save a lot more, maybe $30 more when you think about the tax and tip.... but I want the two drinks. hehe.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,3,3,5,-G7xgjYgaREJrxND7qfshw

I have several friends that live in Vegas and love this place. Also checked out the yelp reviews and saw the raving reviews. After 11 hours of walking and working, I was SO EXCITED to get my tapas and sangria on. 

I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. There were 4 of us and the waitress suggested we each order 2 dishes. 8 dishes came out and all 8 dishes were sub par. All the proteins we ordered were either over cooked or over salted. All the veggie dishes we ordered were uninspired or under seasoned. 

The saving grace was the sangria. The red sangria here was amazing. You can definitely taste the fruit coming through the wine. so yummy! Maybe if I had a couple more glasses before the food came out I would've enjoyed the tapas more. The ambiance here is also really cool and casual. 

I'd probably only come back here for drinks and bar food.",ggi_FC9v6QGheH5AZqFmmQ,1,1,2,VthaJiR-79BQ3-fqM9mYMw

Friends and I went this past Saturday night to celebrate a bday. The mango mojito was amazing...the drinks were all delicious and the bar staff were friendly despite being busy. We got our booth and started to order plates to share..some were better than others but I especially liked the fish sticks...very meaty. So, we are just chatting at this point and I go to put my arm up on the back of the booth when I see a full grown COCKROACH (NOT A WATER BUG, A ROACH) crawling FROM the direction of the kitchen and along the wall. We all shriek (involuntarily) and call the waiter over. He sees it and tried to kill it but it crawled down somewhere and he moved us to a center table. Of course, we are disgusted and shaken. He brings over the rest of our drinks from the table and tries to bring the food over..I was like...""no we don't want that now."" 

The manager was called over and began to spin a story and try to do damage control. We told her we appreciated it, but our experience was ruined and we would not be paying full price (in my mind I was thinking we'd pay half and that'd be fair). They said their place is pristine and gave us a tour of the kitchen after 20 minutes of telling us we could  (if it was as clean as she swore, why did we have to wait so long?). The floor was sticky, there was clearly a second kitchen, but she insisted it was a hallway (lie, we saw servers coming from that area with trays and trays of food all night). 

The meal ended up being on the house but we still tipped our waiter because, after all, he just brings the food. As we are exiting (not making any sort of fuss), the hostess rolls her eyes at us when we say good night! Really?? This is a FILTHY freaking restaurant and you have some ill feelings towards some dissatisfied customers? Some nerve! I have gone to firefly when there was a location in Henderson and enjoyed myself immensely. I WILL NEVER EVER EVER DARKEN THIS RESTAURANTS DOORWAY AGAIN. It was filthy, and their staff are (obviously) poorly trained!

We made reservations for 8 people at 6:45 and were seated right away in a booth that comfortably fit all 8 of us.  It was especially nice because we were seated in a little nook that gave us privacy, and more importantly, a quieter area so that we could actually hear each other.

Disclaimer: I am not a sangria connoisseur, so my taste is not very discriminating.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the sparkling wine sangria; I regret not getting a pitcher.  It went down just like juice.  It is on the sweeter side, so beware if you like a more mild sangria.

As for the tapas, I had the tuna tartare and the petite filet.  The tuna tartare was pretty bland and rather oily, however, I was impressed with how fresh the fish was!  This was the first time I had tuna tartare, so maybe that was how it was supposed to taste, but I would not get it again.  However, I loved the pairing with taro chips (disclaimer: I may be a little partial because I am from Hawaii) because it was a little different and made up for the oiliness of the marinade.  The petite filet was DELICIOUS!  It was cooked perfectly, moist, and soft.  I absolutely loved the red wine sauce, as well as the fact that it came with mushrooms!  It is a must have!

My friend had the firefly fries, which I heard good things about.  However, I thought it was also rather bland and oily, and did not eat too many of them.  

All in all, I would definitely return for the sangria and because of all of the enticing tapa options!  There are so many other tapas I would love to return to try.  Additionally, I didn't save any room for dessert and the banana-nutella sandwiches are calling my name!

Only after we ordered their Firefly fries with cheese on the side and my friend stated that I was vegan was I offered the vegan menu..and our server was vegan. How did she not think to offer it from the start? Yes, there is a menu that features vegetarian, vegan and GF options. I've suggested they offer it to guests when giving the standard menu. Hope they run with that.  Think they'd have a lot more people talking about their attention to dietary preferences.

So from my humble vegan opinion you should have the artichoke crab cakes and heirloom carrots and go from there if you are still hungry. Both are amazing and my non-vegan friend even agreed. 

From my humble beer lover opinion they have a nice selection of drafts and of course their sangria is kinda famous in this town.",LkhR5vafpSVx11WCl2wXMQ,0,0,4,CPhkH3wbEDX8oETJTm-NdQ

criticisms: 
some days the tuna was fresher then others and some days it was cut a little sloppily. ask people if they want more chips to start because its never enough.

the stuffed mushroom didnt seem to have alot of flavor for having chorizo in it. needed more salt both times imo.

One great thing is that they are fine working with even the most limited diet restrictions--our server checked on dishes and made sure everything was up to par for me. And she did it all graciously, which isn't always the case at restaurants. 

The wine list was a nice treat, with a range of inexpensive Tempranillos and Malbecs, a change from the spendy wines everywhere else (if I wanted overpriced wine, I'd never leave Anchorage). They had a delicious sparkling sangria, too, which is never heard of before. 

I liked the atmosphere: dark, comfy, and great Spanish art all around. The music was fun. The space was big and accommodating. 

I'd love to go back when I can eat everything again. My one and only criticism is that the flavors of what we had and what we're on other menu items was a little one-note, without much expansion beyond red peppers and garlic, both of which are good, but a little variety for the palette always helps.",7G6WQKuL2di8e0ad8nfR3w,3,2,4,rWe9i6wpcWtkp3NKQvLTyA

The new location is very nice!! It's not as dark as the old location but dim enough for mood lightning. The waiter, runners, and busser were on point! Dirty plates taken quickly, we were regularly checked up on, and the food... Whhooooweee, the food!!!

We got bacon-wrapped dates (a must), chicken & chorizo stuffed mushrooms, tierra y mar skewers, and calamari. All were soooo good!! We also got a sangria pitcher that was delicious! 

We were stuffed but opted for the passion fruit (lilikoi) cheesecake bites and the lemon-berry tarts. Both were amazing. The passion fruit cheesecake may have been my favorite all night. I'll def be back!!",VUatcI8qj9bsH_0nKHemvA,5,1,5,LQ9U9bW7mmwVPMNgJCgtIA
1579261,2013-09-02,1,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"I was brought here by my friends who are locals. This is hands down some of the best food I've ever had! Everyone must try this place. It's about one mile off the strip, so everyone should be able to reach it.

Having traveled all over Spain and also having eaten at Spanish restaurants all over Southern California, I expected to find the typically understated and demure, simple and clean tapas I'm used to. Not So! This is bold and flavorful. It's Innovative, it's creative, it's Spanish fusion.

The Food Style:
This is gourmet at at an affordable price. IMHO the chef is a genius. Each small tapas plate is unique and individual, no two dishes are the same. Again, they are flavorful and bold, never bland. They display complex and contrasting flavors that are complimentary and blend seamlessly together to form a cohesive unit. Because each tapas plate is a small bite, the three of us were able to try 9 plates + 3 free bread and olive plates (The honey-almond-butter is amazing). This meal was like an amusement park for the taste buds.

I don't eat much meat, so we stuck to seafood and vegetable dishes. It's great for vegetarians.

My Favs (all 5 stars): The stuffed peppers, the roasted eggplant cannelloni, the manchego mac 'n' cheese, grilled scallops with saffron potato puree, and steamed mussels (incredible sauce). They give you as much free bread with honey-almond-butter and olives as you want. My friends raved about the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, which are arguably the most popular item on the menu (I don't eat bacon).

Others (4 stars): Tortilla espaniola, patatas bravas (great brava sauce).


To Drink: A pitcher of Red Sangria. This is the real deal and very very tasty. It tastes like a fruity Merlot, not like some frou-frou fake sangria cocktail you get at chain restaurant.

NOTE: some tapas are better than others, but you have to be adventurous and start trying. Use the tips above. The only one I wouldn't order again was the seared ahi tuna skewers. They didn't have much flavor and the texture a little too tough to chew.

Ambience: somewhat dark and intimate, warm decor, comfy booths. 

Service: Excellent. very friendly and attentive. They easily accommodate special requests.

Prices: $35 per person after tip per person for 9 plates and a big pitcher of sangria, and we were all STUFFED. 

PROS: The Amazing Gourmet Food; great for vegetarians; affordable prices; delicious sangria; comfy booths;  great service too; close to the Strip (about 1 mile)

CONS: NONE

BOTTOM LINE: Come here, or you're missing out! I would consider driving back to Vegas from LA to eat here.",BKF4-e-lZn2iXdCMLQSFUw,5,2,5,WmSZ9KXrbh402orKebv64w

*Tip* Before you read the rest: If you're looking to try the Paella, order as soon as your butt hits the chair. It is to die for, BUT you have to wait 45 mins while they wait! 

We went to Firefly for Valentine's Day, and it looks like we weren't the only ones that had that idea. We had to wait for about 45 min - 1 hour to be seated. Not bad for a popular restaurant, I guess, but definitely longer than I'm used to. Especially since there was just the two of us, not a large group. 

We tried a chorizo plate ( i forgot the name of it :( sorry)  It had an over-easy egg on top of chorizo and potatoes. It was warm, and spicy and the runny yolk was just icing on the cake. 

I did order the Paella and it came sizzling in a plate. It was the best Paella I've ever tasted, almost worth the wait. It was seasoned just right. I was so full from the other tapas, though,  that I ended up just tasting it and taking the rest of it home.

1674275,2014-03-03,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"THINGS I LOVED

Artichoke Toasts: (hearts, aioli, basil, pepper) I couldn't get enough of these. Definitely do yourself a favor and order yourself a handful...for yourself alone lol Very generous chunk of an artichoke heart on a little soft toast. Really thought the use of a non-toasted piece of bread was genius. 

Stuffed Dates: (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) Like candy for adults that kids would probably enjoy too.

Scallop ""Escargots"": (scallops baked in garlic-herb butter) Don't be fooled or worried, depending on how you feel about snails, but there are no escargots in this dish. I believe the name comes from the traditional escargot plate it's served in. Either way, it was delicious. That garlic-herb butter, I must have the recipe. Very balanced, not overly buttery and a beautiful blend of herbs. 

THINGS I LIKED

Baby-back Ribs: (mango BBQ sauce) These ribs are better the next day. Either I coincidently picked the one rib that wasn't off-the-bone tender that night or something else but I thought the flavor was subdued. Not the next day, full of flavor. (Maybe I had so much to eat that my tongue got flavor profile overload?)

Paellea Mixed/Seafood: (shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken or tilapia, chorizo, and vegetables) We ordered both the mixed and seafood. Only difference is the chicken or tilapia. Honestly, I don't think you'll even notice because it's not like they give you large portions of either meat choice but the paella also was not that great when I ate it at the restaurant but the next day it was a recovering hangover's best friend. I will say, it says it feeds 2-4 but that's if you order this and only this. We ordered thirteen different varieties and multiples of each plate so by the time the paella came out, 40 minutes later, we didn't even finish one paella plate and we had a group of 12. 

Camarones a la diabla: (shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce, grilled bread) Flavor was good but very strong. I would pair it with rice if I could.

Serrano Sliders: (mini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales blue cheese, crispy onions) Another good drinking/hangover meal.

Sangria: Flavor and wine-full lol

THINGS I WOULD PASS

Tuna Tartare: (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, sesame dresing, taro chips) The tuna was fresh, I'll give them that, but you'll definitely need to add a little citrus juice to kick up the taste. To me, served as-is, it was on the mellow side with the star of the show being the taro chips. I didn't know you could fry taro root.

Steamed Mussels: (steamed in white wine heirloom tomato, garlic, herb butter with Parmesan crostini) I would definitely pass on this dish. A bit lackluster and the mussels are so small. For almost 10 bucks, it was disappointing.

Ham and Cheese Croquetas: (Serrano ham, manchego cheese, aioli) Filler food. You should order something else with more flavor than waste space in your stomach for I say. They weren't bad, just tasted like potatoes. 

Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms: my least favorite order. No flavor, all I could taste was mushroom. Boring zzz

Firefly Fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) So SALTY. Could not eat more than two but other people liked them.",EnBamd1rcz0IAZxVUz5N3w,2,0,4,xAp4J7YRmDPTv8QaGQUkcg

1680688,2015-03-31,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Firefly was delicious! Usually tapas are a no-go for guys, but my boyfriend seemed to like this place. The portions are fairly generous if each person orders about 2 plates each to share. Here's what was memorable:

Bacon Wrapped Dates: Salty, sweet, juicy and the crunch of the almond inside the date. This was delicious. I could've eaten more of these.

Tuna Tartare: A nice cold dish to contrast with the other things we got. The tuna was in generous chunks and the taro chips were light and crunchy.

Pulpo Asado: Tender octopus. Not overcooked. Full of flavor from the ingredients cooked with it. 

Scallop Escargot: Think of how escargot (snails) are usually served, but with scallops instead. So they're soft without the chew usually expected with escargot. Generously sauced with butter and herbs, it was easy to want to use the complimentary bread to sop up the sauce that remained with these scallops.

Mushroom Tart: This was unexpected, but it's mouth-watering. I thought this might be dry because of the puff pastry, but surprisingly, they were generous with the sauce/mushrooms so it's not savory.

Every table had people at it, which is always a good sign. When we arrived, my group of 3 was seated immediately. We each ordered 2 plates per person of tapas. Each tapas plate was unique and served rather promptly. The filet in my opinion was the best. We each got dessert as well, and my only issue with the restaurant was that we each ordered an individual scoop of ice cream. I think the waitress tried to play matchmaker and put 2 of the scoops together in one bowl and another scoop in an individual bowl. This made everyone feel very awkward. Overall though, the atmosphere and experience was pleasant. It was pretty affordable too, it only cost $72 for all 3 of us to eat.",kkk8mp4u_wgOY-01SAYirw,0,0,4,Ex5eBq-kePXa6m-n3qrQeg

I remember before moving to Vegas I read an article about a restaurant that received the worst nightmare it could have as an establishment. Like everyone else who searches a business on Yelp, of course we look for the negative or 1 star reviews. Aren't we all entertained by bad press? 

Fast forward my friend randomly took me out the first week I moved here.to a salsa night. The meals that night were pretty fantastic I must say. Loved the Sangria and all was well until my friend mentioned about the history of the restaurant.. then BAMMMM! In my mind I was thinking ""No F*in way this is the restaurant I read about in the paper?!... You bring me HERE!?"" 

Good times. 

Any who, I've been here maybe a handful of times since then and I haven't been disappointed thus far. Most of the time I don't order myself so I can't give any recommendations except for the awesome sangria and comped bread with orange butter. 

There is a latin night on Fridays and it's pretty neat. I prefer the old school salsa dancing and they play a few here and there but it's mostly merengue, cumbia, and latin electronic music (it exists folks). 

I'd definitely go back.. sometimes through failure companies can figure out what went wrong and ensure it doesn't happen again. Business is going well.. so either they got it together or we just love Firefly to not care!",n51AQSdqEHdyPGxAousLyg,4,3,4,BL0J_Xfx-xcEseiDcZPf-g

Location/Parking: If I said it's ""on Paradise"" you would probably smack me, so whatever. Google it.

Atmosphere: We saw a bit about Firefly on Paradise on the show Restaurant Stakeout a few months ago and wanted to give it a try. What a find! This is the kind of place you want to spend 3-4 hours at a time, nibbling on small plates of awesome deliciousness and drinking countless glasses (and by glasses I mean bottles) of wine. It's beautifully decorated with dark, bold reds, striking paintings on the walls, eye-catching chandeliers, and a big open dining room with several smaller sectioned off tables for privacy. Great place to meet up with friends or to have a first date. 

Cleanliness: No issues. This place is spotless. The bar is clean, stocked, organized, and well lit. Glasses and silverware are always sparkly and shiny.

Service: Attentive without hovering. You can take your time ordering and no one is rushing you to take your plate away as you nibble. You can linger as long as you want before and after your meal. It's nice.

Food/Drinks: We always get the house Cabernet and it's always delicious. Only $5 a glass and it goes great with pretty much everything on the menu. 

6/6/13 - We had the house Cabernet, Warm Spinach Salad, Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and Baked Tilapia cooked with lemon, butter, and garlic. The bread is delicious. Fantastic meal!

11/1/13 - Tried a more expensive Cabernet and it was really nice. Had more bread than I care to mention, Artichoke Hearts, Lamb Chops, Chicken Tinga Empanada, and the Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese. Yummy!

5/29/14 - We had several glasses of the house Cabernet, bread, Chicken Tinga Empanadas, Ham and Cheese Croquetas, Stuffed Dates, and Lamb Chops. Delicious!

5/30/14 - Had the house Cabernet, bread, Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni, Boquerones, Petite Filet, and Serrano Sliders. Outstanding!

5/31/14 - Third night in a row. This is craziness. We had the house Cabernet, bread, Tortilla a la Espanola, Pisto, Camarones al Ajillo, and the Garden Variety Salad. Another winner!

8/4/14 - Came back for our wedding anniversary. Had countless glasses of the house Cabernet, Steak and Mushroom Skewers, Chicken Skewers, Bacon Wrapped Dates, and the Firefly Fries. Tasty! I could come here every night for a week.

Happy Hour: I don't think there is one, but who cares? It's all tapas and it's all cheap, so stop your bitchin'.

Price: Surprisingly reasonable for a place this nice. Anywhere from $5-$10 a plate. Really good quality dishes.

I've been here six times so far and it never gets old. It's forever staying on my short list of places I have to visit in Vegas.",PP7mV3SKVhtkuhwUDHUJXQ,6,2,5,P5JQ8cynN_3NB4zm_KW44w

This place was introduced to me about 6 years ago and I make sure I go every time I'm in Vegas.. Not even the food poising outbreak at the old location could stop me lol! We tried going the Friday night when we were in town and it was slammed packed. We went back the next day at about 2 and there were only 4 other parties in there at the time.. I stuck with the same dishes that I normally ordered, but my girlfriend was trying new things. I like the tapas style, bc it allows you to be able to share and try more things at once.

Bacon wrapped dates- these things are worse than a crack addiction, I'm assuming lol.. The bacon and the blue cheese go great with the dates. And it doesn't hurt that the bacon is crispy!

Shrimp ceviche- nice fresh taste, lots of shrimp and flavor. The avocado is always a nice touch.

Menchago mac n cheese- cheese cheese and more cheese. You know it's good when the cheese is still bubbling when it gets to the table.

Stuffed chicken and chorizo mushroom- the mushroom add a great texture, the the flavor of the chicken and the chorizo are on point.

I suggest you try the place out.. It not on the stipe but it's not far at all. Give it a try, I'm sure you will like it

1741357,2014-01-13,4,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"***Firefly is a decent and not too expensive alternative to the many overpriced Las Vegas restaurants on The Strip; unfortunately, there are some mediocre tapas here to go along with their good tapas and service was poor on my visit***

The Strip is filled with overpriced restaurants that churn out mediocre food.  Whether you are going to a fine dining restaurant or a cafe charging fine dining entree prices, chances are you are going to leave the restaurant feeling like you did not get much for your money.  Off The Strip though you will find more local spots and more bang for your buck in good quality and not outrageously pricey restaurants like Lotus of Siam (some may find Lotus of Siam pricey, but it is nothing like the Vegas fine dining spots charging sometimes twice as much as what that restaurant would cost in Los Angeles or other cities).

Firefly is off The Strip and it is a local spot.  It is a longstanding tapas restaurant with a huge following and maybe even a bigger menu.  With the big menu, it is not surprising that some dishes shine while others underwhelm.  Here is the rundown:

(Anchovy toasts with avocado) I liked these toasts.  It was nice having the flavorful anchovy as well as the creaminess from the fresh avocado.

(Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese and smoked almond, red wine reduction) The bacon was crispy and the date was sweet and I liked the blue cheese.  The crunchy almond was kind of odd and I did not like the red wine reduction--unnecessary and it kind of made the bacon wrapped dates overly sugary and soggy if you did not pluck the bacon wrapped dates out of the dish as soon as they came out.

(Camarones a la diabla, shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce, grilled bread) The shrimp was nicely cooked and plump and the sauce had a good amount of heat (a little too BBQ sauce-like though)

(Artichoke toasts, aioli, basil, pepper) The artichoke hearts were good--not as good as the anchovy toasts but still satisfying.

(Heirloom tomatoes, burrata, butter lettuce, basil, balsamic vinaigrette) The heirloom tomatoes were surprisingly juicy for not being in season and the burrata was very creamy (almost as good as the more expensive burrata at Mario Batali's B&B Ristorante in The Venetian / Palazzo).  Unfortunately, the butter lettuce was drenched in balsamic, which made this good green into nothing more than decorative garnish for the plate.

(Empanada with pork, red pepper cream cheese and aioli) I am not familiar with empanadas, but I thought these were good.  They have several other types of empanadas available.

(Padron Peppers) These flash-fried peppers had a nice light outside skin and some good heat.  They would be a nice addition to many dishes.

(Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms) A surprising amount of heat.

(Albondigas, meatballs in a sherry and tomato sauce with parmesan) These meatballs were average stuff in a simple tomato sauce.  I would have preferred freshly grated parmesan to the melted parmesan cheese here (which felt like it had been melted a long time ago and had been sitting around for a while).

(Camarones al ajillo, shrimp, lemon and garlic butter sauce) The shrimp were fine, but I thought the lemon, butter and scampi-like sauce was just okay.  Still, it was not too heavy or oily (I think many would like it).

(Steak and mushroom skewers, filet, roasted garlic cream sauce) I thought these were average; the meat was a tad dry.

(Fried calamari) Standard calamari.

Desserts were satisfying.  The caramel flan had a good flavor and the right texture and while the ice cream did not have an incredibly creamy consistency, the portion was generous and the flavors were pretty good (chocolate, vanilla, pistachio).  The chocolate tres leches cake definitely had the expected moistness of a tres leches cake as well as a light chocolate flavor.

Prices were reasonable.  The food was decent and you do not have to pay the outrageous prices that you have to pay on The Strip.

Service was poor.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace, but the staff was not attentive.  After putting in our order, the staff was pretty non-existent so getting drinks and water glasses refilled and receiving the bill took way too long.

Firefly has a dark and loud atmosphere.

Firefly is a good spot if you want a decent meal in Las Vegas but do not want to pay the typical outrageous Vegas prices.  It reminds me a lot of Long Beach's Cafe Sevilla in terms of menu choices and the quality of the food (though that Long Beach restaurant has much better service).

Firefly has its own parking lot (I believe it might be valet parking though).",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,10,7,3,B-h0Nl3k1Sdl_UJs91eujA

We met up on a Friday night for my first go at Firefly.  Luckily we were seated in a nice comfy booth because the place filled up really fast.  After eating here I knew why.  When dining with my Yelp friend I knew I would be trying a lot of food and stuffed to the gills.  

Upon putting our food order in, the food just seemed to roll out of the kitchen quickly and efficiently.   We started with the Chopped Chicken Salad.  It certainly wasn't the type of salad I was expecting but it was enjoyable.  The salad scoop was surrounded by endive leaves which made for a lovely presentation.  Plus it made a nice chicken salad 'boat' for consumption.  

Next I tried the Stuffed Dates.  Holy Buckets. It was my first time having dates with dreams of having this hot tapas again.  The bacon wrapped date with smoked almost and blue cheese was divine.  Since we were all sharing I couldn't eat the whole dish as much as I would've liked to.

To appease the men at the table, Chicago Beef Bocadillos were before us.  The shaved beef sandwiches were topped with house made giardiniera.  The beef was tender and full of flavor.  The giardiniera just made the sandwich better and earned a thumbs up.

The pork stuff Empanada was also a good choice.  I wish there were more on the plate for sharing like some of the other tapas but we all still had a little taste of hot pastry.  

Of course we can't skip dessert when they offer a Dessert Platter.  Flan, chocolate tres leches, cheesecake and a berry tart make up this delicious sampling of treats.  The chocolate tres leches stood out as the star on this platter.  The cake was soaked in goodness that you just shouldn't pass up.  

Service was ok as our waiter seemed to disappear for lengths of time.  I was guessing because it was a busy Friday evening so I might try another day of the week for my return visit. I left full with a smile.  See you next time!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,4,2,4,yrJLQWj3FSWrf8atJgyIDQ

We ordered several different items but like everyone else, the all time favorite is the bacon wrap dates. If I could choose one tapas to have for the rest of my life, it would be these, but I would probably become overweight extremely fast! 

It's a great restaurant considering majority of the items are small allowing you to try more food items at once. They also have larger entrees which are just as good. 

The only downside to this place is parking. Parking is so limited it forces you to valet and sometimes valet is full!

The young woman I spoke with told me I could have a 15 to 20 minute wait. I thought this was worth the chance and so we went. When we got there we found the restaurant nearly empty and had no problem getting a table immediately. Not sure why the hostess was so discouraging on the phone. We decided to order the chicken and mushroom paella ($24) with chorizo (extra$4) despite being warned that would take about 40 minutes to prepare. No problem, I nursed my beer and 40 minutes flew by.

I used to adore this place. If I was able to Yelp Firefly years ago, I would've given it four stars. 

I've been eating at Firefly for over ten years. I brought my boyfriend there last night because I used to love the cozy, intimate atmosphere and great food, and I wanted us to have a cute date night before he flew back East. 

It turns out the restaurant moved (to the old Z Tejas Grill building down the street?), which is a much bigger space. The atmosphere is gone. It's now a busy, loud restaurant like any other place in Las Vegas. I realize that the old Firefly was popular and always packed, so I see the need to expand. They just lost the charm in the process. 

I suggested we order the Serrano sliders, mushroom tart, and Manchego mac and cheese, because I've had them before and they were always great choices on the menu.  I felt like even the quality of food has changed, because I wasn't really impressed by any of the dishes.  

I gave Firefly two stars due to the fact that they changed so drastically, and not in a good way.  The food was not terrible, but it wasn't as flavorful and visually appealing as it was in the past. The mac and cheese was excellent, but the sliders and mushroom tarts were bland.  The chicken empanadas were boring and the lemon tart dessert tasted like mass produced tarts defrosted and topped with a few berries and whipped cream.

This time we went with the mixed paella, and it was enough to feed 4 people although there were only two of us. The service here is outstanding every time we come. From what I heard this last year was hard for Firefly because of a salmonella issue and scared off a lot of customers. As a veteran industry worker, this was sad to hear, but it happens to everyone, and I can't give enough kudos to the Firefly owner for stepping it up and resolving the issues immediately and moving forward. If I could offer any advice to the restaurant from a customer who just dined at the new location for the first time it would be that my experience was less intimate than at the older location. There is too much bright light in the building, and that needs to be addressed. A big part of why we come is for the intimate low-lit vibe with some gypsy kings on the loudspeaker.

I live in Southern California, so Vegas is like our back yard playground.  For the past few years, I have raved about Firefly; this semi, off-the-strip restaurant that didn't have a celebrity chef's named attached to it that still offered innovative and delicious food.  I would recommend this place to all of my friends and I initially gave them a 5 star review.

But a lot has happened since the first time I fell in love with Firefly.  

(1) The were shut down for Salmonella poisoning
(2) They closed down their first location
(3) Moved to a larger, new location
(4) Food quality went down the toilet

I took my husband to Firefly and all day, I had hyped up this amazing restaurant ... the ""best tapas"" I told him.
Oh man, the disappointment was equivalent to that of a kid finding coal under the tree on Christmas morning.

The food was salty and mediocre. There were some dishes that we didn't want to finish -- and these are tapas, small plates.  

Also, service was sub par.  They appeared to be slammed with guests or under-staffed.  It was difficult to catch the attention of any server and had different people serving us each time. Who was our waiter again?

Honestly, like I said before, I mean it when I say that it hurts me to write this review.  I would love to have Firefly back to the way that it used to be.  Somewhere, after the Salmonella poisoning and the move to their new location, they seemed to have lost their good taste and service.

I started with amazing gazpacho. So delicious as well as the baked goat cheese. This was much larger than we were anticipating and could feed more than 2 people easily as a starter. We also had the artichoke bread which was delicious and the chicken tika empanadas which were pretty good. The menu is pretty large and I would love to try other options.

1943040,2014-01-20,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Story Time - My bro and I were in Vegas for 3 days of golf. We asked the concierge at the hotel to recommend a restaurant in Vegas, not necessarily on the strip. He gave us two to pick from. Battistas www.battistaslasvegas.com/ - ""Italian Food"" and Firefly ""Tapas"".   

We navigated to the Strip and ended up closer to Battistas.   The smell of the food was great, but there was no ambiance and having Chablis as the included wine was not working for me.  So, I pulled my brother out of there pronto and we drove to Firefly.

When we arrived at Firely, we walked in to ambiance and vibe.  Yes, this place had a buzz and I knew I had made the right decision.  No wait on a Monday night, yeah.   

Our server was excellent and somehow we merged our picks from the great tapas on the menu for one of the best meals I have ever had.

From memory, the following were our choices.

Heirloom Tomato Salad  -  One of the best salad dressings (the cheese they use in combination with the balsamic dressing was out of this world good).

Risotto Stuffed Peppers - Amazingly simple, but just the kind of Tapas I love.   

Ahi Tuna with Mango on skewers -  If there was a flaw in anything, the mangos were a bit unripe, but it was still really good.

Lamb Chops -  Small lamb chops.  I do not each red meat, so this was for my bro.  But, I am not religious and had a nibble, they were amazing and the sauce was great.

The garlic butter with the bread was so good, I have to mention that too.

The food was so amazing, we came back the next night after playing 36 holes of golf.   We were a solid 40 minute drive away, but the food was so good, we had to come back.  Unfortunately, we tried to broaden the orders and made a few choices that were not as good.  Gary ordered the fried calamari, but in hindsight, it is always good and it was not something that stood out with so many other amazing choices on the menu.   

In any case, if you are in Vegas, you gotta visit this great spot!",LCqq8RYHElICU2F_8dX9Wg,5,1,5,c8ZtV57YWamuP4yCqyhjXQ

I have yet to find a tapas place in LA with food, atmosphere, and pricing as great as this place! If your going to be on the strip this has got to be one of your stops for a girls night or dinner date trust me everyone will be thanking you later!

Atmosphere is fun and flirty here! Love the accents of red and the lighting, service was also really good- our waitress was very accommodating and despite how busy they were her service stayed considerably great throughout the night. 

Sangria!!!! About every table had a bottle so we knew it was good, we got both the red and white fruit sangria- I preferred the red but both were bomb! I really can't wait to try their Mojitos next time :).

The tapas here are 5 stars worthy and the price just can't be beat!!!! Love that each person can order a few things to try something different. It was perfect for a large group because it ensured that everyone would find something they liked & the tapas style makes people more open to sharing lol. 

Recommend: 
- the mussels in their broth are outstanding, everyone was jealous they missed ordering this one, it's definitely a meal within itself bc you won't be able to resist dunking your bread into it.
- calamari was good, great dipping sauce.
-ahi tuna tartar was fresh & light

While it's true you can't order anything that's bad on the menu there are a few more items that pop out with perfect pitch.  It would be a crime to come to this restaurant and not order the stuff dates. They easily nail the perfect sangria but don't let that stop you from experiencing the infused vodkas. I highly recommend this place bring your friends and have a wonderful time.

The highlights of our meal were the shrimp diablo, clams with chorizo, chicken tinge empanadas, white sangria, and the apple/manchago salad.  I've never been so impressed by a salad before!

Why didn't I come to Firefly sooner?!* Sampled several dishes, was mostly pleased with the flavors and quality. Servers are professional but are assigned far too many tables, and I imagine it only got worse- they were considerably busier by the time we left.

BOQUERONES ($7): 4  tasty toasts with a mix of compatible toppings including anchovies, avocado, roasted red peppers, and a lemony drizzle. Bright and fresh! 
BEET SALAD ($7.50): roasted red and gold beets with vin-dressed greens and pecan crusted goat cheese. Definitely my kind of dish.
STUFFED DATES ($6.5): wayyy too rich for me, but I can see why they're a favorite for others
STUFFED PEPPERS ($8.5): piquillos with mozz and garlic cream cheese, in a tomato sauce with crispy fried and fresh green onions. Think of a classy version of jalapeno poppers, but with a different kind of pepper. Almost too cheesy for me, but good.
PULPO ASADO ($10):  I didn't like this at all.  Potatoes and tomatoes were not enough to save the unappealing octopus. Menu claims it is grilled but seemed boiled or overcooked, unfavorable texture.
ALBONDIGAS ($7): dish of mini meatballs in sherry sauce, basic but successful.
MERGUEZ ($10): two links of spicy lamb sausage with a heap of roasted red peppers and two tiny slices of bread. Sausage and peppers had a good kick to them, but the lack of accompanying bread made it hard to enjoy this dish without chopping it up and rearranging like a stir fry.

Difficult to give a rating: I usually round down but this 3.5 is going up because I definitely want to come back for paella and sangria. 


* Rhetorical question: their negative reputation precedes them, unfortunately. Lots of locals still associate the restaurant with their old (but serious) salmonella outbreak from 2013, but if you look up the stats on SNHD, they've received As on all inspections for nearly two years.

Sure, it's bigger and newer. But it's just not the same. The prices have dramatically increase over the years. Most tapas have gone up $2-$3.50 each. So it's no longer as cheap as it once was. But nonetheless, it's still a decent cost-quality trade off. So, in other words, the food is tasty and the prices ain't bad (even if they are steeper than they used to be).

And while I miss the old place, I do have to admit this newer version is quite nice. It's just intimate enough, just dark enough, just decorated enough, etc. And the bar area is huge and really nice space. Fair warning: Happy hour can make the bar area quite crowded. I also really like the patio area too.

The service we experienced here was fabulous. Very attentive and friendly.

The menu has just so many good items. The flavored mojitos and sangrias are all amazing. And I've never had a bad or even so-so tapa here. The stuffed peppers and mac 'n' cheese will forever be personal favorites. And then there's the steak and mushrooms skewers, the petite filet, the shrimp, the mussels, the gazpacho, the dates, the meatballs... It's all good eats.

Some friends and I came for dinner one night before seeing a show. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, which was delicious. It has fresh cut up fruit and brandy, yum yum. It's safe to say I had a nice buzz going on after a couple drinks. Firefly is all tapas, or small plates. These are good for sharing which is why I like going with a group. My favorite thing on the menu is the stuffed dates. They are wrapped in bacon, and stuffed with blue cheese. Fun fact, I don't even like blue cheese, but the combination of these things is AMAZING. Do get these, and thank me later. 

To be honest, I can't remember too much else because that brandy got ya girl feeling randy, or something like that. LoL. If you haven't done so, give this place a shot, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,5,4,YHp6DS7ilp6huOEkJ_Yazw

Bacon wrapped dates: soaked in sauce and hence made the dish soggy.  Bacon was somehow over cooked and yet the dish came out lukewarm.

Empanadas: pretty heavy and salty.  The sauce on the outside is probably unnecessary as the dish is already flavorful.  The empanadas breaking was cooked well.

Serrano ham sliders:  a little salty as the ham itself is already flavorful.  There is a spicy kick that is offset well by the bleu cheese.  

Chorizo clams: broth is great.  Still  n the salty side but you get some more bread to dip into the broth.  Worth it to just be able to dip the bread.

This was enough food for two people so not bad

The tapas here are so damn good. The scallops ""escargot"" are buttery and cooked just right. The camarones aljillo, tuna tartare (with taro chips), shrimp ceviche, steak and mushroom skewers MUST TRY THESE), and any of their empanadas are always what I order right away. Did I also mention they have bacon wrapped dates? Try them. They sound weird, but so worth it.

If the party being seated to eat is more than 6 people, gratuity is already included in bill.

This place was worth a shot, but I think it needs some help with ambience. When you first walk in it feels sexy and intriguing, but the further into the restaurant you go the more it feels like just a dimly lit casual restaurant (NOT a compliment). 

Nonetheless, the servers were pretty nice, and the dishes came out at a good pace. It was definitely a very solid dinner, if you count only the ""easy"" dishes.

We were able to make reservations through open table via the yelp app (very cool and super easy)! Based upon reviews of Helpers and friends Firefly was surely a place that would please our curious appetites.
The service we received was attentive and extremely helpful. Our server had us stop ordering after we selected 6 items suggesting that it may be too much food for 2 people. I had a craving for a cocktail and order the Cherry Mule. It was such a creative take on the Moscow Mule with the twist of adding the St. Germaine's lovely flavor. Thebread and butter was absolutely a great pairing. The butter was sweet and the bread was slightly salty. Our server recommended the figs which we loved! They were stuffed with candied walnuts and sprinkled with cheese as well as a great lightly drizzled sauce. Next were the tuna tartar & ceviche. The tuna tartar was accompanied by fried taro chips and not only did it look good it was also very filling. If I had to pick a favorite of the Tuna Tartar and the Ceviche, then it'd be the ceviche hands down. It was so flavorful and refreshing! The next item was the spicy beef salad and item did not disappoint with its slight kick and yummy dressing! We decided to try out the Diablo shrimp and octopus. Of the 2 dishes I'd recommend the shrimp over the octopus since octopus seemed to have too much going on. We decided to add another dish for good measure. I must confess that Chicken AND Chorizo was my absolute favorite dish!!!! What an amaze combo of tastiness! 
To end our meal we ordered the gelato trio and chocolate trees leches cake. The chocolate tres leches cake was ok. I've had better versions in Santa Ana and at other establishments, but the Gelato Trio was spot on!",9PfyJzvwx4d5SNPDOeHO_Q,1,0,4,TLu7EPesH7E-dihD2SO2uw

We arrived at 7:30 or 7:35 and were seated at about 7:45. The ambiance was nice and I as digging the vibe. We were seated and were kind of discouraged right off the bat when the servers were around our table but no one came to introduce themselves, ask for our drink order, or if we wanted to start off with any of the tapas. Thirty minutes later we flagged someone down to ask if we could order drinks and food... And had to flag people down for another thirty minutes afterward. The restaurant was quite loud and busy, but other tables were being served and we were right next to the server station and bar and couldn't get anyone to take our order! After I explained that it was my sister-in-laws bachelorette the staff became more attentive. The saving grace was most definitely the food and mojitos. The bacon-wrapped dates and ceviche were amazing, as well as the pork empanadas. 

All in all, the food and drinks were delicious but the service leaves much to be desired. We are visiting from the east coast and my future sister-in-law was bummed that we were being looked over on what was supposed to be a fun evening out. The photographer that snaps a picture of you while you're trying to enjoy your food really brought us down a notch too. She then comes back later and tries to sell you the photos for $15 apiece...

The happy hour here is great. The pear martini is delish. Not too sweet. I really like the sangria, I usually get a pitcher. Sometimes two. :P

The boqueronea are toasts with anchovies, avacado, and lemon drizzle. Super super good. Nice and fresh. Not too heavy.
The roasted eggplant cannolini with goat cheese is also quite good. I'm a sucker for goat cheese.
The beet salad is probably my favorite. Also has nut crusted goat cheese. 
The stuffed dates are probably the most popular dish, and for good reason. They have an almond inside with of course...goat cheese. So delish. These are pretty rich, however.
Stuffed peppers have mozz and cream cheese. It's like jalapeno poppers but fancy.

I've also had a few of their salads, the steak one is my fav. Just look at the menu. You'll know why.

We had the ""Tapas Banquet""
Toasted bread, Olives and almond butter
artichoke toasts -  artichoke hearts, aioli, basil and pepper 
Stuffed dates - smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese wrapped in bacon
Baby back ribs - with mango BBQ sauce
patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) - Roasted potatoes with spicy aioli
steak and mushroom skewers - Grilled Fillet, roasted garlic cream and red wine reduction.
camarones a la diabla - shrimp in a sweet and spicy sauce.
Chocolate très lèches cake.

My favorites were the Mango BBQ baby back ribs, i didn't taste any mango but it was definitely really tender and fall off the bone, and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  Bacon wrapped dates, smoky/savory and sweet at the same time too.  I think my favorite of all was the spicy potatoes, so good, i love a good tangy aioli and especially a spicy one it went really well with the potatoes, I'd put that sauce on a burger or even their fries any day of the week.  At first bight its really hot, but it wasn't the kind of hot that multiplies as you eat it.  I think as the dinner went on i got used to it so i just kept eating more and more of it.  So good!

First off, drinks - The sangrias are delicious and refreshing. We got the red and sparkling sangrias and the sparkling is definitely a winner

Bread with almond butter - The almond butter was soo good! Creamy with a little kick

Bacon wrapped dates - Must try! Sweet and salty combo was great! Theres a surprise nut in the middle.

Tierra y mar skewers - sooo good and tender with a chile verde sauce. Comes with sausage, filet and shrimp

Scallop Escargo - Garlic butter sauce is delish I wanted to drink that sauce

Steak skewers with gravy sauce, Yum!!!! Meat was very tender and flavorful

And last but not least Paella - Very tasty and plentiful. Flavor is good and it has a little heat.

Service is really good. Servers are nice and attentive. We'll be back here every time we're in Vegas!",EOSdJO9YY4g3GL0Hwj093g,0,0,5,4oqVMCB378zwncIhFC367Q

We ate at some of the ""nicest"" places we could find (not trying to be snooty, just dropping a benchmark for everyone) Firefly was our favorite spot on our four day adventure. The service was outstanding and the food...ohhhh the food...

We started at the bar with the house infused vodka..I knew we were off to a good start when it hit the lips. I initially thought there couldn't be any vodka in it because it was so smooth and at six dollars, I guess I was still in the twelve dollar mind set for hotel rum and cokes. 

We were quickly seated by Irinia Omar, who became known as the Tapas wizard. We're passive aggressive in the fact that we like to order a few dishes and then have our server pick a few. There were four of us just to complicate things a little more. Some servers balk at this and are very hesitant to offer their opinion, let alone make the final call. After a few quick questions Irinia smiled and headed off. Then the onslaught of food began..the tomato bread followed by the tuna tartare, and chorizo plate set the stage in the chilled Tapas department, then the fun began. The stuffed dates, baked goat cheese, grilled octopus, spicy shrimp, scallops, empanadas, and lamb chops were to die for. We regret we didn't try at least one Paella (that was our choice ) but by the end when the desserts came out it really didn't matter. 

At this point in the night after the onslaught of tapas and a few samples of the cocktail list, we were now in a battle against the food. We had to almost force down the desserts, the tres leches and bread pudding won. 

The manager, Jon was very personable and friendly and made sure our group was taken care of and was overly apologetic when a group of twenty seated beside us quickly grew to the unplanned group of thirty and we volunteered to move tables to allow everyone to be seated.  Jon runs a very clean and efficient restaurant, and is quick to jump in and make sure his customers are enjoying themselves and are full. 

If your in Vegas and you want an awesome and unique meal put Firefly at the top of your list. You won't be sorry. I would put Firefly up against ANY of the other ""well known"" establishments in a food off any day.",r3QbTqU4GnDeFVZyUSH_Mw,2,0,5,7p0kAJPVIITfYtnJBRCR7w

Bread was stale and tough. The blood orange mojito was highly recommended to us so we decided to try it. For $30, I thought it would be savory. Unfortunately, it tasted like some juice mixture I made in high school. It was barely drinkable and tasted like bottom shelf liquor. Not worth the money. The food was just ok, for small plates, could have been better. I just wish the service had been better to reflect the food and create a better experience for us.  Menu is very boring and the ambiance is very pretentious.

Smoked salmon bagels $9

Patatas Bravas $7

Fried Calamari $10

Ahi Tuna Skewer $10

Chicken Tinga Empanada $7

Vanilla Yogurt Mousse $7

First of all, we were told that this is a spanish style resto with emphasis on tapas. All of the food tasted pretty good. The bagels were great mostly bc the bagels were toasted perfectly and that caper dill cream was pretty tasty. The patatas bravas was pretty much an elegant version of roasted potatoes. I wish the friend calamari came with a acidic sauce like a tomato-based sauce bc eating it with tartar sauce can get pretty heavy. The Ahi Tuna Skewer was the best tasting dish for me. The ginger soy glaze on it actually reminded me more of Hawaii than Spain.  The Empanada was pretty good...light and fluffy and not greasy at all. Im glad it came with a side salad. The vanilla yogurt mousse was ok. It was like not as heavy melted ice cream mixed with fruit. The crispy sugar cookie sticks that came with it were probably one of the best cookies i've ever tasted and made a good dipping partner for the mousse. Overall, I would say this place is pretty good.

This place is a gem, especially for overpriced food served at big hotels in Las Vegas. I hope Firefly on Paradise will stay true to their quality and continue serving delicious food. Next time we are in LV we will definitely come back with our friends.

The only negative is Citrus Bliss drink ($10) -- they have to improve their cocktails if they expect people to order more of them. This one had very artificial taste, as if they added dry 20 cents mix to it so we just put it aside. In house made white wine sangria was fresh and tasty, but I would prefer it with less ice in a pitcher.

The amazing thing about ordering tapas is that you don't have to commit to a huge meal which can be hit or miss. Instead, you order a lot of different tapas for the table and have fun sampling differed food. Highly recommended!",nZ6OGzoZVyChxbeTcD1Rqw,0,0,4,pVHJJ9O-GpDJI_xPr56OEQ

Nicely decorated interior. Place was packed. Nice vibe. Very loud. Very large interior with small tables and booths. So be sure to make a reservation. 

Service was good. The waiter didn't balk at our massive order for two. Be careful though when ordering the Paella. It takes a long time to cook.

We ordered the entire menu it seemed liked:

Combo Paella - Bomb! But takes forever to come out. Order in the beginning. 

Stuffed Dates - Fire!

Tuna Poke with Chips - really good

Serrano Ham - really good

Fruit and Cheese platter - So good, I don't know why it's on the dessert menu

Beef empanada - Fire!

BBQ ribs - Fire

Lamb Chops - Bomb!

Han Croquettes - Would have been good but were cold

Fried Calamari - Good

Ricotta cheese served hot - Fire!

Steak/Shrimp/Pork skewers - So Good

Mushroom Pastry - Ok

Bread pudding - Really Good

Nutella sandwiches - ok

We enjoyed a bottle of wine, the bacon wrapped dates, pork empanada, clams and chorizo, the octopus, and the lamb chops. Every option was cooked to perfection and delicious! We made the mistake of ordering a little too much just because of the portion size being larger than anticipated. It provided the substance we needed before a night of drinking at a concert. The icing on the cake.. our wine and feast were all for under $100!  I think I just broke $100 with a $20 tip.

My veggie empanada was a really weird combination of things thrown together that tasted old. And the paella, although cooked fresh, was not very flavorful. 

The servers kept ignoring us, although I wouldn't think a table of 9 is easy to miss. When they took the orders, we did ask ahead of time to split it 3-way for it to be easier. When I told her my order, I said the ceviche and veggie empanada... When the food came out, they gave us an extra plate of tartare and said I ordered it. When I said no and repeated my order, she insisted I said so, even though my eating buddies said no as well. Even more so she avoided our table, and then the new waitress came over 3 times to fill 10 ml of water (it was about an inch tall in the glass). But even then, when we told her our needs, service came really slowly (I believe water girl isn't supposed to do more than fill water and run small errands)...

Tierra Mar skewers ; Surf 'n Turf for us fogies- were recommended but  a bit too many things goin' on for my taste.
Summer Salad with heirloom tomatoes- for Vegas OK - but not primo  by west coast standards.Greenhouse stuff , not the aroma you expect.
The interior is full of options, inside, outside, bar, tables what ever you like. The best thing is that with a group of people everyone will find something they can own and get behind.
Beers , or a pitcher of  white or red sangrias ,you can't beat that for  $ 28-
The place beats the pants off the typical Strip crowd, it's easy, and can be quick or slow as you like. Great early or late- you could do a lot worse.  It's more about the company you 're  with than the restaurant IMO- this place will support whatever is you are trying to make of the evening.Salut.",ZpaGVCVJHPYcd47YL5YX_Q,0,0,4,ygOA5Uyqal0KPOwFhjJu6w

We had the patatas brava and wasn't to impressed by it the potatoes were not crispy my daughter had this in Barcelona and it was not up to par and we also had the huevos estrellados which is similar to the braves but with a fried egg and chorizo.  I was waiting for the server to mention that I had  2 potato dishes but he said nothing and it was a little better but I have to say that both potato dishes seemed like they sat around for awhile. Someplace place use the 2 fry method to crisp them up but it seems like over fried once trying crisp them but it was not.

Then we had octopus(pulpo Saadi)was really good and tender.  Next came the warm Spinach salad and it's just okay.    The ipaella finally showed up and it was okay but not prepared properly it had no socarrat at the bottom of the pan which I was looking for; the flavor was rather muted.

We had dessert the cherry bread pudding and flan.   The bread could have more edge it lacked any cherry flavor but the flan was one the best I had in flavor and texture not heavy or aerated it was perfect.",MljQrqqvCaNr_yvCRohuxQ,4,0,3,AS0GIor4K3eX2r-HZ-cFZQ

I communicated primarily with Regina to set everything up. I'm a project manager, so I tend to over communicate, and communicate frequently, and expect the same in return. Sometimes I would have to follow-up for a response, which made me hesitant at times, but on the day of the event, it was clear that everyone (including all of the vendors) had communicated just fine, and Regina had everything set up perfectly. Our other vendors included a DJ, Elvis w/ Showgirls, & a Desert Bar. We had a bar set up in the back for our guests, and we thought they did a great job separating the rooms for cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing. The best part, Firefly's food! It did not fail. I was nervous that if we had a lot of food, it would come out cold, and slow. I was wrong. It came out hot, and quick. The only complaint from my guests were that they wish they knew what was coming out- as they ate a lot in the beginning, but didn't realize how many courses there were. My Grandmother wasn't a fan of the food (very different for her!), but they were so nice to make her some ribs with no sauce, and she was happy. All in all, we were very happy with our event at Firefly, and I was glad I didn't need to worry about a thing! Thank you!!",0UNJ1_MiC0ExiDDBvrgdFA,0,0,5,N45uNCwDIGM6Z_QVBF4fEw

Jesus was our server and was very attentive throughout the meal. The warm bread served with the honey butter is always a nice way to start the meal, of course we had another hot batch mid way ;-)

We started out with waters and a pitcher of sparkling sangria. Very good and dangerous as you can barely taste any alcohol 5/5. We began with some stuffed dates which are... amaze balls 5/5! We also had a couple orders of the Firefly fries 3/5 and a tomato basil soup 2/5. 

Since we arrived early in the day they had breakfast tapas available so we tried the Huevos Rancheros 4/5 and the brunch potato bravas 4/5. Camarones Al Ajillo were very good 5/5. We also ordered some of my favorites: Scallop Escargots 4/5, Tierra Mar Skewers 4/5, Albondigas 5/5 and another 2 orders of stuffed dates. To try something new we ordered the Petite Filet 4/5, Pulpo Asado 4/5 and fried calamari 4/5.

Overall a good lunch and everyone enjoyed the variety. For dessert they brought out a flan and sang Happy Birthday. The rest of us tried the Banana Beignet 4/5 and the trio of Gelato 4/5.

I live in LA, where ""tapas"" are like $20 each and you get a serving that looks like a Costco sample. I was hesitant about coming here but I wanted to try and be a good son for once so we tried it out. 

The menu is HUGE. Lots of options that made the decision difficult so we just said funk it and ordered a bunch of stuff. Avocado toast, chilequiles, steak and mushroom skewers, calamari, a couple other things I can't remember, and the chicken mushroom paella. The paella was decent, nothing groundbreaking, but all the tapas were DELICIOUS. And affordably priced for the generous portions. I was surprised. We didn't really need to eat the paella by the time it came out but we're American so obviously we didn't just stop eating when we were full. Come on.

Service was kind of bad, but the waiter made up for it by offering a complimentary espresso and a flan for my mother. I didn't eat any, but my mom said the flan was amazing.

The Paella takes about 40 minutes to prepare so make sure you order that with your waiter as soon as you sit down! 

They bring out a nice garlic herb bread with sweet almond butter while you are waiting for your food. my party ordered the ceviche, tuna tartare with taro chips, bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, and pulpo asado (grilled octopus). All of the tapas were delicious and left us craving for more but we knew not to order any more while we waited on our paella. The paella came out and it was huge! I do not understand how a paella serves 2-4 people. I cannot imagine 2 people sharing a whole paella. The paella was good with a nice assortment of seafood and meats. However, it was a little disappointing that the paella didn't have any soccarat at all. I understand that it was probably because they were in a rush to serve us since we were sitting there with no food after we finished our tapas. However, I would have rather waited for the paella to finish cooking fully. 

Overall, good food, good service and nice atmosphere/decor! I would definitely just stick with the tapas next time though.

Before we could order drinks someone came and told us we can't take that table without ordering and it's not our turn yet! There were 3 other empty small bar tables!

2655795,2015-02-03,9,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Located just South of the Strip, Firefly on Paradise has become an essential stop that brightens the already ecstatic Vegas experience usually felt by yours truly.

This place oozes Vegas in all senses. From the dim lights above, to the bright lights around the bar and along the walkways, the banter, laughter, cheers, showoffs, care-nots, great service and what matters the most, GREAT food.  

The wait was (and usually is) relatively long as we entered the packed house. It was just my sister and I.. that being the case, we noticed a couple available stools bar-top and nabbed them on the (fire)fly. It's not necessarily the case in ALL restaurants with a bar, but I noticed that because there's more action here, you'll probably get an attentive bartender, prompt service and  a quicker food turn around time. 

Spanish tapas / small plate style.. Ladies and gentlemen, this means you'll be eating more than one dish tonight!  

First dish that was placed before us was the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.. though quite small in size, they definitely pack a punch when it comes to flavor.. probably because of the chorizo.

Second, Serrano Sliders.. mini burgers with Serrano ham, bleu cheese & crispy onions, cooked Medium rare; Not sure why we ordered mini-burgers.. they played the 'void' filler until our next dish arrived. I enjoyed the bleu cheese, but asked for medium rare and they came back to us a little too well done.. dry & crunchy. They happily replaced them and got us a new order within minutes. Very nice service.

Third, Steamed Mussles.. steamed in white wine with an heirloom tomato, garlic, herb butter with parmesan crustini. I'm not even a fan of the things, but the Mussels were the best tasting seafood item that I've had in a quick minute. It's really the sauce that made it.. the best way I can describe it would be the equivalent to a creamy Alfredo, minus the pasta. It masked that 'fresh out of the water' taste, which I don't mind.

And Fourth, the item that stole my heart.. the baby back ribs covered with an out of this world BBQ mango sauce. Fall off the bone tenderness covered with a sweet finger lickin' sauce that'll have your tongue and lips slurpin' and smackin' through every bite. I'd get a full rack of these alone. Straight up, yo. 

Our bartender was on point; we were continuously checked on, had our waters refilled, if my beer was low another was offered (this is how you keep me here) and aside from the slider mishap.. everything here was tasty and the atmosphere sparked the perfect start for our night. We'll be back to explore the rest of that menu!",jbOJV077QCGzduE6zFYO_A,14,10,5,El-BsVuzUYhBXHKmg8i99Q

So many great bites to choose from, some of my favorite are the Ahi Tuna Skewer, Steak & Mushroom Skewer, Baked Goat Cheese, Camarones ala Diabla, and Camarones Al Ajillo. The Stuffed Dates are usually my top pick, but they skimped on the goat cheese and the dates where tiny and dry this time. While the Flourless Chocolate Cake with raspberries was tasty, it was not moist.

2671877,2016-04-11,1,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Long overdue review. Came here in Feb during our trip to Vegas. This was the one restaurant that I was dying to try in Vegas. So I made the BF drive here straight from the airport, even before we checked into our hotel.  

Firefly sits in an unassuming location off the strip. I didn't expect it to be so big inside, but I guess everything is bigger in Vegas (or is that Texas?). Anyway, came during late lunchtime on a weekday, so the place was pretty empty. The menu looked so good that I wanted to order one of everything, but the BF convinced me to start with just five dishes first, probably a more sensible approach. 

Here are the dishes we tried:
Stuff Dates - my favorite dish! To be fair, I rarely met a stuffed date dish that I didn't like. The combination of the soft sweet dates, crunchy salty bacon and the stinky Gorgonzola cheese is just heavenly. 

Lamb Chops - oh how I love my lamb chops. I always try order it when I see it on the menu, even though most of my friends can't stand the taste of lamb (whatever, more for me). The chops here were seasoned well and perfectly cooked. The accompanied lentils and vegetables made me feel healthy, despite the fact that I just inhaled two lamb chops. 

Stuffed Peppers - not a dish that I would normally order, but I am so glad I listened to our waiter and got it here. The peppers had just a hint of spiciness and provided a perfect balance to the creamed cheese. I still think about this dish today... 

Shrimp in Sweet & Spicy Sauce - shrimps were well cooked, I didn't really taste the spicy note in the sauce, but it was a good sauce nevertheless 

Tuna Tartare - the most average dish among the ones we tried. I didn't think the tuna was very flavorful, although the taro chips were good. 

Trio of Gelato and Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - oh that cake, it was what dreams were made of, so fluffy, so moist and so chocolaty. I would marry it if I could. Or at least date it for as long as I can without the BF getting jealous. It was sooo perfect. The gelato were good too, but, they were like the jealous bridesmaids next to the cake. 

The service was a little weird, our waiter was extremely attentive in the beginning with recommendations and water refills. All five of our dishes came out in extremely quick successions, I understand the place was pretty quiet, but they could've slowed down and allowed us to savor the food instead of rushing us. Our small table was covered in plates in the span of 10 minutes. Also, our waiter disappeared once we've put the dessert and coffee order in.  I had to track down another waiter to finally get my coffee. Moreover the coffee came in a comically small cup, it was more like an espresso cup. I would normally take off a star for the weird service, but the food was soooo good that I am will to overlook it. 

Overall, I highly recommend the place, wish they would open an outpost in NYC!!",C6_ViNwMNnLHDbbtCwDZuA,1,1,5,a8Y30o8JW-5paKXye-gLOg

They have a wide variety of items you can choose from, and basic items with a twist. They also serve paella that is made to order, so you have to give them 40 minutes to prepare. 

They start you off with some garlic bread and their house butter. It was sweet, and balanced very well with the savory flavors.

We ordered the firefly fish sticks, and I was pleased with the crispness of the Japanese bread crumbs. The spicy tartar sauce wasn't spicy at all, but it had a slight kick to it. 

The vegetable empanada was delicious. The breading had a wonderful texture; soft, buttery and flakey. 

We also ordered ribs, that were doused in their mango barbecue sauce. The meat just fell off the bone. It was so soft and tender! The mango chunks and the sweetness of the sauce created a beautiful symphony of flavors!

Finally, we finished the meal off with a pan of chicken and mushroom paella. It was filled with flavors, that just made you want to eat more! By this point of the meal, I was already full, but I just couldn't stop eating.

To top it all off, we then ordered a chocolate tres leches, which was also very delicious. Super soft and moist! Tastes even better with the chocolate bits drizzled around the plate!

To say that these deserts were exquisite would be an understatement! 

The service was great as well, zero complaints there! The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the atmosphere was not what one would think one when thinking of a Spanish tapas restaurant.

2776274,2015-01-24,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"i have mixed feelings about spanish tapas places in general but i did have a really enjoyable meal here. my friend and i each had a sangria, red and white, and both were really good, not too sweet, and shared the following:

tuna tartare, roasted eggplant, spicy beef salad, grilled octopus, lamb chops, and empanadas. everything was really good but a lot of them were on the salty side. my favorites were the octopus, which was super super tender, and the tartare, which is almost always my favorite anywhere it's good. this one could have used more avocado, but that's just a personal preference.

one complaint i have about the place that's not really a complaint is that the portion size is huge - the biggest i've ever seen with tapas. it just made me sad because we had to order everything to try it, but couldn't finish everything. as with any tapas, a bigger group is better. regardless i would have liked to see smaller portions at slightly lower prices, though the prices are still really reasonable.

the service was good and the place was just a normal seeming restaurant atmosphere wise. this is only the second tapas place i had tried in vegas and the other was the fancy one in the aria on the strip. this is way better!",9EI94e2iuU7-zWxr05eJGQ,1,1,4,LGXGfDvpTTjfD-m-zRDLJA

First, you should order the sangria. Delicious! The menu is primarily made up of small plates, or tapas. There is a large variety of selections, from salads, to chicken and steak, to seafood. Most are prices from $6 to 11 each. We have been there numerous times, so we've had many of their offerings, which are consistently excellent.

In our most recent trip, we were served by Alejandro and his assistant, Roberto. Both were personable and attentive. They made great recommendations, which helped us, even though we have been several times before.

We started with the plate of serrano ham and manchego cheese. Served with bread and sun dried tomatoes, it was a great start.

We followed this up with the pardon peppers and pork empanadas. Both were great. The pork empanadas were cooked perfectly and tasted terrific.

We followed these with an order of the Tierra y Mar skewers (skewers of shrimp, beef and chorizo) and another order or sangria! When we asked Roberto about his favorite dish, he suggested an order of the camarones a la diabla, so we ordered that, too. Both dishes were outstanding!

Without saying much, the second pitcher of sangria was better than the first.

there's a strongly Spanish and seductive vibe which i'm definitely diggin' - the intimate lighting, red tones, spanish dancers and bullfighter paintings adorning the walls, the uniquely patterned wallpaper, i love it all. 

definitely a place you want to bring someone special or a Ladyfriend you're trying to impress. good times will be had over their tapas, calamari, sliders, octopus (my favorite), bacon-wrapped dates, etc. the cocktails are on point as well.

Every time I decide to try a new restaurant in town, I almost immediately regret not going to my faithful FireFly. 

I've been a regular for about a year now, and I'm never disappointed. I love the tapas style. Tapas meaning small plate, If you didn't already know that. It's great to share a few plates with a friend or scarf a few down all to yourself. 

I'm a vegetarian but I have no problem with options here! 
Some of my favorite plates include;
-Apple and manchego salad- scrumptious and light 
-Artichoke toasts- a delicious little snack 
-Veggie Empanada- Pretty filling 
-Warm spinach salad- healthy and yummy 
And of course the Manchego Mac and Cheese if you can afford the calories!  

Not to mention the pistachio gelato! To freakin die for. 

As for drinks, the sangria's, both red and white are delicious. 
My personal faves are ""The new girl"" a red vodka drink infused with a hint of jalapeño! Yum! 
And the ""cherry mule"" a Moscow mule with cherry flavored  grey goose! 

Ok, but MOST IMPORTANTLY.... The servers and bartenders. 
Athena, Omar and Eduardo are so sweet and they always take such good care of me! 
I love it when I walk in and they greet me like a friend, and then ask, ""your usual?"" Maybe it's because I come here too often, or maybe it's because they're great at serving their loyal customers!

It was super unfortunate what happened a few years ago with the food poisoning but don't let that change your mind about dining here. The food is still amazing but their prices did go up a few dollars per item.
This trendy restaurant has always been my favorite Spanish tapas go-to. The flavors never disappoint! I love their tuna tartare and artichoke toasts but tonight I tried some new dishes. The smoked salmon bagels and scallops were a great pick! Larger than expected and a flavor explosion in my mouth!
The only reason I can't give 5* is because the service is still amiss. Our server was friendly but he did forget to put in half my order. When the food runners dropped off food, they literally drop it and run away, instead of taking pride in the dish and announcing what it is. Our drinks were also always empty.

All the tapas are $4.50-$8 each and the drinks were reasonable too. The result - 6 items and drinks for under $50 for the two of us!

We had:
Chicken Empanadas - my favorite dish, flakey and full of flavor; a lot lighter than a typical empanada. Excellent.

Tuna Tartar - not the best tuna I have eaten but for $8 it was decent for the price

Bacon wrapped almond fig - okay no the official name but you will see the one I am talking about it. If you like bacon order it. The perfect blend of salty and sweet. Has a bit of blue cheese and a balsamic type sauce. Very good.

Apple and Manchu Salad - really awesome. a light and yummy summer salad. I love the fresh green apple cut julian with the almost-blue-cheese. 

Garlic bread with almond butter - the free dish was probably the most unique. I need to know where they got the almond butter from because it was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was galic meets peanut butter, but not. It looked and spread like butter but tasted creamer. So good.

Dessert - Gelato Trio - 3 excellent flavors: chocolate, vanilla and my favorite the pistachio.

Sangria it was the sparkling white one aged for 3 days; very good for a hot summer day

No this wasn't the quality of San Fran tapas but it gets 4 stars for being cheaper than eating at the Olive Garden and excellent food. I will be back on my next trip to Vegas.",OPtv-lFAgcddoUuHCcTHUQ,1,0,4,frV8xJzFA34W40ZEdPB40Q

The waiter recommended 2 items and they were exactly what I had my eye on! So I got the stuffed dates and Tierra y mar from the Hot Tapas menu. Both were awesome. The dates were almonds, dates and then bacon-wrapped and had a red wine reduction and blue cheese on top. The Tierra y Mar was grilled chorizo, shrimp and steak skewers with salsa. Delicious!

My friends and I came into Vegas on Friday, and decided to check this place out. Prices are fantastic and range from an average of $5 to $10 per tapa dish. I ordered the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. Bacon-wrapped dates are one of my favorite tapas, so the almond was definitely a different texture than what I was used to, but still tasty. In addition, I got the veggie empanadas, which were quite savory. I was saddened that there were only two of those on the plate. My table ordered a pitcher of sangria for $28, which was a steal. Firefly* also has some affordable desserts, and so I shared the chocolate tres leches cake with a friend, and was more than happy with its taste and texture--not too sweet, and not too runny.

I am not sure about other nights, but definitely on Fridays, it can be quite loud with the live band, so be prepared to use your outdoor voice inside. The band, Space to Pace, played light salsa music. After seeing one of the waiters dance with a hostess, I really wish I knew how to salsa dance (note to self: take some salsa lessons). I love Latin music, especially the classics like, Oye Como Va and Guantanamera, which they both played, and so it was a treat to be there that night to listen and clap along with the band, as well as enjoy tasty, inexpensive food with great company.

First off, we decided to go on Valentine's Day, after we eloped, so this would be our special wedding dinner....having never been....I solely booked a reservation based on yelp reviews.
The restaurant is beautiful! Black velvet wall paper, red velvet booths, perfect dinner lighting.  Even the staff's uniform is great! Everyone was so professional,  kind and attentive. The perfect spot for a special event! The beautiful manager offered us a complimentary glass of champagne and checked in on us a couple times, she was so nice! We decided to purchase the photos from the young lady taking shots of guests. She did an amazing job!

We got blood orange mojito and sparkling sangria. Both drinks were big, mixed exactly right and it was happy hour! Bonus!!!!

 Our server suggested a tapa item from each section, we decided to get 2 of her 4 suggestions. We also got the special of the night YES! They were so good. Here's what we decided on:
Boquerones, anchovies on toast w/roasted red pepper, vinegar, fresh avocado and greens. Delicious! Everything blended quite well... the acid from the vinegar was a perfect touch.

Bacon wrapped dates.  W/smoked almond and bleu cheese. I could eat a platter of these!! They were addicting! A MUST try

Eggplant cannenoli with goat cheese. Tender, thin sliced eggplant, creamy filling, light tomato sauce. Excellent

 Grilled Octopus with roasted potato and diced pepper relish . I Love this dish. I don't remember the title of it, but it was cooked perfectly. I usually get octopus or squid and this dish was one of my all time favorites. Acidic, sweet, and a textural delight.

Heart of palm ""crab cake"" a vegan choice...very very VERY good. Over baby greens topped w an aoili, these cakes were prepared perfectly, lightly panseared, perfectly moist and very fresh.

Special was...Red Snapper and grilled shrimp over grilled asparagus w pomegranate sauce.
Again, another fantastic dish. It was cooked perfectly, especially the seafood. So tasty! 

We got the dessert platter, had a couple bites and took it togo since we were full. Every item was fresh. Chocolate tres leche was our favorite as well as passionate fruit cheesecake.

The food was pretty good as well. I remember the scallops being delicious. We had sliders included and I only ate half of mine because I don't really like sliders and it tasted like a normal slider you would get at a TGIF. Mussels and the spicy beef salad were very good, I definitely recommend those. We only used the unlimited plate option for a couple items split between 11 girls and by the time our last two plates came we were so full.

The first Firefly we went to many years back was in downtown Vegas.  Although the seating was nothing special, the great view of the old casinos and the light show made for a very cool atmosphere.

The second Firefly we went to was at their PREVIOUS/smaller Paradise location.   That one had some cool seating with couches and what not, giving that a very cool atmosphere as well.

Suffice to say that when we were seated at their CURRENT Paradise location, it was a bit of a letdown.   The atmosphere is completely missing in this larger location of theirs on Paradise.   They tried to give it some atmosphere with the candles and red hue, but the space is just too big and open for sit down tables for that to work well.   

The red pitchers of Sangria are still delicious and well worth the $28.     

The tapas don't seem to stand out to me as they used to; they were all good, but nothing really stuck out as being delicious.

Parking was free and plentiful behind the restaurant, although rush hour traffic made it a bit difficult to get to. We timed our visit to take advantage of the Happy Hour specials and had the inside dining area to ourselves at 5pm on a Wednesday.
 
We started with a beer and a sparkling sangria ($5) which was both strong and sweet! We got several of the $4 tapas specials to sample and share including the wonderful French Fries and some rather standard little Meatballs. The ""must try"" Stuffed Dates were delicious and I am craving that sweet-salty flavor combo now as I type. The blue cheese really makes the dish. The Apple Manchego Salad was light and flavorful and went so well with the other heavier plates.

We saved room for dessert as the Chocolate Tres Leches ($7) stood out to me and the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($7) caught my husband's eye. Both were delicious and he finished the bread pudding, but the Tres Leches cake was definitely meant for a crowd!

A feint shadow of the fabulous potatoes brava at Julian Serrano, which have a gourmet tomato-based sauce and light creamy aioli.

The service was also frustrating. We were in a booth with about eight people. The curtains blocked people on the ends of the table from sight, which meant waiters never bothered to ask us if we wanted anything else. We had to get up from the table and seek out the waiter several times.

The tuna tartar was amazing, incredibly fresh and if it was just me I would have ordered 2 and would be done with my meal. The scallop escargo, which is basically scallops cooked in the escargo style of heavy butter and garlic was also well done buy I wish the scallops were better.

The music was also great but could be turned up a bit to help drone out the other conversations and because it by itself is very nice. 

The best part is that this place isn't too far from the strip, like one mile off las vegas blvd. So it wasn't crowded but still tasted good. We were full but we weren't vegas buffet style full/dying so we could still go get drinks and gamble without the food coma feeling.

Another friend, who was also part of the group that ate with me, came here on her birthday and had nothing but great things to say about this location and she didn't get sick from it then. 

The parking was a bit confusing. Up front they have a valet area and in the back of the restaurant is self park. When entering the lot, there was no indication that the back parking lot is self park. Here is where I got confused--normally the parking in the front is reserved for self park and valet is sectioned off somewhere in the back. So I thought that the back parking was reserved for valet. I decided to valet my car since I couldn't figure out parking and it was just easier for me to drop my car off. When the valet parked my car in front of the restaurant, I thought that was interesting that I valeted my car to have it within walking distance. 

We had reservations already made so we didn't wait at all for our table. Right from the start, our server came by and asked us if we wanted anything to drink and since we were still waiting on one more, we just asked for water for the meantime. We also placed an order of paella since that takes awhile to cook and we thought it wise to get it started. Other dishes ordered were the shrimp ceviche and calamari. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. 

Reasons for the 3 stars:
-parking could be better indicated for first time guests
-the paella said it could serve 2-4 people. This could be true if more tapas are ordered along with it, but we ordered it as if it was the main dish. When I imagine paella, I think of a big serving of it!
-the shrimp in the ceviche were whole. I'm used to ceviche being cut up in smaller pieces and I've had better ceviche at taquerias
-it wasn't as busy as it could be, but we still had to wait around and ask for our check several minutes after they cleared our table

The mixed seafood paella ($26) has lots of chicken (every other bite) and maybe two clams and two small mussels and lots of rice and little other discernible ingredients.

Loud and lively attractive scene. Not a place for quiet conversations.

Probably worth trying once but for us experience was somewhat underwhelming primarily due to the the stingy portion size. You can tell the tapas were light on costly ingredients which took away from the dining experience.",ujTwruINsgwvzW9YgGdx2A,0,0,3,DM6cUI2awU5F3BGayXCXQQ

The 2 stars is for the food ALWAYS being AWSOME at any Firefly location but honestly your palate gets affected when other things affect your mood such as service.

We were greeted promptly ... we ordered some cocktails & one of the guys ordered a bulleit rye on rocks while my man ordered it w/water. They brought both w/ water. Mind that both our boys are bartenders & love their bourbon & know the flavors. BUT we saw the bartender pour just Bulleit Bourbon & not Bulleit rye... also because the bottle was still sitting on the display. The fact is he had the odosity to come & say we ordered wrong & even though it was our fault he would make a new one. We said forget it...it's fine. The boys decided they wanted one more... & again we were watching as the drink was being made.. he poured the regular Bulleit AGAIN!! Brought it over & said it was rye... UGH! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!? 

APPLE & MACHENGO SALAD $3.50 - absolutely refreshing with thin julienne slices of green apple & some cheese w/toasted almonds & lightly dressed.

STUFFED DATES $3.50 - bacon wrapped w/ toasted almond to give a crunch... sprinkled w/ Bleu cheese crumbles & drizzled w/ red wine reduction. A MUST dish whenever you go into firefly!!

We went with a fairly large party of 9 and our waiter advised us to just order a few tapas at a time in rounds. They come out fairly fast so you don't have to be afraid of waiting that long. For the most part, he was correct, except our party was pretty hungry and scarfed up every plate almost immediately after they came to the table.... so if your friends are a pack of ravenous dogs like mine, you can order more at a time. 

We ordered:
Mixed Paella (one order is good for about 4-6 people)- nomskies. Legit Spanish cuisine. 
Ahi tartare + avocado- standard dish you can't really go wrong with 
Bacon wrapped stuffed dates- I don't normally care for dates but this was like CRACK. So good. Nice balance of salty and sweet. It's really small though, like 5 dates on a plate and one date per person is not enough  
Fries- good but also forgettable 
Lamb shank? Thigh? I forget which part but it was good. 2 pieces only. 
Mac and cheese- nomskies in all it's creamy goodness 
Stuffed mushrooms- nomskies,  I'd get it again 
Some kind of stewed veggies + egg- meh I'd pass on that one 

I can't remember what else because it just kept getting passed around the table rather quickly. 
My other advice to you would be GET THE RED WINE SANGRIA. It's a little on the sweeter side but I think everyone can appreciate it, even those who don't care for sweeter tasting wine. 

""Take this all of you and drink it. This is the cup of my blood which will be given onto you and to all so that your sins may be forgiven.""

If Jesus was talking about the Firefly red wine sangria then I'd be downing that all day and all night... like a mofkn sangria vampire or something. 

Okay that's my advice, you heard it, enjoy your time in Vegas!!! :)",b_WfCL7Vulgd0HyUmyMpsQ,2,3,4,GlhWx3dbXb-tP9Eg9kaeaA

Apple & Manchego Salad - Great mixture of crunch and flavor
Baked Goat Cheese - AWESOME and so mild in flavor
Ceviche of Shrimp - So flavorful
Veggies and Lentils  - for lentils that lack flavor this dish was packed with flavor

Tuna Tartare - So fresh and delicious
Manchego Mac 'N' Cheese - WONDERFUL
Petite Filet - one of the best filet's I've had!!! Cooked perfectly!
Chicken Skewers - Flavored so well!

For the remaining flavor senses, manipulate them with a cool selection of tapas.  My faves are as listed:

Mushroom Tart - comfy smells appetizing
Seared Tuna - wonderful highly recommended
Calamari - pretty good nice with the sauce
Grilled Octopus - soft good flavor, missing sticky rice hahaaa (no picture included)

Baked Cod - good flavor but DRY (get it right next time)
Beet Salad - salty... why?!!! (otherwise healthy)

Many other restaurants began offering tapas menus following the late 00's economy crash, but nobody does it as well as Firefly!  They offer something for everyone, whether you're a vegetarian or a carnivore, and the food presentation is interesting and unique.  

Basically, tapas style is like ordering appetizers.  But these aren't anything close to your traditional ""loaded potato skins and chicken fingers"" appetizers!  While Firefly does serve more traditional entrees as well, the tapas is where it's at for the ability to sample multiple items.

Its nice to see spot like Firefly bounce back from the whole Salmonella disaster last year. Yes people got sick from the food here, will it happen again? Nope. In fact they have a food safety consultant and its probably the safest place in town to eat.

I've been slacking on checking out the new location but I finally got to stop by a few days ago. The new location is a building over from their original spot but is probably three times the size. Its a large stand alone building with a big patio, massive bar, and plenty of space for diners and large parties. The new spot captures the look and feel of the original Firefly while expanding a little and establishing itself as its own restaurant. Across from the bar is an open kitchen viewing area/bar which should ease some concerns about food handling and safety.

During our visit the service was spot-on. Our server and bussers were on top of refills and had some great recommendations. Keep in mind that the tapas come out in waves not all at once. The food thankfully (unless you had the limited edition Salmonella flavors) is the same. During this last trip we had the mac n cheese, chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, and chicken skewers. We also had the chicken and mushroom pallela, kind of like a gumbo without the shrimp, this thing can easily feed 3 to 4 people. All of the dishes were as delicious as before and I recommend checking out all of them. I think their raised their prices on the pitchers of mojitos but its still worth it especially if you are stopping by during happy hour.

The atmosphere is swanky and fun. The staff nice and very knowledgable. It was our first time trying a tapas restaurant, the menu is quite extensive giving us many choices. 

We tried the sangria, was excellent. The white was a little too sweet to drink a lot of, but was very good. Most in our party preferred the red. 

We ordered to share as a group, so we made a rule that if someone before you ordered an entree you could not order the same thing. Doing it that way allowed us to try many different things. Fun! 

When the food came we passed it around the table family style. They filled our extensive order accurately and with a great flow, well timed so we were not overwhelmed or ever waiting. 

The prices are affordable, the food is flavorful and varied (everyone can find something that fits their taste), the drinks are yummy and the ambiance is unique and perfect for a group looking to celebrate or an intimate date. 

Don't leave without trying the filet mignon or bacon wrapped dates, they are fantastic.",7cQI-hj4tWa7RNjfC161zg,1,0,5,AxbrMhIh7I4jjYlp4cmYnw

I came to Firefly after work on a Friday to hit up the end of Happy Hour and try some tapas I've heard so many great things about.  The Happy Hour menu only includes drinks, but included beer, wine, and Sangria, most for $5 or less.  The bar area wasn't too crowded for the time and day of the week and had a very low-light, intimate, Spanish-type of setting.  It was a great environment and had a very post-work feeling to the crowd.  This makes sense as the restaurant is ideally located right next to the Corporate sector of Las Vegas.

I began with the Sangria, and it was very good and highly recommended.  I also had a chorizo plate which was quite good but not as authentic as I was expecting.  I saw a bunch of orders around me and they all looked great.

I will be back to come for an actual meal in the very near future.  Most of the food sits at around $7-13 for tapas so it is highly affordable and worth a go if in the area or even for an after work stop.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,Yqm4-1LPohDZyM-huiU6PA

Then waited for awhile before she would come back to get the check.

The other three people I was dining with had to leave so I was now sitting alone and the waitress still did not come to bring my change.  I finally flagged a manager down and asked if I could please get my change because I had been waiting 20 minutes.  No apology, just said the waitress was having issue with another table.

The tapas menu is expansive, with many cold, veggie, and hot options. Very solid drink options and I chose wisely with the red sangria--not too sweet w/excess sugar and fruit--it was a perfect mix, just right. 

My tapas selections were spot on:  Pulpo asado (octo, potato,tomato, paprika-lemon Vinaigrette), the Chicken Tinga Empanada (fried and good), and the Mushroom Tart puff pastry (served warm--herbed cream cheese) in ""gravy"". The pulpo plate had a lovely coordinated flavor and the mush tart was a light, creamy journey to loveliness. 
The tapas and sangria were vehicles to the holy-land:  the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake. Do yourself a solid and share this with a pal or two--they will love you for it   I had the honor of devouring this symphony of flavor all on my own.

The food and drinks were just as good as the old location as was the service. I love that the new location is much bigger and more modern, although I do miss the dark romantic ambiance the old location had, but the bigger the restaurant is that means the less of a wait so I'm happy about that! Also, valet is a HUGE plus as the last location's parking situation was horrible.

The service was horrible. came here for a going away party last week and we were sat in the middle of the room at a long table. My boyfriend and I were a little late so we asked the hostess if she sat any big parties, who ever she was texting on her phone was obviously waaay more important then we were so we found our party ourselves. once at the table it took us 15 minutes to be able to order drinks. I ordered my usual scotch and soda, never being asked what scotch i wanted, but i assumed they would just give me their well scotch. was i wrong about that... but we will go over that once i tell you about our bill.

our drinks finally arrive about 10 minutes later, i ordered water as well so i reminded the server when he dropped off our drinks. Our water never came, even after reminding him a 3rd time.

The food was amazing, as usual. We had the heirloom salad, padron peppers, artichoke toasts, ceviche, ahi poke, and we split the spicy shrimp. (i obviously took a break from veganism for a night) The heirloom salad is freaking amazing, ive never had such a great salad. 

Once getting our bill, we noticed i was charged for Macallan 12. For all my scotch drinkers that are reading this, it is a crime to mix Macallan 12 with soda.. If you cant just drink it straight, just admit to yourself that you are by no means a scotch enthusiast.  And with a price of $14 (i think?) a drink, we werent too thrilled. On top of everything the tip was already included, and we werent told this. So for horrible service we ended up tipping double. 

On our way out the same hostess was still on her phone texting away. If we didnt live in Veer Towers and were so close to this location we would never return. You would figure with all the bad press this restaurant has endured they would step up their customer service.",z8wN6EQuw_JF-zTjcNgsLw,9,5,2,-GmLcdUPIQvMpD8jqyfPjw

I visit Vegas almost as often as I change my undergarments.... seriously! We have been there twice this month and visit Firefly each and every time!!

I am vegetarian, pushing vegan and there are TONS of yummy creative options for me! With a few modifications, there are even MORE options! My boyfriend is a full-fledged carnivore and this is a place that suits us both. 

His favorite: the Rib Eye. My favorites: The empenadas, the artichoke toasts (with or without the aioli!), the green apple salad and the lentils (though they do need a little salsa/sauce). 

We always sit at the bar. 
Service is not the friendliest in the land or the most attentive but it is definitely not bad. Actually, in about the 2 years we have been going there it has improved. But there is still the occasional empty bar and we have to flag down the bartender even though there is no one else around. 

I encourage you... please do NOT go here. It will be too packed and I will be super sad if we cannot find a seat! This is my place, MINE I tell you!",eCBkAuSnFCOPV0augxxl0Q,2,2,5,YlZqP-ZM2HrOtGw6luPugA

Five stars tapas are as follows: stuffed dates (ON POINT - I mean seriously on POINT! ), merguez (couldn't ask for better lamb sausage - savory with right amount of spice), empanada (NOT the the chicken tinga), chicken and chorizo stuffed mushroom,  juevos estrellados (it has really good spice but only order to get full...carbs will help fill you up)

First, let me say that the red sangria is the best I've ever had!!  Truly amazing!  Our party of 3 finished two pitchers (it would have been more had we not been ""forced"" out).

It was SO noisy inside with little acoustic material to absorb sound so we asked to sit on the patio. It was a beautiful fall night!

We had the dates, shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, baby back ribs, skewered meats, and caramel flan.  All the food had a rich flavor, and everything tasted very fresh. The sauce on the ribs was sweet yet savory.

Everything was perfect until the salsa band showed up. Girl #1 started moving tables to make room for dancing by dragging the metal tables across the floor. It was so loud & the pitch was so high that it hurt my ears....like nails on a chalkboard!  Seriously?!?!  There were still 3 tables enjoying their meal!!  Then girl #2 approached each table & basically told us to leave because they were going to play music & dance. WTF?!?!  After telling the server that I was upset, we paid our check.  When we arose from the table, these people had all their band stuff around our table & we couldn't even exit the area!!  SO RUDE!!!!

Had the manager approached us earlier to let us know what was going on, we would have taken our group inside to drink more sangria. But instead the server kept apologizing.  So we just left. 

If I do return to this restaurant, it will be for the food & I will NOT get in the way of the rude conceited self-absorbed salsa people. Just plain ridiculous.",yzkvm97dxCf1Royk0ISh4A,1,0,4,ZpuCBLnl0ayNJoXNP-vMaQ

""Classy but not stuffy"".  ""I want MEAT"".  ""Something off the strip"".  ""$20 entrees, plus drinks.""  ""Dude, we trust you"".  Ok, I got this.

The reviews were, in the words of Vin Scully, ""remarkable"".  Two $$. Good looking pictures (food porn).  Easy to make reservations for a party of eight.  My wife and I were the first to arrive and we had the choice of inside or outside.  The bar area is gorgeous, the inside had cool music and a classy vibe but the patio was perfect for us.  We are a loud group so we wanted to feel more comfortable.  Red and white lights above us on the canvas patio cover.  Very simple, kind of cool.

Service was prompt and efficient.  The tapas were amazing.  Top picks were the hot cheese dishes with chorizo, bacon wrapped dates and tuna tartare.  The highlight was the paella.  We had one with seafood and another with chicken and mushroom.  Killer dishes.  3 pitchers of different sangria so made us all fuzzy and happy.

The desserts were plentiful and the banana Nutella dish was a standout dish.  In truth, I was pretty buzzed to remember too much but all of my friends had a great time.

The only negative note to it is that at the end of the meal the waiter took my husband's glass away before he had actually finished his beer!

Anyway, I'm giving 5 starts also because of the food: it was really tasty, fresh and well prepared and presented. We tried a few tapas - some of them in HH too, GREAT deal! - and the empanadas were probably the best, so give them a try. I enjoyed my red sangria as well.

I read the reviews, saw the pictures, and knew I had to try it.

I did not have a lot of time in Vegas, just going for a trade show, during the week, and only time off for dinner.
First night I attempted to go, place was booked for a private event and wait time was over an hour.  I didn't give up, next day, I went a little earlier and was able to find a spot at the bar.

I was greeted immediately, and given both the happy hour menu and food menu.
I love Tapas style restaurants, gives you an opportunity to try many different things, especially if sharing.  
Since I was traveling solo, I didn't get to order many things but what I did, I absolutely loved.

I started with one of their specialty sangrias, the sparkling one.  Very well balance between the wine and peach flavor, plus all the fruit.  It's a little too sweet for me but very refreshing and I would order it again.  

While enjoying my Sangria, I looked over the food menu and decided on the Mushroom and Steak kabobs, and the Manchego Mac N Cheese.  
They didn't take too long to come out, and they served them almost at the same time so I was able to have them as a meal.  Protein and it's side dish.
The steak, I ordered medium-well, was soft, juicy and very flavorful.  The mushrooms were decent size, and so delicious with the steak.
The Mac N Cheese was crunchy on top, perfect amount of cheese...  maybe if I would have stopped eating this I would have been able to try something else but I just couldn't.  

Before I was able to finish my meal, the sangria was done.  Instead of ordering another one, I saw their other specialty are mojitos...  and, they have a passion fruit one.  I just HAD to order it, and absolutely LOVED it!  The passion fruit flavor (my favorite fruit) really comes through, and it's not drowned in sugar/ simple syrup (like many places do).  I like it's natural tartness, and love when people don't mess with it.  Extra points for that!

The food was amazing, service was friendly & quick, and on top of that, I got to talk with some fun people sitting at the bar near me.  
So glad I went again that night and got to enjoy this place.  Definitely a must and permanently on my list of restaurants to visit in Vegas.",mjOKUSdIqxFPSYMB-MmS9g,16,16,5,v9XbMSh04dg_aw8ZzgHKWg

-Tierra y mar skewers

Come here with a group that's hopefully not too picky, and try as much on the menu as you can until you can't eat anymore. The waiters are very happy to help you through this process and make suggestions for you too.

We had a reservation, but still had to wait for our table in the bar area which is pretty common on a Friday or Saturday night. The bar is big, busy and can get crowded. They have several options when it comes to hot and cold plates to share. We tried and shared several dishes from the menu and most everything was well liked. 

Garlic Bread with Sweet Almond Butter - This was brought at the beginning of the meal and it's oh so addicting! Very very good. 

Ham and Cheese Croquetas ($6) - Serrano ham and manchego cheese. These were tasty! Comes with 3 croquetas. Why oh why couldn't you put 4 on the plate to even things out? Lol. They are a decent size and best eaten right away while hot. 

Roasted Beets and Persimmon Salad ($9) - Star anise, mixed greens, pecan crusted goat cheese, beets, persimmon and balsamic-pear vinaigrette. The greens were a tad too salty on this dish, but everything else was very good. 

Mushroom Tart ($10) - This was a well liked dish at our table and now we know to order more of it next time! It came with 4 puff pastries covered in a delicious mushroom sauce and it also had some cream cheese. Everything melded well together and I wanted to lick the plate. 

Stuffed Dates ($6.50) - You get 5 bacon-wrapped dates each stuffed with a smoked almond in a red wide reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese. This is one of the most popular items on the menu and with good reason. The stuffed dates here are some of the best that I have had and even when I see Firefly at Bite of LV or some other event around town I have to stop by and grab some of their stuffed dates. These tasty gems shouldn't be overlooked when ordering from the menu. 

Baked Goat Cheese ($8) - Goat and garlic cream cheese in a boat of tomato sauce that's drizzled with pesto and served with toast. My hubby really liked this dish while I didn't like it much at all. I personally didn't taste any garlic it was just plain cream cheese. I did enjoy the bread that came with it. 

Stuffed Peppers ($8.50) - 3 good sized Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with fresh mozzarella and garlic cream cheese on a bed of tomato sauce and topped with green onions and crispy onions. This was a very good dish and well liked by others in our group. 

Serrano Sliders ($9) - 2 mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales bleu cheese and a side of crispy onions. These sliders tasted great, but where was the ham? I'm not sure if the ham is mixed with the burger and then cooked or if it's supposed to be slices on the slider, but there was no visible ham or none that could be tasted in the mini patty itself. Still tasty regardless however with serrano  in the name I would expect more of a piggy flavor. 

Someone in our group brought a birthday cake from a local bakery and the restaurant had no problem slicing it up and serving it to us on their dishes after our meal.

I'd been to a couple of Tapas places but looking on the app I've never seen such an extensive menu with so many types of Tapas to choose from such as Chilled, Seafood, and Meat and Poultry. 

The space is pretty amazing with the romantic atmosphere and these awesome images of Flamenco dancers and Spanish art all over the walls. Great for something romantic or friendly or just stooping in for lunch on a day trip to Vegas. I'd love to come check it out on their Latin Night. The bar is a very stylish installation that should be a wonder when the lights are low. 

Have individual captions on the Tapas that we ate. Our favorites were definitely the Bacon wrapped dates that had a nice, rich sauce to go with it, the Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and the Serrano Ham and Machengo Cheese. Each portion is sizeable and great for two people. The Ahi skewer was actually pretty meaty and nicely packed with fruit and a great garnish that completed the dish. I would have loved to try more of what they had on the menu. 

My one complaint might be that during lunch rush our waitress disappeared for a bit but the bus boys and her fellow waiters made sure to help us out as best they could.

Everything here is fantastic... for those not familiar with Tapas (such as my parents)... just think of it as a Spanish version of Dim Sum. 

Ordered the usual:

Stuffed Dates - bacon wrapped... yum!  Some might find the flavor unusual however... each serving comes with 5

Roasted Beet Salad - have had better elsewhere... you can skip this and try something else

BBQ Mango Ribs - my favorite dish... very tangy yet has that mango sweetness... meat falls off the bone... dish comes with 4 good sized ribs

Firefly Fries - truffle fries = king of all fries.  comes with a nice dipping sauce as well

Stuffed Mushrooms - stuffed with some sort of chorizo... fantastic. 4 pieces per order

Seafood Paella - order this right when you sit down because it takes a while to cook... probably could feed 4-6 people... it's great!  It's quite on the peppery/spiced side (not spicy but you can taste a lot of different spices added).  Unfortunately it came last and we were quite full already and couldn't enjoy it.

Even the bread appetizer is delicious... comes with what I think was a jalapeno butter and olives.

I stayed away from it this time... but the Sangria is fantastic.  Especially if you get it during happy hour.... quite the bang for the buck... careful though... that sh*t creeps up on you!

Only reason this doesn't get 5 stars in my book is the music is way too loud and the service is a bit slow.",EhdKnqsqZf07Awj2oWxjZQ,4,3,4,_PMbo8IhRxxoG9KLU1kyew

Their Padron peppers are my favorite menu item and they did not disappoint today! A full plate of peppers flash fried with lemon and sea salt was $5.50 - a really unbeatable price compared to anywhere else. We also had fries with Parmesan seasoning and that's the only plate that at all disappointed me. The serving was very large but the fries were soft and not crispy, even though they were skinny and browned. Lots of yummy shaved cheese though!

Husband enjoys the ham and cheese croquetas ($5) and had a soda also (coke $2.50). I tried a new plate this time and went with the chili, lime garbanzo beans (in the shell!) ($4.50) I didn't even know they came in a shell (but it makes sense) so I asked the server what they're like. He compared them to edamame but these little pods were much more difficult to work the beans out of. I liked them a lot but they were a lot of work for too little reward. 

The new restaurant is wonderful. Much bigger and still a great location. There is parking in the back, but if you miss the driveway on the way in, be sure to not park in the subsequent parking lot, as we were told they are happy to tow you.

It's very dark, romantic (if you want it to be), and hip. They are filled with nicely designed booths for more privacy, and they have a private room which you can reserve for a big party.

I headed to the bar and of course you have to order one of their signature mojitos or sangria (by the glass or pitcher...if i were you I'd order a pitcher) as I wait for the rest of my party. Even if I was already late I was still early than the rest of my group. Anyway, I ordered a glass of the BLOOD ORANGE MOJITO. Then, as our party slowly but surely showed up, we ordered rounds of pitchered mojitos. This included the watermelon and cucumber mojito. 

Here are my mojito highlights:
Glass: $7.50 Pitcher: $30.00

BLOOD ORANGE: Lovely! It has that nice tart taste from the blood orange, and can barely taste the alcoholic kick. So if you want something with a strong cocktaily flavor with less of an alcoholic taste I would recommend.

CUCUMBER: This is pretty good too. Here, you taste more of the alcoholic flavor. It is a lighter mojito flavor wise. So if you're looking for something fun in flavor...probably steer away from here.

WATERMELON: While a pitcher or two of these bad boys may lead you to your own rendition to DRUNK IN LOVE (you can't help it since Queen B does say watermelon), this has a really light refreshing taste with a good mixture of that alcoholic POW. Definitely, one of my faves. In which we did drink the most of. 

Food wise, we ordered a bunch of random plates in which a party of 7 shared. 4 pitchers and a handful of tapas plates later, our tab reached a good $300. So expect to pay a good $60 to $80 PER PERSON especially if it's at a dinner party. 

Other favorite foods I like ordering here:

DATES
CHORIZO SKEWERS
SCALLOP ESCARGOT
STEAK AND MUSHROOM SKEWERS
SHRIMP CEVICHE
MUSHROOM/CHEESE TART (this is really filling with a strong cream taste...which is usually a hit or miss with people so be careful)

Just name drop these choices and you'll sound like a regular here. Other than that, read everyone else's review on the plates.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,0,1,5,JNfMh8lS5a-JHAOOPi9xkA

We knew someone that worked there so we called him and boom got seated right away. From this point on, everything was great! Our server was very attentive and always checking on our table. When our food came out, it was phenomenal. I got the steak and mushroom skewers, and my two friends got the filet minon, and the lamb, we like meat! Lol all three was soooooo good! We also ordered a pitcher of Passion Fruit Mojito, and it was very good and refreshing!!!! 

All in all, great food, great servers, great ambiance BUT HORRIBLE HOSTESSES. I think hostesses are a big part of a restaurant operation, they are the first impression of the restaurant, and with those girls there that night, Oh NO, seemed like they were just there chit chatting and checking out guys, not doing their job.

The menu is tapas style, which is basically my favorite thing in the entire world.  I mean, you can get so many different flavors and varieties (each at around $6 or something) all while appreciating the ambiance and fun atmosphere!

Our table ordered the big bowl salad to start, followed by the stuffed dates (AMAZING! GET THESE!!!), spicy beef salad, manchego mac 'n' cheese, ahi tuna skewer, camarones a la diabla, sliders, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, merguez, firefly fries, and we all shared the seafood paella.  Everything....EVERYTHING....was wonderful! 

This sounds like a lot of food, but keep in mind that it is tapas style.. Between 7 girls, it came out to be like 2-4 bites per dish!  They were perfect for sharing!  Also, our server was spectacular and everything was served relatively quickly, given the restaurant was packed!

Atmosphere: Typical tapas place.  Not a complaint at all, but don't expect anything above and beyond in terms of atmosphere.  It looked like a nice date spot. In fact we sat next to a couple on a birthday date and honestly it looked perfect. They even had a private photographer who came around and took photos.

Food: I feel like we ordered a ton of stuff, ironically my favorite dishes were the roasted vegetables and the grilled peppers (not sure what they are actually called). I've been back for over a week and I'm still thinking about those peppers, they were the perfect blend of sweet (not spicy peppers) and salty.

My other favorite dish was the scallop ""escargots"".  I must admit, they did a fantastic job with this dish.  The presentation and flavor was spot on.  Firefly escalated a scallop dish in an inventive way that I have never seen before, and I always appreciate that.

The other thing I did not like was the serrano ham sliders. The filet mignon patty was definitely not filet mignon, I can taste the difference, also there were pieces of bones AND chewy tendons in the patty that I had to spit out. Yuck! Also, I was informed by our waiter that the serrano ham was grounded into the patty, which I couldn't taste at all, probably due to the tiny amount of ham that was put in.

Service was friendly, but not that attentive. We often had to ask for water refills and our server disappeared many times throughout the meal. Needless to say, we all enjoyed ourselves. Food was delicious, and we ordered a ton of different dishes so we could try them all. I do have to say though that about half of our party had stomach issues a few hours later, which I'm chocking up to just eating too many different things. The food was pretty rich too.

Bacon-wrapped stuffed dates: i hate dates, but these were SUPER tasty. Only got about 5 of them per order though

Scallops: I'm also usually not a fan of scallops, but these were cooked perfectly and the polenta underneath complemented the seafood well.

Mussels: Tasty! Good. Not delicious, but not bad.

Chopped chicken salad: Tasty! Good. Not delicious, but not bad :D

Baked tetilla: basically cheese fondue. I looove me some cheese and some fondue, but the cheese had a weird rubbery consistency after a bit

Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms: LOVE! So good. Mmmm

Petite filet: It was kinda rubbery meat. The steak was a disappointment

Meatballs: These were pretty good, I'd order them again

Paella: A couple of the girls in our party had been to Spain before, and they said the paella here was better. Delish!!

For all the food we ordered (we ordered multiples of the above dishes + a few I forgot to mention), dinner only came out to about $30/girl. Awesome!!

The menu has a huge selection of tapas, broken down by hot, chilled, meat & poultry, and seafood. Their eclectic food choices are matched by their drinks menu with numerous types of cocktails, beers, wines, and sangria. 

With a large group, we were able to try a bunch of their most popular tapas. My favorites included the ahi tuna skewer with mustard-ginger glaze, the ham and cheese croquetas, and the manchego mac 'n cheese. The firefly fish sticks were a bit over-fried. For dessert, we tasted the banana-nutella sandwiches and the trio of gelatos. Nothing special that couldn't be store-bought and made at home.

3915572,2014-07-06,2,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"I have nothing positive to say about my experience at Firefly on Paradise.  The service was the most awful thing ever.  I was in management for a Forbes rated the hotel for a long time, and I would be seriously embarrassed if my team ever acted like this team.

We were sat at a table outside, and then we were left for 20 minutes before anyone checked in on us. During this time, all the tables around us were being serviced. I watched the waiter check in with several tables. 25 minutes into this experience the busser brought waters, and the waiter came over. He didn't say Hello, he said what do you want to drink. I was expecting some type of reason why he was ignorning us. The paito wasn't that full.  He took the order and left.  During this time the manager was walking around the patio area.

I also watched the manager of Firefly mingle with what appeared to his friends and several other tables except ours. During this time, the manager made eye contact with me four times (I was giving the look of hey how's it going can you please assist me), but he failed to do anything.  He started to walk our direction, and I was about to speak up to him, but he turned his focus to a table full of young women. The service should be the focus, I can understand if you are speaking with your guests, but this was not the case.  He continued to check in on what appeared to be his friends and tables full of young women. Each time he did this he was chatting it up for several minutes.

We were still waiting for our drinks at this point about 35 minutes into our experience. At this point, we had to walk up to the bar to get our drinks because no one returned with them.  The manager also was at the bar during this interaction and failed to say anything. We mentioned our experience to the bartender and the manager could have said something, but he didn't. 

Overall, the waiter seemed mad he had to work, and the only person who was doing anything positive was the busser.  We asked our busser at one point to get send over the waiter so we could order another round.  The busser walked over to the waiter, and the waiter disappeared for several minutes before coming to our table. 

During this time, the waiter made eye contact with our table, and then walked away. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I then watched him walk inside and stand by a curtain. He wasn't doing anything for a good five minutes, and then he finally came back out, went to another table and walked away.  I had to wave him over, which I hate doing, because it is rude, however, there was no other way to get his attention.  

Eventually, our food came out, and the waiter continued to be short with us.  The food was good, but the service at this place was awful. I think the thing that rubbed me the worst about this place was that the manager failed to step in and show any interest in our situation. He seemed consumed with talking to women rather than doing his job.  This was my perception last night.

I hope everyone else doesn't experience this while you are at this establishment. Maybe it was an off night, either way, the service was horrible.  The only reason we didn't leave was because our friend loves Firefly and it was her birthday.  

I also witnessed several staff members on their phones, I can't believe this place...get your standards in with the rest of this city!",2SdgwxMf1ePB_l687yuyCg,7,1,1,JYJ50ueNeU8ahmE_qzQKpA

The sparkling sangria is perfect. I love sangria and this one is sweet and bubbly, great on hot Vegas days! Get a pitcher and enjoy your surroundings, plus it will get you feelin' good as your delicious tapas come out. 

The must-haves:

Bacon Wrapped Dates-everyone likes these. EVERYONE. I don't like bleu cheese and the little pieces in this make the dish stand out! GET THEM. 

Anchovy toast things-Boquerones? I probably just butchered that. Anyways. THIS IS MY FAV!! I know I know, anchovy whaaaaat!!!? But for real get it. White anchovy on toast points with avocado, roasted red peppers and a lemony sauce....it is SO GOOD. I didn't want it, my date insisted, and it's now my favorite dish. A balance of seafood saltiness and creamy avocado...omg yum. 

Manchego Mac N Cheese- I'm a lover of all things cheese and this is great, baked on top which just enhances the texture. 

Stuffed Peppers- cheesy, creamy, and fried onions for crunch. Love this. 


Nutella Banana Sandwich Dessert. Explained itself.

Sorry Firefly.. Your service was good since it was a late lunch, and it wasn't crowded, but your food has changed and not how we remembered it. We each ordered 2 dishes (total 12) plus a paella. Every thing was mediocre except for the scallop with butter and garlic sauce, the mussels, and the salads.. But other dishes either were too sweet (the ribs, shrimps, octopus), and the paella was not even close to be ok. It wasn't your thing. It has too much tomato sauce which causes the dish too wet, and the mussels, clams, shrimp were too dried. Hmm.. Not sure if we would come back here again for the good old time..

Firefly serves the purpose if you're looking for an alternative away from the strip and want a casual bite to eat. There are PLENTY of options on the menu to keep everyone happy!  

On our plate - 
* Veggie Empanada - crisp, flaky and flavorful.
* Warm Spinach Salad - with artichoke, red pepper, pine nuts, feta and a dash of lemon. The slightly warmed up spinach gave the salad a nice body and the addition of pine nuts added a great crunch. 
* Baked Goat Cheese - can't really go wrong with baked cheese! Ever. This was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth delicious.
* Shrimp in lemon garlic butter sauce - the sauce was good, but the shrimp did not absorb any of it and seemed to be tossed in it a few minutes right before serving.
* Grilled octopus - very disappointing, the octopus was chewy and didn't taste fresh at all...the sauce lacked seasoning as well.

5. Steak and Mushroom skewers. I wish I knew what kind of sauce they use for this cause it's fabulous! 
6. Ham and Cheese Croquetas - manchego cheese again! Yum! Some thought it was a bit salty; but I love salt! LOL.
7. Baked Cheese; whoa! Didn't think I'd like it, but I loved it!
8. Firefly fries; great combo with the Sangria; carbo load while drinking! Plus their fried to perfection and has a great seasoning!
9. Paella! Whoa! We got the seafood one and it was a great ending to the rest of our tapas! It was able to give a sampling to 7 people and everyone loved it!

3. There were no tables inside, but the outdoor sitting area had fire pillars to keep you warm (see picture)

4. The bathrooms were clean and had around 5 stalls so there was no line for women (always a plus)

Cons:
1. Our entree came out before a lot of our tapas which was weird for me

One thing that struck me is how big Firefly is. It's a huge establishment which is nice. I feel the new location is much bigger than the old place. This is a definite plus.

Drinks. I did not order a fruity drink (like sangria or mojito) but I saw people order them. The mojitos are drowning in mint. Barely any drink in there. That was a downside. The beers on tap though are actually pretty good. You would think they would only specialize in mixed drinks, but they had some nice Belgian Tripels on tap that really packed a punch.

Food. The bacon wrapped stuffed dates are what you get. Get a couple of orders. Quite possibly the best item on the menu. Fried Calamari was okay, they give you a bunch. Bit chewier than I wanted it but it was still good. Empanadas were okay, nothing special. Tierra y mar skewers were very delicious. This is the one with filet mignon on a skewer along with some other tasty morsels. For dessert, the flan was fantastic. 

Service. Just like many other restaurants, there seems to be a communication issue with servers. You'll have a server take your order (dates), then they'll disappear. Another server will come and take someone else's order. That person's order will come out before yours. You'll see another server, ask about your order as another server is walking aimlessly around asking every table if they ordered dates. This just happens so often with every order. Luckily, all my food arrived without much trouble but I can only imagine that other people's meals aren't so lucky. The positive is that every server was very nice and was trying very hard. 

Overall, I like the new location better. It's bigger, better atmosphere and the food didn't make me sick.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,1,1,4,24BH14xqhoR7qEH4X419tg

Highlights we're the bacon wrapped dates, firefly sticks and ahi Tatar.  We weren't crazy about the stuffed peppers (cheese was just too heavy, thick and flavorless).  Also disappointing was the Tres Leches desert.  Too dense compared to others we've had in the past.

Next, the food. The food presentation is great as is the ambiance, but most of what we got was jusy OK. Based on the price point and parking experience I probably would not be back. Yardbird was better. 

*BACON WRAPPED DATES: sweet and savory bites of heaven. A MUST TRY. 

*STUFFED PEPPERS: good flavor just a bit much on the cream cheese. 

*FIREFLY FRIES: you can get these fries at McDonald's and sprinkle Parmesan on it. The Parmesan melted together and was difficult to distribute for taste. 

*FIREFLY BURGER : we asked for medium, but it was pretty much med rare. Nothing special just your average burger. 

 *PAELLA, as others have mentioned - order first as it takes like 30 to 40 min. It was good, but unfortunately we were pretty much full when it arrived at our table.",JFRRsy8gy__2sIeSW4Hoxw,5,0,3,9VfwqpSLqZYoiiVuW9wdpg

We started off with the apple manchego salad. AMAZING. Who would've thought sliced apples and manchego cheese together would make such an appetizing dish?! This is a must order for me every time I'm here. Definitely shareable too!

We sat at the bar, to which our bartender was very knowledgeable on the menu and suggested many items to fit our taste buds/diet. 
We then ordered their shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, and scallops ""escargot"" from his many, delicious sounding, suggestions. 

Their shrimp ceviche makes my mouth water just thinking about it. SO FLAVORFUL! Its a little on the citrusy side, but I loved it that way. They came with crackers so balance out the lemon. *droool*

The tuna tartare came with taro chips, which by the way, are my faavorite, so it instantly got a lot of lovinnnn from me. But the tuna tartare alone was delicious. It's basically ahi tuna and avocado, and their seasonings, sprinkled with love. 

And lastly, the scallops escargot was very delightful! Herby, buttery, breaded goodness with a nice lilll scallop in the middle. 


Those four were about 50 dollars, give or take. I absolutely love tapas for the fact being you can try many different options on the menu without breaking the bank. And with that, I absolutely love this place! The portion sizes, yeah they're still small plated, but I feel like they still give you a good amount! We're small girls tho, so that was enough to fill us up without feeling too full

Also, side note, on another occasion, I had their stuffed dates and those are just as bomb as everything else :) try everything! Or atleast what I've mentioned.",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,2,4,5,cItwB53IybPmxqYSyRqD4Q

Food is pretty good
Large selection
Lots of vegetarian and vegan items
Moderate pricing

Cons:
Loud, definitely have to increase your voice level to talk to the person across the table from you
Some dishes could be executed better 

I came here with my friend on a Thursday night and we were seated within five minutes though the place is filled and booming. One of the most immediate things we noticed was the volume of the setting. We chose four tapas plates, albondigas, empanadas, scallops escargot, and heart of palm ""crab cakes."" 

The albondigas which are a type of meatball in a tomato sauce with cheese were delicious and warm. 

The empanadas, which was really just one cut in half was good, but maybe a little heavy. I understand that it is an empanada, but I've had empanadas that are lighter and airier. The pulled pork with the cream cheese and the aioli on top was a little much. 

The scallops ""escargots"" were good, they came in a pesto like sauce with a lemon to squeeze over. They were good, the flavor was spot on but... I wish they were seared more for a crisp outside, they didn't have much of a crust at all, so I was slightly disappointed. 

The palm of hearts crab cakes was vegan, really just a mix of vegetables seasoned with old bay and served with a mustard aioli which was quite citrusy. These were good, but not necessarily crabby except for the old bay and the shape of them. However, they were still tasty. 

Overall, I'd return, but I'd likely try some of their other dishes, which isn't a problem because they have a huge variety. Our bill was $36 for four plates.",X9tp6NSl9ts-30PU0faLjw,0,0,4,wUqniS_GImROpqJRf17ArA

I can't honestly say I remember all of the plates since we were randomly picking off the menu. I can say though, as each one came, they got better and better.

1) The customer service was great! I made reservations for 13 about a week in advance since my company had a conference out here in LV; and they were able to accommodate it easily. With a large group, and a loud/happy group of people, all our servers were FAST, answered all our questions, and made sure we were well taken-cared of (probably b/c they knew they'd get a great tip). Food came out super-quick and their water / beverage replenishment was on point!

- We were also celebrating one of our co-worker's bdays and they were able to keep the cake in the back and bring it out to surprise her after dinner!

2) The Food: again, WOW. I haven't been to a spanish tapas restaurant in awhile, and this made me just want to go everyday! The food was fantastic. With such a large group, we were able to order a good variety from the menu, and honestly, everything was great!

- Just to name a few favorites: Tuna tartare, ceviche, bacon wrapped dates
- We also had the seafood paella which was very delicious BUT there were parts of it that was way too fishy - which made me worry & wonder if they washed the seafood since I haven't tasted anything so....""seafoody"" (& I'm not even that picky and eat lots of seafood). BUT again, since the service and EVERYTHING else was so great, I couldn't knock off a point for this but thought it was still important to mention.

3) The Sangria: Saving the best for last - oh. my. SO GREAT. The end.

Overall, awesome experience. Thanks to the employees that waited on us! They were so fast and ensured our drinks/water was always replenished! I will be taking my fiance here when we return to Vegas next month!",BzHyGKnVoy8bs_hY1pbx-A,0,0,5,pnclHRpAlncP6D6GsvuNQA

Most recently, however, was the crown jewel: my brother, his best friend, his bf's wife, and I, truly enjoying ourselves. Yes I have had better sangria, but FF's version is delicious, refreshing, and compliments the food well nonetheless. I cannot live without their mussels with chorizo, bacon wrapped dates, and camarones a la diabla. Our service has always been outstanding -- a couple of visits were a tiny bit more frustrating than others because we had to flag down servers, but those incidents were few and far between -- and we always leave feeling really satisfied as far as value is concerned.

So what prompted me to write this? Man, haters gonna hate. I suppose that's the beauty of Yelp, and America in general I guess. But seriously? I find it highly ironic that there is a petition circulating to shut down all Firefly branches. ABSURDITY. I'm no math teacher or anything*, but Firefly's aggregate rating goes into the 4 star range, which for hundreds of reviews is pretty impressive. I've delved deeper into this situation and found that many have claimed that Firefly's owners refuse to adhere to any standards of cleanliness or sanitation, and Firefly's owners responded by hiring a consultant specializing in health safety. I don't know who to believe -- the strange minority stepping in because they know so damned much, or the overwhelming majority of people who are pleased with Firefly and believe it to be a true Vegas gem.

I adore you, Firefly, and so does EVERY person I send over. Don't ever go away!

I have to think the alcohol is definitely factoring in to what a great experience I had, but honestly the food was great and our servers (we had two) were AMAZING!! I would go back just for the service alone as they were attentive and went above and beyond to keep our party of 9 happy.  

Food - like I said it was all you could eat tapas and desserts for us, and a table of 9 girls, yep we pretty much had it all.... and managed to hand the plates around as if they were big enough to be family style.   I loved the bacon wrapped dates, the octopus, the apple salad, the tuna tartare, the empanadas, and the dessert platter.
You can probably skip the mussels, the chick peas in shells (these were actually good, but not worth the mess or effort to eat), the shrimp diabla, and the steak skewers....  trust me we ate many more than this, but these stick out as the best and the worst.

Drinks - the mojitos were ok, not as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was all you could drink and really I wasn't complaining. The sangria was strong, maybe too strong, and then others in our group ordered wine and beer.  

Service - again, sooooo good!! Our waitress took the time to get the bachelorette a candle and sing a made up bachelorette song to her as though it was her birthday... she didn't think the bachelorette looked happy enough so she kept going above and beyond with little details to make our night that much better.

Firefly is a nice place off the strip with a nice menu. We've done Jaleo in our hometown (it's a go to) so we venture away from the Vegas locations to try Firefly. The white sangria stood out as the best thing we ordered. With four of us we order 10 plates and they were all good - nothing to really complain about - but nothing that stood out. Nice staff. The mark down is for the roaming photographer who's running some sort of ""you're on the rollercoaster at DisneyWorld and want to buy pictures."" She took a few and then came back to pass along a 'free' photo and offerings to sell. I don't need someone selling me photos at dinner - it's cheap and...cheap. And, vaguely unprofessional for a restaurant. If the manager reads this, knock it off. It's awful.

4211618,2017-06-20,55,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Finally a place I can order several plates and not be judged..... 

I like tapas restaurants because you get a little bit of everything and you don't need to order five huge meals to get it. The idea of tapas is to get people at your table to share so you get to experience several dishes and that's exactly what we did.

They started us off with their sweet almond butter and bread. This was complimentary and the only problem was I couldn't stop eating it. The sweet almond butter was addicting! I think I filled up on bread. 

We also ordered off the tapas menus:

-The Apple and Manchego salad: Green apple, Manchego cheese, smoked almonds, and light dressing. The salad was light and refreshing if you want a healthier choice. It was good but nothing memorable.

-Veggie Empanadas: Spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese in a pastry with red pepper aioli. They were served hot and crispy. 

-Firefly Fries: Parmesan, herbs, and aioli.  I'm not a fry person but I do prefer thin fries when I eat them. These actually were my least favorite. 

-Baked goat cheese: Goat and garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce, pesto, and toast. This was the groups favorite dish. I thought it was great for cheese lovers! So cheesy and delicious! 

-Mushroom Tart: puffed pastry, herbed cream cheese and mushroom sauce. This was my favorite. It was rich but also had enough carbs to make me happy! 

I also tried The New Girl drink which was house infused Vodka, cranberry, hint of Jalapeño and mint. Delicious! I loved it! 

All these tapas dishes were pretty big. They probably run on the bigger side of most tapa plates.

My friends ordered two main dishes:

 -Firefly burger with truffle fries 
 -Clams 

Neither of these interested me but everyone seemed to love their food, they all were very happy. It was very busy on this Friday night so it's probably a good idea to make reservations. We came in with no reservation and waited about 30 minutes.

This place was very busy and the atmosphere was fun. There were lots of people at the bar, loud music, and I even saw people dancing. No frowning allowed in here!",59GSwMflQFllOAWvw0F5mw,70,68,4,ZcqDYCnxIkCI3QADsX6feA

Best thing I had was the bacon wrapped dates. Also it was enjoyable watching the two couples at the table in front of going to the bathroom every ten seconds... ya know... for stuff.

The rest of the food here was adequate and not worth the price. And as many reviews say... it is extremely loud! Once again due to all the alcohol consumption. It is also very dark... great place to take an ugly date.

The service is great, and I don't really know what else to say about it. Great ambiance minus all the noise. Our reservation was for ten but they let us in at 930 because there was no one in line. A lot of people have said to get a reservation which I suggest... BUT if you want to go earlier you might be able to sneak in... to the bathroom and do blow.

THE VERDICT: Go?! I can only suggest this place who have money to burn. Which i do i burn 1 dollar bills for heat. There is such a VAST variety in vegas (how bout that alliteration?) that if you are there for a weekend you should definitely go to other places, because there are a lot of delish places. oh and to the prostitutes at the table in front of us... make the powder breaks a little less noticeable.",Yxj8O3t-szlSK6zGETYUSQ,0,0,3,dH1MJnlKsr0clCjRXd9Z2Q

The sangria was AMAZING! I had two glass. So good. It was not too strong yet not too light. However, my girlfriend got tipsy drinking it. Funny. It's really good though. Definitely recommend others to get it.

With all the negative publicity that this restaurant has received it's time to put them back in the good light.  

I was recently here for a team meeting, and I have to say that I was very impressed. This new location is AWESOME, valet parking in the front and ample parking in the back.  Hostess booth as you walk-in just like the old location but the update in the new location is now there is a WAITING AREA.  Helloooooooo, no longer do I have to wait outside, in addition to the waiting area the new bar area is big enough to sit and have a drink and not be elbowed by other patrons.  

RESTROOMS - clean, clean, clean! and more than 2 stalls (sorry just keeping it REAL)

DINING ROOM - OMG, amazing you can actually walk through the restaurant w/o saying the following: 
- ""oh, I'm sorry""

- ""excuse me, can you scoot your chair in please""

- ""it's hot in here, is the AC on"" , etc

Big parties can be seated and accommodated comfortable.  Firefly now has a extra room for private parties, that sits off tot he side of the dining area.

BAR - The bar is SUPER, more than 5ppl can sit at the bar now.  If you and friends want to chill at the bar and sit together, you can.  Open bar area, it sits kind of in the middle of the restaurant.

PATIO - couches outside, more of a lounge area now.



FOOD - 

- STUFFED DATES: yummy! yes indeed, dates stuffed w/ blue cheese wrapped in crispy bacon. (I don't even liked blue cheese, but i KILLED those stuffed dates)

- MANCHEGO MAC&CHEESE: when you can see the grease of the cheese along the rim of the dish, know that you're in for a culinary delight.  bubbly cheesy goodness, mac&cheese comes out w/ that crunchy cheese top. you know how you throw food in the oven set on broiler to make it extra crunchy...YEP, and that's what come to you table. mmm, mmm, good

- ALBONDIGAS: juicy moist meatballs w/ melted parmesan cheese sitting in a bath of tasty tomato sauce.  NO really, the sauce is on point, I wanted to take the bowl and slurp but I didn't want to look like a fat a$$.

- VEGGIE EMPANADAS: crispy flaky dough, you hear that slight CRUNCH when you bite into the empanada.  the veggies are not all mushy or hard for that fact.  its a nice balance, it comes drizzled with some kind of sauce that matched very well

- STEAK&MUSHROOMS SKEWERS: um YEA! medium rare, i don't what type of steak but it was tasty.  it reminded me of filet mignon, it was so tender, when I pinched the steak to pull of the skewer it just slide right off.  If you are a mushroom person, then this dish will make you very happy.  They do not skimp of size or flavor

- BEEF SLIDERS: DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no extras needed, don't ask for for any ranch, no ketchup, no mustard, no NOTHING. EAT AS IS, beef is seasoned perfectly, cooked medium rare, you take a bite and your teeth just sink into the beef.  OH MY GOSH, i'm getting hot over here..oh i forgot I'm still writing a review

GO TO FIREFLY'S you will not get SICK, I PROMISE.  They have cleaned house in there, I did not see any of the OLD employees there.  I was a regular at the old paradise location, I was familiar w/ all the workers at the old location.  The NEW paradise location is NEW all the way around.  The food is still GREAT 

NOW, the reason why I did rate 5STARS is because of this one problem:
With a new spacious restaurant and bigger restrooms there is still NO TOILET PAPER in the bathroom.  If you're a girl, go to the bathroom with a friend just in case you walk into the stall and it is out of paper.  ""hey girl, can you hand me some rough ass paper towels please""  I'm just saying.....

I've tried multiple items with everything always being so tasty, however I do remember last year when I came I tried the veggie paella and it was not delicious. But again, paella is supposed to have seafood and meat, so that was a lack of judgment on my vegetarian friend who ordered it. So I forgive Firefly for that one and blame my friend. Ok back to last week. I ordered the clams, and it was so tasty my mouth is watering just thinking of it. Steamed to perfection and soaked in a broth with chorizo. Simply amazing. Roasted veggies were also amazing, as well as the pasta bowls. Our table ordered 3 of them and everyone who tasted it was in awe. However, it's alot of pasta; I don't think we even finished 1/2 of each one of the orders. All in all, you can't order wrong here ( Unless you get the veggie paella) and the sangria is one of the best I've ever tasted.

All of the tapas that we got were tasty, but the real highlight was the stuffed dates. I don't like dates, but they were decorated with so many other things that it didn't even matter anymore. The dates were wrapped with bacon and topped with blue cheese with a sprinkling of some red wine and smoked almond somewhere in there. It was an explosion with every bite.

We also ordered a pitcher of sangria because it's a tapas bar, who doesn't? I didn't take it too well though. Ended up with a bad headache. It was probably too sugary for my brain.

Sounds like this place can get packed on the weekend, but we went during off-peak hours and it was pretty empty. Parking wasn't an issue either with plenty of space behind the restaurant.

4261835,2015-03-12,3,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"This place has a serious obsession with mint. 

I came here with a large group to celebrate a friend's birthday. Many people in the group ordered mojitos. I was not on that list but just from observation,  I was blown away at the amount of mint that was in these drinks. From what I understand, all you need is a little bit of mint to be muddled to release the mint flavor. My dining companions could not even finish their drinks at times because there was so much mint gumming up their straws. It was practically coming up the sides of the glass and people were pulling out leaves and putting it on their plates. So please, Firefly, pull back the heavy hand for mint in your mojitos. 

Here are some of the dishes I tried and my thoughts:

Bacon wrapped dates-Were really good but super rich. 
Empanada-Meh. Nothing that impressive about it. I can see why they drizzled it with a ton of aioli--they were trying to give it some extra flavor. I believe that a condiment should be served on the side and compliment a dish, rather than make it the only way it has any dimension. I say this because I scraped the aioli off and it was just bland and then soggy in the parts were the aioli sat on the crispy empanada shell. 
Tierra y mar skewers-grilled shrimp is the first thing on the description and there were only 2 shrimps to be found on the entire thing). The filet mignon chunks were quite heavenly. 
Caramel flan-a standard flan that was served with an almond ""cookie"" which looked like a cannoli shell. When I scooped up the fruit compote garnish with the cookie and ate it with the flan...I enjoyed that combo together. And of course there were a few mint leaves as a garnish!

I was a tad bummed because although they have Delirium Tremens beer on the menu, it was not on tap when I got there. The waitress did express some concern that it was on the online menu (which is were I had seen it). BUt I was still happy with the beers I ordered in its place. I don't care that they are known for Sangria. I had Sangria the day before at a baby shower. I was over having just some fruity wine. So beer was poison of choice that night. 

Service from our main waitress was really good. She was very fast and informative and kept all of the separate checks straight and there was not a large group gratuity charge! 

The other servers really missed the mark with getting waters refilled or handing out food. When  some plates came out, they would go to the edge of our table and say ""tomato soup? who ordered the tomato soup?"" and this happened every single time. This became grating  because they said it barely above a whisper and they just stood there repeating it until someone realized it. The table was so large that it was very easy for someone that was deep in a conversation several feet away to miss the call for their food. I don't know if there is a way to improve upon that strategy. 

Overall, I had a fun time with the people that were there and I enjoy the tapas style of eating. But, the dishes did not really impress me enough to give this place a 4 or 5 star review.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,2,2,3,J4l6w2AnwnJt9gEF05Q3CA

4318402,2014-09-03,4,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"After hearing about Firefly on Paradise for years, I was happy with my first visit and can't wait to return. As the other reviews have stated, this is an excellent spot for group outings as well as intimate dates. While my wife and I enjoyed our meal, I'd suggest going with a group so everybody has a chance to try a wide variety of tapas.

My wife and I decided on an early dinner on a Sunday night and booked our reservation through Open Table on Yelp, which was easy and convenient. We arrived and were seated immediately. It was still early for Vegas, so the restaurant was not fully buzzing yet. 

Our server Nahum greeted us and he was terrific throughout the dinner, as were the additional servers who promptly removed empty plates and refilled our drinks. Nahum explained some of Firefly's dishes and offered a few recommendations. We went with a few of the more popular items and since we'd had our share of meat during lunch that day, we went with dishes that were not meat-centric.

The tapas we tried:

The stuffed dates were outstanding and lived up to the hype. I was a bit weary at first, thinking that the bacon wrapping would overwhelm the date, but it was used more for its smoky qualities and the almond center was a nice way tie in all of the flavors. Highly recommended.

The fresh garbanzos were a nice snack seasoned with lime, chili, and sea salt. It was the first time I'd had them served in their shell; it was similar to munching on edamame, but with more flavor. 

The Firefly Fries were shoestring potatoes topped with parmesan and herbs and served with aioli. I didn't think they were anything extraordinary, but my wife really enjoyed the comfort food quality they brought to our meal. 

We both enjoyed the manchego mac and cheese, which was made with baby shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni and topped with a tomato-pepper relish. It was rich, creamy, and mellow.

The camarones a la diabla were more sweet than spicy, with the shrimp cooked perfectly and served in the sauce along with small pieces of grilled bread.

Surprisingly, the tapas filled us up more than we thought they would, so we intend to return to sample the other dishes as well as their popular sangria. We did, however, leave room for dessert and devoured the chocolate tres leches cake. It was a perfect ending to our dinner.

Note: it's unfortunate there's no sort of dress code at Firefly. It's a nice restaurant, but when diners show up looking like they just returned from their hotel's swimming pool, it ruins the atmosphere. I'm reserving my fifth star for a future visit.",sCMoMzlOS5q0dfXJVCY2sQ,5,3,4,UG_Z9oI5TPWgpoQkNSybMQ

I purchased this Groupon for use on a Friday night while visiting Las Vegas.  I called first, because I read the restriction about only being able to use from 5:00 - 6:30 for dinner, and reservations being required.  The person I spoke with was really short with me, didn't really understand my question about ""having a groupon and needing a reservation during that window, etc."".  She told me to just come right over, because they weren't busy and there was no wait.  When we got there, approximately an hour later, it was 6:15.  I know this, because we had told friends we would meet them there at 6:00 and I was upset with my husband because we were 15 mins late.  By the time we got sat and had ordered our drinks, it was probably 6:30.  We had a party of 8, and spent almost $300 and 1.5 hours there.  When I presented the Groupon, the waiter told me it was only valid from 5:00 to 6:30.  I explained that I had read the fine print, had called for a reservation, was told it was unnecessary, and was still seated by 6:30, regardless.  He persisted in saying that he understood, but still couldn't honor it, but i was welcomed to use it on a different night.  When I explained that we were in from out of town and had purchased it specifically to use that evening and asked him if he could let me talk with a manager, he said he would certainly check with the manager and explain my dilemma.  He came back a couple minutes later and told me that ""the manager was sorry, but they couldn't accept it, and since I was from out of town, I was welcomed to call Groupon and request a refund"".  Really?  I'm not a cheap skate.  In fact, I'm the opposite.  The measly Groupon amounted to a $17 discount on a $240 check, upon which I left a $50 tip.  I really don't care about the $17 but I do feel a little scammed for being lured into their business, bringing 7 other people with me (2 of which live in Las Vegas) only to be treated like dirt.  Worse than that, I hate that the employees at Firefly, clearly don't understand that the value in advertising is in bringing new customers into your business and keeping them coming back, not to bait and switch them, thus ensuring they will never visit again.  And, sadly, had the manager come over and spoken to me, I could have shared this feedback with him, rather than airing my grudge on Yelp.  Fail, Firefly.

HERE'S A TIP: If your wait is long to get seated, go to the bar, order a pitcher of Sangria and put in your order for a paella because that will take 40 minutes to cook and by the time you get seated you can have the paella delivered to your table. By the way, the Sangria will change your life. 

       Let's start with the house bread which is garlic and the butter that accompanies it is this sweet, herby mix with I don't know what, but it tasted AMAZING! The staff saw that our group enjoyed this and brought extra bread out without us having to ask. We ordered the mac and cheese which was delicious and used the pasta shells instead of the elbow macaroni. Definitely home made and not out of a box, creamy and delicious.The goat cheese dish was good and had a sort of marinara base. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but it went well with the base. The mixed paella was out of this world! I need more paella in my life after eating the mixed paella which consisted of pieces of chicken, shrimp and clams and just a great flavorful bed of rice.  I'm still heart broken that we didn't take the leftover mixed paella (there was at least a cup of paella left) to go because my friend said she didn't want her car to smell (we were headed to XS at Encore after dinner and it would've sat in the car for like 3 hours).
It was my friend's birthday, and they brought us flan for her at no additonal charge and put a candle in it. Luckily she hates flan so I got to eat most of it and yeah, I'd lie and say it's my birthday anytime I visit here to get free flan.
 
          Everyone from the hostess at the front to the bartender and wait staff outside were courteous, beautiful and attentive. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely eating here and trying even more tapas and taking the leftover paella to-go and eating it on the way home.",QwZaQ_G_AYArFE9G9oMPMQ,6,4,5,Vt4K9L6iGZ0CFyWouP-Acw

4359057,2015-04-07,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"So many options, but there was only so much room in my stomach to try them all. Had the tuna tartare, stuffed dates, steamed mussels, & the lam chops aka $40. Not too shabby on the pricing. 

Before I get into the ""imo"" of the food, I have to recommend the sangria ($13/pitcher). Probably the best sangria I've had so far. Sangrias tend to either have too much alcohol or just be too fruity, & I don't know how they make it here, but man oh man the balance was just perfecto. 

Okay, back to the food. The tuna tartare was okay. My favorite about this plate was the taro chips. Those are some tasty chips. But, I have had better tuna tartare. I am not a dates fan. And although this taste wasn't particularly for me, everyone who enjoys dates in my group loved them. But if you don't like the texture of dates--yeaaaah, don't try this one. The lam chops were okay in my opinion. I've had better lam chops as well. Not sure if it was the texture, the taste, or just both but the sautéed lentils & julienne vegetables were just not doing it for me. The star of all these plates were the mussels. Be warned, this is not a tapas plate. They are very generous in portions with their mussels, but it is nothing to complain about. The sauce just had my taste buds exploding with flavor. This is a must-have for mussel lovers. 

I would compare Firefly to Cheesecake Factory, but a more elevated version. I would've been happy with just the mussels & the sangria all night long. For a group of 17, I did expect a bit of better service, but I guess we can't have it all now can we?

We tried it again thinking it was a fluke and it was still terrible.

This has allowed them to go back to doing what they did so well before. Although I wish they would bring out the bread, olives and honey almond butter like they used to. Now you have to ask for it. They have some new things on the menu now too like the Chicago beef sandwiches. Their flavors on that one are spot on. (I'm from Chicago, I can say that). The dates are to die for and 

The things have have changed for the not so good are the mushroom tarts, filet sliders (now it's much cheaper meat) and ham and cheese croquets. Those are so bad that the inside is ground down to the consistency of baby food.

Go with a group and order a paella or two (recommend the mixed paella with all the seafood, chicken and chorizo in it for $30ish it is a great deal because it can serve up to 4 people) to start to share as a table (they take 40ish minutes to make, so order it first thing) and then have everyone pick out a plate or two to start with and enjoy! The sangria is pretty good, not the best, but an awesome value at $33/pitcher. Another favorite appetizer of mine is the petite filet, they cook the steak perfectly and the accompaniments and sauce is tasty!

Give firefly a try for your next get together or celebration.",A-iq0FLoFkuZ-ZG2P9LlXA,0,0,5,1yFaQ4OhFZPj1img1M2iQg

Keep in mind that everything is served tapa style. We also ordered the Red Sangria which was delicious! We got a pitcher of the Sangria at happy hour which ends at 6pm.

Anyway, the tapas, the drinks, and the dessert are all fabulous.

I've been here several times, with pretty good experiences, however this time I ordered take out, and was severely disappointed. To start the food was not ready 20 minutes later when I went to pick it up, the teenaged receptionist seemed out of touch and ambivalent about my order, another inquiry 10 minutes later, and I get ""it will be up soon, just waiting for the steak"". Another 5 minutes and I ask for the manager seeing it's now been over 35 minutes, and they could have started cooking the food when I arrived and it should be ready by now. Another 10 minutes no manager, but the food comes out and seems to be hot. Get home, food is not to order, despite all the time wasted.

While this used to be a go to place, it seems understaffed, management does not care (half full restaurant btw), and service level sucks (did not even order the paella, which takes 30 minutes). I'm done with this place and would not recommend it (despite previous reviews).

The food were delicious but the service was not great. The lady that served us brought us the wrong order, twice. When we told her we didn't order the first one, she gave us an attitude and insisted that we did order it. We originally ordered stuffed mushrooms but changed our order to mushroom tart when she told us that the dish I wanted on the picture was actually the mushroom tart- not the stuffed mushrooms. We ended up with two mushroom dishes. The stuffed mushroom was mediocre but the mushroom tart was superb! I didn't want to make a big deal out of it (although my boyfriend was a little frustrated.) 

Later on, she gave us the wrong order... again. We ordered baked tetilla and got something completely different (I don't remember the name). We couldn't  eat because it was too spicy and frankly, it didn't taste good. My boyfriend was very upset. We ended up paying for food we didn't want and can't even eat because our waitress was not paying attention. She should start writing down the orders and repeating them back to customers to avoid messing up orders in the future. She caused us money that we did not want to spend. 

The garlic bread was chewy, but everything else was great! The baked scallops were delicious. The petite filet was juicy and cooked perfectly (medium rare.) The red sangria and the pina colada were both awsome!

4484147,2014-10-02,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"The value for the price we paid was great.  The food is good, maybe slightly above average.  

We ordered calamari, eggplant roll ups, mac and cheese, scallops, ham croquetas, salad.  

The calamari was good, not greasy, rings and tentacles..sauce was served.  The salad was good, but as I write this, I can't remember what was in it so it was not memorable.  But I do remember that I loved the salad dressing (vinaigrette of some sort).  My husband liked the croquetas, but croquetas are not my favorite thing, I'm not fond of the gooey center.  

The scallops had some sort of burnt taste to them.  Kind of reminded me of burnt garlic.  They were cooked well, but ruined by that burnt garlic taste.  Maybe something stuck to the grill and then stuck to the scallops.  I find that inexcusable.  

Eggplant roll ups were quite tasty, I wish the portion was larger, or we ordered another plate.  Eggplant with goat cheese, and very little tomato sauce.  Over all good.

The mac and cheese was made with manchego cheese.  I think manchego is best eaten on its own, or with fruit.  I didn't like the mac and cheese, but I think that's my personal taste and not the dish served here.  I like mac and cheese more traditional and creamy.  Again, just an opinion, not a knock against the restaurant.  

I'd go back to try other dishes, but I think I'm spoiled with previous experiences at other, authentic Spanish Tapas Restaurants.  For example, Emilio's in Hillside, IL.",m6HaiTWI-OcfD9z0WdoPqA,1,1,3,XgyDiXlDgmkZ5X2A6thlbw

I came here with my husband and 5 friends, this place is great for a group, because you can try many of there tapas this way. The bacon wrapped dates were my husband's favorite, and the group as a whole. I really loved the apple manchego salad, it was surprising how much I enjoyed it. It was so fresh, crisp, and nutty. I will definitely get it next time. The filet was delicious, I thought the Mac n cheese was just ok. The mushroom pastries were lightly crispy, but the saucy mushrooms on top we're just ok. Calamari good, stuffed peppers yummy. Padron peppers that were flash fried were a table favorite, I thought they were good but I might have enjoyed them more with more lemon. Was impressed with the stuffed mushrooms which was disappointing. The heirloom tomato salad wasn't very good. The butter lettuce, vinagrette, and tomatoes were yummy, but the creamy cheese they slathered on top was just too much. It overwhelmed the dish and ruined it for me. All in all I'm extremely excited to go back. I will definitely be getting Sangria (get the pitcher), filet, apple salad, dates, and stuffed red peppers again. Hopefully I'll leave some room to try some new things and dessert! 
I took away a star because our waitress was kind of snobby, and seemed to be in a ""wish I was anywhere but here"" kind of mood. I'm assuming because we were in a group, they automatically added gratuity, and I don't think she was very deserving of it.

Dark curd, nothing to show a curb there, poor lighting, an overall reflection of a management/owner not really caring about the safety of its customers, a common thread for these owners.

Didn't say anything, didn't offer any help, management has no idea, a total lack of caring otherwise there would be plenty of lighting and a well marked curb just like the north side of the building, well lit with a bright yellow curb.

I have to say I've only ever been to this location and not any of the others in the past, but I've never had any type of problems. This most recent time I came with my boyfriend and parents for an early Father's Day celebration. The location parking kinda sucks which is my only reason for a 4 star rather than 5 since it's so hard to find a spot when it's busy.

This time we ordered quite a few different things. My favorites were the steak and mushroom skewers, stuffed peppers and stuffed mushrooms. Their bacon wrapped dates are also very good. Don't let the word tapas fool you as some of these plates are pretty large portions.

I also have to recommend the red sangria, so good! They don't skimp on the liquor either.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,3,1,4,YQsgAUAl7DbdhwAvZWggJg

Honestly (surprisingly enough) the food was hands down the saving grace of this place. The stuffed dates were insanely good and everything from fries to steaks was well cooked, expertly seasoned and of decent portion size. 

However, and i wish i knew his name (a big muscular guy, maybe late 20s), the bartender was so incredibly rude--and openly so!-- that instead of moving on to entrees like we wanted to, we cashed out and left. 

I wont go into the drawn out details of it all, but trust me when i say i was shocked how clear he made it to us that our business was neither wanted nor appreciated. Its not like the bar or well was even busy. If it was negligence due to that, i could have understood...

Well, we liked the food so much though that we decided to give it a second chance a couple weeks later. But, when we walked in and saw the same bartender with his signature eye roll and snarky comment as our only greeting, we quickly regretted it and left. 

So then, it really is a shame, because the food is killer. If you decide to go, i recommend getting a table and bypassing the bar. We wont be back though.",uUO65LtFuUbpBALUh0-7Jw,2,1,2,nRPTPlnUIIYtTo7Xtow6FQ

Huge restaurant and very lively. Crowded on a Friday night.

Service was friendly.

Artichoke Toast - $7 - Artichoke was tender and seasoned well. 

Stuffed Dates - $6.50 - Salty bacon and sweet date. Reduction makes it really sweet.

Pulpo Asado - $10 - Octopus was grilled perfectly and really tender. Too much potato mixed in, made it hard to find the octopus. 

Camarones Al Ajillo - $11 - Shrimp were plump and tasty. The lemon garlic sauce resembled something you would find in an asian restaurant. 

Steak and Mushroom Skewers - $11 - The filet was so tender and flavorful. Mushrooms were placed evenly with the steak so each bite was perfect. The garlic butter and parmesan enhanced the steak but did not overpower it. My favorite dish we tried. 

Babyback Ribs - $12 - Ribs were fall off the bone. The mango sauce was good but there was to much and made the ribs so saucy and sweet and hid the pork flavor. 

Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - $7 - Chocolatey and moist cake.

Red Sangria - $8
Blueberry Mojito - $8
The signature drinks they have here. Good but to sweet for me.",d8KR5c1ievS0C53h4fhEeQ,1,1,4,FqvyEGW9MSX3HFu3f0EQHQ

4586920,2018-03-10,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Vacationing in Las Vegas was wonderful especially because we found this great Tapas restaurant. We were a table of 4 and got a seat right away since we got there at 6:30pm on a Saturday. Expect a wait if you go after 6:30pm, but it's worth the wait to get a drink and relax while you wait. We started with a pitcher of Red Sangria, which was able to serve each of us a glass and a half (we ordered a pitcher of White Sangria after that was gone). I'm not sure which I liked better. Both were delicious and the red was a little dryer which was nice since we had it with dinner and it complimented the food nicely. 

We had a friend with us that is allergic to shellfish and made sure we told our server before hand that way the server can tell him if he ordered anything for himself that had shellfish in it and he wasn't aware. 

The dates wrapped in bacon were one of my favorites as well as the tuna tar tar. Yummy! The flavors were like fireworks on my palate exploding with flavor and making me want more. The dishes came out quickly and even after ordering so much our final bill was not as high as we all thought it would be. 4 people ordering dishes like crazy with 2 pitchers of margarita's around $200. 

In my opinion the food was better than our favorite Tapas restaurant in Boston, MA and the prices were a lot better as well. Service was great and ambiance was perfect. With it being so big I thought it would get loud, but you don't notice it when you have good food, pitchers of sangria and wonderful company. Yum!",Q41Q24UCFsNAS8gZdFnVUg,1,1,5,TMn_c345Y47VT1IvCnml1w

I enjoyed the flamenco paintings on the wall and the atmosphere afforded by pleasant waiters reminding me of southern Spain.  The tapas make me happy. The only thing I would add is some more architecture...as it is, the place is a bit too much of a strip mall in a desert city in the U.S.A..  It needs a bit more stone work, a tighter decor that makes you feel like you are in a tiny alley in a historic town in Andalucia.  Oh well, it's Las Vegas.  Go for the prices and you won't be disappointed by the food.  

I guess the ""firefly"" lived up to it's name: the place needs to add some fly catchers on the front patio.

Another recommendation to improve this place would be a better beer list.  More microbrews from the United States would be a good addition to the Spanish wine drinks.",TBtktdbIByfM2IpquoT5Gw,1,1,4,4MS364We3JYzSfow0V6UAg

We chose  to sit outside since it was pretty nice outside considering Vegas never has nice weather lol ((I hate the weather here.)) Outside seating area has fans and light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. 

They start off with bread and almond butter. My expectations were high since all the reviews raved about it, but the bread was pretty hard and didn't taste fresh and the almond butter was a bit too sweet.
 
We ordered firefly fries, calamari, mac n cheese, and the ribs.

When they brought the fries out, my eyes lit up and I swear my pupils turned into hearts. The portions are so big and they put the perfect amount of Parmesan cheese (some places are so stingy with that lol), luvvvvvv fries!!!!!!!!!! You can never have too much fries. If you think otherwise, we can't be friends. Ever.

The mac n cheese was really good at first, very unique flavor. The tomatoes on top make it even more flavorful. However, halfway through I had to stop eating it because it was way too cheesy. It's either that or I was a little tipsy off my red sangria (which is yummy, btw!) 

Calamari, yum! So crispy and well portioned out.

The ribs....... R.I.P to those. They were devoured in about 5 minutes.

I hope to try everything, but there are so many choices!  And of course you have to get your favorites, too.

My go to favorites are the empanadas, baked goat cheese, chorizo clams, to name a few.  I'd probably list all the stuff I've tried, if I could.  But yes, I still have to try all.  Go with a few friends and have each person pick a couple so you can taste a variety.  I mean, hopefully, everyone would pick different items!  And the best thing to drink is the sangria.  Tapas and sangria are so awesome together.  The sangria tastes great and isn't watered down or bitter.  Trust me on this even if you don't care for wine, get the sangria!

Normally it's just a couple of us, so we've never had to wait for a table.  I know if you have a large group, you should make reservations.  There is ample parking and the service is awesome.  Kind of random though, when a person just drops food and takes off.  They normally tell you what it is.  But with me, I normally forget what I've ordered and I'll sit there wondering, did I get this?  But usually it is something I've ordered.  Rarely do I get someone else's order.

My friends and I have been a regular before it was ""popular"" and hyped up, and we've always loved the menu items, all the way down to asking for extra bread and that yummy butter! 

Our regular orders would usually consist of the chicken salad (TO DIE FORRRR!!), petit filet, firefly fries, empanadas and the kabobs among other things. I am absolutely in love with the chicken salad and I wish I could make it at home, but ehh. Price is okay, but I wouldn't go regularly--only on special occasions or when the gang gets together for a dinner date. Their dessert items are also very good.  I have never, ever been disappointed by their food! Also, the white sangria is yummy but I gotta say that their pitcher of Strawberry mojito beats the sangria hands down.

TAPAS are amazing. Our group ordered several small plates to try it all out! Our dishes included machego Mac n cheese, stuffed peppers, Apple & machego salad, firefly fries, camarones a la Diabla, etc. 

I don't eat bacon, but many others have loved the bacon wrapped dates (I wanna say it's called chorizo or something). 

It was all so good my mouth continues to water. The apple and machego salad was different; definitely worth trying! The camarones a la Diabla were fancy, loved the sauce/dressing. I could go on and on about the stuffed peppers and the garlic cream cheese that was stuffed inside...but even then no justice would be served. 

For dessert, us 4 girls ordered the dessert platter and that was more than enough to try their best sweet items. Flan was definitely the best!

It was a blatant disregard for the public's health and safety. It stung more because I was very adamant about forgiveness and continued to patronize their restaurants after the salmonella incident. I've never had a food poisoning issue, but now it felt like a gamble to dine with them. I've made a choice to not support a business that has repeated offenses of this nature (regardless of what they claim is not their fault) based on principle.

My recent visit was prompted by the celebration of a good friend's graduation. We joined her and her family on their vacation to Las Vegas (I had forewarned them about the events). In any case, our dining experience was mostly pleasant and I was admitedly excited to eat some of my favorite dishes again. 

The hostess was kind enough to accomodate our large group in one of their semi-private dining booths/tables with drapes (although these proved difficult for the servers and bussers since they had to constantly move them to reach the table). Everyone was really friendly, but service was just okay. Several times we were searching for our server or anyone to come to our aid or just replenish water.

The food was still as delicious as I remember. My favorites being the Stuffed Dates, Firefly Fries, Paella (mixed), and Pork Empanada. The only disappointment was the Tuna Tartare, which was also an old favorite. But overall, I enjoyed my meal. Also, I really liked the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake.

So, the food is still good and service is okay. Doesn't change how I feel about the business and their owners. Dine at your own risk.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,9,5,3,uuM8MTlhqechs2CgFZcSNg

I know this place catches a lot of crap for it's mistakes in the past BUT Firefly is actually one of the better restaurants in Las Vegas these days (in my book). 

I love the atmosphere and energy at Firefly; the service is always great and the food comes out quick. I take newbies to Firefly all the time and it really is because the food is so creative, flavorful, and impressive. 
I have a ton of favs at Firefly that I typically order but am never disappointed when trying something new (lots of options on the menu). 

*Things to note
-Infused potato vodka with lychees and berries..YUM. 
-Pitchers of Sangria are perfect for a group. 
-Manchango & apple salad- looks plain but full of flavor. 
-Any of the empanadas are delightful. 
-Salmon bagels are excellent 
-All the skewers are tasty, especially the shrimp and ahi. 
-Tomato basil soup with the little sandwich is great comfort food
-BACON WRAPPED DATES are a must-do. 
-Flour-less chocolate cake 
 And I have yet to try stuff off the brunch menu but will sooner than later (especially the lemon blueberry pancakes).  
-Unlimited mimosas and bloody's on Sunday for $20",P7Qt34VblZupUifRJ_5hbA,3,2,5,xS72pfHNqeSMPG5v81iYyg

4731165,2015-02-15,0,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"It seems to be that everywhere you go, tapas is the hot new topic. Small plates are awesome. You can have as many plates as you want, and variety makes us all happy. You don't have to order 1 dish and be stuck with it. If you order one wrong dish, you at least have 3 other ones that are good. Tapas is shareable, and at one sitting, you can easily have tried 10 different dishes. For those saving money or not too hungry, its a good way to save money and just get snacking items. It doesn't seem like tapas is going away anytime soon. Firefly in Las Vegas, not too far from the strip. They have some of the best tapas in Vegas, and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Stumbling upon this spot, I could only wishttp://www.dinedelish.com/wp-admin/edit.phph it were on the strip, inside the comforts of a resort.

Their stuffed dates were on point. Wrapped in bacon, the salty and the sweet was working perfectly together. Also stuffed with smoked almonds, it gave it a nice nutty flavor as well as a good crunch. A sprinkle of blue cheese made everything round out nicely. When you are talking about tapas, stuffed dates is automatically in the conversation. The ones at Firefly were nothing short or spectacular. The red wine reduction was a nice touch to the stuffed dates. This is a must order when you are at Firefly.

The filet minon sliders were surprisingly tasty. Topped with blue cheese and fried onion straws, the sliders were rich. The fried onions gave it a good crunch, and the cheese is what gave it a nice flavor. If the cheese didn't do it in the flavor department, their south western style sauce topped it all off. With filet minon being the patty, you know it was going to be soft and juicy. The patty had a nice crust on the outside, and the inside was juicy and not dry at all. This was a perfect little slider combination.

My favorite was the tierra y mar skewers. Skewers with grilled shrimp, filet minon, and chorizo sausage was a perfect trifecta of flavors and textures. Drizzled with a nice salsa verde on top, each bite was perfectly different on its own. The filet minon was uber tender and though it didn't have a lot of fat, it contained so much flavor. The shrimp was grilled to a nice crisp and was a match made in heaven when eaten with the chorizo. Everything seemed to work together in this -- as if the shrimp had the beef's back, and the chorizo had the shrimp's back. Obviously, pork chorizo sausage can hold its own. This is a must order. Maybe a double up would help so that you can have your own plate.

Firefly was awesome. Despite not being on the strip, it isn't that bad. Basically a block behind the strip, it isn't too far off. The food is done right and the tapas allowed me to snack on the cheap. Yes. All that was a snack, not lunch. All kidding aside, Firefly is the place to be if you want small plates. I went during the day so it was quite mellow. I'm sure it gets somewhat rowdy at night as it turns into a lounge after hours. Either way, you will get your tapas the most delicious way possible.",m33gSTi0Fyo3W2Qw6WVdtA,0,0,4,iFALISYYB7r2IK4KAatqfw

Along with many of the other places, Firefly is bomb.com!  Definitely a place you can come with a party...to party.  With awesome food, service and ambiance, a good time is to be had!

No matter how many people you come with, you can expect them to enjoy their experience.  Don't worry about ordering, everyone can order something different and pass the plates around.  A favorite of mine is patatas bravas, veggie empanada, firefly fries, and mac n cheese.  That mac n cheese I won't share.  Get your own, you won't regret it. Along with the food, the drinks are tasty too.  Can't go wrong with sangria.  Red sangria is really good.  If you plan to have more than 1 drink, order a pitcher.

Service here, I hate to say, could be better.  My friends and I were seated right away, but service after that was slowww. And we were sitting at the bar, where someone is always there.  We ordered through someone other than our waiter, because he was a lil too busy.  But other than that, I enjoyed myself.

Fridays at 10:30pm is Latin night.  Salsa! So much fun.  I love watching the really experienced dancers.  The fluidity of their movements is amazing.  Some of them incorporating flips and special turns in their routines.  And they all switch partners.  Don't be surprised if someone come to you while your dancing.",2MtL65B0hy5L41TFBRIdYg,1,0,5,1MqR9OCJ6bpC-RkG-TPx_A

They have a great mojito and a even better happy hour M-F 3-6. Unfortunately the happy hour is only for drinks. I also enjoyed one of my favorite craft beers rouge hazelnut its only 3$ during happy hour.

We brought a few friends along and stayed for several drinks and hours. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. The standouts wrrr the majitos we had both a pitcher and a few extra glasses. It is a little better in a glass the flavors are better proportioned. The sliders and dates were my two favorite dishes.

So when I was planning my high school's 20th reunion, I immediately thought of Firefly, a hip, super fun place to have a great dinner and hang out with friends.

From the initial email I sent Regina with Banquets to payment at the event, the whole deal went without a glitch.  Communication with Regina was a breeze and she answered all of my emails quickly.  Our group was small (under 50) and from out of town so naturally many of them were skeptical with the salmonella incidence and health inspection violations and closures at their other locations.  But I kept close communication with Regina and paid attention to the REPUTABLE recent reviews of Firefly on Yelp.  

The affordable all you can eat banquet menu included their starter, a choice of 6 tapas, and ""chocolate"" tres leches cake for only $30 per person.  Out of their extensive selection, I chose the most popular based on yelp reviews:  artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, baby back ribs, patatas bravas, steak skewers, and camarones a la diable.  We decided on a cash bar that they set up in our private room and we added on unlimited soft drinks for $2.50 per person.  The room charge was $200 with a minimum $1000 food and beverage.  

Our room was set up with one row of tables which initially seemed a little crowded, but turned out fine.  Our crowd mingled for about 20 minutes before I asked when the food would be served and they told me as soon as we were seated.  We sat down and like magic, the food was ushered in by the trays.  As expected the dates were a favorite, but people seemed to love the artichoke toasts, ribs and shrimp as well.  

They are located minutes from the strip and parking in their lot was plentiful.  Our group had a great time and having it at Firefly was awesome.  Highly recommend Firefly for your banquet.  Excellent service from start to finish.",Ksk4gixS8T9N_M16AlblHA,7,2,5,406J6k8Wf-KorRGaE7PG7g

The Garbanzo Beans with spices and the shells still on them confused me, I wasn't sure how to eat this....chew and spit out the shell?  We did order a spicy shrimp dish that was the most simple of all the dishes and yet the best it had nice flavor combinations.  The Red Bell pepper dish that was stuffed with Manchego cheese was tasty but I think just going the chille Relleno route would have made this dish better it was too tart with the bell pepper.  Than there was the Clams in a tasty broth with chunks of sausage in it, that was really good just a tab bit too much sausage flavor as it took away from the clams having any flavor at all.   We also ordered a Safron type of rice that was wayyyyyy to overpowering that flavor was stuck in my mouth all night.  I'm thinking we ordered wrong and there was possibly way better dishes on the menu than what we choose.

I have tried most of their small plates but I think my favorite would have to be the dates! They taste almost like candy! They are a must try when you visit!

I also really like the eggplant with goat cheese. I mean, who doesn't like goat cheese?! It tastes like heaven.

The fries are always a good option especially with a larger party. 

The escargot scallops are also divine. It's not actually escargot just cooked in an escargot tray. It's made with lemon butter and garlic sauce. Need I say anything more?

The dessert platter is also a must try. So many desserts on one tray-trust me you'll love it! The dolce de leche cake is out of this world!",eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,2,2,5,o67VYHQD4BTvWx0fPzYfKQ

The ambiance is really lovely as well. You wouldn't be out of place dressed up or down (as with most LV places). Prices are very reasonable. I think each individual plate is good for two people to share and feel satisfied with the amount tasted. If you have three or more, you might want to order doubles of some plates to make sure everyone gets a decent amount.

And the service is friendly and very prompt, maybe even too prompt; if you want your dinner paced, you will have to do it yourself (see hint below).

But in every other respect, Firefly excels.

Every item on the menu that we tried was very good to excellent.  No misses at all, and some were really outstanding, most notably the baked goat cheese and (believe it or not) the Chicago beef bocadillos.  The San Gria was above average too.

The menu is large and has a wide variety of selections.  You will want to order 20 or so, but two per person is enough for an average appetite.

The prices are quite reasonable, with a typical plate being well under $10.

Go hungry.  

HINTS:
1.  Reservations are really necessary.
2.  From the time you order to the time you get your food will vary from a few minutes to about ten.  Each plate will be brought separately, so you really need to share.  
3.  To pace your meal, order one or two dishes, sit around eating and talking, and when you are ready, order a couple more.  They are fine with you doing this.",moj7DUHkP4j9yfwFm-oOHQ,6,3,5,IfbGtGuVjcEC9dhaBeXn-A

As for what to order...I always get a pitcher of red sangria, to share of course. They start you off with complimentary bread and sweet almond butter, which surpasses any other buttery spread I've had. Most of the menu is tapas style which makes the meal even more enjoyable because it is possible to have a little taste of everything if you want. My absolute favorite dishes are the artichoke toasts and the vegan ""crab cakes."" YES, they are VEGAN FRIENDLY here! Lately, I've been getting their veggie paella. It's delicious, huge, and contains the most perfectly cooked artichokes within it. Back when I did eat meat, their stuffed dates, sliders, and fish sticks were my top picks.

While they have moved on to bigger and better digs, this didn't change their attention to detail when it comes to food or service. My only problem was that I came alone and since it is a tapas place I wasn't able to sample as many items as I wish I could.

The best part of my meal is the garlic bread and sweet butter.  That was good!

Each dish was tapas sized and looked pretty but it didn't taste that great to me at all. 

The Mac and cheese was not bad. Very creamy rather than cheesy actually, but it wasn't special or great. The beef skewers were wayyyyy saucy. The whole plate was covered in 3 types of sauce. Although presented nicely as the sauce made pretty patterns, the skewers weren't that flavorful and the beef was chewy!  The egg thing was a super disappointment. It had the same roasted red pepper garnish as the Mac and cheese and beef skewers ( how lame.. Same garnish for all your dishes?) with a piece of potato inside?  It was very flavorless. The stuffed mushrooms were ok. I've had better. The mushrooms were good.. the chicken paste they stuffed it with was kind of weird.

BUT, the food was AMAZING. Huge selection of delectable tapas. The croquettes were delicious and everyone's favorite. The stuffed dates were little flavor bombs. The clams with chorizo were amazing. We asked for more bread THREE TIMES to sop up the sauce and never got it. Eggplant around goat cheese was delish. Chicken tinca empanadas were good.

This trip was special as we drove over for wife's birthday. We come to LV every month and eat here every time. It was @ 10:00 pm and we were seated next to 2 tables of 2. Our server a Ukrainian girl came over after say ""15 minutes"" and took our drink order. Never told us her name, failed to describe sangria, left to get drinks. About that time both couples on each side told us here is where the fun starts. Twenty minutes later she returned with one of the two drinks. She said I'll be right back. I said wait we want to order!  She took our order and again split. Now 40 minutes into this celebration she returns with the drink. I asked how do we get bread ?  One of the bus boys brings out ""cold hard bread"". What seamed like days, our food comes out and she drops and tried to split. I ask her if we could have warm bread. She can only give us what is ready in the kitchen. I explained we have dined here at least 35 times and have never been told that. A busboy returned with warm bread. She never came back to see if everything was ok, if we wanted to order anything else, or need another drink. We had dessert and left thinking do we ever want to return again! Walked into dark scary parking lot in back to find our six week old car smashed in the back and broken tail light. Go ahead hide us in the back so no one can see us.

AMBIANCE: 4 - I'm not gonna deny that this is a really nice venue. It is dimly lit with very organized tables inside. Also, they let you sit wherever you want to. With the dim lights, and sitting with my best friend ""alone"" in the lounge--it was pretty romantic haha! The whole place is very lounge-like, and actually pretty comfortable. 

SERVICE: 3 - As with many places, the service was pretty good in the beginning, and got slower and worse towards the end! Most of the food came out fast, but some of them came out an hour later than the rest! 

FOOD: 3 - I don't have any food that I really want to shine a light on. None of it really popped out at me or was really amazing that it was worth mentioning. Probably the best part of the meal was my strawberry mojito, which was pretty well done! 

I'm going to say this as a generalization, because this happened with all the dishes we ordered. The food taste was average to above average. But, with every dish there was major problems such as really dry meat, it sometimes tasted off or not right, or the cheese that they used wasn't as luxurious tasting compared to the rest of the dish. 

In conclusion, it was good, but it wasn't great. 

Lastly, I don't wanna be one of those people, but I think I should mention this anyway..My friend and I both got stomach aches not long after we ate. I had never eaten there since 2010 or 2011 and my friend had never eaten at Firefly previously.

My favorites include:
Apple and manchego salad
Tuna Tartare
Stuffed Dates
Scallop / Excargots
Petite Filet
Last time we visited we ventured out of the comfort zone and ordered some plates for the very first time. My new favorite is actually the Herb-roasted chicken. It is so juicy and flavorful. So many restaurants miss on chicken but this just hit the spot. It also comes with delicious crispy fries and it is very filling.

I was dreaming of their Paella since ordering in on my birthday in May and I ordered it again this time but something went terribly wrong. It was super salty and I could taste the rice distinctively as though it was not flavored well. I advised the waiter who alerted the chef. The manager was very kind. He came to our table and apologized and took the Paella off our bill. We would have loved to order one more but we had already waited 40 minutes for this one to cook and had a place to go after so we decided to pass. I love how they handled the situation. We are still loyal and will be back in the future for sure!

We also ordered their sangria pitcher and that was wonderful. It is very smooth and fruity, I think it is perfect for a light weight but only if you are sharing ;)

Portions are a steal with prices ranging with smaller tapas $4 to hearty paellas $20. And believe me, you'll want to share that paella!! It's a lively place that I always think of going with a large group. But I must note, this new bar is large and the separation from the restaurant makes it comfortable to kick back with their sangria on your own as well.

The staff is friendly and attentive. The bartender is knowledgeable & smiles. And now this new space is bright, clean and inviting. I'm glad to see them bouncing back from the bad press they received from the shutdown.

Love that they have a full size bar now with plenty of seating. Food was as good as always... I have a very hard time not ordering the Serrano Sliders every time I go to Firefly. It's pretty sad actually.

I love tapas so I was excited to give this place a try! I will say that half the tapas we ordered were pretty good and the other half just didn't do it for me.

Here is what we ordered:

Chicken Skewers $8.50 - These were served cold and the meat was dry. I did like the garlic cream sauce so that saved this tapa even though I was disappointed with the cold meat.

Shrimp Ceviche $9.50 - The presentation wasn't all that but the taste was fresh, lemony, and delicious. I was surprised since it didn't look like it would have much flavor (see pic)

Tierra y Mar Skewers $11 - Thank you for serving up a nice piece of tender filet mignon as it should be. The shrimp and chorizo added a nice flavor to this skewer along with the salsa verde.

Apple & Manchego salad $6.50 - I love manchego cheese and apples but this salad definitely lacked flavor, nothing too special about. It was missing something but if you like manchego and apples that's exactly what this tapa is about. 

Albondigas $7 - If you like Chef Boyardee then you will like these meatballs because that's exactly what they taste like. I wasn't too fond of the flavor and it was a disappointment.

They do serve complimentary garlic bread with a sweet almond butter. This was definitely addicting stuff! It was sooooo good we ordered another round.

My girlfriend ordered the Sangria and had to send it back because it was overly sweet. Our waiter was very kind about replacing her drink. So just FYI the sangria is pretty sweet!

I made a reservation for 8 people and when we got there, we were seated right away. Although, I would have preferred to be seated in the main dinning room, we were sat in the room adjacent to the bar. Our server greeted us right away and offered up his suggestions on drinks. We opted for the pitcher of Watermelon Mojitos. It was so refreshing and tasted great!

We knew that we wanted to try the Mixed Paella so we put in an order right away since it takes about 40 min to make. 

Here's a breakdown of what our table ordered:

Mixed Paella

Chorizo Plate

Serrano Ham & Manchego Cheese

Stuffed Dates

Camarones a la Diabla

Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms

Babyback Ribs 

Chicken Tinga Empanandas

Stuffed Peppers

Tierra y Mar Skewers

Everything tasted amazing but my top 3 favorite dishes of the night hands down had to be the Stuffed Dates, Mixed Paella & Camarones a la Diabla! The stuffed dates were so good, we ended up ordering 2 more orders of them! We just couldn't get enough of their goodness! 

Only complaint of the night was that the room we were seated in was extremely hot. It started to get uncomfortable in there.

First of all, parking is retarded here.  If you don't care about people parking your car, DO THE FREE VALET.  I drove my boat back there trying to find a parking space, and I couldn't find ONE space I felt comfortable leaving my car.  I ended up parking in the hotel parking lot next door and walked over after leaving the frustration known as Firefly's parking lot.

I wanted the Firefly fries that I've grown to enjoy...They come with Parmesan, Herbs, and an Aioli for $6.  Since I knew I was gonna order another plate or two in addition to the fries, I decided just to spend the money for the steak and fries :P

14oz Ribeye ($20): Red Wine Sauce, Cabrales Bleu Cheese, Firefly Fries and Aioli. Surprisingly large ribeye for the money! It was a good steak, cooked perfectly, but the sauce/seasoning was a little distracting. Still good though!

However, the fries were undercooked and stupid oily.  Like ""dripping off your fingers"" OILY.  I should have returned them, but my steak was cooked perfectly, and I thought it was a waste to turn over the plate.  They probably would have just brought me a new side of fries, but that's in hindsight. 

So you can still get a decent value at Firefly...just factor in bad parking and a hint of inconsistency and you'll probably be fine!

We planned our entire wedding from across the country, so we put our trust in the 5-star yelp reviews Firefly already had. We were a little nervous booking a dinner for over 30 guests having never tried the food, but in this case, the reviews were absolutely right.

HUGE shout out to Fernanda! She totally put us at ease, helped us make our reservation, choose our menu, answer any questions, and everything in between. She was super helpful, got back to us quickly, and adjusted the contract to our needs. We wound up having a few more guests than we originally anticipated, and they were more than accommodating. 

When we arrived for dinner, they had a private room set up for us. Fernanda was actually there with Regina and Neo; they all took really amazing care of us the entire night. Every single tapa was top notch and the drinks were amazing (sangria and mojitos were especially fantastic). People are still raving about how great the food was, even the few picky eaters we had with us. My sister, who doesn't eat seafood, actually came up and went ""OMG did you try the shrimp?!"". That says a lot! Firefly also allowed us to bring in our own cake (they recommended an amazing bakery, Freed's), set up a table for it, and brought it to the back to cut and serve all the guests. Everyone's drinks were full all night and we all left extremely satisfied.

I want to come back to Vegas just to come back to Firefly! It was the best meal we had our entire trip and the staff is amazing.",rgFP1Dm2nI5VwAkho5z-NQ,4,1,5,63QFFZdFclDXmutJ8dNspQ

As a courtesy to the restaurant, we called an hour ahead and told them we'd be arriving at 1:30, and asked if they would mind seating us and taking an immediate order. They said it was fine. So we drive across the city, excited to eat at one of our favorite restaurants, only to find out that they would not seat us once we arrived (30 minutes before closing time). We informed the hostess that we called and she said it was her that we talked to, to confirm the reservation. She then went on to to explain that they decided to close early because they changed their mind. They did not bother to call us back. They were unapologetic, and could care less that two loyal customers had just driven across the city to eat there. It felt like they just spit in our face. I'm familiar with the restaurant business so I know it's not just the hostesses fault, but management is to blame. I'm disgusted that any restaurant would do that to someone. SHAME ON YOU FIREFLY.

We had an excellent server named Pepe, who I will likely request again in the future. He always had a smile on his face and was very attentive given the size of our group and that it was a busy Friday night. I have a shrimp allergy and when I was disappointed that I couldn't try the tierra del mar skewers, Pepe offered to make one of the three skewers all beef so that way I could have some. It came out on a completely separate dish which makes my allergies happy. This was also great for my boyfriend since he loves shrimp but usually doesn't get to order it due to my allergy. We also ordered their truffle fries and albondigas (a staple every time we visit) as they never disappoint! We then tried the ham and cheese croquetas which were great but were just very small - 3 pieces each about 2 inches in size. I probably will not get those again.

They had a long list of tapas categorized by proteins an also had paella's to share. My friend and I started our food adventure with the tomato soup and mini grilled brie sandwich ($7.5). the brie threw us off because were expecting the traditional grilled cheese flavor, yet it was good. The ahi tuna skewers ($10)were also a big hit with us; mango, basil, ginger-soy glaze, house pickles, and salsa verde is what this dish was mixed with. At this point with the, skewers, the soup and the complimentary bread they gave us we were getting a bit full, so we decided to share the delicious ribeye. A 14oz. ribeye with Firefly fries, aioli, red wine sauce and cabrales bleu cheese cooked medium rare ($29) was just the right thing to have. The meat and the pitcher of red wine sangria ($31) were complimenting each other perfectly.

Fernanda and Regina took such great care of us before and during the reception, making sure everyone was taken care of.  Paul and Neo, our servers and bar tenders of the night, also deserve high praise for their efficiency and attentiveness.  

We began outside on the patio for light tapas.  Albondigas, the stuffed dates and artichoke toast kicked off the night.  Multiple trays of each were passed around to the guests, enough where I could have filled up on those had I not known what else was to come.  Although I loved all three of these starters, the albondigas were my favorite.  They were tender and juicy and full of flavor due to the Parmesan and sherry sauce.  The guests raved about the stuffed dates which had a perfect balance of sweet with the red wine reduction sauce and savory with the blue cheese.  The smoked almonds added not only another element of surprise to the mixture of flavors, but a nice juxtaposition of texture to the dates.  My mom and aunt's favorites were the artichoke toast- a perfect amount of salty crunchiness from the bread with a generous piece of warm artichoke on top,  Honestly, as I am writing this review recalling the food, maybe all three were my favorite!

To accompany the starters and the meal, we had an open bar. Being on the patio we had a separate opening to the inside bar that only our guests could order from.  No waiting at all.  I enjoyed the sangria, pretty much all night.  Both the red and the champagne sangrias were filled with fresh fruit and both had  unique flavors.  The champagne sangria was a little sweeter, perfect for dessert, while the red accompanied most of my food.  Regina brought out pitchers for all the guests to enjoy on top of whatever else they wanted to drink. Fernanda, Regina, Paul and Neo did not skip one beat!

Now on to the meal...We were moved to a private room inside.  The only downfall was that there was only a black velvet curtain separating us from another party and at times they got a little loud ( as did we I am sure).  But other than that, Firefly set up a private drink station for us to continue to order drinks from.

We began the meal with Toasted Bread, Almond Butter, and Marinated Olives.  That almond butter was so sweet; being married to the saltiness of the olives made this, again, another tantalizing combination.  Next was the paella. I have never had paella before, but now I am a paella believer!  It was filled with seafood and pork - just a whole lot of stuff! Many guests filled their plates with whichever meats they liked best. We also enjoyed the ribeye and the herb roasted chicken.  The ribeye was nicely cooked, especially in the inside if you like your meat more medium.  It was more cooked on the outside.  The sauce was reminiscent of the red wine reduction form the stuffed dates.  The herb roasted chicken was tender and we were served both white and dark meat.  As a side, we had the firefly fries, and damn that aioli was addictive.  A few guests admitted to eating multiple plate fulls of the fries the next day.

To end our evening of food, we got to savor the Chocolate ""Tres Leches"" Cake.  Moist and delightful, it was a perfect end to the perfect meal.  We also ordered a wedding cake from Freeds which was delivered to Firefly.  It was one of the most flavorful and delicious cakes I have every had - I recommend the almond flavored cake. 

The night was coming to a close, and we all had such an amazing time.  We were supposed to be out by 8, but our speeches went a little longer and people lingered a little longer.  The staff did not rush us out nor did we feel pressured to get out.  This wedding experience was pretty close to perfect, a word I don't use too lightly but used repeatedly in this review.

The only thing I wish is that there was a Firefly in the CLE.

Much thanks to Firefly: Fenanda, Regina, Paul and Neo!",B0L6WgKlb9MnRQSjcqYTAA,2,1,5,tuSUmYZjEVB1E0ud-KXkhA

My boyfriend and I were trying to find a place in Vegas to go that was different, not over priced, and delish. We didn't want to do the traditional steak houses because honestly you can get a good steak from a good steakhouse anywhere. My boyfriend has never had Tapas before so I suggested we look up restaurants with Tapas. Firefly had good reviews so we made reservations for 6pm. When we got there it wasn't very busy yet. 

Ambiance:
The lighting is dim which is nice because it makes you feel like your the only ones in the restaurant. We were seated in a corner booth and it just made everything perfect. There is a lot of red to the color scheme and it kind of had a tacky-manly-romantic vibe to it but it fit its romantic fun feeling.

Service:
We had the best service. Our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable and all around an all star. I have worked in the restaurant industry for a good 5 years and i appreciate when someone is as good as he was. Not only was our server great.. the food runner was good, and the busser or server assistant was amazing. He did not let a empty plate sit on a table for anyone.. I saw him sneakingly cleaning up without interrupting people in the dinner conversations.

Food:
It depends what you get. All of the food we had was good. But some were just good and some were AMAZING. The portion sizes are definitely bigger than a normal tapas place which is nice and well worth the money. Some suggestions for food are.. Dates, Filet, Lamb. Those were our favorites.. we wanted to try much more but we got full fast. Not only is the food good.. omg the sangria was heavenly.. we got the pitcher and it was gone at the end of dinner.

Price:
The price is very reasonable and I'm so glad we went there. We got a pitcher of sangria and 6  tapas.. our bill was $95. We got to try all different kinds of food and get 6 glasses of sangria out of the pitcher. It is very reasonable.

We arrived on a monday night around 10:20pm the place was empty.  At this time we were the only ones who sat inside the restaurant.  Our server was Jesus (tall, skinny gentleman)  He greeted us with a smile, but throughout our visit.  We felt rushed when it came to ordering as if he didn't have time to be waiting on us.  I felt there were other workers in the restaurant that took care of us more than the server.  When it came time to pay the bill, we paid in cash and Jesus said he would be back with the change.  We waited, but all we saw was Jesus walking past us from the kitchen to the bar to his outside tables; He did not bother to look at us or come back to the table.  We flagged him down once we saw that he was not going to come back, only then did he say ""Did you want your change?"" without us having to say anything.  I will say we did not leave a good tip due to our experience.  We thought if was very rude of him to expect he deserved that tip.. We are very generous tippers but we tip based on the overall experience.  Because of that his tip went down further but it was never because of the fact that we are cheap.  We understand that people work for their tips and that is part of their income; but I also believe in excellent customer service wherever I go.

Excellent date night restaurant. The lightning was just right, the service was fast, friendly, and knew when to check in or stay away. The small plates make conversation easy, though you may end up talking about the food a fair bit. Everything seemed to be designed to complement each other.

We ate here 2 times in 3 days if that says something about how much we loved this place.  It's a tapas place with a nice variety of dishes.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the bacon wrapped dates, the mussels, some Asian shrimp dish, the apple and manchego salad, and coffee.  All the food was really great and the coffee was much needed after a long night of partying.  

We came back again with some other friends and had an issue with their steak.  It tasted really weird and the servers were so great and accommodating.  They offered to make the dish again or replace it with any other dish free of charge.  When we didn't want anything, the chef came out to apologize and sent over a free dessert platter! AND they sent us the steak anyway, which I brought home to my husband (and he said it was delicious).  

LOVED the food and the super nice service.  I don't think I've had such great service anywhere (except, of course, for those fancy pants places where it costs $150 a person).

Once we got over this though and sat down at our table we soon forgot where we were and focused on the expansive small plates menu they had.

The list has something for everyone and prices that will save lots of cash for drinks, club entrances and whatever else you might spend your money on in vegas. 

The décor was lacking a bit in my opinion, and at the time we were there the bathroom was under construction so we had to share time with the guys bathroom (ladies in, guys out, ladies in, etc. . .) it was interesting for sure.

It's easily accessible from anywhere in the city and always open late. I used to come here all the time and accidentally burnt myself out on the place, so I had to take a break but it's been long enough so I'm back. Anytime I come here I usually start with the Stuffed Dates [bacon-wrapped,smoked almond,red wine reduction with blue cheese]. That gets me ready for the next few items that I order which are the Chicken Skewers [grilled marinated chicken breast,seasonal veggies,and roasted garlic cream]
The Petit Filet [mini filet mignon, herb cheese,roasted potatoes,mushrooms and red wine sauce]
The Baked Cod [lemon,garlic,butter and fried onion]
The Chorizo Plate [4 imported thinly sliced cured meats, cornichons, capers and mustard] and lastly
The Baked Goat Cheese [goat and garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce, Pesto and toast]. All are delicious and should be given a chance.

The quality and preparation were not all that great, though.  Best thing about it was that the portions were huge.  The ahi tuna skewers and spinach salad was enough for two people.  The fish,however, wasn't of a good quality and it came in some gooey sauce.  The salad was OK, with pine nuts and artichokes and feta, but needed some vinegar and flavor oomph.  The merguez sausage was odd tasting, unlike any I've had before and quite spicy.  The octopus was mealy and came in a large dish with mushy potatoes and other mushy items - odd.  The serrano ham sliders came on awful supermarket hamburger buns and the burgers were of a low quality.  The fried onions as a side, however, were the highlight of the meal.

If your idea of a good time is to bring a crowd and sample many different dishes over the course of several hours, then Firefly may be the place for you. Our party of twelve thoroughly enjoyed the experience and tasted just about everything on the menu, along with several pitchers of their excellent sangria.

An added bonus for vegetarians or those with gluten allergies, Firefly has a separate menu with their vegetarian options on one side and their GF options on the other. This came in handy when ordering for our group, and made it easy to have safe meals for everyone, no matter their dietary restrictions.

If you like sangria, be sure to try some. Both the white and the red are excellent, but I preferred the red. Nice and dry, not too sweet, and a fine accompaniment to the Spanish-style tapas. Also good - their mojitos! Available by the pitcher.

My favorite items were the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, the Padron peppers (deceptively simple, but tasty), and the watermelon sorbet at the meal's close. The sorbet flavor changes daily.

Others at our table raved about the Tierra del Mar skewers and the lamb chops. The bread and almond butter disappeared quickly.

Basically, there's enough variation on the menu to find something for everyone. But that's a little bit of the problem too. The menu feels scattered and not as cohesive as it could be.

Service is professional and fairly efficient, but at times was hit or miss. This is expected with large groups and a busy restaurant, and we never had to wait too long for beverage refills. Plus, the staff wants you to have a good time. As an example, our first order of lamb came out overdone, but Firefly was able to get another going and on the second try the lamb chops were hailed as the standout meat dish of the evening.

One final note. Don't call this a Spanish restaurant if you have an actual person from Spain in your group. It was my colleague's first time in the USA, and he was appalled that Americans think Spaniards eat this way. Live and learn! (Although he did enjoy the food and the drinks. He just took issue with anyone saying it was Spanish.)",w8dy-ibFrNXBfA-TdQDCIQ,1,1,4,eEQN0PN5AEmDCRFzoifjig

Just like the other location the sangria is good, service is friendly and although this place is bigger than the Sahara location there's still a lack of space to move around.

They have a large patio which I can see could be nice to dine on if the weather is  nice but the problem is that Vegas usually has very extreme weather, either too hot or too cold and appropriate weather days are far and few between. Latin nights would have been so much nicer if there were misters on the patio at least or if they held the event indoors. Everyone was complaining about the heat ALL NIGHT and most people had to dance one song and sit out for five to ""cool off"" in the 100 degree temperature. Heat + Sangria + sweating due to dancing = super dehydration and hang over and feeling that I shouldn't go out Friday nights ever again lol 

Also I didn't know that there's an automatic 18% gratuity on drinks for a reservation. Not that we weren't going to tip but that was just a tad odd. I thought that was just for food. Just FYI so you won't be caught off guard!

Everything was delightful. Easy bite has great depth and flavor, and was made with love.

Desserts we had were the mini passion fruit cheesecakes, and the cherry/chocolate bread pudding. Both we above average.

5586484,2015-06-08,1,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,"Initially, I ordered their chopped chicken salad and tierra y mars skewers.

The food took maybe fifteen minutes to come out. The first of my two dishes that came out was the chopped chicken salad, regretfully. What they produced before me was a large white chunky glob of mayonnaise. I proceeded carefully with my fork and made an attempt to identify the dish put before me. What I found were chunks of canned chicken,  shreds of endive, and grapes. The dish was composed of more maynonaise/dressing than of its distasteful counterparts, much too overdressed. This was no salad at all. I returned it to the kitchen. (1/5) Would not recommend.

I later placed an order for their garden variety salad: romaine lettuce, spinach, orange, feta, dried cherries, pine nuts, sherry vinegar, and heart of palm. The orange and dried cherries lend a nice natural sweet component to my dish, which I thoroughly enjoyed, especially since I had selected water for my beverage. This salad is priced at $7.50. What initially attracted me to their aforementioned train wreck of a chopped chicken salad I returned, was the fact that it came with a protein. I added grilled (actually GRILLED, not out of a can, like the first dish) chicken to my new salad for an additional $3 or $3.50 bringing my salad to nearly $12 grand total. Eh, should be $9.00 at most.
(4/5)

The Tierra Y Mars skewers were great. The tapas includes three skewers, stacked with filet mignon, grilled shrimp, and chorizo. (5/5)",zdJ8UlERuMa8IMuBfs4iLA,0,0,4,BAzOZrAUk5NVcqo4tzw_yg

It was a Saturday night and we arrived at Firefly at about 8:00p.  After about 5 minutes we were seated on the heated patio that was beautifully strung with red and white lights and really just seemed to be an extension of the dining room.

Drinks were tasty: sangria and dirty martinis, and we were offered a nice crusty bread with compound butter consisting of schraicha, honey and almonds.  It was really good!

We ordered two cold plates and two hot plates.  The green apple manchego salad and pisto were real standouts.  All the plates were reasonably priced between $4 and $6.

For dessert: the caramel flan with almond biscotti was sized very well and tasted perfect! Not too-eggy and velvety smooth.

Service- wonderful service! Waiters are not pushy, very willing to answer questions and give suggestions. Personable and fast. Clears dishes quickly, refills waters, great overall. 

Food: lots of vegetarian options. I hear the meaty ones are good, too.

- Paella: large cast iron skillet- looking thing, which serves 3-6, not 2-4, was tasty and flavorful. *** Really does take about 40min., so order it first. 

- Manchego mac & cheese: creamy & cheesy. Not overly salty

- Tomato soup: how come I can't get that flavor at home? Rich and smooth, just the right balance of tomato-sweet-salty. 

- Mushroom puff pastry thing: creamy. With mushrooms that weren't overlooked- great texture. 

-  Veggie empanadas:  crispy crust, and a filling of who-knows-what deliciousness. Outside wasn't too thick, and the filling was plentiful. 

Sangria- 2 kinds: sparkling white or traditional red. Both were tasty, but most ppl preferred the red.

Sangria - No. Not strong enough, and way too little fruit flavor for a drink that claims to have been marinated for 3 days. Did feel like the pitcher was never-ending, just never-ending sugar juice.

Stuffed dates - No. Recommended by server. Tasted like BBQ sauce.

Stuffed peppers - No. I prefer the Peruvian version. This was a bit overly cheesy (and I love cheese).

Pulpo asado - Eh. I've had better.

Camarones a la diabla - No. Tasted Chinese, and not spicy at all.

Albondigas - Eh. 6 meatballs for $7. Could have had 3 In-N-Out cheeseburgers.

Lamb chops - Now we're talking. The 2 chops for $12 were very tender, and my favorite of the night (and I don't even eat lamb!).

Ambiance is not conducive to holding a conversation, anything romantic, or close to relaxing. It's probably easier to hold a conversation at Chinese dim sum restaurants than it is here, as noise is coming at you at all angles. I could barely hear my BF across the table. The only good thing was the service; my glass was always full!

I figure a great restaurant with 5000 reviews praising their establishment doesn't need another similar review for someone to wade through.  This is not one of those occasions.

I suppose I should have seen the stale, tough bread as a sign.  If I did, I chose to ignore it.  Overall, the food was hit-and-miss.  The apple manchego salad was nice - light and refreshing.  The ubiquitous bacon-wrapped dates were fine, the recommended shrimp, chorizo and filet skewers disappointing and the also-recommended grilled octopus just terrible.  Neither seafood option was fresh - the octopus was tough and tasted off, with a miss-matched sauce and generic potatoes.  The filet was fine, but the shrimp were frozen and in short supply.  The chorizo almost non-existant.

My real issues here are with the restaurant in general.  This was, by far, the most unimaginative, pretentious, poorly-executed and disappointing tapas restaurant I have ever been to.  The menu is just plain boring.  Come on, this is tapas!  Give me something exciting I've never seen before.  Give me crazy combinations and flavors.  At least give me something simple done perfectly.

I know this is Vegas, but off-the-strip Vegas.  House music?  Really?  An entrance like a steak house out of the 60s?  Pretentious waiters and bartenders who would rather talk to each other than their customers?

I have heard about this place for years, had friends recommend it and was anxious to try it.  Maybe it just can't live up to the hype.  Don't waste your money in town where great food is everywhere.  It's not worth the drive.  It's not worth the money.  It's not worth eating here at all.",a8M8nEKrluFrWYYstXXcPg,0,0,1,AhTCvIs4lV3sNmS4d7mphQ

Mixed Paella - $26 - All the paella dishes take about 40 minutes to prepare so I placed an order for this as soon as we arrived.  They are also highly customizable.  My mixed paella consisted of shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, veggies, hold the chorizo (as I don't eat pork).  This was the star of the night as this dish was bursting with flavors and had quality ingredients.  The dish is designed for 2 to 4 people to share.

Pulpo Asado - $10 - Another one of my favorites was the grilled octopus with potatos, tomato, and a paprika-lemon vinaigrette.  It wasn't as soft and tender as my favorite tapas place, but it was still very good.

Scallop Escargots - $10.50 - This dish consisted of scallops baked in garlic-herb butter and the presentation gave the affect that they were escargots.

Tinga Empanada - $4 - This tapa was a bit small and consisted of 2 crispy chicken empanadas, tomato, onion, and chili-lime crema.  This dish was good as well.

Petite Filet - $13.00. - The filet mignon was tender and I asked them to prepare the dish without the red wine sauce.  This dish wasn't bad, but I would probably order some of the other tapas.

We were a party of five and ordered the chicken & mushroom paella, two pitchers of the red sangria (my favorite over the white) and several tapas. The bacon wrapped dates are by far the best I've ever had, the pork empanadas and roasted red peppers are also a standouts. All the others were great as well. Although we enjoy this place a lot, it was our first time bringing out of town family members here and they were beyond impressed with the food, ambiance and service. 

HOWEVER: I must note that the valet parking here is RIDICULOUS!  It's like FIVE feet from the entrance. We initially parked in an open spot out front NOT marked for valet, only to have the jerky valet guy bitch us out for parking in a ""valet"" spot. So we backed out of the spot, drove about two feet and gave him our keys to valet....and he parked it in just about the same damn spot! I don't get it, but whatever. Wasn't thrilled about tipping him either, but the fiancé did. 

Definitely my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Despite the idiot valet situation. I think we would have had a better time if we weren't all put off by the valet guy. Lame.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,1,1,5,nQh1D4sOjPXi4FyW_6SlUg

The reason I didn't give a 5star is because they auto added a gratuity. I truly despise that. This is Vegas and hospitality and guest service are expected. All interactions like this should be 5star no matter where you go. That being said, lets talk about the food. ITWAS SOOOO GOOD.  there was 6 of us and we all ordered 3 tapas so u can imagine what our table looked like. I didn't get the waiters name, slight deduction for that as well, but he made suggestions to me based on what my friends ordered and they were spot on. i got to try the shrimp tempura, the filet, the steak on a stick, the ahi tuna, the scallops, empanada ( chicken ), stuffed pepper, the spanish chorizo, the ham, and the mini bagles and salmon. everything was so good. had a stella draft. it was kind of tiny to be honest and this is coming from a non-drinker. either way yo will not be disappointed !  the amount of food they put on each plate is actually pretty significant. enjoy !!!",FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,1,2,4,lD_h7uxxti8Aqs5Mfiw8GQ

Stepping into firefly I noticed the environment was nice and clean. The walls were painted with warm, dark tones. The overall atmosphere was pleasing. You even had the option to sit outside, but with the sun beaming out we decided to enjoy our meal inside where it was cool. 

We stuck with the groupon and ordered multiple tapas and not one of them was a disappointment. My favorite tapas would have to be the mushroom and steak skewers and the smoked salmon toast. The steak skewers were tender, juicy, and flavorful. And the smoked salmon toast..yuuum! Their dishes were served with abundant flavors. And before I forget to mention, their firefly fries are really good; the dipping sauce served with it really compliments the fries.

Made a reservation before leaving the house and waltzed right in. Okay, not really, we did have to wait a few minutes because there was a line of people at the host stand, but it wasn't more than 10 minutes before our table was ready. Nahum was our server and he was on point. He checked back often but wasn't overpowering the table and he was SO NICE!

The menu is huge and the plates are tapas style so it's easy to over order. A few highlights for me were the Scallop Escargots with the buttery herb sauce and the Chicago Beef. Oddly, my table mates weren't as big of a fan of the Chicago inspired sandwiches but they are east coasters so perhaps they have more to compare it to. I also loved the Hearts of Palm *Crab* Cakes. They are vegan, so don't expect crab, but I loved the texture and flavor. 

A few misses were the Serrano Ham & Cheese plate and the Seafood Paella. The cheese on the plate was flavorless and the paella was very bland.

We got 13 different tapas (3-4 sets of each) and some paella.  The paella was OK.  If you get it, get the seafood one.  I've had some pretty good paella and it set the bar really high.

Make sure to start with their Sangria (I got the red).  It was delicious!  They say they marinate it for a minimum of 3 days and it definitely shows.  So smooth and bomb.

Pros:
+ Restaurant had a nice ambiance
+ Friendly staff (the owner came out and even bought us a couple rounds of drinks for the bachelor party).
+ Waiter was knowledgeable about the food
+ Huge selection of tapas to choose from (could make things difficult)

Cons:
- Not exactly on the strip, but worth it for a nice dinner.

Food highlights:
+ SCALLOPS ""ESCARGOTS"" - these scallops were amazing!!  My favorite dish here!!!  They were cooked in the escargots container thing and the garlic herb butter hit the spot so well.  Definitely get this!!
+ MANCHEGO MAC 'N' CHEESE - super cheesy but very delicious.  Can never go wrong with mac n cheese
+ CHORIZO CLAMS - clams with chorizo in a sweet and salty sauce.  I believe it came from the clams and the the chorizo.
+ Lamb skewers - tender and did not have a gamey taste to it
+ CAMARONES A LA DIABLA - big shrimps cooked to perfection. nice and crunchy with a sweet and spicy chili sauce that complemented it very well.
+ STUFFED DATES - bacon wrapped dates... crispy bacon wrapped with dates inside.
+ TIERRA Y MAR SKEWERS - shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage.  AWESOME COMBO!!! enough said.

I'd definitely come back to this place.  Just make sure to come with a decent crowd so you can order a bunch of tapas.

Firefly! When we heard they shut down we were so bummed. I just loved the atmosphere at the old location. We always take our friends  whenever were in town. I dream about the pardon peppers and bacon wrapped dates. We had no problem getting a table around 8:30 or so on a Monday night. The new place seemed almost bare it's so much bigger. We sat across from the kitchen next to each other looking into the kitchen thru the swinging door. Not what  we had in mind . I hate being to close to the kitchen traffic. We decided to move to the bar. It's a really nice addition. We were the only ones at the bar when we sat down. By the time we left it was 3/4 full. Restaurant appreciation night I believe. We always order red sangria but heard the white was really good. Our bartender offered to let us sample it . We still went with red. 2 of us will down a pitcher!  We are in Vegas you know! We were brought some yummy bread and omg! That butter is the best stuff ever! I forgot about the butter!  We ordered our usual , 1 order of bacon wrapped dates, then pardon peppers, such wonderful chile flavor not spicy a little salty, I believe they are flash fried, but I think the order was a little smaller than it use to be. They are so addictive. I found 1 place in Denver to get them but not the same  restaurant vibe. We decide we need more dates and then the cream cheese stuffed peppers. The sauce and cheese and peppers! Yum! Our bartender told us about the garbanzo beans. We had never had them roasted in the shell before. We liked them.  And then more stuffed peppers! That was our fav. Dinner in Vegas as always. Just sit and graze. Every bite was a party in my mouth! The bartenders were on top of the water and plates and very friendly. The manager stopped to see how everything was and we chatted for quite a while.  He was eager to hear our comments. When he found out we were in the bar biz in Denver he even gave us the locals discount! That was a really nice thing for him to do. I can't remember names as it's been too long. I should have written this sooner.  But life happens.  The food is as good as ever at the new location.  The atmosphere in the dining room I'm not sure I'm sold on. Something's missing.

We've been here several times and enjoy many of the different tapas. I suggest trying the croquets, bacon wrapped stuffed dates, manchego Mac and cheese, albondigas, & empanadas. Those are just a few of the amazing dishes they have. They are priced just right for all the food and have excellent atmosphere.",V7y_-LF5saejz-2Uy7EBJg,1,0,5,3RkrjDnl0Q7Uaiw14duuQQ

Came with a groupon( 30 for 50) We ordered the Garden Variety Salad, Spanish tortilla, fries, meatballs, ribs, chicken skewer, pork empanada and garlic shrimp.  They forgot to bring us the ribs, but we were so full by the time everything else came that we just didn't say anything.  The salad was very good, very refreshing.  I'd totally get a salad here because you need the acidity of the dressings to break up the other proteins you order.  The sauce on the tortilla was WAY too spicy for me.  I had to send it back and have them remake it.  The shrimp were too spicy as well, but I just picked off the red flecks of pepper and that was ok. 

The service was good, if not a little rushed.  There was no rhyme or reason to the way the dishes came out.  We didn't drink so can't comment on that, but the food was great.  The complimentary bread was delicious too.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,1,0,4,vToabQXjeU4x2pesJbgOXg

I usually start off with a mojito but last night switched to mescal mule, it was delicious and hit the spot. Also steering away from ordering the usual chorizo and clams, we ordered the ham and manchango plate, scallops, tuna skewers, and apple and manchango salad. All were spot on and would order them all again. The scallops were decadent!  Love this place!",wqAGSxMie6Q0OD4Qll9Nug,1,0,5,qK0hLYvlVcW7MA8LZCbcCg

I have been here so many times and I just haven't gotten a chance to write a review. I order probably 6-7 dishes every time I'm here. My top favorites so far are their bacon wrapped dates, mushroom tart, tierra y mar skewers, scallop ""escargots"", steak&mushroom skewers, and their camarones a la diabla. The bacon wrapped dates is a nice blend of sweet and salty, with a dash of creaminess from the cheese crumbles. I can have all 5 to myself, honestly. The mushroom reminds me of cream of mushroom soup over puff pastries. It's so delicious! The tierra y may skewers is a little bit of everything from shrimp, chorizo, and I think some beef. The scallop ""escargots"" are exactly what they sound like, they're scallops made how escargots are normally made on the escargot platter with the butter herbs. The butter herbs is so delicious. After eating all the scallops, I enjoy dipping my bread in the butter. For the steak and mushrooms, it's steak and mushrooms! How can you go wrong with that. The camarones a la diabla are shrimps in a somewhat sweet and spicy sauce. It's to die for. I also love dipping my bread in the sauce. Maybe the only reason that I don't write this review is because it makes me hungry! Haha.
 
The service is very subpar. In all honestly, they should just hire more employees because it takes long to get your order in, to get more orders, to get a refill or anything. Plus the guys are not very pleasant, but oh wells! Can't expect 5 start service from such a busy place. Parking sucks so maybe just bring a couple dollars for the valet? And it's a very noisy atmosphere so don't expect to go here for a quiet dinner. Definitely try this place out.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,2,2,4,6UTtftMtoKaZnPgTdklDzg

A friend was telling me how this restaurant was once shut down for health violations but don't panic its under new ownership :) 

Our waitress was a super friendly women who checked in on us often and let us order as we go. Not something I recommend if your really hungry, the food did take a little longer coming out then I had hoped.

And its best to come with friends and share you plate.

But I do recommend that you order the desert platter its to die for!",zuq9saMloDwHsMXsuTwV0Q,0,0,5,NAeaqk-ZaTFxWkWlVLartA

The pomegranate mojitos are my favorite drink, why get a glass when the pitcher is cheaper! The stuffed mushrooms with chorizo are amazing. I also have never liked blue cheese but being stuffed in the dates is a whole new spin and melts in your mouth. The paella is also very delicious with many ingredients but it does take a while to cook so order first. Latin night is always a good experience and can't wait to go back.

Our friends chose to sit on the patio, so I didn't get to see the inside. The patio faces a busy 6 lane roadway with no real view, and no garden between you and the street, only the sidewalk. The waiter never brought my drink. We ordered loads of tapas to share which ranged in price from $8 to $12. The dated wrapped in bacon with blue cheese were delicious, but overcooked. The steak and mushroom skewers were such a disappointment - ordered medium - they were tough and were fat and gristle, so we left them uneaten. The calamari was good, the roasted vegetables were mushy and flavorless, the veggie empanadas were forgettable but served on a nice bed of greens that we all enjoyed. Then there was the ribeye steak - we ordered it medium rare, but it was so rare no one ate it and the steak knife they served it with wouldn't cut the steak! The shrimp tempura, the shaved steak sandwiches and the big pasta bowl were the favorites. The shrimp tempura had enough shrimp for 5 to taste and also was on a pile of vegetables tempura that were delicious. The steak on the sandwiches was hot and tender, served on delicious fresh rolls, with a chopped cold vegetable relish topping and we cut them into 4 generous servings. The pasta was angel hair with a red sauce that was just spicy enough to perk up the taste buds without burning them. The food was served hot as each dish is brought out as it is ready, so no one really ate at the same time.  Plates were not cleared, so we ended up with piles of plates, and they never offered us clean tasting plaes. Our friends had a pitcher of peach sangria, which they reported was delicious. I was in it for the company, and some of the food was good, but I have no desire to return.",47We7Jq06tuYtnGzaMCdmQ,1,0,2,picaxy3xQlvYoNxDrdPTxw

My medium-cooked filet was surprisingly prepared to perfection, really tender and juicy. The scallop ""escargots"" was good as well but the portion sucks.

At the end of the trip everyone said it was their favorite place out of all the restaurants we went to and I have to agree!  I made a reservation a week ahead of time for a party of 6 and they called the day before to confirm. The ambiance is dim lit, energetic, loud and fun! 

It's the perfect place to go to with a group because you can try a little bit of everything. We ordered and ate family style and everyone seemed to enjoy it. All that was left was empty dishes! Some of our favorites were the stuffed dates, baked goat cheese, and the steak and mushroom skewers. 

Out of the 6 of us 5 were sharing the tapas and 1 person ordered an entree. The tapas came out all at once, but our friend with the entree had to wait 15 minutes before hers came out so that sucked since we all felt bad she didn't have her food at the same time as everyone else. We could have clarified a bit better when we ordered. Since the tapas came out all at once I'd recommend ordering in courses especially if you are ordering half the menu like we did. The service was good and only got a little slow at times, but they were slammed so its to be expected. 

In comparison to all the restaurants on the strip we visited, the food at Firefly was better and it was a lot cheaper since you aren't paying for the celebrity chef's name. 

We also had fun with the GIF maker on the way out!",_kcHxYPXRYjU4hk2xtCO0w,4,3,5,a7Xxxw2a-YSK-xO0pljphA
