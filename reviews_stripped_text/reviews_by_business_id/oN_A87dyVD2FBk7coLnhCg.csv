The poor guy is often alone - cooking, taking orders, cash register, packing to-go food..  but its definitely worth waiting! Towards the bathroom there's a funky seating with few tables, chairs, couch..even massage chairs and foot massagers while you wait for your food.

This place is the bomb diggity. One man show, my dude is taking orders, flipping tortillas, FaceTiming, and watching Espn deportes at the same time. 

I usually don't mind the 20-30 minute wait for my burrito but god damn it, it was well worth it. Probably the best Carne Asada I've ever had. Period. and this is coming from a guy who flew to San Francisco and UBERed to El Farrolito to get Carne Asada. That good, and this guy's shop is clean as hell.

You can never get a phone order in because this guy is running around all day 8-5pm. 

CARNE ASADA BURRITO no rice, no beans and sub them out for SOUR CREAM AND CHEESE, thank me later (no drake)

The first time I went thee I stood in line and the guy said ""I heard this place was the best"". Apparently word gets around! If you don't believe me then here are some facts that tell you why:

1) They only accept cash. That means they get enough biz not to care about accepting credit cards

2) I see the same clientele frequently (good repeat customers)

3) There is only ONE cook and he works hard and keeps his food consistent.

So the bad? Well, lunchtime can mean long waits because of number 3 above. They are not open on Sundays nor past 5pm. Sometimes they don't always open at 8am either... which means I can't get a breakkie burrito before work :(

It's a small scale kitchen turning out mexican food that most fully equipped restaurants can't even dream of coming close to. The gas station itself is busy af. It's got a full service car wash and it's hectic. Add this guy and the many loyal customers that come in & out all day and you got a bit of chaos. 

So here's the breakdown: he takes orders at the register...3, 4, 5 at a time. Rings them up, takes your money, and then he goes and cooks everything and you wait. And wait. I have waited 40 minutes at some times...it gets very busy...you gotta be smart when choosing when to go. Do not go in there at peak times like lunch and think you're just gonna run in real quick. My husband gets angry during the wait. He says things like: 
This is ridiculous. 
It's not worth this wait. 
I'm never coming back. 
Then we get our food, he takes one bite and says things like:
This is the best burrito I've ever had. 
It's totally worth that wait. 
And I can't wait to go back.

So everything on his menu is delicious and our favorites include all the burritos but especially the California, the carne asada & the carnitas. We love the beef tacos and the adobada tacos. Yummy enchiladas and oh my husband ordered a carnitas quesadilla thinking he'd be able to eat that AND a burrito but the quesadilla turned out to be more than a meal!

The chicken in each roll was of a generous portion and perfectly seasoned. Beware: The red salsa they serve here will light your tongue ablaze. Beware. The green salsa was more of a medium heat and very delicious. In the end, I bellied up and admitted to my co-workers that they were right along, this place is amazing.

Inside of the Sinclair Choice gas station you'll find Chile Verde Express a small restaurant serving up some quick Mexican food similar to those from Roberto's, Fausto's, Don Tortaco, etc. If you take a look at their pictures the items that stands out were the nachos and fries so of course I had to have one of them.  The carne asada fries was what I went with. Definitely one of the better I've had. I pretty much killed the entire container on my own in one sitting. I know I shouldn't have done it but it was one of those moments where I kept eating and eating and before I knew it they were all gone. I don't know what inside made it so good cause it looked like you typical carne asada fries.  It had a lot of fries, a lot of meat, a lot of quac, cheese, it was full loaded to hit me in the mouth. Maybe it was magic, they did take longer than expected. I haven't tried any of the other items yet but why would I want to. This is all I need why would I mess up a good thing. 

A few things about the place you want to remember when coming 1) It's cash only. Yea I don't know why businesses always do it. 2) It's not super fast but not super slow. Being that it's located at a gas station that also does full service car washes customers waiting might want to eat therefore a little waiting list. 3) Not really a place to dine unless you dont mind dining on a counter with a few stools in the middle of a gas.station.

As far as food goes, it's the best that I've found in my neighborhood. I've ordered the mini carne asada tacos. He really hooked it up by giving 2-3 times the normal serving of meat, the chicken rolled tacos with guacamole are crack, & the carne asada nachos are large enough to share with 3-4 people. You might as well forget about your diet if you are ordering those nachos. Don't forget to top your food with the red hot sauce. It has a spicy kick to it.

I like the affordable prices, affordable for the average college student. Cleanliness is always welcomed and it's reassuring to see him washing his hands before each order.

I get they are quick and convenient but between the rude despicable employees who despise their jobs and food that makes you feel sick the entire next day I had just given up on getting legit tacos and settled for Chipotle all these years. I'm so glad I randomly did a search on Yelp and ran across this place. I have been in this gas station so many times over theyears when mailing stuff to avoid the actual post office lol. 

I seriously can't even believe I passed this taco place every time as I just assumed it was   nothing special and mediocre food like everything else I had tried so far. Wow wish I had read reviews years ago. It is crazy to me how a place within a gas station can serve better quality Mexican food than any restaurant and other place I have tried on the SW. Owner is all about quality and between the Carne Asada tacos, Fries, Tortas, and Chicken anything I am blown away to how not only delicious but beyond fresh and quality every last thing is.

I just found a place that is going to replace Don Tortaco! It is not only better, it is a LOT better! 

This awesome gem is located inside the Sinclair Choice convenience store on the northwest corner of Windmill and Rainbow. At first glance it certainly doesn't look like much. It's actually just off in a corner of the store across from the cashier. 

This morning I finally had a chance to check it out for myself. The do have a little seating area with a few stools, while a flat screen TV plays ESPN nearby. I opted for my usual breakfast burrito while my friend opted for a carne asada burrito. 

The prices are similar to Don Tortaco. The healthy sized portions are similar to Don Tortaco. The difference here is the quality of the food! Much tastier and, more importantly, not nearly as greasy as Don Tortaco! Seriously, I was amazed at how tasty my burrito was! I also love the fact that you can watch the guy cook up your order as you take a seat on the stool.

Service was quick and friendly, so no complaints there.

I am most certainly in a lot of trouble. With a place like this being so close to the house, I can see myself coming here quite often!

The nachos are surely supreme. It's nice to go somewhere that actually gives you enough toppings for every chip. Their guacamole is rich and creamy, their carne asada is flavorful and bold, and their red salsa...*melts* is so spicy it makes you sweat. (Of course there's green tomatillo salsa if you like the flavors within the heat) 

My favorite thing to order is the machaca burrito with extra cheese. It hits every spot. My co-workers can vouch for all the other breakfast burritos and while I was there the chorizo and ham seemed to be extremely popular. I'm more of a bacon girl myself.

Carlos wasn't going to budge and after ordering a chile verde and asada combination plate, and a fresh order of tortilla chips and salsa i know why.......Everything here is the sh1t!

So we were the last ones standing to get our order and I'll tell you the food is fantastic! But the service sucks! If you have patience and don't mind getting your order skipped repeatedly this is a fantastic place to eat, but I think this was the last straw for me.

My first attempt was a disappointment because I showed up at around 5:45pm on a Sunday and it was closed. Although frustrated, I couldn't get too upset since it is a one man show and I'm sure he'd like to get home to his family at some point. 
My next attempt was around 7pm on a Tuesday evening. Ordered food to go for the entire family and sat and waited for it with my oldest son. 

Was super impressed by the process this gentleman has making all of the food. After cooking the meat and filling two carne asada tacos, he added more to the grill and stuffed those tacos to the gill!! My oldest son who refuses to eat carnitas from any place but home, ordered two mini carnitas tacos and absolutely loved them!! 

Overall the entire family loved what they ordered. It's cheaper than a Don Tor Taco or Roberto's and the food is so much better! We will definitely be returning to help support this gentleman's business and enjoy some delicious homemade Mexican food!",iobFqj0M8OR3iSc_anl8jQ,3,1,5,T9kFpqtXDjsFvUbg-kRj1g

3877115,2014-07-27,1,oN_A87dyVD2FBk7coLnhCg,"What an awesome little hidden gem inside of a gas station. Yes, you totally wouldn't expect a joint such as this at a gas station to serve such good food like Chile Verde does, but you are in for a surprise. Plus, you can't really see their signage since it's on the same one as the gas station prices, but I guess they get all their business through word of mouth and of course Yelp. Our church group uses this gas station for our fireworks booth and 2 years ago when we first did it I didn't really pay much attention to them. Now that I read all these awesome reviews I definitely had to try them out. During our 6 days we were there I tried them 2 times and they certainly did not disappoint! The first time I had the nachos with beef and everyone is right the tortilla chips are made fresh and they are delicious. Unlike, Roberto's who has dry nachos and carne asada, their version of beef nachos was certainly not dry but had some moisture to them. I'm glad I asked for my beans on the side because it would of ruined the awesome texture of the fresh tortilla chips. The second time I ordered the California burrito, which was priced at around $5. This burrito was huge! At other places they would probably price it at $6 or $7 which makes Chile Verde affordable. I bet 2 people with smaller appetites could share that burrito because I could only eat 3/4 and let me tell you I am an eater. The inside of the burrito had fries and beef with salsa. Pretty delicious I must say. My only major gripe is that the owner is a 1 man show! He is the cashier, the cook, the expediter, everything! I know he is probably doing that to reduce costs and keep prices low, but man the wait time is rather long just like everyone says. Both times I was there, he was super busy. Although the second time the food came our faster than the first. The first time I think I waited a good 15 minutes. If only I lived in this area, but I guess this joint adds on to the foodie spots on Rainbow Blvd/South West area. The chimichanga looks good and I will order that next time I'm here. Chile Verde is definitely a step up above Roberto's and if you're in the area craving Mexican food, definitely hit Chile Verde up!",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,2,1,4,OIPtqIFGKSryq165M-KExQ

Ive been trying several new Mexican spots around this area recently, and by far this tops them all.   It's a one man show, and he has a respectable size menu to show off too.  I didn't know what i really wanted at first, so i settled with the Asada Burrito.  And I'm glad i did.  The steak tasted fresh.  I didn't pick the meat apart to taste the seasoning like i normally would because i was already enjoying it.  It was that good with all the works; beans, lettuce, diced tomatoes, rice, and guacamole.  Pick it up a notch and add some of that red hot sauce.   WOOoo!

2nd time I came around to try their Chili Verde Burrito.  Slow roasted pork shoulder with bean and cheese.  The pork i could tell was made with extra care as it was extraordinary tender.  Again, i screwed up and didn't pick apart the burrito for some more refine tasting.  I went straight for what i know was good, the red hot sauce, and went into town.  This guy sure knows how to make a good burrito!

I personally like the Asada better, but that's because i prefer steak over pork.  But in all honesty you can't go wrong with either.  They're both great.  Can't wait to come back and try some other stuff.  Couple more recon and this may potentially be my fav around the SW area.

So why the less than stellar review? Well, there's a few things. 

There are only 8 or so stools to sit on. 5 in the front and 3 in the back. I guess it being in a gas station they prefer you to take your food and go. Don't plan on bringing in the family and having a comfortable sit down dinner. It ain't gonna happen. 

It's a one man show. Expect to wait 15 to 20 minutes for your order during the lunch rush. On two occasions I've seen a lady working with the only guy there. This was out of the 10 or so visits I've had. 

The hours are misleading. Please do yourself a favor and CALL before coming here. I came in at 6:15 only to realize that he closed when he was supposed to close at 8. This isn't the first time this has happened. I even called earlier at 12 and I was told they'd close at 8. It's a good thing I live nearby or else I'd be furious. 

My last gripe about the place is that the guy, or the both of them if the lady is working, will literally stop taking orders if they have a big order to fill. This, unfortunately, is not uncommon. There's a police station right across the street and the officers are big fans of the place. You'll see them carrying bags of orders from time to time. 

If it weren't for the amazing food with very reasonable prices, I would not bother coming here. Next time you're heading south on Rainbow off the 215, take the extra 3 minutes and drive past Chipotle and Roberto's/Don Tortaco and give Chile Verde Express a try. You'll be glad you did.

We get them about 3 times a week and they are consistently amazing every time. My favorite thing is that they use fresh eggs.

Be ready for a little bit of a wait, he's the only one working most of the time and there are always people here, but trust me it's worth it!

I can't think of any metaphor that relates to Chile Verde Express better than that!

My curiosity had already been built up prior to actually trying the food, reason for that is I arrived a 90 minutes before closing, and I discovered the sign was turned off. I spoke to the front counter clerk, and he explained to me that the guy ran out of food. It's not one off thing either, its gets busy on certain days, since only Carlos runs the joint this is common. I was shocked to hear him say that, so later in the week I made a second attempt to try it out.  
 
I ordered the Chile Verde, incredibly flavorful, tomatillo festival in my mouth and it was served hot!! I was stupid to ask for hot sauce, but it turned out I didn't need it. The portion was very generous with more meat and less rice and beans. 

I wouldn't compare this place to any fast food, more like fast casual food. All the food is made to order, so there is a bit of wait but its worth the time. Considering this place is run by one person Carlos (cook), that's an impressive feat by itself plus the man puts his heart into his cooking.

5116833,2017-01-31,1,oN_A87dyVD2FBk7coLnhCg,"Wow!  I mean WOW!!!  I've been here three times now. I have tried the carne asada fries, bean and cheese burrito, chicken (hard shell) tacos, and most recently their carne asada burrito. 

The asada fries were not bad, I have no complaints. They're better than Roberto's, Don Tortaco, and most every other fast food Mexican place in Las Vegas. The bean and cheese burrito was pretty good for being just that, beans and cheese. The beans and the cheese were both flavorful. Not too salty, not bland. 

Now, the chicken tacos are AMAZING!!  The chicken isn't just tender and seasoned, but the taco shell is crunchy.  They're not pre-maid shells, it tastes as if everything is made freshly. They come with some lettuce and a blend of cheeses that compliments the flavor of the chicken. You can add hot sauce, but honestly you won't need to if you want taste the good flavors. I could eat about 3 of them in one sitting (although I haven't just yet). 

I just had their carne asada burrito and I was blown away. Not only did I get flavor from the first to the last bite, but it also had the right amount of beans, rice, and meat along with some pico de gallo. The burrito itself is huge as you'll see by my pictures. I put napkins and a fork by the burrito for size comparison. The meat itself is tender and there weren't any pieces of meat that are nerves (the hard to chew pieces of meat). All in all, it's is all you need for a lunch meal. I bought mine with the chicken taco and I almost couldn't finish them both. 

Since I've been here three times now, I can say that it is definitely the best Mexican food place to eat at. However, it's not a restaurant (it's more like a diner); it's inside a gas station (which btw I would normally NEVER eat at), but don't let that turn you off. 

The only two drawbacks are they only take cash (no biggie for me since I can't understand why anyone would use a credit card for fast food) and their hours. They don't open long enough for my schedule. So just make sure you check on yelp before you go. Oh and make sure to tip them even if it's your first time.

In its defense however this is no regular fuel depot. This place has gambling (duh), a post office, and a car wash, oil change, smog, and in the Summer (sometimes) shaved ice.

Everything my family and I have eaten here has been delicious, they LOVE the carne asada fries! I LOVE the ""little-donkeys"" and the ""cheese sandwiches"" so to speak.

We used to go here much more often, however ordering for a large family takes the one man show quite a while to make (and time IS of the essence these days right?) as well as the biggest blow of all to me... he only accepts CA$H now... no more debit, no more credit. I don't know about you, but even in this gambling town I pretty much don't carry any cash (FYI would be pickpockets/thieves).

So, if you are flush with cash, have lots of time, and want really good food to go, this is a great place to get it from.

PS- the salsa, when he says hot is hot... he means it. My tabasco drinking days are behind me, however I can rest assured telling you, their red salsa is so hot, it is almost unpleasant to eat it on your food.

I'll probably end up saying what most of our fellow yelpers have already said, so I'll cut to the chase! I ordered a chicken burrito with rice, beans, bell peppers, and tomatoes.

Pros
- The food quality is a lot better than other places in the area. 
- The chicken was juicy with just the right amount of salt.
- They put grilled peppers and tomatoes in burritos 
- Their menu is simple and to the point.
- Portion sizes are big enough to get you full.
- They offer traditional aguas frescas, or fruit juices in English. They had pineapple, hibiscus flower, and horchata. 
- They also offer Jarritos, which is a flavored soda. Not many places offer this so definitely get one. 


Cons
- Wait time. I came in at 3:30, didn't have my order taken until 4:00.
- Understaffed. Only one person taking orders and cooking. 
- Cash only. The gas station has an ATM that charges $2.30, and the gas station will only give you 10$ cash back with a .50 cent charge. 

So there aren't many bad things I could say about this place because the overall taste of the food is a lot better than the other places in my area.

Got myself a California burrito bc well... I'm from Los Angeles and never had a Cali burrito.... hahah So, I was curious on LV's take on Cali burritos. 

The attendant/cook was cool and friendly. He really hooked it up. That was a huge burrito, just like back home. He then asked me, hot sauce or mild sauce. I'm a dragon when it comes to spice- hot sauce don't really phase me -so I passed on the mild.

Took my first bite w/o sauce and damn! It's pretty good- some decent quality. It doesn't taste like an LA burrito but its still damn good. First time I had a burrito with fries in it! I then poured a load of hot sauce and damn... That hot sauce has a kick! I like it! 

The super nachos is MASSIVE and delicious... Definitely enough for 4 peeps. I had the carne asada super nachos and man... So much carne asada!!! Just look at the picture!

I just say ""hey sweetie my car is dirty and needs a full wash inside and out"" this gives me at least 20 minutes to drop off my car at the gas station for a full service car wash/detail/and fuel up. Once done I head inside and place an order for some of the best, top notch Mexican food on this side of Vegas.

Being a Gringo I normally like ground beef tacos and don't like the shredded beef ones but here the shredded beef is perfectly seasoned and grilled to ordered on an Iron Flat top. They throw the onions and peppers on the grill and that fuses all the flavors together with the meat. Simply stated its delicious.

The enchiladas and the sauce is damn good as well. Probably 2nd in Vegas. (There is a hole in the wall dive place in south Vegas that beats them in my opinion but that's about it). 

Only downside to this place is that its an express and shares space with a gas station. Seating/parking can be minimal especially on the weekends when everyone is getting a car wash/ fuel but by paying for that full service car wash your car is in their hands for at least 20 mins and that is plenty of time to get your food cooked and consumed before leaving with a near spotless vehicle.

My daughter loved the hard shell chicken tacos and hubby loved the ginormous carne asada chimichanga. I would never have tried a gas station restaurant but all the reviews made me curious.

I was there first and the guy asked the guy behind me for the order. I was there first and I am a girl!!!!?!!! Lady first?!!!!!last time I was here I was told I need to wait for 45 mins for my order. The lady was rude too. I love the food but I really don't appreciate the service.,b9pqGvEoYyTLz1WqfaBCJw,0,0,2,SeSjXJMgy0coo_ZmL34Pzg

The hot salsa is actually hot, which I like. The rating is compared to their competitors, Robertos and Don Tortaco would get 3 stars",udDk0WyB7z4RqnJdo-dUAg,1,1,5,9YxOWITQcMSoZ8APbsAF8g

Inside a convenience store at a gas station, this place was busy when I arrived. It's basically a one man show. The guy took orders and cooked and did it all in a very efficient way. The wait wasn't long for my chicken nachos and he was so accommodating. He wanted to make sure everything was as I wanted it. He fried the chips up fresh, which was a treat. The chile was nice and spicy as well. They have mild as well, if you prefer. The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but a few pieces of carne asada snuck their way into my nachos and they were very moist and flavorful. I'll be getting that next time I come in. 

Service was friendly and I look forward to trying more of their menu out soon. I wish they had a drive thru since this location tends to get pretty crowded with the gas station, convenience store and car wash all in one area. Still a great little spot for cheap and fresh Mexican fare. Just make sure you come during off hours to avoid a long line.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,4,9y8_MRXviAGA9-s_xSM2nQ
