I called dennys at 3:07 this morning and Acarei took my order, 3 moons over my hammy, egg whites, turkey instead of ham, no cheese on one, add avocado and mushrooms to all sandwiches, HASHBROWNS for all and 2 orders of fruit. She asked if I'd been to this dennys before because they don't have mushrooms at this dennys, I said yes you do, I always order from this location with Joe and ruby I'm a regular here. She states she's been working here for 7 months and doesn't think they have mushrooms, then she states she cannot find the mushroom add on button. She finally finds it.... I arrive at the restaurant, My food finally comes out after 20 minutes. I always double check my food, there was no egg whites on any of the sandwiches, and no avocado! The girl proceeded to roll her eyes at me and take the food and slam it into the garbage! I asked for a refund when I witnessed her horrible attitude! I worked all day and just finished moving, I don't need attitude from anyone who's helping prepare my food. This person had no idea how to do a CASH REFUND(give the money back duh)she had to call and wake the manager up(there was no manager or supervisor there on duty)from his sleep and he had to walk her through step by step on how to do a refund!

A few of those issues included: Cold food (which I noticed was mentioned in other reviews so this Dennys must think it's acceptable), running out of our drinks and not having them refilled a single time during our meal, and having our order messed up.

I don't know why the waitresses wouldn't seat me. My friend and I always tip well. That's like $10-11 extra an hour she could make on a non-alcoholic meal.

After a moment I realized she really wanted us to wait there for a full minute. I looked around and grabbed a highchair from the sidewall.

     I ordered the cinnamon pancake breakfast and the server suggested that I get half bacon and half sausage since I wasn't sure which one to choose. My girlfriend ordered the nachos and our daughter got the dinosaur chicken nuggets. When the food came, there was one strip of thin bacon and one very small sausage link. I asked the girl why she suggested getting half and half if the serving size was only two to begin with. She had no answer at all except ""That is how it comes"". The meat was room temperature (I assume it sat around waiting because the cook forgot to drop the chicken nuggets). The pancakes were horrible. They tasted like they were made with too much egg and had a texture of an omelet more than a pancake. The nachos and nuggets came out OK.

     It was time to go and the same female manager cashed us out. She informed me that the bill was 31 dollars and I said ""That doesn't sound right"". Without any inquiry she printed out an itemized check, handed it to me and aggressively said ""I don't know, you tell me"". She shifted back and forth and her body language was telling me to hurry up. That is just ridiculous. I don't know if the check was right or not. We payed the bill and got out of there. That was enough for me to know that our business is not appreciated. With all the options on Eastern, there is no need to give this Denny's another chance.",m1-HNN4pghUqDIKr2FUcmw,0,0,1,vTPRIf-yY4U27YVjNE-5yA

Just like last Sunday, Jerry J. and I were on the prowl  last night (7/31/11) for some food to celebrate having one whole day this week, off from work today (Monday.) After driving home from work and getting picked up, Jerry suggested that we drive down by where he lives (Sunset Station) rather than by where I live (GVR) - there was nothing open, the cafe inside of Sunset was closed until 6 AM for cleaning and for whatever reason, Jerry doesn't think it's okay to take girls to bars for a proper meal. The only option was Denny's or IHOP over there and he said he didn't care for either, so we drove back up to GVR. Everything was closed there, so we ended up at Denny's on Eastern. Eff. We drove around for an hour for nothing!

The place was pretty dead at a little after midnight. There was only two tables that had people at them. We got the menus and... Jerry said nothing was jumping out to him. I'm not a big fan of Denny's - their food isn't very good anymore, so I agreed. They have some new menu out that has ""regional"" dishes and I was really eyeing the shrimp and grits. All of the sudden, common sense took over as I pondered how good the quality of seafood, at a Denny's, in a desert would be, and that the grits probably were of the instant variety. The waitress had to check on us three times before we were ready to order because we were too busy chatting to look over our menu. Good thing she was patient with us. When it was time, Jerry ordered a burger and fries, and I settled on the peach french toast, with two sunny side eggs, 2 sausage links and hash browns for $5.99 

The food came out quickly. My toast, and what I think were canned peaches, were a little black on the edges, but it was okay. The eggs were not good - they had a thick, congealed, clear layer on top - something I've never seen on eggs I've made sunny side up at home. They weren't good quality and they tasted...not good. You can tell the quality of an egg - the better the quality, the more orange the yolk. Of course, quality eggs come from chickens that were fed bugs and worms and quality feed and were allowed to scratch around outside. These yolks were highlighter-yellow and tasteless. Poor chickens.  

I don't think Jerry was that impressed with his food. The meal was pretty blah for both of us, but we were there over an hour. The waitress was good, but that's about it. Skip this place and just go to the grocery store if you need food on a late Sunday night because Denny's won't hit the spot.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,1,2,k6EZH6O522jhZvSdzc4hRg

Stood there for more than 10 minutes before anyone would acknowledged me.  Then when they found out it was for pick up, they started sitting the dine in customers who came in after me again and again before I had to stop them and said ""hey, I don't have all day.  The food is sitting right there behind you."" We won't be coming back to this place.",s67-vzUEE2J4YCbqDQW6AQ,1,0,1,G6btZ_PnxcCNmBs2yOdZ9w

I never got his name, but he was a very old man. He was rude from the start of asking how many we were. We were trying to pay and then he just continued to give the worse attitude to everyone he spoke to. He deserves to be gone with his represents the place.",HDKcORG0fkDq4jTl4E7kqw,0,0,1,DNkwdEXQyKBhvSv_4YYsWg

I always order the waffle and it normally comes out cold and is served with cold syrup but Mary's cheerful personality kept me coming back anyways. This last time, Sunday, November 16, 2014, we sat at the counter and seemed like an inconvenience to our waitress the entire breakfast. There is nothing worse than feeling like you are not worthy of someone's time. I understand that turning over tables is important but it's also important to ensure your guests are satisfied. Couldn't get our waters refilled quickly, food came out cold, waitress was impersonal and the cashier was awfully rude as well. I'd recommend sunrise cafe or protein house instead.",9KedzFFaQSK06pl25KcjhQ,1,0,1,zc6d-7ICgIB9QmSllHxBYQ

Love going here especially because it's never really busy (when you go any time besides breakfast) and even then sometimes breakfast isn't too busy. It's cheap food, so you shouldn't expect much out of it, but to get good tasting cheap meals. I love getting the French toast. Good service, plenty of tables, I've got no complaints here.

The waiters are nice, especially the sharp-looking guy with the half-silver tooth, and both of the night-time managers I've met have been friendly (a lady, and a younger guy). I go to a lot of Denny's, and I think the staff here is friendlier than most.

Food has always been good as well. I, nor my date have ever had any issues with the food.",NRB8xfZFzc5KFlKUEzIzWA,1,2,5,gy2yh496exCELrc2yFm7ng
