I have had almost every combination of sandwhich possible. They are just number one for me and my fiance, he proposed  on our 2nd anniversary there we go every year  for our little memorable meal together!!!!!

I should also note that my previous Yelp review of Pop's had been requested from Pop's! For a reward of  'FREE french fries' in which they did accept but that's just like cheating in my opinion. Where's the yelping officials on this one?

After working on the pops cheese steak truck for one day I realized this is not a steak and cheese at all. It's frozen meat ""NOT FRESH"" and they precook lots of that frozen meat and let it sit in water until ready to reheat for you to eat.  sound good I think not. 

I won't get started on the sanitation of this place, pop's and pop's cheese steak truck must have it easy with the heatlh department because I don't even think he has soap on the truck for washing hands. 

If I were you and looking for a steak and cheese I would look up other alternatives like some of these new food trucks around town like the ""Yellow Lunch Box Truck"" or ""Food Slingers"" in which they both serve fresh meat and it's even fresh rib eye. For a lower price as well.

Jimmy on south street ...Tony lukes.... so I know a thing or two about a good cheesesteak.

The meat on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 6.
.they don't use fresh rib eye meat. They give a generous portion. They could put more cheese on there steak sandwiches... All in all its a decent philly chesesteak.  The grill isn't to clean and I often worry about how long the meat is kept warm in that pan...they cook the meat in advance and it lays in a pan of hot water for who knows how long. The employees are friendly.

Went there with high expectations because any place that claims to have Philly Cheesesteak better know how to make a Philly Cheesesteak.  Not here.  Being a native Pennsylvanian and growing up on REAL Philly Cheesesteaks, this was a big disappointment.  Meat was not cooked to order on the grill, instead, probably cooked the night before( or worse) , put in a big pot and then simply re-heated on the grill when orders placed.  This process allows meat to sit in its own juice making the bread extra soggy.  So soggy that you can't pick up the sandwich with your hands.  He gives you a fork to eat it.  WHAT??  The meat had absolutely no flavor, very bland and chewy.  There is a reason that people stand in line in Philly to get a real sandwich and they don't mind the long wait because they know it will be the real deal.  Pulling meat out of a pot is not acceptable to call yourself a Philly Cheesesteak.  For all those leaving good reviews, well, I guess if you haven't had a real one, you just don't know any better.",uaaX5u7cpiQimXL9rWFuBA,3,0,2,7H7mQEX7QcC1B8_61HYtlQ

We both had the Philly wit cheez whiz an mushrooms and onions. The meat is cooked and sitting in jus,  after u order cook puts meat on flat top w your toppings then put in bread they bring in from Philly . The meat is juicy and tasty, bread is soft and chewy. Liked the cheez whizz , onion and mushroom combination . The sandwich was extremely hot had to wait a couple mins to let it cool. We also ordered fries and fried okra. Fries and okra were made to order , the okra was the frozen stuff served with ranch, it was good not great same as the fries. I think I like capriottis cheese steaks a little better, but would come here because they serve fries :) and have more sides then just chips.   Our two phillys , fries and okra came out to $25, which is not cheap  , I'm glad I read the reviews on yelp , which said it was a little spendy, that's y we stopped by 7 eleven and bought a double big gulp for a couple bucks, saved a little there , I think I'll make it a quick tip . They also have hoagies  .  I will back to try the other menu items. I luv a sandwich shop that serves fries.",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,1,0,3,5y_reTJNeHdVaOzsWh6JFA

845701,2017-06-16,0,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"I've been coming here for years, but just now getting around to writing a review.

So I'm a West Coast guy, and while I've been to Philly and had a few ""Originals"", I'm hardly an expert on what would be considered a Classic, or Real Philly. I do, however, know what I love, and Pop's is it. I've had Cheesesteaks in so many states, plus a few countries, and each and every time, I can honestly say, ""Wish it was Pop's."" Seriously, it was this place and Carl's Jr. that I was always fiending for in the sandbox.

Personally, I get the Steak, Provolone, Onions and Mushrooms, plus Sweet and Hot peppers.

The fried green beans are kickass. Their sodas are imports as well as their desserts, Tasty Kake brand. The Black Cherry soda is perfect, but unfortunately expensive because they get it from (I'm assuming) Philly. Tasty Kake Butterscotch is my favorite, although some will probably just compare it to normal packaged bakery stuff, it seems higher quality to me. It's all still packaged sugary baked goods though.

This place is also open 24/7. These poor sods are there to provide losers like myself a Philly on Christmas or Thanksgiving at any time of the night.

If you don't carry cash and want to tip, you have to tell them before they run your card because they can't add anything once you've signed. Has to be done where they add it to your total. Some weird system, I dunno.

The seating is outdoors only, and for some reason the corner there is a vortex of whirlwind. Seriously though... it can be hot as heck outside and you go stand there on the corner at Pop's and the wind is blowing 70 MPH and all of a sudden you're freezing. It's really strange. 

The seats are not comfortable, but then, you didn't go to Pop's to sit on the corner of a busy intersection and suck exhaust while eating fried everything with extra cheese Whiz and ranch because of the padding in the chairs. Most likely you're providing the padding yourself.

Parking sucks, I think they offer a grand total of maybe 9 spaces, at an angle, and if you can get out the one way drive through portion of the oddly built building, then you're pretty much stuck heading east on Alta. Turning around when the lot is empty isn't tough, but when it's packed it can be challenging if you're not a great driver. I seriously feel the need to specify the great driver part because we are in Vegas and I drive around town for a living, and Vegas drivers suck in general compared to most other places.",mjbTKcJyynlmqOH-EuBY4Q,0,0,5,qZFua9QlZiCdN5J-Sw9f_g

After reading all the positive yelps and testimonials on Pop's website, I was expecting a fun and delicious experience.  I imagined myself giving my order to a gruff but charming grill master, who would ask me 'wit' onions? in an authentic Philly accent.  What I really got was a grill master who was just gruff and apparently couldn't hear my order, because when I got my cheese steak home, there were no onions on it at all!   

Ok, the cheese steak itself:  the meat was not fatty or greasy, but slightly bland.  I enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was very good.  I think if they had included the onions, things would have been tastier.  Also, in the hours since eating the steak, I have been a bit 'indisposed', but this in and of itself has never been an index of whether I would return to a place if the food tastes good.  (masochist!)

892413,2013-07-10,0,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"Once upon a time, this place was a Straight From Philly Steakout. (Then again, once upon a time it was a Weinerschnitzel & then it was a Weanie Bender, but that's beside the point. :-D ) When it turned into Pop's, I wanted it to be as good as Philly Steakout, which I miss terribly. They largely kept the same menu, after all. However it is not quite as good. 
Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty decent. I still come here from time to time. And of course, middle of the night dining options are always good. However, the phillys aren't quite as tasty as their predecessor's. It seems like maybe they really love oregano. A lot. Like, really a lot. That appears to be the main flavoring that they use to distinguish themselves from other philly joints. Chicken phillys are better, not so over seasoned. I really want to love the cheese fries, but at least when I go there in the evenings the old, old fries are just thrown back in the fryer for you. Now I know that some places double-fry their fries. However, if you double-fry really old fries, you just get nasty over cooked & over greased fries. It's a consistent thing here. Perhaps during the daytime I'd have better luck w/ the fries. 
Also, I've witnessed several times where people will go from money handling to directly touching food. Not a cool thing. Soo, yeah. Not terrible, but just ok.",5CmusjjrPimBu2HsM2mI9g,1,0,3,_J9orNMmjtPIXre_gwvMxA

Plenty of meat, nice chewy bread, and a healthy (or not) helping of cheese on each. The fries were kind of mushy, but they served their purpose. Next time we'll try the fried okra. (They also have fried mushrooms, sweet potato fries, and a few other sides that didn't appeal to me.)

If you take a trip to the A-frame building, know your protocol before stepping up to the window: Order on the left, watch the guy make your food, then pay on the right. There's a small outdoor dining area if you want to breathe in the smells of fried onions and exhaust fumes from passing cars. Otherwise, do what we do: Take your cheesesteaks home, where you can enjoy them with a nice cold beverage of your choosing.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,3,1,4,-4SGp27Xixv3GR60dVu_mg

When it comes to sandwiches though, the bread is as essential as what is inside of it, and just like many other similar sandwich places, the bread is very average, if does not scream fresh, especially for a place that serves nothing but sandwiches. I am not saying it is not fresh, just that it is very plain with the same doughy substance as the bread you buy from your supermarket that has been sitting there for a couple of days with an expiration date on the bag. When a place serves sandwiches, it is imperative that the bread is amazing, after all it is the first thing that will enter your mouth and determines the substance of every bite and chew. They meats are good, but nothing that screams amazing; I think people are attracted to it because of the locale and the length of time it has been there, and it would be nice to compliment it with the best of everything; after all for what you pay, investing a few more pennies on good bread is a small price to pay in cost to give the customer a true value for what you would expect from such an old fixture in Vegas... I have not tried anything else on the menu, but with a place called ""Philly Steaks"", that is the only item on the menu you need to try....",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,0,0,2,0ta-Ishm93Fdlvw-6qZL6w

I ate a full cheese steak, an entire order of fried mushrooms, and then half an order of their fried banana bites (oh man, how I dream of those golden mouthfuls of deliciousness). Everything was absolutely killer, so much so that despite being stuffed, I was tempted to go back for another sandwich, you know, ""for later."" I was in love.

One housebound night several weeks later, I was hit with a cheese steak craving. I ordered in from the highest rated delivery place I could find and was promptly let down.  Don't get me wrong, it was okay, but nothing more. Since then I've tried half a dozen sandwiches from as many restaurants and as it turns out, I don't crave cheese steaks; I crave Pop's. They set the bar high and ruined me for other places.

Beyond the food quality, the atmosphere is great. Open outdoor seating makes a great place to bring a casual date or good friends. It's fun and comfortable, with great service.

Alright you'll want to go here when the weather is cooler and not during the main eating hours as you have to stand in a very long, long, long line and then wait for a place to sit and open up and that's not easy when you're carrying a brown bag full of sandwiches and cheesy whiz fries and drinks. The menu is simple and you can top your Philly with anything you like and watch the staff cook it right in front of you through their walk up windows.

Didn't add anything complicated with the sandwich except have onions, peppers and cheese on it and that was enough. The steak was lean, nicely cooked and all the toppings fresh and the cheese melted just right. It's a mouthful of a sandwich but def worth the wait and standing in line.

Little tip, at night this area can be considered a little sketchy, remember you are eating outside near a very busy main thoroughfare in a corner location and that there are on occasion homeless people wandering and begging for food.

I ordered a Whiz w/ onions and extra cheese. The sandwich with free whiz fries was almost ten bucks, not bad. My sandwich was  good but some of the meat was cooked a tad too long. The whiz fries were good as always. 

There is no place to eat inside here... Just a walk up window and the tables and chairs on the patio and no drive thru. I kind of like it like that.

1673266,2014-03-10,0,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"I'm not known for being a cheese steak fan, but I do love cheese. Add in that this place is about a mile from home for me, and that it's 24 hours, and it's pretty much kismet that I would finally come here and actually really like it.

First off, its a bit  pricier than expected: spent $25 on dinner for me and the BF.
As others have said though, the sandwiches are beyond huge enough to share.  We got the #32 peppers and onions cheesesteak with provolone ($11), added on sides of chili cheese fries ($4) and an order of wings (10 for $8), and a Franks black cherry soda ($2).  For the price, the sandwich and wings were good portions. I didn't think the same thing about the soda or fries though- but then again, I'm not a soda person in the first place, though I understand this brand is apparently something special.

The sandwich itself, in addition to being huge, was stuffed full of meat and veggies. The cheese was a little light for my liking, and it was slightly on the dry side toward the ends of the sandwich, but it was good. In the future, I'd probably stick to the mushroom one though.
The chili cheese fries were fairly standard and a smaller portion than I expected but we still devoured them in record time. The wings, though, were a surprise. I ordered the mild ones rather than hot, and still found these to be surprisingly spicy. I'd definitely hesitate before ordering their ""flamin'"" style, I can't imagine how much hotter they must get. Portion was good for the price, wings were an average size without being too small or overly fried or breaded. Huge portion of ranch for dipping. I liked how easily the meat came off the bone, too. A little less messy than usual. 

We ate at the patio area, and it was noisy and difficult to carry on conversation, as others have said. However, it wasn't a total turn off and in fact kind of added to the experience. I'll have to come back and try the sweet potato fries...and the breakfast sandwiches... maybe I'll add the Whiz next time, too.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,3,Dnv_52NdrUy_NQGbAqeKog

Fries: the fatter type when you can actually taste the potato! Must have with their cheese steaks!

really how much less would you make on your 12 dollar shitty sammich if you used real shaved beef not frozen industrial steakem meat and the proper amount of cheese?  a dollar less maybe 50 cents? 

there is no way I would ever eat here again, so I guess getting 17 bucks out of me for fries a sandwhich and a dr pepeer was a good idea. and I guess if you really want cheese on your CHEESE STEAK  you better get the double order which would be the regular amount of cheese ANYWHERE ELSE THAT CLAIMED TO MAKE CHEESE STEAKS IN THE WORLD, WHICH THESE ARE NOT.  there are shitty imitation made with some steakem type material.  oh I said that already.

The Steak:

Pop's is okay. I ordered the traditional with the whiz and onion. It was fresh. The bread was soft, but it wasn't anything to write home about. You can honestly buy meat from the butcher near the Meadows mall, and recreate something just as tasty yourself.

The Italian ""ice"":

The did have variety on sides you can get cheez wheels, deep fried zucchini and deep fried okra. The side of sweet potato fries I ate wasn't bad at all, had good crunch (the number one thing I look for in a fry) and natural sweet potato flavor. The flavor was enhanced even further with this syrup dipping sauce that had a hint of cinnamon. =) 

I don't get how people can eat Cheez Whiz it's so processed it can't even be called cheese! I just didn't grow up with it, but apparently it's THE topping to get for Philly Cheesesteaks. You can even get a side of fries slathered with it here.

Both, my husband and I, decided on the #2 Cheese Whiz Steak  w/grilled onions (the onions don't automatically come with, so be sure to ask for them), and an order of fried okra and onion rings. 

Cheesesteaks: The bread was nice and soft and held up well to the decent amount of filling. The meat, on the other hand, was kind of dry and lacking in flavor - it needed some seasoning. 

Fried okra and onion rings: They were both perfectly fried and not too greasy, but they're the frozen stuff that you get at the store.

I came here with my boyfriend a few nights ago to try it out. There was nobody there except for one worker who was cleaning up the eating area.

We walked over to the menu to figure out what we wanted. We decided to get the #32 (mushroom/bell peppers/steak/cheese) to share with a side of chili cheese fries. I liked that you could watch the person making your food for you, there was even a sign that invited you to do so. The guy made our order pretty quickly and we took a seat at one of the high tables. 

First we tried the chili cheese fries, which was delicious. I love cheese whiz! Then we both took half of the cheesesteak and began eating. I knew it was Bomb after the first bite. It tasted even better after I stuffed some chili cheese fries in it! Yes, I know that sounds unhealthy, but I don't care! lol.

All in all, this place was good. The worker could've been more engaging though. He didn't talk or smile at all, which made us not want to go back to the counter to order dessert. We just felt like we were bothering him or something, even thought there was no one else there.

3088465,2012-12-24,3,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"The most legitimately Philidelphian Cheesesteak Joint in Las Vegas.

The way they select the meats for their sandwiches is superb. Fat and stringy beef, just like the ones in the East Coast when I was a child. When you chew your bites, the meat sort of falls apart and melts in your mouth. I have spent years trying to find the ""right cheesesteak"" in Nevada and California for ages. 

The problem I noticed when it comes to ordering a cheesesteak in any place is not Philidelphia is that the establishment can't get the ingredients right. They usually love to bastardize the recipe with their ""lean, organic, and fat free"" ingredients that fuck up every aspect of the experience, the taste, texture, and even the look. I couldn't believe how many people can bungle a SIMPLE recipe of melt-in-your-mouth CHEESE... and steak. 

A proper cheesesteak is a sloppy and messy one. Sort of like a Sloppy Joe, but cheesy. Its where the wrapping paper still has bits of that ""cheese paper"" still encrusted and stuck to the sides after you are done and you feel like you want to lick it off your fingers and the trash. Cheesesteaks should have a pungent, cheesy, and greasy odor that alerts the entire block within the vicinity of your possession of a good cheesesteak. 

And many restaurants couldn't even get the basic concept of it right. I was about to give up in frustration until I looked online and found this place on Yelp. My first impression was, ""You guys are full of shit"", but I had extra money on me so I ordered a classic cheesesteak with fried okra. 

After the first bite, I went into a epileptic seizure where I relived my best moments as a 6 year old, experiencing authentic Philly Cheesesteak for the first time as a kid. From what I was told by the hospital staff, the cooks found me lying on the sidewalk with yellow cheesy saliva foaming on the edges of my mouth, and paramedics picked me up to drop me off at Sunrise Hospital.

3203621,2012-02-07,15,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"In the worst of times people often think of the best of times.  Rex is no exception.  Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but ""The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora"", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said ""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.

Pops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!

Apologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of ""Happy Serum"" to get up right again...what is ""Happy Serum"" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. 

Anyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.

Lastly...the ""Philly"" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.  

Here is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops.

Unfortunately, the last 2 times I've eaten here the food has been complete slop.  Granted, both times have been late night excursions, but being a 24 hour business that shouldn't make a difference.   Few weeks  back I grabbed an Italian sausage sandwich with peppers and it was an abomination.  The entire sandwich was drenched in something resembling marinara sauce but it had very little flavor and was so messy you couldn't even really call it a sandwich anymore.  Tonight, I got a philly (their claim to fame) and once again it was just complete slop.  The bread doesn't taste toasted, the meat has very little flavor, very few peppers and slimy canned mushrooms.  Worse, they just dump a ton of Cheez Whiz on it and expect that to make up for the utter lack of taste.  Pretty sure this will be my last time, but I will give them props for variety and business hours.

Place is small but quite busy. They seem to be able to handle it with no problem. Cashier was friendly and so were the cooks. The cooks also take your order to help speed it up which helps.

So since I'm from the East coast all Phillys come with CHEESE WIZ. I was beyond excited to finally try a place in vegas with Cheese Whiz. I ordered fries and a philly with onions and peppers and I specifically said CHEESE WHIZ, because I was so excited.

Going off the trust system I didn't watch them make it and told them to go even though I was eating it there. I get to my table and my sandwich has PROVOLONE :( :( :( :( I asked for cheese whiz.
My partner saw I was upset and asked me if I wanted him to go get it fixed. Since I work in restaurants I never complain and just take it. Plus the line was long again and knew it would take forever honestly and I waited long enough for this one in the first place. I was excited for my partner to try it too.

I only want to go back because I want to actually have what I ordered. Next time write down the orders. This could have been avoided if you had tickets to go off of and not memory. Remember that.

Pop's is pretty hard to miss. The giant triangular building has been serving up Philly's 24/7 for years now and has become a local favorite. Pop's exudes that hole in the wall atmosphere and really belongs on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. Yes the Ben Franklin mural has seen better days but for me this mildly grimey look just adds to the experience. There is no in door seating just the outdoor patio so dress accordingly. They menu is pretty big, tons of philly variations along with plenty of deep friend snacks and TastyKakes (you get a free one on your birthday!)

I am sure the guys here can produce a edible work of art with the cheez wiz but I was a little disappointed in what I got. My bacon philly and a bottle of water came out to twelve bucks; for the price I expected more. The philly was surprisingly dry and lacking flavor. Normally adding bacon to any dish is an improvement but here it just added a rubbery textured ingredient to otherwise soft sandwich. The hoagie looked great at first but became soggy and fell apart as it soaked up the grease. I've heard rumors that the place was sold a few years back had hasn't been the same since.

I love that they have ""wise"" chips as well.

My husband can eat a whole sandwich and be satisfied I personally can only eat half then save the other half for later it is well worth the money. This last visit was nice because there was no line! Sometimes there is a line but it moves real quick. 

I recommend it to anybody that loves cheese steaks and all who think they don't.
It is on a old school original A-frame wiener schnitzel and if it is your first time you can drive through the middle of the ""A"" but don't think there is a drive-thru to order food it is simply a place to get you back on the road you must park in the lot and walk up to the window.

The ""Mozzarella Sticks"" and ""Cheese Whiz Fries"" are super yummy.

3542878,2012-10-14,1,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"Ok, so im from philly. So this review is for you transplants who may want to consider eating here. 

If you grew up in or around philly (im from lower bucks), you know how a cheesesteaks supposed to be made. 
The guys are supposed to take your order,  grill up the meat, grill the onions& peppers alongside the meat, add the cheese and hash it all together with a spatula. Then its supposed to be served on a foot long (aka 18"") hoagie roll. 

Pops did it a bit differently. The meat & veggies were precooked and sitting to the side of the grill. The cook took a scoop of each and put them on the grill, stirred them up a bit, and added my cheese. Then he took a roll, opened it and put it on top, scooping it up so that the cheese was only on the bottom of the roll. 

The taste was still pretty authentic, but i wish id gotten mine fresh. 

The ""restaurant"" itself was similar in feel to an old-time drive in restaurant, except it did have a covered patio with 6 or 7 tables. Very dive-y. I liked it. 

In conclusion, this was a perfect spot for a post-drive in movie date (10 minutes away on rancho), fun, and a decent cheesesteak, at least for vegas.

I've lived in the Philadelphia area my entire life. I've eaten cheesesteaks at several different places, so I like to think I know what I'm talking about. I was looking forward to trying Pops, as many people have said they're the most authentic in the city.

Well, they tried too, but unfortunately, it wasn't the experience I'm used to from Philly. The meat wasn't browned enough. The roll was somehow too soft, which is weird because they use the same Amoroso rolls that are used in Philly. And then the whiz.... they poured it on top of the meat. Travesty, I tell you. In Philly, they mix it in with the meat so that you have an equal bite of cheese to meat. I honestly didn't think it'd make much of a difference, but i had a ton of cheese in the bites I took from the top of the sandwich, and no cheese on the bottom of the sandwich. 

They did have tastykakes though. That made me pretty happy. I also like how they're open 24 hours a day. I'll have to try one of their breakfast hoagies (incorrectly named by Pops as ""Breakfast Phillys"".... honestly, if you go into a sandwich shop in philly and ask for anything called  ""philly"", they will not know what you're talking about).

Ordering is through a screen on the left side, pay on the right side window, and pick up there also.  I ordered the #32, a cheesesteak with peppers and mushrooms.  The cook asks if you want onions and I got them, too.  I also ordered some fries and a diet Coke.

All seating is on the patio.  Keep that in mind when it's in the cold months or in the middle of summer when it's 100 degrees at 9 PM.

My sandwich was tasty and it was OK.  I should have ordered extra cheese because that was the only thing I found lacking.  When I make cheesesteaks at home, I always load up on the cheese.  The roll was great.  Very fresh.  The fries were pretty standard.

I did notice that they have other foods they deep fry including Oreo pieces for deep frying.  I might need to stop here for a dessert some evening before it gets to be the hot days of summer.

I suppose Pop's is a bit of an institution here in LV, probably one of the oldest places here where you can get a Philly cheese steak.  Hard to believe that I work less than 5 minutes away from here!  I can now come here whenever I want for some steak!

I probably would have given a 4 star if I had just stuck with their mantra...any of their famous steak sandwiches.  Possibly some fries.  We kinda did a detour by ordering things you wouldn't ordinarily get at a Philly cheese steak place so that took it down a notch.

Came here on a late night (probably the best times for one of these) and wouldn't you know, Pop's was hoppin'.  Parking lot was full!  We had no problem waiting in line though, goes pretty quick.  Wifey and I ordered:

*#4 - Provolone Cheese Steak ($9.99)
*#35 - Pork Bar-B-Que ($9.99)
*Fried Okra ($3.95)

But of course, best thing we had was the Provolone Cheese Steak!  Roll was light but still fresh tasting, there was a lot of meat & cheese in this sucker!  Oiliness galore!  Just like it probably should be.  Fat = FLAVOR!  Meat was seasoned well and was the focus of the sandwich.  Basically meat, cheese, bread.  Pretty damn delicious cheese steak.

Took away a star though for the rest of our order.  The Pork Bar-B-Que sandwich they said is an award winner but I just didn't like it that much.  The pork was overly stringy, but the sauce?  It was wayyyyy too sweet!  Like almost sickly sweet!  I was looking for more tang or bite to the sauce.  But the sweet was just too overpowering.  Really not on my want list.

The fried okra was OK, it was just really fried okra.  A little bland but fried fresh, could have used a bit more seasoning.  Plus it didn't really go well with our sandwiches so it was kind of forgettable.

Prices are fairly reasonable, but man paying nearly $10 for a sandwich gets to me for some reason - I guess it's because we have so much cheap food in town.  I mean come on, I can go downtown to get a prime rib dinner with sides, salad bar & dessert for the same price!  But thankfully Pop's cheese steak is tasty.

I'll be a regular at Pop's especially during my lunch days at work.  But I'll just go for a steak sandwich from now on!

4147034,2018-03-03,0,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"First time out to Pop's today. I wish it wasn't so windy. There is no inside dining area. Just tables and stools under a roof right off of noisy Decatur Blvd. Not the best ambience but cool atmosphere. All kinds of retro feels with the A-frame and the 50s style diner stools. Little old roadside stops like this are a piece of Americana. I was reminded of the legendary Pink's Hot Dogs in LA. Pop's may not have quite that legendary status but that doesn't mean the food isn't great. It most certainly is.

I ordered a #32 which has fresh mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, beef and choice of cheese. I chose cheese whiz. That is the way to go. I also ordered fried mushrooms because of my well documented love of the fungi and a Dr. Brown's root beer.

I was struck by the smells emminating from behind the cage today. I was already hungry when I ordered. Had I not been hungry the smell of the steak cooking would have gotten me there. I could hardly wait for my sandwich. Then I saw another persons order being wrapped. I was drooling by this point. I needed my food!

My sandwich was ready first. The order of mushrooms did not seem to be communicated from the cook to the cashier. They were ready in just a couple of minutes. No harm. No foul. Both sandwich and shrooms were piping hot which was nice considering I had to eat outside on a cool windy day. That will warm you throug and through. 

But its those first bites which warm your soul. The salty beef, sweet peppers and onions, earthy mushrooms and funky orange cheese whiz harmonize so beautifully. The roll is just sturdy enough to contain all the excitement without being over bearing. The ratio of filling to bread is spot on. 

The same is true for the fried mushrooms. Whole meaty shrooms and a few stems lightly breaded and fried golden brown. Not too bready. Just enough to keep it crisp. Served with a cup of ranch dressing. To me, a little ranch goes a long way. It wasn't a necessary condiment but welcomed to the party in my mouth.

The food was awesome today at Pop's. Service was friendly but seemed disjointed. From my order of fried mushrooms not being readily recognized to the delays in being rung up as the cashier was also working the fryer. It took a while all around from standing in what seemed like a short line, to paying and to receiving my order. And for the life of me I could not find napkins anywhere. At a place that serves one of the messiest sandwiches known to man you would think there would be napkins at the tables, at the order counter, in the bag. But no. No such luck. I resorted to licking my fingers. Sssshhhh, don't tell my mom. I still have cheese beneath my nails. Crazy. But I'll be back. Mark my words.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,1,4,mqNsO1KWKrl-NdtNV0DBHA

Both times I got the mushroom, pepper and onion philly.Juicey, cheesy and big! Room mate got the pastrami both times as well. Another big juicy sandwich. I normally don't like pastrami minus a place in Cali name The Hat! Stole a bite to try it and may actually get it next time. We have had the fried green beans , yummy with a thick ranch sauce. The sweet potato fries with some sort of coconut dipping sauce. They should be considered a sin. So sweet and yummy. Whole reason I went back a second time was to have my friend try them with a to go order.

Also had the banana fosters bites. First one was yummy second one was ok, third one I only had the half of before I stopped eating it. Tasted like warm banana pudding with a soggy graham cracker crust and deep fried with a thin batter. Think they were store bought  rather then made on location. A good thing to try in a group but I won't be ordering them again for just me.  

Prices are good for the amount of food you get. Main and pretty much only draw back I can think of is no indoor seating. Definitely going back more in the summer . Right on the street and fun to watch passing traffic but in the winter its a bit to cold.

UPDATE:  after reading a message from someone at this establishment who was unhappy with my review, I likely WON'T give it a second try. Seriously, for you to say your demographic isn't children which is why you don't serve any kid friendly food is ridiculous! You are not a bar or a club, if you were I'd totally understand and would not have even mentioned lack of kids menu.

I got the Bacon and Swiss Cheese steak.  Everything should be better with bacon, right?  Not in this case, the bacon didn't add much flavor, and the swiss was definitely a mistake.  A good cheese steak always comes with whiz.  Provolone is acceptable but if you really want the flavor, the whiz is where it's at.  The steak itself was sliced perfectly and was melt in your mouth, except it lacked a flavor.  The sandwiches were nice sized for what you pay, but overall for someone who is just a Philly Steak place, it was a bit of a letdown.

Some say the cheese steak is bland but that's because there isn't as much salt like other places which can really alter the flavor/taste of the cheesesteak., so if your lookin out to have more foods with less salt then I recommend this place.

I don't think the drive through actually works to get your order, I mean I went to POP's like 33 times and it doesn't look like they actually take orders in the drive through, if they did, i'd probably give POP's another star.",kgtBZKbNTQrGMDPog3ASdg,2,2,3,4UKpar4S96dQPF9ok0U1Ew

It was pretty busy that night and I waited for a good 20-30 mins before they took my order. 

We tried the peppers & mushroom cheesesteak and the cheese whiz cheesesteak. Also two orders of whiz fries. 

We split the cheesesteaks in half so we can try both. I tried half of the peppers & mushroom and half of the cheese whiz. Peppers & mushrooms is really good, I recommend 8/10! Great amount of filling inside and bread was so good. All it needed was a bit of salt imo. The cheese whiz is really cheesy and good, but a bit too salty for me, 6/10. It can get messy because of the cheese. 
Cheese whiz fries were bomb dot com!! 10/10

After paying, if you like hot sauce, make sure to ask the cashier for hot sauce because that stuff is amazing. I have a feeling it could be a hot sauce from a bottled sauce we know, but cant pinpoint which one. Either way, taste great in the cheesesteak & with the fries!

4798010,2013-11-13,0,1SqLPgnZEVeVYDM-AuoFhg,"Some background: I have lived in and around Philly for 29 years, and just moved to Las Vegas in July. I used to live down Passyunk from Pat's and Geno's, and for the last 4 years I lived near the Dalessandro's (the real king of Philly steaks). Soooo I think I am fairly qualified to give this review.

After finding out that Pop's was a short drive from my office, I decided to head down there to devour thousands of delicious calories in one sitting. I wish I saved those calories for something better. What a disappointment!! 

I asked for my go-to, a cheesesteak hoagie (typically it's steak, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion). He told me mayo was included, and I told him no mayo please. After waiting 5 minutes for my steak, I get it in a paper bowl thing with a fork stuck on top. Never saw that before... Sat down, pulled apart my steak to put ketchup in there, and I realized the thing is slathered in mayo. NASTY. Brought my steak back to the counter, told the woman at the register about the mistake, and they made me another. I had to get this to go since I needed to be back at work. Back at my office, I take a bite of my steak and there is some kind of vinegar flavoring in the hoagie. I don't know if the onions were cooked in it or if the guy thought this would be good or if was just suffering from temporary insanity.... Ugh. I ate it, but only because I paid $14 with a drink and chips. 

First, the prices were a little much for what you're getting. My cheesesteak hoagie was $10. I used to pay $8 at Dalessandro's. It's $6.50 at Dalessandro's for a plain steak and it's $8 at Pop's. The quality was a 2 star compared to Dalessandro's 5 star, so confused on the mark up of price. Maybe because the rolls are shipped from Amaroso's? 

If you've never had a Philly steak, I can see why you might like these. If you have experienced the best of the best, you will walk away disappointed. Between the price, flavor, and authenticity, I won't be returning.",b1M1M84HFN8_obj_5RBWeA,6,1,2,rcfF3nLmg4ILftO-2yTFMg

The first thing I noticed was the large helping of steak Pop's puts on their sandwich (hello protein), I had to look more. Then I saw they serve sweet potato fries... Then I was sold. 

The philly I ordered was a #32 which was a 9"" philly served with about 5 oz. o strip steak, onions, bell peppers, red peppers, your choice of cheese, and mushrooms (I didn't get the mushrooms)

I also got an order of sweet potato fries with their cinnamon for sauce ( I didn't care for the sauce)

While I do like fast service, getting served already cooked meat, onions, and mushrooms swimming in meat juice and reheated on the grill isn't what I was hoping for. Three distinct flavors that should all be tasted in a good philly, and everything tasted like the meat juice. I asked for American cheese and I think I was given provolone, on account that it was especially stringy for whatever reason. There was so much bread in comparison to the meat, onion, and mushrooms that was in the sandwich. 

The frier was broke or being cleaned, so I couldn't get any fries or other side items to go with my sandwich.

As a vegetarian, I basically get a massive, molten glob of several cheeses, grilled onions, lettuce & then add some ketchup or BBQ sauce (*if* I can find it there).     The reaction I get from other customers is always interesting as I tell the cook I'm a vegetarian, HOWEVER it turns out that one of the cooks that's there often is actually a vegetarian too, and note to some of you tough-guys: just because some of us vegetarians care enough about other animals to not eat them, it does not imply we don't mind fighting & hurting some dumb human who decides he needs to offer his opinion on vegetarians if he overhears our order.


  The bread is very fresh, and of course it & the rest of the gooey, heart-attack-calling mess tastes great.    I used to get a side of fries, but they weren't anything special, and even 200+lb glutton me doesn't need to fries if I'm planning on eating the whole sandwich then & there.

  I can & will continue to try other cheesesteak joints.   I know this will disgust some of you carnivores, but some cheese-steak places actually have a fake meat item (called seitan) that they'll use to create a vegetarian cheesesteak that looks and YES, once you add the cheeses, onions, sauces, etc. TASTES very similar to a real cheesesteak, so I am still looking for places that do that (Pop's doesn't).     However, the product I eat at Pop's is great, and another wonderful thing about it is that it's open 24/7.

We ordered the Philly Cheese steak and it was pretty good.  Meat was cooked just right that it wasn't chewy and first time ever trying Cheese Wiz on a Philly.  The cheese wiz was actually one hell of a good idea, tasted really good with the sandwich and different from what I expected if I would have just chosen the common cheeses such as provolone.

The only difference from what my friend told me that would have made this equal to Pat's or Ginos was the bun used.  The bun in Pops was not that great in my opinion as well.  I have never tasted Ginos nor Pats so I can only go by from what he says.

I do recommend this place however. Still the best Philly u can get in Vegas from what others I have tried so far.  Next time I'm going to try their breakfast sandwich.

They also have some of the best chili cheese fries I have had.  Give em a try and see if you agree.

I'm picky about flavor and their cheesesteaks lacked flavor, it was it's just too salty. Star snatched. Salt doesn't equate flavor. The meat tasted like ""steakums"" not fresh to me. Fresh meat has a texture to it that is tender and you don't have the chomp down on a cheesesteak... it should practically melt in your mouth, regardless of the toppings selected. Star snatched. I ordered the mushroom steak and asked for bell peppers as well... get home they aren't even in the sandwich- and no they weren't busy enough to excuse it. Star snatched. On top of all of that...The provolone cheese wasn't even melted... everything was ""extra"" and I've never been anywhere that charges ""Per topping"" it's usually whatever steak-combination you choose and you can say if you do or do not want grilled onions and/or bell peppers... not that it is an extra charge unless you actually want EXTRA. no grilled onions just a sad excuse for a Philly cheesesteak IMHO, but alas this is Vegas.

There is no interior dining here, and no, the patio is not fancy, but while I was chewing on my wonderfully soft hoagie stacked with meat and cheese, I couldn't help but admire this mildly grimey but charming outdoor eating arrangement. I felt like I was on an adventure in another country, anonymous, unable to speak the language, and unexpectedly eating a Philly cheese steak. It was wonderful. Sometimes a place just transports you, and for some reason Pop's was that place on that Saturday afternoon.

I admired their plethora of fried offerings from okra to green beans to mushrooms and zucchini. Alas, the only thing I could sell my husband on were the sweet potato fries. I didn't want to consume an entire heap of fried okra alone, so we went with those. We shared a steak hoagie with American, not whiz, and onions and peppers. 

The sandwich was solid. The star was definitely the roll. And, the sweet potato fries were as good as any I have sampled, especially because they were served so hot that I could feel my fingers melting beneath the wax paper. I was tempted to pour their magic coconut water sauce all over them, but I showed restraint. If you are braver, definitely pour away and let me know the results. 

I of course adore the building and the fact that they are open 24 hours. I am sure we will have a 3am cheese steak sometime in the near future, and when it gets cooler, I will definitely go back for the unexpectedly charming patio.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,8,4,9byaYsxQK_6sBXJILa_bBA

For starters, the food is cooked in front of you and visible through the window. When you receive your food, it's warm and ready to be devoured. Another great aspect of this place is the amount of meat that you get for the price. The Philly steak's is between $6-10 and I believe is properly priced.

The pros: The bread is soft and spongy with a toothy bite to it. The filling is cooked on a well seasoned griddle which picks up more flavor as the day goes on. The Cheese Whiz is plentiful. The fried zucchini were some of the best I have had. They are not freshly made, but the batter holds firm. 

The cons: The meat and fixings was on the skimpy side. Some of the sides are worth the $3.95, but items such as the pretzel costing that much is ridiculous. Especially since they are so cheap to produce.

Perhaps look elsewheres for your morning meal or you may have to fight with him as well!

For $9-$10, you can get one utterly amazing cheesesteak.

I've tried chill cheese, barbecue, pizza, even fish cheesesteaks.  And somehow each one is just as amazing (though the chili cheese one is my personal favorite).  Their menu is to the point, but they have a lot of options within the cheesesteak and fry families.  Even their chips are good.

I see that they have Italian Ices as well, but I'm not even bothering with that until the weather warms up.

I've driven by this place so many times.  For YEARS now.  How could I not have explored this amazing place before?  I LOVE cheesesteaks!  It boggles my mind, is what it does!  

But I'll put it this way: Now that I have found this place, I will make up for lost time.  I've already hit this place up several times in the last month.  Heck, I even hit it up on Christmas Day night after being over the whole turkey and ham thing.  24/7, they never close.  I could get a cheesesteak at 3:17 A.M. if I wanted to, and there's no force of man that could stop me.  Truly a marvel of modern invention, this place.

They do have Tastykakes and Frank's sodas (!), so if you are craving some Black Cherry Wishniak, Pop's is your go-to place.

Anyhow, POP's is even more fanatical about cheesesteak. Look at their website and the detailed manifesto explaining why they use Liberty Steaks, Amarosa Bakery rolls and other carefully sourced and authentic ingredients.

It shows in the finished product, a Pat's style sandwich with ribeye chopped on the grill. I order mine wit extra onions (caramelized to a beautiful brown) and Cheez Whiz. I recommend you do the same. Can't go wrong with the classics.

I would go here more if it wasn't in an area I loathe driving to, but that is probably a good thing as these are very bad for me.  This is another area of Vegas where I'm afraid to get out of my car.  The huge iron fences on the windows when you order from here says it all - this neighborhood is crap.

Don't kill me people but, I am not a fan of the cheese whiz on these sandwiches, as I think it completely ruins the flavor.  But I am a fan of provolone.

One thing I should mention is that they had soft pretzels on the menu when we were there last time.  My husband, who orders soft pretzels pretty much everywhere he goes wanted one, and was informed him they took these off the menu, because no one really orders pretzels at a cheesesteak place.

I was craving a Philly Cheese Steak last night, but couldn't get one until my check hit. So I really really really wanted a Philly Cheese Steak tonight. 

It was a bit chilly out and there was a couple on the side, I was told they already ordered. So I placed my order a #32 and a #6 both with bacon. The previous two times prior they were pretty sparse with the meat and bacon compared to what I'm used to, I figured it was just the Grill Master. This time was no different, he put a lot of onions for one sandwich and barely any for the other, I didn't say anything because I don't like to complain. He made my sandwiches, then cut them wrapped them and put them aside. I figured he was waiting for the cashier to come ring me up, so I patiently waited. He began assisting the couple that had already ordered. (It appeared they were waiting for wings) I figured it would be just a minute or two and I would get my food, however that was not the case. I ended up waiting for over 7 minutes, the couples card declined 3 times. I decided I wasn't going to pay $25+ for two cold sandwiches that have been sitting there for about 10 minutes. 

Money is tight so I haven't been able to indulge as much as I would like and I was really looking forward to a Hot Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. I think the employees really dropped the ball this time. If I'm paying around $12 a sandwich I want it hot. If you're helping someone else, that's fine I'll wait. I want my food hot off the grill.

For one thing I strongly believe that if a business/restaurant deserves 5 stars, you better believe that everything they serve and their customer service is top notch. And I failed to believe everything on the menu was good, but you better believe that their philly cheese steaks are probably the best I've tried in LV and in the Bay Area.

The first time I was here I ordered the philly cheese steak with bacon and swiss #9. It was just as good as advertised and just as good as it looked while the cook was making it. I also ordered the cheese whiz fries and boy was that also yummy. I also ordered fried 'shrooms, and those little mouth watering bites were simply just awesome. It was the first time I tried anything mushroom fried in batter, and I was damn glad this place was my first. The second time I ate here I ordered the pizza philly cheese steak.....mmmmm, was that yummy it was like ordering on of my two favorite things and smashing it into one nice juicy hoagie. I also ordered cheese whiz fries again, but this time I had the master cook add some bacon in it, man was that good.

Not impressed.. nothing was fresh I don't care what they say..i suppose bc of the fast nature of the business maybe they precook the veggies. We ordered chicken Philly with provolone and Philly cheese steak with provolone..cheeze wiz is the most horribly processed ingredient and we couldn't bare the taste so we passed on this Philly tradition. We ordered okra as well which was frozen but I expected that.. the ranch dressing dipping sauce was from a powder that I didn't like.. the chicken and steak was that quick frozen thin sheet type of meat.. this was just not my type of place.. now I'm craving a east coast cheese steak.  ..$12 for each sandwich..a, waste of money",nVZLzic8X9VhDbTsXlmgRQ,0,1,2,g9wo47ieqC3k5GusfG8HcA

Some may think $9.99 is pricey but it's not for the size, amount of fillings and the flavor. They make it right in front of you and they have an awesome menu of variations and sides. It's patio dining which works best for evening and overnight dining. They do not have a drive thru but service is very fast.

My sweet friend Sergio I noticed often has a very large appetite on the nights we hang out. Pop's is close to his house so it makes a stop very convenient late at night since they are always open.

The staff is friendly and they make good solid food so this review will be sweet and simple. I have had a variety of their cheesesteaks in the past and they have always been good with quality ingredients. I must say that I really enjoy their sweet potato fries that come with a yummy coconut dipping sauce. Their regular French fries are great as well and are fresh cut.

Service is great, food is great and they are open 24/7. My only tip to you is that this is not a place to come to if you are low on cash, you better save those coins for the dollar menu somewhere else if you are on a budget! lol

Take out is your best option as it is a free standing store with a few patio chairs and tables to sit at outside. It is on a busy street so it may not be as comfortable relaxing to eat with cars whizzing by plus the crazy wind.

Got a #2 Cheese Whiz steak sandwich and some onion rings.  Greasy?  Yes.  Pricey?  A bit.  Good?  No doubt.  It was pretty darn good.  The onion rings were good thick onion rings, and a fair price of 3.95 for what they gave you.  I got a free side of ranch with that, no complaints there.

Food came out minutes after ordering, took it home and devoured it.  For 15 bucks overall, I got my money's worth and a full stomach.

Limited parking as it sits on a corner, outdoor undercover seating only on tall diner stools and tables.  Reminds me of the old snack bar days at the baseball fields as a kid.

I've been meaning to try this place for years. Having passed by it from time to time I always think to myself, why haven't I been there yet. Well, I have seen and I have conquered. All I can say is I can't believe it took me so long. 

The atmosphere is pretty cool and they are QUICK with the orders. We waited no longer than five minutes for our entire order to be ready after paying. Even better, they cook it fresh.

This place offer a great dining experience. I had the cheesesteak with mushrooms and whiz, my fella tried the cheesesteak with bacon and swiss. These sandwiches are no joke. Large and in charge. I could barely finish half of a half after also ordering some battered mushrooms and cheez whiz fries. We could definitely have shared one sandwich between the two of us.

I found the sides to be fantastic. I tend to judge a place by it's sides and this place did it for me. They were greasy and delicious, even after a long car ride home.

I love anything authentic.  And supposedly all of the ingredients (rolls, cheese, meat) are flown in directly from Philly itself. I ordered the provolone mushroom cheesesteak, and it was just OK.  Maybe I needed to order the cheese whiz to make it more authentic, but I just can't bring myself to eat something that artificially bright yellow. 

The roll was definitely piled high with the tender meat.  I only ate half because it was so filling.  But it wasn't as seasoned or flavorful as I was expecting it to be.  The mushrooms added some flavor, but that was it.  Perhaps I am just not a phillycheesesteak type of girl. 

There were 2 people ahead of me in line, so there was a bit of a wait. I am just grateful I went in the spring and not in the middle of summer.  I doubt i will have any cheesesteak cravings any time soon, but it is comforting to know that if I do have one, they are open 24 hours.
