462074,2014-12-12,0,qqJkYCUIzGvmtOVtnxznfw,Ordered the special 2 med for 6.99 each. 1 was supposed to be half olive and half cheese. They put olives on all of it. Asked them to just do the 2nd pizza. Charged me $12 for 1 medium pizza. No thank you. I'll take my business to someone who can make what I order. The entire time they were looking at each other confused. Rude people.,MNB6buqzwdz4Y77a2VLuhw,0,0,1,w3stda65st7wNI40IS-HQg

so it ended being the wrong pizza hut for my zone and i went on to say Thank you but before i could even say that she had already hung up on me.. called back to ask for a manager to let them know how unpleasant she had been but of course she happened to be the manager soon I'll just tell it to yelp instead lol. Thanks for shitty service, Monica :)",tsdAWu_JvOM1iTfNtPpI3Q,4,0,1,9eWUiiF8MEPDUNqrSpdzBg

The pizza, wings and breadsticks are so crappy I had to throw it all out after just one bite. I called to get my money back but nothing could be done. So screwy. Won't be coming to this location EVER again. Made my whole Pizza Hut experience unbearable.",rd7xllQYSMvs5il6Nw5WOQ,0,0,1,tRNSi16PuVZZOq-Gmt70kw

Regardless, I have definitely had better pizza in general than any Pizza Hut in the US, anyways, so this review is going to be more about the service. 

Service: 2 - Feeling lazy one Saturday night, we ordered our Pizza online with some garlic sauce to boot. 

They ended up calling about 2 minutes after we sent the order to make sure that we actually ordered. If they're going to do that, they should just get rid of online ordering and prompt everyone to make a phone call! It would be much easier on their end.

When we arrived at the time that they said it would be ready over the phone, the pizza was ~not~ ready. They continued to state while we were waiting that the ""real reason"" they called was because they were out of garlic sauce...then why didn't you mention that over the phone? Another 8-10 minutes later, we had a pizza to take home!

Poor organization and failure to make a pick-up deadline for a just-okay pizza. Service is slow and confusing--better avoid! Happy food hunting :)",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,3,3,2,urXibjZRS08o_qj2qjek4w
