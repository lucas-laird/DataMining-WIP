We started with wedge salads where you get almost a whole head of lettuce. Excellent bleu cheese dressing with hunks of bacon to go with it almost fills you up right there. 
We both had steaks and both were cooked perfectly. My wife's filet melted in her mouth. My kona crusted NY strip had tons of flavor and very little waste. We both thought the mashed potatoes were really good but were starting to run out of room and we couldn't skip dessert. 
The flourless chocolate cake is a winner but I suspect anything you get here will satisfy you. 

Chuck, our server, was awesome and the service from everyone all night was perfect.
We won't wait so long for a return visit.",AdxhlxXSGjRsCQxG6ZjfTw,0,0,5,EetngkeT9ySBGnjms93peg

27728,2008-03-06,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"My first experience with The Capital Grille was at their new restaurant in downtown Seattle, which has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants. So, when I saw that there was one directly across the street from my hotel in Vegas I thought ""hey, why not!"" The room wasn't ready yet anyway, and I was famished so I headed over.

Sitting at the bar, because there's no better place to meet people and have a good time in any Vegas restaurant, I ordered my newly discovered favorite appetizer - the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. The flavor was great (it was cheese wrapped in meat after all) but the presentation was not quite up to Seattle standards. I guess maybe they don't need to try as hard because they've been around for several more years than their Seattle counterpart.

Overall the restaurant itself was very similar (surprise, it's a chain) with dark wood, brass, and paintings of famous people, most of which I don't even recognize. But it does come off a little cheesy, especially seeing that the Vegas Capital Grille is located in a mall. Oh well. At least I still have Seattle!",8VP2LZagEVW6jtYBRBNuXg,1,1,3,exLAvlK58-LtsO5BP-ZTXg

60367,2012-09-11,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Having been to the Chicago location, I knew I was in for a treat.  

While the steak (Delmonico 22oz)  was amazing as usual, what really stood out were the appetizers of Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes, the Lobster/Crab Cakes  and the side of Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese. I would go back for these items alone.  

The only problem we encountered was the empty hostess station when we arrived. Even though we made a reservation, between waiting for the hostess to appear and sitting at the bar, we had to wait about 15min for them to ""put our table together"". I was disappointed to see that when we were finally taken to the dinning room we had been seated at a booth. For a group of four guys, this isn't an ideal seating situation. 

In the end, the food and wine made it easy to overlook the poor service at the hostess station. If you're out there celebrating an important event, I recommend The Capital Grille.",kt2XfOVLakufrMxXqzGyjw,1,1,4,ifxfoXHOh-l_BObzABBUtg

89525,2014-01-07,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"My husband took me here for birthday dinner and we were impressed with their service. We can't comment much on the steak at this time because we couldn't taste the steak this time. But we want to praise them for their great service and professionalism. 4 stars all go to their service. Not 5 star yet because we can't comment on the steak yet.....maybe 5 stars next time after we go back again next time. Please read on for what they have done right below:


We ordered steaks but couldn't really taste it as we ordered our steak medium well, but the steak came out burned outside and rare inside. My husband's was a porterhouse, and mine was a rib-eye. my rib-eye did have a portion that is more like a medium, so I ate that part, at least still better than the steak I had earlier somewhere for lunch. My husband's porterhouse was medium on the edge, and pretty rare when it got closer to the bone. We didn't want to ask for cooking them more as the outside was very burned up (basically black). So we tried to eat the part that is more like a medium, and considered taking the rare part home, But when we got to the pretty rare part, we were still hungry and we think we couldn't handle the bloody taste anymore, it was also hard to chew on with the rareness, so we asked them to grill them some more. I guess at that point, they noticed that the steaks were burned outside and rare inside (they probably wonder why we didn't say anything earlier), and after grilling them some more, the outside got even more black and the inside was not yet medium well. So the manager came out and apologized to us very professionally and sincerely. And they said they would take care of the steaks. We were a bit surprised because we haven't experienced such kind of professionalism in restaurants for quite a long time. And they still continue to serve us sincerely after they said they would take care of the steaks. The server still kept saying happy birthday to me, and they still gave me the complimentary birthday dessert after they said they would pay for our steaks. The dessert tasted good and the presentation was good too. So at the end, there was no bill at all and we could have just walked away without paying anything. They didn't even leave a tab on the table at the end (the black thing that holds the bill when you ask for the check), meaning they are not pressuring us to leave tip. What a good ethics and attitude! In fact, we wanted to tip them even more instead because of all the good business ethics and professional service! We estimated how much the meal would have been if the steaks didn't come out wrong, then we calculate the tip off that amount. I think we gave more than 20% tip. They deserve the tip money though the steaks came out as a mistake. Since there was no tab, we gave the tip directly to the server. 

There was no upsetness though the steaks were messed up. We were pleased and we think we would go back again to give it a try again in the future. Again, professionalism and service are very crucial in restaurant business. Of course good food is important too.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,2,0,4,RQxZlkXAAiDA6KNmvThi5w

But I thought he burger was sook good, I only could eat half but it was defineyly juicy, tender and the bacon added tucked undernthe melted cheese added good flavor.  The truffle fries were to die for ... They came out hot and crush topped with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil... Easily one of the best fries I have ever had!! The crab burger came with some tasty tartar sauce and tasted very fresh not too breast. Mostly crab . I also had a bloody Maria which was delicious as well but would have liked to get a olive or two... overall it was a very good meal for a good price ( considering las Vegas drip coffee is almost $4 a cup) a $18 burger is about right !

187855,2014-03-24,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"First, the good - the location for us is great, we usually stay at the Venetian or Palazzo, the menu has many options from dry aged steak to and seafood choices, and if you can get seated by the windows, the view is awesome.
 
Our most recent experience was NOT pleasant.  We made reservation for 7:30pm for Saturday.   We arrived a bit early ~ 7:15pm and were told they could seat us closer to our reservation time.  As we walked by the dining area to the bar, we did notice multiple tables that were open.  We were seated at 7:50 after having two drinks, in itself is no big deal. Everything went fine with ordering, etc, but things went astray when our food arrived.  I had ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) and my wife ordered lamb chops (medium).  My filet was cooked fine, however, my wife's lamb chops were over-cooked AND medium rare.  How they could be cooked differently, I don't know.  We waited for the server to come by but he didn't.  After a few minutes, a person came to fill our water and we asked for her to find our server.  A couple of minutes passed and she found someone else to ask what was the problem.  He noted they were not prepared correctly and took them away.  Isn't it the server's responsibility to come and check if we are satisfied with our food?  During this time, I ate about half my meal while my wife waited for her chops.  The manager (Robert Clark) did come to apologize and asked if he could take my filet and re-heat it so we could eat together.  I also asked him to take the asparagus as they were cold and had gotten wilted.  It took over 15 more minutes before our dinner came to us.  Mr. Clark brought my wife's dinner to insure it met with our expectations, which this time it was prepared as requested.  Their second most popular item should not take so long to be sent out, especially if it is for a client that has been waiting so long. The server brought us our bill and apologized.  At the end of the day what's the big deal?  I ate half my meal believing my wife's would be brought within a few minutes, but instead she waited for her entrée about 30 minutes after finishing our salads.  This is suppose to be a quality steakhouse. This was the second time this happened.  The previous time, my Delmonico steak was not prepared property and that too took an inordinate amount of time to get back my entrée.  In neither instance did we receive more than an apology, taking the entrée off the bill, free dessert, nothing.  High-quality restaurants should not only apologize for their mistakes; they should make up for them.  Last, in comparing a similar price-point establishment we have been to Delmonico's in the Venetian at least a half-dozen times and have NEVER had to send anything back.  I could only say the view won't overcome the service again.",quxNudk5Yqjp5SGGNOisug,4,1,2,6WkRocW0h_ptqT3IDp3JBA

My girlfriend has a number of food allergies that means she can't eat spices and other things that are normal in meals to make them taste good.  So I took her here and she could not believe how good a steak without any add ons could taste.

Started off with the bread basket - there were a varieties of breads, I chose the pumpernickel with raisins, it was soft and fresh.  

Next, I opted to go with light fare for dinner:

1. Chopped Salad - romaine and iceberg lettuces, corn, asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, crunchy parmesan croutons, all served with a side of house made ranch...Fresh and lovely.
2. Truffle Fries w/ parmesan - Oh yeah, baby!

In conclusion, I thought my dinner was excellent...Furthermore, if I could ever be tempted out of being a veggie by some delectable piece of meat, I honestly believe that a dry aged steak at The Capital Grille would be a prime candidate.

The bartender then brought us our wine and appetizer which was incredible. We tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi which was incredible.

Starting with the fresh oysters, they are so fresh that I can taste the ocean. My husband doesn't like raw food but he ate 3. With that kind of quality for only $18 for half dozen, it's totally worth the price. 

Calamari was crisp. I was surprised it can be tasted that good with the hot peppers. Must try!

Steak tartare, a little bit dry but not too bad. I had better :)

Lobster crab cakes, not too special. $20 for only 2 pieces, I think you can skip it.  
 
We had the rib eye for main course, and the steak cooked to perfection with the fries on the side. One of the best steaks in town.

Great restaurant with awesome service and good food. Give the food 4 stars. Good high quality food. Absolutely better than average. Definitely going to get your money's worth. 

FOOD: Ordered 2lb lobster with jumbo shrimp cocktail. Shrimp were fresh and served with a cocktail sauce that was familiar but with a little kick. Would recommend.  The lobster was cool to perfection. Recommend letting the lobster cool a bit before eating. They brought mine piping hot and the taste was off. Hard to explain but trust me as soon as it cooled off, the lovely taste of lobster was obtained. $25/lb I find it was a great value.  Definitely recommended to lobster lovers. 2lbs is more than enough. Would suggest sharing. I've had better, but happy to come back for
Seconds. 

SERVICE:  is where this place stands out above the rest.  Everyone from the receptionist to the manager greeted us with appreciation and pleasant attitudes. They were very attentive to my comfort and happiness. Never had to ask for a refill on my water or ice tea. (My biggest pet peeve). My server Melissa (red head) was pretty much awesome in every way. She asked me
How everything was and told her that I had 4 claws with my lobster. She informed me that I should of only had 2 claws and told me she would talk to the manager about it. The manager came by and talked to me. He assured me that this was highly unusual and he would investigate it further. Thinking he would just give me an excuse, I was surprised when he apologized and would replace my lobster with a new one. I just wanted to trade in 2 claws for more tail but he gave me everything to make sure I was happy. Kuddos guys because actions like this makes me happy to spend 30 minutes of my life to tell all the restaurant goers to eat here. If you're not happy, they will try to make you leave that you are important enough to have you coming back for more. Great job guys !!!!

I got a filet which was cooked correctly but was not a $50 steak. I've had better for half the price. When I picked it up the kid who brought it out had not thought to include utensils. Luckily the friendly bartender asked him, but when I got back to my hotel I found this kid's idea of takeout utensils was three forks. So I got to tear apart my steak like some sort of well off caveman.

Sooooooooooo delicious! 

Tried: 
- calamari with hot cherry peppers (If you're a calamari fan, this is for you. Crunchy with a little heat and generous proportions) 
- french onion soup -- YES YES YES! If I went back, I would order the crock and not just the measly cup. If your doctor has put you on a low sodium diet, step away (and pass your crock to moi.) 
- butter poached lobster (kill me now) and beef tenderloins  [My meal. Lobster was divine. Not one big lobster tail but a few small ones [like 1/3 the size of the palm of my hand]. Meat was good but not amazing.] 
- Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic [aka rib eye, but double check that. Deeeeelicious. And insanely large at 22 oz. Great flavor at medium rare. (it should be a crime to cook up steak above medium rare. A crime!)] 
- Kona rubbed Delmonico. [the kona rub was all my stepmom could talk about before we got there. Has a coffee-meets-chocolate sort of flavor. And, while it's a ""rub"" like the porcini, the kona comes off as more of a sauce. Seriously tasty but I'm not sure I could personally down 22 oz. of it. Would get this and the porcini or a seafood dish and share.] 
- Asparagus (good - not mushy) 
- side of mushrooms (also delicious) 
- Au gratin (massive. Didn't try it myself but told it was creamy goodness)

Remember: all the meats are a la carte, so be prepared to get some sides. 

Dessert was acceptable but not mind blowing (and thus I shed a single baby tear). We got the cheesecake (fluffy while still being fairly dense) and the berries with cream (tasty). Both were good -- indeed, some loved the cheesecake -- but I would have appreciated some different options (e.g., a chocolate cake that wasn't super dark and dense). 

Oh! And the service there is abso-friggin-lutley fantastic. Our dinner party consisted of two men and two women. When the waitress came to take our order she asked us the most genius question: ""Ladies, would you like to order first or last?""  Is that not awesome! So often I'm expected to go first but, surprise surprise, don't know what I want yet. That simple question let us choose in a seamless way. Fantastic! I only wish I remembered her name! All I know is she loved Garth Brooks! :)

I ordered the ice berg lettuce wedge with blue cheese dressing... the combination of the two was perfect & I finished the whole thing.  I ordered the aged ribeye medium rare and a side of creamed spinach (I know, I'm so old fashioned).  It was the best steak I have had in a very long time.   I just love a really good-quality steak without the bells & whistles...  sorry, some people might want to rub kona coffee on a good steak but that's just blasphemous.  However, there are exceptions... my friend ordered the porchini-rubbed ribeye with balsamic vinegar and he shared slice w/ me... it was out-of-this world!  That's what I'll order next time.

The creamed spinach was also very good... you can taste the quality ingredients. Not the nasty, frozen, formulaic stuff like Boston Market makes.

I started my meal with the salty and sour prosciutto wrapped melted Mozzarella that was evenly balanced with the sweetness of the mini vine ripe tomatoes and crostini.  I also had the garlicky fried calamari with cherry peppers.  It wasn't as spicy as I expected, but the tangy peppers added kick to the calamari.  For a salad, I had to have the stinky stuff....sweet onions on thick slices of tomatoes that was sprinkled with a Vinaigrette and roquefort cheese...so delicious.  I followed this with the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Steak with 8-Year Aged Balsamic.  I asked for a medium which turned out a little more drier and cooked than I expected.  It seems they run more on the well done side, rather than most restaurants running mor to the rare side.  This brought it down to 3 stars.  I also accompanied the steak with some creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin.  The stars went back to 4 after finishing off with.the most delicious coconut cream pie.

I will say the steak is good and this place would earn 3-4 stars in other cities, but in comparing it to other LV steakhouses, it's a 2.   

Other minor dig - it has way too much of an ""expense account"" vibe - definitely not conducive to a fun Vegas evening.",lQT5lasCGBaB8fdUc9GBiw,2,0,2,kYF5JaJ103GnmzBy4_bcNQ
1057582,2013-06-08,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"When we first started going to Capital Grill, I was really blown away by the quality of the food and the care they put into all elements of the dining experience. Not much has changed.

STEAK: We ordered the wrong steaks tonight. It has clearly been a while since we've been here. After consulting with our waiter, we we ordered the ribeye, NOT the porcini rubbed rib eye that we love. I ordered my steak ""medium rare plus"". I like that label. I tried to explain to the waiter that I wanted my steak between medium and medium rare. When the waiter appeared confused, I told him that if the steak wasn't medium, I'd rather they erred on the side of medium rare than medium well. He THEN suggested medium rare plus. I don't eat steak out very often, so that designation may be common knowledge to others. It was new to me. The meat was...a bit off tonight, but I chalk that up to my disappointment at not having the right steak. It was cooked nicely and seasoned well, but I was not a fan of something I tasted in the beef and the sauce that accompanied it.

SIDE DISHES: We had a salad, potatoes au gratin, and green beans. We skipped their delicious calamari and seafood platter. Everything was done well. The potatoes were a tad bit under seasoned, but certainly nothing to worry about. 

SERVICE: This is where CG usually shines. But not so much tonight. Good establishments can have an off night, or an off employee. But when you come to a place like this, you are expecting polished service. The host was a Professional (capital P). He was on the phone, dealing with clients, directing the secondary host, and organizing the tables around a large party in the venue. All at the same time.  The bussers were attentive and one woman even came and refolded my husband's napkin while he was away from the table. I like all of those touches. The waiter was well meaning, but not up to CG standards. Little things like drinks being poured in the wrong glasses (not our waiter's fault), missed oppotunities for menu clarification, or knowing the daily specials don't amount to much. Unless a guest is less than excited about her meal.

WHAT HAS CHANGED: I don't know if I have changed or CG has. I never saw Capital Grill as a modern ""old school"" steak house before. I did tonight. The dishes were all very typical and expected, but there was a heaviness and lack of ingenuity to the meal. I know a steakhouse isn't looking to wow its customers with modern twists on old standbys, but the food should be impeccable. Beautifully seasoned and cooked. Even though I was directed to the wrong steak, it should have been the best quality meat and  the steak should have stood up on its own. I wasn't and it didn't.  

VALET: It's a mess and they will have you waiting in the heat to pick up your car. Not good, but not CG's fault.

Capital Grill has an old-school feel. The decor is modern and sleek, but the offerings reflect more of what Vegas was than what it is today.  In spite of that, CG is still a solid choice for a delicious meal. A flawed meal a CG is still head and shoulders above many other places in town.

The bread that came out before was delicious. They had probably 5-6 different types of bread in a basket, so if you're picky about your grains, you have options. A friend and I split the Delmonico steak and Lobster Mac & Cheese (AND an entire bottle of wine... YOLO!) I appreciate that the staff here knew we were splitting, so they came out with the steak cut in half for us. The food was great! Steak was cooked perfectly and the Lobster Mac & Cheese was not lacking in lobster and was probably the best lobster mac & cheese I've ever had in my entire life (I've only had it about maybe 4 times, though). We were so stuffed afterwards. 

I docked one star because of an incident we saw while they were seating another table. The couple was seated in a booth that did not have place settings, so I believe it was the manager at the time that shot the server a nasty look, kind of like ""Why the hell would you seat them there. Are you dumb?"" I kind of felt bad for the server because there was nothing she could do. It almost felt degrading. And on top of that, the manager wasn't hiding her emotions. Basically anyone in the restaurant could have seen it happen. If you have constructive criticism, do it behind closed doors. Not where people can openly see you treat someone with a nasty attitude.

From the beginning:

- the complimentary shrimp small plate was very tasty, a good start. 
- my Caesar salad was nothing special. My wife's felt her wedge was overpowered by the dressing but I thought it was ok. It was large. Consider sharing. 
- we both considered seafood but got the delmonico med rare. It was cooked appropriately but was not exceptionally tasty
- the asparagus side was burned. It was replaced with a better prepared dish
- they brought a complimentary lobster Mac and cheese because we weren't fond of the Caesar salad. Nice. But it was fairly dry. 
- a complimentary crime brûlée was served for my birthday. I love creme brûlée but this was denser than I like.

The prices are a tad bit more affordable compared to the fancy steak houses in and around LV. The service is top notch and every waiter is so personable and funny. They are honest about what food and drink they think would be best suited for you.. which can take some pressure of you. 
The Gorgonzola NY strip is great... but the kona crusted NY strip I ate earlier in the year from there was a hair better I thought. My wife's bone in filet was a juicy piece of meat n melted in your mouth, but watch out for the steep price. The sautéed mushrooms were great as a side. You can't go wrong with mushrooms doused in butter. 
I love the fact they knew it was my birthday and left me a card from the staff and a free dessert at meals end. Very nice touch! 
Take advantage of their unlimited wine pours for $28. It's only around for the summer and they use 10 highly rated wines. Not $5 wines you can buy at cvs. You can definitely take advantage but I'm sure you'll be a drunkard by the end of the meal.

Our server,who's name I cannot remember but was a rugby player, was extremely knowledgable on both the menu and drinks. Describing in detail about all ingredients and how how everything is prepared along with why they pair well together. He was very attentive and really knew how speak with us and the guest without making it awkward or bothersome. He really made our experience amazing! Sorry I don't remember his name because he really deserves recognition but I'm pretty sure he's the only rugby player there. They also set up our table with some nice decoration and wrote us a handwritten anniversary card.

The food was on a whole other level of delicious. We started off with the Lobster and crab cakes and the calamari. Both the best I've ever had! The calamari was nice and spicy but not to the point where it was uncomfortable to eat. The lobster/crab cakes tasted fresh and where nicely sized. Our main course was the tenderloins and butter-seared lobster. Best lobster tail I've ever had! The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked to temp. Our side to share was the lobster mac and cheese, let me just say it blew my mind! Not too salty or over cheesed  and had a good amount of lobster portioned in. Our server brought us complimentary dessert with ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate, which was really nice of him.

We came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday and they truly gave us the royal treatment. They sat us by the window overlooking the Vegas Strip, had the table decorated with birthday confetti and birthday card, gave us complimentary tastings of two drinks, and provided a generous  sampling of their desserts with a birthday candle. 

The server Dominic was amazing and extremely helpful in helping us decide on our meal for the evening. He was a significant contributor to why we had such a fantastic time. Not only was he helpful with food recommendations but he also gave us tips on which casino games were statistically more likely to pay out and also asked some of his colleagues for recommendations on where to go to get the most bang for our buck. We were sort of new to the whole gambling world and appreciated his insights. 

The food was AMAZING. My friend whose birthday we celebrated stated that her bone in fillet was THE BEST steak she had ever had. I had the bone in NY strip with Gorgonzola and savoured it to the last bite. I was amazed that I had almost finished the entire strip. They cooked both steaks perfectly (med rare). We ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon and the mushroom plate for our sides and really enjoyed both. We were glad not to have ordered something more heavy because we were stuffed by the end of the meal. My friend and I also shared a bottle of red that we absolutely loved also. I am so happy they include ratings for the wines that are rated 90 points or higher so we were able to choose a bottle that was guaranteed to be good. I even took a photo of the bottle so I can try to purchase it elsewhere. The trio of desserts they provided were amazing as well. Our favorite was the coconut cream pie but the cheesecake and chocolate cake were also delicious. I have absolutely no criticisms to offer because the entire experience was remarkable.

1544959,2017-09-03,27,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Look no further than The Capital Grille for Las Vegas's most consistent Steak.

I was pretty excited when I was told we would be having dinner at Capitale Grille as part of a recent bachelor party weekend in Vegas. I am a huge devotee of this national chain - and I usually hate national chains - but everything from the service to the incredible Steaks makes Capitale Grille a best-in-class Steakhouse. The interior at Capital Grille exudes class with its dark woods, Tiffany chandeliers, and brass accents. The service has been just as polished as the brass railings on every occasion making this the go to spot for congratulatory dinners. 

My current fave appetizer has to be the Steak Tartare with Truffle Deviled Egg although I am easily persuaded to the Smoked Salmon if company insists. As for a salad, it is summertime and the Caprese will never disappoint thanks to that wonderfully salty and loose cheese employed with the vine ripe tomato halves. I should also add that their Burger is seriously solid and features Chopped Sirloin, Smoked Bacon, and Sweet Onion. A must do for any power lunch (or otherwise).

As for Steak of choice? It is tough, The Capital Grille seems to sear an impeccable medium rare on anything and therefore I always find it a chore deciding what to get. My usual choice is their tremendous Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter because it is simply fantastic and the meat seems to melt as you chew. Another total win is the Snake River Farms Wagyu Filet, but be warned it is incredibly rich and flavorful. A little goes a very long way. The Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream is another wonderful choice and boasts a Sirloin with a black peppercorn kick. All Steak should be enjoyed with an order of Au Gratin Potatoes to share with the table. Topped with potato chips (no, that is not Panko).

For the ladies, I would most certainly give a nod to the Filet Oscar with lump Dungeness Crab that is riddled with an intense Béarnaise sauce or go all in with the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails. You really cannot lose. 

I am a gigantic proponent of The Capital Grille's Steak creations and will be back next time I am in Vegas.",sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,30,28,5,zkgC16l6gCU61V5MTY-N0A

They had an incredible $50 3-course prix fixed menu and got the wine tasting for $25.  While the food was top notch, the service from the staff and particularly our waiter Alex, was just incredible in every aspect.

Alex was very courteous and helpful in describing the menu items, made recommendations on the wine tasting and I think he was generous with the pourings since it was the last day of the promotion and they had some extra wine not on their normal menu.  We were his only table after another party left, so he was very attentive, but his bussers were also awesome.

The resturant week promotion also contributes to threequare.org which support local food banks so we got to make a positive contribution for our weekend of debauchery.

On to the food:
I started out with the french onion soup, it's in a cup, so it's not a huge portion, but it was delicious.  Other folks got the caesar and wedge, no complaints from anyone on the starters.

I had the kona-crusted sirloin medium rare which I recommend.  It's on a hot plate so it cooks for a little bit.  Hint of coffee, but plenty of flavor in the crust and juicy meat.

The filets also got high marks from the bachelor, and the desserts were pretty good.

It's a chain, but honors this town through its presidential portrait - inspired paintings of influential Nevadans and visitors to Las Vegas (Helen Stewart, Sarah Winnemucca and the Rat Pack, Howard Hughes, respectively). The service is top notch, impressive even to Las Vegas residents who are accustomed to a certain level of treatment. The food was wonderful - I loved my steak with the truffle crust and blue cheese topping, but next time will order a plain steak; I'm sure they'll do it ""right"" and it will shine without all the other flavors.
Really nice personal touches, like learning our names and the little thank you note from the chef tied to the doggy bag.",9i51HA_WjE_eTDheEwA-zg,0,0,5,6xU-SujgYA04Y9_j8MoMCQ

24 oz. Dry-Aged Porterhouse - perfectly medium rare. 3 of us enjoyed this equally much.
Lobster/Crab-stuffed Shrimp - this was a beautiful entree but too rich, would strongly recommend sharing.
Spinach salad w/warm bacon dressing, onions, mushrooms - delicious.
Lobster mac - found this too crunchy - heavily crusted (not light as panko typically might suggest), has a few lobster lump pieces.

We first started with apps which we had oysters, lobster and calamari and shrimp.  All was very good!! Oysters were nice and cold and being in Las Vegas surprisingly; tasted fresh.  Lobster was served cold but it was very tasty. The calamari was pretty good.  It defiantly had a some kick to it due to the  peperoncini and peppers mixed it. And the shrimp were huge; could use a little more cocktail sauce but the apps were great!

Now on to my entree all I have to say was YUMM!!!  I ordered the sea bass and it was awesome!!! It was cooked perfectly, tasted great.  I would highly recommend this entree.  My boyfriend ordered the steak and lobster and he said that it was just the right amount of food due to if you order some of the steaks they are huge! His steak was cooked perfectly; just the way he liked it and the lobster was on top with some creamy sauce as the base.  

Our sides were corn, Au gratin potatoes and lobster mac-n-cheese and asparagus.  The sides were good I just have to say if you order the corn, Au Gratin Potatoes and the loster mac-n-cheese, it's all based with cream sauce and bread crumbs.  I've heard from several people that the lobster mac-n-cheese was very good but I wouldn't rate it as a 5.  It was alright.  I expected it to be a little more cheesy and the noodles could of been more of the traditional way to where the cheese can get inside of the noodles instead of using a egg noodles.

All in all, I will definately go there again!!!",6TRuskwkjyGtQ7eKeH9Vtg,0,0,4,Ts3QcilSOWSfhOgD-QnL-g

Our server was Maria and she was AMAZING. She was very attentive and she was so sweet, making our experience a great one. 

For an appetizer we decided on the calamari. Maybe it was the jalapeños, but the dish tasted like nachos. LOL. Not like it was a bad thing, it just caught me by surprise. It's pretty spicy, so if you're not a fan of spice, this is your warning. 

For my entree, I got the Kona crusted NY Strip. It was MASSIVE. But so delectable. It was a melt-in-your-mouth kind of steak, but unfortunately I wasn't able to finish it because it was so big. :( but it tasted even greater the next day for lunch LOL. 

Along with the entrees, my boyfriend and I shared the lobster mac 'n' cheese as a side. SO SO CREAMY, and they were not greedy with the lobster. All the sides are more than big enough for two, so plan accordingly. ¯\_(?)_/¯

the manager had come to our table and asked how we where doing which was very nice.  he said that there was a guest of theres that would like us to have a drink on that person and thanking my son for his service to our country.  that was so cool of that person.

i told our waiter that this was a special occasion after not seeing my son for so long and if she would come to our table with 4-5 different appitizers which she did.  she came with 2 orders of prsciutto wrapped mozzarella, lobster and crab cakes, fresh mozzareliia/tomato/ basi, calamari, and fresh oysters on the half shell.  our waiter even asked if there was anything else and we added 3 orders of chopped salad which we all split among us all and a couple of us ordered the lobster bisc soup and that was really good.

we all ordered steaks.  we ordered the aged porterhuse steak, fillet mignon, and delmonico steak.  we had lobster and cheese mac, green beans, and creamed spinich.

we all had the berries and ice cream for desert.

we also have some leftovers and even the leftovers were great the next day.

the manager had come back to our table when we were almost finished and asked if we enjoyed our meal.  it was all positive comments.  he thanked us for coming and and he thanked my son for his service,  that made me very proud.  our waitrer then brought us our bill and it said paid.  i asked the waiter that i thought there was a problem with the bill and she said that the manager had taken care of this and told me that it was their pleasure to take care of this and thanked me for my sons service.  

not only was this a fantastic meal, this had to have been a $800 dollar tab and for them to do that was a great jesture on their part.  the waiter was taken care of very nicely.

I had the shrimp caesar salad and it would have been good except they drowned my lettuce in the dressing. I think they charged me $20 for it with only four shrimps... Are you kidding me?
I don't remember what the two people I was with ordered but they were not satisfied at all. 
Still hungry is what they were with the extremely small portions they were served. 
For what they charge at this place you should be able to leave full and completely satisfied and WE DID NOT.

We made our reservation for 8:00 because we had tickets to Zumanity at 10:00 thinking 2 hours would be enough time. We arrived on time at 8:00 and were informed that they were running about 10-15 minutes behind. We were asked to sit at the bar. Fine. We went and stood because there were no seats anywhere. 

We were proceeded to be ignored by bartenders for at least 10 minutes before my husband got a Jack and ginger and I got a cranberry vodka. Not rocket science to make those drinks. So we were thinking that we'd get our table soon after. Not so. We waited another 20 minutes before being seated. One might expect that waiting 30 minutes for a table would mean we would get a nice table. Again not so. We were seated next to a two large loud groups. And by next to I mean if I stretched too much I would hit one of the ladies at the table next to me. 

By the time we were seated, we were starving and knew what we wanted for appetizers but our server quickly disappeared and we did not see him for another 15 minutes. The only thing he did quickly was disappear. 

It took us a full 2 hours to eat because the service was so slow. By the time we got out of there it was almost 11:00 and the mall the restaurant is located in was closed. 

We missed our show and after attempts to reach management to discuss this experience to no avail, I promised that I would never ever return.

The table itself was decorated with multi-colored shiny hearts and balloon shaped shiny ornaments. There was also a birthday card from the restaurant.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. It is all dark woods with classically set tables and highly trained wait staff. 

We started with a shrimp cocktail and pan fried calamari with peppers. The shrimp were colossal sized and cooked (boiled or steamed) to perfection. They were extremely fresh and had the texture that can only be obtained from fresh shrimp. The calamari was one of the best dished that I have ever had and those who know me are aware that those words rarely come out of my mouth. Crunchy and crispy perfectly pan fried calamari in a mixture of various peppers. This dish is not for the faint of heart because it was spicy. But great spicy. The kind of spicy that makes you think it hurts so good.

For main courses we ordered the swordfish topped with a mixture of crab and a 22 ounce rib eye that was rubbed with porcini mushrooms. It was served mid rare exactly as ordered and was absolutely a culinary treat. I have had porcini before and of course I have eaten deliciously aged rib eyes but the combination of the two made for a memorable experience.

Capital Grille brought out a birthday dessert containing pieces of their famous creme brûlée style cheesecake and a chocolate cake. Cocktails were perfectly prepared and even the coffee was special.

This is a perfect place for a special occasion, a date or just a great meal. Finally I have to mention that the service was exemplary.",n0mvVYcr4FR5l4Jh7B-dFg,0,0,5,ZmmBp7o6j97J4zmFyTgddw

We showed up about 20 minutes late and, fortunately, they still seated us.  It wasn't super crowded at that point but it packed in right after.  

The decor is nice and relaxing with a chill view.  It's not like a ""fake"" or forced Vegas experience, I don't think.  Just a nice steakhouse overlooking the back end of the strip.

We got a great waiter - Frankie.  It has to be part of a schtick but he looks and acts like a combo of Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, ya know, the ""badda bing New Yahk"" thing.  Great guy, funny... very honest about the menu.  He told me the special and then said, ""But don't get that... get this...""

I'm totally blowing it on this review, as I saved it a while ago but didn't finish it, but I forgot exactly what steak I got... sorry!  But, it was just stupid good.  My friend got a different kind - also amazing.  We had a combo of sides and starters, like salads, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc.  All good.  I get the impression that you can't go wrong here.

I'd definitely recommend but get a reservation - just to be safe.  


Tip... don't try to find the damn hidden elevator in the parking garage below... you'll waste 15 minutes on a wild goose chase... just walk up the little stairs to the blvd, then take the escalator up.",vXSw50X6SurDHp8MpOSvjw,0,3,5,7cNifskHRJr5zvc0Xdcw0Q

The atmosphere is classy and comfortable. If you are seated by the window, you'll have the amazing view of the boulevard. The wait stuff is professional and pleasant.
They have a big selection of wines and a great bread basket as well.
We ordered Lobster bisque. It was very rich and with big chunks of lobster. Their Steak is amazing, it is prepared as expected-without burning or drying out...

From start to finish a culinary carnival of delectible delights.
Service was friendly and attentive, and our needs were always anticipated deftly by our awesome server, Jeff.

Our palatable pilgramage proceeded as follows:

Starters: FRENCH ONION SOUP, CHOPPED SALAD
Soup was amazing - rich, satisfying and even though I didn't order it, I wished I had. Although I did stake claim to the melted cheese on the side of the bowl. which peeled off nicely and started the party in my mouth. Salad was good, but not very memorable.

Entrees:  SEARED SIRLOIN WITH BUTTER-POACHED LOBSTER, PORCINNI RUBBED PORTERHOUSE
Hubba Hubba Hubba!  After my first bite of the lobster, all I could think was ... ""Why have I never had lobster like this before, and why would anyone ever want to eat it any other way!?""  Truly a shell-fish shin-dig of buttery goodness.   My date's steak was amazing and so flavorful! Their balsamic reduction is killer, and my man spent the rest of the evening in beef bliss.

Sides: LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE and  SMASHED POTATOES
THE best potatoes, evah! Perfectly seasoned and loaded with butter, they didn't need a thing except a delivery device to get them into my mouth ASAP! Thank God for spoons. Seriously spudalicious!  The mac & cheese was super good, though it could have used a bit more actual lobster chunks. Still it was super satisfying, creamy, and catapulted me into glorious cheesey gratification.

Desserts:  RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE and COCONUT CREAM PIE
Jeff recommended the Coconut Cream Pie and boy, was he right! The crust tasted like a macaroon, which was a delightful twist.  A massively mouthwatering experience. My man ordered the cheesecake and it was excellent too. 

Our evening at The Capital Grille exceeded our expectations on every level. From the wonderful portraits of Sammy, Frank, and Dean (among other Vegas legends) that greet you as you exit the valet elevator, to the classy service and sublime feast.",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,1,2,4,b6-j6AwfAGvV7zLUAV1kZg

1958169,2015-08-31,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Wife and I stayed at Trump International for the weekend, and had come back from the day's outing. I'd heard of The Capital Grille in DC, and saw this one at the Fashion Show Mall (short walk from our hotel) so I made a reservation online and we went for dinner.

It was a Saturday night. They were busy, but not so much that it diminished the service one bit. From the personal greeting at the podium (I'd entered my last name online for the reservation, and the hostess used it; the person who took us to our table used it; and our waiter addressed us as Mr. and Mrs. when he introduced himself. I thought that was a nice touch.

Our waiter, Ryan, was everything a server should be. Personable, great sense of humor (while being appropriate at all times), completely knowledgeable of the menu, made great recommendations, and he was extremely efficient. There was also a young lady who ensured we never ran out of water. I think that might have been her only job, and she did it very well. (kidding, I'm sure she does other things, I just didn't see them).

We started with the spicy calamari appetizer, and it was delicious. We didn't finish it, because we wanted room for the entrees, but I can tell you it tasted nearly as good the next day warmed up in our NewWave. The variety of peppers really made the calamari flavors stand out, this may be the first time I had calamari without any dipping sauce, and I didn't miss the sauces at all.

I had the double cut lamb rib chops. There are 4 of them, about 12 ounces in total. I ordered them medium rare, and they were cooked perfectly. I love lamb when it's made right, and this was as good as it gets.

My wife had the bone-in ribeye, also medium rare. She loved it, and I had a bite and it was also cooked perfectly. 

We had two sides to share, Sam's mashed potatoes (creamy and delicious) and maybe the best sweet corn I've ever had. It was fresh cut from the cob, as kernels were still together, and they mixed in some peppers and the combo of the sweet corn and spicy peppers was amazing. I mixed some in with the mashed potatoes, and it was great, but I found I preferred savoring each separately instead.

We shared the chocolate cake for dessert. It was good, can't say we were overly impressed but by then we'd had so much great food it might have just been us. 

Prices are high for casual dining (our total with tip was about $270) but well worth it, IMO, for a special night out. The entire dining experience at The Capital Grille in Las Vegas was wonderful - they pamper you, make you feel special, and the food is delicious and the portions are generous.

Oh, one more example of the ""little touches"" they do to make your dinner special - we noticed my napkin was white, but my wife's was black, so she asked Ryan about it. He said they match the color to the clothing their guests are wearing - she had on a black dress, and he said that was so she wouldn't end up with white lint on her dress. Makes sense, but I've never seen that at any other restaurant, no matter how fancy.",JgKO1d7XiG1iqBNw3t0ptA,1,0,5,nxBdOBvtCOTwxqpIrSZ9Ug
1963033,2013-08-15,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Let me start out by saying this is one of the best steaks I've ever had!

This place is very bougie, so if you're looking to have a classy time, this is the place!  The interior reminds me of a man cave... like a very manly den back in the 50's!  I really loved that aspect of it.  The entire place is surrounded by huge windows to give you a great view............unless you're on the side facing the construction that's been sitting there for years.  Pretty sure they didn't bank on that happening when they built this place!

If you have an anniversary or other special occasion, they decorate your table all cute! Very romantic ;-)

Our server was amazing.  He was extremely friendly and didn't give off that snooty attitude that you sometimes get at fancy steak restaurants.  He explained the menu in detail, which usually I don't care for, but he was extremely helpful!  

I got the seared tenderloin with lobster.  Be aware that the portion size is very small (he informed me this dish was ""for the ladies,"" and when I asked him why he explained that it was on the smaller side, so I was prepared.  Thanks again, helpful server!).  Despite this, I could only eat half of it, which was a huge shame because I couldn't take my leftovers with me :(  This was one of the most delicious meals I've had in my entire life.  My boyfriend's steak was also completely to die for.  We topped that off with the lobster mac and cheese, and oh my gosh- it was a meal to remember.

The only forgettable part about it was the Creme Brûlée.  Maybe we got a bad one, but it tasted like dirt and was completely the wrong texture- kind of grainy.  The only part that tasted good was the glaze on the top, so we scraped that part off and left the rest.  We probably should have said something, but I hate doing that so we didn't.

TL;DR I highly recommend Capital Grille and will be back time and time again for a romantic date :)",clirF7pph8EPEoMtvrcj0w,0,0,5,y2JDjrGgC5uqqN1lrToN3g

The worst part? As I sit here writing this review I can't even remember exactly what I ordered - some steak..knowing me it was a fatty of a rib eye. A good 50 dollar piece of meat should leave an impression on me and not just on my wallet.

Of course the table was decorated when we got there and a handwritten note was waiting for us, with a wax seal.

We almost always order the same thing: lobster and crab cakes for an app, we both have a lettuce wedge for a salad.  I have the filet and the husband has the kona crusted ribeye.  We'll vary on what we have for dessert.

I love the Bohemian there - it's an awesome champagne drink that has raspberries in it.  It's almost worth a trip to the Grille just for that.

Anyway, our experience here was wonderful.  Our minor quibble is the lobster and crab cake weren't quite as good as we were used to, but everything else was spot on.  As they sometimes do, they came out with a complimentary dessert of a small cheesecake and espresso cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate.

I like to go to The Palm back home but they are not super kid friendly when it comes to the menu but Capital Grille had a few perfect selections for my picky kids (mac and cheese and chicken strips).  Our dinners were great and the service was perfect.

2087214,2015-07-06,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"As Las Vegas locals we visit this Capital Grille location a couple of times a year. 

First time we came here, we entered the Fashion Mall from the back entrance, hoping to find a place to eat that was a cut above a mall restaurant. We succeeded. The Capital Grill, located at the front of the mall, has a view of the Strip's Encore and Wynn hotels. I didn't have reservations, Yet, the restaurant was able to accommodate me and my partner despite a rather large party who took up most of the front part of the restaurant.

We also ate there last night for our anniversary and once again they did not disappoint. Starting with the reservationist, Mallory, the friendly greeting from the maître d' and the great Strip view from our table it was an outstanding experience. The service we received from our server Alex was exceptional. He asked about our time schedule and made sure we were on time for our show at The Wynn. We both decided on steak which is not always the case. I had the Delmonico while my wife had the sliced filet prepared with mushrooms and onions; both were delicious. The wedge salad was really nice as their blue cheese dressing is not overpowering. We tried the Truffle Fries for the first time and enjoyed them. Of course we had the stoli-doli which is their signature drink. Love them. 

A while ago we tried the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese and we found this dish to be amazing. The double-cut lamb chops were delicious and perfectly cooked, too. My wife marveled over this bone-in filet mignon with every bite. When we were first-time Capital Grille patrons, the restaurant sent us a complimentary dessert, which we matched with a dessert wine and a port. However, the coconut cream pie is our favorite dessert.

The wait staff were attentive and provided helpful suggestions on what to order. Those with large appetites will enjoy the steaks. Those with smaller appetites will likely take home a to-go bag.

Always make the experience. The food is great too. The wine list is good. Love the Meiomi Pinot. Salmon salad- grilled. Mmmm. Steaks are pretty good too. Recommend the coconut cream pie. It's more like a cookie custard.

Our Waiter was Charlie and he was a fantastic waiter. He really took care of us. 

I had the salmon which was great and cooked to perfection. My wife had the filet oscar and we were shocked as to how much crab meat that put on top of her steak! The steak was completely covered in this huge pile of delicious, sweet crab meat. It was almost a meal by itself! We could have split her dish. 

Most reviews mention the lobster Mac and cheese so we got that and yes, it is extremely delicious with big chunks of lobster. If we were to go back we would try something else though. 

This place is expensive. It is a steakhouse but even so it is probably $20 per person more than your local steakhouse... but you are on the Las Vegas Strip so that is what you get.

Regardless, I'm perfectly capable of remembering whether or not I placed an order. As such, I do not appreciate being argued with by my waiter and finally told that I would get what he thought I ordered and could deal with it then. When I finally got my well done New York Strip (yes I'm one of those people who doesn't enjoy my meat bleeding on my plate, terrible I know), I find that it is medium rare.

Because the cabs in Vegas are so dirty we wanted to be able to walk to a restaurant.  Since the Capital Grille is directly across the street from the Wynn Towers our choice was easily made.  We have never eaten at a Capital Grille, which , according to the manager Mathew Foody (yes, that is his real last name),  has 50 locations.  The entire meal was wonderful.  We first ordered the Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella.  It was so good and enhanced with the fresh bread basket.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  The cab was a 2009 Markham from Napa Valley.  At $48 I thought the price was very reasonable.  
After eating this large portioned appetizer we decided to split the dry aged Porterhouse steak.  Again we were not disappointed. Ordering it medium rare the meat melted in your mouth. The creamed spinach side was to die for. We passed on the desert menu and instead had an after dinner drink in their beautiful bar.  Jessica, our waitperson, was the best.

I called them at 7:30pm, and they graciously moved us back AND kept our requested strip view table reserved. WTG!

Service was impeccable. The Stoli Doli cocktail  was superb, as was the tenderloin with lobster tails. We also split the spinach bacon salad (great) and a side of grilled asparagus (allright).

For our anniversary, they presented us with a complimentary dessert sampler of cheesecake (Greatness!!!) and a flourless chocolate cake (great). We liked both of those better than the scrumptuous looking but not tasting Coconut pie. The pie was essentially maybe a 1/2"" layer of cream-cheese like consistency coconut flavored filling, not very sweet at all, toppedwith a massive pile of whipped cream and caramel sauce with a wafer thin huge coconut cookie. The toppings and cookie were better than the pie itself we thought. Go with the cheesecake instead.

Great place though! If I had to choose between this place and our ""Go To"" steak house (Del Frisco's), I'd have to give the edge to Del's. The steaks are probably equal, but their desserts, sides, and their similar pineapple infused vodka drink (the V.I.P. Martini) is better and much bigger.

""ABSOLUTELY"". It was priced well, he mentioned it was one of his favourites and since it was not the most pricey wine on the list, I trusted his recommendation. It was a fabulous pairing.

I have definitely been to Capital Grille on many other occasions and they have always been Great with a Capital G. I booked my reservation through yelp and received a call the day before to confirm. 
We were sat in the middle of the main floor and requested we be sat next to the window and they had zero problems accommodating us. 
Capital Grille is a real deal 5 Star steak dining experience. For brunch they offered a pre-fixed menu $50 a person with an option for endless mimosas or Bellini for $15.
We ordered the Steak and eggs which was cooked to perfection. If you go to Capital Grille and like steak it's definitely the way to go but if you are more of a pescatarian you can't go wrong eating at this place either. I always order the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake as an appetizer they have other great appetizers tuna carpaccio steak tartar amazing salads and more. I top that off with the surf n turf with mashed potatoes. 
The brunch menu was a treat since they aren't normally open for brunch but we ordered shrimp and grits along with the grill lobster on top of some delicious quiche yummmm! The lobster and shrimp portions were more than enough as I left very satisfied and full to say the least. Capital Grille you know I will be back.!",Jy3MoHeefnYoUWNrWii_Ow,6,3,5,4SceyyWbn8fpjkx-kaSp1g

I visited Las Vegas last year for thanksgiving with two friends and we had a really great dinner at Capital Grille. There was a mixup with the wine but it was all sorted out. 
Therefore we also made a reservation a month a head when we returned last week celebrating my birthday and were very excited about it.
We came a little early so our table weren't ready - fair enough. But then after waiting 20 min later than we book for we were seated in between the storage room and the restroom in an annex to the bar with televisions running and cellphones ringing off the hook. Not at all the atmosphere we experienced last time or what the prices reflects.
The waiter was not bad but was not very attentive probably because we were so remote from the actual dinning hall. Ordering over a month ahead this is unacceptable. Then they need to limit the amount they are taking in instead!
Also we again had issues with the wine,but this time it wasn't sorted out. So I had an undrinkable Riesling that I still paid for.
When we were paying the waiter was very focused on getting her 15 % tips. I know that tips are almost mandatory in the us in contrary to where we from, and I don't mind paying them. But I still prefer that you still feel like it voluntary.

The ambiance was classy and romantic plus you get some great views of the strip. Came here on a late Sunday night and my boyfriend and I were completely satisfied with the food and service.

Decided to get some soup and salad before our entrees.
My boyfriend got the Wedge with Bleu Cheese and Applewood Smoked Bacon.
I got their special of the day...month? Creamy Potato Leek Soup. My waitress described it as an Au Gratin Potatoes in soup form. Anything potatoes I love so this was freakin fantastic!!!! I can't believe I chose that over Lobster Bisque. 

I've heard so much about that infamous Lobster Mac n Cheese so I decided to get that as my entree. And yum....it's as good as everyone raved it to be!!!!!! They didn't skim you on the lobster either...4-5 big chunks that just melts in your mouth. 
My boyfriend decided to try something different than what he normally goes for. He got the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Filet Mignon with Cabernet Reduction and he really enjoyed it. He even said he would definitely do a repeat of this.

Valet service for Capital Grille is right around the corner from Top Shop and Forever 21. You just take the elevators up and it takes you right there to the restaurant. Very convenient.

I am impressed by this because I was expecting a table with a view that I requested since we were having a late dinner, but not the decorated table because I thought it was usually birthdays and anniversaries that  are given this.  We definitely had a nice view of the Las Vegas Strip.  Our waiter, Eric, was amazing!  He was very attentive to us even though he had to tend to a number of tables.  He took the time to explain how we can go through the wine list via a tablet.  He also suggested food items that we might enjoy and so we ordered some of these items and wow....delicious I must say!  Everything we ordered was very tasty...fresh oysters on a half shell, lobster bisque, kona rib eye, chilean sea bass, lobster mac and cheese, and brussel spouts!  Of course we couldn't eat everything so we brought it back to our hotel and stored it in the fridge for late night snacking.  Each item we brought back was boxed and labeled with the name of the food item and the bag had an attached label signed by the chef.  Wow!  Never seen that before and we've been fine dining forever.  Last but not least...we ordered the coconut dessert the I saw people raving about and it was exactly what I expected! Yummy!  To make it even better, Eric said it was on the house due to my promotion!

Last night at the bar I was with one of my best girlfriend of 27 years. We both were sitting at the bar. The bartenders never asked if we wanted a drink except when I first got there and wanted water while waiting for my friend. Once she arrived we had to flag down the bartender and he strangely enough only took her drink order and not mine. It was the same experience when I had to get the bartender in order to place my food order. He never asked me after even 30 minutes what I wanted to order. He proceeded to take my order and then not ask my girlfriend what she would like. It was very odd?! Each time our glass was empty they never bothered to ask if we wanted another one. This is a fancy place yet they didn't bother with giving us a cocktail napkin either. They were too busy taking care of groups with all men. We truly felt we were being ignored because we were women. The manager did take care of our bill. He wanted to make it right. Then he stuck his foot in his mouth with a non business like apology. Instead of acknowledging our feelings and saying I hope you give us another chance he chose to say his staff is excellent and didn't intend to ignore us. I was so polite saying his staff was very nice just not attentive at all to us but very attentive to all the men that sat after myself. 
I love their food but after the way we were treated will not be going back. Frankly the manager was more concerned with checking bar tickets then taking the time to address our concerns.

Excellent service from Mike Sabini who gave me his card to request him next time. Who knew you could do that?  Anyway, got a nice table with a view of the strip. The lobster bisque was very nice, good ceaser salad and the filet Oscar style was fantastic.

2878368,2018-03-22,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"This restaurant is amazing. I hardly ever give out five stars to a restaurant, but Capital Grille deserves it. Located where all the restaurants are outside Fashion Show Mall and on the second floor is Capital Grille. Upon walking in you are greeted with a very warm welcome from the staff and we were quickly seated. No matter where you get seated in the restaurant there is a nice view of the strip. First and foremost, our server Robert was very attentive and took great care of us. I asked if I could see the alcohol menu and he gave me this neat little tablet to show all the alcohol they had. Unfortunately I couldn't find my favorite alcoholic beverage on there, which is the Midori sour, so I asked Robert what was the closest thing they had to Midori sour. Luckily Robert told me not to worry as he stated they have basically every alcohol in stock. 

Now for the food:

We ordered

-Calamari: Extremely yummy and full of flavors, an excellent appetizer.

-Bone in Kona: Prepared perfectly and packed with full of flavor.

-Bone in ribeye steak: Prepared perfectly, couldn't get any better.

-Scallops: Pure yumminess and you can taste the freshness.

-Seared tenderloin with two lobster tails: On the chef specials, HIGHLY recommend.

-Filet Mignon: Prepared perfectly just like all the other steaks, no sauce needed!

-Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese: Just get it. I could eat a bucket of it.

-Roasted Mushrooms: Love mushrooms and putting some on top of your steak just makes it even better.

-Creamed Spinach: TONS of flavor and when paired with your steak and roasted mushrooms, you experience taste to a whole new level.

Overall, Capital Grille is a very well managed restaurant as we had reservations at 7:45 and the place was PACKED yet everything ran smoothly and Robert kept checking on us to make sure if everything came out right.

Pros:

+Staff is very attentive
+Steak is prepared just how you requested it
+Beautiful view of the strip
+Haven't tried the whole menu but everything sounds good
+Very nice date spot
+Staff is very professional

Cons:

-Place is a bit pricey (but well worth the price)
-Place can be a bit hard to find if you're not familiar on where to park as it is on the Strip.",hMwPqwbNQV94fWSBhM4QaQ,3,1,5,ZI3D5PyShrs9fiLMEfUUag

Enter The Capital Grille. This was a slam dunk of a 5 star experience in every way and left me satisfied after an incredible meal and great memories with great friends! 

(+) Service was outstanding! Our server for the evening, Mr Mike S., was helpful, attentive, and personable! He provided great details on options and details of different menu items. Actually everybody was great! Our drinks were always refilled in a timely fashion. The hostess was very friendly and engaging. Absolutely great service all across the board!
(+) Food was absolutely incredible! I opted for the 24 ounce porterhouse ($55) cooked medium rare and it was sheer perfection! So juicy and tender. One of, if not the best, steak I've ever enjoyed in my life!

Plus I can't say enough good things about that Lobster Mac and Cheese!($19)  It absolutely melts in your mouth and I could have had several more portions easily! lol I cannot wait to have that again!
(+) The room is absolutely elegant and cozy with great views of the strip to admire and appreciate! We were fortunate enough to be placed at a corner table where we all enjoyed the striking views of the strip all lit up at night!
(+) We were there to celebrate my birthday and they added some really nice touches to the meal, such as confetti on the table and a nice card thanking you for spending the occasion there. It was quite nice. Plus, at the end of the night, they brought me a nice dessert tray with some awesome cheese cake and chocolate souffle! Very rich and very tasty!

This wasn't just a meal, but an experience! I simply loved my time here and am already making plans when we can go back! I cannot recommend experiencing this establishment strongly enough! Just do it!

The service was phenomenal. They knew it was our anniversary and they had rose petals and a card laid out for us on our table. The card read ""thank you for celebrating with us, from the Capital Grill."" The server even came up to us and gave us some complimentary sparkling wine for our celebration. I was in awe at how well we were treated. 

I ordered the veal and my bf ordered the lamb chops. We opted for creamed spinach and Au gratin potatoes for our sides. 

While we waited for the food (which was a pretty quick wait) they gave us a complimentary bread assortment which was pretty tasty. 

The food came out and I astonished; It looked so delicious! And boy did it taste even better! Both of our plates were bursting with flavor, and the sides were an awesome compliment. 

The server checked up on us every 10 minutes or so to fill up our glasses and make sure everything was perfect. When we were almost done with our plates he told us to save some room because they had a ""surprise"" for us. Of course that put a couple big smiles on our faces!

We were just about done with our food when the server brought out a center cut piece of creme brulee cheesecake with a candle placed right in the middle for us. He said it was on the house from Capital Grill and that they hoped we really enjoyed our anniversary. 

Mmmm, that cheesecake was sooo delicious! My mouth is drooling just thinking about it!

The chain holds to consistent standards of excellence, known for their on-premises dry-aged prime cuts and superior service. The Las Vegas location holds up its end of the deal.   
The atmosphere is what I'd call ""hunt club"" - dark rich woods, elegant but not overstated decor (in this location the unique feature is painted potraits of famous local entertainers). This location adds a 3rd-story view of the Wynn casino and surrounding neighborhood.  
Service is imbeccable - timely, welcoming, classy, attentive, & knowledgable about fine cuisine.  Although the atmosphere is elegant and cuisine very high-end, the staff make you feel right at home (even if you arrived in merely a dressy casual fashion). A special mention is deserved for our waiter David.  
Ah, but ultimately it's about the food. Let's start off with the Procuitto-wrapped mozzarella appetizer, served over mildly-oiled toasted crisps with cherry tomatoes and banana peppers. The combo of textures and flavors was on the money. My friend had the steak au pouvre with courvosier sauce. I'm not generally a big pepper steak fan but the tenderness, the rich sauce, and the just-right touch of pepper were a winner. My porcini-rubbed Delmonico may be the most exquisite such cut I've ever had; cooked to a PERFECT medium, melt-in-your-mouth juicy, with a delicate sweetness from the rub. Wow!  I somehow found a way to eat the whole cut. 
Desert for me consisted of a homemade DARK chocolate ice cream that was so rich it should have come with bodyguards. A hint of mousse-like quality but clearly ice cream. Exquisite! 
Overall: As my buddy Matt put it, an experience for all the senses. If the opportunity arises, I WILL return, as I have to the Captial Grille in Denver. My compliments to the staff, and Bon apetite to you lovers of fine cuisine!",QZ94k87I4FO8b1uvzmjaKQ,1,0,5,pKS5_6yNgxjyVptI6erDIA

This place is a very manly steakhouse. Don't take your group of girls there!

It's all about fat hunks of aged beef grilled at extremely high temps and charred on the outside. Enjoy with a nice full Cabernet...

If you dare... the French onion soup (crock only please) is the BEST I've ever had (when I'm there on a good night... even when not it's excellent). 

Go there with the guys and order what I always did... not on the menu anymore... 20 oz. NY Strip medium rare. If they say it's not on the menu insist! Don't worry about the size, take the rest home for a steak sandwich tomorrow... the key is the thickness of the meat. More like a mini roast that allows the outside to be nice and charred while the entire center is a really nice red.

The food was extremely consistent with your Long Island location, and needless to say, we were all delighted.

The steaks were cooked to perfection, the sides were very generously portioned, and even when we were not thrilled about how our Lobster Tails came out, Ralph made sure that those that were not up to par were replaced and brought out fresh and hot.

They have an amazing pineapple infused vodka drink called the Stoli Doli, sounds a bit silly but it's actually quite good. They marinate fresh pineapple and infuse it with Vodka and serve it as a martini. Tasty and not too sweet. 
As for the food, it was good, typical steakhouse fair, the seafood tower was very good, albeit pricey at $96 but it worked great for the 6 of us as an appetizer. 
The Lobster Bisque was a winner and the chopped salad was good but not great. 
I ordered the Filet and it was on par with what a good steakhouse should deliver. For sides we ordered mushrooms, potatoes au gratin, lobster Mac and cheese, and string beans. All sides were good but not home runs. Service was average and they seemed ill prepared for the convention business. They made up for it by bringing us a desert sampler that was tasty but we were already stuffed. 
The single biggest complaint is the parking, it's far and walking to the location as I did from my hotel was no simple task.",Fy71pENHo8QeE39MO55ZDw,2,3,4,e5_s6phIp-rasmb8o-0xzA

Upon arriving we were kindly greeted by a gentleman and a young lady who checked us in! I requested a table near the window so we could take in the fantastic views of the strip! We were briefed on our table being ready in a few moments and invited to have a few drinks at the bar! I asked the bartender what was a popular drink and he suggested the ""Stolli Dolli"" YUCK! I don't know how that drink could even be on the menu as a favorite but then again to each is own right? Anyways I went with my regular Hennessy & Sprite and we also ordered a mojito.. Both drinks were just ""OK"" and for $29 I wouldn't expected a lot more needless to say that bar experience was not as good as the dining experience!

3146632,2011-03-27,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Beautiful, elegant restaurant with an amazing view. Located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall facing the Wynn/Encore, the restaurant's location can be a bit of a journey to find as there is no entrance to the restaurant inside the mall. There is only one door- the front door which is outside- that leads you inside the restaurant, but the food, service & ambiance make the journey worthwhile. 

The restaurant itself is romantic and classic, with mahogany accents and warm lighting, perfect for a date night or special celebration. The night I went was very busy. I made a 7:30 reservation for a party of 4 earlier in the day, and even though I arrived on time, the rest of my party was running a bit late. Thankfully, the hostess didn't cancel our reservation, and said that they would set up our table once everyone in my party arrived. That was just the beginning of the outstanding service my party and I experienced that night at The Capital Grille. 

We were seated in a booth next to the floor-to-ceiling windows that encase a good portion of the restaurant. Our server was wonderful- very attentive, knowledgable and energetic. After bringing out our drinks and the bread basket (an assortment of rolls, crackers, etc.), without asking us, he brought us an appetizer of Shrimp Cocktail, saying he thought we would enjoy it. Enjoy it we did. The shrimp were fresh and plump, and the cocktail sauce had a kick. Very good! 

For the main course, I ordered the Lobster and Crab Stuffed Shrimp- Delicately butterflied shrimp stuffed with fresh lobster and crab, lightly breaded, and roasted with a touch of wine. Good, but not ""Oh my goodness, you've got to try this!"" amazing. I enjoyed the flavorful, meaty filling, but I found the dish a bit dry. It would have been better with more of the creamy sauce. 

The rest of my party ordered:
Double Cut Lamb Rip Chops- Four, flavorful double cut rib chops with a side of fruit chutney (cherry, I think). The portion size was perfect, and the owner of this dish seemed to enjoy it, as nothing was left on the plate.

Cedar Planked Salmon with Tomato Fennel Relish- A fillet of North Atlantic salmon seasoned with fennel pollen, roasted on a cedar plank and finished with lemon mosto and Tomato Fennel Relish. The fillet size was shockingly large, and while the salmon was fresh, the dish lacked seasoning (due to the simple preparation of the fish, which I'm guessing was to highlight the natural flavor of the fresh salmon). 

Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak- 24-oz. dry-aged steak. Recommended by our server. The portion was enormous, and while there was a lot of meat, it wasn't the best quality of steak (as noted by the owner of this dish). 

Side order of Parmesan Truffle Fries-  Golden fries tossed in shredded Grana Padano, kosher salt and white truffle oil. Crunchy, savory and the truffle flavor wasn't too overpowering. I really enjoyed this side.

Side order of Fresh Asparagus with Hollandaise- Garden fresh asparagus cooked al dente to a most delicate crispness, and served with their own Hollandaise sauce. 

Side order of Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms- A hearty blend of mushrooms (Portabella, Oyster, Shiitake, and Cremini), slowly oven roasted with extra virgin olive oil, rosemary, thyme and garlic butter. Delicious. 

We also ordered dessert and coffee to finish the meal. Our server recommended the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Cream- A blend of strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries in a velvety smooth Creme Anglaise. The dessert was light and not too sweet- a perfect way to end a memorable night.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,7,3,5,ekoKTEZDtAMLe1zTk7RZjw

Yes, it's a good steakhouse from a chain of good steakhouses, but the Strip has plenty of good steakhouses that don't take 30 minutes to get a ride back to the hotel while limo drivers try to hustle you for a ride.

Oysters were good, but nobody stopped to explain if they were pemaquid or kumamoto., and left before we could ask. The seared tenderloins were super tough. Filet  mignon was good. Sauteed mushrooms needed salt, the asparagus was overcooked. The only high point of the meal was the lobster mac' n cheese. Absolutely delicious with perfect crumb topping.

They immediately brought bread and butter to the table. When our waiter came, he asked us the usual question what would we like to drink. I asked him for a non-alcoholic drink. He looked at me and said they don't have much choices for non-alcoholic so what do I want. I was kind of offended at his tone so I ended up ordering non-alcoholic mojito.
The menu option seems very tasty. I ended up ordering a New York strip steak. My husband ordered bone in ribeye. We also ordered the Truffle fries, and the creamed spinach. However when the meals came to the table. Both of our states were not to the desired temperature. My dear husband wanted his medium rare and it was well done. I ordered a medium and mine was also almost well done. Very disappointed.
The manager discounted us 1 Stake. And offered us desert. It was our anniversary anyway so they gave us the usual complementary type desert. So we opted for that rather than ordering a separate dessert ( but there was a bug just travelling across our plate). It was our anniversary as I said and I was pretty disappointed.

Considering how many restaurants are all over the strip of Las Vegas - it was quite a sight when the whole place was packed with patrons.

I had a company dinner here so we shared:

-Lobster mac n cheese - I've had better. It would've been nice if the lobster flavor was stronger. I've had better lobster mac n cheese in NY where we would get chunks of lobster. It tasted like ordinary mac n cheese with the lobster absent from the dish
-Au Gratin Potatoes - average
-Lobster and Crab Cake - served with a sweet corn relish this crabcake was on par with most crab cake but we hardly tasted any lobster
-Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers - the hot cherry peppers was a nice spin to the calamari but the batter was too thick on the calamari
-French Green Beans with Shallots and Heirloom Tomatoes - nice but the green beans were a bit stiff
-Parmesan Truffle Fries - the skirt fries were overfried and you could hardly taste any truffle - again - i've had better

and I ordered the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year Aged Balsamic  - The balsamic really stood out which was the purpose of the dish but i was rather disappointed that without the balsamic  - the steak was rather bland.

I celebrated NYE here and it was great they were still taking dinner reservations even on NYE night.  I would also take advantage of the offer valet service next to the Forever 21 entrance.  There is a quick elevator that will take you straight to the 3rd floor and into the restaurant.   I was greeted immediately with a smile and escorted to a window table facing the strip per my special request during my reservation.  

I was impressed with the food too.   We ordered the seared salmon, miso sea bass, south African steak, truffle fries, lobster mac and cheese, and a lobster tail served with butter.  My favorite was the south African steak and the miso sea bass.   It was prepared very tendered and you can taste the freshness with every bite.  

Our server, Les Forehand, was exceptional.  He made a good recommendation on our entrees and checked on us quite frequently to ensure we are enjoying our celebration.   He also made sure our drinks are always refiled without our request.   Now the most impressive service i received was his talent in taking pictures of us.   The lighting in the restaurant was dimmed, so he knew the pictures would com out dark.  To ensure our pictures had the perfect lighting, Les immediately grabbed his phone so he can use the flashlight while taking our pictures.  I was so impressed with his help and he did a good job capturing good shots for us.

We had visions of walking through the food court to find this restaurant.  It turns out that it has its own private entrance.  This may sound petty to some, but when you are spending a lot of money for a meal, the last thing you want is to be walking by Panda Express on your way in the door.  The restaurant has a lovely view of the Wynn, and we could see the mountains to the north from our booth.  

The service and food was outstanding.  I can't say enough good things about our server, Francisco.  He recommended the ""Summer Generous Pour"" --  a flight of eight wines -- three whites and five reds.   A two-ounce pour of each wine is served at different stages of your meal.  We especially liked the Chardonnay, and Francisco was happy to pour us a little more.  My husband drank Scotch.  We made just one order of the wine sampling and found it was plenty for the two of us.

My husband ordered the NY strip with the Gorgonzola and truffle crust with a Cabernet reduction.  It was cooked medium rare to perfection.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass in a tomato and saffron broth.  The fish was flaky and tender.  The broth was deliciously savory without being overpowering.  This dish was a lovely, light, and flavorful dish for those who seek alternatives to steak.  We split a side of creamed spinach, noting the smoky hints of nutmeg.  The consistency was just right, being neither too stiff nor too runny.

We finished the meal with the coconut cream pie.  It was very good but, as a coconut dessert fan, a tad underwhelming.  If you want the bomb coconut dessert in Vegas, have the coconut cake at Mesa Grill.

The service was outstanding at Capital Grill.  We didn't want to be rushed and told Francisco that we wanted to take our time.  Dining to us is an experience that should be savored.  Pun intended.    It pains us to see Americans come in to upscale restaurants, scarf down dinner in 45 minutes, and leave.  If you have a show to go to in Vegas and also want a special dinner, have dinner after the show.  It's a crime to have dinner at a place like Capital Grill and choke down a meal in under an hour.

We will absolutely be back to Capital Grill and recommend it to anyone seeking a special meal where you will be attended to as if you were royalty.",ot3mk9K86PsghYScRWtd8A,0,0,5,jkes9FYjEaDZIc2_ooye7w

I had the summer sea bass and I wanted to lick my plate and would have done so with a few more pineapple martinis or another bottle of wine. The piece of fish was ginormous and delicious. Seared perfectly. 
The salmon was excellent, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It didnt have a sauce so no need to lick the plate. 
Charles was our waiter. He talked with his hands, very passionate, appreciated his enthusiasm and professionalism. 
I gave it 5 stars because it was a great dining experience with excellent service. We wanted to sit by the window and people watch the strip, but after awhile, we forgot the strip was below us. 

Definitely a go to place while in Vegas. You can walk off your meal at the mall and spend some more money. Why not. Better than putting it down a strippers g string??? Or is it?????",UnYQUerYracJyW9c56Oo6A,0,1,5,YXtFSTjWI3jZS1tpCGKi_Q

The spinach salad was great, nice hot dressing but the spinach wasn't too wilted either. Bacon bits were good.
I had the steak, of course, which was just a little bit beyond medium rare but very good anyway. I do think their spices on the steaks are not as good as other steakhouses but the meat is great.

I made the reservation for 6:45 however I forgot the time and turned it at 7:00 and they happily seated us which was a nice bonus. Parking was bit of a hassle but after that everything worked out.

I had the salad for starter and it was perfectly dressed and seasoned and my partner ordered the soup which was really good too. They provide a great selection of breads too that went down a treat.

They have a huge winelist which made it somewhat difficult to decide on what wine to get. There is a strong focus on american wines.

For entree I ordered the dry aged porterhouse steak - 24 oz and my partner got the seared sirloin & butter poached lobster., both were cooked perfectly and surprisingly tasty for the price, combine with the lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach were a great addition to the steak.

We got the desserts which were chef's seasonal fruit sorbet a nice, light ending to any meal..

For the main, I had the tenderloin and lobster.  It was really flavorful but the lobster didn't really seem necessary.  hubby got the crab stuff shrimp which was also VERY good.  The tartar sauce we SUPER yummy! 

For the side, we got the brussel sprouts which tasted overly smokey.  I wouldn't get them again.

It's a simple drink with not a lot of bite, but don't be fooled into thinking it's not potent. The concoction is allowed to sit for over a week in a large glass jar, which makes the vodka taste sweet and smooth. And it goes down easy, maybe a little too easy.

After hanging out at the bar for a bit our party of four got a table in the dining room. While not my top choice of steakhouses in Las Vegas, The Capital Grille is still a good, dependable place to eat. It's a national chain and we've tried other locations before (in DC). It's got an old-fashioned, buttoned-up steakhouse feel. The kind of place that is perfect for the power lunch crowd.

As for the food, most of what we had was very good. The calamari was excellent and crispy. The lobster and crabcakes had large chunks of both crab and lobster with not much filler. The lobster bisque was a little on the bland side. The chopped salad was by far the worse thing we ate. I could pick leaves and weeds from my back yard, toss them in a dish and it would taste similar to their salad. All the steaks (delmonico, filet, and filet oscar) we had were perfectly cooked and seasoned and very tender. For desert we had the chocolate hazelnut cake, obnoxiously big and large enough for four people to share, it was deliciously chocolatey, sweet and moist.

Our waiter did a solid job the whole night, except when the check arrived. He accidentally rung up another tables order on ours. So our bill was over $100 more than expected. For a restaurant of this caliber and a staff that is this well trained that type of error should never happen. But our waiter was quick to correct it and apologized profusely. Not the best way to end dinner, but it still didn't take away from the fact that the food is very good, although very traditional and conservative.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,2,4,Up7LUGqHxWzrg-PJjVX0gw

Also, the crab cakes were phenomenal.  The steaks were all made to perfection.  They know how to make a steak !  If you ask for it well done, they don't roll their  eyes and tell you that you're ruining it, or that the chef is going to be mad at you.  Good restaurants know how to make a well done steak tender AND juicy.   I had the  Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic, medium well done.  It was one of the best steaks I ever had.

sides - cream of corn. i absolutely love CORN. but anything creamed sounds disgusting. THIS WAS THE BEST FUCKING CORN SIDE I'VE EVER HAD. i could eat this all day. i could have this as an entree. its seasonal. so get it while you can.

3684849,2008-08-18,2,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Let me preface my statements by saying that I love the Denver Capital Grill as much as I hate the Vegas Cap Grille.
Since they have been taken over by the Olive Garden people, I did write management, so I'll update the review once I hear back from corporate.

So why no love for the Vegas location??
To begin with, our lousy waiter.  He complained to us the whole time.  
Save it buddy.  I'm out in 110 Vegas heat, and want a cool, inviting experience.  Even though we told him we're Denver regulars, he treated us like tourists.  Ignored us for a couple of local women who obviously drink there often.
Our service went from bad to horrible after I ordered the $13 glass of wine instead of the $23 glass he recommended.  
Up sell someone else.  I know my wines, and will not pay $23 a glass for a $23 a bottle of wine.   ( I know...I know, my $13 a glass is $13 a bottle, but we all have our price points).
Bad service aside, my lobster bisque was lukewarm at best; globby and mediocre.  The sherry accompaniment never came, so we had to flag the waiter.  10 minutes later, someone from the kitchen brought it.  By that time, the soup was really cold.
The BF's burger was perfect cooked -- medium rare and huge.
However the fries were inedible.  

The waiter never appeared with the check, so I flagged him down on my way to the rest room, and signed on my way back.
Unfortunately, he kept my credit card...
I've always said, customer service will either make or break a business, and the way the Capital Grille handled the error is 1 star.
The next day I returned for the card ( a $40 round trip cab ride).  The manager who was holding the card was tacky; not in a hurry to return the card, so we sat down for lunch.  
Finally he arrived at our table, and had the nerve to suggest I offer a reward.
Reward???
How about tearing up the check for the previous day.  Or at least comping up lunch that day.  Your waiter caused us great inconvenience, and for what?  A mediocre lunch, terrible service, and a huge price tag.

I'm hoping that corporate has a better 'tude, since I still want to patronize the Denver location

ps
We were ""invited"" back for lunch......AT THE VEGAS LOCATION.
Sure, let me jump in my corporate jet and lunch in Vegas.
Thanks for nothing.
Typical Olive Garden mentality....that's what Darden Corporation is making the Cap Grille.

We normally stay away from the craziness of the Strip since we live in Vegas but after looking at their website and having received a $50 off gift card from American Express we decided to give it a try.

After a little confusion as to where the front entrance was located we were promptly seated in a corner that allowed us a panoramic view of the strip which was beautiful as we were right across from the Wynn.  It was lunch time however they were not very busy, quiet atmosphere and very comfortable. Our server was very attentive and pleasant. 

I normally shy away from crab cakes as I have been sorely disappointed in the past--too much breading or too greasy. However our server explained that their Lobster & Crab Cakes are pan seared then baked in the oven and ""wonderful"". And she was correct. I thoroughly enjoyed them  as they had large chucks of both lobster & crab and not just shredded pieces. For my lunch entree I decided on the Main Lobster Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette which was just as enjoyable. The vinaigrette was light and truly accented the taste of the lobster which included large chunks of lobster as well as the claw meat.  I would certainly order both again... 

My husband ordered a steak with mashed potatoes- his steak was cooked to order and he very much enjoyed his selection as well. 

We are planning on returning as there were several other items that peaked our interest especially on the dinner menu. I am hoping our night time visit is just as relaxing and enjoyable.

This was the last stop of our ""Vegas Food Tour"" before we trotted our butts back to Los Angeles. We decided to go here because they were apart of restaurant week and they were offering the most diverse selection on their pre-fixed menu compared to other places participating. It was $30.10 per person for a 3-course lunch.

My first impressing upon walking in to this place was... ""YOU FANCY HUH?!?!"" Its located in the fashion show mall, so I wasn't really expecting anything super fancy, but it was. White table clothes, dark wood, wine glasses, and lunch having executives. We were greeted by the host, a not so friendly older lady, who didn't really give us the impression that she wanted us to eat there. But we shrugged it off and the service actually ended up being pretty good. 

1st course:
I went for the clam chowder. This dish was actually a pleasant surprise due to its copious amounts of clams. It had a nice creamy but not too oily soup base with my oh so favorite oyster crackers! The GF went for the french onion soup. I wasn't much of a fan, I thought it was a bit too salty but she on the other hand likes that kinda thing so she loved it. It was the run of the mill french onion soup IMHO.

2nd course:
She was starving so she opted for the The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger with truffle fries. This was a very large sirloin patty with smoked bacon, sweet onions, and havarti cheese on an onion roll. If you have an appetite I would most likely suggest this burger because its huge. The truffle fries were delish and friend to perfection. I went for the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon. It was a large filet of salmon seared to perfection over some asparagus and onions. It was probably one of the most juiciest salmons I've ever had. 

3rd course:
We went for the usual creme brulee which I think is pretty much the same at most locations. Its pretty hard to do a creme brulee wrong, but of course Capital Grille's was ginormous. And we also got the Strawberries Capital Grille that consisted of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream topped with Grand Marnier. This was mediocre, some sweeter strawberries probably would have helped the cause.

For what we paid, we definitely got a deal with the enormous portions they served. It was a nice place but the food wasn't super memorable. Dinner may be a different story.",pUmTc6CSKsQMbHgk4ZWvIQ,2,1,3,yMxhIBf7PBWYnFZw9Jx3KQ

I had the Chilean Sea Bass as the main.  The fish itself was a little dry and boring but when sprinkled with the broth is quite delicious despite how I usually do not like soy sauce.  I shared/split my portion with another associate at the table so I also got to try bone-in rib eye steak which was ver juicy.  The steak was requested as medium rare though maybe half of it was cooked rare instead.

We also had asparagus and soy glazed bacon brussels sprouts.  The asparagus was cooked to the point where too many stalks were blackened, dry, and crunchy while the sprouts were glazed too intensely with soy sauce in my opinion.

Desserts were as expected.

In summary, for the price one would expect all of the dishes to be cooked and taste properly AND, our waiter stole the electronic drink menu/tablet plaything from me.",w8xOsHgh3xi4pHKO1Fs5Dw,0,0,3,qAXFVF5tAtKgj2qufmoa4Q

For drinks my boyfriend ordered a beer and Erik suggested a pineapple infused vodka drink that was served straight up in a chilled martini glass. It was delicious. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet. 

For appetizers, we ordered the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. Erik added some sherry to my lobster bisque at the table that really brought out the rich flavor of the soup. I had a couple bites of the wedge salad and it was crisp and refreshing. Both were perfect portions.

For our entrees we had the Delmonico steak which is their bone in rib eye and the Filet Oscar which was a filet topped with blue crab meat and a Bearnaise sauce served with asparagus spears. Both entrees tasted amazing. The rib eye had excellent flavor and even the slight char from the grill tasted good. The crab meat on the Fillet Oscar was sweet and the flavors flowed together perfectly.

We also shared the sides of creamed spinach and creamy mashed potatoes. They complimented our meals nicely and tasted really fresh.

We were too stuffed to try dessert but I had my eye on every creme brulee that passed by. Next time I will make sure to save room for it. We ended our meal with a coffee and an espresso.

The manager stopped by our table to ask how our meal was which is always a nice touch to see managers engaging with the guests dining in their establishment. There is also a great sense of teamwork among the servers. Many times I saw other servers clearing tables that weren't their own or grabbing dirty dishes out of another server's hands while he was at another table speaking with his guests. It's nice to see the wait staff help each other out and care about the appearance of the restaurant and the service being provided to all guests, not just their own.

3877247,2017-10-18,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"When I think of business dinners, I think of Capital Grille. The dish that stands out the most at this steakhouse is the NY strip. The bone-in Kona coffee-crusted dry aged NY strip with shallot butter is a must try. For an off-the-bone option, try the 14 oz. NY strip au poivre with courvoisier cream. Both are delicious with their accompanying sauces. The earthy roasted wild mushrooms are the perfect side. I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the green beans.

For appetizers, the steak tartare was beautifully prepared. The lobster and crab cakes are small in size, but the side of roasted corn was delicious. Like any fine steakhouse, there's a great wedge salad. The bleu cheese isn't too overwhelming and the smoked bacon is more cubed than crumbs. 

Save room for dessert because the cheesecake brûlée is excellent and even better than the classic creme brûlée. The flourless chocolate espresso cake is a rich and decadent gluten-free option that is sure to please both gluten and non-gluten eaters alike. All around, the service is top notch and the drinks are great too. Unlike a lot of steakhouses on the Strip, most of their steaks are reasonably priced in the $50 range.

My buddy had the New York well-done; it came out medium rare.

Here's the rule: when a steakhouse can't get a steak right, plus can't get a burger right, it has no right to exist, especially in the steakhouse/burger hub of the west coast.

And by the way, we pointed it out to the manager showing her the burger and the steak; she took note, feigned concern and then charged for both of them anyway.

3912863,2018-01-25,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"My husband and I rarely get to treat ourselves out to a night alone without the kids, we decided to celebrated our 8 year anniversary here. Reservations were convenient to make on line and a confirmation email and phone call the day before followed. During the reservation process they asked  us to tell them about ourselves, if it was a special occasion and I was please to see upon our arrival that we were seated immediately and the table was sprinkled with Heart confetti with a personalized note wishing us a happy anniversary, nice extra touch. 

We ordered the following : 
- PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED MOZZARELLA - This was AMAZING!!
- PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - We did not care for these at all. Wish I would have gone with another potato side.
- SOY GLAZED BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH BACON- My husband was reluctant to try Brussel Sprouts but they were delicious and he liked them!
- PORCINI RUBBED BONE-IN RIBEYE WITH 15-YEAR AGED BALSAMIC - I ordered this and it was so flavorful and tender, I loved it!!!
- BONE IN FILET MIGNON - This was one of the specials so my husband decided to try it. I must say that he was not impressed at all. I tasted the steak was and it was a bit dry and overall the taste was nothing to brag about, nothing special at all!
- COCONUT CREAM PIE - WOW, What a way to finish our meal! This was to die for! A soft dump cake like crust filled with yummy coconut cream then topped with whipped cream, drizzled with some type of rum sauce then finished with a thin crispy sugar cookie!

Aside from the nice note at the beginning, the service was NOT ""as gracious as it is attentive"" as stated on their website. Our waiter was subpar, he rattled off the specials and suggested items like it was the thousandth time he had done so that day!  He seemed to be attending to several tables but I could help but notice that he was paying more attention to those tables as they were ordering alcoholic drinks were as my husband and I did not. We had to ask another waiter for steak knives when our food arrived. Too bad because even with the few food items we were not impressed with I would have given them a 4 star but I just could not because of the substaservice.",ZynEwuw_AZCVHyKIt1XO3w,0,1,3,M353eVVXyN-evLKAQiPwOQ

They had a gluten free menu and our server Ryan talked me through all the options. He also helped with the specials if I could have them or not. 

Most of us had the dry aged New York strip which was moist and flavorful with absolutely no seasonings, it didn't need any! The asparagus was well cooked and the mashed potatoes were super creamy. Decadent and gluten free! They also have gluten free flourless chocolate cake, which was pretty good. I had to scrape off the excess coco powder. 

It was my friends birthday and they gave her a cheesecake and a flourless cake, which she accidentally spilled water on and they replaced. So nice!

Steakhouses are a dime a dozen in Vegas.  But you already know that.  Seems like there's one on every corner waiting for you to cough up $50+ a pop.  There isn't much to set this place apart from the rest besides the nationally-recognized name (nothing against chains, but I'm just making a point).  

The beef here is pretty consistent.  (It never ceases to amaze me at how many times I've had overcooked steak).  I always order the rib eye and on two separate visits, both times med rare was med rare.  Win!  I also tried a friend's kona coffee rubbed rib eye: yet another example of why you should never pay extra to put crap that ruins/asks the flavor of a good slab of beef.

On my latest trip we had creamed spinach, mushrooms and the lobster mac & cheese.  Creamed spinach was tasty, mushrooms were acceptable, but the mac and cheese was winners!  Next time, I think we'll just have three orders of that.

Aside from the mac and cheese, the one thing that really stood out was the pineapple infused vodka.  Well slap me silly and call me Susan; this stuff is B-O-M-B.  For this drink alone, it is worth at least hitting up the bar.  Also, they have an ok corkage policy.  I think it was $35/bottle, with a two bottle max.

All in all, though, a martini and a side dish aren't enough to really warrant handing over a wad of my cash for a middle of the road steakhouse.  Sure, it's better than Outback, but with competition right across the street, this place has room for improvement.  Just my humble opinion.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,4,3,3,0pm5TyWrQuZsLrRruCSsZw

Server was nice and informative. We started with drinks I think it was a pineapple martini, it was ok, we're not big drinkers so the alcohol was strong and we only had one that we could barely finish lol
 -appetizer hubby got a spinach salad which he liked, and I got the lobster bisque which with each spoonful I died and went to lobster heaven! Lots of sweet chunks of lobster and the soup itself was creamy but light, I would've been happy just having that dish.
-we got out entree I forgot the names but I think hubby got the ribeye and I got a surf & turf. Sides were mashed potato & asparagus. Steaks were awesome, sides were meh, we didn't finish the potatoes.
-for my bday they brought out a sampler with writing (see pics) it was delish. The chocolate cake was very rich so it would be good to share and cheesecake was perfect.

Getting through Fashion Show to find the entrance was a bit of an adventure, but worth the hassle. We made reservations and there was no delay in seating. The dinner service was a slower pace; the fact that this was a rare date night for my husband I was great, but the fact we had concert tickets afterwards not so much.
The atmosphere very much had an old-school vegas/cigar lounge vibe, the wait staff was more mature rather than bubbly and bouncy 20-somethings creating a calm dining experience. I do wish, as it was obvious we were a solo-dining couple (on a date) to have been seated away from large groups as there were plenty available - we didn't ask to be reseated, in hindsight I would have appreciated a quieter meal with my husband.

I was brought bread, ice water, and iced tea quickly.  My server, Eric, was top notch!  He explained various things on the menu since it was my first visit to the restaurant.  He then left me to mull the choices before coming back to see if I had any questions or was ready to order.

I ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.

I ordered the steak blue and that's just the way it came.  It was very good and I almost picked up the bone to gnaw before I let them take the plate.  The parmesan truffle fries were addictive.  If anyone from the FDA comes to this restaurant, the fries will be listed as a Class xx addictive drug.  I hated to finish only a small amount but I didn't want to overdo it.

For dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was very rich and had a good dark chocolate/coffee flavor--strong but not overpowering.  

I gave my compliments to Eric for the staff on such a good meal.  It was a great start to the evening.  The view through those windows along with the excellent food and service make the Capital Grille a real winner.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,10,4,qnuLo4wEk3sqtWQ6XLjGRg

The men in our group ordered the dry aged strip steak which they seemed very happy with. When I tasted one I didn't think it was outstandingly better than non-dry-aged steak. The flavor wasn't better or more tender IMHO. 

My mom and I ordered fish: she citrus glazed salmon, me the tuna. 

Sides we ordered were asparagus and green beans. Both pretty typical and not treated in any interesting ways.

I was told the tuna was sashimi grade and just seared. Little did I know this meant below room temperature in the center. I'm used to my ahi grilled rare/med-rare and I think it's better that way unless you're eating actual sushi. 

If you're looking for a safe traditional steak house you'll be fine here.

I'm seriously day dreaming about the next time I can get my hands on another one of their steaks.  Yum!

Since we had such a heavy meal, we opted for sorbet for dessert.  It was extraordinarily delicious, not like the consistency of your average icy sorbet.

 - Lobster Mac n Cheese (bite size lobster bits, creamy mac'n goodness with a crunchy top)
 - creamed corn with bacon

The minute you step out of valet and get on the elevator to ascend to Capital Grille, you know you are going to be rolling out the benjis for dinner.  I really liked the atmosphere here.

We started with oysters that were very fresh and salty.  5 stars.  We also brought a bottle of wine with us and the corkage fee of $25 was definitely lower than some other strip location restaurants.

I do recommend splitting the Grand seafood platter with friends I divided it between 4 of us and it was a good taster course for us all to start off with. The oysters and lobster were truly an religious experience for any seafood lover in the words of one of my friends ""they take you somewhere else."" My steak was cooked perfectly and with just the right sauce to compliment it. They happened to be out of the bottle of wine we had ordered and they very kindly recommend a similar bottle and matched the price even though it was about $20 more expensive. Their cheesecake was absolutely the best I have ever had. It was fluffy and well balanced, just when you are really thinking of you can eat anymore they ask about dessert. I have to say I was really questioning weather I could in fact eat more but I just had a feeling it would be worth it.( I also split it with a friend) 
The only let down in this entire experience, and I'm really begrudgingly admitting this, the soups we had ordered were good but unimpressive. The cup of lobster bisque had more of a dense cream flavor and texture then a true intense lobster flavor.

What got me eating was the curious slabs of beef hanging in the window. ""Dry Aged"" is what they call it. This is not a new way of curing a steak but the very first way, pre-refrigeration, allowing the connective tissues to naturally decompose creating a very tender meat. I had what they call the Kona-Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin (or something like that) and it was fabulous! The meat melted in my mouth. Definitely a must return-to place. Then, I took a girlfriend to the Vegas one and down went the opinion polls even though I ordered the very same thing. Maybe it was the pretentious, lah-di-dah crowd waving $100 bills (newly-minted rubes from down in the holler?), the mall we had to wind through to get here fighting off aggressive Israeli ""Red Sea"" salt-crystal venders, or the over-the-top waiter (""Eh, gulls, I killa fa yew"") and so-so steak (it obviously wasn't made for Ted Kennedy's gluttonous taste ) but that'll be an Aye vote for DC and a Nay vote for Vegas.

Amazing wine list, bottles/half bottles/by the glass. 

There is baked Parmesan in their assortment of bread along with a warm roll dusted with sesame seeds. 

Caesar salad was about 4/5 on my scale, however, still very good. Lobster bisque was wonderful. 

Our waiter, Raul, suggested the rib eye sandwich...excellent suggestion. This delicious piece of meat topped with melted havarti and caramelized onions melts in your mouth in between two pieces of sourdough garlic bread. I couldn't believe how amazing it was. 

My mom ordered the salmon with a fresh salad on the side (I can't remember the menu name). I tried the salmon and it was another melt in your mouth bite!

4171478,2010-02-25,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Came here based on a friend's recommendation, who's previous tastes have not let us down.  The ambiance is very nice with a nice view of the Wynn and part of the strip.  

What we ordered:
Caprese salad:  The mozarella was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The tomatoes were average, I'm surprised they didn't try using heirlooms here.  The balsamic vinegar was the highlight of the dish and made an otherwise average dish a little better.  

Kona crusted filet mignon:  Boyfriend ordered this.  It wasn't bad, I've had better.  The Kona crust gave a different flavor to the steak, but the filet was a little on the dry side.

Porcini rubbed delmonico:  At first, it was over-cooked.  Ordered medium-rare / medium and it came out more towards medium / medium-well.  I cut it next to the bone and it was just pink.  I really hate to send food back, for the price I was paying, I was not too happy. The second steak was cooked to perfection.  Very good marbling.  The rub added a nice touch to an otherwise tasty steak.

Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms:  A mix of mushrooms sauteed with butter.  Good mushrooms, nothing spectacular, nothing to complain about.

Cheesecake:  Not your ordinary cheesecake.  First of all, it is round.  It is not as dense as your typical cheesecake, which is a good thing to me.  There is a creme brulee-like crust over the top.  Save room for this.

Overall, dinner for two ended up costing us over $100, and it came out to about $250 with alcohol.  The service was good, I would probably have given them a 4 if the steak was prepared to my liking the first time around.  If you are a salt and pepper steak fan like I am, I would look somewhere else.

It's one of the few nice steak house chains my hometown doesn't have, so I look forward to enjoying this Vegas location when visiting. The service here is superior to most other fine dining chains... some of which are hard to top! To make mine and my husband's anniversary special and memorable, they sprinkled little hearts on the white linen table, had glasses of champagne waiting for us, and completed our meal with a complimentary berry cheesecake.

I love when a variety is offered in the bread basket, and you get quite a range of flavors here from raison pumpernickel to chopped olives baked in. So good to carb out on! When on vacation, we like to splurge... so we ordered our very own salads instead of spitting one before the meal. ;-) I had the caprese while my husband went with a caesar. Both were a perfect start! I'm a filet kind of girl AND I'm a lobster kind of girl. So it was an easy choice for me to go with the lobster topped filet medallions. I would get it again in a heartbeat! My husband went with a simple filet, which tasted anything but simple. We split a side of the cheesy au gratin potatoes. They are some of the best I've ever had... and I've had a fair share of cheesy potatoes in my time! As previously mentioned, we enjoyed a piece of thick, New York style cheesecake plated with fresh berries.

Free yummy food all night. Since we were a large group, we had our own lil room with large portraits of unknown men (two to be exact)....the bf mentioned that it was a $3,000 minimum that needed to be spent. 

We all started off with drinks....my Riesling was not too dry and that's the kind of wine I like. The bf's boss ordered the Coldshell Fish Platter, Pan Fried Calamari and Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella. My favorite out of all of those was the Fried Calamari. I loved how it was a lil spicy, crispy and oh so delicious! YUM! The oysters were HUGE....almost the size of my palm. Everything else was good, but the calamari is what stood out in my mind. 

For an entree, I decided to go with Seared Tenderloin with the Butter Poached Lobster and a cup of the Clam Chowder. The bf ordered some kind of steak and the Lobster Bisque. This lady at the table was raving about the Lobster Bisque and how it had real chunks of lobster in it. The soups and salads arrived fairly quickly and let's just note that the Lobster Bisque....not so awesome. Clam Chowder was definitely WAY better than the bisque. My beef tenderloins were tender and I believe there were 3 or 4 tenderloins plus the lobster. I thought it was tender and tasty, nothing too special. Lobster was cooked well and was very buttery. I was extremely full by the time my tenderloins came out so I'm not sure I appreciated it to its full extent. 

For the sides, we shared everything family style. Creamed Spinach, Parmesan truffle fries, Sam's Mashed Potatoes, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Fresh Asparagus with Hollaindaise Sauce, Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms and Au Gratin Potatoes was what was ordered. Out of everything I really loved the Sam's Mashed Potatoes and the Creamed Spinach. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was probably my least favorite....not very flavorful and just not what I expected it to be. The Au Gratin Potatoes had this delightful crust on top which was pretty awesome. 

Service was attentive and everything was overall fairly good. Nothing was knock me of my chair awesome, but I thought it was a good meal nonetheless.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,2,2,4,BGE_ST8kZZQC8HvjqsP9fg

The restaurant was not very busy at the time we visited( we had early dinner so we could catch a show). The poor review is directly attributed to our server Alex. 
Alex seemed to be a bit of a cold fish with his presentations of the nightly specials. He did not offer explanations of the different chef recommendations, and he was not engaging. He made it seem as if it was a chore to serve us.
I was willing to attribute this to a flat personality until another table of diners arrived. Alex transformed into a totally different person. He really turned on the charm, engaging this party about their likes and dislikes, as well as offering variations on the different preparations. 
This experience was disappointing to say the least. I am not sure why Alex was so unwelcoming as we we're visitors and I had not dined at this location before. Hopefully the other locations will have the service that Capital Grille is known for.",BujfEtAIEmRjYckbZqlb9Q,1,0,2,HFxCpfOG2sjQvZuYl2gPtw
4234384,2012-11-16,2,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"First things first, it needs to be said: THIS IS THE BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP ON THE STRIP!

Ooey gooey cheese melting down the sides, piping hot veal broth, salty but sweet from all the caramelized onions resting on the bottom where even MORE cheese awaits! And the tiny little bit that sets it apart from other french onion soups? The baguette they use in the soup stays crispy around the edges the whole crock through. I don't know how.. black magic maybe.. but it's worth my soul. Those crispy little bits that occasionally surprise you give me the motivation to finish the whole thing. And the crock is pretty big. For $10, I've made a meal out of it.

Another worthy mention: The coconut cream pie with bourbon sauce is out of this world. I don't like desserts.. but this tart.. the bottom is chewy like a meringue with coconut, the custard is rich, the fresh whipped cream is decadent and then bourbon sauce?! Really?! I never order desserts, 100% of the time I would rather order an appetizer. This dessert came complimentary and I'm so glad it did. I would come back JUST for this dessert and a cup of their coffee (which is also good).

Other things I've tried: 
-Lobster and Crab Cakes. Comes with a corn succotash. I wouldn't order it again, it was kind of fishy to me.
-Shrimp Cocktail - Hit or miss. The first time was good, although a little undercooked (the top was mushy). The second time tasted like glue a little bit. Weird.
-Bacon and Mushroom Spinach Salad - it was okay. The bacon had that dirty pork taste I'm not fond of and there were too many (raw) mushrooms in the salad.
-The burger. Not sure which one it was since the boyfriend ordered it, but it was ground sirloin and surprisingly not that tasty. I'd prefer Bachi Burger any day. The fries were just okay.

They have a nice selection of wines by the glass, a fantastic selection by the bottle and some very delicious hand crafted cocktails.

I recommend sitting at the bar and chatting with one of the many friendly bar tenders, starting with a french onion soup, moving onto the coconut cream pie, and sipping some hot house coffee before you head out.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,3,3,4,N8SVv9zc7Qku81M_Mbh8cg

SERVICE: was okay, we sat in the lounge area and had the 2 bartenders who really werent that busy, maybe 2-3 other patrons in lounge area, but we could definitely have been better cared for especially for being a steak house, service should always be a little above a typical establishment...also the bartender was a little pompous and arrogant.

AMBIANCE: was Beautiful! they have very tall windows (3 stories tall?) around a majority of the restaurant over looking the Strip (you have to sit by the window to see out to the strip). Had open table arrangement, not much chance if you prefer private/booth seating though.

We had a problem with the Chilean Sea Bass. It was raw in the middle and had to be sent back.

I was a bit disappointed when they told me we were going to some boring, stale steak restaurant.  You open any magazine in Vegas and you'll see some exotic piece of unicorn meat teetering on top of a fragile stack of vegetables and painstakingly dotted with exotic sauces (is that mango?  Some chive oil?).  All of this is topped with a lacy piece of flair made out of something I'd never heard of or ever suspected was edible.  

Ho-hum.  Another steak place.  So I thought I already knew what great steak was.  Capital Grille proved me wrong.  We tried practically every appetizer and side they offered on the menu.  Everything was beyond delicious.  Beyond fresh.  Beyond beautiful.  All meaning I stuffed myself beyond silly.  

Happy Appies:  

Smoked Salmon
Shrimp Cocktail
Oysters
Proscuitto Wrapped Mozzarella with Tomatoes and Balsamic Glaze
Steak Tartare

Shamefully, I admit to having more than one gluttonous bite of each of the above...plus I split a delicious spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  Main course?  What main course?  Oh yeah, how could I forget?  I had a perfectly prepared Filet Oscar which was a beautifully prepared filet (medium rare of course) stuffed with crab stacked on top of tender asparagus and drizzled with hollandaise.  My husband had the Grille Delmonico which was a mouth-watering rib-eye with an earthy porcini mushroom rub.  Absolutely incredible.  Oh, and lobster mac and cheese and truffled parmesan French fries?  I was in heaven.  As if I had not done enough damage to my insides, then came dessert.  About five or six of them came around the table.  I'm a big chocolate fan and they certainly did their chocolate desserts justice with their chocolate hazelnut cake and their flourless espresso chocolate cake, but their coconut cream pie was to die for.  

My only gripe about this place - any nice restaurant I've been to in Vegas has an amazing bar with incredible bartenders.  This place didn't.  My husband's mojito was not muddled correctly and was waaay too sweet as was my lemon-drop martini.  The mojito was not even drinkable.    The bartender didn't apologize when we had to send the mojito back and didn't ask if we wanted something else instead.   I want to knock off one star for the prick, but the rest of the experience was so good it just doesn't seem fair.  Especially since dinner service was stellar and our waitress was friendly, rolled with the punches for our large group, and definitely took care of us.  

I would definitely come back to this place - even with all the other enticing restaurant ads in town - Capital Grille taught me that ""classic"" doesn't mean ""boring.""

4382552,2016-03-28,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Wow! I was totally blown away by my Easter brunch at The Capital Grille. Originally I was sort of bummed by my husband's Easter choice, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. The food and service definitely rated up there with the other fine steakhouses where I've dined in the past.

We made a reservation for the start of brunch service and were promptly seated next to the window. The window gave some nice people watching opportunities while we dined. The atmosphere of the restaurant was upscale, but not in a stuffy way. It was nice that other diners had dressed nicely for the occasion and the restaurant was drawing a classy crowd.

The service was very attentive from beginning to end. Our waiter was friendly, drinks were constantly refilled, plates were cleared regularly, and our meal flowed nicely. Not a single hiccup with the service. The manager/owner(?) was also walking around checking on each table which is always a nice touch.

Brunch began with a Bellini and the bread basket. My Bellini didn't disappoint and I enjoyed the breads. I opted for the Bibb Salad that had plenty of greens, dried cherries, blue cheese, and vinaigrette. It was a simple salad, but well prepared. My husband enjoyed his Caesar salad as well.

My entrée was what really impressed me. I had the 8 oz. Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes. My steak was the perfect size and perfectly prepared to medium rare as I requested. The seasoning had a wonderful flavor as well. I would say this was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The mashed potatoes had great flavor and a nice creaminess. My husband had the Lobster Frittata. This was served with a potato cake layer, frittata layer, and more lobster on top. Beautiful presentation and delicious as well. The truffled hollandaise was served on the side without even requesting it which was a nice touch.

I ventured out a little with dessert and went with the Espresso Chocolate Cake. This was very rich and had more of a fudge like consistency. I enjoyed it, but I think two could split it since it is so rich. My husband's Crème Brulee had a strong custard flavor and fresh berries on top. He loved this dessert.

I've been missing out by passing on this spot for years. Absolutely awesome service and food.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,5,2,5,kujoFzyDPNsyjLb9dAObtQ

4418485,2015-03-23,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"My husband and I both agree this was more like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up for the service and he said he'd round down for some food issues.  Having said that, the rating is all relative to the prices, which as others have mentioned are quite steep
($50 per steak on average without sides), so expectations are high. 

We celebrated our anniversary here, and they do a great job with special touches like table confetti and a hand written note. Service was warm, friendly and attentive.

We got the calamari to start, which was greaseless and plentiful but honestly lacked a ton of flavor. When eaten with the cherry peppers served on top, there was a nice heat to it, but not a ton of flavor besides those peppers. 

Salads were Caesar- which was classic and perfect, and a caprese type salad that was spot on. Could have used a few more basil leaves than just the one it came with. 

My husband got the steak special- a bone in filet that was dry aged. It wasn't that large (10 oz which I think may have included the bone? Not sure). So for $60 you'd pretty much expect perfection. It was flavorful, but was ordered medium and it was medium in some places (where it was tender as it should be) and closer to well done in others (where it was less tender of course). I was having some of this steak and don't mind the well done as much, so I ate those parts. We didn't complain or bring the cooking issue to the waiter's attention, and I'm sure they would've cooked us a new one had we done so. But we had a show to get to, so didn't want to wait. 

Side was potatoes au gratin, which was good but not amazing. Had a subtle garlic flavor and nice cheesiness / creaminess with crunchy toppling.  

Dessert was comped for our anniversary and was their coconut cream pie. Splendid. It was large and had a tasty, chewy, blonde-like crust. If you love whipped cream, you'll be in heaven with this. 

Overall, an enjoyable meal with a great view of the strip. Not a total 4 star, and we'd probably come back, but might try a few other places first.",1uiH92uF0AmXsD6Azetluw,0,0,4,cRJorvZyEoXMOT6QeYSD6Q

Service: Their service was exceptional! I originally made reservations online for 5:00. We were running behind schedule so I called an hour before and asked if I could reschedule to 9:00, wasn't a problem at all. We arrived around 15 minutes late and were seated immediately. Our waiter was very friendly and it was obvious that he had a thorough knowledge of their menu; he had great suggestions on some of the better items on their menu. The food came out surprisingly quickly and our waiter checked up on us throughout the night to make sure everything was good.

Ambiance: The restaurant has a modern clean feel to it. It felt like we were seated at the best seat in the whole place, our view was breathtaking! Great view of the strip primarily with the Wynn and Encore on one corner and half the strip on the other.

Food: The hero of any restaurant should always be the food and this place really delivers! Their portion sizes are huge, each dish was perfect for sharing. We started off with fried calamari sautéed with garlic butter and bell peppers. It was so good that we couldn't stop eating it even though we knew we needed to save room for the main course. Great crunch with every bite. We decided to go with their Delmonico ribeye steak for our main course. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The ribeye was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare! They cut it in half for us which was awesome for sharing. As a side we had their backed lobster mac and cheese! Amazing! Nice crunchy layer on top with generous portions of lobster. Under the crunch the Mac and cheese was really creamy. Almost liked it more than the streak!

The ambiance is great, service spectacular, prices intimidatingly expensive, mixed with good quality food but just OK flavors.

I had the Kona crusted dry aged steak w/ shallot butter. I couldn't taste too much of the coffee flavor but the steak was fairly tender and the portion was huge. The shallot butter was great but I didn't have nearly enough to give the extra amount of flavor it needed. Call me crazy but this steak was not nearly good enough to stand on its own without the saltiness I'm used to. I even had to ask for au jus and even that was pretty bland. For a $47 steak a la carte I expected more flavor, A LOT more.

On the other hand, the parmesan truffle fries were amazing (as they are at every other place I've had them). The waiter even gave our table of 5 free shots as well as a complimentary dessert trio because it was my friend's birthday. The coconut cream pie that was part of that dessert was so light and fluffy, definitely the star of the night.

4480965,2011-05-28,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"My boyfriend and I were in Vegas, and had a really difficult time making a reservation at some of the more hip, interesting, celebrity-chef-run restaurants.  I was in the mood for steak, so we took a chance on the Capital Grille, of which there is a sister location in Boston, where we live.  I wasn't excited about going to a chain restaurant, even an upscale one, but we were pleasantly surprised.

The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  She directed me to a delicious red wine, and had no problem at all with my boyfriend and me sharing a couple of appetizers and an entree, an action that might be frowned upon in other more upscale eateries.  They separated the steak in half prior to cooking it, which was unexpected and wonderful, and gave it to us on two different plates without us having to ask.  The appetizers we shared, the Spinach Salad and the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, were both great, and actually quite a lot of food, in addition to the warm, fresh bread we were given upon ordering drinks.

The star of the meal, the 14 oz. Dry-Aged Sirloin, was cooked to perfection, and the Parmesan Truffle Fries we ordered as a side, were delectable, though we couldn't finish them.

Our only issue, and this was a minor one, was that almost immediately after we were seated, and despite an otherwise pretty empty restaurant, a table of four relatively obnoxious people were seated directly next to us.  This might have been more of an issue if the restaurant had remained quiet, but we must have come at the right time, since in the next hour or so, the restaurant filled up quickly, and the irritating folks next to us were drowned out to some extent.

I would recommend the Capital Grille to anyone.  It's a classy place with a great menu.",Teyv3k4-Y4aydpW9FEvWfw,1,0,5,bJCE5zZZNSFK-9XtZBu3Hg

I had planned a surprise dinner for my boyfriend's birthday here and the only regret we had is that we hadn't tried this place sooner!

Throughout the night, he came by to make sure everything was going well; not in an obnoxious way either where some servers tend to do when they continuously check up on you. 

Regarding the food we had that night, for our appetizer we chose the Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella which was out of the world amazingly good! For our main course, my boyfriend picked one of the Chef's Suggestions, ""Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails."" Now, I know this was delicious because my boyfriend took his sweet time eating it and raving about it, when usually he is the fastest eater I know. I chose to go with the ""Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon."" I absolutely love salmon and this was probably one of the best ones I have ever had. We also opted to go for the ""Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese"" and I tell you, it was so delicious if we had more space, we probably would have ordered another one! 

At the end of our meal, Jeff brought out a platter with two desserts to share (as I had requested when making the reservation) and we also ordered two double shot esspressos to have with our dessert.

The entrance (from the garage) was a ride up in the elevator directly into the elevator.  I had to adjust my eyes a bit because it was dark with dark mahogany furniture.  We had a table by the window and a birthday card with glitterati candy all over the table - here for my birthday.  Love that!

I knew what I wanted to order, since a couple of days before.  I started with the lobster bisque with sherry.  The soup came out piping hot, not too thick and rich with a good amount of lobster strips.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and forgot that we had until midway into our dinner.  We both ordered the Delmonico steak.  I had my steak prepared medium rare and the hubs had it medium well.  Medium rare the way to go...yumm!  That was a juicy piece with browned fatty corners...mmmm. Tender and tasty.  I knew this steak was taking me down it was 22 ounces! I had a fist size left over which I had later that evening as a snack...yay!  Sam's mashed potatoes was smooth with some chunks of potatoes - gosh, that was creamy rich goodness.  The spinach which I thought was going to be creamed was actually lightly steamed with bacon, I think - the steak was so good that the sides were actually SIDES and not taking over the limelight.  I enjoyed both the mashed potatoes and the spinach.  I would order these again!

I guess our server felt bad about forgetting the shrimp cocktail (and not that I was craving it or anything), so she brought our a cheesecake with berries for my birthday ""cake."" It had caramelized sugar on top and it was so moist that it just broke apart with your fork.  I don't like cheesecake really, but this was very good.  I didn't have a cocktail because I had been drinking most of the day and my tummy wasn't feeling so hot earlier, so I thought I'd take it easy, so I can have a pleasant rest of the night.

The service was okay and nothing over the top or spectacular.  Staff was attentive enough.

I may visit one of the CG's here in L.A./O.C. At least I know what goodness awaits me.",yZJMu5juqpvH3dvylwUafw,0,0,4,EvvQZdR6-IohvFz6B4Ofgw

4740389,2008-03-30,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"My husband insisted that we come to eat at The Capital Grille as his buddy from the Army had strongly recommended this place.  It's actually a chain restaurant owned by Black Angus.  Just a little interesting tidbit thrown in there for ya!  He's eaten at the Washington D.C. and Philadelphia location so now, he can add LV to his list of CGs he's been to.  My husband has raved about the quality of food and service he has received from the other locations for months so we decided to give it a try!

A group of at least 10 of us had taken a trip to LV for the weekend.  On our last evening, we had a nice dinner with Constantine as our server.  I kid you not, that was his name.  I thought of the movie, ""Constantine"" which suuuucked!  Anyhoo, he looked nothing at all like Keanu Reeves.  

I was a bit disappointed by the food.  For appetizers, we had the pan fried calamari with hot cherry peppers which came out a bit cold.  The presentation was not impressive as it looked like limp, fried calamari bits strewn about, mixed with cherry peppers.  CG is known for its steaks so for the main course, I had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Carmelized Shallot Butter.    I was sold on the title of the dish but upon coming out, the meat was dry after stating that I did want it cooked medium rare.  My husband had ordered the Steak Au Poivre which looked amazing and he ate every, single bite of it.  There are no sides that accompany the steak dishes so we ordered fresh vegetables and mashed potatoes.  

What saves this restaurant are the desserts.  We tried the key lime pie, creme brulee, and the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  The key lime pie as my husband stated, ""Was on point.""  It is a pricey place.  Two people would easily cost $150 without drinks.  The view is beautiful so request to be seated near the window.

4814242,2011-04-28,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Pricey and contrived, this place feels perfect for the tourist crowd and the loud, blow-hardy lunch meeting crowd. At the front desk, the head of the party's name is requested; once at the table, the server addresses the head person by name in an attempt to make the party feel welcome, special, or familiar.  It comes off as lame. 

That said, our waiter was as nice as could be. We started with glasses of wine (a nice Malbec and a pinot noir, reasonably priced at around $10-$12). The caesar salad that followed was decent but forgettable.
For the main, I got ""sushi grade tuna"" with ginger rice. The tuna was nice and hugely portioned, but I would have preferred it to be sliced before it got to the table.  There's something unpleasantly animalistic about cutting into a giant hunk of raw meat. 
As a side, we ordered the truffle oil and parmesan fries, which were fantastic.
I had espresso pie and an espresso for dessert. Again, both items were decent but forgettable. When all is said and done, I'm 100% OK with this one trip being my last.

4835443,2014-12-08,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"It has been a year since I have started coming here, and I was once again treated to some awesome food, delicious drinks, and excellent service. 

Good bread at any steakhouse should be a staple. I had to once again hold back on eating too much as to not get full before my actual meal came out. There was an assortment of piping hot breads that came with sweet cream butter that was topped with some salt. I know it is just ""bread"", but I can eat that bread basket for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Then came the calamari with hot peppers. This was excellent as usual since the calamari was the star of the show. They didn't taste frozen as they were soft and tender, they were coated with a crispy batter that wasn't too thick or heavy, and they had excellent flavor from the peppers. They weren't overly spicy but still had a nice bite. I'm glad they don't come with some type of sauce since, in my opinion, would totally kill the flavor of this awesome appetizer.
 
Afterwards, my steak came out. I wish I had the words to describe how awesome this steak was, it honestly was one of the best steaks I have had in recent memory. I got the delmonico at a medium-rare, a bone-in ribeye, and I wish I was still eating it as I write this review. It was so juicy, it was so tender, and it had so much flavor. It was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of fat on the edges. 

All the accompanying sides that I ordered were a great complimenting addition to my excellent steak. The grilled asparagus was tender and crispy while not being chewy or stringy like asparagus can be. The grilled half lemon that comes with it helps add a bright smokey flavor. The parmesan truffle fries I got were hot, crispy/crunchy and delicious from the first bite to the last. So much so that when I ate the last couple of fries, I almost went into a depressed state of not having any left and actually thought about ordering another order. Then there was the lobster mac and cheese. I have probably eaten this dish over a half dozen times, and it has yet to disappoint. Tender noodles, big chunks of lobster that was in almost in every bite, and a awesome cheese sauce. It was another item that I seriously gave thought to buying a second order of to take home.

My excellent meal was finished with a cheesecake that had fresh berries and a nice caramelized sugar topping. It was a perfect finisher.

The service was top notch as everyone was really friendly. Everything that was ordered came out hot, fresh, and correct. The manager came by to see how everything was doing, and all of the staff in general made my meal very pleasant and memorable.

4934613,2012-05-27,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Today, I have to raise my review of Capital Grille from 4 to 5 star.  Here is what is going on.....

1.  I eat here at least 6 -8 times a year for dinner, with clients. Easy choice due to my last review details of class, extraordinary service, food quality and reservations.

2.  Last night, I was in ""trouble"" because we were taking my son out for dinner for his 18th birthday with his friends. I was feeling a bit generous as he is doing so well in school, his friends are great and so, we wanted to have something special.

3.  Special meant, on the strip, good view, great food, feeling pampered and special.

4.  I made reservations at the last minute, 5:00 pm for a 7:30 pm dinner. Why, because i needed class and where we were going wasn't special enough.

5.  I asked for a window seat due to my son's birthday. They did not promise, however, they said they would request.

6.  Here is what we got...

a.  Best table seat in the whole restaurant. Right in the corner with great views.
b.  A birthday card with a nice touch, a wax seal envelope, that wished my kid happy birthday and thanking him for dining with them.
c.  The service was beyond extraordinary. It was simply staggeringly special.
d.  The food, was beyond really good. It was just right.  We had the Delmonico (bone in rib eye), the Porcini rubbed Delmonico (dry rubbed porcini finished with a 12 year balsamic dressing), sliced Filet Migon, Calamari, and Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella as starters.  For sides, we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Au Gratin Potatoes, Truffle Fries and Creamed Spinach.


I guess, when all said and done, the best review is from the young men...""Best Steak ever"".  OK, while we know that they haven't been to all the best steak places in LV to qualify, the fact is that it was great and I have been to many  steak places in the world.

People, when you are looking for an experience, this is the place.  Kudos to Tiffany for taking my reservation and making it special.  Kudos for Eric who helped us make decisions, and made for a great evening.

Thanks Capital Grill for making our night so great.  It doesn't get better in my book and Happy Birthday son!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,8,4,5,cK2PkUacN6_d3khZA2G1og
4936375,2018-02-09,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,Never dissapointed with this place. You'll want to make a reservation especially if it's for a special occasion. Ask for a window table if you remember because they give you the beat view of the Wynn and the Strip. Gorgonzola N.Y. Strip is my fav.  Their drinks are on point and you'll be warm going into your second one...and I guarantee you'll want a second one...we started in the bar because we came early. Servers are wonderful and willing to get you anything you'd like. This was our date night so we took our time and enjoyed every minute. It's free to park right underneath and you can walk almost anywhere from there...so no parking fees like at the casinos down the Strip!!!,3LGAWDgEUm0WgWeHnMyEJw,0,0,5,7MPDnlHdXW24fxgcSVrltw

One huge complaint--no apparent dress code.  I was in for a dinner service once where I was surrounded by people in jeans, sneakers, and baseball caps.  I don't appreciate that.

Cons:
- $10 for ""Field Greens, Tomatoes, and Fresh Herbs"" salad which turned out to be a pitiful looking plate of iceberg lettuce and two cherry tomatoes that were cut in half.   My salad contained no herbs other than what was in the vinaigrette dressing I had on the side.  Capital Grille should rename it the ""Iceberg Lettuce and Tomatoes"" salad.  
- My 2 buddies had each ordered soup with their fish entrees.  Both buddies said that the waiter had made it seem that the $11/soup would be complimentary (since it was our first time eating at Capital Grille or whatever).  I wasn't paying attention to what the waiter said when he was discussing the menu, but I'll side with both of my friends (word of my 2 friends vs. the word of 1 waiter) who say they were mislead into ordering the soup.  Had my friends known it wasn't complimentary, they wouldn't have bothered ordering the soup.

Pros:
- Great location overlooking the northern end of the Strip.
- Aside from the soup problem, the service was great.

Was there last night for a business dinner and sat by the window with some nice view, even though it's not located very high up in the building. It's sitting across from the shopping center so you can also get some shopping done afterwards to walk off the rich meal.

Too bad I didn't snap any pictures, but this was a work dinner and I had to behave...

Everyone else ordered some sort of steak dish except for me. I got the citric glazed salmon, which was juicy, medium rare and cooked perfectly. The steak dishes are pricey but the portions were actually not very huge. Everyone finished all their meat so apparently they were all happy with how their steak was cooked. I did get to taste their beef as I ordered the steak tartar appetizer and it was fresh and tender and seasoned well too.  We also shared fried calamari, lobster macaroni (yum!), steak tartar and grilled asparagus (bland). Loved the warm bread basket before the meal. Fancy decor (classic dark wood) and we shared a bottle of 2009 red wine from Napa.

The chef sent us three yummy desserts even though we didn't order any: cheesecake (rich and just the right amount of tartness to balance the sweetness), chocolate ganache cake (smooth, deep, chocolaty) and creame brulee (light and fresh custard) with assorted berries. I only have one word for all three desserts: PERFECTION. Not bad if you have a friend who knows the chef. Again I wish I had taken a photo. ..",f92md2NWsZTEUjI7Fr3tHw,4,4,4,flpJFUVfk367oXmtskuUIw

It's got a great view of the Wynn and the strip, and at lunch, this place is full of power lunchers. I think my friend and I were the only two not dressed in suits, but that did not at all mean we experienced any subpar service. 

We split steak tartare - I looooove the preparation here. And it takes some time because they chop it up fresh for you! I won't give it away, but there are pictures... 

I had the lobster salad for lunch. I just couldn't handle more meat after the indulgent weekend I had. But it was still indulgent, for seafood. My friend had the steak cobb. And it was perfect - the steak was basically on the side. If I had known that, it would've been what I ordered. Just a little bit of steak, with a bit of salad (and avocado, blue cheese WEDGE, all the good cobb stuff).

First Course : Field Greens, Seasonal Vegetables With Shallot Champagne Vinaigrette OR Clam Chowder 

Clam chowder was good!  Not great, but good! 

Second Course : Dry Aged Sirloin With Roasted Pepper, Fresh Mozzarella And Arugula Salad OR The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger With Parmesan Truffle Fries OR Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon OR Caesar Salad With Roasted Chicken Breast And Parmesan Tuile 

It's one of the best burgers in Vegas IMO....and you know I have a high standard in burgers! Cooked perfectly medium rare, with the juices hitting the plate even before the initial bite. The horseradish sauce is very subtle but adds a nice touch to a very well seasoned burger. Not sure if they use aged meat, but it tastes like it! Truffle fries are good but not great....a little light with the truffle oil. 

The aged steak was ok...didn't have the punch most aged steaks have imo.  It was cooked well, but didn't have the flavor explosions goin on in each bite.  The salad was pretty good surprisingly, since I don't usually eat the greens :P 

Third Course : Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake OR Creme Brulee OR The Capital Grille Handcrafted Ice Cream OR Chef's Seasonal Fruit Sorbet 

Chocolate Cake was super rich and thick but tasty!  I really liked the creme brulee...pretty tasty and fresh fruit was piled all over on top!

Our server was Charles and he was fantastic. He was attentive without being pushy and I always appreciate that. Super low key, much like us. So it was a great fit. We were deliberating between the oysters or tuna tartare and he suggested the tartare. It didn't disappoint! The fish was fresh and I really enjoyed the mango purée that accompanied it. 

I had the lobster salad again and man, I LOVE that salad. There are always huge chunks of fresh lobster. At first glance, it may look fairly small. Once deconstructed, you realize just how huge it is. I always manage to finish it though. It's too good to try to save any for leftovers! 

JD ordered Charles personal favorite, the steak sandwich. He and I were both VERY impressed with the size of it. Gigantic. The steak was cooked perfectly to order-- medium rare. He actually had trouble finishing it as well, which is a rarity for him. The fries were crisp and the Parmesan is a nice touch. 

Charles went above and beyond for me by putting some jasmine green tea on ice for me, which normally is served hot. It was refreshing and exactly what I was looking for. 

+2 because Charles was really great and made it such a pleasant experience from start to almost finish.

We've tried just about everything on the menu and my favorite remains the Kona Crusted New York.  They offer it as a bone-in but can also do it without the bone.  We do work lunches here 2-3x a month. They have great entree salads as well as amazing burgers!  Like crazy good burgers! If you are nice, sometimes they will make a burger for you for dinner if that's your thing.

They offer really good soups and salads.  The French Onion is insane and a meal in itself.  We often order the wedge salad and they split it for us before it comes to the table. It's great.  The apps are amazeballs too!  My personal fav is the lobster crab cakes. No filler in these babies.  There's a great selection of sides up to and including baked potatoes (not on the menu) and lobster mac and cheese. If you have any room left or need a bite of something sweet...get the sampler platter and take it home for later. It's a WOW dessert!

The restaurant is located to the front of the Fashion Show mall across from the Wynn. Parking at the mall is free (if you don't valet) so this is a huge plus considering all the local hotels now charge for parking (yuck)!

The staff is friendly and they don't have much turnover. We've had the same waiters/waitress for some time.  I remember going in after my Mom had passed.  The waitress actually cried when she'd heard Mom was gone. How sweet is that?

Cap Grille is doing it right! They are consistent which is a rarity these days.  Steaks are cooked exactly as you ask. They take our reservations and try to always give us a table with a view.  We have the ""family"" table.  

Holy crap! I almost forgot the very best thing here!!! If you drink, get yourself and everyone else at your table a ""stoli-doli""! It's a pineapple infused vodka drink shaken at the table and served in a chilled martini glass.  Careful as these babies go down like water.

To start off our dining experience, we always get the Seafood plateau.  It's a ton of seafood and totally worth the $99.  You get a heathy portion of lobster, crab meat, oysters, and shrimp cocktail.  The bone-in ribeye is my go to all the time, but they had a special bone-in filet that was to die for.   My wife and kids ordered that... wish I did too.  It was succulent, juicy, and cut like ""butter"".  If they have it again, that'll be my go to 100% each time.  The sides were amazing as always.  We had the wild mushrooms, lobster mac and cheese, creme spinach, and mash potatoes.  To finish off our dining experience, we had our go to Banana cream pie desert.   A little too much whipped cream this time, but still amazing.

For dessert, we finished off with creme brulee and a flourless chocolate espresso cake.  

- I had to park next to the green at the Fashion Show mall to get here. Went up an escalator and out the food court and into Capital Grille. 
- Great service. Servers greeted me with a glass of white wine and took my order promptly. 
- Wagyu beef was finely sliced. Reminds me of when I go to a korean BBQ or Japanese restaurant. Nice presentation and nice flavor.
- The wedge salad was interesting. Litterally a chopped head. Don't think you're expected to finish all of it, but if you managed to do so, good for you. haha. 
- The steak and fillet mignon were excellent! Very juicy and tender. High recommendation. But if I had to chose, I go with the sirloin over the fillet.

5314984,2015-01-22,2,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Impeccable service but mediocre food. We have been here a handful of times in the past for lunch, but we were disappointed last time and this time again. We like the comfy booth seating and large windows facing the Strip. The service is friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Unfortunately the food does not match up. 

Appetizer: the only good dish we had today was the fried calamari with peppers though it was a bit oily. 

Soup: French onion soup looked appetizing, but the soup and onions were way too salty. 

Lunch entrees: Salmon and mango salad with champagne vinegrette had potential, but the salmon was dry on the sides and lacked flavor. The mangos were hard and sour. Previous Yelper had voiced disappointment with this dish too. 

Chilean Seabass was so-so and a tad dry, but the mushrooms were unbearably salty in the soy sauce. Palazzo's SushiSamba has way better moist Chilean sea bass. 

Lobster and crab cake burger is supposed to be a top seller, but the crab cake had too much flour. The lobster also was dry. The housemade salt and vinegar chips were good. 

Side: lobster mac n' cheese was a disappointment as the lobsters did not taste fresh. The lobster was very dry and far from succulent. I often order this dish at various restaurant, and this was one of the worse ones since the lobster was bad. The mac n'cheese were good though. If you like lobster, go to Top of the World at the Stratosphere for fresh succulent Canadian lobster. 

Dessert: they were very kind and offered us a dessert duo of chocolate cake and cheesecake. We were hoping the dessert would be better, but unfortunately, the best part about dessert were the fresh berries that came with it. There is a fresh berries dessert on the menu too. I would recommend that. 

Overall, the service is great, but the food was disappointing. With so many delicious culinary delights to choose from in Vegas, Capital Grille does not stand the heat. It needs to improve it's quality and taste of food. I have never been for dinner, but lunch was a regrettable experience.",28GvL338IP1NZHmQMrK6gg,1,0,2,2BDE-QipgbTP3ufaYylYbg

My server changed out my white napkin for a black one cuz I was wearing black pants and she didn't want lint to get all over me.  I have been to all kinds of establishments and this was the first time I have had this happen to me...5 stars for that alone.

So 2 of us shared a burger and a basket of truffled fries and a mediterranean salad with chicken.  The server had the kitchen split everything for us which was great.  The burger came out on plates that had holes for their sauce container and let me tell you that was one good burger.  This place sure knows how to handle their beef.  And the truffle fries were good but the only back part is I like skinny fries but it was greatr otherwise.  I can't say the same for the chicken in my salad though.  The salad was great but the chicken was dry as h***....which was why I had to take out one star.  I should know by now never order chicken or seafood at a steakhouse.

Clam Chowder  OR Field Greens,
Dry-Aged Sirloin Salad OR Grille's Signature Cheeseburger OR Caesar Salad with Chicken Breast OR Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon,

Clam Chowder:
Generous amount of clams. Good chowder. 4/5

Dry-Aged Sirloin Salad:
I was expecting a few slices of steak on a bed of greens but I got a big piece of steak (about 10oz) with a side of greens.  The menu description said it comes with arugula but mine was spinach. It has roasted peppers and mozzarella with olive oil and balsamic dressing. 3.5/5

Grille's Signature Cheeseburger with Truffle Fries:
I've been coming to Capital Grille for years now that somehow it doesn't seem so special anymore.  I always get either a steak or a burger with truffle fries.  Shawn asked me why I never told him about CG's burger and truffle fries...oops, sorry! But yes, the beef patty is totally delicious and quite big and the fries...ooohhh...5/5

Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake:
A dense chocolate cake. The espresso emphasizes the chocolate flavor. Try not to inhale if you have a piece of this cake in your mouth, the cocoa powder on top will choke you. 4/5

Creme Brulee:
Rich and creamy made with real vanilla beans. The caramelized top isn't one whole piece...more like drops of caramelized sugar but that didn't affect the texture or the taste. 4/5

I like this place and I've never had a bad experience.  They're consistently good (food and service). You can get a view of the Wynn and Encore.

5330900,2013-06-15,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"My husband and I have been to The Capital Grille in Atlanta, New York and Washington DC and this one is the WORST of them all!

Don't get me wrong, their food were still great especially their steaks - very juicy and flavorful; keep the two stars just for their steaks. That's why I'm still keeping the 3 stars for their steaks and side dishes. 

Here were what we've experienced that disappointed us:

1 - Front desk hostesses: unfriendly, didn't greet us when we arrived or even say a word; we stood  and waited for 1min and walked closer to them to say ""hi"", then they asked ""reservation?"" without a smile. We said ""Yes, reservation at 7pm"" then they looked at the book and said ""just a moment"" and we stood and waited aside for a good 8min before they led us to a table.

2 - Our female server walked back and forth busy serving other tables and we were seated at the table for 12min, Seriously? You can't just come by to take drink orders or even just ask us to give a few more minutes?

3 - She was very impatience; we wanted to ask for the best bottle of wine for our food, she didn't get us the correct wine menu so she had to go get it a couple of times and gave us a weird unhappy look then she returned and said ""you might need a moment to look, I'll be back"" then walked away. Hence, we waited for another 10min before we ordered our drink.

4 - Food-wise, everything was perfect until dessert; we ordered their creme brule and that's what we always order; however, when it came, the entire creme brule was freezing cold and firm! Usually the bottom egg part is soft and cold with warm top sugar crust that is freshly made to order. It looked and tasted like something they put in the fridge overnight (perhaps someone didn't want it). So we told our server, she didn't even look/check the creme brule and immediately said ""it IS how we do it, you can talk to our manager if you want""

Oh my lord! Really?! That pissed my husband off so badly! So of course we wanted to speak to their manager; the manager came and first he said the same thing that it was how they do it without checking it, we asked him to look closer and he started to realize the weird firmness of the brule. He started to apologize and to bring a freshly made one out to us, and removing the brule from the check.

As much as we love The Capital Grille in other cities, we will definitely pass this one and not recommend to anyone.",3_ZXnwgmEMJx2ZRwp_nl6w,13,2,3,lVi9deSq9WhHUKDvtUzbVg

FOOD (4.2 out of 5)
Appetizers:
Calamari: Good, I wouldnt bother ordering it again,

Entree:
Mine: I ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail.  I always get my steaks medium rare and this tenderloin was absolutely perfect.  The taste was very juicy and succulent.  The lobster tail did not have much flavor to it, but it still tasted good but not as amazing as the tenderloin.  I savored the taste of the tenderloin ohhh how lovely it tasted. 

His: Filet mignon w. crab meat: I took a bite of his filet mignon and from I remembered it was a bit overcooked but thats (Brad T.'s story to tell), I loved the taste of the crab meat though! MMMMmmm

Desserts: (Since it was complimentary) 
I was astonished how huge the desserts were!  
Coconut Creme Pie:  I personally did not like it very much,  I felt like it was too creamy for me.  I had a few bites here and there and the taste is good but I couldnt handle eating more of it.

Chocolate hazelnut cake: Loving chocolate, I enjoyed the cake alot. It wasn't very sweet at all & of course I had to take it home.  I couldnt finish it all.


SERVICE (4 out of 5) 
The hostesses were very professional.  
Our server was sweet.  She was okay in the beginning but she got better as the night went on.  We normally dont require much attention as long as our water is refilled we are pretty much set for the rest of the night.  

ATMOSPHERE (3.8 out of 5)

As we walk down the corridor it seemed like a nice and calm place.  As we were escorted to the dining area, we notice the scene became much more lively, in a nice way.  The kitchen is viewable from anywhere you're seated and we sat somewhat in the center.  The kitchen reminds me of the one in Hell's Kitchen! Everything looked really nice; nice ambiance and food presentation.

Now, for the food.  We ordered the Wagyu beef carpaccio, clam chowder, lobster mac 'n' cheese and filet mignon.  Btw, the bread basket was good too...nice variety.  The beef carpaccio was OK...a little too much of the wasabi flavor.  The clam chowder and lobster mac 'n' cheese...MMMmmmm!!  Both were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (I also generally a fan of mac 'n' cheese)!!  However, I expected much more lobster in the mac 'n'cheese.  The filet mignon was alright; whatever sauce they plated the filet with was salty.  I asked for the meat to be cooked to Medium and it was still pretty juicy--I've had much better for about half the price.

If I was rating based on the main dish alone I would go with 3 stars.  The view, soup and mac 'n' cheese tipped me over to 4 stars.

We were sat at a table that was near the window which over looked the strip. They started us off with a basket of mixed types of bread and butter and then we had the mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto, tomatoes, basil and balsamic vinaigrette as an appetizer.  My man had the bone in rib eye with a butter glaze and I had the swordfish topped with crab. We shared grilled asparagus and scalloped potatoes. 
I know a steak is good for my man when he does not grab the salt and pepper. He said it was delicious, tender and cooked to perfection.  My swordfish and crab was delicious. The swordfish was cooked perfectly. The lemon sauce over it was subtle but flavorful. The crab was piled high on top of the fish. I am so glad I ordered it and I would definitely order it again. The asparagus was grilled just right with a half of a lemon on the side. The potatoes au gratin were amazing, cheesey and the portion was huge. There was so much food we took a huge goodie bag home.

Stoli Doli
Aka Pineapple Martini.  I think I could have drank 4 or 5 of these if I had no self control.  Delicious, and they go down easy.

French Onion Soup
Sweet onions under melted cheeses.  Rich beef broth. Really good.

Wedge with Bleu Cheese and Smoked Bacon
Cool Iceberg Lettuce with thick bacon chunks and grape tomatoes.  Great dressing.  Split it, it would be too much for just one person unless that's all your eating.

I saw some pretty awesome looking lobster tails on Yelp and tried to order one to split.  The waiter said all they have were the small ones poached in butter they serve with the Seared Tenderloin.   They were pretty good and only cost $11.00 each.

Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with 15-Year Aged Balsamic
Here's where we get a little sideways with dinner.  So this is their signature steak.  My GF and I both didn't like the 15-Year Aged Balsamic.  It pretty much took over the Ribeye and put it in a headlock.  The vinegar was too sweet and overpowered what was a great steak.  I know, just my opinion.  Some folks seem to love it.  My advice, get it on the side if you must.

Our waiter took it back and they took off most of the Balsamic.  It was better, but you could still taste the vinegar.  I'd go with the Bone-In Ribeye - 22 oz next time.

Everything was just all right, nothing amazing or special. I had heard so much talk about how great this fancy restaurant was over the years.

Am I the only person who doesn't realize everyone around you wants to yell at you for giving the waiter a well-done answer? Who cares. I like my meat well done. I don't like the taste of blood swirling in my mouth and any hint of it even if it's at medium well will make me have a hard time swallowing it. I will chew that sucker like gum until i realize this is getting disgusting. 

Okay onward...I had the filet mignon with the mash potatoes and it was delicious! Even at well done that thing filet mignon'd. That doesn't make sense, but I just wanted to type that. What I'm saying is, just because m y cut of steak was thoroughly cooked...it did not fall short of what we know of filet mignon to be. It was yumgasmic and my carnivorous side was awoken. Like butter to carve into. Nothing fell short in my meal, except for the key lime pie I opted to try. I never had it. Twas my first time and I swear it tasted literally like a key...squirted with lime...made into a pie. Hence, key lime pie. I don't have anything to compare it to other than I will never eat a key lime pie for as long as I live. I will order a filet mignon rare (gulp) if I had a choice between the two. 

With that said...CG did not disappoint (unless you're coming for key lime pie and expecting it to not taste like a key...lime...pie). Service was wonderful! While there are other great steakhouses in and along the boulevard...it's nice that this one isn't tucked into one of the casinos. 

A definite potential for steak option along the strip. Certainly recommend! I'd leave the kids at home on this trip, though!

I came here to take my attorneys out for a good dinner that turned bad. The Capital Grille is known to be a great steak house but they totally missed the mark; at least when I was there.

Long story short, I ordered the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip ""MEDIUM"" and some parts were good but the majority of it was rare. I sent it back to get it redone and it came in looking burnt. The manager was kind enough to take this steak off the check but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.

To start, we got seated right at the window looking north up the strip, and we could see the Wynn and Encore across the street.  It might have been romantic, if I wasn't dining with a couple other guys...

The ambiance was nice - like a quiet version of Fleming's with a touch of the Rat Pack.  Paintings of notable faces from the old days of Vegas hung on the walls in various corners of the restaurant.  Speaking of Fleming's, the menu resembled theirs in format and pricing.  The service was exceptional - very attentive, but not overbearing.

I got the lamb chops, which were outstanding!  I ordered med-rare, and they came very pink and warm - perfect!  They served it with a cherry compote, which was a perfect compliment - I'm not a fan of the mint jelly that often accompanies lamb.  One of my friends ordered the Delmonico steak, which is a 22 oz bone-in ribeye.  All of their beef is dry-aged in-house.  As good as my lamb was, I was coveting that steak, and he said it was great.

5663213,2008-03-27,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"What to say about The Capital Grille?? Well for starters I LOVE THE CAPITAL GRILLE!!!!! This is my fourth time coming here and I am continually impressed by this place. I have been to quite a few steak houses ( Boa, Smith & Wollensky, etc.) and this place is by far the best!!! 

The decor is wonderful with dark woods, brass fixtures, and huge Tiffany style chandeliers. There is about a 180 degree view of the city from the 3rd floor restaurant. There is a perfect level of jazz being played through out the restaurant. Just loud enough to be heard and drowned out some of the noise but not to loud that you hear it over your own conversation. 

We were seated immediately in a very private booth with a nice view of the city. Shortly after our server appeared with a basket of warm, fresh breads and butter. The basket contained what seemed to be  sourdough, sesame and poppy seed rolls, a sweet brown bread, and a flat sesame type flat bread. 

For our appetizer we had the Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers.($13) This is the best calamari I have ever had.( and I have put away a few tons of calamari in my life!!) It comes out in a heaping pile which is then french served to us by our server. We squeeze a little lemon on it and that's all it needs. It is not served with a sauce which it did not need anyway. It is crispy and not chewy, sweet from the cherry peppers but also a little heat from them. Just the perfect amount of flavors that result in it not needing sauce or anything else just to be eaten and enjoyed.

The second course was a Spinach with Warm Bacon Dressing Salad.($9) They split it for the GF and I in the kitchen which was nice. It was a perfect sized salad with the right amount of fresh bacon, hard boiled egg, and red onion. The salad was excellent and it reminded me of the one my great grandma used to make me when I was a kid. Which no other spinach salad has done for me. Another great course.

For our entrees I had the 24 oz. Dry Aged Porterhouse. ($41) It was HUGE and TENDER!!! The New York Side was so good it reminded me of a filet. Then I tasted the filet side which I could only compare to something just melting in your mouth. It was cooked to a perfect Med Rare. It is not served with and sauce nor does it need it. It is just excellent meat served by itself for you to enjoy. The GF had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Caramelized Shallot Butter. ($40) It was served on a plate topped with the caramelized shallot butter and two shallots. This was quite a large steak as well. The couple bites I had were amazing. You could taste the coffee but also the sweetness from the caramelized shallots. It was also insanely tender. WOW what a wonderful steak. For our sides we ordered The Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese.  The fries were awesome great truffle flavor and crunchy but not to oily. The lobster mac was Great!! Excellent flavor and lots of large chunks of lobster. It was so rich we couldn't even finish it. 

We finished off our meal with their signature coconut cream pie and the flour-less chocolate espresso cake. My GF loved the coconut cream pie. I love coconut cream pie but thought this one was good nothing too special. Now the flour-less chocolate cake on the other hand was the best thing ever. Little hints of espresso and raspberry sauce and a thick chocolaty fudge like consistency. AMAZING!!! 

The ONLY bad thing was my GF only ate about 1/4 of her steak so we asked for it to go. You guessed it someone threw it away!!!!! I finally had a reason to give this place 4 stars. Then our server stepped up and said the kitchen was making a new one right now and cooking it to rare so we could finish it off at home and it would come out medium rare!!! WOW that's a save!! 5 stars welcome back. 

All I have to say is please try this place. For the size and quality this place is a little cheaper than some of the others in town and I think it is the BEST. Service is always good and the food never disappoints.",cmR12osCE30jlFCVUHJQEg,2,1,5,rWVJybXuHvdvwiSHZ1UVfw

It is dry aged which is good and compared to the price and quality of other steakhouses I have been to in Vegas it is OK.   Their signature steak is the ribeye but I am not really a fan of ribeye steaks due to their fattiness. The sides were excellent along with the French onion soup. The chef prepared a special complementary appetizer of shrimp tempura which was excellent and appreciated.

Was surprised that the server did not notice this, but he didn't complain when she asked how we were all doing. I ordered the special of the night, which was a 10oz ribeye. Server came back to say they were all out of the specials, so there were two other ribeye choices on the menu. I didn't have the menu to look at anymore, so she recommended I order the ribeye that my husband wasn't already getting. It ended up to be a 22oz kona rubbed. I had no idea they would use coffee grounds; I just kept wondering why the surface had the consistency of dirt. I figured it out once I looked it up later. Frankly, I'd rather have a steak from Chili's. My husband was not too happy with his ribeye. I think it had a porcini sauce that he thought was too sweet. Our other friend had a filet, and she had no complaints. We also ordered the lobster Mac n cheese, which we order pretty much anywhere we go that has it; it was just meh. I had the spinach salad, which was also just ok. I have had better at Applebee's. We also had the truffle fries, but they were not very crispy or impressive. Yikes!

The grilled prosciutto and mozzarella was delicious, the Caesar salad was tasty but slightly over dressed, and the potatoes au gratin were amazing.

5837934,2017-11-26,2,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"This meal began well with an excellent meaty Shrimp Cocktail with zesty Cocktail Sauce.  And we were graciously accommodated with well-cooked Calamari Fritti prepared without Cherry Peppers (since Diane likes nothing spicy at all), and supplied with delectable specially requested Lemon Aioli in addition to Marinara Sauce.  The complimentary Bread Basket was also enjoyable, with lavosh liberally included in it.

After first being startled with a cup of French Onion Soup instead of the large crock I ordered, the understandable mistake (since I ordered so much food) was quickly remedied by our server, and to Diane's delight I ultimately received a vessel of cheesy soup overflowing with rivulets of Havarti Cheese.  The broth was bitter on top but sweet on the bottom.  Although she hates onions, Diane loves to peel off and eat cheese that runs down and congeals on the sides of ceramic containers holding French Onion Soup.  A Wedge Salad slathered with Bleu Cheese Dressing and peppered with fresh tomatoes seemed almost endless, and took over five minutes for me to fully consume.  

While the Filet Mignon was well seasoned and prepared medium rare as ordered, its pairing with Butter Poached Lobster was a distinct disappointment, because the lobster was very tough and not at all sweet.  Grilled Asparagus was well cooked but quickly became cold, while sauteed Wild Mushrooms were a welcome accompaniment, and excellent Bearnaise Sauce was complemented by a just as tasty Red Wine Reduction.  A large Baked Potato with chives and chunks of pork belly was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked, but I would have greatly preferred real bacon pieces instead of the squishy pork belly. 

I almost resisted dessert but ultimately failed in my resolve, and compromised on Seasonal Mixed Berries with Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise.  The mixed berries were fresh but not that sweet.  Overall, service was good, but Diane had to continually ask for water refills.

Usually the culinary experience here has been topnotch from beginning to end.  But this time the tough, tasteless lobster ruined the outing for me--especially for the high Strip prices of over $100 per person (even without alcohol) charged.

So, this time XXX-1/2 stars overall.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,4,3,CsaVUxZWXETUEB_04doDTw

My family and I made dinner reservations at The Capital Grille for New Years Eve.  It turned out to be the perfect place for such an occasion!  The food was out of this world, the ambiance was relaxing and wonderful, and the service was flawless!

The restaurant is located on an upper floor of the Fashion Show mall on the Vegas Strip.  The inside of The Capital Grille is decorated very nicely.  The restaurant has windows from the floor to the ceiling, which offer a great view of the Strip!  Our reservations were for 5:30 p.m.  It was nice because we got to watch the Vegas strip fade from daytime to all lit up and sparkling at night.

The food- oh my goodness.  Everything was divine.  My table started with the fried calamari.  The calamari was served without any dipping sauces.  We were confused at first, but quickly realized why.  The golden calamari was served covered in a hot cherry pepper sauce.  It was amazing!

As my entree, I ordered the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails (Their version of Surf n Turf).  The meal was perfection.  I had my meal with a side of the Lobster Mac n Cheese- one of the best I've ever had- and I pretty much order Lobster Mac n Cheese whenever I see it on a menu!  It was so crispy and flavorful.

My mom ordered the Fresh Maine Lobster.  My sister ordered the chef's suggestion- Bone In Ribeye in a 15-Year Aged Balsamic.  I tried both and they were equally delicious!

We somehow saved room for dessert.  Actually, we did not.  The meal to that point had just been so great that we knew we had to try the last course they had to offer.  Once we heard that the desserts were made in house, we were sold.  We split the Capital Grille Cheesecake with mixed berries.  The cheesecake was made brulee-style, with the crispy sugary top.  It was literally the best piece of cheesecake I've ever had.

As if the food wasn't enough of a selling point, the service was so great.  Our server's name was Juan.  Juan was extremely attentive and friendly.  He provided professional service, but maintained a down to earth disposition.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good steak or seafood dinner in Vegas.  It is pricier than average, but so worth it!",PtV45pQ1JpGVp6EeGyqS3g,5,3,5,apbLTomzgB0Q-yhHgUNQJQ

The waiter was very efficient and fast.
The food was exceptional. Everybody was very happy with their choices. I have to admit that the bone in Ribeye was somewhat not as tender as I expected, but this was balanced out by the wonderful taste. 
We will definitely come back!",qBXyjJGLOSDVIaSFkMvWgw,1,0,5,t0aGy7EnlvIgqUlpmdyUMA
5863745,2016-11-05,0,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"One of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas. We have eaten here every time we visit Vegas.  The atmosphere and service are first rate.  The staff couldn't be friendlier and efficient.  Great cocktails and a tremendous wine selection.  And the food...Oh the food!!  Appetizers are varied with a crab meat cocktail that surprised, all lump crab meat with a delicious dipping sauce.  The porcini rubbed bone-in rib eye with 15 year aged balsamic is the absolute bomb!! Possibly the best steak that I have had, and I have had many! The sides are shared as is customary in most steakhouses and are fresh and flavorful.  Make sure that you order the lobster mac and cheese...outstanding!!  Desserts...well I don't know since I never make it past the fabulous food.
I highly recommend this place for a truly 5 star dining experience.
For an extra special dining experience be sure to ask to be seated with Frankie!! The entertainment value adds to your evening's enjoyment...",eh6pC8o7rCYT94oaGN-_eQ,0,0,5,Mt9ttGq2a2s2eLSGFsobiA
5880959,2015-01-10,2,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"Capital Grille has always been one of our favorite places to go for a ""dress-up, fancy"" dinner.  We usually save dinners at this location for our birthdays or anniversaries.  As all Capital Grille locations go, the ambiance is outstanding and the decor beautiful.  The Las Vegas location looks over the strip, so if you can get a window seat, it's pretty cool.  You're right across the street from the Wynn and located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall.
We usually get steaks here, as they are awesome.  The Porcini Rubbed Aged Balsamic Rib Eye is my absolute favorite.  The spinach salad with bacon is in my opinion, the best salad.  You can order lobster as an appetizer and they will pull it out of the shell and cut it up in to bite size pieces, which makes for a very fancy app.  The lobster mac-n-cheese is just awesome.  It's rich and has many pieces of lobster, so highly recommend this as a side dish.  The asparagus is also good.
The last couple times we've been to the Capital Grille (2014 and 2013), we've been sat next to tables with children.  In 2013, in fact, when we were seated, we noticed a very large party that was coming in soon...as there was a huge, long table prepared behind us.  When they arrived, there were more children than adults and they were out of control.  This ruined the experience.  Last fall, 2014, when we visited for our anniversary, we were sat, and once again next to children...we asked to be moved, and the next table was also next to a child, which, thank goodness was quiet, but the table location sucked.  We believe that an upscale, fancy, expensive restaurant should have a section where they put people with children so the other people that are dining out and celebrating special dates can have a peaceful meal.  Because of these last two experiences, we've decided that we will no longer go to the Capital Grille for special celebrations...this is disappointing, as the food is always good.",iSFnLrF8vHZW_bkfwKFBCw,0,0,4,tmcSRLerWrPWnkquzANPeA

My date and I had herb crusted chicken, surf-n-turf, lobster bisque (the best I have ever had), prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with tomatoes (to die for), cheesecake and caesars salad. My steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection and seemed to melt in my mouth. I sat by the window and enjoyed the view. The décor was a bit dark for my taste but the service and food made this a non issue. The waiters and staff is what sold me here. They were warm attentive and personable.

Our server was great and I really liked the special touches they did on the table for our anniversary. They also take a photo complimentary that prints out during dinner too. However, to be quite honest the food was just ok. The parmesan crusted sole tasted like only parmesan. The portion was huge though but unappetizing. I did like the green beans and the fries were tasty. My boyfriend did not care for the steak that much. The two different wines we had we did like and the salad for starter was good too. For the price and the lack of taste in the entrees I do not see us coming back.",yhsWUWex0RtJvOwdRnZLuA,0,0,3,vmb2yqm3kRLcpiOKhuS5iA

My Brussel Sprout salad was so old and wilted was shocked they brought it to the table.  Bottle of red wine we ordered was too warm to drink and no complimentary dessert for our anniversary as is their tradition. Lots if steak in Vegas.

The filet mignon was cooked to perfection. The oysters were fresh and super tasty. The mozzarella, tomato and basil salad was great. We ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes as our side dishes and oh heaven! I love that they had 1/2 bottles of some great wines, perfect for one person when no one else at your table wants to drink the same thing. We went for a birthday celebration and they brought a very nice birthday dessert out. The service was excellent, as you would expect. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that it is so expensive...over $100 per person. Worth it though for a special occasion!",-COiDOe9fjdZuGHhcFXhqg,2,0,4,3_z7i5Gc5XGXu2GId7_Bug

Our server Chuck was so nice and attentive didn't make us feel rushed like some other steakhouses I've been too. He was very knowledgeable of the menu with great recommendations! We started off with the lobster bisque and French onion soup. Though you cant necessarily compare the two the French onion was my favorite. Definitely should've ordered the bowl. I also extremely enjoyed the filet Oscar with crab. The meat was so tender and the bernaise sauce  complimented it very well. On the menu most of the steaks did not come with a side luckily mine came with asparagus. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese to share. YUM! I'm a huge fan of Mac and cheese and this was probably the best I've ever had.

5979163,2015-06-06,1,Rd11Bosr8JkfoUhZLzpuxg,"This is not a restaurant I would normally come to, but my boyfriend picked it for our anniversary last week (he somehow always picks steakhouses when I let him choose..)

We arrived at 4pm for our 4.30 reservation (we were also catching a show) and were promptly seated at a table by the window. They had a hand-written card thanking us for choosing them for our anniversary with heart-shaped sequins sprinkled on the table. We had a lovely view of the empty lot next door, which actually proved to be pretty entertaining. There were lots of drunk girls leaving the dayclubs at wynn/encore in their bikinis, and one guy who climbed out the escape hatch of a party bus and consequently had his entire group evicted from the bus. I imagine the people watching is probably less entertaining in the winter.

The food is pretty so-so, what you would expect from a chain steakhouse. I had the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails and my boyfriend had the Dry Aged Sirloin. We also had a side of the Sam's Mashed Potatoes. My steak was more medium than medium-rare, which I have found seems to be a problem at many places; I would probably order it rare in the future. The mashed potatoes were melt-in-your mouth delicious and oh-so buttery. When I ate the leftovers in the morning it tasted like I was eating a stick of butter (to clarify, I think that sounds delicious). 

What really put this from a 3-star to a 4-star review was all the little nice things they did for us for our anniversary. In addition to the cards and sequins, they also made us a dessert plate that said ""happy anniversary"" on it and brought out 2 glasses of sparkling wine. The waitress (Anali? Alani? something that started with an A) was friendly and helpful and really helped make our special day special.

Edit: looking back at pictures, I now remember that we also had the steak tartare. I remember thinking it was good at the time, but it apparently wasn't very memorable.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,3,2,4,wPHR4Bff2R3z3-ui6Up0ew
