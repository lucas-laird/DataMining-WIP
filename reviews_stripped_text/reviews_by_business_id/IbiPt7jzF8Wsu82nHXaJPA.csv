I had dinner with my son Sunday March 20.  We ordered a Nepali vegetarian thali and an Indian lamb korma.

Lunch is a super-cheap $10/pp for a selection of about 5 vegetarian and 5 carnivorous entree options, two choices of rice, and a fresh bar of vegetables and condiments. 

Selection may be a bit small compared to other spots in town, but these guys do everything well- the goat curry was easily the most meaty version I've found even including a la carte ordering, their raita was uniquely flavorful with fresh herbs, and naan was made fresh for the table. I'm an omnivore, but the palak paneer and gobi aloo are the stuff vegan dreams are made of! I wish they'd add to their appetizer/dessert items- I only found a single samosa and a tiny cup of rice pudding, and was sad not to be able to end my meal with gulab jamun. 

Saino is definitely worth a visit. Signage and decor indicate that they provide Himalayan and Nepalese cuisine but their current offerings seem to be mostly Indian cuisine.

     Off to Saino! We got there about 12:30 and were immediately  seated at a corner table, fully set with linen. Pretty impressive for a lunch buffet.
     As a worker in the food industry for forty years, I was duly impressed with the quality and freshness of the food on the buffet.
    My daughter and i are both big fans of goat and the goat curry did not disappoint. The vegetable dishes may have been even more impressive. I could have filled up on those alone. Especially  the navataran korma and the pakora. Oh yeah, plenty of warm , fresh naan was brought to the table as well.
     And our server, Reshma, what can I say? She was a jewel. a sweet ingenuous young woman who was genuinely happy to answer my questions about the dishes on the buffet and put up with my silly jokes.
   All in all, a delightful experience. Will have to go back some night and try the ala carte menu.

After 20 mins of waiting for take out the host comes to inform me the Fish Pakora appetizer was unavailable and I could choose someone else or get a refund. I choose the veggie dumplings.

30 mins later I received my food.  Got home and tasted my food and realized the curry I ordered at the ""very spicy"" level (most spicy you can order) had no spice at all. 

After not having received my order, waiting 20 mins to tell me there was no fish pakora and having zero spice in my curry- I was pretty frustrated.


In reply to your comment about my review.....it's definitely ok that you never got the message from Yelp. What's not ok is to tell me the food would be 10-15 mins later after I placed the order, then tell me 20 mins later there's no appetizer I ordered and then wait another 30 mins to get my food.

Their menu is rather large, skip few pages and go to Nepali cuisine part. Their momos were heavenly. Especially all of their sauces were made from scratch and elevated food to another level.

The place is clean. It is run by a Nepali family. I asked the waitress for recommendations on Nepali food and she suggested the ones that I end up ordereding.

I liked Haddiko Soup that is a goat bone soup. It is a popular nepali soup specially prepared of bone marrow of goat with mild nepali spices. However, I didn't like Goat Bhootan. I thought I would try something unusual such as this dish that is a special nepali dish where stomach, liver, intestine and lungs of goat will be fried along with nepali spices, fashioned with onions and cilantro and it was served with rice.

Garlic Naan, they were warm and soft whole-wheat flour bread topped with garlic and cilantro.

have Goat curry on Buffet during lunch which I would love to return for. Keep up the great experience!",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,2,0,4,aIz39_cI5wWTicau2kvbEQ

The food  is not overly flavorful and not terribly bland, yet lacks the expected spice entourage associated with Indian Cuisine. The Lassi be it salt or Mango is sour. I personally did not mind it much though it was unexpected. My guests were not so impressed. 
The Garlic Naan was very mild and our Mali Kofta was neutral on the flavor scale. The Paneer Tikka fell in the same neutral category though the cheese was very plump and firm. 

No dessert on this visit.

If you enjoy neutral flavors and do not deal with spice well this may be a good place to go. With such a diverse selection of Indian Cuisine in Las Vegas it fell in the lower spectrum in comparison though I would consider bringing a hesitant friend with a soft palate here.",bgJLZAEaB04x9UQIm3sATQ,2,1,2,Odu-7hmsVirF6ObDzikfpQ

3970047,2016-06-29,7,IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA,"There is a lot going on here that is good but the negatives pull the rating down.  Four of us gathered here and ordered extensively from the menu.  Items ordered:

Onion bhajji
Vegetable pakoras
Aaloo jeeraa
Garlic naan
Chicken fry momo
Dhindo
Tandoori mixed grill
Tandoori roti
Paneer kulcha
Goat bhootan
Kheer
Suji haluwaa
Papadam served with mint and tamarind chutneys (house provides)

The standouts were the onion bhajji, aaloo jeera, dhindo, and goat bhootan.  The potatoes of the aaloo jeera were nicely seasoned.  The dhindo is an interesting dish of millet stirred with hot water that comes out looking like a mound of not so good looking dark mashed potatoes.  By itself, there's not much flavor, but the goat bone soup, mustard greens, and spicy ginger served with it gave it a great flavor--especially the goat bone soup.

The goat bhootan was one of my top picks of the restaurant  The dish consists of goat stomach, liver, intestine, and lung.  The liver was especially flavorful.  A do again dish.  Another pick was the onion bhajji while the vegetable pakoras were good but standard for any Indian restaurant.

The negatives for Saino come from the service and the billing.  We had to ask for water refills, there was a language problem at times, being out of stock on one of the few desserts, and last but not least--being charged for items not ordered and not delivered a fact I noticed when I got home.  The dessert we ordered that they were out of was charged anyway.  We ordered steamed momo and we got fried instead of steamed.  That may have been a language problem but we were charged for both steamed and fried.  We had not ordered the fried.  In addition, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm with thermostat turned quite high and the few ceiling fans not able to keep the place within comfort zone for me.

I do want to go back and see what the lunch buffet is like and the items I mentioned above as my favorites are worth a return for them.  I'll be more careful before paying the next time.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,10,3,bCRqFOjEdivchq9gt0P1pA

I also really like Indian food. I went today at 2pm for the lunch buffet. The restaurant had a table of 8 and a table of two they were already eating. You have to wait to be seated and I stood there long enough to were I almost walked out. I was finally seated and she said she would bring me water. I understand that the buffet ends at 3 but the food in the warmers was very low and it had that crust along the edges of the pans that happens when stuff sits to long. Ok so I was starving and I got my first plate and went back to my seat and I had no water or server. I was looking around the restaurant and there was 3 dirty tables no one was cleaning them . I finished my first plate and oh look there is the lady that works there she is talking to the table behind me holding the water picture.                 She said oh sorry here is your water. I went up for another plate and out of no where the only employee in the place came out with a plate of white rice she said would you like some before I fill it in the warmer tray I said sure. I went to sit down and she asked if I would like some naan I said yes and once again she took forever to come back with a water refill and naan.            

I'm a pretty fair yelper I think this is my longest review and that would be because this is the worst place I have been to. The tables that were dirty stayed dirty. The lady that was working took time to remove the tip from one of them but she didn't clean it. The food tasted good but for me if I have shitty service the food doesn't matter. I ate fast and I got out of that place. I seriously won't be surprised if the health department shows up there or it will probably be on dirty dining. I still have faith in my fellow yelpers and maybe I went on a off day meaning everyone was off except that lady that really didn't give a shit about her customers.

We came in on a Sunday afternoon and the place was dead. That can be a good and bad thing at a buffet. Good thing being no lines or people to bother you. Bad thing could be the food might be old. We didn't need to worry about long lines but the food was definitely not old! I was happy to see the sweet rice and of course chicken tikka masala. One thing I've steered away from before was the saag paneer which was really delicious. They had a vegetarian kofta in a curry type sauce that was pleasantly delicious for being vegetarian. I didn't try the lamb or goat but was told it was alright by my significant other. Of course we had all the fixings with garlic naan. No other way to wash it down with nothing less that a mango lassi. I did forget to use our 15% off with yelp check in but maybe I'll use it again in the future. Service was spot on but of course we were the only diners. I'd say it's competing with my other favorite Indian spot Delhi. We'll see how they do!",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,7,4,3,i84kDVnl2_-6SdCUfyRejw
5123020,2016-06-18,9,IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA,"Conversation with waiter this week:

Me: ""Hey do you guys have a dinner buffet?""
Waiter: ""Yes, also dinner buffet""
Me: ""How much is the dinner buffet?""
Waiter: ""$9.95""
Me: ""Same items pretty much?""
Waiter: ""yes""
Me: ""Wow, you guys are the only Indian restaurant in town to offer a dinner buffet.""

(Finished meal)

Me: ""Hey that was good, I'll definitely be back with some friends for your dinner buffet.""

(Fast forward to Friday)

I cut my workout early and raced over to Saino to meet friends at 7pm since I had plans later at 9pm.

We get there...no buffet.

I said, ""I was here on Monday and was told by the waiter via a full discussion that you guys offer an indian buffet for dinner.""

Lady: ""No, we don't have an Indian buffet for dinner.""
Me: ""Never? Why would your waiter tell me that?""
Lady: ""No, we don't.""

I don't get the point of wasting people's time with incorrect information, having me disappoint my friends with your incorrect information to get them in the restaurant (and have them order off the regular menu). We left.

The waiter obviously knew I was talking about a buffet at dinner time because he said it was the same price as the price of lunch.

The price of 9.95 is good...but go to Mt Everest or Mint for a couple dollars more for a much better buffet. The food is notches above this one and I can't stand having my time wasted.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,10,4,2,rY_3fum7nAYRFqGZ2VfsJw
5226026,2016-05-09,0,IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA,"I gotta be honest- I don't know the difference between Nepalese food and Indian food. All I know is that this is hands down the best Indian food in this city. It's not even a contest. We had lamb samosas, vegetable samosas with like a salad and yogurt on top ( I forgot the name of the actual menu item, but it's the 4th appetizer down) garlic naan with butter and the butter chicken. All were ridiculously delicious. The vegetable samosas with the yogurt were so flavorful and fresh. The lamb was so rich and moist. The naan was spot on and hot and fresh. The butter chicken was so rich, and coconutty - AMAZING!


The best part was- the service exceeded the food. I just can't believe what a great experience this was. 

Definitely on our regular restaurant rotation now.",z6vN2RkLbY8cv3QUw0EDiA,3,2,5,CgDenXBcorW3625jtO_lFg

5279101,2016-06-28,4,IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA,"Items Tasted:
Papadum with Tamarind and Mint Chutney, Vegetarian Pakora, Onion Bhajji, Garlic Naan, Aaloo Jeeraa, Fry Chicken Momo, Dhindo, Tandoori Mixed Grill Platter, Tandori Roti, Paneer Kulcha, Goat Bhootan, Suji Haluwaa, Kheer

Located on West Desert Inn Road, directly across from I-Naba which oddly features a South Decatur Boulevard address, Saino Indian Nepali Kitchen is not the sort of place patrons 'stumble upon' as the storefront is hidden well off both Streets behind a Sinclair Gas Station, yet claiming to be the first Nepalese/Himalayan Restaurant in all of Las Vegas the concept seemed worthy of investigation.

Thus far gathering much of its attention for a $9.95 lunch buffet, the still-labeled hot and cold tables showing the selection to be ""good, but mostly traditional Indian"" by a friend familiar with such things, the decision to partake in dinner at Saino was driven largely by the staff's inability to answer E-mails or explain by phone whether A la Carte options were offered from 11a-3p, the 6 o'clock arrival seeing five sat at a round table without a single other patron present until a quarter past seven.

No doubt a sizable menu, all items detailed with lengthy descriptions that often proved inaccurate as pictures of some helped guide choices both at the table and on the wall, those looking for attentive service are probably best to avoid Dinner at Saino as the waiters seem more intent on standing about chatting with colleagues or adjusting Indian Pop-Music than they are with refilling beverages or assuring accuracy to the tickets, water requiring repeated requests on more than one occasion while double charges were made for items not received - some sold out and another never requested.

 Not an expensive place, the waiter's reference to Sysco and US Foods during a discussion not unexpected but at the same time not ""brag-worthy"" as he made it seem, the meal started off predictably with crisp Bread served alongside Tamarind and Mint Chutney, the first courses delayed due to difficulty firing the Tandoori despite an arrival almost an hour after opening, another odd statement as the crispy Pakora and Onion Bhajji were both fried, anyway.

Ignoring the ubiquitous spelling mistakes on the menu, but more perplexed by the number of items with inconsistent pricing online versus the menu versus the bill, follow-ups to the tasty fried vegetables were delivered as a slow rollout with Garlic Naan that was typical, if not particularly memorable, a large plate of Aaloo Jeeraa providing the meal's first 'wow' moment by way of texture and the complexity of the spice profile while Chicken ""Mo-Mo"" was served fried as opposed to boiled, as requested, though perusal of the menu after leaving would show the table was charged for both.

Told that the signature Dhindo would take an hour to prepare, high heat and constant stirring turning Millet into a sort of mashed Root Vegetable texture that may not look all that appealing but springs to life when mixed with Bone Marrow fortified Goat Curry and pickled Vegetables, the Mixed Grill of Tandoori skewered Meats was tender, moist and well flavored with sizzling Bell Peppers and Onions that made vaguely resembled Fajitas, a particularly amusing association as the arrival only shortly preceded a basket of soft Roti that had been ordered much earlier in the meal.

Not served the Vegetarian Curry advertised with Dhindo, listed pickles omitted with several other plates, it was not really a shock that no rice arrived with the Goat Bhootan and although the very concept of this dish will likely be met by disgust by most diners the diversity of flavors and textures found amidst stewed Goat Offal was actually quite exemplary, the minerality of liver at times a touch harsh while alveolar tubes presented like well cooked calamari, all beneath a bold veil of spicing.

Particularly impressed by Paneer Kulcha, soft pockets of cheese baked right into the soft bread, desserts were a bit disappointing, particularly as Saino was ""sold out"" of Gajar Halva that the table was still charged for, the Suji Haluwaa something never seen prior but faintly resembling polenta in its texture while Rice Pudding was watery and just fair-to-middling.

THREE AND A HALF STARS:  A very worthwhile stop based only on the quality of cuisine, Saino Indian Nepali Kitchen's failures by way of service even prove a challenge to those expecting nothing more than the basics.  Not particularly 'shocking' in some ways, but at the same time not at all acceptable considering the omissions, overcharges and general lack of speed, one must assume the Lunch Buffet precludes some of these problems, though a la carte is the only way to order most of the more interesting and authentic Nepalese plates.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,7,3,HYhAnzdjyF5ID4OszTfgpg

The young lady working that night was very friendly and had our food bagged and ready to go shortly after arrival.  Carry-out was quick and simple.

As for the food, it's pretty darn good.  The chicken saag I had was full of flavor (though it could have been a tad spicier).  The vegetarian aloo dish we ordered was extremely good as well.  The naan was also quite tasty.

For the two of us, we dropped an easy $30 without drinks (wish it were a tad more affordable) but overall we liked the place.",5oTpQGLCjwIaQXm5spF7vA,2,0,4,vNwHG1nVsU8NQq3n0__aug
