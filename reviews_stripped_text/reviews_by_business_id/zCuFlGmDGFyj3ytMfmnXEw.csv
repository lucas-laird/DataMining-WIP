I went to the soda fountain area to get a drink in my SMALL cup. The area was dirty. There was only one other customer in there. The tables were also dirty.  When they called me that my order was ready the girl asked if I would like any sauce. I asked for malt vinegar. Well surprise surprise they were out. Seems to be a problem at this Long Johns with running out of things.  I gave my order back & asked for a refund. I WILL NEVER STOP THERE AGAIN.",JGcBwxfiN0_-lvVcEpk3xA,0,0,1,bCBRNSEKxV2_dzsaFsqU6Q

904386,2015-03-11,0,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,"Tuesday nite, got hungry for fish. Drove thru Long Johns Silvers around 6:30 pm, ordered fish/shrimp platter expecting an ok fish platter. Got home, opened the platter up and WOW, I'm not kidding, this fish and shrimp w/hush puppies was great. Fish was nice and huge and so was the shrimp, I'm talking JUMBO SHRIMP!!!!  Instead of sauce packets I was given little sauce cup which I liked much better.
Now normally I don't get this excited about a fast food place, but I enjoyed this meal so much I say ""GOOD JOB"" to the cook.  
Keep it up Long Johns Silvers on Durango near Cheyenne",KvuT3cYozI4ZFG3en-O7ww,0,0,5,CJFhXYRRqJ5CbH0AHEWedg
1985037,2014-06-13,0,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,I have had my last visit here. The service is Sloooow! The staff moves like a snail and never a smile. The place looks old and rundown. The area manager begged me to give the restaurant one more chance because he said things would improve. NO IMPROVEMENT AT ALL. The last place on Earth I would ever visit again!,w9z4RxpTpGg4pOlr1h2k_A,3,0,1,WZrXSq_pPhgj0O6ZBrk3sw
2413397,2012-07-16,1,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,"I only come here for ice cream (polar freezes) be prepared to wait, they cook to order so 10-20 minutes depending on your order.

Love this place, the employees are always polite and the food is always fresh! 

I wish they'd do more with chasing off the punks from their drive thru lane, I really HATE summertime here and all the tweens and teens roaming around drive thru lanes.",uZ4z-4ftg7LbGR_blmZTow,4,1,4,Zwd1y6kS6DYb40BCr_x2tQ

The service is awful though. The cashier didn't smile and felt bothered to take our order.",ygkpsZ-JKp8p8hiX4PWx0w,1,0,3,URJzzAU98UQsSjuXrh9c1g
3441717,2014-06-19,1,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,They were out of shrimp. They did not have any Malt Vinegar and they threw my order in an A & W bag. So I guess they were out of the boxes also.  Service was slow. Food was. Ok,JWBxCiDHnc_8lWtD2PBm6g,0,0,1,MU6qIu-ODEMRl9Q3dRH1FA
3529380,2015-05-01,0,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,"So sad that this place has gone down hill. This is the only LJS close to me, and I used to love to duck in for a treat of fish and those crispy little batter pieces they always toss in.

Sadly, this is the last time. The fish was extremely soft and greasy, which usually happens if the fryer is not hot enough. the chicken planks were also greasy, and had an odd taste. On top of that. out of green beans and malt vinegar, and absolutely no batter pieces in the box. Very disappointed.",Clj5WdwsjRRBvN5byPvdlA,1,0,2,xCBravDLl9EeVYWRy2399w

The customer service was awful. Only second to their tasteless food. I am curious to know if they closed voluntarily. Good riddance.",Q7Pkf7GtXtplV41c8xwPxQ,0,0,1,jqALIT8o2sqWMsfVw7-JYg
4396441,2015-02-28,0,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,"The fish was okay, but not worth ordering again. The breaded shrimp was not deveined which made it look disgusting, and were still completely raw. Service took forever, and it wasn't even busy. This place is pure and utter garbage. I'm sure a homeless man dumpster diving would eat better food.",WQGiKbfq2NFbc8jXCOnUng,0,0,1,MLaKaRdmNrpRlcMdJE5N7g
5651017,2014-04-19,0,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,"Yesterday (4/18) was the first day that I've ever had Long John Silver's.. And it'll be the last. Sure, the food was good. Sure, it was fresh. However, it was way too oily for my liking. After one bite of my hush puppy, my lips were glossed with oil. Ech.. I don't know about you, but I would much rather eat food that won't make me feel overly guilty.

As for service, they took awhile to get my food, and I understand that since it's made to order. They were nice and all, but there were only about three people (from what I can see) working in here. 

I don't know if I'll ever give LJS another try.. But I will be coming back for their A&W side of the restaurant!",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,0,0,2,Ewiu0SHj1cx0n7n2hwZGtA
5986078,2018-02-25,0,zCuFlGmDGFyj3ytMfmnXEw,Long John Silver's that's false advertising when they advertise that they have fries with their fish I have yet to go to a Long John Silver's that has fries false advertising and even the KFC store locations don't have fries. Don't advertise fish and chips if you have no (chips) meaning fries.,tz_kCaMtJ1M0KPhLFdqr3Q,0,0,2,f68IkY9-7AHvq7psR0qUAw
