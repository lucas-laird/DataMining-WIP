253752,2009-05-11,0,Xww2E2ym5cWX3-91Ml5Bfw,"Scenario:  Leaving the Venetian to go home after our booze-filled rampage, the driver wants chilaquiles.  I go to trusty yelp mobile, and decide on Blueberry Hill.  Halfway there after heavy traffic on the strip, it is said that that place stinks.  OK, Plan B.  We make it 2 blocks on Plan B until we decide to stop at La Cantina and cross our fingers that it has chilaquiles.  

The casino smelt like our weekend, but once we hit the restaurant, it smelt wonderful.  They ended up having chilaquiles, and once seated we received 2 different salsas and a bean dip for each side of the table.  Granted we only had a party of 4, so there was no reaching over the table.  The beans were like a bean dip, it was intoxicating and warm.  We  each got the chilaquiles, mine with the green sauce.  The plates arrived after the salsa got old, and it was pretty darn good.  The chips were chewy like I remembered, and it put me in an immediate food coma.  

The food was really cheap, but service could have been bumped up a notch.  We never got the sopes we ordered to start with, but it was probably a good thing, as our breakfasts were larger than we imagined.  I would definitely come again, perfect hangover food!",76e33hvkYwuO9nhr94dstw,0,1,3,b5zgrjEYHidzSAmd3EyeUQ

On my first visit I had chicken and beef enchiladas. Very impressed with the amount of meat served. Flavor was good, although it could have used some more sauce. Definitely would get them again, and if that was my only visit I would have given this place at least 4 stars. The second visit was during their half price happy hour. I got the chicken quesadillas, which I did not care for at all. They could have been crispier and I did not like their taste, which is why I am giving the Cantina 3 stars total.

The chips were okay, the bean dip was great and the salsa was just alright. We also ordered the table-side guacamole...not sure why they do it table-side...the guy who made it didn't even converse with us or show us what he was doing or even ask how spicy we wanted it, etc. The guac was mediocre. 

Service was fast and friendly. 

You could see the people cooking in the kitchen.

Our kids had a meltdown and waitstaff worked quickly to get us out of there (thanks!). 

Moving on...I had the flaming combo fajitas and they were so tasty. I often stray away from steak fajitas because I get the really gristly pieces every.single.time...but not this time. The beef, chicken and large prawns were perfect. The only thing that could have made the fajitas better would have been homemade corn tortillas. My order came with yummy rice and refried beans and large dollops of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. 

With the meltdown, we decided to get dessert to go. I love flan and their flan would have been SO good if it didn't come out overcooked. There was a thick layer on the top (or the bottom once it has been removed from its mold) and the bottom (now the top) was overcooked, black and burnt tasting. Don't get me wrong, I love a little burnt caramel flavor...but this was a bit overwhelming.

I've stayed at this hotel before and shyed away from here because when I walked up the decor just says run away. The decor is like a Denny's trying to be Mexican. Not sure if the problem is the cheap plastic plants or the lighting....but don't let it keep you from the food here. I had the Flaming Fajita plate which comes with shrimp, steak, and chicken. Also had a Cadillac Margarita. Both were great! I actually was sitting there eating and drinking and talking to myself about how surprisingly good this is.

With all the Spanish speaking going on in the restaurant, I got excited. I thought, ""this food is going to be ridiculous"". Here was my 1st mistake, making assumptions and having expectations.

My chips and salsa arrived with warm beans. Mmm a tasty addition to compliment my margarita. I got the house 'rita and remembered...again...why I hate margarita's. I always think they are going to be different and they always suck. Too much sweet and sour, not enough lime, not enough liquor. Like a bad grownup lemonade.
The salsa that came with the chips was also too sweet for my taste.

I ordered the relleno dinner which comes with beans and rice. The beans were covered in cheese, so if you like that, these platters are for you. The relleno was perfect and I was very happy. The rice...meh...I took the salsa that I didn't like and poured it over the rice to see if the mix altered either taste any. 

Fajitas were being delivered all around me; this seems to be their specialty and when I was there, they were offering a free margarita with any order of fajitas...good deal if you like margarita's. I had forgotten that I don't. I would certainly try the fajitas the next time I am here.

He did, it was, and boy did I like it.  Extra red cili seasonings gave a zip to the dish.  The beans were also well spiced and had some wonderful cotija cheese for garnish.

The complimentary starter is the chips and salsa (good). My husband asks for a side of bean dip. The best dish is the Seafood Burrito, served with rice and beans (onion stem is garnish).  Since Cozymel's changed their menu, we had to find a worthy substitute. The tasty burrito generously complimented with flavorful sauce, really has seafood (not just shrimp, like Toto's), and it is huge. I only eat half of it. It's the only thing that both of us orders, though one of our friends had the chicken dish, but it didn't look as good as our burritos. Reasonable prices, but even better when you have a coupon.

The atmosphere is really tropical looking/feeling with fake palm trees, despite being located in The Tuscany Hotel/Casino. The staff wears uniforms (men wear the cubano similar shirts, and the ladies wear the brightly colored frilly tops with skirts), adding to the Mexican feel. There is booth as well as table seating.

So I ordered Shrimp cocktail.  Oh, eM, Gee!!! They packed a lot of shrimp into that margarita bowl/cup thingy. Big, fat, juicy shrimp swimming in a bowl of the best tasting cocktail sauce ever- chunky onions, tomatoes and the creamiest avocados EVER. I usually add lime and hot sauce to any shrimp cocktail that I've ordered but not this one. Just one taste and I was hooked. I forgot about the lime and hot sauce until I slurped the last bit of the great stuff. There were also about three ginormous shrimp hanging from the rim of the bowl. Nope those didn't escape my voracious appetite either. 

My sister had the Pozole. It was so good. There was more than enough meat, so much that she was kind of complaining there was not enough of the hominy. 

Next on the list is the Menudo which my sister in law ordered.  This may have been one of the best I've had in a long time. Right up there with my friend's mom's homemade menudo and that is saying a lot. The tripe was well cooked, tender but not mushy and there was no questionable smell to it. 

I ordered the Taquitos rancheros for my mom and she enjoyed them too. Crispy rolled beef taquitos that came in a platter with guacamole, sour cream and salsa with shredded lettuce and sprinkling of cheese. 

The Carne asada burrito was what my brother ordered. It had a good flavor. Personally I usually don't order carne asada unless I'm at KT, but that's just me. 

My son wanted the Seafood burrito, it was ok. They used a lot of imitation crab meat, I was expecting some shrimp in there but I didn't see any. This was the least of our favorites. 

Did I forget to mention that it's free refills on the chips and dips and drinks?  The bean dip was such a hit. I told my brother to go easy on them to which he shrugged off. He had to pay the following morning with his uric acid. 

The girls working there were pretty nice and kept the chips, dips and drinks flowing. 

Restrooms are out on the casino floor. 

We're definitely coming back when we're this way next time.",ctWAuzS04Xu0lke2Rop4lQ,16,16,4,H11dj1Lc0v5q_FDc3kHxkA
5610918,2015-12-02,2,Xww2E2ym5cWX3-91Ml5Bfw,I would have never thought this place would have such great food! It's in the middle of a casino off strip and we were tired and hungry by the time we arrived. The prices were cheap for Vegas! (3 item combo $13) beers were $3 domestic and $4 for imports. The chips are served with beans and salsa both of which were very good. The chips themselves were great as well. The chile Rellano was amazing and I will definitely return the next time we stay at Tuscany.,v4fT6mIxgjho_CLR2wiXvg,4,4,4,J9qx9tqh0sAutQRnICUAaA

Waiter took our order which included the request of NO re-fried beans, extra rice. Meals showed up with big helpings of re-fried beans and rice. Waiter dropped off the plates and didn't hang around long enough to ask if everything was OK. Never came back to check on us and never asked to refill our beverages. The food was good though.",KTsaDeM4HY7D-cser0kDnw,0,0,3,SCT9n2UivLCHgXmUlIznNA

We tried the table side guacamole and it was 3 ingredients: avocados, tomatoes and lime juice. No kick at all!
Very disappointed in this place and won't be back.",7r18chAynSMVh3wH018FOg,0,0,1,BqjdCQGyjfECcXRfAbY2mQ

I hadnt eaten here for about a year because I had moved a significant ways away. I sure had missed the food! The atmosphere and establishment inside the Tuscany Hotel, is very relaxing and casual. Roll in, in your sweat pants and flip flops for a tasty authentic mexican dish. Love the fresh tableside guacamole!!!!",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,1,1,5,d4_DryRtjN735OKK8oPT3g
5758421,2015-09-12,0,Xww2E2ym5cWX3-91Ml5Bfw,"Not impressed at all. The look of the restaurant is not too bad.  Was fairly clean, but just disorganized. Seemed like the young crew was working...the crew that doesn't really care. Our waiter seemed distracted. Had to ask for silverware. There was a gal back in the kitchen who had ear buds in her ears listening to music as evidenced by her singing and dancing. Just a little unprofessional. There was a party going on and it seemed like one of the people in the party probably works at the restaurant since she seemed to be very friendly with the staff. It got pretty annoying when the party got loud and they started smearing birthday cake in each other's faces. It got really ridiculous when one of the waiters got involved and had cake smeared on his face. The party had little kids running all over the place with the mom screaming at them from where she sat. I cringed for the couple who was sitting nearby as balloons were popping in their faces and they obviously we're looking for someone to move them and no one came over. It was just an awkward situation. Be nice if a party like that could have been put In a private room so others could enjoy their time. As for the food, it was definitely mediocre to poor. The cheese they used in the quesadilla tasted pretty cheap. The carne in the burrito didn't taste fresh. Overall, very disappointing. Won't be back, won't recommend.",tZ2uhMD_ln8ah_-wO_r5Xw,0,0,2,NQfxXHBfvCOuV5cFPH5TOQ

Of course we had to try every restaurant here as well. 

Over the years this was one of our favorite Mexican restaurants and have come in just to eat here.

When you are seated to start they bring you salsa and bean dip with chips, these both have to be the best in town, and they never mind refilling them for you and believe me you can make a meal just out of these! 

I always love the Chicken fajitas. They are so good here.Just the taste and flavor are better than other places we have tried.  My husband gets the beef burritos. He loves how big they are and always gets extra sauce on his. 
When our Son has been with us he orders the fish tacos they are really good .

Service has always been pretty good. Always seated right away and food is consistent.
We did have a favorite waiter who was always on top of everything but he went to another casino further away. The margaritas are good too.

Worth checking out if your looking for not only a good Mexican restaurant and not bad on prices but you get your moneys worth.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,10,10,4,AKWwuYfSdBK5jFTUOZuf1w

They have surprisingly good Mexican food....yummy chips, great bean dip and my favorite, the chimichanga! YUM! They also have a good lunch menu with decent pricing on the menu items. Plus they serve a delish strawberry margartia, that's the way to my heart I tell ya!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the smoke from casino *sometimes* wafts in and is kinda yucky.",Z6sMdVaYrFoAOL-Kbc7b3Q,2,1,4,ev4LIYHmY0OV-vaBDiKmEA

Got the $6 guacamole which sounds crazy, but it is made FRESH at your table side and tastes soooo amazing. It is worth the $6 because it is a large portion so you can put it on any entree you order. 
I got the chile relleno and it was wonderful. 
The main event was the salmon asado! It had an amazing purée sauce of deliciousness.

Amazing food, fast (and RIDICULOUSLY accommodating) service, and a pleasant atmosphere. What more could you ask for? It just goes to show you can't please all of the people all of the time. I had two of the aforementioned mojitos... they are fine. I also had the aforementioned fajitas... they are also fine. But if you want a REAL treat, Garlic Shrimp all the way.",1BoBinKYsfkkvqoqNK9QnQ,3,0,5,Lzn3bBumSyWjCYO-60JHTA
