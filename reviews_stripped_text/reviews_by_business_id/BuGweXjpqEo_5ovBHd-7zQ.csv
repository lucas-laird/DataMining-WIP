I get a small chili that is so runny that it's like broth and to top that off I was given no crackers. If you don't have enough chili and your giving someone the bottom of the pot then at least give crackers. :(",78i6xRFI7235Q7d-kE3tIw,2,0,1,Hdq9enfHV6d3g4EPSvPLPA

But first....  I'm not so much a fan of Wendy's burgers.  Flavor wise, they just don't do it for me.  I am, however, a fan of their chicken nuggets.  And I appreciate the variety on their dollar menu.  My recent discovery, the Cheesy Cheddar Burger is decent.  Not great, but certainly decent, and doable when you need a quick bite.

The place also gets points for having a nice staff.  I've had good experiences with the staff through every transaction here, and they are helpful and friendly.  I don't ask for a lot, but they do a fine job.

So what is this ""point""?  I don't eat fast food vegetables.  Period.  And I was reminded this when I tried their value menu Chicken Caesar Wrap.  I guess you could point out a ""Well, what do you expect for a dollar"" comment, but I DON'T expect brown, wilty lettuce.  So I turned my meal into a chicken wrap, minus the caesar.  

Heh.  I guess you could say that I came to bury caesar, not to praise him.  Come on.  Groan all you want, but I had a great opportunity to add that.  How could I not?

Well, Wendy's, we'll always have chicken nuggets....",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,0,0,3,GhmZMRm8Yz-McOYbCHiybw
