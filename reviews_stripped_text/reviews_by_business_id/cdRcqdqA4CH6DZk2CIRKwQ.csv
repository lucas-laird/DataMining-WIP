The mixed berry was topped with plenty of fruits though. The inside of the crepe had jam though (not my thing) and nutella (definitely my thing), but I thought it was overall ok.

Appearance: The place looked promising as people were in line for the food, and it looked cool since you can see the people make the crepes behind the cashier as you were ordering. I really like the French decor, but I mean, all the stores looked like that in the hotel! 

Food: I was extremely hungry and I always enjoyed crepes! I was excited to try savory crepes since I've only tried sweet. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast crepe and I ordered the spinach and artichoke crepe. At first, I was disappointed at my dish since it didn't look too much of a star...it had a few cherry tomatoes on top and that's it. I was only a little impressed by my boyfriend's since he did have a nice creamy gravy on top of his...but the big disappointment was that it had a sliver of an avocado. If you're paying for a $10 dish, I am expecting a hearty slice of an avocado!! My dish was not that impressive; It did taste good, but I could really just taste the cheese and the crepe. I could hardly taste the spinach and artichoke. Again, I was really expecting big slices where you can actually taste the ingredients that are mentioned. I took about 5 bites of my boyfriend's breakfast crepe and the egg was very fluffy, seasoned well, and overall delicious. Again though, you can barely taste the meat. It was hidden around in the crepe but you don't get much of it. It was just mostly egg. Although the food was just okay, I was surprised that I was pretty full so at least I paid for something that was done right. 

Overall, the food did not taste bad at all. Was it worth my money? It depends. If you don't expect to get a lot of avocado and ham in your breakfast crepe or artichokes and spinach in your spinach and artichoke crepe, then yes, it will be worth. If you were like me, then no.

The first day of our trip we just walked by to look at the menu and to see if they had soup because that's what I was craving. When I asked the lady at the cashier, she wasnt listening and yelled ""WHAT DO YOU WANT"".  Uh hello, who let you work the register you rude piece o sh**. If you hate your job cool, but don't take out on other people.

Today we came for breakfast because we wanted a quick meal that was close by. I ordered a combo with egg, sausage, French toast, ""hash browns"" and a naked juice.

1) all the cooks, women, look confused as hell. 
1.5) they gave us a buzzer to let us know when our order was ready, yet they still shout at us to tell us our food is ready.
2) our food came, but out of order. 
3) they don't give you your drink till you get the food. 
4) I changed my mind and asked for a lemonade which is $1.50 cheaper, didn't even offer me a refund but just let me know I paid more.  he said let me know what else he could get for me... my $1.50 would be nice.
5) THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. The hash brown patty was cold and not cooked thoroughly. I didn't bother with the French toast it looked undercooked.  Seriously a frozen meal that they threw on the grill for 1.5 seconds

Then I dared to want a bagel and cream cheese with a side of egg. Since they don't have a thing exactly like that I ordered the egg&cheese bagel, without the bacon and with cream cheese instead. 
The lady confirmed this order, I mean they have both eggs and cream cheese so it shouldn't be a problem. 

But when I got my food, there was no cream cheese. Mind you, the bagel was also stale and the egg tasteless. 

Ok so no cream cheese, could be an honest mistake. I went to ask for some cream cheese, but at this the manager got really angry at me! 
Eventually he agreed to sell me a tiny pack of cream cheese for $1.08. I told him that if they asked me in the first place I would have added no problem but now I've already paid and did not get what I paid for!

When deciding on what I wanted to eat at the Shops in the Venetian, it was quite a quandary. There were so many options to consider. I tried the Japanese place the night before and was disappointed in the food and service. So, I decided to try something else.

Cafe Pan seemed to have the nicest set up. Although the menu was wrong on one point (they don't have gyro), the food and service were terrific. I was greeted with a smile by the cashier and she helped me decide on what I wanted to get. She also offered many options to make my meal customized for me!

The wait wasn't too bad, but when my food arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the hefty portions. I ordered a beef shawarma with a side of fries. It was delicious. The beef was well seasoned and meshed well with the cucumber yogurt sauce and hummus. The fries were also cooked to perfection.

I was so satisfied by the food and service, I decided to get some coffee to go. One of the workers was on it! She brewed for me a delicious cup of coffee that could have cost me $5 at one of the cafes in the mall. It was half the cost and made with the same Illy brand of coffee at the fancier cafes. It was well made! There was no need for creamer or sugar.

Overall, a great experience for half the cost I would have had to pay at an expensive restaurant. Definitely returning when I am on a budget in Vegas.",BO2-1YzeUAYZc59Wi9Zh0A,0,0,5,R2mzPKGlZqO-tANqJ-W-HA

Mixed berry crepe - too much of the strawberry jam filling which made the crispy crepe skin soggy, while there wasn't as much fresh fruit inside and on top. Arrangement is a bit slapped together for a $12 dessert crepe.

Chicken pesto crepe - pretty tasty! There's plenty of chicken and the pesto went really well with the crepe skin. Definitely worth ordering again as the chicken breast was very moist.

Service is like a fast food place. The cashier seemed a bit confused with my question, and right after ordering, she started speaking to another cashier in a different language while still helping us, even though both of them spoke English.

First of all, I don't really eat chicken. So why would I order chicken shawarma? She clearly heard me wrong and mistaken my order. This lady was laughing when she was arguing with me too. RUDE AF! You deserve to be put on blast on yelp for your shitty ass customer service. Also get your ears checked out, because apparently this place makes a lot of wrong orders.

What got me really mad was that they didn't want to fix my order. She kept insisting I got chicken and didn't change my order. She literally walked off when I asked them to change it. What kind of customer service is this? I had to tell a different lady about it and then she swapped out the chicken for beef. The beef was burnt, the salad was wrinkled, and the hummus was sour (an indication of old food). My meal wasn't even edible at this point. I should of got my money back.

I love omelets and Cafe Pan boasts an omelet station with a decent selection of fillings.

The fillings include your typical ham, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, onions, and some weird options such as pineapple. I opted for a tomato, ham, spinach, and onion.
