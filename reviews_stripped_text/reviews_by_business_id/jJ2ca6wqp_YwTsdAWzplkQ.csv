The restaurant is clean, modern and has a nice vibe. The staff is friendly and informative.

I wanted to keep it simple so I went with the tuna bowl with vegetables and I have to say it was really good. The tuna tasted fresh and I was happy to learn that it was prepared daily and in house.

They have a large selection of traditional Japanese toppings which I didn't expect (I later found out that 'Ted' is Japanese so now it makes sense). I think this combination of the traditional Japanese and Americanized options will keep a wide range of customers happy and coming back.

So much for the 10% discount for checking in on Yelp... I called them to inquire about the error and the staff who rang up my check couldn't remember helping earlier. Asked if I could get a refund or credit and was told to go back to the store for a refund. I wasn't going to drive all the way back for a mistake they made. Eventually was told to ask for the same person on my next visit and they'll give me a free item.

It's not too pungent, it's just perfect.

1448038,2016-10-23,6,jJ2ca6wqp_YwTsdAWzplkQ,"Sushi is a traditional Japanese food combining seasoned rice with fish, vegetables, or egg. Sushi burritos are an oversized, modern take on the cuisine. Oddly, Ted's is the only place I've yet found that manages to give sushi burritos a clean, traditional flavor.

The menu suggests a handful of prepared combos with recommended toppings and sauces- the Sashimi Oishi, Tuna Tuna, and Ted's California, listed in order of preference, have been pretty good. I like that they have more traditional toppings available, including two different types of radishes and (my personal favorite!) carrot. The sauces are lighter here than elsewhere, and though some complain of a bland flavor, the profile at Ted's is distinctly different from the overly-sauced mayo-based stuff found at other local chains- and I like it that way.

Staff are friendly and fun, and there are sides to pair with your 'rrito  from traditional (miso soup, seaweed salad, edamame, udon) to fun (imported ramen chips, Hawaiian onion chips, mochi). Note that they are closed on Sundays, so plan date night ahead of time.

I did not expect the inside to be modern and set up nicely since it was a new sushi burrito joint that I never heard of. Also the wall in the dining area was decorated with neat drawing instructions on how to order and above the workers station/cashier was a nice 3 screen menu. As you can tell the owner had this nicely planned out and put a lot of money into this business. The male worker recommended the most popular ones, (we ordered the #1 which is the sashimi oishi priced at $10.95) he was very polite and was open to any questions. 
My girlfriend got hers as the bowl and I got mine as a burrito. So just to break it down the burrito

Size: Decently sized burrito compared to others

Taste: delicious, sashimi was fresh and the rice was not to sticky or dry. 

Price: $10.95 which isn't bad since that's what everyone in town pretty much charges

As for the bowl it was a generous size, although they made a mistake and gave my girlfriend a very vinegary rice, which they brought up to her as they found out themselves they made a vinegary rice batch. They offered to redo her bowl for her which was nice. 

The only thing I don't really like about this place is that they need a fountain drink machine, it bugs me when restaurants have only canned soda options. Also they might need some type of Japanese sweet desserts or pastries to finish off after a meal.

2192774,2016-12-10,4,jJ2ca6wqp_YwTsdAWzplkQ,"So on the never ending poke bowl tour. It is just about ridiculous every month see or hear of another poke/burrito restaurant opened in Vegas. Sucker for poke and figure never have enough options in life or poke action. 

Ted's Sushi Burrito works basically like every other poke bowl or burrito option. You start with the base either white or brown rice. Furikake as option on top of the rice. One of the first places went never had that but know that automatic every poke bowl place been to. They do ask first just in case not fan of it. I would highly recommend it! The protein on top get your choice of few options and amount. The toppings is the thing that usually stands out from one spot to another. The more places check out it becoming very similar edamame, mixed greens, raw vegetables (usually carrots, cucumbers, or couple other ones), and seaweed salad. Just some of the ones I notice or remember. The sauces that one thing YOU can count on being different. I find it sometimes much with so many options. I am more traditional poke guy either spicy with mayo base or shoyu base sauce. If the poke is fresh. The whole point poke bowl the fish should stand out by itself. They do have some set bowls that can choose from also on the menu.

I decided make my own bowl. I got two protein spicy salmon and spicy tuna. I think the spicy salmon was on the special board. They do have special board as soon as you walk in. It decent size chalkboard so make sure check it out before order. The spicy salmon not that much fan. It tasted bland, salmon not taste that fresh, and not spicy or tiny kick in it. The spicy tuna was complete opposite. I like everything about it. The tuna tasted fresh, nice little kick, and solid spicy tuna. The toppings went with edamame, greens, carrots, and seaweed salad. All the topping were fresh and filled out the bowl perfect. The portion size is good size and like most poke bowl reasonable price. 

One thing that earned star all by itself! I notice they had place of individual wrap spam musubi. Love spam musubi!!! Outside of local restaurant not many places that sell random spam musubi. None of the other poke bowl spot I have been to so far sell them. It was good. The perfect compliment for any food. I know local in me. 

The interior enjoy. On one side has this whole artwork with the concept of poke bowl or sushi burrito. Lot of space sit down. The staff is super friendly, positive, and while there had great conversation with one of the workers. Just talking food and life. Chill atmosphere dine in.

The staff was very friendly and informative.  They helped us construct the right burritos for our tastes.

We took our food to go and once I was a few bites in, I could not stop raving about how good it was!  I ordered the number 3 and it was just bursting with flavor!

Putting the seaweed salad made for a different experience. It was an overwhelming addition that I couldn't taste the eel at all. It was as if I should've never had the eel or never added the seaweed. The burrito was still good though. I really liked it.

Hailing from Boston and being REALLY picky about my fish, I've been super hesitant to eat seafood in here Vegas, as the majority is frozen (ewwww), and the locals opinions as to what's good is rather....subjective...lol (I've been here two years, and STILL barely eat any...*sigh*) 

 After looking dubiously at the setup (nothing wrong with it, just not what I had envisioned) and asking some questions, I still asked to taste a few things, which they were happy to let me do. 

I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised...it was all very fresh, and not at ALL fishy! They even told me up front about some items that are frozen, so I didn't order anything I might be disappointed with.  I wound up getting a custom made soy wrap with spicy tuna and spicy salmon, cucumber, radish, pickled ginger, a bit of cilantro, red roe, tempura crunch, sesame oil and wasabi mayo. Damn that was tasty!  

Prices are very reasonable anyway, but If you check in on Yelp, you'll get a first time ten percent discount (yay for discounts!) They also do a frequent buyer program through FiveStars, and you can get free food with your points (super yay for free food!!)  You can have delivery done by any of the major food delivery services as well. 

I'm hoping they'll expand that menu a bit more, and also that though tamago IS a protein, that the add-on cost won't continue to be as much as it is for extra fish.  These are the reasons I didn't give five stars, but if I could have done 4.5, I would have. 
Regardless, I'll be making return trips here for sure, and I'm glad to have found it.  :-)",xq0Zx_HDVPDqyOF5FP971w,1,0,4,67ugvdC6RNdXUSC5QClYVg

So I ended up ordering another scoop of crab meat salad for extra 65 cents. (I know most other sushi bowl places give 2-3 scoops of protein per order...) other than that, it was ok. And they charged me 65cents for seaweed salad topping. Their yuzu ponzu sauce is decent. So overall, taste is decent. But I just wish they'd give a little more protein when they are charging me almost $10 for this bowl...",g2uNtyAV9cX4ZyDJ3ygQcw,0,0,3,_0mnVMMa9eGYlkrF8nJeYw

Haha I was excited to try this place because of the great reviews. The service was great. The staff was nice and informative however, the sushi burrito itself wasn't. I had soft shell crab & raw salmon in my burrito and they both tasted very fishy which turned me off immediately. I also couldn't taste any of the sauces I had put on my burrito. I even asked for extra sauce but the fishy taste overpowered it. The burrito was also breaking apart on me while I was eating it.

We stumbled upon this place by accident and I'm glad I did. I'm a total newbie so after staring at the menu struggling with my choice, I found asking the staff what are the favs the best way to go. I got the #1 with seaweed wrap and the # 8 with soy wrap. If you seek the sushi experience go with the seaweed. The size of the burrito was nice too.

I enjoyed the flavors a lot. I really liked the boat they provide to customize my wasabi and soy sauce dip. Also the little ginger packet was a nice touch. The water station is a blessing. 

The rewards program they offer is good too. I don't see myself spending this much on weeknight dinners a lot so any little bit helps. I'd go back, the rewards help out. 

Try it. = )",uv9VIYijUSjQHgVvC5wj4w,0,0,5,OL9A76T5-EG0S5o5CWv7sA

5928796,2016-10-31,1,jJ2ca6wqp_YwTsdAWzplkQ,"I've been seeing all these sushi burrito places popping up around town, but never had any interest in trying it out, until recently. One night the husband and I were eating dinner at Zen Curry Express next door. I love that place, but was unhappy that they were out of brown rice that night. As we were leaving, we saw Ted's Sushi Burrito next door and browsed their menu outside. We looked at each other and said ""We should have just ate here!"" 

So we came back the next night to try this place out. Sushi burritos are basically bigger sushi rice rolls packed with protein and veggies, which sort of look like burritos. The employees here were friendly and made good recommendations after finding out that it was our first time here. You can either create your own burrito, bowl or bento box, or you can choose one of Ted's Favorites, which are also customizable and great for me since I don't like things like onions and radish. I got the #8 - Ted's California as a burrito. Had all of their suggested toppings, except for the radish and added Yum Yum sauce as suggested by one of the employees. I know California rolls are everywhere, but this sushi burrito was very tasty and filling. I think the sauces made the whole thing delicious as well! My husband tried the #1 Sashimi Oishi and the #4 Chicken Karaage and enjoyed both. Okay, so it's not as awesome as getting sushi at an authentic Japanese restaurant, but this is a great alternative when you can't spend so much for great sushi all the time. The ingredients are fresh and they don't make the food until you order it. 

Will definitely be returning in the future. One of the things I really miss from back home in Hawaii is take out sushi places. This is a great option for dinner or for taking lunch to work. They also have a reward program through the FiveStars app - punch in your phone # as you are paying, and you get one point for every dollar spent here. You can later redeem your points for stuff like free seaweed salad, can of soda and 20% off your order. Give this place a try, they are the same owners as Zen Curry!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,3,5,f3QcxutYJBb6yr4D6YT46A
5996338,2017-06-13,0,jJ2ca6wqp_YwTsdAWzplkQ,"I came here today to see if this place would be better than any other sushi burrito places around town. When I first entered I was greeted by the workers and asked if it was my first time. I told the guy who was helping me it was my first time. I think his name was Steve. 

He explained their menu to me very well and told me that the burritos wee the most popular. He gave me recommendations which I did consider and went with a few things he recommended. 

I did go for a burrito instead of a bowl or Bento box. I chose soy paper and choose salmon and ahi tuna as my protein. He suggested to go with a wasabi poke sauce and garlic ponzu. I also went with his suggestion on the veggies of cucumbers, green onions, cilantro, and added sweet egg (tamago). I didn't see other options such as crunchy wonton chips so decided on just those to fill the burrito. 

My total came out to $10 and I tipped him for all of his suggestions. The burrito was not anything special and a bit on the higher price point for me since I'm used to going to other places and getting way more options to choose from to add into my burrito or other options of burrito choices. The cucumber was cut thicker than I like so it felt like I was biting into a big piece of carrot every time I took a bite of the burrito. I couldn't taste the wasabi ponzu that much so it wasn't spicy for me and I added soysauce to it while I ate it. 

Overall, the burrito was okay , but maybe in the future I'll come back to try one of their bowls or Bento boxes",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,3,jwy8jh1ngf4bwMrDxRTGeA
