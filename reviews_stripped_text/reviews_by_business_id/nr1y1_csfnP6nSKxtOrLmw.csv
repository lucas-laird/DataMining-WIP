The customer service is good  also.  They always offer us a drink while we wait. Keep up the good work Churh 's.,i4p1va1miwk5z4lGi6pYKw,0,0,5,WBGuPPC3Q0Cao_Y1hOc5Ww

Went through the drive through and ordered their special. Person i bought it for said the chicken wasnt cooked. Called Churches and spoke to the manager. SHE SAID SHE COULDNT DO ANYTHING FOR ME WITHOUT THE RECEIPT. It was in the package with the inedible chicken. I was wondering why it took so long so he served chicken that wasnt done. Unacceptable! !! You think im trying to get free chicken? No more of my business anymore. 
I spent a lot of money here in the past but im sure there are other establishments that will take my money and offer better service. 
Churches, check your manager at the West Charleston store.

After being ignored for nearly five minutes as the ""crew"" fooled around in the back of the restaurant, two people walked up and completely ignored us.  They would not even make eye contact with us.  After a few more minutes of waiting for someone to acknowledge us, we walked out.

Fabulous customer service Church's!!!!!!!",nOcbGJYNNXkCT4C7X855Jg,0,0,1,aOKMNTGNTl-x-osw0HvwEA

Then she went on and called me a ""Bitch"" she probably didn't realize she was on the speaker.

The chicken was great nice fresh hot and juicy! Everything was great except my jalapeño bombers  and chicken sandwich which was a bummer! The jalapeño bombers taste like it's been sitting out the cheese inside was dried out... Biting in to it the cheese didn't burst out like it usually do when it's fresh it was just hard.

The chicken sandwich was boo boo nothing exciting... It used to taste better back in the days when it was just a regular bun, mayo, pickles and a piece of chicken tender. Now they make it with a fake frozen chicken patty. 

The inside is dirty and sloppy. Caps and straw wraps all on the counter. No one wiped the tables, I don't think I ever dined anywhere where you would need a key to use the restroom. It just feels unsanitary when you come inside.",N3bpA04dSyzH-13kxOdf8A,0,0,3,yirhhytsCFFr390R8QNY-g
1743555,2015-09-25,0,nr1y1_csfnP6nSKxtOrLmw,Oh boy.. OK here we go.. I wasn't gonna write this one but ya know sometimes places just piss me off!. I use to go to churches chicken many time a couple of years back but since it was so far away from my work I stopped going cause ya know.. Lunch time is short.  This day I was talking to a guy at work and he was saying how good KFC was. I said nope my fav is Church's. So that day I looked them up online and low and behold they opened this place a couple of miles away from work. So I went there for lunch.  I walked in and there were 4 people in there. I stepped up and placed my order. Total bill  $8.72. Reached into my wallet and had 9 bucks on me. I thought cool don't have to pull out the credit card. They handed me my .28 cents change and I sat  down to wait for my food. A couple of minutes later The lady informed me they were out of the spicy chicken and it would take about 6 minutes to make it. I said that was fine I would wait. Well the 6 minutes turned into 12... 13.... 14...minutes. Finally called me up.  She asked if I wanted ketchup. I said no but needed some hot sauce and a cup of ranch to dip my okra in. She threw a handful of hot sauce in the bag and informed me that the ranch was 39 cents. I looked at her and said I have never been charged for ranch before. She insisted she would not give me a cup. (remember my change was 28 cents.)So to this place and any other business that is listening. I hope that 39 cents you get for your ranch  is worth it.  I love your chicken but because of this extra charge you can keep you ranch and you chicken and anything else you want because this is one guy that will not return to you place of business. You hand me more hot sauce and ketchup  than I will ever use but not one cup of ranch?  Wow. OK sorry.. you asked for it. one star and another lost customer. Looking at your ratings I am not the first and wont be the last.,K2UWcEFehZjjSCnE_06dJg,0,0,1,6UlB8cFC14yxWZnibRqSYA

Okay, this was my first time trying Churches Chicken so I will start with the positive.

Pro: Holy wow, their biscuits are delicious! I was not expecting some of the flavors that came off of the biscuits, it was actually sweet- like they had a honey butter drizzle on them. 

Con: The chicken tenders were sort of rubbery, and a bit too salty for my taste.

Pro: The fries were good, fresh, and crispy in a good way.

If I ever come, here again, it will more than likely be for the fries and the biscuits, or maybe I just need to give some of their other chicken meals a try- well see...",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,1,1,3,wuCKzXOfYrGuGKv6O6Nwkw

3886767,2017-05-02,0,nr1y1_csfnP6nSKxtOrLmw,Went into this location 5 days ago and ordered 28.00 family meal and  gave the cashier 40.00 got change and waited 10 minutes for her tell me that they are out of regular chicken. They only have spicy. I asked how long before next batch of regular chicken is done. She replied there was more at 745 on a Friday?????? So my hubby starts growling for refund. To get rid of us  she gave me a full 40.00 refund.... so yes i made money on the trip thats worth the star. Other than  that will opt for other location to eat,KVG9Sx0OZu-8FKaS6w3ybA,0,0,1,Su2zrAvDQuZN5XcAorsRJw
3923487,2013-08-18,3,nr1y1_csfnP6nSKxtOrLmw,"The deals here are impressive, that is for sure. Very cheap. 

The chicken is tasty. And so are the biscuits, which no healthy human should be consuming, but what the hell -- one has to splurge sometimes, I suppose. 

And this area does not offer much for fast food options with chicken as the primary focus (Cane's nearby, Farm Basket far away, and BFG/Strip N Dip even farther away), or anything really at Church's price-point. 

Stuff like a shrimp basket with french fries for 3.59$, the so-called ""Big Tex"" for 2.49$, and biscuits for 50¢ ea.; manager's special of five chicken strips and two biscuits for 5$; et al.

So, why the two stars, E? 

I do not know: I have experienced better. It is a really dirty restaurant. 

I have seen ""animals"" that should be ""restricted"" scurrying about. I have also been to New York City, so it does not make it prohibitive or forbidden to me, but for fuck's sake ....

On the latest SNHD inspection (http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php), they are rocking the infamous Violation 16, which is exactly what my star deductions are based on ... for those unfamiliar (""pest control""). 

SNHD still inexplicably permits them, as well as other eateries, to maintain an ""A"" grade even with the suspect V-16. 

Something to keep in mind for those that believe the giant black ""A"" on the piece of white paper comes with a level of certainty that fuckery like this will not be afoot. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,6,1,2,yQKlAF_YMTG4TxQndxuaZA

I've come in here twice and both times it took a century for them to even notice that I was standing there. They would look at me and just walk past me and continue what they were doing. They wouldn't even smile. They just look at you and pretend you're not there.

After I ordered, I stood there waiting for twenty minutes and watched as person after person approached the counter and was treated the exact same way. When I said something about my long wait, the lady cut me off and pretended like she hadn't heard anything I just said. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME THING THE LADY DID THE FIRST TIME when she charged me twice for one meal and I tried to bring it to her attention. 

These ladies have no idea how to serve people and the whole restaurant was full of people complaining because they were being completely ignored and no one was even making their food.

Took her a few minutes to bring me back my card. When she came back with it, she was giggling and told me there was a sign on the drive thru menu that stated they were taking cash only as their card services were down. Not only was there no such sign, but why in the world would she take my card to run it if she already knew there was a problem? Funny because it was my first time coming back in about 12 years because I had a hankering for some fried okra.
