We had the pickled eggplant, charred babe ganesh, cauliflower shawarma and koshari. 

Everything was delicious, but the koshari is a must have. It was a pretty big portion so it was enough for me and a friend to share!

Honestly, this is the most excited I've been by a new restaurant in a long time.

Yes, the menu is all vegetarian, but this is no bland California salad shop. The dishes here are rich in flavor and texture - beautifully spiced and prepared combining family recipes and traditional street fare direct from Egypt. 

This is an order-at-the-counter place. Then they bring your food out to you. Super casual, but clean and bright.

I *love* Baba Ghanoush - the classic dish made with roasted eggplant and tahini. When I was deciding whether or not to order some here, the owner/chef said ""If you don't like it, I won't charge you for it"". (And then with a big smile) "" ...but you're gonna love it!"" she was absolutely right!   Beautifully smoky and rich - just a little chunky, with lots of vegetables - it is among the best that I've had. The pita that came with it was hot and fresh. 

The Cauliflower Shawarma -topped with  vegetables and  a thickened yoghurt dressing called labna - was hearty and filling. I loved it! It is sure to become a regular thing for me. I could eat it every day. you can also order it (like most things on the menu) as vegan, which substitutes a tahini sauce for the labna.

I am excited to start working my way through the whole menu.
Highly recommended!",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,5,3,5,BTMZOrRgFPT-H_aUzLDnzQ

The owner and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with explaining the menu and making recommendations. The decor is super cool and there's a nice, chill vibe. I got the Koshari and might have a new favorite food. The macaroni was cooked to al dente perfection, and wasn't all mushy. My wife got the ful mudammas and loved it. The drinks were amazing too. We got the karkadeh (hibiscus) and lemon na'na (minty frozen lemon drink). Everything was spiced and super flavorful. You can tell a lot of love, thought, and skill went into the food. The only upsetting thing was remembering we paid more for a bunch of garbage at Red Robin the other night. Never again! Thanks POTs!",KinSltDyhDOQObrffOLgvg,1,1,5,MlEcuH1E-vxtIop-GISzwg

1368042,2018-05-25,1,Jjwa-WCK73efAwVZRksWSw,"Pots is a good place for healthy Egyptian Street Food. It is further away from The Strip and the food serve here is Vegetarian and Vegan. There are a few items on the menu that is definitely worth trying. The Charred Baba Ghanoush ($6.99) is made with flamed eggplant mix with tahini and roasted pepper. It's delivered as a chilled eggplant dip serve with two freshly baked pita breads, and it's like having a little side snack. I've tried the Koshari ($9.99) which comes in a serving bowl filled with layers of rice, lentils, elbow pasta, chickpeas, tomato sauce, and caramelized fried onions. It's very tasty and so different from having Italian pasta. I can see why it's most renown as one of their popular Egyptian Street Food. The food I was most drawn to is the Cauliflower Shawarma ($6.99), I like this one the best. It has crispy cauliflower that's tossed in shawarma spices, drizzled with labna dressing and topped with arugula and the salata baladi includes tomato, cucumber, onions, and it's all serve in a pocket pita bread. The cauliflower shawarma is delicious. It has so much flavor, I just wish it comes in a bigger pita bread so I can have more of it.  

Regarding the soup they offer, I've tried the Orzo Mixed Vegetables Soup ($5.99) which has seasonal vegetables, zucchini, carrot, yellow squash, and orzo pasta. I feel the broth is missing some seasoning, the soup didn't have any flavor. The orzo pasta taste like it isn't fully cooked and the vegetables in the soup are still crunchy. It's like having bland soup and it's not what I'm accustomed to. Most likely I will not order this soup and I gave my honest feedback to the owner. It's good seeing how very kind the owner is, she is so positive even when receiving comments about how food taste. 

I tried a different order which is the Lentil Soup ($5.99), it's a creamy blend of cooked vegetables, there's a hint of tiny noodles that makes the soup thick, and it's topped with caramelized fried onions. I feel like I've found a new favorite because their Lentil Soup taste fantastic! They serve the soup fresh and piping hot, it's so hearty and creamy, there's amazing spices in the vegetables, and remarkably there are no potatoes. I love how the crunchy contrast of caramelized fried onions complements well with the soup.  

They do offer complimentary drink: lemon and cucumber slice water which is refreshing, and the hibiscus tea looks like pomegranate juice and it taste similar to acai. I tried the Tahini Shake ($5.95) which is a coconut milk blend with medjool dates, cinnamon, chia seeds, tahini paste and shredded coconut. The Tahini Shake taste okay, it's very light but not as sweet as I anticipate. The only downside I notice is the paper straw. I understand how they are environment friendly but when it comes to drinking in a paper straw, it just doesn't work. The paper straw gets soaked and squished. I think plastic straw is a better choice as it's more durable in sipping and slurping drinks. Overall I feel the quality of service is great. The owner and staff are friendly, very attentive, humble and down-to-earth, and I like how they take really good care of their customer.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,3,2,4,a3FyjLHW9Z8SGtpLuqYnlg

I had the Koshari, and at first it looked kinda simple--like most koshari--but, this koshari was excellent.  The secret, I think, was in the sauce.  Ask for the hot sauce too; yum.  The fries are fresh, fat, and nicely spiced.  Even the ketchup had a lemony flavor, which went great with the fries.  The lemonade and hibiscus drinks were five-star. They serve good size portions.  I ordered baba ganouch, but after having the koshari and fries I was done...lol... will have it later.  The cauliflower shawarma was really good, I was told, since it was vegetarian--it can be made vegan tough.

The laddies who own the joint are nice and attentive.  It's apparent that they make the effort in preparing fresh and great-tasting food.

The pictures I saw of the cauliflower shawarma showed this white sauce covering over the Pita but when I got home mine looked dry . I even asked 4 extra sauce on it when I ordered lucky I asked 4 an extra sauce on the side just in case.  It was good but with more sauce it could of been the bomb. The extra sauce was only enough for 1 pita u get two. I will go back but next time I will double check my order for the sauce.,fWd0NHizdU-zdL-FWJpLeA,0,0,3,oLpiyHf9LJQL8Hhh7aCi0g

1865220,2018-04-05,7,Jjwa-WCK73efAwVZRksWSw,"POTS has been on my radar for months, because I work out at the park nearby. Their ""nutritious, delicious!"" signage went up but gave no clues to the menu until they opened and began maintaining an active social media presence. TLDR: Egyptian street food, vegan and vegetarian. Rejoice!

Meatless Mondays are mandatory in my house, and I've long had a love affair with chicken shawarma, so the cauliflower version was my first venture into the tasty eats at Pots- and I was not disappointed. Ample portion, fresh ingredients, lots of tasty textures. Good option for first timers, vegan version available with tahini. If you're dining with a group, add on an order of Egyptian Fries, seasoned with dukkah. Portion is a little much for one, wish they had a combo option for solo diners. 

Looking forward to my next visit to try the Taamia (falafel) and Koshari, along with some of the desserts. Note that the pricing is a touch high (lunch for one was $20), but you can get a 25% off discount by signing up for their email group.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,18,4,UJdr8Ne3lEfGuV8ZwtAOzQ
1952544,2018-02-13,0,Jjwa-WCK73efAwVZRksWSw,"Ive been waiting for this place to open for almost two months!

Iman, the lovely owner and a really awesome person just opened today and Im excited to say, you will not be unimpressed.

Here is why I gave it 5 stars...

Environment: Laid back, very lounge like. Really gives off the aura of an Egyptian/Arabic kickback. Really cool to see the original pots used in cultural/traditional Aravic cooking (Hence the name, Pots)
Also when you look in, the first thing you see is the drop-in for food preparations and also the kitchen.

Staff: Very welcoming, very diverse and extremely well dressed for the occupation. I know it's the first day, and usually staff is gonna be extra happy and excited but personality always shines through and shows a person's true color.

Food: I wish I could have more details on the names of the various dips and breads I have sampled ( Just stopped in to say congratulations and give a look around) but the dips each had a very prominant and distinct taste of different spices, I am quite familiar with majority spices, due to working in Pakistani and Indian Restaurants, so my spice palette is very broad. Its very fresh and exotic.

Creativity: I, personally do enjoy eating meat, but also I enjoy having an alternative that is nutritious yet plentiful. It is labelled as an Egyptian Vegan Restaurant, I dont think you'll be able to find anything like it in Las Vegas. The idea itself is intriguing yet awe-inspiring to take such a risk to open up a business that might attract a whole new tier of intrests and favorites.

Overall: I have yet to give a more detailed review on the food itself, in which soon, I will have a part two of this review when i actually sit down and try a variety of their entrees, but I feel this will be my new spot to try when I need a lunch spot to head down to during break. Overall, I say, dont knock it till you try it, this new approach in Las Vegas is something to reckon.

Cheers!",1MLDG3lxKa8rFbVpnWJ2Mg,0,1,5,oJ4lM83V31LkLGIiXcTNJQ

I don't give out 5 stars lightly or willy-nilly. 

My husband almost cried tasting the food...
He hugged the owner twice. 

My 10 yr old said he couldn't believe we hadn't taken him to eat Egyptian food before and now it's his favorite. We are on our way back today, at his request and with my other kids, after being there only two days ago. 

Even if you are not vegan/vegetarian, try it!!
It would be a shame to deprive yourself of sampling this Egyptian gem. 

We had the cauliflower shawarma. Pita, so fresh, filling so flavorful with the right combination of ingredients/textures to make your mouth do a happy dance. 

Lentil soup. Im surprised my son didn't burn his throat scarfing down the  creamy, golden goodness in his bowl. Only complaint is that there is only a ""cup"" size and not a ""bowl."" If you like daal tadka, you HAVE to try this! 

Baba ganoush. Came with two small, pillow puffs of delicious, piping hot bread. Had to order more bread for 1$....and then like that, the container was empty and we were scraping down the sides with our fingers to get that last little bit. 

Koshari. My husband was skeptical at first, I think because he is not a macaroni person, but ended up with tears in his eyes while eating this Egyptian street fare staple. The sauces were spot on and intensified the experience that is dancing on your palate. 
I liked that the tomato sauce was not so sweet that it tasted like ketchup and it had the right amount of acidity to bring all the components together. The spicy sauce and vinaigrette just level it up. 

Egyptian fries. Thick, steak cut fries cooked in peanut oil and sprinkled with special spices. Served with harissa ketchup. They were good and my son and husband enjoyed them, but still, they are just fries. 

Vegan brownie and ice cream. Chewy on the outside and soft baked heaven on the inside. 
Going to try the other desserts today. 

The mint/cucumber/lemon water was refreshing. 
Sampled the fresh made hibiscus drink and even my husband, who doesn't like my hibiscus tea at home, kept slurping down the ruby liquid. 

The only thing that I can think of that would cause me to dock a star would be if they really messed something up. The owners attention to detail in all aspects of the experience of eating here tells me that isn't going to happen. I would love to be able to snag her for an afternoon/evening to come and cater one of my events! 

I have high hopes and expectations that they will do well here. Try it for yourself and see. Even if it turns out not to be your cup of tea, your body will be one day healthier and happier.",HcAyy3XZTCMSMjtg74k36Q,6,3,5,uVehsCVNfj7AxOArFQdKIQ
2423415,2018-03-27,0,Jjwa-WCK73efAwVZRksWSw,"I happened upon POTs while waiting for a smoothie from the little açaí bowl place in the parking lot. They had me wait behind the building for my order. To my unknowing benefit, the only spot open was right in front of POTs. The building and the name don't clue you into what's really inside. I had to google them to really figure out what was going one. But let me tell you, it's magical. Cute and quaint, little couches and a beautiful wall color. Their menu is bright and unique and full of delicious Egyptian inspired vegan and vegetarian options. After much deliberation, I ordered the cauliflower shawarma and pickled eggplant. 

Shawarma - 5 stars. Full of flavor and different textures. The pita was soft and tender and the tangy yogurt sauce brought it all together. It was the perfect portion size and I the spices on the cauliflower. Currently craving it whil writing this review. 

Eggplant - 4.5 stars. I'm only docking a half because there was nothing pickled about them. I got a lot of garlic and herb flavor but I was missing the acidity one is to expect from something labeled ""pickled"". I would say ""marinated"" is a better word. Nonetheless these things amazing. Packed with flavor. The texture was perfection and the fresh tomato sprinkled on top only made them better.  I could eat a bucket full. And! They come with the most adorable little pita breads I have ever seen! I made a weird noise when I pulled them from the bag... haha

2876413,2018-06-19,1,Jjwa-WCK73efAwVZRksWSw,"Never had Egyptian food before and was excited to find a spot that offers it so close to where I live! This was my first time at Pots and the owner(?) working here must've been able to tell by my blank stares at the menu. She was really helpful and explained the menu- everything here is vegetarian/vegan which is great! We ended up ordering the koshari, cauliflower shawarma, and konafa cup.

Koshari is apparently a very popular snack in Egypt, but I've never heard of it until now. What a great find as it's a bowl of carb heaven! Tender mac layered on lentils, chickpeas, and rice, topped with a tomato and crisp and salty fried onion (best part!). The koshari can be ordered spicy or non spicy and we chose spicy. It's actually pretty spicy so fair warning to those who can't handle heat. A different chili sauce is served on the side for those who want it even spicier. I found the sauce a bit bland, but the side of garlic vinegar was able to help elevate the flavor up a notch.

Cauliflower shawarma was my first veg shawarma ever. I was initially skeptical since I love my juicy meat fillings too much. The cauliflower was well seasoned and provided a texture nothing short of meat. The soft pita pocket, refreshing tomato/cuke topping, and creamy sauce enveloped the cauliflower nicely. I recommend fellow carnivores to give it a try as well, you just may be converted! 

The konafa cup was delish. Not too sweet, which I love. The shredded pastry was so delicate and crispy and worked so well with the shredded coconut and raisins. I wasn't too big of a fan on the pudding, however. It was bland and had a weird runny texture that made the shredded pastry soggy quick. Would be elevated if made creamier. Would have loved to see nuts added as well!

This restaurant is located in a small space but feels spacious with the cozy couch corner. Minimal seating but the menu is very takeout friendly. Healthy food at great prices. +1 for the refreshing mint infused water!",4ywoghefRTsbi1SzkR-fcA,1,1,4,ktdkvPa-xBSbD-yAGu1yaQ

The cauliflower shawarma was very good with fresh ingredients and a interesting texture to the gyro.  It comes with two small pockets of pita filled with the cauliflower, cucumber, yogurt sauce, and greens.  Not the biggest, but tasty.  Adding a side is probably the best option with this meal, but it does start to get expensive at that point.  I added the hummus, which I did not like at all.  Harder than I'm used to and too many spices.  Might be good for some people's taste buds, but very different from the typical Mediterranean varieties in town and lacked the creamy goodness I typically look for in hummus.  The bread was fluffy and warm, but I wish I got some veggies as well for dipping.  Overall, I am very happy I tried POTs.  Unique for Vegas and offers healthy and more animal friendly options.  Service is fast and they specialize in takeout orders.  They offer free tea as well for dine in or while waiting for orders.

Our vegan said it was some of the best vegan food he's had in Las Vegas, and our Egyptian friend took one bite of the koshari and got that twinkle in his eye and said ""yup, that's just like back home.""

We also loved meeting the owner/chef Iman.  She's energetic, funny and clearly has a passion for what she does.  It was really a pleasure.

Never had Egyptian food before POTs, and I love love love to try new foods. Been here twice, definitely will be back more. It has a bit of a mediterranean vibe to it. Love it.

The place is small but cozy, clean and trendy.
 
Food is mostly vegan (score!) with some vegetarian dishes too. Flavors are new and unique compared to what is typical in this town. 
Second time came here with our office staff for lunch and we decide to share everything to try different foods.
Best sweet potato fries ever, seasoned perfectly! Egyptian fries are great too with tangy spices. Khoshari was delicious and very filling, if you are very hungry definitely get that, it's got noodles, lentils, veggies, very interesting dish. Must try the pickled eggplant, it has a strong garlic seasoning that is amazingly flavorful, the eggplant is best eaten with their pita bread.

Desserts! The baklava is made with dried fruit and is quite amazing! The dough just melts in your mouth. The other favorite was the coconut flake dessert. Crunchy, and sweet complimented by coconut yogurt, sooo good!

The owner completes the whole thing with her vivid, bubbly personality! Very attentive and warm to her customers, definitely draws people to come back and have more of the delicious foods and pleasant atmosphere!

5279587,2018-06-30,2,Jjwa-WCK73efAwVZRksWSw,"Recently generating some buzz on South Rainbow north of Oakey it was for dinner on Wednesday evening that two guests entered POTs, the owner and one employee immediately emerging from the back as another party followed and explaining the concept as ""Authentic Egyptian Cuisine,"" a novelty to the Las Vegas market despite several other restaurants presenting various dishes originating in the Middle East.

Bolstered by good word of mouth since opening in February, owner Iman an affable sort who hangs out in the dining room asking guests their impressions and offering details about POTs' concept, it is from a limited number of dishes featured on an overhead menu that guests make their selections before paying at the counter, prices including $7 Fries and small containers of various Spreads for $8.50 decidedly steep based on Ingredients, though there is no doubt of the kitchen or staff's commitment to serving a quality product.

Pleasant in terms of décor, a bookshelf featuring various knick-knacks set next to two couches while steel chairs and light bulbs suspended from rope add to the ambiance, it was shortly after spending nearly $50 including tax and tip that first items arrived, the Egyptian Fries blistering hot and crispy beneath spices including Cumin, Sesame and Mint while fried Sweet Potatoes were served room temperature and more subtly spiced but excellent in housemade Ketchup brightened by Citrus.

Offering no Meat on the menu, most items either naturally Vegan or possible to prepare as such, it was while eating Fries and sipping a thin Shake with mild sweetness that two Pitas arrived next, one called Taamia and described as Egyptian Falafel well prepared but marred in its flavor by too much Mint while Cauliflower ""Shawarma"" fared better in terms of taste with an even lighter and virtually oilless texture.

Finally served Dessert prior to finishing Pitas, a minor issue only since one included Ice Cream, it was here that POTs suggestion of ""by mixing the familiar with the unfamiliar, we produce a taste like NO Other"" rang most truthful, a dish called Mahlabeya offering the texture of Panna Cotta beneath Apricot Jello studded in dried Fruits while the Brownies were much like many similar Sundaes except that the Chocolate contained salty Tahini and bits of melted Halwa which rendered it sticky and sweeter in parts, much like Salty Caramel but without the Butter or Milk thus making for one delicious Vegan treat.

THREE AND A HALF STARS:  Unquestionably a niche Restaurant, fast-casual concepts featuring healthier options a continuing trend that should be embraced, POTs adds something new to The Valley and does so with honesty and passion, but considering the simplicity of their Ingredients prices trend a little higher than need be while such a brief menu does little to demand return visits save for those with specific dietary needs.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,2,3,zKoWYbq2VTHvmpNkf2f5Qg
5280952,2018-02-15,2,Jjwa-WCK73efAwVZRksWSw,"POTs is a welcome addition to the Las Vegas dining scene. The restaurant adds much needed culture to Vegas that you'd typically find in the most diverse neighborhoods of NYC, Chicago, and San Francisco. 

You enter the restaurant a small takeout counter. Walk just a few steps around the corner and it feels as if you've been transported into your Egyptian friend's home. And that's before you even get your food.

The owner of POTs is a delightful woman named Iman who can educate you in all things Egyptian. Be sure to check out the Egyptian cookbooks and the century old pots.

Egyptian food is new to me, but I found the menu to be inventive and pleasantly priced. I'm so glad that it wasn't just another Mediterranean restaurant.

If I could have ordered every item on the menu, then I would have. Instead, I opted for the following dishes:

Chard Baba Ghanoush: I'm usually not a fan of baba ghanoush, but loved the smokiness of the eggplant.

Hummus: I love hummus, but my daughter does not. Please tell me why she's been craving Pots hummus?!

Egyptian Tzatziki: The flavors of the yogurt based cucumber and mint dip were super-intense and flavorful. 

Pita Bread: The warm pillows of pita bread were the perfect accompaniment to the mazzas.

Koshari: It's going to sound odd, but trust me...it's good! There's a base of rice, macaroni pasta, chickpeas, crispy fried onions, and a special tomato sauce (in mild or spicy versions). My prediction is that Koshari will be trending in 2018.

Cauliflower Shawarma: Bomb!! The fried cauliflower had the consistency of fried fish. I found myself inhaling it. 

French Fries: These ketchup paintbrushes are not to be missed! They are reminiscent of chips (fries) in London. Perfect crispy shell with soft innards. Don't forget to try their spicy ketchup.

Chef Brian is passionate about his craft and everything is lovingly made.

Thank you Iman and Ayat for treating my family so well! It was nice to find a vegan/vegetarian option that we all can agree on. I wish POTs the most success and will be back soon.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,7,10,5,q6gieq1yceImh76xoVeSSQ

The Koshari looks like carb overload at first, but for some reason the mix of pasta, rice, lentils, and more just work! There's a fun balance in texture, too. I got it with the spicy sauce (featuring jalapenos) and it was delicious.

The baba ghanoush was chunky, with veggie bits. Still good! I just wish it came with more of their delicious, homemade pita. (Only 2 pieces? Blasphemy!)

The Konafa cups for desert are a MUST-HAVE!

I got my meal delivered, and it was packed perfectly, with everything still looking beautiful and the right temperature. I can't wait to go in and visit the restaurant.",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,1,2,4,fRrF3afJ9B4lXhtiqZn2zA
