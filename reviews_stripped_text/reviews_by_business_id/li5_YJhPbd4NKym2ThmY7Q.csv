246433,2017-07-17,1,li5_YJhPbd4NKym2ThmY7Q,"Granny's was a nice place to get out of the 110 degree heat. I enjoyed a nice glass of ice water, and reruns on the TV while my order was being prepared. 

The place looks like a hole in the wall on the outside. Pretty spacious inside to my surprise.

It takes a good 15 to 20 minutes to prepare your order, so don't come here in a hurry! 

Yummy greens cooked with turkey. Very tasty!

The chicken is part of Louisiana Fried Chicken chain. If you like that chicken chain's taste you will be right at home at Granny's.

Clothes for sale here too.

Yep I'm definitely a new fan. Be back when I'm back in Vegas for sure!",pq8mIMFNG_6G52ihjIWcdw,1,0,5,DUwBkF5lyIQiM8P0sRihdw

 I was in the mood for some good home style cooking and Granny's hit the spot.  I get the smothered chicken with rice and gravy and greens . The greens are the best!! The chicken is cooked just right. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the don't have banana pudding  .

1102407,2017-09-24,0,li5_YJhPbd4NKym2ThmY7Q,So I've been craving some Greens & MAC .. Granny's Kitchen did not disappoint!  I used DOOR DASH to order & everything got here in a timely manner. I ordered the Special with 8 pieces of chicken & two sides... I also got roles. I couldn't resist ordering Peach Cobbler & wow was it tasty! Chicken was Spicy Crunchy & Succulent ! The Greens had just the right amount of salt & flavoring ! Mac & Cheese was the best I've had aside from homemade... I will definitely order through Door Dash again & I may just go take a trip there to try other things! I'm so happy I found Soul Food in Vegas ! Thanks Granny ..   you made me happy !,ITmCF8Yg_76t80YbpSbDtg,1,0,5,s3jpd8iH-scEwHLHdWBgdg

We turned down Maryland Parkway and saw a sign for Granny's Kitchen.  We pulled in and what a gem we found!  You are greeted at the door by three staff members as soon as you enter.  After being seated we ordered one fried chicken and two fried catfish dinners.  Your meal comes with 2 sides and cornbread or rolls.  The catfish and the chicken were both cooked to perfection and the seasoning was just right!  The yams tasted like something your Grandma made on Thanksgiving with lots of love.  The Mac n' cheese was creamy and delicious and when you took a forkful the cheese was stringy!  The collard greens had smoked turkey in it and was full of favor.  We even drank the ""pot liquor"" from the bowl!!!  If you don't know what pot liquor is...you need to ask somebody!  LOL.  Also kudos to our waiter Xavier.  He took good care of us and was very polite.  We felt like we were down South because he kept saying ""Yes Ma'am, No Ma'am"".  He even remembered our names as we left. We highly recommend that if you feel like eating some soul food and having good service...stop by Granny's Kitchen.  You won't be disappointed.

1788665,2017-03-24,1,li5_YJhPbd4NKym2ThmY7Q,"I was pumped to try a new soul food spot in town and right down the street from my job and house. I walked in and a gentleman comes from the kitchen wearing flip flops and dirty jeans. The girls in the kitchen were not wearing hair nets or gloves. They said it was going to be 20-25 minutes and it took 45 minutes which was most of my lunch break. As i was waiting i noticed there was a bug zapper hanging in the register area. I have been to many souls food restaurants and i always order either smothered chicken or smothered pork chops. I decided on the chicken here. Every other place that includes a bed of rice, the chicken on that and the drowned ( smothered ) in gravy. Here you have to order rice and gravy as a side and it is a very small portion. There was gravy on the chicken but i would hardly call it smothered. The mac and cheese was very good. The flavor of the chicken was ok. I thought the Louisiana hot sauce flavoring was a little too much but not bad. For the quality and amount of food, i would say it is a little too pricey. I most likely will not return.

Upon leaving we saw signs by the register that said the chicken is spicy,  but the waitress should have told us. 
The mac n cheese was bomb and the yams were good. The corn bread was different. We had 5 orders with 4 orders of yams and they ran out of yams for one person in our party.  The sodas were flat.

3593213,2017-03-23,3,li5_YJhPbd4NKym2ThmY7Q,"Out of respect for a new business, especially with a soul food model, I will give it 4 stars, even though the food and the experience was not 4 stars. 
Ordered a 2 piece chicken meal to-go. Informed that it would be 20-25 minutes, which I respect as it means the chicken is cooked to order. Arrived about 25 minutes later and ended up waiting another 7-10 minutes for my food. While waiting I was entertained with 2 African American women yelling at each other full throat in the back by the fashion section for a solid 5-7 minutes. My assumption was that they were employees/owners as none of the nice ladies behind the counter even flinched. Not an inviting environment for customers to say the least, even though I got a chuckle out of the absurdity of it. On to the food.
Fried Chicken-Great seasoning, nice size, WAY overcooked. Half the meat in the thigh was equivalent to jerky and maybe a quarter of the meat on the breast. Could have stayed in the pan for 3-4 minutes less and been perfect. 
Mac and Cheese- Very good. Better than most.
Green-Very good. Better than most. 
Dinner Roll-Store bought regular dinner roll
Service-Ladies behind the counter were very friendly and efficient. 
Price-$15 and change (without tip) is pricy for a 2 piece chicken meal with 2 sides and no drink.  (I upgraded to breast and thigh, but still) For some reason I find this across the board with Soul Food restaurants in general. Don't know what the philosophy is behind this, but it doesn't seem like a good business model. 
Will try it again before I give up on it, no excuse for WAY over fried foods.",bjcKhXmbSJISNMe_6CYhcw,7,1,4,4iP6PZ2_6H6E0Yh05fkMJQ

So I thought I would be able to have a seat and eat.  But it took 25 to 30 min.  they do state that.  But If your not reading everything, you don't know that, and not only that, no refunds.  So if you see the sign later after you paid for you, your not getting your $$ back.   So  by the time my chicken came out, I had to get back on the road.  So I had to eat and drive, and that chicken was hot!  So I had to push that aside, and eat the mac n cheese.  OMG, this mac n cheese was off the chain!
