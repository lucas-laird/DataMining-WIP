The fall down and the broke & bloodied. Both delicious. We had the family style platter and an order of brisket. Their brisket was delicious. They have 4 different sauces. Try each one! Megan was our server. She was very pleasant and helpful. They have brunch option that come with endless mimosa, bellinis or bloody marry's for $20! Definitely a steal on LV BLVD.

There was more than enough to stuff 2 of us and have plenty for leftovers.  We also enjoyed the different sauces, with our favorite being this tasty Alabama white sauce.

It took forever for us to get our drinks and then all our glasses stayed empty for over 10 minutes. The service was extremely slow.  When the food came out everyone was served except for the two people who ordered salads. I guess they had a problem changing the chicken in the salad. Their salads were delivered 10 minutes after everyone else's food and then the salads didn't have avocado as they should have. Some people in our party were disappointed with the quality of the food. Our waitress seemed disinterested in our concerns.  Our finished plates stayed on the table for over 20 minutes until they were picked up. This was not the experience we had hoped to celebrate my dad's 77th birthday. Needless to say we won't be coming back.,EJ9WW_U4xb9Hhnj5PTaCcg,0,0,1,KbQKx4Y48geh7--F9yEd2g
64231,2014-11-19,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"After recently moving to LV from the deep south my fiance and I were quite excited to find a new BBQ joint because we both love the stuff.  However, Pot Liquor was very disappointing.

Highs:
-Service! There was a French gentleman (owner or manager) who was very nice and our waiter did the best he could considering the ridiculous wait times.

-Baked crab app was delicious.

-Kale cashew slaw was delightful.

Lows:
-Service was EXTREMELY slow.  Dining room was half full and it took 45 minutes for the apps, then another 45 for the entrees to appear.  I had beer but my fiance's cocktail took 20 mins.  Smoked meats aren't done to order so I have no idea what the hold up was.

-A terrible smell, sewage or grease trap meant we had to move tables.  The issue was handled well and there were plenty of tables to choose from but be warned it was nauseating.

-BBQ overall was not very good. The pulled pork was in fact chopped and both the seasoning and smokiness were tepid.  Lot of fat left on board too.

-Chicken was mediocre and all the sides (except slaw) were under seasoned.


I know that this place just opened and  the service issues could just be kinks but you have to nail the BBQ down. This place is pricey and it's just not worth us trying it again to see if they've figured it out yet.",9OzwGCq2m6FNJ0jNp3_ZAA,2,0,2,YPYuvAa_T4FOSVoRJMKzug

The manager walks around looking at his phone and never greats the guest. 2 of the 3 times they tried to give me someone else's order and then tried to charge my table. The manager even accused my party of not paying our bill when we all paid in cash. Also, good luck trying to find your waitress once she/he drops off your food. 

The food is not good. Ribs are tough and did not fall off the bone. Greens had a funny taste to them. Yams had marshmallows on top that were burnt and over all did not taste good. The catch of the day was jambalaya (yes, that's what the waitress said). I'm not sure how that is possible but WHATEVER!

Pot Liquor should stand the test of time if they can get the locals thru the door along with tourists. Great value Mon - Thurs 25% off whole bill during happy hour. We had the sampler platter with ribs , sausage and pork plus all the sauces. Beautifully presented and excellent tasting quality. My partner had prawns with boudon noir ( black sausage ) which was delicious. Later we tried a selection of smoked bacon, smoked chicken ( which is brined for 24 hours prior to smoking ) and braised ribs. These were superb and I would not like to choose which is the best dish here. All were scrumptious.  For dessert we had fried pie with creme anglaise and bread pudding. I thought the fried pie would be heavy but it was light and fluffy with a melt in the mouth sensation. The bread pudding was slightly heavier but deliciously delectable. The atmosphere in this restaurant was easy and very convivial much like a downtown New York Tribeca hangout but with much better service. The staff were a delight and our server Leah was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and genuinely really lovely. The other staff were really great too. I know this is a newish place but it is always nice when the owners are present and mingle with their customers. They appreciate all feedback and  comments. All in all the Best BBQ in Las Vegas.

180860,2015-07-06,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"My friend and I were meeting at yard house, we saw the brunch sign and decided to try this place. 
I asked hostess how their brunch worked and she handed me a paper. I asked ""do we get all of this?"" Thinking it was in smaller portions. She said yes. My friend and I were seated. We decided on belinis and were told you pick one item from the brunch menu. No biggie. 
The belini's were nothing special and then for the refill our waiter gave us mimosas. When asked he said- no it's a peach tangerine mix. NO, Peter, it's orange juice. 
We ordered the hash and ham steak and eggs.  For our next refill my friend actually told our server, nope, that was orange juice- we asked for the belini like our first one and he comment, ""oh they're not strong enough?""  I wanted to say - no, it's just not what we ordered, but I do agree they were not strong enough. AT ALL. 
My friend ate her hash, her eggs were not cooked well. I ate my ham steak, not good. I asked for a side of some type of sauce to help with it, but they didn't have any. The little spot of grits- very good! 

After eating we walked around town square.  On my drive home I began to feel sick. Very sick. Luckily I made it home just in time and I have been resting ever since.  My stomach is still upset.

The only difference between kids and adult is that the adult has baked cheese on top and the kids doesn't but is bottomless, so if you plan to get mac and cheese, get the kids version. The ribs were also undercooked and wouldn't come off the bone.

It turns out the place rocks on many levels. The food was fantastic. We had the pork belly and grits appetizer and the deviled eggs to start. Both excellent choices, although the sauce on the pork belly may be better off on the side because it is very sweet. Then we followed with the pulled pork sliders and a half rack of baby back ribs with the corn succotash and the collard greens. Taste, texture,  sauce and presentation were all extraordinary. The only concern I have is that they did not offer hush puppies or fried okra. I grew up in the south and those sides are staple. Being from the south, though, so many sides are staple that I guess you gotta stop somewhere, lol. The atmosphere was very casual and tvs at the bar make it a great spot for happy hour or sports watching.

214324,2015-02-02,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Just like to mention one thing: barbecue is the very  principle on which America was founded on. So now with that history lesson out of the way, I must say that this is a good choice for barbecue in Vegas. What I like about Pot Liqour CAS is how much they honor the main traditions of barbecue in the country: Carolina, Memphis, Texas, and Kansas City. And you can tell they do so with great respect to those regions. 

You can get the usual suspects here: brisket, pulled pork, ribs, smoked chicken, and even specialties like chili or pot pie. However, what really draws me to this place is actually their appetizers and sides. The burnt ends are quite possibly the best I've had in town and are a meal in itself. Also the pork belly with country grits was delicious beyond words. As for the sides I wasn't a fan of the candied yams, but the fries were really good and with the Alabama white sauce they're a winner. The cornbread was also dynamite.

If there's one thing I find to be a noticeable flaw about Pot Liquor CAS it's that the food comes out only slightly warm to slightly cool. This has happened the last couple times I've come here and I really wish they'd serve the food more heated. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who has experienced this. Other than that, Town Square is lucky to have a place like this and I think it helps Vegas gain more potential as a good town for barbecue joints, considering it's up to its eyeballs already in other types of food.

Love the concept of the place and have enjoyed the meals we've had. We've had brunch and dinner a have been there a total of 7 times. The service has never been amazing, bad twice that we left cash on the table without ever getting the check. 

The last two times we have been there for dinner though, we order dessert and coffee, once no coffee, once no cream. Today we went just to have desert and now, no cream again. 

The first time it happened, it's a mistake. That day it was overlooked, totally understandable! But 3 times?! That means someone doesn't care enough to be prepared for having business for all their courses they offer. Coffee, regular, plain ol coffee with cream and sugar is (or should be) a staple at a restaurant that serves dessert (and brunch for that matter). The manager today did offer to run and get cream for us. Which was really nice, but too little too late. We left. Third time of something basic is too much (and annoying) when you're expecting to have a nice enjoyable bite to eat, and they have completely lost our business. 

What's really a shame, is my husband loves bourbon, they have an extensive list of bourbons that he would order when I get dessert and coffee and now he doesn't find it enjoyable to go either. Such a shame...",tKfMXCS07c7EB3GIVpATUQ,1,0,2,x6JFJXEkC-9TI0WifyEYRg

297255,2015-01-09,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"It was my first time here. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and the Pork Rinds. First out were the pork rinds, they looked store bought, but I gave them a shot...nope, tasted store bought as well. It felt to me like they just warmed them up and served them. Not impressed. Next out was the pot pie. Not a traditional looking pot pie. It had a lattice  pattern crust just laying on top. The crust was very buttery, so much so it over powered the rest of the flavors in the pie. The veggies were a disappointment as well. Tasted and looked as if they were from a can of veggie medley. 
   Now the good news, a gentleman (who I assume was the manager) came to ask how my meal was and I told him. He told me how they were planning to take the pot pie off the menu for some of the reasons I had described and replaced my pork rinds with the Grilled Bacon appetizer. Now that was amazing! Think cut bacon steaks with a jalapeño jelly that had just the right kick and a slaw of pickled cucumbers and carrots. That made up for my entire meal.

The pulled pork waffles were fantastic and the concept of the bottomless bloody Mary's is great IF you can find someone to serve you. Servers constantly missed our orders, some in our party had several drinks, others never got any at all even though requesting. 4 of us had bloody Mary's that all looked different, garnish, no garnish, super spicy, watered down etc. the check was a mess and apparently gratuity was included for our party which would have been nice to know.

At our table we had:
Burnt Ends Appetizer- cooked perfectly with a great balance of the rich, fattiness and jerky like seasoning.
Grits and Pork Belly Appetizer- creamy, juicy, tasty and completely satisfying. 
Baby Back Ribs-  Cooked to perfection, fall off the bone, juicy and hearty.
Shrimp Po Boy-  Fresh, hearty and a lighter way than the usual Po Boy you find around, but could use a little more spice or Cajun seasoning.
Short Ribs- A great ""pot roast"" like quality to the meat that left it flavorful and Not dry at all!
Mac and Cheese-  Creamy, not dry at all, a great crust on top and the kind of cheese they use in it is just right!
Yams- You can actually taste the yam!!!  Unlike some places that smother your yam in some gelatinous candy goo, Pot Liquor's has a wonderful, subtle sweetness and a fresh made marshmallow fluff.  Sooooo Good!!!
Collard Greens-  this was my first time having greens and they were amazing!!  A great briny, savory-sourness with a fantastic bacony smokiness. I've heard that greens can easily be messed up and gross, but these, I would defiantly eat again!  Apparently, they use the pot liquor from these in their bloody marries too!  Yummmm!
Beer and cocktail list was great!  They make their own lemonade in house and to order for your sweetness preference! I mean, there really isn't anything bad to say about this place AND THEY JUST OPENED!!  If they are still working out the kinks, then we couldn't tell.  Highly recommend this to anyone!

410508,2014-12-15,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Very interesting place.  The tables are spread out, making it a good place to hang out with friends, since you aren't crammed in.  The decor is nice, the hostesses cute, basically everything you'd expect out of a Town Square restaurant.

The manager is super welcoming, has real conversations with the patrons, and seems legitimately interested in talking to people, not just the ""is everything fine?"" line that a lot of managers have as they run around the restaurant.  

The food is interesting and unique.  Here is my take.
The food is reasonably priced for Las Vegas BBQ, which is to say, unreasonably priced anywhere else, but thats par for the course here.

The meat is all smoked in a real smoker that uses real wood, I've seen the smoker, you can see the wood piled around the restaurant.   The pork seems like good pork (though I'm not a huge fan of pork), the brisket was very tender and flavorful, which IMO means its a shame that they don't have more beef products, I bet they'd be great.  

So what I've had thus far.
Bacon Steak - Uncured, its like a pork loin.  Its ""good"", but I prefer cured bacon.
Hot Links - Excellent.  The herbs taste ""bright"", probably freshly made there.  Not  spicy, I'd say a 5 or less, I can't perceive heat below a 7 at this point, but another person at a table said it had a ""kick"", thus my impression that its a 5.  It was a very ""different"" flavor, some might not like it, but I say give it a chance.
Mac & Cheese - I don't eat it, but everyone else seemed to love it.
Pot Pie - The pastry is puff pastry in an interesting latticework pattern floating on top of the chicken soup.  The chicken soup is amazing, the puff pastry is puff pastry (blandish).
Sweet Potatoes - Interestingly served with lemon zest giving it a citrusy freshness that I disliked and everyone else really loved.  They put marshmallow cream on top and toasted it, which I now do on my own sweet potatoes, but I leave out the lemon zest.
Brisket Hamburger - This was amazing, a very generous portion of brisket, a great tasting hamburger, good bun.  Really tasty.  I ate my leftovers cold the next day and was yummy.
French Fries - Yummy thick cut french fries.  Not necessarily fancy, but seemed fresh (but none of the burnt starch problem like a lot of fresh fries, which I like.
pork ribs of various types - nice amount of meat, smokey flavor, its pork, probably good.

For dessert, we've had the pumpkin fried pies and had brownie bread budding.  My friend loved the brownie bread pudding, but IMO it was overly toasted, with a slightly burnt flavor.  My friend likes burnt brownies so whatever.

So in the end, I didn't love the place as much as I do Lucilles.  Its not an apples & apples comparison, Pot Liquor doesn't have baked potatoes nor beef ribs, two of the most ordered things I get at Lucilles.  Pot Liquor made me go outside of my box for a lot of things, which is interesting and revitalizing.  My friends might want to go a lot, they seemed to like the flavors more than I did.  

I would like to experience beef ribs here, and I'd like to try the brownie bread pudding again to see if they intentionally make it that dark.",02sxoqCJ_1lbk_t2GCLxQQ,0,0,4,5cVHRwe7kNH-NWpyk_Jc2w

The only criticism I have about the place (not the food) is it looks more casual than the prices suggest, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Devil'd Eggs ($6)
2/5
The chicken cracklings were the only strong taste on the eggs.  The mustard and pickle flavor were missing and they desperately needed seasoning.

Bacon Steak ($10)
5/5
I cannot express how delicious this dish was.  The cucumber and carrot slaw was very mild and fresh.  The jalapeno jam was bold and flavorful.  The bacon was savory and heavenly.  When you mixed the three together, it was like a fireworks show exploding in your mouth.  I need more of this dish in my life.

Lord Have Mercy ($60)
I was sad to discover that brisket didn't come in this combo.  Brisket is my favorite, so I'll have to return to try some. It did include:

Dry Rub Ribs
5/5
These were the best ribs I've had in a restaurant, hands down.  Perfectly smoked and crisped, they fell apart as you ate them but the outside was wonderfully chewy.  Flavor was amazing as well.

Mopped Ribs
3/5
I found the execution on these ribs not as good as the dry rub, but still good.

Pulled Pork 
4/5
The texture of the meat was perfection.  Super moist, it disintegrated as you chewed it.  I felt it was missing something flavor wise, but I would definitely order it again regardless.

Hot Links
4/5
Super beefy.  Not quite hot enough though.  Good texture.

Chicken
5/5
It was perfect.  I don't know what else to say... but it was good.

Mac and Cheese
5/5
Fake cheese need not apply, this mac has all the flavor, creaminess, and cheese you could want!

Corn Bread 
2/5
I found the corn bread and honey butter pretty lack luster.  The bread was ok, but forgettable.  The honey butter had a weird consistency and lacked butter flavor, it tasted like milk and sugar instead of butter and honey.

Succotash
I hate succotash, so I didn't try it lol.

Lemonade
4/5
Super good, could use a little more tartness to be perfect.

While the brunch menu is small, the choices are quality offerings. We went with 2 friends and sampled 3 out of the 4 menu items - they were all delicious. I enjoyed the brisket hash, as it had great flavor and wasn't just a mix of ingredients covered in sauce that you would expect to find at another barbecue establishment. The pulled pork and waffles was particularly impressive. We did also try the bacon steak, which is really more like a slice of pork belly. We will probably skip that one next time and go for the chicken fried steak instead. 

Service was a bit slow, as I'm not sure they were adequately staffed, but everyone was polite and friendly. The iPad ordering system seemed a bit cumbersome and slowed down the process a bit, too.

 We went for boozy brunch on Sunday - ordered the Pork Belly on Grits and the Ribs Platter to share. We ordered off the normal menu instead of the brunch menu and our server informed us that we can still add bottomless mimosas/bloody marys to our meal. Can I just say that portions are VERY generous? We had leftovers for almost 2 more meals. The grits were cheesy and creamy, and paired perfectly with the slightly sweet and smoky pork. The 2 types of ribs were both delish, one more savory and the other sweeter. Both super tender, lots of meat on the bones, and great flavor. They give you extra sauce on the side in case you want to dip your ribs in them. Had the mac n cheese and collard greens as sides, both delish as well. Mac n cheese had nice cheesy flavor and collard greens had a nice smokiness to them. Wanted to try dessert but we were just wayy too full. 

I never saw bottom of my bottomless mimosa (and I'm sorry for being high maintenance, but I asked for just a splash of OJ, with mostly sparklies and they were nice enough to oblige).

Service was pleasant, water never went empty and server was actually quite knowledgeable about the menu.  

Compared to Rolling Smoke and Lucille's - I'd come here instead of Rolling Smoke because of the ambiance of the restaurant (there are real seats and it's clean, better service, too) and instead of Lucille's, well, because it just tastes better!

For the price, quality of food (and boozy brunch), and service, we will def be back!",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,2,0,4,ggHrKN5GG_jqMBX1vyMp7w

523936,2016-09-19,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Let me start by saying, I was surprisingly amazed by this slightly upscale-hipster bbq spot.  Two co-workers and I got off work early and wanted bbq.  Two of us are avid backyard pitmasters ourselves, so when he suggested Pot Liquor, I was game to see what he was all joyous about. 

I will say that my experience here rates a 5 based on a combination of atmosphere, service,  and good food.  

The restaurant, as I eluded, is not your typical bbq joint, and I have visited my share in Kansas City, Texas, Memphis, and Arkansas, as well as Nevada.  It was in fact very hipster and had a unique vibe with the staff, young and spirited.  The restaurant was also very clean and comfortable. 

The restaurant hosted a decent selection of craft and domestic beers, as well as a fully stocked bar.  

Our waitress, Dani, was hip and cool.  She was so helpful to us as we attempted to make our selections.  In fact, not knowing the menu, we almost ordered three separate selections just to get a sampling of everything.  Now, Dani could have taken our money, let us order way to much food, and sent us off fat and happy, just making money for the venue, however, Dani stopped us, gave us her honest opinion on what our best bet was and saved us probably $60!  To me that is service. 

Now, the food.  For appetizers, we went with pork skins and burnt ends.  Now, I am not a big pork skin fan, but these things came out smelling awesome AND crackling.  They were delicious! The burnt ends were good, in my opinion, cut a little large, but very tender and flavorful.  The sides, we chose were the greens, mac and cheese, and candied yams.  These were all very tasteful, however, I tried not to dig into them to much, because I was saving room for the meat!. 

The main dishes consisted of sliced brisket, baby back pork ribs, beef spare ribs, Carolina style pulled pork, smoked sausage, and a 1/2 chicken. 

I could write a book going over each meat, so I will just say that I was not disapointed in what this hipster bbq joint turned out.  My favorite by far were the beef spare ribs, which is suprising because I am a baby back pork rib fan anyday of the week.  But these beef spare ribs were tender and juicy, with a really great seasoning.  I was also glad that they were served dry. 

Finally, if you are concerned about sauces, they brought out a tray of various kinds, but if you want heat, you have to ask for it.  Their habanero sauce was reported to be 8 out of 10, and it definitely lived up to it! It was hot though, without overpowering the meat. 

All in all, I would suggest any bbq aficionado to check out Pot Liquor.  The prices are a little higher, so I would not suggest it for a large family with kids, who aren't going to be eating much, unless you just want to splurge. 

*on a final note, we learned one of the two chefs who started Pot Liquor had just passed away.  Dani shared this with us and she became very moved.  I could tell and I told her that I felt they are very family oriented and she quickly said this was a second family to her, and it definitly showed.",p7YdXcQC8Jinl0OWsNxafA,3,0,5,Dr2wBHqQM3BWJWBs5D4ylw

The pork belly and grits was amazing, though with six of us, we each only got a couple of bites.  I would order it just for myself; it was sooo good.  The chili was great, too.  

For the entree we ordered the Lord Have Mercy, and the Hog Wild, and we had so much food left over.  We really could have gotten by on just the Lord Have Mercy, but we thought we would need more.  The portion sizes were more than generous, and considering all the food we got, the prices were quite reasonable.  And, most importantly, the food was absolutely delicious.  With our platters we received five sides: 2 mac n cheese, 2 kale and cashew salads, and a potato salad.  Of those three, my least favorite was the potato salad, not a huge fan of the cracklins in it.  Mac n cheese was the best , so creamy and savory and yummy!

We waited for a table and immediately upon being paged because our table was ready, the hostess tried to convince us to sit at the bar instead. If we had wanted to sit at the bar we would not have waited for a table to begin with. After placing our food orders we began what turned out to be a wait of over 30 minutes for our food. We had visits from both our waiter and the Manager during this time assuring us that our food would only be a couple more minutes. When at long last the food was finally delivered, my friend's side was on my plate, one of my sides was on his, and my other side was MIA. We pointed out the mix up with the sides and they did nothing about it. We also pointed out the missing side and were told it would be right out. After that our waiter basically avoided us and another 30 minutes later the missing side was still MIA. When the waiter finally came over again we pointed out that we were still waiting for a side and it was finally delivered 5 minutes later. The ribs were not worth the wait -they were the mopped ribs so you'd expect some amount of moisture but they were dry. The kale and cashew slaw was actually good, and when the Mac n cheese finally appeared it was only so-so. The Manager did apologize profusely for the overwhelmingly bad service but at the same time was making excuses about being slammed. Really? You are a restaurant at a popular outdoor shopping area. Maybe you need better staffing. At least he did do the right thing and comp our meal due to the poor service but that is not going to get me to return.",S6qbQlZGgTCR4RdnBbHJIw,1,0,1,q-Hcyp7Y0dlw_1q97od35A

As if I had a choice in the middle of a Vegas heat wave I agreed. The water arrived and it said sparkling but there was no bubbles to be found in the bootle or nor my glass. After reviewing the menu I quickly noticed the limited options out of beef, pork, and chicken. In addition EVERYTHING was à la cart enclosing bread. We ordered the The Yard and Coop aka 1/2 rack of ribs and 1/2 of Chicken with two side a meal for two and hot links. The the ribs were favorless the ""half chicken"" was a drum stick, small portion of breast and a wing. The hot link was very dry and overed cooked. The collards greens were bathe in vinegar, the cubed potato salad was under cooked, mac & cheese was average at best, the canidad yams were tasty if the marshmallow topping was included in the bite, if not flavorless. The GM stopped by for a review and we asked for bread. He offered two cornbread muffins on the house which mildly redeems the experience. All in all, there are many other BBQ places in town and to be nickled and dimed over water and bread in the name of conservation, it can be better managed.

We sent the platter back and got platter #2. SAME PROBLEM!!!!!  All of the meat was cold, one of the slabs of brisket was a half slice of fat and burnt beef, and all of the sides were smaller portions.

The sliders were cold and dried out as if they sat for an hour.  (The person that ordered that dish became very ill vomitting later that day.)

I had read about the House Made pork rinds and the deviled eggs so we had to try them.  They were both delicious!  We couldn't stop eating the pork rinds and we were so stuffed when our meals arrived.  I ordered the Memphis Ribs and my husband the chicken.  We could have (and should have) split a meal.  They give you so much food! We couldn't do it justice and since we are from out of town (and no refrigerator in the hotel) we couldn't take it with us (except for the leftover pork rinds).  The ribs were very good!  My husband ordered the collard greens and loved them.  The macaroni and cheese was good but we weren't too fond of the potato salad.  The owners/partners came by the table and even started pitching in when they got busy. I will definitely go back on my next trip to Las Vegas.",Rhd85I21pa9rMs_78IimNQ,0,0,4,6TO-Df7ZGEuKyFImH3zPGw

The food and service was prompt and wonderful. The kids food came out early so they could start eating. The drinks were great too.

738994,2016-01-21,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"From start to finish, our lunch was a mess. To start, the hostess walked our party of 2 past three empty window tables and several interior tables until we were standing before a dirty table squished between 2 occupied tables. One table had 3 large guys, chairs pushed back against the dirty table, relaxing and enjoying their meal. The other table was just 2 guys but had enough room for an emaciated child to sit comfortably. We started to ask our hostess to move us but she quickly exclaimed that she would fix that and ran to wipe the table down, not noticing that there was not room for 2 adult women to sit. Once clean, she placed menus down and disappeared.   We moved the table so that both of us could squeeze in uncomfortably and dealt with it until the table behind me left and we could spread out. No plates, no place settings were offered.

We ordered pork rinds and corn fritters to start. The rinds were good, needed a dipping sauce or more flavor. The fritters were ok but the sauce was overwhelming their flavor.  Later we split the Cobb salad and butcher burger which was made easier after I took plates and silverware from a nearby table. No condiments came with the burger and we couldn't find our server to get any but it was decent as is. We paid extra for sweet potato fries that were cold and flavorless upon arrival.

We rarely saw our server. The gentleman from the kitchen who delivered our food also took the time to refill our drinks. That was more than we had from our server. We only saw her when we ordered food or she brought us the check. We looked around for a manager type to talk to but saw no one who seemed to be in control. 

A little history: we started coming to PotLiquor right after it opened and loved everything. After they took the catfish away, we started coming less and this was our return to an old favorite. And now we won't be back. The spark is gone. I know I personally missed seeing the French gentleman manager who always took the time to speak to every table.

Between the flighty server and the terrible food not to mention the system going down and forcing me to leave my card info wrote on the back of a scrap of paper I will never return to this joke. 

First the server, came gave us water didn't even ask if we wanted drinks. I had to ask him if I could get an iced tea. 

I do realize that I was at a BBQ joint but it was lunch and I just wanted a chicken sandwich. Ordered the grilled and was brought what appeared to be from frozen completely overlooked piece of processed chicken. To show the person I was eating with how bad it was, I took my knife and pushed into the meat HARD and it wouldn't break the surface. I was afraid to eat it so I ate my fries and the stringy tasteless stuff they called cole slaw. 

So when we were wrapping up our meal the server had been MIA through most of lunch. It wasn't that big of a deal until we needed our check and he informs us their system crashed. We wait about another 15 minutes and nothing. Finally we tell him we have to go but their system is still not working. I ask to see a manager, when she comes over she says since I don't have cash to pay they will write down my credit card info and email me a receipt. I asked why they didn't have crash kits ready with manual card imprinters and call in my card like every other place. They said they didn't do that and I would have to leave my info. I asked if my info would be secure - definitely not a problem. So the server comes back with a scrap of paper and writes down the info from our cards but not our emails. Seems like s secure method for collecting your customers info. I take the paper write it down myself and ask for the GMs card. So the server points to a guy in the front and says that's him ask him. Well I thought the girl that came over was your manager???  Hmmm she must have been an assistant or FOH manager. So as I walk over to this guy who seems oblivious to his store not functioning AT ALL right now but some sales lady beats me to him. So this guy is taking sales pitches during lunch rush while I just paid $18 for an inedible meal and left my card info completely unsecured and he's too busy to talk to his patrons about the problems with lunch. I ask the host girls for a card so I can call him later at this point I've been there almost 1 1/2 hours total. I'm late back to work. 

Still no email receipt - but they the charge is shown on my bank account. Thankfully for now there's no weird charges. I'll be canceling my card today. Thank you pot liquor for making me not only a terrible lunch but one of the worst dining experiences of my life.

842318,2014-11-05,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I grew up in Birmingham, AL and this was literally the worst BBQ restaurant I have been to in my life (39 years). If you didn't grow up with BBQ, please don't think that what they serve at Pot Liquor is BBQ. Even Famous Dave's is better than this garbage.

The pulled pork was cooked at too high a temperature for too short a time, so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didn't break down like it is supposed to, making the interior meat also mostly inedible.

They serve what they call ""Alabama Sweet Tea"". To me, it tasted like unsweetened tea. In the south, sweet tea is extremely sweet. I understand toning it down a little bit for those not used to it, but this was extremely bland. I complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch, but it was the same.

Their sauces have the non-descriptive names of Cue #1 thru Cue #4. I had to ask what they were. I tried all of them and they were terrible. I think #4 was their ""Alabama White Sauce"". Instead of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat, it was basically 98% mayonnaise with a little bit of seasoning. Disgusting.

They couldn't get basics right, and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.
Examples include:
""Fried Catfish Benedict"": Fried catfish should be able to stand on its own. hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.
""Devil'd Eggs"": topped with deep fried chicken skin. The flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.
""Brownie Bread Pudding"": bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination. Then they serve it with ""sea salt vanilla gelato"". If you asked for ""sea salt vanilla gelato"" in a real BBQ place in the south, they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.
""Fried Pies"": this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with ""malted anglaise"". What the heck?
""Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches"": sounds pretty straight forward but it comes with strawberry cream gelato. Again with the gelato!
""Kansas City Style Burnt Ends"": Another staple. But they shake ""sugar in the raw"" over the top. The burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant. Really? You can put sugar on meat that shouldn't have it but you can't put it in your sweet tea?

I told them their chef needs to visit Alabama and learn how to make real southern food. They assured me that he HAD visited Alabama and spent a whole 10 days there. You can't learn BBQ in 10 days. Good BBQ chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it. Pot Liquor does not serve southern BBQ or any southern dishes. I may try them again in a couple years if they haven't gone out of business. Perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned to make some actual southern food.",_hWTIuXfVTAg_lj7IxAZCg,2,1,1,PHrqjQGoEX5l81txhAyA5A

Since it was a birthday the waiter suggested the bread pudding for dessert as if he was comping a birthday dessert. Not only did we get charged for it!! but it was so dry and boring.  I even saw a family leaving outside the entrance and they had the same bewildered grossed out look on their face I had through out the meal as we sampled everything.  I stopped to ask them how it was and they said ""OK, the chili was good, but the ribs were not what they expected and not baby back!""  We agreed...YIKES! 
I am sorry this is the first review I have wrote and I am sorry it's bad but all 6 of us won't be retuning.  We love BBQ and this was just not the place for us.  The dogs were happy! Since we brought home 4 to go boxes of ribs and chicken :/ Sorry guys I don't know what happened, but it was bad.",P5qFr6eb0Hn1TaIaEOcKeA,0,0,1,kN5CySC13KHaOFGCGdrBtQ
893919,2017-11-10,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Decided to go to Pot Liquor CAS for happy hour for my birthday.  The menu online looked great and the reviews seemed to be worth giving it a shot. We walked in, there were only 2 other tables that had people at them. Finally got approached and seated. We had 5 in our party. 

Two of us arrived first - ordered 2 Sangrias. Took at least 10 minutes before we received them. Two more in our party showed up. They ordered water and a Stella. They were out of Stella. Waited at least 5 minutes for those two drinks to arrive. Fifth person shows up - orders iced tea - took a few minutes. By this time - the water was empty and the server didn't bother to ask if we wanted a refill. 

The menu - it's on BLACK paper. It is dark in the restaurant. You can't see the menu well. HH menu is reasonably priced. The full menu - pricier than I would have expected. Our order was - a happy hour item, a salad, half brisket platter, half pulled pork platter and a chicken & ribs platter. Remember - there were only 2 other tables there. Took at least 20 minutes to receive our order. It came out in stages. The HH item (pulled pork & grits) was good.  Salad was decent. Not much lettuce, but decent flavor. Pulled pork platter - good stuff. Chicken & ribs platter - you get a lot of food. Cornbread - UNCOOKED inside. Brisket platter - 2 pieces of brisket - 99% fat. Absolutely horrible.  Didn't even finish it. 

At this point, the server has checked on us ONE time. Not sure what she was doing - there were barely any customers. 

Disappointing to say the least !!",sJ810jkTNAjvpl-sg91_OA,2,0,2,8x8detOr1ovKVtnZodzGcQ

1005528,2014-10-22,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Okay, let's get this out front- American BBQ is back, in several incarnations. Probably the most ubiquitous lately has been the mash-up of Asian (mostly Korean) spices and ingredients and some traditional urban cooking methods (braising, pressure cooking, etc.) with a decent dose of traditional smoking thrown in,  but smoked meats (and cheeses) have been popping up in unexpected venues for several years now. Too many smoke purists are too stodgy about their favorite traditions and style to see much beyond that which they personally prefer, and BBQ strikes close to the hearts of many culinarians, causing even the most professionally objective to openly cast aspersions on other legitimate styles and traditions.

That being said- let's talk about Pot Liquor. It's in a decent enough and accessible location, and it's nicely appointed, if a bit echoey (probably could have partitioned the space a bit more, including a PDR with some custom features), it's got a nice big bar (big plus for this elbow bender), and pretty nice beer and whiskey selection. Service is friendly and attentive and thorough in explaining the menu. An on to that-

This is a bit of a traditionalist's BBQ temple featuring very high quality sauces from KC to East Carolina (vinegar-based), some old timey roadhouse favorites and comfort food and French country bistro (the not-to-be-missed boudin noir) thrown in for good measure.

As a starter, I chose the burnt ends, and, although serviceable, they didn't exactly impress. Sure they were smoky, and they had a bit of caramelized crust to them, but they lacked the serious ""bark"" that all pit masters should know how to produce. They were a bit on the cold side as well. I'm guessing they're using a cook-and-hold method that isn't really gittin' 'er done. The 'cue sauce (#2, I think), though was great. Don't get me wrong, the smoky brisket itself was good, but the indulgence of good burnt ends is all about that tender smokiness fronted by a seriously crusty bark. They serve these up with ""Pullman Loaf"" which is just white bread, the traditional mop for tomato-based BBQ sauce, and some simply killer pickles.

From there we had a nice selection of items- the Carolina pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, baby backs, some Boudin Noir, and brisket. First- the not-too great- both styles of ribs lacked the light crust that all good ribs should have guarding their near fall-off-the-bone tenderness, which, come to think of it, these also lacked, only just a bit. Many smoke heads argue that ribs should be a little firm and stick to the bone, but I've found the super-tender, near-melting meaty types tend to exhibit more depth of flavor. That aside- again, the KC and Texas sauces were spot-on exemplary with these. Speaking of Texas- on to the brisket. Brisket, in Texas, is the meat all BBQ chefs are judged by, and let's just say, if this was Austin, they'd need to argue for a do-over. While the pink smoke ring was apparent, and the meat nicely infused with smoke, it took good doses of the various sauces (and the collard greens' pot liquor) to impart any moisture. Properly smoked brisket will still ooze juice, but again, the killer sauces gussied it up nicely.

As for the good stuff- the Carolina pork is amazing- perfectly cooked, shredded, and perfectly matched to the East Carolina vinegar-based 'cue sauce. I also delighted in letting the pot liquor from the collard greens drip into the pile between bites. This is seriously addictive, yummy (super-yummy) stuff. Equal to it in many ways, but distinctly different was the Boudin Noir. It came with grilled prawns, which were expertly executed- firm but still juicy with nice caramelization, and a great celery-onion-orange slaw. All the flavors worked together as brilliant culinary composition, and the Boudin Noir is exquisite. The casing crackles and the interior is flaky-crumbly and moist. Another example of culinary crack. The Louisiana hot links were very well executed as well, with firm ""poppy"" casings and moist deliciousness therein.

The sides that really ""wowed"" were the kale-cashew slaw and the collard greens. The slaw is actually more slaw than kale, but is perfectly balanced, and not only are the chopped bits of cashew obvious, the night I went, the whole salad was redolent of the faintly sweet-nutty legume, as if the dressing was infused with cashew. The collard greens, like the Carolina pulled pork and Boudin Noir, are can't miss. Simmered in the namesake pot liquor, they literally drip with flavor.

Service, on the whole was pretty good, although at one point before I ordered, both bartenders got their backs to one side of the L-shaped bar talking with a couple- which is fine, but all good bartenders' heads should be on about a fifteen to twenty second swivel.

All in all, given the crack-addictive nature of several of the menu items, I will most definitely return, and I'll happily check to see if they've made progress on their brisket and rib items.",Da5Uocq-pwMwS_W50kTPWA,2,1,4,fJlGIMBQctwUh2thZKdPEQ

Longer Version: when you walk in you are immediately greeted. The staff is very friendly and you can easily see that they work as a team. Kudos to the manager for sure. 

The menu is basic, but does provide a variety for its size. There is also a large variety of alcohol to chose from (one of the largest whiskey menus I've seen). Most dishes are about $16, but the best experience is found in their combination BBQ platters that serve 2-8 people easy. 

For three people we ordered ""The Beef The Chicken And The Pork"", a combo platter that included smoked brisket, 1/2 roasted chicken, and pulled pork. Each came with its own sauce (I suggest getting extra sauce for the pulled pork). The two sides we had were Mac n Cheese, which was baked, and a rice dish called Jumping Jon. 

The Mac n Cheese was amazing, but the Jumping Jon was not. It was only ok. Mainly because it had a rubbery food product in it that none of us could identify. 

The BBQ was pretty good, but did lack that classic ""smoked"" flavor one would expect from a restaurant that has so much fire-wood displayed. Don't let that hold you back though. Each portion had a great flavor and fed all three of us with a small portion left at the end that we took home. 

The ambiance is very nice. The music consisted of ""oldies"" and the atmosphere is kind of a rustic Memphis-style BBQ joint with top shelf whiskey ready to complement the food they serve. The chairs are decent, it's easy to get in and out of, and the environment is kid friendly. 

Overall, I can see this place being a frequented place locals go to in Town Square for good food and great conversation. 

Improvements: bathrooms were not easily identifiable and aren't completely finished. Up that smoke! :)",5zBVA3WP4nIh4MP1c9xiGA,0,0,4,nid14P7-P3iPheZKfENMow

I had and old Army buddy in town who I hadn't seen in years and we chose to meet him and his wife there for lunch since we loved the place and it was close to where they were staying.  

My buddy and I each ordered the brisket and the wives decided on the pulled pork sandwiches.  We knew there was going to be problems since our server, a young black girl, had to be asked repeatedly for the salads and our appetizer, the Moink Balls, took forever to get to our table.  We we did get our salads and app the salads both had the wrong dressings and the Moink Balls were barely warm and had no flavor.  How you make a bacon wrapped piece of meat with no flavor is beyond me.  

The main courses arrived shortly after the apps and our disappointment continued.  The brisket was quite wet, not juicy type wet, but more like it has been soaking in a pan of water to keep warm.  The flavor, which is normally good, was way off.  It had an overwhelming taste of what I believe was chili powder.  The pulled pork looked like it had been made the day before and was kind of lumped on a bun with what I think was bbq sauce.  It was hard to tell since it was just one solid mass.

This visit was truly bad and I do not know if I will be returning, which saddens me since we had so many positive visits.",9qGOxS9tFI6M7QwG4JjYuQ,0,0,1,VeTBDhmTlVfxkdg2kTXr4Q

1312106,2014-11-07,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I was really frustrated with my two experiences with Pot Liquor.

My first experience I ordered my food to go. (This was roughly a month ago right when they opened) I'm a town square employee and I figured that order 30 minutes in advance would provide them with ample time to complete my order. I walked in and the hostess told me to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was prompt in providing my check and a glass of water. After that, the experience went downhill. Fast forward to me asking where my food was multiple times in the next 45 minutes. They still had not brought it out and I asked them to refund my card. Disappointment was an understatement. Also, they didn't reverse the transaction.

Yesterday, I opted to give them another try because I figured that the first experience was just a hiccup with them opening initially. They got my food out in an adequate amount of time, but when I went to eat my food in our break room, they gave me a grilled chicken sandwich when I asked for the fried chicken sandwich. I asked for no tomatoes due to a food allergy, and low and behold, tomatoes were on my sandwich.

I tried to give them another chance and they messed up again, needless to say, I will not be returning. I was really excited about a different option within the mall, but sadly they still have some kinks to work out. However, I'll most likely not be retuning to see if those kinks ever get addressed.",T102YnzI9pGgi6_SeVUqCw,6,0,1,RPy806FjwhlZKnD1VIRDtw

Cons = Just about everything else.  Our server was nice, but her service was slow.  The food took over an hour (not exaggerating) to get to us, and the food (that was actually what we ordered... Some was messed up) was over-cooked.  Also, for a BBQ place, they seem to have some sort of issue with barbecue sauces.
Ribs, Brisket, and sandwiches were ordered, and everyone got one half-filled ramekin of BBQ sauce each, that's it.  The Mac and cheese was good, although a little bland.  The collard greens were OK, but nothing any home cook couldn't do better with.
Going back to the lack of sauce for a minute, when asked for more sauce, they brought out a plate with 3 more half-filled ramekins on it, explaining they were the ""Q1, Q2, and Q3 sauces.""  when asked what that meant, we were told they are three different sauces... Great, thanks!

Growing up in Tennessee, I have high expectations and Pot Liquor exceeded my expectations! From the moment you walk in the door, you feel like you are in a cozy and relaxing establishment.  The decor is so unique and interesting! From the mason jar chandeliers to the pallet wood bar. The big tables encourage you to bring your family for some fun- which isnt that what having dinner is all about?  The service was impeccable. We never had to ask for anything because he was so attentive.  The food was perfect.  The ribs, brisket and pulled pork are so tender and juicy with an abundance of flavor. The mac and cheese was so creamy. The deviled eggs had a bite of crunch on top and were so yummy! Who knew deviled eggs could be THAT good?!  Their brisket burger is ridiculous. 

The only tiny recommendation I could make is that no BBQ place is complete without fried okra.  I think if they added this item to their menu, it would be complete. Also, only two cornbread as a side isn't really sufficient. Most places provide cornbread for each person.  That was the only con of our visit. 

 Don't let the pricing worry you- you get plenty of QUALITY food for that price (and really it is only a few dollars more than chain places like Famous Dave's or Memphis BBQ) and we had left overs.

Two side selections go with your entree. I had the green beans and corn bread. The green beans are made al dente and are not dripping in butter sauce. This is how I like my veggies, so it was perfect! The cornbread was good not excellent. I like the honey maple butter they serve for the cornbread.

What is going on over there ? Who is in charge of your bar ? Is there even a manger ? First you don't have bellinis on a Sunday and now you don't have beers that are listed on your menu ? 

Then I asked which beers on the menu were in-stock and he said that he didn't know. He wanted me to just pick one and he would go ask.

Manger never came over to see why I canceled my full-rack of ribs.

This spot is as authentic as you get for Southern BBQ. I'm hooked! This place has a fun atmosphere and is family friendly. The staff had impressive customer service skills. 

For appetizers we started with the BBQ pork nachos topped with chopped green onions, sharp cheddar cheese and jalapeño cream. 
I had to try the bacon wrapped meatballs called ""Moinks"" once I saw it on the menu,
served with jalapeño slaw mixed with garlic ontop of cheddar cheese toast. We also had crab fritters served with roasted garlic tarter sauce, marinated shallots and tomatoes. 

For the entrée we had the 'Lord Have Mercy' which consisted of delicious 1/2lb chicken, 6 bones mopped baby back ribs, 6 bones dry rubbed spareribs, absolutely succulent Carolina pulled pork and 4 Louisiana hot links.

1661934,2014-10-09,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Who knew barbecue could be so refined? Pot Liquor just opened up in Town Square and we are so happy to have it.  I immediately noticed the pork belly with country grits, and even though I'm usually not a fan of grits we decided to run with it.  This paid off, just order it. Seriously, just do it.  They were creamy and cheesy, and had the comforting nostalgia of mac and cheese.  This was a big deal for me because I need to stay away from gluten, and this is gluten free.  There are little GF circles all over the menu so anyone with this allergy shouldn't feel left out.  I didn't even get to the pork belly itself yet.  It was almost caramelized, nicely seared on the outside, while being rich, juicy, and tender on the inside. Most places I've been to, the pork belly is usually crunchy or chewy (sometimes overly), but this was neither. It was on another level, it melted in your mouth almost like you'd expect foie gras to. I'm gonna say this again, it was almost like pork foie gras. 

I got the Worcestershire braised short ribs.  The presentation kind of blew my mind, it was on par with the high end dining I've seen in Scottsdale or Cave Creek AZ.  This flavor was balanced, Worcestershire can be overpowering or it's used so sparingly you'd be oblivious to the fact you're consuming it if it wasn't listed.  The initial kick hits and tapers nicely.  The meat is falling apart as you pick it up with your fork, and again, the flavors are overall warm and comforting.  

Service was great, the food took a while to come out.  It's still worth it but it's hard to make within a lunch hour.  I also understand this place just opened and we think the kitchen might have been shot staffed.  We were there the day before the official grand opening.

I guess I could have asked for some on the side. I will say the sandwich was piled with pork so it was very filling.  I paid extra for the sweet potato fries. Holy crap...

Here's my story. When we arrived it was busy but not crazy & we were told there would be a 5-10 min wait. No problem and we sat down and just relaxed. 20 mins later we began to wonder & were told repeatedly by the hostess it would be just a few more mins. 45 mins later we were sat. Not cool. Be honest or hire competent people who know better. 10 mins later we were finally approached by an overwhelmed waitress. 

We ordered 2 sweet teas and received non sweet teas. Another waiter brought us 2 replacements and once again non sweet teas. We are now an hour into this experience. Third try is a charm, right? Nope not here! Third time and again non sweet teas. By the fourth time we finally got the right teas...

After all this I thought to myself, well the food has to be awesome because it can't get worse. First item ordered were deviled eggs. They were dry and the yolk blend didn't even hold to the egg itself. It tasted as if they sat on a counter all day, major fail. Next came the pork sliders, these were great. Then we split some baby back ribs, sweet potato fries and mac & cheese. The ribs weren't tender, the mac & cheese was bland but the fries were very good. Overall pretty mediocre food. I still can't get over the dry deviled eggs :(

We called a manager over because it was a really shitty experience and the food didn't make up for all the other issues. A nice older French man said all the right stuff and gave us 10% off our order. This is what I call a very poor judgment call. I wasted nearly 2 hours here and have zero interest in ever coming back.

1744662,2017-07-09,4,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"This review is for happy hour! Happy hour runs from 3-6 Monday-Friday.

We decided to drop by around 4 to get some food before watching a movie. You can smell the barbecue when walking in. Since it was 4, the place was pretty dead, but still, it took a while for the employees to notice us and seat us. We were given the choice of sitting at a booth or table; we said we didn't care and the guy sat us where it was clean. 

The service was SO SLOW. I think it was partially because we were sat near the entrance with another couple while the rest of the patrons were in the back. But c'mon, it's 4 and there are only so many patrons. It was slow slow slow. There was really only one guy waiting on all the tables. He checked up on us once, when we asked for ketchup. We never got the ketchup. And my boyfriend actually got up from our table and walked over to the bar area where we had to ask for the check.

Happy hour food is an insanely good deal. We got two rose lemonade sangrias, as recommended by yelp. Those were so so so so bomb. If I didn't have a movie to catch, I would get three more of those. 

We also ordered:
Pulled pork nachos - I would pass on these. Nachos were nothing special. The cheese tasted like the typical nacho cheese. It was topped with some sour cream but honestly there was nothing to break up the texture/flavor of the dish. Boring.
Pork rinds - it was still crackling when we got it. You can't go wrong with pork rinds.
Pulled pork and grits - this was the best dish. The grits were cheesy and delightful. You also can't mess up pulled pork. Get this one!!
Smoked wings and fries - it came with four pieces that were tossed in a smokier buffalo sauce. It was tangy, smoky, and a little bit saltier than I'd like. Fries were good (would've been better with some ketchup lol I'm not salty at all)

All in all, this place is great for its happy hour prices. Even if you order an average dish, it's ok because it's so cheap. I'm knocking off stars because the service was just so sad. And though there were some standouts, the other food was really just ok.

While I had always been a fan of Famous Daves and Lucille's, I was more than happy to try this place that was offering a nice discount. I ordered the mopped baby back ribs which I shared with my wife. We got two sides with it. We ordered the Hoppin John and the Mellowed Candied Yams.

The ribs were among the best ribs I've ever eaten. First of all they were meatier than any ribs I've ever gotten in the past. Even with two of us sharing a full rack, we were not even close to being able to finish it. The portion was huge. They were cooked to perfection. And I really liked that they weren't swimming in barbecue sauce. They just seem to put a small amount on to give it a little flavor. They did give a small container of BBQ sauce on the side for those people who wanted even more. But to my mind the amount that it came with was close to perfect. The Hoppin John side dish was a rice dish with some beans in it ( not really sure what kind of beans they were). That dish was absolutely delicious. A perfect accompaniment to the ribs. The mellowed candied yams are also very good. They were a little too sweet for my taste but what should I expect when the word candied is in the name.

We decided to sit at the bar because the place looked not that busy. It took the bartender quite some time to even acknowledge us. Again took a while for us just to get our waters. Only to find something floating in my water. He fixed it right then and there and took our drink order. Again took quite a long time just to get my glass of wine and my friends glass of beer. For that length of time I would've expected and entirely full bar and restaurant but neither were the case. Then my appetizer arrived I had to ask are the pulled pork sliders supposed to be warm?? They weren't even remotely warm the bartender then took it back and brought me out a new plate not long after. I was shocked not to see something taken off my bill for having to send food not because of the food preference but because it's not to standard. Then I got halfway done with my glass of wine only to see a ton of flakes of cork. Overall it was a disappointing experience.,LhxC6t1GLcOxY5I7exFnFw,0,0,2,SE_Fm7AhTwmNAQ0LPgU94A

Lately, more options have been cropping up but I've been careful not to get my hopes up. Pot Liquor has some great things going on, with several varieties of barbeque spanning the country all on one menu.

KANSAS CITY STYLE BURNT ENDS: a small heap of brisket delicacy, served with Pullmans loaf, house-made pickles, and 'cue #1. I liked the tanginess of the sauce, and the variety of ends I received- some pieces tender, some with thick bark, all juicy and flavorful. The pickles and bread were both nice touches, but the ends didn't need them.
FRIED TOMATO SALAD: I'll admit, I was confused by the dish I received. It wasn't a salad, more of an appetizer, and should be relisted on the menu to reflect that. However, it was good. Five thick, crisp-fried slices with mild goat cheese, spicy red onion, and a complementary dressing. A confident dish where all the ingredients play a specific role.

One of the managers was nice enough to speak with me for a while- I'll have to return to try the chili of all chilis, his favorite dish.

I wish it did.  

However, Pot Liquor cares about many of the right things and is as passable for high quality barbecue as we probably will ever get 'round these parts.  

Positives:
1 - Service was exceptional, beginning to end.  Pleasant as pie, perfect amount of attention.  Maitre D to waitress to manager.  Perfect.

2 - Really interesting menu.  And drink list.  This is a gourmet interpretation of barbecue.  There are some cool salads, apps.  

3 - Great portion size, but probably too much for any one person to eat. 


Issues:

Burnt ends:
At least the way I have experienced them, were not quite that burnt, and not quite end pieces.  These seemed like more of a pork belly cooked a fair amount.

Overall selection:
They feature specialties from so many parts of the barbecue belt (Carolina pulled pork, Ribs Texas style and memphis style, etc).  I think they need to perfect one technique and go with it.

Overall - the best Vegas has so I'm not complaining!",UUXpD55BsnpeXN6HKo-XUw,0,0,4,JGh0ZpTkarHImUFYrF1msg

Its located in Town Square next to the valet round about which I'm sure every knows and it's a fairly large Resturant itself. With cool decor it was roomy and comfortable. Lots of Windows that let in light and plenty of seats and tables. With a huge bar this place is legit. 

Wait staff was nice and friendly and pretty quick for the most part as well. For apps we had 

The Deviled  4/5
The Grilled Shrimp and blood sausage 3/5
and The pork grinds 3/5

Devils eggs were good just nothing extra extra ordinary about them good texture, flavor and creaminess that's all that mattered to me.

Shrimp had great chard flavor and the sausage you really have to like blood sausage. But for a blood sausage I like it just dried a little

The pork grinds were good had great crunch and flavor nice and warm but it taste just like the ones out of a bag even though you know it's fresh and not out of a bag. It would be perfect if you were to just sit at the bar and munch on these while drinking.

When it came to ordering that was hard because everything sounded so good. My wife order the pull pork slider off the app menu with the fries which were pretty good. I'm not a huge pull pick fan myself but these were good. 4/5 fries were on point. Not pictured 

We got the green beans and chicken tenders for my daughter. Tenders were good and crispy greens beans were long and skinny very high end even though they had very little flavor they had great crunch and they were yummy. 3/5 not pictured 

I ordered the brisket which was A M A Z I N G. Super tender and not too sauced. 5/5 the Mac and cheese was to die! Cheesy, gooey and came out sizzling in a small cask iron skillet pot thingy. 

Our friends got the burnt end which were burnt and chewy, caramelized perfectly but some might say it's burnt and dry....I like it not as much as much as my brisket though! 4/5 not pictured

The collard greens were Bomb I've never ever like collard greens before because it was just bitter and soggy these had great texture and flavor. Must try I think. 5/5 not pictured 

The jambalaya here is another dish that I was not too cray cray about but here at pot liquid it was BOmB! Spice level is up there so make sure you like spiciness but the flavor and the tenderness of the rice and the shrimp was oh so good. I would come here just for this. Needless to say they converted me for sure. 5/5

1976755,2016-02-25,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"This place did not impress me, and I'm a little bummed about it. I've had their pulled meat at a Yelp event and liked that. And their moinks at Stoney's (they have a booth with limited menu), again tasty. So I gave it a try for lunch. 

We got there before 12, trying to beat the lunch crowd. It took 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. We finally got our drinks and put in our order. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. 

Food quality, I ordered the Cobb salad (~$15).  Served with chicken, blue cheese, avocado, tomatoes, onion, egg, etc. and tossed with a bbq ranch dressing. All things I like. The lettuce seemed to be a combination of spring lettuce and romaine. I can't say for sure if it was the dressing (which was tossed into the salad) or the chicken seasoning, but this salad had the weirdest taste and I really didn't like it.  This complaint was a bit different for me, as my complaint with salads is due to lack of toppings or lack of freshness of toppings- never because of flavor. I actually couldn't eat it and ate half of someone's else's sandwich. 

The other item ordered was the brisket sandwich (~$10) served w bbq aujus served with fried. This was actually really good and would be the only reason I go back. 

Service: once we got our drinks the service was good throughout the meal. The waitress wasn't in a hurry to bring the check tho. In all, the meal took us about an hour, which was not due to chit chat. 

Price: expect to pay $10-20 per plate for lunch and $15-30 for dinner. A bowl of chili will run $16. Salads $15-20. Meat plates $20+. 

Bottom line: You can find better bbq elsewhere for a lot less. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else in town square for food (dare I say Texas de Brazil) and eat bbq at Rollin Smoke or John Mulls for a fraction of the price.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,3,0,3,_P3Uf1CCoyRIny7sz8o4AQ

We got chili cheese fries and OMG it was so good! Very nice portion, fries loaded with chili with tons of meat and cheese. 
Deviled eggs were alright, nice presentation, too much mustard for my taste. 
Pork Rinks were very fresh, came out still popping, light seasoning, super crunchy and crispy, soft and not oily, very good. 
Smoked moinks were interesting, nice flavor, came with bread melted with cheese on top, really delicious dish. 
Smoked wings were super salty! Nice sized wings but too much sauce and sauce was too salty. 
Pulled Pork sliders were really good too, love the sweet rolls, pull had nice flavors.

We got the burnt ends as an appetizer, which was good. My hubby also got the pork rinds, which he loved.

It took a while for someone to come up and take our drink order and when they did we put in an order for corn bread and specified we need them right away. 15 minutes later the waiter came by to ask of we wanted him to put the order in. What!!! Our drinks didnt come until the food arrived. When the food came, there was no ketchup or sauces and we had to wait and wait and wait for someone to come near enough to ask. I asked for ONE refill on my coffee at the end of my meal (couldnt find anyone to ask for moruong the meal) and yet they were somehow out and said it would be a while because they had to brew another pot.

We ordered, she ordered the skirt steak and I ordered the Cobb Salad with the dressing on the side and cornbread. When the food was delivered by someone other than our waiter she called the skirt steak something else so we weren't sure if it was actually what my friend ordered and this girl didn't know the food she was delivering or if the order had been put in wrong.  Also there was no salad dressing delivered with my salad. She ran away before we could get any words out.  And it was quite a while before anyone came back to our table. 

One comment about the food. The cornbread was terrible. Dry, no flavor. My salad was ok. My friend liked her steak although she ordered med rare and it was overcooked. 

When we were done it took a long time to pay our check. It was delivered in a timely manner but he never came back for it.

Much to my surprise, we didn't need reservations. When we got to the restaurant, it appeared very busy on Friday evening (July 3rd). The lovely Maître D'/Hostess at the entrance asked if we had reservations (we didn't), she said no problem and found us a table quickly. They have both regular tables and high tables/high chairs. I personally prefer high tables, and was glad to have got seated accordingly.

Shortly after being seated, our waiter, Kristen B., approached our table to take the drinks/appetizers order. We ordered lemonades all around, and a Georgia Margarita. Personally, I'm not a fan of Lemonades that are overly-sweet. Thank GOD the Lemonade here was just right as far as sweetness goes. My parents decided they wanted to try the Smoked Wings appetizer. They aren't really into the whole 'wings' thing, as they're old school, but let me tell you, between both of them, they made quick work of those damned smoked wings LOL. So much so, that they got full just off of them, and they passed on entrees.

As far as entrees, we ordered a half-order of Smoked Chicken, a full rack of Mopped Baby Back Ribs, a half-order of Beef Brisket, and 2 orders of Corn Bread! Oh yeah, we came HUNGRY and ready to eat LMAO! 

It took a while for the order to be brought out, which is understandable considering it was a busy Friday evening on a holiday weekend. We didn't mind waiting, because I knew everything we ordered was being made-to-order, and not sitting under a heat lamp (Main reason we came here.) When the gentleman came out with our food, I was surprised at the servings -- I mean they didn't cut corners on anything. The full rack of ribs had over 12 ribs, and the half chicken was a very generous serving. 

The Baby Back ribs were very delicious, and it definitely helped that they provide you with extra sauce to drench all over your ribs with. Some places have ribs where the meat feels very rubbery, not here. The meat was very tender and the smoke on them was just right, not overbearing, as well as the seasoning being spot-on. You can tell that the people they have working in the kitchen know their BBQ. 

The Smoked Chicken was very very juicy, and again, the smoking on it was spot on, not over bearing like at some other places we've been to, and seasoned well. The damned corn bread was so good, we had to order a 2nd serving of it. It's put into the oven upon ordering, and so what you get are three biscuit-style pieces of corn bred, which paired with their honey butter are extremely ADDICTING! If you're on a diet, you better make this your cheat meal of the week LOL

Only one other place I've been to has had Brisket this good (Fat Matt's Ribs down in Atlanta). Again, here you can tell that the folks at PLC know their brisket and they know how to slow-cook their Texas-Style Brisket. I'm talking about Brisket you put in your mouth and it just melts inside your mouth like it was butter -- That Good!

Two of us couldn't do all this food justice (The parents themselves got full with their appetizer, leaving 2 of us to consume the entrees), so we had to take some ribs/chicken back to our hotel (Too bad our hotel didn't have a microwave, but late night wings/ribs after a night of clubbing hits the spot just good!). 

Being Las Vegas, a place with infinite dining options, it is truly a foodie city. What can separate one establishment from the next is not only the quality of the food, but most importantly (to me), the level of professionalism of the staff. I must say that Kristen B, and the gentleman who's name escapes me right now, made the visit very welcoming and pleasurable. Very attentive to our needs (we had a toddler with us, Kristen brought her a lemonade diluted w/ half water), and always making sure to ask if we were enjoying our meal. Very great dinner service with a highly attentive staff. You can't go wrong with Pot Liquor CAS.

I will be returning in September with some friends for the UCLA/UNLV football game weekend! This is definitely on the to-do list everytime we hit Vegas!",Si6CDh3AIT5hrsqYFebLLw,0,1,5,sRO7bgVufMqSInBK7C96CA

Three if us arrived early to get a table while the other three went to the ATM; I figured once part of our party had arrived at the restaurant they would at least give us menus and be aware that we needed to be served.
When we were all seated together it started out good- we got menus and all of our beverages but when we receive the second round of beverages before our food had come we started to worry
The waitress didn't even address the fact that our food was taking longer than usual and the restaurant wasn't even full! Finally our waitress told us that they ran out of chicken which wasn't a big deal but it would have been nice to know when we got them not to order chicken! All I ordered was potato salad and coleslaw and that didn't even come out first. There was no manager walking around which was another red flag that customer service is not a priority in this restaurant.

2140531,2017-05-30,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Unfortunately, I'm going to have to lower my review of Pot Liquor after my visit here tonight. We had a large party for a birthday, so I understand that might be a bit troublesome, but the service really was lacking. We received water right away, but everything after that took forever- drink orders, appetizers being brought out, our dirty plates sitting there in front of us while we waited for our main courses.. it just got worse and worse. We had to ask our server, and other servers for items that our server forgot, and it started to become a bit frustrating.

That said, the food was overall okay. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table, and they were all tasty. The burnt ends were tender and the Texas toast and pickles it was served with were yummy. The wings were spicy, but meaty. The ribs were pretty good as well. 

Of the drinks, the soda was flat, and they actually have Kool Aid! Be prepared, it is SUPER sweet. If you're expecting it, you'll love it. If not, you may end up with a cavity! 

For our main courses, the food was decent, nothing special. Brisket could have been more tender, but the yams and Mac and cheese were good. Cornbread was delicious. The birthday boy ordered the oxtail ragu and it was tasteless- like literally had no taste! He sent it back and we just shared our meals with him. 

I will give them credit, although they took a LONG time getting our checks to us, they did separate it for people in the group and made it easy. So there's that. 

Maybe they were short staffed or having difficulties, but my experience at Pot Liquor tonight was pretty lackluster.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,2,0,3,h0Ii2KLaoNCSZK6NuDpjHA

2157903,2016-09-17,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I have been on a quest to try all the top BBQ places in Vegas and this is one I had yet to visit until yesterday. Went in for lunch with my coworkers. When I sat down, I thought I was going to be going with the $12 pulled pork sandwich but it turned into a $140 mega-feast among the 3 of us hungry men! 

Appetizer 1: We started off with the pork rinds. I never buy pork rinds and would never have ordered them. My amigo that was with us placed the order and I'm so glad he did. They were amazing. Best id ever had (to the tenth power). They came out of the kitchen crackling... Talk about fresh! Perfectly seasoned. If you think you would like pork rinds, you haven't tried them until you've had them there. 

Appetizer 2: Burnt ends. Absolutely delicious. Tender, perfect amount of fat, brown sugar rub that wasn't too sweet... I expect all BBQ joints to have these as their signature and Pot Liquor did it right. 

Entree: We shared a platter that included hot links, dry rubbed spare ribs, baby back ribs, pulled pork, half chicken, and got a side of sliced brisket. If I reviewed them all individually, this would turn into a short novel. What I can say is that everything was awesome with the exception of the sliced brisket. It was tender but dry. 

Five sauces were offered to us including one that we special ordered that was a habanero barbecue sauce. If you like some (actually a lot of) heat, that one was definitely the way to go. Also offered was a mayonnaise-based sauce for the chicken, vinegar-based, a ketchup based and a sweet baby rays like sauce. 

The service was as best as I've seen. We had Dana. She was incredibly personable and if I ever go back I will definitely request to sit at her table. She told us the story about their found the chef recently passing and how the culture among the work staff is beyond family like. 

There was another guy who ran the food to the table and he was just as great. Periodically check up on us and made sure we had exactly what we needed.

I'm not a beer guy but they had several craft beers that my friends enjoyed. 

This place isn't cheap but you will not be disappointed with your visit.

The grits were spot on the pork belly not nearly as tender as it should be. The service was mediocre, you could tell the waitresses were more concerned with socializing than refilling our beverages. Same as it goes for the owner more concerned with watching the sports game than noticing his bartender and servers throwing away pints of beer because they don't have the knowledge to allow it to sit or pour it at the proper temperature. It was Thursday at noon and the server informed us they were completely out of coffee. From that moment on our dining experience continued to let us down.

We made a reservation for 6pm since it was a Saturday night and based on what I heard I figured this place would be packed. Wrong! The place was empty. Our server was somewhat attentive but he seemed very preoccupied and out of it. I ordered the half a chicken with green beans and mac n' cheese. When it came out I was completely surprised to see that half of chicken was incredibly small (more like a cornish game hen). Also the corn muffin was about half a size of a real muffin (if you want extra they charge you $1.25). The sides were extremely good but the entire meal was definitely not worth the $18.99 charged. My friends ordered brisket and ribs. Both were good sizes and tasted good. While we were still in the middle of our meal (nowhere near finished) our waiter asked us if we wanted dessert (as if he was trying to rush us out, even though the place was empty). My friend wanted to order something else as we were still eating and not ready for dessert. Next thing we know we have our bills, even though we were once again still eating. My friend wanted to order some mac n cheese to go so the waiter took the bill back. We also asked to see a dessert menu (as we were finally done eating) and for some to go boxes. He brought over the dessert menu but we really didn't see anything we wanted (only a few things on it) plus we already had our checks. After that our waiter disappeared. We asked someone else to bring us wipes (since our waiter was nowhere to be found). We also had to ask for boxes several times.

The food is the best barbecue I've had in Las Vegas. The pot pie is different than I'm used to but so good. The chili is served on a huge piece of corn bread the size of a Thin cake. The Fried green tomatoes blew my mind, the greens have an amazing texture and slight sweet taste to them. But let's talk about ribs. They're all good but I fell in love with the dry rub. They're so good that I don't even want to dilute the taste with any of the bbq sauces they provide on the side. Definitely the best ribs I've ever had.

We arrived around 1pm, lunch time. We were actually planning on going to the yard house but there was no parking with all the construction and people that take up two spots so we had to park far away. This place was close to where we parked and there was a sign out front with a bunch of appetizers. It caught our eye so we went in. Two groups in front of us waiting to sit but not a server in sight to seat them. Finally the server came out and tried to sit all of us at once. I should've known right then that it was not going to be good.

First, we find out after sitting that the spotlight menu out front is happy hour. It wasn't happy hour. 

Server forgot to bring out the drink I ordered. I asked to cancel the drink when we were about to finish eating. He joked about it like I thought it was funny that he forgot. It wasn't.

The bus boy brought out a pile of pulled pork for the appetizer that we ordered. It was supposed to be the pulled pork and grits. It wasn't. 

The signature food item of this restaurant was the pulled pork. It wasn't. It was horribly dry. The grits were also like dry mashed potatoes.

For $30 dollars each and the server standing there looking for a tip after breaking a 20 for me, I will never come back to this place again.

2321516,2014-11-08,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Decided to try this place about 2 weeks ago with a big group of friends. We let the server know ahead of time we were are trying to catch a movie in about an hour and a half, plenty of time to order and enjoy the food. The server was nice enough to let us know that there was a 25 percent off special going on tuesdays. 

My boy friend and I ordered the deviled eggs and shared a combo plate. The deviled eggs were tasty with like these crunchy chicken things on top. The combo plate included two kinds of ribs, hot links, and choice of two sides. The mopped up ribs were really good and flavorful, whereas the dry rub were just ok. Hot links were good too. We chose mac and cheese and side of corn bread for our sides. The corn bread was absolutely fantastic. Mac and cheese was ehh. 

So why the 3 stars? Well our server and the rest of the staff just seemed to be in panic mode. Initially when he took our orders, it seemed like he was having a hard time using their tablet system. They kept forgetting to refill our drinks. One of our friends had lemonade and he came back with sweet tea and said ""Please tell me you like sweet tea, because we are out of lemonade."" He brought us to go boxes that were too small to fit those huge dry rub ribs. Then when it came time to pay it seemed to have even flustered them more. It was like a 30 minute ordeal to pay. 
And of course we were late for the movie. I wish they just had more of a sense of urgency.

The food was good and we will come back to give it another try.",Uav1HjC3_sZBt3-vN3s6ZA,0,0,3,yKbfodE5zfYcbXhaUk68Jw

Luckily for us it was Customer Appreciation Day at Pot Liquor. That gave us 25% off our meal. We lucked out since our meal ended up being about $30 for both of us.

My mom ordered a half rack of the ""mopped"" ribs with collard greens and the kale and cashew slaw. She said that the collard greens were sweet and not to her taste. She is used to more savory collard greens in Louisiana... usually cooked with smoked ham so I guess she wasn't prepared for them to be sweet. The only recommendation would be that they carry the tobasco peppers in a jar on the tables. This is a common condiment served with collard greens in the South.

She loved the slaw and commented that the ribs were some of the best she had ever had. They were very flavorful and tender. 

I also ordered the ribs and they were awesome! The fries came with ""Alabama White Sauce""--which seemed to be a vinegary mayo based sauce. I usually opt for ketchup with fries but I didn't need it since the white sauce was so good. I also had the mac & cheese which I personally liked. Keep in mind that it's homemade style and not like the crap in the blue box. TIP: mix it up well before you dive into it so the cheese gets mixed all around.

Overall, it was a great experience. The service was excellent. When our server, Paul, was busy, the manager on duty had no problem stepping in and refilling our drinks.

Here are the Lowlights of our 2 star experience at Pot Liquor. 

1. Slow Service. Note to Management: maybe 2 servers on the floor during lunch time and especially during Spring Break may be a good idea. Go ahead, don't be afraid... spend the extra $8.25 an hour. 

2. The server tried her best to keep herself upbeat bu when the hostess slnams you one after another, that frown stayed upside down. Note to Hostess: You have the power to let your server catch up in her tables by sharing with the brand new walk in customers it will be about 5 minutes until you can seat them. I bet they will be understanding and be happy to wait if that means THEY will have a better experience. 

3. Food ordered:  
- Corn Fritters: dense fried bread balls with a few corn kernels.
Best Corn Fritters: Hot and Juicy Crawfish. Amen.
- Deviled Eggs with Fried Chicken Skin: Pot Liquor meet Salt. Salt please show Pot Liquor what just a little bit of you can do. Or in this case, these deviled eggs needed lots of salt.
Best Deviled Eggs: the ones the the neighbor brings to the weekly playdate potluck. 
- Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich: if you like deep fried chicken breast that comes out of the fryer to just sit in the basket and at the same time sit in the oil... this dish is for you. the chicken breast soaked the bread with oil. I took one bite and immediately said... RETUUUURN THIS TO THE KITCHEN!
Best Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich: Lucille's Bbq. 
- Texas Brisket Dip Sandwich: Now this had potential but it needed to stand in line with the Deviled Eggs to meet Salt. 
Best Texas Brisket Dip: I dont know. This one was new for us.
- Kids Burger with fries for $5.98: thumbs up.
- Kids Corn Dogs with fruit salad: we'll stick to hot dog on a stick.

Drinks weren't refilled, our table wasn't prebussed, our kid fell asleep waiting for the food, the food runner did nothing to help. THIS PLACE SUCKS.",bmffQ_Auzx-ULXBo_YBlhw,3,0,1,vkc0KnWHNIMoP3FEcHsDrQ

The menu looks good but way overpriced, somewhat to expect for Townsquare but this is bad, however the orders were made for lunch, some sandwiches a burger etc.

Anyways, my family and I came in on a Sunday WITH reservations. Well I got there 30 minutes late and I was sitting there for awhile and we had to ask the busser to get our server lol. Awful. Did not ask if I wanted something to drink. Did not ask if I wanted to order. Just inattentive. Okay whatever.

So I ordered the sweet tea and the 8oz brisket with cornbread, Mac n cheese, and collard greens. The tea was great. Tasted freshly brewed and not overly sweet. The cornbread was good, flavorful, mildly sweet. Mac n cheese was BOMB tho. It was cheesy but like soft and cooked right. The greens weren't my cup of tea. I'm really picky about my greens and I like mine cooked in like a chicken broth so to speak. Their green were sour and spicy. No thanks. The brisket was cut into 3 pieces and it was little. Lol. For 20 bucks I get 3 strips of brisket? It's cool man. The sides probably made up the cost of the plate. Anyways. The brisket is mediocre. I think it was a little over cooked or something. It was pretty tough that I almost choked on it even after chewing 100 times. So that was that.

Meal over. We didn't get any refills. We didn't get any boxes. Mind you, it was looking like a complete ghost town in the restaurant. There was literally only 2 other tables besides us. Now I can totally understand if our server was also the cook, but the service definitely needs a big bit of adjustment.

2553550,2014-09-24,3,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Myself and a group of co-workers ate here yesterday for lunch. This review is based off the lunch menu and none of the BBQ entrees.

Basically, this place is still in their ""soft opening"". We were greeted by the owner who was very polite and gracious and even gave us his business cards so we could personally message him if needed.

The hostesses, our server, and the bajllion other people that came to our table to fill our drinks, clear silverware, etc, were all fantastic and really on top of their shit. Obviously, since they just opened everyone is going to try their best, but I have to hand it to the staff, they did a really phenomenal job.

So with that said, sadly, I was not quite a fan of the food here.

The appetizers we ordered were the chicken wings, baked blue crab, and the burnt ends. Everyone agreed the chicken wings were meh; good texture but lacking in flavor. The dipping sauce they were served with was nice I personally enjoyed the baked blue crab, it was my favorite thing I tried. The burnt ends were actually meaty pieces, but lacked flavors you would expect if the meat was actually being cooked all day as they claimed.

Again, I did not try any of the bbq meat entrees. All of us got something off the lunch menu, which is actually moderately priced for the amount of food you get. I ended up getting a chicken sandwich with a large portion of sweet potato fries. The chicken was bland (yeah I know, I got it grilled, but I expected a little more) and my sweet potato fries were cold when the plate was set down in front of me. This is also the kind of place where if you ask for a sauce, you get a tiny half filled metal cup. Slightly annoying, but not a big deal. 

My coworkers opininons were mixed, but the general consensus was that they could definitely do something to up the flavors. 2 of my coworkers got the pulled pork sandwich, which did not come with sauce and didn't really have much flavor. The meals people got around us all looked tasty (the BBQ entrees/sides), which is a reason a few of us would want to go back. 

It's a nice little place to get BBQ if you happen to be in Town Square. The lunch menu is worth giving a try. I may go back in a month or so to try something else off their menu.",mloua2rXvKQuayyY9KqEhg,1,1,3,oJ-KwsM19k8EMjJUBaAqKg

2562566,2015-01-05,4,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Pretty happy with my first meal of the year in 2015. The family and I decided to hit up the new Town Square BBQ joint called Pot Liquor. I was thrilled when there wasn't a huge crowd for the holiday. It smelled delicious upon entry, and my expectations were pretty high. 
There was a beautiful chandelier made from musical instruments that was a perfect decor for the atmosphere they were going for. Jazzy, blues, Bbq, bar yet family style type of place. The staff was friendly, and seemed to already have regular customers as they recognized numerous guests. 
My family ordered three appetizers; pork rinds, deviled eggs, and burnt ends. The deviled eggs came with a chicken skin crisp crumble over the top and added a spectacular crunch. The pork rinds were basic but good. And the burnt ends were the first thing gone on the table. We were also presented a sauce sampler with four different styles of sauce to pair with your meat. The first, a sweet classic barbeque sauce. The second was similar to the first, but more spicy than sweet. I would have preferred more spice actually. The third was a cider vinegar they suggest you try with pork. I enjoyed it, the vinegar was not too overwhelming. And then my personal favorite, the white sauce. They describe this as, mayo, horseradish, and seasonings. Don't pass up on the random white sauce, its freakin' great! 
For our entree we went with a Lord Have Mercy platter. The waitress insisted that with all this meat, between the four of us, we would most likely have leftovers. (Note: myself, my bf, our kids ages 17 & 12) The entree included:  1/2 smoked chicken, 6 baby back ribs, 6 dry rubbed spareribs, Carolina pulled pork, 4 Louisiana hot links and three sides. Let's just say, we were stuffed, yet our waitress was indeed impressed. Everything had a real smoked flavor. No shortcuts used with this BBQ. 
I also got an order of the breakfast brisket hash, because for $20 it came with unlimited Bloody Mary's, so that was a deal in itself! This is usually a weekend brunch special, but they were offering it because of the holiday. The bloody was great, I had 3 of them, and was feeling it towards the end. 
Don't ask me how we ate dessert, but we did. I felt like a family of food critics trying everything on the menu, the kids did great. We had the deep fried banana split (huge and awesome) and the strawberry shortcake sandwiches. Just get those, don't even ask, just do it. 
During our meal, the general manager Francis stopped by our table to ensure satisfaction. Although he was a Cowboys fan, we set aside our football differences and he gave us a coupon for 10% off, that we were able to use that day. The waitress even let us keep the coupon, which is cool because we totally will be returning to this place.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,12,7,5,qrOxBDzh3GDnWVxomYqnDQ

I don't know if it was because we were African American or what, but we were the only black people in there. To put the topping on the cake they served us raw bloody chicken and didn't even offer to replace it. They just wanted to take it back and cook it more.

First time here and we were very pleased with the place. Cute theming and their service was friendly. They were attentitive the entire time.

We ordered the Kansas City Style Burnt Ends-Beef brisket point, maple bark, 'cue #1, pullman loaf, nbc pickles for an appetizer. ($10.98) It was burnt but as a girl who loves her steak well done, I wish it was burnt a little bit more. Any slight hint of red meat I see...I cringe. But all in all, still very very delicious, tender, and flavorful. Would def order again, maybe even as an entree next time.

For my entree, I ordered the Worcestershire Braised Beef Short Rib-Charred green onions, crispy fingerling potatoes ($18.98). It was alright...wasn't very memorable. Kind of bland to me...and def didn't have that BBQ flavoring I was hoping for. Would NOT get this again next time. (see pic attached.)

But what my boyfriend ordered was...WOW WOW WOW!!! He got the 8 oz. Carolina Pulled Pork with two sides ($17.98). That meat...damn. It was pippin hot, fresh, tender and juicy. Full of BBQ flavor!!! The two sides were great too. He ordered the Kale and Cashew Slaw and Hoppin John, which is like dirty cajun-rice with black beans. I would order those sides as entrees too.

Our server recommended sharing dinner off of the Combination section, so we went with the chicken and baby back ribs accompanied by mac and cheese and hoppin' john - which, again, came out super fast.

The baby back ribs had a great taste and plenty of meat on the bone, but weren't quite as fall-off-the-bone tender as I've had in other places. The apps and sides were basic and as-ordered, but could use a bit more imagination when it comes to seasoning and flavor. The service was excellent - informative and fast.

Pot Liquor CAS is located just down the way from Yard House and right next to valet at Town Square. There wasn't a wait and we were greeted and seated immediately.

The decor is really cool, upscale casual type vibe. Cloth napkins on the lovely dark wood tables.

We had two back servers greet us at our table, one with a glass bottle of water. Our main server was Kristen B. and she was a complete delight! Very bubbly and energetic with a cute accent.

We ordered the Beef with the Chicken and the Hog, sides of corn muffins (for me) and french fries with White Sauce (for the husband).

The wait was about 20 minutes or so for our food but once that platter of deliciousness was brought to us, the wait didn't matter.

Corn muffins were yummy with a warm honey butter served on the side. French fries had a good seasoning on them and went well with the white sauce.

The brisket was incredible! So tender and juicy! I wished there had been more on our platter!

The chicken had a great sear, juicy and flavorful. And what a nice surprise to have the chicken served as an airline breast! (Boneless breast with drumette bone attached) When does one ever see that in a barbecue place?

And then there was the pork. The Carolina Pulled Pork. WOW!! The smoke flavor in that pork was just amazing!! I want to go back for lunch just to have that pork in a sandwich.

Our platter came with a few sauces, Cue #2 which had a great kick, the vinegar based one which I loved and the white, mayo based sauce.

I personally liked the kick of 'cue #2 mixed with the vinegar base of the other :)

We enjoyed our meal and will return again.

This whole ""your section"" ""my section"" game is completely ridiculous when you see several tables not being helped and then admit to it.  

I had the pulled pork and waffles, it was really good and a nice change to the typical chicken and waffle.  I like the bottomless mac and cheese for the kids because that's currently the only food group my kids will eat.

The head host did give us a complimentary drink ticket for the wait.  And I do have to compliment the busser who was pouring water for everyone that morning.

We're new to town and enjoy the ambiance of the Town Square shopping center, so the BF and I decided to check out Pot Liquor.  He loves BBQ, and this seemed like a great place to grab dinner.  We made an Open Table reservation, but it wasn't so busy for a Friday night at 7. 

First the good...
- Ambiance is very cute.  Mason jars, and interesting pig paintings adorn the walls with lots of atmospheric impact.
- Drink list is extensive and delicious... I had a cucumber concoction and it was perfect... not too sweet, not too rancid, but just right ;).  They have a number of beers on tap, and a fair selection of hard alcohol.

Now the bad...
- Service was strange.  Our waiter was competent, but not very friendly.  He seemed rather tired, and was responsible for a lot of tables.  So, I can't really blame him for that... but it did negatively affect our visit. 
- The food took a LONG time to arrive.  I consider myself a rather patient person, but I think 45 minutes for an entree is a LONG time...  

Finally, the GREAT...
- Ribs were probably the best I've ever had.  They weren't super juicy and fall off the bone, but the flavor was magnificent.  It was the perfect combination of smoky-sweet-savory that is surprisingly redeeming after waiting 45 minutes for an entree.  Portions are generous, but I almost think that's a given with BBQ.
- Chicken Pot Pie: I reluctantly ordered this after being let down by many chicken pot pies in the past, and was PLEASANTLY surprised.  The chicken was tender, juicy, and FLAVORFUL.  Also highly redeeming after a long wait.

Maybe we caught them on an off day service-wise, or something, but we'll definitely be back for another visit.",CkH69yFBvm4dPDeKNzIjYw,0,1,4,k8jUqBGzHN7z9Lxahi5mDQ

The pork belly with grits are the best of each of those I have ever had. The deviled eggs were delicious. The dry rub spare ribs are an absolute MUST ORDER! Oh my goodness. Those slow smoked ribs blew my mind. Also the best I have ever had in my life! The spicy Louisiana hot links were wonderful as was the brisket. The corn bread with sweet honey butter was absurd. I could have eaten that all day. The collard greens in pot liquor were wonderful. The Mac and cheese was delicious, but had trouble in comparison to the ridiculously good corn bread. My whole group was in utter food nirvana. 

They have an extensive beer, whiskey, and bourbon list was pairs beautifully with the food and the decor. This would be a great place for large parties along with a couple wanting a little piece of gorgeous nostalgia.

We ordered an appetizer and shared one of the combo meals and also a few sides. The food was pretty good. I think some of their items were a little dry. The portion size was a little on the small side. One thing we noticed was that the bar is not set up very well. They have the bottles set up in a way that makes it very difficult to see what they carry. It just isn't very esthetically pleasing or neat looking. They have see thru glass coolers which is something they should think about changing. It makes sense that they want to showcase their beer selection but the other side is just unpleasant to the eye. I know they do a lot of craft cocktails but you can see all containers and mixers just shoved inside. They had this big tupperware container with what looked like sangria with plastic wrap over the top. The white wine bottles were all on one side and didn't appear to have any type of organization. These are the kind of things I look at as a customer and really are things I don't want to see unless it is super organized. Liquor selection seemed very random. On another note, the service was excellent. The bartender was very nice. He was very hospitable and he always checked on us. Food came out fast.

I would definitely go back! Although maybe not for lunch. The food took a long time to show up, even though as I said...maybe worth the wait? From sitting to ordering to getting our food was 45 minutes. On a regular lunch break, it is too long for me.

Luckily this was a ""work lunch"" so a long lunch we could all get away with.
And thankfully it was a ""work is treating lunch"" because they have one menu for lunch and dinner. My 1/2 order of ribs was $18, which is a little bit rich for my lunch budget. Wish they had a cheaper lunch menu, might reconsider. Although I did see a couple lunch sandwiches in the corner of the menu. But I mean a smaller portion, less than $10 lunch menu.

Good Lawd - Pot Liquor makes some great food. I came here with a co-worker who is not a foodie snob, but has very a seasoned palate. So it can be daunting to try and impress this guy. 

We here came after a meeting for lunch, which was also my first time here, and I was taken back by the decor. It's great to see a place with such character surrounded by a location with a giant stale corpo feel. I'm looking at you Town Square. 

We were sat and ordered immediately. Burnt ends and deviled eggs for the table and for me, The Texas Dip. Nope, this isn't a blonde bombshell with an I.Q. of 67, but huge meaty sandwich. This comes with hand sliced brisket, pepper jack cheese, cue #4 (spice level sauce), and BBQ au jus. Yes, there's a thing called BBQ Au Jus and it's drink worthy.

The Burnt Ends seem to be made from some type of magical animal. These little chunks of meaty heaven are tender, juicy, and should be served in a bowl with sauce and a oversized spoon for easy consumption. I would also sprinkle these on a steak or my cornflakes if I felt the need for a hardy protein addition during breakfast. 

The deviled eggs were very good. I mean they're the cornerstone of any good BBQ meal or July 4th block party. They had great flavor and a even better texture, with the chicken cracklings placed on top. Great dish to order with a large group, but not for a party of two, they were very filling. 

My main dish, The Texas Dip, was a flavor filled pile of meat that I openly made sweet love to as I ate. This beast was delicious, with piles tasty brisket slices covered in house made BBQ sauce, spicy cheese, all on a soft hoagie style roll. With the meats, cheeses, and sauces in between two pieces carby happiness, you might ask yourself, ""what could make this better?"". How dipping it in some savory au jus sauces. Food Boner level - ""FULL ERECTION"". Simply amazing!

We ordered the baby back ribs and Texas beef brisket with sides of collard greens, green beans, mac and cheese and something called Hoppin John.

The sides were outrageously delicious. A little pepper vinegar on the collards, mmm. Greens beans with garlic and mac and cheese wow. The biggest treat and surprise was the Hoppin John. My gal commented to me she thought the mac and cheese would be better than the rice stuff (Hoppin John). I took a bite and holy mackeral, the flavor and textures were mind blowing. It handed it to Lori and she tried it, she said that the best thing she's eaten in a barbeque place.

Nancy is friendly and knowledgeable. In fact during the dinner she stopped and checked on us several times and we spoke about the recipe for Hoppin John. She said she'd gone online and researched it. A recipe of the South and a traditional New Year's dish. You have got to try the Hoppin John.

No barbeque dinner is complete without dessert, there are only two desserts thou should ever serve, Peach cobbler or when from South Florida Key lime pie. Potliqour BBQ serves a Key lime pie in a jar, described as a deconstructed Key lime pie. This treat is served in a pint sized mason jar with locking lid, no you don't get to take it home, we asked. Delicious is a weak word to describe this dessert.

Service was excellent, love Nancy she's great. The ribs and brisket were tasty. But it's the side that will keep you coming back.

I think that their BBQ is awesome, so when I saw they were doing a Thanksgiving special we decided to try it out.  We made an early appointment hoping to get in and out before it got too busy.  It is a good thing we did.  As it was, the service was the worst I have experienced either there or anywhere else in a long time.  Our waiter came by as we were sitting down and before we could even sit, asked us what we wanted to drink.  We placed an order and went on up to the buffet line they had set up for Thanksgiving dinner.  The brisket and ribs were excellent, but the turkey was pretty dry.  The sides were excellent, especially the dressing. 

But back to the service;  We did not see our server again.  He left the dirty plates on the table as he passed by, he left the water glasses empty as he passed by and while we were still eating, he brought the check and was ready to set it down on the table when I asked him about desert.  He held on to the mini clipboard with the check and told us he would get a couple of deserts for us out of the kitchen and left.  Another waiter overheard him and stopped by to tell us the bread pudding was still in the oven and would be about ten minutes.  The other waiter brought us the bread pudding when it was ready and our waiter stopped by again while we were eating desert to leave us the check.  

I will come back again because the food is excellent, but I hope management sets a few standards for their wait staff before they unleash them on the guests.",zgoGa25w9KVdUkbqUKiZrA,0,0,3,EKwzzxkk2qe7YvU_4P72dg

It was perfect timing between the lunch and dinner rush when the place was humming but mostly empty. Turns out tuesdays kids eat free, which was freaking amazing, unexpected, and a huge bonus deal because I brought three.  ; )

I had the brisket burger, because of an insatiable brisket craving I've been having lately, but it took almost 20 minutes just to decide because everything looked so amazing. Wife had the half rack of dry rubbed spare ribs which looked like they were out of the flintstones. Kids had bottomless mac, chicken fingers, and ribs.. $20 worth of food on the house.

Couple of beers and three fingers of The Glenlivet later and we had the warm glow that accompanies a very enjoyable barbecue dining experience. Wes was great serving us and rounded out our night. We will definitely be back to try all of the items that we didn't get to order tonight, hopefully soon.

Cute southern style decor with very open windows. Very open spaced and modern and clean.
 They have large variety of whiskeys which is kool.
Wanted to grab a quick bite and was craving some southern food. 
Got a couple things I usually get at a bbq place... for this place I ordered...

K.C. BURNT ENDS - omg... it was very dry and really no flavor. Came with some bbq sauce and two 1/2 sliced bread and some cucumber. I was super horrified when I took the first bite.

CORN BREAD- honestly if you mess up corn bread.. feel like you shouldn't be in business.. corn bread was just normal and it came with some sauce that looked like apple sauce but i think it was like sweet butter

SIDE OF GRITZ- was amazing though ahahha it was full of flavor and cheesy but a little salty.

I tried to take the burnt ends and eat it with the grits hoping it would be more tender but after the second bite I just lost my appetite. I was really disappointed with the outcome of this place and not so many places could turn me off... the reviews seems pretty good so i came through but BLAHHHH O_o 

Maybe I will try again wayyy laterrrr in the year when I forget about this experience. Will have to dine in that time... maybe it will be different...

Service was quick and good though! Was in and out in less than 15 minutes for a takeout order =]

3202609,2016-03-29,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I really had high expectations based upon reviews.

We had reservations for an early dinner on a Monday night, we had a larger group.  Our group was greeted immediately, however they had not yet set up our table.  I thought that was a bit weird given the place was practically empty, however I am sure they were guarding against a no show. The hostesses were friendly, but I could tell they were a bit confused and UN decisive about where to put our group.

Once we were seated it took a bit before our waitress came over.  Once she came over she seamed a bit confused and disoriented.  After explaining the menu we she let us have some time and then came back and took our drink orders.  Then the waiting really started.  It took a long time to get our drinks and then even longer for her to take our order.  By this time other groups were starting to be sat around us.

The waitress visited us once while we waited for our food.  Our drinks had run dry and we had to wait until after our food arrived to get refills.  Our drinks should not have run dry, we had iced tea and lemonade for the most part and those are easy to refill.

We had ordered 2 of their ""Lord has Mercy"" combo platters to feed the group.  The presentation was nice with an assortment of BBQ sauces and the sides were displayed nicely.  The Mac n Cheese stood out and that was the best of the sides we ordered (Cornbread and Grilled Corn Succotash were the others)  The Grilled Corn Succotash was very plain an not cooked correctly (the garbanzo beans were way undercooked).  

The BBQ was average.  The babybacks were tender without much flavor, The spare ribs had good flavor, but the doneness was hit or miss on the same plate, the pulled pork was disappointing as it was way too saucy and mushy, and the hot links had ok flavor, but did not impart any sort of heat.

We were not visited again by our waitress and our drinks ran dry again.  We waited forever for our bill, we got the wrong table's bill and had to wait forever again to get the correct one.  Once she had my credit card we waited again. 5:15 reservation we walked out at 7:15... We were not there having a ton of beverages, telling stories, and having a crazy time.  We just were having a normal family meal, should have taken 1-1.5 hours tops.

I was watching the waitress when she was not at our table as I was curious as to what was taking her so long.  She had WAY too many tables... This is a management issue not waitress issues.  Her having that many tables was causing her to be rushed, flustered, and out of a pattern and rhythm.  She could not establish a normal circulation.  With our large group and another large group sat next to us she should not had 3-4 other tables on top of that.  Also, it is the managements responsibility to make sure the hostesses know how to properly do their job and train them well so that they are not so ambiguous running the front.

I might give this place another try with my wife and try some of their small plates and appetizers, but as for good Q, I say eh.",BbtzSa8XVrGaE5vFsbKGLg,2,0,2,v-DjkliLFxZ7HDy2Nksj6A

Stopped in for dinner before a movie with the kids and gf.  It wasn't very full and seemed like it wasn't very busy as we got a seat right away.  15 minutes later we were still sitting there waiting.  Not even acknowledged at this point.  So we ask the hostess to let our server know we were here so they could at lease get us some water.   She returns with water (not our server).  At this point the family sitting next to us leans over and tells us to ""make sure you order your drinks and food all together once your server gets here because you'll never see him again""

Makes me feel awesome right? 5 minutes or so later server shows up.  Now I'm very understanding when a place gets busy, or is short handed.  I'll give any place the benefit of the doubt, but when server showed up he doesn't offer an apology, or explanation, and quickly asks what we want and speaks to us as if we've been friends for years.  

Ribs were pretty damn good.  Good smoke flavor, very tender.  All the sides were mediocre at best.  Sweet tea tasted off.  We managed to get the tea switched to water quickly...but did not receive any refills (or offer to refill) at any point in the meal until we were ready to leave.  

A gentleman who we assumed was the manager ended up getting our bill for us. He was very polite.  So for him and the ribs I'll give 2 stars. 

Good ribs, I'm sure some of the other meats are good, but the service is definitely lacking.  Not worth a second shot with better BBQ places in Vegas.",0JNsF7NCKMtjgwYj3fgcoQ,0,0,2,PLv9udo2m05ghTjeXjis_A

Chef Doug, Flip, Francis, David, Drey, Hugo, Ernesto, Rachel, Amy, Paul, Jim everyone from the windows to the walls make this place not just a restaurant. It is a living, moving thing.

OR the Chicken Fried Steak. AND THE PULLED PORK WAFFLE. Fluffy pillow of a waffle, heaped with Pot Liquor Pulled Pork (which is nuts), and Spiced Apple compote, with Double barrel aged bourbon syrup. That's brunch.
Lunch, Sunday Chicken Sandwich with the largest chicken breast you've ever seen, fresh veggies, baked bun and melted slab of cheddar. Add a side of sweet potato fries and Alabama white sauce. Insanely good. Everything for dinner is good. Dry rubbed St Louis Style Spare ribs, huge and meaty, add the spicy bbq sauce. Mopped baby backs, fall off the bone with a glance. Smoked Chicken is smoked and flavored to the bone. The brisket, trimmed and rendered for hours in it's own meaty goodness. The boudin noir and griled prawn salad with citrus vinaigrette, deep fried freen tomatoes, pork cracklin and add the carolina vinegar sauce. Deviled eggs with fried chicken skins. Moinks. Meatballs wrapped in in-house cured bacon. Cornbread muffins with whipped honey butter, collared green that take hours and hours to make. Chefs Doug and Ernesto know how do do proper barbecue and the crew at Pot Liquor know how to make people happy.

Ambiance - I feel like they are trying to make it a gastropub BBQ joint. It definitely is unique. The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly.

Food - I ordered the Texas Dip when I went there for lunch. The beef was tender and juicy, but the sandwich was loaded with a cream. I think it was mayo, which I was not a fan of. I feel like it ruined the sandwich. However, the fries were scrumptious. I would definitely go back for those. They were crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. I had the chicken pot pie when I went there for dinner. It was okay, nothing special.

We sat at the bar to place the to-go order. We waited a while for someone to approach us. It may have not been that long, like 5 mins, but when your waiting it feels like a long time. 

I ordered the go hog wild combo that came with ribs, baby back, sausage and pulled pork. I traded out the pulled pork for brisket, which was a $4 upcharge. 

The meats were good, pretty sure it would have been better if we had dined in. 

I give 2 stars for the wait which really sets the tone of the experience considering they were not busy at all, especially at the bar.

I didn't want to drink the bottomless option so I asked for a hot tea. I mean, who doesn't have hot tea? Them. Or hot chocolate. I don't drink coffee, so I settled for OJ. I also asked for a side of toast and she recommended against it because apparently they burnt it on the last attempt. I wanted to make sure I wasn't just looking for things to be wrong so I gave them the benefit. 

30 minutes later when our food still wasn't up, but a neighbouring table who was sat after us had food, I asked the food runner to check for us.They apparently had issues with the POS system so our food didn't go through. Another table of four said they had similar issues with the service. 

The food itself was great.  Bartender was great. Server was just not good. However, the Chef came out and apologized for the experience and gave us a 20% discount.  So because of the Chef, the bartender and the actual food, I am giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2. However,  doubt we will be back unfortunately.",oolg6vphb-ZLF_BiEHawNQ,0,0,3,5tKT8hTtS2ASta_fKrYnBg

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming and artistic with a down home feel.  The staff of the restaurant welcomed me as soon as I came into the door and continued to make me feel as though I was part of their family throughout my entire experience. 

I was recommended a few appetizers to try which greatly helped me narrow down my choices, as everything sounded delicious. I ended up choosing the moinks and was not disappointed. I'm officially addicted to those things! The ribs are spot on and the  pulled pork is to die for.

What I also loved is that they actually give you a half rack of ribs. In most other BBQ joints, a half rack means 3 or 4 ribs. Um, no? We're not stupid. We can do math. And we know there are normally 12 ribs in a rack. We also know that half of 12 is 6. So thank you Pot Liquor for not insulting our intelligence.

By the way the ribs are great. But a bunch of meat and membrane got stuck in my teeth. Not sure what that was about...but still great flavor and good sauce.",Geh5WtRKHcX8OymVr9dHMw,3,1,4,vbM0LcJAVrOGARpTLrk8Wg

The reviews were amazing so we were hyped about it. they open at 11 AM. we got there at 11:10 AM to locked doors. That should have been the first sign we were about to have a terrible experience. Then the server who opened the door, said ""Sorry, the lights are off, we don't have lights yet because our manager isn't here yet."" We decided to go in anyway. The lights weren't turned on until almost 12 pm. 
We placed our orders: wings and waffles and biscuits and gravy. 10-15 minutes later, the waitress came back and said, ""Sorry, we don't have wings."" we almost left at that point but we decided biscuits and gravy will be good so we'll wait it out. Then, as we waited for our meal, the waitress comes back again and said ""I'm so sorry but we don't have gravy."" We looked over the menu again to reorder something else. I decided to go for bacon steak and eggs. Guess what though?? The waitress came back and said sorry we don't have bacon at this time. 
We literally went to this place for Saturday at 11 AM and they were out of everything!! The food that they did bring included: waffles, biscuits and hash. Everything was tasteless, overcooked and lukewarm. 
We saw the manager and before I could talk to him, he walked out of the restaurant and drove away in his Beamer. We were livid. 
Our waitress was patient and understand and only charged us for a couple items. our alcohol was free, which was necessary because the second ""unlimited bloody mary"" tasted terrible. The bar tender was covering tables as well as the bar, so that was understandable.

The sliders we tasty and I know sliders are small but they couldn't have found a smaller bun if they had tried, but the flavor was right on the money with that.

Second was the price, I understand that you most likely have a high over head but if you are going to charge prices you do you need to make sure there is enough food on the plate to warrant it.

Last is the mixed drink. If you are going to have such a large menu of Whisky you really should know the proper was to make whisky drinks. You also need to make sure everyone's drinks are full and by full I don't mean full of ICE. I ordered an old fashion the flavor was off the glass was over flowing with ice and still the level of my drink was half the glass. I understand there are proper amounts that need to be mixed together to make the drink the right way but when done right with the proper amount of ice it should still be over half the glass.

- 1 star for friendly staff.

My boyfriend and I came on an early Friday night and it wasn't too busy yet. It took an extremely long time until our server finally greeted us after being seated (15 min). There wasn't too much selection on the dinner menu and when we saw something we liked from the lunch menu we were told we couldn't order it because the kitchen put away all the stuff needed to make those dishes :( So we ended up ordering appetizers and the food was alright. Chicken wings with mac and cheese was what I got and my boyfriend got the pulled pork sliders with cornbread, he wasn't impressed with either dishes.

The tables next to us were extremely irritated with how long our server took to give them their checks, napkins, or even pay any attention to them! Our server claims she had a large table that was keeping her from going to our tables which is understandable but then this is where the manager needs to step in and help. He literally came to all our tables when it was too late and when we had to flag down bussers and other servers for things we needed. Although the staff was really friendly they were just too slow and there were so many times where we wanted to just walk out and see if they would even notice.

It's been open for a while now and I had hoped that they would have perfected their craft in that span. The menu sounds so good. I love the concept of a modern smokehouse. There's so much potential for merging traditional dishes with a modern twist no Southern fare and at least with the pork belly and country grits they succeed. With the pork's well caramelized, crispy exterior, rendered fat underneath, and tender meat below that, it's an excellent dish that balances sweet and savory extremely well.

Unfortunately, the other stuff I tried wasn't as good. The mopped baby back ribs were not good at all. I liked the tangy sauce with hints of sweetness but the meat was anything but tender, as if they were cooked much earlier in the day and reheated for my order. I also wasn't a fan of the cake-textured cornbread. The kale and cashew slaw was the lone saving grace to an otherwise awful platter.

3567924,2015-06-01,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"When you think of Las Vegas dining you think celebrity chefs, steak houses and buffets. The one thing you may not be thinking about in the middle of the desert is southern barbecue; but if you are, you should be thinking Pot Liquor Contemporary American Smokehouse.

ATMOSPHERE: 5 out of 5

As soon as you walk into the restaurant you know you're in a smokehouse. Aside from the aroma of burning wood lofting throughout the dining room, the hardwood pub height tables, the mason-jar chandler and the wall painting of a pig let you know that you are not at Joël Robuchon. 

FOOD: 4 out of 5

I looked at this menu for days, everything that you can think of when your think southern BBQ is on it: Pork Belly Grits, House Made Pork Rinds, Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork... it's the Disney World of barbecue. On the back of the menu there was an extensive bar menu which included a rather impressive bourbon selection.  There were so many options that I was undecided right up until our server took my order and what I really wanted wasn't listed on the menu; however he allowed me to substitute. I ordered Beef Brisket, Memphis Style Ribs, Signature Collard Greens and Corn Bread. I will preface with I enjoyed the food and I would certainly return, however I did have a few highs and lows when it came to food quality. 

As I mentioned the food was really good, Memphis Style Ribs were by far the highlight of what I had ordered. There was just the right amount of smoke and the meat was tender giving just enough chew to pull off the bone; they were delicious. The brisket however fell a little short and was dry. The smoke and flavors were good, perhaps brining them prior to smoking would help it retain moisture.  I enjoyed the collard greens, however from a personal standpoint I would have liked a little more heat and some acidity in the dish. The cornbread was perfect, it had great flavor and wasn't too heavy. It was flakey and light - the only suggestion I could make it that cornbread is always better with pieces of corn in it. 


SERVICE: 4 out of 5

Our server was Paulie. I am guessing Paulie wasn't born in Nevada as his accent has a slight (that's sarcasm) touch of New York in there. He was quick to recognize the table, personable and went above and beyond to assist the group.  He even gave me a quick tour of the kitchen and introduced me to the owners before I left. 

One of the things that impressed me with Paulie was that if he didn't know the answer to your question, he quickly found an answer for you.  The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars for service is because with a table of 20, Paulie should have had another server with him to assist guests. From a business standpoint this could have increased liquor sales improving profitability and from a customer's view its extra attention and increased service. 


PRICE:  4 out of 5

In comparison to many of the other restaurants in the area and considering the portion sizes, this is a very affordable location.  Taking a closer look at the menu, I would even say for what you are getting, the menu is priced just right. 

I didn't give them 5 stars because of the market price on some of the specialty drinks. Let's face it, this is Vegas and things aren't what they used to be out here. However $89 for a pour of Orphan Barrel ""Forged Oak"" exceeds the price I paid for the entire bottle ($80). That kind of markup is too pricy, even for Vegas. 


OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4 out of 5

Truth be known, even with the couple negatives I experienced, I was a kid in a candy store. This is exactly the kind of experience I was anticipating and the Pot Liquor CAS lived up to my picky pallet. I would love to see something like this in my home state, although if it were in my home town I would weigh 400 pounds.  I wish them much success and next time I am in Vegas, they will see me again.",rG-gVq26S4rJCiG8Lk4T-g,1,0,4,BJ8Ul6bqQRNWrKDodUBafw

They have a great beer menu, with 2 taps designated for local breweries, which is awesome. I'm not a whiskey drinker, but their whiskey menu seemed pretty extensive. 

We went on a Sunday, and they offer a brunch menu, which includes bottomless mimosas, Bloody Mary, or Bellini's. My hubby opted for the chicken fried steak off of the brunch menu - which he LOVED. So many places use frozen chicken fried steaks, that it's really difficult to get a truly enjoyable CFS, but this is NOT the case here. The steak was fresh, as were the biscuits, gravy and mashed potatoes. It's the first time he has enjoyed a CFS in a REALLY long time. 

I got the mopped baby back ribs, collard greens, and corn bread. The ribs were tasty and tender, but there was a little too much rosemary in the sauce for me to truly love them. The collard greens were on point, as were the cornbread and FRESH honey butter. 

My son got the pulled pork waffle, which is a Belgian waffle with a big pile of pulled pork on top of it. The meat was very moist, and the waffle was nice and crispy.

First off, it's pretty big and I've never seen it more than 1/4 full, so that would seem to bode well for service, but service has been hit and miss.  The last time I was there the server (I can't seem to remember his name) was pretty cheery, but very absent at the end of the meal.  He said he'd bring a drink refill for my fiancee and it took about 15 minutes to get it, and another few minutes for the check.  We were also overcharged for a side dish, but weren't going to wait another 10+ minutes to get it fixed.

The food is all slightly above average, but is priced a bit too high.  I feel like everything should cost about 25% less than it really is.

I haven't written a review of it yet, but I really like Bell's BBQ in Henderson.  Good prices, big amounts, and tastes a lot better than this place.  If you're up in the northwest side of town try the Roadkill Grill -- that's also very good and reasonably priced as well.

My husband and I have now tried this place for the 5th time since they opened (because we actually do really like the food) but after yet another frustrating experience, I'm sad to say we will not be going back, nor will we be recommending this restaurant to others any longer. 

During our most recent visit, we came by for a late lunch. There were only 3 other tables of guests in the restaurant, which I attributed mostly to it being an off-time of day, but I couldn't help but thinking others may have had similar experiences to ours in the past and decided to go elsewhere (proven by the packed Yard House we passed on our walk to Pot Liquor). Regardless, we really do love the food so we were excited to give the spot another try, which I soon regretted.

We arrived 15 minutes before their lunch specials expired (at 3pm) but it was impossible to get any attention from employees who continually walked right past us. Finally, my husband walked back up to the hostess stand to ask if there was a server assigned to our area. (The place is HUGE and actually really nice which just makes their lack of customer appreciation even sadder). She pointed to the gal who had walked passed us a few times without so much as a hello or eye contact and said she'd send her right over. In the meantime, my husband decided to order us 2 drinks from the bar himself, which were made and on their way over to us by the time the server made her 1st appearance. Here's where things get FUN. 

We said we knew what we wanted to order right away, however, when I asked for the Pulled Pork sandwich, she informed me that the lunch menu ended at 3pm so I'd have to either order the pulled pork sliders, or the pulled pork dinner (since it was now 3:06pm). I pointed out to her that we'd been there waiting for quite awhile, and since the ingredients for the meal I was ordering are the same as the others, I was hoping she could ask the kitchen (or the manager, or whoever) if they could make an exception (a 6-minute exception) as I'd prefer the sandwich. She refused, said it wasn't possible, and that I'd have to pick something else. My husband was STARVING by this point so instead of walking out like I wanted to, we quickly picked other items from the dinner menu and decided to try to make the best of it. 

Unfortunately, things only got worse as we sat waiting for our food with empty glasses of their yummy alcoholic lemonades (that they easily could have sold us many more of if our server had bothered to come back and offer us another round) and since a food runner was the one who dropped off our meals (or maybe it was another server who didn't bother to ask if we needed anything, like maybe something to wash our food down with) my husband walked up to the bar yet again to ask for a refill on the bottle of water she left on the table for us (by this point I decided we would not be spending one more dollar at this place). 

We didn't see our server again until I flagged her down to bring us our check. As we walked out discussing where we should head to next to have a few cocktails since Pot Liquor definitely wasn't interested in our business, I noticed that one of the three other tables in the restaurant was occupied by what looked to be restaurant management, none of whom had walked over to our table or the other guest table to say hello, thank us for coming in, ask how our experience was, or even notice that the 2 tables of customers in their otherwise empty restaurant were receiving zero attention. Instead they were busy chatting and laughing and working on budgets or menus or some other plans that obviously were missing the main business point they needed to be working on = customer satisfaction and retention.",JQwm9iV-Pq587_9F32PSkQ,2,0,2,CinA3x0gXMuaInrb20AiEg

Not that the food was bad...just that it wasn't southern by any stretch of the imagination. I lived in the south for a lot of years and appreciate the many varieties of southern cooking. This is not any of them. 

The Mac and cheese is very dry, not creamy or cheesy. The chicken was good, but not served with barbecue sauce?  The chili was good but nothing special or southern happening there either. The Pork Sliders were very good...nice rolls with good slaw, but very little barbecue sauce. Nothing to compare to real North Carolina / South Carolina / Texas barbecue.

Smoked 1/2 Chicken- Chicken was small, must have been cooked in an electric wet smoker, had no bark on the skin but was moist and had a smokey flavor. Looked like poached chicken. 3 1/2 stars (see pic)
Collards- Way too sweet for my liking but cooked perfectly. 3 stars
Hoppin John- Rice was mush, like a bad fried rice with black eyed peas and bacon. 2 stars
Muffin-Best thing in the box. 4 stars

Service far from memorable. The host was not inviting - too casual and doing her business I guess. She seemed to be busy enjoying her cup of Starbucks on Saturday afternoon.  Our server with very dry attitude. Never suggested any specials whatsoever. 
The cob salad too small for $15.50 considering that some of the spinach were not fresh.  I asked to add the blue cheese on the side but they add it in the salad anyways.  The chicken wings were very small like any other bird but not chicken. We mentioned to the waiter that  the wings were too hot fir our taste. He offered ranch to add to the wings.  Really?

Upon ordering, our server forgot to take a couple people's order (which at first was understandable since we were a party of 20). But then she rarely came over to refill our drinks, and they weren't even that busy.  

Despite this, I surprisingly enjoyed their fries with their Alabama white sauce and their mac & cheese the most. I also tried their spicy habanero BBQ sauce that was really good.

I couldn't resist the temptation to go inside with the amazing aroma walking by....

I ordered Memphis dry rubbed spareribs for my main course and bacon wrapped meatballs for an appetizer. 

The meatballs, appeared cooked. The bacon looked cooked. But taking a bite out of them, they were ice cold, right out of the fridge. They forgot to microwave them. Which makes me realize that the prepare the food in advance and it isn't prepared fresh. Maybe this is normal for BBQ joints, if so... they still forgot to reheat my food. 

We had them heat us up new meatballs and they tasted decent. Not good enough to order them again. 

The ribs were very OK. Not amazing, not bad. I enjoyed them. I would consider eating them again if I didn't have the ice cold meatballs.

pot liquor is a welcoming, down-to-earth, jewel of a find that features food as comforting as home cooking and as perfectly executed and thoughtful as any haute cuisine establishment in vegas. 

It's one of those places I wish I had within walking distance of everywhere I am. 


besides the perfectly seasoned, smoked, and cooked meats, pot liquor truly shines in its perfectly-crafted sides, appetizers, and desserts.

in fact, i still have dreams about the melt-in-mouth pork belly perfectly balanced with tangy maple glaze and creamy grits. the skin is so perfectly crunchy, it snaps(!) at first bite!

furthermore, they make the blood sausage in house!!!  it's dense and rich and, again, ingeniously balanced with a fresh slice of orange and perfectly dressed salad. 

and for dessert --- 

I could eat tubfuls of their house-whipped whipped cream that comes in their key lime pie jars, which perfectly matches the graham cracker crumble and tangy key lime. 

and as for their bread pudding - i didn't know bread could melt in your mouth like that! it's as if all the warm feelings like love and comfort and joy was served on a plate.

Decor has a modern feel to it, part upscale sports bar, part smokehouse.  The manager both times is easy to spot, as he's making sure the place runs smoothly in these opening weeks.

Skirt Steak w/Oxtail Ragu: Steak was cooked correctly to order, a hint of marinade that had some distinctiveness but might've been lacking in a salt-ish flavor.  The ragu was an interesting compliment, but didn't exactly jump out for all its billing.

Dry Rub Ribs: A half order is still quite a generous portion of seven medium sized ribs with one end piece.  A tasty, distinctive rub that meshed well with the rib's juices.  The end piece though was tough like pork jerky.  Kale and cashew slaw is quite unique and tasty.  Fries were not.  Good value though with the promotion.

Overall, nice place, tasty food, but just like the blues it's the notes (in this case menu items) you don't have that makes the difference.",RQWdl0b9zzWoFI5hD5bYlw,0,0,3,A0TMFMBJ3nxIjwEG96pFwQ

The mac and cheese has a delicious crusted crumble on top. The corn bread is slightly sweet with a great corn meal. The must have dessert is the root beer float! It comes as a dessert glass with ice cream and chocolate chip cookie with a side glass of root beer. You can enjoy some of the cookie and ice cream before mixing, which makes it amazing.

3850746,2015-02-06,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"So I have been here several times since its grand opening earlier this year and I can honestly now say that this BBQ rivals the best in town (John Mull's Roadkill Grill). That's solely based on the standard BBQ fare though, because in all honesty, both restaurants are in a class of their own. 

Pot Liquor CAS (""Contemporary American Smokehouse"") is exactly like the name proclaims. It is a contemporary take on the Southern food we all know and love. Contemporary seems to be associated with overpriced menu items, that you can usually get for a fraction of the price elsewhere, or by strange menu items that take the original food item and completely transform them until they are unrecognizable (a la ""Chopped"" Basket Cooking). So much to my surprise, I was blown away when I came to Pot Liquor to find out that not only are the prices very reasonable, but they include (and actually exceed my expectation) of standard BBQ fare. That's not to say they don't have some creative spins on the classics (i.e. Oxtail chili) or that they don't have expensive items (i.e. Pappy Van Winkle that can run you almost $160 a glass for this extremely rare bourbon). But boy, oh, boy do they deliver on everything they do here.

The menu for the food, with the kitchen ran by Chef Doug Bell, as well as, the drink menu seems to consistently add new, and interesting, items to the menu every time I have had a chance to stop in there for Dinner. Here are a few highlights from my trips there:

Appetizers

- Classic: Burnt Ends and Devil'd Eggs - The Burnt Ends are a must-have at this location. 

As for the Devil'd Eggs, I am not usually the first one jumping out of my seat when these are offered at a cocktail party, but damn, these are some of the greatest things I have ever put in my mouth. The cracklin bacon bits sprinkled on top just send this item into another world.

- Contemporary: Bacon Steak and Stuffed Trotters - The Bacon Steak is a newly added item that probably takes 1st place over anything that I have had here. You get the crispy bacon sear on the outside like you would expect from a piece of bacon with your morning eggs, but the inside is pure, ooey-gooey pork belly richness. It is complemented with a side of some of the hottest, pickled pepper relish I have ever had. This dish is very reminiscent of a Vietnamese Bahn Mi sandwich done Southern.

The Stuffed Trotters are a unique item that I have never seen before. They take pig's feet (a Southern tradition) and grind it into almost a Pig's Feet Chicken Nugget. It is complemented with an apple compote and arugula salad of sorts that pairs perfectly with the juicy Pig McFugget.

Entrees

To be honest, I always get the ""Lord Have Mercy"" when I come here because I usually come in a group of 3 or more. It is perfect and definitely will fill a group of 5 or 6 easily. Comes with basically all the meats on the menu (does not include blood sausage, but I have substituted the Hot Links with them once), along with 3 sides and all their specialty sauces. All this for under $60!!! After you try their Baby Back Ribs or the Spare Ribs, you will probably never want to have ribs from another BBQ joint in town again. The pulled pork is perfect with their vinegar based sauce, as well. 

Drinks/Desserts

All of their special Lemonade cocktails are out of bounds amazing. You really can't go wrong with any of these. They also offer a wide selection of beers/ciders and an extensive whisky/bourbon selection (as mentioned above).

My favorite dessert so far has been the Fried Pies, which they change up with whatever is most in season. I recently had the Fried Pie filled with Kumquat which was probably the best dessert I have ever had. Tasted like good ol orange marmalade stuffed into a pie with a creamy vanilla sauce over the top. I believe the current Fried Pie is pecan which is like a Pecan Pie Hot Pocket. Which is.. fantastic!

Give yourself some time to truly enjoy this great addition to the Las Vegas food scene. It is located directly across from Yardhouse, so if you are feeling like you need a little more whisky than beer one night, then do yourself a favor and check out Pot Liquor!",cpQLUmF3_inyBki9trgO4g,1,1,5,K4vFBHhX3dUbVQzPCABsbg
3852593,2017-07-11,7,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Let me start this review by saying that me and my friends decided to go to a BBQ restaurant on the 4th of July. That's probably where we first went wrong. Of all days to go, we wanted to be festive after all. Boy oh boy..

Pot Liquor is tucked in one of the corners of Town Square. Luckily there is lots of nearby parking. We arrived around 6:45 (they take reservations over the phone and online without any issue) and were seated nearly immediately. The restaurant, at the time, was not busy at all. 

Our waitress was nowhere to be found for quite some time and looked a little frazzled/uninterested when we finally met. (It's a holiday, we get it.)

Fast forward to ordering, it would have been nice notice ahead of time that our food would take upwards of 30+ minutes to arrive and that there were 'big take out orders' ahead of ours. We overheard the our server apologizing to the other table and offering to bring out some snacks for the wait. Not a peep on our end. 

The food somewhat redeemed the experience/long wait. We shared three apps:  Brisket Burnt Ends, Pulled Pork Nachos and the Meatballs. The portions are very small imo. The nachos were at least substantial and hit the spot and were tasty. 

Not sure if I would want to ever return but I do have to admit that yes it was a national BBQ holiday and you're probably swamped.",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,7,8,3,xJVMYd2eVM_dhQ2t27AOjQ

3873229,2015-05-11,4,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"First off, I DO plan to give Pot Liquor another shot for dinner based on all the other positive reviews, but this review is for our Sunday Brunch experience which was pretty awful.  

When we walked in, the restaurant was almost empty, so we were seated right away.  However, our party of 2 was seated at a 10-top tall table which was odd given the abundance of open 4-top tables.  Right after we were seated, the manager yelled at the hostess for seating us there with no regard that everyone could hear him berating her.  He sounded like an ass and I felt bad for her, so I told him that we would be happy to move.  He put us right next to the kitchen door in the far corner.  Yes, he was a douche.

After we were seated, we waited 10 minutes just to have our drink order taken.  Then two large parties came in and were seated in the other corner by the flag wall.   They used this as an excuse why we waited another 15 minutes for our food order to be taken and 45 minutes for our food to arrive!  When it did arrive, it was cold!  

Smoke house hash- eggs on top of a hash mix: brisket, potatos, pepperes, onions- was cold as I mentioned.  I couldn't eat cold scrambled eggs, but the hash mix itself was tasty enough to eat a few bites, I just wish it was warm.  I didn't eat the cold toast either.

Chicken fried steak- also cold.  I did not try this, but was told it was bland and tough.

We were not impressed by the service or food at all; and likely will not be returning for brunch.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,7,2,2,VDSskig2CB1OsrWujap9-A
3875891,2014-10-16,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"My young son Easton, wife Nikki, and I were in early Saturday evening and you provided your card and asked us for feedback regarding our dinner experience. Since we'd made a point of coming to Town Square to try the restaurant, we thought we would follow through with a few comments.

Décor: The big paned windows, dark woods and checkered napkins catch your attention and the Mason jar chandeliers, ""reclaimed"" wall flag and barn boards under the bar draw you in.  It's a big space but it feels warm, charming, cozy and inviting. The music and black and white photos throw back to a simpler time but the food makes a culinary statement clearly defined by the present.
 
Service: Your server and bus staff were knowledgeable about the menu, friendly and attentive. In a city where service is often overpromised, your staff delivered perfectly.

Food: My wife says I cook a mean BBQ and with three smokers of my own, I know my way around fire and smoke. So, we ordered the largest of the combination platters to try a little of everything. WOW!! Everything we tasted was warm, flavorful and delicious. We particularly liked the ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken; cooked to perfection and smoked perfectly. All the meats were tasty and tender. My wife is a Florida girl, so she's familiar with most of the menu offerings but she never heard of nor previously tasted the Alabama white sauce.  It's a great addition to the other three, and provided for a contrasting and unique flavor experience. The creamy cast iron mac & cheese and crisp, sea salted green beans exceeded our expectations. We would have liked to try the key lime graham dessert or the fried pies, but we were just too full.
 
Impression: Honestly, upon sitting down we were initially surprised by the pricing, which felt a little exuberant for BBQ. However, the service, portion size, quality of the food and presentation quickly squashed that first impression. Pot Liquor is upscale, rustic chic and the food, service and experience was definitely worth the price.  We'll definitely be back for dinner, and lunch!

Recommendation: We really have only two small suggestions for improvement. Again, we ordered that big platter which definitely feeds more than two and easily could have served four. It came with three sides, which was awesome! However, the cornbread side only came with two small breads; not enough to share with everyone at the table. Maybe, in the instance when a party of three or four orders that big platter and they choose cornbread as a side, you could increase the number of muffins to four just so there is enough to go around. Everyone wanted a biscuit with that amazing honey butter! 

In addition, remind your wait staff to promote your water giving initiative. It's a really good and unique idea deserving of attention plus it shows you're socially responsible, which makes everyone feel good. We didn't know anything about it until you brought it up in the hallway. It's a cool idea that makes a difference, so share it verbally, with a coaster or a table tent!

Well, that's it for now. Thanks for asking us to share our thoughts. That too made us feel welcome and acknowledged. We'll definitely be back, and soon!",eq1EdGxvhcTlslhgFf9I_A,0,0,5,SeB7RffpFqdTr6hRRkOioA

I can't blame the server for slow food from the kitchen but not a single question on why we didn't eat any of the other food.

First the hostess asked us our head count then walked away.  So we just stood there, until someone else walked in asking if they could check in.  But we hadn't checked in yet.  When we get seated, no one checks on us, asked for drinks or greats us... Hmmm.  Didn't even notice the menus since they were left with the 6 year old.   Now someone else gets seated in our area, and they have drinks and orders taken before us.  Ok......
Finally our very friendly, and personable but panicked waiter comes over and takes 2 drink orders and leaves.  We have a party of 8.  Next he gets another 2 drink orders and leaves.  Now we finally order, and he forget to get my daughters dinner order.  I haven't had a drink refill, and my drink is empty
It's been a LONG time and he comes back promising again to rush the kids meals, since he realizes we are on borrowed time, but the kitchen must have been on strike because this never happens...  He Promises the kids bread, to pasify them, but that ends up coming 15 minutes after dinner.
A couple meals come cold, and mine gets returned 2 times.  Let me preface with I rarely send food back.  Wrong temp, pink, no pink,, if it tastes ok I'm cool, but a combo plate that's cool to the touch must go back.  The third time it comes back, the chicken is still cold to the touch but the other items are almost warm.  So we keep it.  Still no refills, sides are missing from a couple meals, and kids are exhausted.  Both managers come over, know we are eating cold food and it appears no one cares.
Bill comes.  Yes with different plates going back for COLD temps, drinks left empty, and sides coming after people are done eating, the bill comes with comped dessert that no one would have ordered even if they were the only desserts on the menu.  Bread pudding and key lime pie.  2 things none of us like.....  But I try them just to see, and the bread pudding is very dry, and the key lime chocolate crust is so hard, it hurt to try and chew.
If you want to treat an unhappy table with exhausted children, might want to ask us first, and let us choose our dessert.
Now I will say, the waiter tried hard to be chummy with the kids, and they loved him for it.  But the rest of us didn't want to be at dinner for the amount it takes a trained athlete to run a marathon.
Epic fail.
Taste of the food on our combo plate was pretty good, but just a monumental let down..

Let me start by saying that ANY place that has bloody mary (Let alone UNLIMITED) already has my heart. We had the wings and waffles, biscuits and gravy, and the fan favorite of Smokehouse Hash. Pot Liquors (along with our reception) is what everyone remembered most about our Vegas Vacation (especially my mother in law. That's all she talks about lol).  We will be back in LV this weekend, and cannot wait to revisit. 
 
Also, just an FYI (From someone with a strong medical  background ) you  DO NOT get food poisoning minutes after eating something (or while you're still eating for that matter). I'm assuming that the ""poisoned"" feeling you got was from either too much alcohol, or one of the  cheapy places you may have visited during that birthday weekend (we're all guilty of that) LOL",5aEpsfK9laECnMs7WcjTPQ,0,0,4,ZCSvs4dkzY2Lh2AOSm89ww

Service is a 1/2 star at best.  not sure how the service is at night time or for any time except during the day, but the day staff is pretty horrific when it comes to service.  The first time (about a month ago) met a friend for lunch; sat at the bar.  waited & waited & waited.  Finally got served.  Just ordered a beer and a couple appetizers (was told they had no draft beer as their system was down).  Food came out and attempted to order another beer, server said, let me get the bartender; waited.......waited......waited.......finally the bartender came over and asked if i needed another beer; and then promptly disappeared again, until the bill came (of course).  Mind you, there were literally a total of 8 ppl in the entire place.

Fast forward to this past sunday (08/20/2017); went in about 4pm with a group of 4.  Once again we sat at the bar.  Once again we were told they had no draft beer as their system was down.  I told her they were down a month ago.  Including my party (of four), their were maybe another 5-6 ppl in the entire place.  Ordered a beer and the bartender disappeared.  Finally coming back so we could place our order; (just ordered 3 appetizers).  We waited.........waited......waited.  I kid you not, we finished our beers before the 1st appetizer came out.  nearly finished the appetizer before the bartender or the 2nd appetizer even showed up.  Same for the 3rd appetizer.  

Overall the staff appears to be very inattentive.  Not sure I will be returned to Pot Liquor anytime soon.  Sorry, but I gave you 2 legitimate chances to earn a valued customer and you unfortunately blew it both times.",CqBtx02HJV0H85C6eev8uA,2,0,2,RUGzVHb9-qc4fYG1dK3tZg

4043011,2015-11-04,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"This restaurant is located fairly close to airport in a outdoor shopping plaza. 

Came in for an early dinner late lunch. Seated fairly quick. Server was good with food and beverage order taken without much delay. 

Purified water was served. It was better than most water in the Las Vegas area. Food order was Tri Tip Sandwich with Au Jus and Chicken Sandwich. Sandwiches are served with choice of fries. Fries can substituted for salad or sweet potato fries for an up charge. We elected for the regular fries. 

Tri tip sandwich comes with cheese BBQ sauce onions on rustic loaf served with a side of au jus. The thin sliced tri tip, onions, cheese, and rustic bread reminded me of a Philly cheese steak sandwich. Bread was a little toasted but the light BBQ sauce au jus helped give a little softness. Sweet BBQ sauce nestling the meat was a good compliment to the savory and salty found through the sandwich.

Chicken Sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, BBQ sauce and slaw. Fried chicken breast was huge and juicy. Onion was sweet crispy. Slaw was light sweet and savory. Vegetables were crisp and fresh. 

French fries here were okay. Nothing exceptional or standout.

4049898,2015-10-08,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Quite pricy, but as long as you split meals it's not that expensive.  The portions are generous.  A $35 combo platter that included pulled pork, hot links, two kinds of ribs, and two sides was enough for 2 and there were even leftovers.  The collard greens were pretty good - better than average.  The yams were OK, but nothing special.  The ribs were a little dry, but they had a couple of sauces on the side.  The pulled pork was not really as flavorful and was pretty pulverized and greasy.  I prefer my pulled pork a little more chunky than this.  Still it's one of the only BBQ places in Town Square.  I give it an A-OK three star rating and I would have given it a 4 star if they had included any bread in the platter.  Oh I could have used up one of my vegetable sides to get cornbread, but that's just not a good option.  A BBQ meal should come with some bread even if it's just a biscuit or a roll.  Even a slice of bread would be better than nothing.  It couldn't break you to provide a 25 cent roll on a platter that costs over $30.     Service was good.  A little slow to get the food, but really friendly and nice.  

Weird things about the bar though - I sort of wonder if there is an escort service operating out of there.  It seems like there are pretty blondes hanging at the bar constantly on their cell phones, never ordering drinks or meals.  Just hanging out coming and going whenever the phone rings.

4053190,2014-10-10,5,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Short Review:
It's all about their short ribs, the mac & cheese, and candied sweet potatos.  In my opinion, their prices are a bit high for what you get, especially on their sides. 

Longer Review:
Pot Liquor CAS would be 4 stars from me if I all I got was their short ribs, their mac & cheese, and candied sweet potatos.  I have to admit, their short ribs is phenominal. I'm not a pork fan, but couldn't resist seconds when the girlfriend offered to share.  Their short ribs are ""fall off the bone"" and literally melts in your mouth.  But that was my girlfriend's meal.  Their Texas Beef Briskets is what I ordered and was disappointed.  It's a good portion at around 8 oz, but that was the only thing good about it. My briskets were rubbery, had no taste, and was dry at the same time.  I felt like I was eating a ham steak from a casino buffet not a beef brisket.  Good thing I had some of their mac & cheese and candied sweet potatos to wash it down.  

I gave Pot Liquor 3 stars based on my overall experience.  The prices are a bit high, especially their sides, and the service was average. As for their food...just stay away from their beef briskets unless you're craving a ham steak.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,5,4,3,YFBCMSjmPYZTInjuqi0r8w

4085910,2016-01-11,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"We performed in a show at the Baobab stage on Friday night. Pot Liquor was closing its kitchen, but when we said we had some people who wanted to eat, they actually kept the kitchen open for us. That was a nice start to our experience.

The place has some nice furniture and some weird touches to it. There's a portrait of a pig wearing Converse that welcomes you. The Bar is huge and has plenty of seating. The sit down tables are a nice dark wood and it's pretty comfortable seating. 

We moved some tables to fit the 20 or so of us. The server was very nice and didn't seemed overwhelmed at the numbers. She was prompt and got waters to everyone. I also got myself a Speakeasy IPA. I highly recommend it if you like IPAs as it has the the aromas and tastes of the IPA and has less of that barky taste that some IPAs have. 

For food, you are never going to go wrong with Moinks. They are bacon wrapped meatballs covered in a sweet and hot barbecue sauce. The bacon is crispy and the meatball itself is flavored well. The pulled pork slider is also a nice treat if you are looking for some snacks. If you are in it to win it, I'd go for the Brisket Burger. $20 gets you a burger of 8 oz of angus beef with 4 oz of brisket. It's huge. Your heart might not be ready for it, but your stomach will be.

I've gotten some great service from this place. Often overlooked, you would do yourself a favor to get yourself an IPA and some Moinks here.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,1,5,GETImfcB_un0bw4-h4e2pw

Sat at the bar and the staff was very quick to get me my drink order.  Nice to see fresh lemonade with free refills.  I took my time perusing the menu so the bartender suggested a plate of pork rinds while I made my decision.  Tasty, warm, and with a touch of lime-salt.  Being Filipino, I prefer to have a little meat on my pork rinds, not just the skin.  But that's a personal bias I won't let influence this review.

Decided on the half-order dry rubbed ribs with green beans and the cornbread muffins.  The green beans were crisp-tender and very well seasoned.  The corn muffins (3 half-sized ones) were good with a very good honey butter on the side.

The ribs are very good here!  Very flavorful dry rub and the meat was falling off the bone tender.  The two 'que sauces were served on the side: 1 was smoky, 2 had a little more heat.  Nice that they give you both and you can always order more.  A nice touch is that the ribs come to the table individually sliced.  Sometimes you don't feel like fighting your meat, even if you have a knife in your hand!  

Some reviews complained about the wait.  Can't comment on the wait 'cause I was watching football and I usually lose all track of time when I'm watching football.  

I liked the atmosphere here.  Cool black and white photos, unique saxophone chandelier, and classic rock playing in the background.  The staff was very attentive and one of the owners and the assistant manager came by, introduced themselves, and asked about the experience.  

The only gripe I had was about the dessert.  I haven't had a good fried pie in a long time and was happy to see it on the menu.  But....duh..duh..duhhhhhhh......they didn't have any.  WHAAAAATTTT?!  Nope.  My bartender told me it would be on the menu by the time they had their official opening....(sniff, sniff)....  One of the tragedies of eating at a restaurant during their soft opening.  I usually like soft openings too...but I digress

Overall a very good experience.  I'll definitely be back to try other dishes...and to try their deep fried pies.",tt0Lpzd4m_3IAK4aa-8LpA,1,0,4,JB1WWFRJrDsTmYFh96CtlA

4119856,2015-11-05,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

This is a very nice comfortable restaurant in a sea of restaurants at Town Square Las Vegas.  It made it to the top 10 list of BBQ places in Las Vegas.   The food is excellent . . . absolutely delicious and the sides are substantial.   If it wasn't for the really slow (read agonizingly slow terrible service) and limitations on the menu we would have rated it higher.

The environment is welcoming and very pleasant with seating that allows a diner to look out and people watch as shoppers wander the Town Square.  Purified water is served (you can elect to donate $0.50 to help fund charitable endeavors bringing drinking water to places in the world that don't have easy access to it.)

The menu is limited.  You can order ribs, or chicken or pulled pork or the usual suspects found in most BBQ restaurants.  You can even get two of them together as a combination but not the combination you might choose. You must select the combination that is on the menu which is very limiting.   If you wanted to sample a variety of offerings from kitchen you MUST order a $65 combination and be buried in food designed for a large table.  All the choices are fixed. If you wanted to sample ribs, pork and chicken in smaller portions but as a sampler, that isn't a choice you are permitted to make.

The food however is killer.  I had a $25 full order of pulled pork with Carolina sauce, a huge bucket of Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad accompanied the pork.  There are plenty of side choices. My meal we delicious and was big enough for two meals.  The Boss had the chicken sandwich which was also delicious and plentiful. Very good job from the kitchen.  Delicious, plentiful and filling.

Now the not so good. We were there when only 5 tables in the entire place had diners.  After an initial greeting, our server was not to be found.  She approached tables around us periodically and never thought to check in with us, ensure we had what we needed, re-filled drinks, or to respond to questions.  She was a ghost who disappeared and whom we had to flag down to  get routine, normal table service (like refilling drinks or to ask for a napkin).  She appeared completely indifferent to us and only moved with real speed when she brought us the check.  It was just so frustrating having to chase down service in an otherwise very slow restaurant.

We won't be back.   The environment is nice, the food excellent, the menu limited but the service is abysmal.  I don't want to spend my dining time looking for our server, feeling frustrated that she isn't checking in on us and generally being marginalized until its time to pay the check.",NRIVHcztZ2sVuL3ZTIDlVw,2,0,2,_BNpwB1Hr72y0ahTu5sc9g

We went by at 7:45pm on a Thursday night on the Las Vegas strip and I was shocked they only had the playoffs on one tv. It was literally a ghost town. So I found it weird we waited 5 minutes or longer for our waitress to come greet us. 

So we started off with drinks, they have a large bourbon menu and my fiancé loved that so he ordered a $15 glass of Blantons ,but the waitress informed us that they were out of that so my fiancé ordered Glen Levitt instead and said it had a funny taste but we just let that go. 

We then ordered their ""Go hog wild"" platter to share with macaroni and candied yams on the side for $40 and all I can say is...we weren't impressed. The candied yams were brought out 5 minutes after we got the food and they were hard like they weren't cooked all the way through with virtually no flavor. We sent them back and got greens that came out almost immediately hot and fresh. The macaroni and cheese was the highlight of the meal while it had more cheese than I care for it was still really good. The ribs were ok the hot link looked old and dry so I left that alone and there was a mountain of yummy pulled pork and two types of ribs.

So we walked in and immediately was greeted by a lovely hostess! She asked if we needed a high chair and gave us a spot to park our stroller :) My husband and I look pretty young like we are teenager parents and usually people don't provide us with great customer service and like to judge us or something. But this place did nothing like that which is rare for us. The customer service is extraordinary! We were seated right away and our food came out pretty fast for ordering all that food!

She knew when to get us a refill on drinks because we were getting low (when I didn't even notice yet!), she recommended different appetizers and definitely made it sound delicious! So we bought the BBQ meatballs wrapped in bacon which were yummy & crunchy with a dash of sweetness!:) My husband ordered the dinner plate which was huge! He has spare ribs and baby back ribs with two sides of Mac n cheese & French fries with a white dipping sauce. I tried some of his French fries, very crunchy and the sauce is so smooth. I had just the one platter of baby back ribs. Their bbq sauce is sweet, probably one of the best barbecue sauces I've had and much better than Lucille's ;) no offense! My sides were Mac n cheese and corn bread. Their serving sizes are no joke, their huge and can definitely share, Brook did warn us but we were really hungry and usually my husband can eat a lot so we got our own entrees. My son had the items on the kids menu, bottomless Mac n cheese and green beans. Let me tell you, their green beans are sooooo good! I dont know what their dipped in or anything but I could eat them like French fries lol. The prices weren't too bad at all! Pretty cheap meal for a BBQ place with huge portions! Our bill came out to 78 bucks! That included our 3 entrees, 1 beer, 1 beverage, and 1 appetizer!:) The food was super delicious, but a major reason this places gets 5 stars is for the exceptional customer service. Not only was Brook so nice and helpful, the other staff members were nice too even the guy bringing out the food to our table! The manager was there and even greeted us and walked around to each table asking how everything was. This place is child friendly and of course adult friendly (they have a full bar if you want a night out!) Thank you so much, Brook, for being our server and not judging us and accepting who we are as people. You deserved that tip and I hope you continue to do what you're doing! Thanks again, we definitely will be back & hopefully you can serve us again!  
Sorry Yelp I have no pics this time but I do hope you come out to try this place :)",uJ0gWkKHHe3wIZV1ByKuLA,0,0,5,ss7ZlTVDEYiLdURsVuHtPA

We were greeted by a super friendly hostess right when we walked in. We were immediately seated and instantly welcomed by our server Tammy. We had never been before and she really knew her stuff. She suggested the best burnt ends and deviled eggs I have ever tasted. I was impressed with the lunch menu portions as my brisket sandwich came with a nice side of fries and A side of coleslaw. I even have left over for dinner tonight. Thanks Tammy for the great suggestions and for taking such great care of us! The food was amazing and the service was outstanding!

If you're looking for some BBQ lovin' Pot Liquor is where it's at!! i've been on a BBQ kick this summer and have tried several different spots with two weeks of each other and all the rest pale in comparison to this place! The ambience is clean and welcome with unique chandeliers and an awesome tattered looking painted wall....its kinda got a country chic feel to it. Even the hand drawn Sharpie art work in the restroom is memorable!  

Now to the good stuff, I mean GREAT stuff, the food! We started off with Deviled Eggs, (score!) they were uber creamy with a slight zest. The cracklin' on top adds nice crunch. For my main course I order the Burnt Ends (from the appetizer menu) and paired it with a side of Mac n' Cheese (don't judge me, ot was our cheat day!)  Their burnt ends were out of this world!! The meat had very little fat, but was still bursting with flavor. They seriously melted in my mouth; they were prepared with a beautiful, tasty char without tasting burnt...absolute perfection!! They Mac n' Cheese was also tasty, but the burnt ends stole the show. I highly recommend you try them!

Our dining experience would not have been the same without out Bartender Brandon! He'a pretty much the man!! He offered us his recommendations, gave thorough descriptions of the food and drinks, and served us with respect, a great personality, and a fun smile!!",cglyQq_IWXEuAFKXYhNXgg,3,3,5,lIG29Ov2I38FBphLvCOhRg
4261766,2016-01-18,17,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I have probably walked by this place 200 times and I never went in. Then I went here twice in three days. Go figure. 

The first time I went here was after a watching a movie at AMC for a Yelp CME. They offered happy hours prices. That night I enjoyed a beer and tasted their moinks, a wrapped meatball with a tangy sauce. I enjoyed the atmosphere as many BBQ joints seem to  follow the rule of having white and red checkered everything with a super country atmosphere. This restaurant has been paying attention to Pinterest trends with their decor. 

The second time I went was after seeing a show at the Baobab with a very large group. They were able to accommodate us and they were really cool about it too. The waitress made sure to take our orders based on where we were sitting, and then she effortlessly split the checks for us. I don't think I have had such a smooth large group dinner in my life. 

For this second time, I had not eaten dinner and I had two drinks during the show, so I figured I better get a bite. I saw the descriptions of their full menu items and figured the portions would be huge, so I turned to the appetizer menu. After speaking with the waitress and based on recommendations, I went with the pork belly on the country grits. I have been on a pork belly kick lately and I really enjoyed the dish. The grits were cheesy and the reduction type sauce they drizzled brought it together. I will say that the dish is best eaten hot, as I started talking too much and I let the rest of my food got cold. There is simply too much fat in this dish between the cheese and the fat from the pork belly that starts to congeal if you let it sit. So scarf it quick. 

Overall I was impressed with the service. I think that if you are in the mood for BBQ with a smidge of class, this is the place.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,24,18,4,bWbgikiHUB0J39THIbqNzw
4264526,2015-03-06,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I had to wait a few months after soft opening for my official review.  PL originally opened last year and we went during soft opening with mixed feelings mostly due to execution.  I'm please to say that those ""issues"" have been overcome and now it's worth going.  We had a big table at 9 pm so it was a great way to stress the kitchen near closing time.  The group ordered nearly everything so here are the highlights...dry rub spare ribs were the top hit.  Smoke and spice, and tenderness was on point and being dry, you control how much bbq sauce you want to add. Half rack was more than one large man could eat, making the full rack an obscene amount of pork.  Just as surprising the first time around, the BBQ chicken was amazingly tasty and moist. Baby back ribs were good too but the table definitely loved the dry rub ribs the best.  All the sides were good and wiped out.  For me personally, the one thing i would not get again was the pork belly on grits.  Could have been flavored more and cooked longer for tenderness.  As of right now, the king in town on pork belly/grits is still Echo and Rig.

Final thought, it's a great new addition for dinner at Town Square.  Not quite as good as Road Kill or Rollin Smoke but my new favorite dinner spot at Town Square and it's a full service restaurant/bar.",RJXWEWZS6ZYT6wJ_EOBf2Q,0,0,4,V-1RJj2qR8sawXhnI7KnNw

Park near the movie theaters in Town Square and the place is right next door. The restaurant has been empty the times I've been (weeknights, weekends) so no need for a reservation. 
Whats the Deal with the Chicken and the Beef: It comes with brisket, pulled pork and chicken. 2 corn breads are included and you get a choice of 2 sides. The pulled pork and brisket were AMAZING. The chicken was a little dry. The corn bread and honey butter were so good, that I wouldn't be against ordering more corn bread for your side ;) Collared greens were good, but if I'm going to eat my vegetables I want them to be in a more healthy form. Mac N Cheese and french fries were both good.

The restaurant is located in ""Las Vegas Town Square"", which is a cute, off-the-strip shopping center that has really nice outdoor walkways and a large children's play area/park in it. It seems pretty new, and has a nice vibe. The restaurant itself is nice and airy, with 2 glass walls in the large space. It was quiet there on a weekday lunch ""rush"". The southern/country touches, especially the mason jar chandeliers, were fun and contemporary.

The first time I had collard greens (at a FoodTV chef's place in Orlando), I loved them, so I jumped at the chance to have some in Vegas. I also had the Burnt Ends since Yeeps raved about them, and I haven't ever tried them before. I really enjoyed the taste of both the collard greens & burnt ends. In addition, the service was very good. Our waiter was very responsive, and helpful when we ordered.

The service at tables is rather slow and not too friendly. They skate by doing the bare minimum. 

While I had high hopes for this food it falls rather short. The flavor is not found in the meet and their sauces were a bit off. Being from Kansas I live for BBQ but was let down by theirs. I would choose to eat elsewhere.

Pros :
While the food was a let down their bar drinks were outstanding. The bartenders were nice and prompt unlike the servers. 
Drinks are fairly priced and have a lot of options for liquor.

4382510,2015-06-08,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Pot Liquor is definitely the best BBQ in Las Vegas. I've lived in Texas and had BBQ from other regions during my travels so I can appreciate good BBQ and this is it.

First, let's talk about the meat because that is the most important piece of BBQ. The person that created the rubs for their meats deserves an A+ because they are all right on. Before Pot Liquor I'd never tasted meat so good that I didn't think it needed sauce. The four different sauces they offer are great, but not at all necessary because the meat is perfect on its own. 

Second, let's talk about the sides. They are all bursting with flavor. It seems like they slow cook many of their items because the flavor is in the food, not like flavors added after the fact. The collard greens are the best I've ever had with more flavor than the average greens. The hoppin john's are a creative dish that will leave you addicted. The macaroni and cheese is obviously made in house and nothing like the macaroni and cheese other BBQ places serve (in a good way). The sweet potatoes, oh my, the sweet potatoes. Another dish where the flavor is within and then topped with homemade marshmallow topping. Dreams are made of this stuff. 

The appetizers and desserts are equally enticing. The deviled eggs are my favorite. They have a creamy filling with a salty chicken crackling topping. The pork skins come out still sizzling and have all the salt you crave in pork skins with a hint of lime to offset the salt. For desserts, my favorite is the hand pies. The crust is delicate and flaky with the fillings varying by season. The anglaise on top is so delicious I could just eat that with a spoon.

Wow, I thought! 4 A's. This must be a great place. So off we went to dinner with another couple with grand visions of a fabulous meal to come. This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion. I gave this place a one star rating because the cornbread muffin was just ok and the water was wet!

We got a few appetizers and some didn't even show up til mid entree. Our sides for our entrees didn't show up until after we were done eating. Now that being said our food was actually quite tasty. The hotlinks and ribs were delicious. I'm not sure if this was just management not scheduling right and a new server, to boot.

4451766,2015-06-03,2,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"This new-ish BBQ place in Town Square enters a long-line of restaurants that have come and gone from Town Square. Remember the cowboy place? And that one Mexican restaurant? Seems like everything gets beat out by Yard House.

My husband and I trekked here one Friday night. No reservation, I was pleased to see the place was not packed, but I think it was on the early-side of the night still for Town Square.

The inside reminiscent of Lone Star Steak House, except modernized, and no peanut shells on the floors. Pricing is, well, a little pricey I thought, unless you are sharing a meal, which my husband and I did. When we walked in the door we were also given a small coupon for a buy-an-entree, get a free-cocktail or appetizer. So, this worked out well for us!

Pork Belly with Country Grits ($11.98) - We started with our free appetizer, it comes out as two chunks of pork belly, settled on top of cheesy grits with some sort of reduction sauce (don't remember now what it was). Overall, it was good, cooked well, nice flavor combination. Would I order it for $12 without the free coupon? Probably not, because it such a small app - if there had been more than two of us, this would have been a bad choice.

What's the Beef with the Chicken & the Hog ($35.98) - Texas style brisket, 1/2 smoked chicken, and Carolina-style pulled pork, comes with two sides, we picked the macaroni and cheese and the red bliss potato salad, because who needs green vegetables when eating BBQ? Not me! 

I was not impressed with the chicken, I thought out of all the meats, it lacked. They will also ask to up-charge you to ""all-white meat"" for $3 more, which I declined cuz I don't discriminate against the chicken... parts. Brisket was pretty damn good, and something I'd come back for. They smoke it well. I don't know what they do, but whatever it is, it produces some delicious meat. Carolina pork was also on point. I liked the fact it wasn't covered in sauce, which can often times detract from the meat itself. The meal comes with three different sauces - I enjoyed the watery au-jus type dipping sauce, and the (what I think) was a garlic-based white sauce. I did not like the overly-sweet BBQ sauce. Pass.

Mac and cheese was creamy and pleasing. Potato salad was, to me, perfect - a mustard-base salad with big chunks of potato, green onions, and bacon bits. 

We skipped dessert as we were full and had plenty to take home.

Again, going back to pricing - I think this is what would keep me from going back. Our check was $40-ish dollars, and we got the app for FREE. Without the coupon we would have been at $50+, and we also opted not to get drinks, which probably would have set us back another $15 - $20. So, if we really wanted to go all-out here, it would have been a check for $70 for two people (no tip yet, btw). So, nearing $100 for a two person meal in Town Square? Kind of outrageous in my opinion.

They do have a brunch which I am interested in trying, so I may be back for that. But I think I'll have to venture elsewhere for BBQ, because my deep-pockets are reserved for other meals.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,3,XoyGiGcXYV2UM3AhTvtqpw

My friends and I visited on a Saturday just after 3p during Happy Hour. The place was basically empty except for a few people at the bar. 

My friend Ms. S and I decided to share the Pulled Pork Nachos while Mr. E went for the Smoked Wings with Fries (both on the HH Menu). The Nachos were awesome because they were totally loaded with some great cheese sauce and the flavor of the BBQ Pork was sweet and delicious! While I didn't get to try the wings, I did try the fries - they had nice seasoning, but the fries themselves were just fine. 

I really wanted to try the ribs, but I certainly didn't want an entire half rack let alone all the sides that came with it. I happened to notice that the children's menu had a two rib meal. I asked the waitress if I could order off the kids menu and she said no. So I asked if I could ""order for my son"" (my six month old). She checked with the management and got the go-ahead! However, the ribs were brought out by a woman from the kitchen who seemed extremely upset by the fact that I'd ordered from the kids menu. She looked at my nursing son and said, ""This is for him?""  I thought she was being funny, so I laughed and said, ""He's a big eater!"" (which happens to be very true). She rolled her eyes in the most aggressive way possible and sarcastically said, ""I bet."" and walked away. I just thought it was sad that they let me order and then had to be judgy and mean about it. If it was that big of a problem, they could've just told me no. Also, the ribs weren't very good. Next time I would definitely skip these and try something else. 

Ms. S and I also shared the brownie Bread Pudding, which I found pretty disappointing. For my tastes it wasn't as rich or as sweet as I wanted it to be.

They have the coolest chandeliers...two made of mason jars and one made of saxophones and other musical instruments. 
The menu has tons of appealing options but a girl can only eat so much so will have to go back to try more.  For starters we had the devil'd eggs with chicken skin cracklin (hugely yummy) and boiled peanut hummus (excellent). We shared our main and absolutely loved the chicken pot pie and the amazing fries that came with it. We should have tried the white sauce for the fries but will do that next time. We also had the red bliss potato salad and mac and cheese - both were very tasty. They were out of collard greens, boohoo, so will try that next time as well. The shrimp po' boy was good but we much preferred the chicken pot pie. With just opening, everything can't be perfect right out of the gate.
For dessert we had the strawberry shortcake sandwiches and my dining pals all love it. I'm allergic to strawberries so sadly had to pass. I really wanted to try the fried banana split with the strawberry compote on the side but they are not serving that just yet. Other stand outs on the menu that sound amazing but we did not yet try are pan seared stripe bass, fried green tomato salad, pork belly with country grits, fried catfish benedict and baked blue crab. I'm not a red meat eater but will be bringing my husband back to try.

4600624,2014-11-28,7,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Went here for a pre-Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving. Ordered the 3 course meal. Started with butternut squash soup, it came out right away and was so freaking good, I wanted to lick my bowl. 2nd course was the main course which included turkey (white and dark meat), juicy, well seasoned, excellently prepared. Cranberry sauce, far too sour. The best stuffing I have ever had in the world (although a little on the salty side), sweet potatoes, green bean casserole and mashed potatoes. Every item was prepared exceptionally well. The third course, dessert, was a pumpkin cheesecake which was delicious as well, I ended up eating my dates cheesecake, too lol.

The vibe in the restaurant was amazing. It was very dim, the bartenders were attentive and provided some colorful conversation. The noise level was very low, even with the football games playing on the three TVs over the bar, and the drinks were strong and cheap. My date and I ordered  raspberry tarts which I highly recommend. This place is great for friends as well as family. 100% recommend!",1sghNitdObSPFhxqS5Othg,9,8,5,LTvGqkNpnF_thStOpEV5aQ

I cannot think of one single thing to complain about except I have to pull up from the table & leave. Seriously, one of the best dining experiences EVER! Best part about all of this is that all of these items were on the Happy Hour Menu.. & was worth every dime and some!

4618802,2014-11-09,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Good quality BBQ at a decent price, good atmosphere - kind of like contemporary brewery meets sports bar meets BBQ, with odd music choices. Almost like an identity crisis that somehow works. The service was friendly but SLOW. For BBQ which has already been smoked, it should come out quickly! We were seated at 6:05 pm and our check was also slow in coming out, finally arrived around 8:30 pm! Most of the time was spent waiting for the food or check. We ate quickly because we had two kids in tow. They also never brought out those warm wet washcloths to wipe your hands, so I had to wash my hands to get the BBQ sauce off of my hands.
That being said, the ribs were meaty and delicious with a subtle hint of smoke. The sweet sauce was good, but the vinegar sauce was too astringent. The fries weren't great (luke warm and hard) but the Alabama sauce was really good. The succotash was ok, they used corn cut off the cob. Pulled pork was standard. The burnt ends were a little tough, but came with local pickles (cool) and Wonder bread-type bread slices. Why?? My five-year-old son complained about the mac and cheese; I tasted it wondering what could be wrong with mac and cheese, and it was suspiciously Velveeta-esque. Overall, their meat was good quality, but they skimped on some of the sides.
Lucille's is better and worth the extra drive, unless you just want a trendy place to hang out.",TUFzqkWN8R6-Xx4kp8NXow,0,0,4,vUHAKRYNQpHCE30wGE7g0Q
4620466,2014-11-28,1,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"This place is A-OK, as you probably surmised from my selection of Yelp star rating.

I stumbled across their Thanksgiving menu online. For $20, it sounded like something worth trying. We were looking for a low key dinner spot and this place fit that description.

Town Square seemed dead, but Pot Liquor had a decent crowd. Looking through their beer list, although they have a respectable bottle and can list, the draft offering is meh. I went with a La Fin Du Monde that cost more than it should.

On to dinner. The first negative off the bat was that the butternut squash soup was being replaced with cream of mushroom. It sounded like a downgrade. Luckily, it was actually quite good. The main course featured very tender peach wood smoked turkey breast and confit of turkey leg and thigh. This was accompanied by a salty and burnt cornbread/apple/sausage stuffing. Fortunately, the rest of the surrounding sides were well made--the requisite green bean casserole, yams, mashed potato, and cranberry/orange sauce. And like the starter, the pumpkin cheesecake dessert was surprisingly good.

Their happy hour gets you 25% off absolutely everything (according to our server) and is available 3-6pm Mon-Fri and all day Tuesday. I enjoyed dinner enough that it would be worth checking out again during HH.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,2,3,3Yy2Rmh8jxpWH_ZoPG1Ozg

The food was mediocre at best. Beef Brisket was fair, Lucille's is ten times better.Short Ribs tasted like they dumped the salt shaker on them. Burnt Ends Appitizer was grisly and chewy. None of the dishes served were much to brag about.

It's elegant and modern, yet casual. You can have a nice dinner or a casual lunch. I also love sitting at the bar with the very friendly bartenders! Oh, and the food is delicious!

Kansas City Style Burnt Ends ($10.95): Beef brisket point, maple bark, 'cue #1, Pullman loaf, Nevada Brining Company pickles. Apparently I'm late to the delicious game that is burnt ends, but now that I've had them, I'm not letting them out of my sight! I've had this dish twice and oh my gosh, it is GOOOOD. I mean, REALLY GOOD. Highly recommended!

Crispy Fried Chicken Wings ($9.95): The wings have a great batter that is truly crispy and very flavorful and the chicken was moist. They're served with celery and carrot ribbons and spicy ranch. All very yummy. I really didn't expect to like this dish so much, but it's one of the better wings I've had.

Devil'd Eggs ($5.95): Gherkins, Dijon mustard, topped with chicken skin cracklings. I love deviled eggs and these are great. I love the flavor of their yolk mixture and the crispy cracklings lend a nice texture against the creaminess. Another fantastic choice for shared bites or bar food.

Fried Green Tomato Salad ($12.95): Red onion, country ham, goat cheese, lemon caper and olive oil dressing. The green tomatoes had a nice texture (it wasn't mushy, which would've been disastrous). The batter was fantastic and held up with the dressing. All the ingredients worked really well together - the crunchy and aromatic onion, a little saltiness from the ham (thinly sliced like prosciutto), and the tart goat cheese.

Dry Rubbed Spareribs: Slow-smoked with a dry rub; finished on the grill. Delicious. I absolutely love the smoky sweet flavor of the meat. Serious yum.

Mopped Baby Back Ribs: Slow-smoked pork baby back ribs; mopped with 'cue #2. I usually go for spareribs, but the barbecue sauce on this one made me a fan. Oh, and it was tender. I still like dry rubs on meat better, but this sauced rib is just as delicious.

Louisiana Hot Links: Nice snap and unique flavor. It's also not too spicy. Overall, good sausage.

Chili of All Chilis ($13.95): Ground beef, smoked pork, smoked beef brisket, red beans; served on corn cake. I'm pretty picky about chili and I can't even tell you anywhere I actually enjoy it...until now! The smoked meats really add to this dish and I love that the chili isn't too sweet (that drives me crazy). Also, the corn cake is so, so good!

Fries with Alabama White Sauce ($4.95): I know, they're ""just fries,"" but I truly LOVE these fries. They're delicious and that sauce is addicting! I wouldn't mind hanging out at the bar and munching on these all day.

Sides: Macaroni and Cheese, Hoppin John, and Collard Greens in Pot Liquor are all solid choices and really delicious. I don't normally endorse ""mac n' cheese,"" but I like theirs; it's not too heavy and it has a nice balance of flavors. The Hoppin John is their version of a dirty rice or rice and beans and I really enjoyed it. Another dish that I could just keep eating. To round it off, collard greens - just yum. I love that it wasn't just a pile of green goo; it was distinguishable pieces of collard greens that still had bite, but deliciously soaked in pot liquor.

At their grand opening event, I tried the Boiled Peanut Hummus (fantastic and so fresh; tasted just like hummus I make at home!), Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich (yummy; tender meat), Southern Style Chicken Sandwich (SO good! I'm definitely ordering this during lunch!), Fried Pumpkin Pie (light, flaky pastry with creamy pumpkin filling - yum! It was also not too sweet!), and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cluster (creamy PB center of chocolate with nuts; good stuff). 

Their cocktails are fantastic! My favorites: Apple Mint Julep (J.P. Wiser's Rye Whiskey, mint, mint simple syrup, apple juice) and Cucumber Corpse (Prairie Cucumber Vodka, Grande Absente Absinthe, St. Germain Elderflower, cucumber, lemonade).",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,19,15,5,Pvb-RpJ6USB0-OxXvF_iLA

4844142,2014-11-28,0,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I came across Pot Liquors as I was walking around Town Square the other night. I was checking out the menu when the hostess came out to talk a little about the restaurant. She mentioned they were doing a ""Thanksgiving Meal"". So doing a little more research on the places, reading a lot of positive reviews, I convinced my mom to cancel our original plans and to try this new restaurant instead. Unfortunately that was a big mistake. 

I really wanted to like this place after reading all the reviews on the food and the service. The same hostess that I encountered the other night sat us rather promptly. That was probably the only positive thing about our experience. It all went down hill from there. From the time we got sat, it took 15 minutes for a server to come over and help us. And if it wasnt for the hostess walking by asking us if a server had helped us yet, we'd probably still be there waiting for a server. And it wasnt that busy. Finally a young server named Kristen showed up and took our order. My mom and I ordered the special thanksgiving meal. The drinks arrived promptly. Several minutes later the server came back to inform us that they were out of the butternut squash soup and asked if cream of mushroom would be ok to substitute. I really didnt care either way. 10 minutes after she took our order the soup finally arrived. I wish it would have stayed back in the kitchen. The temperature was luke warm at best. At least I didnt have to worry about burning myself. After finishing our soups another 15 minutes passed before our main entrees arrived. That's probably because they were sitting out for 15 minutes, allowing them to cool down. Not one item of food on the plate was hot. Again, like the soup, everything was luke warm. I pushed the plate to the side and waiting for our server to stop by. Unfortunately she was too busy watching football at the bar. I had to walk up to get her and tell her our food was cold. She apologized and took it back. Maybe a little more than 5 minutes later she come back with new plates. Unfortunately nothing changed. Everything on the plate was still luke warm. The gravy on the turkey was actually congealed. A sign that it had been sitting out and cooled. Again I pushed the plate to the side. This time I got up to get a manager. The plates got taken back a 2nd time. Then the manager came back and asked if we would like something else instead of the Thanksgiving menu. After a few minutes we decided to try it a 3rd time. Before this, the manager came back to try to explain about the turkey and why it was a little cool. The turkey wasnt the problem, it was everything else that was cold. The manager was even on the verge of being argumentative, saying the the chefs personally prepared the 2nd dish and blah blah blah. A 3rd version of the meal came, personally served by the manager. I was hoping that the 3rd time's a charm. But it was the same thing. A cold meal. And this time my mom's plate didnt have the sweet potatoes. Instead it had this sauerkraut looking type side. Still wasnt sure what it was. My mom barely at anything on her plate. I did finish my meal, only because I was hungry. Needless to say we also didnt see the manager stop by for the rest of the night. Guess he really didnt care if we were happy with our 3rd round.

The previous reviewer, Ryan R. I wish I would have had your meal. And while my mom was waiting for me to pay the bill she was talking with 2 couples outside who loved their experience. They said everything they had was excellent. Again, I wish I had their meal instead of what we were served.

Now the million dollar question. Would I go back? Probably not. As much as I want to try their BBQ it is a little on the expensive side. I can get a kick-ass BBQ meal at Jack Stacks in KC, MO and pay half the price. If I do return to Pot Liquors, it will be to have a drink at the bar, just to see a cute female asian bartender who is covered in tattoos. Just because I am in to that sort of thing.

While visiting my best friend in Vegas, he had a list of must-try eatery's for me. Pot Liquor was on the top of his list. Famous for it's ribs, I was excited to sit down and have a southern style dinner. As we walked in, the atmosphere was welcoming and we were instantly greeted. 

Our delightful server recommended I try the the Southern Belle cocktail, which was really yummy and not too sweet. For apps, we ordered the Moinks and Deviled Eggs. Mmm! I wish I had ordered a separate order of Moinks just for myself. They're deliciously addicting! 

We decided to share the entree called Spare Me Baby because the portions are rather large. A plate comes with a mixture of dry rubbed spareribs and baby backs, plus two sides of your choice. I doubled the carbs and got the mac-n-cheese and french fries. Delicious!

I can't quite recall what we ordered for dessert, but I know it was gone within minutes. Delicious food and great service!

ProTip: Check in for a cocktail or app on the house!",lY40797pOt4SbukzQIjZnw,3,1,4,Q8rEtv4_NLBby-lP4vVFFA

This is not some cheap chain, fake BBQ knock off. They don't just smoke something for a little while and finish it on a Grill. This is real authentic Slow Smoked BBQ.

Unfortunately, the service for lunch today was apathetic. It wasn't busy, at all so there is absolutely no excuse for it.

a.  The Location - what an awesome location across from Yard House and near plenty of parking.

b.  The wait time - I have been here now on Friday and a Saturday with little or no wait. What gives?  The restaurant is barely half full on a 6:30 and 7:00 pm reservation?  I don't mind, keep this place a secret!

c.  The food - 
House Made Pork Rinds
Burnt Ends
Pulled Pork Sliders
King Cobb Salad
Memphis Style Dry Rubbed Spareribs
Baby Back Ribs
Smoked Chicken
Texas Style Beef Brisket
Pulled Pork
Hot Links
Kids Bottomless Mac-N-Cheese
Fries
Potato Salad
Cornbread
Collard Greens

All the above we have had on two visits and the very best are the burnt ends, the baby back ribs, the beef brisket.  There is no comparison to this place in terms of the overall quality, flavor and taste. The salad was also very good, and a great compliment to the food.  I cannot tell you more about the bottomless mac-n-cheese as the ribs were so good that our kid did not eat much. It was huge, tasty and also came with fries. We never got to the bottom.

d.  The service - Friendly yet very, very slow. I like the place and the servers and all, just I like a bit of more attentive service and more timely.

My wife didn't love the pork meat salad. She really wanted the smoked turkey wrap but the waitress refused because it's a lunch item. 
Unlikely we'll go back, I hate when a restaurant won't serve a lunch item outside of lunch time and there is nothing comparable on the dinner menu.

Speaking of gracious, the head chef visited each table and when he stopped and chatted at ours we mentioned the fried green tomatoes (we'd already shared the generous portion of burnt ends with 4 different sauces - note, the white sauce was a huge hit!). He remarked how great they were and said hang on, I'll bring some out, on the house. Trust me, they are perfectly prepared and absolutely yummie! For entrees, two of us ordered the full rack of dry rub ribs. Believe me when I say that one order is enough for 4 people!! I love ribs and can honestly say that I have never eaten them without sauce until last night. Their rub is ideal and so savory that putting sauce on them would be a sin.

Food:  4 stars. I had the bbq ribs plate with Mac and cheese and green beans. We also ordered the raspberry lemonade. Lemonade was very refreshing and sweet. The ribs were pretty good. It wasn't super super tender but the flavor was solid. It was smokey, vinegary and sweet. I loved the green beans!  Really garlicy with tons of olive oil = delicious. The Mac and cheese is very creamy but subtle in flavor. Cheese wasn't really overwhelming. I also really liked the corn bread that came with the dish. Add butter to it and you have a sweet Carby delight.  Also we shared one order between two people. If you're not big eaters I recommend sharing.

The four of us made reservations for the 4th of July at 5:15PM.  We showed up prior to 5PM and were seated immediately as the place was empty outside of a few customers seated at the bar and two other tables.  All of Town Square was understandably slow due to the holiday.

Service was so slow.  SLOW!  Unbearably SLOW!!!  Just to place an initial order glass of wine, deviled eggs, and the meatball appetizer seemed to take forever.  We thought we'd start with the Happy Hour specials then order a large platter combo and take home what we didn't eat.

The meatballs showed up first but the deviled eggs didn't arrive for another 10 minutes.  We felt as slow as the service was it could possibly take an hour to get our entrées.  

There was no sense of urgency or 'service' from the staff.  I assume the GM was on vacation and had the 'B' Team on duty.  This happens a lot this time of year and while everybody deserves their time off, they should still ensure that customers can be taken care of properly.  if you can't, just close for the night like 'La Bella Napoli' did.

The deviled eggs are fantastic btw!...  Really Really Good!  Simply the best I've ever had!!!  The bacon wrapped meatballs were too hard, dry, and cold.

The service was great at the bar. The bartender was super nice and very helpful when it came to picking dishes. We chit chatted with him a bit and that always helps an experience. 

Dishes to get:

The pork belly with grits appetizer--amazing. Damn, those grits were delicious. 
The BBQ combos. The bartender said it was for two people. We both ordered one each and he was not a liar. We like leftovers and we got plently. Like enough for 2 more dinners. So at least for the price, you get lots of yummy BBQ. 
I got the rib combo plate and the ribs were super good. I think I like the dry rub a little more than the wet rub. Which is usually not the case. 
Their BBQ sauces are bomb too. 
For sides: Mac & Cheese and the potatoe salad were the best. And their corbread is quite tasty.

Occupying a large space at Town Square and still in 'soft opening' stages it was nearly 9pm when myself and two friends arrived at Pot Liquor Contemporary American Smokehouse and although the hip-hop soundtrack trends a bit too loud while service is still green as well as a bit off-kilter I'm happy to say that nearly everything we tasted was quite excellent, a wide variety of barbeque styles represented with sauces and rubs drawing influence from Alabama and the Carolinas to the Lonestar State and even Kansas City.  Described by director of development Flip Arbelaez as a 'fusion' of styles, both in food and décor, with design concepts ranging from reclaimed barn wood and mason jar chandeliers to a slick marble bar at the restaurant center the majority of our meal at Pot Liquor CAS was paired to sounds far more 'urban' than Southern but looking squarely at the 'cue from a tightly regulated indoor smoker burning a blend of woods low-and-slow at 250°F there was nothing at all to suggest the cuisine to be that of some city-slicker.  Unfortunately sold out of the pulled pork given our late hour of arrival and additionally limited on desserts which, save for a few, are not yet available it was with a focus on the remaining variety of smoked meats that our order was crafted and with our server literally cheering us on in phrases like ""yeah, I like that"" or ""that's totally what I'd do"" it was not long before our order arrived, a single appetizer of crisp but under-seasoned pork belly over buttery ground corn plus a large pair of plates featuring more than enough meat and sides to be shared.  Beginning first with tender sliced beef featuring a substantial waft of smoke but otherwise seasoned in only salt and pepper I'm confident in saying that Pot Liquor already offers the best brisket in Sin City and moving onward to snappy house-made hot links that paired beautifully with the mayonnaise and horseradish white sauce I was again impressed, the somewhat dry spare ribs a small step in the wrong direction though falling-from-the-bone baby backs were a return to form and easily on par with Rollin' Smoke, though commanding nearly twice the price even without accounting for the AYCE option at the longstanding Vegas favorite.  A bit underwhelmed by sides, particularly the skimpy portion of cornbread that commands a $5.95 menu price, it was in a duo of the three available desserts that we rounded out the night and with each option carrying a $6 pricetag the brownie-beneath-a-croissant style bread pudding proved unquestionably a must order, the nearly molten chocolate base well suited to blend nicely with slowly melting ice cream rife in vanilla amidst ample amounts of butter.

Clearly more corporate than the traditional Southern Smokehouse yet innovative in their scientific approach to barbeque with a controlled temperature in-house smoker it will be interesting to see just how Las Vegans respond to Pot Liquor CAS, the high tariff likely to turn some away in a city where good barbeque is sorely underrepresented and many seem satisfied by the swill being turned out by Famous Dave's at less than half the price.  With everything made in-house including brines, bacon, hot links, and a wide array of sauces it should go without saying that these guys are dedicated to what they do and with a high likelihood to only improve with time and customer feedback I look forward to a return visit sometime before year's end - hopefully to find the 'cue consistent, if not bettered by a well seasoned smoker, with sides and the music turned down...or at least tuned to something more befitting the sort of cuisine being served.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,8,3,gpKYPsWujItu6AdGkDq8zw

5309179,2014-09-12,2,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"Husband and I were wandering around Town Square and hoping for a new lunch spot to be there, and voila! There was Pot Liquor! Right across from Yardhouse. 
We weren't sure if it was open, because a.) there was no advertisements and even more important b.) no word of mouth. 
We peeked in and saw a huge bar, and people eating, so yippee!!! a new place to eat. 
    It's BBQ. We love BBQ. Especially for lunch. The drink menu was the best part though. I'm a lover of handcrafted cocktails, and the menu had plenty!!!!
We were warmly greeted by the numerous wait staff, the hostesses, the bartenders, the busboys, and some business men in jeans and blazers (possible owners?) We were informed it was a ""soft opening"" and they were working out kinks.....which, as a slave to the industry, I understand. 
Hubs ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I got a ""Texas dip"". Of course we also had a few cocktails, and ordered the fried pickles. 
Drinks were top notch....high priced though. $10.95 for a mint julep is a little much. Still delicious, and we don't mind paying a bit more for quality. Meals came out before appetizer, but they were working out the kinks, so I forgive. The sandwiches were delicious....obviously they know their North Carolina BBQ, all vinegar based. Tender and flavorful. The BBQ au jus was my favorite part, but unfortunately it was served in a tiny shot glass, so there was no way to ""dip"" my Texas Dip. Waitress brought another tiny shot of au jus...still was not enough. I was full, and figured they forgot the pickles, so I was ok with that. But then, here they were.....fried in catfish breading. Amazing. The dipping sauce was creamy and just spicy enough. I just wish I could have got them before our meal so I could enjoy more than one bite. 
All in all, it was good. I liked the food, but it's a bit overpriced for lunch. I didn't even order sides, if we did, our lunch would have cost as much as a steak dinner in an upscale restaurant. We decided we would come back for dinner...they have half size meals and platters enough to feed the family for decent prices. Plus it's good BBQ. 
Pros: real, slow and low cooked BBQ
         Fantastic beer and cocktail menu
         Waitress ""Dee"" super friendly, knew              
         the menu well.
Cons: asked for a donation for water, yet 
          when we left and tried to donate a few 
          bucks, the hostesses had no idea 
          what to do with the $.
          Way too pricey for lunch....almost $40 
          for 2 sandwiches and an appetizer 
          that was served when we were trying 
          to leave. 
          
Get some real lunch specials, a happy hour that shows the hours in which that happy hour is (not printed on the lunch menu conning your lunch crowd into thinking it was now) and get the word out!!!!

So this place was pretty good but I can't see myself craving to go back. I'm a Certified Kansas City BBQ Society judge, so I've had a lot of ribs and these were good but I've had better.  
The restaurant is cute with the Southern Bluesy feel. Waiters in checkered shirts to go with the picnic style checkered napkins. Staff was friendly.  I wish I could remember our waiters name, he was great. We luckily sat near a friendly couple that offered suggestions based on what they ate. I'm bummed their menu didn't allow for a build your own plate offering. We both wanted to try the chicken but also wanted ribs. There were no options for this.
For drinks I got the ""broken and Bloody"", this drink was right up my alley. Bourbon with a great citrus taste. Loved it. My husband got the ""Southern Belle"", also a good drink but refreshing and sweet.
We ended up sharing the ""Spare Me Baby"" with Mac and Cheese and Corn Bread. So the Baby back ribs were much better than the spare ribs which were overly dry. The Mac and cheese was tasty but also a bit dry, even looking at pics of other Yelpers Mac and cheese, theirs looked creamier. The corn bread was alright as well but didn't have that corn taste like we like, it was more like a sweet cake. The sauces they offer were decent.

He has been several times and loves it although his warning to me was that they are always out of something on the menu. This warning was confirmed by the waitress when I inquired about the fried green tomato salad. They were out of green tomatoes. I ordered the southern chicken sandwich (fried of course) which came with fries. We also ordered the cornbread muffins and burnt ends appetizer. My boss ordered the Carolina pulled pork sandwich. The cornbread muffins came out first with a small dish of honey butter. 4 muffins for $4.50, tasted freshly baked and still warm. I'm from the south and I grew up on cornbread that's not sweet, which is what I prefer, but these sweet muffins were tasty. The burnt ends came out perched on a sliced piece of white bread served along a dish of bbq sauce. The burnt ends were perfectly cooked. They were charred but not bitter tasting, just very well seasoned and crisp. They were equally delicious when dipped in the sweet bbq sauce. My chicken sandwich came out hot and crisp. I gave up on eating it like a sandwich as it was messy and I was eating with my boss after all. The fresh lettuce, tomato and onion were the perfect accompaniment. The hot sauce drizzled on the bun gave it a nice kick as well. The fries were crinkle cut and cooked to the perfect crispy yet soft inside texture. The price for lunch was $50 plus tip. I noticed the iced tea was $3.98, so the prices aren't exactly budget friendly, although still a nice option for a more upscale bbq joint.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,2,4,Ed-2MaGgQKCIQi-9rYnbwA

There was a about two minute wait to be seated and we were impressed with the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant. Although we weren't wowed by the barbecue, the service and atmosphere will warrant a repeat trip in the future.

Jim was our server and he greeted us before we sat down. His attentiveness continued for the duration of the entire meal. The food runner also deserves some recognition. With the delivery of each dish, he provided a detailed description which included particulars about garnishes and side sauces. 

If you're a whiskey drinker, you'll definitely appreciate their selection which is listed on the chalkboard and includes a very extensive list of bourbons not found in most bars. I could see myself sitting at the bar during happy hour sipping some of these whiskeys while snacking on happy hour food.

We started off with the deviled eggs ($6), shared the What's the Beef with the Chicken and the Hog ($35.98) as entree, and had the corn bread strawberry shortcake pound cake cookies ($6) for dessert. The entree was a portion of the brisket, chicken, and pulled pork with the candied yams and mac and cheese chosen as sides. I thought the pulled pork was the best of the three proteins served with a nice vinaigrette on the side. The brisket and the chicken were both overly dry with sauces that could not salvage them. Our pound cake was hard and dry for dessert.

The food

To start

Devil'd eggs.....Bland

Main

The Lord have mercy platter

Baby back ribs, not bad, one part a little dry, but still pretty good.
Spare ribs, very good, probably the highlight of the meal, great dry rub.
Pulled pork, again a little dry, but edible.
Hot links, not really hot, but tasty.

We also added brisket, now this is where the meal fell apart, the waitress managed to not add it to the order, it happens, 30 minutes later and still no brisket, though we have been told by the waitress and the manager that it will be out shortly.

45 minutes or so to get 3 piece of brisket, better be good right, nope, actually, how can I put this, you know the brisket they serve at subway, it's better than this.

But hey, they decided to not charge us for it, because, well they couldn't figure out how to get us 3 pieces of brisket in a timely fashion...In a BBQ place......Seriously, it shouldn't be that hard....I make a point of this, only because the way it was put, they were doing us a favor by not charging us for food that came after everything else had been eaten.

Anyways, the sides were good, the star would be the Collard greens, they were good.

I should also note, they do offer a white BBQ sauce, something most places don't offer, it's good, try it.

Let's get to the food ... Yelpers --  You MUST try the dry rubbed spareribs, yam, and kale slaw!  On our first visit, we ordered the Go Hog Wild and enjoyed the dry rubbed spareribs, pulled pork, mopped baby backs, and hot links!  We even had the honor of touring the BOH and checking out the smoker with General Manager, Francis Carneiro!  What a charming ""monsieur""!  To find out that he has the same birthday as moi,... well, I adore him even more!  LOL!

The 2nd visit (tonight), we saw our favorite ""monsieur"" again and we also met the Director of Restaurant Development, Flip Arbelaez!!!  How cool is that?!  My man and I were raving about the dry rubbed and we jokingly asked Flip, ""What's your secret ingredient?!""  He smiled and said, ""I'll tell ya but I will be right back.""  Yeah, right... we all laughed and we proceeded grinding on our ribs!  

10 minutes later, Flip came back with a piece of paper with the ingredients!  OMG!  How awesome is that?!  Love a chef who shares his secrets!    

The only problem with this place is that the darn trees are blocking the signage so you may drive past the restaurant if you are coming from the main entrance of Town Square.    (Francis:  I know you're reading this!  Make sure you tell your landlord to trim the trees down!)

The deal is only available Sundays 11am-3pm with a pretty small menu. You get a choice of smokehouse hash, chicken fried steak, grilled bacon steak and eggs, and pulled pork waffles. One entree on its own is $13 but for $20 you can include a bottomless bellini, mimosa, or bloody mary! That's a steal compared to many Vegas brunch deals.

The dishes look deceptively portioned. I thought I would be able to finish mine but had enough leftovers for a whole meal! The smokehouse hash was nicely seasoned though the toast was a bit burnt. My friend got the pulled pork waffles and man was the meat tender. The waffle was fluffy as well but the star of the show was that bourbon aged maple syrup...So good.

The drinks were standard but definitely didn't taste super cheap. The bellini was way sweet and the mimosa was nicely balanced.

Service was quick and our waiter was very friendly and seemed to genuinely love the food he was serving! Decor is cute and seemed like a modern country home, with brick walls, tall windows, and even a mason jar chandelier.

We heard some mixed things about the food, but the drinks looked so good! It's a big space with 2 giant mason jar chandeliers, lots of potential. The place was fairly empty, but it was a Tuesday afternoon. We arrived right in time for Happy Hour, 25% off of your entire check was a great deal. We decided on drinks right away, I had the cloud 9 and it was delicious. In fact, I was pretty impressed with all of the drinks that we ordered, they weren't overly boozy, but they weren't weak either. We decided to just have a few appetizers and dessert. 

We started with the pork belly and country grits. I wasn't a huge fan of this, it wasn't super flavorful but the grits weren't terrible. I took a bite or two and moved on. We couldn't resist ordering the burnt ends, but again I found them disappointing. The piece I had was almost all fat and I ended up spitting it out. I then turned my attention to the pulled pork sliders which were OK, nothing crazy good, but definitely one of the better things on the table. We also ordered a side of fries and mac and cheese. I found the mac and cheese to be greasy and the cheddar was too sharp. It did have a nice crust on top, but just wasn't that great. I liked the fries, but it's hard to mess up fries. They were served with a side of Alabama white sauce, which was basically mayonnaise with a spicy component, not a bad dip for the fries. The last side to hit our table was the corn bread. Again, it wasn't terrible, but a little dry and not super flavorful.

Despite the meal, we decided to try a couple desserts because it was happy hour and they sounded so good. We got the strawberry shortcake sandwiches which were again just OK. I found the biscuits to be dense and flavorless, but the strawberry ice cream was surprisingly delicious. We also settled on the fried banana split and it was definitely the low point of the meal. The bananas were corn flake covered and fried to the point of no return, they were brown on the inside and everything about them was burnt. The sundae itself just wasn't that good and I thought it was pretty hard to mess up a sundae! 

It wasn't just the food, the service was also weird. At one point the manager interrupted our server as he was taking our order to question him about another table, which was really rude and unprofessional. It was clear that our server wasn't passionate about serving or customer service. He was awkward and even commented on how much we ordered, which was weird because we didn't order a ton for 3 people and the more we order the bigger the tip. At the end of our meal we waited a good 10 minutes for him to run our credit cards. He was having a conversation with some other servers/managers with our cards in his hand, it was really frustrating. When he came back to our table he started a conversation with us about the Dodgers because my friend's credit card had a Dodgers logo on it. It came out that he used to play for the Dodgers, which is really cool. I think in the end the entire staff needs more training and professional development. The food was bland and just missed the mark. I would definitely skip this place and visit one of the many other food establishments at Town Square.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,2,0,2,NU-JGs6eDl5bzqnzleuhVA

5774192,2016-02-09,3,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"I'm rounding up for AYCE Ribs on Monday nights. My good friend and fellow BBQ aficionado and I decided to try out the rib night after our brunch here a week or so ago. Not at all disappointed. Service from the bartender, and our server were excellent. They even let me back into the kitchen to check out the smoker they use, and talk to the BBQ man. 

AYCE Rib night features Memphis dry rubbed spare ribs, and their Mopped Baby Back ribs, along with a side of Kale coleslaw, mac and cheese and corn muffins. This is actually a great bargain since everything is AYCE, not just the ribs. I'm surprised the place wasn't busier. 

Got there around 530pm so Happy Hour was still on, 50% off specialty drinks, beer specials, etc. Smallish happy hour meal menu. 

The star of this show was definitely the Mopped Baby Back Ribs. Tender, and juicy yet firm just like I cook mine. The BBQ sauce has a sweet taste to it. These were so good, maybe some of the best ribs I've had in town. 5/5

2nd star goes to the Kale coleslaw. A very light creamy mayo and vinegar taste that allows the crunchiness and flavor of the veggies to shine through. Has some cashews mixed in. Normally I'm not a huge coleslaw fan, but I ate 3 portions of this one and took some home as well. Its that good!!! 5/5

Mac and cheese was ok, not overly cheesy or overly maccy (Is that a word?) It was a nice compliment to the meal. 3/5

Memphis Dry Rubbed spare ribs were also nice and juicy, yet firm which is exactly how I make mine. If they fall off the bone there's a good chance they were boiled. These do not. The rub has a nice balance, not too salty or too peppery, and actually has a hint of citrus. Very similar to my own personal rub. Some of the portion we received was smaller ribs and those were a bit dry. The bigger ribs were perfect. 4/5

The one weakness....corn muffins. These just weren't anything special, even with honey butter they weren't that great. I know they can do better here. 2/5.

Overall, a great value for the money, 2 people for $40. Great ribs, killer coleslaw, and excellent service!!",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,8,6,5,KuMQ_JKbIK0Lu9rQGqxaEA

In fact, by the time we told her our drink order, we were already ready to order food, even though she gave us a ""tour of the menu"". 

I ordered the shrimp entree, and it was just okay. We also got the burnt ends, the corn fritters and the sliders, so we tried a fair sample of everything. 

The burnt ends were good, but the meat itself was bland without the barbecue sauce. (Something that does not happen at, say, Famous Dave's.) I didn't try the sliders, but my boyfriend told me they had too much coleslaw on them. The creamed corn fritters were definitely the most disappointing. They basically tasted like the outside of a Hot Dog On A Stick, but without any flavor. They were just bland corn balls, which really disappointed me. Again, the dipping sauce is what made them better. I would have liked if the little fried balls could hold their own without being dipped in the ""street corn/chipotle ranch"" sauce they added...

Overall, we spent about $75 for all of our food + tip, and I don't think we'll be returning. For that kind of money, there are far better barbecue places in Vegas.",CAZw4j1dvBYpBhZq-OdC9A,1,0,2,0ufUcOoMjliCKC8E-ctYZA

The Georgia Margarita still needs work. There's not much peach flavor and the grand marnier should be floated and not just shaken in. At this point is still just tastes like any other margarita.

My friend ordered a piece of Cornbread with Butter and it was 4.50! REALLY! It was just a small corn muffin. For 4.50 I would expect a couple pieces in a basket! Something. The sides start at 5-8 dollars each. Way overpriced. 

I might come back during happy hour. They had a nice selection of appetizers but again overpriced.",zndGpE-vqmLW095DmC9CgQ,1,0,2,olg6gwH9ZjigwmnHbEP05g

Everything else we had was a disappointment.  My husband said it is like the chef used the wrong recipe for his meal (pulled pork looked like chicken?) and my brisket was so like three days old dry.  Good brisket should almost melt in your mouth and be so savory you don't notice the space in between bites.   We did not finish our meals.  We lied and said we were full.  

And perhaps this is because they are new but there was no diaper changing station.  Fail for mamas!

5883947,2014-10-13,3,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"So.... everyone seemed to have good things to say about this place, I might be the only odd one out. We went there on a Friday around lunchtime and the place only had couple tables to start. We were greeted by the hostess and we asked to see the menu first before deciding whether to eat here or not. The menu looked very appealing so we got a table. 

The decoration inside was clean, appealing and very nice. Our server was very friendly and prompt. So why did I give this a 1 star?

We ordered off the lunch menu. DH got the T.L.B ""Tender Loving Bacon"" (10.95) and I got the Shrimp Po' Boy (13.95). And we ordered the appetizer Pork Belly With Country Grits (9.95).  (See the pictures I posted)

The App came out in a decent amount of time, it was only 2 pieces of pork belly on top of some grits, the presentation is nice and the flavors were ok. But come on, it is not worth $9.95 price tag. Before we were done with our app the entrees came out. DH's T.L.B is a joke, size wise, it's like 4 bites and with 2 pieces of bacon and they call it a BLT and charge $10.95 for it?? It probably only cost them $2 at the most to make this at this portion. 

My Po' Boy was decently sized, I got few pieces of large shrimp in mine. The flavor however is lacking. No seasoning whatsoever and the shrimp had a heavy shrimp smell to it (it wasn't very fresh). Both dishes came with a side of cole slaw and fries. The cole slaw did not have flavor, only a touch of vinegar. We both only ate one bite of it and that's it. The fries were good, crunchy and fresh out of the fryer.

Overall, the food just did not live up to the description on the menu and it's way too overpriced. I know this location must have a high overhead but you cannot charge $10.95 for a kid's sized sandwich.",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,5,2,1,ZMNFA2k8jcuJhPXh4cPloQ

The restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived and we were promptly seated. Our server was very prompt in taking care of us and very helpful with suggestions. My co-workers and I started with a cocktail, I had the Raspberry Tart which was very tasty! We then ordered the burnt ends appetizer to start, and we then decided to order a variety of items to share so that we could try a lil bit of everything..... we had the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich, the Texas Dip, and an order of the Macaroni and Cheese. Everything was great- but OMG the Macaroni and Cheese was sooooooo yummy! Definitely a must try!

My wife Lori and I decided to come on a Tuesday because of the 25% off the entire menu and drinks. There was hardly any one there. We were promptly seated and our server Dave came over, he was very cordial and helpful with suggestions.  Before coming there we checked out the menu online and we thought we had a plan on what we were ordering. We both ordered the Pork Belly over grits.  This was one of those dishes that you continually make that mmmmm sound while you're eating. 

We also ordered the deviled eggs which were good also. I ordered the skirt steak over ox tail ragu and Lori stayed from the plan and ordered the Spare Me Baby, which were baby backs, dry rubbed and mopped  spare ribs, that comes with two sides she got the mac and cheese and the fries with Alabama white sauce. When the food came out we were floored at the portion size!  Everything was tasty. My steak was ordered med rare, it was a little tough but manageable. It was served over hoppin johns which were really good. Lori could only eat one baby back and one of the dry rubbed ribs. 
Needless to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, we were so stuffed and we didn't finish it all. Dave came by smiling and offered to pack it all up for us. Overall the meal was great and we plan to visit again and try some other things on the menu. We also tried one of the lemonades too I had the sidecar and Lori had the cucumber one. They were also very good. 
I highly recommend this place, just make sure you are hungry because the portion sizes are huge and you will be stuffed when you leave.",j0ngP80oKolNaDAbkyQC_A,1,3,4,r-LTlBPpVlTmNuGw3ajouQ

Mainly the service - the hostess greeted us instantly and with a great attitude, sat us down immediately, and our server Scotty was wonderfully friendly and did a great job. This was the first time here for my wife and me, and she doesn't normally like BBQ, but *I* do, so she got the Big Cobb Salad and loved it, while I got the ""Go Hog Wild"" combo plate, and I was happy too. The sweet tea was just right, as well. An earlier review said the food comes out less than piping hot, and that's true, so don't dawdle taking pictures of your chow, start eating, and you'll be fine. Big portions, all done well. The pulled pork with the Q3 sauce was my favorite, but everything was very good.

5959845,2014-11-29,3,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,"This is a cute little bbq spot right across from Yard House in Town Square.

I let my friend for happy hour around 5:30. The restaurant was pretty empty, but it slowly filled up as we sat at the bar. The bartender was nice and attentive to us. My friend ordered a drink and I opted for iced tea. 

It took us a while to decide what to order since we were chatting but I ended up ordering some pork rinds from the happy hour menu and a baby back rib salad. The pork rinds were not good at all. Too salty and the texture was completely off. It was too hard to eat. My salad was decent. There was a good amount of rib on it and the Flavors were well-balanced. My friend got the fried pickles and the burnt ends appetizer. Both of these were pretty good. I don't typically enjoy fried pickles, but these were better than most and they were cubed instead of sliced or speared which was a little different than usual. 

Pot Liquor didn't blow me away, but a majority of the food we ordered was good and I'd come back to try out more of their menu.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,3,ZY6ATwg60YOe7LZql2vN4w

However, The BBQ it's self was nothing to write home about. It was good. I am not saying I left anything on my plate. But Rollin' Smoke and John Mull's is light years ahead as far as taste and quality. So if you are shopping at town square, it's a good option.

We started with the Old Fashion for me and Cloud 9 for her from the cocktail list. Both drinks were great, Christian is a top notch bartender who knows what he's doing. Guys or gals should try the Cloud 9 it's the most popular drink there. 

For dinner we ordered the combination platter, Lord Have Mercy. It was amazing, you just don't find BBQ like that around here. It was more than enough for two, probably perfect for three or four light eaters. The spare ribs deserve their own shout out, you can tell good meat when you enjoy it  more without any sauce. Thanks to Doug, the chef, for dropping by, he has really done an amazing job. Everything was great. 

I highly recommend this spot, best of Vegas 2015! And don't forget the mac'n cheese.",oZl_DW5WPFabzj2SYkHOPQ,1,0,5,WjR0smwDZCOeoZbaiaVN6Q
