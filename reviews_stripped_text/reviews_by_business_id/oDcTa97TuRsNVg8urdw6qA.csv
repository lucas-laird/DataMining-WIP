I have a confession to make, I just recently started actually getting into pizza. Before I reached 16, the only pizzas I ever ate were from chains, restaurants/buffets that don't specialize in it and frozen. 

Although I am seeking to expand my pizza horizons, I still love my Papa John's. I haven't had it in a while though, money is tight, Pizza Hut has that $10 deal and a Little Caesars is practically next door to where I live.(I love pizza regardless, but still...)  The sauce is always bursting with flavor, the toppings are awesome(I love their Italian meat pizzas so much) and they ALWAYS give you garlic sauce. Also, the breadsticks are to die for.

I may become a total pizza snob one day, but I'll never have too sophisticated a palate to enjoy a slice from Papa John's.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,0,4,H4pm-nJS4jFOEzPDRyrBAw

2625305,2018-02-02,0,oDcTa97TuRsNVg8urdw6qA,"I sometimes wonder why I put myself through the agony of ordering from this Papa Johns - not the first time this was a disappointing experience.

The pizza is pretty standard Papa Johns - you're not getting anything authentic from any of the big chain pizza shops.  It's quick, easy, and there's usually some type of deal that gets you cheesy bread, chicken, or dessert included. I admit it - when I'm home and too lazy to cook I like a deal. 

So I know I'm getting a pretty basic pizza - but i always hope to at least get what I order. Well, don't count on it here. The frustration at this store isn't the actual pizza, it is the lack of attention to the order.  They either don't read the tickets or don't care - not sure which but it's consistently a problem here. 

Not too long ago I ordered a pizza and checked the box for ""well done.""  I like a bit of brown, bubbly cheese to top my pizza.  I also have a deep aversion to any of that squishy raw dough under the cheese.  The store delivered my pizza - not well done and not brown. It actually seemed kinda raw throughout. When I called, they told me that the oven was broken so they couldn't do a well done pizza cause it would burn. How does a pizza shop not have a properly working oven??  And why did they assume that I would be ok with getting a pizza they knew it wasn't prepared to my order?!  Ugh...

Yesterday, again, I ordered a well done pizza but I received a pizza with the cheese barely melted. It was white and pasty looking. Yuck.  The center was mushy and doughy - just like I DONT like it. 

The deal was to get an order of cheese sticks with the pizza (for less than the pepperoni pizza by itself?). I ordered it with ranch dip. It, of course, arrived with pizza sauce. At first I thought I forgot to change the default sauce choice, then I saw the side of the box - ""Ranch"".  #Fail #FailAgain

So - I guess if you want a PJ Pizza you have two options. 1) accept that your not getting what you order and move on with it or 2) go pick up your own order so that you can check it and make them fix whatever is wrong before you leave.

Or, you can be like me and choose option 3) don't order from this Papa Johns anymore.",EZEezH2Im29jXd6l0W3PfQ,1,0,1,LHJPd49GkM8-kvk2IVgyHw

I had a pizza arrive over an hour late and lukewarm with the cheese already cold and firm. The driver gave me some excuse about ""training someone new"".  When I complained they gave me a free coupon for a pizza. I had ordered a second time from the before I got the coupon and this time it came in 30ish min but same deal, it was dry and not so fresh looking. I eat pizza as a cheat meal so when I do have one I want it to taste good! So I will not be ordering from here again.

3248207,2012-01-08,0,oDcTa97TuRsNVg8urdw6qA,"I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to home delivery, fast food pizza. As long as it's cheesy and bready I am usually OK. We discovered last night that Papa John's actually delivered to our place, even though they are over on Ft Apache, so I thought we would give them a try.

I should point out here that up until last night I had never sampled a Papa John's pizza, however I have often heard them compared favourably to Pizza Hut or Dominoes.

I ordered a Ham and Pineapple pizza and a serve of wings with ranch dip and garlic dip. The pizza arrived more promptly than the 65 minute estimate and the driver was friendly enough.

When I opened my pizza box I was greeted with the sight of something that looked like it had come straight out from under a heat lamp at a food court. Upon eating a slice it turned out to be fresher than it looked, but it was a bit greasy and the sauce was overly sweet and unusual on a pizza outside of the frozen section at a supermarket. The pineapple on my pizza really didn't work well with the already very sweet sauce. I ate a couple of slices and consigned the rest to the fridge for more desperate times. I found myself eating for the sake of eating.

Next I moved on to my wings. I think they were honey chipotle or something very similar. They tasted pretty decent but were extremely gloopy and difficult to eat. They could have done with about 70% less sauce. The garlic dip in particular was a bizarre concoction. It looked like clear, melted butter and tasted weird. Probably not meant for wings, but I'm not sure what it would go with.

Sadly, I think Papa John's is going to have to be given the big miss in future. Of the low-end pizza chains I would have to say that it is easily my least favourite.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,1,0,2,fPqI9g8fQ9SZylHqoV83fg

My first experience with them was about a year ago- I had a coupon for a free small cheese pizza. Okay, it's a free pizza, so I didn't expect much. Except when I got home and opened the box, there was a SLICE missing... I call them up and they had me come back & upgraded me to a large cheese pizza. 

Alright, so I decided to give them another try yesterday, since there was a Memorial Day deal. Ordered a large pizza with 16 wings for carry-out. Said it'd take 15-25 minutes to finish. I arrived there a little over 20 minutes after I placed the order and as I walked in, I get a call from an employee there telling me they did not have any wings and that they had been waiting for over an hour for them to be delivered. Thanks for letting me know earlier! It wasn't until I paid for my pizza that they actually even put it in the oven. 

As I waited for my pizza, I saw a huge COCKROACH the size of my thumb near the drink cooler. But hey, at least it was dead.

They sincerely apologized many times and the manager (I believe) gave me a free order for next time. After seeing the cockroach though.. I don't know if a free meal is worth it.

So 1 star for making up for mistakes, but they shouldn't have to be giving me upgrades and free orders in the first place.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,3,0,1,zdOGgjAb5gXv3gu7HCYP-A

Eh i'll take part of that blame I guess but I wish I had only known that it was going to get more frustrating than expected. I called the store and to verify that my order was still in their system. The guy on the phone was so confused and said that there was no order, but my online bank statement said differently. After calling two other Papa John's the same idiot called at 11:10a and asked If I still wanted the order that was made online yesterday. Well I guess I've waited this long why the heck not at this point. My lunch was at 1p so I requested they bring it around that time, the guy said ""yeah sure"". After calling two more times to verify if the pizza was out for delivery I finally received it at 1:40p (Goodbye 3/4 of my lunch time I didn't want you anyways). If my card hadn't had been already charged for a tip... well there simply wouldn't have been one.

However, we did carry out there this evening and were worse than disappointed. I waited at the counter for 5 minutes with several employees walking by without so much as a word. When I finally got someone's attention the guy was half ass in his attempt to act like he even cared. After paying for the wings & pizza we ordered he tossed the wings on the counter and walked away. I had to flag him down and tell him we ordered a pizza as well.
We got our food home to find the pizza miserably cold and the wings to be incredibly over sauced. I will NEVER go to this PJP again!!! If you want a great PJP experience I suggest the one on Blue Diamond, we've always had great customer service and quality of food at that location.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,0,0,1,1FukCGzC2D6JJiSM9ezAxw

Got my order wrong, delivery girl basically threw the food at us and ran so we didn't realize until she was gone. When I called the girl who answered the phone was rude and put me on hold only to pick up and say she ""couldn't like do anything"" put me on hold for the manager who also didn't know what to do (perhaps have the driver turn around?! Or even apologize perhaps?) . 

Hopefully we will be able to order from a different store in the future or corporate will get a handle on this location. Pizza is really good and vegan friendly so I would hate to not order from papa Johns anymore.",GamSKK0ERfkLlhkSnJc7SQ,2,1,2,0v6c7rY801qn52pfCCuzMA

I called twice to check the status of my order only to be put on hold twice.  Finally about an hour later I drove over only to find a cold pizza with everything clumped in the center.  There was nothing all around 2 to 3 inches from the outside edges.  They had already charged me so all I could do was tell them it was a terrible experience & not a good looking pizza.  (No offer of refund, they already had my money).  Avoid Papa John on-line & at least this location.  Never again for me.
