679719,2014-02-20,1,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,Opened for a couple months then closed down!!! Scammed many people out of their Groupon. And now groupon has to lose money to refund everyone. Shame on this place. Couldn't even last a year and had to resort to scamming.,sVR6XQh9MZc2cpiZmK_lpg,0,0,1,FaYtTyw3zbUYExSbUukDvg

1138715,2013-11-14,2,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,"I was in the area of Rainbow and Spring Mountain ( at Walmart ) around lunch time.  Noticed a sign for Mr. Sandwich with another sign saying buy 3 Banh Mi Sammies, get one free .. .sold!  Not sure when this place opened but they are still putting up signage in the interior of the restaurant.  Also not sure if they replaced another restaurant at this location.

all the sammies are $3.50.  I went with the grilled pork, grilled chicken, grilled beef and house special sammies.

Fairly standard banh mi fillings, decent sized but the bread somewhat average.  The stand out was the grilled pork - probably twice the meat than what i get at Dakao but i give Dakao the nod as to the bread and meat flavor.  Still, i'll give Mr. Sandwich a little slack since they are just opening.  Curious if the buy 3 get one free  deal will be around for awhile.  I believe they also had a pho special, too ( maybe BOGO ) - while waiting for my order i noticed someone else ordering the Pho - about all i noticed was the soup bowl was the size of a mixing bowl - very large !

I'll probably return

1190497,2014-02-06,1,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,"I love ""Mr sandwich"" ; I don't know about this location. All excited I bought a Groupon discount (15 for 30) for ""Mr Sandwich"", Thinking that it's a franchise it was going to be just like the one on Chinatown but unfortunately it only has the same name. We asked few questions about the food and then placed the order, witch it was wrong I asked for spring roll and I got something similar but with no shrimp (they said there's shrimp its just fried) anyway we ate everything including the house special hard breaded sandwich; I was still hungry so I asked for a  BBQ PORK sandwich with softer bread. when it got to the table there wasn't any BBQ meat at all, we asked (I think he was the owner) is this BBQ PORK? He said -""yes"" thats our BBQ PORK- my partner could not hold it back and said out loud -I'm from Vietnam and I know how BBQ pork looks like, and that's nothing closed to- I told my partner not to worry and that I can eat it. Finally when we got the receipt they were charging us for some other spring roll different than the one we asked for, an a  COLD CUT sandwich. We thought it was a little pricey but  WE PAID FOR IT BECAUSE WE ATE IT, NOT BECAUSE WE LIKED IT,  AND WE ALSO PAID TO GET CHEATED BY THE OWNER.

NOT COMING BACK.",l8qzoDkr_PQxaON7tt2tdQ,0,0,2,3z4cQP5JeNrTIOiytFptUw
1676030,2013-12-09,0,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,"I decided to give this place a try. It just open recently and have been wondering what they have to offer.

Their menu has over 100 items to choose from and they also have a separate menu for their boba's and smoothies. The prices also range starting at 2 bucks to 7 and as their grand opening is buy one boba $3 bucks and get one free.

Their combination beef noodle pho is pretty flavorful as well as their combination sea food. 

The main star from this visit where their potstickers, they were crispy and the filling has very good flavor, they pair it with a sweet like soy sauce which just gives it that extra kick. I would definitely be back for more of these.

The staff is pretty melo no attitude to worry about here, the restaurant is really spacious and they have a corner with DJ speakers and lights possibly some karaoke but don't know yet. 


For all those locals out here check the new place out, come and try for yourself and let us know your experience.

So far this visit was delicious and pleasant!",5p3kWmDzPWQypUn3lCzUGw,1,1,4,ThJPGJ8oYn5UvQb-IoBCIQ
1838696,2014-01-27,0,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,I had the chicken pho. I wish this place was a little closer to my home.  Treated great.  Friendly Viet man seated us and took our order.  Quick service!,PlF8xY7nAczBsG5gvjxaWw,0,0,4,YhZvXrbUff5kQQBKQ8oF0A

3015990,2014-01-25,0,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,"I am the biggest fan of the original location in Chinatown. I go there at least once a week and even take out of town guests there. When I saw this place, closer to my house, I was excited until now.

Hours of operation said they close at 9pm. So I stopped by on the way home from the airport (after having flown half way across the country, looking forward to it), only to find it closed at 8pm. I called the Chinatown location, they said they closed it early due to lack of patrons. 

Then I went with a Vietnamese friend and my kids for lunch. The banh mi was cold, crunchy to the point that my kids couldn't bite it, and it tasted stale. The Chinatown location gives you warm, soft banh mi.

Groupon is offering a deal of $15 for $30. I think I'll give this location another chance with the Groupon and try their pho.",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,1,0,2,mJTg8hf_9iHK0GdzGFZFVg

4180937,2014-01-14,1,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,"Their food is not fresh. This is a new location that just opened (since Oct 2013?). 

I was very excited to have a banh mi shop closer to my home, since their other location is in the heart of Chinatown and is decent quality. Well this location does not have quality and freshness or reasonable service. 

I ordered banh mi dac biet (combonation deli meats) and banh mi thit nuong (grilled pork) and 2 smoothies (strawberry and avocado). 

Being that it's a new location, I wasn't sure how to order or if you sit down or what. The man working there was less than helpful. 

I got the sandwiches, bread was stale, pate had a funny taste, and meat was still cold (on the grilled pork). My smoothies was such a dissapointment. My ""strawberry"" smoothie was white in color. I asked him if this is strawberry, he said yes yes yes and rushed me out. My avocado was also white. Taste? Taste of the avocado tasted old (like when you cut an avocade and let it brown, then blend that with milk. Doesn't sound like it would taste good right? It didn't.) When my son drank his ""strawberry"" smoothie, he gagged. I tasted it, it was durian- very far from strawberry. Andrew Zimmerman would be pissed ;) 

Overall, I would not come back. I don't want to pay for potential food poisoning and get something I didn't order. I regret not taking a picture.",afPCWrV8oLpfFYs5hPZWtg,4,1,1,spzMYdJT9Jde26HqAsAGAQ

5051443,2014-02-11,1,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,"It's been open 3 months now and in this short span they're definitely going downhill. 

The first few weeks there was this guy that worked the front which I originally assumed was the owner, but he hasn't been in a long while and I see the same people now. I think they're friends or family that run this one and that guy was only here to open but manages the original. It was better when he was around. 

Well, I just got a sandwich and the soft bread that I am a huge fan of from the original location on is no longer. It's really crusty like how Lees are. A bit of crust is fine, but this is the type of crust that makes the edges of your lips feel a bit raw.

The broth tasted a little odd, the meat had a weird taste that wasn't fresh...and the worst part was that all the vegetables minus the lime were old. The bean sprouts were not a crunchy white but dirty and old as though they had been in a bag in the fridge for 2 weeks...it was almost embarrassing. Bean sprouts are insanely cheap, change that out, Boss.

The leaves of the basil were turning dark in many spots and even the onion that was already in the soup when it arrived wasn't fresh. 

Even with a groupon I won't be coming back...embarrassing to bring out a plate of old vegetables.

5908556,2014-02-03,0,mkhjTkDlEqQGP-1IzfyN7g,"If you've never had viet food before you might not realize how bad the food is here.  The Pho broth has a funny aftertaste and the banh mi bread is not fresh or typical french baguette. They also forgot the bean sprouts/basil, sriracha/hoisin sauce to boot on my to go order. I gave them several chances since they opened but it has gotten worse over time. The only positives was their grand opening prices, but that too is gone.  Unless something changes, they wont be here in 18 months either. 

1 block away is Pho Saigon near Greenland. $1 more, but way way better value and taste.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,1,RCrdhd-iNF3XNloMGUyzDQ

There are lots of tables, wifi and even a little stage that looks like it's ready for karaoke, but I could be wrong. They are still putting the finishing touches to the restaurant, but it's coming along nicely.

For their grand opening they have quite a few specials going on. $4.95 pho and BOGO thai and milk teas, which I took advantage of. The drinks were solid and so was the food. Again, the bread wasn't doing it for me. Unlike the original location, the bread was a little crustier and not as soft and fresh as I like. For the most part, everything else was great.

I'll be back since I'm in the area pretty often and look forward to giving their sandwiches another try as well as the rest if the menu.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,3,RFSXabAc2zVNX6H-Z50HjQ
