99966,2015-09-13,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"This is hands down the BEST sushi restaurant I've been to thus far. We're talking better than Yama, Kaizen, Sushi Mon and Jjanga. They are fairly new in town so I can only hope this continues to be the case after they've become more popular. 

The friendly, warm service was better than expected. This one guy Richard, who seemed to be the manager, constantly came over to check on me and other guests. Based on my initial orders, he asked if he could recommend a couple dishes which were the specials of the evening. I've never had this happen before during an ayce experience.

There is soft lighting, dark tables and chairs and music that wasn't loud enough to get annoying. This would make a good place for a date. The sushi bar was the most spacious I've seen to date and with plenty of elbow room between chairs.

My picks for the evening:

*Screaming Orgasm: Lightly seared tuna over a bed of radish with some ""O"" sauce.
*Salmon Tar Tare
*Poke Salad
*Evening specials (sashimi): Super white tuna & yellowtail. Both with jalapenos. 
*Rolls: Big Easy, Dancing Eel, Kiss of Fire, Burning Your Stomach 

After demolishing said dishes, I polished off the meal with a refreshing order of their Yuzu Sorbet. Part of me wanted the honey bread but nobody needed to see me get assisted out the door. 

For $26 buckaroos for dinner, it can't get better than this. Also, don't forget your stamp card. Your 11th ayce is on them. I will be back at least once before the end of this month.",GLp5vueztLtd8HtcvqvhBw,6,0,5,aNNxl87juf_hWjWMSUP5Kw

240674,2016-02-13,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Sushi way wasn't bad but it wasn't mind blowing, either. It was so-so. 

I wish they had a half star. I think three stars is too low but four stars rating is a bit high. I give them 3.5 stars. 

The sushi nigiris were okay. I think, the best one would be the super white. However, the consistency in making it isn't constant. My first nigiri had just a bit of spicy drizzle on top. My second nigiri was soaking in sauce. :/

In terms of freshness... the fish on the sushi nigiris did taste like they kinda had been on ice for a few hours. For ex. the salmon nigiri was kinda dull in complexion, it wasn't shiny. It tasted a bit milky but wasn't as milky as the other ones I've tried in other Ayce. 

The tuna in the tuna salad had a weird consistency. Unlike chopped tuna I've tried before... their tuna was kinda gelatin in consistency. It didn't taste bad but the consistency was throwing me off.

I also tried their sushi nachos. I think that's my favorite out of everything I've tried. However, they soaked it too much with sauce. :/ They should just have a side sauce for the sushi nachos. 

Because of reviews online... I ended up wanting to try their honey bread. OMG. It was super sweet. They shouldn't have drizzled it with honey and then chocolate syrup. The bread itself was already sweet. I should have just ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream. Sigh. 

Service was fast, which I was happy about. However, they weren't that busy that day.",HdR-lOoagkl4pQC-xvBlyQ,0,0,4,fijSyIjYE7LPe7U0ifD6_g

On a tight schedule, our party of 8 showed up at 8:05 PM for an 8 PM reservation. We came to find a completely full restaurant and no host at the stand. When I could finally get the attention of a staff member, we were told a party had come in 5 mins before us claiming to be me and swiped our reservation. The restaurant was unwilling to move the party even though they had not placed any orders, and we were forced to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting, we were told again we couldn't be helped. We were never offered any compensation (discount, free drinks, etc) or even a simple apology for the inconvenience. The restaurant staff was unwilling to accept any blame for the incident and did 0 to alleviate the situation. We eventually were forced to leave hungry due to our tight schedule. 

Although I live close, I will never return to this restaurant, and I will do my best to make sure no one I know goes there either.",IAYef6rU9TZL-HiYzO0wTg,1,0,1,CYt-f9qze-BeZbdh-ZTvqw

Not this place. you literally have the whole freaking menu at your will to devour without hesitation. COME WITH AN APPETITE.

499752,2017-05-26,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"I'm not sure why this place has received such good reviews.  Frankly, my experience was underwhelming, to say the least.  The appetizers selection was fairly wide, though the few good items were limited to one order per person (like oysters, and random for a sushi restaurant, galbi).  Nigiri selection was overall decent, though the uni was suspect (had a weird dark mustard color and sure enough, tasted odd).  Overall, fish was OK, though the salmon belly did stand out. 

I'd be willing to come back here again, until I realized there are better and more affordable options (read: Goyemon Sushi, despite the always long wait).  Service was probably the deal breaker.  I basically had to stack all the empty plates to the edge of the table for someone to notice and come remove them/take new orders.  For an AYCE sushi place, there seemed to be a lot of resistance to our party ordering more food.  After our first initial order, we wanted more food, but was met with the waitress asking if we're gonna ""finish all that food""?  Uh.. YEAH, we just barely started!  Another time we ordered, the waitress warned us that we have to eat all the rice that comes with the nigiri sushi.  She must have spotted the roll of rice that was left on my friend's plate.. the same one that dropped on the table beyond the five-second rule and she decided to not eat.  Thought that comment was unnecessarily passive aggressive.  Lastly, when it came time to dessert, it was only one order per person.  Good thing there were a few of us so we were able to each order different things and share.

I get that being a server isn't the best job out there, but as the millennial I am, I feel bad constantly asking serves to do their job lol and it was nice not to feel like a burden. I didn't have to ask for anything twice (god forbid) and they were all just sweethearts about everything. 

The atmosphere of the place itself was nice. It was fairly calm and not too big. It is a spacious but cozy place. Definitely a new go to spot for sushi in Vegas.",vG_iJjF8Pwwu6PYd1cAkWg,0,0,5,rwEvqQNr4Lf-Xx9amjsPrA

She then asked me to hold for a second after I answered her. I felt odd because she was one question away to complete my reservation (my name) but anyway. I eventually hanged up after 6 minutes of hold. I waited for 15 minutes to call again. Again, I was asked how many and what time and ""hold a second"". I was like again?? wth??!! Good that a second lady came to the phone and took my reservation this time.

Our waiter was nice enough but they are definitely short staffed. There were only 2 waitstaff on a Saturday night. We had hard times getting help for anything.

The food. It's not super bad per se as none of us got sick after. But for sure it's not 4 1/2 stars worth. The rice are a bit dry. The fish tasted obviously frozen and thawed. The rolls were lack of flavor. They are all so bland even with different sauces. One of the rolls we had was called ""Burn your Ass"" of something like that. It wasn't even spicy at all. 

I had hot tea to start with. Since the service was so slow and I never got my tea refilled, I decided to order a soda. When the bill came, I was shocked to find out they charge $2.50 for hot tea. Mind you it's only some generic luke warm green tea. Well, the soda was also $2.50 which I expected. But generic green tea, which they were too busy to refill, for $2.50?? 

I suspected most of the good reviews are from out of towners. Most of the cities in the US do not have as many AYCE sushi restaurants as Vegas. With 90% of the sushi restaurants in Vegas are AYCE, we are spoiled and picky. I'll stick with my favorite Sushi Neko from now on.",H9GF0cyfoWdkOjVm44xfFg,0,0,2,Pv7PcanfYY1RaYRClBroyg

817621,2017-10-20,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Came here last night (Wednesday) for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) offering. It was $26.99/person. 

Service was very good. They were attentive and took my order quickly. There were minor mistakes (salmon hand roll wasn't placed the first time and they split up the check wrong but both were corrected quickly). 

The oysters, galbi, seared tuna slices, uni nigiri, and sweet shrimp nigiri are only allowed 1 order per person which was ok due to price.

Oysters were decent (fresh enough, flavor good) but considering place and price, I'll say it's very good when it comes to bang for buck. 

Uni and sweet shrimp was excellent in freshness and flavor. 

Galbi was a lil over cooked (I like my beef bloody) for my taste but still very good. 

The seared tuna slices was called Mouth Orgasm. I find it ok. Flavor was fair. Found the sear good enough. 

Nigiri: Salmon roe wasn't good. The roe was a bit dehydrated. The yellowtail was good. Garlic yellowtail was delicious. Perfect balance of garlic and fish. Seared salmon was good but not mind blowing. The eel was excellent. Perfect sauce, eel, and rice balance. Halibut was ok. It was a lil tough for nigiri. Surf clam was very good, fresh and not tough. The fresh scallop was good. The mackerel itself was very good but unfortunately drenched in way too much vinegar that made it too sour and the rice was about to fall apart. 

Rolls: I didn't have the one roll but I had a piece of the soft shell crab roll. That one was very good. 

Handroll: Salmon skin was good but not my thing. I'm used to a lightly floured and fried savory salmon skin, really crispy in a handroll. This one was only slightly crispy drenched in some sweet, soy based sauce. The flavor was ok but I didn't like the sauce completely drenching the seaweed, making it soggy. If they didn't put so much sauce, I think I'd like it so much more and I'd highly recommend. 

Seaweed salad: Would've been very good if the vinegar base sauce wasn't so sour. Need to not put so much sauce on things!

Tempura ice cream: I really enjoyed it as the fried batter was decently light. The ice cream was average. Overall, was too sweet for my taste but I still loved it. 

Overall, I took away a star due to them putting way too much sauce on vinegar based pieces that made it hard to eat. From a bang for buck perspective, this place is definitely a 5 Star. Most things were fresh and for a AYCE, the fish quality was really good. It's expected that they don't use Japanese sushi rice with mirin. I've gone to numerous AYCE Japanese buffets in Hong Kong and US. This one has pretty good bang for buck ratio.",DGvK-cA0Ji5_GQt7eIWe4w,0,0,4,gA3OpYfhAq5hsEmn64fCJA

I thought the sushi might be pre-made, but it's to order. There were a couple of rolls I ordered that came with crab but it was more of a crab 'salad' - I was a bit surprised but it was still very good. The wait can be a little long after you put in your order, but that's not atypical when you're eating sushi.

What would have been a 5 star review - if based on food and value - became a 4 star because of the service inaccuracy. We ordered twice and both times the server forgot to put in one of our rolls with the kitchen.",83mixvCXrq2Ygiv8Ufg2pg,0,0,4,rMAIiZyDvFbBK4i8NyJpPQ

Based on our sushi palate, if we were ordering a la carte, we would've passed the $30 mark like, 5 rolls ago. The beer/wine/sake selection is limited, but priced ridiculously low and the selections they have are the ones they SHOULD have for a sushi joint. Next is food quality. We ordered all the good nigiri and a few specialty rolls. Without exception, the fish was amazingly fresh, and the pieces were huge!  If you've never had the Poke Tuna Salad, order it!!!  Awesome!   
Finally, the service. We say at the sushi bar. It is the only way to fly--especially for a twosome.

I was already expecting it to be pretty bad because it is AYCE, but this was un expectable. The octopus was not fresh or anything near it! When I told them it was bad and I couldn't eat it, they told me it's probably too fresh for me. That is not what it is, I eat sushi every other day because I love sushi and that's why I work in the field. Plus if fish was so fresh why would it be AYCE, it would not. Not to mention there was 3 servers that day with 4 tables and they were so slow, when I asked them about it they said it was super busy earlier. But what about now, we still need things. Over all I recommend going somewhere else for sushi, I felt sick afterwards, all my friends did. Let me save you and your stomach, don't go!",wQWgS05sbHa8QvBDNIz4-Q,0,0,1,i0wAO1eBJ1wn-W6U3xaBQg

I don't know how it works in USA But i think that possible ingredients causing allergy should be written on the menu. 
I read on menu salmon tartare, that it should be simple salmon cut in small pieces. Instead, I received salmon on avocado and Cramp. 
As I realized there was cramp, I had already eaten a bit because it resembled rice .
So I had to immediately take a pill of my medicine to prevent an allergic attack .

1230040,2018-06-06,4,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"(Review based on 2.5 stars)

Sushi Way is located in the same plaza as Tacos & Beer (right next to it actually) with parking. My husband and I decided to try this place on our last night in Las Vegas, for dinner. We came in for an early dinner around 5:30 pm. When we first came in, no one greeted us. A server walking around saw us but did not greet us. We were just standing around and decided to just seat ourselves at the bar. 

As we sat there, we just waited. Eventually my husband asked the guy behind the bar (Mike) if he could take our order. He said he can only take sushi orders but not for the kitchen. I just kind of thought he would assume that we were here for the all you can eat option (pretty much as everyone else when they come in here...). My husband asked if he would take our order after he said that... 

Anyways, during the course of our meal, service was initially average and lacking. But eventually 2 other servers came out and took care of patrons, including ourselves. I appreciate their attentiveness. Also eventually that guy, Mike, left to do inventory and this other guy came and he took care of us. 

Everything we had was good, except for the uni. It was not fresh and had that fishy smell. You do not want your seafood to have that smell, if it does, it indicates it isn't fresh. 

If service was better, I would award this place higher, but because of the lack of service in the beginning and a little after, I have no choice but to give this place 2.5 stars.

If you like being ignored and not being acknowledged, come by here for sushi. And then when you are done eat somewhere else. Being that this is Sin City, the land of buffets and gluttony, I am sure there is a better place to eat at.

By the way, for 2 people for dinner (all you can eat option), it will cost you $58.35 (tax included).",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,7,4,2,LLXwxzSO9cXEto-ggUovAg

1274652,2018-03-17,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"I had high expectations for an ayce sushi restaurant with ratings as high as Sushi Way. Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow during our visit which was disappointing. 

Objectively speaking, the food was great! The fish was really fresh and they carried a lot of unique options I haven't had at other places (like garlic hamachi). The uni/amaebi (one serving per customer) are a must! 

Our experience was sub par due to the service that we experienced during dinner. The management should try to staff the restaurant accordingly every night. For a Friday night, you would expect more than 2 sushi chefs to accommodate customers, but the lack of staff resulted in a 40-45 minute wait for our first order of food. The server was courteous enough to provide 2 complimentary bottles of sake, but it wasn't enough to make up for the lack of service. Shout-out to the staff for working hard to make up for their inadequate management.

Super white tuna sashimi w/ jalapeño - fish was fresh and the mixture of sauce and jalapeño was good. It wasn't salty at all.
Wasabi tobiko - I actually liked it. Tasted fresh and different than most things I eat at sushi spots.

Appetizers:
Screaming Orgasm - This was ok. The fish was different than say sushimon.
Fresh oyster - it was fresh and good
Coconut shrimp tempura - I loved it.  It was flavorful :)

Rolls:
I love my ass - good
Snow White - good
Jack Rabbit - good

Nigiri:
Salmon Roe - average. Same quality you would find in most restaraunts at their level
Garlic Tuna - it was fresh. Didn't really care for the salt or spice they out on top of it.
Salmon - kinda tasted like Scottish salmon. It melted in my mouth! 
Yellowtail - it was average
Fresh scallop - it was average
Sweet shrimp - it was average

The tempura ice cream was the same like you would get at most spots.

Order a whole bunch of things but what stood out included the sashimi salad, the rock n roll cucumber roll, and the seared salmon nigiri. Overall the nigiri and rolls were pretty fresh and generous with the seafood. The sushi tacos were interesting but perhaps a bit too tart.

Only one sushi chef and several tables were occupied, so the wait for  your order was a few minutes.  Once the 2nd sushi chef arrived, everything went a lot faster.  Our waitress was very attentive and courteous.

Nigiri sushi tasted very fresh.  Cuts of fish were pretty big, while the rice was kept to a minimum.  

We had a desert called honey bread, using Hawaiian sweet bread dinner rolls.  Shokudo in Hawaii uses something like Texas toast.  Similar in taste, just not quite as big.

Usually I walk out of an ayce sushi place feeling full and uncomfortable.  This time I felt satisfied and just right.  Very comfortable atmosphere.

I was even more impressed that the chef kept making items that were off menu! I was game for anything! 
I love that this place doesn't use a lot of cream cheese in their sushi as fillers! If I want to eat cream cheese, I have lots in my fridge! LOL

In terms of taste, this place is really good. It also has an impressive menu. I liked the fact that they gave us an AYCE and a regular menu. The food is what has me giving this place 4 stars. Favorites from what we ordered: Tuna Poke Salad, Seaweed Salad, Yolo Special Roll (love the fried onions on top to compliment/balance the roll), Chicago Fire Roll (had enough spice for the boyfriend), Japanese Lasagna Roll (always a fave for us), Honey Bread (reminds me of a cinnamon roll with ice cream instead of frosting), and the fried Tempura Ice Cream (tasted like Fruity Pebbles Cereal).
Honestly knocked one star off 'cause of customer service we experienced early in our dinner. It was nice to be greeted and seated right away. What wasn't cool was waiting for a waitress take our order about 10 minutes after we had been given water by the initial host to the evening. Umm... We didn't have our phones out, distracted from looking at the menu. 
I will admit that it got slightly better after getting our appetizers, but when we were trying to order the sushi, the waitress was nowhere near our table. 
I look up and around the restaurant for her, and she's at the cashwrap area, leaning against the counter or whatever, talking to the host that seated us. The boyfriend said he observed her there for awhile, but just didn't want to point it out to further irritate me. 
I was about ready to leave when a waiter we hadn't seen earlier came by to get a sushi order. Big thanks to that gentleman. We never got 1 order of sushi I asked for, but no biggie 'cause he checked up on us more than our waitress, who I only saw pick up our plates, not saying a word to us.

1596399,2015-12-17,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"I was hesitant to really believe all the 4 & 5 star reviews for this venue as I've seen those types of reviews in the past where the venue did not live up to the hype. Well I have to say that Sushi Way really does live up to the 4-5 star reviews. Went in with a group if 10 people tonight with having made a reservation ahead of time. Table was all made up for us. The restaurant was not busy at all until toward the end of our meal which was about 2 hrs after we arrived. We all ordered the AYCE & ordered lots of things & I'd have to say that almost everything was fabulous. I didn't get pictures of everything we ordered but I'd have to say we had about 10-12 more items ordered than what you'll see in my photos. Some of the rolls are the same rolls from I Love Sushi which I thought was great because I love the Cherry Blossom just wished Sushi Way's version had the crunchy like I Love Sushi's Cherry Blossom does. Really loved the Salmon Tar Tare, tuna nigri, yellowtail & Rock & Roll roll.

From what I recall we ordered:
Nigri: Tuna, Salmon, Super White Tuna, Yellowtail, Garlic Tuna, Ebi, Unagi, 
Albacore, Seared Albacore, Octopus, Squid, Fresh Scallop, Uni, 

Sides: Poki Tuna Salad, Screaming Orgasm, Shrimp Tempura, Coconut Shrimp Tempura, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Sweet and Spicy Dumpling, Salmon Tar Tare, Calamari Tempura, Fresh Oyster, Baked Green Mussel, Sushi Nacho

Rolls: Spider Roll, Dancing Eel, James Bond, Cherry Blossom, Rock & Roll, Burning Your Stomach Roll, Mexican Roll, Candy Cane Roll, Lisa Hand Roll, 
I Love My A Roll 


Pros:
 - Nigri was super fresh. Tuna was fabulous. We ordered about everything on the nigri list as well as serveral ""side dishes"" as they like to call the appetizers. 
 - Super friendly service & they were on top of service almost the whole evening until the end. 
 - Like the fact that you can order 1/2 orders on rolls all through meal & not just the last roll you eat. 
 - Allowed our group to have the 10% off locals discount for their Christmas special.

Cons:
 - Table placed vertical to wall didn't leave enough room for 10 people to sit comfortably without bumping elbows. Wishing the table would have been placed parallel to the wall with three 4 seat top table tops. 
 - Shrimp heads were undesirable as they were over cooked & you could tell the oil was not hot enough when they were fried & oil tasted old. 
 - Oyster on the half shell seemed to have been pre-frozen. They just didn't taste fabulous.
- Towards end of night it seems that our table was being ignored as 2 rolls had been forgotten that were ordered as well as desert for 2 people was forgotten & it took over 10 minutes to get it while everyone else had already eaten their desert. 

Although the Cons list may look longer than the Pros list the cons will not deter me from coming back to Sushi Way. It's definitely on the ""repeatable"" list.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,0,4,Ac-XvAwzmG6_AZuhR75ONQ

Flavored were spot on.  My favorite roll of the night was the ""I Like My Ass""!!  Yes indeed, soft shell crab that had great flavor a!

One of my tests for a new sushi joint is to see if they have fresh wasabi.  This is key in great sushi joint!  Ever since I was introduced to it by a very close friend and sushi chef it is the tell tale of a place in my book.

The attentiveness of the staff was bar none phenomenal!!

Food: 
Fish was super fresh! I was in such shock since we are in the middle of a desert eating super fresh seafood. The rolls were well made. The sides were just as good. Must orders: Tempura, sweet shrimp, uni, salmon kama, salmon belly and scallop roll. 

Service: 
Super friendly staff who dropped by every few minutes to check up on us. 

Environment: 
This is set away from the strip. The place can fit 50 - 75 patrons. Plentiful parking and easy to get to. 

Price:
$28 for AYCE!! This is top notch quality sushi...I don't quite understand how they can charge $28 for all this. 

I will be back! Perhaps everytime I'm in Vegas....

1701328,2016-05-21,12,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Sushi Way is on the higher end of average for AYCE sushi in Vegas- service was great and most fish was decently fresh, but the rice was oddly wet and dense, which significantly detracted from my enjoyment. From reading other reviews, I was expecting more riceless options here, and though they weren't clearly marked, the few I found were good.

APPS: the poke is decent with seaweed, ahi, and a lot of onion in a sweet-spicy sauce, BF really enjoyed the coconut shrimp tempura, the tartare was interesting, screaming orgasm was quite small compared to others' orders?
NIGIRI: aside from the aforementioned rice issue, most fish seemed pretty fresh but some pieces were bland. Specials were pretty basic (fishy-tasting yellowtail with jalapeno, yuzu tobiko), salmon is my preferred fish but I didn't even request a second order because it didn't have much flavor... almost tasted like it had been frozen?
ROLLS: This area of the menu seems to be their forte, the ""Sushi Nachos"" would probably be more appropriately placed in the apps category but was my favorite. Lisa hand roll could use a sauce to perk it up but was one of the healthier options. The DD and Candy Cane rolls recommended in other reviews were typical, the YOLO seemed unique and yet flavor was lacking and fried onions were old and hard. 

I always recommend sitting at the bar, the chefs and server were super friendly. I don't know if it's their location or if they're just really popular, but they got crazy busy- recommend arriving early, as they were empty at 6PM and started a wait list around 7PM.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,15,3,DlWCmsRARKabjM7h5L_SYQ

Starting with the nigiri - we first ordered eel nigiri. I absolutely love eel but it was drowning in eel sauce & eel tasted off. There was a lot of bones in eel which greatly detracts from the flavor. Salmon is my preferred fish but didn't even request a second order of salmon nigiri since the rice-to-fish ratio was so bad.

I ordered few of the no-rice rolls which were a no-go. When my ""rock & roll"" sushi came in (which is tuna , salmon , white fish , yellowtail & crab wrapped in cucumber) , the fish tasted frozen , there was waaaay too much crab (more crab than the actual tuna , etc.) & the cucumber was thick cut + orgasm sauce all on top tasted terrible. I didn't take a photo of mine but my ""rock & roll"" did not look like any of the photos other Yelpers have posted in the past which looked way better before.

We also ordered a few baked & deep fried rolls. It was hard finishing them even when we ordered half rolls. Did not taste as good as their descriptions sound. 

I really wanted to enjoy the other menu items such as ""salmon tar tare"" in appetizers section & ""volcano roll."" The orange/yellow sauce + sriracha on top of salmon tar tare was not a good combination. ""Volcano roll"" (which is also part of their no-rice rolls) could've been decent since I love avocado but the spicy tuna + crab inside tasted pretty much almost frozen too.

Service was bit slow but I can't blame them since they seem short staffed - during lunch looks like only one waiter , one food runner/busser & two sushi chefs. AYCE prices same like any other place/competitors - about 22$ for lunch & 27$ for dinner. However , I'd suggest trying out other places :(",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,3,2,2,KioetRWvI01Dko24wZneag

The waitor was very friendly and suggested popular items from the menu which was very helpful.  I chose to have the all you can eat special that costs $26.95 @ night which was pretty resonable.  I came around 7:30pm and was seated immediately.  20 minutes later the entire restaurant was filled!  The sushi rolls were pretty good.  I had the Big Easy Special, Salmon Killer, and I love My Ass. Of those the Big Easy Special was my favorite. They made a mistake on my Unagi and gave me a Unagi roll instead of Nigiri.  The Flavor of the unagi was good but it was slightly burnt and crispy.  Not really how Unagi is supposed to be cooked.  For Nigiri I had the Salmon, Garlic Yellow Tail, Ikura, Unagi.  My biggest drawback to this spot was that it was extremely slow during 8pm (Peak Time) So I wouldnt reccomend coming here during this time.  I would assume 10pm might be better.  It would be less crowded and you wouldnt have to wait a long time for your food.  On average I waited 20 minutes between orders.

I could tell you I only ordered one thing off of the menu. That after that, we began talking and he learned I appreciated authentic sushi, with minimal flavoring, much more than the hyper saturated ""American sushi"". That for the rest of the night not a single thing I ate came off the menu, but was custom made to fit my palette and preferences. But none of that does the night justice.

As soon as we began talking he began imparting wisdom along with every dish he gracefully handed to me. As though to feed my soul along with my stomach. He learned I was a photographer and most everything he said thereafter he tied into photography or what he knew of me. I wish I had recorded everything he said (he reminded me of my grandfather), but I will do my best to paraphrase the many things he shared with me:

""Say...hundred cooks learn to make one dish. But maybe only 20 learn to make it another way. Just like photography. One subject. All photographers take one picture. But you see one thing and you see ten things. Ten angles. You make ten things out of one thing. This is cooking.""

""People grow up eating fast. Fast food. We don't think about what we eat we just eat it. We don't think about life we just live it fast. Then we get old. Then we think about what we eat but it is too late. We think about how we live but it is too late. Slow down. Eat slow. Live slow. Appreciate everything slowly. Enjoy.""

""Beauty...beauty is an interesting thing. Beauty leads to jealousy. Jealousy leads to anger. Anger leads to hurting people. We must not hurt people. We must see beauty and appreciate.""

""Don't do something you don't like. Love what you do. Find what you love and use it to make other people happy.""

""You work hard, you come here and I take care of you. You relax. You enjoy. I like to make people smile.""

""We can't just hear. We must understand. I say something to you. Tell me what I said. Understand it. If you don't understand it you did not hear it. Don't hear what people say. Hear ideas.""

Gladly, she enjoyed the food aside from the shitty service. Unfortunately, my all you can eat dinner was an unpleasant event. The amateur chef loaded my nigiri with fat portion of rice. The ratio was about 3 to 1.  Fish was cut so thin it looked like paper. I felt that he was trying to get me full fast so we can get the hell outta there. My kitchen order came quicker than the sushi that I ordered first. This tells ya how slow this so called chef was. By the time I asked for the check the chef had a disgusting smirk on his face.

The waitress gave us only a couple minutes before asking if we were ready. This was obviously our first time here so we politely told her we needed a couple more minutes. That didn't stop her for checking in every five minutes until we finally ordered.

My friends and I decided to only order a couple rolls since we weren't super hungry for AYCE. I ordered the TNT roll which was good, but we had problems when it came to my Candy Cane roll. The description stated that it would have spicy soft shell crab, spicy crab, cucumber and tuna and yellowtail ( I think) on the outside. Well, when I got my roll it was super tiny, not even as big as a quarter! I saw the cucumber on the inside but it was surrounded by regular imitation crab! Sushi is my favorite food by the way guys so I know the difference between spicy crab, regular crab, and soft shell crab. 

I decided to try one piece just to be sure, but sure enough there was no soft shell crab and there was no spice at all! I politely tell our waitress that I believe the soft shell crab is missing and she takes my plate away to talk to the sushi chef. However, when she returns to the table she asks me, "" Do you even know what soft shell crab is?"" Then she explains that the chef said that there is soft shell crab in there and I should be able to taste the crunchiness throughout the roll. 

I am not an idiot! I should have taken a picture for evidence but it seriously just looked like a California roll with no avocado and tuna/yellowtail on top.

- Cherry Blossom (for avocado lovers)
- Bacon scallop skewers & Baked green mussels
- GARLIC YELLOWTAIL

I complained to both the chef and the waiter but they did not do anything and still charged me for both rolls. I understand sometimes the food and the wait staff are not in sync so I usually let it go, but I spoke with both parties with no result. I'm very disappointed with the experience.

After we got our seats we waited about 15 mins before someone took our order. After ordering we asked the server what rolls that they gave us were and she had no idea what it was. If your server doesn't even know what it is how do you expect me to know if it's the right one? We just dismissed this and just said its ok and she just told us to eat it, that it's good. 

As far as the quality of the food, it's ok but I've had better. I had the Arizona roll and Sunny Special. The Arizona roll had yellowtail, cucumber and avocado which was topped with yellowtail. I definitely enjoyed the Sunny Special more which had crab and was topped with salmon and a lemon slice, the lemon was too strong for my liking but once I took the lemon off the rest was enjoyable. I also ordered the poki tuna salad which was probably my favorite thing I ordered.

After eating we told the waitress that we would like our check, I guess she didn't hear us or forgot because she walked around for like 15 mins and then came back without the check and asked if we wanted anything else.

In an AYCE setting the owner and the customers' objectives are polar opposites. The owner wants to limit his/her damage without being too obvious. As I get older quality takes precedence over quantity, but I keep forgetting that.

The good:
Sea urchin is fresh, the salmon has a rich taste. The waitress is nice. Unfortunately the list ends here. 

The less than ideal:
Sea urchin, sweet shrimp, tuna sashimi and oyster are only one per dinner order. But for the price they are charging I can understand that. For the sweet shrimp they were supposed to serve the head tempura style. There were only two waitresses so they were overwhelmed in an AYCE setting where the customers made repeat orders. 

The bad:
All other fishes are not as fresh (likely previously hard frozen) and are almost tasteless. It is also half the thickness I am used to (granted the rice is also on the small side). Hence the nigiri lacks balance. The salmon roe and smelt roe are way too salty. Oyster is not fresh, which is kind of hard. Oysters on half shelf are either fresh or spoiled so it puzzled me why the taste was off yet not spoiled. The wasabi has no kick at all - something really hard to screw up. All rolls had faked crab legs basked in mayonnaise in the center, and more creamy sauce on top. Two of those one can call it a night.

Great quality sushi, everything was so fresh and clean tasting. Very well prepared, large pieces of fish and a good amount of rice. The itamaes were very skilled and everything was presented well and delicious. 

Highlight was a strawberry rice wine. This was so smooth and easy to drink. We blew through 7 bottles in the course of our meal. Totally worth it! 

The waitresses were helpful and super attentive. Great service, there were always around and available.

2533159,2016-12-10,1,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"This is an all-you-can-eat sushi place for about $25/head. The restaurant wasn't that big, but it was clean. We got the last booth on a Saturday night. Not a fancy establishment...some people brought their kids & infants.

The selection of items was tremendous. Some of the item names are, ahem, not family-friendly. ""Excuse me, uh, what is a Screaming Orgasm?"" Lol!

Quality of the fish was okay, perhaps slightly better than average for sushi buffet. Note: there's no way we can compare sushi buffet fish with a regular restaurant, given the relatively low cost. The seaweed salad was too sweet.

So, why did DH swear never to return? It was the rice. Their rice was gluey and starchy, so much so that it distracted us from enjoying the fish or shrimp. The  sweet shrimp itself was pretty good, however, they didn't give us the deep fried heads! The uni was a touch bitter & a really small portion. It was okay, but we didn't want more. Which was a good thing, since this item was limited to one order per person.

The Kalbi was good. Haha, must be a Korean-run establishment! :) Eel was okay, but no torch-caramelized top. Sunny Special roll tasted fine, however, not as skillfully done as the nigiri. They had more than 1 chef making rolls, so maybe these were done by the other guy. See the photo with the cross-section on how it was rolled.

The ""Yum Scallop"" was basically a gunkan sushi with shredded scallop mixed in mayonnaise. We couldn't understand the waitress & thought ""mai yu"" was a special seasoning! Lol! She meant ""mayo""! You folks can pass on this one. ;)

The Honey Bread dessert was tasty. Basically a King's Hawaiian bread roll with a scoop of green tea ice cream, whipped cream, and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. I don't think there was any honey in it. DH tried the yuzu sorbet and the flavor was weak.

Service was surprisingly good. They get an extra star for that. The wait staff was eager to get our orders in & happily explained things on the menu. There is a 90 minute time limit for dinner, but we were never rushed. Food came out quickly.",CXl9uMlh4PTold4MxVku2g,3,3,3,Ll63UplBvm4qMQ9o9WQpVQ

The sushi is average.  Their orgasm appetizer doesn't even tickle me.  The best dish there is the coconut shrimp tempura which comes from a box either way.

How are they 4.5 stars you ask?  People want a free soda so they give them 5 stars.  Really people?  Your integrity for $2.50 worth of coke?

Go this 'way' ... the Sushi Way!   Let's preface by saying that my all-time favorite ayce sushi spot currently is Sakana but Sushi Way may take the top spot in the future.  If you were a big fan of Sakana then when I say this rivals them, you ought to hurry before this place gets too popular.  It was that good my first time here and I can only hope it'll stay this way when I return again soon.

The location takes over where once Dragonfly/Firefly used to be way back then.  So many good memories made here and I'm glad a new sushi joint has taken its place.  My group walked in around 6pm on a Monday and we were the only customers there.  Sweet.  More attention for us.  Free drink with Yelp or Facebook check-in. Nice!  Thirsts quenched.  

Onto the food:  

Appetizers- Gyoza, Fried Rice (w/ chicken), Tempura Shrimp and Tempura Coconut Shrimp, Seaweed Salad, Poke Tuna, Baked Mussels, Miso Soup, and Sweet and Spicy Dumpling.

Everything was great but the Poke and the Baked Mussels were REAAALLLY Good.     Check out my beautiful pictures..  so fresh, nice color, tasted marvelously.  My daughter and I enjoyed the seaweed salad and the tempura shrimp in unlimited quantities is reason enough to be eating here.   There were multiple other choices on the menu that we didn't get to try simply because it was just the three of us eating.  (oysters, yakitori skewers, etc.)

Sushi- Japanese Lasagna-  California roll with cream cheese baked with yumyum sauce on top.  Assorted regular rolls such as shrimp tempura rolls, rainbow roll, etc.  All rolled well, nothing fell apart and the taste was good.   The screaming orgasm came with nice thick pieces of tuna in that delicious tangy screaming O sauce.  We had assorted nigiri including salmon, yellowtail and garlic tuna.  The fish was fresh and the ratio of fish to rice was excellent.  

I did also get one order of uni and it was super fresh!  When the uni is fresh, it's as good as it gets for me.  

Also, note on one of my pictures, if there's a roll you're interested in that's not on the menu, there's a ""create your own roll"" option.  They will try to make it for you.  Thought that was cool.

With regards to the service, the staff was very welcoming and attentive.  Waters were filled within reasonable time and the food came out quickly.  Only time can tell whether this place will be able to handle a packed restaurant once word-of-mouth continues to bring new customers in here.

This is the only place that I've eaten uni that I actually liked it. Normally it tastes like the ocean but if you ask anybody that has eaten good uni, they will tell you that it tastes like butter and over it tasted like butter. Even my brother and my dad who has high end taste likes it here.  

One thing to note is the things with the red dot at the end of it (uni aka sea urchin, ama ebi aka sweet shrimp, fresh oyster, Kal bi aka galbi, etc) is one order per person. Other than that it order as much as you can eat. Don't waste or you might get charged. 

They have beer, different kinds of sake, soft drinks, and soda. 

Desserts are things like mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream, yuzu sorbet, tempura ice cream, and honey bread. Unfortunately you can choose only one of them.

3006652,2017-05-06,10,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Review #095 - 2017

We showed up on Monday night, May 1st, around 11 PM and asked for a table for five, three adults and two babies.

The place was pretty much empty except for one other table who were getting ready to finish up and leave.  We had the whole place to ourselves so our food was made pretty quickly.

We started off with a few different rolls and nigiris.  I'm more of the sashimi eater, but my friends were more into the specialty rolls so it made it a little difficult to share with them so we ended up ordering a bunch of separate items.

I think my personal favorite would have to be the super white.  It was very tasty, plus the fact that there's no rice was a bonus.  I ordered 3 orders which consisted of 3 pieces per order.  I think I ate 2 orders to myself.

The bacon scallop skewers were also tasty.  Even my 1-year old daughter had a bite and didn't spit it out.  She also enjoyed a few strands of noodles from the udon noodle soup, which I thought the broth was kind of salty.

The screaming orgasm did not live up to its name at all.  I think they must have misnamed it because I was not feeling the orgasm.  Sorry, TMI!  Glad they limited it to just one order per person because I would've been greedy & ordered more just because of the name.  Haha

The salmon skin hand roll was really dry so I took quite a while to finish it, but everything else that I ordered was good.

The food is probably a 3.5 at best, but I bumped it up to a 4.5 because our waitress was the best that I'd ever encountered.  She was super friendly and accommodating.  I don't think I've ever met anyone who's so good at doing their job.  Sadly, I didn't get her name.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,18,17,4,FtwxNXy4-ceyNn3B2KG2tw

So glad I came in! The selection for lunch is not cut short from the dinner menu. Everything that a person can get at dinner, they can get at lunch. The options include lots of appetizers as well as deserts with the dozens of sushi roll options. I really enjoyed the couple of riceless rolls I tried, especially the Johnny roll-would HIGHLY recommend it! The roll has a perfect mix inside and the ""orgasm sauce"" is to die for! The egg roll was great-and is vegetarian friendly. I also really enjoyed the Hot & Juicy roll-it is an explosion of flavors in your mouth, and not too spicy, but still provides a great little kick! The rainbow roll was also delicious and had great filling and the topping is thick! I had a few other rolls, but those were the ones that stood out most. I finished with one mango and one strawberry mochi, which were a great palette cleanser. The service was quick and friendly. I look forward to coming back here any time I come to Vegas!",J6Pw68sXrchiWGpLc0dGag,1,1,5,-_jgmY2Asdpw6QvrP_OfeA

So I put a search out to good old Yelp, and this place came up with good reviews and the price was right at $26 for AYCE dinner. I called up Sushi Way to see if I needed to make a reservation.. since it was a Friday night, but was told there was no need. Fantastic!

This place is right off the Las Vegas Strip (only about a 20 in walk from Planet Hollywood Hotel). So we were on our way!

Let me tell you, I was a little nervous for it being in a small strip mall, but do not let that deter you!!.. This place is amazing, with really fresh seafood.

The menu is the perfect size with lots of options for every taste preference. The best part is that they offer 1/2 rolls so you can try more options! I love this option, wish more places offered this!!

Don't know what you want... the staff is great at providing suggestions!

My faves of the night: the Big Easy, Volcano, DD, Green Monster,  Gyoza (pot stickers),  Jalapeno poppers, Bacon Scallop Skewers (so yummy!!)

As for the desert, only had space for a few spoonfuls of the Yuzu Sorbet, this was so refresing, wished I had saved more room to finish this.

3524599,2016-01-24,11,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Went here with some friends to try out a new AYCE sushi place since we wanted to shake things up a bit. This location is near the strip and is located in a small plaza, so be sure to make the turn at the light because I thought I could just turn directly in, but there is no other entrance.

For lunch they only give you 60 minutes to order your food so make sure you have your whole party with you to maximize the time. I ordered a couple of rolls, but I wasn't really impressed with any of them since I've had much better. The only item I would highly recommend getting is the sushi nachos which is basically a bunch of raw fish stacked on top of a tortilla chip (think of it as a seafood tostada). The rice to fish ratio is alright, but they could cut down on the rice a bit. Also, you can only get one dessert item per person. They are really stingy!

The service was both good and bad. The male waiter is very nice and attentive while the Korean lady really needs to brush up on her customer service. I called her over to just order a seaweed salad and the cucumber salad since I wanted something refreshing with my sushi rolls. The first thing she says is ""oh, but you already ordered a lot."" First of all, my orders were all half rolls and I was only ordering two light appetizers. Secondly, doesn't she realize that I was doing the AYCE menu? I'd be more understanding if I ordered a bunch of stuff, but I was being rather conservative for the first round. Luckily she took my order, but I've never had that kind of experience before. It just sucks that she is the one to take the orders, while the guy can only clean up or give more water. If the service was better on the lady's end I would have considered giving a higher rating.

Overall, I would not recommend this place. The food is alright, but I would recommend going to Sushi Twister or Sakana. Trust me on  this one lol.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,15,13,3,EWIDhyNfQE7jPCGpHq0-6Q

I was advised to find a good Japanese  restaurant  with raw fish, Me entiendes?
Well after a bit of research and people asking while hiking, this was my choice for my only real meal this trip to Vegas. Heard there were lots of shitty sushi places on the strip and this was a Vegas local favorite, just a short distance where tourists don't go. Well I have never been steered wrong with this advise.

Wow, in all honesty some of the best poké I have had that was not in  the south Pacific. Really really good quality tuna . The seared salmon app was pretty good as well.  Short ribs were decent. Salad, miso were pretty standard. Yellow tail was good, the escolar was good, I forget what it was called as I did not order it, but is was good.

I wish I could have eaten more, but man I'm  not so much the fat boy anymore.  In my raw fish experience this was really,really good. In Vegas,LA. or where ever, you blow a ton of cash for raw fish, but I'm not so sure it's worth it.  Let's  just use a bit of logic, in the USA where are you getting same day fish, cut real time?

So if you want good   fish at this price point, I'm pretty sure you can not do much better in a land locked desert paradise of sin, than what we experienced, and I know my raw fish.",T76-jKiHe5Fz5qTjQQlWoA,3,1,5,uEIP9Ob-zq4D7BDxjbgNlw

I just didn't like much after that with the exception of the coconut shrimp tempura. Since my taste buds are off, I didn't take off for that. A couple of things to note that I didn't read anywhere. On the menu it said no leftovers. I thought it meant you could not take leftovers on AYCE. Makes sense. I found out that it meant you have to eat all the plate to get other things. Different than other AYCE I had gone to. You can share with anyone in your group getting AYCE too. Alas, I was traveling alone so I didn't have that advantage. The waitress was a bit rude about it but let me do leave some. So you must know you are going to like it before you order. I did half orders which helped but I don't know how I would know if I would have liked something new without tasting it. Wish it would have been explained better when I sat down espically since they get lots of tourists. With that said, I really liked the food and would go back now that I understand the rules better.

AND she said I can't order my favorite Alaskan rolls without crab! Even after I told her I have crab allergy, she said I can reduce the amount of crab but I ""have to"" eat it!! She laterally said that!!! WTF???Seriously???? Even tho you guys say on the menu that you guys would make a custom roll???? So what if I ask you to make a roll with salmon, cucumber,and avocado? Would I still have to eat it with crab??? Lame. 
 After I said then forget it, she asked the chef and he said he can make it w/o crab( of course! Why not?) But I never expected to be told to eat something I am allergic to in any restaurants so I was so shocked! Also, in almost all the restaurants(as far as I know), they 
normally don't put crab meat in Alaskan rolls anyway!!! 

Also when we went to have a lunch there, it was almost empty but each order took about 10-15 min to come!!! So ridiculous!!!! I really wanted to love this place but I can't. I don't think I will never go back there. They are Korean so they don't know how to make sushi and cut fish right.

You like all you can eat sushi? Can you stuff it in your pie hole (sushi hole) in an hour? You betcha!

For about $26 bucks for dinner, one person, no sharing, finish in an hour ANYTHING on the menu'. Challenge accepted!

My dining guest does not eat sushi.... sadly... however, he did have some amazing pot stickers as well as some tasty katsu chicken; so there is something on the menu for our non sushi eating friends.

Here is a tip as well....... you can order half sizes of the rolls! If you are anything like me you want to try as much as your sushi tummy can handle! Also, beer drinking is fun, but it does have a tendency to make that rice expand in your belly, so stick to water or their amazing tea...

Walking in, this definitely has that typical sushi restaurant feel with a bar. The waitress immediately sat us down and provided menus to my buddy and I. We didn't even have to wait long to get her to take our orders either. It's like she had Psychic powers because she was always on top of her game serving us when checking if we need anything.

Sorry Richard, we got ourselves a waitress who knows how to keep her customers happy lol. She strikes up a conversation on her free time to make our experience a lot better for not only the food, but the welcoming personality. A+ for her service!! 

My friend definitely showed me great expectations for their Sushi and fusion specialties. We did AYCE for $26 and got free drinks for writing a review/rating them on yelp. Ask about their stamp cards. When you get 10, next visit is free.

Don't forget to try their tempura ice cream and there's no limit to trying each of their desserts. Usually most Sushi restaurants only limit you to one dessert per customer...

I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento ($9). It comes with: chicken teriyaki, 4 California rolls, 2 gyozas, 4 pieces of vegetable tempura, a very small portion of potato salad, salad and miso soup. Although it was a good amount of food, nothing stood out to me.

Unfortunately YELP does not allow for 1/2 stars!

Unlike most of the other AYCE Sushi places, this one is not too far from the Strip!

I thoroughly enjoyed the all the nigiri here, they even have Salmon Belly in the AYCE!
- Fresh Scallops were very good....one of the best I had at an AYCE
- Loved the Sushi Nachos...very creative with tons of flavor.
- Bacon Scallop skewer was tiny...gone in a couple of bites...
- The Salmon Tar Tare was gone in one bite as well...creative and tasty!

The service is decent. This is where they get docked the .25 Stars...lol
There is a Korean lady that is a bit rough around the edges...
For dessert I asked her for the Green Tea Tempura...but instead got the regular ice cream...wasn't really interested in making a big deal about it...its fine.

3877205,2016-01-28,1,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Sushi Way is my go-to neighborhood AYCE sushi bar. It may not have the best sushi all the time, but it satisfies my cravings and I'm always able to get in without having to wait 1-2 hours unlike Goyemon or Kaya. I believe lunch is $22 and dinner is $27. Like most AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas, you get a few extra premium items with the dinner price such as the uni, oysters, sweet shrimp, as well as galbi and the screaming orgasm. They always have daily specials, which has always included a type of sashimi with jalapenos. In the past, this has included the super white tuna and yellowtail. 

The best things to order at Sushi Way include the nigiri and a few of the side dishes. I've never had a bad experience with any of the fish. I tend to stay away from the regular or specialty rolls as they usually have a ton of rice and cream cheese. However, if you are tempted to try one, they do offer half rolls. Some of my favorite side dishes include the coconut shrimp tempura (must order every visit), baked green mussels, bacon scallop skewer, and seaweed salad. Of the specialty rolls, I've only tried a few variations of the soft shell crab for fun. 

Their dessert menu includes green tea ice cream, yuzu sorbet, mochi, tempura ice cream, and honey bread. I usually stick to the green tea ice cream or strawberry mochi. The tempura becomes complete mush and the yuzu sorbet is too icey. Don't forget to check-in on the Yelp app for a free soda.

  The problem that I have with  restaurants (provided, of course, that their food is well-done- fresh, good proportions, variety of ingredients, decent-sized pieces, & preferrably at least a couple of rolls that set them apart from their competitors) is that I tend to find 1 or 2 rolls that I particularly like, but I don't want to have to travel from 1 place to the next to get a full meal. Plus, I prefer AYCE- takes the stress off.
  This place is my current favorite- living up to my requirements, plus having several interesting rolls.

The service - Our server was training a new person. Both of them were nice, but about halfway through the meal our server let the trainee take over and she didn't seem to have any idea about the menu, which roll was which, or even basic sushi terminology. Also, at one point the sushi chef told our server to not let us order more until we were finished with what was on the table... Since I don't really like sushi rolls, and I had finished all the nigiri I ordered, I had to wait until my 3 other dinning companions had finished their rolls. I've never experienced that before. 

The food - Very underwhelming. We started with some apps... The mussels were okay, nothing special, and had way too much eel sauce. The salmon tartare was super bland, but the nachos were flavorful. The hamachi kama was over cooked, but the portion size was good. Tempura was just ok, too. The best one was the poke, it was spicy and full of flavor, but when we ordered a second one it wasn't spicy at all. They were like two completely different dishes.
All of the rice was super mushy. I tried to order a spicy scallop hand roll but they wouldn't make it for me. They gave me a yum yum scallop roll instead, that had absolutely no flavor. I can't really speak to the rolls, but as we were leaving, one of my friends said he wouldn't go back because he wasn't impressed with the rolls he had.

The last few times it's been a bit inconsistent with sushi chefs that change every single time and when I get nigiri the fish temperature is almost room temperature instead of chilled as it should be. The food is still good, but the rolls have been more inconsistent since every time we go it's different sushi chefs that don't seem to have as much training.

I honestly can't think of anything negative about this place. The atmosphere is perfect. What I love, is that this place offers half orders on all you can eat, and the service here is awesome! They're quick, polite, and always checking up on us in a timely manner. (SPECIAL THANKS TO JANE!!

4075742,2017-10-25,1,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for one night and looking for a good restaurant with reasonable prices. We searched and searched, and there weren't a ton of inexpensive sit-down options that were nearby. However, after about 20-30 minutes of searching on Yelp, he saw the menu for Sushi Way--at $10-15, the prices sounded great, and the place had 4.5 stars.

We sat down and picked two sushi rolls to start--when the server came to take our order, we told him what we wanted, and then he asked if we wanted to do the AYCE sushi option for $27 a person. There were a couple rules to review on the menu (like they will charge you for wasting food), but I LOVE sushi and knew that I could eat my money's worth. Any stomach ache or vomiting from overeating would be totally worth it. That's how much I love sushi.

I ordered oysters, baked mussels, seared salmon, salmon, eel, sea urchin, sexy lazy special, vocano roll, pineapple sorbet, and vanilla ice cream. Everything was SO good. I loved the sexy lazy, vocano, and eel the most. I still dream about those flavors in my mouth. Oh, it was SO good. None of the sushi had excessive rice, they were super friendly, quick, and paced everything out well instead of dragging it out so you're full faster.

I definitely wish this place was in Portland. I would probably go eat myself stupid at least once a month. At least.",X568BojbbH6cAxqXU5zLwA,1,1,5,vcWY7HRzHLDcfFG1ss7aIw
4085541,2016-07-05,5,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"All You Can Eat sushi is usually a very good thing. Normally it is a delicious event. This is not the Sushi Way. You have to shove rolls into a napkin so you can throw them away in the bathroom. That is the Sushi Way, way.

Took a minute to be seated. It had a decent amount of people in here. We did beat out a group of 8 ladies that had to wait a while for a table. 

$25 for AYCE sushi. A touch north of what I want to pay, but hell, it's a Friday night. I can take the hit. 

Cherry Blossom Roll: This was my first roll. This roll was a red flag. It's spicy tuna, crab and green onion inside wrapped in avocado with eel sauce with crunch. I thought it was a joke when it came out. It's comically large. You can't pick it up with chop sticks. It doesn't hold together to take a bite. It all falls apart. Plus, it didn't taste fresh at all. Crunch was just brown sugar which didn't add anything to the roll. It was actually jarring to get a mouth full of brown sugar out of nowhere. 

No relief in sight. Screaming Orgasm was also gross. It's just tasted old. The sauce was flat. Just like it had been sitting out all day. 

After these two lackluster rolls, we ordered more. And waited. And waited. And waited. Went to the restroom. Noticed there was no soap in the bathroom. Compounded with the fact that I had to FIGHT with the automatic hand towel dispenser to get a scrap of paper towel. With all this in mind, I wondered, ""How do they properly wash their hands before touching all these rolls?""

With my appetite diminishing exponentially, I could take in the environment around me. This is when I noticed the head sushi chef looked like he had some frat party to go to after work. He was wearing his hat backwards while plating the sushi. I couldn't stop thinking, ""Who even wears hats backwards anymore?"" Am I judging a book by its cover? Just ask the people he was about to serve sushi to when he yanked the plate away to fix the presentation of the plate (top of rolls falling off the bottom part). Seemed super professional. He also was just staring at the 8 women who came in after us. Just watching him stare in that direction for most of the night. Sushi weren't the only rolls this guy had his mind on.  

Along the professional route, one server also openly was flirting with the other one in front of us. Or something akin to flirting. I have no clue what was going on. After bringing us our rolls, server asked if we wanted anything else. One server playfully hit the other server, then says something to the effect of, ""We can beat each other up if you want us too.""

Uhhhh. Please. No.

By the way, did I mention we never got our own plates? We had to eat right off the plates the rolls came in. Supes profesh.

The rolls we got were even worse. Salmon belly was whatever, tasted like it had been sitting out on the counter for hours. We had burnt eel. We had old stale rice. We had more unfresh fish. Debated on how to dispose of this food. Almost settled on the ""dump it in the plastic tree"" move but decided it was too cartoony and rude.  This is where I had to eventually take the rolls into a napkin and dump them in the bathroom trash can. That was the easy part. Hard part was fishing paper towels to dry my hands.

Any redeeming qualities? Sherbet sure was good. Legitimately, the best tasting thing we had there. 

I have never had such a strange sushi experience in my life. I'm glad I'm still alive after eating that food. Don't get me wrong, I didn't feel great, but I'm alive.

There are tons of other sushi places that are better (Yama Sushi, Sushi Mon, Japaniero) so don't even waste your time here.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,6,2,1,MAMlnuS-_oSRpP5FtfOgEw

4225352,2016-11-14,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Overall, it was an alright meal, but looking back at reviews and pictures, it seems the cut of fish I received was inconsistent with others.. Came for an early dinner on Saturday and was really looking forward to our meal after a hike in the narrows. We chose to sit at the sushi bar and service was decent.

For apps: the coconut shrimp tempura and baked green mussels were good. The calamari was not so great. Not crunchy and the batter came right off.

In our first round, we ordered 2 orders of uni, but was only brought out 1. So I had to ask for the second. When they brought out the second order, there was significantly less uni. I was dismayed but the uni was still very good. 

It seemed after our first round, the sushi chef wasn't happy that I asked for the second uni order and it was reflected on the size of fish and rice we got following that order. The cuts of our fish for the nigiri were small compared to the pictures, and the amount of rice got a little bigger. The rice also fell apart too easily.

I did enjoy the white tuna the best, it came with a garlic ponzu, and the fish was really good. It'd be even better with a better fish to rice ratio. Garlic yellowtail was also good. Everything else was so so: salmon, garlic tuna, scallop.

The sweet shrimp was nice and big in size, but the sushi chef did not include the fried shrimp head, nor did he offer or say anything about it.

The Red Boy roll: this was good, the white tuna on top was a little cooked on top, and the charred flavor went really well.

The I love my ass roll: not so good.. There was supposed to be soft shell crab inside, but there was literally none, just a lot of imitation crab filling.

The yellowtail collar and jalapeno white tuna were the chef's special for the day. The yellowtail was huge and delicious, although a bit overcooked. Also liked the white tuna.",v2yN8ZNW3fMC_xZP9CkZLQ,2,1,3,iXt6IZZHhaq5qRy5bCO1NA

A Korean lady walked in the dining room though and seated us. We thought she was kind of unfriendly at first but she definitely warmed up to us throughout the meal and started joking with us and being really sweet. 

Throughout our meal, the service was prompt (both water and food) and the quality of the fish was really, really good. I'm a big nigiri fan and I definitely enjoyed the salmon and scallop the most. There are also many categories of rolls on the back and I liked the Fat Ass (a deep fried roll) even though it's one of those rolls where one piece is too big for your mouth but at least it's appropriately named. A lot of the roll names are laced with sexual innuendo but our waiter would just joke about it and have a good time with us. 

Overall, a great meal and definitely worth the $21.95 for lunch and lunch is 'til 4 PM! The menu says there's a 60 minute limit but we were definitely full before the limit since the food would come out quickly.

an order of shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura too, good, nothing special, but good
Hamachi kama, gotta get these if they have them available....simple grilled collars with a ponzu sauce to dip in....not necessary, good by itself

first round of nigiri, ordered salmon belly, uni, unagi, and Hamachi
the owner Jin/Jun (sorry not clear on which) prepared our first round of sushi
everything was great, buttery, melt in your mouth good

pause for another round of bacon wrapped scallops!
and we snuck in an order of salmon tar tar, really good, layered on top of crab and avocado

second round of sushi, ordered salmon belly again, super white tuna w/jalapeno, tuna, and a spider roll....have to order 1 roll at least right?
in any case, his apprentice prepared this order, and you could really tell his knife skills lacked, as the fish did not have the same consistency as our first round
some of the slices were uneven and he cut against the grain incorrectly, as the salmon belly was a bit chewy rather than soft and buttery in texture

in any case, that about wrapped up this visit
finished with some orange slices and green tea ice cream

But, that changed this morning when my boyfriend texted me, telling me he had food poisoning. And I myself had been fighting an unpleasantness last night as well. 

However, I want it to be clear that we wouldn't have come back anyways, even if we didn't get sick. The ambiance of this place is very dead, it's slightly depressing. There is no joy in the staff, with the exception of one server. It didn't start to get upbeat in the restaurant till a group of guys came in. 

We thought that their nigiri tasted good, the sushi is of good quality, but we didn't like their rolls at all. The only thing you can taste in all the rolls is the unagi sauce, and it overpowers everything else. Their other sauces have no flavor, and the sushi is lost. I also want to add that their appetizers are mediocre. We had the Veggie tempura that we weren't impressed by, the Screaming Orgasm which has the same problem with no flavor and my boyfriends miso soup never arrived. 

But once again, none of this matters anymore since my boyfriend woke up super sick, and my stomach has been upset as well.

I'm sorry Sakana for betraying you. Even though your rice isn't good sushi rice and you're always busy... you always treat us well, your staff is welcoming, and we always leave satisfied and never with food poisoning.",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,5,2,1,hs_1e6QaNl9VeXotcX8QNg

I'm a sushi fiend. And Sushi Way does NOT disappoint in the slightest. Their fish is fresh, their rice is the perfect texture. There is a balance between the fish and the rice, unlike many AYCE places that pile on the rice while minimizing cost by skimping on the fish portions. 

I'll eat just about anything, so I love to ask the chefs what they like or to surprise me. To not be too terrible long-winded, I'll just say that you better get to this place ASAP!

You can definitely tell these parents don't care anything about their child. Anyway on to the main part of the it was. This issue was good and that's only because of sushi chef was great, and he probably wouldn't be working here if you knew his real self worth and you can probably get a better job. After learning Sushi we ask for the bill bill came out to a hundred and someone not changed. Once we got the change we gave $140 so we can have extra money to tip and ask for change. It took half an hour before having to ask for the money back and they said hey you only 20.

The boyfriend and I did the all you can eat, getting the nigiri first: super tuna, scallops, salmon, and yellowtail. All were fresh, with nice, properly seasoned rice and reasonable portions, with the scallop being the stand out (I think I had six pieces total). For the rolls, they allow you to get half and half if you're torn between two choices, as I was with the Alaska and Arizona rolls, and again, great sizes, super fresh, and tasty combos (I preferred the Alaska with the crab, but that's just personal taste). 

Also got the Salmon Tartar, which is quite rich, served as a round with a top layer of salmon tartar, a lower layer of mayo/crab, and a creamy mayo sauce. The shrimp tempura was light and not greasy. The only disappointment was the tempura ice cream, with a heavy, unappealing shell over the green tea ice cream. But it was such a minor fault (and I really wasn't there for dessert) that I don't care. 

The sushi chef was super friendly and very on the ball, he almost seemed disappointed when we stopped ordering (even though I thought we'd been kind of piggish). Overall, a very satisfying experience.",taJ4IVD_aJmnB9BrfgNpeQ,3,3,5,ojOHr7F2aIykTX7zB2dRBw

You could feel the unhappy coming off of her; I know what it is like to have a bad day and it's ok to not be super friendly but it not OK to walk around mopey and slow without a care in the world about your job and the customers there. She was not welcoming in any way and took forever to even get us water, then completely forgot my green tea; I didn't bother asking again. 

HOWEVER I was bummed at first because the AYCE  lunch didn't include some things on the menu that my other usual AYCE sushi spots do, such as my favorite: screaming orgasm! The sushi chefs behind the bar were great (one was possibly the owner) and made me a screaming O even though it wasn't offered. The chefs were very nice and quick to get us all the sushi we wanted so that made up for the negative energy emitting off of the server.

Americans often think of sushi as California rolls and their definition of ""good"" usually leaves me smdh

i am a self-admitted sushi snob
my profile pic is a piece of o-toro from the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo

my favorite is Omakase sushi at the bar, direct from the chef...

so i land in Vegas, around lunchtime, take an uber to some place off the strip... and to my horror - it was All You Can Eat (AYCE)... in any case, i luckily it was closed and i tell my uber driver to take me to the #2 place (as per Yelp)

we get to Sushi Way and I see the ""AYCE"" sign in the window. At this point I am Stttttaaaaarvvvvinngg!!!

whatever

go in, sit at the bar - they explain to me that for lunch it's $21.95 for 60minutes - no holds barred - anythign and everything on the menu goes

you want edamame? sure
you want 10 spicy tuna rolls? sure
you want a really complicated roll of your own making? (i think so)

in any case - as i sit there, overwhelmed with this menu - and starving, sushi chef asks if i'm ready... i say while i look, let's start with a spicy tuna roll

[listen - i've had amazing omakase nigiri sushi, but that's not what i'm expecting here - let's be realistic]

it comes pretty quickly - and i'm actually pleasantly surprised

for the next 35 minutes, i order 6 more rolls
roll after roll

one from the softshell crab section
one from the eel section
couple from the shrimp tempura section

the special rolls are massive

and they are all DELICIOUS

i was incredibly nervous of spending my first evening in Vegas explaining to my buddies that i ate a lotta strip mall sushi and was spending the night in my hotel room worshipping the porcelain gods... no such thing!

after 35 minutes i had zero room for dessert or anything else (it was still included - and i still had another 25mins to go)

but all things being equal, for $21.95 - i definitely think i came out a winner
one of the best value / best lunches I've had in Vegas... Period!

The decor is very simple. There was a TV but it wasn't playing anything. I think if that was on, it would have helped with my boredom while waiting for my food. I think they could improve the atmosphere with better decor considering this is close to the strip and the restaurants around this area are nice.

The sushi was ehhh. Nothing was extraordinary. Nothing I had to have more of. Some things were okay, some were not good. We went for lunch, but the lunch AYCE doesn't include some of the items I wanted, like sea urchin (uni) and fresh oysters so I paid the dinner price. I never eat sushi without having uni. This was by far the worse uni I've ever had. First off, it was a really small amount. Second off, it left a really bad bitter taste in your mouth, which means the uni was not fresh.

However, the execution of the sushi was lackluster. The rice was toothy and slightly too vinegary. The fish items tasted less that perfectly fresh. They lacked the creamy mouthfeel of higher grade sushi.

My favorite dishes was the salmon tartare app, which had salmon that was admittedly sliced improperly for tartare. It sat atop crab salad, diced red onions, and avocado. The dish was good in a grocery store sushi way: decent flavor combo, but ingredients tasted as if they had sat out a bit too long. Not unsafe food practices, just not fastidiously prepared.

The salmon roe tasted fresh and was tasty. 

None of the dishes blew me away. It was just an OK meal. The service was prompt and cordial but not particularly caring or friendly despite how close I was to the sushi chefs.

I wouldn't recommend this place. Their reviews are high because the price is attractive for an AYCE near the vegas strip. Thr execution was poor.",EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,5,0,2,qFnNNE6et9FwvxoGqv882w

but...

...something seemed up with the wateriness of some of the sushi, almost like there was a condensation problem going on in the fridge and some water collected in the tray. A lot of the pieces seemed just wet, even my girlfriend noticed and mentioned so it wasn't just in my head or something. The salmon wasn't totally fresh and neither was the red snapper...and they were out of halibut...bummer. Also, they seared a lot of the pieces even though I'm not into searing it (hence why people go for sushi...uncooked fish, right!?)...maybe they were trying to cover up something.

Anyway with all that above, why 4 stars instead of 3 (or less). The service was great, it wasn't busy and we had a ton of ""no rice"" arrangements thrown at us left and right made up on the spot that seemed limitless (see pics)...and oh yeah...Tempura. Coconut. Shrimp.

The sushi chefs were extremely attentive and made great sushi. The fish was fresh and plentiful. They didn't skimp at all on the fish to rice ratio.

I'm basically rating this a 3 because of a couple things. AYCE sushi is one of my favorite things to eat and I always order the same things I would get at other establishments and compare them to each other. I feel like everything here is covered in eel sauce or yum yum or ponzu here. it's not a bad thing but it's also not a good thing. I really like those flavors but when every dish seem to taste the same it gets boring. rice doesn't stay together on the nigiri and that's a big no no. the fish quality was ok it wasn't the best. I also think that the people that are working here need to be a little more educated on sushi we asked the waitress if she knew what deep fried shrimp heads were and she acted like we were crazy to mention it like what is that? Lol kinda funny but I think they have the location to get the people in but I think there are many other sushi places that are way better than this place. oh I will say my favorite thing here was the salmon skin handroll.,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,1,0,3,CZpwdAExZO_l9j4sfeOB3g
5174398,2016-04-02,7,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"OH SNAP!! 

I am not going to lie, my favorite food is sushi and I have gone to so many sushi bars including non-ayce AND ayce and this place has to be the BEST AYCE SUSHI I have ever had in 20+ years of my life. This is my REAL and HONEST review. It is so unfortunate that I cant express and write everything on here on Yelp. JUST COME AND TRY IT YOURSELF.

Warning though, I think this restaurant is pretty new. You know what that means? The waiters and waitresses are soooooooo new and they are DEFINITELY not fully trained YET so they are freaking slowwwww. I mean REAL slow and even if you are trying to get their attention, they are caught up with whatever they are doing so wont give all their time to you, which is a bit upsetting.

But, let me talk about sushi now, after all, this place is AYCE sushi restaurant. OHEMGEE, the freshest fish ever!! Every piece I had at the day of my visit, had AWESOME flavor, cut and presentation. I was very very impressed. One thing that I really admired about this sushi bar was that they cut the fish after they get your order. Why is that surprising? Well, many of AYCE places have cut their fish in advance so that they can make sushi a lot faster to serve a big mass of people. I guess it is convenient for them but its not necessarily good for us. Fish can get dry and the taste will definitely be different. I dont know if that played a big role but my sushi tasted GREAT! I loved it and I ate so much.  Their hamachi was seriously the best I have ever had at any AYCE places. To top that hamachi, their AMAEBI WAS BOMB. I seriously have NEVER seen this AMAEBI QUALITY ANYWHERE (AYCE) before. Period. It was HUGE, MEATY and SWEET! I dont remember every one of them but everything I tried was so good. Their special for the night included Salmon Belly and DEAR, it was fatty and it just melted in my mouth. I love SALMON and it was just PERFECT.

Now shifting to the appetizers, I only tried one, Coconut shrimp tempura and I am soooo glad I ordered that because it was amazingly good. The sushi chef actually recommended it and I absolutely devoured it. In fact, I ordered twice!! I really like that they come out warm and super crispy, fresh out of the fryer. Again, not many places do this. They usually have a lot of them fried, and just kind of give it to us, semi-warm and it is never crispy. Batter was ultra thin and shrimp was large. There were just the right amount of coconut on the outside batter, and it was just sooooo good!

They have honey bread as one of the options in the desserts, which is very rare to find elsewhere. It was pretty good but please order it without the ice cream, whip cream and chocolate drizzle. I only like to eat the honey bread. It was crusty and tasted good. It would have been a lot better if I knew it was coming out like that with all the extra that I dont care about.

To make things short, you will never find this quality at any other AYCE restaurants. They are at their best right now especially since they just opened. I hope they keep it the same and never downgrade. I will definitely come back whenever I am coming back to Vegas!

I give the young lady on the phone a lot of credit for putting up with the bull**** because she didn't have to endure that flake from me. 

Given that my order was wrong I couldn't tell you what exactly I got, but the rolls we not as advertised and they only gave me 6 pieces for each roll, but I guess I can attrition that to it being a wrong order though. 

From the looks of it the portions are small and nobody has any regard to taking accountability if a phone order was done correctly. But the reviews stay high so I suppose the restaurant dinning experience might be better?

I walked in with a group of 5 people and right when we walked in we were not greeted by any of the staff. I work at an AYCE sushi restaurant in Southern California and this type of behavior would never fly. Sushi Way is an AYCE restaurant and the server was writing down my tables order on a note pad. With that being said, only half of our items showed up that we ordered. They need to develop a better method for keeping track of the orders. At my restaurant, we have a sheet with all of the AYCE items and the customer can check the items they want, then the server picks up the sheet and inputs it into a POS system. On top of that, the food was not good. The fish was not fresh, and it was very inconsistent.

Of course at around 5pm on a Wednesday is when I entered the restaurant. Believe it or not I was the only one in the whole restaurant sitting at the sushi bar. 

Tho the sushi chefs were attentive to my needs the waitress for appetizers orders were not as attentive in my opinion. It started out as very attentive then shift changed the the new waitresses was not as attentive as the previous one. Otherwise it would have been a perfect 5 stars. 

I wanted to try all their nigiri to test out their freshness, it was a hit and miss. They had salmon belly for the special black board special and it was delicious and unlike some places they didn't limit you which was nice. The fish to rice ratio to me was right on very little rice.  

My favorite nigiri's that I tried
1. Squid
2. Octopus
3. Eel
4. Tomago
5. Plain tuna 
6. Halibut
7. Albacore
8. Yellow tail 

I also tried their gyoza, kalbi and pork belly all very delicious. 

I also tried few half rolls cow boy roll was ok, big easy special roll was delicious. I was by myself so it was hard to try many rolls but they did offer half rolls and it wasn't packed with rice but very tightly packed small amount of rice in the rolls. The rolls were very skinny compared to most places in Vegas .

I honestly would rate this place one of the top 5 best all you can eat sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.

If your not familiar with the area or just visiting it's very hard to miss the turn into park. The lot was spacious and you must turn into the ""the park 3900"" plaza on corporate st.",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,0,0,4,YRuJnfH5U70Qhc1XRLxcow

The list of appetizers was extensive as well.  The bacon wrapped scallops and kamakazi dynamite were recommended by our chef/owner, who was very friendly and was ready and willing to keep our sushi flowing.

You can even order mini udon, shrimp tempura, etc. Goyemon and Sushi Mon are good, too, but everything is sitting on top of a California roll. This one actually has great rolls filled with all different things. Soft shell crab, tuna, etc. Also, the one thing I love is they have kids prices. $14.95 for kids!

I was celebrating my birthday along with my best friend who joined us as well. We walked into the restaurant and waited 15-20 minutes before a sushi chef greeted us and told us to have a seat at a 4 person table in front of us. As we began to sit, the waitress finally came over and told us that we'd need to wait an additional 10 minutes to be seated. As we all stood there confused as to the service or lack thereof, the guests of the entire restaurant seemed as though they were also very disappointed. We finally decided to just sit ourselves down after 15 more minutes of waiting and nobody caring to acknowledge us. We sat at our table for another 20 minutes and as we sat there, two other small parties came in and were seated. The parties of people that came in after us were brought water and greeted before us. When the waitress finally decided to come and greet us, we brought this to the her attention and she rudely said that they only had two people working and had no sense to respectfully apologize. Had she done that, it would have been different, but the fact that we were treated with disrespect, we got up and left this place that so many others have given 5 stars. So disappointing!!!!

5465684,2015-08-30,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"I just back from this AYCE sushi resturant. The resturant was dark and seating was average in comparison to other sushi resturant. I did notice that there weren't any seatings for 2. Not a big deal but if you come with just one other person expect to have 2 empty seats next to you. (Kinda kills the romantic vibe). I came in during a slow time so I'm not sure how busy it gets but the store was basically empty for most of the time. There is also a bar where you can watch the chef crate the sushi right in front of you. WHAT! Pretty cool. We didn't sit there though we just sat at a table. There was only one waiter while we were there but another showed up as we left. The waiter that helped us was very attentive without being intrusive. It was a little hard to understand him but that wasn't a big deal. He was very nice.

The food. Only have one word for it... amazing. (The 5 stars probably killed the suspense of that but whatever). We had a lot of sushi rolls. Probably around 10. Needless to say we were pretty stuffed after we left. They were all good. Some better than others. The only one that I didn't particularly enjoy was the fat ass. They don't call it that for no reason. It was huge! However it did taste a little bland compared to the other rolls. It was still good though... I don't eat spicy food. Like at all and I was disappointed to see most of the menu items had some sort of spicy ingredient. I was a little turned off when I saw that the sushi I ordered had jalapeños... until I tasted it. FREAKING AMAZING! The spiciness wasn't overwhelming at all. It added a small zesty taste to the sushi. Coming from a person that hates spicy food. It was the best thing I have ever tasted with jalapeños on it. They do offer a fairly small desert menu. I got the green tea ice cream. It was good as expected. They offer one desert per person if you get the ayce deal.

They do have a few rules that actually didn't bother us at all. A common rule in most ayce sushi resturant is that if you don't finish the roll then you have to pay full price for it. This is the norm so it didn't really bother us. Also we saw that there was an hour time limit to eat on the menu. However it was slow and they didn't really hold us to that. I imagine during more busy time of day they might be more strict on this rule.

Decor average and no two table seatings 4 stars
     Add seatings for 2 and this will immediately jump to a five. They probably won't though because the resturant was a little small.

Service attentive without being intrusive 5 stars

Food amazing 5 stars

If you haven't been here. Definitely check it out. They gave us a coupon for free meal on our 11th visit. We will definitely be back and are looking forward to our future free meal and many more to come!",y8reqP_kQC5jyQkDfsibmw,2,0,5,fhprne9ksxJqnRBrFg-5vA

We went on a weeknight around 730 and there were only a handful of people. It's hard to pass by if you do not know exactly where the place is, when I called to ask what shopping center the restaurant is located, the person who answered the phone seemed a bit confused lol. It's where Tacos & Beer is, if that makes it easier to find.

AYCE dinner was like $27 a person?! I thought the server was really nice (didn't catch HIS name though). Also I thought the restaurant was nice and clean. But, I have to say it's not better or worse than any other sushi restaurant, it's comparable to Goyemon, Osyhi, etc.

The one thing I have to rave about was the Sushi Nacho. Omg, YUM!!!!!!! That was the best thing they had. I would've ordered like 10 of those if I wasn't full from the other rolls. But honestly, I can't really remember the rolls being that great or special except for that one. Their Japanese lasagna was also good, they put a lot of cream cheese on it.

Perhaps it was just my experience in particular that was bad. 

I came on a Wednesday, not quite yet during a rush period, but nearing. 

I started with my usual orders: uni, salmon, tamago, yellowtail, you name it. Everything had a refreshing taste to it, top notch quality that was almost on par with Sushi Koma. I particularly thought that their sweet shrimp was the best I've seen in an AYCE so far. 

I had a delightful time with the food but... not so much with the chefs. 

They took a long time, and when I say long, I mean a REALLY LONG time. I'm usually not so picky about the wait since I know that I happen to order a lot at a time. However, after waiting for over 10 minutes before the rush hour even began, I was starting to get suspicious. 

I timed them. 11 minutes, 14 minutes, a whopping 17 minutes. Even when my order just consisted of oysters, 13 minutes.

Perhaps making nigiri does take a long time, one by one, as my waitress assured me; however, in comparison to other sushi places in the valley, this is by far the slowest. Where is the competitiveness in that? 

I watched the chefs. I literally had my eyes hawking at them with laser focus. They were talking, chit-chatting, laughing, having fun amongst themselves, and NOT working on my order.

It was 20 minutes before we got the attention of a waiter to get our second order of food... we placed our order and made it a little more substantial so we wouldn't worry about waiting so much.... I thought!

First: all but one of our half order of rolls came to the table as full rolls.... (we ordered half rolls) filling us up quickly...
Second: they started delivering food we didn't order to the table. 
Third: we ordered 7 orders of chef's choice ""Omakase"" after 40 minutes of waiting we finally got our omakase and it was 7 orders of the same thing.. not a variety even the waiter thought it shouldn't of been all one thing....

But most of their rolls are forgettable and too similar, their screaming orgasm lacks complexity and their salmon tar tare is bland and just too much (it's a meal in itself). Mochi ice cream was bland, plus they need more variety.
Service was very friendly and helpful.

5636429,2017-07-19,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"One again, I ordered delivery from this establishment. I have never visited the restaurant in person, and I will limit my review to order accuracy, presentation and food quality.

So, regarding order accuracy: FAIL
This is the oddest part of my whole experience. I ordered, among other things, halibut nigiri. Eat24 called me a few minutes after I placed my order and informed me that they were out. I asked them to replace it with an order of yellowtail. What I received, besides my tuna order, which was fine, was 1 order of unagi (which I did order), 1 order of yellowtail (I think), and one order of salmon!!! And I was billed for a yellowtail roll; 2 dollars more than the yellowtail nigiri that I ordered as a replacement! Eat24 did a great job repairing the mistakes, but it's quite clear that Sushi way is not yet prepared to accept delivery orders.

Presentation: D+
Not one effort was made to present an attractive delivery order. Plain standard styro boxes with no adornments; not even that annoying plastic grass! I ordered wasabi and ginger for three and only got a quarter-sized serving of each. They did have the more expensive throw-away chopsticks though; that got 'em from a ""d"" to a ""d+."" 

Food quality: C
My husband loved the tuna; deep red, with very little sinew, and generous fish slices. However, as I've said many times, the heart of sushi isn't fish, it's the rice. And Sushi Way's rice isn't good. No coherence, and if you order some sushi that has a special sauce, like a ponzu instead of the standard soy, they put it directly on the fish before sending it out. Guess what the rice is like when you finally get it! Yep, soggy, no cohesion, very difficult to eat. But again, the quality of the fish was very good.

The bottom line? Clearly, the person who was responsible for contracting with Eat24 didn't consider the ramifications of offering sushi for delivery. I hope the person who is in charge of social media will instruct the staff on proper delivery prep and technique. And yes, presentation. I will order from them again, with prejudice though.",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,3,h2VRXFXIl3VGu3cqnAPY3A

First off, my friend ordered a roll without the rice and the waitress said that would be totally fine. They deliver the roll and it has rice in it so we told them we ordered it without rice and then the sushi chef said oh no we can't make that roll or any roll without rice....which I know isn't true because I've been to sushi places before where they just roll it in the seaweed. The waitress even explained it to him and he said it would be fine, but then told us he couldn't do it. 

We waited an extremely long amount of time for our food, especially my bento box. By the time I got it, my friends had finished eating. The chef (same one that said he couldn't make the roll without rice) didn't know what went in the bento box apparently, and just didn't make it based upon the conversation I overheard with him and the waitress. I don't understand why he wouldn't have just asked what went in it instead of not making it at all. 

The waitress was extremely nice and friendly, but was nowhere to be found most of the time. We had to get up and find someone to order more food and to ask for our check. She did give us a complimentary green tea ice cream for making us wait so long for my bento box, which was very nice of her. 

There are so many sushi places in Vegas and Henderson that are a million times better than this place. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here.",lHFkt91UFwQUywggO8yDHA,4,0,2,JEHcZJnY92GS_PyhG18-fQ

My wife, family, and I love to eat sushi. We usually find ourselfs in vegas 1 to 2 times a year. When we come to Vegas we usually eat sushi at least 2 times during our stay. We usually look look on Yelp for new AYCE sushi restaurants. This trip we tried island sushi, and sushi way. Island sushi was a great experience. When I found sushi way it had limited reviews, but the pictures looked great. We decided to go ahead and give it a try.

When we sat we were the only customers there. We put in our order very quickly. The appetizers came out pretty quick,and were very tasty. 

Sushi on the other hand was a different story. There was only one sushi cutter. More customers started to arrive. The sushi cutter looked like he was off in outer space. There was no sense of urgency. There was a 60 min time cap when eating. We were there for 2 and half hours.im guessing they let us go over the time limit because it was taking 10 mins in between half orders rolls.Sometimes when i would look at the cutter,  he would just be starring at the wall as orders were piling up. Maybe he was just ovetwhelmed, either way its made for a bad experiance. 

About 2 hours into lunch another sushi cutter comes frantically running in. It wasn't till he arrived that sushi started coming out.

Also the waiter and waitresses would walk away as you were trying to order. They would say that they had your order down as they walked away, however they would either forget items of bring out wrong items. 

Food was 4 stars, service was 1 star. I decided to go with 3 over all stars. All negative critique aside I will give it another try. If the service is corrected I see 5 star potential.",sgIQJ3j4bgvKXXqjAmV9VQ,3,1,3,N2fF8TeGg99MHb2cA_2Uug

I would have given it 4-5 stars the first visit but this second time was a very different experience.  We arrived for a 7:30pm reservation and got seated right away since it wasn't that crowded at all.  The place isn't that big of a place and only 4 tables were full when we got there so there was lots of empty tables.  

Our waitress took our first round order of white tuna, salmon skin salads, salmon kama, uni and 3 other rolls.  It took a very long time for the first dishes to come out even though the place wasn't packed...then another person comes and says that he will be our waiter and that our orders will be out soon.  Then he comes back and says that they ran our of uni cause another party ordered all the rest of the uni.  We waited for over 15 mins from placing our order and then they tell us that there is no uni!...Hmmm.  The main reason I came was to experience the uni as I did the first time.  

So we start to get our plates and they must have changed the Salmon skin salad cause it was not the same as before.  It was more like a wet salmon skin mix something...not too sure what it was.  It wasn't very tasty or appealing.  Most of the sushi rolls were decent to good and the salmon kama was actually really good.  So then we order another round of plates and they tell us they ran out of Kal bi or galbi as they call it on the menu.  So now the two most expensive things on the menu are out...okay.  The messed up part is that our waiter tells us that he's sorry but they ran out of Kalbi cause they got slammed with orders.  I looked at him and looked around at the half empty place and wondered how they got slammed with orders to run out when the place isn't even near full.  I thought he was actually joking at first but he was serious.  Keep in mind that this place is open till 2am and it was only 8:30pm.  

We continue with a few more orders and then decide to get dessert and call it a night.  So we order the Fried Ice Cream, Green tea ice cream, and Yuzu.  The waiter comes back and says that they are our of Green Tea Ice cream and also can't make the Fried ice cream cause they don't have the Green Tea ice cream for it.  At this point I just had to laugh cause they ran out of each of the most expensive items on the menu. 

So the lesson here is to make sure if you decide to go here, that they have the items you are most interested in and that AYCE only means it's AYCE of what they may have left.",lDhLy0ZiUoPm-SbbKjg9QQ,0,0,2,k5_juwsqpNGCzNN0C0HQuA

We love sushi and were not real big on eating just rolls. 
This place has a great selection not all just rolls but lots of items to choose from.
We tried so many different things.
The spicy tuna tare tar was so delicious as well as the salmon one, I was in heaven!!
Everything seemed very fresh and all the fish was cut in nice pieces. They did not skimp on the portions of fish. 
There were a few specials on the board we ordered to try and I highly recommend the boom boom special. What a taste and flavor. So many different textures , soft to chew but a little crunch to it with a sauce that I fell in love with! It had a light lemon flavor after taste but not over powering. I even tried eel for the first time! It wasn't bad!
I really enjoyed everything and we had so much on our table I never got any pictures to share.
I will for sure share pictures the next time we go which I hope is very soon again.
We are big fans of Yama Sushi but I really think we found a new place we will go to more often. 
Ended with some pineapple sorbet.

Excellent customer service and of course the food was delish! We yelp restaurants before we go out to eat and the reviews brought us here.,O6z_Zd4UBJtYfXvz51CsMA,0,0,4,BqpjbSR_4K6PpFozMSLgSg

5873255,2016-05-15,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Amazing food, great service. I really don't know how they do it for $26 all u could eat. Had all the star items, most the nigiri sushi and I must say, I'm impressed, especially for the price, it's kinda insane if u ask me. I was expecting old low quality crap sushi but far from that! 100 times better than any Japanese buffet! Will most definitely return!!!

Update:
Been here again for our latest trip to Vegas, awesome food, fast service, we love this place! Can't wait to go back! Sit at the bar for even faster service! Wish u guys the best!",HXGk1w1DG3lZU4rKsZd-3w,2,1,5,VD1yXEWfjRmnnKTOZ4-yeA

5923427,2017-09-15,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,Wow I dont even know what to say. We have been out of the area for a while. I haven't had sushi in 9 months. The first thing on my list to do when returning home to Vegas was Sushi Way. What happened to this place. The server kept forgetting what we ordered. So much rice on the one roll I ordered and also on the nigiri. The screaming orgasm was two cuts of tuna nigiri thrown over some daikon. The salmon tar tar that used to have a nice presentation was some salmon cut and tossed over a pile of crab salad. It seriously looked like some ones left over picked at appetizer. We used to eat here once a week and thought I would be doing that again. We will not be eating there any more. What a let down for my first sushi in 9 months. Its really just too bad.,7PL-LpoYdZpaaPeJzsM53Q,1,0,1,2GZlrA4P9WjEZ8qZwZm3UA
5924586,2017-10-31,2,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"On our way back from Zion in Utah, we were craving a buffet as a reward for the drive and being out in the wilderness. This place had pretty good reviews so we stopped by Saturday night around 8pm. Despite the great reviews, the place was pretty empty - not sure if it was a good or bad sign (no clue when the Vegas dinner rush hours are) but I was starving so I took it as a good sign. 

AYCE is $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner. The menu is pretty huge and also has a good variety of cooked stuff. Can't compare to other AYCE sushi Vegas places since we weren't local. 

The good:
- Service was amazing! Not sure if it is because it was half empty but props to their team - plus the food came out super fast 
- The fish didn't taste fishy. The fish to rice ratio is a little higher than I would prefer...I would say that it is average. The uni and sweet shrimp was super tasty. 

The meh:
- Don't get their oysters...it was way sauced up and didn't look terribly fresh
- Don't get their Galbi/Kalbi: super chewy 
- Their rolls / Sushi Nachos were way too saucy. Would not recommend 

Stick with their nigiri and don't get any of the cooked stuff or rolls. This place is 3.5, rounded down because I'm a little weary of places that offer free stuff (in this case - a soda) for reviews (that you have to show on the spot). 

Parking: pretty easy in a strip mall - on the side of Citibank and Urban Turban.",XYWjjklyITIAEBgnZtU-Mw,0,0,3,ipI5t9v_oTdEw0fdYdbEcw

5939934,2015-09-20,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"Not sure what happened with the staff but most of our orders were forgotten.  We had to re-order them.  The food was good but it felt like a hostage situation waiting to get all of our dinner for over 2 hours. Two parties left their tables out of frustration.  I am a pretty patient person but I started getting uncomfortable and embarrassed just only having drinks and nothing to eat in front of me for so long.  Even with nothing on our table the staff didn't bother checking in with us to see if we got our orders or wanted anything. To make matters worse it was a birthday dinner for my partner and I felt awful. 

I won't go back to this place.  I don't normally review places but the service here was just so bad and a waste of time.  If you do go here you'll probably enjoy the food but just make sure they don't forget about you.",zMtPMIUSunvzJdEeXXkMHw,0,0,1,G-ifMqcieIMiIpIyUF3kRw
5947609,2017-11-20,0,JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ,"One of the top AYCE sushi spots in town. We had a large group around 3pm, and opted for the dinner menu to get the few extra items.
 Great staff, relatively prompt with our orders. Fish tastes fresh, and good rice portions. Aside from the entrees, the dessert are absolutely delicious. The FBI (fried banana ice cream) is so awesome. Great thing is, the dessert items are unlimited too, so fill up to your heart's desire--other nice items include deep fried ice cream or mochi.  This is a great sushi spot, I'll definitely be back again.",0Vc0QPdSIhR5Zd0HTCDSAA,0,0,5,axbyKzUEJezDraqeChjDAg

And their coconut shrimp and green tea ice cream are the best! The service is excellent too. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of raw sea food and the staff patiently went through the menu with him.

I didn't realize I would end up loving this place, food and service. The staff is so friendly and attentive and makes great recommendations. The lunch server not only remembered me when I walked in the door, but he also remembered what I ordered and gave me the space I needed when I received an important call. I appreciate attentive staff as well as staff that can sense a guests needs (as mine can be tricky when I have a call). At any rate, the food is always fresh and fast. I have several favorites and I love the AYCE here, more than any other place. I will continue to make this a regular lunch spot!",NjuWSUbPENBIMKVeoqRKoA,0,0,5,Lc-od9QOuFOqbx2Jbca8dw
