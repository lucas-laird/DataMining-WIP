Simple, americanized tacos.  Crispy shell, ground meat, lettuce, cheese and salsa, but better than you could imagine. You get 3 in a basket and I think it's like $5 or $6.   The fries, aren't my favorite though, as they are the crinkle cut fries, but they're fries, so I don't really give a crap, I still eat them.  I've never had the stromboli, but it's good.  
In the bar part of the restaurant, you can also order food.  I usually get a mandarin (Absolut) and tonic and some tacos and sit at the bar and grub.  There's sports and random tv on....and they have a jukebox.  The people who work there are always friendly and get you what you want.  I've also had some really interesting conversations with people there....  
I used to live in Silverado Ranch, literally a stumble away from T-Birds.  I was there one night until 8:30 am.  Talking, drinking and just enjoying myself....
So, all in all, I love T-Birds.  Good, cheap food, good, cheap drinks and a decent place to enjoy it in.

408373,2010-09-27,1,tlZmJBQ9UWkaI0Zce_KFhg,"I've lived just a few miles from the T-Bird Lounge for years, and have never been inside till tonite.

It's not high-end, but it's not ugly, either. Not a dive-bar really, but definately not Ritzy. I had dinner there in the resturaunt-side, and can't really comment on the bar aspect of it.

I ordered the teriyaki wings, and they were excellent. T-Bird deep-fries, then sauces them, THEN puts them on the grill, to get even more crusty and slightlly charred. The teriyaki sauce  tasted homemade and was delicious.

The Stromboli of Doom was ordered by my MIL. She got the ""small"" size origional, and when it came out..I laughed like a hyena! It was HUGE! At least 5 pounds in weight, and the size of a school notebook. About 3 inches fat, it was just amazing! This ""small"" Stromboli can feed 3 or 4 people EASILY. The flavor is excellent, to match. Filled with pepperoni, salami, sausage and mozzerella cheese, it was VERY very filling! The dough around it was top-notch and light and flaky.

Service was very good. Attentitve and always with answers to lots of questions.

This is an ideal place to get simple food, prepared GREAT, for a cheap price. I'd highly reccommend it after going out after drinking/partying.

MUCH better than Village Pub or Goldfinger's. I have a new fave local place to go for great food! A huge bonus, they are a short block away from Neilsen's Frozen Custard, a perfect dessert after such a perfect meal!",DwS5fvL_BR1-uUaafGTkOQ,2,2,5,rFIUad8NFwOfvcWJRdh3tA

The non-breakfast menu gets a little iffy.  The restaurant is less than a block from my place.  But I rarely went the first two years I lived here because the (non-breakfast) food was consistently mediocre.  So one time I talked to the waiter and told me everything on the menu besides the stromboli and wings was suspect.  How do you f@#k up a club sandwich.  The found a way.  The stromboli, however,  is a huge pillow of pizza deliciousness.  The wings are ok, depending on the sauce you choose.

676890,2016-03-31,0,tlZmJBQ9UWkaI0Zce_KFhg,"Wanted my first review to be a positive one, but I just can't see that here. 

Went in last night 9pm. Been here before a few times last year. Had Meatloaf Special, Philly for son, Biscuits & Gravy to share as app and granddaughter ordered just fries. Viewing at the menu, I had to look around to see if I was dreaming! The prices are a bit crazy for the atmosphere and food quality. Meatloaf ($9.50) was 2 thin slices grilled, instant mash that was not stirred and was crusty on top, and water dunked vegetables that made the gravy on the meatloaf too thin. Philly ($10) was ok, but not a lot of meat. Biscuits & Gravy ($7) was ok. Two biscuits with sausage/white gravy. Gravy seemed powdered and it had exactly 4 little pieces of sausage in it. but all of the above is not the biggest issue..............

French Fries WERE $6.00..................  it was a decent normal size, BUT, at any other place they are $2.50-3.25. And NO, they were not cut fresh! They are the old school frozen crinkle cut that cost .40 cents a pound! Just because you put them in the Appetizer section and not the Sides section, YOU DOUBLE THE PRICE??? Nice try, but in my mind you drive people away by doing that. 

Pizza price was raised as well. $15 for a small cheese. $18 for a large cheese...... No words for that. You have a seperate dining area for families, but for the same money, there are way too many other, better options for less $$$$

Perhaps the marketing/menu crew should visit Village Pub or Mulligan's to see what pricing and quality should be.",X9zNBcfDZ59S8-zW_2gniw,1,0,2,fgO6W9nFlcT8rDWSx6_lPA

758583,2013-02-02,0,tlZmJBQ9UWkaI0Zce_KFhg,"5 Stars for T-bird Lounge
 T-bird Lounge is a local restaurant and tavern in the Silverado Ranch area. Growing up in Vegas it's always been a common stop for a quick affordable bite to eat. Whether you're looking for a family-friendly dinner, late night snack, or a great place to have a beer after work this is the place to go! The atmosphere is no fancy steak house but since the remodel the place has a great comfortable feel. The restaurant is all seat yourself and you're given a great variety of whether you want to be seated in a booth or a table. TV's are located around the whole restaurant and the bar area. During the holidays the staff always goes the extra mile to decorate the place and bring a little cheer to your experience there. They have a couple trophies won by their softball team hanging around the restaurant to add to the sense of community. With the new separation of the restaurant from the bar you can enjoy your dinner without the common Vegas problem of being surrounded by smokers. 
 The food available there for the price they offer is just unbeatable! With years of ordering their teriyaki chicken wings charbroiled under my belt, I can easily say they are the best you can find. Other places like Buffalo Wild Wings may offer more sauces to choose from but T-birds wings are not only more affordable but just so much more satisfying. If you're a fan of the hot stuff I dare you to give their hot wings a shot, if you don't like to sweat I'd stay far away from them. If you're planning on taking your kids out with you they have a great kid's meal options and some of the best chicken fingers you can ask for. Their chicken fingers are all white meat and the batter is fresh and crispy, you might even catch yourself stealing some from your kids. If you're feeding a huge party or just feeling mighty brave give one of their famous Stromboli's a shot. I must warn you though the portions are much more then you expect. It is nearly impossible to finish the large Stromboli even with five people in tow, be prepared for tons of leftovers! 
 Though I'm a stickler for their dinner and lunch items they also make a killer breakfast. If you're a lover of some good old southern cooking, their chicken fried steak is very tender and the gravy is creamy and a great compliment to the dish. I can't pass up adding a side of fluffy pancakes to whatever breakfast I do decide on. Breakfast is available at all hours of the day so for those of you who love some French toast for dinner your set. They also offer some healthier alternatives for those looking for a few less calories or working on their cholesterol such as oatmeal, fruit cups, and cottage cheese. Every once in a while I happen to go in for breakfast when one of the classic car groups are having a get together, such a great time seeing all the vintage cars in the parking lot!  
 No matter what you're ordering off the menu T-birds staff is there to make sure your experience is a great one. As soon as you are seated the staff is always right there to greet you no matter how busy it is. The restaurant is filled with regulars and don't be surprised if after a couple times of going there one of the waitresses remembers your name and even your order! Many times I've been personally greeted by the manager Mary Alice always curious of how you're enjoying your meal and if there's anything else she could do to better your time at T-birds. This courtesy isn't exclusive to just the restaurant side either the bartenders are always on the move and making sure you are taken care of at the bar. The swing shift bartender DJ is always on top of her job and your drink never gets a chance to run low even on a packed night. T-bird attracts a great group of regulars that add to the great feel of T-bird and you'll always hear laughter ringing through the place. The bar area also offers a selection of video poker and a separate area for pool and shuffle board for those who don't just like to sit around. T-birds also has the NFL football package so you can catch all of your games come Sunday. 
 All in all if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal with the family or a great place to hang-out on your night off the T-bird is worth your time to check out. The restaurant offers a great environment suitable for bringing the entire family for a good bite to eat, a place for teens to meet up with their friends after a big high school football game, or an older couple to come in and get their usual. For the older crowd a bar to meet some new friends and share a couple drinks over good music and food. This place is much more than the PT's and Goldfinger's found on every corner in Las Vegas, T-bird Lounge is one of the local hidden treasures and that's what keeps me coming every time I'm back in town!",WTG3f4ArTrirvIwy9HTzjA,0,0,5,K8OHupUtcccNXI6GigAwKA

Monday night football. Cowboys and Redskins. I'm watching it as I type this. (Yes I'm at the bar writing this review). The women tending the bar are very nice and friendly. That was my first impression. The next thing that impressed me was the $2.50 bud light happy hour. One of the quickest beers I've been served. Went with the ""Surf & Turf"" - steak, fried shrimp, potatoes/fries, Texas toast, coleslaw. Food took a good amount of time to cook but the huge tv screen right in front me of me with the game playing distracted my stomach for the most part. Food finally arrived, and let me tell you it was delicious. They cooked the steak perfectly medium rare like I like it and shrimp were on point. I went with french fries cause I was already craving them before dinner. They have the thick waffle fries  and are bomb. the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the little food table/tray that slides along the bar that you eat on isn't very sturdy and when I was cutting my steak the plate would spin because the tray and wobbling like crazy. That and the fact that there's very limited eating space, given I have a big plate, a beer, a side plate with Texas toast, and another little bowl with coleslaw... I didn't have enough room for everything. The video slots affected that the most.

Pro's: They still have the same menu; Food quality is still decent; Wait staff is generally pleasant; Juke box and billiard options are a nice touch; Prices are reasonable. 

Cons: Often times (late at night), the bartender is the server and (although generally friendly), it feels like diners are ""in the way"" of bar ops. The bartenders during the Day and Swing hours do not seem overly friendly - to say the least. The atmosphere is not as ""cozy"" as the Tropicana location used to be (and perhaps still is).

T bird is the place to go to enjoy some good old fashioned shuffle board.

Our waitress was very nice and friendly. She even recommended the fried ice cream, which was good but it's not fried ice cream. It's more like a donut filled ice cream. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but the name isn't fitting. 

This place would have been four stars but the set up is uncomfortable. It's too bright inside and there's three different areas that make it awkward. Our waitress couldn't really see us and how we were doing. The shuffle board pool table area is higher and hidden. Then the diner area is hidden as well by the entrance on the left. T birds would make a killing if it had some new decor. Jason and I actually discussed it while playing shuffle board. The wall has an old car and there's a few old cars elsewhere. T birds could make this place less 1960 old diner feeling into a sexy 2000 girls on top of classic cars feeling. Just saying. Maybe make the walls darker, dim the lights and change the booths by the pool table to bar stools. Lastly, seeing the extra paper goods above the locker type wall cabinets just looked unprofessional.

Coming in, the place was virtually empty, maybe two or three other people at the bar. The lounge/bar is pretty typical: large bar with plenty of seats, video poker, pool tables tucked away in the corner and a couple of high tops/booths. 

We seated ourselves and the bartender quickly handed us our menus. The menu here is huge, about 4 or 5 pages, with at-least 10 different kinds of burgers/sandwiches, pizzas, and plenty of appetizers. I was surprised to learn that they didn't have any late night food or drink specials. The bartender didn't really have any recommendations so we ended up ordering some nachos and chicken fingers with fries. 

The nachos were OK at best. For whatever reason the cook decided to heap on extra olives and douse the whole dish with sour cream. The chicken fingers and fries were pretty good but at ~$10 I expected more. For the price, I could gotten better food at BJ's or Yard House.

The  large Stromboli is also probably the biggest dish offered in Las Vegas.  I seriously can't think of any single order here in town that you can get bigger.  T-Bird should have a challenge for anyone who can eat a large one and Man vs. Food should do a piece on it as well.  It's that big!  Not only that, it is also tasty and at a very reasonable price.

This place was close to home, so we checked it out early Saturday for breakfast. We were told to sit where we liked. Wendy immediately greeted us with a smile. As we waited for breakfast, we noticed that there was a t.v. on in every corner. Nice. 

Creamer for our coffees was already at the table, and there were flavored ones as well. I ordered eggs benedict with regular bacon, and my husband got the biscuits and gravy. We always split our breakfast, so the biscuits were more of a 'side dish' for us. The food came out quickly, and looked decent. I got a generous portion of potatoes with my benedict, and there were two biscuits split in half smothered with gravy for his. 

The potatoes were by far the best part of the breakfast. They tasted great. Nicely browned and flavorful. The benedict was not too bad. The hollandaise was very lemony in flavor, but otherwise pretty mild. The biscuits and gravy were also very mild in flavor. The pepper shaker on the table was really lame. It only allowed a small amount of powdery pepper to flow. Nothing major, but I really don't like those types of pepper shakers. 

Wendy really made the breakfast enjoyable. She was genuinely happy and cheerful throughout our visit. The food was decent, and we would be willing to try out more items from the menu. As we were leaving, it was starting to get fairly busy in here.

Breakfast is okay.  Most of the breakfast food tastes a little bland.  They have chicken fried steak, ham, eggs, omelettes and other stuff.  Nothing ever impressed me much.  There are quite a few good things for dinner though.

The stromboli is humongous.  I have been dared to eat the large one before, and have failed.  I think I can do it if I give it another chance though.  I just need to not eat for 3 days beforehand.  I finished off a large stromboli with a friend and the bartender was impressed as even with two people it's a lot of food.  In addition to being enormous, it's also quite tasty.
