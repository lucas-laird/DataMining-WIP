Membership is not required although it will get you some discounts depending on your level. I think you may actually have to have some Italian in you to be a member, too bad for me :( 

Take a seat at the bar and enjoy cheap drinks and free snack mix. The juke box has a nice selection of old timers and if you're there on Wednesdays they almost always have some type of entertainment. Sometimes the place gets pretty movin with a lot of people dancing in the bar area. 

After a few brewskis why not have some dinner too! The food is great and also affordably priced. 

Hope to see you there!",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,6,1,5,MEQFw9DViXhbcgR9nMrYQA

The waiter was top notch with his service and suggestions for wine and entrees.  The wine was very good that he brought out.  I had veal picatta;  it's hard to find good veal but this was great.  Very tender and flavorful.  The picatta sauce was very good as well.  Had pasta on the side and the red sauce was good.  Not my sauce, but good.  The two gents that I was with enjoyed their meals as well.

The whole experience was very nice and we were not rushed in the least.

I'll be back with my wife (who is Italian).",nIIs_jGWQxSyqolc4GPgNA,2,1,4,9M4PZEpHasTG6iYVQxzEFg

Your waterglass will never be empty because the staff is very attentive. My husband loved his chicken parmesan. I wasn't a fan of the gemelli alla, but my salad was great. We both enjoyed the tiramisu.  They make it fresh there. We will definitely return and I will try a different dish.

The dining room and restroom were very clean. We went on a Thursday night and it was quite busy. Be sure to make reservations  (as we did). The crowd was lively, so expect a little noise.

From the time we drove up and viewed the now windows building with the large roman states out front we knew we were in for an authentic experience.
Our reservation was at 7pm on Good Friday. We arrived on time and were seated promptly. Although every table appeared to be full, we were informed that this was a ""Slow Friday Night"" since it was Good Friday and that they normally ""Four Deep"" in the area that had a row of only two tables. While we were there, an old school Lounge singer was performing on the small stage area. Throughout the evening, folks would get up from their tables and dance between them. As guests walked in the stopped at tables saying hello to the other people they knew. Folks got up from their tables and sat at others briefly to chat. There were so many people in there with East Coast accents that, if I didn't know, I would have thought I was somewhere is Essex County NJ! Since I was born and raised in Jersey and spend my 20's in NYC, I really appreciated the family feel of this place.
Our server was very light, funny and helpful. He made great recommendations and check on wines since he wasn't familiar with the one we were interested in. We ordered the Fried Mozzarella to start. This came with two large wedges of Mozzarella and a ""Gravy"" (marinara) that was like my husband' Neapolitan Grandma used to make! For Dinner, I ordered the Cheese Ravioli with a Vodka sauce. It was AMAZING...and I am a Vodka Sauce snob! My husband ordered a Caesar Salad and a Sausage. He was in heaven with the sweet flavored Sausage. Too many times restaurants use so much fennel in the sausage that it is overpowering. Not here- it was spot on! My 12 year old daughter ordered the Lobster Milanese, one of the nightly specials. The portion of Lobster was very good considering the $27 price! And the pasta was so good that my husband and I kept stealing bites. For Dessert we ordered the Chocolate Turtle Tartuffo. It too was absolutely delicious. In addition, they make a great double espresso.
I wish we lived closer to this establishment because we would take on a membership! We will go back to the IAC EVERY TIME we are in Vegas...and so should you!",eB4Di9lCbTClwTwv96gaeA,2,2,5,FL7Y8yS0KgfgnQWoDA_PpA

Sunday May 24th 6:30 - made reservation- good idea-  parking lot full.  Entrance crowded and noisy- immediately escorted to our table for 4.  Service slow due to Gorman HS graduation party - 100 people.  Did not mind as we were taking it all in.  Waiter John was enthusiastic and entertaining.  Said Rene was busy and he was helping out.  I mentioned I heard Shecky Green was here last week- John said turn around - Shecky is at table behind you - and there was one of the funniest and smartest comedians ever - with a large party.    Dinner- we had  calamari fritti -perfect and succulent as were sauces, caesars salads (split 2 - 4 plates - no problem),  Sole parmigiano (excellent and good portion), veal parmigiano (very good - tender),  spaghetti bolognese,  capellini pomodoro (special order) and dessert.   Bread was 4 star with great flavored butter.  Then Shecky got up and did at least a half hour performance - he is 89 and looks 20 years younger - his voice and renditions of Pavoratti, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dean Martin are superb.  His commentary on LV as it was in its golden years brought back many memories.  I felt like we were in a time machine and Frank Sinatra might walk in the door any moment.  Shecky introduced his lovely wife and commented that he felt we were all family in this crowded old Italian restaurant - and for 2 magical hours I felt the same way.  We will be back soon and often.

This is our third time there. First time that we went we had server Rene, he was the best. Next was a female, I don't know her name, she was nice, but not the caliber of Rene. This time back to service from Rene. I took a friend there for his birthday. We ate way too much, we got the shrimp cocktail and calamari for apps. They were both really good. The shrimp were huge but for 4 pieces, not really worth $16. The calamari was super. It was light, and cooked perfectly.
For entrees, my friend got the chicken Francaise. It was melt in your mouth good. I mean superb. I got something called Gemolata de Beverly Hills, or something close to that. It was really good pasta dish with chicken, olives and more, but next time I'm getting the chicken francaise. 
Anyways, super great time, the only downer was that the main guy, the guy obviously in charge that walks around and sees how tables are doing.... I think his name is Ben as he has pictures on the wall where you come in with different guests and one guy signed it to Ben. Well we were a table of 2. He walked by, never slowed, never really gave a cr** about us and twice just sort of threw out a ""how ya doing"". Well it didn't really matter how we were doing as he was past our table without slowing before any answer could possibly come out. We were only a table of two, although after dinner and drinks, tax n tip we had spent $130. You'd think he could have taken a minute out of his day to make us feel welcomed. He spent 4 or 5 minutes at the tables that were 4 people, 5 people. Also spent a good bit of time, and in several visits with a table just two over from us in the corner. It was a table of 3. An elderly guy, a young guy, and a woman. He kept going back and spending all kinds of time with them. Maybe they write his check, maybe he wants to sell them a car, maybe he wanted a date (just trying to give excuses as to why he was so rude to us and so kiss their bu**s to them) Also with the table of two in the same room that he obviously knew. In the adjoining room about 5 minutes laughing and talking with a table of 5 or 6. Just made us feel like even though we were spending a lot of money, that we weren't anything to him but money. 
I'd say that even though I love the food, don't go if you are only a table of two. As ben will in his own way make you feel less than accepted. If you are a large group or know him, then do go if just a table of two as ben will cater to you. He really should treat all tables well, too bad he doesn't. 
If you do go, Rene is the best server.

1828897,2016-08-19,1,4Odbtgh9g8XUKorRg7MTHg,"Dear Italian-American children,
When we were growing up we looked forward to Sunday dinner with family. It always consisted of sauce, macaroni, and dessert. We would group together with family and friends, tell stories, and laugh. When the food and festivities came to an end we always shared that feeling of content. We were happy and full, and we felt the bond of family. 

One day we grew up and went our separate ways. We have always craved the feelings that remind us of what it was like growing up. On occasion we find a place that brings back those memories. The Italian American Social Club is one such place.

The owner Benny treats patrions like family. The food is an upscale twist on what Nana used to make. The atmosphere is relaxing and enhanced by the live music. This is a weekly-type spot.

From the appetizers to the entrees to the desserts, everything was amazing. It felt like home and I loved every second. Our server, Andrea, was the best. Her recommendations were spot on.

My wife and I were the youngest ones in the room. Not kidding. Lol The singer this evening was Rita Lim. She sang beautifully. I felt like I was back in old Vegas. Back when longe acts were good and food was old school.

For an appetizer, we ordered the Fried Mozarella. It was really good. My wife ordered the Sole Parmigiano. Apparently, IAC's most popular dish. Once you taste it, you will see why. I ordered the Veal Piccaita. So rich and flavorful that I got on the treadmill this morning. Lol

2746899,2015-07-23,0,4Odbtgh9g8XUKorRg7MTHg,"What a pleasant surprise and an overall treat.

I had the opportunity to experience a family style multi-course meal in a private party room there based around a 55th wedding anniversary I attended with the family, and walked away both full and beaming (being Italian myself).

Although some of the décor was a little gaudy and slightly dated, the place has a lot of Italian heritage and feeling all about.  Pictures of Frank Sinatra, various entertainers and other Italian luminaries dot the walls, as well as some Roma inspired statues outside (which make for great picture opportunities).   Our private room was a tad darker than I would have liked, and was subject to a bit of loud music from the live entertainment even though we tried closing the door a few times.

However, the food really shines.  Although the menu was determined in advance, I couldn't complain one bit.  Starting with some slice bred, the pesto/parmesan and olive tapenade butters were very unique and savory.  Next was a small dinner salad, not overly dressed to get our appetites going.

Main family style dishes consisted of: Rigatoni in a meaty Bolognese sauce (awesome), handmade meatballs, and I can't rave enough of their chicken picatta.  The picatta sauce made with fresh lemons and capers was to die for....that sauce packed a flavor punch.  Another fan favorite of our was the Gemelli Alla 'Beverly Hill' pasta: A unique combination with twist of Gemelli Pasta, Baby Spinach, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Kalamata Olives & Chunks of Smoked Chicken, simmered with extra Virgin Olive Oil & Toasted Garlic...AWESOME.

The staff was kind enough to make us all feel valued, and even went as so far to sing an anniversary song, and cut/serve our own cake that we brought in from an outside bakery.

This place is gem for anyone who wants to experience a taste of Italian-American culture, whether it be a small date, a family, or a large reunion.  Food is very good despite the initial impressions of a little over-the-top outside/inside décor, and outdoor lot (valet optional).

The live music was great and the acustics in the room was pretty impressive. For the food my group started with the meatballs with ricotta cheese. Nice and moist with the sauce being an excellent compliment to the meat.

For entrees we had the lamb chops, ribeye, and a stuffed chicken breast dish that I can't remember the name of to save my life lol.

My favorite was the perfectly cooked lamb chops in there own juices with the dipping sauce on the side put it way over the top. 

The manager came by the table at the end of the meal and comped us a round of lemon chello.. How cool is that. 

To finish off the night we split some cheese cake and tiramisu.. the cheese cake was sublime... gotta get this if you come here.",D3fOi-5w4intrUTWXzIQew,2,3,5,LJ-aEUL71vVF37fRf1kSzA

The restaurant is old school Las Vegas. The walls are covered with photos of hotels/casinos and and photos of many of the entertainers/celebrities. 
The restaurant consists of several dining rooms which adds to a cozy feeling. Service was top notch. Our server John and the entire wait staff was in constant motion and working as a team helping serve and clean up. The manager continuously made the rounds offering a friendly welcome and following up on our satisfaction.
The evening began with a fantastic dinner. The menu is varied and contains some great Italian classics not found at other restaurants. 
Our appetizer was a large bowl of Escarole & Beans, plenty for sharing. Served  warm, very tasty greens and tender beans.
The Chicken Picatta entree is made with four large slices of breast meat sauteed with white wine, lemon and capers. Simply juicy and tender with great flavor. Served with roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables.
Chicken Involtini is one of those must have entrees because it is not widely available. A large breast of chicken that is rolled after being stuffed with spinach, prosciutto and covered with mushrooms and a rich brown gravy. Served with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. 

The finale Tiramisu - is layered with mascarpone, ladyfingers,espresso and Belgian cocoa. This one is a perfect balance of flavors. Not everyone gets it right but these folk do.
 
Considering the high quality and large portions, the food is reasonably priced. Wine and cocktails are also reasonable.

After dinner we moved to the show room where we were entertained for 90 minutes by the talented Michael Monge. The music is for those that enjoy the old standards, a mix of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Bobby Darren, Tom Jones and Dion. Backed by a five piece band that had us rockin and rollin. There is also a small dance floor for those that would like to work off the dinner. 
We will definitely plan the trip across town more often",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,6,3,4,Jg_xQ9vlkNkC7HwMAvCkgg

Very crowded.
It looks like an old family owned restaurant. Made me laugh when we saw the sign on the parking lot saying: ""this place is reserved for Luigi only"". I guess Luigi must be the owner and/or founder of this place. 
When you enter on you left hand side you can see a wall of fame with all the older singers and stars that were used to perform or come to this place. 
In fact in the next room Steve Lawrence was having dinner and 2 tables away from us Pia Zadora  was here too. 
The menu was a set up menu for that special day, so I don't know what they normally served. That was very classic Caesar salad and different kinds of antipasti then osso buco and other more or less Italian entrees.

I was seated promptly and given a menu.  Someone quickly came for drink order and I soon had my iced tea.  After asking my server, Andrea, some questions about portion sizes, I went with a Caesar salad to start and veal marsala for my main course.  I was brought bread that was accompanied by three butters--one regular, one pesto flavored, and one olive flavored. 

My salad was quite large and it was very good.  Light on the dressing but heavy with the cheese and the cheese is done a different way.  The parmesan slices are baked in a bowl and broken and put in pieces under and throughout the salad.  This baking gives the cheese extra flavor and I really enjoyed the salad.

The veal was very good.  The marsala sauce was rich and flavorful.  With the dish came a choice of side--either pasta or potato--and I took the daily pasta of ziti with marinara.  This was a good dish of pasta.

I asked Andrea for her recommendation on dessert.  She to;d me her favorite was cannoli, but I have been disappointed by some restaurants in the past with cannoli so I went with her second choice--their house made tiramisu.  It was very good  with mascarpone, lady fingers, espresso and Belgian cocoa.  The espresso was not overpowering and the same for the cocoa.  It was a perfectly balanced, creamy, tasty ending to the meal.

Service was excellent!  All the servers and bussers constantly circulated through the two rooms.  No table was just one person's.  Rather, they all looked out for each other and served the customers well.  This is somewhat why I call it old school.

It is also as good as any Italian resturuant I have ever been to anywhere else in the country (including NY/NJ). Unlike most of the celebrity chefs on the strip (who have a habit of taking classic dishes, and ruining them through over complication and using ingredients that stray too far off from the traditional dish), the chefs at the Italian American Club know, that sticking to the traditional recipes of Italian classic dishes, is what great Italian food is all about. As far as the place's ambience, it has an old world charm of a simple local family run restaurant (also, at times, they have a live band playing Italian music, which gives the place even more character). Prices are very reasonable (many entrees under $20). The service was also great, and all the waiters are smiling and very friendly.

My friend, who travels the world for business, ordered the spaghetti carbonara and said it was as close as he's ever tasted to what they serve in Italy.  Another friend ordered the stuffed pepper appetizer.  It was stuffed with spicy sausage and was absolutely delicious.  Because we had such a large group, we were able to get the limo bus.  Johnny, the driver, gave the best customer service.   He called me no less than three separate times, including the day of the reservations, to ensure that all the details of time and place of pickup were covered.   The limo bus has a great sound system and we were treated to Phantom of the Opera.  On the way there, we were all pretty chatty so I'm not sure anybody heard it.  On the way back, stuffed and borderline comatose from all the amazing food, we quietly sat and listened to the music.

4484670,2012-03-04,17,4Odbtgh9g8XUKorRg7MTHg,"If anyone had told me that I, a Jewish girl from Brooklyn and former hippie, would be living in Vegas and watchin a '30s-'40's swing show in the Italian-American Social Club, I'd think they'd just arrived on the first flight from Mars.  There's just no end to the Secrets of Sin City!

How'd we get there?  An offering from LV House Seats.  It was definitely not my speed, but the description was intriguing.  And, they serve dinner (optional), so we figured we could kill two birds with one bocce ball.

Aside from the fact that the average age of the audience was the wrong side of 75 (the saxophone player is 96 - and I am, to plagiarize Dave Barry, NOT making this up), the show was delightful. The reason for the offer was because the second part of the show was being taped for TV and will be seen on some local cable station - which one escapes me - in a few weeks.

Jeanne Brei was the singer and star of the show, which runs the first Thursday of every month.   She's a pro - a woman of a certain age with a great voice and more energy than a 10-year-old.  The band is incredibly talented and date back to the very beginning of Vegas history - the sax player played with Benny Goodman, and all the other ""youngsters"" probably have a combined 200 years of experience.  She and the band are known as the Speakeasy Swingers.  Though listening to music such as ""Pennies from Heaven"" is definitely not my cup of Chianti, the show was very enjoyable.  

There's also a large dance floor, populated mostly with a few professional dancers, but some regular couples got up to dance, too, though not the 95-year-old woman in the wheelchair who used to do solo flying.  The second part of the show, the one that'll be shown on TV, featured Jeanne, a talented tap dance duo, and solos by a couple of very good singers.

But this is Yelp, so now to the food.  It was mostly terrific.  And no surprise - Italian!  I ordered Chicken Marsala.  I couldn't see the chicken, because it was buried under more mushrooms than I've ever seen on this dish - dark, woodsy, mushrooms in an authentic and rich Marsala sauce.  The same sauce, with even more mushrooms, covered the perfectly-cooked linguine served alongside it.  Hubby had Chicken Piccata, and it, too, was different - it was garnished with beautiful THINGS:  were they uncured olives? capers on steroids?  They're not my thing, so I couldn't tell, but my husband sure loved them.  Both entrees came with a small, unremarkable dinner salad in an unfortunate styrofoam bowl, and the bread, which should have been as wonderful as the food, was awful.  

I think there's no cover for the show, and the fact that it was offered on LV House Seats was merely to ensure an audience for the taped portion.  Sometime during the evening a gentleman walked around with a basket collecting contributions ""for the band.""

The large room is, no surprise, very dated - probably dates back to the Bugsy era, and there's a full bar in a completely separate room, with a juke box.

This is surely worth a trip - for the entertainment, the food, and the nostalgia of a bygone era.  And you can even go for free Salsa lessons on the other Thursdays!!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,21,20,4,ypzwXZjEMpMoX4eZmpSDww

That's the nicest word I can use to sum up our evening.
My husband and I are locals and we were super excited to take our out of town visitors here for a nice Sunday dinner. We made a reservation at 5pm for a table for four at 7pm. When we arrived at 7:04pm, we were told they didn't have a reservation in our name. They ""found it"" soon thereafter and took us to a table towards the back of the ballroom. The hostess forgot the menus, so those were brought separately. Our server, Valarie told us to look over the wine list and she would come back. I looked around and there were four tables occupied... Ten minutes later in the middle of taking our drink orders, she said, ""oh, hold on a sec"" and left the room. She didn't come to finish taking our drink orders for another ten minutes. To make a long, horrible story short... Our food took over 45 minutes to come after we ordered it (three tables in the room occupied), halfway through eating a four top of EXTREMELY drunk, sorely under dressed people were sat next to us. They knocked over trays and room dividers. One man pawed the manager and got in a fight with a fake tree. The manager just sat him back down next to me. They yelled and cursed so loud we could hear every word of their drunken disgusting conversation. The manager sat down at the table on the other side of us to eat his dinner. SERIOUSLY?! At 9:15pm we had to flag our waitress down do ask for our check. We finally got out of there at 9:29pm. 
The food was decent. Too much garlic on all four plates and there was hardly any oil on my caprese salad. All this for $177 plus tip? What a joke.",WwoM6hQbgPnzcX3taqK-xQ,7,2,1,G99Hho05hRO0rMopJqTY5w

My wife had the Cheese Ravioli and said that it was fresh and the pasta was tender as if it were freshly made.  Actually it probably was fresh.  

On a closing note, their Tiramisu is no doubt the best I have ever had in my life. My family is Sicilian, but I am certain that none of my family or friends could make a Tiramisu better than IAC.  I highly recommend it.

If you have a chance to venture off of the Vegas strip then you MUST eat at the Italian American Club.  Keep in mind that it is best to make reservations a few days in advance.  You will not be disappointed.",VFYo3XFnR9njhSpQiXMjhQ,5,3,5,t_B0IL41xPHGYttL9uHyLA

Each time I, along with the people that have gone there with me, cannot get over how great the food is. Literally I have not had a bad meal and the prices are ridiculously low but the quality is 5 star. The calamari is some of the best I've had. Not rubbery like you get at a lot of places. I've had the spaghetti, the veal piccata and the chicken parm...all great...the stuffed peppers are incredible...best I've had outside of buffalo...you'll love their Lemoncello. It makes a great palate cleanser after a great meal. 

They always have a band in the lounge but unlike most places where the music is so loud you cant carry on a conversation, they're more like great background music. Benny (who's is a fellow Buffalonian) is a fantastic host. He always makes sure that me and my party are well taken care of. I'm going back to Vegas in 2 weeks and am very excited to once again be going to my favorite Sin City restaurant.",w86A2itkve_7XFL4HpjSSg,3,1,5,B7pvp8x3_nsks97kpNOiWw

We were seated in the back so we could not see the stage - my mother thought the music playing was taped songs by Frank Sinatra, etc...she could not believe they were real live singers - their voices were that good!
All of our food was great.  Calamari rocked.  Caesar salad maybe not so much.  I had the chicken eggplant dish - and it was beyond delicious  - everyone thought I got the best dish.  
Service was top notch.  Owner came over to meet us and thank us.  Sent us complimentary limoncello's.  And since we were staying downtown - and they said it was difficult to get a cab there - they sent us home for free in their private party bus!

They also ran out of their special (the prime rib) and didn't tell us until we had been waiting 20 minutes after ordering. Water refills were slow to come by and we only ever got one order of bread, even after asking for more. Staff seemed overworked",M85_Tg0ukZqpke8U3smDyg,1,0,2,bjLIg4YBWS059IYqjU2EUw

I do have to say that my salmon was very dry, but I thoroughly enjoyed the bread and appetizers, and of course, the wine! It was a Saturday night and this place was happening! After our meal the owner invited us into the lounge and bought us a round of drinks, so we listened to the live music, sang, danced, and then listened to a comedian that came on.

The Cabernet was just ok, a short pour and pricy. Can't complain too much about the lounge singer, since there was no cover charge, but he should NOT cover Bruno Mars LOL

They brought us out the bread basket which was very good.  The crust crisp and the middle soft and warm.  They serve it with 3 different butters - plain, pesto butter and olive butter.  For our main entree I had the chicken marsala with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.  I substituted the pasta for garlic mashed potatoes without a problem.  My husband had the special which was the braciole which he absolutely loved which was served on top of a bed of pasta.

Sauteed Calamari were golden and excellent--both tentacles and rings.  And, while an order of Fried Mozzarella seemed slim (2 elongated triangles), the fried cheese was rich with gooey flavor.  To finish our trio of apps on a high note, a Shrimp Cocktail sported cold large shrimps as good as can be found at some of the best high-end steakhouses, along with not too spicy Fra Diavolo Sauce.

A bowl of Wedding Soup was fine and buttery.  And, my Caesar Salad was cheesy and quite tasty with crisp croutons, graced by a delicate light Caesar Dressing.

A big portion of Veal Parmigiano featured thinly pounded veal rendered tan with an enjoyable amount of melted cheese and tomato sauce on top, served with well-cooked Angel Hair with garlic in a light sauce and al dente broccolini.  Diane received a double portion of delectable Roasted Potatoes and extra Alfredo Sauce for her Veal Parm Alfredo.  

Besides the authentic Italian atmosphere--with fashionably well-dressed ladies sprinkled throughout the dining room, and the place filled to capacity on a Saturday night--and the superb food, service was excellent and attentive.
