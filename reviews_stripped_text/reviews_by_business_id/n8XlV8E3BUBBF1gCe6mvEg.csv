So, 26.00 dollars later, I take the two subs home (Roast Beef and a Ham n Cheese). I would have to say the subs were ok but just ok.

227626,2014-06-28,0,n8XlV8E3BUBBF1gCe6mvEg,"My wife and I are from PHILLY and when it comes to sandwiches, we know what good is. This establishment makes a 5 star sandwich, hoagie, sub or whatever else you want to call it.  They pack the roll with top quality meats and cheeses that are so yummy you can't stop eating, even when your stuffed. The portions are more than ample. A large sandwich is plenty for two people. 

As an added bonus, if you purchase the yelp coupon for $10 and spend $20 or more you receive $10 off the bill. (I assume this refers to sandwiches, only). In any event, offering 50 per cent off is a major sacrifice for a small business. Especially in this inflationary market. 

For us, it was a win, win situation. and we felt it was only right to return their generosity by spending a little extra and TIPPING the nice lady who made the sandwiches. 

BTW, while I was waiting for my sandwich the board of health inspected the place and replaced their already existing A-rated cert with a more current A-rated cert. 

If you can recognize a good deal and appreciate an immaculate eatery with high quality deli meat, and large portions I highly recommend the House of Vino.",X51p5nYTxEWkLyLwEeXSRA,2,0,5,acmiH827C-m-gUa1NvNe2g

I used a groupon to try this place out since I wasn't sure it would be good and I am glad I did because it wasn't worth my money. I had a meatball hero and my hubby had the Classic Italian sub. The meatball was cold, soggy, the meatballs looked undercooked and overall flavorless. Nothing special. The meatball sub at Firehouse is WAY better. It's great that they have Boar's Head meat, but they missing pizazz to make them stick out from all the other sub shops. I did not try their pizza so I don't know if its any good. The store is basically a convenience liquor store with a Boar's Head Deli that also makes pizza. A weird combo if you ask me. I felt like I was in a gas station.

1170774,2013-08-07,2,n8XlV8E3BUBBF1gCe6mvEg,"This place was strange. But good. Read on...

We got a groupon, $10 for $20, and thought, 'why not'? Well, they advertised pizzas, but didn't have any that particular day. So we got sandwiches. It only took the little old sandwich chef 20 minutes to make two sandwiches. And we were the only people in the store. 

The prices were a bit hefty. If not for the groupon they would've been way outside of our budget. And once you get them there is not place to sit. We ate ours in the hot, hot, hot car sitting outside of the Taco Bell next door.

But I gotta say, despite the wait and price, the sandwiches were very, very good. I got the Godfather. 11.99 for a large, but filled with prosciutto, mortadella, capicola, salami, provalone, veggies, etc. It was gooooood. Almost a little to rich, all those crazy meats. A word to the wise, make sure the dressing comes on the side, or else the bread gets soggy fast.
Sarie got the Cali club with turkey avocado and Swiss; 8.99 for a large. It was good as well. Put the mustard on the side.

Now these sandwiched weren't really all that large, but they were as dense as a collapsing supernova. My goodness, the little old sandwich chef must've but these babies in a headlock then done an atomic Indian rug burn to twist and roll all that meat into the size it was. And of that, I am a fan. 

I will get another groupon and go back, but now I know to bring it home lest the Manager at Taco Bell calls the cops on us. 

Or maybe House of Vino could spring for a table and chairs and umbrella??? Or maybe I'll just bring my own, dammit!",Gu-rR-zYcWo3mPPkUHXUrA,2,1,3,rLlea0WOEgYHvpi-F0QWbQ

I walked around the store area while I was waiting, and it seemed like their liquor and wine as also spendy.  I didn't expect Lees/Total prices, but was hoping for grocery store prices, and it was still higher than that.
