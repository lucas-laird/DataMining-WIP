SHABU is is 9.99 per person and has to have a minimum of two people for the order. Meat is a decent portion but I order more which was only 5.99 more. SESAME SEED sauce ! Side dishes were pretty good too! Great kimchi!

For sure got to come back and try BBQ",0gcUB8tSeuHh0cAAybInHQ,2,2,4,x2ZdAEbLNSOqS_or1EPRGw

Service - awful
Food taste - good
Food presentation - good 
Overall experience - bad
I won't come back nor will I recommend the place. 
Want details? Here it is:
the lady who served us barely spoke english, did not care much or both. I know this because I told her several times not to put noodle in my soup because I am allergic to wheat. I didn't expect her to understand ""gluten sensitive"" but ""no noodle"" should be a no brainer. She still brought a stew full of noodle and I had to fish it out. We waited for a long time for them to bring the food so I did not send it back. As a result I spent a lot more time on the toilette a lot more often that night that I usually do or want to. 
The food was good taste wise I would give it 4.5 out of 5. But overall experience was pretty bad. I wish I spent my money elsewhere.",-Fd1jFXbrn1ezOfs2ShInQ,0,0,1,moPTNV3rCLvP48RMIczOaA

1082297,2013-05-25,0,3-Bm90nXNtwLFyDtlj9olQ,"I came to this restaurant a few days ago and I must say, the service was stunning. 

Right when I walked in the restaurant, I was seated in an air-conditioned area and was immediately served with water. 

And as the side dishes came out, I could not stop eating the fish cake side dish. All the side dishes were amazing and I couldn't wait to order a real meal.

When the waitress handed me the menu, I couldn't pick just one dish to eat but as I came with a friend, the waitress recommended the Shabu-Shabu. This dish was one of the best Shabu-Shabu's I had. It was even better than the one I had in Korea! Now that's delicious. 

With the leftovers from the Shabu-Shabu, the waitress came over and made a delicious pot of porridge. I even took some home and my mom said it was amazing too. 

All in all, this has got to be one of my favorite Korean restaurants with great service and friendly waitresses.",VqD16rUsieeHL4-JbnB_qw,0,0,5,y9IKo4LooiUGEw_VRFBw6Q

The beef and broth were rich and well seasoned as were the assortment of accouterments (kimchi, pickled green beans etc...)

I'll admit I didn't exactly know 90% of what I was eating, but it was all delicious and I thankfully love trying new food. 

The interior ambiance isn't anything to write home, but they know what they are doing in the kitchen and are very affordably priced.  

They also had no problem splitting our check on three credit cards.

The grilled mackerel was very good. If you've ever had Korean mackerel you know it has a strong ""fish smell,"" so don't be alarmed when you can smell it 5 minutes before it comes out.  ;)  It was well seasoned - not too heavy on the salt and was tender with just a touch of chewiness.

The kalbi was tender and flavorful. I wish there had been more though... The samgyalpsal was SUPER GOOD! It was tabletop grilled, of course.  

The banchan was limited as compared to some other Vegas Korean places, but it was ALL GOOD. I'd rather have 4-6 tasty banchan than 8-10 meh banchan any day of the week. And they were not shy about refiling any one of them.

The decor is a little ""outdated"" but pretty typical. Not that I care so much because I spent most of my time head down stuffing my face.",vAfXu_O7g7xR-8SjGDXU1g,0,0,4,m_2siAMrIuOx_m2s4Abs4Q

3596473,2013-12-04,0,3-Bm90nXNtwLFyDtlj9olQ,"Went last night. Was a little hard to find because the area is a little sketchy looking and a few more Korean places were around than I expected. I don't eat meat and my dining partner does. The staff was very accommodating. Plus, they refilled every side dish when we asked seconds. 
It was my sister-in-law's first time at a Korean BBQ. The staff was very excited to explain all the dishes and helped us work our way through the menu. I had a large bowl of seafood soup with Kimchi. It was spicy and very tasty with a raw egg on top. I had no problem mixing it in..
The waitress cooked the meat for my sister-in-law. She ate the grilled meat with spring onions, broth and very thin glass noodles. Everything steaming hot and she said the broth was soothing. It was more than enough for one. We were also served a small bowl of rice. Love the rice.
We both walked out with only spending $30.00. Cheap eats. There may be more Korean restaurants in the area that may be better. But, give this one a try. It has a mom & pop feel - Warm.
Plus, it was not busy so we did not smell ""foodie"" when we left.

Cleanliness, location, outside surroundings ambience etc almost wants me to knock it down to a 1.
Originally we were headed to Lotus of Siam but they were closed. We tried the neighboring Korean restaurant and it was closed too. This rundown strip mall is riddled with Korean restaurants and this one happened to be the only one open on a Sunday afternoon. I honestly would never come to this type of strip mall under any circumstances but the lure of yelps promise was hard to resist. The parking lot was barren! Tumble weeds and a gang of pigeons hiding underneath a broke down van. I had to open up my yelp app just to make sure those 4 stars came from recent reviews. We walked in and it was like walking into one of those salons in a ghost town. Outdated, barren, empty, tables that have not been bussed and posters of food as the only decor. The two ladies that waited on us was very friendly and accommodating and is one of the biggest reasons I would like to give them more stars. We looked over the menu, the usuals I wanted was not there and there was no dish I could get for $10 which I thought would be pretty high for the way the establishment looked. I wanted to walk out but we were the only ones there and the girl was really nice. We ended up ordering an assortment of meats that we grill ourselves, good for two, comes with rice, drinks and the usual array of pickled sides $35.95. The grill and vent was clean. When she brought the plate of meat I was truly disturbed with the raw chicken and it's juices on the same plate as the thinly sliced steak. So if you go ask for your chicken on a separate plate. She helped us grill it and the flavors were different not as sweet as the other Korean restaurants I patron but still it was good and different in an interesting way. We were stuffed and she was still bringing us meat this is the most meat I have ever gotten at any Korean restaurant. Everything I needed more of they brought over promptly, without extra charge and without and attitude. This is a big deal for me because in other Korean restaurants they usually don't follow up on you, they have reservations about giving you extra of their sides and one I actually got into an argument for a to go box. These ladies checked on us frequently and brought us everything we needed another reason I wish I could give them a better score. In the end our total was $38.95 which  I think was pretty damn good for all that food. I was certain despite all the negatives I would rate this place 3 stars but midway through this review we both experienced an onslaught of mild stomach agitation and when my boyfriend came out of the restroom his first words were drop it to two stars so yea.",7eXW0KClU3J1ehd-QHO3Sg,1,0,2,PIIsJZInttwP8DG1HHS8vg
