27146,2017-04-29,0,6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA,"Absolutely terrible. No NOT order from this place. I was going to call it a restaurant, but restaurants actually cook food properly and know how to show they appreciate their customers. No, this place is awful. 
First of all, our food arrived looking like someone dropped a bowling ball on it. The containers were crushed. The chicken dinner we ordered was all legs and far too overcooked that it did not get eaten. We also ordered a 12 piece order of wings with medium sauce which came absolutely naked and flavorless. 
I called their shop to tell them how bad the order arrived and the ""owner"" who picked up kept claiming our order was right. I explained to him several times, while receiving a lot of attitude from him, what was wrong and he did not seem to even understand. Eventually he handed the phone off to someone else, while he talked loudly about me cursing in the background. I explain to the second person and eventually I'm told they will be doing nothing about this. 

I just wasted nearly $40 on food that was not eaten. Let this failure of a ""restaurant"" go out of business like it surely will. Do not order.",CS76Jp5WXssR_wexW2qt2A,0,0,1,Ydfz4AB8-lIexSv52K8n7g

However the service is beginning to be sub par. Once when we ordered for delivery we ordered a pepperoni and ham pizza. Only to receive a pineapple and ham pizza. We called back and the owner said he would send out the correct pizza. The night ended and no pizza the following day we had to call back to have the correct pizza brought to us. Again on Saturday we ordered the same pizza this time for pick up and we had the same issue. I had to wait 20 minutes while the correct pizza was made. The owner gave me a free cheesecake to make up for it. However there's a limit to what giving someone something will do. Yesterday was just the final straw I called at 8 to place an order for delivery the owner answered the phone as he usually does, took my number and said he would call back in 10 minutes. 20 minutes went by with no call back and I just went with Pizza Hut instead. 

Moral of the story, the food is great but no matter how good the food is if the service isn't adequate, you're better off finding a different place.

All ingredients were spread evenly making whole slice taste as good as the tip.
The back ribs were something incredible. Soft, hearty, and juicy. Lots of meat. Those are great quality ribs.
Fries were crispy and perfect for my taste.

1476054,2014-02-09,0,6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA,"BF ordered delivery lunch from here earlier today- got a flier on our door earlier in the month and didn't want to cook or go out in public today.

Called in for the 12 piece medium wings with fries ($10) and the mushroom cheese steak ($7). Delivery seemed to take quite some time, but I didn't set a clock or anything.

Pricing was good, and delivery was brought to us by a Russian lady- kind of surprising, I'm so used to seeing guys doing delivery. 

Opened up our order and dug in.
Had mixed feelings about the wings: they were ordered medium and were crisp, but they were almost completely dry and while they had a good flavor to them, they didn't have sauce and were not spicy. They seemed to have forgotten to actually put sauce on the wings. Very odd.
The fries are steak-cut and dusted with seasoning, very tasty. All served with two cups of a dipping sauce- flavorful and delicious with an unexpectedly strong dill taste? Not sure if it was supposed to be a house-made ranch or what but it was good. Devoured it all.

The cheese steak was legit though- huge split roll piled with melted cheese and tons of mushrooms. Would order this again, and I'm not typically a cheese steak kind of girl. Great value for the cost.

Not sure if we'll order here again necessarily- if I'm  craving mushrooms the cheese steak might hit the spot, and I'm curious about their pizza, but the wings were disappointing.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,1,3,Dny6Qo98coPq-SlzB3hhrQ

spot unless you are looking for it. They're in the shopping center right behind the Jack in the Box (all the way at the end).  We got the Philly Steaks with fries and some side orders to get a feel for the place. The side orders were tasty. The philly steaks could use a little bit more seasoning, I personally like some Tony's (creole seasoning) sprinkled in. Otherwise they were great. Good bread - a little crispy with good chew to it and holds in all juicy from the steak. The thin slices of meat were great. They use provolone cheese (if you get it with cheese) and melt it in. The steak fries were pretty good and a very large portion for an extra $1.25.

They have a large menu and you can call ahead, walk in or even delivery. It has a small dinning area if you wish to eat there. It looked clean and you can see into the kitchen.

Tonight we ordered a Large Pizza, it was the best Pizza we ever had! I am soooo serious. You won't be sorry if you order from them. The owner needs to give classes to all of the other Pizza places in Vegas and show them how to make a good pizza.  The crust was just delicous! Not too thin and not too thick just right! Not like some of the other pizza houses, they give you a beautiful side salad with nice fresh veggies and tasty garlic bread with your pasta. I am so glad we happened to see them when we were driving on S. Torrey Pines. It's sort of hidden behind the Jack in the Box on Torrey Pines and Charleston. The owner told my husband Eric he came to town from the Boston, MA area but also worked in New York so he has combined the best of the two and has come up with Perfection! I really wish they would go on facebook I looked and didn't see that they had a Facebook page. :( I am from Connecticut and have been in Vegas for 4 years. I find it is so hard to find a Restaurant that's food is consistently done right. So far so good. Thumbs up to the owner and cooks at NY Pizza located at 1000 S Torrey Pines. Just a heads up, their phone number is 822-2555. We had a hard time finding their number before we picked up a dozen menus. LOL!

1 star is too much for this place!  I'm a local business and I ordered some pizza from these guys since someone came to drop a flyer. Well I have to say the best thing of the whole experience was the deliver guy old man. 
I ordered one 12"" pizza with one topping pepperoni. First things first the flyer days $9.95 for a 16"" and when I called the guy said no that's for pick up only. Well no where on the flyer it says that so then he told me the price. Anyways I decided I'll order smaller since it would be cheaper. The 12"" cost me $ 16 freaken dollars. WOW and when the delivery guy came it was not even pepperoni it was cheese. So here I go again back to the pizza place wait another 40-50 minutes and I asked the guy well what can you do for me since I have to wait again for another pizza to be delivered. He said there's nothing I can do and I said well that's not right. Should of done it right the first time. I paid 16$ for some little 12 inch pizza when I could of ordered 3 huge 16inch pizza from little caesers or whatever. The guy said ok I'll figure something out. The second pizza finally arrived after 1.5 hours or so and finally it's pepperoni and nothing on the side no compensation just what I ordered so basically they did nothing since they messed up. Just tasted the pizza it tastes word then little caesers does and horrible service. DONOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone supper over priced and horrible service. I felt bad for the delivery guy because he is pretty old and he was driving around in 105 degree weather.

When we arrived they were just finishing up on our order we met the owner and what I think is either his wife or his girlfriend. They were a very sweet and personable couple. And offered us great service. We decided on a Hawaiian pizza, New York style pizza, and a cheese pizza. We added half a bucket of wings, tiramisu, baklava and New York style cheesecake. After a pleasant experience at the restaurant we went home and could barely contain ourselves due to the aromas floating throughout the car. The food lived up to the smell it was amazing the pizza crust was absolutely perfect and the wings are the best wings I've had since I came to Vegas two years ago. We ordered medium and we will probably go for hot next time but they were cooked to perfection.

5354835,2016-10-25,0,6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA,"One star is definitely over-rewarding to this place. I have had the misfortune of ordering here 3 times, and each time as horrible as it is, I think oh its a crowded time, or oh maybe its just a bad cook night, or oh, maybe I just expected too much. The last one is right, I expected standards. Each time I order something, a part of my order is missing. This time a member of my party wanted grilled onions on their sandwich, about the easiest thing humanly possible to do for a restaurant.... sandwich comes, no onions, I open a side, there are onion rings thrown in there..... I don't know if someone thought it was a joke or they are truly just that stupid of individuals..... Tried to call in and ask what happened I was put on hold, and then hung up on. NEVER AGAIN!!!",3a8JVsABTdbJ8pLVX-Dcsw,0,0,1,inb5o_7qata409h1nw3dIA

Fortunately I found this location which is right down the street from my job. The owner was very hospitable in the Stromboli was even better. I finally found the taste I've been looking for!,Of7ypsWHGnoOE9MuJQZlcw,1,0,5,tM5p3GEG5tfMVdtbC3OyvA

5885643,2018-07-01,0,6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA,Well where do I start.... I like pizza here but it takes them about three times to get your order actually right. They literally sent me the wrong order THREE TIMES. So if you order here I'd suggest ordering it for pick up so you can make sure you actually get your food.,ZJuP08cFDZoNLo1IlmreTA,0,0,1,oAfpnVHIkgChDavYTym7SQ
5944929,2014-04-18,0,6bVEM9jD-mpU4WNXcJ9tHA,"First off I have been on a pizza craze lately this one hit the spot and knocked it out of the park. 

After owning a pizza restaurant I can tell its fresh dough witch is nice had great flavor and texture air pockets in the crust when you bite into it the way its suppose to be. Good pizza sauce really great toppings. 

I have Philly cheese steak pizza and let me first off say its a light pizza again referring to ability to eat pizza how many slices etc.. Also they add toppings. I thought I got extra toppings on it but no I like that it makes it feel like your getting more bang for the buck. I saw the box's too that they advertise for wsop witch you know its going to be a great pizza to get a sponsor like that ! 

Also ordered chicken wings.. wow good flavor not raw or pink on inside almost kinda tasted Asian like, my only gripe was that some how bye the time I got home the sauce fell off the wings and lost its coating, witch would of been amazing if it could of stayed on lol. 


They have a HUGE ! extensive menu like 3 -4 pages covers everything from ribs to wins and dessert with 2 slices starting at $4.50 14' pie ( pizza's ) $7.95 and large 16' pies starting at $9.95 they about 10 different kinds of hamburger combinations,10 different kinds of subs, grinders and also gyros they run lunch specials at $6.50 also offer up delivery 

Honestly alot better then California Pizza Kitchen. There pizza dough is amazing !

will be back !",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,5,3,5,QVip4clzX8rVa1Eiuundzg
