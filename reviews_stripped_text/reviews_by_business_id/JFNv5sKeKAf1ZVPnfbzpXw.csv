This mom and pop pizzeria has the best food hands down & very genuine customer service.   We can't get enough of the Fettuccine Carbonara &ovb i don't need to say anything about the pizza. ... it's why we go. 
 & Don't let the name deceive you... It is a pizzeria but their Mediterranean dishes are so yummy; they have homemade dolma and baklava. It's ridiculous ;) Oh & there's this dessert, also homemade from scratch, its served cold. .. not sure what is called but you must ask for it.

The only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because they took a favorite menu item of mines off - garlic fries and also I wish the garlic balls had more of a garlic taste.,Bet1qVniQY7FX8UFuUCVMw,1,0,4,3u290JbJTsk8wkcwL1_xrw
48472,2017-04-18,0,JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw,"Ordered from here one time. The pizza was above average. The service over the phone and with the delivery man was great. Easy to communicate, they weren't in a rush to get me off the phone, and they didn't seem annoyed with my questions about what they offer. 

It was relatively similar in price to most pizza shops (other than Little Caesars) for what we ordered. We got two 14"" Pizza's with two toppings each, garlic balls and a 2 liter for just under $30 after delivery charge. I did find out you can order online and get 10% off through their website. 

The pizza itself was pretty good. They both had a good amount of toppings. Cooked well. The garlic balls however weren't that great. Kind of dry, could have used more butter or less time in the oven. I will try the fries instead next time. 

Overall, for the value, this place is a good option. Especially if you are looking for good service and the confidence someone is caring for your requests.",MjoqIL3lTigoJA_FM2dMmg,1,0,4,H-x1e1IeL4lmbMO3X3CANA

Then one guy says Ohh I forgot to tell you about this order . They stare at each other . I said so my order has not been started and they said yes. Well I have no idea what the heck they were doing no one was in the place - no sorry nothing just a dead blank stare .

420416,2013-02-03,1,JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw,"Mistakes made on GLUTEN FREE meal! 
We drove from Sunrise Mountain all the way across town because I had heard this restaurant offers not only gf pizza, but appetizers, entrees, soups, bread, and desserts as well. 
I ordered the eggplant parmesan with zitis, but the server questioned the bread that was on my plate before she even served it to me, She checked; sure enough it was NOT gluten free. I decided I didn't trust the kitchen staff any more, so I asked her to verify that my pasta was gf, and it sure enough it was NOT gf either. 
By this time an agitated man came out and was sorry, but tried to explain that another person recently ordered gf eggplant parmesan, with regular pasta, and I quote...""So I assumed it was only the eggplant that should be gluten free."" No. They should always assume otherwise, in my opinion. 
He really wanted to cook me another plate, but I explained that I was upset and didn't want it any longer.  He apologized. 
Now, I WILL say that my server, (a gal with short dark hair) was a ROCK STAR. Not only was she a great server in general, she caught the mistake of the bread, and I don't blame her for the pasta because she didn't cook the meal and she isn't a mind reader. She saved me by catching their mistake. My husband left a large gratuity. 
She also gifted me three gf brownies, and I know she felt very bad about the whole mistake. She got the scope of it. 
There was no charge for the meal even though my husband had eaten his soup and entree and we ate the salad, which was not the house salad. 
I won't go back, and I feel it is my duty to inform people of my experience, since many of us have Celiac Disease.
It was a serious mistake, and my personal opinion is that if restaurants make the conscious choice to serve the gf public, that they NEED to be on top of it. I realize it was an accident, but it was ME, so it is not okay with me. I was devastated because I was looking forward to eating something different for a change.

The problem I have with this place was his attitude- it was poor. The bigger problem I have is how he treated the nice Spanish guy who was trying to help him from the kitchen. The way he snapped at him in front of me was embarrassing and extremely rude- almost dehumanizing.

1225224,2011-06-13,0,JFNv5sKeKAf1ZVPnfbzpXw,"The star rating of ""meh.  I've experienced better,"" is exactly my thoughts.  We called to order delivery for lunch, a sandwich, a pasta dish and garlic bread and told it was going to be an hour.  It arrived a little over an hour later.  The wait time wasn't their fault since they did give the warning it would be that long.  The food however arrived cold and with pasta that ends up making it a bit rubbery.  The garlic bread was hard, dry and lacked much taste.  I can't speak for the sandwich because I was so unimpressed with everything else I chose not to try it.  

This place just fell short.  I cannot honestly say it was bad food, it really was just ""meh.""

P.S. Having been born and raised in Chicago, seeing the words ""Chicago Up-side Down Pizza"" on a menu is an automatic turn-off.  Don't put ""Chicago"" in front of something completely unauthentically Chicago.  Deep-dish pizza would never be called ""up-side down"" in Chicago.  I have not tried it, so I cannot speak to the quality or taste of the pizza, just an opinion.  :)

Update 9/12/12:  I am totally increasing the stars on this location not only for their food, including their Italian Ice but for their friendliness and concern regarding the Gluten Free community.  Prior to finding out East West Pizza carried Gluten Free pizza crust I frequented a Chicago place  called Amore... Until last night!!!  I have a disease that limits what I can eat to Gluten-Free products only and up until last night I felt any restaurant who carried GF items was ok in my book because it meant they were at least taking us into consideration.  I was completely wrong and at the hands of one of my previous favorite restaurants experienced the worst kind of discrimination and was YELLED at for inconveniencing the owner who said, ""I only ordered this stuff to please YOU PEOPLE, I don't make a dime off of this.  What am I supposed to do, check every order that comes out of the kitchen?""  No, but you are supposed to educate your staff if you are going to take on the responsibility of catering to an entire community of people who become extremely ill when they encounter any sort of wheat flour!  I have been ordering from East West more and more lately anyway due to the fact their product is WAY better, but their customer service alone over what I experienced last night needs to be commended!  Thank you for taking ""Us People"" into consideration!  Keep up the good work!",RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ,2,0,5,hVbQAZxk5dVd54X8s0yFNg

They also have a bunch of typical Italian restaurant appetizers and desserts to choose from.  No complaints about the pizza, every time I get it, it is great.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, is this.  They sell pizza by the slice, which I am a huge fan of.  Why stop at a nasty fast-food place when I can get a slice or two of great pizza, right?  The problem is that 4/5 times I go, there are never slices available.  And it isn't that they are that busy, there are none ready.  Wait 10-15 minutes for some to be ready?.. no thanks, it kinda defeats the purpose.

Next time I think we should get an Italian sausage pizza because it left me craving for more!! This was excellent service but it's not as good as our favorite place.

Our meal here was mediocre. We were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while I stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza.

I wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago I received a spam email from East West -- I must have filled out some comment card or something so, I emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. They replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. 

For the next several months, despite this guarantee, I continued to receive spam in my email from East West. I emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. Tonight I emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.

East West Pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that I never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,3,1,1,4jF3yHTNrpZbgE-oTV7XJA

WRONG!
And let me tell you this, I don't got a lot of junk in my trunk for no reason.
I eat all the delicious food that my heart and stomach desire.

And I didn't just try one thing here, the S.O. and I were ravenous and ordered something from almost every section on the menu.
 I will list them:

SALAD- Caprese Salad, absolutely incredible.
With every bite I took, I want to chew endlessly just to savor it all within my mouth.
I'm glad when I offered a bite he said no, because I was really just being polite.
There was no way I wanted to share that bad boy.
I want more right now.
I could eat the Caprese Salad all day.

SUBS- Chicken Parmigiana Sub, again, crafted to perfection.
And I was worried that it would show up to the door all soggy and I would regret having ordered it.
That Chicken Parm Sub showed me!
This one, we did split in half.
I was okay with splitting, but if it came down to it again, I would want my own.

PASTA- Haruto Special Pasta, just about one of the most delicious things I've eaten here in Las Vegas.
This was the first item we decided on ordering.
It was a complete no-brainer, just check out the description:
The classic fettucine, Alfredo piled with chicken, sausage, jumbo shrimp, domestic mushrooms, bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes and jalapenos.
Such a complexity of flavors.
After annihilating that salad and 1/2 of the Chicken Parm Sub, it was pretty clear we weren't going to finish the pasta.
And that was okay because leftover Haruto Special Pasta heated up on the stove, is just as delicious as when it's delivered right to your door!!!

Finally, PIZZA- 1/2 Supreme, 1/2 California Vacation Pizza, and even though I could only fit maybe two squares of pizza down my gullet, I knew we made the right decision ordering the pizza.
And I know what you're thinking- how the eff did they eat all that food?
I don't know.
I don't even know why we ordered so much.
The good news is, everything was fantastic.
The bad news is everything was fantastic so how am I going to cut down the next time I order?
I don't have money to be ordering hella food like that all the time.
Or more than the time that we already did.

And as for the pizza, avacado on pizza?!?!
They just put two of my favorite things together.

Dammit.
Now I'm really hungry.",fgwj7jFv8JNaATGM_lURUQ,3,1,5,HqyI4lYfLg2ZPo7HvrIgGw

We gave this place a shot because the had a ""school night"" were they were donating a portion of their sales to the local school. And while I appreciate their effort to donate to the school, it was because of this that many families with kids that go to that school gave them lots of business on this night(including our family). This was a chance for this place to really show the neighborhood what they can do. But unfortunatly, the food was terrible. Of course our family couldn't try everything, but what we did have was so unenjoyable. For pizza, we ordered a ""California pizza"". It is advertised as pizza with fresh tomato's and avacado. What we got was a pizza with no sauce(thats fine), but very little tomato and avacado. 80% of the pizza was just plain pizza dough. And the little bit of tomato/avacado that was there had no flavor at all. And this pizza was $16.00 for a pizza that was very small. My 8 year old herself was trying salt/pepper/parmesan, anything to give it some kind of flavor. We also had one of their salads and while the dressing was OK, the lettuce tasted like it had been in the fridge way too long.(and this salad was $9.00. With drinks, I spent $40.00 bucks. And when we got home, my daughter was looking for something to eat because she ate so little of the pizza that she was still hungry. Again, I appreciate that the place was donating to the school, but there are lots of ways for me to give to the school(as I do all year long).

My real problem was the bread and the meat....The roll was hard enough to be a weapon! I could only eat some of it. The meat was super dry, thank God for the mushrooms, peppers and onions! I definitely would not recommend ordering this unless you want to chip a tooth or need protection. I will say that the fries were okay. The delivery driver was very pleasant.",0GU9JFK9fASruSxxkHjGgQ,3,1,3,0IfmvXemNQjnUQS0lo3mKA

The pizza is thin crust east coast style, its similar but not the same. 

The crust: was thin, held the toppings without falling apart with a nice chew to it. It also had a wierd salty after tatse that was not that great. 

Toppings: It was average, my pie was not uniform so some spots had more than others. 

Sauce: nothing special, it was missing the extra kick that makes me want to come back for me. 

I love supporting local businesses but I don't think I would come again with other great choices so close in the area. 

Had the garlic knots too, courtesy of a yelp promo but they were a little to dense for me. Good Knows are light, with new style dough its more dense so not the best choice for knots.

Note: there were no menus on the counter or on the wall, how do people know what to order if there is nothing to look at.",C7xugvjzMhmPkADOEGkQdw,2,0,3,qOJSRDnZl0B6yoeEk-BdEA

BUT the selection is wide and the quality is amazing. So far I've had the Hawaiian style, Pepporoni and Eggplant with Feta- OMG amazing! The slices are GI-NORMOUS, a little floppy but not to the point of all the dressings sliding off the slice cuz that really sucks.

I wish I could say that the sauce has amazing flavor but it's mediocre- I think the toppings and combination of meats makes it the best. The service is always fast and friendly and most importantly WARM on arrival. 

Truly love this place and pray it never goes away ;)",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,1,0,5,_trByIAOGFUm9FwXCKQl8g

Well it was not cook completely and when you tried to pick it up it was like mush. I called and the cook was just rude and argued with me that he knows the pizza was cook correctly, but it was soggy cause I ordered it with mushrooms.  (He told me the mushrooms released water, like I have never had a mushroom pizza before.  Well he was correct I never had a crappy pizza like that one before).  I drove the entire pizza to their shop and he still wanted to argue with me but thank god the driver told that it was obviously not cooked and to refund my money.  Don't know if the driver was a manager but nice guy.  He left and the cook again started on me about how it was my fault now that the pizza was soggy.  I lived to far away now according to him.  It took like 15 to 20 minutes for him to process the refund on my credit card.  Never will try this place again.  Buyer beware",Ahdo2T-uQ-qO-6FM88M4mg,1,0,1,iYHkUFs6nEJF_l2cmK_vAw

She put me on hold and then picked up six or seven times to talk to me, but then kept placing me on hold.  I was told my pizza would take 20-25 mins. I got to East West Pizza 25 minutes after placing my order and was told that it would take another 30 minutes from the time I paid for it. From the time I placed my order to the time I walked out of the restaurant it was over an hour. I thought this pizza better be great considering how long I waited for it and how much I paid for it (it was $18 for a large with two toppings). I took it home and ate it and threw more then half of it away. It was not good at all! Their toppings are very bland. There is nothing special about this pizza at all. It is obviously from all frozen products. They brag about their cheese on the top of the box and it is tasteless and disgusting! I would never go back!! If I could give them negative stars I would. Do not go to East West Pizza. Go to Grimaldis or something. It is not worth the $18 I paid or the hour I waited!!!",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,0,0,1,RhUdWSVeiqoNxerFAn2nTg

We just ordered tonight .. I always always order ALL DRUMS for my chicken wings . There were other things I was calling about after our order arrived but the first thing I mentioned was "" I ordered all drums and they weren't."" .. the girl (who has always been very sweet on the phone , told me she knew for a FACT they were all drums because she made them herself . I offered to sends pic or bring them back to her , which she said she didn't want.  
PET PEEVE : please don't Argue with me especially when I'm staring right at my box that isn't ALL DRUMS. The owner , John, is a great guy and corrected the situation , but I do feel a bit upset that I was told she knew for a fact:/ .. took a pic because I would like them to know I have no reason to be dishonest .

Most of the fries were dried out and hard, like croutons more than fries. Worst of all: the chocolate cake we ordered was a joke. It was so stale it literally broke apart while I was filming a video to post on Yelp. Awful. It's got to be a week old at least.",ozPXLw6rdip1jgS9Co5c4A,2,0,2,kcAsvH03MlCqg8nKsxvFEg

The new owner sat down with us and planned out the catering and it was all very good, even after being delivered to Mandalay Bay. My only complaint is that when my friend who was handling a lot of the day of affairs called to pay, the woman he talked to wouldn't let him pay because it wasn't his name on the catering order. I had already informed them several weeks in advance that that day they would be dealing with him, not me. I think he eventually got the owner on the phone and everything was fine, but whoever he initially dealt with that day caused some unnecessary stress. 

In the end it was all good and we had more pizza, pasta and salad than we even needed for about 60 people for a couple hundred dollars.

Service was fast and friendly. While we were there, a delivery customer came in to complain about her order from a few days prior and the staff handled her in a friendly and upfront manner and she seemed to leave feeling appeased. 

Our food was ok. The pizza wasn't anything remarkable, but it was tasty. The wings had good flavor of Frank's Red Hot sauce. The chicken was plump and meaty. The only negative was that a few of the wings were a little undercooked and we avoided eating the ones that were a little pink in the center.
