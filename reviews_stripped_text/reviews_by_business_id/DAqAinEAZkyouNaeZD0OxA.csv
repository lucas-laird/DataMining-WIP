Are they being properly maintained???  While my grandchildren were in the play room there was a kid on the Whacker machine and the head of the hammer came off and struck my wife in the head.  The manager did not seem too concerned and my daughter made the young lady write up an incident report over what had happened.  If my wife had not been standing where she was it would have been me or my TWO YEAR OLD granddaughter whom I was helping to play a game that would have been struck.  Now today my wife has been dizzy with terrible headaches all day long.  Just be careful if you take your children there to play.",OYPTqe2OiivMnoJmH3Mn0Q,0,0,1,koM2lQcmKeux3TiSJhfCdA

The restaurant was very clean. So was the restroom. 

Pizza was hot, fresh and tasty. Caesar salad was very good with a creamy dressing and FRESH croutons. The rotini pasta with spinach, mushrooms with an alfredo sauce was superb! And i don't like alfredo!

1372723,2017-11-22,0,DAqAinEAZkyouNaeZD0OxA,"Having spent some of my childhood in Texas, Peter Piper Pizza was one of my family's go to places on Sundays and I have nothing but great memories from this chain even when I go back to Texas to visit I stop by and grab a pizza. 

I was beyond excited when I found out they had opened up not one but two Peter Piper Pizzas in Vegas, so I took advantage that my nephew and niece came into town and took them to the Eastern location so share some of my childhood memories but unfortunately this location failed short of that. 

The pizza was good and just as I remembered but the downside was that the ""arcade/play area"" was really small with just a handful of arcade games. A few of the games where out of order which made the selection even less, my nephew got bored after a few minutes. We had to use up the tokens and just played every game until we ran out. Overall a bit disappointed that this location has such a small play area compared to other pizza places nearby.

Large space to host a party/fundraisers but not well maintained. My family had to switch to three different tables because the first two were I wiped and had crumbs/sauce stains. 

They had a large selection of soda choices (coke products) as well as multiple beers on tap. Parm cheese, chili peppers, Sriracha sauces readily available on their counter along with a fully stocked utensil bin. 

As for entertainment, there are multiple TVs on their wall (half playing sports and the other half cartoons). The staff  hosts games like musical chairs for the kinds every so often and gives them coins as prices. 

As for the food, it's pretty ordinary. I ordered the Chicago style pizza ... while I'm not sure what Chicago pizza is like, the pizza we ate tasted like something I could have gotten from that $5 ready pizza place except I paid $15 for it. Not recommended. It was bland and I probably could have made one better. 

It's really disappointing that this place isn't as good as I hoped it would be. Huge place and pretty blah. You're better off going to Cicis. At least there you can have buffet style for more choices.",OS-XAEbboJ_CiPFBU8yKVw,2,0,2,0DRiqQfw47bwI2vlX-cW4A

3102394,2017-07-27,0,DAqAinEAZkyouNaeZD0OxA,"This was my first time at any Peter Piper. I grew up on the East Coast where the Mouse and his Cheese reign ! Peter Piper is adult friendly which is great. I'll have no problem getting my teen to come along for an outing at Peter Piper.

Environment

The building is located in the front of  a shopping center with plenty of parking. Once inside the decor is very bright and welcoming.  The menus are easy to navigate and explain all the pricing and different packages. They also offer a lunch buffet.

There was plenty of seating.  Throughout two seating areas were tables as well as booths. It's great for dinning alone or meeting up with friends. TVs were up throughout the establishment and featured kid friendly cartoons and sports. They also have free Wi-Fi.

Food

The pizza was similar to hot and ready pizza places. It was good for the price though. The wings were delicious  they were seasoned well and not to crunchy or wet.

Arcade

The arcade was clean and had about 20 games to play. I personally think it caters to kids between 5 and 10 years of age . Older kids may get bored quickly. Toddlers won't have much to do. Most of the games require at least two tokens.  The games take tokens and give out tickets which can be redeemed for prizes. 

Customer Service

The staff was AMAZING ! They are very professional and friendly. They were patient and kind with the littles. My kids felt comfortable and really enjoys themselves. We were there for the Summer Craft activities ( which will start again June 2018). For $5 a kid they received 2 slices if pizza a drink, a guided craft and  go with a Pinata. Bree hosted the activities, and she did a great job of including all the kids and making sure they all were happy. She kept everything organized and all the activities moved seamlessly !

All in all we had a great time and will definitely bring our family back for future visits. The food is about average but the overall experience was great !",RuID0Cs3Q3FLkkKVfPzHFw,1,1,4,ARoitgEggzE_qSsuR9o4SQ

Location is fine, lots of parking and near by stores.
A very important reason why I am not giving them 4 stars is because their game selection sucks!
This place is so big, and only 1/4 of it is games. They literally have about 20 games in total.
For food we had 2 pizzas, a few order of wings and pasta.
Pizza saved them because it was really good. I could truly say I enjoyed it.
Wings were okay, beyond soggy for my taste.
Pasta was okay too.
Over all this place is alright. I wouldn't come here again unless for some odd reason I am craving their pizza.

Is the service good? Absolutely. Not.

The manager who rung me up couldn't be more surly. She did not acknowledge me; she merely waved her finger to summon me to the counter. She was very snappy with her speech and was dismissive of any questions that I had. All she wanted to do was take my money and move me on. I did notice she greeted my wife better, and neither of us were acting rude towards the staff. HER manager was notified and they, of course, did nothing. As a result, I will find other, better, restaurants to visit in the future.

The pizza was ok,not spectacular but definitely edible and a decent selection of different types..The bread sticks were very good.The pastas were not bad and the salad was adequate.I did enjoy it overall and would be open to returning here but most likely if I had a coupon deal again.I can't really find anything to fault it for but it's not exactly my cup of tea.Readers of my other reviews will know that I am a big fan of regular or Asian buffets and this type of buffet would be alright for a once in a while change of pace buffet but not something that I would tend to do on a regular basis.If you like this type of food,you probably won't be disappointed.Try it and see what you think of it.Enjoy.(beverage is extra cost).",8BGl261AJRO7pJNiQJ8Tsw,2,0,4,1YxjOcqCR4DSM7vdyKPRWw

The pizza was nothing special, not bad but not outstanding.  Their highlight for me was the mac and cheese which was great, and the free refills on soda.  

I may someday give it another chance but hopefully there is a better pizza buffet out there.  Some places will make a point to advertise they'll make any pizza you want not currently on the buffet.  I think they'll make them for you here but I saw no signs advertising this.

4654975,2017-02-04,6,DAqAinEAZkyouNaeZD0OxA,"Peter Piper is Back in Las Vegas! 

   Let's face it once you leave Las Vegas it is so hard to stay away. This also goes for restaurants. After leaving Las Vegas a few years ago, Peter Piper is back! Peter Piper is so serious about staying in Vegas that they made their newest restaurant a premier restaurant. This is the second Las Vegas Peter Piper to open in a month. This Peter Piper is so new that I breathed in the scent of new paint and furnishings. It is so new that only a few days ago I was witnessing construction workers building the restaurant. 

   If you have never heard of Peter Piper, it is a pizza chain that has catered to young families. If it wasn't the same company as Chuck E. Cheese they would be competitors. The Peter Piper nursery rhythm below emphasis the Peter Piper connection to children:

""Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Where's the peck of pickled peppers that Peter Piper picked?""

  The freshly opened Peter Piper that I walked into today demphasizes a sole focus on children. The Peter Piper that I spent some time in today was missing a playground, tunnels, and robotic animals. However, it is a family friendly restaurant. Two of the three humongous rooms are children friendly. As Meatloaf sang ""Two out of three ain't bad."" When I explored the place I took in a large room with tables that can accommodate a large party. Adjacent to the room I stepped inside an arcade. The first sight I saw was a concession stand displaying the prizes. The arcade games were so new that I can breath the new electronic smell. 

  A couple paragraphs back, I said that Peter Piper's is no longer solely focusing on pizza. Today they are also focusing on their food. Their food includes many styles of pizza, bread sticks, wings, and a few pasta dishes. I would discover this food at the time their lunch buffet was ending. The friendly cashier let me know that I could take some pizza home with me before they cleared out the food at 2:15 pm. I wasn't too hungry and placed a moderate portion of pizza in the to go box that I ate off of in the massive room with plate glass windows overlooking Eastern Avenue, the party room, the buffet, and counter. Throughout this room I took in a handful of large screen TVs. 

  The lunch buffet which primarily was pizza slices, bread sticks, a dessert, and a couple Italian items cane out to $6.49. An additional bottomless Coke was $2 and change. Now if I didn't want a Coke, there was an option to order a beer from the tap. At 2 pm in the afternoon I wanted a Coke and with the lunch buffet it came out to less than $10. 

   To put it kindly, this wasn't no Metro Pizza. It was decent. I am confident that it wasn't frozen pizza thanks to their new restaurant design where from the arcade I can look into the open kitchen to see them making the pizza. Kudos to the open kitchen design. 

  In conclusion Peter Piper Pizza is a nice addition to the Las Vegas family friendly restaurant scene. Peter Piper, ""Welcome back to Las Vegas!""",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,10,3,YURgiRXvvNv1JzV1iIJ13g

She went to the machine and open up the coin door and looked at the coin Mechs and then drop to 2 tokens and played the game and told me the game was fine and paused for a few seconds, never did she apologize about the inconvenience or offered my tokens and automatically acted as if I was lying(come on I had over 100 tokens in my cups). That's when I got upset and asked for my money back and asked for a manager. The GM Brandon came out and I started to explain my situation to him and he told me she was doing her job.

Sadly, it was disappointing. Far from what I remembered as a child. Place had a huge dining area (YAY) but tiny game area (BOO). The game area was a third of the dining area. Games were far more expensive than CEC. On top of that most games had a stick saying, ""I'll be fixed soon!""  With a limited amount of games as it is, it's sad to have almost a quarter of the games down. On top of that, no rides. Now correct me if I'm wrong but Peter Piper Pizza was known for their rides. Selected but they had rides which added to the fun. 

Would I come back? Never, unless I am attending a party. 

It's honestly not worth it.",kgGYqH5_wCWr3EK1rxllGw,2,0,2,_KycOF3M5A6qbIDqiSgbRg

The facility is nice and clean. We at at the long tables which I think is more for birthday parties. Since there was only one other group in the entire restaurant I don't think they cared. I was a little amazed that the video games worked and was in nice condition. 

The food was good. I enjoyed the pizza. We ordered the regular crust and it had great flavor. We also ordered some mild wings and they also tasted great. I do have to say that the wings were very very small. I don't know if that means that their chickens had less steroids or what but at least they tasted good. The kids ate their pizza quick which is a good thing because they are picky eaters. So I'm guessing we will be back.",WXI5MtL-eBjpGIFQsUMaHw,2,1,4,BLNFtPuiG_UDTsj7Hhl4TA
5554698,2017-04-01,0,DAqAinEAZkyouNaeZD0OxA,Great place.  The only thing that concerned me is yesterday 3/31/2017 took my daughter to the restroom and your establishment had no hand soap.  Worried me because how do you guys wash your hands (employees).  Not only that but my 2 year old got diahria an hour after eating and is still with the runs today.  Just to be safe I'm not taking my family anymore.  Always check restroom before eating it tells how well maintained and sanitary the place is.,5zPSFRSPqlqG5Mceo7FC6g,2,0,2,kITmkVT3Lt7tasyk8vqMAQ
5805550,2018-06-30,0,DAqAinEAZkyouNaeZD0OxA,"Went there on a Monday afternoon to check it out, I remember going to peter piper pizza when I was younger when it had the mini train and tons of games to partake in. 

Sadly this place isn't the same as it used to be, you have a dining area, then a dining party area and then in the far back a little play area, probably max of 20 games. The games were ok, some of them jipped you on tickets, and some were worth far less than 2 tokens. Not to mention how slow the ticket counter is to redeem for prizes. The guy was friendly but he definitely wasn't motivated to move any faster than he needed to. 

The food was just ok as well. Tried the buffet which was ok, you had your vast variety of pizzas, salads and pastas. The pizzas weren't bad, the salad was ok until I found a few bugs, like tiny gnats that love produce items. I know cause I work with produce and do meal preps. I was grossed out and had to stop eating it...so clearly they don't wash their lettuce. Even if it comes in ready to make bags it should still rinsed out. The pasta was ok as well, tasted more like something that came out of a frozen food bag. 

Overall I wasn't impressed, but the pizza made up for everything else.",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,1,1,3,2gRbcTLV9Ez0p7nxc9WlOw

I played for about 1/2 an hour & went to check on our order and they informed me that it was JUST NOW going in the oven, I was a little perturbed but the lady was super nice and comped us all drinks. Back to the video games, the kids were happy & not sweating me so everything was cool. We run out of tokens & go back to check on our order only to find out the manager was comping the entire order and throwing in an extra pizza to boot. Wow. Could not believe how far they were willing to go to ensure that everyone has a great experience there. They really went above and beyond. The place was clean, the video games were in great shape, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Can't recommend this place enough, the Chicken Alfredo pizza is all that too. You really can't go wrong here, especially if you have kids.",-In3cQmzHxpKHhQBjae7aw,1,1,5,A1F13Sl8k-l2M5wWzMIWxw
