218417,2014-08-19,1,PYUyY5E1MPn_8m9WZeMDHA,"$5 steak and eggs 24/7? Hell yeah! 

I usually go to South Point for their steak and eggs special, but it is only after midnight and they recently changed it so that only those who are over 21 can get the special, which sucks! I came here with a group of 7, and they asked if anyone was over 21. We were confused since they did not have any signs or anything suggesting that anyone over 21 was needed. Luckily, we had two people over 21. She still asked for all of our IDs, which we thought was strange. She gave us a disapproving look and said that if we caused ANY trouble, she would call security and we would be kicked out. Umm....okay? Just because 5/7 of us were not 21 doesn't mean that we can't be well behaved. Whatever.

We all ordered steak and eggs, and one banana cream pie. They give you an option of toast or biscuits and gravy, so naturally, I went with the biscuits and gravy. SO YUMMY. No regrets. The steak was mediocre. They ask how you want it cooked, but all of them were served basically well done. They also give you eggs and hash browns, and they were great. They refilled our waters often and the servers were friendly, so no complaints there! 

Seriously, for $5 steak and eggs, you can't really complain much about the food. Took off one star for the rude hostess, but other than that, I would definitely recommend this place for a cheap, late night meal! Or any other time of the day, really. Seriously. 24/7 $5 steak and eggs. Really can't beat that.",_1v9g99OAWJJlQPOcYNuFw,1,1,4,xWgLvYLbpRgvhCb3uTilpQ

Anyways, the steak was full of nerves and fat but had good flavor. When they ask you if you want toast or biscuit in gravy, get the toast!! The biscuit in gravy is always cold and the gravy tastes like its out of a can.

Second visit was a to-go order that was taken by Robin.  Most of what swayed our decision to buy here was me raving about their homemade chicken noodle soup.  I had it on my first visit here and since my friend was feeling a bit under the weather, I told him that he should try some. 
She handed us the bag and drinks and we headed back to the room.  We noticed that the soup was missing when we started emptying the plastic bag.  I sent my buddy back to get his soup.  He said he talked to the same lady and she insisted that the soup was in the bag.  Ok, we made a $30+ order, and all I'm complaining about is missing soup.  In the end she insisted it was there, and did not give the soup to my buddy even though I sent him down with my receipt, ID and the cc I used.  
I called downstairs when he got back to my room and told them I'd like to return the entire order for a refund since I am unable to get my soup.  Megan answered the phone and said she couldn't authorize that, but she would have her manager call me back.  In the meantime, we sat there with food getting cold because we were waiting on the word for it being ok to return.  I was surprised that Megan actually did have Edward call me back on my room phone.  I asked if he would authorize a return of this now-cold food for a full refund.  He said we can walk back down again and get the soup.  I said that would have been nice the first time, but it was already denied to us.  Since my one friend was already feeling sick, he said to just leave it as is, but my other friend decided she was ok to walk down and pick up the soup, so I sent her.  I didn't feel like going and I felt like if I did I would be yelling at someone.
My friend comes back, and not only did Edward throw in an extra cup of soup, he sent up some dinner rolls as well.  When I was on the phone with him, he did offer dessert, but we declined since we had been to the buffet earlier and were still feeling the guilt.  It was nice that he sent dinner rolls up, though...went nicely with the soup and no visible boogers & c*m.

If you're looking for a cheap bite to eat then look no further, Sourdough Cafe has great prices and decent food. You can save a few cents if you obtain a players card. 

I always order the steak and eggs special which costs $4.49 with the players card, normal cost is $4.99, that's a whopping savings of $0.50 cents! Haha

Like I said, the food is decent, the steak isn't  thick, it's actually pretty thin but still delicious, seasoned right, juicy even when it's cooked well done. My eggs over medium are always cooked to perfection, hash browns are okay, they're a bit oily, the meal comes with your choice of toast (white, wheat, or sourdough) all buttered up. I strayed away from the steak and eggs once and ordered the pot roast, it was very dry so now I stick to what I know is good.

I remember my grandparents taking us here when we were younger. I knew they had a prime rib special, so we drove down here Saturday 1/2/16 for lunch.

Atmosphere- Very country-ish. They were playing country music, and country decor was scattered all over the walls in this place. 

Service- Our server, Pedro, served us, but that was about all he did. He was in a grumpy mood and it showed. We asked him what kind of soda they had, and he told us to ask the busboy, wtf. The bus boy ended up being a better server than he was! We wanted to leave a tip for him, but we couldn't find him so we asked the girls at the front if we could put the money in an envelope for him. We explained that he was much more helpful than Pedro, and they didn't seem surprised. Apparently they have this problem with him a lot. I don't understand why you would want your business to suffer because of one shitty server. 

Food- I ordered the men's cut (12oz) prime rib dinner. It came with salad, rolls, veggies and mashed potatoes. The prime rib was dry and nasty. It was very chewy too. The veggies that came with my meal were cold as well as the mashed potatoes. The rolls were warm though and the salad was decent. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak with eggs, hashbrowns and biscuits and gravy.  We also ordered chili cheese fries to share. We asked that the fries come well done, and of course when they arrived at the table they were not. We told Pedro  so he went back to the kitchen. He then came back and told us the chef said that the fries aren't crispy because the chili and cheese on top make them soggy, wtf! We asked for them to just bring the chili and cheese on the side.

$4.99 steak and eggs- you can't go wrong with this deal, it is a bargain. The eggs were good and so were the hash browns. The steak was fatty around the edges, so I just cut it off and then it was ok. 

Large restaurant, they can accommodate big parties.

The other day was the first time I tried the prime rib. It was a surprisingly a really good 12 oz. men's cut prime rib which came with a soup or salad and a side for like $14.  For some reason I thought it was just as good maybe even a little better than the prime rib I had from a steakhouse earlier and it wasn't because it was cheaper.  I don't know how to describe how a prime rib should be besides it looked and tasted good and blood wasn't running all over the place. I'd definitely order it again. Do yourself a favor, if you're craving prime rib get the men's cut, they had a prime rib and shrimp special for like $10 but the prime rib just wasn't the same. Ask my mom who got her prime rib and shrimp plate after a couple of men's cut prime rib plates were brought to the table. haha. 

Just like almost every Vegas casino cafe has a menu that highlights a cheap steak and eggs deal or various late night deals. Sourdough Cafe is no different. Here they offer a decent sized cheap steak, forgot how many ounces, a couple of eggs, and hash brown for under $5. I use to come here pretty often for steak and eggs back in the day back when it was cheaper, it's still pretty cheap.  It's not the best or cheapest in town but if you're craving it and you're in the area you might as well save some gas money.  

It's not a fancy place, it's kind of old, and a lot of the food is standard but I like it. 3.5 star.

I got some burger (the only one for the 3 course option) and it tasted like frozen patties from Walmart. They asked how I wanted it and said ""medium"" but these were so thin it's impossible to do so mine was well done. Disgusting. Didn't even have the texture of real meat. The fries were just your normal fries. The steak used to be an actual steak but looking at my parents plates it didn't even look like real steak. Just some floppy meat.

This is only for the RESTAURANT portion of the establishment....called the Sourdough Cafe.

Again, a ""local"" and a friend of hers found this place and took me there.

It's a little dumpy and not in a very inspiring area. What they lack in this department, they make up for in the food and VALUE. They had this incredible breakfast offer. It was an awesome breakfast that I had outside typical breakfast hours. We also split a strawberry shortcake. Unbelievable.

So much of Las Vegas's hinterlands are vapid, and transiting from my friend's place to Arizona Charlie's made me think, ""It better be good."" It was.

But after my last visit, I don't think I will be coming back. 

(deep breath). Ok. Soooo........I bring my party of 9 on a wednesday night at about 9:45. We wait a couple minutes for them to set up our table. We sit down and look at our menus for a couple minutes. About 10 minutes later, still no acknowledgement. So I get up and ask the hostess up front if anybody knows we are there. 

Finally somebody shows up asks us what we want to drink. We gave our drink orders and said we were ready to order. To my disgust, she was only the ""drink"" person. She says she will go get our drinks and that our server will be out soon. A couple minutes later we get our drinks. Still no server.

15 minutes later still no server so at this point, we all decided to get up and leave. Its sad because I told a friend of mine that we were gonna be there with our party of 9 while he was getting his party of 10 together to show up later. After our experience, I texted him not to come any more because he would probably have to wait forever to get any kind of service.

I don't know what happened to this place. Service used to be decent. Looks like it went to crap that night. I wonder if they made some cut backs because when we went that night, it wasnt that busy. Looks like im gonna have to take my friends and family elsewhere for decent food and service.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,5,3,1,GSHmj6YyNv4rxHSfMFMGgQ

Pros:
* If you are hungry and are low on funds, this is a good choice.
* Peach Ice Tea... Oh yeah!
* Alcohol available
* Even cheaper if you sign up for the Rewards Card

Cons:
*  Located inside AZ Charlies where the parking sucks
*  Everyone walks out smelling like smoke
*  Service here is bad bad bad!
* I ordered the Banana Creme Pie to go because they took so long to return to the table.  When I got home, I realized I was duped and given a Key Lime Pie instead.  How do you mess that up ?  How'd it taste?  Not a clue... I'm not a fan of Key Lime and left it in the fridge for a curious soul to discover.

Ordered: 
Rotisserie Chicken - A bit dry in the middle, but not too bad.
Mashed Potatoes -  How do you mess this up.. you can't & they didn't.
Green Beans -  Gotta have some veggies.  I wish I got broccoli though.
Banana Creme Pie - MIA
All this for under $10.00 w/ the rewards card!

Verdict:
  Okay, I was close extremely close to giving this place a 2 stars because the service was extremely slow ( and that's an understatement), but I after much contemplation, this is a place where you go when you want cheap eats.  I really shouldn't have expected to be treated like a king at this joint, but seriously lady, please refill my tea!  I'm choking on my chicken!!  When it came to paying the bill... I could have walked out and ran to meadows mall and back and my server would never have even known.  I'm giving this place a 3 star for the deal and the overall quality of the food.

Tips:
 *  sign up for the rewards card to really get the deal
 * DreadHeads wrap 'em up unless u want hair that smells like smoke.
 * ride your skateboard and you want have to F*ck with finding a parking",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,3,1,3,UP8z6-EpteDSVRhlUXBhZg

I got steak and eggs and my boyfriend got a hamburger, fries, and mozzarella sticks. We both got drinks with our meals and we still spent less than $20 bucks w/ tip! Now THAT'S a deal. My steak was pretty chewy, but the portion was a lot bigger than a lot of other graveyard steak and egg specials I've had and at $3.99, how could I complain? The mozzarella sticks tasted just like Sonic's mozzarella sticks; nice and gooey on the inside and crisp on the outside, served with marinara sauce. My boyfriend's burger looked very fresh. The tomatoes, lettuce, and pickle just screamed, ""Eat me I'm f*cking crispy!"" and, of course, he devoured it all.

* Eggs - scrambled, over easy, sunnyside up, etc.  I prefer over easy.
* Steak - Generous portion of steak.  Unsure what type of steak.  Maybe sirloin?  Medium-rare is my recommendation to you.
* Toast - wheat, white, muffin, biscuit & gravy.  I suggest you ask the butter to be on the side since it would be drenched otherwise.

As noted always a Best of Vegas breakfast contender. Not really that good but consistent and CHEAP. $2.99 Pancakes & Eggs, $3.99 Steak & Eggs, $2.99 Strawberry Shortcakes!

BEST spot to eat after drinking, YES! Fast,Cheap & Filling.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with scrambled eggs,hashbrowns and wheat toast.

The wife had the NY steak and scrambled eggs with hashbrowns and a biscuit w/gravy(instead of toast)

Mine was real iffy, too fried-gravy was too thick & lumpy, hasbrowns were good,eggs were a little runny, toast was soaked in butter.

Steak is a little fatty-NOT real New York Strip steak, biscuit was tasty & flaky but again gravy was too thick.

The service was a little slow only got 1 refill the entire time & it wasn't very busy at all at midnight.

Overall it was $20 for 2 people and we left full. It was cheap,fast and OPEN!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,9,8,4,n6nZZuU30zHfxpWsnMREUA

I came here for the $4.49 Steak and Eggs, which is available 24/7 unlike South Point and you don't have to be 21 and over to get the deal BUT you'll need the ACE PLAY card to get hooked up.

The Steak and Eggs were HELLA BOMB or was it because I was fucked up? Hmmm.  The steak was noticeably bigger than the one in the Coronado Cafe in South Point.

Arizona Charlie's on Decatur is closer to my apartment and my cheap hungry ass would sometimes wait till midnight to head over to South Point, which is like a 30 minute drive away.

Update: The new menu is a total rip. So many options have been removed including their well know steak and eggs for under $5 bucks! My sis and I ordered two omelettes with tomato, cheese, jalapeño, spinach and two chocolates for $35. Absurd pricing at this local neighborhood casino. 

Late Night Snack


Arizona Charlies West is still holding its own as an off strip local casino with decent ""wallet friendly"" eats. Stopped in this evening to grab a well deserved snack (also known as a meal) and to sober my conveniently wasted gal pal! 

The service has always been mediocre to be truthful but servers manage to get the job done. 

The place is clean and not quite an ash tray like you would assume by the casino area. 

My dinner Caesar salad was satisfying (drenched in dressing though) $7.99
I ordered hash browns and toast as well which was also saturated in butter. 

My gal pal had a shrimp dinner and ate plenty with no complaints. The shrimp looked nice and golden brown. $13.99

If your in the mood for cheap decent food this place is definitely recommended!

Of course I'll be back!

I have to say their breakfast specials are hard to beat for the price.  I've had every single one of them at least once.  I mean $2.99 for The Skillet Breakfast with two eggs, hash browns and choice of bacon or sausage and toast or biscuit and gravy.  Come on!  Of course, you have to order a drink which costs more than the breakfast, I think an orange juice cost me about $3.50, but it's still a great deal.  Steak and eggs is only $3.99.

If you order the biscuits and gravy the biscuits are literally swimming in gravy.

Service is generally fine.  Was served by a jolly waitress at the counter who really enjoyed her job and deserved to be cast in a network sit-com as a waitress for a 6 digit salary.  On the other hand, one time I worked a full day in Los Angeles, drove 6 hours to Vegas dead tired, and got treated like a moron by another waitress when I asked her to repeat the specials because I was so groggy.

I had the chicken pot pie which was good, and the corn beef and cabbage which was really good, but served only on Thursdays.

Sourdough is a place where you can always eat good food at sweet deal prices. Great menu selections, specials for card members and quick seating at the counter. There are of course some trade-offs. 
1. The staff do as best as they can. The place is always doing business and they don't staff enough people and they are too tired to ""hustle"" and get that food and drink out there. They are good people but they don't drive Mercedes home with a mountain of tips. If you want that speed and quality you can pay for it next door at Ron's. It's ""Diner"" service with a good step above Diner quality food. Give'm a rest because they deal with...
2. Long term regular customers. Social Security could open a monthly check window at the Cashier here. You get people arguing how the breakfast went up to $3 as if they haven't paid for gas in 10 years. Many are cranky, know the workers and talk like they are co-workers.
