266984,2012-08-28,0,LPnbHWVedn2oX3WGkHOJSQ,"A solid lunch option for Downtown-ites.  The place is located on the ground floor of the Molasky Corporate Center, which is also where you park.  (Jason's provides one hour of parking validation, just give the cashier your parking ticket when you pay; each additional half hour is $1.)

It gets really busy during the lunch hour, but I've found that getting there ten minutes early helps beat the lunch time rush.  But even if there's a long line, it moves relatively quickly.

I love that there a ton of different options -- soups, salads, and sandwiches, or if it floats your boat, a giant baked potato.  (The potato is like the size of a small football.)  The variety is especially nice if you're with a big group.  On the downside, it can get pretty loud inside.  

The food is prepped quickly.  But in my opinion, the best thing about Jason's is the soft serve.  Whether it's vanilla, chocolate, or swirled, it's a perfect way to cap off lunch.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,0,0,4,lTEIzI7B1Xdvdd6rH4g-sg

There is outside seating, where you can take a peak of downtown and the ongoing traffic down Bonneville. All in all, one of my faves!

P.S. I love to grab my ice cream to go, head up to the 7th floor and sit in the awesome SNWA park area. :)

dislikes:
1)  sandwiches were substandard.  the chicken sandwich made the bread super soggy by the time it got delivered.  the rye bread for my ham sandwich was dry as eff.
2)  drinks.  we got 3 waters and random 3 soda for the group of us to pick, awkward.  you either get first dibs or you're stuck with whatever is left.
3)  no standardization.  first day we just got canned soda and bottled waters, second day drink cups and ice miraculously appeared with the drinks.  
4)  chips.  one ginormous bag of ruffles to share.  better get first dibs here too or set a ""pour out of the bag instead of reaching in with your hand"" rule or else you're about to get some tainted chips.

They have a great selection of sandwiches, soups and baked potatoes and sometimes I find myself not knowing what to get. I usually go for lunch but stopped by in the morning today (since Cafelatte was closed) and tried a breakfast panini that was absolutely delicous! The bread was grilled to crispy perfection and the egg and bacon were good and not overly greasy. 

During lunch you can eat at the salad bar, which I never have, or order off the menu. All their sandwiches are pretty good and I don't necessarily like one better than the other since all the ones I've had so far were delicious. They also have huge baked potatoes and bowls of soup that are good for the times I don't feel like having a sandwich. Service is wonderful here and even though it can get pretty busy here during lunch, the line seems to move along efficiently. If you dine in, you can even enjoy free soft serve ice cream, which I tend to forget about!

When I took a turkey wrap, I opened it up to make sure there wasn't onions in it, instead I found guacamole.  Very little turkey itself and tons of lettuce.  It was also on a wheat tortilla, which was not tasty at all.

Healthy and filling, the mixed greens never appear wilted and there's a variety of veggie toppings. I like how the salad bar isn't limited to just veggies and the standard salad dressings; pasta salads, couscous, and hummus are also offered.

There are a few sweet items to finish (maybe even start) off your meal, like chocolate pudding and mini gingerbread muffins. The mini gingerbread muffin was my favorite with its crunchy exterior and soft and moist inside. The pudding was OK, and the only special trait about it were the chocolate chips, but I prefer having a small cone of chocolate or vanilla yogurt from the soft-serve machine. 

Because this Jason's Deli is located in a multi-level office building, it receives plenty of customers during lunchtime. The long lines only look intimidating, but service is efficient, so you never have to wait too long.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,2,3,4,nZXNdmil17V88Swci1pMEQ

I have never seen a Jason's Deli this well managed and ran.  There is not much they can do about the wait to order as they have everyone available working on taking orders and getting them out. The wait after you order for your food is FAR less then the amount of time to order but again the location of this place only allows them to do the best they can and I guarantee you they are doing the best they can and then some.

I've been a fan of Jason's for years, with their extensive menu and great salad bar, I've always liked this place for a ""lighter"" lunch. 

This Jason's is located in the bottom corner of an office building, so it's clearly catering to corporate America, however if you plan on making a trip and don't work in the office building, you should know the attached parking garage is $3/half hour. I would recommend walking from another location if possible, but it sounded good so I paid to park!

The interior resembles every other Jason's I've been to, same decor and layout. You order at the counter, the salad bar and drinks are located more towards the middle and then there is plenty of seating. It was probably 1:30pm by the time we arrived on a Monday, so it was pretty dead, but I would imagine they get a lot of traffic during lunch hour from the businesses upstairs. 

Friendly staff working, and the food was on par with what I expect from Jason's. I had a tuna melt with fruit as a side, and my girlfriend ordered the penne pasta with marinara sauce and meatballs. They delivered the penne pasta with chicken and a white sauce, but upon bringing it to their attention they were apologetic, kind and replaced it very quickly. A+ customer service.

5891111,2014-04-24,0,LPnbHWVedn2oX3WGkHOJSQ,"This is my favorite JD location. It's my to-go place for everyday lunch and by FAR the best  option in downtown (yes, I said it. Screw you Le Thai, Eat, and other hip places ).  You can go healthy with soup and salad or  nuts with ice cream and muffins. 

What really makes the difference is the staff. Great customer service! Everyone is super friendly. Place is clean and food quality is consistent. 

Because I go during the week, I usually get soup and salad. One of the best options for healthy eating. After a while I find it difficult not to get my greens for lunch. Honestly it is the best lunch under $10 ($9.60).  

I think I have been here more than 70 times during the last couple of years. 

Lots of bureaucrats, cops, and attorneys!!",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,1,0,5,RxAKNrcNLyHptzxOIZeiGA

This is considering that the atmosphere feels dead and service was treacherous. Trying to figure out what I wanted on the menu, the cashier lady kept harassing me, ""So have you decided? ... I got a job to do ... taking all day aren't you?"" This lady was extremely rude and was lucky I didn't just walk out. I got the ""Rachel"" and it was ok.

It has been almost impossible to find a Louisiana-style muffaletta in Norcal, so I was only too happy to stuff my face with one here last week. It was delicious, as always! The staff here are friendly and fast, it's clean, and it looks like it can get busy at lunchtime. The only reason I deducted a star is because if you aren't on foot or working in the building, the parking garage is expensive.

I recommend this place... The food is consistently good and with the variety they offer, you're sure to find something you will love, including their super-fresh salad bar. 

And I finally got my Muffy!",uIB8qFzG5E3PUGfiCiUmqg,0,0,4,78XPPdXMerq0AJnyOm1y7Q
5939858,2015-10-28,0,LPnbHWVedn2oX3WGkHOJSQ,"There are several reasons why you should stay away from this business but the top two are food pricing and customer service. The latter is why Jason's Deli will fail and file for bankruptcy within the next 3 to 5 years. #1 They did not hire a great staff. #2 Even one of the owners of this location Christopher Salen did not listen to the customer. #3 Did not take immediate action to unsatisfied customer. No matter what the situation, never tell your customers that they are wrong. Even if your customer was the one at fault, you do not want
to point fingers or make him/her feel embarrassed. The main priority is to sort out the problem and continue to ensure that your customers have an enjoyable experience in your operation. #4 Don't tell customers that ""It's your policy"" There is nothing more infuriating
for a customer than to hear than the words ""It's our policy."" This implies that your restaurant is inflexible and unwilling to work out a solution that will ensure that your customer has an enjoyable experience. If you want a better dining experience with true competitive pricing on menu items do not go here. On a health note: I strongly believe that meat is stored improper where it fails to meet Nevada Health Code requirements so BEWARE!",HAx6BZefc86jPtbgivE1sA,0,0,1,zx_IXM6EyPpkUJMZgdIkFg

I ordered the mini croissant platter and it was a big waste of $64. The only thing that was fresh was the pre packaged pickles. I put in the order at 7:15am and told them pick up was at 9:15am and at 9:30 they were still working on the order. I asked the lady if time would be an issue, she told me no but they were still throwing together the order when I got there and it tasted like it was thrown together too. I think they would've tasted better if the bread was fresh. After everyone had the same consensus on how bland everything was, we won't be ordering with them again.",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,1,0,2,23IlqH99CFBxK3BdFM-MFg
