Shortly after placing the order you get a notification that they need more time to prepare your order. It actually took between an hour and half to an hour and forty five minutes for both deliveries. I would advise ordering ahead if you want your meal at a specific time.  The food was delicious (teriyaki burger, meatball sub, calamari, french fries & salad were all among items ordered). Can't wait to try the pizza and calzones.",O2tyo6tUmGyXKfvJPEpkvg,0,0,4,HFC6hCy5p-YaZo7e9thQkA

Food was delicious and most importantly the special requests where actually followed and the order was complete. Had the antipasto salad, the turkey blt and garlic bread. Garlic bread was the standard pizza place garlic bread but not bad. Partner loved his salad. We usually order from another just for that salad but I think we have a new place to order from. Can't wait to try more things from the menu.  


**second time** forgot my salad but delivered the salad dressing. Ordered the chili cheese burger and if you don't like mayo on your burger don't order. Very disappointed. Not listed anywhere that it has mayo. So kind of gross. Hot sausage sub was just so so. Hope it's just a bad day for them but will be awhile before they get another chance.",Ido0RL0wDtbZB2eToWE4hg,0,0,2,wsfORR0thpteMjUxfOWJyA
