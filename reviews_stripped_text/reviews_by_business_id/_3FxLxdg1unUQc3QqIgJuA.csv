35594,2013-03-12,0,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"T-Bones is a very nicely decorated, upscale  steakhouse located in the Red Rock Hotel/Casino.  It was my first time there, and it happened to be for a business dinner so not your usual dinner date night.  Instead, we had a prix fixe menu which included shrimp cocktail, heirloom tomatoes, Caesar salad,  petite filet mignon, and various dessert treats.  Overall, the service was just OK.  At these types of meetings, the servers don't want to interrupt too much, but a little more attentiveness to our drink levels would have been appreciated.  

As for the food, my steak was a bit undercooked.   I ordered medium rare and it came out pretty red throughout the steak.  A few of my colleagues steaks were very rare and had to be sent back.  The appetizers and Caesar salad were good, but nothing to get overly excited about.  The side dishes included mashed potatoes and green beans.  While the green beans were perfectly cooked, the potatoes definitely need some work.  They were very runny and didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  The chef chose various desserts for us and nobody was complaining about these as they were devoured.  Although I dove right into one of the deep fried oreos (which was delicious btw), I couldn't help but question why we were eating a deep fried oreo at an upscale steakhouse that charges upwards of $50 for a steak.  Just me being snooty I guess.  Overall, the steak was good quality but the rest was just OK.  I'm sure you could find a better steakhouse in town for the money!",wl3BnGZs0KnOts4M5YLBjw,1,0,3,iULIvlATdtSuCSFy8WTVeA

We received our food with no check back from our server, the bus boy bagged up our leftovers and we waited 15 mins until the server decided to ask about dessert! We said no, he sort of chuckled and walked away.  He presented our check by almost tossing it at me as he walked by. The food was decent but the whole experience was very upsetting not to mention we were seated in a booth in the bar, not on request but didnt mind so we were charged a 17% entertainment tax... So for $200 I would have expected better service since the server works for tips I would have expected more. It was horrible.

As self declared foodies, we have tried and critiqued our way through almost every fine dining restaurant on the Strip. For my boyfriend's birthday, we decided to branch out and dine at T-Bones in Summerlin (and enjoy an awesome staycation @ Red Rock!). The experience from start to finish was top notch. 

The Steakhouse Salad is to die for...that dressing is amazing! I had the petite filet which was cooked perfectly. The BF had the Queen Cut Prime Rib (huge!) and the Lobster Chowder. We enjoyed the garlic mash and mac n' cheese as sides. Everything was SO delicious! We got talked into (it didn't take much) ordering deep fried oreos as dessert and WOW were those 2 lbs I gained worth it! Pricing was aligned with other steakhouses of this caliber in Las Vegas, but felt more worth it since there were no gimmicky themes and we didn't have to yell to hear each other.

Outstanding service by the entire waitstaff, but especially our main server Mike. He put up with my boyfriend's dad's jokes and made the evening extremely enjoyable.

Still very noisy with blaring cover music (not even the real artists) played throughout our meal.  So much for atmosphere!   First round of drinks was excellent as expected.  Second round was much lower quality, probably bar stock.   Food and service was excellent as always.   The lack of decorum seriously diminishes the experience.

The water boy was rude. The waiter was hardly present. The restaurant was pretty empty-- maybe a fourth full. No big parties.  

I had a wedge salad.  My husband had tomato and mozzarella salad  The wedge lettuce was crispy and fresh but had too much salad dressing. The tomato and mozzarella salad lacked a flavorful balsamic vinegar and it was watery. 

I ordered a filet cooked medium plus. Pink, no blood. The waiter thought I should butterfly it!  Seriously?!?  Okay, the waiter was undereducated but certainly the chefs wouldn't be, right? Wrong! I expected a steak house to serve a perfectly cooked steak. I received a rare steak--actually the middle was raw, cold and purple.  After several minutes and literally flagging down one of the three servers, the female, my steak was taken back to be cooked more. When the steak was returned to me I was told it had just come off the heat and would I cut it. Ugh, they wanted me to cut into a steak without giving it time to rest!  This is a fine steakhouse?  

My husband had finally had it, asked them to take everything back. Our plan to eat a meal together-- without kids-- was foiled by incompetence. At this point, the wine steward/acting manager came to the table and tried to make things better, but the meal and our date night was ruined.

The service was very efficient, so much so we didn't get to finish the food on our plates, they were trying to bus them so soon.  However, overzealousness you can overlook but there was not personality or style, it was like a really good waitress at Denny's, except this meal was about to cost $300.

The food was the biggest disappointment.  My wife had an eclectic array and it was mostly very good, her crab cakes were just terrific, the Brussel Sprout salad, not so much.  The steaks should have been just wow, and both my sons and mine were luke-warm, with a hard crust on both.  He had the NY with Gorgonzola and I had the bone in rib eye.  Neither was anything above average and for what they charge you would think they should be spectacular.

We may or may not give them another try, but it was just so opposite of Hank's it really was a Christmas downer.",ll2UxyM3nfL4DOiR5cf6ew,3,0,2,szXO5G2DxtAfWce-mYr5kQ

The attractive hostesses (this is Vegas, so no surprise) were both very friendly and welcoming (this WAS a surprise... because Vegas) and got us seated right away.

The food was quite good.  I mean, really, really good.  The portions were sized right, but we did make the mistake of ordering three of the sides after ordering salads and entrees.  There was simply too much for the three of us.  Try the tator tots and select the bacon/cheese role and pretzel breads of the choices offered.  You won't be disappointed!

The service staff was quite attentive and performed their roles well.  The corn side was too burnt for our tastes and the first glass of wine took awhile.  Regardless, highly recommend trying this restaurant if staying at the Red Rock.  If not staying, make a trip off the strip to enjoy the entire place.

Today it did not and it was missed a bit but still worth the money and a great way to start the meal. The soups and salad were all good ( French onion, lobster chowder and Caesar). For dinner we each ordered steaks. They came out at the proper temperature and had a good flavor but do not compare to Mortons or Carnovino. We had three sides which are good sized and able to be shared: the creamed spinach, the creamed corn, which is great and should be ordered without doubt, and the asparagus, which is a bit bland but fresh. The desserts were all very good and huge. The wine list is extensive and I was able to find a good red that didn't bankrupt us. The only disappointment was my Grey Goose and tonic.

For our first night we decided to treat ourselves to a nice steak dinner at TBones. Bad idea- we received $200 worth of salt and terrible service. We had a drink in the bar first then requested a table. We were less than thrilled when they sat us in the bar but we're pretty easy to please so we went with it. The server took her time to greet us and rushed us through our order as if we were inconveniencing her. We ordered the Steak House Salad, Broccoli, Mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes and 2 small cut filet mignons. The salad came out with the wrong dressing. The waitress took it back and it was back out pretty quick. It was really great once it was corrected and sadly was the best part or our meal. The waitress asked if we would like bread, however, this did not come out until right as our meal was arriving. The steaks and sides came out but we were given augratin potatoes instead of broccoli. The food runner quickly corrected this however, our waitress was nowhere to be found. The first bite of the filet was fantastic but as we each got to our second and third we could barely get through the rest of the steak. It was so salty! Even the garlic mash and the mushrooms were unbearably salty. The manager asked how everything was as he was walking by and no joke did not stop as he asked. I began to speak and let him know but he interrupted and said ""great!"" and kept walking. Our waitress finally came by and at this point we just wanted to get out of there! We gave her our card and she came back with the check but not after she seemed completely inconvenienced by us asking her to box our left overs. As if it could worse, she charged us for the broccoli AND the augratin potatoes! I had to waive her down from another table and she ran off to fix it but apparently was unable to reverse the charge so after 5 minutes of waiting at the table she gave us $10 in cash. I understand this is nit picky but what about the tax that we paid? Sure its only a dollar but when we dropped over $200 for a terrible dinner and even worse service that dollar counts! We are extremely happy to drop money on a steak dinner,in fact we went to SW Steakhouse a few nights later and it was spectacular, but this was just a joke. Spending that much money- I expect good service we shouldn't feel like we are stressing our waitress out and not feel completely miserable due to our meal being so salty.

We had really poor service the last time at the bar.  Never again.  They had a UFC fight on the screens and they were completely bloody, while we were eating our food at the bar.  The female bartender said they had a contract and they couldn't turn the channel.  WOW!    She had a really bad attitude...would never sit in her section again. 

Here the three of us had a three hundred dollar bill....and she couldn't change the channel while we were eating our dinner. 

The scallops came out...they were a special and they were not seared.....yikes......42 a plate ....and not evened seared.  My two friends ate them anyways because they were invited and didn't want to be rude.  I spoke up later...and they said they had eaten too many of them to get them removed from our bill.  Really crazy...I don't know how this bartender keeps her job.

I ordered my $50 bone-in ribeye steak rare and it came out medium rare plus.  The parts that were closer to rare were still pretty tough.  I only ate half of it, it was so bad.  Nobody asked me how my steak was cooked, and nobody was anywhere near me, so there was nobody to tell to make it right.

I had no beverage for most of the meal(once I finished the glass of wine) and nobody cared.  I drink a lot of water, but alas, not until my meal was over I had to snag a runner or bar back to grab me a glass of water.

Then Susan and Jeric kept carrying on about the raisin nut bread and again I cheated and had a small piece.  It was the best bread I ever had.  

The waiter here was great and we ordered a bunch of menu items to share amongst the four of us and the waiter was very accommodating.  The Rib-eye with cilantro sauce was great.

We felt extremely ignored and not only was this the worst service I have ever received at a steak house, but even more so because of the lack of courtesy. 
Im even more disappointed that the management didn't address the situation as a two person dinner took over 21/2 hours to complete and with total un satisfaction.  You guys really slacked in every department and we are very easy to please.",Wi_NbwKoKJIhxhj9-YM13g,0,0,1,cf3E1v9tU9SQhygGQ-rdDg

Total lack of attention to 1) acknowledging we were waiting to place our order, 2) re-filling our water glasses and delivering cocktails, and 3) delivering our food once it was ordered.  Took over an hour to get our over-priced meal.

One of the floor managers came over to ask how everything was...I gave him our complete and utter dissatisfaction of the experience.  He comped our appitizers...BFD.  I'm guessing he stays busy every night listening to customer complaints.

I live in Summerlin so I stopped in in person a week ahead to make reservations for last Saturday night. I told the waitress I had family coming and it was a special occasion so we wanted a nice table. She said 'well, then you certainly want a booth in the main dining room. The bar tables would be too noisy'. So we arrive, and after waiting 25 minutes past the reservation time we finally are told the only table is...you guessed it, in the bar! 
Food was average, server Gabrielle could not keep up. His helper, Junior was great! After a drawn out dinner, we ordered desert and waited 25 minutes...ridiculous.
Gave it another chance last night. 3 of us stopped for drinks and appetizers. Hostess said the only place they would seat us for drinks and apps was a high top in bar right by piano and patio entrance door. I asked about other free tables in the bar...she smugly said they were for 'full dinner only'. It was 5:00 and the place was near empty...better tables were available. The ladies in dresses got a cold breeze each time the door was opened. $350 in drinks and apps and we were treated like we were not wanted and $350 was being cheap.

The decor and atmosphere is really nice, we sat at the bar for a birthday party, my wife and I both ordered the 11oz filet, and I had jumbo shrimp cocktail with it, she  (very good) had a wine to drink and I had a Pellegrino.  The tab came to $175.  Wait staff is friendly.  Where it went wrong was the waiter who brought our steaks out screwed up our order, my wife's steak was supposed to be medium/well and mine was supposed to be medium rare.  When I ate mine, I thought it was overdone quite a bit and really didn't enjoy it much, and when she ate hers, she thought it wasn't cooked enough, but it wasn't until about 3/4 the way through dinner that we commented on our meals and realized the waiter mixed them up (Birthday party, chatting with others around us and not scrutinizing our food and commenting on it with each other immediately).  When the bartender asked if everything was ok, we mentioned it and she felt bad and wanted to try to rectify it, but at that point, we both weren't that hungry anymore.  When we were ready to cash out, we waited at least 15 minutes to request the check, which she brought pretty quick once we asked, but when I signed it and put my credit card in with the receipt, it was still another 15 minutes before another bartender finally took it, so it was a half hour just to settle up with the check.  The 2 stars go to the decor and atmosphere, as well as the shrimp cocktail and the friendliness of the wait staff and bartenders, but the actual quality of the service lacked and was enough of a downer to knock down the review to 2 stars.  For a $175 dinner for 2, how hard is it to get those little indicators you poke into the meat to tell the server which one is which?  Will I come here again?  If I'm invited to another get together, sure, but I won't suggest it or make plans to go here on my own.",pK6nf46LIccTQwon-Gunew,2,1,2,alEKtITNCQK5vs6Be5b98w

I enjoyed them, even though I don't really like sea food.  We then shared the mixed green salad, which had avocado and bacon and was chopped. It was very delicious!

I got the filet and bf got the Rib eye. Both steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I have to say, I thought his was more flavorful and up there with one of the best I have ever had. Shocking from me since I am a filet steak kind of girl. We did both get the Gorgonzola add-on as well to enhance flavor. Sides we got Au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus. Both pretty good, but the Au-gratin could have had more flavor. Still enjoyable.

Desert we got the toffee cake, which was very good, but needed more ice cream. Server was Mike, very pleasant and attentive, as well as the busser.

1386077,2013-11-14,5,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"This was a total disaster. I do monthly dinners for groups of 10-25 of my clients in town from around the country. This month I had the dinner at T-Bones as I using the hotel for my guests. This was due to SEMA being in town and my normal facility was booked. Normally I use the Silverton and Twin Creeks Steak House. I was looking forward to the change of venue as I eat at the Twin Creeks monthly.

This was a beyond disappointing. The facility is very nice and has a nice private room that holds about 20. I had a smaller group of 15 so it was plenty of room. I was running about 30 minutes late and was more than a little surprised when I showed up and that everyone was still without appetizers or even bread baskets. I ordered a drink and greeted guests. I would say 10 more minutes and my drink arrived and then it was about ordering appetizers (45 minutes after people had arrived). I thought that was way too long to make people wait.

Well we ordered dinner and skipped appetizers because people were getting hungry at this point. I like to wrap up about 930-10 and at this rate we would be there till 11. One server and one busser was all that was allocated to our table and I am sure they had other tables outside this area as well because it was slow service. 

One drink later and another 45 minutes the food arrived. Presentation was terrible on the steaks. I should have taken a picture of it as it was actually funny. Two small semi crisped tomatoes on a plate with a New York Steak. They all looked the same. Just lazy looking. Why garnish it at all? A steak would have been presented alone just fine. People were actually laughing which is not a good sign. So I had ordered the blackened halibut. It came with a type of spice on it (wasn't sure what it was). It tasted okay, but was overpowering of the fish to say the least. I didn't mind the spice taste, however the fish was overcooked. It was dry and and seared more that a third through. Clearly indicating it had been left on too long. I chewed my way through it which was uneventful. I had also ordered Broccoli and mushrooms as side dishes. 

Side dishes: This was just ridiculous. Numerous people ordered the broccoli with hollandaise sauce  and literally the serving size was massive. The server should have made the corrections knowing that we had just ordered enough broccoli to serve 20-25 people. So it arrived, steamed. I mean steamed. Nothing else. It came with a sauce which they didn't bring until 10 minutes later after having to ask for it (meaning they forgot it on numerous orders). It was steamed and not even close to worth the $10 as I literally could have made this in 5 minutes at home. I love steamed veggies but this was so plain and massive it seemed wrong.

Overall I saw three of my people with steaks that were done wrong. Medium was well done. I mean done! Torched. Another was medium rare, was a plate full of blood. I cant imagine a $60 steak looking so poorly but it was right there for me to witness over and over again. I sampled my girlfriends New York. Cooked too long, but more importantly a grisly tough steak. I swear a NY from Albertsons was better quality.

I probably wouldn't be so harsh in this review if I was at a place that was priced accordingly . This however was almost worth calling Vegas Metro and filing a theft report. It was low quality ingredients, low quality service, and prepared lazily without expertise. I am not a food snob at all and mostly eat in Chinatown and often look past the lawn furniture decor and such to have exciting and well prepared meals. This was the opposite, as if not to notice the food was terrible the decor and price tried to impress you. I am not impressed even the least. 

Now the BEST PART of this experience was a day later when at least three of us came down with unexplained bowel movement issues. This place was a colon cleanser for at least 3 guests and who knows didn't admit this fact. Either food poisoning or low quality food preparation put my clients and crew riding the porcelain chariot all for the price of $110 per head.

When visiting the Red Rock Resort take a minute and check out T-bones. If not for dinner stop and have a drink or enjoy their happy hour. The restaurant is very nice and trendy inside. You do not need to be dressed formally but it's okay to dress up. When we visit during the summer months I will wear shorts and shirt or jeans and a shirt are acceptable as well any other time of the year. I recommend making a reservation on Open Table; I love racking up the points. If you can ask for Table 23, it is supposed to be one of the top tables in the restaurant. Also, give yourself a good 2 hours when dining here. I think of it like going to the movies and take it in as an experience. 

I am finally writing a review for T-bones and this is was my 8th time dining here. Every visit has been phenomenal. We always receive excellent service from every staff member. It starts as soon as you enter the door to the moment you leave. 
On this most recent visit we went in to celebrate my wife's birthday. We skipped out on wine and went for cocktails. The wife had several Cantaloupe martinis and I went with 3 Isaac Newtons (old fashioned meets Manhattan), they were $16 each. Once you sit down they serve you a variety of breads. I love the pretzel bread. They will bring more if requested. There are plenty of appetizers to choose from so you may need to skip on the bread. As an appetizer I selected the Seafood Jackpot. It was a jackpot for me because I love me some seafood. There are plenty of oysters, king crab, jumbo shrimp, etc., this will set you back about $75; if you are eating here you are probably not worried about the price but I think it's good to know. I think my wife had some of the crab but I ate most of it around 90% of it. I'm such a pig. 

The wife loves the Hearts of Palm salad. Lots of avocado and all the good stuff. The salad can be shared but it is served for one. Wife went with the 18 oz bone-in filet and I had the Wagyu 10 oz striploin. It was a lot of red meat so be prepared. For the sides we shared the corn, asparagus, and a sweet potato. We could have stopped with the corn and asparagus. The sweet potato was out of this world delicious. I do not think I have ever tasted a sweet potato cooked so perfectly. 

All of the food was cooked to perfection. I love visiting T-bones and I love the service. The ""Captain"", Darlene went above and beyond making our meal memorable and enjoyable. Roni was another member who helped us out and she gave us phenomenal service. The staff was so nice and personable. We had several staff members including the manager stop by to wish my wife a happy birthday. They all helped make my wife feel a little more special on her very special day. I would like to thank T-bones and the Red Rock Resort for the excellent service and food. I cannot wait to go back. Happy eating!",5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,7,3,5,NBqyMrwOAmNgft_wp2_hzg

1421121,2014-01-06,3,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"Now that I'm a tad older, I can appreciate the aesthetics of ""fine dining"" a bit more, from service, décor, to food. There's a certain orchestrated dance that comes with it. Of course you'll pay a pretty penny. 

T-bones Chophouse doesn't disappoint regarding décor, a very swag restaurant, from the center fire place, to alcohol decorated lined windows, to the bold art piece that serves as the outside facing wall. 

The food was very good. The average ""chop"" will run you between $50 to $60 dollars. The salad and each side are roughly $12. The varieties of artisan-quality breads were exceedingly phenomenal. The chopped salad was exceptional, made with attention. The appetizer Poke runs with the best made in Hawaii, even better regarding presentation. If you're a meat eater, you won't be disappointed as the beef is aged and seasoned well. The sides are equally as nice, as I made special note of the roasted tomatoes. 

With décor and food marked as ""A's"", let's move on to the service. While it was by in no means bad, it was under from what you'd expect from a fine establishment. The server was polite and pleasant, which makes it hard to down his service. He didn't seem to be an expert on the menu or rather didn't have much to say when he introduced himself. Orders were taken going around the table, rather than ladies first. His assistant was a bit coarse, his placing and removal of plates were more attuned to a busser at a roadside diner. Our finished meals were left a little too long, as they were a bit slow to clear. Rarely did both check on us, which was noticed by all in our medium size party. We had to look for them and try to catch their attention as they passed by. We had to remind both to fill our glasses, get a forgotten coffee, and missing dessert... more than a couple of occasions. Curiously, the sommelier never offered the cork for inspection. The front of the house manager didn't stop by to act as host, checking on us and chatting a bit. At the end, it was the whole lot of little things that added up to a lack luster service experience. Again, by in no means was it bad, but just inattentive and a lack of refinement. I'll stop here, because I'm beginning to sound hoity-toidy. 

With that said we all felt a bit let down by our experience at T-bones Chops. The management should invest in formal professional development of the service staff, putting the ""fine"" in ""fine dining"". There's something great to be said about a well-trained staff, a certain level of confidence and showmanship. 

Décor & Food: Top notch! 
Service: Think Black Angus Steakhouse

Some standouts are the creamed corn, the truffle tater tots, their great wine selection, and of course the steaks. Their buttermilk fried chicken with sage gravy is the best fried chicken you will find anywhere on the planet.

If you order their mashed potatoes, order them with sour cream and chive mixed in - amazing!

For dessert, the fried oreos are both novelty - and surprisingly awesome. Even better and more decadent though is the hot toffee cake. They used to have an AMAZING chocolate cake, but have since replaced it with a replacement that sadly wouldn't stand up to supermarket quality scrutiny.

If you want to get any sort of service from this place, make sure to have cash on you to tip the bartender before even ordering your drinks just to get his attention.

He finally took our order but another customer came up and threw him a $20, all of a sudden our order gets deleted from his brain and he helps this gentleman instead of us. We never got our drinks after that. And we normally give tips after a service is provided , NOT before, but if thats how things operate over here, I don't ever plan to go back here. i ended up telling the bartender to just forget our order and that I thought his behavior was awful.

We just left very upset and disappointed with our experience. I work in a hotel on the strip and customer service is our main focus, this establishment has NO clue what that means. And trust me when I say ALL my friends, family and coworkers will hear about this. I won't even recommend this place to my worst enemy!

We ended up at another restaurant in the casino, we sat at the bar and promptly got service from the bartender. we ended up telling her our horrible experience we just had at T bones and her exact words were... "" I hear that ALL the time!""  the other bartender walked over while we were talking and agreed that he hears it all the time how horrible the service is at the T-Bone Steakhouse. 

How can an establishment with such a horrible reputation in service stay in business? 

If you want to save money by not spending any of it at a restaurant that doesn't serve you or take your order, this is the perfect place for you. I had better service at Dick's Last Resort and they are allowed to be jerks in their work place. T-Bone Steakhouse is a natural at not caring about their customers.

Restaurant and bar area overlooks the pool and when it's nice out you can sit outside.  There is music, a piano singer, however he stops right when Happy Hour ends, at least he did last couple of times we went.  Food on happy hour menu is very generous in size and pretty tasty.  $5 for a large burger is a pretty good deal!

1494082,2012-06-21,0,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"My friends and I had reservations, for which we were at least 15 minutes early. However, even with reservations, they didn't have our table prepared and us seated until 15 minutes past our reservation time. No complimentary appetizers or drinks for making us wait??

One person in the group got the grilled salmon, which was small, bland, dry, and worse than anything she could've made at home. Definitely not worth the 35 bucks or however much it costed. Never getting fish at a steakhouse again.

Now, the main reason as to why I'm writing this review, to critique the steak. The number one factor for what makes or breaks a steak for me is FLAVOR, which this 52 dollar steak had NONE of. Sure they had that not so good sauce on the side that you could slather your steak in, but for me, the perfect steak just needs salt and pepper and rubbed with spices. The single redeeming factor is that the meat is truly tender. I rested my fork on it and the prongs started sinking into the meat!

I agree the most with Chad P.'s review. Too bad I didn't listen to him over all the overwhelming 5 star reviews.

The food is great.  It's a joy to go to this restaurant.
Keep in mind it's not cheap.  A couple will leave a couple hundreds but worth it.
When your done and want to stretch your legs you wanna go outside (a door next to the piano).  You will find an amazing lounge with pit fire, sofas, water fountain and pool view.  Truly a beautiful spot.

In general, this restaurant offers extremely large portions, even the salad.  The baked potatoes were enormous (I recommend splitting) and one order of asparagus was enough to feed all four of us.  This is great because the items are a la carte, and can add up quickly.  The meat selections were the most expensive, but delectable - totally worth it.  (We had filet mignon and another guest actually had buffalo, he loved it.)  They bring you various sauces for the meat and we ordered a delicious side of sauteed mushrooms - YUM.  Make sure to do that.  Add in an impressive wine list and this place was perfect.  Oh, for dessert, you have to try the fried oreos.

It featured an array of fresh and delicious seafood from oysters to large shrimp to lobster tail and blue crab meat. In addition, we each had a cocktail... a double gray goose with redbull is $24, so just keep that in mind if ordering premium alcohol. The menu looked very steak centric (it is a steakhouse after all) and the prices seem to be toward the higher end with the likes of SW or CUT. I can't comment on whether or not they are warranted, but they are most definitely not cheap even if they are ""off strip"". The ambiance is romantic and relaxed. The design modern and elegant.

It's a little hit or miss with the servers so we try to always get her section. Came early and waited at the bar for a bit. Bar wasn't as busy as usual. Was steady but not like the usual craziness there. One of the drone hostesses sat us ... at a table in the bar area and not in our servers section. It was loud and well, it just sucked. We told hostess we would really rather wait for a normal table in a quiet section with the server we requested. We were told 30 minutes, grabbed some drinks and sat outside. Jennifer that works outside was really congenial and smiled and was courteous unlike the rest of the hostesses. Waited... waited. 30 minutes went by, then an hour. Spoke to hostesses who were totally unaccommodating said we still had to wait. Watched a walk-in couple come in and then promptly be seated in the section we requested. Wtf? Went back the hostess who gave us a blank look and got manager. Think that's when they realized they forgot about us and gave someone else our seats. So needless to say hour and half later no table, no food. Only crappy over priced drinks from a bartender who clearly didn't want to serve us. Vince the manager offered, after we'd already paid of course, to take care of our drinks. Also offered us a to go order =\ So I guess they at least tried...No thanks. While in the middle of our conversation another couple came in and interrupted him... he left us mid conversation standing there and chatted with them. What the hell? We just left and no one stopped us. Really surprised! We used to eat here pretty often.
Over all a totally awful evening... at t-bones anyhow. Went over to Vinter Grill and had a nice dinner there instead. 
Love server Denise here and food is great. Rest of staff is unaccommodating and just plain rude. A shame because we really like this place. For price you pay its just disgustingly unnecessary.

CAESAR SALAD $12
Classic Caesar or Kitchen Sink w/Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Hearts of Palm $6
*He ordered it the ""kitchen sink"" way.  OMG!  Best.salad.ever.  The dressing is with a horseradish base instead of an anchovy base.  It was fabulous!  Truth be told- I wish I would have ordered this as my meal.

You go to a steakhouse and you order steak, right?  With that being said- I expect the steaks to be cooked to perfection.

My mom and I both ordered:
PRIME Wet aged for a minimum of 28 days
PETITE FILET MIGNON* Greater Omaha 8 oz $39
*We both ordered the steaks cooked to medium.  They came out medium rare/rare.  Now I would MUCH rather have my steaks under-cooked than overcooked, but I'm one to NEVER send anything back.  Was the steak good?  Sure.  Is it my favorite steak?  Not even close.

My husband ordered:
WAGYU RIB EYE CAP* Snake River Farms Boise, Idaho 8 oz $52
*OMG!  This was soooo good!  It had a nice crispy sear on the outside and if you know wagyu beef, then you know its like buttah!  YUM! 

Our sides:
Creamed Spinach $10
*My favorite is still from Ruth's Chris Steak House.  This was good.

Garlic Mashed Potatoes $10

If someone brought me here, and their company credit card bought dinner, I'd be all in! But I wouldn't want my friends or family to come out of pocket at this place. Nor would I spend my own money here. 

I've tried eating here four times, and though the food was good...sometimes it came out in waves - some people were served while others waited. Sometimes it took a long, long time for our table to get the food. Such a long time that you go from being hungry to  being over it. And P.O.ed.

2125444,2014-02-13,4,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"I had a Yelp review intervention tonight.  I was dining with 5 other friends from work who had a much different experience than I did and I was deputized by the group to review the restaurant with our collective opinions rather than mine alone as all of my other reviews are.  Let me say up front if it were me alone I would awarding somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  I thought the food and service was above average and I found the restaurant to be comfortable and the noise level to be at an intensity that contributed to a lively atmosphere but did not inhibit conversation.  

My trusty companions felt the food was average.  Most ordered the petite filet mignon (huge mistake in a chophouse if you ask me) and I along with another coworker had the bone-in rib eye (the steak of all steaks the only cut of beef I eat unless it's prime rib).  As sides we ordered Tater Tots, Grilled Tomato's, Mac & Cheese and Hash Browns (see pictures).  T-Bones brags that their prime steaks are wet aged 20 days and then dry aged another 15 days.  I personally found my rib eye to be very good how companions found their steaks to be lacking flavor and the texture unappealing.  I have to agree the sides needed help and in my opinion were the biggest disappointment of the evening.  I had read up on the menu before arriving and was very excited by the hash browns with a sunny side up egg (how could you resist).  Unfortunately, they do not taste as good as they look.  They were definitely lacking flavor unless you count the prestigious amount of salt they must season them with.   For a party of six you need two eggs instead of one.   Skip the grilled tomatoes.  Big mistake!  They're topped with American cheese (OMG).  Don't bother with this side dish (besides why would you order fruit at a chophouse).  Tater tots are ""eh!""  Very small portion and again over seasoned with salt.  The mac & cheese was another small portion and as my friend put it ""they were topped with Kraft Bacon Bits straight from the supermarket.""  I don't know about that but they were not memorable and now days when everyone is doing gourmet Mac & Cheese it better be good and it better be special.  These were not. 

Needless to say as a group we were disappointed and we left without having desert because of it. 

My friend summed it up by stating, ""This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in a meal while in Las Vegas.  After a moment of considering this statement I had to agree.  I would not visit T-Bones again which is a very disappointing statement to make for many reasons not the least of which was I thought that I had enjoyed it more until I evaluated my experience by that statement.  Would I spend $500 for a meal like this again?  The answer is no I wouldn't and there are many other places in Las Vegas I were I would.",veUS1l3hes5PI3824b9MkQ,6,3,2,0KiYe3QEGyQIWcDW6Jg-OA

2196359,2014-01-09,0,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"The restaurant itself is beautiful, very classic steakhouse, as is the menu. As we went for an early dinner on a weeknight, it was not crowded and we were able to get a table right away without a wait. The service was very attentive and nice, but our server didn't seem to be very knowledgable about menu or drink offerings. 

We started off with the beef carpaccio and the seafood tower. I was impressed with the seafood tower- it was amazing! Lump crab, jumbo shrimp, stone crab, lobster, and oysters.  All of my favorite things!! The accompanying sauces were also good, but my friend did not realize that one was fresh horseradish and took a HUGE scoop of it on his shrimp... OMG, that was a bad situation!! Luckily, it didn't spoil our meal.

We ordered the 22 oz ribeye, which they sliced at the table so we could share it. We ordered it medium-rare, and it definitely was undercooked- more rare than med-rare. It also was VERY fatty. I know that ribeye is a fattier cut, and that's what I usually like about it, but this was pretty over the top. They did re-cook it for a bit for us, but the damage was pretty much already done.   The mushrooms we ordered on the side were delicious, though.

The other highlight of my meal was dessert- the cheesecake was FAN-TAS-TIC!! One of the best cheesecakes I've had in quite some time. Light, fluffy, moist, melt in your mouth... It definitely made the meal end on a high note.

Price-- Expensive. Surprisingly, the meal was just as expensive as a celeb chef steakhouse on the Strip. Not quite what I expected, but that is par for the course, I suppose.

I've gone back and forth between a 3 and 4 star review, and finally settled on 3 stars.. I had a fine experience, but not fine enough to say that I'm a fan.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,1,1,3,0D9u-Hf7chIIJJdovno0Sw
2206249,2013-02-18,2,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"This is the review for their happy hour.

The Skinny:  so-so on the verge of mediocre food (2.5) service: we were at the bar and it was okay (3) value: extremely expensive and certainly not worth the expense. Avoid! (2).

I've never been a real fan of steakhouses however we recently received a coupon in the mail for $25 off $50 purchase at T-bones. The hubs previously had been there for their happy hour specials and suggested we do this because their regular menu is vastly overpriced. As well, he stipulated that we were not to go on Friday because they charge extra tax for live entertainment. Not usually one to enjoy live music with dinner (I'm more a quiet sort), I agreed.

So we get there right at 5pm and put down our order: a Beef on Weck ($19), Ahi Tuna tacos ($9), Buffalo Chicken Bites ($10), Chicken and Waffles ($10) and Lobster Corn Dogs ($10).

I have no idea what they were thinking charging this much for such subpar cuisine. 

Beef on Weck = Beef on Wreck. It was essentially overcooked prime rib on the equivalent of a Wonderbread bun smothered in bland (thickened with corn starch) au jus. The amount of au jus just killed the dish, making the bread all weird and mucky. It reminded me of the sh*(ty recipes they made us try during home ec class from like a 50's cookbook (let's make Welsh rarebit using Velveta - nasty!). Albeit it was large and came with fries, I'd wager you'd get a better beef sammy at Arbys for about 1/4 of the price. Lame!

The buffalo chicken bites although the flavors were okay, the lack of crispiness really killed it. If you are going to deep fry chicken bites, I want to taste to deep fried goodness. Otherwise what's the point of adding all those extra calories?

Lobster corn dogs were also very weak = too much coating, too little lobster plagued this completely forgettable dish. It comes with two small lobster corndogs.

Ahi Tuna Tacos were okay. There were three small tacos, with some low grade ahi-tuna dressed with avocado. Solid but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere.

The chicken and waffles were also edible and possibly the best dish of the night. The coating of the chicken was okay and the hit of the jalapeno was nice. The waffle was nothing special and I would argue hit too heavily on the vanilla side. I'm not so sure but as a rule: vanilla + savory = bleh. 'Nuff said.

Overall, given the subpar food alone - I would generally not recommend this place at all. Throw in the ripe off prices, I'd say avoid this place like the plague. (2 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,2,2,nBr8otBJNGa4PPg-jXzaMA

Our server, Billy, was excellent. He made wonderful wine pairing suggestions to go with our steaks. At first I thought my wine was terrible... Before our steaks arrived.

For sides we had the macaroni and cheese (delicious), a chipotle style corn (I don't recall the name, but it was tasty), and green beans (very good). My only regret is that I should've ordered my steak medium rare instead of medium! Shame on me!!! By the time desserts rolled around, we were stuffed, but still went for the cheesecake and a deep fried Oreo. Both excellent! Side note- if you like your espresso with lemon, make sure you ask for it as they only provide it upon request.

2289853,2009-02-20,1,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"Disappointing.  If you are looking for a steakhouse in Summerlin, just go to Flemings.  First, we made a reservation on Open Table.  They claimed to not have it, but when I looked on my Blackberry the reservation was there and we got the points.  I don't know if they were trying to get around the fact that they couldn't seat us right away or someone screwed up.  I could overlook that, but it got worse.

We ordered the bone-in rib-eye, petite filet mignon, lobster tail, tomatoes with spinach & cheese, truffle tater tots and a bottle of wine.  The wine was good.  But they didn't make the wine.  

The food took forever to come out.  I can be understanding about that.  The kitchen is in the weeds.  But the servers (we had two) should at least come by and say something reassuring.  Instead they avoided us like the plague until the food came out. 

The tomatoes were awful.  Don't get them.  They claim it is specialty and that is just sad.  The waiter immediately informed us that the tomatoes come with American cheese and asked if we wanted another kind of cheese. American cheese is just weird (Kraft singles?), especially on $10 tomatoes, and I'm assuming they got a lot of complaints.  We ordered them with jack cheese but it was still awful.  The spinach is obviously frozen.  Ugh.  The tater tots were ok.  Not a lot of truffle flavor.  But it takes mad skills to screw up a tater tot.  The lobster tail was really tough and nasty.  Plus, they gave us the drawn butter way to early and all they have to keep it warm is a sad little tea candle.  The bone-in rib eye was ordered medium rare but came out well done.  And the table next to us ordered their steaks well-done (yeah... whatever) and they got medium rare.  Needless to say, food was sent back.  On the positive side, the petite filet mignon was perfect.  Yummy, yummy.  But not enough to save the meal.  I really wanted good lobster.  Oh well.  

Plus, the clientele that comes to this restaurant is not normal.  Ignoring the couple that ordered their steaks well done, we sat next to 2 girls who wanted to tell EVERYONE that it was their anniversary.  Then they would wait for a reaction (no reaction from anyone) and they would explain that they are not lesbians and it is their ""friendship anniversary"".  As if there is even such a thing. Also, these people brought their kid who promptly passed out in the chair in a very awkward position.  I admire the girl's ability to sleep anywhere, but come on, if your kid is about to pass out, don't go to a steakhouse! At least we saw Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi!

This time was with a girl that is roommates or had dated half of the staff. Ok, so, both times I've ordered the new York ($58). I asked for medium. I've been a chef for most of my life and I'm pretty sure i figured out what the cooks are doing. Because of the medium request, they are cooking the steak in the salamander.

Then, when my daughter and each separately ordered the good but least expensive on the list (Imperial, I believe), she poured each of us a flute. But when the bill came, we learned that she had poured the Brut Rose for each of us, at $45 per glass rather than the $17 per glass that we had ordered.

We asked for a table for two and waited ten min or so and then were sat.
Our server took awhile to get over to us but in the meantime we got water poured, a wine list delivered and bread.
Our server finally made it over and we ordered: two Lobster Chowders, Cheateaubriand for two and a side of Hashbrowns. The Lobster Chowder came out and it was decent... Just two lumps of meat sitting on top of the soup, corn and potatoes swimming in the soup as well. I guess I always expect a big ass amount of meat when I order stuff like this but then Im always let down since it only appears to be a SMALL amount of meat.

Half of it was perfect for Mandi L. but I chose to have them cook mine a little longer. I still wanted Medium Rare - but about five minutes later when it came back out, it was cooked nearly Medium WELL! A couple parts might have passed for Medium and Medium Rare but it was definitely overcooked. They asked how it was then and I chose not to send it back. My food would have taken forever and since it was a cut meant for two would they have cooked a whole new one or what??! Anyway it was fine. The vegetables that accompanied the entree were broccoli, asparagus, potatoes, carrots and those little onions. The hashbrowns are served with a sunny side up egg! 
The meal was GOOD but not mind blowing and could have definitely been A LOT BETTER. Our server and the food timing was slow but all the staff was very nice. 
We were also seated right by the fireplace. It's really nice but it is HOT. Once we got our food we did ask if they could turn the fire place off or down and they said they couldnt. They asked if we would like to move tables but by that point we were almost done with dinner so we just decided to stay and sweat it out.",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,3,2,3,EkdKVUHsDhoOkBykC6zVWw

So,
We started off the meal with a basic wedge salad. All good there. Nothing special. The bread was pretty good too. A little bit overkill with the ""Hawaiian volcanic salt"" on the butter, but ok. 

We ordered our food. I ordered the filet medium rare. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib medium rare. We got Mac and cheese and green beans as the side. 

About 20 minutes later broccoli and two filets arrive at our table. The waiter walks away. What shocked me was not that they got our order wrong but that he came back, took the food and brought it to the correct table. Disturbing. 

When we finally got our food, the waiter proceeded to deposit a 10oz bloodied carcass to my boyfriends side of the table. It was cold. Flavorless. Much like canned cat food. 

My filet was salty and cold. The kind of filet you'd expect from a hospital cafeteria. 

The waiter comes back and says ""everything delicious right?"" My boyfriend then tried to return the kill on his plate to the waiter who took it back with no questions asked. 

The waiter then proceeded to ignore us until we asked for our check. We were left to sit and listen to Lana Del Rey cover songs for the next 15 minutes. 

I'm very disappointed with this experience and would recommended a multitude of other steakhouses in Las Vegas that are more reasonably priced, better service, and taste a heck of a lot better.",XEp4e9b-dTkl-Iu6YTqE2A,8,0,1,hYmxUWHcWwogNGlMYHKIaQ

I ate here twice last year, as a guest of the management of the casino.  Both times were great.  I ate steak (obviously) both times; once the $52 bone-in rib steak and the other time the $56 lamb chops.  Very delicious, as was the sides.  This establishment is very nice and the food and booze and wines are great, but pretty expensive.  Well, not ungodly expensive, but pretty darn expensive if you ask me.  My scotch costs like $25 a shot, and my wine was like $350 for the bottle (retail price is $149).  So in conclusion, if you want a very nice place and a very good meal, you won't be disappointed by going here, but just remember that it is a pretty pricey place.",v2WrKPkRI1TikXDKAi8VFw,0,0,4,IhKUWwWhISwFsv4LsvuaNg

To start, they brought out a bread basket that was to die for. Hands down the best bread basket you'll ever get from any restaurant. It is an assortment of breads; sourdough, pretzel, some sort of garlic and cheese chips, pumpernickel. We killed the basket, and the server offered to refill it and asked if we wanted specific kinds. 

As per usual, I got the filet mignon cooked medium. (Everything a la cart. If you want sides you order it separately.) It was done perfectly, minimal seasoning where I can still taste the meat. I hate when places over season and you just taste the salt.

Cauliflower Mushrooms - sounds random. looks like little ribbons. tastes delicious!

Macaroni and Cheese - to die for. large noodles. 4-5 cheeses. sinful.

Lump Meat Crab Cocktail (this was on 2nd night) - fresh. generous portion. yummy.

Petite Filet Mignon - more than enough for this girl - especially in accompaniment with all the sides. plus i added real horseradish. spicy. tender. tasty.

the sad thing ... we never got to taste the desert - we were so full come desert time we just couldn't do it to ourselves - our thighs - our bellies ... : (

The menu isn't as extravagant, and they don't have the dozens of the over-the-top pricey items that Alexanders has (thank goodness), but if you are going to go drop less than $300 on dinner and drinks for a couple, it shows very well against the highest end steakhouses.  While the prices are dear, they are a value compared to some of its Michelin rated peer steakhouses (ala Alexanders).",IPFQA_6En6T8DE1-pCaPRA,3,3,5,7EFoEa8jDWVUMxB2vQJnQQ

was out in this part of las vegas and decided to chance it. i was blown away how nice the red rocks casino was - super nice but yet approachable. 

t-bones is super nice and gorgeous but not pretentious. 

i got the 22oz ribeye and it was DELICIOUS - cooked perfectly and very flavorful

the tator tots - just get them. dont ask questions. they are hand made fyi

the cream spinach was on point

the tuna appetizer was amazing. i could eat a few servings of that alone for lunch

pretzel bread and lavache in particular were my favorites out of the bread basket. the pretzel bread might be the best ive ever had - not super dry or plastic texture.

fried oreo - this was probably the best fried item ive had in a long time. it was NOT super greasy and yet it was thoroughly cooked through. i did order a second scoop of vanilla ice cream because they give you so much. id love to try fried snickers next time.

staff was amazing and attentive to detail.

i can see why the property is expanding and why locals flock to this place and want to avoid the traffic jams and tourists.

After tonight, I will never eat at T-Bones again. We arrived at 730 for our reservation and the hostess seated us within 5 minutes.  We brought a bottle of Sea Smoke Pinot Noir as it is one of my favorite wines. After being seated the waiter asked if we would like to open our wine, we excitedly said yes! A few moments later the ""wine expert"" came over and said we were not allowed to open our bottle since they had it on their wine list. I was completely shocked as I called before and the operator said the corkage fee was $35 with no other stipulations. Additionally, their website does not offer their wine list to look over or indicate this was not allowed. After a few moments, I went to the ""wine expert"" and said what a ridiculous situation this was and he didn't care. He would not allow us to open our wine at the restaurant since they had it on their wine list. I was willing to spend upwards of $300-$400 on dinner alone but they would not let me open my wine. We sat at our table for a few moments and ultimately decided to take our business elsewhere. The way I was treated was absolutely pathetic and I will never be subject to that service again. I am really disappointed since I really like many aspects of the restaurant. Every restaurant I have been to in town allows a corkage fee(including T-Bones), only T-Bones restricts it to wines not on their wine list. Funny since T-Bones claims to have a 7500 bottles in their cellar. From a Casino that ""Loves their Locals"", I find this an opposing view. 

On the contrary, we took our business to Flemings on Charleston and received exceptional food and service. I appreciate their willingness to charge us a corkage fee of $20 for our bottle of wine. Thank you Flemings for your great food and service

3063517,2011-07-20,1,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"T-bones is one of the many steak house that Station Casino has to offer. I would probably have to rank this up there with the best. 

Located at Red Rock Station Casinos off Charleston and 215. It may be a long drive but well worth the view. Red Rock itself is a very nice place, but focusing on T-bones, the restaurant is amazing on its own. The place was very roomy and very well decorated. Got lots of room to move around, and nice seating arrangements. Not to crowded is how I like it. 

Arriving to T-bones, we're greeted by the receptionist who checked us in and our Host Dave was nice enough to direct us to our booth. He helped us be seated. He was very informative and entertaining as well. A few seconds later we were greeted by Ricardo, who offered to get us some drinks. Shortly afterward we were greeted by Darlene, who took our order. They were all very informative and entertaining as well. This being our first time at the restaurant, Darlene gave us a lot of inside scoop on what they have regarding the view of the pool, to what they do at catering parties and holidays. Over all, the staff was very excellent on helping us out. One thing that did get to me is the refills on drinks, was a bit on the slow side. Then again, I understand it was beginning of the dinner rush, so they got busy in the end of our visit. 

The food itself, was amazing. The wife and I got Fillet Mignon, she got the 8 ounce and I got the 12 ounce, both medium.  We also got the shrimp for starters, then sweet potato fries and macaroni for our sides.  The presentation was very well done, and taste was really great.  The Fillet Mignon itself was very well cooked just the way I like it.  I understand others may not get their food prepared the way they want. But I for one, like the way it was cooked and presented.  

Dessert, I had the Fried Oreo, which was very good and tasty.  It had ice cream on the side, so it made it more wonderful to eat.  The wife had a banana split, and to be honest, its like any other banana split out there, but very good.  

Over all, I really did enjoy myself and highly recommended when looking for a steakhouse.  The pricing might be up there, I would probably say 60-80 bucks per person.  But I believe its well worth it.  The view of the restaurant, and Red Rock itself.  With the informative waiters and the energy they bring.  To the presentation of your food and the quality of it.

3066221,2010-02-19,0,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"Beautiful interior design.  Loved the big fireplace and really appreciated the ambiance.  Classy and contemporary; not overly stuffy.

The bread basket was fantastic, especially the olive bread.  The salad I had -- I think it was the California? -- not so fantastic.  Very bland, and kind of limp greens; not fresh enough. I'm not sure if it was romaine or iceberg lettuce, but it wasn't very good. The lump meat crab cocktail was decent.

My dinner party shared several sides, the most notable being the scalloped potatoes and the creamed corn.  The tomatoes with spinach and cheese were not as good as I'd hoped ... heavy and, again, lacking in freshness.

My entree, the Dover Sole, was mediocre.  Not terrible, but not nearly as flavorful as I was hoping it would be, especially for the price. I almost never eat beef, but someone else in my party had the rib-eye steak, so I tried a bite and I have to say ... it was pretty incredible.  The portion sizes were ridiculously large.  Each entree could have easily been split among three people, they were such huge chunks of meat.

For dessert, our party of six split the brownie sundae and the deep-fried oreos.  The oreos were nothing like what I expected ... they tasted quite good, but I could only take one bite before feeling overwhelmed.  The sundae was nothing special.

The prices were steep, not getting a break for being off the strip, 24oz bone in dry aged prime ribeye for 52 bucks, expected I guess.  They marinate this steak in a cilantro garlic sauce and I usually don't like good steaks marinated but it was awesome and was perfectly mild compared to the beef flavor.  It was thick and cooked perfect, juicy, extra tender, and seasoned perfect.  My girlfriend got the waygu (american kobe) skirts steak and we loved it, maybe more than my ribeye, strong delicious beef flavor and super tender for 39, a little small portion size but perfect for her.  The sides (mac and cheese, chopped salad, lobster bisque) where all real good and real rich, maybe too rich, maybe? Even the chopped salad felt real unhealthy but was delicious.  The bread selection was awesome and served hot, so overall the food was great.

The bad was our service was below average, kind of bad even and the corkage fee was 35 bucks, ouch.

It's also about the service which is most excellent. I like feeling like I'm spoiled or like I'm royalty. It was like the servers could read my mind because I didn't have to ask for things - they just anticipated my wants and or needs and presented them as options and let me choose.

However that is not the reason for this bad review. The most concerning thing is that both myself and my buddy that was at the bar with me had the same issue within 5 minutes of each other closing out the tab. That problem being them double dropping the check. We had purchased 4 drinks and closed the tab out. Then I Ordered two appetizers and the girl at the counter pushes me a check for 108 bucks!!!! I guess she thought I was intoxicated bc when I confronted her she said, ow I thought you wanted one more drink? What ok even if that's your back story why is it 80 bucks worth of stuff on my tab??? Finally she gives me another bill for 28 bucks. And says ow the first amount was never charged to your card. I look at my credit card history and indeed there is a charge of 108 plus the 28 bucks. So now I have been charged 136 bucks for two sub par apps. What really you guys are stealing from customers now???? I will be disputing this charge and attempting to reach the manager whom was suppose to have handled this when I spotted the issue.

Our server David and his associates provided top notch service. They were available at the appropriate time. David was also very knowledgeable of the menu and provided information to help make a decision.

The starter was a beautiful order of Big Eye Tuna Poke with Avocado, Wakame, Wasabi and Wonton Crisps. This order was large enough for two. The tuna was a picture perfect presentation that was almost to good to eat. 

 Our first entree was a Grass Fed 11 oz Bison Filet prepared medium rare. This was an outstanding piece of meat, tender, juicy and extremely lean. The side was an order of  grilled Asparagus in extra virgin olive oil. The asparagus spears were large and perfectly grilled. 
  
Second entree Buttermilk Fried Chicken  Breasts, with Sage Gravy. Two large breasts with a crispy breading and moist juicy white meat. More than enough for a second meal. As a side it was all about the Mashed Potatoes with Roasted Garlic.

Service was top notch. One of the members of our party is partially paralyzed. The server, with out being asked,  brought out all of his food cut into bite size pieces. That was great and very intuitive.",4KsB4PgdX_rWLQNGOrdh4Q,5,2,4,W95dXE-YcaxzM5-DOfjxxQ

Appetizers were all awesome, TONS of side item choices (all of which were great), and entrees were incredible.  And our wine selection - a dry Australian cabernet around $130 - was perfect.  
We had 2-3 very attentive waiters, and the sommelier also helped with the wine selection.  I'm not sure if we were the exception to the rule, or if the other yelpers happened to go on off nights, but our service was fantastic.
Downsides would be - the prime rib was ridicously large (think John Candy in The Great Outdoors trying to eat that whole steak); and of course it's not cheap.  But if you're looking to splurge at a steakhouse, I'd recommend this, right in line with Strip Steak and craftsteak.

The service at this restaurant was very good. Diane did a great job as did the busboy (?); both were very knowledgeable on the items and we didn't feel rushed.  The bread was also very good and we'll stop there.

The tomato soup was very acidic, and could have used some more cream, salt or perhaps should just scrap that recipe altogether.  The cauliflower mushrooms in brown butter were greasy/oily, and very unappetizing.  Diane was gracious enough to scratch those items off the bill and brought my wife a bowl of french onion which tasted much better albeit nothing extraordinary.

My wife ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the T-bone.  Both cuts were cooked as ordered, although both were dry and unmemorable. The sauces were probably intended to add flavor to a flavorless meat and we didn't care for any of them. For nearly 50 dollars a piece, we expected something divine, but I've picked up better stuff at my local Safeway.  If I had paid 25 dollars, our leftovers would have gone in the trash, but I managed to get a couple of burritos out of them.  

For as much as this restaurant charges (our bill came to over 200 dollars), I would give this 1 star, but the service was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice.

3517633,2010-12-30,1,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"Surprisingly good. Like my visit to Twin Creeks at the Silverton a couple weeks ago, T-Bones is a steakhouse I never thought much about, but was glad I tried. The look of the place is impressive. It's got an upscale, modern feel with some comfy looking booths and a large fireplace in the center of the dining area. 

To start, we got the crab cakes ($18). The waiter said the crabs were from the Philippines. ""I've never had Filipino crabs before,"" I replied. My wife snickered and said, ""I hope not."" The humor was lost on our waiter.

The order came with two sizeable crab cakes. They had little filler and large chunks of crab meat. Although the crab meat looked darker than your typical Maryland crab meat and wasn't as sweet.

Next up was an order of the Tbones Steakhouse salad ($12). It was a large serving that they split for us at the table. It was one of the better salads I've had in a while, with it's chopped lettuce, tomatoes, bleu cheese dressing and chunks of bacon. You can never go wrong with bacon.

For our entree we split the 12 oz. filet ($48). Again, they split it for us tableside. It was a delicious cut of beef that was lightly seasoned. At other places (like Cut or Delmonico) they season their steaks so much that the flavor is like getting a swift hard kick in the ass. That can be a god thing if you like bold flavors (I do). Here, the flavor is like a gentle tapping on the shoulder to get your attention. 

The waiter brought out complimentary sauces for the steak -- bleu cheese and a bearnaise. I didn't care much for the bearnaise, but the bleu cheese had a sharp and tangy flavor to it that went well with the beef. I don't normally like sauces with my steak, but this was a nice change of pace.

We also ordered two sides -- the garlic mashed potatoes ($10) and the royal trumpet mushrooms ($12). Each was a substantial amount, good enough for a party of four to share. The mashed potatoes were decent but forgettable. The mushrooms were served in a sauce that had the consistency of gray. It smelled amazing and tasted pretty good.

Their dessert menu looked good but we didn't have any room left to eat more. We even had plenty of leftovers to take home.

The service was solid throughout the night. Our main waiter seemed very busy with all of his other tables, but there were other waiters who stopped by to check in and take additional drink orders.

With drinks, our bill (before tip) came out to $153.50. Not a cheap meal, but cheaper than many options on the strip and the quality was very good. It's definitely worth a return visit.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,5,4,bvtBYwOLdKkDQ9TS-t7gvg

Prior service experiences have been better.  The food is awesome. No complaints. The sea bass, filets, crab cakes, and scallops were all excellent.  Upon leaving we realized that we did not give the waiter our players club card.  We returned with 10 minutes to get our credit.  Without our receipt and since the bill was ""closed out"" they said ""can't help you"".  Wrong answer. Upon further conversation they still refused to make this right.  They must be the only steak house in town. Lame.  Lost a customer over not doing the right thing.  May I recommend Flemings, Andiron in DT Summerlin, or Echo & Rigs in Tivoli for a more pleasant experience.  Staffs are accommodating and actually more than willing to do the right thing.

For appetizers, my wife tried the Big Eye Tuna Poke and I had the fresh oysters.  The tuna poke was delicious with very fresh tuna and wonderful flavors. The fresh oysters were particularly good, some of the freshest oysters I've had in a while in Las Vegas. 

Next we ordered the grass fed filet mignon for my wife and the aged prime NY strip for me. Again, both were delicious steaks, seared perfectly with a nice crust and cooked exactly to our specifications.  We also had grilled asparagus and potatoes au gratin for sides.

3766234,2017-01-03,0,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"I can't imagine why this place has so many positive reviews. It's a steakhouse that serves subpar steak. My only guess is that in the immediate area (Red Rock Casino) there aren't a ton of choices and it's the only high-end restaurant in that immediate area. 

The service: if there's such a thing as being ""overly"" serviced, this place would be it. The waitstaff tag-teams the tables. This means we had a waiter/waitress team. Good right? Wrong. This just meant we were bugged every five minutes for the same things. Yes, our wine is fine. Seriously, it's fine. We already indicated what kind of water we wanted (and they got it wrong since the first person to ask forgot what we said) when the second person asked. No, we don't want dessert. We've already said that. It was seriously annoying after a while. If the team is going to tag-team, they should communicate.

We asked the waitress if there was anything off-menu and she said ""no"". After we placed our order, we noticed a card on the table. We turned it around and there was a winter special - off-menu. Serious fail. 

We both had the french onion soup (very good, the only good part of the meal). I had the grass-fed petite filet and my husband had a bone-in Kansas strip steak. My filet was so over-salted that it tasted like a salt lick and I couldn't finish it (it was 8 ounces, small enough to finish). It had a very hard crust. My husband's steak was very fatty with not much meat. 

The atmosphere is very loud (particularly with poor live music going on through the dining room). When the music started the talking got louder. The fireplace in the middle of the room added some nice ambiance but the loudness due to the music/competing talking was off-putting. Don't be fooled by what yelp says - it says this place is dressy but everyone was in jeans. Not a problem for us but if you decide to go (and I wouldn't), don't get dressed up for the occasion.

I tend to not think of price when dining out. It is secondary. However, the money you spend for a meal was not worth it at all and you'll leave dissatisfied. Our meal came to $200 for subpar quality and not a very enjoyable experience. We won't be back.",uyEP-FWcaS0sHQJ0-80QyQ,3,0,2,ewzSWIH2z_uYOzQvliRhgw

As I live close by, I decided to try one more time to see which experience was the accurate representation.  Unfortunately, my LAST experience there matched my second and I really took notice this time of how frazzled the service staff was as a result of the kitchen's poor coordination.  

As my wife and I sat at the bar for over a half hour later than our original reservation time, we engaged in conversation with others dining at the bar; I've never seen so many people send back cold food.

Our cocktails were shaken up just right. We sat at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the bartender. Then off to our table we went. We ordered a steak and seafood that were equally amazing. We shared so we both were able to enjoy a variety in our meals.

I love this area in general because it does not have that cheesy Las Vegas over the top feeling.

To be honest, T-Bones can get expensive.  It's priced like a steakhouse on the strip, so the huge ribeye I had tonight was $52.  BUT if you keep your eyes out, there's often deals for locals.  Awhile back Red Rock had a web site that gave me 50% my meals at various points.  Tonight I used a $25 off $50 coupon they had sent me in the mail.  So my $52 ribeye was only $27, which is much more reasonable.

Tonight I sat at the bar and chatted with the beautiful and friendly bar staff.  Almost every woman working in T-Bones is easy on the eyes.  Great service on top, of course.  I'll continue to come back as long as T-Bones keeps sending out deals.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,6,1,5,CbPAq9RMoEgMOqwQ2-lnHA

French onion soup
Shrimp tempura
Crab cake
Perfect poutine
Steakhouse salad
Buttemilk fried chicken
New York steak Supreme Oscar
Hash brown
AuGratin potatoes
Mushrooms
Cream corn
Chocolate soufflé
Cheesecake
Carrot cake

All items were shared except for the onion soup.  Another one was prepared because of the difficulty in sharing soup.  The bread basket had a good selection of different breads. Standouts for me were the shrimp tempura, New York steak Supreme Oscar, and buttermilk fried chicken.  Fried chicken is probably one of the three things I would never order eating out.  I was surprised by how good this fried chicken was.  It had a crispy fried skin and it was juicy inside.  The New York steak Oscar was served with an excellent béarnaise sauce with lobster and asparagus pieces.  It was delightful.  The shrimp tempura is a great dish for any table to share.  The pieces of fried shrimp was accompnaied by spicy yuzu mayo.  Finally, the perfect poutine consisted of French fries with duck confit gravy, crispy duck skin, and Maytag blue cheese.  It was very good.

We moved to the patio for dessert and I got to try only three of them as I had to leave to get to UNLV for a play.  The cheesecake was outstanding!  The chocolate soufflé was well executed and the carrot cake was delicious.

I still wish there was a curtain separating this elegant dinging space from the TVs at the bar/lounge area.  At the beginning of our meal, there was a fair amount of casino music that permeated the space.  Later, this was changed to in house music and the casino sound ebbed.

Tonight I returned again for dinner because I was craving steak. I got there around 6:50pm on Sunday night and I was pretty excited since I made it for T-Bone Social Hour. 

Sit at the bar area, Our server which I assumed her name was Shaheena. (Reading off my receipt) I think she might be new to the team which I was guessing from her customer engaged style. 

Service was prompt but nothing to write home about. There are no up selling or suggested anything special as a side for my steak. I ordered 22oz Bone in Ribeye and Beef Carpaccio. I guess because when you sit at the bar all bartenders more used to just serve drinks more than food. I could be wrong. Maybe it was simply just Sunday and everyone just tired. 

Waiting time was very short and satisfying. 
When my food arrived, two gentlemen was kindly explained about their sauce which came with my steak. They were polite and professional. 

At one point my glass of water left empty for about 4 minutes 10 second which should not be since I was sitting right there at the bar and at least three sexy bartenders roaming around in the bar area. 

One thing I notice about all pretty staffs. I feel their might not be comfortable with their sexy style top because all of them kept adjusting to prevent the ""slip"" incident. 

Food was good. At least one thing Impressed me was my server had mentioned if I would like my steak precut and that was awesome!!

Four of us started off w/ a small seafood tray ($75 | large shrimp, lump crab meat, oysters, half lobster & king crab) and a Jordan cab ($119).  First of all, the seafood tower was very good.  One of my co-workers doesn't eat much seafood, so the size was perfect.  The lobster tail was surprisingly large, as were the shrimp.  We barely finished it.  The only room for improvement would have been a different serving tray to showcase the seafood better, and some drawn butter:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the cab was excellent.  Jordan comes from the Alexander Valley in Napa and goes well w/ bold seafood and steaks:  5 Stars.

For our seconds, three of us ordered wedge salads ($12), while I had a caesar salad w/ anchovies ($12 - only the latter is pictured).  The wedge salads looked really good w/ blue cheese & bacon.  Unfortunately, the caesar was not as good bc it lacked flavor in the dressing, and the anchovies were not salty:  2 Stars.

For our mains, two ordered petite filets ($43), one ordered a 16 oz NY ($49), and I had a large filet ($48).  My steak was aged well, but could have benefited from more seasoning or butter.  Nonetheless, it was medium rare as requested and tender:  4 Stars.

For our sides, we ordered grilled asparagus ($12), cauliflower ($10), and mashed potatoes ($10 - sorry, no pics).  None of the sides really stood out, and the portions were small:  3 Stars.

Regarding the ambiance, its very fancy in here.  There is an awesome bar behind the hostess station when you enter.  In addition, there is a fire pit encased in glass in the center of the restaurant.  However, a big downside was a couple of large groups thought they owned the place, and were yelling and talking too loudly.  Most nice steakhouses have private rooms for this purpose:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the service from Michael and his team were excellent.  They were super nice and attentive.  We didn't have to ask for anything additional:  5 Stars.

All in all, a very good experience.  However, T-Bones pales in comparison to Joe's Seafood in Caesar's Palace IMHO.  The latter executes on all fronts, has better tasting steaks, and does not have boorish customers.",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,43,38,4,3HIctrhRXzVUx8mQEEziJg

4090539,2011-07-14,0,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"Thanks to a Yelp Elite event my husband won a 100 dollar comp here, otherwise we probably could not afford to eat here without celebrating something.  We have been to a few Station Casino steakhouses and this one most certainly has that Station feel to it.  The menus are pretty much the same throughout the Stations family with slight variations in appetizers, sides and desserts. 

We started off with the typical bread basket, and by far the pretzel bread was the best.  It didn't have that funky after taste to it like I had expected and I'm glad I gave it a shot.  It was the only appetizer that I had.  My husband on the other hand ate an entire plate of rock shrimp tempura.  It looked really good and I had to restrain myself from eating it and remind myself it was indeed seafood and seafood is poison.  By the way, if you are a seafood hater like me and are not craving a salad or soup you are pretty much SOL for appetizers here.  

My hubby and I both had the filet mignon, shared a basket of sweet potato fries and the macaroni and cheese.  The mac and cheese was cute with little twister shaped pasta, but it tasted a little off.  The sweet potato fries were good and came in another twister shaped bucket with a fake newsprint wrap.  We ended with deep fried Oreos and a traditional banana split.  The Oreos were truly awful and the banana split was good, but big enough for two.  The best part was the vanilla ice cream.   Nothing stood out as spectacular, but it was a decent meal.

Service started off beautifully with introductions, recommendations, and explanations.  The staff was amazing, we got checked on by servers, bussers, management, I think the general manager even stopped by for a moment.  The table was swept up quickly and the first round of drinks were prompt.  My only complaint, can a girl get a refill?  The answer is apparently, no.

My wife and I wanted a special dinner to celebrate the new year so we chose T-Bones as we were staying at the Red Rock Hotel where T-Bones is located. 

The service was top notch and everyone was very friendly. We ordered drinks from the bar and they were promptly brought to us. Silvia, our server, was great and helped us choose our steaks. My wife got the 8 oz filet and for me the Bone-in Ribeye. 

The steaks, to be honest, were good but not the best we have had. I know that they are thick steaks but both of our steaks were a bit over cooked. Not to much but noticeable, not being picky we ate them just fine. Like I said they were good but flavor wise we have had better at the likes of Ruth's Chris and Hugo's Cellar.

The asparagus that we got was cooked great, but was luke warm. Still good though. The mashed potatoes were fantastic. 

We ended with some DELICIOUS fried oreo's. No seriously they were awesome and I highly recommend them.

In all it was a very nice night. But when I review a place value is at or near the top of my criteria and that is were T-bones falls a bit short for me.

It's really close to our house but unfortunately the food is just ok, and especially with the price, not really worth the time or expense.

We wanted to try the tomahawk - 32oz for $120. They took our order and 15 minutes later can to tell us they were out. We would have left if it had been earlier - but what type of steak restaurant doesn't have rib eye which is what the tomahawk is with a bone.

We did tell them they over cooked it, and the server checked the meat with a flashlight and offered something else but we declined. We were done and we didn't ask for any discount etc. we just knew we weren't going back. 
The steakhouse salad for $12 was big enough to split and it was good. They have a good breadbasket. And at the end they give you tiny chocolates and key lime tarts.

My husband and I came here on a Saturday with last minute reservations for 6:30PM and were pleasantly surprised that we got in.

The place was not that busy, but there was a party bring hosted at the end of the bar with live entertainment.

As soon as we sat down we were greeted by our super professional, friendly and knowledgeable waiter who made a few food suggestions.

After a few short minutes my husband and I knew what we wanted. I opted for their 8oz filet mignon and kale walnut salad and my husband ordered a strip steak and sautéed mushrooms.

The food came out faster than what we expected and it all tasted delicious. It was all cooked the way we had asked and the service was great. 

My filet was cooked almost well and was one of the most tender pieces of mignon I've ever had and my husbands steak was done medium rare and he enjoyed it very much. 

To finish our meal my husband and I decided to order some desert and coffee and let me tell you that we were not disappointed! The coffee tasted amazing! It was very fresh and bold yet smooth and and our trio of ice creams tasted out of this world delicious. 

Our whole evening was very pleasant and I would definitely come here again. The only thing that prevents me from giving T Bones 5 stars is that the echo from the live entertainment was so loud that it was hard to carry on a conversation. 

Other than that it was a very enjoyable tastetastic evening!

My husband goes to order the most expensive steak on the menu and it is not available. And then the Walk Around Bread Boy? Kind of weird that you spend high price and they cant even give u a sample basket of each bread he is offering. You have to choose one!! The final straw was the waiter . He would speak to you normally but to his staff he acted like kermit the frog. 

The food ended up being decent 7/10 . Lobster was not as juicy or large as i would have expected for $72. The 22 oz ribeye was not bad seasoned as a prime rib. I could not tell the difference between that and a prime rib cut. Mac and cheese was very tasteful although presented as a small bowl of big noodles. The bone marrow was good but was very small . The waiter made it seem like the bone marrow was going to be a normal size portion. But they brought out a quarter of a normal portion.

4333083,2016-10-16,1,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"I was pretty surprised about this place.

I don't expect your average casino steakhouse to be excellent, but it really should be better than this.

I could go on and on about the issues, but let's just go with the fact that three of us ordered the wildly overpriced sole meuniere ($68).

Huge portion (not normally a bad thing, and definitely typical for Vegas, but a good sole meuniere is thin enough so that it gets crispy around the edges) that was way too thick to cook evenly. Solution? Overcook it! Done.

But, serve it lukewarm for some reason. Why? Dunno.

I'll basically leave it there except some quick notes: brussels sprouts were dry and terrible, salads were pointless, and all the steaks on the table were consumed about 30% since they were just not that good.

On the plus side, the asparagus was actually quite good. And the horseradish that came with the oysters was insanely sharp, which was fun. Oysters were flavorless, but fine. I did ask what type of oysters they were, and the answer? ""West Coast."" Thanks.",6vAk9q9th4mLOfhZGvWqMA,1,0,2,byjD43dc67ywR7r8t20pcw

It's a great hangout for locals that take advantage of their happy hour specials (which are quite special), however, visitors might find it overly expensive and not focus on the total experience. 

I came here to celebrate my birthday on the 16th , the hostess was quite accommodating and offered us a choice of tables. I was very hungry and parched (it got hot quick in Vegas),so we quickly sat near the entrance of the restaurant.

The atmosphere is upbeat , we had live music being played a musician on the piano. He was actually so good I thought we were listing to some sort of radio. 

The architecture is very modern and clean.Lots of red with dark accents. I saw a previous review mention the large windows in the elevated dining area, the windows are the strangest feature because yes you can see through them to the bar which has TV's and it is distracting. 

But TV's are nice if you just want to hang out at the bar. I'm not sure if drapes are the solution, maybe electro-chromatic windows that can be turned on and off depending on which part of the day your in??  I Digress...

Their service is impeccable and we were served by Rick. We quickly ordered drinks and our courses. 

Apps: Caesar Salad. Ground anchoive, fresh CRISP romain, fresh parmesan, the dressing had a bit of a kick to it but it was a refreshing kick. 

Main Course: T-Bones is always willing to go the extra mile. We ordered a large fillet and some King Crabbie Legs, Rick was kind enough to split it table side.

The Desert: Chessecake from Heaven. This cheesecake is so good,  my Yelp Profile image is now of me eating it. The cheesecake was fluffy and more cake-like cheese, but still had all that amazing sweetness. The crust was extra-thick grahm cracker.....soooo goood.  

I will definitely be coming back, I tell my self I need to come in more often every time I am there.

4484751,2015-06-19,7,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"T-Bones is a beautiful place and elegant place.  I was thrilled to be invited to dinner there, since I'd never been.  

First, the good:  the bread might be up there with the best bread I've had in Vegas in the 10+ years I've been here.  Maybe it's an East Coast thing, but I like bread with a crunchy crust, and this had it in spades.

From the beginning to the end:  the crème brûlée was outstanding.

But man (or woman, in this case) cannot live by bread and dessert alone, though I wish I could.  I would have been content with both of those.  

My appetite was whetted by the beautiful, jumbo shrimp sitting atop ice in a huge bowl brought to our table.  While they looked great, nothing about their taste was remarkable.  They were just THERE.  And as soon as the shrimp were whisked away, the waiters started to remove the bread basket and bread plates of all the others at my table.  I caught them in time; when there's good bread I save a bite for the end of my meal.  Did I play hooky from etiquette class the day they taught this topic?

A very ordinary Caesar's salad was followed by what should have been the raison d'être of a steak joint:  the steak.  Mine was a petite filet.  It looked like it was cooked just the way I liked it, i.e., medium rare.  Somehow it didn't taste that way.  Actually, it didn't taste like much of anything.  I'm not a huge steak aficionado to begin with, and this one didn't do anything to change my mind.  If I had paid the menu price of $43, I sure would have been ticked.  The green beans were just about raw.  Lots of folks like 'em that way.  I am not one of them.  The mashed potatoes were eminently skippable.  

My husband had the salmon, which came out as a thick slab.  It wasn't as rare as it should be, but he likes it well done, so he had no complaints about that.  But it, too, wasn't flavorful, unless you count the excessive amount of salt on the top, almost a salt crust.  Ix-nay on the salmon, too.  We've had great salmon, and this wasn't it.

It is an upscale dining establishment with cloth napkins and table cloths, but you can dress casually if you choose to do so. They have an elegant dining area and a nice selection of wines to choose from. As expected from a high end steak house it is fairly expensive. The service is excellent. The entire staff is extremely welcoming and friendly from the time you walk through the door until the time you leave.

They offer a nice selection of different cuts of meat. The only thing I was disappointed with was only the filet was grass fed. All of the other cuts of meat were just prime cuts that are dry aged. I felt that they should offer more of a selection of grass fed beef for the prices they charge.

All of the menu items are ala carte. I had the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye (rare) for $58, Big-eye Tuna Poke, Kale Salad, and the Grilled Tomatoes.

The 22 ounce bone-in ribeye was supposed to be cooked rare. It was a little over cooked. It was more medium-rare than rare. The steak had excellent flavor and had consistent marbling through out the steak. It was definitely an excellent cut of beef. I would say that it was an excellent steak, even though I would have preferred it to be grass fed.

The Big-eye Tuna Poke appetizer was outstanding. The tuna was very fresh. The poke was set over avocado and seaweed. It was drizzled with  sweet soy reduction that was also outstanding.

The Kale Salad had some crunchy kale chips mixed in the salad with walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. This was an excellent choice from the salad menu. The salad had great flavor.

The side of grilled tomatoes with spinach was pretty good. I think the tomatoes could have been grilled longer, unless they were just put in the oven then that would explain why they did not look grilled.

As bonus, the cocktail waitresses and female bartenders in their slinky black dresses and high heels are drop dead gorgeous.  There were also 4-6 suits milling about whose function I never figured out so they must be management.  

We started off with drinks; Ann chose Peaches (4.5 Sips out of a possible 5) (absolute peach vodka, Pama Pomegranate liqueur, elderflower syrup, fresh peaches, Rock Candy syrup, fresh line and a sugar rim) while I chose the Blue Mojito Devil (4 Sips) (Bacardi Razz, Hiram Walker blue Curacao, fresh blueberries and fresh mint topped with club soda).  We than shared the TBones Steakhouse salad; a large portion of romaine lettuce, bacon, avocado, gorgonzola cheese, tomatoes and white French dressing.  (3.5 Forks)

Our third order included a glass of Rodney Strong merlot and Chicken Pot Pie for Ann while I chose The Cocktail You Gave Me Last Time; Montecristo 12 year rum infused with fresh pineapples, vanilla beans, cinnamon, pineapple juice and brown sugar topping (3.5 Sips) and Beef on Weck; a healthy heap of prime rib sliced thin on a roll served with French Fries, au jus and 3 horseradish sauces (3.5 Forks).

So, being a steak lover, I wanted to check this restaurant out.  We didn't realize it was so upscale (the casino is very casual) and were out shopping nearby, so it was a last minute idea to eat there.  We walked in just after 5pm on Sat, only a couple of table were occupied, so not having a reservation didn't seem to be an issue and we were seated right away.  The waiter explained the menu well and took our orders.  While waiting for our appetizers and bread to be served, the hostess seated a party of four right next to us (in what was basically an empty restaurant) -- the people had a small DOG with them.  I immediately looked at the hostess and said this would be a problem for me, and one of the 4 people quickly said ""it's a service dog"" (looked like a household pet to me).  I got up and said to my girlfriend, their table and the hostess ""We'll go to another restaurant"" -- no attempt was made to have us stay.  I've been eating in these types of restaurants for decades and never had dinner sitting next to a dog before anywhere (even at fast food places), it's too bad because I was hoping for a great, memorable meal -- of course at $80 a person, it should be great.",3CJUJILq7CLHk_9OrvpvQg,0,0,1,19bBiBOOKITKjVmDOWuVgQ

4926420,2013-02-18,0,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"My best friend and I went here for an impromptu birthday dinner after we spent the day at the spa.  It wasn't packed, but it looked fairly busy.  I like the decor of the restaurant.  It's very warm and inviting.  But speaking of warm!  They sat us at a table by the long fireplace in the middle of the restaurant and it was overly warm!  I was sitting on the other side of the table and had to strip down to a tank top.  We should have asked to be moved right away but it seemed bearable at first.  However, by the time we were done with dinner, we were both roasting.

First off, the service is super slow.  They are really nice and friendly, but just so SLOW!  It took forever for someone to take our order.  We both ordered lobster chowder to start with.  I felt it was pretty bland.  There was a lot of corn and potatoes and about 2 small pieces of lobster.  I was not impressed.  After that, it was probably about 30 minutes from after they cleared our lobster chowder plates before they started bringing out our dinner.  We ordered the chateaubriand, which they slice tableside.  We asked for medium rare but it was definitely more rare, which I was okay with but my friend wanted it just a tadbit closer to medium rare.  They gave me my part since I was okay with rare, and they took her pieces back to throw back on for a little bit.  We also ordered the hashbrowns, which came with a sunny-side up egg on top.  The Chateaubriand comes with potatoes and vegetables.  We waited a good 5 minutes before they came back with her steak, and when they did, it was completely overcooked, almost to medium well.  Since we had already waited so long for our food and didn't want to be big complainers, we just said it was fine.  What a massive disappointment.  By the time they brought her steak back, everything on our table had gone cold.  

The overall experience was just okay.  I really think that if they hadn't been SOOOO slow with the service, this might have been a 4-star experience.  The other thing that really sucked was our $99 chateaubriand being cooked at the wrong temp, TWICE.

dinner reservations made at t-bones...only for the sake of convenience of our evening, otherwise we would have wanted anywhere else. 
after many many stays at RR prior to moving out here (maybe 15-20 nights in the last year), we have never ever once felt the need to investigate t-bones....the restaurants at RR leave much to be desired in general and very tired of being very disappointed with very very expensive meals in this town. 
but, keeping it to the point, sad that many poor executions were experienced by yelpers.... and our evening though expensive and not mind-blowing was enjoyable enough for a special celebratory evening. 
to start - three tiny 1/2 quails - fried chicken style sufficiently seasoned and   karaage crunchy...and well....adorable. Out of buffala mozz for the the caprese last night, this was re-imagined with heirloom tomatoes and whipped ricotta - perhaps was a better version than the standard on the printed menu. 
T-bone for 2... i mean let's order what they *should* do best..after wretched carniveno experiences we ordered ""medium plus"".. this arrived perfect for us both to be happy. seasonal cauldron of vegg accompanied the t-bone for 2, though all very standard and okay - only the quartered roasted potatoes really stood out -- creamy like mashed on the inside and crispy roasted outside. 
Sauteed spinach -- perfectly done, and still slightly under - love it! 
mac&cheese -- good. it was good and no complaints which actually says a lot. 
between the better than bread basket plus dessert - the celebration provided small tasting of creme brule and dipped strawberries....and double espressos of course, cause we need to be revived again....in all, it was good. 

it was a surprise that service was really attentive without being overbearing. explanations though unnecessary were provided throughout the evening, but you can tell their usual patrons have below average grasp of food knowledge. they are serving plugra on the table, nice, but it isn't like it is an actual import or find farmed locally. 

food was decent, and that seems to be a much more difficult find recently. including one of the few cheap-o bottles on the wine menu - $75 for penfolds cab; dinner for two just shy of $270 before tip...

I dined at this restaurant last night for a business outing. As a vegetarian, I was impressed with the sweet potato, grilled asparagus, and mushroom sides. My coworker ordered the halibut (the only wild caught fish on the menu, per our server), but was dismayed that it was as dry as chalk and not very flavorful. 

The service was friendly except for one bus girl. She gave our table dirty looks the whole night and was not very responsive when asked for things. As dinner wound down, she grabbed the sides of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon along with the sweet potato that were in front of me without asking if I was done and/or if I wanted them wrapped, and when I hastily said, ""Oh! Will you please wrap those for me?!"" I received yet another dirty look. When she was finished, I enjoyed the reluctant ""plop"" of the to-go containers on the ground next to me. 

She then went on to grab the asparagus and mushrooms from the table, and when I repeated my same request, she gave an indication that she understood. Unfortunately, though, even though she had said ""ok"", those dishes never did make it back to me and that food was obviously wasted.

They took the card, and then the next day when we went to check out, we saw they had made their tip on a $150 meal over $50... they had just applied the gift card to their tip. Are you kidding me? It took waayyyy too much fighting and hassle to get our $25 back. The front desk was rude, didn't believe us, etc, etc.. What a pain!

Overall there are sooo many places in Vegas to eat an average steak (like Hugo's for instance), you might as well eat at one with good service too! If you want an amazing jaw dropping steak, there are plenty of places for that as well (Craftsteak, Strip Steak, etc, etc). Why settle for an average steak in a crappy place? What's the point?",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,4,1,2,vCQnBYsp4PErP5-iPGaiiA

5279820,2016-03-19,4,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,"Toqued by Chef Mike Deas with input from Red Rock Assistant Executive Chef Joseph Kudrak, formerly from Glutton, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge is one of those places easily overlooked by Las Vegas visitors as well as locals, a recent dinner on an early Friday evening leaving one to wonder exactly why, and how to get the word out?

More tucked away than Hearthstone, Lucille's or The Buffet and Grand Café, a nearly 200 seat footprint overlooking the Red Rock pool with high ceilings, fireplaces and plenty of polish, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge both looks and feels like many On-Strip casino Steakhouses, but taking a few more risks with the menu than several the experience is presented as one also more affordable, the price-point not dissimilar to nearby Andiron, Fleming's or Morton's.

Retaining several of its well-mannered Captains from early on, the restaurant's professional-friendly service style reportedly a focus of the Fertitta family who own Station Casinos and visit often, dinner was served in a Prix-fixe fashion and with Chefs Kudrak as well as Deas present that evening the meal was nothing short of a feast for the senses, a $300 tab for sixteen appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts plus one heck of a cocktail and a bread basket that bests any seen recently on Las Vegas Boulevard.

Acknowledging a friend's two-hour time limit, tickets to the UNLV Opera requiring departure just before Seven o'clock, it was at a large semi-circular booth that the meal got started and with greetings from GM Christopher Jurchenkoit was not long before service was underway, the opening trio seeing lightly battered shrimp given a Chinatown treatment while steakhouse staples of French Onion Soup and Crabcakes were as good as any in the city, the former faintly sweet with plenty of bubbling cheese while the ""cake"" was almost pure crab with bright aromatics of paprika, onion and cayenne in the binder.

A bit off-put by the noise emanating from the bar, a combination of March Madness revelry, Friday Happy Hour and music piped in from the Gaming Floor, round two followed quickly and although fresh-cut potatoes could have been more crispy, ""Perfect Poutine"" was quite a bargain at just $10 when taking into account all the confit, cheese and skin, the Steakhouse Salad equally well constructed as chopped Romaine blended nicely with Avocado, Bacon and Gorgonzola beneath creamy French Dressing.

Not even 1/3 finished at this point, course three a six-piece exposition of two entrees and four sides, gone are the days of piddly portions at CUT or PRIME as Au Gratin Potatoes, Hashbrowns, Mushrooms and Creamed Corn are all built for sharing, as too is the two-piece Fried Chicken with Sage Gravy while the Beef selections range from American Wagyu to New York Prime from Niman Ranch, the latter in our case served Medium with a topping of fresh Lobster, Asparagus and Béarnaise.

Bathed by the setting sun with blinds offering only modest relief as a result of floor-to-ceiling windows that give the room part of its grand appeal, dessert was taken to the patio as music turned live in the Lounge and although admittedly already quite sated none of the five options proved less than worth the temptation, the Carrot Cake and Soufflé both straight forward classics alongside Cheesecake that trends far lighter than most followed by indulgent blueberry donuts and a frozen parfait plus Sticky Toffee Pudding  that falls just short of Gordon Ramsay's for best in The Valley.

**** Easily overlooked in a city where Steakhouses rule the day, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge is a great spot for those inhabiting Summerlin to grab a Cocktail or snacks at Happy Hour and an even better one for al fresco patio dining, the price point more favorable than spots on The Strip while the menu outpaces other places nearby in terms of both creativity and quality of sourcing.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,7,4,0ZmPS_AkYcwNGqedB6FTGw

Everything was ""attention"" to details.    Menu has lots of options and there are plenty of steak and non-steak choices.   The starters and sides are shareable -- entrees are individual portions.

The bread basket --- yeah --- I'll have 4 -5 of those Belgian pretzels to go please.  And the sweet dark bread -- two loafs please.  OMG good and fresh !!!!

Our glasses were never empty.      The wine list is very comprehensive --- and even though I did wine by glass (only wine drinker in group) --- their by the glass and bottle selection was very tempting.

We skipped salad but shared a couple of sides (grilled tomatoes --- were super !!!) .    We had steak (grass fed ones) and scallops --- the sauces were perfection !!!

I got a special birthday desert -- creme brûlée and dipped strawberry --- yep, melt me down....(if you read my other food reviews -- I have a thing for creme brûlée :-) )

We also got cheese cake for the rest of the table.   And later --- some hand made chocolates showed up ---- perfect ending.

Coffee was very good and fresh.   Our waiter/waitress team --- was ROCK STAR awesome !!! And thank you for making a special night --- even better !!!

At the end, the manager (Jennifer?) came by and checked on us --- and wished me happy birthday.   So attentive and on par with what type of service we expected at a good steakhouse.

Everyone was so on top of their game --- and the restaurant was elegant but not stuffy.  There is booth, table and outdoor seating.    There is a nice bar area in front --- enjoyed the views of Red Rock canyon imagery (as we had just been hiking there in the am).    I felt comfortably dressed in pant suit -- but there were jeans and long skirts / dresses as well.   Pretty easy going dress code.

For two entrees, two sides, two desserts, wine x 2 glasses, coffee x 1 --- 160.00

The host found out that another large party had held up the restaurant by staying at their table for four hours.  This was a very unprofessional excuse as they knew we had a reservation and should have set up something ahead of time.  We waited another 15-20 minutes for them to do so.  When finally seated, the wedding party was then told the restaurant was out of several menu items that were the reason the restaurant was chosen in the first place!  Talk about killing a special celebration!  And to add insult to injury, they offered nothing to make up the damage!  They in the least should have offered free cocktails!

I really like the atmosphere and style of the restaurant itself. The big fireplace on the left side makes it feel cozy, the high ceilings and their outdoor bar is the best place to have a beverage or 7 in all of Red Rock. 

I noticed a lot of complaints about the prices in other Yelp reviews. Here are some ways to keep dinner under some kind of budget: 

1. Skip the appetizers completely. Let's be honest. There's nothing you haven't had before here. Crab cakes, caprese salad, oysters, shrimp cocktail..zzzzzzzzzzzzz. And there's no way they'll do it better than your favorite place anyways. The bread is good enough here if you're starving. 

Plus you're at a freakin steakhouse for chrissakes! I for one always end up getting tons of things boxed up since the portions are so big. Why stuff yourself with pricey and meh things? 

2. Go with the Chateaubriand for $99. Its a complete dinner for 2 and it comes with a rainbow of roasted vegetables and potatoes. That means you don't need to pay for $10 side dishes. 

On a side note, it continually blows my mind how any steakhouse charges $10+ for steamed asparagus. Good god! I want them to at least work a little bit on the damn vegetable. Grill it!! Sautee it!! Show me the chef put some elbow grease into it. It's simply wrong on principle alone to spend that much on steamed anything unless it's a whole fish. 

Like any real restaurant that serves Chateaubriand, they will cook the beef tenderloin table-side, carve it and plate it in front of you. Its like the soft rock music of steak to teppenyaki's heavy metal. The presentation could also be potentially semi-impressive if you're on a first date. Just throwing that out there. 

The tenderloin itself is good enough and enjoyable. No way can it compare to some other places in town but it still makes for a nice steak dinner. 

3. You could also keep it cheap for dessert by going to the Grand Cafe or Ben and Jerry's in the food court. Neither of which we did since we were so stuffed from the entree but there's another suggestion. 

I would only come back here for a proper dinner if I had a significant discount. There are too many other cows in the sea.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,15,8,4,_8iyVT68dbiWufVyiK9byg

After our dinner our server came he asked what kind of dessert we would like I told him surprise us with the best one he recommends so he went on to get the desert and never came back to our table. Since we both have to go to work in the morning we had to ask another person to bring us our check. My friend was generous enough to give the server tip because I wouldn't. I would definitely write on the check the reason why I wasn't gonna tip.

WOW... then it was like they multiplied  at every turn. Jesus H. Christ, did they grow them specifically to do this job. OMFG, I drooled, legit drooled like I had not eaten in 5 years and someone put a piece of pie in front of me but would not let me touch it.

The service was really good to, not hostess level hot good, but our server was really on top of things and the rest of the wait staff was also very attentive.

The bread basket came first, and it was nice. My favorite was the Lavash with melted Parmesan. I started off with a French onion soup, the broth was very tasty & not too salty. However, I would've appreciated some more melted cheese around the edges. The crabcakes were phenomenal. Lots of fresh crab! Just the way it should be. I ordered hot tea, peach tranquility. The tea itself had a very good taste to it. But, for some reason it just wouldn't stay hot. It came with its own very own teapot. I did have to ask for a new cup twice. They were happy to provide for me. I got the prime rib. I asked for it to be well done & charred. It was very delicious & flavorful. Their potatoes au gratin were amazing. They add a little bit of bacon to  them. For dessert, we got an apple pie à la mode with a caramel sauce. It was pretty good, although it was lacking that very delicious flaky crust. Instead, it was more of a cracker. I appreciate them wanting it to be different. But, it was a little too different for me. I think next time, I will get their specialty which are the Fried Oreos.

Steaks are between 50 and 60 dollars and everything is a la cart, and because of that, my wife and I were expecting an intimate atmosphere along the lines of the Golden Steer, Oscars, or Circus Circus Steakhouse which is fine dining. That was not the case here. This place was not intimate at all, it was very loud, and it was hard for my wife and I to carry on a normal conversation across the table. The Peppermill is more intimate than this place. 
My wife and I ordered our food, and her food came to the table just fine. My steak on the other hand was no where to be seen. After waiting 45 minutes I asked our waiter to check on my steak. He told me he was sorry, that he forgot to tell them to fire it, and it would be out shortly. My wife was done with her meal when I got my steak which took a total of 55 minutes from the time it was ordered. 
I had a Jack and Coke, and when it was empty, not once did our waiter or anyone else for that matter even ask if I wanted another one, or if I wanted a soda, tea, or other beverage. Being that they forgot my steak they cooked it as fast as they could and when it got to the table it was burnt . I ate the steak. The Aspen corn was very good. At this point we told our waiter and an assistant manager that we were displeased with our first experience at T Bones, and we would never be coming back. The Manager appeared and said he was very sorry we were unhappy, and he took the steak off our bill which I thought was very nice, but it doesn't make up for our bad time.

Bread before dinner was amazing, not sure if that's a reason to go but it could be.  Steak was good - got the New York ""supreme oscar"" style which involves lobster chunks (fair amount too).  Was cooked perfect and tasted great though thinking back it was probably similar to what you might get a Flemmings which is also a great place and more affordable.  Service was good as well.  

Anyway reason I knocked off a star is there seemed to be several issues.  Table next to us had a manager over for several minutes discussing some problem with the food (which the individual did not touch).  Later, different table appeared to send back a dessert - which was then replaced.  And my own lovely wife ordered her filet medium rare and received it not just rare but basically raw in the middle.

Located inside the main casino in Red Rock Hotel, where my sister and her family were staying, there was a half hour wait at 8:30 pm. There was an option to sit at the bar and order from the full menu, but I thought if we were paying full price we wanted full dining table options. It was nice to have that option, though, and there was a musician playing in the bar area. This was actually a good thing, as I suggested we wait at the casino bar and I could try to make some money at the blackjack tables to pay for dinner.  15 min later and about $500 more in my pocket then before, we were stoked! 

We were seated in the main dining room, next to a central fireplace in a glass display, which added beautiful ambience.  The menu is awesome, and has an excellent variety of steaks, salads, chops, and seafood.  For appetizers we had the Kitchen Sink Caesar Salad, which as its name implies has a lot of ingredients (no meat).  It has Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Hearts of Palm, and served with an awesome Spicy Horseradish Dressing. We also got a complimentary assortment of bread which included pretzel bread and crispy flat bread that was most memorable.  

For entrees I got the 22 oz bone rib eye which was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender. The other steaks came out just as tender and delectable.  Highly flavorful and juicy, every bite was amazing.  We also ordered the fully loaded baked potato which we split, creamed corn, and brussels sprouts.

Service, as mentioned, was excellent, and they came to fill our drinks regularly.  When we left, they packed our food and even gave us extra bread as we saved some of our dinner for my niece and nephew who ordered room service.  They loved the steaks too.

I haven't ever been a fan of their food, on 3 visits it just wasn't that good or spectacular considering the price. My last steak here was over 2 years ago so things change, go with the more recent reviews.

We had crab cocktail for starters and it was as good as it gets.  My husband had the bone-in filet and loved it.  I had the surf and turf and what can I say...I haven't had lobster tail that yummy in a long time.  The petite filet was (how we say in NY) like buttah!  We shared the mac-n-cheese and grilled asparagus as sides...both good but we took most of it home because we had to save room for dessert.  My husband had the toffee cake which he said was way too sweet.  I had the sorbet assortment and it was a great ending to a great meal.  The cappucinos were so-so; have had better elsewhere but this is a steak house so really, no complaints about that part.  The cocktails were very good also; my favorite was the Berrytini-yummy!

Overall, I highly recommend T-Bones Chophouse...nice environment, great staff, awesome food.  Like others, I agree it's pricey but the menu, including the prices, is posted at the hostess station so there's really no surprises there.

First let me start with the decor. The restaurant has a very open design with high ceilings, red rock style accents, and huge fire pits.  The place also sports a patio which overlooks the pool area and seems like it would be a fun spot if it weren't so cold right now.  In fact now that I think of it the huge fire place/walls of fire almost give you a feeling of being in an oven so perhaps they are trying to make us hungry in advance.

So I ordered an appetizer from the seasonal menu, Foie Gras of course, the bone in prime rib, and the scalloped potatoes as a side. The portions are huge so you should count on sharing (the other people at the table ordered the Tuna Poke, Macaroni & Cheese, and the Brussel Sprouts). Before eating I had to try the cocktails, because really who needs a salad, and the menu was a fresh mix of interesting martinis. When the food came it was exactly as we ordered and looked great.  

A side note to those of you that shudder at the thought of a ""bone-in"" steak. First the bone gives it flavor, second I am at the top of the food chain and I am happy about it so no I dont feel bad!

Back to the food, WOW! I kept saying it over and over during the meal ""I cant believe a place this well done and tastes this good exists off the strip"".  The leftovers made my day too. In summation I would highly recommend this spot for a nice dinner out if you want to stay off the strip. And yes go bone in...

I cannot express how immensely disappointed with this restaurant we all were. I wish we had read the reviews about the wait time before. We knew it was going to be expensive, so were prepared for that, but everything else was beyond a joke.

The staff were pretentious and unfriendly. They made no effort to accommodate the children we had with us, and had no idea about serving food for young kids.

We waited over an hour and a half to get food, and that was despite chasing up with the staff several times. By the time it eventually arrived, one child had fallen asleep, and the others were so tired and upset they couldn't face eating. And to make things worse, the size of the children's portions were gigantic. Two of them burst into tears upon seeing their cheeseburger because it was so big they were scared to even attempt to eat it. The food for the adults in our party wasn't anything special, certainly not worth the over-inflated prices they were charging.

Although we complained about the service, the server still insisted we paid a mandatory 20% gratuity. We spoke with a manager at the door, who promised to take care of the bill after we had reluctantly paid, however, over a week later I have yet to receive any form of a refund.

Note this is a nice steakhouse so the decor, linens and other guests were all well dressed and extremely well done up. Even the live music created a warm environment for us to enjoy our meal and time with each other in conversation. Never at any point did we feel pressure to leave early. We will be back to this place or its sister property (hanks) in green valley soon. Next stop happy hour.",2G4wLWYtpJaVsaQ0dOxF0w,2,0,5,ZQtRqtBi2BSvFwWSt7v0YQ

I had Deep Fried Oreo cookies while my friend took in the some type of toffee cake.  Both didn't dissappoint but the cake could have been something a little more.  However, the Deep Fried Oreos have to be tasted to be believed. The service was friendly but not over the top go out of your way kind of service.",OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,0,0,4,AW1zWQJB-nA8t9_i5mM00Q

The garlic mashed potatoes were buttery and whipped. Melted in your mouth, but you'd expect that for $12. A good sized portion in line with other steak houses.

I enjoyed the live music. Catchy tunes that enhanced the experience.",3FpTdkH8BHxPR9nEwLNklA,0,0,4,xaJ3oW8KZ_OXUENcgTrong
