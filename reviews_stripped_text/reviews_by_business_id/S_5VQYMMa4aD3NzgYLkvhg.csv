With all the hype going on about this place, I needed to see for myself what it was all about.

Came at 12 and was able to beat the lunch rush. Ordered the mochiko chicken bowl with added stir fried veggies and got a lychee lemonade. By the time I got my drink and picked a table, my order was already in front of me. They are quick! 

Verdict: I think my expectations were too high that I felt like the bowl fell a tad bit short of complete satisfaction. The flavors are there, the chicken is grilled nicely, and they give a good amount of veggies to your order. But the veggies were somewhat overcooked and the sauce, a little too overpowering. It was good but I probably should have gone in blindsighted. Looking at photos that made me salivate and seeing such great reviews prior to coming here probably skewed my perception. I will say the lychee lemonade was pretty good. I actually liked how it wasn't so tart but tasted more like lychee. Refilled twice on it while I was there. If you like lychee, this drink is for you.

Overall, I do see this place doing well. The place got busy around 1230 with people eating in and taking out. Although my first experience wasn't mindblowing, I definitely will be returning.

This place is, simply put, off the hook. The entire staff cheered me on as I tasted sauces and selected my bowl, feeling like some kind of chicken champion when they all started clapping for me. 

When my food arrived (Hawaiian Hen House with a chicken tender on the side, add veggies because let's do this), it was steaming hot and too good for words. Like seriously, I tried to type about it and my iPhone broke and I'm doing this review on a strangers phone.

Ordered the bento? I believe, with three chicken strips, coleslaw, roll and fries. Portion size was generous and price was low. Chicken was very moist but it did not ruin the breading.

Only issue here for me was the choice of music playing. Told the manager/owner? and she explained that the station they were playing had a calming effect and had less commercials. (I think she just really likes it)

Sorry, but Kenny G and all of the other smooth jazz artists don't calm me down. It just makes me want to go to sleep. 

I'd recommend they get a $10 per month spotify account and play something more current that corresponds with the Hawaiian/Asian fusion theme they worked up on the menu. Then they won't have to worry about commercials or me taking a nap in the restaurant.

Good enough for me!

This place is in the Trader Joe's plaza, which I would have never found myself if Emily wasn't driving. The place is small and still looks new... because it IS new! Only open four days, and they're already killin' it!

I ordered the Ohana combo, while she got the Hawaiian Hen House, but we had already planned on sharing. The Ohana combo is four chicken strips, fries, coleslaw, a Hawaiian Roll, and a drink for $10. These are four GIANT chicken strips though... lightly breaded so it's crunchy but you still get the full flavor of the chicken, which was one of the best chicken strips I've had in a good long time. They were plump and juicy -- no dried out strips here! The fries also had an excellent amount of crunch.

They gave us a little bit of each sauce to try out, which was really nice, and this is where I got nervous, because some people get weird with sauce. (I'm looking at you, Rubio's... WHY YOU GOTTA DROWN EVERYTHING IN YOUR CRAPPY LIME CREAM SAUCE???!? But I digress...) My favorite was the Polynesian sauce, which was sweet and unlike anything I ever tasted. I should have asked what was in it, but I was too busy licking it off my fingers. The Sriachia sauce (I'm sure I misspelled that) was sweet but spicy at the same time, and wound up being Elite Emily's fave.

The Hawaiian Hen House was our other dish, great for someone who doesn't want fried foods. It was their chicken, grilled and chopped, served over rice with sesame seeds, a fried egg, and the aforementioned Polynesian sauce. It was ridiculous good. So good I have the leftovers and I'm super excited to eat it again. Who gets excited for leftovers, really? But I am. The sauce was sweet but not overwhelming, and like their strips, their grilled chicken is plump and juicy. The only downside to this was that the fried egg wasn't fried hard enough for either of our liking, but we were informed later that if we request a harder fried egg they have no problem doing it, so that's a nice save.

The staff was awesome! The counter girl was chipper, the girl who brought it to our table was nice and pointed everything out to us, and Jerry (the owner, maybe?) came out to us to chat about the food and what we liked and didn't like, and he seems really passionate about this place.

We're already planning what we want on our next trip! It's a nice little secret gem but I don't anticipate it being secret for too much longer!",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,4,2,4,TMyhwI96r0bRoDtKCt7XUw

FOR HER: I ordered the same thing my first two visits, so I tried something different. All I knew was I wanted the Asian Q sauce with whatever I tried! I got the GARLIC LOVER'S bowl, which was fried chicken with rice, sesame seeds & scallions. For additional $1.29 you can have steamed vegetables added too! The chicken was nice & crispy, lots of flavor... The Asian Q sauce was paired great too. This wasn't a bad choice per say, but I honestly liked what I got previously. I also ordered the LYCHEE LEMONADE as my drink... and I am addicted. It's not too sweet, yet has a strong lychee flavor. Free refills too? I sometimes want to go by there just for that! A must try! 

FOR HIM: He took my recommendation of what I got last time and ordered the ASIAN Q SIGNATURE BOWL, which is grilled chicken drizzled in Asian Q sauce & furikake on top of rice. (He opted for the brown rice instead of white.) We agree this is such a savory combo... The chicken is perfectly chargrilled and goes so well with rice. I found myself eating more of his food than mine honestly, lol.

While I was there my kid spilled a bit of his drink on the floor and his lap and that's always stressful for a parent, but the manager or maybe she's the owner, was so kind about the whole thing. She even put on a kid show on the TV to help calm my little boy. So nice of her! The place is small, but its new, clean, and modern.

1513538,2015-05-14,2,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"What if there was a place like Raising Cane's that offered their chicken tender combos with rice, instead of fries? A hawaiian sweet roll, instead of Texas toast? A tangy asian slaw, instead of a creamy coleslaw? And a variety of sauces for dipping, not just the one mayo-based BBQ sauce? If you're like me, you were probably wondering if there could be such a place...there is my friend, Mochiko Chicken offers just that and then some...

So, I just happened to be on the west side of town on some business driving down Decatur (starving, was lunchtime and I hadn't had breakfast...) when I looked up and saw a strip mall sign. At the bottom, in bold black and white letters it read ""Mochiko Chicken""...I thought to myself, I like mochiko chicken! Better check it out...before I get too hangry.

Located on the corner of Decatur blvd. and O'Bannon Dr., right near the Trader Joe's. If you blink, you could miss it. It's a smallish, but bright and clean establishment on the inside, with a very friendly, welcoming staff. Mochiko Chicken offers up some asian inspired fast-food chicken bowls, grilled or fried. The fried chicken is coated with a lightly seasoned rice flour. I checked in with Yelp, and there was a $1 off coupon for the Ohana chicken tender combo...thanks Yelp!, sold! The Ohana combo comes with 4 pieces of their mochiko fried chicken tenders, seasoned fries (I substituted with white rice), a hawaiian sweet roll, Asian slaw and a choice of 2 sauces. The chicken was juicy and delicious, not dried out like tenders can be...pretty good sized pieces too. The Asian slaw was sweet and tangy, reminded me of the vinaigrette you would get with a Chinese chicken salad, was okay. The sauces I got were the Polynesian, a sweet creamy concoction, it was so good, I could've drank it...also, got the ginger-teriyaki sauce, nice strong ginger flavor, could smell it right away. The Combo also came with a drink, I got the Lychee Lemonade, was a thirst quencher for sure...not too sweet and has that distinct lychee taste (if you haven't had lychee before, you might not like it...)

I pretty much did a drive-by of this place, but I like Mochiko Chicken's business model...I guess with it's namesake, it better be some damn good chicken, right?
I'll definitely be back, if I'm ever on that side of town again (and hungry). We need a Mochiko Chicken in Henderson, please.",rkZ_FQ1yWxPOm3JCv_wKwQ,2,1,4,fLrFCPSVq3hZZF3buH-eBQ

Ironically enough, although I come here for something healthier, I always end up getting their fried chicken as opposed to grilled. You are given the option of white or brown rice and whether or not you want to add veggies. Veggies are steamed and has a slight buttery taste. I think I tried all of the spicy bowls, but as a person who LOVES spicy food, I would say that it's not spicy at all. Good for those that do not have a high spicy tolerance.

Service has been awesome every time I came in. Food comes out pretty fast considering that they are made to order.

1605732,2015-02-23,7,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"Upon finding out the fingers, AKA tenders were back at Mochiko Chicken, I wanted to climb the tallest peak in the valley and shout at the top of my lungs to let everyone in valley know.

After writing my last update, I was contacted by Team Mochiko.  They kindly explained why the fingers were taken off the menu along with explaining the perspective and goals as a business owner.

Nine days ago, I received another update.  THE MOCHIKO CHICKEN FINGERS WERE BACK IN FULL SWING!  I was also informed they had brought in a new chef to optimize their operation.  When they mentioned they had Mochiko chicken and waffles, I spread the word and could not wait to return!

Yesterday would be that day.  I drove well out of our way to see my beloved fingers with my beloved GF and the Boy.  

After walking in, there they were on the digital menu board.  My heart skipped a beat.  I have been on a low calorie diet for the past three weeks and I decided to damn the calories to hell.  The service was super friendly.  Having been there before, I asked the super sweet girl at the register to explain the menu to the GF and the Boy.

""The Ohana"" was the only way for me to go on this day.  Four pieces of succulent white chicken, perfectly breaded with the Mochiko proprietary blend of awesomeness!  It comes with seasoned fries, Hawaiian roll, two sauces (more on that later), Asian coleslaw, and a fountain drink.  All that for just under $10!

The Boy got the same as I did and the GF ordered up ""The Cali.""  Much smaller than the Ohana and did not have slaw.

In addition to the Ohana, I also purchased an order of Mochiko Tenders and Waffles for the group to share.  Two tender along with two Belgian waffles, served with a maple butter syrup.  

The sauces are awesome.  There is the Asian Q.....This is the signature sauce.  If it was ever bottled and sold separately I would gladly dedicate a section of real estate in my fridge for it.  The Raspberry Chipotle, was a wonderful combination of slightly sweet and semi warm. It absolutely made the finger pop.  The host of other sauces you will have to try for yourself.  Normally double dipping is a no no, but on this day, permission was granted for all

While waiting for our glorious chow, I took notice of the dining area which is still immaculate.  The atmo was mellow and the vibe was perfect with others silently devouring their meals...a very good sign.

At last all of our food would arrive.  I marveled at the size of the fingers and based upon their appearance..KNEW they would be just as delicious and juicy as they had been in the past.

Eating that first bite, I almost leapt from my seat with joy.  The fingers were indeed back.  The GF laughed at how happy I was.

The Mochiko version of chicken and waffles is as great for lunch as it is breakfast.  The crunchy Belgian with the slightly crunchy tender, lightly dipped in the syrup went perfectly with each other.  I was happy everyone else was full as it allowed me to eat a majority of it.

What a glorious return...we were fortunate to run into the owners whom I had met the second time I visited. We got to taste an experimental tender made to replicate Chicken Katsu.  It was a little more robust in texture and seasoning than the regular Mochiko tender.  I would love to see it on the menu someday.  We also got to meet the new chef.

What a happy, happy day as one of my favorite foods has returned to my favorite restaurant who knows just how to make it special.

Thank you Team Mochiko!!!!!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,11,8,5,hgf3ium06MRCDRBsc1f2Hw

Let me tell you I did myself a HUGE disservice by not coming here two years ago because I deprived myself of all this DELICIOUSNESS for two whole years!!!

When you first walk in, it is a small, clean dining area, it's very cute and homey. When I walked to the counter, the woman who helped me, Sandra, was so friendly and inviting! She asked if it was my first visit and when I told her it was she told me all about their homemade sauces and she even let me sample them all! All the sauces were so delicious that I really couldn't make up my mind! After careful consideration I chose the Crispy Red Dragon bowl and added vegetables. This bowl did not disappoint! The Red Dragon is a combination of the Asian Q sauce, Srirachi sauce, and Red Chili Oil. This combination was pretty epic! I also ordered the he Lychee lemonade with Lychee jelly which was a perfect addition to the meal-it definitely hit the spot on this hot Vegas Summer day! 

All in all between the excellent customer service, the amazing food, cleanliness, and fast service I will definitely make the way out-of-the-way trip just to experience this all over again (maybe with a different bowl though because there are so many delicious sauces I feel the need to try them all)!

I've been stalking this place since their signage went up in the Trader Joe's plaza months ago- they finally opened to the public today! Mochiko chicken is a Japanese-Hawaiian fried chicken that is marinated for 24 hours and breaded in sweet rice flour prior to frying. (According to Wikipedia)

Menu offers a few plates, bowls, and salads-  basic menu with different dipping sauces and a la carte chicken options. Ordered The Cali plate: two pieces of chicken, fries and coleslaw, with a Hawaiian roll and a drink. Interior is minimalist and modern with neutral colors, save for a beach painting on one wall.

The fried chicken here tastes more baked than fried, and has a slight sweetness with good crunch and a very fine breading. Dipping sauce was light yet flavorful. Fries are lightly seasoned, similar to a Cajun style. Coleslaw is not mayo-based which automatically made me like it over other varieties, and roll was soft and sweet.

But what really makes them stand out are the service and the lychee lemonade- Sandra was super friendly and upbeat, running the counter and telling me about the company. As for the beverage? It has the sweetness of lychee with the slight tartness of lemon, I would probably bathe myself in this delicious drink. Be sure to get it when you go!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,18,4,5C5nZCrAj7jk_DhTC3zoRg

1773291,2017-01-19,2,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"For a ""fast-food"" option - this is one of the healthier (kinda) , cleanest , and more friendly places.

When I want something healthy like a bowl , I get either the ""Red Dragon"" or the ""Asian Q"" bowl. They're both the same thing since it's basically chargrilled chicken and brown rice (although you can also opt for fried chicken and white rice) , they just have different sauces. ""Red Dragon"" comes with sriracha aioli sauce that I love. As someone who loves spicy food , it's not that spicy at all. I would describe the ""Asian Q"" bowl as the non-spicy version of ""Red Dragon."" Veggies are extra sadly. Even though I hate paying extra for things (like guac at Chipotle lol) , I have to order my bowl with veggies. The veggies are steamed and have a slight buttery taste. They're a great accompany to the chicken and rice.

When I don't really care about what I'm eating , I get their bento which comes w/ fried chicken tenders , seasoned fries , choice of sauces , a Hawaiian roll and a drink. Their fried chicken tenders are the best. I personally think they're better than Cane's chicken tenders. Their lychee lemonade drink is tangy and refreshing. The only thing I don't like from Mochiko is the fries. Fries are not that great , we can't even finish all of them. 

Prices are good considering they have big portions. Most of the menu items are about 8$. I can eat half of my bowl for lunch then save the other half for later. Try this place out ! I'd be here all the time if it wasn't so far from my house.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,8,4,5,fiM2trQnajbiMNTXTMd4Fg

While we have many nearby food options the vast majority are your standard fast food fare. We certainly wanted a more unique answer to the age old work question... 'What are you doing for lunch today?'

The owners used to operate one of my favorite food trucks and I had a pretty high expectation of how good the food should be at the restaurant. I was not disappointed in the least. The chicken and sauce was perfect.  Better than Raisin' Canes could ever hope to be. 

I'm a big guy so I ordered the Ohana plate, 4 strips of Chicken, Fries and all the fixings and a soft drink. For the price of 9.99 I have yet to see a better deal. I don't think I can accurately describe how filling the chicken strips are other than to say after 2 I was already beginning to feel full. The fries were very tasty and seasoned well. They complimented the chicken perfectly. 

If I had any complaints it would be that we couldn't tell 100% if they were open yet today until we walked up to the door.

Days prior to our FKT, my boss ordered me to try the Hawaiian Hen House with an over-medium egg and steamed veggies ... and fell madly in love.  

FKT came around, but only a friend and my bf tagged along.  Our friend ordered the Crispy Asian Q with two eggs and white rice, my bf ordered the Crispy Mochiko with brown rice, and I had the Asian Q with veggies and white rice.  So the Asian Q is like the Hawaiian Hen House except without egg, and the Asian Q and Crispy Asian Q is basically the same thing except one is crispy, and the other is grilled chicken. 

So here's what we all felt: the food is amazing and we we all fell in love with the food and the Asian Q sauce - It's a great spin for extra flavor. We love how the steamed veggies is fresh and not wilting. 

However, we do believe it's a bit on the pricey side for a fast food joint. They should offer combos for their bowls, rather than paying extra for a drink. If one does not order the Hawaiian Hen House, which is the only one on the menu that comes with a fried egg, you'll pay more for adding an egg on the others - it shouldn't be $1.29 more, but the Hawaiian Hen House is $8.99. Steamed veggies should already be included in the price since it's advertised on their menu, but you pay another $1.29 more. Extra sauce? Uhm... yeah, extra.

2032423,2016-11-15,5,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"I guess I should finally write a review about this place.
This place has become my default place for something healthy and tasty or when I can't think of anything else to eat. I've tried every item on the grilled side. Nothing on the fried side. Everything is essentially the same. You get some chicken on your choice of white or brown rice, and you can get a side of steamed veggies for an additional cost. You can also add an egg (standard on the Hawaiian Hen House) for a charge as well.The variations between items are the different sauces and some extra flavorings such as ginger. I do recommend trying something different on every visit, rather than getting Hawaiian Hen House every single time.
Regarding the healthiness of the grilled food here: It's almost perfect. Brown rice + chicken, + veggies seems like a formula for a perfectly healthy meal! A super-critical health nut would probably say that the sauce is what makes this meal unhealthy. If you can look past that, or not bring a health nazi with you when you go to lunch ever, then you won't feel guilty at all when you eat here. They also have Lychee Lemonade there which can bust your calorie limit for the day if you drink too much. But it's damn good.
They also had a new Ahi Tuna Poke bowl when I went there last. This was actually quite good as well.
Good food is nothing without good service. I always get good service here. From Sandra herself to all of her staff, I always get good service. 
The only negative thing I have to say for the sake of completeness is that your meal could get  a bit pricey. I wish the veggies were standard, but they're an extra $2. So if you get a Hawaiian Hen House, veggies, and a drink, you're looking at $13 before tip. This won't stop me from coming here at all. It just stops me from giving me a 5 star rating.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,12,11,4,-2S5dmim4CYVmTn851fg7w

One of the main reasons is I feel like they read the reviews and listened to what the people wanted, and then made changes for the better. They had removed the chicken fingers that everyone loved, but I was happy to see they were back on the menu. My last review I had griped that the fries came out seasoned, and there was no mention of that on the menu, but I was happy to see that the menu has been updated to reflect that the fries are in fact seasoned! I thought the fries were still a bit too salty, but the fact that they made the effort to change will keep me coming back.

So for my lunch I chose the Ohana box which comes with 3 chicken strips, coleslaw, fries, a Hawaiian roll, 2 sauces and a drink for $7.99. They also have a 2 or 4 piece option as well. I paid, and then I went to get me some delicious Lychee lemonade, and saw that they added a new drink called Melonade. It was very good, but a bit too sweet for me. I ended up mixing both drinks together and adding a little water to lessen the sweetness and it was very good. Lychee-Melonade for the win! Anyway It did take about 15+ minutes for my food to come out, but they were busy preparing an Eat 24 order, so just FYI you can order for delivery through a third party. My food came out hot. The chicken tenders were juicy and delicious, not greasy at all and tasted great with a few of the dipping sauces I chose. They have about 10 to choose from and I chose the Asian Q which is the signature sauce, Thai peanut sauce which is new, and added on a coconut curry sauce for a small charge. I will say I enjoyed all but the Thai peanut sauce, which is odd because I usually love peanut sauce. Don't get me wrong, the sauce was tasty and flavorful, but it was cold as a dipping sauce should be, and that may be why I didn't particularly care for it. The fries, well I told you about those, next time I will get rice, and the Asian slaw was realllly good. It is a vinegar based slaw that had a slight tang as well as some sweetness. I ate it all up.

-Affordable 
-Big bowls 
-They deliver 
-Happy Hour 
-Delicious food

2303967,2016-02-28,7,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"Rice bowls making comeback lately in the Vegas Valley?? All I know is I LoVe it!!! Nothing better then bowl of rice topped with quality protein, side vegetables, and tasty sauces. Mochiko Chicken definitely hits all the things I enjoy about rice bowl. I know you can order fried egg on anything but being my first time wanted to try the bowl straight up. I came with another yelper Suzy H it was her second time so filled me in on the menu and the fact can add fried egg too any bowl. We ordered Mochiko Fried Chicken and Grilled Coconut Curry Bowl. Since with my yelp partner in crime like try lot of food. Also ordered the Mochiko Bites with Waffles. 

The Mochiko Fried Chicken was solid. It definitely reminded me of local style back home taste shoyu in the crust (that darker side not light and crispy on the outside). Very addicting. You get nice amount of chicken in the bowl. The bowl is nice size not tiny bowl or is it expensive. Double hell yay!!! The side vegetables were good nice hot and fresh. I feel like could have use more seasonings. The sticky rice or could also order brown rice as option was good. The Grilled Coconut Curry Bowl that was the real winnah for me. I would ordered that over the Mochiko Fried Chicken easy. The reason is the sauce combine with the grilled chicken is tasty. The thing that stands out for me. It neither overpowering with the curry or the coconut. Just has that right balance. Both bowls the chicken was cooked perfect nice hot and moist on top of the rice. 

The waffles not really fan. The bites is basically the same as regular Mochiko in smaller pieces. The Belgian Waffles maybe that the style cause not often order waffles more of pancake person. All I know is the Waffles were super heavy (no doubt deep fried or tasted like) maybe that the style? I don't know. It comes with side of honey. Honey did nothing for me change my mind about the dish. The bites one that would order again again.

It somewhat hidden in the corner of small shopping mall. Just look for Trader Joe in the same shopping mall it couple doors down on the corner. The service is awesome from the cashier to think might been the owner checking up making sure everything was good. The place not that big but few tables and stand up counter with stools. They have one widescreen just fyi.

Admittedly late to the Mochiko Chicken party, my love and I finally stopped in with another member of our family to experience a little of what others have raved about at Mochiko. What is it that others are raving about?...tasty feakin' chicken bowls!

We ordered the Hawaiian Hen House, Spicy Mochiko, and The Cali Chicken Tenders combo. All the chicken was good...very moist and flavorful, and the egg on Hawaiian Hen House was perfectly over-easy, with a nice runny yolk. We added steamed veggies and subbed brown rice to both of our bowels and also subbed grilled chicken in the Spicy Mochiko. Everything was made to order, but it came out quickly. The menu is a bit of a misnomer, with all the options listed, because essentially there is just one item here: Chicken Bowl! Everything else is just fried or grilled, and how would you like it dressed up. The sauces pack a lot of flavor, though the Polynesian sauce that came with the Hen House can be a little heavy for the health conscious. 

The space is small, but is is clean and well organized...certainly nice for the fast food prices you're paying here. I wouldn't hesitate to stop back in, but I'm also not sure I'll dive here for a destination lunch either. In the end, I see it Mochiko chicken as a great alternative to the generally below average options that dominate this price-point, certainly worth checking out...3.85 stars that obviously rounds up to 4.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,41,35,4,OIG06pXgFaW7nd7xL7tVdA

I walked back later on after I left work and the lady did remember me. She even brought up my order from before and asked if I wanted the same thing and put my order in again. She gave me 20% off for the trouble which was great because it was my birthday. Although it's a new business, I definitely enjoy their chicken.

Taste-wise, this fried chicken is quite unlike any other I've ever had. It is heavily, although by no means excessively, seasoned.  Magnificent seasoning, yo!

Texture-wise, the outside was adequately crisp without being over-breaded. The inside was soft and succulent.

Yes, I am biased because Sandra & Jerry are my friends. But, wait, EVERYONE is their friends. They are such genuinely nice and caring and community and family oriented people that they invariably reach out to everyone with a smile, a sincere desire to please and to serve, a quest for perfection, striving along the way for honest feedback and learning how to give the public what they want in a helpful, healthful manner.
This is a wonderful story of a loving native of Slovakia [who recently became an American citizen] uniting with a Hawaiian of Filipino heritage who have striven their way up the ""food chain"" of American small business, toward ever greater success. Starting with a food cart, they have scaled up their operations to this, their first sit down restaurant, by SERVING the public in every sense of the word.
Their srirachi chicken with steamed vegetables reflects their quintessential American LOVE story in every morsel. So does every dish here.
And there are multiple levels of LOVE in ""play."" Clearly Sandra and Jerry's love glows - as does their love of service, their love of Las Vegas, their love of what they have achieved, their love for their dreams to continue to grow and to expand their loving influence via their culinary offerings.
The place is unassuming and spotless, simple yet full of high tech innovations. Fast and efficient yet full of special fare which is full of thoughtful ingredients and preparation.
But, perhaps, what struck me most and what touched my heart most palpably was when Sandra sat down and shared with me her story of how she and Jerry chose their location in the Trader Joes off OBannon & Decatur, next door to the Telus call center. Turns out that their bimonthly visits to that Telus call center parking lot next door created such a ravid following that those call center employees literally insisted, not just encouraged, this wonderful American LOVE story couple to open up business next door.
Call center employees.  Think about THAT! 
Get it? Everyday people with relatively minimal disposal income INSISTING that a restaurant open up so that they could visit daily with their hard earned money.
I cannot think of a more revealing scenario and of a more tangible example of the value that Jerry and Sandra are offering to this community than the fact that call center employees knew they would serve them best.
These are owners who assuredly and deservedly will continue to grow and to evolve and who will continue to grow in their following and success.  But their roots are with the underserved, the hard working little guys who must by necessity watch every penny. And they serve them best.

Located in a strip mall on the north west corner of O'Bannon Drive and Decatur, you can find Mochiko Chicken actually right next to a Dotty's near the corner. We stopped by this place today on the glowing recommendations of two coworkers. 

I ordered the Hawaiian Hen Bowl ($8.99), while my friend grabbed a Mochiko Tenders and Waffles combo ($6.99), which also comes with a drink.

Wow!

My bowl was pretty huge compared to any other chicken bowl place I've been to in this town. Not only that, but everything was so incredibly tasty! The chicken was tender and juicy and well seasoned! Not too much, not too little, but just right! The brown rice was fluffy and cooked to perfection. The egg on top just made it a perfect combination! 

The chicken tenders were the best I've had in recent memory! I was very impressed by the waffles. It seems like every time I get waffles lately, its not cooked properly and the waffle ends up being tough and borderline chewy. When you bite into one of these waffles, you get that crunch on the outside, but all that soft and fluffy goodness on the inside!

The cashier was very sweet and friendly and could not have done her job any better! Service was flawless! I feel like I have just discovered a real gem here and will be back soon, and often, for many, many repeat visits!

The food still tastes alright. They raise their prices frequently. Bowl and drink will be almost $11 now and this was without the $1.29 veggies. It's not like the veggies are specially prepared or anything; they're from a frozen bag from the supermarket. Lol. I remember when they first opened, the $6.99 Mochiko Bowl was worth it. They have not once proactively mentioned a thing about their stamp card since the first couple weeks that they opened. That is sad. I am not even sure if they still honor it to be honest. I should have almost filled 2 cards by now but I always forget to mention it.

3142201,2015-11-03,0,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"Me: This place serves chicken bowls and chicken and fries. You can get crispy or grilled. We ordered the Hawaiian Hen House (grilled chicken with a Polynesian sauce over a bed of rice) and an Crispy Asian-Q (crisp chicken over bed of rice with an Asian-Q sauce). You can order vegetables with them and we did for a small upcharge and was complimentary with the chicken and rice. 

The chicken was grilled fresh. We could see the grill covered with chicken when we walked in. The crispy chicken was not strips or tenders but chunks and was not heavily battered but lightly floured just for texture and carrying the sauces drizzled over them, nicely. 

The Asian-Q sauce was a sesame-ish, creamy BBQ sauce that was nice with the crispy chicken and rice. Without it, I think the dish would've dry and maybe a little bland. The Polynesian sauce (on the Hawaiian Hen House) was a little sweeter than the Asian-Q but not overwhelmingly sweet or at all syrupy.  In fact it was really not obvious and then a nice surprise to find it was drizzled over the grilled chicken and atop the rice which had also absorbed the juice from the chicken. You should know that the Hawaiian Hen House also had a fried egg on top. It was a nice, and just added to the yummy rice already soaking up the chicken juice and Polynesian sauce. They make their own sauces, and there are others besides these two that I think we will return to try. They even offer you samples of you question or seem skeptical of a sauce. 

The vegetables were nothing special on their own but went well with the chicken bowls. In sum, they were carrots and broccoli and squash that tastes steamed and a little buttery. I do recommend it with the bowls. 

We didn't try the chicken tenders and fries but guessing because they cook fresh here and create their own sauces, you can bet they're pretty good too. 

This place is accessible for all palates. The chicken is good and juicy and the servings are pretty generous too. 

Him: Basically, the lychee lemonade is the reason to go here. It is not as sweet as plain lychee juice or lychee Calpico, and it quenches your thirst like lemonade. You have to order the crispy Asian-Q. The sauce was delicious. If you like BBQ with Asian flavor, you will love it. The chicken itself was good and not dry or fatty. I hate fat except like, bacon. It took quite a while to cook but I was starving, and then it was worth it. The rice and vegetables were ok, but the chicken and the lychee lemonade were the best. 

My mom ordered the grilled chicken(Hawaiian Hen House). The chicken was tender and juicy. The veggies and rice were the same ok ones as the Asian-Q. Some of the chicken was fatty (thighs) so I ate around the day and liked the crispy chicken better. The sauce was sweeter than the Asian-Q and was really good too. 

The bathrooms are really clean. The restaurant is not fancy. It is small and clean, and there are no waitresses. Also you can park right in front.",5ky17PzUUdl1K8HXboVAlg,1,0,5,R-VYkzXJmG_pqeSc3UUVRw

I'm a sucker for chicken bowls, and this place does just that with a Hawaiian flair. Menu is simple. You can choose between grilled chicken or popcorn-style fried chicken bowls with white or brown rice, and you can add a side of steamed veggies for a dollar. They also offer wings and chicken nuggets. 

What sets this place apart from other chicken bowl places is that they offer many different sauces to complement your chicken, and the owner was generous enough to give me some samples. I really liked the ginger shoyu, mango habanero, Polynesian, and their signature Asian-Q sauce. The Asian-Q sauce was bomb asf! It tasted like a hybrid of Thousand Island and sesame. I decided to try the fried chicken bowl with Asian-Q sauce and a side of steamed veggie over brown rice, and it was delicious! The fried chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, and the sauce paired very nicely with the chicken. Portions were just right as well.

3341127,2014-12-13,3,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"This place has recently ""rebranded,"" which may cause them to go the way of the dodo bird, eight track tapes, and tube televisions. As my previous review of Mochiko indicated, these were the best chicken strips I had ever eaten. HAD ever eaten. As part of their re-branding, the strips and French Fries are gone. Our lunch crew at work has dwindled recently, but when the boss asked ""who wants Mochiko?"" it was like Christmas had come early. The entire group went. My mouth was watering en route, in anticipation of those delicious chicken strips. What a disappointment. All they offer now are bowls, which were actually pretty good before. Not this time. 

I'm not sure if it was my disappointment in the ""re-branding"" or just the fact that I had my mind set on chicken strips, but the Srirachi Bowl I got lacked flavor and spice, although it is advertised as spicy. Not only did it lack flavor and spice, it was lukewarm. And get this, the bowls DO NOT INCLUDE vegetables. You have to pay extra for veggies. A few in the party opted to go without veggies. Meat and rice in a bowl. Whoppie Do! Bland and Boring. My bowl, with veggies added and a beverage was just south of twelve bucks. Not worth it. 

I don't know who pulled the trigger on the re-branding idea, but, in my Elite Yelp opinion, it was a mistake. Why not continue to offer the fantastic chicken strips AND the bowls? After all, variety is the spice of life, right? They have a fairly large TV in the dining area, but had it muted with subtitles and dance type music blaring through the speakers. It was too loud for lunch time ambiance. Had they dimmed the house lights, turned on a strobe light and had a cocktail waitress, they could have charged a cover.

There was a first timer in our group who thought her lunch was good. Maybe what they offer now may be ok for a Mochiko virgin, but having been there and done that, I will not be back. If I want meat, veggies and rice in a bowl, I will go visit the cute little black and white bear. It's served hotter, more conveniently located and they do not charge extra for something that should be included in the first place.

Red ginger teriyaki: This was a lot tastier. More sauce in general, so the brown rice was more flavorful. I'd get this again.

After seeing the pictures, I was excited about the rice bowls and I definitely wanted to try some lychee lemonade. Unfortunately, my friend was totally right - it needs way more lemonade flavor. That being said, it had some nice lychee flavor.

The sauce on the chicken was also quite tasty, but the rice itself was a little underdone. The biggest problem, however, was the ""stir-fry"" vegetables. They were soggy as heck, and let's face it - soggy vegetables are gross. In particular, I pulled out a large mushroom that was completely water-logged. It reminded me of a sponge.

I like the idea of Mochiko, and the people are very nice, but it's got some room for improvement. I might go back just for the chicken meal, sans veggies.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,2,2,3,7DMwIYRXDYfXtCtr9qhQAA

Pros:
* Bowls were yummy & satisfying (I didn't feel overly full, but I didn't leave there hungry)
* Their fried chicken was yummy (better than their grilled chicken)
* Their cream sauce on their bowls was really good
* Their Lychee Lemonade was DEEEELISH!!! It had the perfect amount of lemonade & lychee. I'd totally come back just to get this drink! Haha

Cons: 
* Vegetables are $1 more, but the pictures on their menu show vegetables. So, it was a little deceiving

A quick glance at its Yelp ratings showed promise with affordable prices and even a check-in offer for $1 off. The most impressive aspect of Mochiko was probably the clean and simple interior. As with the decor, the menu is relatively simple and straightforward. It offers Mochiko fried chicken and different types of chicken and rice bowls. 

I tried the signature Mochiko rice bowl and was unimpressed. As a base option, you only get a big bowl of rice topped with grilled chicken and sauce for $7.99. The addition of stir-fry vegetables and a fried egg would've put the entire meal over $10. This is meal that could easily be replicated at home sans the mochiko sauce. I tried some of the Big Island Style bowl and found it to be over sauced, which drenched the rice in saltiness. The fried chicken on top of that bowl was reminiscent of the frozen fried bourbon chicken from Costco. Lastly, the lychee lemonade was unimpressive. I've had a better version in LA with fresh mint at the bottom of every cup.

Chicken was moist and almost the size of a chicken breast. Love the choice of sauces. Tried the coconut curry sauce, Siracha sauce, and the Mochiko sauce. Love curry, so that was the winner for me. The Asian coleslaw has a vinegar kick to it and is minus the traditional creamy texture. The fries had a sweet and salty taste to them that provides a great flavor.

I like the slaw, more vinegary  with a little sweetness. Asian Q sauce remains my fave, my lunching partner liked the ginger teriyaki - it is strong on the ginger taste, too much for me but perfect for her, she'd love it if there were chunks of ginger in it (bleh).  To each their own!

SERVICE
Casual and friendly. They make everything to order so wait is usually 10-20min depending on how busy they are. I personally like placing a pick-up order on the phone so everything is ready to go by the time I get there. 

ATMOSPHERE
Modern and clean. They have few tables and a bar facing the parking lot. You get a good view of people pushing their cart from Trader Joe's and loading their groceries in the car. It is nice to see what people get and make a list of things to buy at Trader Joe's while eating at Mochiko. Maybe that's just me. 

FOOD
Hen House Bowl ($8.99) has a special place in my heart. This is the most popular grilled chicken bowl according to one of their friendly server. Hen House consist of chicken grilled to perfection on a bed of rice with Polynesian sauce. Then I get my egg sunny side up which makes this bowl a dream come true. Ono!

Asian Q Signature Bowl ($7.99) was recommended by my server since I always order Hen House and was looking for something different. It wasn't too memorable and wasn't anything special. The sauce tasted similar to Polynesian sauce on Hen House. Only difference was furikake but it tasted similar to Hen House for the most part. 

The Bento ($7.99) comes with 3 piece of tenders, fries, Hawaiian sweet roll, coleslaw, drink and 2 sauces. They had about 5-7 different sauce options. I got to try their polynesian sauce, buttermilk ranch, barbeque, asian Q and coconut curry which all were some excellent flavors. My personal favorite has to be BBQ (I'm so basic, I know). I personally think polynesian sauce and asian Q are better with grilled chicken. This is definitely a great deal!

Lychee lemonade is perfect to quench your thirst. Too sweet for me but refreshing.

I had a sriracha bowl, which is a rice bowl with chicken tossed in a chimmichurri sauce over rice and topped with a sriracha cream sauce.  They offered veggies for an extra price, come on for 10 bucks you should include the veggies since your using dried herbs for your chimmichurri. On to the chicken bowl it was great when I got some chicken that wasn't soaked in the sriracha sauce.  The chimmichurri and the sriracha just didn't work for me as a combination.  Rice was cooked almost perfectly, and I love me some well cooked rice.  So the bowl was not perfect for me but if it didn't have the sriracha sauce and only the chimmichurri it would have been.  Now they also have a lychee lemonade if you like lychee I recommend stealing their whole container of it and let me know when you do it so I can walk in there when they are busy and do it the next day",54zqyneshZvyWymZLE6mJw,0,0,4,p1umkphSHrwwXWdknByp9A

And yes, they are all good and you will not be disappointed.  But for me, it's all about their Hawaiian Hen House.  Talk about good tasty chicken.  The Hawaiian Hen House is made with their ""Polynesian"" Sauce, 8 oz. of dark meat chicken, toasted sesame seeds, a fried egg, rice, and vegetables. Just describing the Hawaiian Hen House has me salivating. The bowl is pretty big and less than $10.  Look folks, I eat a lot of chicken throughout the week. Okay, I admit it.  I eat a lot of chicken throughout the day. You can say that I'm a chicken pro.  So, listen to the pro.  Stop by Mochiko for the Hawaiian Hen House.

4072689,2015-06-17,0,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"I love it when people can make a proper over easy egg with no runny whites. 

From the reviews on Yelp i had pretty high expectations of this place. Walking through the doors i wasnt too impressed with the cold feeling of the dining room, and the music that didnt fit the feel of the food. The nice young lady behind the counter kindly ordered for me as it was my first time and she gave me the Asian-Q and i took the brown rice on recommendation of others from Yelp. I didnt want the mixed veg as $2.99 to throw a small serving of veg is a bit much. The chicken was good and cooked well, the rice was tasty and fluffy and certainly a surprised being brown rice, and the sauce which i dont remember the name of was equally as good. And a well cooked over easy egg on top.. yum!

All in all it was a good meal, and not a bad value if you dont throw the veg on but i wouldnt make a special trip for it again. If i was going to Trader Joe's and i needed to eat then i would come here. One other thing i would say is that the first 4-5 bites were great as it was new exciting flavor, but toward the end of the bowl it all just tasted a bit muddled... maybe thats just me but its how i felt finishing off my meal.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,1,1,4,JjImgk3MoijEw7v5oAQRVA

Once I got there, I couldn't remember what bowl I had before, so the cashier let me try a few of their signature sauces. I ended up going with the Asian Q bowl with veggies. (Side note: even if I don't get rice, the veggies are still an extra 1.29, which is a little bothersome, but I still chose to pay it anyway)
The chicken is very juicy and has a nice grilled taste to it. That mixed with the sauce.. YUM! I really liked how it was on the sweeter side, but I added some kikoman to my bowl bc I felt that it lacked a little bit of salt. But still, nonetheless, it was really flavorful. 
The only thing that was a little off was how watery the sauce got. I'm sure it was because of the steamed vegetables but it was still extremely watery at the bottom of my bowl rather than the thick sauce I tried earlier.. however, I still really enjoyed my meal, and I also enjoyed the service I received from the cashier.

The interior is small and fills up at lunch time. Since it was my first visit I asked the friendly gal behind the counter for suggestions. The variety of choices is solid and they offer healthy options like brown rice and fresh steamed veggies. I avoided the fried choice and opted for the Hawaiian Hen house bowl and added fresh steamed veggies. The counter gal brought my bowl and beverage promptly to my table and it tasted as good as the presentation. The tender skinless chicken had a charbroiled flavor. My veggies also were yummy and went great with the sauce. The portion of my bowl was generous and I couldn't even finish it.

We have heard about the upcoming Mochiko Chicken concept opening soon so we went on the second day they opened. We were not disappointed, as the service has a very personal touch. The chicken tenders are the best you can buy- nothing like it anywhere else! (we tried raising kanes and they are dry and flavorless). Lychee lemonade is very tasty (although I felt that it could use lemon). The chicken is so good, however, I felt that there should be a bone-in option as well. In the end, I note a few things. The place is small, but gives you the feeling that they will go above and beyond for a guest. Friendly staff and owner is clearly a big part of daily operation. I was lucky enough to be waited on by the owner (Jerry) and he was anxious and more than helpful with all of our questions.

The Hawaiian Hen House was simply grilled chicken on dry, but sticky rice. Dry, but sticky as in dry American rice that they tried to make sticky by adding water- it doesn't work that way. The steamed veggies we added for $2 were just frozen, over steamed veggies. Don't bother adding the veggies. 
The Mochiko Chicken bowl was better. It was fried chicken (I think I've tasted similar chicken at Panda Express) on a ton of dry, but sticky rice. There was not enough chicken to rice for the bowl to be worth $7.99. Double the chicken amount and maybe I would have been a little more satisfied.

Definitely something new and different on the block and must be tried to be appreciated.  You can custom design a very healthy bowl with grilled chicken and vegetables.  If you want to crazy with comfort food the chicken tenders with fries is most satifsfying.  I like using the coconut curry as a fry sauce.  Yummmmy.

I have been recommended everyone at work to try it. This place has became a popular lunch choice for our company since then.

Today, one of my coworker wanted to make her curry spicy. I figured they won't be able to. We asked for chili powder which the cashier said they don't have. What kind of kitchen doesn't have chili powder? Then, I asked for chill flakes. Then she said they do have it but they will need to charge her for it. I found that highly unreasonable and ridiculous.

Their fries are similar, crunchy on the outside, relatively fluffy on the inside. The fries are also lightly salted. I didn't have much of the coleslaw, so I can't review that properly.

I tried the eurosauce, their house mochiko sauce and the sriracha sambal aioli. Starting at the top of that list, the Eurosauce... Its a very creamy, mayo-esque number with tart ""creamy"" feel that sits in the throat. Its similar to tartar sauce. The namesake sauce, mochiko sauce, is a creamy sweet sauce. It has hints of smokyness, garlic, and a peppery taste. Finally, the sriracha samval aioli, to me its mayo + sriracha, and I like sriracha.

I have to give kudos to their team too! They prepare everything to order, so my food is always hot and delicious.  When I place a take out order, I like that they show me the food before I leave.  I've had some minor issues with consistency there in the past, but when I brought it to their attention they went above and beyond to make everything right.

It was just fried chicken bites with some sauce and brown rice for 8 bucks and you have to add $1 for veg... come on now. The wings were good, although they advertised spicy ones and some sweet, of which the latter did not have much sweet flavor. Texture was good however. Lychee lemonade was the best part of the meal.

Told by friends and Chefs that Mochiko Chicken was one of the best stops for a quick bite on the West side of the Strip, a Friday afternoon visit to the husband & wife operation at 2101 South Decatur Boulevard showed the rumors to be not only resoundingly true but perhaps even better, the small storefront literally steps from the new Southwest Medical Associates Oakey and Decatur Clinic space.

Owned by Jerry Misa, a former food-truck owner turned brick n' mortar almost two years back, Mochiko Chicken is largely a ""do one thing, do it well"" operation and with the bulk of the menu centered on boneless chicken breasts offered fried or chargrilled the choice of healthy versus less-so is still unlikely to cost diners more than $10, a downright bargain considering the quality and quantity of the meal.

Dividing the menu into several bowls - brown or white rice and Stir-Fry Vegetables available as a base - plus sides and individual fingers at 1/3 the cost of *other* places in town, those looking for something fresh and flavorful are encouraged to order the signature ""Asian-Q Chicken Bowl"" available with either fried or grilled meat seasoned with Furikake and Jerry's family recipe ""Q-Sauce,"" the flavor all at once unexpected yet familiar with a creamy texture that carries tangy top-notes and a touch of heat on the ending.

Explaining that Mochiko refers to rice flour, something even many in-the-know Southern Mamas have reported adding to old recipes in order to up the 'crunch,' Jerry states that his birth in the Philippines and time in Southern California paired to his mother's secret spice blend in coming up with the concept and with wife Sandra at his side providing excellent customer service, the time and care invested in the restaurant is readily apparent in Jerry's job duties, on this particular day fixing a roofing issue while also playing host and slinging samples of his collection of housemade sauces.

Avoiding spicy stuff as a half-day of work remained, Seasoned Fries provide an ample side for sharing while additionally offering a chance to experiment with the sauce and although personal preference obviously plays a large hand in all tastes I personally found the Coconut Curry, Satay Peanut andMandarin Sweet Chili to be most compelling, the housemade Lychee Lemonade also worthwhile to sip on as the Asian Fruit helps to mellow the harsher acidic tones.

Unable to resist Chicken and Waffles, Mochiko's fluffy squares turned out golden-brown with a light savoriness to the wisps of dough within, three fried strips fared well during the brisk walk back to the office and although I would have appreciated the ""Maple Butter"" warm the flavor was nonetheless exactly as described by the naming, the flavor excellent on the waffles leaving crispy fried chicken to be dunked in the other good stuff.

****Family friendly, fast and affordable despite their obviously limited scope, Sandra and Jerry are doing great stuff at Mochiko Chicken and with options available for both fried chicken fans or those looking for a healthful lunch there are few doing it better anywhere around.  While a personal preference for more non-soda beverage options and perhaps a dessert menu is notable, the size of the kitchen and counter are obviously limiting.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,4,4,tQRikGKeqxTUclLAlZUxBQ
5283848,2015-09-17,0,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"4 stars for food, 3 stars for price. Location is in a strip mall so it is ""fast casual"" and not ""restaurant."" At $7.99 I enjoyed Fukuburger on the strip a lot more. The drive over from the strip was worth it because the Trader Joe's was nearby and we stocked up on wine.

I would advise these guys to price in a way that allows people to spend more but also to get a slight break on the price. So if people like getting an egg or veggies then they should bundle ""egg (or veggies) +drink"" at $2.00 or something like that and they increase their total profit per customer while the customer feels like they got a slightly better deal than normal.  While $7.99 for a pretty tasty bowl of rice with chicken isn't expensive it is on the higher end of the scale for the ""fast casual"" category when you consider the sheer number of ingredients that go into for example, a chipotle burrito, a Cafe Rio salad, etc. all around the same price point or less.

The crispy mochiko chicken has skin with it and it was Dee-licious. For the base, you can have either white or brown rice.

Grilled chicken and rice. I asked for veggies and sauce on the side. The chicken itself was flavorful enough and I didn't really need the sauce. The sauce was good though.

Though, I must say, I was a little disappointed and quite unimpressed with the food. Though, the establishment was quaint, cute, and very clean. I like my places clean! 

So my friend and I each got a bowl: I got the Hawaiian hen house, which was chicken on top of rice with an egg and their signature Polynesian sauce. My friend got their Mochiko bowl, which was chicken and their Mochiko sauce over rice. He also opt in for some veggies. Both of us checked in on Yelp to claim the Yelp deal of $1 off when you get a bowl + lychee lemonade! So we got the lychee lemonade!

The chicken is good. It was cooked just right, was tender and juicy .. not one hint of dryness. The sauce complimented the chicken and the rice very well .. for the first few bites and then it got a little overwhelming. The Polynesian sauce was mayo based so it was really creamy. As a personal preference, I could only take so much before it starts getting a little too heavy for my liking. 

I also didn't really like their egg .. I wanted it over easy and they kinda over cooked it ): I was so sad that my egg yolk wasn't as runny as it should be!

It was pretty much the same for my friend. It seems that the sauce for his bowl was also mayo based. On top of that, he had a huge problem with their veggies. On the menu, it said the veggies were stir fry veggies but when he got them, they just looked like frozen veggies that were microwaved then thrown into the bowl. He was a little disgusted by that. I'm glad I didn't get any cause judging from the pictures on yelp, it did not look stir fried. Lol! 

As for their lychee lemonade ... it tasted like lychee syrup water. Where's the lemonade? I did not taste a single hint of, well, lemon. I was hoping that it'd be more tangy than it was ): 

Portions were huge though. I like how they serve it in a paper bowl so you only need a lid if you can't finish it (which I didn't) .. service was pretty good -- friendly smiles everywhere. Price was decent I suppose ... but still not very impressed with the food ):",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,7,4,3,XC6NlzKsOqZnE3QYhZ9akQ

Located between a Dotty's and a used book store, Mochiko Chicken might seem like a hole-in-the-wall, but honestly those places are always the best.

I was really craving one of the best combinations known to man: chicken and waffles. I got the Chicken Tender and Waffle Combo (2 pieces of chicken tenders and 2 waffles). The chicken tenders and the waffles were a perfect golden-brown color. The chicken tenders were amazing -- they were a perfect size and were lean and juicy. The waffles were on the crunchy side, but it was such a great pairing with the chicken. I ordered the syrup on the side so I could drizzle the perfect amount on my chicken and waffles. What better way to eat juicy chicken tenders than with waffles and syrup? This delectable combo was so AMAZING. You can also order more chicken tenders as a side item if the 2-4 strips aren't enough for you.

That chicken was amazing!  I could have eaten her bowl plus mine.  I also got to sample their fries, which had a nice seasoning and weren't greasy. 
The bottom line is that we will definitely be back.  I want to have an order of the fried chicken all to myself and the Thai Satay Grilled Chicken and Hawaiian Hen House are still on the to-eat list, as well.
Sandra is a lovely lady who checked on us often and told us that her husband created the menu and that he's Filipino.  Boom!  That's why their food is so good. :)  You should try it.

The rice is a little sticky but the chicken is really good. Would come back to this place once in a while when I have no other places to decide to eat.

Fast forward to the food: it was perfect and delicious and fresh. Let me put it to you this way, my boyfriend HATES broccoli with a fierce passion.

My friend is kind of a weenie...she only likes chicken strips and french fries so this place was perfect for us because she could have what she wanted and I could get something more adventurous.  

I had been eyeballing this place for a while and knew exactly what I wanted...$11.97 got me a crispy mochiko chicken bowl with veggies and a lychee lemonade.   Definitely one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  Extremely tasty! 

The chicken was so juicy and perfectly seasoned.  The veggies were cooked perfectly and had a light buttery flavor to them, and the rice was....well....it was rice.  I feel like it would be tastier if it was sticky rice but it was still great.  Portions were very generous.  

Dat lychee lemonade tho....oh wowzers.  Genius combination that I would have never thought of but I loved it.

Yes they have changed the menu up quite a bit. Added crispy chicken along side the grilled chicken. Added several new flavors like Garlic Crispy and Raspberry Chipotle Crispy Chicken Bowls. Gone are the delicious Chicken Tenders.

The food is still good, and the service very nice. The owner actually remembered me and my name even though its been about 2 months and I've grown a full beard. That is really nice for customer service.

I think prices have gone up a little, which is why my review loses a star. Its still a huge portion of food, I got the veggies too and it totalled about $10 and change.

5778781,2014-09-19,2,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"I could be a fan of this place just based on how super sweet the owner Sandra is - I adore her! I think that Mochiko is a great place to get a really generous portion of huge fried chicken breast tenders at a reasonable price. 

But I have to mention that if you're from Hawaii like I am, the name is kind of misleading since this isn't mochiko chicken as we know it. This chicken is dredged and fried in rice flour (mochiko) vs regular flour, but mochiko chicken is supposed to be marinated overnight in basically a teriyaki/mochiko slurry then fried - it's sweet, salty, crispy & delish. So although I think that they make great chicken tenders, I personally don't really consider it ""mochiko chicken"", but that's me.  

So as chicken tenders, I think these are good on value and quality - each piece is at least twice the size of raising cane's sometimes laughably small pieces. The chicken was juicy, lightly crispy and not at all greasy both times. I'm a fatty but I was full from just 2 pieces. 

I had it with rice the first time, fries the 2nd - fries were seasoned but kind of soggy, so I'm sticking with rice from now. I accidentally spilled most of my sriracha sambal aioli onto my rice and it actually goes together really well all mixed up. I think that's my fav sauce so far, but I also liked the mandarin sweet chili. I figured it would be the usual bottled thai chili sauce, but chef maybe makes it from scratch? There were tiny pieces of candied orange peel like he added marmalade - it was a nice surprise.

I rarely drink anything while eating, because...I don't know why. But I can't resist their lychee lemonade - I even got a refill. It's more lychee than lemonade - a big cup of sugary goodness, a lot like Hawaiian Sun drinks. I really shouldn't, but I may have to stop in at least for a cup of this after any TJ visit.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,6,5,4,ihvRIxjyIMvKfGx25e3roQ

5848974,2016-01-16,7,S_5VQYMMa4aD3NzgYLkvhg,"I have been wanting to check Mochiko out for awhile after seeing it on a trip to Trader Joe's in the same strip mall. I was super curious and hungry so I was ready for a taste!

I was greeted by Jacqueline who is just the cutest gal with a sweet and welcoming personality. 

I ordered the fried mochiko bowl $7.99, an ala carte chicken tender $1.29 and ala carte belgian waffle $1.59.

If you order an ala carte belgian waffle as informed does not come with syrup. Hmmm? I like syrup on my waffle so there is an extra charge of 50 cents. My favorite part of the entire meal was the belgian waffle. I could live on those, they are so good. 

The chicken tender was good, juicy and flavorful however did not come with a dipping sauce. Once again it would have been an extra 50 cents. My Mochiko chicken bowl was white rice with breaded fried chicken chunks on top. I assumed from previous yelp photos I had viewed that there would be a sauce on it. My bowl needed something on it for sure in order to enjoy it.

I went and asked the employee if they have any sauce that I can add to my bowl. She replied yes, for what bowl, for the Mochiko bowl she suggested a sweet sauce. Also that will be an additional .50 cents. I had to have it because the bowl would have been too plain to eat without it. There was just too much white rice to have eaten it dry. 

I just feel like all of the items I ordered needed something to complete them, sauce and or dipping sauce. I had the chicken tender , no dipping sauce, belgian waffle, no syrup, mochiko fried chicken bowl no sauce.  

I think they should just increase their menu prices and include the sauce, dipping sauce and or syrup needed to complete the meal. After hearing ""that will be an additional 50 cents"" for the third time I was over the experience. 

I may be back, however I think I will just get the chicken and waffles bowl. At least it will include the two tablespoons of syrup.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,14,9,3,QaRWkJlM3W-LpjSi5p5iwQ

It looks new/renovated. A very nice, clean place to dine in.

It was hard for me to decide what to choose on the menu. Everything seemed like something I'd order! The cashier recommended the chargrilled chicken over their crispy chicken. My husband and I decided to get one of each. The lady was right! I got lucky with my pick. It was so delicious that my husband kept picking at my plate lol.

Anyways, they also had lots of sauces to choose from. This was a plus in my books because I'm all about flavor. They definitely had it here.

I also got to try their ""Lychee Lemonade."" If you come here, this is what you should drink with your meal. It was really good and complimented the food. The flavors just went together!

The only thing I wasn't happy with was their French fries. 
If I honestly had to describe them in one word, ""Basic"" would be the word. We were told that they are seasoned, but all I tasted was some salt. In my opinion, they weren't bad, just not that good.

We ordered a Garlic Mochiko and Spicy Mochiko bowl both with brown rice.  I was a bit surprised that we were asked to pay additional for steamed veggies. I thought that veggies would be automatic but nope, its just for the chicken and rice. The cashier also sneakily upsold me on sauce for both bowls I wasn't paying attention and assumed that it was part of the meal.. So right off of the bat I was not a fan of this place being upsold on veggies and sauce.. 

I am going to be honest and say that the food underwhelmed me.I felt that the standalone bowls are an incomplete meal without the aforementioned upcharge veggies and sauces.It was good mochiko chicken however I feel that the sauces were a little lacking. It is unfair for me to compare the chicken and sauce to the 808 garlic chicken powerhouses back home but unfortunately the tastebuds have a mind of their own and told me that its was just a jab-da-mout and not broke-da-mout good. 
The grilled bowls that a few other patrons ordered looked much more appetizing and a better value.If I am very back in the area I'd be more inclined to try something from the grilled side of the menu.

Stopped by on a Friday afternoon and it was empty. The girl who was behind the register was really nice and recommended the Red Dragon as it was my first time here, I went with a friend and they were also recommended something... sesame chicken? It was $1 more for vegetables. Which was fine because I don't like them, my friend did say yes when they were offered though. 

While waiting for our food the restaurant got a couple customers who ordered for pick up. 
I guess the cashier was overwhelmed because following the small rush she made some kind of  mistake in pretty much everyone's order. 
The cook ended up taking out his own credit card to pay for a meal for one of the customers (....)

You may need to work on customer service, problem solving wise(.........)

The food came out pretty quick and was brought out, she forgot the vegetable in my friends dish and when we asked about it she just simply said she ""didn't put it in the register"" 
Um okay? Didn't offer a solution so we just went back to eating. (I didn't need a receipt since I assumed it was a simple order so I wouldn't know if I was charged for it or not, I guess next time I'll take the receipt...)

Going to the point of this review though.
Chicken has a very special place in my heart and stomach.
Mochiko, you have won my heart, unconditionally. 
The Red Dragon had sort of a ""slap to the face"" kind of seasoning. AMAZIIING!

They are enormous, so a great value for the price. They aren't really mochiko style chicken, but are good. The chicken bowl wasn't very exciting. The chicken was good, but the flavors were on the bland side and I had to add some cole slaw to make it more interesting flavor-wise.
