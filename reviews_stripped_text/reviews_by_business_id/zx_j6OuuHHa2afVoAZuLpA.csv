I got the matcha truffle crepe and I added vanilla ice cream. So so good. In this Vegas heat, you want something refreshing, yummy, and light. This checks all of them!! Even though I had ice cream and little chunks of ice cream, it was so satisfying- I didn't feel so groggy. 

Check this place out! The pricing for the crepes range between 6 to 8 dollars before any add ons! It's a pretty comparably cheaper price than to most shops/cafes I've been to",kOT_C9B-dGITaK_vpBeYNg,1,1,5,tYx7B4eq1_9B3XwSXw9AHg

3041375,2018-05-04,13,zx_j6OuuHHa2afVoAZuLpA,"I feel pretty down about it but I have to give this place 3.5 stars. 

First and foremost, my sister and I walked in feeling unwelcome. The two employees did not crack a smile and just stared at us. It seemed as though we interrupted a deep conversation. As awkward as it got, we both looked at the menu before ordering and the guy didn't explain the menu. I tried ordering the Mont Blanc which consists of chestnut cream, strawberries, and wafers. The employee said they were out. 
He then suggested the crème brûlée crêpe but I opted for the Mango Mille crêpe and my sister chose the Oreo Swirl with Matcha ice cream. He asked if we wanted toppings and we were confused because the ice cream is under toppings. I could tell he got irritated and asked us if we were getting any drinks. It's kind of like asking me if I want a side of fries with my order. If he wanted me to get a drink, he could have did a quick run through of the menu. Maybe suggest what has been popular rather than trying to have us spend more. With tip, the two crêpes came out to $17. 

Oreo Swirl: The crêpe itself was nice and thick. It was layered with Nutella and cream. The scoop of Matcha ice cream was delicious.

Mango Mille: The mangoes were sweet and the cream paired very well with it. The crunch from the toasted coconut gave the crêpe some nice texture. 

The crêpes are great but the customer service needs some work.",C_CqWSkpn2aOnUXtHx0-iw,31,26,4,fEhXgLSU8WbeW_wW2r_rhg

The cashier suggested us the Creme brûlée crepe, which is their most popular item. We also ordered the strawberry cream and pineapple cheese cap smoothie. There were few people ahead us, so we waited like about 15mins to get our orders. 

Creme brûlée - the presentation was great, the cream tasted fresh and not too sweet, I love how they added some crunchiness in the crepe. The creme brûlée itself was delicious, it came out with a little warmness. The crepe overall was not too sweet which is perfect for me. 

Strawberry Cream- the cream and strawberry are both tasted very fresh, but I would add some toppings with this one next time. Their crepe is not traditional soft crepes, it was little crunchy on the edge and chewy at the bottom, and I can tasted the smell of butter in the crepe. 

Pineapple cheese cap- I was surprised that pineapple smoothie goes very well with jasmine green tea. I can tell they used fresh pineapple, this is my favorite drink now. 

Overall, this place is great, but you just have to wait for a bit if they get busy, as they only have two employees. I will definitely come back next time to try out other flavors.",8lCsIlP2DJ5PRI33CPnVnQ,4,3,5,cCzki4J8ubuDRQztXUbiSg
