I ordered online, which says they close at 845, I selected delivery and went through the entire order process. About 5 to 7 minutes later I get a phone call saying I placed my order after 830, (he said 834 to be exact) which is when they stop delivering, so I could come pick it up if I still wanted it (even though online says 845). Funny thing is, the time stamp on the email confirmation I received said 829, which means my order was placed before 830. I don't like lazy and a good business goes out of their way for the customers.

375716,2016-07-17,0,kd1VNJdd92T2eQ4hqvYQ5A,"My order was wrong and I am still giving them 5 stars!! A restaurant can have great food and fail due to poor service, Above the Crust need not worry about that! 
I ordered off of Eat24, as my child was throwing a fit and making it impossible to have a conversation on the phone. I chose the chicken fingers, garlic knots and the 2 slice special (one w/ pepperoni and sausage the other plain cheese) that also comes with a 20oz drink. I was not kept waiting long! My delivery driver (I did not get his name) was friendly and did not make me feel rushed trying to hand off food as some do. I noticed he had no drink in his hands. Right away he apologized, the problem it wasn't printed on the ticket so he wasn't aware my order needed a drink. He offered to go back and get it, as tonight is my soda night and I really wanted that soda so I readily agreed. He was still so friendly (most drivers get a little attitude when they have to go back for something so small)
I go to dig into the pizza and realize that I got 1 sausage slice and 1 pepperoni slice instead of 1 w/ both and the other just cheese. I call to see about getting it corrected as my kid can only have cheese pizza. Once again the most friendly service. They get it set up to be resent. When my doorbell rings I am expecting my previous driver with my drink and corrected pizza, what I got was the OWNER. He wanted to personally apologize about the mix up! Anytime the owner communicates with customers just shows how much they really care about their business, the fact that he got in his car to bring me my pizza and 20oz drink is AMAZING!
Now let's get to the food! The chicken fingers were phenomenal (I am a self proclaimed chicken finger snob) my kid couldn't get enough of them! I don't know if they are freshly made or frozen (as they are really uniform in appearance I am leaning towards frozen) either way they are awesome! The garlic knots had the perfect ratio, not too garlicky not too doughy. The pizza was delicious! I am a ranch lover... The ranch here is soooooo good! I could literally just spoon it up by itself!
I would recommend this place on the food alone but I will rave about this place for their service! My advice to you fellow yelpers, call in to order. As the Eat24 order gets a little mixed up when put into their system. GREAT PLACE!!",pfNoPKGu--M7o9-m2e5QJQ,0,0,5,08_-E06KaEBOC1wuGAgHUQ

So far this is the only place in Vegas that I have found that knows how to perform this east coast magic.

644080,2014-01-29,0,kd1VNJdd92T2eQ4hqvYQ5A,"Came here last Friday night based upon the Yelp reviews and it was convenient. We got the large AC special pizza for $18.95. The toppings were green bell peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni. The sausage was round and thinly sliced like pepperoni is. The portion of sauce was okay, not skimpy but not overly generous. The sauce had a slightly sweet flavor to me, which I didn't prefer. Tasted home mad though but still doesn't necessarily mean it is excellent merely because it is home made. 

We took it home so I can't judge whether the crust was crispy or not - we heated it back up when we got home prior to eating on a pizza stone so the crust was crispy. So overall decent thin crust pizza, not on par with Lombardi's in NYC or such but decent. I am a thick crust girl but as thin crust goes I prefer the thin crust (and thick crust) over at Dom Demarco and I personally think that is more ""authentic"". The caveat being I am not from NY but I have ate my way through it.  

I think the price is a little steep for what you are getting but I am glad I tried something new. I wasn't thrilled with the ambience in the restaurant, that was the deciding factor in taking it home. They tried to make it a warm, fresh venue with the paint and decor, however, the acoustics were poor and although there were only a few people in the restaurant it seemed loud.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,3,MliYPblIg1DOgzLeYZxx2A

The pizza has a very good crispy crust and a good amount of cheese and sauce.  The sauce is a tad bit on the sweet side but at least it has flavor which I can't say about other pizza joints in the area.  The only thing that is holding them back from a 5 star review is I felt they could've added more pepperoni to the pizza.  They're kind of cheap when it comes to toppings.

We have since tried most pizza places in our area and continued to not be happy: soggy crust, bottled ranch dressing, crappy service, cardboard tasting pizza. I know it sounds like we are picky, but truly we're not. After our friend/hairdresser, Rachael Jackson, owner of Backstage Salon swore to us that Above The Crust was worth another try so we ordered. And boy am I glad we did. Great service from the ordering process to our sweet upbeat delivery driver. The pizza was perfectly done; sauce that had actual flavor and fresh toppings yum! We also ordered the fried zucchini which came with marinara sauce that was excellent and homemade ranch dressing! The zucchini was also perfectly done and plentiful. Now we feel like jerks for snubbing this awesome place!

Firstly, the restaurant is located in a small strip mall with some funky parking.  Went in, was impressed with the cleanliness and it certainly smelled wonderful.  Hubby was hungry, so he ordered the chips and dip, 2 garlic rolls, and a large pizza.. I quickly changed it to a small pizza, and I'm doubly glad that I did.

Chips and dip arrived - hubby thought they were both fantastic.  I thought they were good, but hardly ""life altering"".  The chips are homemade, no salt on them, and fried until hard.  They're too thick to be called crispy.  The dip was called Ranch and it was all you tasted.. Ranch dressing.  If there were other seasonings in there, they were lost.

Then the pizza arrived, and we reminded the guy about our garlic rolls.  He quickly returned with 2 foil wrapped rolls.  Hubby opened his and tasted it immediately.. then set it down and never picked it up again.  He said it was cold and boring, so I didn't open mine at all - not going to waste time on something that bad.

The pizza toppings were fresh and the crust was crispy.  Not thin, not thick, but sturdy.  However, the sauce had virtually no seasonings to it - a frozen pizza generally has more flavor than this did.  There was a shaker of oregano and another of garlic located with the shakers of pepper flakes and dried parmesan cheese.. once those were added, then it was okay.  I have serious issues with a pizza that has to be seasoned afterwards.. isn't that the cook's job?

I had one slice, hubby had two.. and we tossed half the small pizza as not worth saving.

On a plus note, the fountain coke tasted great ;)",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,5,2,2,a_QwuuFMHL4y7RC7UpUQiA

Once I removed the spinach ball from the calzone, it was decent.
We also ordered a buffalo chicken pizza along with buffalo chicken fingers. That pizza was a disappointment because it was only a cheese pizza with cut up buffalo chicken fingers on it. Where's the blue cheese crumbles? The side of hot sauce? It was just so-so. The crust was good.

They have great specials that they post on Facebook. The large pizza and wings for 24.99 was an amazing deal. The pizza was too big for the box and the wings were plentiful. They give tons of homemade ranch and even threw in some garlic knots. It's best eaten there but even to go this is the best pizza I have had in a long time and certainly the best in northern Vegas!

I had heard about the pizza and just had to try it for myself, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. Some places slather on way to much sauce and it drowns out the other flavors as well as making the crust almost inedible, but not this place. Let's start with the crust (since that's where all pizza begins), just the right amount of doughyness and crispy outer edge, that perfect flavor that melds with the sauce, the cheese and just the right amount of toppings for that explosion of flavor in your mouth. I happen to be a real bacon nut, and I have to say I'm not sure what kind of bacon they use, but it sure was full of flavor, and pieces the size that when I bit into bacon I tasted bacon, not everything around it but the bacon. The service tonight was really good, they definitely know how to take care of their customer. One little extra is the fact that you can stand at the glass and watch as they make your pizza, not always important to some people, but I really like the fact they don't disappear into the ""magic kitchen"" and come out with the piping hot pizza. This is a GRRREAT place for taking a small group of say 10 to 14 people (we had 13 and no problem with seating for everyone), so if you're looking for a place to take your friends, family or co-workers be sure to check this place out.",jejZ6Iem9UqYlO-m4TeaEg,1,0,5,OLo_FPIFUYk6dLuPjvdcQg

2237419,2015-07-06,1,kd1VNJdd92T2eQ4hqvYQ5A,"Going for the most objective review possible here. Maybe an average of 4 stars for this place means we just came on a bad day? Then again, when you're using bread roll dough from a can to make your ""garlic knots,"" where can I really start? 

Their self-admitted frozen zucchini coins and mozzarella sticks (we tried the latter of the two) with premade marinara and ranch dips were probably the best things they serve. Then again, I can always grab a box from the freezer section at the store and do the same at home.

We ordered the Greek specialty pizza, which is listed on the menu as having spinach, (black) olives, feta, and mozzarella. What they fail to mention is that it's a white pizza - one with a cream sauce instead of marinara. This made it very difficult to eat, extremely salty, unbalanced, and more like overdressed cheese bread than anything else. The crust reminded me of one you'd get from the grocery store freezer section as well. 

Took the remaining pieces (there were 6 out of 8 left from our ravenous group of 3) in two small pizza boxes to give to the homeless on our way home.

I wish I could say that the price point or service was their saving grace, but that would be a lie. They open at 11am on Sundays, we came in at 2pm and the chairs were still atop all but ones of the tables. The woman who took our order seemed nice enough (this is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1), but is absolutely lacking knowledge about the kitchen in which she stands and was nowhere to be seen the majority of the time that we were there.

Well, they made an attempt, albeit half-assed, at opening a hip pizza place. My tip? A little more quality and time put into making the food yourselves will go a long way. Until then, this was our first time there ... and our last.",TNR3A1YCcg14M_Zx55HUkg,1,0,2,WMy5iNrlZknncs3--4FjxQ

I had a previous positive experience with them a few years back, while I got my nails done at Nail Bar... which is next door. My son got wings and he was able to purchase them himself! I thought that was pretty cool because he must have been about 7 years old at the time so that shows patience in the staff. 
Well today. It was really just blah. I felt like the staff was low key rude. For example the girl passing out the food asked how every one was doing except me. She also seemed to make it a point not to say thank you. Overall the environment was unprofessional the staff was actually eating, socializing and playing around with each other as I patiently waited for my salad.Smh.
So the food... not many healthy choices. I was limited to salads. However some one said that the Salads were good here. I disagree. The salad was gross. The chicken was old, and cold. I asked the girl who passes out food if the chicken was fresh, she claimed it was but it wasn't. It was vile. Almost as if it were old meat that was cooked. The salad dressing was nasty. Chipotle ranch, ewww . The veggies in the salad were blah, but at least they used spinach and arugula. However nothing was fresh as promised  very disappointed and I ended up very hungry because I could not eat the salad enough to satisfy any hunger pangs. Soooooo nasty .
I hear it's a new owner now and the Salads haven't been the same since. Well mine was gross and I won't dare try again.",N_LfdeIdx-gRRrqgVGgxSg,3,0,1,a_EzdnjwIxG6zdjtF3xjYw

Food was ready in about 15 minutes. Pizza was hot and fresh and the pasta dish was enough to feed 3 to 4 people.  Pizza was decent with solid topping distribution. Pizza sauce was ok, it could have had more flavor of herbs and spice I think it came out of a package or can did not taste house made.  Cheese was a decent quality and quantity. The true test of pizza is how does it taste the day after?...or cold. This was not the best day old pizza but not worst either. 

I would brand Above the Crust as real Las Vegas Pizza.  Yes Vegas is now on the map along with NYC AND CHICAGO.  It is a blend of these two styles along with a hint of beach pizza. Just like many other things and ideas in Vegas that are just bought, sold, ripped off, copied, and reinvented to create it's own superficial existence and rebranded as its own style. VEGAS BABY!

Overall Above the Crust was an OK pie, but just cannot compare to all those real mom and pop italian pizzaria's I grew up on in the midwest.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,2,1,3,R4Hlupb6W1gJgs-y4zzMig

Above The Crust is like the little pizza diners seen often in New York and there food is good enough for the big apple, but I'm glad it's here in sin city. It's a counter service restaurant but if you're dining in they will happily bring your meal to your table. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and their food is delicious and fairly priced. They have different weekly deals and lunch specials to fit any budget. You can watch them cook your food on the open kitchen.
I ordered a garlic roll, a pepperoni roll, the meatball Strom boli and the Italian nachos. The nachos come on a big plate, house made sliced and fried potatoes. They are piled high with Genoa salami, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese. They come along side a serving of ranch and marinara sauce. The garlic roll is flaky and warm and tastes great with the ranch, my favorite of the sauces, the pepperoni roll is the only reason they didn't get a five star. It's just as amazing as the garlic roll but the pepperoni inside was cold.
Last but not least is the meatball stromboli, it's about as long as my forearm, perfectly cooked, and dusted with parmesan cheese. The dough gives just the right amount of resistance to not get soggy and hold up to the perfectly melted mozzarella cheese, marinara sauce and meatballs that fill it. It has all the great flavors of a meatball sub stuffed inside a cheesey stromboli.

It was very tasty with fresh toppings.  New York style pizza.  The wings I would not recommend, they had this breading on them and taste like wings you heat up at the grocery store in the frozen section. 

Their ranch was a unique blend and very good.  I will definitely be back but will try the garlic knots.  Those are supposed to be good.

Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day!

I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple ""Garlic Rolls"" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

4386038,2018-04-26,0,kd1VNJdd92T2eQ4hqvYQ5A,"--- Updated after Sicilian received, April 26, 2018 ---

I ordered the somewhat pricey Grandma's Sicilian with 3 toppings with tip for a hefty $38-ish total (delivered).

It is quite possibly the worse pizza I have had in Las Vegas.

I am heartbroken. I took pictures of what appears to be a large square cracker with a little bit of dough and toppings over-cooked on top of it.

With Grand Pizza removing their vastly superior Sicilian from their menu, there are apparently no options for the north part of the Vegas metro area.

I'd get the calzone again, but I guess I will proceed with caution. I'm tempted to toss the whole pie, it's that bad.

--Final edit on this ""Sicilian"" travesty : my grandmother was Sicilian. I'm from New Jersey. I've had pizza in Italy, New York, and various other fine places... I did end up throwing most of this pizza in the garbage. I would like my money back. 

I won't post the pictures I took of it here as I'm sure the other menu items are worthy of the praise they've received (again, I loved the baked and fried calzones). No need to add insult to injury. This order was a mistake on my part.


--- Updated April 26, 2018 ---

Just checked, Grandma's Sicilian now visible on mobile and desktop web browser views on the online order menu.

I'm hoping this replaces the no-longer-available Sicilian from another local pizza place after they removed it from their menu. Given the calzone  from AtC (see the rest of this review) I've got high hopes!",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,0,0,2,BzZbhsbdxsyN1D9FOALFnA

It pretty much covers everything on a checklist you would have for a pizzeria (if you had one). Giant pizza slices? Check. Large food portions? Check. Decent enough pricing where you're in awe with the amount of food you get, but not low enough to worry about the sanitation rating of the place? Check. Friendly staff? Check. Yes, you get the picture. 
Most of the pizzas are premade, so if you don't want nothing fancy you can pick a slice and they warm it up and serve it to you. If you want a whole pizza to go, they are fairly quick with making it, though it's best to order a head of time.

My theory is that it is easy to hide terrible pizza in toppings.  I was genuinely sad to taste this pizza. How does a place get 4.5 stars on yelp. Flavorless crust, bottom basement sauce. In one word ""disappointing "".",P3o0laPBtlxyGD_GA3OGIw,2,0,2,cJGtivd45r98BmyJBmBYTw

So I called and they sent my fingers another 35 minutes later with no ranch and they were soggy with hard chunks of cartilage...no accommodations for messing up ,just an apology which I would have understood, everyone makes mistakes but the quality of food just wasnt good..I'm very disappointed and will likely not be going back here.If you want quality try sabitinos on Cheyenne and buffalo ,They are the real deal and you wont be disappointed!",WcKxOcMTKZSTORbIv61tbA,0,0,1,-koGy23Aj3LM_jjZZzB2Ww

Maybe if we had gotten them there and it had them delivered they'd be better. We also got a garden salad with the Italian dressing. It was really good. The dressing was a very robust delicious Italian. The spinach calzone was delicious. Cooked perfectly. The marinara sauce that went with it though was watery and rather bland. The AC special pizza was good. The dough is great and key for a good pizza in my book.

Its about the Pizza...and well the pizza is darn good! We enjoy the calzone and stromboli as well. They are huge and sooo cheesy. The garlic knots are fantastic, tons of flavor...perfect with the garlic ranch. Tonight we enjoyed the chicken cordon bleu pizza...outstanding!

The boyfriend is a pickier eater, preferring plain (boring) cheese pizza. Luckily, the staff had no problems letting us ordering half of one type of pie, and half of another. The first time we got a half veggie, and while the veggies and crust were slightly undercooked for my liking, it was adequate. The second time we got a half Greek with red sauce, and it was delicious (they didn't skimp on the spinach and everything was piping hot).

The garlic knots are delicious. They taste a lot like Villa Pizza's, which is actually a compliment because those food court rolls are my comfort food. I swear, I could survive off those alone!

Disclaimer: you can not leave without getting the fried cheesecake. Covered in cinnamon and sugar and fried to perfection, it's a real treat.

The portions are ginormous! A simple side salad was overflowing with fresh greens. A side of fries filled a full-sized plate. Two people could feast for less than $20.

I love that they're flexible and down to earth. They let us move tables around for a large group and were accommodating with tweaking orders.

Down to earth set up, affordable prices, and a polite and quirky staff make this place great. I'm giving it a 3 for now, because my first trip was less than memorable, but we'll definitely be back to see if they continue to be as great as they were the second time around.",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,2,0,3,fmpDFqg4kVM0sCT84p47Mg

Their white pie is simply amazing with lots of flavor and just the right amount of garlic. The crust has just the right amount of crunch but still soft in the center. 
Forget chain pizza places like Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns or Little Cesar's 
Needless to say that this is now our go to pizzeria as a family.
