Generally long waits at this location. The staff is rushed and makes mistakes due to understaffing. They have forgotten to make my order in the past. I've seen one staff member right outside the front door smoking - not very appetizing. If possible, come early or avoid this location altogether.",HFdLRhmYRFd0LJhQGulcIQ,0,0,3,1khDtWcXJOKe0ywI00SrsQ
2182261,2012-11-29,0,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"A solid place to grab a quick lunch, drink, or snack in between classes.  This Einsteins is located inside the Science and Engineering building, right across from Ham Hall, and is reasonably quiet (at least whenever I've visited).  Service is usually good, from what I've experienced.

The con: they're usually out of whole wheat bagel thins!  Come early to snag one.",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,0,0,3,Gujr7hCES3wpyMzGzCq1aw
2298685,2015-10-07,1,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"Both times I've eaten here the staff took an eternity to make my bagel. The food wasn't enjoyable.
Don't go here if you have a break during class; you won't make it back in time and the packaging they use for your order is ridiculously loud and crinkly.
The morning ladies don't care at all and it shows.",sx42VBfY0CcMolxcFKUChA,0,0,1,bR-rC4d4ZHwt370zSiSQgQ
3542781,2016-09-27,0,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"The main reason I come here is for coffee. About three times out if the six I have come here for coffee they either don't have it brew or its the wrong one . I usually get the neighborhood  blend non decaf.  Its sad to say this but I used to love Einstein Bros Bagels and now I am looking into finding a different place just because they never have the basics. I picked the neighborhood  blend because I enjoy the taste. The other options simply don't work out for my palate.  

They have an variety of sandwiches, but honestly the only reason its always busy its because its conveniently located next to a parking structure. 

This place doesn't't give a side with your lunch order so have that in mind.",k9sxdmwz1ky0TXgjNSCM4Q,0,0,1,5QnwiECz9OJvAPmlV92HqA

3825964,2017-02-22,0,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"This location is convenient and since it is on campus it makes it easy for students to eat here. It is located inside the SEB (science and engineering building.) They have the same menu as other Einsteins locations. Depending on what time you guy it can get very busy. It is going to take longer for you to get your food if it is busy. So I recommend going early, or at a time when everyone is in class, or when students leave.

The service depends on who is working that day. Usually when I go they are very sweet and sometimes joke around with you. I noticed on days at the end of the week they might run out of items. But it doesn't happen often. It is a good option if you want to avoid the craziness in the SU. You can also study here.",e7o1IGApDU8ZmFfGWOepbA,1,1,3,9UVdT5--GaT_-cccETzJ1w
3899017,2014-08-11,0,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"My 2nd time in this store and it never failed to amaze me was it's a busy store yet 2 crew on the line; 1 registry available. And a crappy customer service. (Sorry I am not bashing, this is just how it is.) no smiles, no greets, no thankyou's. And to think they're actually besides a bank (a connecting door is just besides it) the store ambience and the size was a plus yet they're lacking of customer device and crew. I'll follow up again next time maybe they'll be better so I give them a 1 star.",65dRqbsRfwQvc9GxH5kbBA,1,0,1,xh44EJPYVWa8O_EcDI65bA
4216042,2018-02-24,2,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"Tried to buy a dozen plane bagels, they had about 18 and would only sell us 5... how 5... said they would be sold out too quickly if she sold us 12... So, rather than sell us 24 bagels we purchased ZERO... now she may not be smart enough to understand that 24 bagels at 1:40 in the afternoon must be a pretty large sale but hope that someone reading this will think it would have been... even if it's not a big sale a guaranteed sale of 24 has to be better than a MAYBE sale of the 18 they had???",EXIQIhp7pD7j4KaMKiXkxQ,0,0,1,By3I6dy7K0pgKl7sVBbBtw

4686638,2016-09-02,0,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"This place is located in the SEB building. Its best to go during class & not during pass time cos it gets SUPER busy. The wait time depends on how long the line is but usually if the line is short, they get your stuff out to you pretty quickly! 

Some employees are pretty cool, but others can be rude at times. It's really hit or miss. 

I always get an Asiago bagel with light jalape√±o salsa cream cheese! It's delicious!! I get it light cos if you don't say light... They practically dump half of the tub of cream cheese in there.",WPcEBAbrPZxvCGlvH9XLsQ,2,1,3,H-wKikxbHqufUnoFGeU-Xg
5054011,2014-01-30,0,h0fQdldYxuG1Utc_ZK1z0A,"Need a quiet place to study away from the hustle and bustle of the SU?! Einstein Bros is probably your place then! 

Usually running rampant with science nerds and coffee lovers, EB is definitely a place to chillax and study without running into annoying talkers..or people who laugh too obnoxiously! 

Honestly, it is a good place to grab a blueberry muffin and a coffee; and then sit down and study with your laptop. I'll admit, their coffee is not the greatest..and neither is their food. Yet, you have to remember: You grabbed CAMPUS FOOD!!!! On-campus food is usually never better than it's ""out of campus"" counterparts! (Let's be honest.) 

But their blueberry muffins are one of the best nearby, I recommend that! 

Also, their service is pretty good. I have never had a bad experience because they treat their customers pretty well! 

HUGE TIP: Learn to share your table with strangers; it's college! :)",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,3,0,4,phw9rotvz9yowSGIOTp-ng
