I can't say enough about the service we received.  Let's talk about the food.  The food was amazing!  Delicious, and flavorful, the prices are great as well.  Most things on the menu don't break the 15 dollar mark.  The quality for what you pay for is awesome.  We had an opportunity to meet Chef Mo.  He is hilarious and friendly, even if he is a Philadelphia Eagles fan.  (I'm a Falcons fan).  All in all our experience was top notch.  The decor is modern and stylish, everyone is friendly, the food is delicious and the dessert is out of this world!  If you are anywhere near the Orleans, visit this restaurant.  It will be worth it.

Arrived at the restaurant and there was about 6 others eating at the location so I figured service would be pretty good. Ordered a beer which took forever due due the bartender attempting to flirt with the two twenty year old females sitting at the bar. Bartender finally served my beer and it sat there for another ten minutes as the waitress was no where to be found. 

Finally my beer arrived to my table which I have to say was pretty good tasty!! 

Food came out and was extremely tasteless and barely warm.  I'm not the type to complain and l was in a hurry. 



I'll never be returning to the location again gave it a two star due to the good music they had playing and the beer tasted great!!",_7AHjaIHHZQ_8CQn2Lq_Iw,0,0,2,cXjVkV16hVUfhucq4dZJlQ

For the entr√©e, I had the fish and chips....by far, the best around! 
   Coupled with the great live music and the atmosphere, Bailiwick is the place to go! They even have games to play such as pool and others!

We got the most attention from a busser who took our initial drink order when we were waiting on others and came back a few times to check on us. The server, Ashly, was inattentive and not knowledgeable about anything on the menu. She also had horrible time management and a bad attitude. Everything took forever and she had no sense of urgency. When asked about drinks on the menu her reply was that she doesn't drink here. Our drinks were left at the bar until someone else finally brought them to us. One drink didn't come with the others and when asked she said it was at the bar and she'd be back. She then brought drinks to other people and we watched her talk to multiple other tables until bringing the drink which she then apologized for saying the bartenders were slammed even though there were two of them and the restaurant was not very busy. The manager came to help change the channel and seemed to be inebriated and was very unprofessional towards us giving us some attitude about the baseball game we wanted on. In general the staff all seemed pissed off about being there and like us being there was burdening them in some way. Overall this restaurant would be much better if the staff had had better attitudes and learned time management.

The weekend happy hour has changed again. Now it's 4-6. Missed out on that. Started with the fish tacos which are a seared tuna. Absolutely delicious. After that the rest went downhill. Got the Bailiwicked Shrimp and Not Your Nachos. The shrimp were over cooked and the sauces were nothing 
special....just a regular honey mustard, a sriracha mustard, & cocktail sauce. The nachos were terrible. It was like they took all their leftover chips & through them together. There were pepper chips, salt & vinegar, and plain. The ghost pepper cream had no heat to it at all & overall the whole
dish tasted like seasoned salt. We ate it but shouldn't have. Both of us complained about it to each other the whole time but still ate it...,,terrible mistake!

1335354,2017-01-23,2,axX1hO_lEn9C-na3mMN4Aw,Bad customer experience. Bottom line. Won a gift card with a very short expiring date. My wife called and spoke to management and they said it was OK to use if we planned to come at a later date.  She spoke to Karina who said her manager Joe said it was OK extend it. This was because we didn't know when we were returning to Vegas. We really wanted to use for the dinner menu since that was the only good part that looked good. But everytime we had been in Vegas or were ready to redeem the GC they were either closed or had only there appetizers menu. Today we finally came in and by chance it was the last day to use but we were not hungry.  We had eaten at another hotel hours earlier since we did not want to wait til 4pm and we were completely hungry at check out 12 noon.  Somehow we made it over to orleans after completing our business and to gamble at our usual tables. After we finished we were still not hungry so we said let's stop by baliwick to confirm that we can extend the use of the gift card. We met the manager Joe to confirm if we can extend the use of the gift card for a later date and he suddenly changes his story from what he told my wife and said today is the deadline and we can extend until Monday.  Then he started rambling on about how he is hungry and some other weird dialogue. I had to stop him and correct him  and asked him what does that have to do with me? Suddenly he snaps out of his weird talk. Despite the efforts to explain in plain English that we tried in good faith to use but they were either closed or pass the dinner menu which ends at 10pm.  Somehow the other manager TJ tried to say that if you were hungry you should of just used it and get the appetizers.  Again we explained we don't live in Vegas and we come when we can. We really wanted to try the food and of course if it was great we would add them to our list of places to eat other then TGIF at orleans and other places in Vegas. In the end it was not worth fighting over $50 and we gave the gift card to a group of women that were celebrating at the bar. I sincerely hope they got to benefit and enjoy the GC where we could not. It was the principle of offering the gift card as it was like an invitation to come try them out. Some how it looks like Joe doesn't look to happy there and he was hanging by the corner looking down and out. I dont want to repeat what my wife said about him and the situation. BTW. The place does not look to busy and I can maybe guess why. Looks like they are bleeding money here. These folks were so nice when they gave out the GC but there attitude changed when it came time to use the card or tried to use. Again my concern is the management who should have tried to make it right instead of there poor excuses or trying to force us to eat when we were not hungry.  Our concern is not the food or drinks which I'm sure are great.  Bottom line they earned two less customers who are regulars at the Orleans and numerous Vegas events.  Not sure if this review will help others in there research for a great place to eat or not. I highly doubt we will hear from the folks at baliwick since there's nothing else to say.,nPYTEB1aABKNzRpjrMMhsw,0,0,1,t5iJVOk8GJ70_f5NoyzF5g

The service is spectacular. Michelle our server was awesome! She made sure we were well taken care of. She had knew the menu well and made several drink and food recommendations. I appreciated having her work with us for the evening.  

Since this place is new it wasn't too busy. I think this place is perfect for the locals and for those of you who like to venture off the strip. Inexpensive and great eats. The food is well priced; ranging from $8-$20 from appetizers to plates. Menu is simple. I suggest sharing the appetizers.

It's an upscale bar / restaurant with modern industrial style in the menu that has enough comfort food to be good, enough twists to be interesting, and not so pretentious or expensive that you wouldn't just drop in for lunch or dinner.

Loved the live music. They were very talented musicians, however if you want to have any kind of conversation, ask specifically for the dining room. If they put you in front of the stage, you won't be able to hear yourself talk.

The prices are solid mid-range. Everything we ordered was fresh, not just reheated frozen like at a chain restaurant. The portions were big, but other than a pile of pasta that we saw sailing by, nothing appeared to be overly supersized. The quality of food is excellent for the price.

We can also vouch that all the barrel aged cocktails are excellent, although each is distinctly different.  The old fashioned was our favorite, and the Blood & Sand was a pleasant surprise. The Manhattan was also very good, it just happened to come in 3rd out of 3. 

They had nice pool tables and sports screens everywhere. We were impressed enough to already talk about coming back. 

Our server Ashley was excellent.  From the initial drinks through appetizers, dinner and dessert cocktails, she was great. Always there when we needed her, and didn't get in the way of our conversation.",O11n5wP5sq_NtxEGF6dwMA,0,1,4,Y-timp0tmmCwPRROlaIReQ

Bailiwick fell extremely short of this expectation. I ran in with a group of friends for a quick bite, ordered a basic dish, chicken wings, only to find once the food was received, there were chicken feathers still attached to the chicken wings. Upon asking our waitress (who did a very good job serving us) how chicken feathers could be still attached to the wing, was told they receive their battered chicken from an outside party. The basic premise of a fried wing is extremely simple, leading me to ask- why outsource that duty to a third party, especially for the price of the dish to know it wasn't fresh. This restaurant did not live up to my basic expectation of fresh, properly prepared food.

The first time I asked for the aioli for the burger to be served on the side. It came dry with no sauce. The runner dropped the food and left. I flagged the server and she told me that the pesto coming with my husband's burger was the aioli. Really?  Obviously she didn't want to go to the kitchen to get it. She also knew nothing about the wines and was not willing to get answers.

I was in Vegas for work and wanted a place to have a few drinks without having the congestion of the strip. Upon my arrival, I wasn't greeted by the server. I think his name is Bill - a big guy with no personality whatsoever. I asked for a beer recommendation and he gave me the most awful beer ever. He never offered the food menu and never asked how I was doing or if I need another drink (it wasn't busy at all). Luckily for me, he left after 20 minutes and Bones replaced him.

We first discovered this pretty pub while hanging out with relatives who were staying at the Orleans Casino. They had other meetings to attend, so we checked out Bailiwick's brews and food. After we raved about it all and shared photos with the relatives, they went the next day and were so  happy with their experience. Another visit was during the 175th anniversary celebration of Pilsner Urquell, a Czech lager that hubby enjoys. A special keg (or kegs) was flown in and tapped for the occasion, with a lot of nice giveaways for customers.

A few nights ago, we stopped in after a concert and made it just in time to order before the kitchen closed at midnight. It was also during their ""reverse social hour"" (10pm to close), so we could again have the reuben eggrolls, warm salted pretzel with a cheese fondue sauce, and wings--all with frosty mugs of the Pilsner Urquell and Stella. When we got our bill, I was happily surprised that it was just a little over $40 for all the food and beer we ordered. Now that's a great happy hour! They have an earlier, typical social hour of 4pm to 6pm.

The Fab, the band that Saturday night, was so much fun, playing a mix of 60s/Beatles hits. For those who have the music in you, there's a small dance floor near the stage if you feel like shaking your booty.

Each time we've been there, the food has been hot and delicious, the brews cold and prompt, and our servers have been hard working and attentive. There are pub height tables and booths, plus a dining area if you would rather enjoy your meals with more table-top square footage. We like the appetizers/bar snacks, but there are also full meals (like pasta or even schnitzel), sandwiches, burgers, salads, soup and the like. The pub is easy to get to, especially if you park near any of the southwest corner entrances to the casino.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,2,5,a3hlz39NNystMuin7XSOyA

We were still waiting on other guests to arrive, but were then rudely told that if we did not order soon, we would then be kicked out. The waitress we had was very irritable and passive aggressive. It seemed as if she did not want to serve us, making our experience there even worse than it already was. Once we received our food we were only checked on once to order desserts prior to receiving the bill. Maybe it was an off day for the employees at the time, but the customer service should be maintained at all times.

The service itself wasn't the best. I'm not sure if they were low on servers but the guy who waited on us kept forgetting things: drinks, didn't check on us for a while, we asked him for something and he forgot again so we had to find someone else, and i think one of the managers was working on something nearby and didn't bother to jump in...so that kind of put a damper in the dinner but one of the hostesses saved the day. As for the food, it was amazing. A good variety on the menu- options for the kids who can be picky, vegan grandpa was able to eat and enjoy it, and tasty desserts for those who have a sweet tooth, like me. The little mini donuts are a must try but the graham cracker/S'mores was way too sweet.

I got fish and chips. It was excellent. Not only was the fish very good, but the chips were to die for. These are the thick, steak fry type. It is always important to me to get hot fries. The thicker ones don't cool off as quickly, and stay at the proper temperature. Maybe it was also luck that they turned out so good. In addition, the cole slaw was also a huge plus. They added green peas to the cole slaw, possibly as a nod to the traditional side dish of mushy peas that I am told they have in England instead of cole slaw. Fortunately I was not in England, because I wouldn't touch mushy peas with a ten foot pole. Cole slaw is the way to go as a side dish for fish and chips in my opinion, but the peas made it better.

I was made to feel that I shouldn't be in this restaurant . The Bartender didn't seem very courteous and the manager s question to the Bartender who is this guy.
I'm African American I dress nice carry my self well and I'm a nice person. I guess
The Perception  that the Bartender and the Mgr had of me was that I was Gay . Well Yes I am 
Any ways I lost my appetite didn't finish my meal  paid my check and I left. I know their conversation wasn't my business but if someone is referring to me as a distraction and all I'm doing is eating my 
Meal . I asked one of the waiters was there a problem ?  I've worked  in customer service for 40yrs
I thought well if they wanted to know who I was they should have approached me and asked. Instead they had to reveal there ignorance stereotyping their guest
My waitress was great
But as the Bartender stated we don't want this to become a Gay Hangout
If he only knew

It's 2017.

Bailiwick finally got me to visit the hotel while the rodeo was in town and I wanted to try something new. I really should have written this review right after my visit, but the fact that this place still leaves a very positive impression weeks after says a lot. 

Josh was my server and he was pretty funny - he had my husband cracking up every time he checked in, all while keeping my ginger ale cup flowing. We went with a lot of his suggestions - the Carnival Bites were these perfectly fried corn dogs that came with a mustard sauce. As a corn dog connoisseur, this are seriously some of the best I've had.  The sea salt and vinegar chips remind me of the Wolfgang Pick chips and dip, but less pretentious, more flavorful dip, and crispier chips. And the absolute must everyone should have here is the warm butter toffee cake. We went a bit overboard and had the apple crumble that was a rodeo menu item, but just the toffee cake by itself could have filled us up. My husband appreciated that they didn't skimp on the ice cream amount like other places tend to. The bill didn't break the bank and we played some shuffleboard after.

The pub is new and they did a great job of expanding it and adding a stage & sound system. The bands were great, but unfortunately the service during the concerts was terrible. Bartenders were not friendly, slow, and the cocktails were pretty weak. The craft beer selection was good, offering good local beers, but unfortunately over the 5 day event customer service did not get any better, if not worse. On the last day there was actual wait staff on the floor so thought it would make the experience more enjoyable, but it did not. If anything the wait staff seemed annoyed we were there ordering drinks and trying to have a good time. I never tried the food, mostly because I really didn't want to spend any more time than needed at this location.

Seriously the guy blew us off. He had no people skills and was not interested in providing any reasonable service. 

A restaurant can have an amazing selection of beers,  a creative menu, and beautiful decor, but if employees don't like their jobs, the experience becomes ordinary.

We decided to sit at the bar because we like chatting with bartenders. The iPads used for menus are really a cool idea but I find it wasn't entirely user friendly and the one my boyfriend had was stuck on a very dim screen that couldn't be fixed. 

I started off with a glass of wine and he ordered a flight of beer. For food, we ordered the grilled cheese sliders and tomato soup to start. I loved the little sliders. They're so cute and the perfect size for dipping. The tomato soup was very robust too and perfectly compliment the buttery salty sliders. Next, we ordered the ham and cheese flatbread with blue cheese, arugula, prosciutto, with the fig preserves on the side. This was my choice and we almost ordered a second one because it was so delicious! I got the fig preserves on the side because I'm not exactly the biggest fan of preserves to begin with and I was afraid it would overpower the flatbread if it was too sweet. We added the preserves at our discretion and it was perfect to add for just a touch of flavor. 

The live music was great! The guy on guitar was an awesome one-man-band and had us entertained the whole time while he did acoustic rap and Latin songs.

I have to also notate my experience with Joseph the bartender. He's also a Sommelier and I sell wine as a second business so we had a great discussion talking wine, food, and all of his life experience. He was so much fun to talk to.

If you like LOTS of sugar in your food, go there.  

Wrapped Dates.  Blasted with a thick maple glaze that was just over whelming. Nice portion size but just way to sweet.

Brisket Fries.  Very little beef and a ton of sweet, sticky, sugary BBQ sauce.  

New England Seafood Roll.  Three small rolls with approx 2 teaspoons of filling,   Toasted rolls were not fresh.

Garlic Fries.  You could smell them 10 feet away from table.  More garlic then you would need on 5 orders.  

Margherita Flatbread.  The best of all dishes.  Simple, Nice portion.

Atmosphere.  Band was OK.  Ask to put a specific game on TV next to pour table and the waitress came back ans said ""we are trying not to accommodate specific sporting events as we don't really want to be a sports bar.""  As we got ready to leave they changed the channel from music videos to a sporting event!

It was Saturday night at 8PM.  Place was empty.  I think they need to make some serious adjustments to the menu.  Lighter, healthier tapas.  I just don't think making everything so sweet will fly.  Sweet is not  flavor.  It's a cover-up.   They have some interesting items on the menu, but the recipes need some serious adjustments.

And if you are a local using comp points, they must not be a ""casino owned"" restaurant as I was charged full amount off my points rather than the 40% discount the program allows for,",JREfq_w9kucl91pSdGBgvQ,2,0,2,GMw7cUGDtZdZSoQ3ENu0sg

3971594,2017-01-21,6,axX1hO_lEn9C-na3mMN4Aw,"Before a play, I stopped here and used a dining comp.  I was seated in the lounge area which was fine because there was no music at the earlier hour and it was very comfortable seating.  I also got to order off the social hour (commonly known as happy hour) menu.

Wendy was my server and she was a good help.  I asked her about ordering some things, one of which was going to be the poutine.  She recommended skipping the poutine as it was a large dish more likely to be shared.  Instead she gave me some options.  I ordered the carnival bites--their take on corn dogs--and the goat cheese.

I was brought my iced tea quickly and their was a young bus person who continually refilled the tea for me.The carnival bites are good but what makes them good is the honey mustard for dipping the pieces of sausage.  The menu says they're dipped in corn dog batter.  I could discern no flavor from the batter.  The goat cheese was a baked piece of cheese in San Marzano tomato sauce with toast pieces to spread the cheese and tomato sauce on.  Both dishes were OK but the best was yet to come.

For dessert, I got the toffee pudding.  A very nice piece of cake with toffee around the base topped with ice cream and a chocolate stick.  This was very good and was a light ending to the dinner.

The restaurant was quite empty most of the time I was there.  

Location in the casino is where Brendan's Irish Pub and the Asian restaurant next to Brendan's.    It's a large space.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,21,14,3,9NeyIEs_pLT4QP97xTDnpw

They have a decent happy hour, which my date took advantage of ordering the Bailiwick burger while I had the fish n chips (not on happy hour). The only draw back was the burger was clearly rare, bleeding on the plate when he ordered it medium well, but at least they brought a brand new one to resolve the issue. The fish n chips was the best I've ever had, surprisingly. The cod melted in my mouth, and had good clean flavor. They serve with it steak fries which were also satisfying, and coleslaw with bacon bits which was also tasty. 

The service was on point :) I also loved the entertainment, it set such a laid back mood.

4655260,2017-10-26,8,axX1hO_lEn9C-na3mMN4Aw,"Bailiwick promotes itself as the Orleans hub of bites, sips, and sounds. Located by the Orleans west Tropicana Avenue-facing entrance in the former Brandon's and Asian restaurant, Bailiwick is a 9,700 square foot gastropub and entertainment venue. This past week when we spent a week in the New Orleans west of the Strip, we'd visit Bailiwick for bites, sips, and sound.

Taking into account that this is a review based on my experience, I would to give my three cents in on a trend that I don't particularly care for. That trend is detheming unique and entertaining places such as parts of the Orleans. It has been brought to my understanding that the restaurants that the Orleans have been replacing are (supposedly) out of date. I beg to defer. The (supposedly) out of date restaurants that included Brandon's were upbeat places that tied in with the New Orleans theme. Now I will throw my ten cents in. I feel that Bailiwick would be a better gastropub if it had incorporated its industrial, gritty, and millennial environment into an updated New Orleans theme. Now I will give my $25 worth, which was around the price of the dinner writing on my experience at Bailawick.

The first time I set eyes on Bailiwick was when we waited for the Orleans shuttle. The Orleans is promoting this newly opened gastropub to the degree of placing a large Bailiwick sign at the west Tropicana Avenue facing entrance. This caught our attention. 

  Inside the faux city of New Orleans the hub of bites, sips, and sounds is right up the carpeted walkway from the jazzy amorphous alligator statues. The first thing that caught my eyes is the perimeter industrial sash windows fronting an industrial interior. When I left New Orleans and walked inside the gastropub, I felt that I was entering a nightclub more than a gastropub. Maybe it was the leather couches, stage, pool tables, shuffleboard table, black warehouse ceiling, and creme colored floor tiles. Being in the moment, I took in the attention to detail. Right after I stepped inside I noticed the way the center square shaped bar creates a focal point for the far end stage. I likewise felt the positive energy of the New Orleans themed casino permeating the room.

Bailiwick prides itself on being a hub of sips. It is my understanding that their beer selection serves approximately forty different draft beers. In addition to beer, the bar serves cocktails, spirits, and all sorts of booze. However, I teetotaled on this visit opting for a soda.

Bailiwick also prides itself as a hub of bites. By definition a gastropub is a pub that also specializes in good food. Their menu features seven categories of food including sandwiches & sliders, flatbreads, craft burgers and dogs, large plates, and masterful bar and table snacks. From the large plates section I ordered a fish and chips. Speaking of large, in only a couple of months it had a large price increase from $16 to $18. To be honest, $18 is on the pricey side for gastropub fish & chips. Then again you live once. I enjoyed the Alaskan halibut fish and chips. There were three patties on the plate that shared space with fries, malt vinegar, tarter sauce, and pea salad. The pea salad tasted similar to cole slaw. Throughout the meal, the waitress was on the ball with topping off the soda.

Bailiwick finally prides itself as a hub of sounds. Under the dimness of the artisan glass pendant lights, at the beginning of dinner we heard a duo on stage performing soft rock songs. They are one of a few performers that take to the stage every night. It is a stage that is contiguous to the room of hickory table tops and near the hickory wood central rectangular bar.

When I left the gastropub then made my way back into New Orleans, I had a few post dinner thoughts regarding Bailiwick. In my opinion based on first hand experience dining in the new Copper Whisk Cafe, I prefer that Orleans dining option as a hub of bites and sips. However, I say this with a capital ""H,"" if I am in the mood for an alcohol drink or in a socializing situation such as a Yelp UYE, I prefer Bailiwick as my Orleans hub of bites, sips, and sound. My ultimate thought was that the Orleans needs to stop their gradual destruction of a unique and entertaining New Orleans meets Vegas theme by detheming areas of the hotel in the so-called name of progress. Instead the Orleans ought to replace the older restaurants with more improved and contemporary restaurants that complement the New Orleans meets Vegas theme. If that was the case with Bailiwick, I might of given an extra star for creating a unique and charming experience.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,12,3,0uLb-ByEhHPSVsjdaE3V5A
4670109,2018-02-05,0,axX1hO_lEn9C-na3mMN4Aw,"I ate here twice during my stay at the Orleans hotel.  It had a cool look to it and being a gastropub, I knew it was right up my alley.  The 1st night I ordered a Manhattan and some poutine.  The Manhattan was on point and the poutine was pretty decent.  The poutine had the beef debris, cheese curds, gravy and a fried egg on top of a bed of fries.  Everything  was great except the fries themselves tasted like they came out of a bag of Ore-Ida in the frozen food section.  

The 2nd night I came in for a few drafts and a margherita flatbread pizza.  The pizza was awful as it was doughy, flimsy and not cooked all the way.  I should have sent it back because it tasted microwaved.

I say all of this but the place itself is cool.  The bar is nice and there are a ton of TV's to check out the game of your choice.  The drinks are good, the service is on point and they have a ton of fun things to do like trivia, sports radio shows and other fun things.  I may have just picked a few bad items on the menu but if I was every back in the place, I'd probably just stick with the drinks.",9Nx0VL4f_8K6V6yfFLue1Q,0,1,3,zPJtAe8oYsuuDZQL7O1kwg

And Bailiwick is no exception. 45 minute wait when half the tables are empty, 18 minutes for someone to even approach our table to say hello, 14 minutes to get water and another 45 minutes to get horrible food. Not one person who works there cares about their job and everything is too much of an effort. But, this is Vegas where they cater to fat, lazy tourists and local old people.

5544474,2017-06-02,1,axX1hO_lEn9C-na3mMN4Aw,Cool gastropub in the casino with happy hour and lots of rotating taps.  They have happy hour deals on drinks and food.  The bartenders are very helpful with picking out a drink.  Lots of seating though it did fill up during meal times for regular grubbing and drinking.  Theres a stage also with live music at times.,bv5g9xdct8AW3AHQeyn7Lw,2,2,4,C8-l5V-AWNgqwd2_U9Fifg

It's an attractive gastropub, but the service is pretty lacking. Waitress forgot my cocktail. A couple of servers wore sagging pants with ripping shirts.

The meatloaf ciabatta is delicious and I could smell the garlic fries from the kitchen before they brought them to the table. (They were amazing as well.) They have live music almost every night, and it's really great.

When you go check it out, ask for Jhazmin. Great service and she made sure we all had a great time. 

I'll definitely be back again soon.",xALfyynRQS3xpyEWK2jMAA,3,3,5,E7SEUE5jNtQMYpvaZ-1duQ

I do not recommend this place. I love love love nachos, you can't really make bad nachos....well they did. They figured how to make bad nachos. $14 for nachos and so was not worth it. Friends got the ribs and were disappointed, pretzel was very dry. I don't recommend it at all!!",KGoyqSU3j4y6qs9b466tVg,0,0,1,86rDFptMqhV5ETFYM2RJsw

I've had sandwiches and appetizers and not one was bad. They have of the best meat lovers pizzas I've had in a long while. You can't go wrong with garlic fries, get the spicy aioli on the side. The island bar is beautiful and has outlets and USB ports for your electronics. Gene is the best bartender. His recommendations were perfect. Ashley warmed up as we spoke beer terminology. Dragon's Blood stout, La Fin du Monde, Mother Earth Sin Tax Peanut Butter stout, Double Bastard and a ton of other beers are so delicious that you might as well get a room. The hours are a little odd but they do have happy hour drinks and food items.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,2,2,4,bFM0aerETN0Bi-l8z0mmLg

Food always averaged from 3 to 4 out of five. One of our favorites was the sliders with French Toast and fried chicken sliders, but now it's not on the menu anymore. At least, not when we visited there. We also like getting new entrees there and is always a bit disappointed with the taste. Food like brisket fries is something you should probably want to skip. It hardly had any brisket and the fries is chips. WTF. Not a fan. 

The only thing I liked about this place is the entertainment. They always have locals playing amazing music there which heighten the ambiance. But overall, the service is always a miss. The servers take forever to refill your drinks, and you will hardly see them until it's time to pay the bill. Even when you want to pay the bill, it seems like they want to keep you waiting. I'm not sure if they're just understaffed or they need more training, but that's more damage to my experience. Never coming back.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,1,1,2,xyLm27yUzJHfACR3SFL9_Q
