349399,2017-01-08,1,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"Hemant Kishore aka the 6-Pack Chef is making delicious Southern Indian specialties in this unassuming locale. Tucked in the back of the Inn-Zone gaming bar off US-95 and Rainbow, Hemant serves up authentic Kerala street food. 

Having lived in Singapore for some time, I was taken right back to Serangoon Road when I tasted the curry leaf in the Kappa and Konj. Beautifully spiced prawns on a bed of creamy mashed tapioca. Loved the heat! Probably the highlight of the meal.

Masala chicken chunks perfectly seasoned and tender with basmati rice = a classic biriyani (served in a clay pot added much appreciated presentation). 

Though not often pointed out by most diners - I love when a chef executes a perfect, simple salad. A light ponzu dressing of hand selected lettuces, elegantly seasoned with picked red onions.

Hemant is a consummate professional, executing top notch cuisine. His unique expression of regional Indian cooking is informative, inspiring, and give us a taste of India far beyond butter chicken, dahl, and naan.",b3cssGUI0x0w12L7yM1yLw,5,2,5,3Aulphpz6spJ1zraUzW0Fg

1162745,2017-05-30,0,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"Saw the shop name in nearby restaurants search, had read about this guy from Kerala who came to US and ventured valiantly into food business to sell Kerala cuisine in the least expected of places. Well, it was a pleasant surprise for a group of us to see some of our native food (only 3 of them though) in the menu. First of all, this place is a little place in the corner of a bar and is not easy to find. 

We ordered biriyani and kappa with konchu. Didn't order the fish because it said pompano clearly in the menu instead of pearl spot fish which is normally used for that dish. But eating a proper malabar biryani and kappa/konchu would have made the trip for us.  But to our utter disappointment, the biryani was basmati rice mixed(in the to go package) with some store purchased chicken tikka masala(my hunch). Not to exaggerate, the real malabar biriyani fans would choke at the sight of this dish. Konchu was ok, but Kappa was big pieces just steamed - not the variety which normally goes with konchu or fish curry. Not to mention a surprisingly high $16 - $19 for these dishes. 

In short, this is a cleverly marketed (misusing a  nostalgic brand -  Kallu (Toddy) - please don't use this name if you don't serve toddy - my humble request ) place, but unfortunately doesn't even come close to the expectations. The two stars  is to this guy's entrepreneurship efforts.  Coming to terms that if you need authentic Kerala food, you need to be in Kerala.

Disclaimer: My review is solely based on the ethnic Kerala cuisine on the menu. Other dishes on the menu might or might not be doing justice to the excellent ratings. I know my Kerala food.",coKTgnB5xHMy6p9ELPcPzQ,0,0,2,kwog-X2vTx4YKMGDFQ-nJg

We had the rajah masala (MUST TRY) and it was absolutely stellar: cold spicy marinated peanuts with homemade chips. Super duper flavorful and really unique. We also had the Asian persuasion burger - I wasn't a fan of the sesame seed bun but my boyfriend loved it - and the Indian chop suey, which was essentially noodles fried crispy-hard with saut√©ed veggies and it was very, very spicy but still flavorful. If this wasn't so far for us I would definitely come back to try other dishes. Honestly the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is the location. I'm no stranger to a good dive bar but this bar is honestly just outdated and a bit boring.

1962881,2016-11-06,15,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"The Toddy Shop is the epitome of what I love about living in Vegas: local chefs doing amazing things in the most unexpected places! Chef Hemant opened up shop inside the Inn Zone on Rainbow (a sports bar with a lively atmosphere) with a menu highlighting the dishes and flavors he grew up with. His background is actually in baking, so if any specials feature bread, GET IT. 

 Grab the rasta wings (jerk rubbed with sauce) if you want to hang out and watch a game- they're a touch spicy, served with fried plaintains for sweetness and fresh chips for a touch of salty, and the order pairs well with a cold one from the bar.

If you're in more of a dinner mood, the pot of biriyani is one of the best I've found in Vegas, with a great warm heat and a generous portion to share with a friend. But the Queen Karimeen is where they truly shine, serving up a whole pompano fish, flash fried and steamed in a banana leaf- the added flavors from the spices and masala make this a dish fit for a queen!

The lady (my apologies for not getting her name) is right - the spice is strong but the flavors in the food can still be tasted.  There was nothing wrong at all with it, just spicier than I expected, however it kicked butt!  For those with a sensitive tongues, you may ask to lessen the 'spice bite'.  Otherwise it is wonderful and packed with flavor punches!

Located straight to the back of Inn Zone bar you'll find this seemingly hidden kitchen.  Don't let the stoop down order window fool you.  Cuz back there is where miracles happen with the food that's on their menu.  What you see around you is a mirage.  What you'll feed yourself will take you yet elsewhere.  The 6 pack chef makes you some food one would least expect for a bar scene.  Bring. It. On!

Rajah Masala comes with house made chips; Rasta Wings has house made chips and plantains; and Pot of Biryani is plenty enough for two people.  Each dish has their own personality.  The Rajah Masala is one of those perfect chip scooping munchies that goes well with a few beers, let's say.  It has loads of peanuts and mixed up with veggies like a salsa.  Actually a healthy snack.  Rasta Wings has a beautiful balance of sweet and spice - great combo with the plantains.  Pot of Biryani of course my fave type of meal with everything in one.  Loved it!

Here you will get your spicy cravings handled!!!  Don't forget to give warm greetings to the kitchen crew and Chef Hemant.  You spice up our lives!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,43,39,5,Y4xZRhEUR0Ug_F93oX3u0g

3519556,2017-06-27,43,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"I met up with some friends here at Toddy Shop. It's located inside Inn Zone, but is moving to a new location very soon. Those who are from Vegas or have lived here long enough remember the days of Inn Zone (multiple locations then with family run business inside) having some of the best food in town, one in particular would regularly have a line out the door just for a bucket of their delicious chicken fingers. With that said, I'd never find it shocking or be surprised to still be able to get a really tasty meal at this now dive bar that could use a makeover. The dining area was clean and I personally wasn't bothered nor smelled any cigarette smoke, but I'm in a fucking bar in Vegas, so it wouldn't have bothered me anyway. Alcohol, food and cigarettes will happen in a bar... get over it. 

Chef Hemant is the mastermind behind the menu at Toddy Shop. It's clear how genuinely passionate he is about the food being served and service to customers. Chef came out during our meal to make sure we liked it and answered and questions about some of the dishes on the menu. 

Our table shared many dishes family style and several things stood out for me. Certain things I was also eating for the first time and it was nice to venture out of my comfort zone to try something different. One thing hubby and I both thought had great flavor was the Rasta Wings that came with some delicious fried plantain on the side. Another dish that stood out was the Pot of Biriyani that had basmati rice, chicken masala, ghee, cashews, raisins and crispy onions which has excellent flavor. Everything we tried right down to the double-cut fried potatoes (ask for Indian ketchup to dip your fries in and thank me later) tasted really good and all of us agreed we'd come back.

3671358,2017-05-31,0,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"A couple of months ago, my husband and I was in Vegas for work  and if there's something  we learned about Vegas on our previous trip is that ""NEVER TO EAT AT THE STRIP"" if you want most bang for your buck ...look for options outside the strip and so I happen to come across Toddy Shop as one of the recommendations on Facebook . Our past  experiences has taught us that sometimes the best places to eat is where comfort food is served with passion .We decided after a long day of work and about the town ..we worked up an appetite to try this place .

We ordered my personal fav (anytime of the year) something I crave the moment we land in Kerala.... which is a Spice Rubbed, Flash Fried fish marinated in a  Onion-Tomato Masala Wrapped & Steamed in a Banana Leaf...  the real treat is to able to smell the warm aromatic yet comforting spice mix across the kitchen while cooking ...and even better when  able  to recreate the Kerala flavors within the first  bite  ....it  takes us back to our vacation days with our granny .This is a stellar dish that you can't miss.

My husband ordered which is an all time Kerala favorite Kappa &Konj which is a Turmeric Mashed Tapioca with Shrimp Masala tempered Mustard Seeds, Curry Leaf, red chilli.. This is a typical comfort  food for any Keralite especially when you had a long day of work... nothing is more scrumptious than having to fill up on the spicy flavours of the shrimp accompanied with steamed turmeric flavored  tapioca. This by far one of the best dishes we've had in a while ..

During  our meal, we meet Hemant (chef) for a quick chat. We were applauded by the humility  and passion he has for south indian cooking with a twist ..which often many people do not realise Indian cooking (is not all about naan and butter chicken people!!!!)... we do have regional oriented cooking like south indian cooking and  Hemant has mastered the art of whipping up classic dishes !!! :)

To seal  the deal right before we left the place... we noticed Hemant and his crew was whipping up what we would call the holy grail of desserts -the jackfruit jam... now any one from Kerala would know the jackfruit jam  is any day better than  all the twinkes , smores ,churros and sweet crepes you can have...and yet again Hemant was able to recreate the flavors of home...  The sweet gooeyness , and the savory of the jackfruit with spices can make any one smile. The prefect way to end the meal .

All in all I would say we would definitely come back to this place when we are in town as we love the food experience and the friendly crew out there!!!",v18GHTuvEqCPup_etKsPeA,0,0,5,TyCprpfCgA1-KM6EXMADuA
3952085,2017-01-25,1,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"I came here on a Wednesday night on my way home from work. I was craving Indian food and decided to give Toddy Shop a try. I ordered take out to bring home to the family. I I would've enjoyed most of the food more had I eaten it there. Most of the dishes were tasty. Their homemade chips are so GOOOD! Here's a little bit of background, the place specializes in making Southern Indian specialty dishes that is often ordered in a bar or on the street. Now, I don't know if it's authentic, but for sure it was different and tasty. It didn't have the typical Indian food feel you'd get at Indian Palace or Mint such as curry dishes. 

TIP: This place is located in Inn-Zone Bar. The signs for the Toddy Shop is very small and not very visible for those driving by. I drove around for a couple of minutes looking for a stand-alone restaurant, then realized it was in the bar. It's all the way in the back and order at a small window. 

FOOD: The menu is limited. I primarily focused on the specialty dishes. We had the following: 

1. Pot of Biriyani: The menu states this is fragrant basmati, chicken masala, ghee, cashew, raisin and crispy onion. My favorite part of this dish is the basmati and raisins! 

2. Queen Karimeen: I LOVED this dish, but it is messy and you'll need to be careful because the spiced rubbed, flash fried Pompano fish has bones in it. It was so good and went amazing with the house made chips. The best way to eat it is with your hands. It's huge so you can definitely share this dish with someone. 

3. Rajah Masala - this is a mixture of chips and nutty salsa with a nice spicy kick to it. I recommend getting this is a starter to share with everyone. It comes with a side of homemade chips you use to dip in the rajah masala. 

4. Kothu Parotta: multi-layered flaky flat bread with stir fried veggies, chili beef and assorted chips on the side. The meat of the dish was yummy and I mixed it in with the Pot of Biriyani. The chili beef had a citrus taste to it that went well with the stir fried veggies (primarily broccoli) 

SERVICE: The lady who took my order was very nice. She noticed me right when I came up to the window. She guided me through the menu and made her own recommendations. All the food is made fresh, so expect to wait. It took about 35 minutes for my food to be ready. I recommend having the chips packaged separately so they don't get soggy if you're ordering take-out. 

PRICE: This place is a little on the pricey side. For all four dishes, the check came out to roughly $69 w/ taxes and tip. You can get a stamp card where I can get a free entree after a certain amount of purchases. 

Overall, my experience with the Toddy Shop was good. I would come back again to try the other dishes like the Rasta Wings and Indian Chopsuey. They also have burgers too. 

Happy Dining,

3971669,2017-01-29,6,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"About a month ago, Chef Kishore posted on Facebook about making duck Indian style.  At that time, I told him I'd be there.  I got a message from him yesterday saying he was serving the duck for this weekend only.  I instantly changed my dinner plans and alter went to the Toddy Shop at the Inn Zone sports bar on Rainbow.

I ordered the duck and puri which he was making for the weekend too.  He asked me if there was anything else I wanted and I ordered rice which it turned out I didn't need.  There was enough food without it.

In a short time, he called to me as he put the dishes on the shelf of the small kitchen's counter.  A nice bowl of bone in duck pieces and a large dish with two very large puri and some rice.  I had already gotten my Coke at the bar and I was ready to dig in.

The sauce was excellent.  He asked me if it was too hot.  He could tone it down for me if I wanted.  I didn't--it was perfect.  The puri were larger than I expected but they were crispy on the outside and moist inside with a bit of a salty taste.  A nice complement to the duck.  With some leftover rice and puri, I cleaned out the bowl of the remaining sauce and I left very content.

Say what you will about Hemant Kishore's recent career trajectory, from early-morning hours baking at PublicUS to a high-end catering service delivering nutritious boxed lunches to clients focused on their health, there is little doubt that the man puts a lot of passion and integrity into every single project he approaches, Toddy Shop by The 6Pack Chef at Inn Zone on Rainbow hoping to entirely reinterpret Sin City's idea of what constitutes ""Indian"" Food.

Not exactly the most likely location, a University of Michigan Bar that rivals any in Ann Arbor for the veracity of its fans, it was after a somewhat unfortunate incident that a repeat attempt was made to visit the small dining area tucked away next to a tiny kitchen where the young Chef from Southern India sets up each evening, the well-culled menu playing of the roadside shops and comfort dishes of Kishore's youth.

Dining with a friend who has possibly visited every Indian restaurant in the 702, our palates often matching as relates to most things besides his disproportionately high tolerance of heat, it was in passing a television area completely decked out in Maize and Blue that we were greeted by Hemant's partner at the small kitchen window before taking a seat in the small dining area, music from a nearby Jukebox playing at bar-loud levels with everything from rock to country as the basketball Wolverines were being trounced on a nearby screen by the UCLA Bruins.

Looking over a menu of all-day bar-food plus several Toddy Shop nightly specials, it was with a bit of sadness for the Chef that a patron actually had the nerve to ask whether he could bring in food from a nearby Mexican fast-food restaurant, the typical Inn Zone client most certainly not a foodie, let alone the sort to appreciate the quality or skill in the preparation of the restaurant-within-a-bar's Farmer's Market ingredients.

Eventually deciding on four plates, each more than sizable enough to share amongst a party of three or four, it was with a slow roll-out that each dish arrived at a four-top soon to be filled to capacity, the Kothu Parotta offering a whole lot of heat as Chili-rubbed beef was tossed into a stir-fry of Vegetables and flaky flatbread that soaked up a lot of flavor from the pan juices plus an assortment of housemade Chips that were tasty on their own, but even better when used as delivery devices for bites from the bowl with which they were mixed.

Having previously tasted The 6Pack Chef's Biriyani at the Chef Series Potluck, here even better in a warm stone pot and certainly the most recognizable plate on a menu of dishes likely unfamiliar to all but descendants of India or those exceedingly well-traveled, Indian Chopsuey came across as an almost fusion-y plate of crispy Noodles amidst fragrant Gravy and Baby Bok Choy, the Birds Eye Chili melding nicely with a fried egg that mixed to leave each bite glistening.

Given a hard time by the bartender for only ordering two glasses of water, a comment questioning my manhood brushed off by a patron of the bar who referred to the Inn Zone employee as an  A**hole, it was with a ""poor man's"" dish of Kappa and Konj that dinner concluded, the Turmeric Mashed Tapioca an absolute stunning flavor when mixed with India's version of the trinity, a few Shrimp cooked Masala style plus Desiccated Coconut that tempered the heat while giving the whole bowl a sweet and nutty perfume that lingered.

*****Setting aside my alma matter and the manner in which staff and patrons feel fit to treat their guests, Toddy Shop by the 6Pack Chef is a dessert or two short of being ""destination"" Indian food for those willing to explore the boundaries of more traditional fare.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,5,J83LSgKNcMiCBh59lrgrpg

5449414,2017-06-08,0,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"We did our usual Yelp and found this place. We were attracted by the 40 reviews with a 5 star rating. There is no name on the restaurant from the outside of the building, It turns out its inside this self professed dive bar. I walked in and asked the bartender where the Toddy Shop was and he pointed to this cut out in the wall. The food is a self order, delivered on chinette paper plates and plastic forks. So, it's raw from a dining experience, but delicious from every other perspective. I have to say it was some of the most flavorful Indian food I've ever had and I consider myself an Indian Food snob. It's not a full menu, but what they served was off the charts. We had a Pompano saut√©ed fish with well blended aromatic flavors and the Chicken Biryani rice dish was infused with so much flavor and the chicken tender....it was just so friggin good!! They also have pub food, wings, fries and burgers. I would definitely look at the menu. We found out, this is a temporary secret and they are in search of a new place to serve this fantastic fare",82GOQIPlSzLvRphl9MzRhw,0,0,5,7OmOgIHpJafP_8jb9ym-kw

5529574,2017-02-20,68,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"Thank you Chef Hemant Kishore for stepping up the pub dining game to something actually interesting and exciting!  Who the hell is doing stuff like deep fried banana peppers in a spiced chickpea batter (Chilli Bajji) or doing a non-Thai whole pompano fish?  Nobody!  That's why this place rocks.  

Our group bulldozed through almost the whole menu and here's what I am definitely having again:

Rasta Wings:  Spicy and a little sweet, these babies were perfectly fried.  Buffalo wings can take a back seat to these jerks any day.   

Biryani:  Complex flavor profile where the mouth get hits from all angles in one bite, along with that oh-so-fucking-tender chicken made this a clear winner.  It was the best version of the popular mixed rice dish that I've had in a long time.  

Asian Persuasion One:  Not one second of persuasion needed for this Asian to devour the living hell out of this burger!  Hell yes to Mongolian beef, grilled shrimp and gochujang aioli on a grilled sesame brioche bun.   It honestly hurt to share and I never plan on doing that ever again.  A perfectly cooked sunny side up egg makes everything better including this.    

If there is anything to gripe over, it's Inn Zone Bar itself.  I attempted to dine here a couple of weeks before only to enter an insanely smoky atmosphere that made me believe they could only be burning Marlboro Reds like incense, which prompted an exit in less than 30 seconds.  You should plan on wearing it out.   But the food is so damn good; I'd even tolerate being seated between Marge Simpson's sisters for it.

When my co-worker mentioned that the food at Toddy Shop reminded him of the cuisine from his Dad's region of South India, I figured this place would be good. It did not disappoint. We ordered the Hawt Wings (for my son), Queen Karimeen, Rasta Wings, and Chicken Manchurian (an off-the-menu special). My son absolutely loved the Hawt Wings... the heat was just right for him and the accompanying fries were excellent. (I stole a few!) The Queen Karimeen was awesome... moist, flaky, flash-fried Pompano fish with perfect seasoning and a just-right spicy masala. The Chicken Manchurian was great as well. It has a touch more spice than what my girlfriend liked, but it was spot-on for my palette. The Rasta Wings paired well with the hoppy IPA I had at home.

Just to reiterate the other observations here, this place is slightly smoky sports bar. And, of course, it is 21 and over... so no bringing the kids here. But the food is worth any inconvenience you may encounter. This was a beautifully made meal and the attention to detail from the chef was very evident. I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!",6hwpXJ-ae82rytYI6T7PhA,1,0,5,SARxy4-uFCfmtl3s8bfbCg
5960050,2017-03-13,8,-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw,"Seriously amazing food in the most unexpected place. That's how I can summarize Toddy Shop.

I came with a group of friends and we ordered just about everything on the menu and every single dish was amazing. The flavor explosion is no joke and each dish is incredible. Some of the standouts were the rasta wings, lemon bundt cake, kappa & konj, Asian persuasion burger, biriyani, curry fries, and chop suet. My absolute favorite dish was the rajah masal, which is a peanut dish with perfect flavor and texture. 

Chef Hemant's passion for cooking classical Indian dishes in innovative ways is evident in all his dishes. I'm so impressed with him and his talent.

I cannot recommend this place more.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,17,16,5,JCzd4WRaQSQcPUniqNbFlg
