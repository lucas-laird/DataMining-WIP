But I felt inclined to comment as they have a fabulous Tuesday deal and I had to get the word out (and no they are not paying me to advertise). For $1.29 you can get two dark pieces of chicken (leg and thigh) on Tuesday and an additional $1.89 gets you a large drink, side of your choice and biscuit. Can't beat that with a stick! I went to the Craig Road location, although through my familiarity of Popeye's around town , I have had the two piece deal at the Rancho/95 location for 99 cents, when the Craig Road was $1.29. I don't know if it is still 99 cents though. 

Anywho, I prefer the spicy chicken and red beans and rice. Which at one point in my life I actually though was healthy, red beans and rice what could be bad about that - of course I didn't realize, or maybe I was in denial, that it is most likely cooked in lard (lard...yum). Fortunately, and unfortunately at the same time, the small side - is well really small- which I considered portion control. But again for the price on Tuesdays you just can't beat it if you are looking for greasy comfort food.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,4,LomNDfyJRoh2W4nN6USEPw

My food took long enough, But on top of that, when I went back up to the register to ask for a sauce packet I had to wait quite a while before I received it. The drive-through girl and I made eye contact while she was doing absolutely nothing, just standing there. She did not come over to ask me what I could use and everybody else was working along the kitchen line and nobody looked up to me to see that a customer needed anything.

So I told my son lets just grab some Popeyes and call it a night. Soon as we arrived and got out of the car, the smell of good chicken was in the air before even entering the restaurant. I just knew we was in for a good meal. NOT!!!! I walked in and saw the cook in the back dropping fresh chicken and thought ""Yes, just in time for the good stuff"". We ordered and waited about 15 minutes and was served. Something told me to check my food, but I did not listen to that silent voice. I trusted the food was ok and in tact because I thought I was getting freshly dropped chicken. When I got home and opened the box of 8 pieces of chicken, I immediately saw this was old chicken that has possibly been sitting on the burner for hours. It was dried up and turning a even darker shade of brown. I was soooo mad, I got back dressed and went to return this food even though I lives miles away. I was really mad that they had cooked fresh chicken in my face but put old meat in my to-go order. I guess they thought ""People ordering to go will take anything and don't check their orders"". They were right, I failed to check mine before leaving and will never do that again.

Atmosphere: Not too bad
The dining area is clean, all the lights work. I walked in during a busy time of the day. My wait time wasn't too long, but there were 3-4 people behind me.

Service: Generally Friendly
I was greeted by the staff upon entering and it was pleasantly surprising to see the staff recognize regular customers and establish a first-name basis with these patrons.

Food: Nothing horrible, but nothing spectacular
I ordered a spicy Poboy sandwich with a side of baked beans. The baked beans were nice but were contained in a slimy kind of broth. Nonetheless, they were still served to me hot. The Poboy was ok, but I felt like the piece of chicken they had given me was not meant to fit in the bun they served. Also, the sandwich in general was tasteless. 

Overall: Nothing special. visit if you like Popeyes
The only thing I like about this Popeyes is that they serve food hot. However, sometimes they serve food to me that's hotter than what I can handle (temperature-wise).

Sorry for the quick review.
Writing this as I sit in my car before I leave the parking lot. You know, hands free law. Even though I know I'll have the wheel in one hand and a leg in the other by the time I leave. Haha..

4 orders leg and thigh spicey/mild

It has been a ritual for us every Tuesday to come out to this location to get our 2 4 1 chicken special. Worth the trip everytime. Clean inside, and the staff always greets and friendly. Fast, and D-lish-us! Mmmmhmmm!

Now to the bat cave and make some rice before I get rained on. 

Come get your chicken on!",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,9,9,4,tSkFGN3LT4MMfHskb8iE0g
5084309,2013-04-18,4,dlTgsi51JXinnmijEVuITw,"The chicken here is one of my favorites from any other fast food place in town. Crispy and super-southern! They also have an extensive menu on side choices, from mashed potatoes to a few types of beans, coleslaw, and even mac n cheese (DING DING DING winner) 

While the food here is delicious, the service sucks. I've never come in to contact with so many people that hate their lives than I have at this particular location. You just walk into the place and the cashier gives you this snooty look of HOW DARE YOU COME HERE. Like, bitch please I just want some chicken not your first born child.

Never go through the drive-thru if you can, at this location either. I've only done it about 3 times, and EVERY GODDAMN time, they fucked up my order, or didn't give me a fork or some shit. Plus the girl running the drive-thru window has a shit ton of acne, super gross face. She'll make you lose your appetite.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,2,2,3,nVEYm7pVeSPeuwzPe7MY4A

My only complaint with this location is the placement of the sidewalk that crosses the drive through. Whoever designed this didn't like pedestrian traffic coming from the large park across the street. 

Back to the food. Fresh, hot and spicy chicken just the way I like it. Last night I even had a hot fresh biscuit. Those are always the best. I've never had a bad meal nor have I had to wait very long for my food. Husband had the popcorn shrimp and the very horseradishy cocktail sauce. The coleslaw was a bit bland but the well seasoned mashed potatoes and perfect fried chicken made up for it.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,0,0,4,xrl8sngZYm1NQRgmYiA0ow

As long as they don't screw it up and believe me I have been to my share of messed up Popeye's. Anyways, this location is fast, clean, and the employees are always kind and helpful.

The workers are nice. You can have as many sauces as you want and they don't charge extra.

Plus one of the few places that still serve battered fries.

The $5 box is a pretty good deal too, but if they have seafood skip. Not worth it.",ub5yA93d2pWc0VMPE8Dn1A,2,1,4,l0M4PjIpgHfPeWaEeruyLA

I had to wait out front an extra 5 minutes because they were out of biscuits, and inside I saw the manager slacking off and eating, she was there when I first went through the drive thru.
After the extremely long wait I was not apologized to.
Never again.

When placing our order, they would ask if you wanted regular or spicy, etc.  Also, if they have a special, they will let you know that you can save $ to get the best deal. Ordered the shrimp basket w/fries, 8 pc. meal w/2 side orders & 4 biscuits.  Everything was hot & fresh! Didn't even have to ask for condiments; they knew exactly what should come with the meals!  Also, their ice tea is really good too!  Definitely would go back!",i4eQXKpWn7E-SU0wDAHEMA,1,1,4,ZZXXOv-PzSnG_NQVF5OIZw

The food is great but the last 3 times we have come, they have completely forgotten one of our 3 orders and they forget items on our orders. Tonight the 3 of us each had a coupon for 5 tenders,  2 sides and 2 biscuits. Two of us only received 1 biscuit and the other didn't receive any biscuits. He requested bbq sauce for his tenders and they gave him ranch. My mom requested ranch and sweet heat and they didn't give her the sweet heat. We shouldn't have to go up to the counter 5 times for them to fix our orders. Not sure it is worth coming back to this location.",9_q2aNcene7Di648XcZ_wQ,0,0,1,cgPhh_h38L8_SDx_WBko5g
