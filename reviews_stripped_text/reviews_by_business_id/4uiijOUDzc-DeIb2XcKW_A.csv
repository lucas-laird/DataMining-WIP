We didn't have the sushi and stuck to mainstream pekinese type dishes; lettuce wraps, edamame (ok, they're Japaneze), lobster curry and sweet&sour chicken, all of which were fresh and tasty. 

I suspect this place may suffer from an expectations standpoint. It is not that expensive, we paid approaching twice the price at Jasmine two nights before for a similar quality meal. I am going to brutally honest here and suggest what is expensive to a TI guest is not the same to a Bellagio one ( we are neither by the way). 

Give this place a try. We really liked it.",PPCFx8NTgsELmNogzDjL0g,2,1,4,D0JqU2amlbvcDdsB1wQuHw

I have to say our seating was amazing out on the scenic deck.  However, I do have to say, that the food was blah.  I ordered the Salt and Pepper Prawns and the waiter expressed to me that they had a few shells underneath HOWEVER the Prawns came whole, fried with shells and eyes.  I mentioned that I was expecting a few shells but couldn't eat through these,,,he said well, I told you that it came with shells and half-heartely offered to recook them.  This only after the plate had been sitting for twenty minutes.  He avoided our table like the plague as I could tell he could clearly see I was NOT eating.  AT the end he offered a free dessert but by that time it was a little too late for me.  I don't like to compare high end asian restaurant to PF CHANGs but on this night PF would win.

I checked out the menu before going and was really scared.  It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  Authentic, Khotan is not. But, hey, it's food and we had a coupon.

The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. A++ for effort there.

We were seated outside and it was  a nice night.  But, seriously, that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan, sit inside.

We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter.  The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great, but, gasp, it's $36. The chicken lo mein was ""eh,"" very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is.  I'm conflicted because I generally liked the execution, food, and service, but it was such a boring menu I'd probably never go back.

I asked our waiter a simple question, ""Most miso soup is made with fish broth, do you know if your is?"" He responded no and listed the ingredients. He reassured me it was vegetarian. As soon as my soup arrived and I tasted it I could tell it contained fish broth. The waiter was apologetic and I ordered another side dish.

As we were leaving we spoke to the manager who claimed he came by our table and spoke to us during dinner. He had not. I left feeling like place was full of a bunch of liars. It would have been catastrophic if I had a fish allergy instead of being a 20 year veteran of vegetarianism.

1052647,2010-07-21,0,4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A,"You can IGNORE all the complaints regarding price as this restaurant (formerly Social House, and formerly Khotan Pan-Asian Cuisine) now goes by the name of Khotan Asian Bistro and has a NEW menu with lower prices.

More importantly, there a few restaurants in Las Vegas that offer a more impressive atmosphere.  Anyone comparing it to ""Panda Express"" or even ""PF Changs"" is simply not doing this place justice.  The modern and sleek decor hasn't changed too much from the days it was Social House except for the fact they have added some stunning jade and ivory sculptures on display.

Most importantly, the food presentation, taste and service are well beyond expectations for a ""reasonably"" priced restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.

Can you get Asian food as good or better at a lower price down the street (Spring Mountain) in Las Vegas Chinatown?  Yes, of course, but no where near the same dining experience in terms of location, seating (indoor/outdoor), ambiance, and cool vibe.

I would challenge some of those that previously rated this place less than 4 to give it another try.  Unless you are a complete foodie-snob and/or have no clue what a ""normal"" price is for a Las Vegas Strip restaurant, it will be difficult to rate this dining experience lower than a 4.

I wouldn't say the food was bad, but it wasn't good.  I think the best word to describe it would be: amateurish.  It would be hard to believe that they had real sushi chefs in the kitchen, or that they used high quality fish.  Some of the fish didn't taste like anything!  No taste!

The service was pretty good, but our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish.

Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer.  I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip.  The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either...  I've had better hors d'oeuvres at weddings.

The concept of the Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good, but when eating it, the Parmesan didn't make sense.  I was in the mood for noodles, so we also ordered the Crab Lo Mein.  It was basically ramen noodles with a few pieces of tasteless crab on top.

Our waiter recommended the yellowtail appetizer with tempura jalepenos in a light, yummy sauce and WOW was he right. We both ""mm'd"" through our whole meal, starting right from the tasty beginning. 

Every piece of sushi (we got the large maki for dinner so we received about 20 pieces of sushi) was fresh, generous and absolutely fantastic.

The Tom Yum was really good too. The asparagus came out ice cold. They brought us another one, but it still wasn't great hot. The coating is way too thick.

Our dessert of mini-cupcakes was comped. The worst cupcakes I've ever had. Three cupcakes - mango, coconut and chocolate, each with their own sauce. I really, really wanted to like them. They didn't taste fresh and were too cold. The cake wasn't fluffy and was really dense.

2731433,2010-08-16,0,4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A,"We used a Groupon to try out this restaurant in TI.  We sat at a table on the patio to watch the 8pm Sirens show.  

Pros:
- nice patio with misters and adequate seating.  Good location to see the show (even if the show is GOD AWFUL- but I won't rate this place according to the show.  My eyes were bleeding after watching it.)
- decent variety of food selections and full bar
- decor and ambience were pretty nice

Cons:
- food was overpriced for the quality.  I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry.  California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart.  The lettuce wraps were decent appetizers, as was the tempura platter.  We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed.  
- service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way.

For appetizer we had the crispy asparagus. It was just japanese crackers deepfried around asparagus. Too weird of a texture but okay to eat. Only 6 sticks. So to me, 6 asparagus heads is not worth that price.

I got the lobster curry. Again, for the price, it was not worth. i can get thai green curry for $5.95 down the street and throw in some steamed lobster and get the same effect. 

hubby got korubuta pork chop. okay, but have had much better elsewhere.

2896073,2010-11-02,0,4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A,"My four stars are for the lounge area and the food.  The service in the dining area was lame.

The lounge was great.  During happy hour (5-7PM) there are drink and app specials. And since ISLA was packed to the gills, my fella and I decided to check out Khotan.  The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game. 

We were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.

The dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.

We ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.

The pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.

We enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito. (Give me anything with Canton in it and I'm set. Yum.) 

So - let's talk about the service. The servers were polite and great when we saw them.  We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes. This could have definitely had to do with the fact that for a while we were the only ones inside the dining area, but the servers never acknowledged the crap service.  A simple, ""Sorry 'bout the wait"" would have sufficed.  Oh well.

This review isn't focused on the food as much as it is on everything else the restaurant does right. 

We rolled in around 9 and got seated inside, facing the TI Pirate Show. Unfortunately there was a large, very loud group next to us so I asked for a different table and almost immediately we got taken to the loungy section of the restaurant that seemed much more secluded and still had a great view. They had some mellow music (random trip hop and electronica from what i can remember) playing in the background and the dim lights give the lounge a very mellow secluded vibe. Some of the decor is a carry over from Social House but it all comes together really well. The manager totally made sure we were comfortable with our new table and even the waiter made a nice comment about it.

When the pirate show started we went outside on the patio to watch and our waitress later came out to let us know our food had arrived. The patio outside gives a great view of the show below and its way better than crowding on the sidewalk and i'm sure in the winter when it gets cold, its way better to stand up there by the heaters than in the 40 degree cold on the street.

Towards the end of our meal we asked the waitress for a couple of club recommendations as we've all been out of the scene for a while and she threw some ideas at us. Even checked with a coworker to give us extra options which was definitely nice.

Unfortunately we came there after already having dinner and weren't all that hungry. Ordered an appetizer and the dark chocolate eggroll which rocked. I can't comment much on the food since we ate so little of it but will say this: obviously this isn't a traditional restaurant so expect a fusion style menu. Also, if you're eating 2 normal adult sized dinners and your gf isn't some anorexic who considers a tic tac ""a big dinner"", I don't see how you can get out of this place for under $100.

if you just need to put something filling and cheap in your stomach then go to chipotle or wienerschnitzel. Don't come in if you're on a super tight budget b/c stuff adds up but I feel like you have to splurge occasionally and this place is fun and sexy. 

The service is the best I've had in a while and made this experience excellent. I didn't get any snobby vibes from it. The manager even gave me a handshake on the way out which kind of surprised me but also left a good impression. Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in town.

It was just a spot we ended up at due to convenience of it's location...right in front of us as we were about to give up looking...

Food was good but not memorable. (well except the super awful noodle dish)",wDdh7cLIFK08KtJhj5q9uA,1,1,2,Ulb1lFkd2EjXiXk_8lIsDQ
4438123,2010-01-26,3,4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A,"This place is weird.  So we were greeted by the hostess in front who looked like she was wearing butt pads.  No skinny Cambodian-looking girl would have an ass that sticks out ten inches from her back unless she stuck a basketball in there, seriously.  Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess. While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke.  Fun to play with, but weird.  Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? 

The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.  As long as its good, I like it.  

I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked.  I like attentiveness.  I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it.  Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average. 

Even if money grew on my orange tree, I wouldn't come here again though.",24hyqUROHABynDLYTUpqkQ,1,0,2,vbuArRtzxYv6c359wj07mA
4542957,2010-08-13,1,4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A,"While looking for a restaurant on the strip that had excellent decor and a romantic atmosphere, but at the same time a reasonable price, i found Khotan.
The service was good, our waiter was very social and always kept our drinks filled. I tried out the orange peel beef and my girlfriend tried out the Khotan beef both were very delicious dishes, but me being a fat ass was still hungry after since there isn't very much in the plate.

what i suggest: 
1. Eat out in the patio if you are going to be there at nightfall, Khotan is right above the pirate show at T.I.

2. Chicken lollipops! really good appetizer",cUZw26_XQSpwX3gd9GVKtA,1,2,4,AZJx5c1QV8rKDTEL6-GTng

It's also super dark, so it's hard to read the menus. This is probably to hide that you're paying $45 for a few pieces of steak. 

If you're here at the right time, Treasure Island's pirate show will play right outside your window, so you can listen to the cannons and fireworks go off while you're eating a romantic dinner. That could be a good or bad thing depending on your personality.",6gZBMMTC_47cDL_LDkr3ng,3,0,3,FTx10AG-Ipaldnb3A8ZMcg

If you happen to go for dinner the pirate show is pretty cool since you are watching it from the back side of the boats. The Edamame was really buttery and apps were spot on. The drinks were great, and my ginger mojito was really refreshing after a long day on my feet. 

The reason this wasn't a 4 star was because my diner was rather salty and not much better than something I would get at my local Chinese take out place. The food was so so, but the drinks, app and atmosphere were great.  

Worth a visit and they frequently have Groupons and happy hour specials.",c3oKqsoDC9SDjJjP1LMARA,0,0,3,3oy99xSSdewIQxS3Vc4M6A

We went during happy hour so it was suppose to be cheaper, but it don't mean the size is bigger. I ordered some spicy tuna and it was $7 for like a tiny portion that didn't do anything for me at all. The roll were so tiny it was about the size of a quarter and I got four of those. BOO times 2. The only reason this place got two stars out of me was the bartender. They both were entertaining and he gave us some drinks for free. Atmosphere is really not impressive either.",pgTz-Ds6WvS8qFOsRekG9A,1,0,2,fCVQlHk6x7-S2FWWMbOWpA

Maybe I like this place only because my friend and I stumbled upon this place during happy hour.  Oh the two best words ever.  We ordered from the cocktail happy hour and I got some cranberry concoction (don't remember the name) and my friend had the asian pear.  I liked mine since it's tart as I like it but my friend didn't care for it. She did love her asian pear though since it was pretty sweet.  We were going to have dinner so we didn't splurge on appetizers but the couple next to us took advantage of the happy hour prices.  I took a peek and it looked like it was good since they ate every bite of their sushi rolls.  Bartender was really nice as well.  Noted, maybe on a weekend this place is poppin' but I enjoyed the quietness in the busy Vegas atmosphere on a Thursday night.",d1sLYlfSzHo6WCpfe-j7zg,0,1,4,3r40NTxUZyjPI26ftFaHaw

Food: Yum! I think it *may* be hit or miss based on reading other reviews but we chose wisely. Here's what I liked:
Spicy tuna roll - just enough spice, quality fish
Curry noodles - love the curry they used, definitely singaporean. big shrimps. 
Ginger chicken with broccoli - a lighter option with clean flavors.
Service: Great! Our sever recommended his favorite drinks and was helpful answering questions about the food.
This would be a great date spot. I'll be back to enjoy the atmosphere :)",GABWrw5Et9jubriKwMUDbw,0,0,4,sSuy_QaLPKX99kSGy1QwHA

When we got there, no one congratulated us. No one seemed to care that we were even there. There were lots of staff walking around, but most of them seemed to be chatting amongst themselves. The food was ok, but not worth the $67 bill for 2 dishes and one drink. The jade exhibit was amazing and the atmosphere was good. It could have been better. We were interested in dessert, but got the impression that there was none, until we were asked after we finished dinner. I would have made room if I knew there was dessert.",OuRxTH-PPuRzpmtWXkOavg,0,0,2,-VrIBSpMzFxdVeP04eMXZw
