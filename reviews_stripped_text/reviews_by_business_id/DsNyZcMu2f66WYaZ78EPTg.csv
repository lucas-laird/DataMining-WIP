Two stars means ""I've experienced better,"" which I definitely have. I purchased a Groupon for Tequila Shack, so we came to grab something to eat last night. I originally wanted to drink because I hear so much about the $2 Tequila shots, but when the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink, I asked what kind of drink specials they have and he replied, ""Sorry, I don't do drink specials on the weekends."" That's funny because looking at their Facebook right now I can see the flyer they posted for LAST NIGHT: http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/401106_233309646761588_199561720136381_463287_1385805101_n.jpg. Suddenly, I don't feel so bad about leaving this review... Am I just blind, or does it say DRINK SPECIALS ALL NIGHT? And I'm guessing their $2 Tequila shot deal, which is posted on their website is only featured on weekdays. I don't know if the guy just didn't want to serve us drinks or he just wanted us out of the restaurant area before the 18+ event (with drink specials) started, but we were very mislead. 

As for the food, we ordered Nevada Wings ($8.95). These had the right amount of spice, but damn, don't put your face too close to the wings because your eyes will sting! The wings took 15 minutes to make, but I gotta say they were actually pretty good. The Chicken Caesar Salad  ($9.95) was okay. It looked like the croutons were homemade and chicken was tender. It was a little too saucy though. The Strip Burger ($8.95) just had American cheese, tomato, pickles, onions, and lettuce. I don't know what makes it a Strip Burger as opposed to your average cheeseburger. It was mediocre. It almost just tasted like a Big Mac. That's not a bad thing though; some people really like Big Macs.The fries that came along with it were undercooked. I would definitely say this place DOESN'T have ""the BEST BAR FOOD around! "" which they boast on their website. 

Overall, we didn't have a terrible experience, but we didn't really have a good one either. If it weren't for all their misleading information, I might've given this place 3 stars.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,2,2,DY9fKUBhEPaFO1YTccOftg

The following afternoon we went back to The Shack. It was nearly empty,  the bartender JT  was very friendly and attractive (trust me)
The cook/dj/doorman O, was also very friendly.

Food was outstanding! I reccomend the dirty nachos
Drinks were good and cheap for Vegas
Atmosphere was friendly
Place was clean including the bathrooms.

If you get to Vegas definately check out The Tequila Shack",cOixit-1PyIYG4FES7_vdQ,0,0,3,wGuBwdyvZIr60hcSubYOLQ

Service was fair at best; not a good value for the part of town, cleanliness, or crowd.  To top it off, I had my cognac taken away by a server while I was dancing.  Not happy about that. A two star was generous.",q0PmFutIzTOfP6HhyHtS2g,1,1,2,ZYk-OOS80eUB1hDPeBuTqg
