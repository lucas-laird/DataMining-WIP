Food was good - I had the chicken burrito - was tasty but a little heavy on the rice. They only have 3 options - ribeye, chicken or shrimp and either plate of burrito. 
Biggest problem though was the price. $9 for a chicken burrito. Prices only go up from there. For a few bucks cheaper I can get Chipotle or Cafe Rio with similar quality.

I ordered the rib-eye burrito, and at $12 I had really high hopes that it would be amazing. It was decent, but nothing special...certainly not worth the cost. The meat was scant, the rice was overflowing, and the onions were in large chunks (far bigger than I like). The meat was just average in flavor, and on the tough side of the spectrum. I had a side of sweet sauce, which turned out to be just soy sauce? ? 

I ended up re-wrapping the second half, because the ingredients were not mixed together. In my first half, most of the meat was at the bottom, and most of the rice was at the top. I ate it because I was hungry and paid a lot of money for the food...but I don't think I'll be coming back to this truck. I REALLY wanted to love this burrito.

While there was a lot of rice, the sauce added enough flavor to make up for it. The mix of onions, zucchini, and mushrooms is a definite favorite for both texture and taste. There was an included cup of sauce that added heat and a hint of sweetness, though it was a bit hard to dip without spilling rice. It's hibachi in a tortilla, and that's pretty much all I could ask for out of lunch.

My only issues were the limited drink selection (water, Sprite, and Pepsi) and that the chicken was a bit gristly. Everything was delicious and served quickly.",kt6vUDtDJmq_WhcLQSPJZQ,0,0,5,0C0xu4_xsX-nMrPLYqvfeQ

Now, they're not quite sushi burritos, which are literally giant rolls of sushi masquerading as burritos, but they do come pretty close! The burrito wrap is a tortilla, grilled to perfection and much more akin to what you'd expect when ordering a burrito. Every bite was a mouthful of well-cooked sushi rice, veggies, and a protein of your choosing (we all opted for shrimp) with a choice of spicy or sweet sauce for dipping. 

I will say $12 a burrito is a little steep (especially when you order 3 and you're like ""$36 for 3 burritos?!"") and I'd prefer a price point between $8-10. But.... they were frikkin' delicious. So pay what you must.",qpuYp31W89tq6vaGY6wLVg,1,2,4,Ysvi4mHUV723ZX_g70PRyQ

Today we had the Ribeye dish and again, some of the yummiest food from a truck I've ever had.  Same awesome fried rice as yesterday.

Pricing is typical ""food truck"" pricing - not elevated just because they're at a major trade show.

Truk-N-Yaki bills itself as somewhat of a Japanese steakhouse on wheels. They offer a simple menu of rice plates and burritos, with the same protein options for each: chicken, shrimp, and ribeye.

My mom thought that the ribeye burrito ($12 at this event) sounded relatively interesting out of the available foods at Foodie Fest, so we got it. It was conveniently sliced in half on the diagonal and had a medium-spicy sauce on the side.

The burrito was hot and pretty rich in flavor, the protein portion was sufficient, the ribeye was meaty yet tender and the shell was crispy. The sauce was nice but not essential. I enjoyed it overall, but the flavors weren't mindblowing and the portion was very modest.

I liked them, but this could've easily been a 3-star review if they'd been slightly more stingy with the meat. Maybe I'll try them again after I've explored the rest of the local Asian truck scene.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,6,4,IVZ-lWtqfE58AQpmNindJg

This was the best in the food truck arena, in my opinion (I've tried a few). I had the teriyaki dish and so did my husband. I love fusion food (but sadly, some miss the mark). Not this one! I've tried a few and I've got my favorites. This place easily falls into the category of ""my favorites.""

The quality of the ingredients is important. Isn't it terrible when you get a stir-fry dish that has mushy veggies? Not the case here. I like my stir-fry veggies crisp-tender. The flavors are equally important. What I mean by this, is that they all have to come together, and not overpower each other, if that makes any sense. If there's too much sauce, then it's too sweet, ya know? The portion size is also important (lots of food trucks are pretty skimpy). It was a good size, satisfying and substantial. The price is also a factor. It wasn't breaking the bank (some food trucks are outrageous). Oh, and the wait wasn't too bad, either. So, when all of these, are on point, you really take notice, and the lasting impression/ memory is enough to try to follow up and try to catch this food truck at another event.
