We have looked for really tasty, authentic Filipino dishes here in Las Vegas and we have finally found it. The service is also authentic, very welcoming, friendly and our servers were attentive and helpful. The food was excellent with large portions, with more than enough rice, rather than the usual less than ample found in most restaurants. 
The menu is extensive so if you enjoy the food of the Philippines, you'll most likely find your favorite here. Kelsey, Andy, and Paul were the servers taking care of us...and no doubt they will impress you as well. 

The interior of the Las Vegas Blvd ""Pinoy Joint"" restaurant appeared very clean and well maintained. Outside there was plenty of parking.  

A big thumbs up for ""Pinoy Joint""... we are looking forward to our next visit.

Walking in, the decor and ambiance is very home-y and casual. Many times, when I enter restaurants, the environment plays a big role with my experience. I'm happy to say that this place gave off a ""I'm comfortable and ready to chow down and loosen my belt without judgement"" type of vibe. 

We were immediately greeted with smiles and enthusiastic hellos from the staff. It wasn't very busy at 1pm on a Monday afternoon. There were 3 of us. I'm the local one and the other two from out of town. We sat down and waters came out immediately. I have a 1-2minute mark on waters being brought out.

The menu at this place is expansive. We chose to order crispy pata binagoongan, kare-kare and pork sisig. 

The kare-kare came out first. 
The creamy, peanut butter sauce and the oxtail in that dish was just perfect. I'm picky with my kare-kare because my mom creates and crushes peanuts to create the family sauce recipe BUT I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed D'Pinoy's approach on this dish as well. 

The pork sisig came out next; this dish steamed and sizzled from the moment it left the kitchen. We wondered how our waittress carried it to our table with all the amazing flavors crackling. The sisig had the perfect crunch, crack and pop lol. The sour and savory flavors mixed well. It may have been slightly too hot due to the pork sticking slightly to the sizzle pan.

Last but not least was the crispy pata binagoongan. This dish is huge. 3 of us together could not finish it. It was definitely crispy, full of meat and absolutely delicious. The pork skin wasn't rubbery. The binagoong on it was drizzled; you can order it on the side but I believe it's always better to just have it all mixed in. 

The service was great at this restaurant. Staff was making jokes and really providing a fun and family-style atmosphere. We definitely needed boxes so they provided those. Check came out. Payment was easy (they don't take discover cards). 

We left with full stomachs and the desire to come back. We were going to check out red canyon and we HAD to go home to make sure we left the leftovers in the fridge. It was THAT good.

The bangus sisig had far too many peppers and not enough bangus, and they let us order different desserts three times, only to come back to the table each time to let us know they were out of it.  

The second time, I came with some friends and family with high expectations.  I arrived to the restaurant earlier than the rest of my family and ended up having the waitress ask me if I ""meant"" to be in there, and not the El Salvadorian place next door I'm assuming because of my appearance.  Although I am often mistaken for Latina, I am Filipino and I also know how to read so yes, I knew which establishment I was in.

Moving onto the food, the beef caldereta was watery.  It didn't seem like the ingredients were actually cooked together.  The stew meat seemed to be cooked very quickly which made it tough and chewy.  Again, they were out of most of their desserts so we were forced to order the turon which came out so soggy it was inedible.

The staff although polite, needs a LOT of training.  We were barely seated and given menus when one came immediately to ask if we were ready to order.  We asked for more time.  After probably 20 seconds, the other waiter came to ask if we were ready to order.  We felt that we were being rushed because lunch time was about to begin.  It was our first time there so we had no idea what their menu was all about.  Just a tip, when you see your diners obviously browsing through the menu, they are not yet ready.  But when they put down the menu or when they start looking around, then they are ready to order or they have questions about the menu.  So after we placed our order, our waiter came to serve us our drinks.  The soda cans were inside the glasses, sitting on top of the ice.   Boy, both my husband and I were aghast!  Can't get rid of the unwanted image in my mind wherein the germs found under the soda can were now crawling towards the ice that we were about to drink!  I get that he has only 2 hands and that he had to carry 2 glasses and 2 soda cans but hasn't he ever heard of a serving tray?!  Then we noticed that none of the 2 waiters manning the whole lunch crowd were using any serving trays.  We thought that maybe it's too tough for them to balance the trays while they try to maneuver the very tight restaurant space.  The restaurant has too many tables for the space.  They placed a series of connected small tables to form a very long table in the middle of the restaurant, almost occupying the full length of the dining area.  Even we had a very hard time maneuvering that series of long connected tables just to walk to our table by the wall.  By the end of our meal, our waiter asked if he can put away the dishes.  We said, ""Sure, go ahead!""  Then right there on our table, while we were still trying to finish our drinks, he started pouring, accumulating all of our leftovers into one container with some of the contents spilling over and splattering all over our table!  The waiter tried desperately to stack up all of the variously sized dishes and bowls into one column so as not to make 2 trips in putting away the dishes.  My husband even tried helping him out several times because some of the dishes started tipping over.  I got stressed just watching him do it lol!

Food: 4.5 out of 5 stars... So far I have tried their lumpia, fishballs, chicken adobo, crispy pata, seafood kare-kare, caldereta, beaf steak, nilagang baka, pancit Malabon, pork barbecue, and chicken barbecue. I would say that their crispy pata, chicken adobo, and barbecue (both chicken and pork) are probably the best ones I've had. These are Filipino food that I rarely crave and usually just grab small pieces when served but after tasting theirs, I now crave for them. I loved their pancit malabon when I ordered it to dine in the restaurant but when I ordered a party tray for new year's eve, there wasn't enough sauce in my tray (still tasted good though). Their seafood kare-kare is also a bomb but I just wish they peeled the shrimp skin before cooking because it's pain to peel them coming out of kare-kare sauce.

Service: 4 out of 5 stars... Their service is way, way better compared to other Filipino places I have visited. Servers are very nice but service can be slow sometimes (hence minus one star). When I came to pick up my party tray orders for new year's eve, I appreciated how the staff has packed them to make sure nothing gets splattered during the drive and they even gave me nice box carriers so I can carry multiple food trays all at ones. I, however, had to wait for more than half an hour after my designated pick-up time before I was able to get all of my orders. 

Place: 4 out of 5 stars... Again, it is way cleaner than a lot of Filipino places I have been to. However, I think the ventilation is not adequate enough because the kitchen smell really gets into the dining area. Their bathroom is also clean but feels like a sauna! They are also located in a relatively safer and way nicer neighborhood as compared to most Filipino places.

Prices: 4.5 out of 5 stars... slightly more expensive than a lot of Filipino places but I completely don't mind due to way better quality of food.

No water refills
Fresh melon juice - good

Came across this location while at the South Premium Outlet mall. I had noticed some new businesses and decided to check them out and see if any of them would be something I'd be interested in. I'm so glad I decided to check them out as I found this place as well as a new Black Bear Diner (another great spot). 

I came around 5 pm on a Friday evening for dinner and the place was pretty busy, but not as busy as I had expected. They had plenty of seating available still. We were seated immediately by a friendly waitress. She handed us a couple of menus and brought out some ice water for us. She gave us a few minutes to look over the menu before coming back. I decided to get the Fresh Lumpia, which is a first time for me, but I love veggies so I wanted to give it a try. On top of that, we ordered Pancit Bihon and the Tapsilog dish. 

While we waited I took the time to look around. The main dining area is fairly large and can accommodate quite a few people. They had nice decorations on the wall. It also seemed like they had a wreath for every holiday up on the wall too. A little different, but if it works for them then all the better. Each of the tables had different sauces available on them and were nicely set with a placemat and silverware. Tables were immediately wiped down as soon as customers left and reset with new items on the table. The employees were quick to bring menus and seat people as they entered. The music and TVs weren't overly loud which is nice when you dine with other people and want to have a conversation. Another nice thing I noticed while dining here was the fact that other customers were considerate of their surroundings and made sure not to be too loud for others. 

Our food came out shortly and it looked delicious. My guest is pretty picky when it comes to trying new foods, especially from other countries so I thought what we ordered would be a good choice for him. First off, the Fresh Lumpia wasn't what I expected, but it was still good. It basically is a large lumpia wrapper (fresh and not fried) filled with veggies and topped with a peanut sauce. Overall it was good but probably won't order it again unless someone was with me that really liked it. I ended up eating most of it since my guest didn't care for it. The Fresh Lumpia cost $5.99. The Pancit Bihon was DELICIOUS and it was a large portion as well. Even sharing it I ended up taking half of it home for later. Noodles were well cooked, veggies perfect, and the meat was tender. Everything was seasoned just right. The Pancit cost $8.99. And lastly, the Tapsilog was also a must-try item on their menu. It is made of beef (well seasoned and not overly dried from cooking), garlic rice and egg. You can have the egg however you like but we asked for it to be sunny side up. This cost $7.99. 

They also offer lunch combo specials. Monday thru Friday 11am-4pm. choice of 2 items w/ rice for $8.49. The choices are: Beef Caldereta,            Bistek, Chicken Adobo, Lechon kawali, Dinuguan, Pork Adobo, 1/4 fried daing bangus, Kare-Kare, Menudo, Lechon Paksiw, and1 skewer. 

The menu is large with lots to choose from, so there is something for everyone on it. Even picky eaters can find something even if it's just rice and noodles. I highly recommend coming to this place. 

Last thing before I end this review is that they do have a minium for usuing a card. If you use a debit card, it's $10 or $15 with credit.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,40,37,4,IA6VtMgLjQ25B48WnTCicA

At first glance, this looks like a DJ spot with dancing.  It's nice inside.  Modern tiles and cool tables.  The menu  itself was pretty standard.  We ordered the meal for 5 with fried bangus, pancit, and ukoy.  We also ordered two orders of halo halo and banana Q with buko pandan.  The biggest complain was that the banana inside was not ripe and the sugar was burnt and it taste bitter.  I was highly disappointed.  I didn't want to complain because the owner was super nice.  I want to give this place 5 stars but I wanted to be unbias.  The service here was slow but it was because it was the weekend.  I am guessing they are usually quick.  I would recommend more wait staff.  Also, the restrooms needed some fixings.  I recommend owner to inspect men's bathroom.  I would be sad to hear others complain and give  them a bad name.  Ok now for the food (what I been dying to write) it was AMAZING!  The fried chicken was so good and soft inside.  The pancit was perfect.  The bangus was perfectly made (the fat was perfect).  The sisig was so yummy and not oily.  The atchara was perfect but I wish  they gave more.  The pork was BOMB!!! Holy crap it was soft inside and the crispy skin was great.  The ukoy was my favorite.  It was fluffy and crispy.  The shrimp was so clean and good.  The  desserts was amazing.  The halo halo here kills Fiesta.  I would recommend this place any day.  The prices was good also but I am sure all the locals will find better prices.  I want to come back and  try the other foods.  I came here with my father-in-law (Raffy) who was talking highly about this place since he knows the owner.  My wife and I are from NYC and I can compare this place to one of the best spots there.  I wish I can give them a 5 star but I will give them a BS +++ for the food.  I think however the 18% service charge is a bit much and I think today we got overcharged.

Of course we couldn't finish it so we took the rest back to the resort.

I am pretty picky about Filipino food (says every Filipino person who loves their own family recipes) but if your food isn't top notch at least make up the difference in your customer service. We came in when it was busy and stood at the front door at least ten minutes without being greeted, waved at or even winked at. Nothing. Then maybe after 15 minutes standing there a lady sat us down. Another 15 minutes goes by and the waitress asks to take our order. No emotion. No expression. Just blank face, silent while writing. (Awkward) so we wait another 10 minutes until my husband has to get up and ask for our waters. I guess I can go on and on but I won't, I think you get my drift. 

The FOOD. I got tapsilog and I have never tasted tapa to be sweet, so I was very disappointed. My moms lechon kawali seemed to have been sitting a while and was cold in the middle with no flavor. The waitress forgot to bring the other drinks we ordered and the side of soup. 

I admire people trying to step out and open a business, but if you're going to do it, do it right. Train your staff on customer service and don't let anything leave your kitchen unless it's fresh. My all time favorite in Las Vegas is Full House BBQ and I attempted to try another place but it can't be beat, so back to Full House I go. 

Work on those things D-Pinoy, and maybe you can have something that is really needed here in Vegas...a really great Filipino restaurant.",V8zmwUhNWn1T2K08iLA7JA,2,1,2,ZyjrwMWCFcfIRRI4u2lKkA

I ordered the tocilog and my boyfriend ordered the longsilog. Both breakfast plates came with your choice of eggs and garlic fried rice. We also ordered crispy chicken skins with a vinegar dipping sauce as an appetizer. The crispy chicken skins were not as crispy as we hoped it would be. It was more chewy than anything. My boyfriend was disappointed that the longanisa was bland with no flavor at all. The worse part of our meal was the garlic fried rice. The rice was so dry and hard that the rice kernels were getting stuck to our teeth. I hate to say this, but it almost seemed like they used their leftover white rice from the day before and made it into garlic fried rice. 

I'm giving this place two stars only for the customer service and the price for the food. The breakfast was $7.99 each. Our waitress was nice and always checked on us. Maybe we came on an off day but we were very disappointed given all these great Yelp reviews on here. Maybe next time, we'll just try their lunch or dinner items on the menu.

We had the bangus (milkfish) sisig, pork sinagang, pork sisig, Kare Kare and so much more --- if you have never tried Filipino food, it is going to be the next big food rush (trust me on this) --- do your self a favor visit this place and experiment.

Great customer service, very clean establishment. I cannot say enough positive about this place. Just thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience. Do not expect fancy, but do expect good service, good food, in a clean restaurant - great experience!",du3_MBEwg3ztJs87pYpODg,3,1,5,BhONharGrbOoAv7CJkEC6w

5835920,2018-03-24,0,owxcYAUca_6K6BAUX4V48w,I think the food is great here I was very disappointed with the service.  It was busy and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time but there was no follow up and I had to go ask for more rice at the register.  I had the beef steak lichon and the halo halo.  Jade was my server.  They have to bus their own tables so it takes away from the service experience.,b3tK3CkLOfrWpSuvn9Yo1g,0,0,3,blbyyHlEudU3yDSm1dDddg

I love the chicken curry - not an item typically found in a Filipino restaurant. My spouse eats everything from the Dinuguan to the Arroxcaldo.  Give it a try.  The Salvadoran restaurant next door is also good as is the Diner on the other side.,Q9EfqX_6VvA0LwANNyJ_DQ,0,0,5,iHmB_iHASZJG9KDKpf1H5Q

Food portions were huge and fresh! We barely made a dent on our dishes. Everything was as good as my mommas cooking and that says a lot! 

We came a little after lunch time so it wasn't completely busy, but the decor and cleanliness was intact. 

Definitely recommend this place and would take friends/fam here on my next visit!",OmM6uZdjsA3Xh-crcsdbdA,0,0,5,FrybMK1G8HxDvBRBOWE8uw
