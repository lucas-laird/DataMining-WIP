I have always been a Pizza Hut but this was the worst pizza I've ever had, and the manager was extremely unhelpful. I've always been a firm supporter of the service industry, but this manager's customer service was subpar.",o_seDsZi-6sJCwFo4EWHrQ,0,0,1,RcmMhBPa55cjusdwSrUNLg
1174029,2014-04-08,0,YsGN4k4N4a5LWxe6H-yviA,This place is messing the name of Pizza Hut.  Horrible pizza and not even baked. Called and complained about it that the pizza was dougy and not baked and not hot either.  They were happy to get us a new pizza and that was no good either.  Something is not right at this location.,bujkzCOLCTHW2z1DrH9Ugw,0,0,2,6yw-_rbffHkrste1vg2BPw

I ordered for delivery online on their site. The guy gets here 45 mins later (no biggie there, if you're busy, you're busy... but you did say it was only going to be 30, this is NOT the reason for the bad rating though), and calls me from the street. I can't hardly understand him so I tell him where the entrance to my apt complex is and give him the gate code. 

He insists I come out to the street and get it and says a bunch of stuff I can't understand. 

So I get dressed and walk all the way out there (it's a pretty big complex). 

I ask him why he didn't just bring it to my apt and he's saying something about he's NOT ALLOWED to come in here, like our complex has been blacklisted or something... lmao.

Look, it's a bad neighborhood, I'm not going to lie. But you're really going to charge me extra to have it ""delivered"", then still make me get dressed and walk all that way to get it? If you're ""not allowed"" to come in here, then how come it was never a problem in the past? I've had it delivered to my door here several times this year. 

AND TO TOP IT OFF,  IT WAS COLD.

It took me to this one with a phone number that is, apparently, not their real number. She took my order and before I gave her my cc #, she hung up. I tried to call again and it wasn't pizza hut, it was from a random woman. How could pizza hut allow google to advertise the wrong number????

2353202,2015-06-07,1,YsGN4k4N4a5LWxe6H-yviA,"Stupid. Thats it just plain dumb.

So I call, place the order. He said 2 toppings on 2 mediums $6.99 each, good deal, He says ""im going to call u in 15 min. If you dont answer we are canceling the order"" 
I asked so when will it be ready? 
He says 15 min. 

Ok so my phone dies so i drive over get there just in time. He says , i called u and u didnt pick up so we didnt place the order. 
I said, but u said it was going to be ready in 15 min so here i am. 
He said well its because you were a first time customer so i had to call u first before we make the pizzas. 

Uhhh isnt the whole point about me calling to place the order because i did want the pizza? Why would u have to call me back to confirm? That doesnt make sense. 

Silence..  

I leave take my business to another pizza hut he says $6.99 each for 2 mediums and whatever toppings. Even better.

Online told me the pizza would be ready at 7:10ish, I arrived at 7:18 and it still took a few minutes for it to come out, not a big deal, but I thought I was safe coming later.

Freddy had greeted me when i entered the store and I let him know my dissatisfaction with the new salted pretzel crust my husband ordered.

Bonus star for offering to credit my account.

Driver 45 minutes late (45 minutes after the delivery estimate, not after the order). Pizza was cold because it wasn't in one of those awesome pizza-warmer things. It was in a plastic bag. So the pizza was cold and the cardboard was soggy. The cheese had congealed, so by that point it was disgusting.

I called to let them know, got a hold of a manger right away. They offered to cook the order again, but I didn't want to wait another goodness knows how long for two personal pans. So they credited my account. Not bad, just hope I can use it elsewhere.",XO1E1JwLHN8flRclzr2oJQ,1,0,2,emFUBHrQTQoZMoDro6rwPA
