1205647,2018-06-03,0,hX5DiJqOvIkOhwnQ66nluA,I saw this restaurant online and thought I would give it a try . I'm from Los Angeles been here in Vegas for 15 years and it's still hard to find good Chinese food here. Ordered the  lunch special Orange  chicken it was good and so was the fried rice I would have given it 5 stars but the chow mein was made with spaghetti noodles and wasn't very good but I will be coming back here,44ycB4a7V5x7f7LKOKoCqA,1,0,4,2Vold4o4NDz8JUep8QYogw

I ordered family dinner A and my family isn't too big on soups so we opted out on those. But the receptionist on the phone said we could substitute for more egg rolls or crab rabgoon which was very thoughtful! They told me it would be ready in about 20-25 min and they did not fail to deliver with in that time frame. When we got there is was packed and ready to go. We just had to ask for chili sauce.
I was also excited to try the boba! I've only tried the Thai Tea.I did see they have a couple of flavors for slushees but i have yet to try them out. Any other drinks they have their basic soda fountain.
 We got orange chicken,chicken chow mein, rice,egg rolls and crab rabgoons. The dipping sauce for the eggs rolls was perfect not too sweet. But we had to ask for chili sauce to go.The food is good size portions and 4 of us were able to eat with alittle of food for tommorows lunch. My kids loved the chow mein but weren't too big on the crab rabgoons which if fine. (More for me and the hubs ;] )
And did I mention no MSG is a big win for a Chinese take out place.",AKRmB1u4S7ckLXO3Pl74Cw,6,2,5,_hXw8XBjkXWTyUjqLdOJyg

4371037,2018-02-21,0,hX5DiJqOvIkOhwnQ66nluA,"I have to start off my review with the questionable customer service we received.   First of all to mark a five and ten dollar bill to see if they are real.  2nd having an attitude when I ask if there are forks in the bag is unacceptable.   I asked nicely, I expect a nice response.  Now as far as the food, it's decent and they give nice Portion for lunch special.  Although the fried rice was good, the orange chicken was watery and don't like the chow mein  noodles . Overall as a new business,  customer service goes a long way with getting recommendations and repeat customers.  I didn't have a good experience",SkUjCvDBA2VNnJWj8DNcdg,1,0,2,EkngJKpRtU5Rtgf0e7WeFQ
