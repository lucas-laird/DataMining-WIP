I entered KFC & was greeted by a lovely young lady with a big smile. She was patient with me trying to figure out what to order since I didn't have a friggin clue as to the menu She made a suggestion which worked out great.

The lady who packed my order was all smiles & very pleasant. Order was right. Was given plenty of sauces.

This location was spotless. 

The food was fine. Still HOT when I got it home & on the table.Chicken was crispy & perfectly cooked.  Biscuits were perfect, mac n cheese lasted all of 3 minutes on the table, coleslaw about 5 minutes. Kids were happy. A tiny bit salty (for me) but actually about the best fast food fix I've had in a long time. 

Will definitely return next time we need a junk food fix.",FCdZGj4CccoeSuLFD3qErw,2,0,5,gsHUGaGrLEgWyvznjB2iFA

There really aren't many fast food choices in this area - or I wouldn't have subjected myself to the standard 20 minute wait time again.  I'm sitting in the lot waiting it out for the Colonel. You know what really grinds my gears? This specific KFC.  The worst. Ever. Unreal.

Ordered a 6 piece family meal, they give me ONE ranch sauce. So which piece of chicken gets ranch huh?

Was craving Mac and cheese all day. Got so excited to go home and eat my Mac and cheese. Guess what?! They gave me mashed potatoes. 

Is it that flipping hard to get an order right? Besides the mistake I think the ranch sauce pissed me off the most. I get it, places are becoming more stingy, but ONE ranch sauce for SIX PIECE FAMILY MEAL?! Seriously?!

The chicken was greasy and didn't compare to years past. The Mac & Cheese was horrible! Some of the worst I've ever had. The Ranch dressing was again the worst I've had.

I filled out the online survey and requested that I be contacted.  Five days later no one has contacted me.  THEY DON'T EVEN CARE, what POOR MANAGEMENT.

I went through the drive through tonight because the wife was hungry.  We try to order with the bumbling fool on the speaker but they are too hard to understand.   Maybe that is why we didn't get what we ordered?

Or do they really have blatant disregard for what the customer wants?  We want grilled chicken breast.  We are told they don't have any.

WHY? YOU ARE A CHICKEN RESTAURANT!  Talk about unprepared.  You can't even give the excuse it's because of the dinner rush.  It was 8:50pm at night.

So, this is what we get: NOT what we ordered

- We settled for original since there was no GRILLED. 
- We DID NOT get our RECEIPT from the person at the window.  All we got was our credit card receipt. 
- So not can we not verify what we ordered but we can't even tell if they got the order wrong in the first place or if they decided to just stick it to the hard paying customer and just give them what THEY THINK that they need.  All I know was  I paid $16.73 and that is TOO MUCH for how much I got.  This is ROBBERY!
- I think it's unacceptable that they do not give out receipts. Does this night crew need a retraining?
- We ordered THREE chicken plate with white meat.  Everywhere else you get TWO chicken breasts and a wing.  What did we get?  We got a chicken breast and a wing.  Do people at KFC know how to count?  WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
- Their number on the CC receipt does not get answered.

A couple of months back I ordered a family meal with some hot wings on the side, got home made everyone their plates bit into the hot wings (that were for me) and a mouth full of blood not just pink all pieces were bloody= Undercooked chicken.. I called and expressed my dissatisfaction and They decided they would replace my order on a future order and even though I was pissed it was the least they could do. I know stuff happens so I decided to continue to give this place my business.... a couple of weeks ago I decided to go back and purchase a family meal and added hot wings that I requested were well done and was advised to pull to the front and wait for my order. I told the lady Darcy please don't forget anything because whenever I go there it never fails and sure enough we get home with only chicken and no sides! I was livid because I didn't spend 30+ dollars to go home to 1/2 an order and I am trying to feed my children and family so needless to say the meal was ruined and I refused to go back to KFC to pick up what they forgot so I called them again to express my concerns and they advised me they noted my name and would comp the meal again which I feel is only right. I don't know about anyone else but I have a family of 6 and am not interested in throwing my money away. 
I decided tonight hey they owe me a meal so ill go pick it up. Get there, guy takes my order, I explain what happened and he explains to the manager and she says who said they'd comp you. I advised it was Darcy and the manager and she says where's the receipt I advised it was weeks ago and that I didn't have it but the manager said she placed my name in some book. The manager asks me my name and go to the side to tell me nope your name is not here. Darcy comes over and tells me I'm a liar (I don't have anything nice to say about her so I'll keep my comments to myself. But I will say people who work with the public should be required to take drug tests ?) needless to say their customer service is garbage she offered to give me my sides but that was it. I also had my children with me and they saw how horrible that manager and Darcy was that night. I asked for their corporate number and she told me it's not corporate it's a franchise and gave me someone named Gabriels number. Probably the wrong number but just want everyone to know if you're ok with poor quality food and service this is your place  but if you like good chicken with great customer service just go around the corner to Rasing Cane's!! #KfcIsGarbage",Ic8FddtvOAmq3GoWziqfwA,1,0,1,ORfVxSq3Hx2YSronty-3JQ

But I wasn't prepared. This chicken was so salty that parts of it were barely palatable. I had someone else taste it and they said it was saltier than they remember. 

Another problem was the biscuits. They were totally smashed and misshapen, which was strange because they were just sitting in the box on top of the chicken. They must've been squished before they gave them to me. Why would you purposely give a customer an inferior product?

I don't know if it's just this particular location but I may never get KFC again. They ruined my good memories.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,3,2,1,rnjbSTeK5dbbae8CzKWCmw

I was disappoint to discover that their boneless chicken is nothing more than over-priced chicken strips. The manager at the register was friendly but I felt as I got ""duped"" by the commercial.",4fE37HSVJitQlI78K8uM1A,1,1,3,4V1_0XZqii0lZ19mFa8dag

One more thing as I was ordering I noticed the same employee smoking outside and as I walked in I noticed she didn't wash her hands and was like I said not wearing gloves and was touching all the food so please lady's and gentlemen stay away from this location.
Or you will be tasting smoke or dirty floor",_WXIOnf7Oj0zZLpRi8-fCQ,0,0,1,R3NqMUr4J_Yd-QhIdO1Ejg
