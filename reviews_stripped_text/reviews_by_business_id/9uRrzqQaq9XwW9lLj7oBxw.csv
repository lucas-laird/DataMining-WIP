Order wasn't correct had to continuously call server over to get corrections and tell her to clear the table of cups and plates we were clearly done with. Server acted like she wasn't listening at all responded with okay to everything yet everything came wrong. When paying the bill to leave the cashier asked how everything was and when I said bad she didn't follow up at all just took my money.

Got seated quickly even though they were kind of busy (about 8 entries before us on the seating list). Now is where it goes wrong. Waited about 10 minutes to order then 45 minutes for food. A couple that came in about 10 minutes after us got their food about 15 minutes before us, don't know who they tipped for this. The waitress never came back to tell us the kitchen was backed up or slow, we just waited contemplating leaving.  I ordered the country fried steak and eggs. It barely qualified as such. The steak was almost 1/8 in thick and the breading barely there and overcooked. It was obviously frozen and deep fried. The eggs and hash browns not remarkable at all. My wife got eggs and bacon, both over cooked. The bacon had been cooked hours before and reheated. It was dark and very limp. We discussed sending the food back, but didn't want to wait another 45 minutes and we were getting close to an appointment time and would not have time to go somewhere else so we picked out what was edible.The service is the only thing getting 2 stars, food was minus 2.

Over that 4-day stay, I went twice and each time given great service and good food. My most recent visit was yesterday and I witnessed another table giving the manager, David, a tough time about waiting too long and demanding that the food be free. He nicely told them that he would go check the security cameras to see how long they had been waiting so he could ensure that wouldn't happen again. While he went to check the cameras, those guests left quickly! Obviously, they just wanted to complain in hopes of a free meal. How disgusting but par for the area. We were seated promptly and with a smile. Our server happened to be Dawn, an assistant manager, who gave us lightning service, drink refills without asking, and the VIP treatment. But wait, she did that for all the guests in IHOP at that time. I question the other less than stellar reviews for this place as over the last 3 months, this IHOP has been consistently good.

I ordered a steak omelet and the portion size was decent for my appetite and it wasn't under or over done. Add some seasoning for added flavoring and I didn't leave any leftovers.

There aren't any new faces serving so I'm wondering why every server is so inattentive.

I get here at around 8:30ish and I have to wait to be seated for about 5 minutes. Sure 5 minutes isn't that long but it's pretty long when you stand right in front of the host stand and no one greets you or tells you it'll be a few moments and will turn their head as if trying to avoid you when eye contact is made. Not okay. 

Once seated my drink did come out right away and it didn't take too long for my server to take my order. My food came out exceptionally fast which made me almost forget what had happened when I had arrived but of course something went wrong. Someone, please, explain to me how you are supposed to eat pancakes smothered in strawberries with no utensils? I asked for hot sauce and syrup and my waitress said if would be one moment. Again about 5 minutes pass and she's walked past me about 3 different times with no hot sauce nor syrup. I actually had to ask a different diner if I could use their condiments and when she walked past and saw this happening apologized still with nothing in her hands!

It was supposed to come with honey mustard but they brought me ranch dressing.  Whatever.  I don't care much for ranch but I was not going to argue over it.  I don't use much dressing for my chicken anyhow.  My mom ordered the pumpkin pancake combo with hash browns, eggs and bacon.  I was shocked that she finished her plate.  She tends to be a light eater.  Either the food was simply that good or she was absolutely starving.  My step dad got some other combo.  I think I saw pancakes, stuffed french toast, eggs, hash browns and toast.  A total carb fest with a splash of protien.  Whatever he got he enjoyed.  And both my mom and step-dad were happy to see butter pecan syrup on the table.  I used traditional.  I guess I'm boring that way.  When it came to settle the bill the 20% discount for being a Howard Johnson customer was not applied right away.  The staff were quick to admit the error and ready to fix it.  They were even good enough to bring the new receipt to our table having seen my step-dad hobble up to the counter with his bad knee the first time.  For this level of service, IHOP gets all the credit that is due.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,1,4,oAg3A8AN9n83aGpu-rGLpw

Ultimately the hostess made up for the waitress disappearing. When the waitress reappeared the hostess kept taking care of our table. Guess  the waitress was too embarrassed to come back. Lol ...

The first couple of bites, ok, the more you get it to it, not so good. This is as per my husband.  The ham and egg melt per ""Gina""was ok, the ham tasted a little funny, pulled it out the remaining was good.  The pancakes were fanominal.   The hamburger wasn't too bad, the tomatoes were a bit mushy, overly ripe.   Over all we give it 3 stars.",8PlHxzCf1SFqPDBWpxrEqw,1,1,3,dApQkzqklXVWaaNnEnyCbw
4451599,2014-08-08,0,9uRrzqQaq9XwW9lLj7oBxw,"Near Nellis AFB I have often found myself here with my husband on lunch breaks or quick breakfasts.

Pleasantly clean and free of grunge. This IHOP is decorated in a military fashion with helicopters hanging from the ceiling and accents of patriotism strewn about.

Service is quick, to the point, prompt, and amiable. Service men frequent here - they expect food, they expect to pay, and they expect to leave. But - you will find families here too, most of them military.

Food is decent IHOP fair. Pancakes, omelettes, skillets, etc.

The cleanliness and service is why I will return. Plus I adore the multiple types of syrups IHOP has for you on the table (so maybe it is all high-fructose corn syrup flavors, oh well). Plus ask for maple warmed up and they will be happy to bring it to you.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,4,SeK23oc_NeabVtxcfNdRnw

4566992,2013-10-21,0,9uRrzqQaq9XwW9lLj7oBxw,"My fiancé and I ended up eating here two mornings in a row while staying in the not-so-super Super 8 around the corner.

Okay, not only is it a chain, but it's an IHOP, and yet I'm giving them 5 stars.  Here's why:

+ There are a few not-completely-terrible-for-you options with their Simple & Fit Menu.  The Blueberry Harvest Grain 'n Nut Combo clocked in at 440 calories, was delicious, and left me full but not uncomfortable.
+ They offered sugar-free syrup.  I even got a brand-new, still-sealed bottle the first day.  Score!
+ The iced tea was fresh and pretty strong.  I like a good iced tea kick in the pants in the morning to get me going.
+ Even on the Saturday and Sunday mornings we were there, they weren't busy.
+ Service was excellent.  Fast, friendly, considerate, etc.  What more could you want?

Options were limited in the area and our sucky hotel stiffed us on breakfast (coffee and a juice machine do not constitute a continental breakfast, yo), but we actually enjoyed our mornings at the IHOP!  Whudathunk?! :-)",P9wWG8KKmYeb7cqSd5BdjQ,0,0,5,UInyqc3qRWjXHAb7XyD5aA

My girlfriend and I ordered French Toast, The country fried streak and eggs, a hash brown and pancakes. First of all I asked how much coffee was only find out it was $4!? I went for the French toast hot chocolate and it wasn't hot at all, more like room temperature chocolate. The steak was dry and the gravy was terrible and cold. The hash brown taste like soap and I couldn't bother to finish it. The only reason I'm giving this a star is because of Gabriel our server was very nice.

The staff there are not good with customer service. A person should not have an empty cup for more than 3 minutes especially when the place is not busy at all.
