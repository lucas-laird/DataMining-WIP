Among the plethora of nearby sushi restaurants, my friends and I consistently choose yours because you have the best menu, cooked by the best chefs, and served by the best service staff in town. I can't be adamant enough about this. Your restaurant is the closest thing to a perfect sushi restaurant for the price that I have ever been to. If I had one gripe however, it is with the lack of assortment provided for the mochi. Only strawberry?! In 2015? What is this North Korea? Where are the choices?? A meal as good as the ones you provide deserve a happy ending, David. You of all people should know that. Keep up the phenomenal work and PLEASE consider offering more variety in your mochi!!!",lxNRJjP-WY25rsZcBHlzlQ,0,0,4,iNdNTwmDre-a67m_NlD3bA

Upon entering the place was fairly quiet with the exception of a screaming child, no big deal, and the normal chatter of customers. We came in around 1 on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We put in an order for the AYCE almost immediately and began waiting. It was nearly 25 minutes before we received our first things, we were told the kitchen was backed up, yet when we got our food the calamari was cold, flavorless, and rubbery. My baked roll was cold. When I asked the server if it was supposed to be at least warm, I was given the run around and he finally said it had been sitting while waiting for the other things to finish and that he could get me a new one but it'd be another 20 minutes! I agree and when 20 minutes came it was just as cold as the first time. The manager didn't seem to care and almost everyone else was getting their food in a timely manner except for us. In total we ordered 5 rolls and 1 appetizer (3 of the rolls and the appetizer being ordered in the first 5 minutes of being there) and that was in the span of an hour and a half. even after all that we were given a half ass sorry from the manager and still paid full price. This place is completely over rated and I will stick with a different sushi restaurant that is more reliable and friendly.

I sat at the sushi bar tonight, and the chef just absolutely stuffed me full.  I lost track of how many pieces I had, but I'm sure it was over 31, and the bill was $31.  I tipped the waitress well and threw in an extra $5 to the chef tip jar as an apology for leaving sushi on my plate.  It was all worth every bit of it, including the over-stuffed feeling I'm having now.  

There were several pieces where the chef's creativity really came through.  I'd write more, but it hurts to sit down.  I will be back there just as soon as I can.

I went OYSHI SUSHI tonight. I been here few times before and I enjoyed pretty much. However, today? NOT AT ALL. 

It was very normal and nice at the beginning of our dinner. 
We stared with miso soup and seaweed salad and some other appetizers. Then we ordered some sushi and the first problem was started with sushi. Their sushi was too many rice with fish. I could not think about taking a picture but it seems like 'Oh you guys will have AYCE? then I will make you not to eat too much.' for me. I wasn't sure whether I order sushi or rice.  

Then we ordered 2 kinds of rolls and another seaweed salad during eating it. As you can see in other people's reviews, this place's services sometimes very slow. I expected that seaweed salad can be served right a way because they do not have to cook. We called our server and he just said it will be coming so no rush. Then the seaweed salad came out when we are almost done. You know, seaweed salad is just salad and probably most people eat seaweed salad with other main dishes. That time, we were almost finished so we couldn't finish our seaweed salad. 

And finally, we asked for check and told our server that we are all finished. Then he said that he has to charge for leftovers which were 2 peices of roll and seaweed salad. And it will be the normal price, $8, which is regular price for the roll and $5 for seaweed salad. I knew there are leftover charges but I didn't know that they will charge the normal prices. Isn't that means we can take out leftovers when we charge normal prices? But it was also fine. I knew I have to pay for the leftovers because it is AYCE so I said okay we will pay. And he brought check with only extra $5 for seaweed salad. Okay I appreciate with it.

We were disappointed with sushi, slow service, and leftover charge. Then we pay the tip only $1. I know it is kinda rude, but today, I didn't really want to tip them. Then we came out from OYSHI SUSHI. 

THE REAL PROBLEM IS THIS. GUESS WHAT. 
OUR SERVER FOLLOWED US AND STARTED TO YELL AT US AND SAID F**KING A** HOLE, F**K YOU AND KEEP SWEAR AT US

Before that, we thought today was not really good so we should come again and enjoy our meal but once we hear that the server yelling and swear at us, I thought  tip him $1 was execellent choice. 

I know it is not really manner put $1 for tip. But what kind of manner is that? Even though he was upset with us that we put a dollar for tip, that does not mean that he should say FU*K YOU AT CUSTOMERS. MC.DONALD'S WILL HAVE BETTER SERVICE THAN THAT!!!!!!!!!
May be he wants too, I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE WITH PAYING 26-27 DOLLARS TO GET THE WORD FU*K.",LpsIKlZFEJBE963GkW3MNg,1,0,1,Uhinc5KmiGk7CDgwxaFClQ

I don't even live in Vegas I am from LA and here on business. But I do get to Vegas quite a bit. And now every time u do get out this way I will be eating here. 

I was finishing up a business meeting about 2 miles away and looked on yelp for a sushi place with a good rating. They fit the bill so I drove over there knowing nothing other than they got a great rating on yelp.

When u drove up I was immediately impressed with the outside as it was very attractive and was obviously part of a new shopping center. Then I saw their sign that they had an all you can eat dinner and I got really excited!

Anybody that knows me knows that I can eat. And if your offering me all you can eat im going to be there for a whole. And since I hadn't eaten all day I was ready. I sat at the sushi bar where they told me everything on the menu was available on the all you can eat with the exception of the sashimi. 

There were 5 people behind the counter at the sushi bar and they cranked out the food really fast. But it didn't taste rushed and it certainly didn't taste like all you can eat. In fact it might of been true bast sushi I've ever had. 

There was one sushi chef that took care of me almost entirely. I'm sorry I didn't get his name because he have me great service as did everyone else I came on contact with. 

So to sum it up if you live in Vegas or are visiting (it's only about 10-15 minutes from the strip) you must try it. If you line sushi you will love this place.",lEfWsMjDdG9g7PeH6N7aXg,5,4,5,784bN1ZIuczY3wmLXkQyTg

Love the atmosphere of this place. Has a good bar, neat little lounge area,and the sushi is decent for the price.

But I don't know if the service can be any slower. First time,restaurant half empty, took us (4 people) 30 minutes to get our first round of sushi.  After that the waitress disappeared and we didn't order the second round for another 20.

Last night there were two of us at the bar, again, the restaurant was 3/4th full.  First round of sushi came out fairly quickly, however our server Mono disappeared time after time as we sat there with no food, or empty glasses.

The shrimp tempura was not light and flaky. It tasted more like it coated with a heavy batter an was served not pipin hot but luke warm?
The pink lady sushi roll look like my nephew (5yrs old) learned how to make sushi for the first time

The Pokie has three pieces of light colored Ahi Tuna with seaweed and abundance of white onion on the bottom.  
Then to make matter worse 5 piece roll, coco roll, an mango roll all over sized pieces that could even fit in your mouth. The fish quality was very poor. Also tasted either salty or extremly sweet.

So i started to look around an noticed that the staff at the sushi bar; food runner who brought the food was just not in a pleasent mood.  They all seemed to give off a tired overworked type of mood. Waiter/waitress haphazardly put the plates anywhere and not clearing the table first of any dishes. My friend ordered the desert.

Maybe you had an off day but I was really disappointed with my AYCE dinner with you today. Upon sitting down there was rice on our chairs. 2 out of the 3 menus have some sauce and brown wet spots all over we wiped off ourselves. Water came out slow. The baked rolls came out lukewarm. The baked mussels were lukewarm. Nothing was hot. Even fried Agedashi tofu was warm. The only hot foods was the kids menu item we ordered (popcorn chicken and miso soup). The busser with the goatee was exceptional. He brought out everything I asked for right away (soysauce, the rice and soup that came with the kids meal). Our plates were not cleared and no one cared to move it when bringing it more food and our table is full of empty dishes already. I had to ask them to clear it. It wasn't a busy night. There were plenty of empty tables and maybe you were understaffed. Regardless, being over polite doesn't make up for subpar service. The tables being serviced by other servers who sat down after us got their food before us. How is that possible when theirs was fried and baked items that take time? You brought me the check even though I was still missing an order. I hope you enjoyed my eels. I came to this location because I've had multiple good experiences at the rainbow location. I should have kept driving and went to Sushi Mon like I originally intended to. Had a really disappointing time tonight. Hope you guys live up to your name so as to not mislead any more people coming for the Oyshi brand of standards.

I slurped down the first one, and it tasted like a corpse soaked in brine.  Since I shoot raw oysters, it was already in, and I figured, what are the odds the second one will taste like that too?  MISTAKE.  I told my dining companions, ""Wow these taste like they've been dead for a while...""  I forgot about it and moved on.

I was totally fine and figured her puny weakling stomach must've just not been able to handle the onslaught of all you can eat sushi.  I went about my day like a naive, unsuspecting fool.

Wednesday, around 4:00 pm.  In my office.  The rumblings of gastric distress started to bubble.  I had cooked my usual breakfast, and gotten a sandwich from my usual place.  I thought maybe the sandwich wasn't sitting right.  Within 20 minutes or so my vision started hazing, and my stomach started blowing up like that blueberry chick from willy wanka.  I felt nauseous.  Made it to my car and sped home, feeling sicker and sicker.

I bolted to my toilet and JUST made it in time as a violent torrent of vomit erupted from my face like a hurricane.  Violent wretching for several mintues, and then I slumped into my bed, exhausted.  However, there would be little sleep over the next 12 hours.  Every 10 to 15 minutes I would have explosive, violent, searing diaherrea like a poop volcano.

It started to feel dangerous after a full day of this, so I got myself to a hospital. I was diagnosed with a deadly food bacteria present in dirty seafood and prescribed antibiotics. As I got in my car to drive home I projectile vommitted in my car. I had to call a friend to take me home and pick up my meds. I was unable to get out of bed for a full 6 days, except to crawl on hands and knees to destroy my toilet every half hour or so.

Needless to say I will never eat here again.  I also can't see myself eating oysters ever again. Feeling thankful for modern medicine because this is the ish people die from.

1256061,2016-04-02,4,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"The Oyshi on south rainbow blvd is one of our ultimate favorite sushi places in Vegas. Being closer to home, I swore this location would soon be one of my new frequent regulars. Needless to say, I have come here a handful of times but never had anything justifiable to review... on average could never give more than 3 stars, but after this sad encounter, I guess it's time since my rating for it has depleted. 

I'm big on customer service & truly believe your server contributes to a large part of your dining experience. Our server's name was Junua, and I wish I could say one good thing about him. He was emotionless, unhelpful & scarce majority of our stay... to order or get refills from him was so difficult. It started with asking for more Splenda since all of the ones given were crunchy from being wet previously & dried. All downhill from there. The place wasn't even busy with only 4 other tables. No excuse honestly.

We ordered our usuals. I don't think it's bias, but the chefs here are just not as good as the rainbow Oyshi location. The ASIAN SKIRT STEAK was dry, the LOVE AFFAIR had not as much lobster & crab but excessive crunch flakes, and the AHI POKE was bland. The GREEN TEA PARFAIT had rock hard granola & was drenched with strawberry syrup. I couldn't even enjoy it. In terms of what was decent? The MONSTER ROLL, SPICY TUNA & SALMON NIGIRI were good.

Oh, they no longer have white tuna on their menu... and apparently there is a one order limit on their baked mussels and they have crossed out the ""multiple orders allowed"" on their ice cream? I thought this was all-you-can-eat? Lol. I think we are officially done with this place. Aside from the extremely cute decor and fun playlist, it's no wonder this place isn't busy on a Saturday.

*SIDENOTE: He had no name tag on (young black guy), but shoutout to the sweet busser who was friendly and far more accommodating than our server Junua ever was. Get that boy a raise! Our busser honestly is responsible for this being a 2 star rating instead of just 1! We appreciate you, sir.",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,7,4,2,V7pxbQm59E0T-p-JzyUNBQ

We came on a Sunday for a surprise lunch for my mom for Mother's Day (I made sure it wasn't ON the actual day so she'll be genuinely surprised. Hehe) Let me start off by saying that I've never been to the other Oyshi location so I'm not here to compare or anything like that.

So, the interior is just GORGEOUS! High ceilings, beautiful decor, bold, gorgeous color. The tables, benches and chairs are comfortable and spacious. Our hostess greeted us with a smile and our server Kyle, was just as delightful. He was so sweet and nice and accommodated us very well. Always checked up on us, with a smile every time. 

Now on to the food. Divine! I've had a lot of sushi and Japanese food, in general and this place is one of the best I've ever been to. Food quality is amazing. The fish was so fresh and sushi never broke apart (Sadly, I've been to a lot that does & it's not pleasant). Hot foods came to us really hot so we knew they were freshly cooked. I loved it!

Oh & the best part would have to be the price. AYCE lunch was $21.95. For the classiest, yummiest, Japanese food, that is inexpensive! Sushi items seemed endless so you'll have a variety on top of the kitchen items. And please, please, please, try the Green Tea Creme Brulee & Green Tiramisu.

I rotate between the rainbow location and this one depending on who is working.  Father's Day was a busy night. Still, the restaurant reserved my seating for three in front of Chef Daniel at the Sushi Bar. 

The all-you-can-eat menu is pages long and includes sizzling hot plates (e.g., surf & turf), cold salads, hot soups, tempera, sushi combinations, and one selection from their dessert section for about $25.00. Although the Hamachi Kama isn't included in the all-you-can-eat price, I usually order it. It is on of my favorites.

The atmosphere is relatively quiet and roomy. The lighting is dime in the evening. This restaurant offers a more private atmosphere with room for large parties as well. They have a full service bar. They have TV's at the bar and the sushi bar. 

The restaurant often has daily sushi fresh catches that are available for the all-you-can-eat patrons. I love when they have the red snapper and fresh conch.

The restaurant itself is large, beautiful and has nice decor. The menu is the same as the other location. Promptly greeted and seated upon arrival.
Decent wait staff service. The guy behind their bar did their best to completely butcher irrashaimasen .

First thing I noticed is that I ordered the poke salad and the tuna that was in it was scrap tuna. Just the low quality end pieces that wouldn't look good if used as nigiri.

Then we got a roll we didn't order.

Then we were told that we couldn't order half rolls (the rainbow locations allows this) unless we were sitting at the bar... I'm still trying to figure out how this makes even a little bit of sense. We were told "" well you can order half rolls if you are sitting at the bar"". The bar was 2 feet to my right. The restaurant had 3 total tables occupied, it was dead... this didn't make any sense. We likely would of consumed twice as much had we been sitting at the bar.

Our waitress was a little forgetful. Didn't bring us drinks or even wasabi when asked.

All of our sushi would just fall apart. I even received ikura where my nori  WAS BACKWARDS. Will not be going to this location ever again.

2 stars instead of 1 because of the wait staff service and fresh fish- I ate there yesterday and am not sick at least.",b0UcRHvNzY9oce0Zd5feDA,1,0,2,8Dsq94QrGqmUdP7vtng0EA

Ordering a bunch of different things and sharing them all is the best way to go with AYCE sushi because you discover what you love and what you don't want to go back for. This is the second location in town and it's a very nice spot. The layout, decor and fun seating arrangements are the best part of this place. The food is ok, good but not fantastic.

Vegas has so many incredible sushi spots so having as many options as we do oyshi should offer half rolls and a few sashimi options. Most sushi places do and the ultimate giveaway is the rice to fish ratio. This place is big on rice. They also didn't carry super white. WTF? 

So we came in a big group and ate our hearts out but I didn't have any unbelievable moments. Some things were better then the others and my favorites from this place were the iris roll, unagi and Spanish mackerel. But again nothing was a wow. Lots of rice and a 1 hour limit. 

The company was great so overall we had fun but with so many sushi options this isn't at the top of my list.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,22,17,3,LCcxN2K3nW5W_UK-BgusNw

They have a lot of appetizers to choose from AND their nigiri is fantastic. I'm not a roll person, but they do sound pretty delicious.

I've been here many times that sometimes I'm greeted with ""welcome back!"" I normally recommend this place to friends or old co workers, and that says A LOT since I used to be a server at another sushi restaurant and I preferred this place over my old work.

The selection is large, with several sides and apps, as well as grilled dishes, to supplement the nigiri and (massive list of) sushi rolls.

Definitely ask about the daily specials to ensure you are trying their freshest fish available: the scallop, smoked salmon, conch, and mackerel on my visit were all incredible. Nigiri portions are generous with thick-cut large pieces. 

Favorite rolls are the CHUNG HUA (salmon tempura and garlic yum yum spicy tuna inside topped with white fish and avocado, spicy ponzu and sesame oil sauces): it's spicy and has a great mix of flavors without being too heavy, really liked the sauces. This roll is nicely balanced out by the YELLOWTAIL TRIO (yellowtail chunks, cucumber, gobo, kaiwari topped with yellowtail sashimi dressed in ginger sauce), which is a lighter roll with the fish and fresh cucumber as the stars. 

Standout apps include the sashimi salad, the vegetable tempura, and the miso soup (generous portion, lots of seaweed, and a savory-not-salty broth). The must-get orders for us include the Chung Hua roll above, a selection of nigiri, and incredible MACKEREL SPECIAL HANDROLLS, with gobo, kiwari, and cucumber.

Extra star for great service: Jesus is my favorite server f(rom another restaurant) and his attention to detail is unsurpassed. If you've never had a server recognize you across town and greet you by name, you might not understand.

Not sure what was going on but the hostess was not having it, she was not friendly and seemed annoyed having to seat us. She also helped ran food to our table and same attitude, grumpy and not happy, made us feel uncomfortable. 

Our server was very nice, made recommendations and our drinks were constantly re-filled throughout our meal. 

They have nice variety of rolls, lot of appetizers and other dishes you can order as part of your AYCE which is great. Rolls were pretty good, some better than others but overall I had a satisfied meal. 

I have been to other places where the dinner price was lower and it comes with oysters, uni and sweet shrimp. $27 is pretty expensive for AYCE, especially since there are so many other AYCE places that offer similar options. 

Overall, it was nice to try the place since my friend comes here all the time and she wanted me to try it out, but it wasn't as great of an experience for me.

Get there around 7pm.... Its not busy so I figure PERFECT even better don't have to wait for table or probably wait long for our food.... WRONG!!!!!!!  They sat us down but we wanted a lil more quiet area so we can catch up.  Asked to sit at the table where I always sit with my family.  That corner table was like a fridge!!!!  My sis asked to see if they can turn off vents above us or do something, the woman server said its just the fan only and will have it lowered.   .... Said we will both have AYCE and that it was my sisters 1st time here so she showed her menu and what was not part of the AYCE.  We ordered 3 order of shrimp tempura n poke and other items.  Got the items but no poke n tempura... Place our 2nd round order and questioned where is the surf n turf, tempura n poke....."" Oh its coming ""..... Asked Manager for another beer with 2 cold glasses n again stated we waiting on 2 surf n turf.... Finally he brings it out NOT SIZZLING n not hot!!  While other table in corner has there's coming out sizzling n smoking??!!!!!  My sis looked at me like WTF??!!!!  ALL DURING THIS TIME ITS STILL COLD AS F**K AND OUR FOOD WAS GETTING COLD BY THE SECOND!!!!!  Ask server in jokingly way if there's a jacket or blanket since its still cold.... She said I'll tell them to lower the fan.  Ummmm weren't u suppose to do that when we 1st sat down????  ..... Placed 3rd round, asked BTW we still waiting on our shrimp tempura and poke!!...... FINALLY GOT IT but only 2 orders of shrimp tempura!  At this time we were cold AF so stepped out to warm up.  Came back in and server said we turned off the fan for you.  ????.... After fact we sat here over an hour?????  So we order dessert vanilla creme brulé which was good but we were still cold AF!!  Fan stop but a/c still felt like it was blasting only on us??!!!

The fish itself taste good but the rice is terrible. It's dry and grainy. I had to keep drinking water as I ate because their sushi would make my mouth dry and the rice would stick.

The inside is very clean and spacey which I really liked. The service was great. They were fast and always came by to ask if we wanted to order more.

2133788,2014-11-13,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"Delicious food, good atmosphere, great service - all quality stuff here at Oyshi Sushi.  And of course the name's rather amusing.  The sushi chef that helped us at the bar was very friendly and conversational.  Since we're new to Vegas, he even suggested some good places to go check out for recreational purposes.  We'd recommend this restaurant and will likely return, but will probably check out other places in town (since there are soooooo many options).  If you're nearby, I'd definitely say it's worth the stop.  Here's the rundown on food:

Things we tried that I'd recommend:
Rattlesnake Roll - good stuff, great combo of flavors
Oyshi Roll - the signature roll lives up to it's role - a must-have
Gyoza - order it pan-friend (even though they only list deep fried & steamed)
Chung Hua - Probably my favorite roll of the night
Nuclear Bomb - chef made this when we requested one of his choices - not for the weak tongued.  This one's very spicy and tasty!
Yellowstone - really great baked roll
Ahi Poke Salad - I really enjoyed this - well rounded flavor, fresh and tasty - wife thought it was too seaweed-y
Shrimp Tempura - the kiddo loves this stuff

Items you could skip:
Baked Mussels - rather bland, prefer 'em creamier and with more zip
Calamari - very basic, dipping sauces are okay, nothing special, needed salt
Heart Attack - it's good, but have the Nuclear Bomb instead
Treasure - wife said she liked it, I didn't think it really stood out much;",hNjvSiHLX4SoCmR-d-N8ew,2,0,5,BYSZDXlD3venOMNC63B2iw

We walked in and stood in front of the hostesses for at least a good 90 seconds (90 seconds too long) before we even got EYE CONTACT. They were too busy chatting amongst themselves. Then, they didn't even ask us how we were doing. We sat down and ordered - the waitress had absolutely no knowledge of the menu - huge red flag (even your staff doesn't want to eat here?). We then noticed one of our plates was dirty and had old food on it, so of course we asked for another. They took the plate back and came back with a ""new one""... which we could clearly tell was just the old one wiped off with a rag. After that, we couldn't stay in that place one more second.
Bottom line: I wouldn't send my WORST ENEMY to this restaurant. You can have the best food/product in the world but if you have terrible service, your business will STILL fail.

We were there for like over two hours. They kept walking past us, taking orders from other people, and serving them first without even asking us if we wanted more. Uh. Okay.

The food, however, still awesome. Muscles and oysters are sooo good, the miso pork belly, nigiri, heart attack and the ""my favorite"" rolls were sooo good, plus the always delish rainbow roll. The Chung hua was pretty good, but the other one we got was kinda weird and bland.

IF you come here often, you learn the pace and the chefs will learn your taste and it's like chocolate and peanut butter: magic will happen.

If you come here thinking you've got the most sophisticated sushi palate on the planet, take your stuck-up self somewhere else. Because this AYCE is not about how much uni or conch or surf clam you can talk them into giving you. It's about sitting at the sushi bar and biting into creative hand rolls that are handed to you by hand - enjoying the crackle of the toasted nori cone and having a cool time with a team of what are probably the coolest sushi chef personalities in the city. It's about enjoying the game on the generously-sized HDTVs while experiencing awesome service. My water cup / green tea cup is NEVER empty here - that is a rare thing, especially at an AYCE sushi spot!

My favorite kitchen item is their deliciously tender and flavorful 'Asian Skirt Steak' served sizzling on a bed of onions and cabbage (included in AYCE), solid apps and skewers (also included) as well as appealing gyoza (steamed or fried) and other standard ""Midwestern"" Japanese kitchen items are all included.

Not a fan of the species of oysters they serve (and I love oysters) - weird texture - so I just don't order them anymore. There are plenty of other things I like ordering. Fresh scallop sushi (better than Sushi Koma's), the 'Monster' hand roll (soft shell crab, eel, spicy crab, avocado) and a few other secret items that I'm not going to disclose because I don't want them to be out of them the next time I go, which is currently once-a-week whenever possible.

Their nigiri selection was more limited than what I am used to, but the pieces that we did order- the  hamachi (yellowtail) in particular- were good. The fish was fresh and the only items that came across as overly fishy were the oysters. Many of the rolls on the menu had cream cheese in them, and based on the ones our table ordered a lot of them are the same base roll with different sauces. This may or may not bother you depending on your roll preferences. 

The nice thing about Oyshi is that their sides as well as one dessert item are included in the AYCE. My hot green tea came in it's own pot, which was also cool. Service was fine, though the servers kept bringing by items that belonged to other tables (not a big deal; just make sure you keep tabs on what you ordered). The only reason I mention this is because Oyshi charges ala carte prices for leftovers like many other AYCE places, so having extra items delivered to your table could be problematic. 

AYCE dinner is $28 with an automatic 18% gratuity for parties of 8 or more. I personally won't be adding Oyshi to my sushi rotation, but I would recommend coming here  when you have a larger group due to the bigger capacity of the restaurant compared to other sushi places.

This location is huge compared to the other. They have both very distinct styles and decorations that coincide perfectly. In the rainbow oyshi I sometimes feel cloister phobic when I walk in and have to sit in a jamm packed restaurant. But this location is ginormous. Twice as many customers can fit inside and they have quite a few private rooms and areas. Love that there are four tvs. Two at the bar and two at the sushi bar area. The waitress told us they're trying to put up a projection tv on the wall so all customers inside can see a game, show, or whatever. When they're able to do that it'll be even more awesome. 

The children's menu is pretty good and if your child wants to do the ayce sushi they can too for a discounted price. 

Don't get confused about the menu. It's very different looking and organized differently from the other location. The only thing not included in it is the sashimi, which is the 5th page. 

I found that this location has more of a variety of rolls and desserts too. Such as the rainbow one has creme brûlée, but this one has chocolate and green tea creme brûlée. Which I should add that green tea one looks like infant poop, in color and consistency. BUT is absolutely delicious! If baby poop was that delicious I would eat it everyday. Even my husband was a little afraid to eat it, and was pleasantly surprised at how great tasting it was. He thought it tasted like the green tea ice cream just in custard form. 

The usual sushi I get. Tiger, spicy tuna crunch, lobster and screaming were just as top notch as they usually are. It came out super fast and fresh. I thought it may have tasted a little fresher.. Which our waitress says she heard a lot but doesn't know how since both locations get their delivers each morning fresh. Must Be in our minds? I also got my usual calamari, grilled asparagus and egg rolls.

Like always I left plump and happy. This will definitely be our new location since it's larger and closer to our house. Go oyshi!",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,7,6,5,yghG6YvFEjFHZE2_SgSm4w

We came in and waited to be seated. There was a party ahead of us so we waited but asked a passing waiter if we could just head to the sushi bar and sit down. We were told to wait for the waitress to seat us. So we patiently stood around for about 10 minutes to be seated at the bar, at which there were four open seats. The waitress eventually came and seated the party ahead so we stood at the front desk for a bit. Behind us a couple came in, headed to the bar while indicating to that waitress, who waved back to go ahead, sitting in the two middle of the remaining available seats.  My husband and I looked at each other, then the waitress who then indicated they were a party of three and could not move a seat over to let us sit at the bar as well. 

We stood there kind of shocked while the waitress then told us we could either sit at a table ( wouldn't be able to do half rolls which as just two people allows us to enjoy more different rolls) or sit at the separate alcohol bar (no bartender, away from the sushi chefs, kind of dark) or wait for one of the other couples to finish at the bar.

We had stood there politely and waited our turn to be seated, only to have the remaining pairs of seats be taken by an INCOMPLETE party with no apology at all from the waitress.

And then he turned around and said it wasn't even his table. Eventually we went back in and told the manager we weren't paying anything extra than the individual orders and she said ok.

Absolutely inexcusable. The kicker was that we went to McDonald's right after and they apologized for the wait when it would take 2 extra minutes for the fries to be ready.",MVpyiDyl8FE_A3i9W_74tw,0,0,1,UwmOYvd7jLG0nCYRmg3CjA

Our waiter waited until our entire party was present before checking to see if we wanted to order. By the time we ordered and food was starting to come out, we were told that it was last call at 9:45 (they close at 10:30). I fm felt rushed and pressure to order more food to make sure I got my money's worth for AYCE. The rest of our food including dessert came out and by 10:15 the staff was mopping and cleaning around us. There were still at least 6 tables still eating while employees were rushing around trying to close up for the night. 

I find this extremely unprofessional and terrible for service. Even though the food was good, I felt that I didn't enjoy it because I felt rushed. It was pretty clear that the patrons were being kicked out, the closer it got to 10:30, the more unwelcome I felt.

Rice, rice, rice and a brick of rice in my belly. This place really knows how to give the illusion of a good fish to rice ratio by giving lengthy fish slices, but underneath you meet your doom of impending rice. They compacted the rice so it was thick like a rock.

The menu selection is not great for AYCE, you have many limits on what and where you can order from. No sashimi, no soft shell crab (only in rolls), no half rolls, all the rolls are large standard size -mostly 8 pieces with the exception of some that are 5 pieces (still the same large size as the 8 pieces, just cut differently.) Not a great place if you want to try a bunch of different rolls. Even the nigiri selection was limited and overall pretty unimpressive.

Don't even think about ordering the ahi poke, seafood salad, salmon skin salad, or any of their salads for that matter. They were crazy weak in flavor/ fish/ execution. I wasn't happy with them. At all. 

The only redeeming dishes were:
1. Dynamite appetizer 
2. Salmon belly nigiri
3. Baked mussels 
4. Green tea creme brûlée
And that's it...

The service we received was below average. They weren't even busy! There were 2 other tables dining besides us. We had to ask multiple times to different servers to grab us wasabi and hot sauce. Our waitress was missing, most of our dinner.

In the end, we left feeling uncomfortably stuffed due to the dense rice expanding. To top it off, it was hot and stuffy in there, and the music made my ears bleed. I agree the interior design was new, modern, beautiful, and spacious, but the overall night club vibe of the restaurant was highly disconcerting. 

In a city that loves a good AYCE sushi joint, this is not the place to go. I would recommend another Korean ran spot that does a better job: Sakana. 

Now, with a belly busted from rice, I bid you good luck and good evening.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,9,4,2,9JOh1eo6zKpV57TiidetMg

The Volcano Roll comes Honey-boo-boo style.

2906813,2018-04-08,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"4/8/2018:  This is our first visit here. Hubby took the AYCE lunch @ $23.00 and I had the Dinner Sushi @ $18.00.

For my meal, miso soup was served first and it was nothing to write home about. Bland and watered down. Certainly not full-bodied and there was no real ""miso"" taste to it. It's like they were holding out on the miso - too expensive to put more in the soup? To their credit, though, they did put a generous amount of wakame (seaweed) but only a small amount of tiny, tiny cubes of tofu. Dang. Tofu isn't THAT expensive! Eating their miso soup was like drinking lightly-flavored miso water mixed in with wakame and a diminutive amount of tofu bits.

Then came the tossed salad, which was a good-size salad but the dressing was minuscule. So stingy on the dressing, OMG. 

The tempura dish was very good! Hot (temperature-wise) and flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed THIS dish!

Now the main dish came out, which was a variety of sashimi on top of shredded daikon (radish) and shiso leaves (very delish...LOVE these leaves!). No rice. After a long while, I finally inquired about having rice and the gal looked on our table, noting no rice there and retrieved a bowl of round-top rice. 

Now back in the day when I was growing up, you NEVER served rice with a rounded top. This way of serving rice was reserved for dead people. Yep...DEAD people. My grandma used to serve little bowls of round-top rice to her deceased husband on a little Buddhist shrine she had in her bedroom.

As for the overall ambience, it was beautiful but the music they played was incongruous to the Japanese theme! Instead of quiet-tone, Asian-type music which would have been conducive and appropriate to dining and digestion, they blasted their nightclub-type music which was almost too loud for conversation. Management apparently thinks people enjoy having their eardrums blasted while eating sushi! Taste in music was pure hell - to us, anyway. Even if they played the same type of music but toned down the volume, that would have been tolerable. But they force patrons to listen to music of THEIR liking. Bad business! They are thoughtless to customers' taste in music. If you're going to inflict YOUR type of music on your patrons, have the decency to turn the volume down to background music.

As for the food server, first we had a female take our order and then later on, a male came to our table. He acted like we were putting him out when we asked for more water and a to-go box, which he brought. But when I asked for a plastic bag for the to-go box, he almost sarcastically asked me if there was anything ELSE I'd like??? My goodness. What an attitude! He's there for a job and it's his job to service patrons. It's also HIS fault that he didn't bring a plastic bag along with the to-go box. That's only common sense: You need a plastic bag to put your to-go box in, just in case the box leaks - which DID happen on the ride home.

Not once during our meal did ANYone come to our table to refill our water or ask if everything was alright.

Overall, we did enjoy our meal but because of the ambience, poor service, poor attitude, poor choice of music, lack of service/concern for its patrons, and food quality and amount, we will not be back. There's just too many other places from which to choose! Well you never know until you try, and we tried! Been there, done that.",jIH2fzQfXY7RW3C3W1Z1iQ,0,0,2,HeS4Ua8TmwQMaVpcnL3gYw

2932025,2018-02-24,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"Horrible service and food. Came to dinner for the AYCE with a group of nine and the wait service couldn't be any worse. The food ordered either didn't come or was mixed in with another plate (with somebody who's not even seated next to you). There were long wait times before your first and your second order (that's if you actually got what you ordered). We kindly pointed it out to the manager that we weren't getting the appropriate service and all she did was rush through some of the missing orders (and yes I said some because there were still other orders never came). After a while (an hour) it became comedic that one of the first rolls we ordered finally showed up (after telling the waitress no less than 5 times that it was missing). It was the crunch shrimp tempura roll (which, judging by amount of time it took for them to prepare, is apparently a complicated roll). 

Overall this was not a good experience. The waitress was disorganized and bad and the manager was ineffective. The idea of an all you can eat sushi sounded good but this place is no where near worth the money you pay to eat there ($28 per person). Oh and the worst was we had to pay 18% gratuity since we were a party of 9. Needless to say they did not earn it. 

Bonus: we asked for wasabi (since you know, we are eating sushi) and they brought us two HUGE mounds of wasabis bigger than a fist size for us to share. I mean who needs that much wasabi?!?!? Lol",6UwrTWwJdVVKk1l7FyEv4g,2,0,1,9AwxoNCVbvZU5POBmy7jgw

I asked her what time they sat the last seating and she checked the clock and said, ""Oh, we're still seating for 10 more minutes."" She didn't apologize and kind of laughed it off like it was funny. It was a terrible start. We should have turned around then but we walked over and sat at the bar because we were starving! We put in our order with the waiter which was a large Saki, miso soup, edamame, and chicken terriaki. Then we ordered a couple of rolls with the chefs. What was odd is that our rolls came out before our drink order, which actually never came :(. I also had to ask a total of 3 times for my miso soup. The waiter clearly didn't care about us. For a place that has a pretty decent star rating on yelp I did not see any customer service what so ever. I was so disappointed.

2951681,2018-04-24,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"My cousin brought me here while I was visiting Vegas. Currently, I live in the midwest in small-town USA with no real sushi in sight (unless you think imi-crab, mayo and a cucumber wrapped up in rice & seaweed is the bomb.com). After being deprived of fresh sushi for a year, this place was *heaven* (read that again in a sing-songy voice). So at first I wanted to rate this 5 stars but then I had to remember that I was raised in California and Hawaii, so I know a thing or two about quality sushi and quality fish. We both got the AYCE for dinner!
Size-wise, the rolls were kinda small. However, the filling to rice ratio was spot on. Some of the rolls were packed full of fish with no crazy veggie fillers so that was pretty great. My favorites were the Lobster Fair (not spicy) and the Dragon Roll (a little spicy). I also got the ""Maniac"" one but that was way hotter than expected. The oysters were SO good. The shrimp tempura was okay. It was nice and hot, but the batter was really thick and heavy, not light like I'm used to. I love love loved the ocean salad they serve before your main courses come. 
My only disappointment was that when we ordered a second Lobster Fair towards the end of our meal, we could only eat 1/4 of it and I couldn't take the rest home. =(  [It's probably a rule with the AYCE, which makes sense, but still, it was almost a whole roll!!!] 
We finished our meal with the creme brulee dessert. It's almost an amuse-bouche. You can finish it in about 2-3 bites. It doesn't really taste like like creme brulee though, it tastes more like a thick vanilla pudding with a carmelized sugar top that has a beautiful crack when you hit it with a spoon.",DgLGVpPuBv8HPAcnsU3Opg,0,0,4,Qet-ttPOKKtHCgdN9rtNqA

My girlfriend inquired about a lunch special, which was called ""Sizzling Plate"". Our server stood their staring at his notebook and kind of shrugged his shoulders in response. My friend asked him if he was new there, and he mumbled ""kinda new"" while still staring at his notebook. She pulled out the menu and pointed to the plate that she was asking about and went ahead and ordered it. Five minutes later, he came back with a different menu in which the Sizzling Plate was crossed out with a black sharpie. He told us that they no longer offer that special. We asked for a manager, and out came Peter. Peter seems like a very nice person; however, he is by no means management material. It is clear that he has not had any training in diffusing situations or handling customer complaints. He reiterated that they no longer offered that special, even though the special was still listed in the menu that we had received. We went back and forth until I proposed that they honor the special for us until they update all of their menus, to which he obliged. I decided to mention to him that our server was very rude and dismissive, only to hear from Peter that our server was sick and not feeling well. (IMO, our server seemed hungover...) As Peter walked away without apologizing for a rocky start, I saw our ""sick"" server making our drinks, which involved cutting fruit and gathering mint leaves to be muddled. There was no bartender on duty, which was abundantly apparent when we took a sip of our drinks- my drink was supposed to be a strawberry and mint infused lemonade, but it tasted like strawberries and rum... I sent it back. My girlfriend also sent hers back, as it tasted terrible as well. We waited 40 minutes for our food. We had to ask three times for our checks. Once we finally received them, Peter still had not offered an apology for the terrible, apathetic, slow, uniformed service that we received.

The thing that impresses me the most about this place is that the interior is very nice. You will find murals across the room and in one corner of the room there are what seems to be upside down umbrellas for the lighting. There is also a small bar on the corner of the restaurant which is also pretty awesome.

The first time was for lunch, we did not partake in the All-You-Can-Eat option, rather just ordered a few rolls and apps. The waiter was so friendly and enthusiastic we decided to bring a few people who were visiting back for Dinner.

Now for dinner, hell yes we all did the All-You-Can-Eat! It was $27 bucks each, awesome. We were committed to taking them down! One roll at a time! OK, so we did not end of doing that, but we has a super fun night with lots of great food!

Our waiter Kenny was a rock star! We were goofing and laughing with him all night! And we had a lot to laugh at, because apparently the new food runners had not quite figured out the table numbers and kept delivering our food to other tables, and vice-a-versa. I know this sounds annoying, but oddly enough it became part of the entertainment of the night. Kenny kept checking in to see what we were still waiting for, and making sure it came. We were never missing sushi on the table or going hungry, he just had to order a couple specific rolls 2-3 times before they finally made there way to us. We had a blast!

Insider tips....
-They do take reservations, but the only way to make them is to actually speak to a hostess. The girl at the front desk admitted to me they never check the answering machine. 

-They have an awesome large room if you want to have an AYCE shushi party! It is separated from the Dining Room and looks super cozy!

-Last tip, AYCE is less during lunch. Only $22, as opposed to dinner time when it is $27",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,0,1,4,xvJDHSkAJ8n-augSkdIJmA

Came here twice in the last month so I guess it's review time! Both times I've recently come I've been lucky and never really had to wait for a table but by the time I'm done, it's filled up and there's a bit of a wait so I would definitely call ahead for larger parties. I'm no sushi expert & I totally understand that you're not getting some award winning fish for ayce but hey I love the rolls and variety of them here; plus almost everything tastes good with mango sauce lol.

PRICES:
Lunch ayce: $21
Dinner ayce: $26

Few of my favorites:

Sexy (my #1 fave!): yum-yum scallop, cream cheese, crunch flakes, topped with eel tempura, wasabi mango sauce and eel sauce

Love Affair: shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top

Atomic Bomb: shrimp tempura with spicy crab, and jalapeno on top inflaming hot chili sauce

Hawaiian Roll: Albacore shrimp, cucumber and avocado wrapped seared albacore with garlic ponzu

Seaweed salad: not too oily here & a lot of seaweed so an ""A"" in my book

& last but not least, THE CREME BRULEE TRIO!!!! This is what keeps me coming back to this place.The chocolate flavor is my favorite because it tastes basically like a creamy brownie but their traditional and green tea flavors are awesome as well.

To add insult to injury the manager did not really apologize but blamed on the people who delivered the lettuce. He said he had a similar problem with the edemame.

The scallops were okay and it came with two sauces; some kinda mustard and I believe ranch.  Otherwise the fried scallops alone didn't have too much flavor or spice like wasabi batter or something.  Didn't meet my expectations but I dealt with it.  Eating it took me a while, but it gave me enough time to chat with Kat and her hubs about the restaurant ambience :P

This is the 3rd restaurant that I've found to have AYCE.  Nice foldable menu and good basic selections.  Salmon belly nigiri was good.  I found their fish to be on the dry side for the other nigiris as served.  Cool thing is their portions are bite size.  For my main roll I ordered the Love Affair... oooouuuu SO NOT sexyyyy either.  It looked like a mound of imitation crab mixed with crispies and lobster bits dumped on top of the cut rolls, hiding beneath the chaos.  But the flavor was good.

Nice that the restaurant has space for larger groups and separate dining areas.  The tall ceilings, creative wood designs, lighting, and paint art captured my attention the most.  Just to note too, walking into any Japanese restaurant I'm used to being greeted by the chefs or workers.  Here they have it modernly designed on the entrance wall - no joyous welcoming shouts...

Our waiter had a tiny misunderstanding with our separate tabs.  Also took a couple reminders for drink refills.  I shall end my review with a fair nod.  I might come back however it will not be my first choice for AYCE.  I wanted to have a taste of their green tea creme brulee.

Driving by today we decided to stop again. Got seated right away which was nice. Our server asked our drink order but by that time we were ready to order.

We ordered beef tataki but got beef wrapped asparagus. Ordered another beef wrapped asparagus but got nothing. Ordered uni but they were out... again. Ordered three orders of gyoza but got two. Ordered three seaweed salads but got two. Ordered a dynamite roll and a lobster affair roll but got two lobster affair rolls. Ordered three pork belly and got one. Ordered a red dragon roll and got a regular dragon roll. The salmon nigiri was warm and did not taste fresh. We ordered the Oyshi scallops which had crab also, but when we got the order there was no scallop. I called over a food runner and sent it back. The server came back and aggressively asked us if we had ordered cooked scallops. It's like she couldn't remember anything even though she wrote it down. We said there were no scallops and she said they were chopped and mixed with the crab. It was a lie. I looked through it. Besides, no one minces scallops.

3286005,2014-10-15,1,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"Came here on a Sunday night. It was busy so that just about all the tables were taken, but there wasn't a ridiculous wait. We had a really large party here, so we reserved a separate dining room to accommodate for all of us. Their service was really great. Food came out pretty fast and the waiters are friendly and are very attentive to your needs. 

The quality of the nigiri was just OK. It wasn't horrible, but it didn't particular stand out. The proportion or rice to fish is average. They give you more rice than some better places I've been to, which tends to fill you up. Also the quality of the fish wasn't great either. It was fresh, but with certain cuts of fish, you can generally taste a difference in quality from the texture. The rolls were pretty good, but they generally are at any AYCE place. None of it seems to stand out, but I rarely see that anyways. 

One of things I got that usually well judges the quality of a place was the uni and a salmon skin roll. The uni was ok. Usually a good piece of uni will have that buttery texture, which this one didn't. This one also had more of a soapy taste, which is generally from uni that isn't as fresh or good quality. The salmon skin hand roll: a good one will have nice, crispy, crunchy pieces of salmon skin. But the ones I ordered here were crunchy and moist, meaning that they didn't toast it long enough to get that right texture.

Overall, it was ok. It was about $26 a person for dinner, which is pretty typical. I've already found some other better AYCE sushi places in Vegas, so I probably wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to.",Zukq_iyq6bItd9NBiur13g,0,0,3,FqKpDYmtPPiSWe3POxqcjg

Unfortunately like my carnal lust for orgasmic sushi I was left disappointed and a bit unsatisfied. Having said that it wasn't all that bad. The fantasy roll, heart attack roll and a classic remix a crazy Cali roll were great. The one roll that was a huge disappointment was the Ian special. As for sides the ginger didn't taste fresh at all or the wasabi. The service was very spotty, the server forgot to refill my water quite a few times and the Resturant wasn't even that busy. The ambience is decent and nice. Not to ostentatious or to subtle but a nice complement to setting the mood right for a memorable night out. 

All in all the place is average at best in terms of price and service. The plus point and a huge reason to return is the roll have a new fresh take on them and many of sound good to try, there is too many to try by yourself. Bring 7 people with you on your quest for something new and exciting. Some rolls will be forgettable kind of like their service but others will leave you lost in a sea mind numbing, thought altering perception.

The restaurant was noticeably less crowded than the last time we were there but we were seated right away. Our waitress was good and quickly came by and took our orders. The first round of food came out quickly, everything was good except the uni which was definitely bad. 

The restaurant started to thin out and eventually we were the only table left. I have worked restaurants for a long time so I get it, I know what it is like to be over it and want to go home. However, there is a level of professionalism that is expected when you have any customers around. My parents ordered a couple of hand rolls, etc for their last round and was definitely falling apart and literally thrown on the plate. 

The biggest issue for me was one of the other employees (not our server). Before 10pm the rest of the workers were already cleaning up and talking to the other employees, no big deal I get it. However, one of the employees was incredibly unprofessional. Literally yelling (again we were the only table in the restaurant), cussing every other word, I literally heard him at one point YELL ""Oh fuck ya, when her fucking titties were hanging out!"" I am far from a prude but I was literally there with my parents who are obviously older and do not tolerate that kind of stuff. My mom was mortified, that employee did  come by our table with a half-ass ""sorry for being loud, it's been a long day"" while literally laughing. We were all over it and just wanted to get out of there. When we left not a single employee said thank you, good night, anything.

A kid's menu is available. My kid's order of popcorn chicken filled a large bowl. As an a la carte item, it was an inexpensive deal that easily would have fed four kids. He ended his meal with a ice cream parfait made with vanilla ice cream, granola and chocolate and strawberry syrup.

Our Server, Rey, was pretty awesome! His energy & enthusiasm was the light in this cave. We ordered a few things then based off his suggestion, we ordered a different roll. Nice one too! 
The Food Runner, I found myself helping him out. Like when we delivered the edamame, rather than attempting to place it in the middle of the table, he placed it off to my side, because there were a few things in the way. In my experience, yes I have worked in restaurants, when that happens, you set the dish down, make room, then place the dish in the center.

Oh but wait! The food! Yes, we did eat here. The sushi wasn't bad. For being our first time, and we only ordered 4 out of the tons of options!

Well, flavor wise, the rolls were good. Like seriously. The rice was just meh. It wasn't terribly sticky. Some parts were a little brittle & dry. No, not the worst thing, just not the best.

Pros: they have a really large selection of specialty rolls and their menu in general is diverse. The restaurant is new and large and can accommodate large parties easily. They have all you can eat at a reasonable price.  

Cons: some of the quality of the fish is questionable sometimes. Ive been here a few times and sometimes I can taste that the fish is not the freshest or the best quality. 

Overall, this place is not bad. Ive been here about 5 times since this location opened and before that I would go to the one on Rainbow but the wait was just so long at that one so Im glad this one opened.",ohboKlO6Kg5kBpWhEZF_5g,1,0,4,XUaEpxYgfdA9Lcjn9ul4OA

3710117,2015-06-15,1,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"I've been going to Oyshi Sushi's Rainbow location for many years (it was my favorite sushi staple), and was delighted when it's sister Sahara location opened since it was much closer to where I live.  

Oyshi consistently delivers fresh tasty quality sushi to its customers.  The deep variety of choices on their menu provides both cooked and raw choices for a varied crowd of people to be able to come together and share a Japanese style menu even though some guests don't indulge in eating raw seafood.

Their traditional sushi is so skillfully prepared that their yellow tail at times seems to just melt in your mouth.  They have so many varieties of rolls that a first time visitor could spend quite a while choosing from their assortment.

After years of coming here I can recommend some of my favorites.

The Rainbow Roll is a traditional California roll topped with a variety of seafood (tuna, salmon, yellow tail) in a mouth watering colorful display.

For a spicy roll, I enjoy the Red Rock.  It's a roll filled with spicy chopped salmon, served with a spicy mayo type topping. It's not the I have to drink water type of heat, but it has just enough heat not to blow out you taste buds.

If you're a soft shell crab lover, I highly recommend the Spider Roll.  The Spider roll contains fried soft shell crab parts layered in a crab mixture, placed in a roll.  It's slightly warm, extremely tasty, and the crunch from the soft shelled crab provides a delicious mild crunch to a roll that you just cant get enough of.

The all you can eat selection also includes tempura selections as well as rib eye steak served sliced in smaller pieces, with onions on a sizzl'n hot metal based plate. If you are still able to handle dessert, they offer a sunday or moche with the all you can eat option.

Beer, Cocktails, assorted beverages and hot tea (at additional prices) are available.

Their all you can eat lunch price is slightly lower than their dinner price, so you can expect to pay approximately 25 per person for lunch and 30 per person for dinner. Of course you could purchase off the menu for lighter appetites.",HEtJsyLYSkxOQiH0GUOuTQ,3,2,5,I2QupyEizYKkb2564zYZng

3759890,2017-03-05,1,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"I'm a HUGE sushi guy. So much so that spending over $150 isn't out of the question for some legitimately good fish.

I came here at the suggestion of my friend who had previously enjoyed it. The decor is very hip and showed a strong traditional Japanese aesthetic. An eclectic mix of hip hop was playing in the background. 

So far so good....

Now here's where things went down hill. My friend and I ordered our rolls and appetizers. Soon after the waitress left our waiter arrived with our edamame. I politely asked her if I could get an extra pair of chopsticks. It technically wasn't an extra pair as I never received a pair but no biggie right? Wrong! The server was rude and asked me if I was sure. As if I had reason to lie. Dude, I don't have utensils, who cares if I got a pair or not, give me an extra pair. 

Apparently though asking me if I was sure wasn't enough. She looked under my menu and all over my plates to see if I hadn't ""misplaced"" my chopsticks. This left a bad taste in my mouth. It would have been more polite, expedient and professional to simply give me an extra pair. I swear I'm not stealing your sticks lady!

Another point that rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that in the 30+ minutes we were there I only got a refill on my drink during the last 3 minutes of our stay. That kind of sucked. 

The food was ok. The mussels were pretty good. The reason I'm not knocking this place down to a 2 star review is because the food wasn't horrible ans because our original server, who I can only imagine 'sensed' we weren't having the best experience, tried her best to save the night. Too little, too late. Although I do appreciate the effort. You rocked.

Doubt I'll be back. If you want good AYCE sushi go to Goyemon. If you want really, really good a la carte sushi go to Yummy Sushi Grill off or lake mead and the 95.

Final word: exiting the restaurant i couldn't help but notice their B health rating. Now B isn't bad but an A is the standard and pretty much expected of any restaurant. If I could I'd give this place a 2.5/5.",Eyard5dGOqZVVSCAtH7iOg,1,0,3,jrW5zSRwtrtSjix_D6eZIw

To judge sushi I base it off of its simplest form, nigiri.  2 components, rice and fish. None of the fish here tastes fresh and the rice is so dry that it gives the nigiri a weird texture. It's almost as the rice is undercooked and underseasoned.  

The rolls are weird and although imaganitive, unappetizing. The combinations don't go together and don't sound like they would.  Who wants mushroom and asparagus in their sushi????

Bottom line is if you want real sushi, don't come here.

None of which looked super appealing and not what we would normally order. There weren't very many choices. I was super skeptical bc none of the people making the food were Asian. I'm a little biased since I think Japanese should make Japanese food, Mexicans should make Mexican food, etc. All the fish was old. The rice was not fresh. The sauces were unimpressive. My hubby drew the line at the seared garlic albacore. It looked more like jerky and smelled terrible. He took one little bite and spit it out.

Sushi: great quality seafood. The fish to rice ratio is fair and not as generous as Sushi Neko, but the quality makes up for it. I tried the salmon, tuna, fresh scallop (A MUST), sweet shrimp, uni, oysters, and eel. Their appetizers are the best I've ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant. I had ahi poke, shrimp tempura (crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside), and mussels. The mussels were the worse because it wasn't creamy or flavorful enough. 

Desserts: AMAZING! They have more than your usual ice creams and mochi ice creams, like a variety of creme brûlées, tiramisu, etc. The green tea creme brûlée was more like a flavored whip cream in my opinion; I like mine more thick and creamy but still sweet and good nonetheless. 

Service: Kenny was our server and he was fantastic. It was super busy when we came in, but he still found time to be attentive and catered to us. He made conversation, suggestions when we were hesitant and deciding on what to order, and my favorite items were from his recommendations.

Oyshi is super clean, has a chill atmosphere and a friendly staff who are quite accomodating. 

The menu is chock-full  of deliciousness - and you'll find something for everyone, even the non-adventurous. I love the nigiri here - perfect portion size. The ahi poke bowl is great, and I love that they've got it on the all you can eat menu, whereas most places will only permit one per person. We always get a ton of nigiri and a few of the skirt steaks, cuz they are a sizzling plate of yum that can't be resisted. 

Chef Daniel was our absolute favorite, so you could count on us occupying a large booth in the back every Friday night. Since he has moved on, we hit this place up at least once per month - as some things have changed, which is a bummer - but it's overall still a great spot. 

Room for improvement here would be the hot tea. They give you an entire pot (which is rad!) but because the tea leaves are left to steep, it's oftentimes incredibly bitter by the middle/end of the pot, which makes me sad.

Items ordered:

Sweet shrimp
Uni
Agedashi tofu
Miso
Spanish mackerel (nigiri)
Salmon belly (nigiri)
Yellow tail (nigiri)
Dynamite (baked in a round pan not a roll)
Sibuya (deep fried 5 piece roll with no rice)
Lava flow (8 piece traditional roll)
Green tea tiramisu

One of the rules is you can only get one order of uni and sweet shrimp per person.  I ordered those first from the appetizer section.  I'd pass on these two items again.  The uni wasn't that great and there was nothing special about the sweet shrimp.

The miso was fairly traditional.  The three nigiri that I ordered for the second wave were just OK.    

Then the best part came.  The dynamite in a pan is very good.  It's a baked crab mix with scallops, onions, mushrooms, and shrimp with a yum-yum sauce.  It's baked and topped with the sauce and sesame.  Very enjoyable.  The Sibuya is a 5 piece--no rice--deep fried roll filled with spicy tuna, salmon, cooked shrimp, and avocado topped with smelt eggs.  The topping is yum-yum and eel sauces.  This had a good spiciness to it with the spicy tuna and the deep frying gave it a good flavor.  Finally, if you like a little heat, the Lava Flow is spicy tuna and asparagus inside and topped with seared whitefish and jalapeños with added topping of Nyi sauce and flaming chili sauce.  Tasty.

For dessert, I got the green tea tiramisu--a green tea cake soaked with green tea.  A good ending.

My server was Ray and he was excellent giving me some suggestions.  Service from the sushi bar was prompt.  I was brought a new iced tea just before I finished my first glass.  With some of the spicy food, you needed a cool down.

4014578,2015-01-27,1,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"Solid 4 stars for our first outing at Oyshi Sushi!

For a Holiday lunch in December, my family and some friends dined at the newer Oyshi Sushi on Sahara.  Our initial choice was Makino's (which isn't THAT bad) but we figure, ""What the Hell?  Let's go try something new!""  Off to Oyshi it was!

On our weekend lunch the place wasn't overly busy thankfully.  Our party of 11 was seated in their more private party room towards the back of the restaurant.  Lovely décor!  Except when we looked at the HUGE mural in the party room and put it all together...it's a Japanese dude...somewhat naked!  Ha Ha Ha, but hey, at least it didn't faze us from some awesome eats.

Because we couldn't decide what to order from Oyshi's menu, the adults just ended up getting the all-you-can-eat.  And at $21 per person for lunch...it's a FRIGGIN' steal!  I mean, if you're gonna order more than one roll (which can average over $10 each easy) then this option is the way to go.  Also, if you're a sushi piggy like me it's the ONLY option!  You can guarantee each of the rolls I chose to try were in the upper price vicinity, probably around $12 per roll.  

With Oyshi Sushi's all-you-can-eat menu you ALMOST get free range of the entire menu.  Most of the hot items and signature sushi rolls are available for you to order.  Only thing not on the all-you-can-eat?  Sashimi and sashimi with rice...of course.  But that's OK because there is so much to eat.

And eat we did!  I felt so bad for these folks because I just kept on ordering sushi roll after sushi roll.  With just the four folks in my family, we EASILY ordered at least 12 signature rolls!  Oinkers!  And that's not including the hot dishes we ordered of the menu!  You can see how getting the all-you-can-eat saves you a bunch of $ when you are an avid sushi eater.  I estimated our total without the all-you-can-eat option - I would have spent over $175, not including tax & tip!  Yowza!

OK, so this is just to show you some of the things we ordered off of the menu (and to show you how Fatty McGee we really are when it comes to sushi):

-Tiger Roll ($12)
-Oyshi Roll ($13)
-Love Affair ($13)
-Dynamite Roll ($11)
-Volcano ($10)
-Lobster Fair ($13)
-Rainbow Roll ($11)
-Spider Roll ($9)
-Red Dragon ($11)
-Monster Roll ($14)
-Premium Spider Roll ($12)
-Ahi Poke ($7)
-Tempura Shrimp ($7)
-Yakitori Beef ($4)
-Edamame ($5)
-Potato Croquette ($4)
-Gyoza ($5)

See what I mean??  We ordered all that (for just FOUR of us), and it doesn't include multiple orders of the same sushi roll!  Add that up right there and see the savings!  Save some money AND eat well!  How can you get any better than that!?

Quality = Good!  Sushi rolls were all made to order so they were cut fresh for us.  The fish was fresh that day, no fishy smells.  The sauces were kept on the light side which I appreciate because after a while everything starts tasting like eel sauce if you're not careful.  Sushi rolls were of a nice size as well, definitely bite size but not tiny at all in order to save them money.  Rice to fish ratio was on point and very generous.  

At the end of the meal (which literally took us over TWO hours) you also get your choice of one dessert.  Only ONE you say?  Yep, and I have no problem with that.  By then you are most likely stuffed like a turkey after all that rice you've consumed.  So ending the meal with something light, like a Mochi Ice Cream, or a slice of Green Tiramisu?  No problem.  I'm already feeling bad since I think my family alone ripped you guys off!

Service for our party was great considering our party of 11 was taking up space and time.  Luckily our poor little Japanese server was up to the task of our large ordering shootout.  As a mention, parties of SIX or more are automatically charged 18% gratuity.  Boy did she earn it!  We actually tipped extra over the 18% to show how much we appreciated little her serving our entire party (seriously this dainty girl was no taller than 4 feet 11 inches).  We were eaters for sure!  Combining the other folks in our group, we easily ordered at the very least 25 sushi rolls.   

Will I be back here again?  Yes, yes I will.  Oyshi!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,2,4,xB0BSm9_9va-5lOhz057cw

The service we received was horrendous and there is nobody to blame except the owner because evidently she was also our server. I understand it is a busy holiday evening. However, we called prior to arriving and asked if they were  busy amd whether we needed to make a reservation. We were assured that they were not busy and we could just walk in. Once we arrived, we were informed that they were tremendously busy and we must wait at the bar. We proceeded to sit next to a minor and her father at the bar (which specifically states nobody under 21 is allowed.) Thereafter, once we were seated and orders placed, we were ignored- plates never cleared (AYCE) and water not filled, despite us asking. The mere reason for giving 3 STARS is due to the Sushi Counter chef, Pedro, whom made an otherwise disappointing experience tolerable.  We will contunue to visit the Rainbow location.

My husband ate 8 rolls!  The food was fresh and came out at a nice pace - which gave us more time to relax and talk with each other.  We were not rushed and there was no time limit, like there are at AYCE places.  I don't eat fish - or seaweed - and was surprised that there were so many choices for me to do the AYCE as well - terriyaki chicken, gyoza, egg rolls, miso soup, salads, vegetarian rolls (with soy wraps), and beef plates.  I highly recommend the Grilled Beef Asparagus - thinly sliced beef wrapped around an asparagus spear and grilled with a light, sweet sauce on top.  Each AYCE lunch comes with 1 dessert - I had the chocolate creme brulee - absolutely fantastic!  Service was good.  Vangie, our waitress, worked at our pace.  She gave us time to look over the menu in full, made some very tasty suggestions, and was able to answer all our questions about ingredients and what was included.  Any time we accidentally veered off the included choices, Vangie let us know and suggested a similar item from the included choices.  She was very patient with us and really kept the food coming out while giving us our space.  If you go - ask for her.  I read some reviews where the server just didn't come back after awhile, not Vangie!  As she saw our plates emptying, she returned to ask if we wanted more, clear off used dishes, and refill beverages.

4076131,2018-03-19,2,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"Sad to say, but this restaurant has gone down in service and quality over the past few years.

I dined in here with my family for my mom's birthday. My mom was craving her beloved ""love affair"" roll and green tea ice cream parfait so we decided to dine in here. Sadly, we found out towards the end of our meal that they didn't even have green tea ice cream. :(

Service: It could improve a lot. Our waiter made it seem like we were just another table to wait on. It seemed like he just hated his job overall, no smiles at all. We had to remind him a few times on some missing items. 

We kept getting incorrect orders brought out to us and had to reject them probably twice. We either received 2x or 1/2 of our item orders. For example we only ordered 2 orders of amaebi, we received 3 orders. No big deal. Then maybe 5 min later they brought out 3 more orders of amaebi that we rejected. We ordered 5 orders of baked mussles and we only received 3 orders of baked mussles.  I'm not sure if it was a server/kitchen mistake, but we tolerated it.

We were missing two of our rolls and mentioned it to our waiter. He even admitted that our rolls might have been dropped off to the wrong table. At this point you'd think he would try prioritizing our rolls, but no he didn't. We told him we still wanted them (since we were still hungry from waiting for all of our orders still). He warned us that it might take awhile for our food to come out because the kitchen is backed up. That's not our problem that our food got dropped off to the wrong table. 

We noticed none of the employees had any sense of urgency. Two tables next to us weren't bussed for an hour. 

Quality of the food: Every time my family eats AYCE Sushi, we normally use a lot of wasabi and ginger. This wasn't the case. We received a watered-down wasabi and old ginger. Their nigiri isn't the freshest. My brother loves Uni and when he tried a nibble of it, he spat it out instantly. lmao. He said that the uni texture was jelly-like and tasted very fishy. Their ""love affair"" roll that we came for states that they use lobster. I honestly believe the ""lobster"" is just a bunch of crawfish tails. However, I think their meat is good though.  We had their grilled beef asparagus and surf and turf roll, and I think those were the highlights for me. 

Cleanliness: When we first arrived, we were handed our plates for our wasabi and ginger. We were given two plates that were dirty that we didn't use. So I recommend checking guys' plates! The ladies' restroom needs to be cleaned and stocked. They were out of toilet paper and there were used paper rolls/napkins everywhere. Their bathroom checklist was public and I noticed they don't keep track of their bathroom checks. I'm going to assume they check it daily and forget to sign off of it, but considering their check list is open to the public eye.. it isn't a good sight to see for other dining patrons.

I'm giving them 2 stars because our past experiences from 3 years ago were all good and we didn't have any prior issues.",1-icjsOsrv-zxIvWr2VW0g,2,2,2,wMe1zUg--2xGMgzXdEzXIg

Not only is the sushi not ""oishi"" where every piece of sushi has more rice than fish, but the rice isn't even good sushi rice. It has a sweet offputting flavour that just drowns out the experience. If the goal was to stuff the patron full to lessen the AYCE experience, they have succeeded.

The service is where it really boils down to, this is Las Vegas, a place that has so many restaurants and eateries vying for patronage and sometimes the service, not the food makes or breaks it. We had to flag down servers several times to get in our orders, that is if you even get one to give you eye contact. And then the constant repetition of asking where the order is because after a server takes it doesn't , it never seems to make it to the kitchen. Whatever, if you want good sushi and a pleasant experience, Oyshi Sushi is not the place to go unless you don't mind waiting for your food forever with a sub par service.

Low and behold: they did not have a bartender. Not only was this made noted to us, but we were told by a server  that drinks would have to be ordered when we sat down; completely fine, they seemed busy.

So we were seated in one of their private rooms. We sat  down and the menus were not spread amongst the table and placed for us to distribute amongst ourselves. In retrospect, it was a small complaint compared to the 30 total minutes we waited for our beers. Which, on delivery, the server mentioned he would be back for our order  after he brought the 22oz Sapporo bottle he forgot.

So upon his delayed return and 10 additional minutes for this bottle of beer, he attempted to again avoid taking our order. I quickly asked if we could order starters, in which he responded quickly: IF we were ready he could actually take our whole order.

 We started to fire off items for our party. At this point we were just happy to be ordering. Things appeared slowly but we had to ask for the ginger and wasabi for the table after about three nigiri plates were served. It's traditional that AYCE sushi establishments either bring this with the first plate or serve it immediately after the first order is placed; this was not the case. 

It was a slope from here. We had to ask a runner every time we had something missing from the table. The server wouldn't observe or offer the entire party if they needed anything else, for example: refills on beers. (Which, in my experience as a server, is key to making a great tips!) and to top it all off we were service charged as a party of 7, although their menu explicitly states 8. Luckily, it was 18% and by the end of our meal, we opted to save ourselves more time by letting it go.

They probably knew we would not be back, as on our way out the server's attempt to allay any concern was that ""(he) would redeem himself the next time.""

That phrase in itself made me write this review. Not only did you subliminally acknowledge the subpar service you provided but you were unwilling to listen and communicate with your diners, whilst imposing a service charge that was unwarranted. This is not only a poor reflection of service standards but the unimportance the staff perceives with poor guest experiences.

I don't recommend visiting this establishment to anyone looking for anticipatory service.",ARSMgzgO9vJ3u4vzkGJjxA,3,1,1,aoTXIAM1cSfRspt84ZpzTw

4395610,2016-06-20,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"We went to celebrate my wife's birthday with friends and family and reserved the VIP room. We have been there before and thought the food was good and wanted to go back. I do not usually post reviews but this was by far the worst experience I had to say something. From the start our server was not very forth coming. Just him asking for our drinks was a bother to him. He could not even get through the entire table of 10 before he had to excuse himself and said he will be right back. We all looked at each other like wtf just happened?? Then when he finally took all of our drink orders he ended up forgetting one and it took forever to get him to bring that drink. 

We figured we better get our order in right away since we were already afraid of what was to come. So our food started coming out and the runners that were delivering the food literally had no idea what each roll was. They came to the table and had the list of what was on their tray but didn't know which was which. So they just basically put the food on the ends of our table for us to figure out what each roll was for ourselves. This happened with each person that brought anything out to our table. It ended up A couple of us didn't even receive all of our rolls and we received a couple extra rolls that didn't even order. 

This was about an hour into us being there and do you think we have received any refills on our drinks by now? One of our friends actually went to the bar and asked for a pitcher of water. Literally baffled at this point. 

Needless to say at the end of the evening we asked to speak to a manager and the lady that was walking by at the moment that actually paid attention to us claimed to be the manager. We told her our concerns of the service and lack there of and how they did not know any of the food they were serving. She seemed like she had heard it before but was not willing to compensate us for our troubles. Only to offer us more dessert. No thank you. 

DO NOT SIT IN THE BACK ROOM AS THEY WILL FORGET YOU ARE THERE! But also please train your people on the food you serve.

Facility: The restaurant was very nice with lots of unique accents and modern decor. They had both chair and tables and half booths with chairs too. The bar is pretty small and seats around 8-10. 

Service:  It was very slow when we arrived, and it seems when restaurants are really slow, they tend to forget to check on their guests. They were friendly and helped when you asked, but I felt I had to flag them down too many times from their little congregation at the hostess booth. I'd give the service a 3 star rating.  

Food:  the food was good. The $22 AYCE lunch does not include the sashimi, so that was a disappointment. They also don't serve oysters, uni or sweet shrimp for lunch. We ordered calamari, veggie tempura, spicy tuna roll, gyoza, seaweed salad, mussels, Cali salmon roll, snow mountain, a few other rolls they ordered I don't remember. 
A special shout out to the dynamite, which actually had a teriyaki flavor, the Tempura shrimp, the atomic bomb roll, and this fabulous cucumber salad called sumomono, which was a nice palate cleanser.

They say you can only joke about a bad experience after a certain length of time. It's been a month since I paid over $100 for an all-you-can-eat for 2 and looking back, it taught me a few things.

My friend and I are currently on the hunt for great sushi places in town and this being the closest to our homes, we made it our first stop. I have fond memories of the previous sushi place that took up this space and for some reason, I was expecting the same quality food and service. 

After having waited about 10-15 minutes for a seat in a half empty restaurant, we approached the hostesses in haste when we saw more recent customers led to a table before us. We had a young female server that busy Friday night. Famished from work, we were ready to go on a devouring spree which started with a plate of edamame. The fun began with their specialty rolls such as the red rock, red dragon, and surf 'n' turf - my favorite. The surf 'n' turf consisted of a thin slice of rib eye steak placed above the roll and a shrimp tempura tucked inside. Great combination topped with eel sauce, if I remember well.

Things went downhill from there. We should've just eaten all the sushi we wanted before getting dessert. Back then, I didn't know if 1 dessert per person was the rule of thumb for all sushi buffets but it certainly shocked us when our server gave us our check after crème brûlée. We gave over half in cash and said to charge the rest on my card but the whole amount was charged on my card and the cash was also taken in. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it might have been a flimsy mistake. After getting in touch with the manager, our cash was refunded, but only after much hassle to the restaurant and ourselves.

I heard good things about this place so I was eager to try. I loved the modern, spacious atmosphere inside. Our waiter (Ray) was very courteous and overall service was nothing to complain about. I went for the AYCE and was not disappointed. For nigiri I got several orders of salmon and halibut. I can't describe how fresh it all tasted. The sashimi just melted in my mouth which I can't say has happened before so I knew this place was the real deal. I also got the salmon avocado hand roll which was also quite good. The last thing I got was the Yellowtail Trio roll which also tasted very fresh and flavorful. Of course I couldn't leave without dessert so I got the green tea creme brulee.

Today we tried the Sahara location, being that it was closer to our side of town. I regret not making the drive to Rainbow. 

This Sahara location is very disorganized, dirty, no hot water in the bathrooms and the quality... well I have seen better technique at my local Smith's grocery. Sushi is all about the rice first, and this place must use Uncle Ben's Minute Rice.... microwave version. Please have some leadership behind the (sushi) bar and maintain quality. It's not far to ruin the brand name and possibly turn away business from your Rainbow location.  

It is night and day between this location and Rainbow. Very sad that the consistency is so far off.

I've eaten here before and I can honestly say service is pretty bad and the food is not that amazing. The fish quality is poor and the food is far from special.

As with any group that is doing AYCE, we got to try a lot of the menu through coordinating orders and sharing with each other. From the appetizer section, to the desserts, everything we had was pretty tastey. 

Some highlights were their surf and turf roll, fried gyoza, sweet shrimp nigiri and fried heads, eel nigiri, tamago nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, and their baked mussels.

The only real low points with the food was that the super white tuna wasn't that good, and each person could only have two orders of their awesome baked mussels. 

The service from the staff was top notch. While it took awhile to get our food a couple of times when the restaurant got full and busy, the servers and what we assumed was the floor manager always made sure to check on our orders and help get stuff to our table. The floor manager even took our order a couple of times, cleared our table, and refilled our drinks on more than one occasion. The staff there was firing on all cylinders and was really attentive.

Spacious with more tables and semi-dimly lit, this Oyshi seems to have a bit more romantic lighting, if you will. Don't worry! You can still see your menu!! 

Service: 5 - Our table service was fast, friendly, attentive. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so they were really able to cater! 

Food: 3 - Just like their other location, they also offer AYCE and the choice of one of their specialty desserts! 

I'm usually a huge fan of their food, but the quality of the rolls were just not as good as the original location! When the taste is up to speed, most likely I'll go back, but for now, I'll drive the longer drive to the first location.

Another good reason to come to Oyshi. Not that i needed it lol. But our visit tonight is definitely worth mentioning.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,2,1,5,uWJMbxu3Wt8085Gi0FgvPw

So my wife and I were driving one day, trying to figure out how we can top off our empty stomachs when we saw this gem from the streets. Located in a plaza on Sahara off of Teneya, this spot had a clean look to it. Plenty of parking. Walked inside and almost felt as if I was under dressed. This place is Fancy. Greeted as we entered, we were shown to our table in record timing. Well, for a sushi restaurant. Very spacious, great modern decor, and plenty of seating. Well lit, with just the right amount of volume on the music. 

Our server was great and gave us the full run through of the menu and drinks. No empty glasses here baby. Food came as fast as we ordered them. Well, at least from what I remember. Here's the rundown of what we ordered.

What ordered:
Miso soup
Ahi poke
Calamari
Baked mussel 
Shrimp tempura
Sizzling beef
Beef asparagus 

Nigiri:
Tuna 
Garlic Tuna
Salmon
Albacore
Garlic albacore
Yellowtail
Ikura
Uzura - quail egg
Masago - smelt egg
Tamago - sweet egg

Know what? We cleaned our plates. Yes we did. The fish is fresh. A bit light on flavor for the mussels, but amazing taste for the sizzling beef. Since I'm accessing long term memory and my   hippocampus isn't cooperating, I'll have to keep it short. (Note to self, write review within a week of visiting business).

This place is well worth the drive. Perfect for that elegant date, without the outrageous prices and AYCE bustle. We shall see you again FANCY!",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,6,6,4,5cXFn692VU8_mWGZF7LBCA

5228792,2016-05-09,2,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"I've been to the other Oyshi location, on Rainbow, a handful of times when a friend is in town...its her favorite sushi spot.

Saturday night was the first time I'd been to this location, and I'd definitely return again.

For starters, we were there with a rather large group, about 13 people for a birthday party.  We were seated in the far corner of the restaurant, in a private nook.  It was a really nice section.  I like the look of this location better than the other one...to me, its brighter, and seems a little less run down.

The server we had, I want to say he said that his name was Kenny?  I think it said ""Golden"" on his nametag..., anyway, he was spectacular.   Funny, friendly, triple checked on our orders.  He was really on it.  

We were given a couple of ""specialties"" after we let Kenny know we were all having AYCE.  They brought out a ceviche, which I sadly, could not eat. (Avocado Allergy) Everyone else said it was delicious though.  They also brought out a Super White sashimi with a fried jalepeno on it, with an orgasm sauce (not sure if that's what they call it here, but that's what it was.).  This was really tasty. Super white is my favorite anyway, and the jalepeno was sweet with a nice kick.  

As always, my husband and I ordered nigiri.  
Most of what we ordered was pretty standard, but there were a couple standouts for me:

1.  The squid.  I've never eaten raw squid before; only grilled or fried.  I was anticipating a firm texture, like tako (octopus), but it was tender and delicious.  This was served with a piece of mint under the fish.  The flavor combination was out of this world.  A definite must have.

2. The Super White.  Tender.  Buttery.  Delicate...
Pro tip:  Order the fresh wasabi and put some on this. (put some on everything you eat, but this one especially.)  HOLY flavor punch, Batman!

3. The halibut.  Incredible.  I've had halibut a few times, but this one was exceptional.

We really had a good experience here.  The reasons I'm only giving three stars are:

1.  They missed a few pieces of our orders.  Not a huge deal...but I REALLY wanted those oysters, and we didn't really have the opportunity to ask for them, since we ordered those towards the end of the meal, and our server was trying to get a bunch of separate checks organized. 
2.  They charge for fresh wasabi.  One of my favorite spots does not charge extra for it, so this was a bummer.  We still got it, because a friend ordered it for us.  Its kind of a bummer to have your dinner budgeted and realize something you really love costs extra, when it doesn't at other places. Now that I know, if we return, we'll be better prepared. 
3.  Their hot sake is bloody expensive.  $8 for a large hot house sake?  I'm used to paying $3-5 for a large bottle.  
4.  At the end of the night, 3 drinks were brought out and only given to the front half of the table.  First of all...if you're only bringing 3 for us to share (since we didn't ask for them and were not charged for them)...you should probably do one for each section of the table so everyone can share a little bit of one.  Also, the drink was not made well.  It was a Moscow Mule, which is one of my favorites, and it was just not good.  WAY too much mint, not enough lime.  
5.  My creme brulee was given to someone at the head of the table instead of me, so I got a half eaten creme brulee at the end of my meal.  (yes, part of that was the fault of the people I dined with, for not asking who ordered it...but if you wrote it down correctly, you should have just brought it to me.)  

So...a good experience.  Service was MUCH better than the other location.  Other than the creme brulee thing, and missing my oysters, our server was really good.  People make mistakes, I'm not mad about it...but it does need to be stated.  

The food was standard, but again...better than the other location.  

I'd definitely come back.  It won't be my first choice, but I won't avoid it either.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,3,3,3,Ou--E3xAu6CSFO6NY-zWeg

This is the only Sushi place I come to. I've tried a lot of sushi places in Las Vegas, but it's hard to find a place that tastes like it's right on the coast. I'm very picky about quality when it comes to sushi, it's not like a burger where you can deal with it being mediocre. I started coming to this place about three years ago when it was operating under another name, but it's always had the same great quality and taste. 
 One thing I will say I did not like before was the service. It seemed like they didn't assign a server to your table, so you would just have all these confused servers asking you what you wanted, or needed, and having your order come out with occasional mistakes, and the constant interruption of people not knowing when you were last checked on. It's gotten much better over the years and I can see business has picked up a lot. 
  I always tell my friends from out of town to try this place instead of somewhere on the strip which costs 3x as much.

Our server was very helpful and guiding us through the menu and even helping us learn how to drink a sake bomb. We sat at the bar and cook was very helpful. Recommending cuts of fish that he thought we might enjoy. And even stearing us in the right direction for dessert. The price was only a few dollars more than where we used to go as regulars, but here we felt that we were treated nicer and also got fresher fish for our money.

Service: from the moment we walked in, we were greeted by great customer service. Throughout our experience here, they were attentive, service was fast and amazing.

Food: Wasn't ""blown away"" by the food but it was pretty decent. The quality and preparation was awesome and some exceeded expectations. For example, the oysters were very clean and served just right! (And this is coming from the guy who doesn't like raw oysters) The sea urchin sushi was superb too. I was too hesitant that it would be too raw and gooey but it was rich creamy like half boiled egg yolk. Try the surf and turf too because the meat wasn't a brush off. It was soft and juicy, for the price that was paid for it, it definitely stands out. All the sushi and the rolls, had great rice to ingredient ratios as well so you don't have to worry about getting too much rice and not enough seafood.

Also we tried to wave at him 3-4 times and he wouldn't acknowledge we were there.  It takes the fun out of going to a buffet.

    I counted forty signature rolls on there menu. My friend who visits the place frequently, suggested the ""High Roller."" It did not disappoint. The screaming sauce had a small bite to it. The ""Nuclear Bomb"" was my favorite of the night. The crunch flakes (I think it was coconut) gave the roll a great taste! I was feeling a little brave so I also ordered the Sea urchin with quail egg. It didn't look very appealing, but it wasn't gross either. Come to think of it, it didn't have much flavor at all.

5636441,2018-02-10,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"I've never visited Oishi Sushi. This review is based on a delivery order.

To say I was underwhelmed is a such an understatement, it's almost a lie. First, the sushi. Sushi is about rice first, and this rice was NOT sushi rice. It was unflavored and didn't hold together. The sushi pieces were impossible to pick up in one piece, not even with your hand, and the rice completely fell apart if any soy sauce hit it. As far as the fish, the halibut was meh, and the tuna was bait food; sinewy and more gray in color than red. The gyoza were over cooked, room temperature and dried out, like they'd been cooked yesterday and heated under a heat lamp. And the miso soup with clams was  just watery, with barely a hint of miso. The clams in the soup were okay, but sparse.

Isn't pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant to provide soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger with delivery orders? We got bupkus. I was surprised that they supplied chopsticks, the only thing this establishment did right!

I'm sure that most of the restaurants that contract with a delivery service aim to get return business and lure customers to visit their physical location. That concept seems to have been utterly side-stepped by Oishi Sushi. There are certainly two people here who will go out of their way to avoid this establishment. You simply can't slap some poor quality fish on some stale rice, most likely cooked in a rice cooker the day before, and call it sushi.

I'm usually pretty forgiving, but this meal, for thirty plus dollars, was the biggest disappointment and waste of money that I've had in a long time. The only thing acceptable was the quality of their waribashi (the disposable chopsticks).",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,1,6aNFI5i1CNkqp7b8kGXzcw

The restaurant interior surprised me. Very modern and comfortable. There are private rooms for larger parties. We were seated in a private room which was perfect since there were kids with us.

AYCE = $21 for lunch, $26 for dinner. You pay the dinner price at lunch if you want oysters, ebi and uni.

Our first round consisted of mostly appetizers.
Stand out apps:
potato croquette - very nice fried, good flavor
baked mussels - plump and covered with creamy sauce that has masago in it
shrimp & veggie tempura - good batter and slightly sweeter than normal tempura sauce
ahi poke - not a whole lot of fish, but great seasoning on a bed of greens

Appetizers that didn't really wow me: dynamite, spicy sashimi salad, fried calamari

Food came out in a very timely manner and the wait staff were attentive and quick.

Sushi:
SALMON BELLY received much praise
SPANISH MACKEREL was good but cut sloppily
YELLOWTAIL was not buttery but still tasted fresh
RED SNAPPER great texture and sweetness
UNI TOPPED WITH QUAIL EGG was a bit discolored which concerned me and didn't have too much sea butteriness to it but still enjoyable
EBI I passed on because I don't like raw shrimp but seemed okay. I tried to eat the brains but they were very shrimpy

OYSTERS plump and very white. I could've used more lemon or some sort of mignonette though

As for the rolls, they all started to taste the same. Lots of rolls are filled with krab, and topped with fish. The eel & avocado roll was very disappointing because there was too much of the teriyaki type sauce and the avocado was not ripe. Presentation was good, but the actual handiwork of the cuts wasn't that great. The salmon lover and sexy rolls had some sort of buttery yellow sauce drizzled on top that almost made me gag because there was a faint hint of banana to the sauce. I am not a banana fan.

Did the AYCE option (and upgraded to the dinner option) since it was cheat day for one of our friends so we could ordered items only available for the dinner AYCE price. So we ordered all the dinner only items and the assorted nigiri that we often ordered. Every thing was great. Service from the sushi bar was quick and before long we were almost too stuffed to ordered desserts.

The one thing I have to constantly remember to do when dining at most Korean-operated sushi restaurants is to ask the chef to go easy on the sauce or serve it on the side for all of the specialty rolls. But that is completely a personal preference thing.

Baked Mussels were a good appetizer to start our meal.

Seared Salmon Nigri - yum

Salmon Skin + Fresh Salmon and Ikura Handroll - make sure they put all the ingredients in one hand roll and not make three different ones.

Unagi Nigiri - good, but even better if slightly more caramelized.

Somewhere after two orders it took 35mins to get someone's attention to make another order and another 20 for someone to tell us they're making it. Our server never came back after he initially got lost, but came back to tell us ""sorry that's the way it works."" Bullshit. Tried to be understanding seeing as they were shorthanded, but then again the restaurant was only half full and 2 servers and 2 runners walking around. Not our fault they were understaffed. The other sad thing is not everyone in the service industry is taught customer service and it clearly showed here today. Obviously won't be returning even though one of the servers(not ours) tried to repair the situation as much as he could. Too bad because the food was decent albeit it got sloppy as the meal went on.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,2,1,1,my62-8M8vUlJHuZOvilkKA
5925951,2015-06-09,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,This place has always been great when it comes to AYCE. I usually force feed my gullet to get to the green tea creme brûlée. This is by far the best dessert I've had in my entire life. As far as the sushi goes I'm a big fan of the iris roll and garlic tuna. The surf and turf sizzle plate is worth it for sure and iced green tea is to die for. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable which is awesome too.,O1rMeY6WUNbwL8qTewtq9g,2,0,5,whQvweLZlPPARAMTPfy4cA

5933869,2018-05-26,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"Terrible. From the moment we walked in no one greeted us or even acknowledged us for a good 5 minutes. As we were about to walk us someone finally came to the desk and sat us. FYI no half sushi orders at tables, so we moved 2 feet over to the bar and it was ok... kinda strange. But what I couldn't deal with was dirty menus & dirty table tops. The sushi was just so-so. Definitely not worth $28 per person for all you can eat. Skimpy servings on the nigiri too. Definitely won't be back here. Oh and all the rolls have cream cheese wtf... I hate that!",bvPS4vrfiO7ZZ4KAo8KBTw,0,0,1,BO0C1OAGQ-dwzLueMSIhoA

Did not have the All you can eat sushi,  but the Lobster affair was fantastic. 
The service was great. 
Quality seems to be good, but a bit difficult to tell at this point. 
I think it is worth the effort to try.",keEO_xQHO_CSWNGejWhH-w,4,3,5,p6lJy8e1VjASx7Jq48B0ig
5964303,2017-04-01,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,"Only thing that prevented me from going to the fifth star was we weren't greeted in a timely manner even though a couple of workers came to the front counter. But everything else after that was very good. 

We met Kevin, GM, and found he was a very nice gentleman. He apologized for his crew not taking care of us when we showed up. 

Kenny was our server and he was very polite and patient with us. Always accommodating and attentive. 

The food was very good from the nigiri sushi to the rolls and the ribeye. 

The place was roomy and never felt crowded or our conversations drowned out. We were able to have a discussion without having to yell. Felt comfortable there. 

Had the AYCE (all you can eat) dinner and their rules are fair and written out plainly. If you are hungry, go for the AYCE as there were a great many choices that are included. Will be back when we are in town again.",hHkffb1XygE9-cEgMBO2JA,0,0,4,igJWQAtzQmQvArKYOLdomQ
5972303,2017-01-08,0,dzKDFiWLkspVBJKGfT0M2g,Not super impressed. I ordered the yellowtail jalapeño. Looked like a child sliced the tuna. Miso soup tasted like water. Cucumber salad looked like spaghetti and tasted chalky and weird. They have an all you can eat for 22 at lunch and 27 for dinner. I ordered the 3 things al a carte which totaled more than that (which was expected )but the quality did not match the price.,sW5ubhE3aJFcz1r-ecTLUA,1,0,1,OegP92maaEnEUYYEMpjY8Q
