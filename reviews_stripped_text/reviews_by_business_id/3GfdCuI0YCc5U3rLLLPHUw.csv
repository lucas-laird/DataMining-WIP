All servers are friendly and nice too:) I like their cute picture menu reminds me of local izakaya that I used to go to back in Japan:) I really like their Hamachi carpaccio. They use super yummy belly part with unique toppings with seaweed salad. Amazing! I also love Black cod misoyaki. Very traditional izakaya menu that I've always wished I could have here in Vegas. Well, now I can! They have variety of skewers and they are ok. Just OK though... It's not the best skewers you can get in town. Too bad:( But I like most of the other stuff they have. Chicken nanban is also my favorite! I usually ask them to cook chicken well done. I've had it little pinkish once so I just want to make sure it's well cooked when I order them:)
Over all it's my new favorite Japanese restaurant. I was so happy to have Warabi-mochi. I love Japanese old school sweets:)",Ji3EtstLPtwRFBLdZmCF0Q,1,0,4,g-IG57e6EdvVfszG0jYEHw

1503518,2014-11-01,5,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"Having a massive menu means one of two things: your kitchen staff is really talented OR you are spreading yourself too thin as a restaurant. Here, I was disappointed to reach the verdict that it's the latter.

HOT DISHES far outshine the cold ones here. SAUTEED MUSHROOM SALAD was a super-tasty dish to start with, and the onion dressing really made the dish. Great combination of flavors and textures.
The GRILLED SKEWERS COMBO ended up being my favorite: chicken thigh and green onion, roasted garlic, and bacon-wrapped tomatoes were excellent, while the shishito peppers and chicken meatball were just okay.
BF loved the MISO BLACK COD, but I felt versions we had at Ichiza and Sen of Japan were far superior. 

Cold dishes were extremely unbalanced- dishes almost seemed to be created to cover up the taste of low-quality fish, but the cuts we had here were great! Truly baffling. 
BEEF TATAKI and YELLOWTAIL CARPACCIO were both dismal: fish was nearly flavorless and bland, overpowered by the various toppings and sauces. 
SASHIMI SALMON-IKURA BOWL was essentially a Chirashi bowl composed exclusively of salmon and roe on rice. So, a salty fish with a  salty accent. Not sure why these two were combined, the quality of salmon was good but I couldn't take the salt overload.

Dessert was coffee mochi, which should be widely available everywhere but it's not. There's a free ice cream Yelp check-in offer with flavors including black sesame, my personal favorite, and yuzu. 

Service was mixed- very professional, but the fact that staff spoke limited English prevented us from fully understanding the menu/specials. Loved the French maid with bunny ears uniforms the female staff were wearing, male staff took our order, was helpful and professional.
Love the upscale interior, but confused by sushi-bar type seating, and sashimi on the menu, but no rolls- then again, their cold fish dishes were my least favorite, so maybe that's for the best.

1571536,2014-03-29,1,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"The newest Izakaya establishment in Las Vegas. They've just opened the door last week.

This place is conveniently located in a mall next to Palms Casino Resort, much closer to the center of the strip than most Japanese restaurants in Chinatown.

The owner has three restaurants in Tokyo, and this is their first branch in the US. No wonder that the foods are authentic, and of familiar modern feel if you've ever lived in Japan.

I'm impressed with the selection, from small bite appetizers (this is what Izakaya is all about!) to yakitoris to hot items. Qualitywise items can be hit or miss (guessing due to grand opening mess), but pretty good on average.

Some notable items are... salmon carpaccio with uni, deep fried octopus, bakudan, steak bowl.

Some yakitoris had meager portion but overall great creativity with decent pricing.

In Vegas, Izakaya-style Japanese restaurants are booming - Raku, Kyara, Ichiza to name a few - and Cocokala is a much welcomed addition to the scene.

The name is a bit hard to spell out, though. It's a play on words for ""koko kara"", which is a Japanese idiom that means ""from here"" - probably a twisted way to communicate with Japanese clientele.

The location is a great deal- I imagine I'll be eating here quite regularly.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,8,3,5,A8qUlkFYj12aUf23I9Bzsg

I was wondering wow it's 2 am and that place is open too! So instead of eating umiya I walked in, and the lemme tell you the interior design is what I noticed first. It looks like they put a lot of money into just making the inside look very very nice. I mean there's tables but a wall separating each for comfort and privacy. I look at the menu and there's SUCH a variety of stuff to choose from and omg I love variety. Especially when there's kinda expensive but still good quality stuff on the menu with cheap items too so you can pick whatever you're feeling for the night. The first thing I tried here was the salmon/avocado, I thought it was a salad at first but it's literally half an avocado with a mix of avocado chunks and salmon chunks for $10. That's a ridiculous price for such a small item BUT when I tried it, it was totally worth the $10. The service was pretty good, it wasn't slow when I was there and the server was very attentive to our needs.

2073999,2014-04-04,1,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"Being newly opened for only a couple weeks, this restaurant already seems to have its regulars with everyone coming in actually knowing each other; as if we walked in to a private event.  I guess that's a good sign of authenticity to their dishes since Japanese people frequent to this location.

Great selection of beer and sake.  Looking through the list, oyster stout sticks out more than others.  A bit apprehensive about getting it though due to the idea of it being brewed with shellfish.  Surprisingly, it tasted just like a Guinness with a minute hint of oyster sauce flavor.

Another first would be the bakudan--natto, tuna, yamaimo (mountain potato), and okra mixed in a bowl with spicy mustard and soy sauce.  This dish somewhat reminded us of the poached egg dish with sea urchin and salmon roe from Raku.  This, however, isn't for the faint of heart especially with the natto (fermented soy beans) that can be quite off-putting for those who haven't had one before because of its strong smell and slimy texture.

Everything else we ordered were delicious and cooked perfectly.  Too bad this place isn't robata, nonetheless, flavors were on point.  Go for the grilled Salmon Kama and you won't be disappointed.  Their yakitori are also reasonably priced.  I ended up ordering multiples of chicken gizzard and cartilage.

Overall, Izakaya Cocokala is a great addition to Japanese restaurants in the valley.  Delicious food, and superb service.  Dope place to hang out with friends.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,3,2,4,GcJkTEvZiZPn_WMNIhbf7g

With drinks like the Tokyo black porter-- coffee porter and cocoa flavor--and tapas that include fresh fish flown in from Japan, this place is worth it. I actually had a large event here and they did everything possible to make it easy for me--setup was done with immaculate detail and they were very accommodating to my requests.

Overall, out of the 4 times I've come here, these are my favorite dishes: 

-Beef tataki with a spicy ponzu sauce 
-Deep fried cartilage with curry seasoning
-Spoons of rice topped with sashimi
-Sautéed mushroom salad--they need to have a better name for this as it doesn't do the salad justice! This salad uses a special type of mushroom

What can I say about IC besides if you're coming here you're pretty much here for their alcohol cause the food, at least what I had, wasn't that great. The interior is very nice, I like, and the staff was friendly but slow and they have a pretty good selection of alcohol. I had a beer but don't remember what I had, I'm sure it was something that I randomly picked of the menu.

Maybe a few more larger skewers and not too fried I'd be nice. Even so it was too pricey and didn't taste so good.

Next was the Braised Black Pork Belly http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-cocokala-las-vegas?select=qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA#RFBIBkFfkoWItCH9vJYuMg which cost about $7. I didn't care for it.  Though it was cheaper and a little more filling than the Rice Cracker Skewers it almost tasted like eating an oily shoyu chicken but with pork belly. I needed some rice with it. It was pretty much the only decent food I had there. 

Next was the Black Cod Miso http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-cocokala-las-vegas?select=qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA#_uygK0YKC20X7Z0JvfRtHA which was $7.50. It was a nice small piece of black cod with a good char on didn't have much of any flavor to it.  Again I didn't care for it.

Order the kimchee for sure for a large portion of relatively healthy and satiating food.  Have some cold tofu, which again, satisfies, if you're into that--they top it with fish flakes and a delicious sauce.  Next order DOUBLE portions of their deep fried octopus.  I think they must season it with citrus of some kind and it is more than the simple sum of it's parts.

Sushi options are lacking here, but they also have amazing dip ramen and free ice cream with check in.  Also they have Big Dog (local beer) on draft for $3 during the happiest of hours.

- Lindsey Buckingham

After three visits I can't find a justification for paying a little more for items I typically like a little less here than I do at other places in town. 

Izakayas are one of my favorites, but here everything I've had is precisely A-OK. There are several items here that I don't typically see at other similar restaurants in town, so there may be redeeming characteristics to distinguish it from the pack for others, but not so much for me.

I would not avoid it if friends wanted to go here, but I'm also not going to make my way here of my own accord.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,11,6,3,VmyjrrxqTvISKRU-hp45KA

Their menu is amazing for its variety and reasonable prices.  We ordered the Sashimi, Grilled Hokke (Japanese white fish), and Organic Green Salad (prepared with bits of avocado and scallops) from the Blackboard Specials.  We also had a small order of Seaweed Salad and Green Tea Zenzai for dessert,  With two glasses of cold sake, this was a foodie's delight!  The Sashimi was very fresh, the Hokke was a whole fish by itself and was very filling.  But the dessert topped it all!  It's green tea latte, with green tea ice cream, mochi and red beans.  Delicious and refreshing!  Thanks to Andrew? (our server) who suggested it, but wish he would study the menu more for ingredients such as what greens in the salad?  We were given two complimentary cups of barley tea at the end to seal this beautiful meal!

This place is open until 3am everyday, but it was empty when we left at around 8:15pm on a Tuesday.  We were told that they get later crowds.  Highly recommend this place, my friend is from LA and she's a foodie, and she loved it!",gZBAENqjq7Lq6TwO5lcFZg,0,0,5,UBtWO28sOwlOKtq-FTQOQg

The thing is, there should have been no reason for it, as the place was more than half empty. but we ended up staying there for about 3 hours.

Now, I have seen some of the other reviews that didn't seem to have a problem with the service, so I am concluding that this was just some kind of fluke. I expect that when we return here things will be back to normal.

In any case, the food here is wonderful. We had two great ramen dishes here: the spicy miso ramen and the Tsukemen. Both were amazing. Followed it up with green tea ice cream and black sesame ice cream (also great). They also have a nice sake offering.

They gave me a seat at the bar to wait in and noticed i was still in uniform and struck up some conversation. There were two employees on the floor and they took turns chitchatting with me while we waited for my food to finish and i was the only customer there at the time. ( there was someone else there when i arrived but left a few minutes after i did). It was nice and it helped to pass the time. I knew one of the items was gonna take some time (chicken karaage always takes time) so i really appreciated it.

3167829,2015-03-24,1,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"Randomly scrolling through Facebook one night last week, I saw a suggested post pop up for Izakaya Cocokala. They were getting ready to celebrate their 1-year anniversary, and to share that celebration they were offering 50% off all their ramen for the day of and day after the anniversary date. Being that they haven't got the best of reviews in their year of being open, they never really came into my radar, but I wasn't going to turn down trying some new ramen for an Abraham. 

IC is a fairly small restaurant. When you walk in, there's a limited seating sushi bar, a handful of tables...and that's about it. They also have two small tables kind of hidden in the back that I guess is either for overflow or private parties. It's a bit dark inside the restaurant, but it's clean and I like that they have pictures of pretty much all their menu items hanging on the walls throughout it. 

Their menu, which seems to have been updated at some point during the last year (according to friends who had been here prior) has a ton of different offerings. Most of the items are tapas style, but there's also some meals and a lot of single skewer items. They have a specials board that changes on a regular basis as well. One great feature of IC is that they give you a nice little bowl of complimentary edamame to enjoy while browsing the menu.

Since we were mainly here for the ramen, we kinda refrained from ordering much else. Although for just a couple bucks, we couldn't resist trying a wasabi chicken skewer and some bacon wrapped asparagus. The chicken was decent enough for me to want to try some other ones on a future visit, but I missed out on trying to asparagus since my son scarfed them up. Guess that means they're good too!

Their ramen choices are somewhat limited, but they offer a style I've never seen before. I actually ended up having to noob out and Google what Tsukemen Ramen is. They call it 'Red Impact' here, but what sets this style of ramen apart is that it's a ""dipping"" ramen. Basically you get all the classic ramen items like the noodles, bean sprouts, meat, eggs, etc on a side plate and then they give you a separate bowl of ""broth"" to dip it in. This one was actually a little more pricey at $6.50 with the 50% off, but it was worth every cent. Their broth is more like a sauce (obviously, right?), and it was visibly oily, but that ended up being a good thing. I chose Level 1 out of 4 possible heat levels, and while I personally could have went up a level, it had a decent amount of heat. The broth was all a little salty and a tad on the sweeter side, but the flavors mended together very well. Because it's a bit thicker and more oily, the noodles and other items seemed to really soak up the flavors well. The only thing that might be a downfall for some is that it's not quite as easy to sip on and take spoonfuls of like standard ramen broth. Overall thought this was an excellent bowl of ram and I wouldn't hesitate to spend the full asking price of $13 on it. 

The service was decent, but a little strange for me. We arrived about 10 minutes before our friends, and even though the place was nearly dead, I felt like we were kind of being rushed. They constantly looked at us and asked if we wanted to order stuff before the rest of our party arrive. Then throughout the rest of our meal, the servers stood like 5 feet from our table and just kind of stared at us and the other tables. I'm all for staying on top of things, but maybe back off on the creep factor a tad. 

I know I said it before, but due to their limited amount of decent reviews, IC wasn't really on my radar. And had I not seen their Facebook past, I'm not so sure I would have ever went out of my way to eat here, but I'm glad that I did. The ramen alone is enough to warrant a return visit, and the rest of the menu just looks too interesting to pass up. We shall meet again IC!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,2,4,4,LOzroC8JoJL2SSfZ4Fk0AQ

Another new Izakaya in town! Seeing other fellow Yelpers check in, it was only a matter of time until we had the chance to experience Cocokala for ourselves.Very wide selection from skewers to grilled items, entrees, daily specials and everything in between. The alcohol selections here are pretty extensive too. I went with an Interesting sounding Oyster Stout which had a similar taste to Guinness Stout which I enjoyed.

For the food, the complimentary cold Edamame was good, and we also tried the Karaage, Beef Tongue(plate), Miso Black Cod and three of their spoons-Avocado, 
Uni-Nori, and Salmon-Ikura. While the Karaage was tasty, all the others were forgettable. The spoons were basically knockoff nigiri on a spoon, no one can touch Ichiza's Kushi-Tan, period...I've had better black cod at Goyemon, Sen of Japan, Ichiza, Soho, and even the Marketplace Cafe at the Cal!!! Shishito was nothing special, and the Yuzu Soda is nothing like Cafe De Japon (RIP) used to serve.

With the wide selections, and prices a bit higher, quality has to improve greatly to compete with my two favorite spots in nearby Chinatown....ALOHA!!!

Slow. However, I thought it was cool how they explained their daily specials using an iPad. One of the server did a quick ""presentation"" on their specials and the popular items. 

FOOD
They have a massive menu. Mostly skewers, but they also have rice bowls, noodles and variety of hot and cold dishes. I do like having a large selection but it was kind of overwhelming. Things I ordered (only managed to get a pic of tuna tataki due to the bad lighting) :

Tuna Tataki: You have the option of beef or tuna. It came with 8-10 slices of tuna drenched in a ponzu sauce with a little bit of garlic and jalapenos. Ponzu was overpowering but still one of my favorite dish. 4/5

Chicken Nan Ban Bowl: I am fairy picky with my chicken nan ban. This was not the chicken nan ban I am used to eating. It was basically a fried chicken, or karaage drizzled with tar tar sauce. I like the traditional nan ban, which is fried chicken with sweet/sour sauce. Tar tar sauce was ok with chicken, but did not go well with rice. 3/5

Thunderbird: This was from their signature skewer menu. It is a chicken thigh with radish, garlic and ponzu. Chicken was extremely dry and cold. 2/5

The good: decent service considering our initial server had very little information when we asked questions about items on the menu. That was disappointing but we just winged it. We are foodies after all. also they are open until very late, 4am I believe .. So it adds to late night options available. 

The not so good: the quality of everything was a 3 out of 5 on every dish. Nothing really stood out. Nothing came out very hot if it was meant to be, and nothing was really presented really well otherwise.

Anyways ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen with extra noodles, and Grilled Saba. Wow the Saba was very tasty indeed but the Ramen was on the very average almost on the bland side but still good. Other people in the party also ordered the Miso Ramen and Shrimp Tempura which was also cooked very well. The Red Bean ice cream and Mochi ice cream also very good.

4428155,2015-09-16,0,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,Decided to try this place for lunch. Surprisingly their lunch menu was all ramen. I was a bit confused since this place is mainly known for Japanese tapas and sushi. Nevertheless I can never pass up ramen so I chose the Shoyu ramen which came with salad and a salmon bowl. The salad came first and I was shocked that they used Thousand Island dressing instead of traditional dressing that most Japanese restaurants use. Then came the salmon bowl. Did not know what to expect but the salmon was sashimi style on top of the rice and it was awful. I tried eating just the salmon but it was warm from the rice. I was hoping the ramen would save this meal. Thankfully it did. Thank god. The Shoyu ramen was good. I've definitely had better at my usual ramen spots. I'm just happy that this place wasn't a complete fail. I don't think I will be coming back.,edTwEJEOdn9i8WDAgMk49w,1,0,2,CFefHPcB4Opq_lQ4swdC0Q

The general consensus was that we all liked it and would want to come back. I ordered the potato salad which was much bigger than I thought - it was fresh and tasted great! I also had the tempura bowl which was pretty sizable as well and I quite enjoyed it. The restaurant is on the smaller size, but it's very clean and well decorated. The service was also great - everyone was welcoming and responsive. 
Also I highly recommend the spider salad if you have a big group as an appetizer - it was amazing!",5v-AwqH02Qk9UR_fgoiKUw,0,0,5,sQ7jlFgefFMnISx2XtM_2Q
4656265,2015-12-24,0,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"It's very unfortunate that a good establishment goes awry by under- and inexperienced staffs (servers and chefs) without proper supervision.  Restaurants are half foods and half services in U.S. (maybe 80:20 in Japan so the restaurant may assume the ratio here, too) ; yesterday foods were decent (except the ""cold"" cheese dish and the ""colder"" beef tongue).  It was obvious that restaurant was understaffed so we didn't say anything to the servers who kept apologizing for the frequently delayed services.  The staffs' badly handling of the missing (forgotten) orders, infrequent attentions to customers (much needed when busy), and the delayed orders among tables, is plainly forgivable, but the lack of proper supervision tonight , as time went by, exacerbated the situation that led ultimately to a loss of our interests on patronage.  It was a day before Christmas Eve; I assumed that the restaurant was caught off guard with the unexpected amount of guests, thus understaffed, but one little wisdom of management in a chaos can save a restaurant from a disaster, and from going bust (given half the restaurants in Las Vegas do).  I wish they could survive in this highly competitive environment because I like their idea of bringing an authentic Izakaya foods to U.S..  But, given their foods are decent, in order for them to survive, their service has to be, ironically, half-Americanized (a friendly but mechanical manner seen at respectable Raku, or now-growing-popularity Izakaya Go).  I really hope they can achieve the balance.

The overall service and food was great. Our food came out in a timely manner and the server was very sweet. She kept apologizing about making us wait but there was honestly no delay. Im a regular at kyara and the food over there takes forever, especially grilled dishes. However all the skewers came out fast and none of the dishes were salty!!! Huge plus for me.

Definitely will be back again to explore the different beer selections as well.

4744314,2014-04-21,2,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"Some say that first impressions are everything.  For me, Izakaya Cocokala's first impression was inconclusive.  Compared to other izakayas in town, Cocokala's offerings are higher in price, but not necessarily higher in quality.

My favorites were the chawanmushi, miso cod, and I believe the braised pork belly bowl.  The chawanmushi was light on the seafood, but it was a good version of the dish.  The miso cod was flavorful, but a very small portion.  The braised pork belly was served in a rich broth, and was tender enough to easily pull apart with chopsticks.  

One disappointment was the bakudan dish, which had natto as one of the main ingredients.  Instead of the expected intense smell and flavor of the soybeans, it turned out to be a very bland dish.  I only managed to eat it with hot mustard added.  Our table also ordered several skewers, all of which were average and a bit pricey.

So although Cocokala's first impression wasn't what I was hoping for, there was enough there that I want to go back and try more of the menu.  I'm not in a rush to do so, but at least one more visit will be made once the sake bar next door opens.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,5,4,3,Y8RoNknY-HCDZ5JU4Nsq6Q

They have a pretty extensive menu of Japanese finger food and Ramen.  I decided on garlic edemame, chicken karaage and their skewer special.  The edemame was some of the best I've ever had.  The skewers were really good, although I'm not sure why anybody would order the cartilage.  The karaage's breading was a bit too sweet for me, but it was still good.

If it wasn't for the single SUV parked out front, I might've passed by assuming it was closed. I am so glad I didn't! I wasn't that hungry so tapas was a good option. I ordered the dark seaweed salad and onion slice off the specials menu, and also the yellowtail carpaccio. The dark seaweed was a nice change from the usual green stuff. The onion slice was not what I expected. It was finely shredded in ponzu sauce and topped with dried fish flakes. Refreshing with a delicate kick. The carpaccio had a citrus burst but the knife work was unattractive. I also tried the takoyaki. It was ok. The sauce that was on top made it better. My partner in crime ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen with chicken. Chicken? The chicken was actually really good but the broth wasn't anything to brag about.

Good selection of beers and sake. We come for the food. A few favorites are:

Sashimi - tuna, yellowtail, or whatever's on their specials board
Black cod miso - buttery and savory
Yellowtail carpaccio 
Chicken nanban - karaage type chicken with a tangy sauce. A must try
Skewers - shishito peppers, chicken thigh, beef tongue

It took 40 minutes for them to process our credit cards. How do you open a restaurant without learning how to use the credit card processing system before hand? Please learn how to run a business better.

It has a great little menu with pictures so you can see what the food will look like when it comes out and it can help you decide on what you want. We're pretty critical on Japanese restaurants here in Las Vegas because a lot of the times if you want good fish you have to pay a lot and most restaurants freeze their fish which makes it lose the taste. This place was pretty good. We ordered the grilled squid which I really enjoyed. The yellowtail and grapefruit which was good except I'm not too much of a fan of grapefruit. We also ordered the beef carpaccio and the tuna carpaccio which was also pretty good. We ordered other plates but those were the best. At the end of the bill we were surprised it only came out to less than 80 dollars because we ordered a good amount of food.

5519380,2016-07-28,0,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"First impression upon being seated at the table was that it felt like sitting in a cubicle. Each of the tables along the wall were blocked off from one another by black-painted wooden walls, making the individual spaces slightly tight for a table of four. The space was made much darker with inadequate lighting in addition to the black walls on either side. But I suppose it's a plus if you prefer more privacy.
With half an hour of happy hour (5pm - 7pm) left, I ordered a $4 beer, $4 steamed shrimp dumplings (3), and $5 tuna poke. Their happy hour menu is pretty extensive, and the prices very reasonable. The dumplings were great, but the tuna poke wasn't as much. There wasn't enough flavor to the poke and the tuna wasn't cold enough..as if it's been sitting out elsewhere for a while. I ordered a tempura udon as entrée and that was pretty good as well. Overall the experience was nothing too out of the ordinary.

5529233,2014-04-01,18,3GfdCuI0YCc5U3rLLLPHUw,"Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects a lot of what would be found at a typical street corner izakaya in Japan with a couple of wrinkles from the norm.  I was excited to check it out.  Things were looking even better when I was the only non-Japanese patron in a restaurant 75% full on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign!  

Shocking me right off the bat was being served cold edamame.  Although typical in other places (like umm..Japan?), I've actually met people who grew up in Vegas thinking edamame was always served hot.  Even I expect it to be hot everytime in LV now for chrissakes.  I could tell this place gave a damn about ""keeping it real"" just from these itty bitty green things.

My wife was ready to order ""bakudan"" as soon as we sat down.  She thinks natto (fermented soybeans that smell like the foot of a corpse and taste even worse) is the single greatest culinary contribution from Japan to the world.  Cocokala's version included said item, tuna, okra, yamaimo (mountain potato) and spicy mustard.  Mix everything up and go to town because you're a braver person than I.  She thought this was awesome.  

I didn't expect the grilled saba (mackerel) to be my favorite dish but it totally was.  Nice portioned filet with a terrific char, tender meat and the oil from the fish had me considering another order as soon as I finished.  This went very well with their samurai barley beer which was their strongest brew at 10% alcohol.  

I also had a bottle of their stout brewed with oysters which tasted like you'd expect.....super funky Guinness.  My wife loved their Echigo red ale.  All the premium brews are $9-$10 for a 12 oz bottle.  They also have a nice selection of sake and shochu.      

Their chawanmushi (egg custard) was chockful of seafood deliciousness that rivaled Kyara's version.  I also thought highly of their take on black cod miso.  It's everything you'd expect at a very reasonable price.  

Chicken cartilage skewers were something I missed dearly from my days in Japan.  Usually the cartilage is stripped naked of any meat before it's grilled but I kind of liked it better their way with chicken meat still on it.  Cocokala would become my new best friend if they started serving fried chicken cartilage :)

Some stuff didn't make this visit five stars but they're all things that are correctable and are probably due to being so new.  I thought the white meat yakitori were very dry.  The ume jiso (sour plum sauce) kind of masked the dryness a little but the wasabi yakitori wasn't good.  They mistakenly added a grilled hamachi to our receipt.  And instead of being offered a refill of water, the glasses were simply taken away.  

None of these are very big issues.  I am just happy there's another quality izakaya in town!!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,31,21,4,InPQwaHeteb1xCkoc8Bang

Our order:

-Sea Urchin and Salmon Carpaccio:  Uni for under $10?!  Uni was not incredible on its own, but the dish together was delicious!  I don't even want to know how they can price uni so low.  Accept and move on...8/10

-Chicken Cartilage:  Why would someone order the cartilage?  For some, animal connective tissue is considered healthy for your skin.  For me, I grew up eating it, and actually love the crunchy texture more than meat itself.  This rendition is simply salted and still had some meat attached.  Good.  7/10

-Sea Urchin and Nori Paste Spoon:  This was delightful, and not at all salty despite the nori paste.  Again, it's uni and it's at a crazy price, but is still fresh.  8/10

-Sake and Ikura Bowl:  This is a generous bowl of chirashi for less than $8...Why on earth is this place considered $$ by Yelp?!  Sake wasn't even cut thin.  Incredible.  9/10
