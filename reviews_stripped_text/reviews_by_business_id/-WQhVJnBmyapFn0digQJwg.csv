The older lady was super nice. I mean REALLY nice. She gave my spouse and I a TON of free samples of every single thing we wanted to try and even things we weren't initially interested in. She was extremely generous with the samples for both of us. Truth be told, because she was so nice and generous, we felt we should buy something. 

The stuff tasted good, but was a bit pricey. Though this kind of stuff is normally pricey. We ended up buying a small bag of toasted coconut chips ($7.99), a can of crunchy, dried pineapple bits ($7.99) and a 16oz bottle of water ($2 We were thirsty after all those samples! lol). There was a deal that if you buy four, you get one free or buy five for $35 or something like that.",YmuHitzT-bWAptpd1QY0YA,0,0,3,5XcR-4ONAFSL1LqrAGLCQA

I got the dried papaya. I'm sorry I forgot your name but thanks for making it easy to choose from the top favs. Definitely a nice alternative from unhealthy snack to something healthy,cdB_dIYHieklXNyvmrXweA,0,0,5,V9PPV3KyK3uDsBjgOwqr-Q

You can try all the fruits too before making a final decision. Try the banana BBQ chips, YUM!

The lady who helped us was super friendly, excited to help and really knew the products! 

Check them out",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,5,2,4,EnKrjP5UQY_oGBM0lvRmlg
3073061,2017-11-10,0,-WQhVJnBmyapFn0digQJwg,"This review is for the stand located in the south premium outlets...I am a sucker for dried fruit and this cart had a great selection of it. The problem is they charge $7.98 per box which includes tax. The added sugar in these products are definitely not necessary... I really enjoyed the unique items I bought here including chipotle pineapple, chili mango, ginger sesame, and hibiscus. However most of them were way too sweet. To my dismay I was at Walmart tonight and noticed they sell the nutty and fruity brand in the produce area for $3.98 a box, however, they only carry like 4-5 selections. From what I hear you can get the stuff online way cheaper. Won't return to the cart, only because of price. Too bad, because they had a lot of unique tasty items like pomelo, starfuit, and hibiscus.",LQYiHRsbRGM3e3DkmKPHVw,0,0,3,G_xnHmssFF7af-_XFlTGbQ

4363197,2015-06-30,1,-WQhVJnBmyapFn0digQJwg,"While shopping at the Las Vegas Premium South Outlets, we stopped by the food court. When leaving, we stopped to look at FruitLand which caught our interest. We were greeted by one of the workers and given SAMPLES ON SAMPLES of everything we wanted to try, plus a few recommendations of her own. As my dad said ""By the time we're done here, we don't need to go out for lunch!""

After trying various items, we were sold on the toasted coconut slices and caramelized bbq banana chips. If you have tried Potato Corner's bbq powder, this is almost identical. The toasted coconut were sweet and a nice healthier snack alternative. 

The only downfall .. boxes are pretty pricey at $7.99 each.",DT5JuPKzBEyJCN3EwZV9KQ,1,1,4,py85_KRnBYLQZpzOUheHZA

The ladies whom work at this stand are quite friendly!  Samples provided on all they sell.  BEST part is nothing is man handled, tongs are used and they are clean!  I purchased the pecans and coconut- TUMMY!  The toasted coconut is tasty and a healthy snack! No additives or preservatives!!!  It's in an outlet mall, making it a planned out event of going and dealing with tourists (hence the four stars).",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,0,0,4,1TgrSlCdMERym78yOTYL_g

You can sample as much of the dried fruit as you want. My favorite were the tangerine wedges and the natural dried pineapple, but the hibiscus is really interesting. I'll have to read up on the nutritional value of it. They are $7.99 a box, and there's a check-in offer for buy 5 boxes and get 1 free. The woman told me they have a shelf life of, like, 2 years. I'll be back every time I'm in the outlets!",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,8,6,5,HRMqxJ43n07nbUBOk2tprg
