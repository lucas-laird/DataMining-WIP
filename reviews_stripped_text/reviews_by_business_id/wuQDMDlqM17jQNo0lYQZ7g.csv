14272,2014-01-10,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,I went to Park on Fremont yesterday and had an amazing meal. I had the chili and  the half baby backed ribs. I would recommend those highly and don't forget to get a beer in a jar. FYI it's best to park at the El Cortes and not the parking lot next to park. It's only one dollar an hour at the El Cortez vs 20.00 for the unsuspecting tourist.,kp4ES15mhsPHR1uIx2AYHA,0,0,5,AT2wmIJfNKFXpgPSsQ91tg

40739,2013-04-20,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"This place is great!  A few friends and took a quick trip to Vegas and stayed at the Golden Nugget.  A co-worker recommended Park on Fremont for great drinks and food in downtown LV.  He was spot on.  The drink menu is great - I couldn't resist the Unicorn (ginger beer, absolut citron, mint, simple syrup, Im missing something...) which was a little sweet but easy drinking.  My friends opted for the shot and beer. The food was pretty damn good, too.  They offer a great variety of options for carnivores and vegetarians.  I tried the veggie sliders and sweet potato tots.  The sliders were very good with whole wheat buns and a great citrus sauce.  The tots are very different that regular tater tots - sweet sprinkled with cinnamon and very reminiscent of doughnuts.  I'm on the fence about 'em.  I just wasn't in the mood for sweet, should have ordered fries instead to satisfy that craving.  The sriracha/ketchup blend was a perfect accompaniment to the tots, a little spice and a ton of flavor really balanced the sweetness of the tots.

A great alternative to the usual douchy LV Strip bars.  The atmosphere is great, lots of locals and a younger crowd, outdoor seating.  Great art, a ton of stuffed birds behind the bard, and a beautiful Mark Ryden print by the kitchen.  Super friendly staff.

Our waitress couldn't have been better.  She was super nice and very attentive, gave us her recommendations, which we tried, and was just overall fantastic.  I didn't catch her name but I wish I had so I could properly compliment her service (petitie asian gal with a bright, friendly smile).",aa-JlDWfqUD15jeQyKGKVw,1,0,4,5xOA7WQJk8u60Air-_mZwA

My party wasn't able to enjoy the back because I had my one year old son, the host stated there was a bar in the back. Later on  while speaking with management about the services they stated  ""we could have sat out back, the bar was being moved and not in service"". After ordering we waited for 45min for our food to arrive. The waitress only came to the table twice out of the two hours of us being there. Once to drop off the food and once to drop off the drinks, we had to ask twice for refills. After getting our food my sister had the wrong order delivered, when she finally got her order there was a black hair mixed into the guacamole. The manager on duty spoke with my 15 year old sister about the experience we had. Even though I tried speaking she directed everything to a child at the table. I found this to be a joke given there was two adults who were paying for the meals. The restroom stalls had no toilet paper.I was pretty sad I spent money on this place I thought my family could enjoy.",MDrsV7SxWp84FcUH9Ux6xA,0,0,1,N-4sL9Swy193MRfyJNMnNQ

Got the buffalo chicken wings and one of their mules (the twigs and berries: think gin & elderflower liquor as the basis for a refreshingly lime ginger fuzz thing), and both were great. The people in the back of the house clearly know what they're doing. The front of the house, however, was weak. Our waitress was slow, and irritable, and I don't think it's an isolated bad apple.

Our group works in show business here and would be coming after shows. 
Whoever answered the phone a week ago said they would make a reservation for me to ensure staffing. I called to double check yesterday morning and there was no reservation, nor enough staff. After discussing this with Julie, my understanding was that they would be staffed, and would take care of our large group who loved this bar. Also discussed was that on their site it states open till 3am. We would definitely be there till at least 2. She stated they usually close at 1 on Tuesdays but if there was business they stay open. Great! 
Nope. I arrived to last call at 12:20am, a bar of 30+ people (almost ALL) were our group and an obstinate and ridiculous manager stating no one was there at 11:30p like the reservation said ( not true as well) so they were going to close. CLOSE WITH A FULL BAR AND MORE COMING. 
Unacceptable. 
We left immediately, deciding to give our money and very loyal patronage to #donttellmama across the street. 
Worst manager ever. Owners will be contacted.

We've been to PoF many times and I've hosted quite a few lady brunches there.  On 8/8/15 we met up with some friends who are from out of town. We suggested that we all go to PoF to avoid a lot of the drama and crazies you encounter downtown. We arrive and a heavy set African man asked to see our id's in such a manner that it already set a bad tone for our friends new experience there.  We then go sit in the back yard and wait for 17 minutes. Nobody came by. We tried to ask a female server with her head shaved on the sides of she could serve us or send someone else and she responded with your not in my section. She acted like we insulted her by U.S. Asking for service. I ask my husband to go inside with his friend  to the bar and get us drinks. My girlfriend and I are waiting for another 15 minutes. We go inside to find the bouncers harassing our husbands claiming that they broke a light fixture in the men's bathroom. They took there id's and called the police. We go outside to wait for metro and as we are waiting the bouncers and the hostesses are antagonizing us. Acting like children. The heavier set African American man even went as far as sticking his tongue out at us. Yes.. You read that correct.. A grown man acting literally like a toddler. After metro showed up they couldn't pin the broken light fixture on my husband. They had him in handcuffs and everything. I asked for all the employees names that were outside taunting us and they refused. I have never in all my years living in Vegas have dealt with such unprofessional staff. I will do my best to let all of our friends in the art community, entertainment community and out of towners to avoid this business. I highly recommend the owners train the staff to act like civilized humans instead of animals. If any of my employees behaved in such a manner I would fire them on the spot. Also I will be conducting an investigation to get all of these staff members names and will update my yelp review with this information.

124328,2013-05-02,1,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"I really love everything that's going on around East Fremont; with all of the new bars and restaurants the scene is really coming together. But along with all those new venues comes droves of hipsters almost as intolerable to me as the droves of tourists on the Strip, so I tend to visit this area during the day for lunch and weeknights. My impatience aside, the downtown area needs great food to go with its great bars, so I was very excited to hear that the new Park on Fremont was going to be serving more than just snacks. Billed as a gastro-pub, this recently abused word suggests a fancy array of snacks and main dishes to go along with a large drink menu. But can this suggestion truly become a reality?

Park has recently opened, taking over the failed 18+ hookah lounge that was there previously in a prime location on the corner of East Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. It sits alongside another neighborhood newcomer Radio City Pizza, and all of the other popular First Friday spots that have quickly taken over the scene with long pretentious lines to get in. I hate waiting to get in to places on the Strip, this new development of ropes and lines on Fremont is a bit much, even as 'cool' as some of these places might be. The interior of Park is quite odd, and I'm not quite sure how to explain it. Striking wall coverings, cool art, and stuffed birds decorate the interior dining and bar area, with a small patio up front and a large outdoor 'park' in the back complete with an adult teeter totter and plenty of lights. I went during the day so the inside was more than fine, although I'm sure the outdoor area in the back looks much better at night. While their menu has some interesting sounding items, it's kind of all over the place and I've heard most sound better than they actually taste. Options like a fried chicken and waffle sandwich, Philly mac and cheese steak and a corned beef Reuben all sound tasty, if not unhealthy.

Either way, I'm not here to report second hand information, I'm here to tell you about my burger experience. And in this case, it's their stuffed burger with Monterey jack and cheddar, and applewood bacon. Upon picking it up I bit into my dry bun with a really cold spot in the center where the pickles were sitting. What's with all the cold buns lately? The meat had no decent flavor on its own; it wasn't bad but it wasn't seasoned or presumably anything special. There was surprisingly some pink to the meat, which is a rare sight for a stuffed burger given how much longer they usually have to be cooked, although given the unknown quality of the meat I'm not sure if this is a good thing. The bacon inside was soggy and took away from any cheese or onion flavors, which weren't anything too great either. The lettuce, tomato and onion on top were fresh and ok, but overall there was nothing special about this burger which was surprisingly dry despite being stuffed with so much.

The fries were nothing special either; of the larger cut variety, but soggy and barely at room temperature. It seems like the reports I've heard are true: everything here looks way better than it actually is, which is surely unfortunate as I really want everything that opens in this particular area to be great. Still, I'm sure it will do just fine as this food is probably more than acceptable for the drunk crowd that takes over East Fremont all weekend. Just not for the overly critical like myself. $12 for a stuffed burger and fries is a reasonable price, I just wouldn't recommend it when you have better options close by at Triple George and newly opened La Comida (review for their really good burger coming next week).",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,2,2,3NBtyQMjxobDyPlmdfA4ow

It was Halloween night and me and my coworkers wanted to have a nice night out so we chose to have a quick late meal here paired with drinks. Later they wanted to go home so we said our goodbyes at the front then needed to use the restroom so proceeded to the front doors. I noticed the security guard arguing with my friend who politely mentioned she needed to use the restroom and was a paying customer and he loudly made a scene about how they were closed and mocked her.  
All while the manager was standing near, not doing anything. I understand it was getting late and close to closing time but it was around 2:30am mind you, they close at 3am plus there were about 20 something people inside the establishment. Soon after we ended up using restroom and I noticed people at the back courtyard area so I didn't see a big deal to step foot and show my friend the seesaw room really quick. We found a nice guy who was with his group of friends and asked him to take a photo. But was immediately interrupted by the woman manager who seemed to follow us and said we cannot take the photo and demanded us to leave. How spiteful of her to choose to pick on us in front of other guests. The guy holding my camera was flabbergasted at the manager and said ""that was really rude,"" and took the photos of us anyway. I just wanted to show my friend a room she's never seen before and figured it would change her upset mood over the security guard incident. And didn't see the big deal of taking a quick look before we headed out, in addition there were still a lot people! The manager threatened to call metro, we were so polite I didn't feel that was necessary. Not even 3am yet. Both the security guard and manager felt the need to argue with us and make a seen in front of other paying customers. Had they known we are in the hospitality business too, I've also written content about Las Vegas venues and ""Things to Do"" around Vegas, and my friend was looking into Park for her wedding reception, would they have treated us better?

Service absolutely needs to be improved but they just opened so Im sure in a few weeks the speed and quality of service will be improved greatly. The employees were all very kind and excited-- just working out the kinks! 
Everything was lovely! We first arrived and were seated on the front bar side patio. I had been very excited for Park to open as I had seen images of the interior and it looked like an artists own personal version of Alice in Wonderland. The back patio opened at 6 so after our first round of drinks we moved to the back.  It is lovely-- down to every detail we truly appreciated everything. Its trendy, artistic, perfect for downtown and it definitely is going to be a local hotspot.  Its somewhat similar to Commonwealth but its more like its Hipster sister. 

Ordered stuffed sprout & swiss burger with sweet potato tots-- ketchup was homemade spicy which was very interesting. Overall really delicious-- can't wait to go back!",PtdEhM_Xv5r64Z5oKTOiIQ,0,0,4,QAmxDtL7D8OFnC731CHcEg

There is limited seating inside and out front, but the best place to eat is on the park like patio in the back of the building. The building is out of place for this urban setting, it looks more like a Southern California beach shack in the 1970's. The interior decor looks to be photos and art from a bad dream. The food and service is what makes the place great! Our limited exposure included the best fried pickles that I have ever had. The Old School Park sandwich was selected at the recommendation of the server. It included brisket, Pastrami, coleslaw and a few other garden items on a french roll.

Typically, after being greeted and seated by the host/ hostess we wait an average of 5-7 minutes for our drink order to be taken. They have a good variety of craft beer (our drink of choice) either on draft or bottled.

Our go to order is usually the chicken bar bites with their assorted dipping sauces and a side of the sweet potato tots (highly recommend the honey mustard sauce -- this from someone who doesn't really like honey mustard :)  as well as a Build Your Own Burger, or BYOB for short, with a side salad. 

Our only complaints would be  1) after ordering a burger cooked to medium and receiving it well done can be disappointing and 2) the wait time to actually GET your drinks after ordering can be a little lengthy.

Overall good food, great atmosphere (though if you don't want to be bothered by the transients walking by, do not sit along the fence outside!!) and friendly people. Very highly recommended!!",YzkSsvDBFGJcO6AtHR3Y-A,0,1,4,I05MhqUwuJG29impam3Ilw

Granted it was a really busy night and it was one of the few places that weren't charging people to get in. (Seriously DTLV?) 

My boyfriend and I sat ourselves at the largest table available in the main room, yeah it was only 2 of us at the time of seating, but we were waiting for 2 others to join us. We sat around for 10 minutes, while all the waitresses ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know if their manager doesn't know how to properly assign sections (with them running in and out of the room to the back, but it seemed like they could barely handle the large volume of people). We waited and waited, made eye contact with several people and still no service. I urged my boyfriend to go up to one of them at a computer putting an order in, and she proceeds to tell him that she's ""cut."" First of all, I'm a server at a high volume restaurant on the strip and I completely understand how annoying it can be when you're super busy and the last thing you want is to add another thing to do to your list of many, but how hard is it to tell a customer, ""let me find a waitress/server who can help you."" ??? Not that f*ing difficult. 

I was pissed and got up myself, looked for someone who would be standing around doing NOTHING (usually managers) sure enough I saw a gentleman standing behind the bar just people watching and walked directly to him and asked him if there were any servers serving the tables in the area because we had yet to be acknowledged. He pretended to act surprised as if he himself didn't see us either, and pointed at the girl... where else, AT THE COMPUTER. Hmmm, really?? All I wanted was to order drinks, shots and a side of french fries. EASY! I'm not a tough customer especially when I can tell people are overwhelmed. She drops our shots off (chocolate cake) no lemons and no sugar. I'm not a bartender, but I'm sure everyone knows they come with both. We ask her for both, walks away. Comes back with a few lemons in a cup and 2 packets of sugar and tosses them on the table and walks away. LITERALLY WALKED AWAY. No, ""is there anything else i can get you?"" no nothing. I was so pissed. I assured my boyfriend and our guests that she wouldn't return until one of our cups were empty or all of them, and I was right. We got our ticket, left no tip and thats exactly what she deserved. I never leave bad tips, but wow service was an embarassment.

Such a nice place to go if you want to just look around and enjoy the decor, go straight to the bar yourself or else you'll be getting crappy service. Park on Fremont, really need to reconsider the type of people their hiring. Yeah they're pretty and attract a bunch of drunk, high paying customers. But if you can't deliver decent service, then whats the point??? ALL IN ALL, I'd rather pay 10-20 to get into commonwealth or any other bar downtown than to go back to park on fremont.

What happened on Friday evening was out of everything I have ever seen and heard. I understand that NYE/NY is stressful time being at work (or in general working in a place like Las Vegas) but wow.

We arrived with our group of friends (who had just gotten married that day by the way). We wanted to sit outside and out waitress told us that it is ""no problem"" and ""we get the heaters for you, I'll come back when you have all settled.""
There was a guy who was dealing with the heaters and one of the guys in our group asked ""How long is it going to take, we are freezing? Just wondering if you need any help...?"" The guy didn't say anything so we just assumed he was okay.

Service was good, food was good and we tipped above average.

When it was time to leave, two people from our group decided to have two shots (hello, they got married that day! Why not? :) ) 

This was when the ""fun"" begun.

The bartender told them ""I don't serve you anymore. Get out of here."" Our friends were like ""Excuse me? Why?""

The next thing he did was that he asked the security guy to walk them out. Our friends asked again ""Why?"" since no one had said anything or done anything that would have been consider hurtful or out of order. 

The security guy had a HUGE ATTITUDE problem and after few rants he PHYSICALLY grab  one of the girls (waist) and tried to push her out. When her boyfriend was trying to tell him that he is not allowed to touch anyone (especially since she didn't even said anything, just stood there not understanding what's going on) the security guy said; ""I CAN DO WHAT EVER I WANT TO IN MY BAR.""

When another person from our group went to the guy asking what is going on he said to her that ""oh bitch, you are with them too? Get the fuck outta here! You are not welcome.""

Okay dude calm down. 

I feel bad for Park on Fremont that I have to write on Yelp a review since when I tried to complain thru phone the management (or how do I know if it was management after all, I wouldn't be surprise that it was the same guy who was working on the bar that night ha!) wasn't heard at all.

Where Park misses the mark for me has been a consistent disappoint in food and service. It lacks the wow factor and the staff often at times seems less than excited to wait on you. Guess what people! We're not all tourists and some of us are looking for favorite places to hang out. Ignoring your customer or acting like it's an imposition that we would want - gasp FOOD for lunch - is not going to turn Park into our Cheers.

I'm a bit impartial on this place but with so many options in the downtown area, I think having a friendly warmer environment with better food would definitely change my 3 star to a 5.",uU5xH0JEqlhOxJ9srnbOVg,1,0,3,mGTptNCQ8GHH3g7fMfSzJw

I loved the vibe right off the bat, especially when my girlfriends and I were led to the back garden. It was so refreshing to see trees that were not cactus, as if you really were in a ""park on Fremont""! 

Our server Liza was very friendly and it was with her that I finally fulfilled a childhood dream when I ordered a cocktail and said, ""I will have the Unicorn, please,"" ""the Unicorn"" being a ginger beer & vodka cocktail - pretty much two of my favorite beverages in a glass. Liza was attentive and on top of the ball the whole night, so props to her! We were three of those girls boys hate to take out and all ordered salad - two of us got strawberry balsamic salads and the other ordered the steak salad. The greens were crisp - not limp at all, while the bleu cheese crumbles were not too overpowering, the portions of chicken were generous, the candied walnuts were crunchy, and the strawberries gave it just the right amount of a sweet kick. 

The food hadn't even hit the table when we noticed a sewage stench near our seats against the wall that separates Park (is it okay if I just call you that?) with Radio City Pizza. We tried to do our best and give Park the benefit of the doubt, knowing that this is probably out of the restaurant's control, but then it also became noticeable that the music was TOO loud. I was in the middle of yelling about the onset of my quarter-life crisis to my friends when of course the Kings of Leon song in the back ended right as I was shouting, ""AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE!"" Great. I might as well have just megaphoned this news to the whole restaurant. 

Until the noise is controlled in the back (is it like that in the front too?) I probably won't think too much about grabbing a bite there, but otherwise this could be a great place to post up for a beverage - the generous pours into mason jars means I made the right decision to have skipped the Strip to imbibe more for less.",v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw,3,1,3,J4yZFZgc-weAWe9tE04C3A

Definitely more upscale than the usual with friendly staff, good food and unusual (and very delicious) cocktails. Drink prices are average to the other bars nearby, but the quality is much better.  If you're going to spend $8 for a cocktail on Freemont you'll get a better drink here than at the frozen drink stand down the road.

However, over time the garden filled up pretty quick but there was still only one server. It took quite some time for us to get our entrees (chicken tacos, steak tacos, double cheese burger, and avo-turkey sandwich). The tacos were ok, avo-turkey would have been better warmed up but the burger was awesome! Only real downfall was the 1 waitress who was running around like a crazy woman trying to make sure everyone was satisfied but we were neglected refills on our water and waited a significant amount of time for our check and then for it to be processed.

The majority of the seating in the restaurant is outside on their patios, so I had to wait about 45 minutes past my reservation to be seated. Other than that, my experience was great here! The servers were pleasant and attentive. If you're someone who rolls their eyes at ""hipster restaurants"" then this probably isn't your scene. It's hipster paradise, but that's my kind of place.

The brunch OJ and bottle of champagne is a steal at $20, so definitely get that if you're brunching. The fried mac and cheese balls were the highlight of the meal. You can't beat anything with that much cheese. For my entree, I got the breakfast Monte Cristo with bacon egg and cheese between French toast slices. I wasn't blown away by it - I prefer a traditional pancake batter Monte Cristo - but it was solid! We also tried the Chilaquiles, they're fairly spicy but also good!

Honestly my favorite part of Park on Fremont was the decor. Everything is well thought out and it's really quaint and low-key.

My Kellerwies made its way to me so no harm done. Drinks are served in mason jars. The selection is wide and varied. We got started with Mac & Cheese Balls ($7). 

The description hinted at bacon in the Mac & Cheese, however, there was no evidence of smokey, salty bacon. The balls were rolled in panko and fried crisp. They lacked any pizzazz. The garbage fries were recommended by our server we probably should have tried those. 

Sandwiches run $10-$12, we had the Cajun Chicken, BBQ Burger and Philly Mac & Cheese. All were edible, but none really shined.

One drink between the two of us because the bartender never came back to ask if I wanted something to drink.

This time eating I tried the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Sadly the chicken was dry and I only had a lonely strip of bacon. Honestly tasted a lot better separated than it did as a sandwich. 

My friends ordered the fried egg burger, and typically the egg is over easy when it comes to these burgers. But in their case the egg was fully cooked, I'm not sure if that's something you have to clarify or not. 

The bottomless mimosas were awesome, our server kept them coming without us having to ask for more. The drinks at Park are very good I must say. Nothing to complain about as for drinks.

On my most recent visit, which was last night, we were pub crawling on Repeal Day, the end of prohibition. There were five of us and we saddled up to the bar where we all ordered cocktails and bar food. The atmosphere is quite alright with a mix of locals and tourists. 

We ordered the fried pickles, which we shared and the $2 Tacos on Taco Tuesday special. The tacos were good for $2 tacos on Fremont street in a trendy bar. There are two choices of beef or chicken, we ordered one of each for three people.  Like I said, it was bar food nothing extravagant!

The breakfasts are very good actually. Breakfast places in Vegas are kind of weird for locals and I am sure weirder for tourists. There are wonderful places off the Strip or away from downtown Vegas but if you happen to be in the downtown area you may want to check out Park on Freemont. It is not inside a casino so you do not have to go through anxiety just to find it and then settle on a buffet. It is pretty much on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. If the weather is good there is outside seating in the front and back. The breakfasts are creative and fun, see my photos. All was yummy and to be able to sit back and chill in the morning is a pretty sweet deal from the casino or chain restaurant alternative.

There were 4 of us including one teenager. After we sat on the outside patio, a young waitress came to us and seemed appalled. ""Did the hostess seat you?""  ""No, we seated ourself per the sign"". She continued that they don't allow children after 6 pm (20 minutes from our entry time) even though we never saw any posting of the sort or could even figure out why they wouldn't let kids in to eat there, even after 6. We ordered after we convinced the waitress that we would be quick because of a later commitment. Dinner was, fine, nothing special. Fresh but didn't blow me away. At about 6:15 as the waitress brought the check, she tells me, ""I spoke to the manager, and it's ok.""  OK? Ok for what? We were done. Was she angling for a bigger tip because she ""allowed"" us to skirt this ridiculous, non posted, possibly made up policy? There are a lot of cool little places popping up downtown. Based on other reviews I've read here on Yelp for Park On Fremont, I think that some customer service techniques should be shared with the staff, if anyone there has the skills or cares to share them. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know or any customer that I may have in my limousine when asked for places to eat downtown.

Upon my last visit, I had the Cuban sandwich and fried pickles. The pickles were decent. The Cuban was dry and tasteless. What makes this even sadder is that it is difficult to screw up a Cuban sandwich. It is so basic and usually delicious.

1417220,2014-11-01,1,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"If I could give this establishment ZERO stars, I would. This was my third time dining at Park. It is Halloween night, everywhere is busy. My friends and I work at a casino on the strip and we decided we wanted to go have some food and something to drink to celebrate the holiday. We are locals and we can choose to go anywhere in this wonderful city, yet we chose Park. We ordered pretty much one of everything from the appetizer menu and we each had one cocktail. I would say total-we spent cumulatively around $150. The time was about 2:20am when we wrapped up, finished paying, and said our goodbyes at the entrance. I had to use the restroom and so did my roommate, so after hugging our friends goodbye I tried to walk back through the front entrance to use their restroom but I was abruptly stopped by the bouncer-Louie-or at least that was the name he gave us. He informed me that I could not go back inside because they were closing (they close at 3am and it is now 2:25am). At first I thought he was joking, so I smiled at him and continued to take a step forward. He placed his complete body in front of me and screamed in my face ""DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? WE ARE CLOSING"" I am naturally a pretty calm person so I said, ""well, we just had dinner here. Are you going to tell me that a paying customer may not use your restroom facilities?"" He then waved his arms in the air and continued to scream like a maniac toward everyone out front of the establishment ""OH, YEAH, FINE!! EVERYONE COME ON IN!! WE DON'T WANT TO GO HOME"" The manager was standing right there next to him and she did absolutely nothing. Since when is it okay to treat people like this? I literally just ate dinner here and you are not going to let me go pee? While he was having his conniption fit, I walked passed him and headed to the back of the restaurant-which was full of people by the way-and went to the restroom. I turned to see my roommate behind me. Good. So, we went to the bathroom and when we got out I noticed a part of the Park that I had never seen before. As I mentioned earlier, this was my third (and last!) time coming here, however I had never used the restroom and therefore never saw this garden back porch they have. My roommate, having been there more frequently than I, told me about a ""see-saw"" room as well. We started to walk through the crowd of people in the back of the restaurant to see this ""see-saw"" room. When we got back there, it was just that. An adult sized see-saw. How fun right? So, I jump on one side and she is on the other and we teetered and tottered a few times and I had almost completely forgotten how rude the security up front was. We then asked another patron to take our photo. Just as he was about to take it the manager (a lady) came back and said to my roommate and I ""you two that were (and she used air quotes) just using the bathroom-you have to leave NOW!"" And I said, ""okay we are about to leave, we just want to take a picture"". And she screamed at us as if we were her four year old children, ""YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOOOOW!!!!"" And again, I said, ""we will leave after we take the picture"". So she threatened me saying she would call security and I said as calm as ever, ""please do"". I really just wanted her to walk away so we could take the damn picture. She then threatened us by saying she was going to call Metro. All of this harassment from the manager was in a matter of 1-3 minutes. It was still not 3am, which is their ""closing time"". As we got off the see-saw, Louie was there again staring at us with eyes like daggers. I'm sure the upper management would be thrilled to know how the employees at Park treat paying customers. I've never been so appalled in my life. From the security out front not allowing paying customers to use their restroom facilities and then yelling about how he wants to go home, meanwhile the manager is just standing there allowing that type of behavior. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over a decade and no matter how annoying or rude or wrong a customer is, I have never-ever treated another human being that way. Where is your work ethic Park? Why do you treat paying customers like you are doing them a favor by letting them come inside? Park has the most unfriendly and rude staff I have ever encountered. I have never written a Yelp review before but this experience was so appalling that I felt compelled to. People should not treat other people this way! Especially managers!

1433781,2015-05-22,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"My boyfriend and I decided that last Sunday afternoon we would venture downtown to get brunch at Park on Fremont. We were met with some of the worst service I have ever experienced as a guest at any establishment.

We were seated outside on their patio just before noon. Our table was slightly sunny, which wasn't a problem for me in the beginning. Our server, Andrea, came over and we ordered a ""patio pounder"" which is an entire bottle of champagne and a craft of OJ for $20, my boyfriend also ordered a coffee. I was stoked.
After a very short time the sun had moved, and left our table in direct sunlight. The both of us started to get very hot and uncomfortable. When our server came over to us again to drop off our drinks we explained our discomfort and asked to be moved to a shady table that had just opened up. She said ""yes, of course"" and happily moved us to the more comfortable table, and took our food orders.
Not five minutes later the host came up, and plainly said ""you can't stay here, this table is being saved"" and when we expressed that we had just become too hot at our original one all she said in reply was ""oh"" and walked away. 
The attitude we received was unnecessary. We had not moved tables on our own, we asked our server, who had no problem moving us. All we wanted was to sit at a table where we could comfortably enjoy our brunch. I do not think it was an outrageous request. 

After (embarrassingly) moving back to our original sunny table, we received our food. I ordered French toast and my boyfriend got the breakfast skillet. Our food was GREAT. Let me repeat that: OUR FOOD WAS GREAT. This may have been some of the best French Toast I have ever had.
But after we received our food our server Andrea was nowhere to be found.
Throughout the rest of our meal she came to our table only twice. Once right after we received our food (obviously due to the ""two bite rule"") and once more, in passing, to ask if my boyfriend needed more coffee, after we were almost finished with our meal. She did not even drop off our check herself.
I would not have been so upset by this if I hadn't heard her chatting excitedly with the table next to us. We can only assume that her terrible attitude was due to her assuming she would not receive a tip from us after we were told (not asked... told) to move tables.

I do not know what exactly the staff here at Park on Fremont think customer service is. But it is definitely NOT treating your guests like they are an inconvenience or not worth your time and attention.

I will not be returning to Park on Fremont until I hear that the staff has had a makeover. The food was amazing, but not good enough to make me want to have a horrible experience like that ever again.",5CdrbmxlmDJ9XC4lLlJRzw,4,0,2,HRjAk2meGc3srpRVxJ3m5A

Hubby ordered the veggie sliders and sweet potato tots. Yum! The pickles on them...ugh I could eat a million. Nothing dry about these burgers. Moist and tasteful. They came with a side of some kind of homemade honey mustard. Tots were too sweet for me but they were yum.

I ordered the veggie pita wrap. Nothing wrap about it. It's a soft, warm stuffed pita. Inside it had eggplant, yellow squash, a tiny bit of smooth spread feta, lettuce and tomato. It comes with crispy hand it fries. Crispy! Ugh I love crispy fries! I don't like catsup but I decided to try it anyway...HELLO?!? It has siracha in it!!!!! Yum I'm sold and will never be the same!

Drinks: We ordered two of their moscow mules: the twig& berries and the Tennesse Stud.  I felt both were pretty good .

Food: Definitely ORDER the garbage fries over tots! SOOO delicious . It's a wonderful mix of EGG, jalapenos, cheese, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and perfectly crispy tots. My boyfriend and I finished off every last bite of this dish.

Old School Park Sandwich was just okay .  It's supposed to be brisket and pastrami but I felt like all I could taste was pastrami.  The bread was also very chewy.  However, it came with a choice of fries, tots, or a side salad and we opted for sweet potato tots (pretty original!) and that was tasty.

The steak and pepper mix was excellent (but paltry) and the macaroni passable, but the 4 to 1 bread to everything else ratio ruined this. After all this, our ""appetizer"" arrived (LOL).

Having just eaten at Le Thai, we stopped in for some cocktails and the hostess told us to seat ourselves in the outdoor area to the side of the building.  OK, not a particularly enchanting environment, but it was a beautiful day.  I propelled myself into a optimistic urban renewal mindset and the cocktail and beer menus looked encouraging, though I was a tad miffed that the beer menu was vague in description and had no prices.  Even after pondering those menus for over 15 minutes, many of the items still appeared like something we might want to sample if only someone would come by to take our order.  Where's Godot?  Apparently not on that side of Park on Fremont.

So there we are, dying on the vine, but still with enough hope and vitality to get up and walk inside and then back out to the garden in the back rather than just walk out (which was an option we tossed around) and then tad-dah....a little quixotic haven came into sight .

The ambiance: think Alice in Wonderland on acid with her own show on HGTV.  Flowers, statues,  vintage plates, metal furniture, picture of horses copulating, freakish wallpaper; totally awesome!

The service:  thank you Andera for listening to us bemoan our previous shunning, for finding out the answers to all our questions, and for turning the whole service experience around to make it that awesome as well!

I love Park! It's another one of the finds in Vegas that gives me a feeling of being back at home in Columbus (OH)!

The Hipster that doesn't quite commit to riding bicycles EVERYWHERE and sometimes grabs an Uber. 

Park is pretty small inside, so plan to venture outdoors as there is plenty of outdoor seating. But if you sit inside, avoid that back booth, unless you've got really small thighs. I mean REALLY small thighs. My friends and I once sat in that back booth and we had a hard time getting in/out. The bar is pretty cool though and the bartenders all seem pretty cool as well. 

My favorite thing about Park, aside from the chicken and waffle sandwich, is the secret garden in the back... so be sure to explore your surroundings! 

I've ordered a cheeseburger and fries, chicken and waffle sandwich and wings and fries. Park has some of the best French fries! They're always the right amount of crisp. The cheeseburger was pretty standard, but the wings I had ordered really surprised me. The Chipotle BBQ sauce that they used is really good! Not too much of a kick but just enough to leave you wanting more. 

My absolute FAVORITE dish there though is the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. It's pretty big so bring your appetite if you're going to be ordering this dish. There is a fried chicken breast nestled between two waffles and some bacon. The chicken is the perfect amount of crispy and juicy. You also get syrup which makes the waffle easier to bite into. You have your choice of a side, I've (so far) gotten it with a salad and sweet potato tots. Go with the tots, they're pretty darn good as well! 

Park has an awesome (brunch) drink special - $20 for a bottle of champagne and enough orange juice to make quite a few mimosas out of. So if you're looking for a downtown brunch spot to drink, go to Park!",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,2,2,4,BrGQOsNssp1eBMhpPRjjKg

After making reservations for dinner and going there it  became clear that Park on Fremont is actually a bar that serves a small variety of burgers, sandwiches, and appetizers that could be considered higher-end bar food. 

Mac & Cheese Balls were all mac and no cheese, unless the little plastic tub of cheesy-flavored dip served with them was supposed to be the cheese, and had a distinct artificial bacon flavor. Being only macaroni noodles in the fried balls, they were dry and bland and overall were a disappointment. 

Chicken Bar Bites with their Honey Mustard sauce were plump and delicious and were served with excellent sweet potato tots. These were a winner. 

After these two appetizers and a couple of small mason jars of Guinness at $8.00 each and house cocktails at $10.00 each we bailed and headed out for dinner somewhere else.

Weird story on Park on Fremont, I have meant to get here the last two times I was in Las Vegas and it just wasn't in the cards. Once I arrived later and they had closed their kitchen early (it was a weeknight and slow) and the other time we literally got to the door and friends sent a text and we had to leave to meet them. Third time was a charm though, and we spent some time on a sunny Friday afternoon here enjoying drinks and a nibble...

This place came on my radar when another friend who also loves Vegas raved that I ""had to try"" their Garbage Fries. It's been on my list for over two years now, and it exceeded expectations.

We had our Garbage Fries as tots... and they were game changing. The best ""fries"" I think I have ever had. Melted cheddar. Melted provolone. Bacon. Fresh cut Jalapenos. Fresh Tomatoes. Avacado. Chipoltle Ranch. A sunny side up Fried Egg. All piled on and large serving of perfectly fried tater tots. We were in heaven, and actually full after sharing one plate of these as an afternoon snack.

They had some great beers on tap (which I enjoyed a couple of pints of... Kronenbourg 1664 and a Ballast Point Scullpin) and Heather loved her  ""Bucking Mules"".. Moscow Mules. We sat in the sun on the patio facing Fremont Street, enjoying the fact we weren't back home in the never ending -20 degree Celsius weather.   

The next time we visit (and there will most definitely be a visit next time were in Vegas) we want to sit on the beautiful back patio area, or inside where the artwork is so damn cool and interesting.

It was basically an uncooked corn tortilla with beans and avocado. Not really what huevos rancheros are, or what we were expecting from the description. Our other issue was that our waitress never asked if we wanted the bill split and when we asked if we could do it she said it could only be split 3 ways (there were 8 of us) and that we needed to mark the receipt how we wanted it split.

The rating for this place was good and I love me a good gastropub. It was PACKED which is a good sign. It has a hipster vibe and many people kept trying to get in. The whole street was poppin'. They played good music. The inside looked classy and the back patio was cozy in an enchanted garden kind of way. Getting seated was lame. The hostess seemed so bored and bland. She had no personality. We were lucky enough to spot and steal a table for 2 on the patio facing the street *slick* :)  The rest of the service was fantastic by everyone else we encountered. I don't know the waitress' name, but she was Asian and was an excellent server!!

The classic cheeseburger was thick, soft, juicy, and full of flavor! It fell part which was a bummer and it was a little too pink in the center for my liking (it was even too dark for me to tell for sure HOW pink it was) but it tasted AMAZING. The french fries were freshly cut and tasty. My boyfriend got the Mac and CheeseSteak. He said it was good.  But the best part were the sweet potato teeter tots! OMG! Heaven in my mouth!! We'd never had anything like it. They were so soft and creamy yet crispy. It's hard to explain but it's a must try!! Also to die for is the Unicorn cocktail.

With about ~20 attendees I made sure to make reservations weeks in advance. Things started off smoothly initially, the waitress was adequate. For a party that big, and considering the place wasn't swamped or anything (it was on a Thursday night), she did the bare minimum. Considering that she knew she was getting auto grat she felt no need to hussle. Also, why did they not designate a back up server for a party of that size? People were without drinks or drink refills for a long time. The food was overpriced and average at best. It took FOREVER to get the plates cleared and out of the way. When she realized she probably had already earned her 18% auto grat or whatever it was on a party that large, she pretty much jumped ship. You had to physically track her down, or wait a very very long time for her to come back around.

1729767,2014-01-02,1,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"Actually 3.5 Stars--

We came the morning of New Years Day. The restaurant seemed full, but not packed. We were quickly seated at the back patio, but from there it was a long wait. As you can imagine, we were a tad hungover from NYE partying the night before (this IS Vegas, after all), and to have to wait probably 10-20 minutes before even getting water is terrible. We were actually served our bloody marys and Dirty Girl Scout ($8.00) before our water, which on any other morning might be acceptable.

Service was SLOW, but apologetic. Our waitress actually said she'd never seen the restaurant this busy before... but there wasn't a wait at the door, there didn't appear to be any large parties.. they were simply under staffed, which on a New Years morning is either bad management, or 1/2 their crew didn't show up for work.

Now, the food: WOW, very nicely done! The bloody marys (Texas Tuxedo $10.00) were GREAT, actually, served in a large mason jar with cucumbers and large basil leaves, spicy, no salt on the rim (not needed). So right away I was feeling relief from the wait and my headache, and starving stomach...

We got the fried Mac n Cheese balls ($7.00) for an appetizer. The were nice and hot, although we didn't cheese-burn the roof of our mouths, which is amazing. Crispy fresh batter, very thick cheese inside, with a size of cheese for dipping. 5 cheese balls total, each a bit larger than a golf ball, smaller than a tennis ball...

Then the food: I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich ($11.00), with eggs, bacon and cheese on bread. Simple enough, this was delicious! The eggs over easy actually seemed like the BEST eggs over easy I've ever experienced... maybe I was just that hungover/ starving, but I don't think I've ever tasted a better egg. The bread was almost like French Toast, fluffy, lightly toasted, soaking up the grease. The sandwich was very greasy, but I devoured it quickly and happily.

Friends ordered the Breakfast Waffle ($10.00) and the BBQ Texas Burger ($10.00).  Prices all around are a bit steep, but the quality of the food really shows with each bite. If only service were faster! But as I said, they were very apologetic and doing their best to reach everyone and serve a fantastic meal. A paid parking lot is around the corner. Patio seating in front and back of the restaurant, a small bar and dining area inside. 

***Another note: the ambiance is great. Outdoor seating with christmas lights in the trees, very good, hip art on the walls. Perfect for millennial hipsters (meaning to be only slightly patronizing! *** Really though, kudos to the scene!",yOTpoabJWyYCJMwV_vCTCQ,3,3,4,rc4IuHyw_09u8X711mLPCw

The menu is standard bar room munchies; fried everything with enough transfat to kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The sort of list items any man can appreciate.

It's different: an homey restaurant with artsy decor and reasonably priced, albeit good tasting, food and drinks. The great cocktail menu is solid and there a slew of beers on tap and in bottle.

The guy checking IDs at the door was a little strange. He forcefully asked to check my luggage before I walked in. Terror threat at Fremont? I guess so.

Best approach: Get overwhelmed on Fremont Street, drop in for dinner and sit in the backyard. Order a few cocktails, admire the wild wallpaper after using the bathroom, and enjoy a few small plates in courtyard peace.",uTDxT-lAVI31gBg9Fgz8hQ,0,0,4,4r-l0vyDb3h3FRNv31FXcw

That being said, the patio out back is a gorgeous garden in the middle of downtown LV- totally unexpected, and pleasantly so. I highly prefer it over the front patio, which is chock-full of exhaust fumes.

I've mostly stuck to appetizers and drinks here- the Trophy Wife is my drink of choice while here, and the wings are old-school style but nothing really blew me away. As others have said, the mac and cheese philly is good in theory but not executed well.

Staff seem to be MIA most of my visits, which is fine up until a certain point- I like to be able to converse without servers pestering me or making me feel obligated to order a new drink every time mine dips below half-full, but it would be nice if they seemed to care about their patrons.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,8,3,Eh7rzGo0aFmwQT3bGjhzTQ

This place is only good for grabbing drinks at the bar to pregame before you go elsewhere.

I have come for brunch twice and ordered food once after First Friday.  I have also been in to grab drinks from the bar on several occasions.

The first time we came for brunch our server was awful. First we sat at our table for about 20 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Finally our server comes over and it doesn't get any better.  It seemed like it was her first day serving EVER since she couldn't give a single recommendation on what to order and even messed up several of our orders.  We were a party of 6 and it took 30 minutes to get drinks.  Finally our food came out and the portions were quite small. Good luck on splitting checks here even if you tell the server you want separate checks in the beginning.  I know that servers hate that but Vegas is a tourist town and any restaurant should expect groups to come in and want to pay separate.  It took her about 45 minutes to split everything and finally bring us our checks.

I decided to give their brunch another try and came back with a party of 4 about 6 months later.  Same thing. We sat for about 20 minutes before our server came over.  She seemed rushed and had zero personality.  The food came out and the portions did not get any bigger.  Drinks took forever and so did our food.  We paid with 2 credit cards and just split it so it was a little easier on the server.  Both meals I was never thanked for coming in by the server or any staff member. 

If you come in the summer months put on plenty of sunblock as there is little to no shade protecting you while you sit outside. I saw a lot of customers dripping in sweat.

We stopped in after first Friday and sat in a booth inside to get drinks and some food.  Again server was aloof and seemed hurried.  After seeing this on 3 separate occasions I would tell management to hire more staff or servers who are more experienced and don't seem so frazzled.

All that aside this bar is hip and fun and also has a secret seesaw in the back of the bar.  My advice: come in have a drink with friends and jump on the seesaw for kicks then head to the next bar.  If you want to grab a quick bite don't expect to be out in under an hour.

The fried pickles are good as well as the chicken and waffle sandwich. Overall there are much nicer brunch spots in Vegas that have better service, bigger portions, and tastier food.",UgygXfSXt-siIXQUlq550A,4,1,2,K6PdfvZJHkk4sC9-BaEA_g

They have a somewhat limited breakfast menu, but interesting toast flavors and combinations. Service was slow, albeit there were only 3 seated tables including us and a half full bar. We had two servers, actually one, but he never checked on us, so we had to keep raising our hand to the back bar for attention, service and another server for water or drinks or to correct our order. I got the buratta toast with fig jam and almonds - delicious. Hubs got the turkey sausage sandwich, scrambled eggs instead of the over. After, I swear, 15 minutes he brings a bacon breakfast sandwich - wrong order. So I notice they don't write any of the orders down....he doesn't even check the order before setting down the wrong dish...so 10 minutes go by, trying to wave down the server who's hanging at the bar and kitchen. Do another 15"" goes by to remake the wrong order - hey note to Park on Fremont....have your serves write down orders, maybe they'll get them right. So it takes 15 minutes to request and get the check, the few parties at the bar told us to dine and dash...they were serious, as they too were waiting a long time for service and the bill.

When it comes down to it the food is overpriced for the portion sizes and there's little to nothing special about it that hasnt been done before...at a third the price....for double the size. 

Presentation is second to none as well. If you're ordering a burger, or in my case the chicken wrap, what you'll get is your wrap on a tray with side of choice and the smallest disposable ramekin of i guess honey mustard. 

The drink menu could use some revision...pricing for one. A wipe down with some disinfectant spray for others.

Yeah not impressed. With all the other options on fremont street offering the same drinks for a fraction of the price...unlike you find everything pleasing i wouldnt recommend.

1949939,2015-03-23,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"My boyfriend and I visited downtown LV this past weekend to take advantage of the good weather and the fact that I was not stuck at work for once during the day!! After being super indecisive over where we wanted to have our late lunch, I realized I've had Park on Fremont bookmarked since I've never gone before, and so that was our final choice. Once you reach the entrance, they greeted us and asked if we preferred inside or outside, and because it was so nice outside, we choice out. The host led us to the seating area right outside where we had the entrance of the Fremont Experience right in front of us. I was a bit disappointed and upset because when I had looked at their yelp photos prior to coming in, I saw the beautiful outdoor seating in their garden. It was then that I realized they had two outdoor seating areas. (If I had known the patio she led us to was not connected to the garden, I would have requested to be seated in the backyard garden). Nonetheless, it was still nice and cute. 

Food/drinks: So our waitress came and asked us what drinks we would like to start off with. Again, after looking through their yelp reviews and photos, I found that they served Banana Bread Beer and it was super popular (and because I LOVE banana bread, I was curious to how it would taste hehe). Sadly, when I requested for that drink, she said they were all sold out. I didnt prepare myself for a back up but she immediately recommended for me to try their organic strawberry beer, so I agreed. My boyfriend was okay with his first choice, and was happy. Yet, after giving my drink a try, the waitress asked me how I liked it....because she NEVER tried it before... Well, I didn't really enjoy it toooo much. It was okay, tasted like beer filled with strawberry syrup.. Um, I only decided to go with that because she recommended it to me and I trusted her! All along, she's never even tried it!! hahaha, if i knew, I probably would have picked something else on my own that I knew I would like. Oh well, at least I guess I now know how organic strawberry beer tastes like.. lol. Okay, moving on to the food. Since I was trying to go for something a bit light, I ordered the garden burger with sweet potato tots. The burger was a bit bland, but the sweet potato tots came with sweet honey mustard and omg I was addicted to that! hahaha. My boyfriend order the chicken and waffle sandwich with sweet potato tots as well. There wasn't anything really special about his sandwich, I wish the waffle was a bit more crispy. 

All in all, Park on fremont is super cute and I love that! The food is just okay, BUT they have a wide selection of drinks to choose from (it just sucks when they run out, wahh!).

First off Fremont street is great already, so much more intimate and less walking than the strip. This was basically in the heart of it. 

I made reservations earlier in the day for a group of about 7. When we got there my mother in law was having a tricky time with the high top table but they were so sweet to move us to a lower table really quickly. Luckily it wasn't too busy at the time. 

I had a warm coffee cocktail (Girl Scout something) sweet, probably better for dessert but so delicious! I was between two sandwiches and our server recommended the freebird (I think was the name) and it was to die for! My mouth waters just thinking about it! Everyone else loved their food as well.

The presentation of food again is great the taste was okay nothing special about it but wasn't bad either. Drinks... I ordered a bloody Mary and this is where my major problem is, I read menu and I got the bloody Mary that was most expensive mainly because of the description it said fresh mix of tomatoes served with a pickled egg and a extra crispy bacon strip.... not what I got and this disappointed me. Mix is fresh as described and actually very tasty, egg was not pickled it was just a plain boiled egg not what menu said, bacon was cold and not cooked very well nothing crispy about it again made me disappointed. Service it was okay could use to pay a bit more attention to their customers and know more about what they are serving the bartender she lacked at know about the drinks they serve and their specialty beers.

The second time I went there I went around 12:30pm and asked to sit on the back patio. That was a mistake because the sun was blazing hot and there were no umbrellas, fans, or misters. It's not even summer yet and the outside will miserably fail if something isn't done to change that. So everyone was moving tables and switching spots to avoid the sun. 

Which brings me to another problem that Park probably won't be able to fix as easily ... The patio side is up against an alley, where all the trash from surrounding bars is dumped. In the sun, the smell was so horrible I felt like I was going to throw up, I don't know how they're going to fix that issue. But you can't expect to serve food to people when they're smelling rotting trash. Revolting. 

Then, we ordered the Mac n cheese Philly and the bar chicken bites... But it took 55 minutes for the food to come out at 45 minutes for anyone to realize there was an issue with our order. A manager never stopped by to apologize and at the end of the meal they removed one item from our bill. 

I've worked in the hospitality industry for over ten years. I know it's not all the waitresses fault, however managers need to be more aware of what's going on in their restaurant. (I saw them dealing with contractors so I'm assuming they were preoccupied) ..regardless, get ON your kitchen and get the food out! The servers need to be aware of their surroundings, one girl passed us literally ten times and after we had already been waiting for food for 30+ minutes she asked if anyone has taken our order yet. 

I want this place to do well so badly and I'm hoping this review can be used to fix these problems for the future.

Then they have a great selection of unusual beers. I had the Francknerwizzunsumpthing Heff-- I actually dont remember what its name was but I had two of them and these were among the best beers I had during the entire stay in Vegas.

This place is a diamond nestled in the eclectic mix of businesses in down town Vegas. Easy to miss unless you're looking for it. It's across from heart attack grill. Food is awesome and VERY reasonable compared to other restaurants in Vegas. The staff though, are the best part. Super friendly and helpful. Every one went out of their way from my initial phone call to the moment we left. Felt like a true locals hangout which is nice with so much of downtown working so hard to reclaim it's identity as iconic AND fresh/upcoming. Cheers guys, thank you for an outstanding meal.

If it's brunch time, I usually order a pitcher of the ""Walk in the Park""-- wine and vodka with fresh fruit and elderflower, super yummy. 

Food wise, lots of good choices- the strawberry summer salad, chicken bar bites (corn-flake breaded chicken), the street tacos, fried pickles, garbage fries, you really can't go wrong with the food. 

The decor is super fun, and make sure to check out the teeter-totter situated behind the back patio, where smokers go to escape and diners go to let loose. 

Note for those looking for parking, I usually park at Neonopolis, it's usually 2-3$, and its in a parking garage which is across the street from Park.

One person in our group suggested we go in here for a few post- dinner drinks, and I'm so glad we did.
We sat at the outside bar section, which was really nice, it was a cool night and a little bit less hectic outside than inside. I'm all for fresh air so whenever I have a chance to partake in food or beverage and mix it with fresh air I'm a big fan! 
I had a few vodka waters, the bartender made them quite delicious! I know it sounds simple but this is a drink that can easily be made poorly, either with too much vodka or too much water. These were perfect, mixed with that fresh air and good company... I truly had a great time at this place! 
Then, the icing on the cake is that there is a teeter totter around back!! It's in a really small area, but I sure am glad they fit in this awesome little piece of playground equipment. Just make sure you don't have too many drinks when you partake in this fun LOL. Playing on the teeter totter was great! I was laughing my butt off while getting to play on this piece of equipment that reminded me of my childhood, except now it was an adult version with drinks!

The garbage fries had pretty much anything you could think of putting on French fries only it didn't taste like garbage ;) the jalapeños and the fried egg on the fries were absolutely to die for and had it not been for park on Fremont offering this dish I would have never thought to add these toppings to cheese fries. The chicken bar bites were so flavorful and the interesting thing about this restaurant is they don't use traditional breading on most items they actually use a corn flake ""breading"" which adds an interesting flavor profile to the dishes. I must close this review by commenting on the drinks.

2257833,2014-11-19,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"I have been to Park several times, and my experience is always similar. First the good stuff. I've never had a bad meal here, and the cocktails are delicious. My favorite cocktail is the Pillow Talk, which is a light and refreshing vodka drink. The food ranges from classic bar food to yummy salads, so no matter what kind of mood you're in, they have something for your tastes. The ambiance is very cool. This place was definitely designed by hipsters--it's quirky and fun. I'm also a huge sucker for a nice, outdoor space, and Park's patio is adorable, although it is very close to a sewer, so you will frequently get whiffs of an unpleasant smell. 

Ok, now the reason for only two stars. Despite the food, cocktails, and decor, the service is abysmal. I never go here if I need to be quick because I know that unless I'm the only party in the restaurant, I'm not getting out of here in under an hour. The servers are dismissive and nonresponsive, and I still would've given it three stars, but the last time I was there the service was so bad that it's brought me to Yelp. 

We had a large group, and the first thing that happens when we are seated is our server spills an entire glass of ice water down the back of a member of our party. Instead of apologizing he throws a towel at her and runs away. He never returns to clean up. My friend goes to the bathroom to dry off, and I went to speak with the manager because I just didn't like the way it was handled (no apology, not cleaning up the spill, just handing her a towel and disappearing). The bartenders even told me the waiter ran away and was hiding over it. This should NOT have been this big of a deal. 

So I spoke with the manager, and everything was fine, and she came over to our table when my friend returned and offered to comp my friend's meal and the party's first round of drinks. She also had a conversation with my friend separately where she stated this. However, when the bill came, she decided what was ""fair"" would be to only comp my friend's meal ""because she was the only one that had water spilled on her."" She then claimed she never told us she would comp a round of drinks for the table despite 5 of us hearing her say it. Additionally, despite the immediate error, the service did not improve. We never saw our waiter after he brought our food.

Again, none of this would have been this big of a deal had he just apologized and helped clean up, if the manager had not stated she would comp drinks for us and then change her mind, and if we had just gotten some acknowledgment during our meal.

We were fully satisfied with how delicious the food was! We even tried eggplant lettuce wraps which were $11 and not on HH. We're very lax with certain errors on food, for example... we asked for no jalapeños on our HH fries. Of course, the fries came out with a bunch of jalapeños. It was fine, we scooped em out. The second order was correct. The next issue was with my mule that lacked the bitters flavor that it advertised. I asked for some extra bitters to be added into my mule and it was no prob. What I am marking off for, is the selection and prices of drinks. They're a trendier bar/lounge/resto... if think or assume that they would offer at least a few of their cocktails to be priced for HH. But they weren't, boo hoo. Prices started at $9 a pop, but it didn't stop us girls from at least ordering 2 cocktails each.

I assumed the server would of asked me which sauce I wanted, and since she didn't I figured all sauces would come on the side. When I asked the food runner AND the server why it came out smothered in buffalo sauce,  they BOTH said ""that's just how it comes"". Now how am I supposed to know that since she didn't tell me?

Think that Park on Fremont literally empty parking lot before this transformation too cool little pub in the ever growing downtown scene. One that more more little cool bars and restaurants really DIGGING the vibe. I think Park on Fremont is another solid addition. 

I came with fellow yelpers Mel C, Terri R, Alicia R, Toni R, and Merrick. One thing hopefully they do is get some kind of signage on the exterior because if not for yelp (looked at all of yelpers helpful pics) walked right pass it. It located right next too Radio City Pizza. Some in ways its different without sign and peeks one interest see what on the inside. We never sat on the inside but enjoyed the patio and the amazing weather that night. The patio not that big but just great spot not only for people watching, just kicking back with friends, and not too loud they do play music over the speakers. (in general hear music coming from other bars or even freemont street experience) Still can carry conversations with friends without shouting too one another. They even have beer garden but never venture check it out next tip will. The menu comes too the food not that big but they do offer quite few different beers for such small bar. Although seems that night for some of our party it more like okay out of that too. 

It was only the second night they open too the public so hiccups or just working things out are too be expected. I am not going too be harsh comes too the service. Just felt it was good service even with some hiccups they did great job of taking care of us. Park on Fremont really nice compare too some of the other bars in downtown the bar offers food! It not that big (by the way no Grilled Cheese; it caught my attention for not) but few things is solid options. I decided too have the Hammer Chicken. It not what I expected but suppose in thought Hammer (pounded the chicken thin) not so much sandwich but light chicken salad. Good. The mixed organic greens with balsamic vinegar with blue cheese, toasted walnut or candied walnuts, combine with the chicken went perfect with my Dr Brown orange soda. Everyone else ordered something different but everything looked great. Fan of the wooden utensils and plates. It different goes with the whole flow of the restaurant. For me it does.

One more feature about the patio with the white picket fences goes around. Fan. It feels like out in midwest kicking back on front porch on great weather day. Hanging out with great company.

Even though the menu is short, it had many items to choose from.  I ordered one of their bloody marys (Texas Tuxedo) to start the night off along with some healthy dishes - chicken wrap & a strawberry salad.  Each of my friends ordered something different, that way we can try out more items on the menu to see what their BEST dish is.  Their steak salad was definitely more delicious than the strawberry salad.  The mac n' cheese philly cheese steak was very interesting.  Yes, very fattening and yummy!  One thing I would do differently (just because I'm really into texture) I would bake some Panko on top of the mac n' cheese to make it have a crununnnnccchhh :)  Their nachos was different.

Since he was busy ignoring us we figured we'd ask about the specials and decide what we wanted while we waited for him. We asked the bartender what beers were on special he said they all were. We asked twice, even. They, as well as some of the other bars had a special that included a beer and a shot for $6.00(I believe it was $6.00) Well neither of us are shot people so we just ordered the beer, he said $18.00. I said oh we only get the special if we order a shot? He took a beer away and gave us a bottle of beer and said $20! WTF!! Umm that still doesn't solve the problem. I spoke up and said you said all the beers were on special. He mumbled something but basically used the excuse that they were busy as to why he screwed up our service. I should have told him to shove it and go somewhere else but I didn't, I took the beer and the crappy shot and went on our way. Doubtful that I'll be returning.

This place is adorable. I love the decor! I love the patio! It's so pretty, cute, morbid, Frenchy all rolled into an awesome ball that works. Every time I come, I discover something new. My favorite areas to note are the hall of chandeliers, the beautiful tile hopscotch, Cinderella's carriage (I pretend it's hers) and the teeter-totter in the smoking section (somewhat hidden in the back). I love bringing out-of-town friends here and they all love it.

I've tried a few of their house specialty drinks, and really I have no complaints. The drinks are good. Although sometimes they taste as if they don't have much alcohol in them. They have this pear beer, which is super tasty. I'm not a big beer drinker, so those of you that are, pay no attention to my beer recommendation!! Haha.

And serving as somewhat of a gateway between these two vastly different parts of Downtown Las Vegas is Park on Fremont. The large draft craft beer selection and small bites of re-imaged pub fare screams hipster gastropub, but it's just as common to see a couple of ""regular folks"" wander over from the Fremont Experience to grab a NASCAR brew and a shot. And their extensive bottle selection goes from numerous west coast craft brews to bottles of Mickey's.  

My first trip to Park was in Vegas last year. I stopped here as a ""beer layover"" on my walk from Container Park back to my hotel at the GN. This was the first place where I tried the awesome Stiegl Grapefruit Radler on tap. I didn't eat, although I REALLY wanted to come back for the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak. It sounds like such an atrocity for a cheesesteak purist like myself, but it had my curiosity peaked.

I did make it back to Park during my most-recent trip, but it was late-night and I just didn't have the hunger for something that large. Thankfully they had late-night happy hour, and their awesome Garbage Fries for $5. Topped with cheese, bacon, avocado, chipoltes, jalapenos, tomatoes, green onions, and fried egg for good measure ... it may look like ""garbage"" but it tasted delicious. 

Park on Fremont is a place I want to continue coming back to each time I'm in Downtown LV. I've got to try the cheesesteak, and I still haven't checked out their patio yet. (Which looks awesome from the photos) It's worth the short venture off the ""Downtown Strip"".",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,2,1,4,NKgLhNBREBgqomZ3k7k1UA

After we were seated by the hostess  for about 5 minutes another person came and politely told us that the table had been reserved for a large party and that we could sit outside or squeeze in at the bar. 

I ordered Mac Balls and Fish Tacos at the bar.  A server came out fast with two plates including Garbage Fries. I let him know that it must have been someone else's order. That's when the fight started. The bartender told me ""you ordered Mac and Cheese Balls and Garbage Fries"". When I let him know what I truly ordered he replied with ""no.  You said ......""  He was visibly agitated. I stopped talking.  After some hemming and hawing the bartender said something like "" I guess I can put in a new order for Fish Tacos"". I asked him not to bother. 

I paid for the Mac and cheese and left. For good. The customer is not always right but this bartender won the argument and lost the customer. This restaurant must have all the business that they need to fire customers like this. Happy holidays.",aLfGrEl-zrGFpe-WPPiuQw,0,0,1,mLBgu5HxY4Jktv5UqWgG7w

2496915,2013-03-27,12,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"East Fremont has a great bar for beer and food!

Park on Fremont is now open.  They call themselves a gastropub...and I get it.  They have a great selection of beer (pub) and they do an elevated bar food-meets-comfort food...so yeah, they're a gastropub...just not what I would typically think of when I think gastropub.  Everything on the menu is tweaked or twisted in some way to be more than just your run-of -the mill bar menu.

Park on Fremont is the bar I always wanted to aesthetically design, but never knew  about.  Owned by the same group as the nearby Commonwealth, Park on Fremont is just plain cool on the inside.  Look around...stuffed birds behind the bar, a deer head with gold plated machine guns in its antlers, throwback trendy wallpaper, a beer garden that is way too cool for school!  Suffice it to say that you need to come down and check it out.  

There is not a lot of good food on East Fremont.  Park on Fremont is absolutely quality food!  I had the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak...yeah, a Philly Cheese steak with mac and cheese on top..I know why didn't you think of this before and make it?  Eat this.  I also tried the Chicken Bar Bites--Cornflake crusted pieces of real chicken with a trio of sauces...too large to be called nuggets...too small to be called fingers.  There were tasty.  I opted not to order the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  I heard it was a little on the small side, but it sounded so good. Cap'n Crunch fired chicken with applewood, smoked bacon waffles and vanilla maple syrup...I will be eating you in the future...promise!

...I almost forgot!...Sweet Potato Teeter Tots!...soo good! 

My only qualm...and maybe I'm just spit-balling here...all the beers come in mason jars...cool I know...but are they the normal 16oz pour you are expecting?...I'm not up to date on my mason jar volumes, but they felt more like 14oz and I thought I would be getting a standard American Pint.  Maybe I did, but without some actual measuring I'll never know.

Come here for good food while hopping the happening bars of East Fremont!
Come here for a great beer selection!
Come here for a beer garden that will make you swear you're not in Vegas!
Come here for a different take on bar food!
Come here for sippy, summer cocktails that will transport you poolside!
Come here just to find the secret smoking area of the patio!

They took off for Don't Tell Mama and reported back that they were served immediately. Jessica C. and I decided to suffer through the wait with our parched palates and carry on. It was a poor decision and we should have left with the other three. 

The bartenders were busy, Park was busy. That is a fact but not an excuse. If you can't execute under pressure you are in the wrong business.

1. We arrived to a practically empty side patio and dining room. Weird sign on a Friday night on Fremont East.
2. It was 630pm, and they had a door man in full blacks with a clicking counter and sleazy hairdo.
3. We waited several minutes to be carded, because this doorman was carding the foursome in front of us that we're all obviously of retirement age or greater.
4. Once we were carded, there was no recognition of being locals.. inconvenienced locals that live mere blocks away.
5. The ineffectual hostess sat in front of a sign reading ""Please seat yourself"" while the ineffectual doorman made confusing and unsolicited food suggestions (""You gotta try that thing with the... umm.. mac and cheese, yeah!"")
6. Once we had sat ourselves at the outside portion of bar, our unsmiling, but otherwise friendly, bartender came by to get our order.
7. He did apologize for being out of cherries for our cherry cokes. 
8. Food took 30+ minutes despite low guest count.
9. The ahi tuna ""salad"" was not a salad at all. It was 7 lovely and pretty perfectly seared slices of ahi, 3 slices of Hass avocado, 3 forkfuls of spring mix with a little too much dressing, and a drizzle of a sauce I couldn't put my finger on. Not bad at all, but should have been offered on the appetizer menu and not described as a salad.
10. Fiancee's Cajun chicken sandwich and fries were delicious. The roll was fresh, the fries were as good as ever, and the chicken cooked through but not dry. We will order this again.

We had a large group at a picnic table on the patio in the back, it has a charming feel to it. Water and drinks are served in mason jars, another detail which was cute. 

Since it is summer in Vegas, I was looking for a light option: the Strawberry Salad another Yelper was enjoying looked great. First I asked if any protein could be substituted for chicken, as I'm a Pescetarian: answer was no. The salad was indeed refreshing with berries, walnuts, gorgonzola and mixed greens. When the bill arrived, I was shocked that I was charged $12.00; the same price as the salad with chicken. A ""tall"" Belvedere and soda was also $12.00. Didn't want to nitpick at a party, so I paid my $31 (with Auotgrat, tax etc) and we explored the teeter totter/smoking area of patio and took photos. 

Service was professional and a little over zealous on bussing. Different people kept asking to clear plates and at one point, took someone's unfinished meal. Water glasses were regularly filled and we were asked if we needed more drinks, etc. Those having the chicken and waffle sandwich were underwhelmed: the waffle was not crispy on the outside and one said something seemed to be missing. Both the sweet potato tot and fried pickle I tasted were good; the sriracha ketchup was great - and I don't care for ketchup! In all, the meals were good, but not great. 

The patio is really pretty and has some quirky and interesting decor: mismatched plates adorn one wall and a large portrait of horses ummm mating, another. Eclectic. It looks very pretty lit up at night. 

I'd definitely come back for drinks, the bar looked cool and drink prices were reasonable. The menu could use some tweaking especially in the non-fried food, vegetarian options. A welcome addition to Fremont Street.

Things were worked out with the manager, only to have the reservation tossed out because the entire group wasn't promptly there at 11:30 pm.

2659266,2015-10-18,6,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"This is one of those rare occasions where I must say that the 4/5 stars that I giving in this review is truly based off strictly the atmosphere and one food item on their menu, but that one food item is so extraordinary that it by itself could garner a 5/5 for this entire venue. 

I have dined at the Park on Fremont twice. Once at night and once when they first opened at 11am. On both visits, I ordered different entrees and one standing appetizer: Garbage Fries. The Garbage Fries are amongst the best loaded fries that I have ever experienced. The mixture of two different cheeses, onions, fried egg, and seasonings make these fries simply decadent and an delicious indulgence that I have not found a comparable equivalent anywhere. They are a MUST ORDER item that alone make the Park on Fremont a required visit, even if you detest hipsters. 

The atmosphere is another plus. Though it certainly is designed and geared toward the hipster crowd, no question, it still provides a wonderful location right on Fremont with a great park-like patio that wraps around the restaurant. The rear patio even has a teeter totter for those wanting to feel young again. The people watching is phenomenal though you should be prepared to get stared at right back. The beggars are only a few feet away so that does detract a bit but nonetheless, it is still a great spot outside. The interior is hipster and whimsical with Trivial Pursuit cards on every table for entertainment and weird art on the walls. Overall, it is a great all around atmosphere. 

Now the negatives:

1. Though the garbage fries are incredible, I have not found any of the other appetizers or entrees to be that spectacular. The beef tacos are great but not a great value. The chicken and waffle sandwich is a bit bland and the sweet potato tots are usually lukewarm and an acquired taste at best. 

2. They do not allow kids to dine there after 6pm and prior to 6pm, they can only dine on the patio. 

3. Parking. Though there is a parking lot right adjacent to the restaurant, it is a paid parking lot that is privately owned. Your best best is to park at a casino and walk over. 

4. Though I personally do not find this to be a detractor, many will: this is truly Hipster central.  

Overall, I like the Park on Fremont. Great location, atmosphere and signature fries that are quite possibly, the best in Las Vegas.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,16,12,4,ezO1MW-FYzVD-15dP1k6sQ

It was a cold-ass weekend in Vegas and stopped in to warm up. Even though all their doors/windows were open it was cozy inside. Comfy too. All banquet and booths down one side. The patio in the front and back look very inviting but it was a bit too cold out for my wimpy self. I'll be back when it gets warmer. 

Love Moscow Mules and Mojitos? Have a Unicorn. It's a tasty cocktail that slips down a treat. Had more than a few of these. On a brunchy kind of day definitely try a passionfruit bellini. Way better than a standard mimosa. Saw a few people around us order their spiked coffees. Did I mention it was crazy cold out last weekend? 

Their food menu is super tasty comfort food. I wanted to try everything. We had delicious chipotle bbq wings. For brunch had a monty Cristo sandwich. Husband has avo toast (we're so Cali) and really enjoyed it.

But I love the decor, choice of artists prints hanging on the walls (Giclee Prints maybe? They're very crisp & framed beautifully), the back outdoor area, and the fried egg burger is my boyfriend, so I deal with it.
Park gets 4 because I shouldn't HAVE to deal with bitchy servers. They need a Mother Hen (manager) that tells them how to properly provide customer service, or boots them out the door.

Park on Freemont definitely has location and decor going for them. The restaurant is right outside of the Freemont Street experience and container park. If you are looking to check out these areas this is a prime location. The decor was also adorable. I loved all of the succulents and greenery, the hanging chandeliers, the taxidermy, patterned wallpaper. Basically hipster paradise and reminded me of almost every restaurant I visited in Austin.

Unfortunately food and service was just so-so. The waitress gave me an attitude when I asked to sit outside and when I asked if there was an option to look at the lunch menu in addition to the brunch. We sat outside at one of the few front tables, and when I went to the bathroom I discovered that there was a beautiful courtyard with a ton of seating. It would have been really nice to be given that option - especially considering it was fairly empty when we arrived because they had just opened. 

My wings were rubbery and not crispy at all. My fiance's loaded tots were topped with so much queso that the tots basically just turned into one big mush. The chicken in the dish was rubbery as well. Not sure if we made bad picks or just mehh food... but we were not satisfied. Best part of the meal was the 20 dollar bottle of champagne that came in a plastic shopping bag. So. Hipster. But that's basically like 5 or 6 mimosas for 20 dollars which is a steal.

Overall it is a very fun, affordable restaurant located right in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. They do offer endless mimosas which is always a necessity for my brunch sessions. Servers are friendly and if the weather allows for it, I love to sit into their ""backyard"" patio. They even feature a cool seesaw behind the brick wall. I have tried several different brunch options on their menu. My favorite so far has been the french toast and chilaquiles, I will usually order both tbh lol

Located on the corner of Fremont Street and Las Vegas Blvd, right before the entrance to the Old Vegas Strip. They have a patio out the side and a patio in the back, as well as indoor seating. I recommend sitting in the back, which has beautiful and unique decorations.  Get a spot under an umbrella and order some drinks, it is the perfect setting! 

The drink I recommend is the Twig and Berry Mule, made with crushed berries,  gin, elderflower alcohol and ginger beer - so delicious and refreshing! 

For food we had the Texas Burger, Caesar Salad, Fish Tacos and the Vegetarian Wrap. All were great! Loved the fish tacos, the fish was very fresh. The burger was also super good.  

To sum it up, if you are in Vegas and looking for something a bit different than the typical Vegas thing than Park is it! Eclectic decorations, good food and drinks! A must visit!",JmEoVSQeo76p37LNrQUwuw,3,3,5,ywZO8oo7evTry89FOt4Gow

My comments were about why LGBT community continues to defend muslims when muslims would throw you/them off buildings. If that offends then you need to learn about logic. Stop with the cry baby nonsense and stop creating lies to justify the bad treatment I received. I'm wondering if Park at Fremont is part of the militant gay community and is all about shaming rather than open conversation.

We visited on Friday lunch time. Got seated immediately. Most people there seemed like tourists day-drinking (must be nice!!), and some like us were there for lunch grub.

Their food menu is quite limited but very well selected. There's something for everyone.

We ordered Samurai Tots for appetizer, ham and Swiss Monte Cristo for my main, my husband ordered chicken and waffle sandwich.

Let me tell you about this Samurai Tots! First of all, they give you a lot of tots! Good enough for 4 people, I'd say. For two of us, honestly, we could've just ordered this and we'd still be full. 
I don't remember the description of this dish, but basically, it's Takoyaki, but tots instead of puff balls. Garnished with green onion, Sriracha mayo (could've been aoli, don't remember) and okonomiyaki sauce, fish flakes....I have to admit, I ate way too much. They're damn good!!

I'm a fan of sweet and savory, so Ham and Swiss Monte Cristo hit the spot for sure. 
My husband liked his chickenand waffle sandwich. It had bacon in it, waffle was semi crispy outside, soft inside. And that perfectly for crispy chicken.

2929010,2016-10-20,2,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"2 Stars is what I am giving the Park. Let's break it down. 

Pros: Let's talk about the good qualities of the Park. This place is super cute and has great style. Very mellow vibe, chill atmosphere. Cute patio seating. I recommend ordering the mimosas "" Patio Pounders"". The orange juice was really good and they bring your bottle of Prosecco on ice in this cute clear bag. They bring you some cute small mason jars to sip from. This was my favorite part of the experience. 


Cons: Now, onto the shortcomings. The staff, definitely needs some fine tuning.
When we approached the hostess she seated us immediately, once we were seated on the patio, it took 15-20 min. to take our order. Common, after a long night of drinking in Vegas, we were really hungry! 15-20 min feels like an hour. While waiting for our server, we smelled garbage, i guess it was garbage day in the lot next to the Park. Sitting and waiting on someone to take our order while smelling garbage is a horrible combination. My patiences were being tested at this point. I had to flag down a server to ask where our server was, seems like both servers didn't communicate as to who will serve our table.The food, wasn't anything special. We ordered Chilaquiles-never seen a version like this one before (everything came separated), Mini Corn dogs, Mac & Cheese balls and a burger. It was 3 of us who all ate and shared. The food wasn't as hot as I would like it to be, the oil they used to cook the food tasted old and upset our stomachs. The steak that went with our chilaquiles had a ton of fat on it, was super tough, chips seemed store bought. My friend asked for a diet Coke 2 times, as they forgot to bring it to her twice. We spoke with the manager and told her our concerns she was nice enough to take the items off the bill, I appreciated that. She was very apologetic about the situation.

Summary: Very cute place and has all the potential to be a great restaurant, has the look, but the food needs to be better. Better staff and more staff is need. It's all about ambiance, food and service. They missed the mark on food and service, which so very important in the restaurant biz! Would I go back?

Never made it out back and no I didn't ride the see-saw either.  I'm starting to see a trend on East Fremont...subpar service and seemingly a bit of collusion amongst the other establishments.  Did you all get together and decide that the average price for a quality beer is going to be 8-10 bucks and that PBR will be 2 dollars?  

The decor in the bar is pretty cool with interesting stuff to look at. They also have a decent selection of micro brews from out of state, both bottled and draft.  Service this night was a very slow start.  I sat at the bar inside for nearly 15 minutes before being greeted.  Finally someone came over and expressed surprise nobody had taken care of me yet.  Umm, you're one of the ones ignoring me too, haha!  After the slow start, service was OK...basically what I've come to expect on this block in Vegas...not great, just OK.  Are all of the bartenders on this block newbs?  Me thinks so.  Call center tech support by day, attempting bartending by evening is my guess.

Anyway...for dinner I had the Philly Mac and Cheese.  What's that you ask...well it's their version of a Philly cheesesteak with mac and cheese plopped on top. I was skeptical to say the least but figured what the heck I'll give it a shot.  So, I'm from Philly...doesn't compare at all but the added mac and cheese on top made it unique enough that I would recommend trying it and may even order that again myself. 

My plea to all owners and managers on East Fremont:  figure out a way to get your staff to be on point.  The trendiness of your location only goes so far; repeated subpar service will drive your clientele away in the long term.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,6,2,3,6TK3Wx-_vFc8NajZuWcZpQ

The Park on Fremont was a great breath of fresh air, both for the atmosphere (actual wood) and the price (holy cow $5 for happy hour food?). The drinks were good, I can see how they would be seen as 'hipster,' but I got a mule and a beer and the mule was excellent. 

The food. Oh, the food. Let me say now that if you are hammered and go here, eat to your hearts content. But beware the food portions can sneak up on you. For our first round my associate and I ordered wings and 'garbage' (read: nacho) fries with a fried egg on top. The fried egg alone made the fries seem like they were copulated in another universe. The wings were pretty good as well. 

Our second round consisted of boneless wings (so we could try the sauces) and the deep-friend mac and cheese balls. We were way in over our heads.....within one portion of each we were tapping out faster than you could imagine. The fried mac and cheese balls were insane, amazing, I don't have any other words for it. I just wish I could have finished them all :\

I didn't partake in any of the Taco Tuesday festivities, but the food looked very good and the you can't beat one dollar Dos Equis, even if it's the eight ounce bottles. 

Park on Fremont offers a large variety of craft beers; Magic hat, Dogfish Head, Ballast Point, and the list goes on. Plus a small, but decent arrangement of whiskeys, my poison for the evening was Knob Creek, Straight Rye. Perfect after dinner drink.

It really is aboout time someone made a great version, or 5, of my favorite drink. I had been wanting to try this place knowing it was the sister of Commonwealth, but after reading Misti Y.'s review and learning of the drink menu I knew I had to get here ASAP! 
They have a few seating options, front patio- (you can see everyone walking down Fremont GREAT people watching). Inside- (dim, bar, tables, booth and awesome photography all over). Back Patio (garden, cool yet strange decor, secret hidden area with a seesaw that you can actually use). The only downfall to the back patio is the scent of trash. They are in the back alley and the dumpster makes its appearance known. They try to hide the scent by burning incense but it doesn't do it 100%.
The drinks are $10 each, with the exception of one bloody mary that comes with bacon and an egg. That one is $12. 
I tried 2 different versions. The first was the Texas Tuxedo infused with cucumber and basil. It was more refreshing than your average mary. The second was a Lady Cave which was pretty much a classic served with celery and I added olives. 
I will be risky next time and try the whiskey mary. Didn't want to mix my liquors too early on this trip. 
Food was 3 outta 5 stars. I had the hammered chicken which was a chicken salad with baby greens, candied nuts and either blue or goat cheese I truly cant remember. Probably because there was so little of it in my salad. It was mostly chicken and lettuce and the chicken was a tad dry. 
My bf got the ruben, and it was basic but good. 
I want to come back and sit inside and on the front patio so I can experience everything. Also I have heard they have a few new menu items and I have a feeling this place will only improve. Can't wait to come try the rest of the drinks and grub!",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,3,1,4,n5aKy77ALZpzdW5gz3eAIA

We had seen them on Adam Richmond's secret menu item show on the Travel Channel  and we were really looking forward to devouring them-POO!

We settled on the Mac n Cheese balls $8 and the Chicken n Waffle Sammie $13.  The Mac n Cheese balls were golf ball sized scoops of panko crusted, deep fried mac n cheese with jalapeno and bacon too boot.  One bite of that crispy, creamy goodness and we were transported to mac n cheese heaven.  My wife doesn't even like mac n cheese and I was forced to share them with her cuz they were that darn good LMAO!

The chicken and waffle sammie holds two deep fried chicken breasts and a healthy portion of crispy bacon.  I am not a fan of chicken and waffles but this concoction was still pretty tasty.

When we arrived, we were glibly told that there was no more food being served. So we opted just for drinks. My girlfriend ordered a Long Island iced tea and I a Manhattan. Both were served completely wrong. First, the Long Island was served in a cheap plastic cup, and was made completely wrong. It tasted more like lemonade than anything else. We weren't even sure it was the right drink. My Manhattan came in a tiny rocks glass and was actually served on the rocks. There's no way if it was properly made to portion, that it would have even fit in that tiny glass (with the improperly added ice). It tasted like barely more than a Bourbon on the rocks. The bartender had no clue what he was making or how to make them. And for paying $24 for the two drinks, they should have been made right. Not to mention that if you walk down the street to Atomic Liquors, you'll get the best Manhattans made in all of downtown. Beyond all of this, we were part of a group who had called ahead and told them we would have 30-60 people coming. And at $12 a drink, that's a lot of money. However, the management treated us all like crap and decided to make it last call at around 10 minutes to Midnight. Really? On Fremont street in Las Vegas? What, does the staff have school in the morning? Save your time, your money, and the pain and just go to a better bar.

I got the fish taco of the appetizer section of the menu thinking it was small enough to be an appetizer, they ended up being given 3 normal sized fish tacos, but they were so good, I could have eaten another order.

8:30pm Friday night - When we got to the restaurant, I told the hostess we needed a table for two.  She started guiding us to a table outside facing Fremont Street, so I asked her if there was a table available in the back garden.  She told us that if we wanted to take a seat in the front, she would come get us once a table was ready in the garden.  

Twenty minutes went by, and the hostess (girl with long/straight/two toned hair), was nowhere to be found.  Seems as though she went on break and forgot about us.  After my guest and I were done with our first round of drinks, I decided to go up to the new hostess to ask if a table was available for us in the back.  The new hostess apologized that her coworker had forgotten about us, and then walked us into the back garden, where there were several open seats - why we weren't given a seat in the garden initially is a mystery to me.  

The garden was exactly what I imagined it to be.  I wouldn't recommend taking older folks here, since the music is LOUD and some of the chairs are slightly uncomfortable.  

I wish they had more apps on the menu.  It would be nice to order a few sides, rather than a large meal.  They have fries, etc, but nothing healthy.  I ended up ordering the veggie sliders - which were delicious.  The buns were stale, but the veggie patty itself, was delicious!  My guest had the corn flake crusted chicken and he LOVED IT!

Throughout the meal, our waitress was missing, a lot.  Our drinks were empty most of the time, and I even noticed the table next to us making loud slurping noises from their glasses (probably hoping to get the attention of a waiter).  The outside bar had a group of employees hanging around talking most of the time, so the issue wasn't understaffing.  

I hope management reads these reviews, because I really want to like this place.  I am hoping it was just a bad night.  I'll be back soon to try it again, but if the service is still sloppy and careless, I won't be back.  I used to be a concierge at a major strip property, and I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending this place yet to anyone (until they work our these small, but large, kinks).  I hope I can come back here at a later time and update my review with more stars - like I said, I really want to like this place.

I had the Unicorn beverage and it was delicious - I drank it too fast so maybe there was a lot of ice, but I enjoyed it either way and it was fairly priced for a craft cocktail in Downtown Las Vegas. We ordered the giant mules after each having an individual cocktail - 2 for the table and while I'm sure it's mostly ice making then overpriced, it was fun and different and they were honestly delicious. I'd definitely say it's worth the trip to Fremont Street to check out Park on Fremont perhaps after a stroll down Fremont Street Old Las Vegas.",_NpSl8OWMrQH45mfqia9zQ,1,0,5,XcjWnapXdPkGpW7DSvKCJQ

Right across from the Fremont experience downtown, Park is perfect for people watching! You will see people of all walks of life doing all kinds d things. You will not get bored... Promise. 

This place is all about the cocktails. I'm talking straight up mixology. The first few times I went and read their cocktail list k thought they were crazy with some of their concoctions...but that is why they're the experts and I'm not. Although they sound like crazy mixtures, their drinks are some of the most delicious drinks I've had here in town.  If you go, the pillow talk is the most refreshing and amazing drink I've had-ever. 

This place is also ultra trendy. You and your friends trying to find someplace new to try that's cool and hip? Suggest this place and your group won't be disappointed. From the second you walk in you know your entering a cool place as the staff is dressed in flannels. Flannels are always a good sign. The decor adds to the cool, unique, and trendy vibe you get. Everything is super bizarre but put together in a way that works. 

If weather permits, I really recommend sitting out on the back patio. Really cool seating and great vibes out there. Also, if you can pull yourself away from your party for long enough there is a ""secret"" seesaw behind the wall with the fireplace in it. Always get good laughs when you take a ride on that thing. 

Like I said, this place is all about the scene and the cocktails. That is why they get 4 stars and not 5. Although it's a great place and I will definitely be going back time and time again.... Their food, to me, is just good. Which isn't a bad thing, but I also don't think it's 5 star worthy. Also, their service can be pretty slow. I've only ever had one server there that took care of us at a good rate. Otherwise, I've always been left waiting. Trying to flag down my server to speed the process along.

Last week I was finally able to check this place off my bucket list or should I say my ""collections of bookmarked"" places on Yelp to try. I had a business expo event downtown this past week and decided to search around for some places to eat in the area with my co-workers. Park on Fremont was the closest so why not?

We arrived around the lunchtime hour (1PM-ish) and assumed they would be busy and we would have to rush to eat. Nope! To our surprise it wasn't busy at all (Thank GOD) because we were on a bit of a time crunch. Seated promptly our server came over to take our drink orders and because we had a whole 8 hours to go nobody opted for any adult beverages.. Yes we are responsible individuals lol. Anyways the water comes out in this cool glass jug and the cups in these little glass jars (cute).

Browsing the menu for lunch I guess I was a bit indecisive because they didn't really have anything that stuck out for me to try for lunch. I ended up with a Greek Salad (I know boring). My co-workers ordered the Turkey Bacon ""Avo-Philly"" and Marinated Chicken Tacos. Everyone's general response for the food was ""meh just okay"". Perhaps it was because we didn't order any of the special items or the lunch menu just wasn't for us.

My friend ordered a grilled cheese and apparently they no longer make that but it's on the menu.  I had to be wild and crazy and order iced tea just to find out they don't carry iced tea. 

We changed our orders and i ordered a burger with cheese and mushrooms.  When it arrived, it had avocado on it.  I thought i had forgotten to tell the server to leave it off the burger but when i reread the menu, it didn't say it had avocado.  I waited about 8 minutes and flagged down the food runner since our server was no where in sight.  I then asked her to have it removed and she told me she had ordered the wrong burger for me.

When my burger finally arrives, it had a very small amount of cheese but the mushrooms and bacon were no where to be found. I actually took it apart to verify they weren't hiding somewhere and nope, no mushrooms.

A few friends and I strolled in on a Thursday night. It wasn't overly crowded but busy enough to get the feeling that Park on Fremont is the place to be. Ambiance is all types of adorable.  Quite eclectic, actually. Inside, there are booths and tables and a good size bar area.  There are rustic chandeliers hanging in the hallway that leads to the outside patio. Cool pictures and paintings hang from the wall as well as antique plates and saucers. 

My favorite part of Park on Fremont is their outside patio area. They have good picnic table seating for the size of the patio. There are cute lights all over the place - on the walls, in the tree. Awesome sign that says ""F*cking Beautiful"" (I think everyone should take a picture in front of this green neon sign!). When the weather is perfect and you're around fun people, the patio is where it's happening!

I had one of their refreshing cocktails, the ""Pillow Talk"". This is so yummy! Cucumbers, strawberries, orange, mint and lemon mixed with soda and some alcohol/liquor (I forget, I'm sorry!) makes this drink in a mason jar perfect for a summer night! I saw that other people were ordering shots and those come in mini mason jars as well. Love! 

My two gal pals and I ordered a small chocolate cheesecake dessert that came in a shot glass. This stuff is super rich, super sweet, super delish. Don't let the size fool  you - bigger is not always better. 

From what I hear, their food is so-so. But the ambiance and the drinks are so awesome that food or no food, I'll be coming back in the near future.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,1,2,4,PIrQYR8JHtuyQAvSQcChvA

Well, I heard that POF was trying a new breakfast option and had an exclusive special for Zapponians.

I took my coworker with me for an early morning walk to try out their new offerings!

Chef Thomas was there to greet the both of as we were the first to arrive and Dustin (#Mixologist), gave us the lowdown about the menu.

Honestly, they were so nice we felt we were ""red carpet"" guests. 

We placed our order and enjoyed some ice tea while we waited for our food.

The turkey sausage breakfast sandwich is just right. The warm brioche bread hugging eggs and sausage with some jack cheese is probably anyone's go to favorite. 

The one detail I noticed is when you bite into the sandwich, the yolk is still soft leaving you with this nice warm golden gravy! Yum!

The scramble is another one that may another favorite for anyone.
Fluffy scrambled eggs, caramelized onions and brioche bread is a great combo, what brings it in for this cool
morning was the gentle Sriracha mayo that gives the right bit of heat.

Lastly, The Toast called The Morning Razzle. Buttery toasted bread topped with Nutella and raspberry jam!

If you like sweets in the morning like I do, then this could be your option!

Seating is on their patio next to the restaurant, parking is also available.

If you're in downtown Fremont stop by, have a seat, enjoy some coffee and a breakfast sandwich while you watch the world go by.

The Strip is what most people think of when they think of Vegas: Showy, glamourous, bright lights, etc, but Downtown has been undergoing a quiet revival in the last few years. Sure it still has the marks of ""old Vegas"" and has yet to be completely cleaned up or even gentrified, but it's become home to some drinking establishments that are actually pretty unique, my favourite among them being one of the newer kids on the block, Park on Fremont. Situated in the hip and trendy East Fremont district, which is home to many bars, Park on Fremont is a grand exercise in the power of kitsch and how awesome it looks and feels. Not only is it one of the only watering holes in the area that is open during the day, but it's also got a pretty good food menu, decent drinks and a wonderful atmosphere.

We ordered our food before it happened. 

Then it came get from behind. At first, slow and strumming, prickling your spine. In a moment, a nightmareish maelstrom of indie wail cliche and country rock covers. A guitar from stations you skip while scanning the radio. The Band! The Wallflowers! Oh Christ! HELP! I completely lost my appetite and needed another drink. Is this how they make money? Drive you to drinking? If I was hungover I would have thrown up by now. It sounds like Trey Parker doing a parody of Tom Petty for an episode where the South Park kids have brunch in Las Vegas and have to endure crap live ""entertainment"" that they didn't want to pay for.

I'm amazed they are still seating people at tables back here. Are these people crazy? I'm only here because I've placed my food order BCM (before crap music). That's right this is so bad, such a significant impact that we must start history over at year zero CM. We are in a new era of crap music. This Bloody Mary is cold comfort. I may need the bottle.

Still waiting for my Chilaquiles. I hope they aren't offended by this Beatles cover if they arrive right now.

Honestly, I wasn't really impressed by Park.  They have prime real estate on the corner of Fremont overlooking the street, so I assumed the food would be top notch as well.  Don't get me wrong, the food was fine.  We had a make-your-own burger and kale salad.  Both were as good as you'll get anywhere around town.  But the problem with the location is the $3-4 upcharge on all meals when the meal is worth as much as a non-Fremont meal.  The beer also stood at around $1-2 too expensive.  All in all a nice spot to eat if you want to people watch, but there are better restaurants within a few blocks that I would recommend over Park for the same price with a more intimate and secluded atmosphere.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,x8t06sOY7dFYfeepW6aARA

When we sat down, we didn't know what drinks we wanted yet, but said we definitely wanted fried pickles. We ordered drinks a few minutes later.

Then he said ""Oh no, I'm stupid"" and put it in the computer right next to him. No apology! Then, it took about 15 minutes to get the pickles. We asked for them to go, but they came out regularly.

 The restaurant has a really cool look. Copper tables, barstools, foot rails  every thing looked hand made. With saloon style wallpaper on the ceiling and some really cool hunting art on the walls my favorite piece was the stuffed deer head with gold punk rock spiked antlers that curved into 2 Gold machine guns. Yes machine guns And a painted cartoon style rendition of lady gaga in her meat dress.

 it wasn't till I couldn't find pizza on the small menu as the waiter was taking our order and when I asked he said no that's next door. (awkward) I thought park on Fremont was where you park. ( lol) So I scanned quickly as my friend ordered a cheese burger, Fries and Mac and cheese balls. I got the cajun chicken sandwich and fries with extra seasoning. The food was pretty good the chicken had just enough Cajun seasoning. Juicy chicken my friends burger was really good he had not had a burger in awhile so it was a treat for him fries were good and the Mac and cheese balls are delicious with a little bacon and taste home made. My friend don't eat pork and ate 4 of them. For dessert i had to have a doughnut ice cream sandwich. You gotta try one of these. Off the charts. Check was about 39 bucks + a 20% tip .

I was shocked when the bartender told me they had Johnny Blue for only $21 a shot. I dont normally drink scotch at brunch but that was too good to pass up.

Our server was also great. Quick with the drinks and friendly. 
I ordered the Philly cheesecake topped with Mac and Cheese (yes, topped) at our server's suggestion, and it was pretty delicious. I really like that you can order a salad as a side option, and it was really good.

3411671,2013-04-24,6,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"You gotta love places like Park on Fremont because of what they are trying to do: Revamp an area and make cool what once was not so cool. I have to give them mad respect, just for that fact.

Owned by the same folks who own Commonwealth, this nifty little place has all the right elements to make it stand out as a contender amongst the other places popping up Downtown. They have not been open very long, so they might get more stars later on in an update if things change. But as it sits right now, I would have to say, ""come for the patio, stay for the unique beer choices.""

The front and back patios are both great, but each one has a different vibe. The back is more chill, bigger and prettier. There is a smoking area with a see-saw and cool plants and flowers all over the place. It's a nice little reprieve from the craziness of Fremont St. 
Ambiance inside is really cool, with a trendy and artsy sort of vibe. The front patio is louder, there are more people milling about, and you get to watch all the ""Fremont Freaks and Geeks"" wave their crazy flag proudly! I'm not hatin', I'm one of them!

The beer list is pretty extensive for a smaller place like this. They have everything from Coors and Mickey's Malt Liquor, to Young's Double Chocolate Stout and Lost Coast Sacramento Blonde. Honestly, you almost start wishing they sold beer flights so you could try a little bit of everything. 
There is a cool ""beer and a shot"" combo option on the drink menu, which always seems like a fun concept, if you are in to that sort of thing.

One element I have not been so enthralled with is the food. The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots are really funky, but in a good way! The sweet mustard dipping sauce they include with 'em really adds that extra ""yum"" factor. 
But a few of the dishes I have tried were just sorta ok. The first time I visited, I tried to order the Grilled Cheese on Brioche, which sounded to die for. It was 86'ed, which was fine, because it was their grand opening week and they had just had their soft open right before, so they had run out of a bunch of things. Not a big deal. I'll get it next time :) 
Instead, I tried the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak, which was pretty tasty. 

But the second time I visited, I was sad to see that they had taken that grilled cheese off entirely!! Sad, sad day. So I chose the Veggie Wrap, which came in a tortilla-type of casing. 
It was just ""Eh."" Kinda greasy, which sometimes is good, but not in this case. Not enough melted cheese, and not enough feta crumbles. Plus, the veggies were kinda wet.... Overall, it's been a little hit-and-miss with the food here. I'm confident it will more likely than not get better over time. Maybe I'm just being picky, or perhaps I have ordered the wrong things. Only time and more visits will tell.

But still come here! Sit at the patio! Especially out front. If you are a lady, you will get a couple creepy homeless dudes mackin' on you. Be prepared. And don't keep your phone or wallet on the side of the table closest to the fence, because someone could just run by and grab it. The nice thing is they do have a security guy standing by the front, just in case.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,9,5,3,0EQa4tB1EO9blKyTDZ32ag

Looking at their menu, they had such unique and fun names for the drinks such as ""The Bored and the Beautiful"". I ordered the ""Hunting Season"" which sounded like a heavenly mango bloody mary but unfortunately since mangos were not in season, they had to change up the drink a little bit but it was still yummy. The drink I'll always remember is their GRAPEFRUIT BEER! If you love fruity drinks, you MUST get this. I could drink this all day and everyday... if my asian glow/ allergies would allow me to :(

I probably spent half my time here being mesmerized by all the unique decor. I love the quote above the bar, the chandeliers hanging in the hallway, the beautiful outdoor patio with vintage hanging plates and the hidden smoking area with a TEETER TOTTER! I hadn't been on a teeter totter since I was like 4 so I was definitely a little too excited and a little too intoxicated which led to a very painful memory so beware haha. They clearly put a lot of attention to detail in their decor and it's definitely eye catching and distracting!

There is also an eccentric twist to their vintage decor which was a little creepy for me.... there were one too many pictures of voodoo-ish girl dolls in the bathroom and some lightly morbid decor like the stuffed birds around the bar area that were a little too much for me. I will admit that I was scared that Nancy S. and I were scared to go to the bathroom alone LOL. Maybe it was me and my paranoia but I just felt a slightly haunted vibe going on there. 

Despite the creepy things that bothered me a little bit about this place, I would definitely be back for their drinks and cool vibe. If I lived in Vegas, I feel like I would be a regular here.

FOOD
Veggie Sliders with Sweet Potato Teeter Tots: The Veggie Sliders were bland.  No flavor whatsoever. There was a thin layer of what looked like mayonnaise, but its flavor wasn't detectable at all. The yellow, sweet sauce used for dipping the tots into didn't help. I even requested some mustard to slather onto the mini, meatless patties. Again, no flavor. I concocted a mixture consisting of both sweet sauce and mustard. Still, no flavor. These sliders need their own special sauce or more seasonings because these were beyond dull. 

The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots tasted similar to churros. They were sweet and a little crunchy. Its accompanying sauce was unnecessary. 

SERVICE
Our waitress did a good job at checking up on us often. Though, she seemed to exhibit hesitance after I requested mustard for my sliders. 

OTHER
The patio is lovely, and I like the whole feeling of outdoor urban dining. BUT, I wouldn't suggest dining out there. The stench of sewage and garbage tainted the air and wafted into our direction. At one point, one of the employees lit a stick of incense which wasn't strong enough to mask the overpowering odors.

Great food, good drinks, fun atmosphere and, let's be honest, every adult, if given the opportunity will play on a see-saw. With that said, the service is AWFUL. Having a collective of bartenders, service staff, and management treat us with a complete lack of respect is inexcusable.  

We had made reservations a week in advance only to find out on the day of that there was no record of it. We thought we had fixed the issue with, Julie, the ""manager"" however when people started to arrive they were told it was last call.  Apparently, Julie hadn't fixed the problem at all and the 40 of us were left without a venue. Our savvy party planner to the rescue could fix this, yes? I mean, what bar in their right mind throws out 40 people on a freaking Tuesday? Park on Fremont, that's who. After Julie kicked out said party planner 30 seconds later and the place was empty. However, the bar across the street was more than accommodating.

The French toast ($10) lacked a good sear and was soggy -- unable to hold up to the custard it was soaked in. Topped with mixed berries, it was an unspectacular dish. Even worse was the fried chicken and waffle sandwich ($11). A thick, oily breading coated strips of breast meat and were sandwiched between soggy waffles. The best of the items we tried were the mac n cheese balls ($8). Five per order and coated in a light layer of panko breadcrumbs, the mac n cheese inside wasn't half bad when compared to the other dishes. 

The almost-garish decor makes for a good conversation starter and photos. Who doesn't want to see a classically painted portrait of a horse mounting another horse?

However, the stuffed wild fowl behind the bar are appropriate fixtures in this contemporary, urban play on a vintage, Texas hunting lodge.  The menu is short, simple and centered on South-Western American fair and barbecue.  

I arrived for brunch semi-haphazardly as Eat was over-booked and The Beat was having trouble with their cash register. The staff at Park greeted me pleasantly. The Server was certainly enthusiastic about the food and I took her recommendations: the Texas Tuxedo Bloody Mary and the Ranch Breakfast Skillet. I also had a cup of joe.

First, I should state that the coffee was proper, as far as restaurant coffee goes.  It was fresh and just the right strength. The Bloody Mary, featuring fresh basil and a cucumber slice, was savory and refreshing,  peppery and minty.  It was an original recipe that became an instant classic for me.  

The Ranch Skillet was not a disappointment, either.  When it was laid before me, I found layer after layer after layer of breakfast ingredients stacked one on top of the other: a bed of crisped red potato wedges, grilled onions and peppers, a scoop of chorizo, a handful of cheddar, and two perfectly fried eggs, all served in a sizzling cast-iron skillet. I recommend this to any patron looking for a spicy South Western breakfast.

The skill of the restaurant's kitchen staff showed through in the Ranch Skillet as well as their commitment to quality and attention to detail.  

I encourage every one to visit Park on Fremont for brunch.  It was certainly a happy accident that I wandered in this morning, but it was no accident that the food was excellent... because these folks really know what they're doing.

Beer selection was great, decor/atmosphere was great - make sure to check out the patio out back.  I wasn't in love with my burger, though.. I didn't find it particularly flavorful - the meat especially didn't stand out to me.  Also, I did not like the tots that much.. being sweet potato they were covered in cinnamon, which is fine and complimented the taste, but.. they were small and not that crispy or fluffy.  I would have liked a bigger sized tot, for sure - and maybe something like a drizzle of honey on them?  I don't know.. also, the sauce that they were served with did not go at all.. I kept trying it but was not into it.  

As for the fried pickles.. I liked the batter they used (although I would have liked it a little thicker and/or maybe with a little cornmeal mixed in?) and they were fried properly.  I did not like the pickles on the inside.. I know they were homemade but they were barely pickled.. I expect my fried pickles to be very pickled and super classic dill-pickle style.  These were hipster fried pickles, take that as you may...

I would come back here for drinks and give a chance to some other things on the menu.. maybe I just didn't find the right thing yet - it *is* a cool spot.",ucfCpo-qkQWE-pXp2873Uw,1,1,3,hw8qx5TOXpyaTNRelmV8-g

We're usually in DTLV on Wednesdays anyways so, decided to check it out before hitting up Commonwealth.

Even before going to Park, I had been seeing pictures of this place on Instagram and was really excited to go.

We entered into what seemed like a chill lounge area fronted by a patio with white picket fences... CUTE, right.

My BF knew the hostess; and she originally seated us in a booth in the lounge but, said she freed up a table in back for us.

We walked into what seemed like ""secret (not really) garden"" setting in that the decor seemed so whimsical and romantic. There was a tree decorated with lights in the middle of the patio surrounded by a flower garden; and our table was right next to it. It was so pretty. My boyfriend and I talk about how it would be a great setting for a 1st date as there's alot of people watching and the decor itself just gave alot to talk about.

My boyfriend ordered his favorite beer, Banana Bread Beer, which obviously tastes like what it sounds. I ordered ""The Unicorn"" cocktail just because there was ginger beer in it. And we decided to share the chicken and waffles sandwich with sweet potato tater tots.

As we waited for our food, we noticed more things about the decor. Like there was an iron carriage on one of their rooftops; there were baby Jordans (Nike shoes for all the un-sneakerheads) hanging from a wire that runs across the patio; AND there was a see-saw (teeter-totter) in their designated smoking section. 
Told you --- WHIMSICAL =) I loved it. 
Also, always love wallpaper and THEY gots it. Almost like Cosmopolitan Hotel's funky wallpapers!

My boyfriend got his beer; and we got the chicken and waffles sammie. The chicken was savory with all the maple on it and really thin like a chicken katsu; I liked it very much. The waffles, on the otherhand, not-so-much. It was soft =( 
I'm sure my eggo waffles at home would have been better!
Thankfully, the sweet potato tots more than made up for the shoddy waffles. 

Sadly, I never got my ""Unicorn"" cocktail til almost the end of dinner. Waitress said the bar was backed up. 
New restaurant; I know they're still figuring out the kinks.


Overall, I'm in love with this place. And it's going to add that extra chicness that DTLV's hipster scene is becoming.

I have tried most of the sandwiches on the menu.  I love the decor, it is creepy and dark and reminds me of well done places such as The Act, Bootsy Bellows, or Voyer in San Diego. 

Sadly what is lacking at this spot is the service.  I don't blame the staff.  It is as if someone running the restaurant has not previous food and beverage experience. They could do a higher volume if they were staffed properly.  

For example, after the Neon Run, which ended in front of Park.  I was on the back patio.  It was full of runners who were hungry and thirsty.  There was one girl working the back.  She was cranky from being frazzled.  I had bottled water and since I was dying after my run, I pulled it out to drink while I waited to put in my order. I took one swig and security that was on the patio came and took it from me.  Wearily I said, ""I'm so thirsty and I just ran.""  

""Sorry no outside drinks.""  He said and took it from my hand.  I was to tired to protest.  I watched as he walked the entire patio, which was full of runners, and took water from everyone.  I couldn't believe that with all of us they couldn't have made a slight exception.  My suspicion is that if they would have been staffed appropriately for the rush after the race we could have all had waters on our table.  

They need to work on training staff better for customer service, and to staff better for times when there are events downtown.",ToIicW_B8O4_Nx-1EBWbfg,2,0,3,eo3mN1W-4hBf5UCfgVmUEA

Sadly, the tough steak took away from enjoying my meal. I had a hard time cutting into the slices and chewing, but the marination and flavor of the steak was good. 

I think I drank a good 8 mason jars full of mimosas before I could finally get a good buzz. Which made me wonder if they over pour orange juice in it or the champagne isn't as strong as decent champagne usually is. Then again it is $20 bottomless for a reason. 

The place is super hipster and fun, which I love because it does give you something to look at and enjoy while waiting or sitting around. The backyard is super fun! Think the backyard is all there is? Nay! Follow the wonderfully decadent china wall and to the end you'll find a small opening where the fun teeter-totters are hidden! What fun! We had a ball with that one and any person who says they don't teeter-totter, I guarantee you a few mimosas later you'll be riding that thing like charlie brown!

The service was very attentive always asking how we are doing and constantly refilling our drinks. Sandy they ran out of mimosas right before we could order one last one before it ended, but high tens to the bartender because she was nice enough to give us one last round of shots to end our happy hour.

Philly Mac and Cheese Steak. --  http://bit.ly/1mfuMNf
Thin sliced sirloin with bell peppers and onions, topped with mac & cheese.
On paper, the Philly Mac & Cheese Steak sounds over the top delicious.  But overall it was really dry.  I think mine could've used a lot more cheese sauce.  That probably would've made it a lot better.  Nice try though!  The side of sweet potato tots were good though and I'm glad they threw in some honey mustard dipping sauce for it.

Service was really good here.  My waitress was really friendly and enthusiastic and always checked on me.  But then again, I was the only customer out on the patio at the time.  I could imagine things getting a little hectic later in the day and at night especially.  No complaints from me though, my server was awesome!

Now that I typed those words, let's get started because we just did.

Service here was great. The hostess immediately greeted us upon entry. Staff was dressed casually, our server talked to us straight forward, nothing came across as ""scripted"" as would happen at other places.

My wife ate what was called ""garbage."" Let me type that again, my wife ate what was called ""garbage."" They are described as ""Our house made fries layered with melted cheddar and provolone cheese and covered with bacon, jalapenos, green onions, tomatoes, chipotle peppers, avocados and topped with fried egg."" My wife took the jalapenos off.

I ordered the Chicken Bar Bites which are cornflake crusted boneless chicken tenders served plain or tossed in your choice of sauce. Honey Mustard, Buffalo, Chipotle BBQ. Our server brought eight small containers, each filled with sauces. 

The food however just didn't ""wow"" us, which is why I didn't give a 5 star rating.
While we were eating a large group of people, 20-24 individuals I would say. Came in through the front door, and walked through the restaurant towards the patio dining area in the back. I thought to myself what a large party this is. Not 5 minutes later the same group of people, LEFT right out the front door. Turns out this group of people are a tourist group that WALKS through various restaurants. Great publicity for Park On Fremont. But I would be starving after ""a tour.""

Just a thought. 

Anyway. 

Enormous beer list and cocktail menu. Awesome decor. Not super unreasonable prices. I didn't try the food but the drinks are great and the atmosphere provides for good conversation. One sour (literally) spot: wafts of sewage can and will spoil your afternoon patio experience. They burn incense to try to cover it up, but just like the other smell that incense usually tries to cover up: it can only go so far. Sucks for Park because there's nothing they can really do about it.

Friday and Saturday nights are definitely their busiest, as to be expected, but the hostess we met (Nita) was very helpful in getting us seated fairly quickly for how busy it was!  We have run into her before in our weekly adventures downtown.  It's awesome to see that this business employs people who make sure to put their customers first!

I have yet to try the food here, but they do have a good $10 beer and a shot special.  And this special doesn't have to involve a well shot.  When they have it, I usually get a Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA (usually around $14 a bottle in most bars) with a Jameson shot.  Definitely a good value!

As far as their other drinks go, their Bloody Mary drink (made with tequila) is great! Definitely recommend it if you're up to trying something a little different.  This place is more than worth a try if you haven't stopped by already!",V2bl7S_if9QM4iud1LoDUQ,1,1,5,be1e2cgP1VBcQiInrFnOpA

Our server was nice, friendly and answered all questions. We have a hard time choosing food sometimes and she provided suggestions. We went with the breakfast chilaquiles and the classic double cheeseburger w waffle fries. The chilaquiles were tasty but nowhere near a traditional Mexican chilaquiles recipe. The sauce was a little more mild than I would like. There was lots of chicken and even some egg sprinkled on top along with cheese. They are served nacho style as well, which is not traditional. 
The burger was, in my opinion, wayyy better than the chilaquiles. The meat was flavorful and not dry, lots of tasty cheese. And the fries! Get the seasoned waffle fries!! I'd return here.

One thing I do have to say. I have never had outstanding or even great customer service. I think the servers here do need work on customer service. Since a lot of us locals do come in.

Park is great because there's 3 distinct areas that each have their own vibe... the front patio, where you can chill and people watch, and it's awesome if the weather is good.  Inside the bar it's just your run of the mill bar, but has it's own style of exposed wood and stuffed animals (not what you think).  And then out back is this huge backyard playground that if you wandered in off the street you'd never find.

It sits on the northeast corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd.  To me there are three different sections to Park on Fremont, the front patio, the inside, or the back patio.  

The front patio is perfect for people watching.  Especially at night when you see all the craziness happen on Fremont street.  The inside has tables and bars, it's your standard restaurant setting.  Then you have the back patio which has a more intimate setting.  The back patio also has a secret pathway in the far back left corner which when you walk around the corner is a seesaw.  That's also a designated smoking area.

Which area would I recommend?  I like the back patio, that's where I've met some random and cool people.  The front patio is also nice but I haven't been able to mingle with people as much as I do in the back patio.  The bar or inside Park on Fremont is your standard restaurant setting.  

I don't care much about the food.  If I was to eat here I'd get the reuben with tots.  But my coworkers after a long nights work love coming down here to have a beer or two.

It's a upscale feeling watering hole, manned (and womanned) by some of the nicest people we have met in Vegas as of yet. 

We grabbed a drink, I had a long island.. and it was delicious. They also brought us some ice water without being asked. 

On top of that little gesture.. they used their own phone (because we didn't have our own) to look up a number for us, and let us make a quick call to check to make sure things were still ok for us to pay a visit.

Brunch.

This is a great spot right in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas. There is a little (expensive) parking lot right next door as well. Cute modern/borderline hipster interior. They have a beautiful outdoor garden seating area in the back.

I ended up doing a BYOB with fries to absorb the remaining alcohol left in my system from the previous nights shenanigans. It was perfectly cooked, and delicious! and not just hungover delicious it was the kind of burger I would want regardless of how sober I was.

4054658,2013-03-31,6,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"Hooray!!  Another new restaurant in DTLV. 

Before I review this place, I need to apologize to the rest of our party for the service.  Yes, I admit that I was part of the reason why some of the people in our group didn't get 5 star service. Heck, I didn't even get 5 star service. But I did get what I thought was a very attentive server.  Carina was very nice, gave her recommendations on what I should eat & drink, and even chatted up a storm with me. One thing I've noticed about restaurants in Las Vegas, waitresses always like to chat and sometimes the conversations can get out control where service for everyone else suffers. While I got excellent service, the rest of our group didn't.  For that, I apologize to Terri R, Alicia R, Sugi, Toni R, and Merrick.  Won't happen again, I promise. 

As for the actual food, I thought it was pretty good and different.  The  items on the menu reminded me of a fusion type Hash House without the huge portions.  Prices for the food are about average to what you find off the strip, but cheap considering you're in tourist land.  I had their Fried Chicken and Waffles with Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  I thought that this was flavorful with a bacon after taste. Their Sweet Potato Tater Tots was something different and thought it was pretty good. I washed my meal down with water, the Unicorn, and some old school Olde English 800.  

Ambiance is a solid 4 stars, maybe a 5 during the weekdays.  We ate outside, which was great for people watching.  The only issue with eating outside is the smell coming out of the sewer.  My suggestion, try to eat inside if you can. It will be tighter, but at least you don't get that horrendous sewer stench.  For drinks, you can take advantage of their bar or backyard garden.  The drinks, or lack there of, was a problem.  Park on Fremont was not prepared for the amount of people for their first week that they ran out of a lot of drinks that were on their menu by 8 PM.  Hopefully, this gets fixed soon. 

Overall, I give this place 4 stars even with all the hiccups. I'm giving Park on Fremont a break mainly because this is just the first week they have been open.

As much as I love LV, I am always ecstatic when I find a new spot that makes me feel like I am in a different city. (Makes total sense, right?)  Came here for lunch during the soft opening.  Place was bumping at noon, but the hostess staff was very friendly and accommodating and found us a table in 10 minutes flat.  The beer list here is crazy long and has a lot of unique offerings.

Here's what we ordered for lunch:
Chicken Bites (5 stars! Awesome)
Drunken chicken (4 stars and how awesome that there is an option for those watching their calories)
Reuben (3 stars - this was some seriously briney corned beef.  Too much for me)

I agree with the assessment of fellow yelpers.  This is elevated bar food.  I did not expect much and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the grub.  You don't go here for the food though.  You go for the experience.  With that philosophy in mind, I returned on Saturday night to get the bar experience and try out that beer list (mmm banana bread beer).  This place is gorgeous.  Beautiful reclaimed wood, open-air bar, super chic interior and a patio and beer garden that are unbelievably cute.

Patio Pounder is my favorite, in large part because it comes with a whole bottle of champagne. Last time I was there, they said they changed the champagne from Mumms to...Martini Asti?! More like Martini Ass-i. Womp womp. 

My favorite healthy-ish thing on their menu is the steak salad - it's my regular lunch order, love it every time. Last time I was there, it was no longer on the menu. Strike two.

Finally, my favorite non-healthy thing on their menu is the garbage fries. Last time I was there, they were $18...?! I could swear they were always $10...maybe $12. But now $18?! Strike three, I am out of here.

Went on 11/6 with a friend to this restaurant. My friend said she had had the food here and recommended it. Before you walk in, you get attitude from the bouncer. He stared at my ID like it was fake, even flipped it around to check the back in a way that indicated that he didn't think it was real (I'm 24 and don't look underage). Also, ignored my friends request to just see her ID in the wallet.

We sit in the back patio area and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally I go to the bar and ask the bartender if there's a server that's supposed to come around or if we are supposed to order at the bar. 

Bartender: ""Did someone sit you down back there?""

Me: ""No we just sat down back there""

Bartender: ""Oh yeah, if you weren't seated then no server is going to come to you. We don't have servers just walking around""

Me: ""Can you please send someone out there for us?""

Bartender: ""Sure""

And you know how this ends. No one ever showed up. Plus, walking out, there's a sign that says, ""Please seat yourself."" So why the bartender thought anyone would sit us down is beyond me. I'm sure the food there is probably okay, but I'll never know.

The highlight of the establishment is the back courtyard with a fireplace and greenery that resembles something like a combination of the Secret Garden, meets Alice In Wonderland. Ample seating, a fireplace for when it gets a bit chilled out there. 

The service was good enough and most people were very cool.. but I wasn't overly stoked about the food or the food prices.

I wanted to order a girly drink like sangria but they don't make it, so I just ordered a burger + sweet tater tots and it wasn't that great. 

Also trying to have some sort of conversation was impossible because the noise level of this joint is extremely loud to say the least. I did like the music and decor but the food + noise makes it a negative for me to actually enjoy hanging here.

Overall I'd say that POF is a great joint to hook up with a friend or 2 over drinks at the bar for about 20 minutes but that's it.... or maybe hang out at the bar for as long as it takes to find an interesting person to leave to another joint with.

Also parking will cost you $20 and that's just too pricey unless you car pool and split the cost.

The hostesses at the front indicated there was absolutely no availability, and that all the tables were reserved.  She indicated I could come back at a reserved time. We came back 45 minutes later. When we re-arrived, shocking, it was still fairly empty with plenty of availability.  The first table offered to us was partially directly in the sun.  After some haggling, the hostess reluctantly offered us an inside table.  If you can get passed the initial lack of hostess service, you will enjoy yourself.  The food was great!! The drinks were even better!!!  The ambiance is unique eclectic; loved it! 3 stars because we almost walked away due to the feeling that we were not welcomed.

4211707,2018-02-26,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"As an update to my 1 star review, ""Paul S."" privately messaged me in response the same day, which I post the screenshot for your reading pleasure. I have to say, if this is an apology, it's the most spiteful one I've ever received. And if your job title for this establishment is ""Customer Service"" you may want to revisit the definition since you were generous enough to provide me the definition of RESERVATIONS in your response, which I will happily address hereto. 

Let's start with your alleged video and audio feed from the front patio. Your camera equipment must be some high tech stuff for sure. Does it project scenarios from your hostess's mind wherein she thought to say the word ""reservations"" out loud in order to deter me and my party from being seated? Or perhaps you were viewing a completely different video from a different day where a woman with the same number of people in her party, including 3 minors, had an impatient attitude after being told she would have to wait 15 minutes due to patrons with patio reservations? Either way, your review of the alleged video and audio of what happened is pure fiction.

No, I was not told it would be a 15 minute wait and that our party could be accommodated after customers with patio reservations were seated. No, your hostess never once uttered the word ""reservations"" at any point during our exchange. No, your hostess didn't ask anyone standing in that line waiting to get seated if they had ""reservations."" No, I did not react as you suggested, and I quote: ""...an attitude and impatience on your part because you were not immediately accommodated."" No, that did not happen, not even a little. I'm sure that sort of scenario has happened in the past and I'm sure it's going to happen in the future. But that did not happen on that day with me and my party of 9, who were patiently waiting for the restaurant to open and to be seated. I have 8 witnesses who can back me up on that versus your so-called front patio video and audio feed. 

Your hostess, by proxy of your manager, who I never spoke to, simply came back to me and stated: ""We cannot seat you."" Period. End of story. No further words, explanations, consolations, suggestions and/or insinuations using the word that you so aptly and condescendingly defined for me: RESERVATIONS. I don't blame this hostess for her dismissive attitude because apparently it's written in her job description and practiced as a matter of the culture within, rolling down from the top. I maintain that this place has a demographic it would prefer to cater to and that's fine. I missed the red velvet rope while standing in line waiting for the business to open so that we could be seated.      

I'm a native of this town and I've seen a lot of restaurants like this one come and go. I've worked in the restaurant business, I understand the concept of customer service and a place is only as good as its management's treatment of all of its customers, would-be and regulars. I wasn't asking for anything outrageous or being difficult to your staff. I asked for a couple of tables for us to sit and eat. Had you bothered to actually read my review, I am the one who suggested that my party of 9 could be split up, ultimately being a customer accommodating both a hostess and a manager who could not be bothered so early in the day. Your sardonic tone complete with false accusations of a non-existent scenario in response to my review, messaged to me rather than posted, shows an utter lack of concern or professionalism on your part. You would have done well enough to just not respond to me at all, ""Paul S.""",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,8,0,1,LrQLEvKmGiY-x_wAHnX1IQ

My husband and I dropped in literally when it opened at 11:00 and were promptly seated outdoors, the weather was beautiful!

SO GOOD!! Everything! The salad was super fresh and the mojito....OMG. I could have had 3 of those easily. But, I would have been a drunken mess if I did that. The Mac and Cheese balls hit the spot! It's served with cheese to dip in. Yum!

The interior is spacious and clean, with a cool array of art and collectibles to look at.  The outdoor seating area is far more popular, but I prefer indoors.  Based on this one visit, that's the best thing I can say about POF, aside from the friendly, efficient service.

The Monte Cristo was a hearty sandwich with generous ham and cheese between 2 grilled bread slices.  But it had absolutely NO flavor-  it wasn't cheesy, hammy, nor french toasty.  It only tasted like the grill it was cooked on.  If they had remembered to put powdered sugar on it the way the menu described, it might have been a bit tastier.  But it just went down without registering anything savory, sweet or otherwise.  

It's hard to find a Monte Cristo, so kudos to them for providing one.  It does silence the hunger for sure, but tastewise it was lacking.  So for now, it's Cheesecake Factory on Sundays for a decent Monte Cristo.  If I return to POF, I will simply try something else.",nYEO9i0y-4JD_zmDg4Km7A,1,0,3,8SAbHtZvha49n-FZwznJjw

Garbage fries are awesome seems like a odd combination with fries eggs  avocado and cheese but worth trying it.

Since we were in town celebrating our anniversary, I thought this would be a semi romantic spot to enjoy some good food, drinks and enjoy being in DTLV under the night sky! 

I made a reservation a week before we came into town, Sarah (I believe was her name) took all my information down and answered all my questions (most important: what time does the kitchen stop serving food? Her answer 1:00 am... SCORE)  I also mentioned that we were coming there to celebrate our anniversary to which she got an excited tone to her voice and said this is a great place to do that. I will put you outside in the back garden; I know you will love it! 

On the night we had our 10:00 pm reservation we were running behind taking our anniversary photos, I called in to see if we could move it to 11:00 pm. The manager answered and said that will not be a problem.

Parking is either on the street or in a parking lot, we opted for the street. We have not been to DTLV for a while and had no idea on the huge changes it has been undergoing. In addition, I must say DTLV you are starting to clean up really well. Instead of all weirdoes, there is more of a hipster meets college meets semi professional vibe going on in that area! 

We walked up and was greeted the by security who ID'd us. I told him we had a reservation and where should we go (total noob moment) he said that the manager could help us and on cue out, he walked. He asked if we would like to sit outside in front, inside at the bar or outside in the garden. I said the garden would be nice.  We were lead out to the back area, I fell in love with the hall leading out the back door chandeliers of all shapes, and sizes were hung up high!

Walking out into the garden area was beautiful, surreal, and cozy all rolled into one! It is a little vintage, a little Alice in wonderland/Mad Hatter tea party-ish.

We were seated at a smaller table, to which the manager apologized that the bigger tables were taken at the moment. It was not an issue at all to us. He said that the menus/drink menu were on the table and our waitress will be right with us. He wished us a Happy Anniversary too!

Our waitress Carina was super outgoing and friendly. She came by and took our drink orders. I was quite impressed as she was the only waitress that was serving everyone who was outside! 
Our drinks were delivered to our table as we took in more of our surroundings. Loved the neon lime green electric sign on the wall that said ""Fucking Beautiful."" High above us was a vintage-gothic Cinderella carriage complete with a chandelier inside! Various humorous paintings were hung around along with vintage statues. We were told before we left to check out the smoking area and the famous seesaw. Which we did after dinner, sadly we did not get to take a ride of the 'saw as there were already a couple of fun loving people who were waiting!

Our waitress came back and said she wanted to move us to a bigger table that opened up. She said she felt bad that we had this tiny table. So we moved across from where we were seated. 

She then asked if we were ready to order, which we were:

Had the Fried Chicken and waffles with fries on the side. I have no clue why some of these reviews complained that the food was mediocre or lacked any taste. Both Minh's and my dinner were tasty! FYI I fell in love with his tater tots (but I will leave that for him to review) my waffles were huge and fluffy with just enough syrup and powdered sugar to top it off! The fried chicken was cook to a golden brown and was tender and juicy on the inside! I was able to finish one part of the sandwich and was working on the second half when I started to realize I was getting full! 

During our meal, Carina made sure we were happy with our meal, she had our drinks refilled and brought out to us! 

After we were finished with our dinner, we were told that the restaurant had a surprise for us. A couple of moments later a waiter brought us this HUGE chocolate chip ice cream sandwich cookie! We were wished a Happy Anniversary by Carina and if we needed anything else to let her know.

The cookie was a little hard on top but the ice cream was delicious and made the bottom cookie soft and more enjoyable to eat! However, being we were already full it was hard to enjoy such a lovely and thoughtful gift! I had a couple of bites of everything before I tapped out for the night! 

Prices and quantity of food was not bad at all! A++++ to Carina and the night manager (who worked on 5/19) thank you so much guys for making our special night more enjoyable!

I was disappointed in the presentation of our drinks on my (first) outing here. Our cocktails and water were served in those cheap plastic cups, not the mason jars that I've seen in pictures and reviews. Do they only roll them out at a certain time or for certain people? The drinks themselves were not bad. We also had some overpriced-for-the-portion chips and salsa

Could use some better service. My drink did not come out with everyone else's. Thinking that the bartender was backed up, I waited. After my companions were 70% finished with their drinks, I asked our server to check. 5 minutes later she comes back with it, no explanation why my drink took so long. Also, our water was not refilled, despite seeing our server go around with a pitcher every so often. Not good in my eyes, as during my server days, I was taught to always offer/keep water filled when people are drinking for a long period.",GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w,2,0,2,xfRN6nfuBg0yyl9EX-Hiwg

Come for the atmosphere and the people watching, not the food and the service. 

Came here for lunch and had the option of sitting inside or outside. Inside was equally hot as the outside just not in the sun. Questionable as to whether there was any AC going. Hopefully this was an extremely eco friendly conscious decision by the owner. If so, approved! If not, come on!

Ordered a caesar salad and a burger. Burger came with two patties. My friend requested just one. Was told it wasn't an option. Really?! Just cook one less patty. Surely that saves you time and money. Really? Food had incredibly poor presentation and taste. I know a caesar salad doesn't need to be beautiful, but I've seen better. Crap, I've even MADE better. It was quite soggy as well. 

Sigh.

Did I talk to a manager? No. Because...where to start. If i need to tell your staff it's saving YOU time and money to make one less patty, it's not even worth voicing an opinion. We left with a patty still on the plate. What a waste. Sorry, cow.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,6,3,2,YSnlV2VsYTkvcMMhESbl6w

The entire experience was pretty much ruined by this and had I known the stench would continually waft over our party while we ate I definitely would have chosen a seat outside.

But ah! The name is ""Park"" on Fremont, and the incredibly tack-full back patio is what this place is also about of course! Unless you are attempting to eat while foul sewage is creeping into your nostrils. Unfortunately this aspect is one I flatly refuse to lure myself into again. If I go back to Park on Fremont I will sit at the bar and leave the stinky patio be.

Food - Veggie Sliders of BORINGNESS. First off the sliders have the right idea, fresh enough veggies, interesting combo, but there was ZERO taste. It was bland, bland, bland and it came with NO sauce. No sauce at all. Um, not even like some veganaise? I'm not a vegetarian, but these sounded/looked yummy. They need seasoning. Please, for the love of all the is good - season the food!

Drink - Drink menu is pretty darn cool. Beer selection is cool. Although I was brought out the *other* raspberry beer that was in stock, rather than the one I actually requested. None the less - delicious. And at $10, I thought yikes! But when I saw it was a Pint I knew I would not even need another drink. My friend had one of their Bloody Mary's, which I tasted and it was yummy. Mixed very well. I would go back to have one in the future.

Service - Eh. Although our waitress was nice our drinks took a decade to arrive. Although she said she was ""waiting on the bar"" a few times to us - I can't imagine what the crap the bar was doing - basically, not making our drinks. It was not busy. 

Ambiance - Again, sewage smell. Also, to begin with we were sat in the front of the restaurant on Fremont street and I wasn't thrilled. With the cars going by it just was not a nice place to dine. The inside was interesting, but the bar looked somewhat small. 

Return Factor - I am turned off from their food, but I am intrigued with the drink menu and the drinks are what got the extra star for this review, or else it would have been a 2-star.

The playful and eclectic decor provides a fun environment in which to enjoy some slightly upscale and/or creative bar food. The happy hour deals are great. Many of the appetizers are $5 during happy hour and are still full portions and many of the draft beers are $5 as well which includes a very decent selection of quality craft brews. 

We tried:

Fried Pickles - Very good, crispy, well-seasoned and served with a very flavorful sauce for dipping. 

Garbage Fries - I'm not usually a fan of smothered fries. I like my fries crispy and salty, that's it. But these were great. They still managed to maintain their crispiness and the cheese and toppings were actually very flavorful and delicious. 

Mac and Cheese Balls - Our server said this was her favorite but we weren't bowled over by it. Ultimately we just thought they were bland. 

Chicken Bar Bites - Basically boneless wings served with 3 sauces and french fries. Not bad, but not great. Their fries are excellent though. 

We had one slightly odd complaint. The restaurant smelled like fish, and not in a good way. My wife and I could both smell it, and I have a pretty lousy sense of smell. We asked the person at the table next to us and they could smell it too. Our sever suggested that it may be the sewer lines on Fremont (the entire front of the restaurant is open to the outside) but we didn't smell anything outside, just inside.

Third, we told our server, skinny girl with long black hair and purple on top that our parking meter was about to run out so we needed our check. She walked past us again a few minutes later with no check, said nothing, and then another couple of minutes later we see her seating a party of twenty and taking all of their drink orders! Get out of here!! I had to leave the table and go pull the car out while my boyfriend waited for our check another 10 minutes. UNREAL!

Facility: this is a very eclectic, quirky, fun bar.  The artwork is weird, but makes for a great conversation piece every time I come. There is outside seating in front of the bar, in case you want to people watch everyone on Fremont. There is bar seating directly inside and even a few booths.  Out back there is an amazing private garden, and this is my favorite spot.  It has greenery, cool art, and a fireplace. There is even a small smoking area behind it with a working heavy duty see saw for grown ups. 
We sat out here, because it was a pretty nice evening, but for those that had a chill, they even had those portable heaters that look like a light pole to move to your table. 

Service:  most of the time I have great service here.  With our big group last night, there was one waiter that was a little pushy about clearing the plates. I appreciate someone asking ""Is there anything I can take?"", but he kept specifically asking for each plate on the table, ""can I take this?"", then on to the next one, ""Can I take this?"" 
When people are talking and drinking, they tend to pick, so just leave the food. He even went so far as to say in response to someone saying, ""Is there still some in there"", as he was removing it...""It's cold, are you going to eat it like that?"" 
Well, not after you called it out at the whole table like that!
Anyway, besides that guy, the staff is courteous, helpful and attentive. 

Food and drinks:  they have this yummy grapefruit beer I get every time I go. I started out drinking the $1 beers on special last night, but be warned, they are only 7oz mini bottle beers. They are so cute though. They said they ran out of Dos XX, so they served Sol instead. Then they ran out of Sol and they magically had Dos XX again. LOL! 
Anyway, I ended up switching back to my grapefruit after a while. 
We ordered the $2 tacos, which were small, but pretty tasty, especially after I ordered some jalapeños to top them off with. 
Then we ordered a mix of appetizers from the happy hour, such as garbage fries, fried pickles and Mac and cheese balls. All of them were good bar food. The garbage fries are really good with a bunch of topping such as cheese, fresh jalapeños, avocado, bacon, and a sunny side up egg on top. Yum!

Overall:  I love this bar. Between the cool atmosphere, good bar food, and grapefruit beer, I will continue to come back.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,0,0,5,lR_qn-4Rj8iL3XT-sxRrpg

We all shared an order of garbage Fries - although we requested sweet potato tots in place of fries. I'm amazed they didn't do any kind of up-charge for the switch! Awesome. I feel like I didn't see quite as much bacon as I'd like, but there was plenty of jalapeños and lots of their delicious cheese sauce!

The burgers are build your own with all the basic toppings you could want. Hubby made his own while dad and I created one to share. We did a beef patty topped with bacon, a fried egg, bleu crumbles and avocado. It ended up being a decent burger - not life-changing, just fine. But I quite enjoyed the side of regular Tots we ordered with it! They were nice and crispy on the outside and we're seasoned well. 

I would definitely go back for another happy hour and get those garbage tots! But maybe next time I'd try another happy hour item - Tacos perhaps?",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,14,13,4,x7mxTm2_i5xYrQJFn_6fDw

Being a pickle lover I thought I would enjoy the fried pickles but I didn't really care for them too much. The batter wasn't too flavorful and the pickles tasted more like cucumbers to me.

Garbage Fries ($8) are made with their housemade fries, melted cheddar and provolone cheeses, bacon, fresh jalapeño, green onion, tomato, chipotle pepper, avocado, and a fried egg. It's so bad, but it's so good. I would absolutely order this again! I would love to try their housemade fries plain as well - not on the menu, but I'm sure they'd serve it.

We had fabulous service once again. He was very cool and checked on us appropriately. Also, he split our checks (there were three of us) without us having to ask! What a brilliant man!

It has such a trendy vibe inside, full bar, and small dining area. But if you go outside, the feel of the vibe completly changes. Its more of a romantic backyard setting with umbrellas and if you peek over the wall by the fire place, there even  a small hangout area with a teeter totter.

The food was great. Huge portions too. I had ordered the chicken fingers from the appetizer section and it had about 6 fingers with french fries, that itself had me full. Usually you can choose what sauce you want it tossed in, but i asked for the buffalo on the side, and it also came with a side of ranch and ketchup. My friend ordered a burger which was massive and delicious. I wouldn't of been able to finish it.

4831276,2013-05-06,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"A GREAT addition to downtown. I like it for a lunch spot during the work week and a drink spot any other time. Service is a bit slow, so if you plan on doing a work lunch here, order drinks and food a the same time and go ahead and ask for the check when the food is served. The food is tasty and the salads are perfectly portioned to fill you up. I really like the strawberry chicken salad and the sweet potato tater tots. 

I absolutely love the decor, it is perfectly my style - antique yet contemporary and little unsettling (some of the photography is actually kind of creepy). There is plenty of seating out doors in the front, inside, and out doors in the back. The chairs aren't the most comfortable, but sometimes sacrificing comfort for style is necessary. 

They have an impressive selection of beers and I'm amused by the way they are broken up on the menu. Listed under ""High School Hangover"" you'll see selections such as Coors and Bud Light. ""High School Hangover"" is a very accurate title. Under ""The Graduate"" you'll see craft beers such as Dogfish Head. I'm excited that my taste in beers is listed under ""The Graduate"" title.

The food isn't that special. At least it's not super expensive. The drinks are pretty good, fond of the beermosa and grapefruit beer. Mimosa brunch is kind of a joke, but I come from LA where mimosa brunch is a dime a dozen. I don't get how mimosa brunching is not a thing in Vegas...? They fill a 6 oz mason jar about halfway with your mimosa and our server took her sweet ass time coming back refills. What happened to leaving the carafe of OJ and the bottle of champagne on the table? We flagged down 3 different servers to grab us our 5th refill (prob the equivalent of our 2nd glass) and when our actual server came back she was like oh they already brought them! And we said we would gladly take the second one! (since y'all were sleepin on it). And this mimosa brunch is crazy expensive too, $20 for bottomless? I haven't found anything in Vegas cheaper than $15 for bottomless - out of control. 

Those 3 stars represent decor and the fact there are 2 outside patios. I also kinda like how the inside is just essentially big hallway (with tables and a bar) that you walk through. There aren't really doors. Lame to like, but true. Everyone loves the back patio, and the see-saw.

4895908,2015-08-23,1,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"I went here for brunch about a month ago and I really enjoyed it.

The only downside (why I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5) was it says it opens at 11am and a crowd of people were waiting to get in and they opened around 10-15 minutes late. If you open at 11am then you should be ready to take customers at 11am. If you aren't ready at the correct time then change your hours. 

I think the thing I enjoyed the most was the prices of the cocktails. I feel a lot of other restaurants downtown charge so much for a drink ($14-$18) while Park charged around $18 for a pitcher of their sangria or mimosas. 

We decided to first order a pitcher of sangria. There was three of us and we all got around 2 drinks per person. 

We then decided to switch it up to mimosas. For this they bring a crate of orange juice and a whole bottle of champagne which is cooled in what looks like a summer lunch bag. I feel for what we paid it was a great deal. We ended up leaving some of the champagne because we all had to drive shortly thereafter. It also made us very sleepy. 

For my entree I decided to get the Chilaquiles which were very yummy and I finished them in no time.

We all also want to try the French toast so instead of ordering that as an entree we all decided to get it as dessert. I'm love doing this at restaurants so then you order something that fills you up and something that is a little sweet. The french toast was good and was a great end to your meal.

If you decide to come here for brunch I suggest coming here right at 11am when it opens or have reservations. It is small and the space fills quickly. There also aren't a lot of tables inside and on a hot summer day you do not want to be outside if you do not have to be.",eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,1,1,4,u75WKMOJvl0RdFMZFHMfVA

As my friends and I got to the front of the bar, we were greeted by this friendly white girl in the front who was more than happy to give us pointers on what to order. She sat us back in patio seating and I noticed how unique the vibe was because of the decor of the restaurant. 

""The Vibe""-Honestly it felt like I was walking through a scene of a cool beer commercial as we were walking down the hallway to the patio. clean, bugged out, and a hint of sexy. 

""The Service"" - After they cleared out our table/bench, it took a few minutes for me to flag down a server, but I guess that was cool because it took a while for us to figure out what exactly we wanted to. When she came, she was super cool and gave us great recommendations for our food. Got to give it up to Corina...she was dope. 

""The Food"" - We ordered our drinks first and little did I know that my friend was on a mission to find ""Banana Bread Beer!"" supposedly its pretty rare to find but hella good.  So that was a huge plus for me and my friend.The hostess told me to order ""the Philly Mac and Cheesesteak sandwich"" and the sweet potato tots, I did not disappoint .

My friends and I all decided to share food, my homegirl decided to order the Chicken waffle sandwich which was also really good, and my other friend ordered the veggie sliders. All the food had a great flavor. It was super hard to make a decision here , because I also wanted to try their burgers.

Sought out the opinion of a friend who lives in Vegas for a place near Old Las Vegas where the 10 of us girls could go to dinner, while wearing our Bachelorette party tank tops and shorts and not break the bank. He suggested Park on Fremont and I took his word for it. Called first to see if they could accommodate 10 of us last minute and they said yes for the outside patio only. After walking in, there were a few tables scattered about inside, we checked out their outside and it wasn't for us, plus with the heat we wanted some air conditioning before heading back out into the desert dry heat. Our server told us she could see part of our group and as more tables got up, we could eventually all sit together. We were starving so we went with that option. Four of us sat down at a table and ordered some food to pick on so that our friends who weren't seated yet could come over and nibble what we had ordered too. Lots of fried stuff, which was unfortunate because after all of the booze we were drinking all weekend, it would have been nice to see some healthy food but anyways!

We got the crispy brussels sprouts, lots of oil but definitely delicious, sweet potato tater tots, also delicious. We got fried pickles, this intense plate of waffles fries, bacon and everything else unhealthy, mac and cheese balls. Fried junk basically, they call it comfort food for a reason. For the meal I went with the free bird, which was a turkey burger topped with some guacamole and arugula. I didn't love it, the flavor was a little off for me, but then again rarely do I find restaurants to do a turkey burger right. The annoyance came in when the bill was dropped. The server let the bride pay and that's just a no no. Clearly, she's in a veil, the only chick wearing white, maybe ask one of the bridesmaids first before letting her pay. The other girls didn't love the place, again we weren't looking for a fried food spread, maybe you'll love it though. Cool interior.",OT-0VdNkBh0HOQm1apHGNw,3,2,3,EV5SF0NXYGgpLtpHBcB--A

4956503,2014-07-23,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"First off, the food and atmosphere here is pretty darn good. I live in the area, so it's a nice place to bike over to and grab lunch. The patios are beautiful, amd the inside is comfortable. I love the San Diego Burger, and the Tacos are pretty good for a plqce that doesn't specialize in tacos.

I'm writing this particular review to talk about the service. When Park on Ftemont first opened, I had a number of great dining experoences, but recently the service here has been, for the most part, mediocre if not outright nonexistent. 

In most cases it was simply that the servers had unenthusiastic attitudes, no smiles, and an apparent overall distaste for having to be at work that day. A number of the times the service was slow, and it was hard to get the servers attention without them seeming annoyed. 

I understand that this is a pretty high traffic place in the evenings, and none of this is normally bad enough to mention. I mention it now because of the problem I had with the hostess the other day.

I was planning on going to take part in Taco Tuesday with some girlfriends, but I was interested in bringing my sister who was not yet 21. I called ahead to see at what time they stopped searing minors. Since I had been there before with my sister, and had even eaten inside, I thought I had heard the girl on the phone say she could seat minors on the patio after six. When we arrived I told her we had minors in our party and asked if we could sit on the patio. She abruptly and demeaningly informed my party that minors were not allowed here after six. When I began to explain I had called someone earlier, she broke in before I could even finish to say ""that was me, and I can't seat you."" Taken aback, I turned around to walk out with my group. As we left, she mumbled ""Have a nice day."" All as she sipped on what looked like some sort of mojito based on the color and the muddled mint in the drink.

I was aware that I may have misheard what she had said on the phone, but the fact that she was so unapologetic and just plain mean made me never want to go back.

I'm sure I'll get over it eventually because like I said, the food is good, but I'm not a fan of the ""exclusive, you're-not-worth-our-time, cool-kids only"" vibe the employees have been giving me. It makes me want to go there, and take new people with me, a lot less.",0hhHCu9bAZbBwLga1HSYcA,0,0,2,imrULgwXlMxWdazXHa5vsw

4981588,2014-11-09,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"It seems like Park on Fremont is the place to be when other places are wall-to-wall filled on days like First Friday or perhaps any other weekend. This is the spot to resort to when you're trying to escape from the loud thumping music or the obnoxious young ""I wanna get drunk!"" crowd Downtown tends to attract with their newest attractions. (God I sound old when I said that)

Park is low-key. You can actually enjoy cocktails (I advise you to try a Bloody Mary) or the usual call drinks and beers while being able to conversate with your friends no matter where you're at. Whether you're in the front lawn people watching or in the back cozying up next to the fireplace or on the see-saw, Park definitely recreates a different setting in comparison to the other bars on Fremont Street. I LOVE AND PREFER IT, especially when you're actually trying to catch up with your friends while being hungry at the same time.

And yes, this place offers food! I've had a couple things off their menu and everything is mediocre at it's finest but very good at the moment when you're trying to sober up. I wouldn't ever come here just for the food (in my opinion) but this is the place I'd choose to be Downtown if my friends left it up to me.

I'm starting to assume Park is never as crowded as the other places due to the prices but hey, I wouldn't mind spending an extra buck or two keeping my sanity than to fight over a place to stand avoiding my drink to be spilled due to some intoxicated bimbo trying hard to seem sober while navigating to the bathroom every hour. And you know how they say ""You are who you surround yourself with""? Well Park is definitely my kind of the socializing in a sophisticated yet fun manner crowd. 

PS: Four stars for the lack of service since it's not as attentive as a service establishment should be and more of a ""let me take your order and dip"" without checking back to see if we want another round which steers us to overcrowd the bar instead. I hate to be that person that does that but when your server is close to nonexistent then you're left with no other choice. Sorry.",P49ulSRSHLNnIP-efK-qhw,1,1,4,5XDo-wEZz9SzPjkNM0MTAQ

Awesome deals: $1 Coronitas and $2 tacos.  You think the waiters would be walking around with buckets of beers because, obviously, people are going to order a shit-ton of them at a time.  No.  Of course not.  My friend and I ordered four total.  And about 20 minutes later, we got two ... then 20 minutes after that, we got our other two.  Don't forget about the 30 minute wait for our three tacos which should be being made at lightning speed since that's probably the only thing being ordered there on Tuesdays.  
Also, the beer taps are really high so hiring petite girls as bartenders probably isn't the wisest decision because all you'll get is foam from the 5 foot long beer pour.",Xl8DWmA8eaE7ygCGPfz8sQ,1,2,3,HV_6XXmEQOynGxoUMXxn_Q

5027874,2013-04-03,2,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"A lot of great, but also some not so great.

First, the great.  Location and atmosphere are fantastic.  Nice setup.  It reminds me of downtown where I am from so I had a particularly home like feeling being there.  The music was also on point.  Overall a great feel here.

The shooter made with Absinthe is by far the best drink made with Absinthe that I have ever had.  A very difficult feat, because as a main ingredient absinthe is hard to make tasty.  Absinthe, despite all its hype, tastes like ass.  This shooter however did not.  I believe it was called the Funderwear.  I could do more of these, and they could be dangerous.

Also the shot/beer combos available are a nice touch, and something I will be coming back specifically for.

The beer list itself, needs to be reformatted.  There is no organization to it at all.  

The specialty cocktails were decent, but a bit lacking in complexity, and a touch on the sweet side.  They weren't bad, but they also didn't jump out as very memorable. 

Then there is the bad.  The Veggie sliders are a complete disaster of a dish.  I am curious if the people making them have ever actually eaten them.  Sliders 101: ALWAYS TOAST THE BUNS.  Serving sliders on untoasted buns is culinary blasphemy.  The patties weren't cooked very well, and overall they had a slapped together feel to them.  The tots that accompanied were added insult to injury.  They taste as if they are either dusted with confection sugar, or semi-battered with funnel cake batter.  Applause for the shot at uniqueness, but simply a sad moment for anyone who enjoys tots.  I have NEVER not eaten all of my tots before.  I am a fatty when it comes to tater tots.  I will devour villages and small cities worth of tater tots.  Generations upon generations of tots have been simply wiped out by me.  I couldn't muster the will to eat more than 5 of these and all 5 were eaten somewhat forcibly.  My natural instinct to love tots was thrown into a distraught mess of confusion.

Tater tots should be crispy and crunchy on the out side, and warm and plentiful with hot fried potato goodness on the inside with a touch of salt.  You want to get crazy, add a spice to them(Cajun maybe?), or a unique sauce on the side.  For the sake of all that is delicious, ditch the funnel cake version, please.

This was the only dish we had, but I have heard similar criticisms from foodie friends of mine about many of the dishes here.  Just because you are downtown doesn't mean you can slack on your food.  You are in downtown Vegas, one of the biggest food epicenters of the US.  Your biggest target market is locals, and the locals in Vegas are foodies for the most part.  We will wait for food, and we will pay for food, but it needs to deliver.  You have such a great location for what you are offering, take advantage of it.

The servers were very friendly and engaging, as well as the hostesses.  Whoever did the hiring of the FOH staff made solid choices.  Very refreshing after eating at some places with impersonal and seemingly unconscious staff lately.

I do hope the food improves, because I really enjoy the vibe here and that location is in need of a great spot to eat at.",Ae6FP-TugnU03AP6PyLyNg,5,1,3,3ckx7cQy2UGuUklC50L3YQ

Although there are breakfast spots I know are fantastic in Vegas, Park was just a short walk from my hotel and my time was limited. I sat at the bar and ordered the Monte Cristo. First, it took FOREVER for my ""food"" to come out. The bartender noticed that I had been waiting 15+ minutes for a sandwich and nudged someone to find out what was going on with my order. When it finally came out.. It. Was. Terrible. It was dry and kind of burnt. The turkey on the inside was extremely dry. The taste overall made me a bit nauseous - it was that bad. Rather than order a new one (and wait another 15-20 minutes) I simply paid and left my unfinished sandwich.

When you arrive, the building has an exposed, dark, weathered wood look to it.  There's outside seating in the front of the restaurant, a few high top tables and bar area inside and a lot more table seating in the back garden.  It's definitely a great concept and once the misters are working, the back section will be great for the hot summer coming up!  The staff are always super nice and friendly.  I love the uniforms:  chambray tops and red TOMS for the girls and nice bow ties and other dapper accents for the guys.  Super trendy.  Every time I hang out there, I end up getting a lot of stuff and having a lot of questions.  The staff are all very patient which I appreciate.

For Drinks:  They have A LOT of beers.  A LOT!  I love the options.  You have the regular Coors lights, Coronas and Guinnesses.  They also have other eclectic options like the banana bread beer and my favorite, the grapefruit beer!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)  The prices range from $5-$10 depending on the beer.  I also highly recommend the Unicorn, a mixed drink that includes a lot of Ginger.  Ginger beer!  Finally, my other favorite option is the pick a beer and shot for $10.  It's a list of about 5 beers and 5 shots.  I usually get the Guinness and Fireball Whiskey shot with this deal.  

For Food:  The Bar Bites for $8 is AH-MAZE-ING!  Corn flake crusted chicken tenders over fries or tater tots.  Then there's the sweet potato tots!  OMG, they serve it with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  You can also ask for a sriracha ketchup but please be advised:  NO ranch or regular ketchup is offered at all!  I also love the chicken and waffle sandwich for $10.  The chicken is crusted with Capt 'n Crunch, between waffles and drizzled with Wild Turkey maple syrup.  Also served with either fries or tots.  The popular and only sides are the fries, tots or potato salad for $4 each.  The potato salad is creamy and full of soft potato chunks.  

As you can see from my review, I've visited this place enough to know a few great meals.  I definitely invite you to check this place out.  It's the first business welcoming you into Fremont East.  It'll not only show you how great downtown is transforming into, but it'll also show you how wonderful this place really is.  Check them out :)",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,1,5,057LcdLaVsO5m8dEJsPdpg

Ended up here on the default it was a beautiful evening to be outside, and most bars nearby don't serve food. 

We sat in the front picket fence patio which is good if you want to people watch the coming and goings of Fremont. 

With drinks you can get a sampler of 4 mix and match drinks (signature cocktails or draft beers) for $20 which is not bad for a anytime of the day deal. Out of the drinks we tried the Wombat on Bathsalts was the better of them. One of my drinks, Pillow Talk, basically tasted like soda water. 

I ordered fried pickle to munch on. This was actually pretty good and I liked the banana peppers were also battered and fried. It had decent seasoning and went well with the ranch. The portion though was measly though. I let a few people take a pickle and I had 3 bites. 

The BF got a burger and it was not medium as requested but well done, no pink at all. It was also very dry and it didnt help that it needed a sauce. The sweet potato tots were not crispy enough, it barely had any crunch on the outside. 

My brother in laws food was greasy and the garbage fries were really salty.

Service was okay. She was busy doing a full patio herself so times she wasn't around to flag I saw her running around for other tables so I can't blame her for it. 

It's a A-OK place. I wish we got a table in the back garden so it would be nice garden ambiance, but the front porch wasn't a bad spot. The tall stools weren't so comfy to sit on though so try to sit on the tables and not the back tall table if possible.

I have been wanting to come here since it opened and finally had the chance to stop in Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly and gave us our choice of seating. We chose the backyard garden as I heard it smells of nagchampa, which I could definitely get behind. The decor is very original, if not a bit, 'hipster', but delightfully so. Think Vice magazine in restaurant form. Having already eaten, we opted for the very clever drink menu. I started with the Unicorn, which was delicious. We sat and nursed our drinks for a couple hours without being rushed or hurried to clear the table even after business picked up around 10:30. I ordered a second drink and shortly after receiving it, asked our server if they could hold the table for five minutes so that we could hop into the back-backyard to smoke. She said that'd be fine so we went and played on the teeter totter (yes, the teeter totter) for a few minutes. When we returned my almost-full second drink as well as our other beverages had been completely cleared and the table was reset for new service. We continued to sit and chat while waiting for our check to come. Our server walked by a few times and hesitated, noticing our table was completely cleared. She didn't comment on this and went about her business, serving up many rounds of shots and drinks to a nearby table. Finally, upon receiving our check, we waited another 20 minutes before we could get her back to the table. I explained to her that I didn't get to enjoy my second drink as the table was cleared while we were out back. Without hesitation she apologized and had it removed from our bill. Though, I was happy with the location, atmosphere and drink selection, I was disappointed in the service. There were a lot of people there, but a lot of them seemed to be standing around bored as one or two were running in circles. I will come back to try the food as I have heard amazing things, but we'll make sure to take turns smoking to ensure our table remains ours.",XBxmubKfzh3pkDHry6kskw,2,1,3,oTnCUrUbwQfybl74ld1eiQ

The decor is warm. Distressed wood is the framework surrounding the copper lined bar. There is seating for the bar that is both indoor as well as outdoor. The front of the space has a minimal patio that is facing the front entrance as well as the small part of the side facing the lot. It's white picket fence that frames the patio seperates you from the fact that you're literally  part of the street and lot. The floor wood pattern layout is stunning.

There are black and white sketches of animals/skeletal that add to the setting of the space. The indoor seating is all banquet with booth tables that are suitable for large groups. The seats are upholstered with fun patterns in different colors that add to the charm of the place. The staff uniforms were hipster chic and alleviated any concerns of haughtiness you may have. Maybe because it was Easter Sunday a few of the servers looked more bored rather then being engaging. Hopefully these are just opening weekend kinks that need to be smoothed out.

And now the highlight...The secret garden. There is a lovely beer garden laced with flowers and charming metal garden furniture. It is peaceful and isolated in the back of the space. Its a perfect spot for a small gathering. They even have a minature bar that could be set up for exclusive use of the back space.

Definitely worth a visit. Great spot to hang with friends and sample their many varieties of beers and cocktails. I loved that they had a unique takes on the bloody mary. They claimed to be out of a few beers because of their opening weekend so I hope that problem won't be ongoing. Mason jars of all sizes for beverage service too.

The only reason I deducted a star was because the steak mac & cheese came on a bun. It was carb overkill and took away from that deliciousness of the ingredients. We also tried the chicken bar bites and I say kudos for the crunch, flavor and crispness of the snack sized treat.

I wonder if the proprietors took notes from the ever successful neighborhood bars in the LES & Brooklyn, NYC.

A friend arrived before we did and got our table. Ordered 3 waters for the table so we would have water when we arrived. Waitress brought 1 water. We arrived and waited a good 7-8 minutes for the server to come take our drink/food order. Drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive (not kidding). I hate, hate, hate waiting on service especially when the server doesn't acknowledge the wait. I was very ready to walk off but was looking forward to trying the food and my options were limited at that point with the amount of time I had before I had to go to work.

Ordered the fried chicken and waffle sandwich... it was really good. Both were cooked just the way I like it and I would absolutely order again. Sweet potato tots were as good as expected... I find I never really can complain about anything sweet potato.

Blue Moon in a can.... didn't offer me a glass or an orange slice. Defeats the purpose of a blue moon to me.

The cinnamon was a surprise when we first bit into it but it was a good one! I forgot our waiters name but she was great; very attentive and she always came back to check up on us. They have some really good drinks and they come in mason jars!! The restaurant is a nice little hipster shack with a nice vibe.

The second time I went I had the chicken bites which weren't as good. The chicken was tough and stringy and the corn flake batter wasn't a good texture. I would still go back  but I would try something else. 

Atmosphere: Very fun and interesting. They have a lot of artwork and pieces that are a great topic of conversation. It could be thought of as a little creepy. Behind the bar, directly in front of seating is a wall filled with taxidermy birds which really freaked me out since I am scared of birds. Even though, I love their food so I try to look down or at my lunch companions. 

I also know that there is an outdoor area which I heard was great at night but I haven't made my way back there yet.

My sandwich arrived promptly and to no surprise was actually quite delicious. Was it the best Philly in town? By no means, but it was a creative take on a classic and it was real good!

I have been here twice, and the reason for my second visit honestly wasn't because I just had to have some fabulous dish again, it was because my pals that live downtown were hanging out on the patio, and I was jealous. I knew I was probably going to miss something (like Tony Hsieh delivering happiness in person or a Jesus Jam Band on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd) if I didn't go. So, I went, and therefore, did not miss either of those things, both of which actually happened. 

The patio offering at Park On Fremont is without doubt in a class of luxury. You can sit out front and watch Fremont Street in all its glory, or you can head out back and go for the Secret Garden experience. Both options have their time and their place. Try both. 

As for the drink offerings, I am excited to see they offer variations of the Bloody Mary! Granted, I haven't tried them, but I think it's an art form we don't have enough of in Vegas. They also have a nice beer list, but mostly in cans/bottles, and on my first visit, they didn't have 30% of the list. I think it was because they were still in soft opening mode, so I won't hold it against them. 

As for the food, it is a bit underwhelming. Portion sizes are small, and although the menu is a list of delicious potential, dishes are just a little bit less than you hoped for in size and presentation. Everything I have tried tastes good, and I do appreciate that they have a variety of options, including vegetarian, and just the fact that they have food!

So, I don't think I would go here with a starved foodie (at least not yet), but for a night downtown, it's definitely the happening spot to get your drink and patio on.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,32,16,4,VYDGiicx0g6vGHCOVDRosw

The food was tasty, saving this experience. I had the Philly cheese steak and a friend had the sliders which were good as well. The drinks were tasty, but I don't know if they are 10 dollar craft cocktail tasty. After we were done eating , the waitress apologizes and gives us 2 of the 5$ special drinks for the trouble.

The hostess convinced us to eat at the outdoor patio right next to a space heater since indoor seating was full. Too bad the space heater died out about 10 minutes after we sat down. Woman! Don't promise me heat, only to leave me in the bitter cold moments after I get comfortable at my table! The table next to us requested the heater be turned back on all but 3 times. The runner was in charge of this duty, but was struggling to keep up with Taco Tuesday night. He eventually got to the heater, but we were finishing up our meals by the time we were warm and toasty again. 

$2 STREET TACOS: My husband said the tacos were ""perfect"". The tacos were topped with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. I asked if they could make vegetarian tacos, but no such luck. :(  

GARBAGE FRIES ($5 during Happy Hour): The fries were good until they weren't. Have you ever ate something that started out good, but then blew out by the end of the meal? That's what happened to me. 

$1 DOS EQUIS: These bottles are cute. They're practically made for infants. I laughed out loud when I poured a bottle into the plastic cup the restaurant provided - it barely filled a quarter of the cup! I say, False Advertisement! They should have ""Tiny"" written in next to their $1 Dos Equis menu. 

SERVICE: The waitress and the runner were doing their best to keep up. My husband got his street tacos before we received our beers. There seemed to be a lot of confusion on which tables ordered what. Maybe it's because we were sitting outside? 

ATMOSPHERE: There was a combination of younger and older people here. Our table on the patio was tucked away behind some greenery, so we were afforded some privacy. The music was decent, until it cut off into awkward silence. Turn the music back on peeps! 

Return Visit? Yes, but not on Taco Tuesday. Their selection for vegetarians is quite small, but I'd like to try their Veggie burger ($10) next time. If the veggie burger fails me, then nope, not coming back.

Located on the corner of trendy East Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard, with raves received from hipsters since its inception, it was just minutes before noon that I sat down with a friend for lunch at Park on Fremont and although I'm happy to say the service far outperformed similar spots in Chicago, Brooklyn, or Portland the food itself left much to be desired - a seemingly well-culled menu instead proving limited in not only options but quality of execution, as well.  Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and décor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux-taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found.  Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'

Not exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,1,2,nQsBeuR3uKRjqxs4fbKKsg

We were really hungry and decided to drop by here to order to-go to bring back to our hotel. The place is on Fremont street slightly away from the madness. The decor of the place is very rustic and charming, and definitely has a welcoming environment to it. 
Workers seem to look more on the hipster side but the service was great! Right upon sitting in a booth, a waiter immediately came up to us asking if we needed help. After ordering to-go, the waiter even gave us waters while we waited for our food to come out which I thought was very considerate. 

The menu is very simple, but I think that helps them focus on the quality of their food. We went ahead and settled for Buffalo wings and sweet potato tater tots, and both were delicious!! The buffalo wings were very crispy even though it was packed in a sealed container. The sweet potato fries kind of reminded me of waffles because they blended this syrup into it which made it unique from your average sweet potato fries! It has immediately become a favorite of mine! 

If you're looking for some reasonably priced food and a great place to grab drinks with friends, Park On Fremont might just be the go to spot.  I would definitely next time try this place with friends for a casual night out.",Rzs4pdzUSIh8fmhQENY15A,0,0,4,dGuYg7KmxguHOrl6ee-UbQ

Food is OK. Not much to choose from so we just got a couple ""pickins"" but they were decently portioned so eating for $16 for 2 people ain't bad. Next time I will try a burger or sandwich. 

Good beer list. I got the grapefruit beer at my friend's suggestion. Yum! Drinks are overpriced. Like for REAL. $8 for a PBR tallboy? AND the bartender scoffed at my ordering it? You better lower the price if you're going to judge me. Lol. 

Decor is decidedly hipster; taxidermy animals arranged in sexual positions? A painting of two horses fu*king? Ha! Ok.

The crowd is great if you don't mind hipsters. Plaid shirts, boots, full-sleeve tats and beards...with music you probably have never heard of playing in the background. There's a song that was so not mainstream, Shazam doesn't even know what it is. Is the food from a local source? IDK. Does it have bacon? Yes. Do you drink from mason jars? Yes. Do you have doughnuts? Yes.

Bacon-Wrapped Corn Dogs:
The more I tell myself I'm going to eat healthy food, the more I rebel. I like to wrap my arms around my legs in yoga and my corn dogs wrapped around with bacon. You get 2 big corn dogs served with Sriracha ketchup and a spicy mustard. The bacon is wrapped around the hotdog then dipped in batter - part of bacon enjoyment is the crispy salty goodness but you won't get that with this. 3/5

Philly Mac and Cheese Steak:
This cheesesteak was actually good but there was just too much bread, not enough meat. Carbo-loading? This is for you. 3.5/5

Stranger Danger:
Peach vodka and iced tea. If you like peach-flavored anything then, you might like this drink. I don't.

Trophy Wife:
Rum, OJ, pineapple juice, lemon, simple syrup and bitters. This was pretty refreshing. Fruity and delicious.

They do have salads. Looking back, they do have delicious-sounding salads like Strawberry Summer Salad, Steak Salad, Ahi Tuna Salad, etc. But on my last night of drinking, I wanted to get something with more substance. On the menu, right below salads: deep-fried Oreo and Girl Scout Cookies, and Donut Ice Cream Sandwich!

If you don't like scary movies, stay away from the bathroom or you'll piss your pants.

5322919,2013-09-06,2,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"Park on Fremont is legit. 

1. Ambience 
Located almost on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Fremont, with a large outdoor patio with tables and a few bar stools. There is an outdoor park area (with a hidden see-saw), that lights up at night. The place is filled with unique art and is very kitschy-hipster chi? (a deer head with machine gun antlers). It has a very modern, artsy feel. 

2. Alcohol/Drink
Booze isn't my forte. I'm not much of a drinker, but they have a ton of microbrews and specialty handcrafted beers (Banana Bread Beer), a lot of which are on tap.They also have microbrew sodas available as well. They have a slew of Bloody Marys with several kitchy names as well as signature cocktails.

3. Food
My sister and I got to enjoy dinner on the beautiful patio. Some of the chairs outdoors aren't that comfortable. I ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich with sweet potato tots and my sister had the Mac N Cheese Philly with friends. My sandwich, (chickwaff) was pretty good. Double stacked chicken, bacon, and the bread was a Belgian waffle. I couldn't get the whole things in my mouth (that's what she said - Zing!). The sandwich was a bit dry, but our attentive server was happy to bring me extra syrup. The tots were amazing and were served with this homemade honey mustard sauce. OMG. SO GOOD! My sisters sandwich was a gift from the hipster gods. Sweet crimony, I cannot believe she let me sample it (for Yelp Review purposes)! First, this sammie should come with a bib, it's messy, my sister handled it like a pro. The combination of mac N cheese, tender philly steak, peppers, and that cheese sauce! OMG-amazing! The fries were natural cut and served with a spicy homemade ketchup. Another homerun.

Park on Fremont is a solid and welcomed addition to my beloved Fremont East. Great, fun inventive food, inspired libations, comfortable clean, hipster atmosphere. What's not to love. If your looking for a place to park your feet and enjoy some tasty eats, look no further! Cheers, Park!",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,2,3,4,rZjPiYcYxgh8iTnzB2b2NQ

It was just my luck though that we chose the worst night to go. The backyard area was closed off for a wedding so we couldn't sit back there and the tables inside were reservations only, so we were sat on the front patio. This would've been fine if it wasn't 100 degrees last night! All of the servers were really sweet though and understood how hot it was, so they helped us out and got us a seat inside because one of their reservations got pushed back a few minutes so they said we could take the table if we could be done before the reservation. We thought that was really nice that they went out of their way to accommodate us.

We all ended up getting the Steak Tacos which were delicious! I had a big lunch earlier that day so I just wanted something small. It came with 3 tacos and they were the perfect size for a small plate. I also had one of their Moscow mules, which was very refreshing since it was still really hot inside the restaurant.

I've passed it so many times while going up and down Fremont when out with friends, I've never even thought to come in and check out their selections. I tried it today... and wasn't too wowed by them. I made reservations, but found it unnecessary. The inside decor is very Tim Burton meets Anthropologie. They try but it's off a beat. It smells..like how you smell after a night out downtown - sweaty and dried alcohol. It really rubs you the wrong way. The wait staff was prompt, and she immediately offered to take our drinks order. Not too much selection but enough to wet your whistle. I got my usual jack and ginger, but apparently it's a mule here. Sounds good. My friend got the pillow talk. My drink was fine, nothing out of the ordinary, a bit weak. Hers had a description of so many yummy fruits, but when it came out there weren't any slices or anything. Weird. I mean we weren't expecting a sangria, yet still, at 10 bucks a drink, a bit of embellishment would be nice. She also said it was a bit weak. My other friend got the trophy wife, but she said her drink was good. 

The food was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary and was okay tasting. The monte cristo wasn't even fried, nor was it sweet. My friends got burgers and they were okay, honestly in n out would've been cheaper and yummier. I can't get over the portion sizes- they're tiny! The place was nicely busy, but everyone seemed to be digging into their food. It seemed okay at best. I think this is where tourists come while day drunk. 

The best part of the visit was the postcard bit. They give you a postcard to send while out lit. That's super cute. 

Maybe as a local you expect downtown to just ""get you"" and try to make sure you're taken care of. We felt kind of jipped, when we were just hoping for a nice buzz. Win some, lose some. This isn't a win.",dEz2UFdllf3jONMZQgJuWQ,1,1,3,6MdAYWyiDc5g8mfdZjMigg

Yet that doesn't keep me coming back- the creative easy shareable menu and well balanced craft cocktails are what keeps me returning.
We were a party of four and we ordered the Tokyo Tots, Crispy Brussels sprouts, Mac + cheese balls, eggplant lettuce cups and the great Greek salad with chicken. 
Great small bite style food that was shareable and delicious! The Tokyo Tots were so good, a bit spicy and uniquely flavored with nori strips and a sweet soy glaze with a saracha aoli to provide a tasty heat. These were amazing and were not that spicy even for the less adventurous in our group. The crispy Brussels sprouts may have been my personal favorite- they had a great flavor, slightly sweet and crunchy with pink lady apples added to the mix. Mac and Cheese balls are a bar staple, but these are perfectly done- lightly breaded on the outside they have a great crunch which pairs well to the creamy cheese filled inside- and for extra gluttonous flavor - they sprinkle them with parmesan and offer a cheese dipping sauce! The eggplant lettuce cups are a make your own with cold crips iceberg lettuce leafs and this amazing stir fry blend of eggplant and mushrooms with a miso glaze that is bursting with flavor! 
I didn't try the salad because it had chicken in it- but it looked AMAZING! It was full of ripe red tomatoes and bell peppers and beautiful tender slices of grilled chicken- my friend said it was very tasty and she lived every bite!  
For drinks we ordered The unicorn, Flower Power, pillow talk, and the trophy wife.
The Unicorn was smooth and lemony flavored and really well balanced with Citron Ketel one, lemon, and ginger beer. The Flower power (which is what I ordered) had Tito's and Elderflower liqueur, with fresh lemon and Orange Red Bull- it was different than I expected with the red-bull. It had a really delicate flavor that was floral but not overtly strong. The garnish of a purple orchid really made it better. My husband ordered the Pillow Talk and he isn't a big drinker but he loves this one so much he always orders it! It is so refreshing with Vodka, pear syrup, fresh mint and strawberries muddled together and a twist of orange and club soda with a cucumber slice garnish- so good, but in the dangerous way. The trophy wife is tasty in its simplicity- with Rum, and a great blend of lemon, orange and pineapple juices. 
This is a great small tucked away spot with an excellent back patio and quiet for conversations and to grab some great drinks, and tasty bites but not a full on meal (though you can do that too) while you are enjoying the Fremont Experience.

The chicken and waffle sandwich is neat in concept and plays well with the finger food mentality of the place. The drawback comes in the fact that the waffle was almost soggy and lukewarm. The chicken is nothing impressive. The choice of sides are decent. We went with the potato salad and it was good. They use egg in the mixture and that was very good. As the night progressed I ordered the veggie pita wrap with a side of sweet potato tots. This was better. The warm pita stuffed full with cheese and a variety of grilled vegetables was much better.

We got there for brunch around 11 and the host said they were full (there was empty tables though). We said we'd wait but she wouldn't take our name because it's strictly first come first serve. What? So we sat at the bar and got some drinks and placed our food order with the bartender. We saw more tables open and asked the host if we could go there (she did not come to get us). So we waited until about 12:30 when the bartender asked if we'd gotten food yet. She had already cashed us out so we had to tip on food we hadn't even gotten yet. The place is also dead. The tables are empty at peak lunch time. She went to ask what happened and apparently they took our food to the wrong table and those people just ate it. Our food came out very quickly after that. It tasted pretty good although that was the smallest egg I've ever seen in my life (I got the avocado toast). It was also supposed to be poached and it was overcooked. There are some easy policy changes they could make to help them help lots of money. Wait staff is friendly. It's a shame.,BE9D1vxgJrYz4rvsDMnmhg,1,1,3,enI8eva7mZsOO_j6Rc2rcg

I came on new years Eve and it wasn't crowded, service was amazing and friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed my time.

The drink I had was to die for--I ordered the pillow talk and it came in a mason jar. I was so amused at the presentation and every little detail of their dishes. Fries came in an adorable tin pail, and the entire place looked straight out of a fairytale tavern in the woods.

Out back they have an adorable patio with lighted trees and a fireplace going. It's downright romantic if youre with a significant other. I really wish I had someone with me that night.

5492264,2013-03-31,9,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"I had heard about Park on Fremont when a fellow Yelper started a thread on them on Yelp Talk. I looked them up on Facebook and I loved the photos they had on there and decided to follow them on Twitter. We came here last night (Saturday night) around 10PM and we were greeted by the tall bouncer who checked our ID's, and two hostesses. We had a choice to eat inside or outside and we chose inside. We were seated right at the very first table, across from the bar. I liked where we sat as the booth was very comfortable and I got a good view of the bar and they had some very interesting decor. The whole place had great decor. It was kinda dark and loud where we sat but I got used to it after a while.

We sat for a few minutes when Jose (I'm guessing a manager) came over and introduced himself to us and told us that our waitress would be over soon. In less than a minute, our waitress came over and she was so sweet. I didn't catch her name but she's a pretty, petite, blond wearing a thin headband. I ordered the Banana Beer and the Chicken Bar Bites, and my boyfriend wanted the grilled cheese but they were all out of that so he got the Chicken Bar Bites instead. For his beer, he ordered Red Stripe but the waitress came back and said that they were all out of it, and because of that, the manager would buy  him his beer. So the bf named at least 3 more beers that were on the menu but they were all out of the ones he named. Finally he asked the waitress which ones they had and were good and she recommended the Dogfish Head Raison D'etre beer.

I absolutely loved my banana bread beer, and my bf enjoyed his beer as well. The chicken bites came with fries and even though the chicken bites looked really plain and simple, it tasted really good. The chicken was juicy and the breading had a slight crunch to it. The fries were ok.

We will definitely return in the next few weeks as I really want to try their Philly Mac and Cheese Steak, and I'd like to check out their outside patio area.

I would have given them five stars but I deducted one star because they were out of many beers.",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,11,9,4,aH-WP3MnsdZpAsI1L2LRkw

I first noticed the very interesting interior design with wallpaper on the ceiling and stuffed birds behind the bar.  You don't see that everyday.  The smaller size of the restaurant/bar added to the overall feeling of intimacy.

Were greeted by our server Joe soon after being seated.  During the course of dinner he was attentive, fun and added a nice touch to our great experience.

OMG!  The Fried Mac and Cheese balls were seriously delicious-I could eat them all day.  They had a nice and crispy shell with a gooey bacon-y (is that a word?) center. Plus, you can't go wrong with ramekins filled with hot cheese and a wing-type sauce for dipping.

For dinner, I ordered the Mahi Tacos.  At first, I was slightly disappointed at how small they were, but after tasting, I realized they packed a great flavor punch.  The fish was flaky and delicate with a crispy tempura batter, not over-fried.  The tacos were then topped with a creamy chipotle dressing. Yum.

My partner ordered the classic burger which was 1/2lb topped with American cheese, red onion, tomato, iceburg lettuce, and Thousand Island dressing;  it was cooked to a perfect medium.  I took a bite and had it had a nice beefy flavor.  Along side the burger were crispy fries and a house-made Sriracha ketchup which added a nice zippy touch.  No Heinz here.

Then, my partners cousin ordered the BBQ Texas Burger which she was very happy with; topped with BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, pepper bacon, and an onion ring.  The standout for her were the sweet potato tater tots served with a honey mustard maple dipping sauce.  I had a few and thought they were amazing.  I only wish I would have ordered a side for myself.

The steak salad was ok but definitely nothing to rave about. The fried pickles were ok but they were soggy and cold by the time we got them.

5599594,2013-12-16,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"There is a place bearing the same moniker in the Meat Packing District of New York City, and wonder if this place is related to that one in anyway.  The theme and decor seems the same (night time parkesque with urban touch) on both ends and struck me more as a prefunk joint prior to clubbing.  One thing that differntiated each other was that the one in New York was way bigger and two (and a half??) stories tall and had a dinner/lounge area on the first floor and a dancefloor/ultralounge motif on the upper level.  While Park on Fremont looked to be more of a gastropub.  

I am no expert on the phenomenon and far from someone who can define a gastropub, but all the gastropubs that I have visited all seem to serve unique drinks or craft beers along with typical food with an eccentric twist, oh yeah, they all seem to right their menu down on chalkboards I found...almost like a bar on steroids if you will.

To support my claim, I had the mac and cheese Philly sandwich to go along with a   Sierra Nevada Kellerweis Hefe while my then fiance had the chicken and waffles sandwich (the unicorn I think it was called??) to go with some type of old fashioned cocktail.  I wasn't crazy about the food, but they get a good grade for effort I suppose.  

What I find most appealing about Park is that it is part of the whole ""Hsieh Downtown Revival Movement.""  It offers a new dimension to this growing artsy district, each establishment complimenting one another.  I draw the line right at LVB, everything West of that street is ol' school downtown casinos and bars, while everything East of that street is everything else I am all about.  

Park is well positioned and if I had to map my map of attack on a nightly basis, it would most likely start with a Sazerac at Downtown Cocktail Lounge, then Park for a beer and a snack (cushion), jump into either the Grif for a goblet of Delerium or Insert Coins (granted they ain't tryna be stingy at the line), slide through to Beauty Bar to get some fat shots then have a contest of some sort to see who will stand in line at the Commonwealth while the rest of the gang stays refreshed at the Vanguard.  Yep, that's a well planned strategy if I must say so myself.

So again, Park plays an intricate role in the inner workings of the downtown scene and provides a different flavor amongst the many the area has to offer.  Had the food been better, I could see myself giving a higher rating, but overall not a bad spot at all.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,0,1,4,ijUGlTFKSXCLE3Mso6gRlQ
5604160,2015-09-02,1,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"Have been meaning to check it out on friend's recommendation and finally got around to it last night, woo-hoo!

 Located in the center of downtown Las Vegas hustle and bustle and adjacent to a slew of other trendy bars and hangouts, it doesn't disappoint. 

 Decor is a typical hip and cool mix of damask print wallpaper, copper accented high tops, random prints of weird eyed creatures on wall- very eclectic, very well thought through and carefully selected, it works nicely all pulled together. 

 Don't know that Tuesday night warrants a bouncer outside carding the patrons- it's cute and all when you are 20-ish but when you are pushing 40, might as well hand over your Chevron card and we can skip the formalities, nobody's looking at your DOB at this point. 

 The crowd is a good mix of facial haired, eyeglass wearing downtown dwellers, tipsy girls in tight dresses, clearly running a melon smuggling operation, tourists exploring downtown and a few thirties-forties some locals like myself, keeping up with the times. 

 The menu is small and straightforward- like! While I did contemplate a fancy Bloody Mary, one of three described on menu, I decided to go for craft beer on tap. My one gripe is that nobody seems to get that Hef lovers don't want apricot, jalapeño or whatever flavor all the time and no, Blue Moon is not ""craft"", so I settled for an ok blond brew of some sort. Served in mason jar. Because. That's how cool people drink, don't question it.

 Now for the food- uncomplicated selection of appetizers, hearty fare and slower metabolism selection, one pager, love it. Against my better judgement of knowing what's good for me, I order Garbage Fries. OMG. I think they are called Garbage Fries because you realize all other fries you've eaten up to now have been garbage. It's a delicious journey into crispy fries, hunks of savory bacon, fresh jalapeño, diced avocado, fried egg and cheesies. It's probably a 3,000 calorie offering, but I'm ok knocking it down to nothing but tomatoes and eggs for a week to justify these. 

 There was some talk of tacos and dos Equis specials for Tuesday night, but I'm very happy I didn't sway and stuck with the heavenly fries.

Philly: By far one of the most innovative yet flavorful Philly cheesesteaks I've had. I've had my share of Phillies that lacked boldness in flavor which is why I normally order them with provolone cheese, but this one just nailed it AND with Mac and cheese. I liked that they added breadcrumbs on the Mac and cheese because it added that extra texture to the overall sandwich.

Garbage fries: Did not taste ANYTHING like its name. Just from looking at it, it doesn't really look like it would be that flavorful, but I was so wrong. The fries were fried to perfection without it being way too greasy, and the egg complimented the dish very well. I'm almost convinced that the boldness in flavor came from the sauce that they used. Either way, suuuper delicious.",rtOP1AmOHbZv9yQ7VI8InA,2,2,5,qQakamSqRFrb_8agksIZxA

Ordered the Chicken Bites and the Steak Salad. Really good plates. The sweet potato teeter tots were crunchy and delicious and the chicken bites were crispy. The steak in the salad was cooked well and yummy garnishes on top!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We dropped by for drinks while waiting for our reservation at Le Thai. Wanted to go to Gold Spike but it was too hot and too far. 

Really underwhelming in my opinion. The happy hour prices seemed great, $1 chips & salsa and $4 Dos Equis drafts! 

But it ended up being half a handful of stale chips with a dinky container of canned salsa and a mini mason jar of XX. 

I guess you can't expect much with those kinds of prices, but I just hope their servings are larger when it isn't happy hour.",KjLjePO5TKKhmdo4ZwxKHA,2,0,3,GDdFWrYsc495ITsHmO6sIg

There was one server and one busser running around. The server never came by so we had to wave her down. She rolled her eyes and annoyingly asked ""Yes?"" OK, I understand there is only one of you but I am a paying customer. I couldn't believe she said that. We ordered with her anyway because we were starving after that 5K. 15 minutes passed...25 mins...nothing came out and we haven't seen the server since.

The outdoor patio was full and so we decided to eat inside. We were seated at a comfortable corner booth. Our server arrived and initially not a real warmth to her personality but she grew nicer as the evening progressed. Sometimes I wonder what ever happened to quality customer service??!! The restaurant itself has some unusual and cool art hanging on the walls. There is wallpaper on the ceiling too which gave the interior character.

Anyway I had read they offer a nice selection of microbrewed beer and my husband and I both ordered a pint of Moose Drool. Well, a couple minutes later our server came back to inform us that they were out of that beer. We then ordered two Alleycat Amber Ales I always wonder how restaurants run out of a certain beer. Shouldn't they order enough? Here is the food breakdown:

Mac N Cheese/Phillysteak sandwich - a recommended dish and my friends enjoyed it. It was moist and the meat was tender. The Mac and cheese was a nice touch and added flavor.

Fish Tacos - my choice. These were really spicy with chipotle mayo, cilantro, cabbage and fish. The fish was crunchy, light and fluffy. I give these 5 stars on their own!

Steak Tacos - my husband had these and I had a couple bites. Super basic tacos with very little flavor. The meat tasted like rubber and was very  over cooked. Probably the worst choice on the menu.

Will I go back? I probably would just to sit outside on the cool back patio and to eat a couple more fish tacos!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,1,2,4,9L5g2gU3Lh8kRlvBD20dwA

Service was ok. We were still hungry so we ordered breakfast potatoes/homefries. I guess the server was confused but also didn't ask for clarification so we were brought French fries. We figured, we would just suck it up and eat them even for breakfast ?. My inner 8 year old screaming ""yay! Fries for breakfast!!!"" Lol The manager? Awesome! Very pleasant and fixed us up right away with what we were looking for. She kinda saved the whole dinning experience from what started out to be kind of a mess. Hang on to her!

5659965,2015-06-28,6,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"If you ever went to Absinthe during the first run, you've seen this type of decor. Mismatched indoor furniture - but outdoors, Haunted Mansion -esq paintings, string lights, and of course, the hipster holy grail: MASON JARS. If Peaches Geldof came back from the grave to design an eatery around her favorite Pinterest board, it would be Park on Fremont.

I've been to PoF 4 times. The biggest issue (other than the pentagram in the bathrooms, which is a huge turn off to even patronizing this place) is that it is so sunny outdoors. Okay, I get that it's cool to have an outdoor seating area, but it's Vegas and it is sweltering a huge chunk of the year. I've seen others who are already eating, pounce on unbused tables in the shade once people get up to leave. I've done it as well. Having to shield your eyes as you eat and sweat just isn't enjoyable. If there were more umbrellas, or even a semi permeable awning of some sort, it'd go a long way to making outdoor dining enjoyable. 

Honestly, come during happy hour. The prices are significantly cheaper and the portions are the same. Make sure you check what is covered under the HH menu, drink wise, because I've paid $8 for a well drink that I assumed would be less than $3 based on the special at the time. The 1 lb of chicken wings for $5 and the garbage fries are really the only things I'd recommend. They're delicious. Skip the chicken & waffles which is heavy on the carbs, and lacking in flavor. 

Service varies from the attentive, to having to go inside to ask where the check is after waiting, waiting, waiting. I've even ordered drinks that never came (and thus I didn't pay for them.) Whatever, PoF's loss. 

If it weren't for the HH chicken wings, the egg topped garbage fries and the fun see saw out back, I wouldn't recommend this place. Oh, and even if you wear flip flops, be careful.

The interior is cute and quirky and a little hipster vibish?  It is a rectangular shaped building with the bar on the left side and booths on the right side to sit in.  There is an outdoor area that I would have liked to check out, but with the heat breaking temps on that May day in 2018 (I think it was 103 which was record breaking for that particular day) - we decided to sit inside. Which.... we found out very quickly was probably almost as bad as sitting outside.  To make a long story short - there was NO AIR CONDITIONING.  Now, if it is an old building and that is part of the charm ok ok I see.  However, there were also NO FANS.  It was devastatingly uncomfortable!  I am definitely torn on the review!

When you walk into this restaurant, you'll notice it has the cozy space of your local dive bar: a bar section along one side of a narrow interior and a row of tables along the opposite side. But seating isn't limited to this area - there's also plenty of space out front and out in the back [hidden in the back is a full sized see-saw (yes, see-saw)]. 

As I mentioned at the top, this place is a piece of art. It's like Tim Burton collaborated with an interior designer and suggested, ""less goth more abstract,"" ""mute the colors,"" and ""throw in some flair shit like TGIFridays does."" And so they came up with ceilingpaper patterns, fireplace beer taps, record player jukebox, taxidermy birds... I could enjoy spending all day just looking at this stuff... and eating stuff!

The eats we had on this visit were small and perfect for a casual bite. We got in around 6pm and it turned out to be happy hour, so we took advantage. I had the Steak Tacos ($6, normally $9) which came with three tasty corn tortilla tacos with salsa, guac, and sour cream. Also ordered the Garbage ($6, normally $13) fries, which can be substituted with tots or chips. It was probably one of the best versions of a nachos-style dish: cheddar & provolone, bacon, green onions, tomato's, and jalapenos. Great dishes at a great price.

They have a small menu, but it works! We went here with some friends so we were recommended items prior to even coming here. We started off their Chicken Wings (1 lb) and asked for the sauce on the size. These were delicious, but then again.. I've never came across a bad serving of Chicken Wings.

This is a great atmosphere, especially when the temps are good to hang out outside. The courtyard like area outside is a perfect spot to go for a chill night out. Also, if you venture a little further outside to the back of the seating area, there's a doorway off the side that leads to a small area with a seesaw. The inside is nice too, but it's definitely a hipster vibe with crazy wallpaper prints and animal heads on the walls. 

The drink prices are pretty comparable to other places downtown, so expect to spend about $7/beer or $8/cocktail. They do have a ""beer and a shot"" deal which recently went up from $10 to $12, but still it's a pretty decent deal. They do have some good beers offered for this deal like Dog Fish Head 90 IPA, and it's not just well alcohol.

5918842,2014-02-12,3,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"Definitely a different vibe and scenery from your other typical Downtown LV Fremont Street establishment.  Which I have to say is a very good thing.  I almost felt like this could be a gastro pub plucked right out of Downtown Santa Barbara or San Diego and through the technomagic of 22nd century additive manufacturing process better known as 3D printing technology reassembled layer by layer in the spot it currently occupied on 506 E Fremont Street in Las Vegas.

The abundance of flora, interesting selection of dark wall paintings and other decorations, the open air outdoor seating area in the rear, all reminded me of portions of SoCal, even though I am sure this is an original design.  Homesick much?  Maybe.

So I made my way to yet another pub type establishment, because of yet another friend's ""temporary relocation away from Las Vegas"" party or you can shorten it to your plain old going away party, but I felt the need for verbosity.  It was still relatively early, about 6pm, and my eyes had a hard time adjusting to the dimly lit interior as you walk into the bar area off the street.  The bartender and whoever else were working there must be busy, because no one acknowledge my presence at all.  Total fail on my part, especially after I had completed a session on How To Make An entrance at a work related workshop.   Not to be deterred by having been slighted by these employees, I brazing set off to explore the depth of this unwelcoming alcoholic dispensary.  I was shortly rewarded with the sight of a pleasant outdoor seating area, seemingly from another age.  Victorian perhaps, although with an added deliberate state of rehabilitation, for that extra feeling of mysteriousness.

Just like the people of the Victorian age in London, as my many hours of period drama viewing have taught me, the behaviors of the workers in this obscured portion of the pub conformed more expectedly to the ethereal temporal throwback of that bygone age.  In other words, they acted according to their station, and greeted customers with obvious courteous deference.  A menu and a mason jar of water was promptly brought out, as I waited for the entire gathering to assemble.

[Fast forward to the exciting part of the review - the food!]

Summer Strawberry Salad - very nice and tasty.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The salad was served on an eco-friendly bamboo plate. A little more gorgonzola cheese crumbles would be nice, but not a deal breaker at $12 a serving.

Cuban Sandwich - Decent, not the greatest, but I too finished it being brought up not to waste food as a child.  But I am thinking this was a seasonal promotion, as I no longer see it on their online menu.  Or it was simply not that popular.

I also had a few bites of a friend's Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  He was on a perpetual quest to find a good version of it here somewhere in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately his quest must continue, as the version here disappointed him greatly.  The waffle was the offending element if you must know more details.  

Sweet Potato Teeter Tots that came with the sandwiches were good, especially with the dipping sauces.  Way better than fries I am sure.

The Classic Burger - didn't get to try it, but that looked very good and only comes with the MSRP of $9.

Overall, a nice little get away to dine at near Fremont Street.  Now that the weather is getting nicer again, it will be back on the list of places to hit up before it gets excessively hot.

If you are bored, explore the rear rear of the property, where you get to seesaw like you did when time was simpler, the chance of upward class mobility was bright, and the Pacific is not irradiated.

3 stars!

5922258,2016-06-08,2,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"So I've had this place on my Yelp bookmarks, and this used to be one of my favorite downtown spots, which is why I wish I could give this more stars. This place has some pros and some cons
Pros
-The decor is amazing.Theres a bunch of weird/cool looking decor on the wall, and their patio is quite possibly my favorite in all of Vegas. When I'm in there, i completely forget I'm in vegas because back there it feels like I'm in 5 different cities.
-The drinks are generally pretty good. I appreciate when effort is put into a drink, and they are good for that. The mules are definitely toppers 
-The Philly Mac n Cheese, and the Mac n cheese balls. I never realized Mac n cheese and Philly Cheesesteaks were such a perfect pairing until here. And their Mac n cheese balls are quite ridiculously good. I tip my hat to you
Cons
- Even when I used to come here on the regular, I was never a fan of their taco tuesdays. their tacos were decent, which isn't a big deal on either way because they're not a taco shop. I did however have an issue with the baby Dos Equis they used to give us. I mean it was like a gulp and a half. I perused the page and wasn't able to see any mention of taco  Tuesday.
-I tried the chicken and waffle sandwich recently, and maybe its just me, but It wasn't as good as i remembered. I can't quite put my finger on what was different. Maybe it was the waffle or the chicken, but sad face from me.
-Lie I said, the drinks are mostly good, but there were a few I wasn't a big fan of, but thats completely suggestive
-People complain about the service. I'm not really going to because its been good and bad, and theres been times when there was a wait to get drinks and stuff, but it wasn't on the server so I try to not do that.

Overall, theres good and bad, I love the ambiance, but idk if thats something that necessarily holds. Two things that do intrigue me to try and check back in with them are the garbage fries; I somehow don't remember ever eating them but a lot of people are raving about it, and the twig and berry. I don't know if its new or if its always been around, but Its definitely something that looks to be worth a try and is part of the good parts of this place",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,5,2,3,GjWG5TIvMXAkBdusdQ7mEQ

5924319,2013-09-10,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"Park is a solid 3. If I'd drafted this the last time I went instead of this time, I'd have given a 4, but this time I finally made it during happy hour. Don't let it fool you; it's a horrible misnomer. The lower prices on the happy hour menu accompany what are basically half-sized portions, saving you no money at all on food or cocktails. At least the waitress warned us about the small portions before we ordered them & ended up even more disappointed. So basically, you're not getting better pricing for happy hour; you're just ordering tapas.

On previous trips, we've tried the chilaquiles (enormous portion, and really good!!); the San Diego burger (my dining mate scarfed it before I could try a bite, & says it was also really good); the chicken bar bites (if chickens had cojones the size of a great Dane, that's what these are -- no bite-sized bites here!); and the Philly mac & cheese sandwich (decently good, though I was expecting more mac & cheese... the other Yelp pics showed much more than we got on that trip). Based on all of those, and the service, which is normally pretty friendly and mostly timely, I'd give a 4.

This last trip, the waitress started out friendly until we expressed amused disgruntlement at the ""happy hour,"" and thereafter she was nothing but flat-lined personality with us, although I went out of my way to be upbeat & friendly with her. Apart from that, we ordered the fried pickles (which we've had before -- pretty tasty! They're cut into slices and are interspersed with fried pepperoncinis, too, as well as sometimes a whole jalapeño!), and we were excited to try the Cuban sandwich and the garden burger.

The Cuban was the most uninspired version of that meal that either of us had ever tasted -- the bread wasn't grilled & pressed, and somehow they took most of the flavor out of this inherently tasty mix of ingredients. The garden burger was the most bland veggie burger I've ever had (and that's saying something). Looking at the patty, it looks like it should be good, since you can see some black beans & tiny pieces of colorful veggies, but it seems like they used zucchini, maybe (or some other filler/black hole of flavor), for the rest of the patty, so the flavors were stretched too thin. They topped it with tomato, cucumber (which I love in the right context, but in this case it also just added to the blandness), and arugula (which, normally tasty, just got swallowed up by the blander ingredients as well). The super light basting of the chipotle mayo-like topping could barely be noticed. If I had to eat this dish again, I'd order an extra side of the stuff & slather it on to see if it made a difference. To get an idea of what a really awesomely executed veggie burger / bean patty tastes like, go to Rí Rá.

As a general note, the accompaniments for most sandwich & burger items are either fries (the seasoning is really good, and the ketchup is slightly spicy, yum!!), sweet sweet potato tots (that other ""sweet"" is in there for a reason -- they're topped with cinnamon/sugar, & while they're good, if you like sweet potatoes, we both felt they'd be better served as a dessert rather than a side for a savory dish), and a couple other things we've never bothered to order, I think cole slaw and a side salad. Some day I'll order the side salad to see what their dressing is like, but I'm not a fan of 98% of cole slaws.

We'll definitely keep coming back & trying the other plates Park has to offer, but we'll be avoiding the ""happy hour"" menu and those last two offerings. It feels claustrophobic sitting inside, but both patios are nice!",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,2,1,3,h_VfI7nH_YiPg5CC4SuBoQ

I was very disappointed with my experience. The bar tenders were extremely rude and seemed inconvenienced to be making us drinks. I don't really understand why because we had a large group who were all gracious tippers and not to mention friendly people! I had been sitting by the bar and overheard multiple bartenders talk badly about my group not knowing that I was also apart of that group. Complaining that there were too many of us and we were ""too loud."" I was unaware that we were supposed to be whispering at this bar. There was also an instance when we were trying to take a group picture in front of the bar's sign which we were to later post (advertisement) and a female bartender made a snappy comment that she needed to get through our picture so that she could work to a couple of our group members while we were in the midst of taking the picture. 

Overall, I was extremely uncomfortable here and do not plan on coming back. If you are planning on doing anything group wise this place would not be the bar for you. They prefer their bar not to be crowded and make sure you use your inside voice.",CJHL9GlARKYDcB0Lyp3rZA,1,2,1,0ulkpWjasjF4M3xz7hWi1g

The food is solid bar food, albeit service can be slow. I have had the fried chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of sweet potato tots multiple times and it has never disappointed. The portion can be big, so half has been my lunch or dinner the next day. My favorite though is probably their garbage fries, a mix of fries, jalapeños, and egg among other things. Great for 3 in the afternoon or 1 in the morning.

Their beer and a shot is a deal for $12 and a great way to start a night out. Mixed drinks are also fun to explore, I personally like pillow talk. If you make it out to weekend brunch (which I don't see how you can't since it ends at 4 or 5), get the patio pounder. $20 for a bottle of champagne and orange juice.

I've been on a couple of occasions but always feel the food and drinks are overpriced for what I get and am always disappointed by the service. Slow and forgetful. Every time I have been there I always end up having to flag down someone to take my order, get refills, and get the check. The atmosphere is cute and the location is full of all sorts of potential but it's just not there for me.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,5,2,DcYH91DX40SvTqu_Ptu-Ew

AND good, flavorful, ACTUALLY filling food: 
AND well mixed cocktails / beer variety on the chimney tap : 
Instagram-worthy:  
Possibly have seen pictures of people riding the see-saw tucked away towards the back alley.

Dog friendly:  Fur babies & pup mums welcome in the front patio.
The first time I ate here was with my previous bosslady and her huge St. Bernard - who was welcomed with the water bowl upon entering.

LOVELY for BRUNCH in the front and people watch or in the garden while lounging in the cute patio chairs, art and fresh flowers always, sweet on Sundays for mimosas easing back into the work week.

LOVELY for DINNER in the garden date once the ""f*cking beautiful"" neon sign lights up, the trees twinkle and you want to turn on the charm. As the fireplace also sets the mood.

Really, the Garden is ALWAYS LOVELY, feel free to hopscotch your way in. It's what I wish my back yard looked like sometimes. 

Highly recommend eating here, drinking here, even if its quick and you must stop to use the facilities as all employees must wash hands and ""say bloody Mary into the mirror three times before returning to work"".

The usuals ordered with friends are the Mac & Cheese balls, which we recently discovered has changed drastically in recipe! NOO! Bring back the original mac & Cheese balls!! I also enjoy the garbage fries which is much more delicious than it sounds. 

Park on Fremont's been around only a few years, yet has quickly become a staple, hot spot to eat pregame and bar hop the night away as it is also well located in the center of where touristy Fremont experience ends and local artsville Fremont East begins.",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,4,3,5,3ZR9aoIGb-xGSNUB0m-Geg
5983722,2013-04-26,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"Oddly charming.  I mean, once you get over the tacky 60s decor, gaudy outfits the bartenders and waitresses have to wear, creepy big headed people wallpaper in the women's restroom, stuffed ducks fornicating above the bar, and caged in teeter-totter in the outside patio area, it's actually a nice bar. I promise.  It all adds to the odd charm.  Everything about this place is different.

Let me expand on the teeter totter.  When you walk out onto the back patio, there's a little 3' gap in the back fence on the left.  That secret passageway leads you to an old looking see-saw in a very claustrophobic fenced in area.  If you look up, you'll notice prison-like barbed wire fencing.  It's kind of a odd feeling, not going to lie.  But as I stated, it all adds to the charm and uniqueness of the place.

The drinks come out in mason jars, which I am actually a fan of.  The bar service was attentive and timely, even when our large and rowdy bar crawl group was there.  I can't speak for the food unfortunately; I didn't get to try it.  But maybe I'll go back for that (I've heard it's just so-so) just to say I did it and post an update on Yelp.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,1,4,Udhr9ka4BOz052Hf0Hl2JA

5991973,2017-02-18,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,"I have tried to eat here twice, the menu looks good and I was excited to try the brunch menu. The first time I tried to order postmates and the park cancelled my order because they were busy, no big deal i understand. About two weeks later me and my boyfriend decided to actually go eat there and check out the brunch menu. We waited to be seated for only about 10 mins, we were seated outside in the back. I loved the decor and atmosphere and was very excited to finally try the drinks and food! We had been seated for about 20 mins and not one waiter/waitress acknowledged we had been sat. No one said ""I'll be with you in a moment"" no one brought us water, it was like we weren't even there. We had been passed by multiple waiters and waitress but nothing. Finally I got up and talked to the hostess who said she'd bring someone to our table right away, at that time though we were just over it and left to eat somewhere else instead. Very disappointed I really wanted to try the menu! I don't think I'll ever go back. Had just one person even acknowledged our presence we probably wouldn't have left",aJ3_kqB1SmgIWKhc-yzmzw,0,0,1,LC5AWQgWUJafG_Si364v0w
5995843,2015-02-02,0,wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,A co-worker and I had planned on going to their Taco Tuesday during lunchtime (12:30-1:30pm). We thought it would be super busy so we reserved a table. We got there and the reservation was really not necessary at all since there was plenty of seating available . We got there and found out Taco Tuesday didn't start until 3pm. Bummer! We ended up staying since the place had great reviews and really wanted to give the place a try. The pictures posted on Yelp and the other reviews greatly helped to choose from the menu. Ended up choosing the garbage fries and buffalo wings to share. The garbage fries are amazing!!! I am not a fan of eggs and they were kind enough to allow me to order without it. Next time it will definitely be 5 stars once I try the drinks.,fPjOYRRJPzsCO9t3NEPrKQ,0,0,4,tkSTpb6bOKl_IPn0NGzoSg
