These guys know the basics about customer service infused with super-flavorful thai food. We've been coming here for a year (about 8 times). Friendly, fast, clean and fresh tasting thai food. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Not in a fancy big box stand alone building but clean and worth the visit. You won't go wrong I promise. Try the Pad Thai, Deep Fried Tofu and 'F5"" Spicy Thai Basil. Fresh and mouthwatering. Oh and the price ... very affordable. ENJOY this GEM!!!!",qWIr94fMfdV7z09GhCxaRw,0,0,5,L6ChK4l0DZhjQxdbTgdjPw

Food at this place is better than any Thai restaurants that I have ever tried. Mind you, living in LA and being an avid fan of Thai food, I have dined at a substantial number of Thai restaurants. 

We went there for lunch and the restaurant was pretty busy. There were two female servers and they both were very nice and friendly. We typically don't see such friendly and attentive service in LA area. The lunch specials are simply great deals with salad, soup and entr√©e - all with very good quantity. 

The food and service was so good that we ended up going there the second day as well. Anytime we visit Vegas again, we will come here to dine.",Ptcbo8IrdL9FVlDwkArSYA,1,1,5,B_WtDtQ9bMkeijU25eLocQ

The service has always been average, but the food is worth the wait.  Their curries are delicious, and my husband is a big fan of their pad thai and thinks it's about the best in town.  They have a lunch special which is out of this world-- about 15 things to choose from, served with soup and an eggroll for about $10.  It's well worth it.

The complaint comes from the fact that I have received deliveries that were wrong on several occasions.  I'm not one to complain, so I let the first couple go, but  the last time I called them to let them know, and they offered to give me a credit for the same order in the future--perfect. Except, the next time I called, they had no recollection of such a guarantee. I was told by the manager that nothing could be done, so I asked to speak to the owner. I was then told that they are never in the restaurant, and was given an email to contact them; but, the email address didn't work. So, without much other recourse, I'm wallowing in the muck of Yelp reviews. Like I said, the food is great, but the service can be iffy.",GH21Jx0xTKjjQq9thDvw-w,0,0,1,h1DcZDQb-QvMGCIG8yYNow

The fried tofu was not ny favorite but loved the sweet chilli dip that accompanied it.

460588,2011-01-23,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"This restaurant was originally Royal Thai, but they recently changed owners and cooks. The decor was decent, with my only complaint being a few antique American posters around the room under all the Thai decorations. They do have excellent service as they are extremely attentive and polite. 

I think their specialty is duck items, and I do agree. Their Laab was tasty and savory without being too herby. 

We also had Pad Thai and Pad Se-ew, which was also also good without being too salty and too sweet (for the Pad Thai). 

We also ordered 2 Tom Yum dishes: (1) seafood (2) pork ribs(? - can't remember.. some type of pork bone). In terms of favorite dish, I would go with the pork ribs tom yum because I prefer my dishes sour and I don't really prefer tomatoes, which make soups slightly sweet. In fact, we liked the pork ribs tom yum so much, we ordered another! :D The seafood tom yum was still okay though, just not suited for my tastes. A fair warning though; the preparations are Thai in custom, so they leave inedible herbs in the soup to maintain authenticity. You will know they are inedible because they are really chewy; I would just scoop it out. 

The great thing is, they do allow you to change the level of spiciness. I believe there are 5 levels you can choose from, depending on how hot you can handle the food. 

Finally, the famous Thai tea. I have to say, it was fine to me, but I have a sweet tooth, so this tea may be too sweet for the average person. However, I've had teas that are just too strong in tea level, and this one was just fine.

All in all, great job so far. If I were them, I would make new take-out menus soon and change the front of the restaurant to get rid of the ""Royal Thai"" name and put in Weera Thai so people do not get confused.",TUJI7TkRHXK8OnrRt81FiQ,3,2,4,6kd7rFwvnhqglLv9QAvYQw

We Ordered the Duck Curry spicy #3 on a 1-5 spice scale and the crab fried rice. I love places like this that offer brown rice as an alternative and decided to substitute white for brown. The crab fried rice was full of flavor and tasted like they used fresh crab. The duck curry was awesome but was a little too spicy for a #3 but like most Thai places i always believe the number depends on the chef that day. 

For desert we decided on the durian sticky rice with coconut milk. Now for all of you that don't know what durian is its that infamous stinky fruit usually found in most Asian markets. At first I was hesitant to try the desert so I tasted the rice without the fruit and it was pretty good. I then tried it with the durian and it was like nothing I've tasted before and considered it one of the best deserts I've ever tasted.

So, for the 4th of July weekend my family planned to go there for dinner. When we arrived, we noticed that they have renovated the place and it was a much bigger than what I used to know. It was busy, but we cared to wait since we wanted to eat some of our usual dishes again. When we got our table, it was a bit awkward because it was squashed between two other tables and one of our chairs was blocking the path to the restrooms which created unwanted passing through by other people and disturbing our dinner. Then, we have this nice thai lady taking order from us. However, she wasn't taking down any notes. Instead, she was memorizing my orders, so seems like she was pretty good at it. Until, we noticed that we made the order before a couple arrived next to us. But, that couple got their food first and one of the waitress accidentally brought the couple's food to our table. We ordered the same type of dish and when the waitress realized she made a mistake, she was confused and took the food back.That is when I realized the lady who took our order made a grave mistake. We ordered the eggplant dish with beef, but it arrived with chicken and as soon as I saw my favorite dish of crispy pork and vegetables, i realized the portion was smaller than before and the quality dropped just by looking at it. Usually I finish the whole plate but this time I cannot chew some of the pieces, the skin felt like rubber. I can sense that the chefs are out of their breath and exhausted from cooking over and over again at a very busy time. Overall, we didn't get to enjoy our dinner fully. I didn't complain because we are already tired and hungry and we don't feel like bringing up these issues. However, the thai lady who took our order was very nice to bring a coloring paper and crayons for my son to keep himself busy.",ZvU_jyzb2qYagz0LUU4NTQ,0,0,3,XYpFPPU1ZHbAxIFVnGOzKA

549240,2016-05-03,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"My boyfriend used to LOVE this restaurant. The experience would have continued to be 5/5 for us, given that the food is delicious and the waiters were once very kind, helpful, and sincerely nice. However, our experiences since their renovation have been disappointing, and recently, incredibly frustrating due to the bad attitude and lack of customer service of the rude, curt female manager working. Our waitress was very sweet but did not speak English, so there was confusion when she asked if we wanted brown rice, despite the fact that they did not have any at the time. This was no problem when we received only white rice, because as two laid back people, we understand stuff happens. When taking our order, the waitress did great by asking what level of heat and what type of meat we wanted. However, she did not ask what type of tofu I wanted, like they had during previous visits, and I had not thought to tell her because it honestly had spaced my mind. This should have been a simple, easy fix, but the manager made sure that not only was I not going to get steamed tofu, but that she was going to berate and belittle me in front of my boyfriend and the other patrons of the restaurant by spitefully lecturing me at our table about the fact that I needed to specify, or else they are going to make me whatever they want. I have never been so rudely treated and embarrassed in my life. We were so disgusted by this woman at this point, having barely touched our food, that we requested to have our food to go. Instead of letting us pack our own food, the waitress took it all to the back. Upon arriving home, much later than we had intended on having a nice, relaxing meal, as if to add insult to injury, our packed meal had about 20% of the curry that we paid for in the small containers, which made the meal not even worth eating. I called and complained, to which naturally I was combated with lame excuses for their terrible actions. We will never go back there again. If I find out the name of said manager, I will edit and place her name so that you can request not to have her have any part of your dining experience.",dAvznd4Li8IIwYdubOXtew,0,0,1,JWAUtTE3oNNx9nbQBqVrmg

First off Weera's service is terrible. They had us sit, did not take drink orders, I had to ask for my drink then at that they did not ask my fiance for his drink order, they acted like he was non existent. Once our server came back for the third time we ordered our food and his drink.

We love thai food and always over order due to how the food becomes more flavorful the next day. We ordered:

Pad prik king level 4, my fiances favorite (usually) he liked it, said it had a good flavor but could have got level 5. 

Panang curry level 4, my favorite (usually) I could have got a 5 as well. It had good flavor and since this place is close to my work and Archi's is not, I will order it for lunch one day. 

Pad thai level 4, recived level 0. Enough said. 

Shrimp fried rice, it was good, you really have to be terrible to screw that up. 

Fried wings, they were cripsy and the sauce was really good, oh and it was more spicy than our other dishes.

Thai tea, was delish and it would have been nice if the fiance had the option of a refill. 

We waited and waited to be aknowledged for our check.

We have a mixed review on the quality of food and service. First we order chicken potstickers. For $5 we got 8 pieces, I was impressed because none of the other Thai restaurants would give you that many potstickers in an order. It was a bit salty but tasted pretty good. For the main dish we ordered chicken teriyaki and chicken fried rice. The food came out really fast since they weren't really busy. They put a lot of rice on the plate. I was happy this far until I got a bite of the chicken teriyaki. First of all there's not much you can do to ruin a teriyaki dish. It wasn't the flavor of the sauce that made me upset, but the fact that the chicken taste like spoiled meat. I made a complain to the waitress about the weird taste of the chicken. And she said that it was just different style of that region. Helloooo, do you think I'm stupid. I know that different region cooks the same food different way hence the different flavors. But no, the sauce taste just like plain teriyaki sauce, and that's not what I tasted on the chicken. I'm Asian and I crave for  good Asian food all the time. I'm not picky but bad Asian food just turns me off. As far as my husband, he's a white guy but an extremely good cook and cook many asian dishes better than most. He took one bite and pushed the food away. He knew the meat was rancid and ate no more. So when the waitress came back he told her that the meat was bad, and she said ok thank you. 

So when I asked a different waitress to box my fried rice, I told her about the bad teriyaki chicken that we didn't touch, she told us she would check with the kitchen and the owner. After several minutes of waiting, we decided just to leave the cash on the table and don't even bother. As we were walking outside the restaurant, the first waitress came and asked us if we want thai tea to go for screwing up the order. My husband told her he's never coming back to the restaurant again, and her comment was ok thank you very much.  I told her I don't want any thai tea and how upset I was that she tried to convince me again about the different style. Come on! I could understand if maybe I didn't like the flavor, but Bad Meat is Bad Meat. Period. The fact that the owner keep defending the flavor of what I know is the weird taste of bad meat just pissed me off more than the food itself.

We eat out quite often. I give praise where it's due and complaints where it's due.

So will I ever come back here again? Absolutely not! There's so many good Thai restaurants in Vegas, and I wouldn't even consider this place as one of them.",5LagmjrCu2JbXyMSx3YNdg,1,0,1,nwvxfhMU-EBfj-QK81qQIw

670661,2013-01-06,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"Weera Thai is simply ""Amazing"".  I dine there for dinner with increasing frequency.  The food from the extensive menu is consistently outstanding; it never disappoints.  It's fresh, well prepared, flavorful, and offers a complexity that most mortals (including some of the top chefs in Vegas who go there) simply cannot prepare at home.   It is clear that the Weera Thai owners and staff actually care, want your dining experience to be positive, and value your business.  Care is taken to keep the restaurant very clean, and the relaxed, casual, atmosphere is great for conversation.  The service is polite, efficient, friendly and attentive, never intrusive.  I've tried most Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, the extensive menu (including Issan) differentiates itself from others. It has rave reviews from a number of  food critics;  A recent Desert Companion review of Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas claimed it ""Best Thai Food in the Universe"" and ""Mind-blowing"".  The portions are ample and the pricing is very reasonable.  

Reading the other reviews, ..I've not been there during peak lunch hours.  Keep in mind that it is a small establishment and being way from China Town and the Strip, in a small strip mall, means that it really has to deliver to draw customer in order to offer the more extensive menu; if they are out of eggs rolls...there are so many interesting excellent choices not offered elsewhere.  The Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodle),  is outstanding, (I think the owner said that they get the noodles fresh daily!) - I'll take freshness, at the expense of their being out of something on occasion, but personally I've not experienced that.   As of late, I ask the waitresses to select something for me that I haven't tried before - not something I'd not do in many restaurants.  

There are times where it can be a bit busy in the evening if a number of tables show up at the same time, and there are large groups.  My suggestions is go with friends, or a date and enjoy the dining experience, and the environment that allows for conversation.  I dine out often with friends, and am not a stranger to fine dining, and worked in the restaurant industry myself for many years when younger.
I was in Las Vegas for Christmas, and went there both Eve and Day with friends (who are from Asia, live in Las Vegas and are knowledgeble and selective about their restaurants, and fine dining).  They loved it.

Some ideas in addition to Specials there: Panang Curry, Pinapple Fried Rice (hint of curry) combination , Tom Yum or Tom Kha Gai, Crab Fried Rice, (can't recall the name...but there's a duck sausage) I finally tried the Papaya Salad (a bit sweet for my taste, and a bit heavy on the dressing for my liking).  I'd order it again, but ask for less dressing and spicer heat level).

We ordered chicken in red curry sauce and Mongolian beef as our entrees. They were both so good, flavorful and well cooked and so not greasy. We also got pineapple fried rice which was excellent.

The fried rice was okay. I didn't taste any flavor to it other than plain rice that was fried up.

Pad see ew was delicious and not dry with plenty of flavor.

The tom yum soup was traditional tom yum flavor with lots of mushrooms and peppers only a few shrimps. 

The ribs were very tasty chopped into tiny bits. If only they were chopped bigger so that you can actually taste the meat verses a bunch of bones. There wasn't that many pieces of ribs on that tiny plate full of garnishes. 

Each plate varied apprx. $10+ dollars which didn't include rice.  They charge $1 per person for rice which adds up if you go with a large party.",8bRfSEzLoDoa8cjHOWOljw,1,1,4,5o3Z8kdHCTc55L42e7BEyg

I believe I found this place after searching for ""best thai food in vegas."" It was listed among the top three along with Lotus of Siam & Komol so I had to give it a try after already trying the latter two restaurants. I am sooo glad I did because this has become one of my regulars/to go restraurants when I'm not sure what I'm really craving.

YUM I don't think there is a single item on this menu that I don't like. I used to order the same items every time I came.. so much that when I forgot what it was, the waitresses would finish my order for me! Some of my favorites here are: the panang curry, the green curry, crab fried rice, and garlic squid. I won't get into each thing individually because I just don't feel that any words can do it justice, but will note that everything is always fresh and PACKED with flavor. Just think of a regular thai place and multiply the flavor by 5. So. Good. 

I also liked the pad thai. Normally, I don't like pad thai because I find it to be waaay too sweet or saucy, but this is really good. I've ordered it a few times for delivery to school and never had any complaints. Speaking of delivery-- they deliver to a pretty wide area including the strip! woohoo.

My all time favorite thing though would have to be the thai iced tea.. yes.. a drink! It tastes significantly different than thai iced tea from other places (other places tend to have a slight chocolate-y flavor which I'm not a huge fan of). It's hard to explain the exact taste... just trust me & try it! After all it is $1 or 50% off during lunch/happy hour I believe.

Luckily Weera Thai delivered, both literally and figuratively. Granted, there is a 5 dollar surcharge for the service, but at least we didn't need to step into the cold. The food was reasonable priced and plentiful. The chicken green curry came in one of those quart sized containers and was the perfect balance of coconut milk and spice. We also got a salmon red curry which was less successful but still delicious. The salmon was slightly overcooked and the portion was not as plentiful at the green curry.

First off customer service was soooo bad. I asked for my coffee because my thai coffee had to much creamer. I literally had to ask 5 times. And when they finally brought it we were done eating and waiting on our check. Our table next to us was complaining on how long they have been waiting for a waitress to bring them there bill. At this time there is approximately 5 tables and 4 waitresses.

The tom yum chicken was really good! ANgel wings, Papaya salad, nam KAO, pork sausage and basil stir fry chicken was not all that great. Everything is sour and the basil stir fry is an authentic Thai dish and I would have thought that would have more flavors. 

It gets worse *sigh* as the waitress was bringing our meal she pours the rice all over me!!! And breaks the bowl right next to me. Could you imagine if it was my soup? I didn't get an apology however what I did get was ""I didn't mean to do that"". I had rice on the side of my hair, on my pants and on my shoes. At this moment after waiting for some time, I became very frustrated. 

Overall customer service is very poor. Food quality is OK. However decor is very nice.

1192859,2017-02-11,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"We first came here 3 or 4 years ago and remembered it was absolutely delicious! At that time, it was still the hole-in-the-wall place with sagging booth seats and friendly service. We were surprised and happy to see the place had doubled in size and updated its decor, as that meant business was going well for them.

We walked in and were directed to a table that still had water marks from the glasses before. No big deal. They brought us the menu and waters, and gave us a few moments to look through their extensive menu. Compared to a few years ago, they had definitely expanded their menu selection, which is both exciting yet overwhelming at the same time. It offered a chance to try new dishes yet we were wary of the chef being a ""jack of all trades, master of none"". Of course, the prices had gone up quite a bit, which is to be expected seeing how well they had been doing.

Pad See Ewe with pork was a pretty big portion, overshadowing the lunch portions at neighbouring tables. It had a sweetness to it, but not overly so. Other than that, the flavour was pretty bland. It was not bad but it reminded me of your typical Americanized-Asian takeout place.

My better half was a bit more adventurous, trying a more specialized Thai dish: Khao Soy with beef. It was a generous portion but again, very little flavour. We used to practically live off of Khao Soy when we were in Chiang Rai, and this was nothing close to that and even falling significantly shorter than the Americanized version of the same dish at Lotus of Siam.

It seemed as if the chef subscribed to the quantity over quality concept. Service was like a team effort: it seemed impersonal as it was always a different person who took our order, brought our food, refilled our waters, etc. Definitely not the mom-and-pop style restaurant we remembered it to be.

We were disappointed that one of our favourite Thai places in Vegas had hit it big and forgot where they came from. It has become so much more expensive while losing its bold flavours and personalized service.",ihtr8PzUNeNMAihO02vyBw,4,0,3,mO-99E40eS0p6BiNY6m_aA

Crab rangoon was loaded with fillings inside with very thin wrap. Tom yum was great.

It didnt have strong duck smell and it was cooked perfectly. Very well done!!!!! Red curry was little too aqueous (i would have liked it little thicker) but it tasted really good. 

They have spicyness rating from 1-5 and i ordered 3 on all of mine and his was 4. If you love spicy foods then i think u can go for 5. Im not a big spicy handler but 4 was manageable to me.

Pad Thai here is large and flavorful. We ask for no eggs and it comes with a large pile of sprouts and I love the ground peanuts and slice fresh lime.

The Pad Kee Mao (I get it medium and wow it's pretty spicy) is full of yummy Thai basil and big fresh flat noodles. 

The portions are big here and the prices are on target.

1479646,2015-06-25,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"We were in search of another Thai restaurant that was as good, if not better than, Archi's on Flamingo. Yelp reviews led us to this restaurant. I would have to say that this is an exceptional place for Northern Thai food! 

They have a happy hour from about 4-7pm, but they extended the offer until 9pm today. So, I tried their Crispy Papaya Salad with shrimp offered at $5.00. This was amazing! The dressing is a slightly sweet lime juice, which goes great with the julienned papaya, cut green beans, tomatoes, and peanuts. 

For an entree, I chose the Red Curry Pumpkin at spicy level of two. This Thai red curry has Thai spices, chilies, bamboo shoots & coconut milk, with your choice of meat. I selected the crab meat. It was served in a huge oblong bowl with brown rice on the side. The flavors were sublime! It was a generous portion for less than $15.00.

For dessert, I had to try the mango and sticky rice to compare to Archi's. Although it was a large portion with fresh ripe mangoes that were delectable, the sticky rice and coconut milk was a little too sweet for my liking. To avoid this in the future, I could order the coconut milk on the side.

I enjoyed their Jasmine hot tea with dinner and dessert. The china was beautiful. The service was excellent! The restaurant was super clean and nicely decorated, and the menu offers something for everyone.

Update:

Since my first review, I have been back to enjoy some of the same favorites with the same quality, presentation, and service as previously given - all excellent!

The food we ordered was great, we ordered the squid which is hard to  time if it stays too long to cook in the hot wok, crab rice, papaya salad and some appetizers all turned out great.

Food: There food was amazing! I got the Lao papaya salad combination with barbaque chicken and cabbage. The papaya salad was more Amercanized then I expected. I was missing my mom's homemade Lao food and it wasn't close to authentic Lao papaya salad. I do admit I choose to get mild spice flavor and it tasted so much like something my mom or step dad would make for a toddler's version of papaya salad. The barbaque chicken was amazing out of the entire dish! My boyfriend got crab rangoon and the plain beef and cashew stir fry. The crab rangoon was very simple and wonderful. Crab rangoon should be simple and other restaurants add too many spices to out do other locations to get the American market. The plain beef and cashew stir fry was 10/10 since he ate the entire dish without sharing any with me. Haha.

We got seated right away and served glasses of water, but it took fifteen minutes before our order was taken...and we had our menus closed for about 12 of those minutes.  My waitress was not familiar with the wines they were serving and more importantly the food that they were serving. I do not eat any sugar, so I asked about the duck salad warning her I can only eat very little sugar.  I asked her what was in it, she couldn't tell me specifically, just said  vegetables and duck.  I asked her about the sauce, she said it was not sweet, I asked her if the sauce could be put on the side, she said, ""No.""  However, she came with the alternative that the chef prepare the Duck salad without using sugar. I accepted and ordered the duck salad with 3 star spice.  I then asked about the wines, she knew nothing about wines (fine, I understand not everyone drinks) and quietly flipped over the menu that showed ""Pairings"".  My husband ordered the Tom Yum Kai and Pork Ka Pow , without any modifications other than 3 star spice.  We shared the soup and agreed that if was mostly a premade soup base, which they used too much of.  The broth was too intense, yet not what I would think was 3 star spiciness.   His Ka Pow was very bland and had no resemblance to the Ka Pows we've ordered at other places or made at home.  We had to ask for the chili condiment kit to adjust the spice.  My duck salad was very disappointing given the price and alterations she said they could do...Very little duck, atleast a half mango (she didn't mention there was fruit- again I can't eat sugar including sweet fruit, and then the salad was dressed in a very sweet sauce...even my husband who is sugar tolerant said it was too sweet).

1733011,2012-04-07,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"I've been here maybe 4-5 times and I must say the quality seems to have gone downhill. I always order the pineapple fried rice and this time it tasted blah and they added carrots to it and I'm not sure why... Messed up on our second 2nd order (which should have been sea bass in garlic sauce, which the first time we ordered it was a very small plate for $17) in which we didn't try. Kinda wish we did because our 3rd order came out cold (spicy duck) so we sent it back and decided to stick with the pineapple fried rice.

Good thing I suppose because I had planned on using a $30 living social deal, but my friends used a groupon now deal and they refused to let us use both, even though it was separate checks and my friends came in and ordered way before we got there. They told us we could sit elsewhere and they would take it, otherwise the ""big man upstairs"" was watching and they would get in trouble if they took both. They were nice though and even asked if we wanted to still ordered which obviously we did, but it just turned into a big disappointment.

Last visit we had similar issues (cold food that was overly salty which they tried to fix, but ended up tasting even worse, but they took it off the bill at least) and while the sea bass in garlic sauce was really good, the portion size and sticker price left us feeling like we should have just ordered more pineapple fried rice.

Unfortunately I probably won't be coming back here if I can get a refund on my livingsocial coupon, otherwise it'll probably be the last time and I'll be just going to Pin Kaow from now on.",ndhakszVplkDWU-2ApTfRw,0,0,2,H734nQg9xUKhDm8XoI85lg

I can't say there is one thing that  really stands out above the rest other than service, cleanliness, and overall price. But let's be honest, Thai food is the Mexican food of Asia. I love and crave them both...but it's really hard to differentiate oneself for any other restaurant.

1781324,2014-03-29,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"BF and I had a god-awful thai experience at Pam Real Thai recently, but were still craving a good Thai meal. A friend recommended Weera, and in we went on a Thursday evening.

Happy Hour menu of apps and half price drinks from 6:00-9:45PM, we opted for the fresh duck spring rolls ($8)- a huge portion served with a tasty marmalade-like dipping sauce. The rolls were packed with duck and fresh herbs, most notably the flavorful mint that other places skimp on or leave out all together. Definitely a dish I'd order again.

Next we shared a hot pot of tom kha kai, which was delicious and boiling hot, packed with tons of chicken, cilantro, mushrooms, and ginger. Very flavorful, really hit the spot.

BF chose the beef pad se ew entree, at the recommendation of our super-sweet server- and we were not disappointed. The noodles were super fresh and chewy, great texture that was almost like velvet. I haven't had fresher noodles since we were in Chinatown in the Bay area.

Last, we opted to box up our entree leftovers and share a dessert: mango and sticky rice. It was plated beautifully, and the flavors were spot-on: mango was perfectly ripe, rice was warm and had the perfect texture, and the sweetness was not too overwhelming. 

Service from both of the ladies working throughout our visit was top notch: drinks were refilled before they even got half empty, we were checked on repeatedly between courses, and they had radiant smiles on their faces every second. I've received lesser service at five-star with much higher price tags (and expectations). The service here was genuinely the absolute best I've had in recent memory- and their food was top of the line, too. Food is priced well: for all of the above, our bill was under $40 before tip.

1805680,2016-04-11,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"We ordered delivery from here twice while we were on vacation in Las Vegas. We were happy that they delivered to the Westgate Resort, though I had to meet them outside the hotel because they aren't allowed to deliver to the rooms apparently. They will instruct you to meet them at the valet parking (this is the main entrance to the hotel on the west side). However, it would be much smarter to meet guests either at the North Tower or East Tower entrance. It's less busy here and more convenient access from the guest rooms. Sometimes the valet/main entrance area has 50+ cars including buses and taxis moving in and out. Not to mention that it's a hike from here back to your room. The North or East Tower Entrances would be much more convenient for their customers, which should be the focus. However, delivery was quite fast and the food was great. 

During our two meals, we had the Mongolian beef, BBQ pork, beef stir fry with garlic pepper sauce (excellent), seafood soup w/shrimp, spicy pork, egg rolls, and papaya salad. Everything was very tasty, though my wife thought the papaya salad wasn't consistent with the Isaan-style papaya salad she's used to. And I wouldn't recommend the Mongolian beef as it is nowhere near as good as most Mongolian beef that I've had at Chinese restaurants. And that's probably the key - this is a Thai restaurant and the Mongolian beef is a Chinese (or Chinese-American) dish. The beef stir fry with garlic pepper sauce however was excellent. The Thai egg rolls also excellent. 

The total came to $50 on one occasion and $60 on the 2nd occasion. Which I think is a bit pricey for 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, and no drinks/desert. So minus -1 star for being a bit over priced.  Recommended.",kSLfk4whdtPny5H2UunKaQ,1,1,4,9OigXU3XGVJZ0bUlGRoKag

Crab sticks- long thin deep fried rolls with crab meat inside served with a sweet sauce. Watch out! This one was pretty hot when it arrived at our table so wait a little for it to cool down. If your fingers find it hot, your tongue will hate you if you can't practice delayed gratification. It's delicious, with a crispy exterior and delicious crab meat inside. 

Pad See Ew with chicken- I thought this was decent. But then again, I don't know how you can screw up pad see ew. Or can you? Not bad although I've had better. No praises but also no complaints. 

Red Curry with Chicken- A tad watery for me but great flavor. I couldn't stop eating it. So good. Love the bamboo slices so much I almost neglected the chicken.

Thai iced tea here is super sweet. I always crave one when I'm eating at a Thai restuarant but I had to water it down to drink it. But then again, maybe it's me. My tolerance for sweets probably went down as I find a lot of things too sweet lately.

Food has always been good but the place went from casual, quick food to more modern and have more unique items. The new design is very pretty, more modern, brighter, nice and clean. They also expanded so the restaurant is larger now, great for large and small parties. 

We were greeted immediately, water was brought out as soon as we sat down. Their Thai Tea is soooo good, you can clearly smell and taste the tea and not too sweet to where you get sick of it easily, plus the tea came in a large glass, definitely bigger than other places. Our waitress Arunothai was so nice, she made recommendations, answered questions and was so patient as we looked through our menu (their menu is huge! so many options!!).

They have the big menu and they have a smaller brown menu that you should definitely ask for, our waitress said the items on the brown menu are authentic Thai items. 

We ordered total of 7 items and the two that stood out were the Pork Liver Larb and the Fried Catfish Papaya Salad. The larb is cooked medium based on our server's reccomendation, and it was delicious, the liver was so soft, the sauce tasted amazing! This dish was gone pretty quickly! The catfish was very different, have never had something like this. The catfish is shredded and mixed with...something...then deep fried with papaya salad on top with salted duck egg and pork skin on the side. First of all this dish is HUGE, definitely can be shared. We love papaya salad, order it every time we go eat Thai, the catfish and the salted egg are nice addition of the traditional salad.  

The stir fried clams was also very good, lots of clams compared to other places where you get a bunch of empty shells. The sauce was amazing, sweet and salty, and a little spicy! We ordered 8 items but only 7 was brought out, which was fine since we were stuffed.

Spring rolls and peanut sauce were awesome as well. The rolls were nice, crispy, and very fresh. The sauce was flavorful and did not taste like it was previously stored.

I have been here about 10 times.  On my last visit, I ordered a pad-thai with no spices (like I always do).  The dish came out very spicy, uneatable for me.  I told the waitress, who said that I couldn't send the dish back.  I told her to ask the manager, which she did, and was told I had to accept the dish.  I said it was too spicy, I don't eat spices and this wasn't what I ordered, so I wasn't paying for it.  She said okay, so I ate my other (I was really hungry) dishes and left for the Hawaiian place next door (which is amazing).

That was the most absurd experience I've ever had in a restaurant.

The food:

We decided to do family style. We ordered the Tom Yum Kah ( Tom yum soup with coconut milk), panang curry, pad thai and tung tongs. 

Disclosure: I love tom yum kah or kai and I ordered every time I dine at a Thai restaurant. The tom yum kah is good. I have notice that every Thai restaurant have a different spin on their tom yum kah. Some add more coconut milk, some add less and some are well balanced. This restaurant goes light on the coconut milk which is great for those who don't like too much. I prefer the creamy taste of the coconut milk so I couldn't say I love it. 

The panang curry is a sweeter nutty peanut version of the other curries. It was my first time trying it and it was good. I prefer the yellow curry over panang curry. Again, this girl loves her coconut milk. 

The pad thai is exquisite. Order yourself a plate, you won't regret it. 

The tung tongs are so cute! A friend of mine ordered them because he wanted to take a picture of them. They are taste just like regular gyoza or fried dumplings.",S0sLuv9nad0w2_HZc5EOYA,0,1,4,DnhHWIo6nQh9enYWqDZwvg

So I took advantage of the yelp deal, ($10 for $20 worth of food) there wasn't any problem at the restaurant using this deal. simple, no hassle. 
The food was amazing. We got three appetizers because there was a photo of happy hour specials for $3.33 between 5-8pm. The crab rangoon, crispy shrimp and dynamite chicken wings. all amazing and delicious. especially loved the crab Rangoon. 
for the entree we took misti's suggestion and decided to split green curry, and we got it with duck at a level 3 spiciness. It really wasn't spicy at all but it was SOOO good.  indeed the best green curry Ive had in Vegas, with huge chunks of eggplant and duck meat. mmm. I also had the Harney & Sons tea, it was very good. 
Everything was perfect except for the bill at the end of the meal. They did take off the $20 from the coupon, but the appetizers were not $3.33 each. When I asked the waitress about it she said that they no longer did happy hour. So I said to her, but I asked at the beginning of the meal if there was happy hour and you guys said there was...she looked confused and blank, and apologized that her English wasn't that good. I believe it was the drink waitress who said the deal was valid and the food waitress that said it wasn't but in the end, we paid $21 for appetizers instead of $10, which was really disappointing. 
Still, I'll go back, it was fun to discover a new place, (and there was a promising korean restaurant next door too!) I recommend you check it out too, but don't count on happy hour appetizer specials. at least, get it in writing first. :P",oUE-E24uKX9WluyW145ndg,0,0,4,lrGqfP_6Rcxz2XCl9BzP6A

I recommend trying the pork jerky.  And let me know if you actually get anything spicy here.  We asked for food as spicy as possible and it came out not so spicy.  But maybe we did not look Thai enough?

I usually use either Panang or Red Curry w/Tofu and a Tom Yum Soup w/Chicken as my lab standards. After 4 meals at Weera Thai over the past month, it has because obvious that Weera Thai is my (current) favorite!

Very generous portions and generous proteins in the portions. A large Tom Yum w/Chicken is easily a meal in itself, as is the Panang Curry w/Tofu. Flavor and thickness of curry is spot on, and the price is the best quality-to-value Thai in town. The Tom Yum broth is kept hot in a flame-pot. 

The restaurant is extremely clean, the waitstaff and chef are super nice, and their Sahara Avenue location has proven to be very convenient, inspiring some last-minute Weera Thai redirection when deciding where to eat. Cleanliness was the reason we dumped our old Thai restaurant crush in search of a new one. Weera in love!

I am so confident in Weera Thai that I took my visiting East Coast family (party of 12) there for dinner over the holidays. One of my sisters and brother-in-laws declared Weera's Tom Kha as the best they'd ever had in their lives.

  I chose menu item F-6 (Spicy Thai Holy Basil with chicken) -which was stir fried chicken, onions, chili, and Thai holy basil leaves. The chicken itself was sliced -not ground and was a little tough and dry. The dish appeared to be swimming in grease -instead of a sauce. I didn't know sliced chicken could be greasy... 

The level 3 spice out of 5 barely registered as spicy, and as a result the food was bland. Why do most Thai places skimp on basil? I thought this was a dish that featured basil?  Instead, I found myself on the hunt looking for basil underneath the rubbery overcooked chicken. 

The restaurant itself is clean, quaint, and inviting. My order was done in 10 minutes which was nice considering I was on my lunch break. However, I would rather they took their time to make sure the dish actually tasted good.

I'm a huge fan of steamed fish in the first place because it's not greasy, but the bass is served on top of a a broth that is sweet with just a slight tang to it.  That was the first dish to go.

Side note, they have bottles of chinese wine on display. Go ahead and order one, they are not expensive at all and a great complement to the meal.

I also got the pad se ew (yes that can't be spelled correct) and the grilled beef salad.  No complaints.

This place is heaven. The food is unparalleled. I can barely enjoy Thai food elsewhere, even in other states, including LA. I've been eating here since like 2010.

But last time I called to order (which is like once a week if you know my love of Thai food), I was disclosed that many options I long consumed under the title of ""vegetarian"" weren't & couldn't be made specially for me, either, because of shrimp paste, fish sauce, chicken stock, etc. that were already added beforehand.

Just heartbreaking.

Glad they were honest, but wish I'd known sooner.

Please fix your veg menu & be able to accommodate! I miss your food dearly. It wouldn't take much to carry veggie stock for your soups, to reserve a portion of pad thai base without fish sauce/add it to the portion itself instead, and to have at least ONE CURRY without shrimp paste for your vegs!

2621872,2011-08-15,2,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"Today Weera has shown me that they are very interested in offering Las Vegas good, fairly authentic Thai food.  Every time I come here, the owner asks me if there is anything he can do better.  And every time I come here, the food gets better!  This is a respectful business that could easily turn into a regular spot for me.

Today I had the Rad Nah, the Pa Cha, and the Roast Duck with Weera sauce.  

The Rad Nah was spot on in the gravy department.  It was thick, tasty, and smokey.  The noodles were pretty good, and the pork was really well prepared.  I would say that Weera does a pretty good Rad Nah, and that makes me happy.  

The Roast Duck dish we had was really tasty.  It was just a bit plate of sliced duck, along with a sweeter sauce.  The duck was well prepared, not fatty or gristly.  Another solid dish for Weera.

The Pa Cha was really spot on.  The Pa Cha isn't as strong as the versions I have had at other Thai restaurants that make this wonderful Thai dish, but the fried catfish was really yummy. We ordered it a 5/5 spice level, and it was spot on with flavor and heat.  I really recommend this dish at Weera.  They do it well.

Due to the A+ service and the improved food here, I am happy to say that Weera has earned a star in my book.  I will definitely be returning more often.  I have yet to try the curries, but I believe that Weera's specialties will be the soups and the stir fry dishes.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,8,5,4,Dhp2agOxf_kFfVUY2CnwTw

I took Misti's advice and ate the most delicious curry of my life. Duck is one of my favorite proteins, so you don't like duck, you can skip the rest of my review, but for those duck lovers out there, they keep the crispy skin on, and then pour delicious green curry all over it!! The mixed vegetables are the way to go as it makes the dish taste more fresh than a bunch of eggplant. We got everything at level 4 (out of 5) spice and it was very modest compared to other Thai restaurants in town. 

We also ordered tom yum soup (first time trying it), and pad see ew. Tom yum is an interesting soup being sour (really sour. I was puckering at almost every bite) but I don't like spitting out all the random things in the soup that look innocent, but end up being crunchy (lemongrass?). It was listed at #8 on CNN's list of 100 foods to try before you die. I've tried it, and now I'll know not to order it again. Pad see ew was standard and mango sticky rice had a pretty sour mango for a $6 dessert, although the rice was cute in the shape of a heart. Service was sweet and they made sure to ask if we had any coupons before getting our bill so as not to waste time.

The small differences in flavor I believe are a matter of personal preference.  So it really boils down to the dining experience for me.  Weera is a low-key, intimate space with soft lighting and a conservative selection of sakes and wine.  When we went, there were couples on dates, families with kids, groups of friends and a table of 6-footer models.  I think anyone would be happy with this space and food.  Service was great but quite slow on a Friday night.  

The first bite we had of their pad thai was bit of a letdown, but the next few bites we took must've had some voodoo spice or spell because we were loving it more and more.  It was a dish that did not wow you with a punch, but the flavors crept up on you like the butler on Mr. Deeds... very very sneaky.  We also had the Thai chicken wings, sauce on the side for my little man.  Bad idea.  There wasn't any flavor on the naked wing.  The final order was Crispy Pork Basil.  I haven't heard my hubby say it in a long time but he muttered ""Holy Lord God.""  He was enamored.  To me, it was very good, close to perfection with its slightly sweet buttery sauce, the balance with crisp vegetables and the yummy fried pork (normally I like to keep the sauce off fried skin to keep it crisp).  Overall though, we were very happy with the food.  They even provide kiddie plates.  50 brownie points right there!

I was greeted when I walked in and told to sit anywhere. The nice lady came over brought me water. I ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken, pad see ew with beef and a Thai iced tea. 

The pineapple fried rice is amazing you have your choice of meat. The rice is cooked with yellow curry, big chunks of tomatoes, big chunks of pineapple, cashews and green onion. Huge serving. I chose chicken which was big chunks. 

Pad see ew is sooo good too! Be careful there are two one is made with curry. It is stated. This one is the regular you pick your choice of meat. Large flat noodles and bok choi in a brown sauce with you meat. I chose beef it compliments the everything very well. Huge servings.

I was going to order egg rolls but I forgot. I always order Thai iced tea it's always soooo good.  I took lots of left overs home but that was the plan. Both heat up nicely and gave me enough for 3 other meals.

I would say, LOS is King of Thai food in Vegas (not anymore)
Weera Thai is the Queen.
Le Thai is a prodigal son.

I have eaten several times at Weera, and I have to admire them because;

1. portion is much bigger than LOS.
2. price is cheaper than LOS.
3. and best of all, they use really good vegetables. It doesn't simply mean it's fresh. They are tasty. Tomatoes, eggplants, etc etc,, Sweet and TASTY,,, I wonder where they get these veggies. Great that they don't overcook veggies, too.

Oh, yes, you gotta try their coconut ice cream. It's the best I have ever eaten.
Thai ice tea/coffee is dense and really good. 

Atmosphere and the location is not that great, but I don't care.

I will definitely go back.",LwtKrQPMN78mkSIozJK3Lg,5,0,5,0Lpk0IKh467-mJSAC5Dmcw

2849928,2016-07-28,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"OMG!! Hands down, this is officially theeeee best thai food place I've eaten at...EVER!! From the service to decor to the taste, everything was superb. 

It was late when my friend and I yelped this place. Pics were enticing and reviews were great. We had a little over an hour before closing and rushed over. It's off the strip in a neighborhood not too far from chinatown. 

Walked in, was immediately greeted with smiles and escorted to our table. Our waiter was the best! He was so attentive and helpful. He was patient even though we asked several questions about unfamiliar dishes. He offered honest suggestions and had a smile to go with each one. We were curious, indecisive, and wanted leftovers. We ordered yellow curry w/ shrimp, spicy basil fried rice w/ shrimp, crab rolls, chicken fried rice, chicken pad thai, mango sticky rice, and a few alcoholic beverages to go with our meals. Mmm...mmm...good is all we could say. Every forkful was flavorful. 

Curry was the right consistency. It was loaded with plump shrimp, potatoes, and carrots. The other noodle and rice dishes were full of fresh veggies and herbs. Portions were large and they did not skimp on meat. The crab rolls were like long egg rolls. They were a tiny bit fishy and may have been better if we ate them right away. Instead, my friend was busy sipping her wine and I, my special menu mojito with fresh chunks of mango. Yum...theee best!! The late night happy hour made them even better. We had plenty of leftovers to take back to the hotel. My friend's boys were still up and ready to eat when we returned. They had never eaten thai food, tried and liked everything. The next day, leftovers were devoured by all of us. 

As for the restaurant...decor was gorgeous and authentic. Lights were dim, service was quick. There was plenty of tables and the restaurant was clean. The menu is large!! There is lots to choose from. Excellent recommendation for locals. I will definitely return next time I visit Vegas.",1PfEtkSwdXiyeIqExpeKOA,2,2,5,dNT7Dll0qrhrs8AoCkxZOw

Being Thai and understanding how the food is going to taste gives you high expectations of any Thai restaurant. But Weera just misses the mark. I took my mom here and we order a lot of food to eat. The portions were humongous! Which can be a good or bad thing. We did the appetizer combo. But the Crab Rangoon was all cream cheese and no crab. The dipping sauces confusing. My moms pork came out and it was dry and overcooked. They charged $3 for sticky rice. But I get it, it's a restaurant. My duck noodle soup was not what I expected. The soup was so...bland. It was not what I wanted so I just took it home to fix it. 

Overall, if you're not Thai or have super high expectations, I would recommend the lunch special. It's good pricing. But the rest is a bit much for not so over the top food.",yxtwZzmnCYiMatSeT65rAA,0,0,2,XDk2F4zyTY5dVc0W8vlCAw

I can't eat mushrooms. I wasn't expecting mushrooms since they aren't a vegetable and weren't listed. So I explained the situation and Weera promptly refunded my credit card for the cost of the soup... 

HOWEVER what really impressed me was following that conversation they went online (I order online) and updated their whole menu with the ingredients to protect anyone with food allergies in the future. That is what I'm talking about people! Customer service at its finest!

Just not impressed at all. Sorry, not sorry.

Positives:
(+) Love the decor! Place was very clean and beautifully decorated. Love all the gold gilding in the wall art and sculptures. Very, very Thai atmosphere.
(+) Pad See Ew was pretty good. Probably in the top 5 I've had in the city, but nothing to lose it over.

Not so positives:
(-) Service was alright, but quite slow, especially considering that the place was nearly empty on a Monday afternoon. 
(-) Kao Moo Dang tasted good, but portion size was pretty underwhelming. Very unsatisfying and disappointing. 
(-) Ordered Pad See Ew with no veggies and still got plenty of veggies. After the long wait I certainly was not going to send it back. 

This wasn't a terrible experience. I guess underwhelming and disappointing would probably be more accurate. There are just too many good Thai places in the city to even entertain a repeat visit.

As I lay in the hotel bed on my tummy browsing yelp for good yummy vegas eats. I couldn't decide between  between Thai food or indian food. Hmmm...which one?

Order was successfully placed with a long 45 minute wait. Oh boy the nervousness kicked in..."" I hope this food is good."" 
 
I reminisced about my day at I.B.S. What a spectacular day it had been! My smile was quite frozen in place after meeting Ty Pennington. My 1st real up close celebrity meeting. My thoughts were eventually interupted by my 2 year old who called me from his ipad. My little precious nephew. Never fails to make me smile. He kept me busy until *ding dong* ""Yesss"" the food was here. With a quick bye I raced to the kitchen. 
Standing over the dining table. I reached into the double bagged goodness. Everything was wrapped great. Out came the Thai teas. It almost felt like xmas. Unwrapping all the goodness. I opened the sticky rice mango dessert. Yes!!! Im guilty. I had dessert with dinner. I couldn't get enough of the rice and coconut flavor with a bite of sweet ripe mango. I felt I had landed in tropical heaven. 
Just when things couldn't get better. I opened the shrimp mango salad. Tasted very similar to papaya salad. But with huggggggeee shrimp (which I didn't eat) and loads of cashews. The combinations were orgasmic. Ba baM! 
The pad see ew was yum. Only one bite. I was 2 busy drooling over the mango goodness. Taking one bite of salad and another Bite of sticky rice. It was a tie between both!!!!

2927284,2014-11-30,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"This is officially one of my top 3 favorite Thai restaurants here! 

We came here last night and ordered Beef Panang Curry, Rainbow Fried Rice, and Tom Yum Kai soup. The soup was super flavorful and had the perfect amount of spice. The thought of it makes my mouth water! The Rainbow rice was a little too sweet for me, but I could see it being a popular dish. My boyfriend liked it, but I liked it better without the pineapple bits. The Panang Curry was to die for!! After our first bite we both just stared at each other and said, ""oh my god."" I don't know what kind of coconut milk they used but it was probably the best Panang curry I've had here. We got it in a spice level 3 (out of 5), but I'd probably get it in a 4 next time because I think it'd be even more amazing with just a little more spice added. It came with a side if white rice, but after we ate all of it we ended up pouring it on top of the Rainbow rice which proved to be a good idea. 

Since we ate so much rice, we got full pretty fast and got a little of everything to go. Needless to say I'm pretty excited to eat leftovers tonight!

I will say it: I take Vietnamese over Thai any day of the week. Not even looking back, asking questions or wondering what I missed.
Because in my experience - I never really missed much.

Don't get me wrong; I enjoy pads, tom kah kai, curries and papaya salad once in a while, and really, nothing is wrong with them. They are even quite good, most of the time. But what makes me really sad is that I KNOW that they are only the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many, many other treasures to be found. Well, eaten. But most places don't bother, or choose to ""hide"" these culinary pearls in secret menus that I am too scared to request upon ordering after being told once that they don't exist.

Bummer.

Now you can lure me in anyway. And Weera Thai did just that, with the promise of Issan food. Northern Thai Issan cuisine is more sour and spicy than Central Thai food and is cooked in hot chili peppers, rice powder, served with sticky rice. The result? My nom tok which was thinly sliced grilled beef with rice powder, spices, lime juice and chili. Just to die for, and accompanied by the best tamarind-based sauce ever. There are a whole variety of similar dishes using beef, pork, duck and fish.

Not in the mood for Issan?
What about crispy pilot fish stir fried with Thai holy basil? Or ground pork stir fried with Thai holy basil & preserved duck egg? Or squid sauteed in a garlic, cilantro and pepper sauce?

And for the least adventurous, Weeara does classics as well, and perfectly so. The simple spring rolls and the crab sticks we ordered were by far the best I have ever had. Fresh and vibrant - they redefined what they could be in the best of worlds. Wide rice noodles had just the right bite, and the green curry of my friend was outstanding.

We ordered:
- Thai Style Chicken Fried Rice
- Chicken Pad Thai
- Chicken Green Curry
- Beef Salad
- Shrimp Fried Rice

The service here is good but the food is not good. VERY DISAPPOINTED. The food didn't taste good at all. It only has little flavor and not as tasty. When I go to thai restaurants, I always order the Chicken Pad Thai. At Weera Thai, everything is the opposite. The pad thai noodles is big and flat. The flavor of it doesn't taste good.

Also, if you want additional rice, you have to pay $4 for a medium sized bowl. Forget it. Instead, we order Shrimp Fried Rice and it is much more portion than that medium sized plain rice. 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND GOING TO THIS RESTAURANT! The food is NOT GOOD! The portion size is SMALL! The food here is EXPENSIVE!

We also ordered this shrimp that is wrap in crispy noodle which is really great and the papaya salad. They also have happy hour!!!! I also liked the crab fried rice!! I cant say much about the food because it didnt really surprised me on how good it was. 

The service...well theres this one guy who is very attentive!! He's the only guy I saw checking up on everyone. Our other server (wearing glasses) shes also pretty nice...but I think they could do better especially how if we mentioned their names on survey they get a trip to Disney!!

It was a joint birthday dinner for yours truly and three other celebrants. We were a party of 15, plus a baby... That undertaking alone deserves 5 stars. Sure, there were a couple of entree mixups and blunders on the receipts (yes plural, we were one of those tables that night, sorry), but overall we received attentive and friendly service from the waitstaff. 

The red interior with golden trimmings is such an elegant look. Definitely complemented our photos for the night. From the chandeliers to the miniature bells in the divider wall, you can tell they put effort into what I'm assuming is a fairly recent renovation.

Food was delicious and comparable to most Thai restaurants. The plating made the cuisine all the more appetizing. I tried a few, but here are some highlights:

-- Sliced duck (the sauce made it taste less gamey)
-- Yellow curry (holy smokes, probably the biggest portion I've seen)
-- Pad See Ew with tofu (I confess that this my go-to)
-- Durian dessert (deep fried with a dipping sauce)

We ordered to eat family style and got:  Calamari, Yellow Chicken Curry, Duck Pad Thai, Seafood Pad Thai, Fresh Spring Rolls, Spicy Eggplant and the Mango with Sweet Rice for dessert.  Everything was delicious.  The Seafood PT had calamari w/o the batter and even had muscles.  Something out of the ordinary for me, a seafood lover.  The Eggplant had a good kick to it, but delicious and is great to have as a veggie dish.
The Crabstick appetizer is very popular because we originally ordered it to start with, but they were out.  So probably a must try!
The 3 stars is only because of it's location, parking, and distance from my house.  I feel as though with all the competing restaurants in Las Vegas, I'm sure to find one just as good closer to me.",ODW1a9Kz522Ltv6eK8_Gmg,0,0,3,-IdTSP2hMo_o8HWo2Hx6Fg

As soon as you walk in the place is nicely decorated with the theme that seemed like black and red. It was fancier than I thought it would be. The waiters were dressed nicely and they had nice decor on the walls, TV, and nice murals on the wall. They also had some fancy chandeliers hanging up. The place looked very clean overall. 

Since our purpose here was for lunch, we had ordered from the lunch menu. I ended up getting the tom kha with rice noodle. My friends ordered the ground beef with basil and chicken panang. They first served us with the side of soup and salad. The salad dressing was so good!! And for the soup, they served tom kha! Which was nice, since I thought they would just include some cheap soup that included with our meal. When our meals came out, they were a big portion! much bigger than we thought. The food was packed with flavor and I loved my order! 

My friends and I also got a free thai tea when we check in on yet, how great is that! Also our server ying was super helpful and patient with us.

3720789,2018-04-14,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"With a redesigned interior that adds a genuine Thai feel to it, Weera Thai is a nice go-to place for lunch or dinner. Since it was our last day in Vegas, my family and I decided to head to this Thai place (recommended to us by one of my father's friends). It sure is a great place for lunch.

SERVICE: 85 / 100
The servers were quick and attentive to our needs, refilling water whenever it was empty, and fulfilling our requests for additional napkins or condiments. That's about it; they were nice, but not intimate and conversational.

FOOD: 75 / 100
Salad and Soup: This was included as part of the lunch special. While the greens were fresh and the cherry tomatoes were nice and sweet, the zesty vinaigrette proved to be overly sweet and overpowered the freshness. The soup had a nice kick of spice, but otherwise lacked depth of flavor. The tofu was unnecessary. Overall, not a bad side to the lunch special, but simple is better.

Fried Calamari: The Calamari was nice and crunchy, yet maintained its al dente on the inside. The flavor was nice and subtle, and the dipping sauces elevate the calamari to a whole new level!

Weera Sampler Plate: The crab rangoon weirdly felt out of place, as rangoon is not a side dish Thai people usually eat. That being said, avoid it at all costs; very bland, lacks in flavor, and full of cream cheese! The spring roll (no, it isn't fried) was very fresh and minty, though note that without the dipping sauce, the mint overpowers your mouth fairly quickly. Sadly, I was unable to try the chicken wings and the crab sticks, as my family demolished them!

Beef Pad Thai: Pad Thai is a classic dish, and the flavors have replicated well here. While a tad bit too sweet for my tastes and the beef quite dry, the spice is there and the overall flavor is something that only genuine Thai chefs can replicate. Noodles were nice and al dente.

VALUE: 80 / 100
Had we forgone the Weera Sampler Plate, this would be an excellent value. $70 for a family of four isn't bad, but the appetizers simply don't add on to the value. The lunch specials are an amazing value; if you get the chance to stop by for lunch, do so!


OVERALL SCORE: 80 / 100
Service is fast and attentive, and the menu selection is vast! Sadly, some of the dishes are underwhelming and flavor lacked a bit in the dishes I did order. Nonetheless, this is a great go-to for lunch with their Lunch Special!

TL;DR: A nice go-to Thai place a short drive just off the Vegas Strip. You can't go wrong with the value here, but choose your dishes and spiciness levels wisely.",cv5t03qvJkvdRYqh418qIg,1,0,4,yPMPz6LSXqa0EGOA_WiHZg

While no restaurant in the United States can ever be exactly like the flavors back in Thailand, this place comes really close! I actually came to eat here by happenstance. In what appears to be a sleazy strip mall, the diadem of Thai flavors is hidden amongst the now-gone seedy massage parlors. I walked into friendly greetings and a warm smile. As the years past, this restaurant has expanded into an upscale ambiance, where you can dine in dressed-up attire or gym clothes, as I have often done.

At first, I kept coming back due to their lunch specials. A heaping portion of THE BEST pad thai in the Western United States, a bowl of field greens salad, and a cup of soup de jour ranging from tom kha to tom yum to accompany the egg roll allowed this pescatarian to enjoy great food without having to pick out bits of chicken or beef or pork. I have tried other pad thai dishes in Nevada, California, and Arizona based on Yelpers in those regions and nothing has come close to the sweet and savory flavors in Weera Thai's pad thai.

Albeit the food warms the soul, I keep coming back due to the consistency that Weera Thai provides during lunch and dinner. Yeah you get the occasional heavy hand with the same spice level, but the food and customer service always remains top notch. Refills of water without asking, new silverware and plates between courses, and a rotating ""specials"" menu will have you asking how such a 5-star location continues growing its business off the Strip.

Chef Peter and Sasi is the duo you wish to grow up and emulate when you find that special someone. Their hearts are just as big as their creative ingenuity. You are always treated with the utmost respect from the staff, even the people that yell angry epithets at them for their food not coming out as quickly as fast food. They are always appreciative of your business, feedback, and happy demeanor after sharing a meal with them. Kudos to Weera Thai.

Since we have a rental car, it wasn't a big deal driving there.  The place is located in a quiet strip mall with tons of parking.

My husband was craving for some real coconut and being from the Philippine Island, we grew up eating this stuff.  I was really surprised that it tasted exactly like it was in the islands - fresh, sweet and refreshing.  If I didn't eat too much, I can probably finish another one.  So when you come, make sure you order that!

To eat, we had the Crispy Duck Salad and the Garlic SeaBass.  If you know me, crispy duck and sea bass are two of my favorite things!   They were wonderful.  The servings were enormous and can actually feed 4 people total.   We decided we didn't want to waste any food so we sat there for hours and savored our food down to the last morsel.

Also (I know this is going to sound weird) but I really appreciated that the bathrooms were in the back and had a door separating them from the restaurant. The dining area is small, and I can't stand when you can see a bathroom from where you are eating, the last thing I want to hear is a toilet flushing while I'm eating. 

Onto the food. My friend I was with had never had a papaya salad before (one of my staples when I'm eating Thai) she doesn't like spicy food, so I had to tone it down for her, we ordered 2/5, it is true Thai Chili spice, so be careful when ordering. This was perfect. I ordered the Garlic Shrimp, this was the chef's special, it wasn't your typical garlic shrimp that I'm used to ordering. The shrimp are actually pan fried and served with the shells on. I was trying to be healthy, so I was a bit disappointed when I saw that it was pan fried, but it was really good. If you're not ok with eating the shells, I wouldn't bother ordering this dish. My friend had the Tofu Panang, she raved that it was the best she has ever had. 

Their menu is $3-4 higher on each dish than other Thai places in town. They do have a full Issan style menu.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,4,2,4,7D6hmhzEwUoD7nw-jKAbnQ

When we walked inside no one was eating and I thought it was kind of odd considering it was a Saturday night.  We immediately ordered our Thai Teas and since I have been craving curry for so long I ordered the yellow curry with chicken (yes, I know I like to play it safe). For our appetizer we had the fresh spring rolls with tofu. And when I took my first bite I tasted the rice noodles and something else almost like meat. But it was actually the tofu! The peanut sauce was also a nice compliment!  Very tasty and I recommend ordering this if you're contemplating on ordering an appetizer. The curry was pretty good hardly any spice at all because I requested for level 1 (their spice scale here is 1-5). The dish also had carrots and potatoes. Does this normally come with potatoes because I wasn't expecting it at all? The servers were very friendly and checked up on us regularly. They require a $15 minimum with card or they charge you a .25 cents fee, which is not bad at all. I don't think I'd be back here again, but worth going to if you're going to use a groupon, yelp deal, or living social coupon.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,0,0,3,6sOOc26BLIDRnrzaSAgZlw
3877202,2017-06-26,2,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"Aside from Lotus of Siam, Thai restaurants in Las Vegas are a dime, a dozen. It's very difficult to differentiate Thai restaurants because after a couple of visits, they all start to meld into one another. Every restaurant offers pad thai and every restaurant offers some rendition of red, green, or yellow curry. But, at least Weera Thai attempts to satisfy both Americanized taste of Thai cuisine as well as bring in regionalized Thai tastes on their menu. For example, Weera Thai has an entire section of their menu dedicated to the Issan, northeastern region of Thailand. 

In addition to lunch specials, I love that Weera Thai has a happy hour from 4-8 pm daily. Beers and wines are $3 and appetizers such as an assortment of different mussels, chicken wings, and soups are $5-6. My favorite was the tung thong, crispy fried dumplings with shrimp and chicken with a delicious, sweet chili sauce. For additional value to your meal, mobile check-in on Yelp nets you a free Thai iced tea (one per person).

As for dishes, I'm a creature of habit and although most Thai plates are the same throughout, I've had some pretty poorly cooked noodles (the ones that just come clumped together). The pad thai is better than your average in terms of freshness of ingredients. I've always found every single time I've ordered this dish, the chicken is overcooked and rubbery, but the peanuts, bean sprouts were all placed on the side for you to mix and egg and noodles were well done. The tom yum kai was also better than your average. The panang roast duck curry came highly recommended by the waiter and was full of coconut flavor. But, for some reason, it's hard to enjoy both flavors of the curry and the duck when both are too bold for one another to go together for me. Overall, I enjoyed Weera Thai and find it as a legitimate, cheaper alternative to Lotus of Siam.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,4,3,4,4YpN2MB9k4HB6O4SSuAMPA

Weera Thai was a whole new experience on Thai food, and this started as soon as I stepped in the restaurant. (The outside signage doesn't exactly capture the magical atmosphere of inside.) The decor was plentiful, bright, and detailed. I recall reddish papered or textured walls and lots of statues/figurines. I assume it was a (super successful) aim at engulfing customers in Thai culture.

The environment was obviously stellar, but the food was 10x more so! I ordered the Pad Thai as I am not usually fond of Thai curries due to coconut after tastes. (And who doesn't love fried noodles?) Now, I am accustomed to Pad Thai dishes having strong spices/flavors, but this was like tingles-your-tongue-with-every-bite type of deliciousness. And I love how they used thicker rice noodles rather than the thin ones that most Thai restaurants go with for this dish. A different texture worked great in this case. Also, the balance of toppings (tofu, veggies, etc.) to the carb base (noodles) was spot-on. 

Our server was also super sweet and accommodating. I definitely want to go back to this restaurant the next time we find ourselves in Las Vegas.",fquTEV93jh82JYob6u0CEA,0,0,5,OIj_hA3-rtQ3vlGdhSPx_Q

3970981,2012-02-19,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"I am a fan of this small but nicely decorated Thai restaurant.  I was there for the first time--certainly not the last time--Saturday night.  I had the Yelp deal and it worked beautifully.

I started with the crab stick appetizer.  Here's how the menu describes it:  Deep fried rice paper wrapped with mix crab meat & cream sauce, served with homemade plum sauce.  When I saw 6 sticks, I thought there was no way I could eat all of them and have room for dinner.  Wrong!  They were so very tasty you could never leave one to be taken away.  The plum sauce was good, and my server brought me the hot spice holder and I used some chili paste to spice up some of the sticks.

For the main course, I ordered from the Issan (northern Thailand area) part of the menu which offers foods with more spice kick.  I got the Ped Nom Tok, and the menu describes it like this:  Sliced boneless roasted duck home made with chili paste, herbs, spices & lime juice.  I asked for a spicy level of 4 out of 5.  It was spicy, but from my little array of spices, I added some extra red pepper flakes.  The dish was superb!  The mint that garnished the dish and the raw cabbage gave you something to cool your palate when the red pepper heat got to be a bit much.

Time for dessert.  I had two things in mind.  Durian sticky rice or coconut ice cream.  I had been warned that the durian would cause horrendous breath.  Anthony Bourdain describes durian this way.  ""...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother.""  Since I was going to a show after dinner, I opted for the coconut ice cream.  It was the safer choice, and it was very good with some small chunks of coconut mixed in.

I started dinner with a Thai iced coffee and I had an order of sticky rice.

The service was fantastic.  There were three ladies who were very attentive and answered a couple of questions I had.  I thought the one was going to say ""chicken"" when I opted out of the durian sticky rice dessert.  

The Yelp deal worked fine.  I paid $10 and received credit for $20 from Weera.  She took the code off my iPhone and asked me to mark the deal used which I did.

As I said before, this won't be a one time visit.  It is good, and I am a fan!!  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for letting me know this place exists.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,3,4,Qell-b8jVjjnibMNRbyKpQ

4004910,2015-06-12,8,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"Santi and I came to this Northern Thai restaurant after an extended search on Yelp. I wanted to find an authentic fare, and became intrigued after reading several reviews about their Issan cuisine. The squared-shaped interior started with center tables vertically arranged, followed by booths, wall-to-wall cultural artifacts, TV, and a small bar in the back. The atmosphere was casual with lots of foot traffic throughout the day.

The Khor Mee Yang ($9.95) arrived with strips and pieces of marinated charbroiled pork nicely blackened on the ends. The mix of tender charred, lean, and fatty textures was highly addictive, but the marinade and spicy tamarind sauce could have been better, as the level of spiciness was not as robust as I like it to be.

The Khao Pad Pla Salid ($9.50) included a huge portion of fried rice filled with deep fried salid fish, basil, and peppers. The fried rice carried a decent airy texture. Too much fish sauce made it too salty to my liking, but the fried fish was crispy, moist, plentiful, and nicely flavored. The server initially described this dish as ""spicy fried rice."" However, we didn't find a hint of heat even after we had requested these dishes to arrive Thai spicy.

Overall, portions were excellent with discernible authentic flavors. However, the level of spiciness was the absent element that could have advanced the flavors further. Contrary to other reviewers' account, our service was timely, attentive, and friendly.

Lunch or dinner: Both! I've come here for lunch, happy hour and dinner, and each time was an amazing dining experience. For best value, I'd recommend the lunch special, as it comes with soup and salad, as well as a specialty drink for only $1.50 or so. 
Drink: Thai tea! (Their tea wasn't overly sweet like some others I've tried and comes in a giant glass. Soooo good!)
Happy hour: Get the authentic Thai beer - Singha or Chang beer, or both. 
Appetizer: do yourself a favor and get the fresh spring roll. It was such a large dish for an appetizer and the peanut sauce that comes with it is the bee's knees. I got this every time I came here.
Main course: Try the Tom yum soup with noodles or the Kao Soy (spicy). The fried rice is on its own level of amazing so try that too if you can! What I loved about this place is you can adjust the level of spiciness for any dish. 
Dessert: save some room for the mango with coconut sticky rice. It is well worth it! 

You honestly can't go wrong with anything here, so just pick something and enjoy!! 
I'm so sad I don't live here so I can't come back more often. I think I am actually in love with this restaurant.

Our dinner included the specialty that everyone who comes here seems to talk about fried papaya salad, amazing but eat it fast because after it cools not as good.  Pork Larb, a new dish for me it is a citrusy  mint meat dish, delish when eaten over rice and definite redo.  Panange chicken curry my boyfriends favorite dish quite good here.  Fried Mussels coated in egg batter, not my favorite dish seemed overly oily but the size of the mussels were large!  We finished with the sticky rice and mango, mango perfectly ripe and the creamy flavored rice do to perfection.

I tried a bit of everything then went back for seconds on the items I liked best which was everything except one so needless to say I was beyond stuffed.  I think this place is gonna give Lotus a run for it's money.  I will defiantly be back!",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,0,0,5,qHonFWsW0SUNx7eb-QoLVw

We were greeted and seated. There were a lot of choices and we went during lunch so they had their lunch specials. Ordered the Panang Curry and it was sooooooo yummy!!! The wait time for the food was a little overdue but food was really great. My boyfriend got their green curry too and rated the spiciness level as Thai spicy. We also got their mangoes with sticky rice and it was fresh. If I'm coming to Vegas again I'll visit here!,yNQU9f5QdqS-AEY2Gj7KxA,1,3,4,o10JKSwRNfvQdvse-Fi3KQ
4147536,2012-05-15,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"I fear I may be falling into a trend.  I have reviewed several other Thai restaurants and this will not be my last on the subject.  It turns out I happen to like Thai food.  Quite a lot in fact.  Weera Thai is one of my favorites.  The food here is more flavorful than that at Pad Thai restaurant.  Especially when it comes to spice.  Their spice level goes up to five though I am only willing to try a three at this point.  After that, it becomes too much for me.  Typically though, I order no spice.  I like to let the true flavor of the meal shine through and not be concealed by overbearing heat.  Some dishes just don't need the heat.  Like sweet and sour chicken.  Let the sweet and sour stand on its own.  The tempura is perfect thickness.  The sauce is tangy.  They vegetables are crisp and fresh.  No change necessary.  The pad thai here is some of the best I have had.  The rice noodles are chewy.  The flavors are intense.  The chicken is tender.  A great dish.  So far the only dish I have ordered that I did not enjoy is the pepper garlic chicken.  Actually, I ordered beef and received chicken.  I did not care for it at all.  First of all, I prefer white meat when eating chicken.  This was fatty dark meat.  Second, I was not expecting black pepper.  I thought it would be very garlicy with fresh chili peppers.  I don't care for the taste of massive amounts of black peppercorn.  I will not order that again.  

All of the lunch specials are served with steamed rice (unless noted otherwise), an egg roll and a small salad.  For a price ranging from $6.99 to $7.99, depending on your choice of protein, Weera Thai is a little higher priced than some other Thai options but the price shine through in the quality.  This is one of my go to places for Thai take-out in regular rotation.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,2,4,oiz1psX8wbj7t_hHmPjvOg

The guy delivers around 10, and when we get around to eating we see that they left out a thai tea. I paid for it, but they left it out, and they were already closed. Thank goodness I ordered from eat24 cuz the guy took it off for me. Fast forward to today and I really wanted thai food so I tried them one more time. Ordered online, and this time I decided to have my hubby pick it up. He got there and they asked him for his credit card. I already paid online. Basically I was charged twice. Is everyone over there new and they don't know to check if things have already been paid for? Why does the service suck so much these days?

4238480,2014-10-24,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"I'm totally in love w/ Weera Thai, 2yrs ago my department decided to try something new for lunch. So we ordered from Were a Thai for the 1st time: GREAT lunch special, a entree, salad, egg roll AND soup. Yessssssss, all for $8.50 I was hooked. 

To us born Americans Thai for is well known for PAD THAI and Weera Thai does not disappoint. Noodles are aldente, veggies are crisp, meat juicy and tender and peanuts on top CRUNCHY. We eat w/ our eyes right? The plate is very colorful, it's so fresh looking, steam rising from your pile of noodles, I wanted t dive in head first. Be careful when you order HEAT aka ""SpicYness"", I'm all about spicy food and then I met my match. I asked for a level of 5, thinking that it was going to be some type of mediocre heat, baaaaaaaaby I couldn't finished my food was so hot. My eyes got watery, nose started dripping and I started sweating. BUT I couldn't stop eating it was so good. 

If you find yourself on Sahara/Valley View try out Weera Thai, if you are in fear of paying full price for something you may not like then go at lunchtime (you get a lot of food w/ the lunch special) or grab the Groupon or Yelp deal. If you are a foodie, you will definitely enjoy Weera Thai's food. By that's only my opinion, try it out yourself and see if your opinion about this place matches my opinion about this place.",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,1,1,5,9_J8Pi_ZNWbOqH16V5Nicw

Quick service, maybe 10% occupied.  Lunch prices till 3:30.  

Lunch sized entree, smallish egg roll.  I have a food allergy to onions, so the soup was suspect - when questioned, it was removed to be sure.    

Condiment jars: Thai ""chilis"" were jalapenos in vinegar, no peanuts, three versions of red sauce.  I prefer bird's eye that chili in fish sauce.  

Heat: Ordered a 4/5.  Nice glowing heat, but half the jar of vinegar jalapenos climbed it up to face sweat under the eyes.  Happy.    

In conclusion: reliable thai food, looked at what others ordered and wondered what it was as it looked very good.  My onion allergy limits my options, but always looking for good food.",5Wg5OanfZ4-2dCxEo-qjsw,1,1,3,iOGvG40vrRpC0Iv8PR-mgQ

4429147,2016-04-04,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"Not sure what happened when they reopened after their remodeling... I would always eat here and it never made me sick but since it has reopened I have ate here 3 times and got sick every single time. This last time it gave me food poisoning and I'm currently dealing with that now, up all night throwing up. Also this place made 4 other people I know sick with food poisoning as well. Usually places will give you a bad meal once and it's over with but now there has been MULTIPLE different cases of actual food poisoning ever since Weera opened back up. I'm not sure if they had their health inspection or not but someone needs to get in there and see what the hell is going on. I'm extremely upset with this place and will never go back or eat Thai food again. I have never been so sick in my entire life or had food poisoning. All I ordered was pad Thai which I get at any Thai restaurant and it's always fine, but there's clearly something wrong going on in the kitchen. My friends ordered the sweet chili basil and different curries and got food poisoning too. We all had to go to the doctor because it was that severe. I do not recommend this place,  unless you want to be sicker than you've ever been before. Disgusting, unsanitary and the kitchen needs to be inspected. This is not cool.

The noodles were in a brown sauce and pretty good.  The duck was savory but you're caught unexpected with the sourness of the initial flavor.  The yummiest dish was the clams.

They had 9 entrees to choose from which included Tom Yum soup, salad, and fried egg roll.  The Thai Tea was only $1 at lunch.  They were located in a small strip mall on W Sahara Ave/S Valley View Blvd in Las Vegas. 

The Tom Yum soup and the salad came out at the same time.  The soup was warm and was served in a tea cup.  The salad was of good size and had a ginger dressing.

I ordered the Pepper Garlic Sauce Shrimp Thai Hot.  It came out at least 10 minutes before my friend's entree.  Awkward.  There were 6 shrimp with the tails on with carrots, mushrooms, green bell peppers, scallions.  There was no spice at all.  I had  to ask for a spicy tray.  The vegetarian egg roll was bland.  The amount of sauce with it was sparse and watery.

My friend ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry.  She ordered it mild and wished she had ordered it medium.  She took half of it home.  The server boxed the leftovers.  

I wish I had ordered one of the curries, because it looked good.  I really enjoyed my Spicy Shrimp Salad that I ordered last time.  It had the appropriate amount of heat. I would not order the Pepper Garlic Sauce Shrimp again.

They would have served us, but we found out that, despite the long conversation we had with the owner the last time we were there, they still had only a very limited selection of wine, and nothing we'd drink.  The owner suggested we go to Weera Thai, just a few doors down.  Alas, he may regret his decision to send us there.

At nearly 10 p.m., unlike the empty restaurant we'd just left, Weera was hopping, and we got the only available table.  And they had the Riesling we like to drink.

We ordered soup, and when it was served, it wasn't the Tom Kah Kai we usually order, but the Tom Yum Kai.  It was my mistake, and the waitress (owner?) offered to change it, but we decided to keep it.  And it was beyond delicious!


We shared a Mussamun Curry with beef, and for once I gave in to hubby's Pad Thai request.  Both were excellent, and the Mussamun had the distinction of having much more ""stuff"" than the vacant bowl of sauce that we've experienced at too many other Thai restaurants.

One of the example; the clams with garlic is painful to eat..why? Well because the shells are breaking into small peaces when (not carefully cooked) that can be mixed with the clam meat and when you chew it, it can really break your tooth. It happened to me with the whole serving and was truly disappointed because it was one of my most favorite food. Pad Thai is also going down the drain..
The older waitress with shoulder length haired has some kind of issue ether with me or she's just a b rude individual. She made me and my husband feel so uncomfortable when waiting to be seated which it takes a whiled, plus we have to always stand and look awkward when people are eating, just watching us stand there waiting for someone to appear and hopefully to help us. We are always so kind to all, and love the waitress with the short/short hair she's always kind and helpful beside the other one mentioned above. 
We found this place a long time ago before any upgrades were ever made. It's unfortunate that the small, cozy, great food, and great customer service is diminishing by the minute. 
My disappointment is so greatly and so upsetting to have been placed in such uncomfortable place due to the waitress that it's disgusting and needs to be taken cared of that issue. If she can't handle a busy place she needs to be out!

The food is always, hot and delicious, and they even use great little cardboard Togo boxes. This review is long overdue!***

Experience:  I came in for lunch after one of my chef friends told me to try the Crispy Duck Salad. I've tried many things here, but this is my first time trying this dish. 

Facility:  it's located in a tiny strip mall along Sahara.  It's pretty small, but it has booths, tables and chairs and even a few bar seats.  It's a quaint little place that has a small diner like feel. 

Service:  They sat me immediately in a small booth in the back. Perfect because I'm rollin solo today and prefer not to sit in the middle of the room looking lonely. 

Food:  love that they have Coke products!!!!  
Crispy Duck Salad - (5/5) wow!  He was right!  I don't think they make anything bad here. The duck is crispy and amazing!  The greens, carrots, and tomatoes are fresh and tossed with a sweet and sour type dressing with garlic and cilantro. I ordered it spicy, which adds the perfect balance of heat to the sweetness of the fresh mango!  It also has cashews that add slight decadence and nice crunch to the salad. Great dish!

Overall:  love this place! The worse part about eating here is deciding which dish to order and which dish to forego. I use them regularly to deliver food and stop in from time to time for some eats too.
Until someone shows me different...this is my number 1 Thai restaurant!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,2,5,lj1MrNbgM0nACTXIwej5Qg
4531382,2018-02-17,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"On point with the flavor and polite customer service. I tried ordering through Yelp, but the menu wasn't quite the same (either missing menu items from Weera's website and/or there were items on the Yelp order menu I didn't see on the Weera website). I ended calling Weera Thai to place my order for pick-up because I wanted to order Tom Kha soup.

Easy placing my order on a Friday night and it was ready in 15-20 minutes.

When I picked up my order, glanced around and saw that it was quite busy. Families, couples, groups of friends were enjoying their dinner in their nicely set-up restaurant. This is my 2nd time ordering for pick-up, but next time I would love to dine-in so that I can enjoy their alcoholic beverages and dessert. Plus, I love how their soup is presented when dining in.

I showed the guy the Yelp offer that if you check-in, you receive a free Thai Iced Tea, but he said it was for dine-in only so I will just use it next time I do so. He told me it is better to call in to order because Yelp doesn't really update the order menu on the app even though they've sent it in. Plus, it is better to call because you can ask for specials or what they suggest is the best dish.

I only did mild for my three dishes and it was perfect that way because I can taste the hint of spice with the Thai spices! I ordered the Tom Kha soup with tofu, Fresh Ginger Stir with shrimp, and Panang Curry with Shrimp. Order came with two smaller containers of rice. My order was enough for 2-3 people. Prices are decent from $10-28. The seafood (fish) dishes are the ones that are in the $18+ range. I've had the fish with ginger last time and it was super tasty and cooked just right!

What was nice was that the guy was very kind before I left and gave me the Thai Iced Tea. I appreciated that and that customer service and his order tips makes me want to return in the future and tell friends to go here for Thai food when in Vegas.",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,2,3,5,1ZNiPi9l7vpZDhU3iUoLUA

This was my first visit which was recommended by my friend so as far as consistency, I will update in the future. I know how much they make you walk past your tables to check on the guest but that would be the only thing I would say that was a little annoying. Only because there were only two tables in the restaurant and I had a small 1 yr old and a 2 year old who were frigidity but not anywhere else but the table. That can feel unwelcoming if I cant dine comfortably without feeling like I'm being watched every 3 minutes or so. I am not exaggerating, and I know this because there was one lady coming to fill our waters but the guy was pacing back and forth looking at our table. When it came time for the check he didn't come back which was also annoying because you would assume he would be on top of it as many times as he passed through. We had to go to the register.

I mainly visit here for the lunch specials. There are many options to choose from; you basically choose your flavor, meat, and spice level. Thai tea (without boba) can also be included in the lunch special for a dollar.

The best thing I had from here is the soft shell crab. It is definitely worth that hefty price tag! If you come here often, you should at least try it once. My favorite lunch special is the Fresh Ginger. It is not overwhelmingly ginger-y at all - they add some other vegetables in it. I usually get it with *crispy* chicken (extra charge) and it always comes out delicious.

Had...
The Thai of my life...
And I never felt this way before...
Yes, I swear...
It's the truth...
And I owe it all to you...

OK- actually, I owe it all to my grimy friend who lives in Tucson, but knows Vegas about 10x better than most natives/locals ('cause he's one of those cool geeky kids who knows everything about anything).

Pardon the ""Dirty Dancing"" reference, and cast some stones this direction for getting that garbage song stuck in your head, but it really IS the truth.  Weera Thai is the best.

I'm not going to proclaim myself as some sort of expert on Thai cuisine, and especially if we break it down to Isaan-style Thai.  Hell, I don't know the names of regions of Thailand.  All I know is that the food coming out of this kitchen shames most of the places that I've had Thai food at before.

My improper experiences have led me to believe that Thai food is always heavy, almost too thick to enjoy.  Sauces that are so rich that you leave feeling bloated and bogged down.

That notion was not present here.  Everything, from the crab stick appetizers right on down to the wonderful curries, has a lightness and delicate nature to it.  Fresh.  Flavorful.  Complex.  Satisfying, yet leaving you wanting more.  More of the fantastic flavors of Thai food without that after-Thanksgiving-dinner feel to it.

Don't get me wrong, you will walk out of here full, but not over stuffed.

Another positive: service is friendly, attentive, dare I say sweet?

Do not be weary of Weera Thai.  After trying seven things on the menu, it is clear to me that they know how to serve up some amazing Thai dishes.",15nD50SrNJN8E5DYDa0GWQ,4,4,5,zct3mQ22Zk4QfF6MvMRH0Q

I generally get their green curry, and I always tell them to add extra eggplant. The subtle sweetness, creaminess, and spice is a good combination of flavors that always leaves me wanting more. Other notably good items is their satay, pad thai, and fried rice.

Where this place shines is their lunch special. A good selection of dishes for under 10 bucks. They also toss in a salad, soup, egg roll, and a side of rice. Even though its under 10 bucks, the entree portion is always filling, and it always has the taste of being made fresh. 

Service is always good and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are enjoying yourself and the food is good.

My only occasional problem with the place is that the meat that comes in the curry is sometimes overcooked and chewy.  But it doesn't happen often, and even when it does, the curry as a whole is still awesome, and the hot(temp) curry sauce helps soften up the meat.

I have been going to this place for years, and I always look forward to going back. This place is always a good spot to go to while on or off a budget, with a wide selection of food to please everyone's pallet.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,1,0,4,UsXR1GadXqvXqbh1FSYXag

We ordered for starter, the glass noodle salad with shrimp, which was the BOMB!! So citrusy and refreshing with two large juicy shrimp, ground meat and red onion was on point and a great combination. My new favorite thai salad from now on. 

The next starter we ordered was the bbq chicken with chili sauce. This was ok and tasty. We won't order this next time. 

For our entrees, of course you can't eat Thai without ordering Tom Yum soup,  we ordered with shrimp only. By god, the shrimp in this soup are ginormous! I think there were 9 or 10 total. Each shrimp was like 3 mouthfuls. I have never went to a thai place that served shrimp this large anywhere! They were plump and juicy. The soup was level 3, it was super sour and spicy, just the way its supposed to be...I'm drooling again just thinking about it.

We ordered the red curry with tofu. This was mouthwatering. I absolutely loved the wide slices of bamboo and basil leaves, soo good. The tofu was plentiful and large as well. The curry was the perfect sweetness and the right amount of spice (level 2). Other places I've been to, were overly sweet with coconut, and was downright sickening sometimes. But they got it just right to balance with the other spicy foods we had.

And last of all, we ordered the sliced beef salad. Compared to the glass noodle salad, this was just not as good in terms of citrus. It was a bit spicy because we ordered level 3. It kind of reminded me of Vietnamese banh mi pickled veggies. So we won't order this next time.

But I have to say overall, this experience was top notch. Believe it or not, this was all for only two people for around 50 bucks. Thats not bad for 5 dishes. Given, that the starters were 6 bucks each, a really good deal. Back in LA its 50 bucks for 3 dishes, and you don't get nearly as much food.

Tom Kah Kai - Cocunut Soup with Shrimp, lemongrass and other stuff.  We ordered this 4 out of 5 spicy and it was very nice. We got the large in the tin hot pot and it was very subtle and very tasty.

Spicy Sea Bass - This dish is very, very good. Steamed sea bass served on bed of lettuce with the natural flavor of the steamed sea bass and liquid in the serving ""boat"" that it came in.  This was very tasty and one of the best type of steamed fish I have had outside of cantonese restaurants.  Again, very subtle and natural flavors.

Duck Bone Soup - As stated in the name, it's mainly a lot of duck bones with broth. The soup itself tasted good but not enough meat for my tastes. I might try the pork rib soup once it's wintertime.
Nom Tok Moo - The pork is grilled but they let meat cool down to room temp before its served. Seasoned with rice powder, spices, lime juice and chili makes for a very tasty dish.
Kana Moo Krob - Basically, fried pork belly with chinese broccoli and oyster sauce. My favorite dish here especially since the pork belly was cooked to perfection. There's also another pork belly dish called Ka Pow Moo Krob which I can't wait to try.
Green Curry - It was wonderful but the best part of the dish is the eggplant!
Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodles) - Well executed ... no complaints here.
Crab Fried Rice - Absolutely, not one piece or smidgen of crab in it. I should've sent it back.

According to one of my friends, she thought the neighborhood is kinda sketchy but I have no problems returning especially if they are still serving the fried pork belly entrees!",NOss-Yte7nmSN4BnJpLWDw,1,1,4,A9QWMAimWSTAtVpSSHkjXw

But we ended up ordered so many things crispy rice salad, catfish with salad, papaya salad, shrimp roll, spring roll, grilled pork, basil pork, fish fried rice, sticky rice and ETC (and 3 desserts).

We had the papaya salad, beef larb, tom yum kung, red curry, pad see ewe, and pineapple fried rice. The spice level ranges from 1 to 5, so we ordered everything at spicy level 4. It was enough to make my nose runny but didn't overpower the food. Mind you, we love spicy. Everything was aromatic and full of flavor. I like that they don't use the small, cheap, flavorless shrimps. The shrimps were large, succulent, and perfectly cooked. It was so satisfying. 

Service was good as well. They were very accommodating and checked up on us regularly. We ended up with plenty of leftovers and they packaged it so nicely.

They have happy hour from 7 to 9pm and let me tell you, most of the dishes we ordered that night was off the HH menu for $5 bucks and it made all our tummies smile!  We always get the papaya salad (super spicy), one of the soups, this time Tum Yum with shrimp, glass noodle salad with shrimp $5 dollars, deep fried pork ribs $5 bucks, Pad See Ew, Red curry, and chicken wings $5dollars (two orders).  Yeah we practically turned into pigs...

Ordered for pick up last night using the order option through yelp. We ordered panang beef and ka pow moo krob (flash fried pork with basil and red bell pepper) estimated time was 10 to 30 min. My girlfriend went to pick up the order and it wasnt ready yet, she was asked to sit at the bar she waited. She sat at the bar for 15 minutes and no one asked if she wanted a drink or anything. So 45 min after I placed the order it was ready and when we opened it both entrees were incorrect. My curry came with tofu, not beef which was a $2 upcharge, and we received pork and broccoli instead.  I called and let them know about the mistake, this was at 10:05pm and they close at 10pm but they offered to make us a new correct order. I go and pick it up and they repeat the correct order and I bring it home. Open it up and my curry had chicken in it and not beef, and pork dish was correct but the pork was so over done it wasnt enjoyable.

We all got the lunch special and ordered thai ice tea which was a 1.50 more with the special. We all agreed that the thai ice tea was too sweet and needed to be watered down. I think I poured half my water into the tea. All I can think about was... Man me running uphill for a mile this morning is the equivalent of 1/3rd the calories in this tea. 

I ordered the pad Thai and my friends had a variety of stuff... The pad ke pow, curries etc. I liked my pad Thai. It's on the sweeter side but it's saucy and hits the spot. I also liked my friends dishes as well. The curry was rich with heavy coconut hints. Everything  was very flavorful. The lunch special also gives you a general portion of leafy green salad... Not that iceberg lettuce situation some other restaurants give, and a bowl of delicious Tom yum soup.  

You can pick the spicyness levels of the food from 1 to 5. My friends got a level 5 for their curry but it wasn't too bad. You can definitely taste it in the end and it stays with you for a bit but I can handle it and I usually go for a medium or mild.

When there are paying guests, denying or making excuses for a simple request is a poor business move, especially if it's not compromising the integrity of the establishment or of the food. Anyhow, moving on...

Tom yum Kung: 3/5 stars. Good flavor. 

Spicy fried rice: 3/5 stars! we had the soup brought out to us first at a level 2 like the server suggested even after I told her that I can eat really spicy foods. Wasn't spicy enough so I had her tell the kitchen to make the rest of the order a level 3/5. Her response, ""well they already made the fried rice, but I can tell them to make your pad see ew spicier."" 

Hm...so then I have to add the Sambal and other spices by myself? But then it won't taste the same. Irritating.

Pad see ew: 2.5/5 stars. Bland! 

Mango sticky rice (sauce on side) : 5/5 stars! Bomb! Rice came out fresh and warm, mangos were also fresh with great flavor!

5050254,2014-01-16,3,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"I've been wanting to come to Weera for a while and found a opportunity today to pop in for their lunch specials (available everyday 11am-4pm). 

We decided to share chicken panang and tofu pad thai. 

All entrees come with soup which I was pleased that it was tom yum broth with mushrooms. the salad is standard iceburg mix, but the sesame peanutty dressing on it was better than most offer. Eggroll was standard, but decent. 

The panang was good. I like the lime shreds on top for some aromatics and the curry sauce is thick and rich. If you like a more coconut creamy panang base then you'll probably enjoy the way they style the curry here. I like all kinds, depending on my mood and today the creamy style was agreeing with me.

Tofu pad thai had decent flavor, but it was too saucy. It had a mouthfeel closer to carbonara than stir fried noodles and neither of us were fans of it. Don't know if this is just the style they do or if it was a mishap. 

The portion sizes, specially considering these are lunch specials, were very generous and come at a great price since lunch specials are $7-8. 

Thai ice tea was a good sweetness to tea ratio. Best of all, during lunch they're only $1 as well as thai ice coffee and soda. They also have a happy hour for drinks and appetizers though I missed what time that was at.

I can see potential in the food, but since one of our entrees was just alright, I think maybe a 4 is high. I will be back though as the dinner menu had some interesting Issan regional dishes and I can always be into curry!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,3,3,08kjojB3FewxL3V3brMTFg

The service was impeccable! Our server was very kind and quite attentive. Good service is hard to come by in Asian restaurants.

The food however, I was a bit under enthused over. Perhaps we didn't order the ""right"" things on the menu? I normally can't pass up my favorite Pad Prik King, but I chose the Spicy Beef Holy Basil dish--good but not satisfying. A first-time Thai food newb, my friend ordered the Chicken Pad Thai which of course was delicious--a fool-proof dish. At our table, we also had Yellow Curry & a COLD beef salad which had a lot of flavor-similarities to Papaya Salad. The Yellow Curry was good but tasted almost like packaged Korean curry mix. And the cold beef salad had a dash too much of fish sauce.

Wasn't bad food, just not as good as I was expecting. I'll stick with my usual Thai place. But I may give Weera Thai another try in the future.

The chicken tofu panang curry is to die for.  Both my GF and I loved it.  It was thick, sweet, tasty, spicy, all that a Thai dish should be.  I think we both rated it the best from the thai restaurants we've been.  The cold rolls in rice sheets were also super good, but what made it great was that warm peanut sauce that came with it.  It was peanut creamy, sweet and rich tasting.  Also a high ranker.

The duck dish was the only thing I thought was OK.  They really tried to pad their pricing by including duck dishes and Sea bass.  There's really no reason to order the duck dish, since it wasn't really very good anyways.  It was a mix of really heavy tasting thai spices, and it was too much for my senses or distinguish any kind of flavor.  Just too strong in my opinion.

Weera makes me a fan.  Also I really enjoyed the way the restaurant looked and how the walls were decorated.  It's pretty nice ambiance for a date.

Edit: 4/16 
Were Back again!  During lunch this time.  Unfortunately lunch was a big dissapointment.  The portion of the lunch specials was half the dinner portion.  To compensate they include fillers, a salad, a spring roll, a bowl of watered down tom yum soup.  Biggest issue, was the food Must have been cooked by the sous chef.  The red curry was super watery and the  fresh spring rolls that we loved so much last time, the peanut sauce was watered down and full of starch and not rich peanut flavored.  Was 100% different and not remotely good.  i probably wont come here during lunch time.

We had the shrimp papaya salad, grilled squid, and the pad kee mao.

The shrimp papaya salad was amazing! they used large shrimps and the salad dressing was not too fishy or sour. We got a spicy level 4 and it was pretty spicy so unless you can handle eating spicy food i would recommend getting a 2 or 3 and add more chilly flake to your liking. 

The grilled squid was grilled to perfection. I the texture was not too chewy and not too soft. The dipping sauce that came with the squid was very good as well. I wasn't sure what  was in it but it worked well with the squid. This is a place that i feel can be shared among 3-4 people as for 2 people it was way too much squid.

The thoughtfulness, creativity and cravability of this dish is a perfect representation of Weera.

At first I was a bit nervous because my mom and the my 3 yo aren't fans of spicy foods and Thai food in general so I was hoping there was something in the menu that would make them happy. I ordered vegetable fried rice and wonton soup. The fried rice is excellent; not overly greasy and enough egg with perfectly cooked veggies. The wonton soup was a hit too. The broth was delicious and flavorful. Took note that those 2 will be ordered again in the future. I had the shrimp pad thai and hubby got the green curry with beef, both spicy #3 (medium). Fantastic, as expected! 

The excellent service made the whole experience a 4 star. For a Friday night, we got seated right away, waited about 10 minutes for our orders, and our drinks were always filled. We were disappointed they didn't have the mango with sticky rice, but understood that it's seasonal so we got the coconut ice cream instead (also delicious and my 3 yo devoured it in minutes).

Spiced 4 out of 5, it had the perfect amount of kick that I like without leaving me in tears.  

The best part of it goes along with something I mentioned in the previous review, with the chicken being of the sliced variety and not ground up like I'm used to.  Even though I love the version of this dish at Archis and Pin Kaow who do it ground up, I always wanted to find a place who did it well with nicely sliced pieces of chicken.  Many times the restaurants that attempt it leave you with chunks of fat on the chicken still intact, or the slicing job looks more like Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw got a hold of it and not the fine carving skills of Michael Myers.  To summarize:  THIS CHICKEN WAS RIGHT!

And I finally remembered to order brown rice!   Oh and the Egg Roll was fantastic.

It was wonderful I'll admit. The Thai spring rolls were so fresh and crunchy that I only got to eat one as my 2 kids swarmed them. The pad see ew didn't disappoint as the Chinese broccoli was plentiful and the pork cooked to tender perfection. The larb I ordered with a spice level 3 and the flavor was amazing. What I love about Thai food is that unexpected matching of cool cucumbers with hearty ground chicken, spiced with peppers and cilantro. It's like comfort food with a kick.

5520617,2012-03-09,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"My mum and I came here with a Living Social coupon.  Our experience probably would have been better if I didn't have such high expectations, but it was still pretty good.  
The crab sticks ($8) we ordered didn't taste all that crabby.  The texture didn't resemble crab at all, and they had a pretty fishy flavor.  I would not order them again.
Beef Pad See Ew ($9)  was pretty standard.  I forgot to ask them to make it without sugar (most Thai places go overboard), and was pleasantly surprised when it came out just the right amount of sweet.  
What I really wanted to try here was the steamed sea bass, and that was actually better than I expected.  They have 3 varieties ($16 each).  1. Rice powder/chili/lime 2. Spicy sauce 3. Ginger.  The server recommended the spicy sauce one, so we went for it.  It came out in a soup bowl.  There was a very generous amount of broth, veggies, and the bass fillet on top.  The fish was super juicy, and flaky.  The broth was really tart, and delicious.  Perfect over rice.  
There was a lot of confusion when the check came.  That was a little annoying, especially since the restaurant was nearly empty.  The girl that brought the check forgot that we had a coupon, as did the girl we initially gave it to.  They reprinted it, but the amount was still wrong.  They reprinted it again, and we were finally able to pay.  
A-ok just about sums up the experience in general, but I will be back for more sea bass.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,0,0,3,uQ_jJ63ThapByMyI5sZigA

This place looks like a hole in the wall at a divey Vegas strip mall at first glance, but it is truly a gem you would be lucky discover. We search for great Thai restaurants on our travels and have found none anywhere in the country more exceptional than Weera Thai in Las Vegas.

The noodle dishes, rice dishes, and appetizers at Weera Thai are consistently cooked to perfection and delicious. I am one of those rare birds who orders pad Thai noodles mild and they have been superbly flavorful without being spicy every time I have had them from Weera Thai. Their fresh rolls are the BEST and live up to their title. They are rolled with the perfect amount of fresh mint, fresh vegetables, good protein, and the peanut sauce is NOMZ. /drool

A matter not oft mentioned in restaurant reviews is that of cleanliness, particularly for restrooms. If you have read our other reviews, you know nothing outranks cleanliness in importance for us. (Fact: the rating of an otherwise outstanding business plummets if their restrooms are scummy.) As if the quality, ambiance, and service were not all A+ grade, Weera Thai is also tops in cleanliness - for the dining area, flatware, visible kitchen area, and restrooms. The restrooms appear either recently remodeled or just impeccably maintained. They are well lit, well ventilated, tastefully decorated, and sparkling clean (see photos).

The glassware, too, is sparkling clean. They seem to use filtered water because the ice water you receive at Weera Thai is far better than standard gross Las Vegas tap water. 

The service at Weera Thai has been outstanding on each of our visits there. Employees are pleasant and seem to take tremendous pride in serving customers.

5774191,2015-07-19,0,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"OK, this is a tough choice for star ratings. I've gone a couple times here, once for lunch and once for dinner (just missed happy hour by 4 minutes and didn't get the benefit of the doubt on pricing).  My Thai friend wanted to eat here because they featured an Issan menu which is where she is from. 

Why the dilemma in star rating? Well, the restaurant is clean, looks like its got new flooring, tables and chairs, and nicely decorated even though its in a run down strip mall just south of Decatur on Sahara. Parking can be kind of tight.

The service for our two visits was exceptional. Seated quickly, waters brought immediately, drink orders taken within 5 minutes. Food comes quickly too. 

Food, this is where is becomes a bit muddled for me. First time I had the Chicken Pad Thai lunch special ($7.95). Comes with a salad and soup. The presentation isn't as nice as Naga Thai in Henderson. The soup is nothing special at all and the salad basic but larger. The pad thai was delicious with plenty of peanuts off to the side along with other condiments. 4/5

For dinner I had Pork Pad See Ewe (sorry my spelling sucks). Good sized portion, but like only 3 mini stalks of chinese broccoli. Wasn't the best I've had and this is one of my staple thai orders so a little disappointed. 3/5
Crab rangoon appetisers were really good, loaded with cream cheese and not so much crab but the wrapper is light and crunchy. Very good 4.5/5

My Thai friend ordered Larb Ped and Papaya Salad at lunch, and Duck Bone Soup and Beef Stew Noodle Soup for dinner, She gave them medium reviews as they weren't spicy enough for her Issan tastebuds except the Papaya Salad. I sampled the Beef Stew Noodle soup and it tasted like Thai Pho, It was good for me because it wasn't spicy. The Duck Bone Soup fired me up with just a taste of the broth. I don't like spicy food though. 

Overall, somewhere around a 3.8 star rating. I'd go back for the service and cleanliness of the restaurant, just at happy hour to take advantage of some better pricing. Wednesdays from 4-10pm is Singha beer specials, one of my favorites.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,4,1,4,TNqE7bIc8RVoxEM9tkQnyg

We ordered papaya salad and a crab wonton as appetizer. The papaya salad was ok, but spicy! The wonton was not something we liked as it has cheese in it (seemed Americanized). 

We ordered larb and kao soy noodles as the main course. I was surprised that they have lots of Thai street food here. The kao soy was not as spicy as what I expected. The broth was not as strong.

The larb was just ok.

The flavors were delicious and unique. After coming here for dinner, I was sold on this place. Thinking of how delicious this place was for an entire week, we returned here again on a Sunday for a lunch special. We ordered the red curry lunch special and the black peppered chicken which comes with a fried spring roll, salad, and a little soup. We also ordered the fresh veggie spring rolls. I wasn't a fan of anything we ordered. Everything tasted light and watered down. The black peppered chicken was far from palatable. The fresh veggie spring rolls tasted ordinary.

5918773,2012-08-24,1,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"Weera Thai is a wonderful Thai restaurant located in a section of commercial strip malls on West Sahara Ave that have seen better days.  I have been to Weera Thai a few times in the past year for dinner and most recently for lunch.  After trying out their regular menu and also one of their lunch specials, I personally think that you get more value ordering from their non-lunch specials menu, even if it is before 3pm during their lunch special promotion hours.  

So don't be cheap and walk out becuase your party came in 2 minutes past the lunch specials promotion period. The $2-3 extra you pay for each entree will defintiely get you much more food, in spite of the trade off of not getting the cup of house soup, fried egg roll and a lunch side salad (all are rather unimpressive). 

The staff have always been friendly, and deliver the prepared dishes shortly after it was cooked with care in the kitchen.  Their Green Curry is bomb.  Their Spicy Glass Noodle Salad is healthy and delicious, and can easily substitute as an entree or be shared as an appetizer salad.  The Pad See Ew is one of the best I have tried in all of Las Vegas. If you enjoy having duck, their Slice Duck (Weera Thai Style) will not disappoint.  The Thai Fish Cakes appetizer is generous and good.   The Spicy Thai Sweet Basil made with Beef lunch special was just okay at best, maybe it is better prepared with anything but beef, but it was definitely my least favorite item that I have tried at this cool restaurant.

If you have room in your tummy after your meal, consider getting their Durian over Warm Sticky Rice (assuming you do not have an Andrew Zimmern aversion to this pungent fruit).  Otherwise, get their Mango Sticky Rice during the summer, when mangos are in season.

After reading Yuhi K's review, I must remember to order the Coconut Water served in a young coconut, instead of the common Thai Iced Tea or Thai Iced Coffee, on my future visits.  And try one of the Steamed Sea Bass as recommended by Arvin when I am in the mode for fish.  When winter finally arrives, definitely going to have to try their Thai Beef Noodle Soup, the best of Las Vegas according to Theresa C.

Ambiance: 3.5/5.  Comfortable dining environment with Thai decorations and even a small television showing Thai programming featuring what appears to be a Thai food channel.  On the larger flat panel TV on the right side of the restaurant, it is usually on FoodTV or one of the professional sports games.  But the audio entertainment is provided by Sirius Radio's POP stations.

Service:  4/5.  Freindly, attentive. No complaints.

Food:  4/5.  Again, you pay slightly more but also get great value when ordering from their regular menu san the lunch specials.

Parking:  4/5.  Usually it is not a problem finding parking.

Location:  Fairly close to the Sahara exit on the I-15, so perfect if you are staying at Palace Station down the street.  Otherwise, easily accessible in a centrally convenient location for most resident of Las Vegas.

4 Stars. A no brainer.  

Side note:  The restaurant is aggressively promoting itself online, so you can usually find check-in offers (via Yelp get 10% off your bill), or promotions like Yelp Deals and occasional promotions from other competitors. Just tip on the pre-discounted price of your meal.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,4,4,dq6QzOAdVtqP89X9KN7OjA

5955528,2012-01-14,2,FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,"I almost passed on Weera, ironically, because it was offering a Yelp Deal. I assumed any business promoting itself so enthusiastically can't be that great. But then I drove past and saw that it serves Issan food and I though hmm, got to check it out.

As a lone diner I had just two dishes, the Issan green papaya salad (on the Issan menu, not to be confused with the ""regular"" papaya salad; the difference is extra fish sauce and an additional level of heat) and the Ped Nom Tak (duck.)  I asked for 4 of 5 on the spiciness scale and the chile in the papaya had me acting like a rat in a lab experiment, shocking myself again and again because I was so desperate for another bite. It was also a great value at $6.95 and I finished every last sliver.

The duck was the opposite, thank god, unctuous fork size bits of breast in a mysterious brown gravy. There was mint and garlic and what looked like ground rice but must have been crack, it was that good. Again, this lone diner finished the whole thing. Both the salad and the duck had a stack of squares of cabbage leaf in the corner of the plate, I assumed to use as a serving implement, but I needed something to soak up the heat and sop up the duck gravy so I ordered the sticky rice, a nice accompaniment.

This is a simple but pleasantly decorated restaurant with tablecloths under glass like a hundred other mom-and-pop Asian places you have visited. The service was attentive and friendly (though they had some trouble with the Yelp coupon, so pay attention to the bill). I was lucky enough to talk to the owner afterward and told him how happy he had made me. He was interested that I was in town for CES and hoped to get some more show-goers down his way. Since this was the last night of this year's show, he will have to wait for another day. I thought about those folks waiting 2 hours for a table down the street at Lotus. Their loss.

UPDATE: Yelp contacted me asking me to specifically write about my experience with the Yelp deal. It was okay. I have the Yelp app on my Droid X and was able to access the deal there and show it to the server. She copied down the code number and asked me to mark the deal as ""used"" while she was watching which I did. Then the $20 discount initially did not show up on my tab and they had to rerun it which they did... simple miscommunication at the cash register. Bottom line, I think the Yelp deal worked fine and I'd happily use one again.",1hCqFYc0oNpw7aZZBuEh6A,4,2,4,UlYw-WxkbFLJA-4mfQivwg

I ordered the chicken pad ka pow. It was really yummy and it came with an egg roll, soup, and a salad. I loved the dressing of the salad and actually finished it which I was surprised because I never really finish salads when they come with any lunch specials I order.
