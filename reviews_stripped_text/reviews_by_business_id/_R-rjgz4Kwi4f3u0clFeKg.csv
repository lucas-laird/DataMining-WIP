Had the scrambled egg breakfast and added a short stack of pancakes on my first week.  All of the food was good and tasty.

On my second visit, I had the meatloaf and enjoyed that as well, although I wasn't too much of a fan of the broccolini (overcooked a tad?).

I'm not sure why this place only gets two stars, it's certainly better than that.",ms8dOfaNO3VnAMKEnnuOqQ,0,0,4,m7R_Lre8R-3GX1mSsKyc8Q

Sid's cafe is one of the various restaurants in the Las Vegas Westgate hotel. When compared to other restaurants (which provides foods that cost an average of $30+), Sid's Cafe is a little more affordable (ranging from $15-30). 

I ordered the Hawaiian chicken sandwich ($15) which tasted good, but would rate that dish as maybe $10-12. However, it is Vegas so the prices will be high. 

The reason for the three stars is my waiter did not give me a refill on my drink, and the options on the menu is slightly limited in my opinion.",i9kwFH_qOWkueSt-hoEzkw,0,0,3,_lt7sMzP5XsyOYKJKk3bPw
2514882,2015-08-29,0,_R-rjgz4Kwi4f3u0clFeKg,"Let me start by saying the only reason this review is getting 2 stars is because of a very few things that they did right that I will explain further in this review. 

I am a vegetarian and my husband is not so eating out is usually a compromise or sometimes such as this a necessity. I arrived first since he was finishing checking in for us at the hotel. I was seated and told our server would bring our silverware and drinks shortly. While sitting there I noticed a curled up long onion that had been sitting there, for who knows how long by our salt and pepper shakers. A few minutes later a lady comes by and does take my drink order. No smile, no hello, no, welcome, nothing....just what can I get you to drink? Like I was doing her a dis service by being there! 
I reviewed the menu over and over the ONLY vegetarian item on the entire menu including appetizers, salads, and soups was a veggie burger that had a zucchini and  squash topping with some mayo. I didn't want any squash on a burger and I don't eat mayo so, that was not going to work for me. Usually they have other burger options you can just replace the veggie burgers with but, not in this case because, they all had meat factors that couldn't be removed. So, I asked the waitress if I could see a kids menu. I explained that I was a vegetarian and how the only option was the veggie burger. She gave me a dirty look and shook her head, then proceeded to tell me there are no vegetarian options on the kids menu! I know from my experience as a chef that's impossible, so I pressed further. Finally she went to the host stand, fumbled around and found me one. What do you know three options appear!!
When my husband arrived and we get ready to place our order we now have a new waiter. I decided I was going to order a grilled cheese off the kids menu and just add tomatoe. (This was a $6.99 dish keep in mind ) . He tells me he's going to charge me the adult portion because I want to add tomatoes and he will just say no ham.  I asked what item is he referring to? ""He said the ham and cheese"".   Now keep in mind they pay .$.39lb  for tomatoes and $5.00 lb sliced ham and he wants to charge me $16.00 for a grilled cheese? He fought with us on this issue for a few minutes then acted like he was doing us a favor by allowing us to have the original price. 
Charge me a buck or two more for ordering off the kids menu I don't care, charge me for my tomato, but, to blatantly try to bate and switch me to over charge me so your tip is higher...no way!!! 
Now to the food...my husband ordered the French Dip. He said it was good. He would eat it again but, nothing great. Portion size was larger than I expected.
My grilled Cheese was so greasy it was dripping while I ate... No it wasn't tomato juice...it was actual oil!! Also, the cheese they used was American and I would I preferred Cheddar but, that was my fault for not asking. 
The highlights of this dining experience were the French fries!!! Hands down they tasted just like Arbys fries! If I had a Jamocha shake I would have been set and this rating would have been much higher! Yet on a serious note this place needs menu adjustment for vegetians( who are one of the fastest growing dietary choice) heavy duuty training on staff enthusiasm and customer interaction/ service!",s5FMlSB4QBTX75K1wDHJiw,0,0,2,ppA-fWLLKqFmIfUzcgMhWw

Service can be hit or miss. Sometimes it seems like there's a very small crowd and your waiter is nowhere to be found, but fortunately they give out those thermal carafes of coffee so you probably won't need them hanging around anyway.

The menu has evolved somewhat over time (by that I mean they periodically take stuff off and raise prices on the rest), but the food is actually pretty good. We especially enjoy the Sunday brunch menu, which features a very good Eggs Benedict with potatoes that are consistently well cooked, a sweet apple pancake with bacon and eggs, and toast made with thick sliced bread like Grandma had.

We have gone here for breakfast/lunch every year during the SEMA show. it has always been like a standard casino buffet/ cafe.

Well this year they moved the entrance in to the casino and made it look very high end.

I took a couple of my good dealers here for lunch, we waited in line for a few and then they took us right thru the cool new area to the old seating area in the back which had not been renovated. my dealer said "" hey we just got walked thru first class to coach"" and boy did they ever!
The waitress barely spoke English got our drinks told us the lunch specials 
I got the lunch prime rib it came with an ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes and broccolette

my dealer got the meat loaf with the same sides as I had.
and my final com padre got a sandwich with fries

now the fun begins......

My plate was cold, old and stiff the broccolette was fresh out of the freezer, the spuds had that surface crust they get from sitting out and the meat was glazed over. the au jus cup was filthy and barely had any fluid in it like a coffee cup in a New York diner.

The meatloaf had cold gravy, and same stale sides as mine, 
The sandwich look poor too, his fries if even cooked, were definitely cold. 
.......now I'm embarrassed.

I got up and went to the waitress station asked her for the manager she looked left behind the wall that blocks the view into the kitchen were he obviously was standing, and said she would send him right over. 
As I turned around to walk back to the table he came out the other side were I caught him.  
I asked him are you the manager? He said yes sir.

At that point I literally told him ""come with me"" he followed me to the table and figuring he wouldn't put his hand on my plate so I picked up the broccolette and handed it to him.
He was also mortified when I poked the potato play dough and it didn't even make a mark in it.

I told him I'm not paying for this, I brought my dealers here for a nice meal and not to be embarrassed. At this point he offered to bring us new plates at no charge, two of us took him up on the offer the other choked down the sandwich and left the fries for dead.
the replacement food was fresh but the whole experience was ruined

This time, we got a bagel with everything on it. Now, I know we got a choice of bagel. It was never offered. My husband hates onion, but settled because I liked it :-)

Without any doubt this is the place no one cares about.  Strange that Sid the owner of Westgate would not taste his food.  I ordered two different main dishes which were the worst examples of turkey dinner and meatloaf that I have experienced.  The turkey was some processed roll that was more salty than free popcorn in a bar.  I did not think that they could mess up ground beef too much, but I was wrong.  The strangely tasting meatloaf was full of chunks of something I could not chew.

You ask why the 5 Stars then? When I mentioned my concerns over the meal to the waitress, she listened with apparent understanding and left the table. When she returned, she brought news that Sid's had made it right! And they did! they made it 100% right!

As I was there for 4 days, I returned frequently to Sid's - experienced a couple of breakfasts - excellent Eggs Benedict and also really enjoyed the standard two egg breakfast. Further their omelets are awesome!

A salad at lunch was awesome! As another contributor here mentioned, portions are totally large enough to share! 

The wait and kitchen staff have no problem at all accommodating special requests ( I practically remade my salad - take this off, please and put this on please). Of course, there was an up-charge for a few things, but it was all fair. AND they always got everything right to order!

Service was superb and exceptionally friendly. A special thank you to Miss Frankie! One special waitress! Come to Fresno, Frankie, we'd all love to have you as a waitress here!

Horrible attitude from our waiter Scott. My husband and I literally were questioning if we possibly did something wrong to deserve the major shade we got from this waiter. The service made us uncomfortable and made our dining experience very poor. Some examples of said poor service/attitude:

A: When we sat down, my husband asked to close the check immediately after ordering since he had to leave early, to which he responded with a snide ""well, i have to put it in first"" and refused to take my husband's offered CC. 

B: Asked for 2% milk for coffee, received a cup of milk and was charged $5. When I politely asked Scott the server about the fee, he literally rolled his eyes and grabbed the receipt. When he came back he simply placed the receipt in front of me without a word.

Unfortunately the waitstaff service was slow (Jeanine actually had scramble from the front podium to take my order) but this is likely a case of understaffing.

After a long drive to Vegas with two toddlers, we checked into our room and wanted something to eat. We decided to try out Sids because we couldn't fathom the thought of driving anywhere.

The server, an older man, took one look at our boys, who were coloring and rolled his eyes. I let that slide. We were already there and we were hungry. As I was telling him my drink order, our boys started talking amongst themselves and the server, in a very sarcastic tone, told me twice that he couldn't hear me over the screams. Screams?! I'm not one to let my kids sit in a restaurant and cause a scene. If they had been loud, I would have taken them back to the room and asked for our food to go. But they weren't. The server was just being a diva. Again, I didn't let it bother me. 

Thought the meal, I kept catching him roll his eyes and he acted as if we were bothering him when we asked for our check or a drink refill. 

The ladies in the table next to us had an even worse experience. After explaining the server explained the menu wrong, one of the ladies received something she specifically had said she didn't want. She wanted hash browns with her breakfast but got skillet potatoes instead. The server proceeded to argue with the ladies that they were the same thing, going so far as saying, ""Potato Potahto Tomato Tomahto!"" Needless to say, the ladies talked to a manager and we didn't see the server after that. Not even to pick up the check and give us change.",n9P_h4VxC0mF4iSakx8ZWw,0,0,1,-BT4JEhw2VcFBMzLrodKCA

Our first server, Ana, was a kind and prompt server.  My son and I split the entree and it was surprisingly big:  a nice chicken breast, thigh, drumstick and wing came with it.  

We went back for the $11 Caesar salad and added a salmon for $7 (about 5 oz) I think it was a generous salad. 

The wait times to get food was spotty; but it's a good option for hotel guests.

The staff seemed as if they were forced to be there. No one seemed happy. We were a party of three. All we ordered were sandwiches but took forever to bring them out. The sandwiches were ok, tons of bread, less meat. The bun for the hamburger was so thick we had to cut the burger into pieces. The patty was decent, but way thinner than the actual bun. The Turkey Club was smothered with too much mayonnaise as if they were hiding the taste of the turkey. We spent about $70 on 3 sandwiches and 2 soft drinks only.

Prices were fine - it's Vegas, it's a nice hotel - so that wasn't a problem.
My advice though - sit near the back of the restaurant, because if the casino gets smoky, it can waft into the front part.

5715371,2015-12-13,6,_R-rjgz4Kwi4f3u0clFeKg,"Went on Saturday 12-12-15 at about 12:30 PM.  I was expecting a dingy ol' casino diner but this place is actually nice-looking.  A glance at the menu board revealed some impressive options like lobster rolls, prime rib, and succulent shrimp cocktails.  Prices were not too bad and the hostess was so down to earth that we decided to throw caution to the wind and dine here despite the 2 star average.  
Service was prompt and friendly and I began to wonder why all the bad reviews?  They brought out my baby's fresh fruit first which, to me, is very thoughtful and understanding of the impatient nature of 1.4-year-olds. At this point I figure the place has got a bad wrap from tourists.  An old couple next to us was leaving and asked if we wanted a piece of bacon that they didn't eat.  LOL Waste not, want not, I suppose...but it made me laugh! 
Then the food comes.  I was so excited about the matzo ball soup!!  First bite revealed that it is lukewarm (STRIKE 1) and the veggies are so fresh they tasted like they had *just* been chopped up and thrown in the soup.(STRIKE 2) Who likes raw soup?? Not me.  I wanted hot, slow simmered, mushy veggies and hot broth to warm me up on this cold day and I was dissapointed.  
The lobster roll was a disaster.  The outside of it was burned (STRIKE 3) and the bread was spongey and stale like it was baked two weeks ago. (STRIKE 4) If this was baseball they woulda been out by now.  I was willing to forgive all that, though, because the pieces of lobster were so big and there were entire claw pieces in it.  Two bites in revealed the lobster to be hard as a rock, fishy, and littered with pieces of shell.  (STRIKE 5) It was impossible to eat, and at $19 I did not feel like I should have to pay for this inedible mess, and the waitress was nice enough to take it off the bill.  I've literally never had to do that before at any restaurant.  
Husband's prime rib sandwich was awful...instead of big fluffy pieces of prime rib it was shaved like a philly cheese steak.  You can't pick how you'd like it done and it does not come with cheese so ask for it if you want some.  Curly fries and the fresh fruit were the best part of the meal.  Oh and the piece of bacon that the old couple gave us was good, too.  
It's a shame because this place is so cute and the menu items are very enticing but their cooks suck! If I was ever forced to come back here I would get something reaaaalllllly safe like maybe breakfast.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,11,5,2,3qGQDRuK2L5BTRMnSheSXg
