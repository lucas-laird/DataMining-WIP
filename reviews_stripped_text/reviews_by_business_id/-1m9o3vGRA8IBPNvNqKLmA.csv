The pork chop is very juicy and nicely seasoned. We had the truffle mac and cheese and it was hands down one of the best I've had. Expect to pay approximately  $160 for two people but so worth it. Carlos, our waiter, was very attentive, entertaining, and knowledgeable of the choices on the menu. The only negative thing I have to say is lighting is very very dim.

And people who are Yelp ""Elite""... your reviews are obnoxious and you should find something better to do with your time...after you watch South Park. But I figured this Bavette's was worth my first review. My girlfriend and I went here yesterday on opening night. It's our favorite steakhouse in Chicago, hands down and we've celebrated her birthday there two years in a row (in Chicago), now three years in a row with our visit to the Monte Carlo location. Bottom line, if you're a local, don't stay away because it's in the Monte Carlo. The food is just as good as the original in Chicago, and the staff is somehow even friendlier. The menu is exactly the same as Chicago. Must gets: Any of the bone-in steaks, the elote style corn side, the bacon and tomato salad (it's actually huge slabs of pork belly. They also have kept the same corkage fee policy they have in Chicago: waived so long as you share or exchange one glass with a random table. But, don't take my word for it. Listen to Phil Vittel (Chicago food critic) or Chicago Magazine (http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/November-2017/Chicagos-Best-Steakhouses-2017/) I've been to to 7 of their top 10. It's number one on their list, and deserves to be. They even have several managers from Chicago living in the hotel working to make sure it lives up to their standards. Only caveat I can think of: traffic might be a pain during Golden Knights home games, so leave a little earlier.",CVXyi8tBOKXZizwlpVuejg,4,3,5,rfcw1C5JPWuN-5ok_TbW3w

We ordered two entrees - a petite filet and the fried chicken.  The filet was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  When you order a filet at this price point, this is what you expect and Bavette's delivered.  The fried chicken was possibly the best we've ever had. The spice blend is unique and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  A very moist delicious alternative to beef.

We had the creamed spinach for a side. This was prepared differently to the more traditional version, containing both onions and cheese. 

The dessert list was impressive.  We opted for the carrot cake. Great choice as it's nothing short of extraordinary.  Simultaneously light and dense and not overly sweet. A home run.  If you don't have time for the entire meal,  you could do worse than dessert and a cocktail while sitting at the beautiful bar.

We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and hope to return many times.",jZBLCGC77S5y8xDEnHc0jA,0,0,5,x20W8e_pI8WJOgxKRchHJg

We loved it so much we came back a few weeks later with our friends who love steak and at the next table was Frankie Valli. You wouldn't expect such a beautiful and large restaurant from the outside but it feels like you are transported to another era. All of the food was amazing. I highly recommend the crab cake. It is huge and basically an entree unless you split it with 2 or 3 people. The sourdough bread and butter is the most delicious and fresh bread I have had in a while. The steak is of course fantastic, but that goes without saying. The only thing is the restaurant is very dark so if you have trouble seeing it might not be the place for you.

Here's what we ordered:  The 22 oz. dry aged bone in ribeye, the creamed spinach, the elotes style corn, the buttery mashed potatoes, the carrot cake, and the chocolate pie. We were sharing the steak and asked if they would bring it to the table whole so that we could slice it ourselves so it didn't lose its juices and they were more than happy to oblige. We ordered the steak the way the chef wanted to cook it and that is always the best way to order a steak. It came out medium rare with a delicious charred crust and every single bite of it was perfect. The mashed potatoes were delicious, the elotes style corn was out of this world, but the creamed spinach almost made me cry. If you do not like blue cheese you will not like this creamed spinach, but otherwise it's one of the most incredible things you will ever put in your mouth. Just the smell of the chocolate pie is enough for dessert, but go ahead and eat it AND the carrot cake. You won't regret it.

1291993,2018-04-24,2,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"I think I found my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas...and it's not just because of the food. Both the delicious menu and the excellent service make me want to already book another reservation. 
The atmosphere is gorgeous. Stunning. You forget you're in a casino. It's dimly lit with a speakeasy feel and gorgeous decor. The bar is so beautiful. It somewhat reminds me of Herbs and Rye if you've been there. They even have a little speakeasy lounge in the back. 
My sister took me here as a graduation gift and unfortunately I was not feeling too well when we got there. The server was nice enough to ask my sister if they needed someone to check on me in the restroom and make sure I was okay. I found that so sweet and I really wish I remembered his name. He was working a Sunday night. 
Beyond that nice gesture he gave us amazing recommendations and even though my stomach felt bad at the beginning, I still managed to eat way too much!! The two of us could barely dent the food we ate, and we had two giant to-go bags after. Don't worry, around midnight that night we consumed all of it. It's so delicious we couldn't save it to eat the next day.  
The crab cake was soft and delicious. We also got I believe a half pound of lobster with butter. WOW. It was beautiful just to look at but tasted even better. Even their butter for dipping tasted better than usual. We also got steak, mac n cheese, elote corn and Brussels sprouts. You can't go wrong with any. I can't remember what steak we got but it cut like butter. So delicious. The corn and the Mac n cheese is a must. I devoured that corn during the meal and later that night. I'm a big ""elote"" savant and this is probably one of my favorites from a steakhouse. 
We ended the meal with a sundae about the size of my head that came with all types of candy toppings. We were so stuffed I think the staff was surprised how we barely touched it but I promise you guys we ate so much! It was so tasty. 
The assistant general manager was very attentive and made sure we had a great experience. Thank you Bavettes for the kind service and understanding when two girls could barely dent our food.

1399560,2018-05-24,0,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"Here is the 3-1-1: 

Food: Old school themed with a classic menu of various cuts of steak and other meat options. So, for our dinner we went for the Chicago Classic rib eye which was medium rare and served with a side of béarnaise; the meat was very tender but for a rib eye it did not have a lot of fat, so it tasted more like a filet. The bone in rib eye was super tender and it tasted completely different from the Classic as they fat content was far more present.... a great piece of meat! The sides of brussels sprouts that were tender and charred really made it a flavor explosion; truffle mac & cheese, a definite must have as the cheese oozing with truffle essence; the wild mushrooms completed the tri fecta as this garlicy, buttered plate of goodness was a perfect pairing. Great pics on their website: http://bavettessteakhouse.com/las-vegas/food/

Service: Though they were busy our waiter was still very attentive and provided a nice level of service as he checked on periodically and made sure things were going well.

Ambiance: Classic, dark and old school jazz piped throughout the restaurant. Very spacious with the sound level pleasant so conversations don't have to be loud.",2kVBQ7qTtRoZEY7Z5cFfZg,0,0,4,f7VAbd12PCdbQ6gesExMhA

1521311,2017-11-22,8,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"WOW.  Ambiance - Check.  Service - Check.  Food - Check.

Bavette's ambiance is ""dark and moody"" (per our waiter, John), creating a very elegant and relaxing stage for an unforgettable dinner.  The lighting creates a challenge when trying to read the menu, but there are little lamps on each table which offers some assistance without blinding everyone with your iPhone flashlight (yes, I tried that).  

John was an outstanding waiter.  I can't rave enough about him!  He impeccably described every item on the menu that our group inquired about and everything out of his mouth was absolutely eargasmic.  He exquisitely painted a portrait of each menu item in such a manner that it was almost as if he were the executive chef himself!  I also need to praise John for being able to handle our group and ""gracefully back away"" when needed.  Lol.

I'm not much of a salad gal, but John sold me when he said the bacon on the wedge salad was made in house and cooked 4 different ways (mind blown).  The salad itself was your standard wedge salad, but that was seriously the best piece of bacon ever!  I would order just a side of bacon next time I eat here.  As the main entree, the 22 ounce bone in ribeye that has been aged for 42 days is definitely something that everyone needs to experience.  It was rich and full of flavor, and not super fatty as most ribeyes tend to be.  For sides, the table shared the truffle mac n cheese (super cheesy and with a touch of velveeta, yes I said velveeta, to make it extra creamy), elote (rich and creamy), brussel sprouts (can't ever go wrong with this) and extra decadent mashed potatoes (super buttery with roasted garlic on top).  The mashed potatoes are a must have, in my opinion!  To top it all off, please treat yourself to a slice of carrot cake.  It has a rum wash on the side to seal in the moisture.  Even if you're full, just order a slice for the table to try.  You won't regret it!  

I will definitely be back to Bavette's on my next visit to Vegas!  If I could, I would give it 10 stars!!!",8aXDEbnB7hGTz9WMjaX3FQ,8,8,5,_9CgZIga58PCie_ZPGgHMw

Dim lighting from Tiffany lamps, endless velour, tasteful brass finishes and more will take you back in time.  It took less than 5 minutes for us to be seated, and we were presented with a cozy table near the bar.

My favorite part about this place is their corkage fee policy.  Typically the corkage fee is $50, but if you are willing to share a glass of wine with another patron in the room your fee is waved.  Of course we did this - we could not not take advantage.  We were more than happy to share a glass of our Cabernet Sauvignon with a fellow diner - and watching their reaction when they received the glass was priceless. 

Now, the food. Everything we ate was delicious - it rivals any steak dinner we've had in NYC. We shared the mixed green and apple salad ($16) and it was more than enough for the two of us.  We shared everything else as well. The bone-in ribeye (medium rare) was phenomenal ($85).  The steak was perfectly cooked with a flavorful crust and melted in our mouths.  It came with bernaise sauce, but the steak was so flavorful we did not use it.  We had a difficult time selecting sides as there were so many delightful options, but we were not disappointed with the brussels sprouts ($14) and the buttery mashed potatoes ($13).  Out of the two, the spuds won. 

Service was good overall - we were not rushed and took our time enjoying our meal.  The restaurant has only been open a few months, but I'm sure it's going to be one of the hottest spots in Vegas once construction at the hotel is finished. Beat the crowd and check it out!",_ln0oPOJvxNE6MZJdm3r8g,5,2,5,7b310hVWXMj59B0Ps8Ie7w

Our server was good if not a little too quiet. Our ears were still ringing from a two day concert.
We started with the baked goat cheese app....it was perfect with an unexpected depth in the tomatoes that can really only be achieved by reducing a sauce over time. Really good.
Onto the steaks:
I had the duchess cut filet. The only reason I didn't get one of the dry aged steaks was simply due to the size of them and no way to keep leftovers. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We really enjoyed the wild mushrooms on the side, also cooked very well. But that bernaise.....probably the best I've ever had!!

My fiancé and I already checked out Primrose which we loved for brunch, and we were really looking forward to going to Bavette's. It was late on a Friday night, and we were nervous that we wouldn't get in but we tried anyway. It sort of looks closed from the outside and it's also a very dimly lit restaurant. When we walked in, the hostess greeted us kindly and told us that they could definitely take us without a reservation. However, she said we only had about a half hour until the kitchen closed. We quickly found our table and we were greeted right away by our phenomenal server, Brian. He asked us if we had ever dined here before and also if we had been to Bavette's in Chicago. This is a Chicago style restaurant, and my fiancé, being from the Midwest had a lot of questions for him. We decided to split a steak and also start with the crabcakes and salmon Caesar salad. We went back-and-forth with a few wine options and Danielle came over to help us pair of the right wine with our meal. They let us sample a few before we decided on a nice, full-bodied Cabernet. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the crab cakes. For the price, there was a ton of food. The steak was delicious, the Caesar salad was so good-Brian recommended that we get a smaller portion and even the small portion is huge. We had such a great time, the service was great - Brian and Danielle took a lot of photos of us so that we could remember our experience. Brian even walked me all the way to the bathroom. The place wasn't super busy but it was also kind of late. The environment was close to a Chicago downtown restaurant, again - dimly lit and romantic. I definitely recommend going here and I would even return back.",hA2X9akTxboda17YqbF20g,3,3,4,qCINa4oqG1ehiwpv4DT6Uw
2150856,2018-01-02,0,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"We were so excited to try a new steakhouse in Las Vegas! Overall,  I'd say we have mixed feelings about this place.  I really think it's a very cool space. The atmosphere is great,  the music is neat,  and it's very comfortable.  The service was good, not the best I've had.  We had a male server and I noticed that the table near us being served by a female seemed to get excellent service, so perhaps it depends on who you get.  

The portions on apps, salads, sides, and desserts are large and by Vegas standards somewhat reasonably priced.  The steak we ordered, well that's another story.  We decided to share the 22oz prime dry aged rib eye.  The price point on all of the steaks is very high.  We  have eaten at several Las Vegas steak houses and our expectations for the steak were high, because we know what prime dry-aged ribeye should be.   Unfortunately,  the steak wasn't very flavorful and was actually on the dry side.  There was a very thick crust , perhaps too much, that made the steak seem overcooked (we ordered medium rare and it tasted more like medium well).  The downside to the restaurant being dimly lit is that you can't see the doneness on your steak.   The apps, sides, salads, and dessert we ate were pretty good, so I'd consider going back and trying something other than a steak.   For that price point, it's just not worth it, there are many other steak houses in Las Vegas that do it right.  

Here's another cool thing about the restaurant: they have a good corkage policy:  the fee is waived if you share a glass with another table.  You can bring one standard bottle for every two diners in your party.",czcyvI_CaAW-SON4TFFR6w,2,0,3,bDB_9xFXuH3JErRszo15Dg
2162009,2018-03-28,2,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"I have never been to a restaurant that I can honestly say that the restaurant itself has taken my breath away. Bavette's is that restaurant. The pictures that you see online do not do the place justice. Don't let the bombed out exterior of the Monte Carlo keep you away from Bavette's.

When you walk into Bavette's you are thrown back in time to when Vegas as Vegas. No neon lights or celebrity chefs. Just a relaxed environment and great food. The male wait staff wear tuxedos. The female wait staff wear beautiful, yet practical, cocktail dresses. You are surrounded by dark wood and crushed red velvet booths. The lighting is perfectly dimmed and the sound level encourages conversation. Truly, a romantic restaurant.

The food at Bavette's is incredible and the wait staff let you take your time enjoying it. Our reservation was at 8 and we were seated at a table near the BEAUTIFUL bar. Albert was our waiter and took really good care of us. He was very old school in that he checked on us enough, but not to the point of bothering us. As an appetizer, we tried something new. We enjoyed the Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine. This was new in that my wife thought she ordered something else. lol This particular dish was actually really good. The apricot mustard withe the terrine itself made for a salty/sweet flavor. Then we ordered the wedge salad. Just because I love wedge salads. The salad wasn't actually in the form of a wedge, but I didn't care. It was more of a chopped salad. The salad was incredible. Peppered bacon, egg, gorgonzola, ranch dressing, and onion. The beautiful thing was the chunks of gorgonzola you would run across that were covered in bacon at times. So good. An epicurean orgasm. lol My wife ordered the Double Cut Berkshire Pork Chop. It was served with wild mushrooms and was so tender. I ordered the the Beef Short Rib Stroganoff. The noodles were hand made and it had button mushrooms in it. I was in heaven! I can honestly say that if you are going to try any dish at Bavette's, have the stroganoff. And if you are going to order any of the sides, you have to have the Brussels Sprouts. They are charred and tossed in dijon mustard and parmesan cheese. Sadly, we were too full for dessert, so I drank my Manhattan instead.There is a lounge in the back of the restaurant that rivals the restaurant itself in its beauty. 

Bavette's is on my radar now because it is truly a special place. So if you are looking for a quiet alternative to the craziness of Vegas, then give Bavette's a try.",hdha6G3od9ZFd6x1SLwxhw,5,2,5,ugosWe3DKPXdY5kcioOOSQ

The restaurant itself is in the casino and pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it. Inside it is cozy and even though it was pretty busy, it did not seem too packed. A strange thing, and probably my only complaint, was that there were plenty of open tables but they sat us at a tiny table in between (and extremely close to) two separate parties which was awkward. The waiter was very attentive and helpful. He advised us not to order two separate entrees but instead to share one, which turned out to be amazing advice. We started by ordering drinks which were very strong but had good flavor. The bread that was brought out prior to our meal was probably the best we've ever had at any restaurant! We could not stop eating it. Since we weren't in the mood for steak, we chose to share the Spicy Chicken (which came with mashed potatoes and gravy) and also shared the mac and cheese and creamed spinach sides. The sides themselves could have been a meal, they were absolutely incredible and I could not recommend them enough. My boyfriend loved the chicken, but personally it was probably my least favorite of the food we ordered. Which was fine because I was so full from the sides/bread.

3. Garlic Shrimp: YUM! 

4. Baked Sweet Potato: My side of choice, I love sweet potatoes. This was almost perfect, although I could have gone for a little less butter/sugar since I like my SPs more natural ;) Next time!

5. Truffle Mac & Cheese: This was my kids' order and they enjoyed it. However, it's not as 'truffle-y' as most Truffle dishes I've tried. I still enjoyed it though :)

6. Tokyo ______ Old Fashioned: I forgot the full name since it was my husband's drink, but I quote; ""The best old fashioned I've had"", and he's tried a lot, so must have been great!

Desserts: We ordered 1 scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream and they offer complimentary hot fudge or goldbrick, or since our server is awesome, she gave us both ;)

   Now about the food, how did vegas not have this tasty food sooner!! The food isn't something that hasn't been done before, it's just done so much better! Oysters-super fresh and clean. Wedge salad- probably the best I ever had, the dressing is delicious as well as the maple pepper bacon they topped it off with. Crab cake- just get it!! So much crab meat it's unreal! Bone marrow- holy mother cow! Soooo good! Comes with onion jam and sourdough toast. Traditional filet- melted in my mouth! Super tender. 42 DAY DRY AGED BONE IN RIBEYE- are u kidding me! Cut through like butter and packed with flavor! Stroganoff- creamy, flavorful pasta topped with tender pieces of braised short rib! Mac n cheese- super cheesy and good amount of layered flavors. Brussel sprouts- def a must have, slightly sweet and tangy! Choc cream pie-so velvety and chocolaty. 
   The whole experience is something I'll remember, the food and service is something I'll come back for again.",lesnCKZUYH554j-EDZBlTw,2,0,5,pod-Bs-oWFr9N_7DGp-9tA

Stepping into Bavette's from the casino it feels like a different world, completely isolated from the sounds and lights of the casino floor. Bavette's has a classic feel to it, a dark room, nothing avant garde or fusion with the food, drinks served in gimlets...
Our server, Brian was prompt and attentive and made sure to explain how Bavettes was different than other steak houses and gave us advice on our orders. 
Bavette's is about food that is big enough to share, and they don't mind if you do. Regular salads could feed 4, so Brian suggested we do a half order (1/2 price) which was the perfect amount for my wife and I. 

I appreciated that there was no issues when I had to push back my reservation. There are a lot of steakhouses in Vegas, this is one that offers a bit of a break from the noise and hustle.",zXj4PlDxzh7cVl9wM7x2sA,1,0,5,z5tRIpqYpIPHEFGc9aD-9Q

We ordered way too much as every dish is huge even the bread basket.  Started with half salad orders: mixed green & apple and the smoked salmon caesar both out of this world!

I knew I wanted a ribeye - just the small 10oz tonight since I still had 3 more nights at the hotel and ample time to sample more of their menu.
My server offered me a half of a Caesar salad which sounded good since it's so hot outside.
The salad was delicious but then the ribeye arrived cooked (seemed a little small but what the heck) a perfect cook to medium rare on the first bite and OHMYGOD - the flavor - whew, so good, then tender, then marbling, then flavor, flavor and more flavor, texture, juiciness. i couldn't wait to finish chewing this and cut another bite to savor and enjoy.
I passed on dessert and went to the french Restaurant, Primrose, next door (in the Park MGM) to sample their country home, garden-inspired setting and menu. I was once again, blown away.

With the pork belly(bacon) on top being the real star. For the main I went Big and got the 22oz bone in ribeye. It was the best steak I have ever had. And my top 5 steak list is no slouch. Lots of heavy hitters. And this steak is now on the top. Yes you pay 85 for it, but hey, it's a special occasion. Go for it. The sides we got was Mac n cheese, best I ever had? Yes.

This one has distinctive traditional steakhouse decor, very dark, lots of leather and wood.  It could be 1950, it could be 2018 when you're at Bavette's.  The service is attentive.  Menu is very standard steakhouse fare.  I started with the champagne smash, which was delicious but too sweet for my palate.  I added some club soda to cut the sweetness and liked it much better.  This is probably just me.  I was expecting champagne level sweet and this one is full-on sweet drink level sweet.  I normally just give the bread basket the stink eye if one is delivered to my table, but I couldn't pass it up when they brought out one filled with aromatic, perfect sourdough bread.  Crunchy crust and soft center with the ideal sourdough tang.  Carbs, you complete me.  My dining companion had the wedge salad, and I had the bacon roasted tomato salad. They have a half salad option, which I ordered and still had leftovers. Both of our salads had the BEST bacon ever.  Smoky, salty, sweet.  A holy trinity of bacon. The hat trick of pork.  We both had filets for dinner.  Mine was ordered Pittsburg rare, and for a place known for its char, I was disappointed in the low level of char on mine.  My husband had a baked potato, which is actually two potatoes, and came with more of that bacon of the gods.  I had a baked sweet potato, which was gigantic. You can definitely share salads and sides here if you're so inclined.  We ended up with quite a lot of leftover food that we took back to our hotel to enjoy the next day.  Plan to swing by your room afterward with a bag of leftovers if you have kitchen facilities where you're staying.  I can't say that this was my best steak experience in Vegas, but I can't say it wasn't, either.  There are so many different feels to the steakhouses around town, and Bavette's brings a unique experience to Vegas.  I'm sure I'll be back.",kfw8shHObvE79C5xgN_t3g,0,0,5,b-hpr7XXt9By7BCE3CswfA

Las Vegas has a tradition for quality steakhouses, and this has risen to be a top contender. We started with sharing the wedge and asked that it be chopped so all could share. The larger bacon bits and just the right amount of dressing complimented each other well. The steak is a 16 oz. New York, prime 42-day dry aging is perfectly cooked, and the taste and texture are wonderful (we asked to share this which was perfect for my wife and me).

Nobody ever touch the table except the sommelier who went out of his way and  gave us an outstanding service with great advices and was always there to refill the glasses. The waitress was good but she should check the timing on the table. When you wait for your food for so long, you get a little irritated , and when the runner come with the food ask who as what? And got confuse, I have to ask him if there is not seat number in the front of the ticket? Gave me an attitude and when back to chexk the set number. Overhall the food was good but the service need to be work on.",8e2KqFt1W67MA3ah09IYbw,4,2,3,9PBqbv620RoofjTF0mfrDA
4061600,2018-01-05,2,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"Bavette is now where the ""Brand"" steakhouse used to be and I'm now I'm a fan..

Service: Our main server and his assistant were on point throughout the whole evening.  They kept the table clear, drinks fresh and the vibe positive through the night for our party of 6.  It's definitely the great service you'd expect from a high end steakhouse. Good times

Steak & then some: I went with the 16 oz Classic Ribeye Chicago Cut, cooked medium.  The ribeye was charred a little too much for my liking. 
This created a dark crust that might have taken away from the flavor as it was a little more bland then expected.  Was the Ribeye better than average?  Absolutely, but in their High End Steakhouse League, the competition is so tough in Las Vegas.
The BFF loved her 6 oz Petite Duchess Cut Filet.  She ordered it medium and mentioned it was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I'm on their traditional filet on the next visit.
The buttery mashed potatoes is their perfect match with the steaks, I loved tasting the garlic with the butter.  The herbs and thyme worked well with the mushrooms.  The Charred Broccoli made me feel healthy af, and I have no issues with the broccoli being charred.  The Truffle Mac & Cheese did not make me feel healthy af, but it was all worth it as it was excellent.   For dessert, the Mango sorbet was lovely.  Thicker in texture for a sorbet which I'm ok with it because it was packed with Mango flavor.  Definitely ordering again.  Their Vesper martini (Titos vodka, Bombay gin, lillet) got me feeling buzzed and like 007.

Ambiance:  Dark af with smart mood lighting at the table and I LOVE it.  Our main server came out in a tuxedo and everyone is dressed to the nines in predominantly black and white formal wear.  The center bar is beautiful and I loved the Dark Wood Chicago steakhouse feel.  This might currently be the most attractive steakhouse on the Strip.

I'm glad Bavette's is here and they're definitely another steakhouse to consider when it's $$$$ steak night out for you in Vegas.  They are definitely on my list.  Enjoy! =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,9,5,4,2x6DyIb3jC5ohcmj3uxSjw

We ordered the bone marrow, truffle Mac n cheese, elote corn, and the bone in rib eye. It was more than enough for the two of us to share and we had food left to take home. My personal favorite part of the meal was the bone marrow. Not only was it a generous serving, but there was a lot of marrow on the bone itself and they still give you their sourdough toasted on the side along with a raspberry onion jam! The ribeye was delicious as well! We got it cooked medium, if you are more daring than us you can get it the recommended medium rare. It comes with a side of bernaise but it did not need it at all.

Babette's has a classic dining feel with mini Tiffany lamps and big leather booths, low lighting and you can actually hear what you're saying to your date. The service is top notch period. You never have to look for your server, and they were extremely accommodating to my food allergies. There are contemporary updates in flavoring to classic dishes. They offer a great wine selection and immediately serve a warm and freshly baked sour dough bread. I had a large seared Salmon with a truffle Mac and Cheese.

The setting is dark, expansive but intimate, and very romantic. The location was a little hard to find at first though, as the Monte Carlo Casino was being renovated and the normal entrances were blocked. We had to walk around the side of the building through a construction zone to get inside. But once we got there, it was worth it. The space feels as though you have taken a step back in time with beautiful circular booths, Tiffany lamps, and dark wood accents. An ""old Vegas"" vibe that we were looking for... very cool!

The food was delicious and we ordered a lot of it - crabcakes, mac and cheese, and a New York Strip that my boyfriend enjoyed. Our drinks were carefully-crafted and boozy. Well worth the price.

Finally, the service was excellent. Our server was a true professional and incredibly knowledgable as well as friendly and welcoming. We got a level of service that is pretty rare nowadays, even at more high end restaurants. He really ensured we had a nice experience and we appreciated that.

We literally ate almost everything. 

As an appetizer, we had the garlic shrimp and it was one of the best SHRIMP I've had in awhile. the buttery garlic was to die for. 

Entrees: I had the petite filet with added mushrooms and bone marrow. The bone marrow was amazing and a must have. The petite filet was cooked perfectly and was easy to cut. only thing is that i wish it had a little bit more flavor to it, if i didn't add the mushroom, it would have been super plain to me. It also came with a teenie tiny salad and a roasted tomato. My husband had the pork chops and he loved it. Again, he said one of the best pork chops he's ever eaten and he loved the mushrooms that it came with. This guy barely ever eats mushrooms, so the fact that he had it, it was really good then.

A little bit overwhelming with both bone marrow and steak.  The brussel sprouts were delicious and a nice side dish though! A little crisp with some cheese sprinkled on top.

Please note this is a REAL review, because most of these other reviews don't look too real to me!  The atmosphere is upscale, very nice, but EXTREMELY dark. We ordered a crab cake appetizer, a Chicago cut ribeye, a mixed mushroom side and a baked potato side. The crab cake was excellent. The steak was very slightly over cooked, it was pretty good. It was not the best ribeye I've ever had and not the worst. The mushroom side was killer, the potatoes mediocre. The service was 5 star excellent, the food was a 4. It's a pricey place, but these types of places always are.
   We are not strangers to high end steak houses or restaurants. This is without a doubt the darkest place we have ever eaten. You couldn't see if you were eating steak or mushrooms! The light at our table was 1 watt. We commented on it, the Maitre'D said everybody says that. If your girlfriend or wife (or husband) is really ugly, I guess it's a good place to go. Everybody looks great in the dark! The steak knives were not serrated and dull. They bring the water out in a fancy bottle, no ice, and they leave the bottle on the table. So, it's warm, probably tap water to drink for your meal. I'm stone deaf, but my GF said the music was particularly annoying. She said it was brassy jazz, and a bit too loud to relax. And...that's kind of ironic, because that's why we went there, to get away from the sounds and bustle of the casino to dine and relax for a bit. 
   In sum, the food was pricey, but ok. Service was excellent. It is not as good as Brand's was. There are clearly better choices for steak in Las Vegas. Bear in mind I don't drink, and I'm 65 years old, I've eaten in thousands of restaurants in my lifetime!

We sat at the main center bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Rocco. He was so awesome and inviting. He greeted us with a smile and offered menus and a beverage. My bf ordered an old fashion and the 2nd old fashion ordered, Rocco suggested a Japanese whiskey which was a nice twist to the traditional drink. 

My bf was only interested in dessert and ordered the carrot cake and ice cream. They didn't skim on the cake cutting and he ate every single bite. He had a sweet tooth and said that's what he needed. Me being vegan, Rocco offered me the vegetarian menu and there are notations on which items could be ordered vegan. As I wasn't very hungry, I ordered the sweet pot and it was plentiful. 

This place has a great atmosphere, a nice break from the hussle of the tourist crowd in the casino. We were happy to stumble into it and plan on returning next time we're near",9UfZhqfDptllFTKgHAhMYQ,2,1,5,YmY9qkOlxheRQSPoUaSvZQ

5095022,2017-11-04,13,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"New Steakhouse Alert! 

Chicago is a steakhouse capital of the US.  One of its best has made it to Vegas.  

Bavette's makes practically every top ten steakhouse list from professional reviewers and publications.

The new Vegas location, in the renovated Monte Carlo Resort and Casino does the original justice.  All the menu favorites are here and they are good.

Standard chilled seafood cocktails and towers.  Pass and look towards the more interesting.  The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine is outstanding.  Slices of the ""loaf"" contains chunky bits of duck and tangy goat cheese in a mixture of chilled duck fat and innards.  Spread it on the charred bread like a country pate.  Good eats.  

For salads, the crab stuffed avocado is excellent.  A pile of jumbo lump crab meat, a head of fresh bib lettuce and a classic, tangy, mustardy dijon sherry vinaigrette.  Classic.

Now, the steaks.  All USDA prime.  All well trimmed.  Cooked slightly below temp (better side to err on).  All seasoned with a custom steak salt post cooking.  The non dry aged, 16oz, bone in filet is very good.  Extremely thick cut but perfectly cooked internally.  Uber tender and thanks to the bone, beefier than normal.  It is easily overshadowed by the very good 42 day dry aged, 22oz, bone in ribeye.  Denser, beefier, very good umami finish.  The steak has a good sweetness, nuttiness with just the right bleu cheese funk.  

Traditional steakhouse sides.  Solid creamed spinach with just the right amount of melting bleu cheese to punch up the umami finish of any steak.  The truffle mac and cheese (made with truffle bits not synthetic  truffle oil), creamy with a blistered, crisped topping of white cheddar.  Very good.  Again a great way to punch up the umami finish, epically of the aged steaks.

Prices in line with this tier of steakhouse.  Bone in filet, $73; dry aged ribeye $85.

Service is surprisingly good for a new eatery.  

Properly made old fashion and martini.  Very good wine program.  Nice selection of brown libations with very fairly priced doubles (it is a Chicago steakhouse after all).  Vegas resort markup.

A true Chicago steakhouse and  a welcome addition to the plethora of top tiered steakhouses in Vegas.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,29,26,4,FD_IjZP62rvVmZE9JsNN7A

I had the Bavette's salad ... delicious & healthy (ish), the filet was tender and yummy, the oysters were fresh, the Brussels and mac n cheese were also very good.

Service was warm, professional and polite. Atmosphere, especially after a week in Vegas, was calming and felt like you were in a ""real"" restaurant rather than part of the casino floor or dining in a mall like so many other places on the Strip.

Came here to enjoy a piece of Chicago and to experience a tasty meal. Decor is great and love how dim the lights are once you arrive and are seated.

Started the dinner with a few cocktails in which they had a few different old fashions to choose from; I went with the Tokyo. Hints of smoke and sweetness was a nice sitter change to the traditional fan favorite.

Apps were:

Steak tartare- seasoned well needed a touch of lemon
Shrimp cocktail- perfectly cooked shrimp and ice cold sauces to accompany them

Lyonnaise salad- super cold, great dressing and the bacon slabs they serve with are super tasty.

Entrees:

22oz dry aged b/I ribeye- ordered chared MR and arrived at the correct doneness and charring fantastic and served with bearnaise.

6oz petite duchess cut filet- ordered blue and was sent of correct. Served with the same sauce

Steaks had the house seasoning salt which I really didn't care for; it didn't add any value to the steak experience

Dessert:

Fudge Sunday with different types of candies- wasn't to impressed with this as they were bought candies versus making them yourselves..

I am a loyal Monte Carlo player and thoroughly enjoyed most of the restaurants that were there prior to the current renovation. I always welcome change and was very much looking forward to trying Bavette's and Primrose (which I'll review separately) during my first ever New Year's Eve in Vegas trip. There were four in my group and the others also enjoy and appreciate a good meal. The ambiance here is really cool, as it's like stepping back in time and it almost gives you the feeling of dining in a speakeasy. It's pretty darn dark so we needed to use the flashlights from our cellphones to navigate the menus, but this wasn't really a big deal and made us chuckle. (Perhaps offering small flashlights to guests would make for a nice touch?) We ordered the wedge salad which was delicious and the shellfish tower which was also amazing. The complimentary bread was also a hit. The Mac-in-cheese side is yummy and the roasted broccoli was just okay. The entrees were bone in NY strip (medium rare), 2 bone in ribeyes (medium rare to rare and medium), short rib stroganoff.  Although the food up to this point as very good (the service wasn't stellar - just average) I have to give a 2 star rating to a steakhouse that is known for, well, steak. All three steaks were tough and cooked improperly. The med rare NY strip was medium well. The medium to medium rare ribeye was medium well and the medium ribeye was very close to well done.  The waiter apologized, took each of our steaks and notified the manager. The manager acknowledged the poorly cooked steaks and apologized. He even went as far as saying he was embarrassed. I opted to bypass the steak altogether but the two others (Ribeyes) accepted newly prepared steaks. Even with the second preparation, the beef was tough and just the overall flavor quality was lacking. Dry aged beef should be very flavorful and tender - neither of which were present here. The restaurant took several items off our bill without us having to ask which was appreciated, but we would have preferred to pay for a great meal with top-notch ingredients and preparation.",fWRbagBDErc7W7VexglndQ,0,0,2,vxMuoig-69uloIZ77dChIA

The place is very dark...like good luck reading the menu dark.  I felt like I was too close to my neighbors as well.  I couldn't see them as much as hear every word that came out of their mouths.  

Got the baked crab cake to start.  Its weird... there was a mild fishy flavor which is very odd because crab doesn't have a very strong fish flavor. I would certainly not order these again.

Ordered the 10 oz filet mignon.  It came cooked more than my liking.  Asked for medium and it came more like a medium well.  Normally I would not complain about such things as small as that however when you're paying the price you are then suddenly you get a little bit more nitpicky.

Now let's talk about the flavor.  Bland - as in it tasted like someone went to the grocery store picked up a cut and cooked it. No prep no spicing no additional flavoring of any kind. It did come with some weird yellow stuff in a silver cup...oh and a piece of parsley.  I did not try the yellow stuff.

I can think of off the top of my head at least 10 different places including my own kitchen that have better steaks in this place. And on top of that I don't have to pay $25 for parking at any of the other places that I would rather go to.

So I guess the bottom line is if you are looking for someplace where you will not be able to see, you will hear all of your neighbors conversations you'll pay an exorbitant amount of money for parking and you'll pay a premium price for some mediocre steak well then this is the place for you.",14AtoV_RS6VHP9ZpnhtE8A,2,0,1,rP7Xt8x_up9IBi2yQTGgoQ

5776154,2018-05-22,0,-1m9o3vGRA8IBPNvNqKLmA,"Great experience, except for the most important thing. 

My wife and I dined at Bavette's on Friday, May 11, 2018 before going to the U2 show at T-Mobile Arena. We were staying at Aria but chose Bavette's because of its proximity to the arena. We made reservations weeks in advance and were anxiously anticipating the dining experience. We've dined at some of the finest steakhouses in the country and tried to go to Bavette's in Chicago on a recent trip but failed to be able to get a reservation to fit our schedule.

First of all, the decor and atmosphere at Bavette's are superb. You'd never guess it was built just months ago. It has the look and feel of a vintage restaurant. Dark woods and rich, earth tones, coupled with low light create an upscale atmosphere. The restaurant was busy but we were seated promptly. The service was attentive (mostly, more below) and sophisticated, exactly as you would expect. The waiter greeted us and acknowledged that we were headed for the U2 concert, as were many patrons, and noted that he would get us going asap. We had an hour and thirty minutes alotted for the meal, which seemed ample on booking.  We skipped appetizers in order to be sure finish in time for the concert, but started with cocktails, both choosing the Champagne Smash. It was delicious but was mostly crushed ice, and at the $17.50 price tag, not a good value. We should have gone with a martini or bourbon, of which they have some excellent choices. The waiter explained that if steaks were ordered (as I intended) to expect a crusty char on the outside per their cooking style. This suited me fine. I started with the Ceasar salad, which though not disclosed by the waiter, came to the table with tongs and is enough for at least two and probably more like three or even four people. Fortunately, my wife had not ordered salad and I persuaded her to share, or we would have been severely overstocked with greens. For dinner, I ordered the filet, cooked medium. My wife ordered the spiced fried chicken and we chose the elote corn and brussel sprouts for sides. Let's begin with the positives. The chicken was excellent in flavor albeit a huge portion on a bed of mashed potatoes. The size was overwhelming to the point of being aburd. The sides were excellent and a good portion for sharing. I'd recommend the elote corn first, but the brussel sprouts were outstanding as well. 

So, here's the rub. My steak, ordered medium (which the waiter repeated back to me when I ordered) had not a trace of pink inside. Instead it was gray throughout and cooked on the well side of medium well, by anyone's standards. It had a nice char on the outside, as described, but was totally dry inside. If not for the side of bearnaise, it would have been difficult to eat. I'm normally not picky about such things and expect some range when ordering a steak. I've ordered medium and gotten closer to medium rare, or closer to medium well. Either is fine, but this was vastly overcooked. Unfortunately, our waiter was absent for an extended period after I cut into my steak and, as it took about 45 minutes for us to receive the mains (probably due to fact that the steak was cook about 15 minutes too long), I had no opportunity to point out the chef's error as we were on a tight schedule to make the U2 concert. Had we had more time or had the waiter approached within a reasonable window, I would have politely explained and shown him that the steak was overcooked, though I doubt much could have been done at that point to accommodate our schedule. Needless to say, this was disappointing enough to taint the entire experience. It is really even difficult to say how good the cut of meat was, give that it was so dry as to be also lacking in significant flavor. I honestly don't think if it were served to someone who ordered it well done that they would have complained. It was that overcooked. By the time the waiter checked in again we were over halfway finished and I asked for the check in order to make sure we made the show on time. 

So, overall, there were a lot of positives, but one major negative. A steakhouse should be able get the steak cooked within an acceptable range given the customer's request. This is the first time I've ever had this complaint at any of the dozens of steahouses I've visited around the country. I was rather shocked and disappointed that it happened here. I am going back to Vegas in June to stay at the Park MGM, where Bavette's is located. Sadly, I won't be dining there again.",6zoDtFMZczzONOZeKXR64g,2,0,2,IRFRCUvHd5T1Tr13BLHVzQ

Inside the decor was nicely done with a bar located in the middle. We sat at a booth which was comfy and cozy.

We ended up ordering the crab cake, baked goat cheese, spiced fried chicken, 10 oz filet, charred broccoli, mac and cheese and bacon. We also received complimentary shrimp and tar tare.

I wont go into details about each dish but I will say everything was on point and amazingly delicious. Few of my favorite from the dishes we ordered has to be the mac n cheese and the filet with roasted garlic. But everything was so good and the portions were huge. This place is not one of the high priced restaurants that serve you small portions. You definitely get your moneys worth for the quality and the amount of food you get.

Throughout our visit Tony was our server who waited on us. He was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. Tony was very friendly and actually carried on a conversation with us.

After our delicious meal, we ended up receiving complimentary carrot cake and chocolate cake. So I have a place I goto back home for carrot cake which is my favorite dessert. The carrot cake back home is one of the best. After trying the carrot cake from Bavettes, I have a new winner. Bavettes carrot cake is moist, full of plump raisins and full of flavor. The chocolate cake is soooo smooth you can taste the dark chocolate they used.

We will definitely be returning again soon. This restaurant is one of our top 3 here in Vegas. Thk you Bavettes for an awesome dinner experience!!",PcfwKJJA9-H6ZNXAqNke9A,7,1,5,dfEkGO93kIHKFSQTXeMnnw

We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas again.,1NGNZ-2IqLUjh4QEJ4j6Rw,0,0,5,a3S7MKzjzqA70BbcTxYHVQ
