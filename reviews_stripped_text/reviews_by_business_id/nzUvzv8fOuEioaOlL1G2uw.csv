We got picked up in a nice van, the driver bashed other restaurants near the strip and praised this restaurant as quote ""nothing comparable."" He was trying to sell us hotel deals, show tickets, and tours within in 20-30 min ride... #buzzkillwejustwanttoeat! 

It turned out the guy was a bitter tour agent, constantly shit-talking about his competitors who are ""scumbags without a green card doing business."" We arrived to the vacant sandai restaurant (Saturday night- prime time) and the driver headed straight to the back of the restaurant. Turned out he was the restaurant owner's husband pretending to have no association with the restaurant.

Food, since that's where this matters..
Restaurant quality? Poor.

It has a small dinning area that if it was busy it may feel uncomfortable and may make it a hard place to have a group go, but all in all its not terrible!

I ordered the terriki bowl since I was on my lunch break and didn't have time to really dig into some sushi. The service was not the best but there dish was tasty. The portion for the price was a little pricey but I was full and the food was good. I also ordered there egg rolls.

My last visit was about 2 weeks ago with my youngest daughter & my boyfriend. She wanted the variety of sushi & my b f & I wanted Korean Soondoobu soup, bibimpop & Galbi short ribs. As usual one server, owner's wife cooking & her husband finished eating & helping here & there w cleaning tables. The wait to order was slow but we were ok w the server cause she had waited on me many times before. Variety sushi came out first, bibimpop, soup & ribs. In between I had asked for more of banchan (Korean side dishes) such as more bean sprouts, Kimchee twice. Keep in mind they are served in a small bowls. Then we decide to order an item, Korean vegtls pancake. Cause it's a last minute order, the server said it would be a while cause they are also busy w a large party in the corner of 8-10people. Ok ""no problem"" I told her, since we ordered so much to eat. So when we got the vegtl pancake, it was like a large  size of pizza, literally!! & under cooked. But I didn't say anything nor sent it back cause it's a Korean restaurant & out of respect!! 
So to eat vegtl pancakes, I asked for more Kimchee / side dish. The owner, husband said to me ""where are you from, around here? "" in Korean to me, so I reply ""here in Vegas"". Then he said to me ""you guys eat too much Kimchee"" as he was bringing us a small bowl of Kimchee with a mad face & very rude. I was so embarrassed in front of my daughter & my b f, who is non Korean. After we paid a check for over $95 plus a generous tip for the server. I have decide to NEVER  go back AGAIN!!! The owner(husband) so rude, arrogant & doesn't appreciate local support at all! I gathered that restaurant is doing somewhat well from non Korean customers as well as some other Korean customers. He's made his money & doesn't realize his restaurant isn't that good. I'll not support his restaurant again. My large family & friends are definitely BOYSCOTTING Sandai.

You can see that from the many pictures of the owner with the celebrities posted on the wall of the restaurant. The pictures can get annoying are there are just too many pictures it can really drive you crazy. Restaurant itself is ok, there's not really a ""vibe"" of either a Korean or Japanese restaurant, more like something in between. 

Food is average. My Agu-jjim (braised spicy angler fish) didn't have much meat in them and Ganjang-gyejang (Soy sauce Crab) was wayy too salty. Their Galbi is pretty good but small and overpriced.

I ordered the AYCE sushi, reasonably priced at $20.95 for lunch. The rolls were horrible! The quality of fish was bad and they tried to cover it up with sauces but lo and behold the sauces were also horrible! I ordered 3 rolls, unfortunately the only one I remember the name of is the Japanese Lasagna. This is my guilty pleasure roll that I always order at any sushi place I dine at. It is a baked California roll with cream cheese on top, and eel sauce drizzled over the top. It is usually my favorite roll. Here, it was my least favorite. The roll was not baked, the cream cheese was cold, and I definitely wasn't eating a California roll. I paid and left, with a vow never to return. Later that night, I felt nausea and threw up the whole meal. I can't say for sure I got sick from Sandai, I just think the food was so gross that my body was rejecting it.

2956093,2011-08-09,0,nzUvzv8fOuEioaOlL1G2uw,"I might be a black sheep on this, but I actually like Sandai alot.  I can see that a lot of the reviews are prior to 2011, so maybe they changed management and improved a lot of things. Ever since I've been going here since February of 2011 I've had great food and OK service (not exceptionally good but not bad at all either).  To be honest, I'm shocked to see they have only a one and a half star rating on Yelp! So I'm here to give in my little two cents.

First off, the venue is pretty small, but cozy.  The maximum capacity of the dining room is probably less than 25, so that may give you a rough idea how small it is.

The only thing I ever get from here is either the blood sausage soup (Soon-Dae Guk) or the cold noodles (Chin Naeg Myung).  I got the soup mostly on chilly February/ March days and the cold noodle is excellent on a hot summer day.  The blood sausage soup is not spicy, but served extremely hot.

I am absolutely a huge fan of cold noodles, and I can say Sandai comes close to having the best cold noodles in Las Vegas (and better than ones I've had in L.A.).  I've heard Mother's Grill has great noodles, but I haven't tried theirs yet.  Sandai's cold noodles is way better than DJK's in my opinon.  I just love the authentic North Korean taste it has (for the record, the owners are South Korean. And, for the record, I'm South Korean as well). North Korean cold noodle style has a more tangy flavor that I'm more fond of, and the noodles are served thin to my liking. I hate how some cold noodles are served with too much MSG, or the noodles are too thick at other venues.

I hope I shed some light on this restaurant.  The service I get is good, food never fails to disappoint, and they know I'm a common face in the restaurant so they treat me pretty well.  I can't speak for any of their other dishes, but if you're a fan of cold noodles you have got to try Sandai.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,1,0,4,jNJVaUkxO-hsvrB-20JD2w
3163055,2016-08-30,0,nzUvzv8fOuEioaOlL1G2uw,"My girlfriend, and I were in this strip mall due to a washing machine malfunction at home, and a conveniently located laundromat. We could have chosen many places to eat that night; a Korean BBQ place, a Mexican-Japanese sushi spot, a kabob joint, etc. All of these within a 5 minutes walk of the laundromat. But no, we were feeling adventurous this night. For great sushi is rare, and Sandai Sushi looked to be an extremely authentic Japanese restaurant. I mean it even had a gold ""nekochan"" behind the bar! 

So we walk in, are greeted well by an elderly Asian lady, and order a rainbow roll, and an Unagi roll because normally it induces a state of total awareness. Both of these rolls induced a state of dismal malaise, and frequent trips to the bathroom the next day at work that were both awkward, and strangely enlightening. My girlfriend tapped out on the first rainbow roll; I foolishly went in on a few of each. The fish was old, and the rice fell apart on contact yet was oddly chewy. 

Great service, but the food is a week old, and just might kill you.

So I ordered the Boba green tea which was OK (how can you mess that up) To be safe I ordered their Tempura Ca Roll ummm was pretty disappointed it was lacking on avocado and it was kinda flavorless thank god it had eel sauce that's the only reason I could finish this flavorless yuckalicious roll! My sister ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and was also disappointed. 

Not only was the food bad but so was the service! 

I was being stared at the entire time by the two lady employees which was very uncomfortable! They were looking at me as if I was gonna dine and dash!!! My server was more like security than a server the only thing missing was her security badge and baton!!

We found in one of the local newspapers that they were having a 2 for 1 deal on Korean Nangmyun so we decided to go.  We walked in and asked if the newspaper advertisement was true and they said yes.  We ordered 4 of those and several other plates.  Once we were done the waitress asked if we had a valid Las Vegas license so we were confused.  She said she forgot to mention it but the special was for locals only.  Of course we were upset and one of the people in our group remembered never seeing that advertised.  She left the newspaper in the car and we didn't bother bringing it in to verify.  The owner brought one of his newspapers in and showed us the advertisement and in that one it said in small writing Las Vegas residence only.  We were upset but asked for the receipt and paid, but we didn't leave tip for bad service.  

When we got into our car and was driving away in our newspaper we didn't see the Las Vegas residence only advertised and realized this newspaper had a misprint so we called them to let them know that our newspaper had a misprint.  Well.....we didn't get too far, by the time we got to the part about the newspaper advertisement and how on this particular one it didn't say local residence the owner stopped us on our track.

Reason being as we knew there was a sushi place around the corner from our house however could not think of the name nor locate it on google. So we said what the hell, we are here let's check it out. 

When we walked in the place was empty, we were the only customer. Hmmmm? OK so was around two o clock so maybe the lunch rush had passed? 

First time dining here so I ask which is your top seller boba tea since they have a variety of flavors of boba smoothie and teas. Her response was ""No ""No"" you order what you like??? 

Are you freaking kidding me? Wow...

I ordered the crunch shrimp tempura roll, crab, avocado, shrimp tempura, cucumber. I asked that they leave out the cucumber. 

What a disappointment, the amount of crab was almost non existent, did not taste or see any avocado, tasted like a plain white rice roll with crunchy flakes. No flavor and they were skimpy with the eel sauce which would have helped with flavor if I could have dunked it in some. 

I also ordered a strawberry splash smoothie boba, this was good! 

It was not a comfortable experience, we were the only customer and the two ladies working sat at a table staring at us the whole time. It was ridiculous! Beyond insane staring! Have no clue why either? Almost to the point of being offensive. I am a customer not a criminal, no need to stare me down every bite, every sip. Maybe they made a bet on which one of us would throw up the nasty specialty roll they call sushi first? lol 

No sushi chef on duty, was a server lady and a lady that took forever making our two rolls. 

This place is bad in many ways! The only savior is the boba smoothie was good. That alone is not enough to ever get me to come back. 

The bad: 
Service 
Food 
Quality
Portion
Offensive staring from staff while dining.

The good: 
Boba Smoothie 

We could not wait to check the Yelp rating and knew it would not be good after we experienced what we did dining here. 

Never...Never...Never again!!!
