The location was nicely decorated but only thing was that there was a really OFF putting odor throughout the whole restaurant. Not sure what it was but it definitely was not appetizing. Definitely order the spicy wonton and beef and onion pancake. Very flavorful. You won't be disappointed. This place would be perfect if they cut down on the oil and took care of that mysterious odor.,V-Y2bJWLjKlxr_gn-YIkUQ,1,1,4,F7kCPCD6REKM7ixRLg9b8A

My hubby and I were excited that a new Chinese establishment had just opened nearby and have been eager to try it out

We went in around 2 pm on a Monday. It was completely empty, not one table was filled. We were quickly seated and given the menus. Without really explaining anything on the menu or giving us much time to look over the menu, the server who barely knew any English seemed to rush us to order our food. We ordered pork & cabbage steamed dumplings as an appetizer, and 2 noodle dishes as our main. 

We were surprised to see that the noodle dishes came as quickly as they did, before the appetizer. Thinking it can happen maybe due to the dumplings being handmade to order, we waited for them. And waited. And waited some more. 

We waited more than 15 minutes after our noodle dishes were brought out, we were nearly close to finishing our main noodle dishes. The server brought us what we thought were the dumplings we ordered, only to see that they were potstickers. Either the server put in the wrong order or the cook messed it up. She apologized and took it back to where the owner and her friend was sitting. They end up eating the potstickers, while we waited for the cook to make our dumplings that we waited more than 15 minutes for. By this time, we were all done with the main dishes. We waited. And waited. And waited some more. 

We waited another 10 minutes before getting impatient. I flagged down the server and asked where our dumplings were. She said that the cook forgot about our order and that we would have to wait 7 more minutes for them. What the fuck?? 

They had ONE table, ONE order, ONE job, and they fucked it up. Even now I'm boiling up trying to relive our horrible experience. I can understand things like this can happen have they been busy, but we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant besides the owner, her friend, the server, and the cook. 

What made it even worse was that there were no apologies, no nothing. The owner showed no empathy whatsoever. What she did do was bring her food out to the table right behind us so they can eat their lunch. Are you fucking serious?

Walking out of that restaurant was the most awkward situation I have ever encountered. There was no bye, no thank you, no sorry, no nothing. It was all silence. 

Again, we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant, they messed up on the most simple order, and the owner doesn't have the decency to come and apologize? For a restaurant that has only been open for a month, I'm not sure what makes her think she has any potential for success. 

Please do yourself a favor and just avoid this place.",PtNzONdO3WfGuj-xq5pTIA,2,0,1,L-x5kFvu6PI50qKGEEWlfA

The flavor on the shell was delicious, but once you peel the shell, the flavor was pretty much gone.  I also ordered a milk tea boba. The taste was perfect.  They make it to order, unlike many other milk tea places that pre-make it and store it in a pitcher.  Boba as fresh too.  I would have like the drink to be a little colder.

991562,2016-11-20,0,rIeXMt92PLNjZbemWKRXcA,"Bought a Groupon for this place $12for $20 worth of food. I had to try their beef stew noodle soup, it is supposed to be their signature dish. I consider myself a beef stew noodle soup fanatic and I would have to place this dish somewhere on top of my list of noodle soups. The broth is dark and very very flavorful. Unlike other broths that I am used to which is more transparent. The flavor is deep and has that borderline sweetness to it. The beef was very tender (a bit fatty but I like fat ) and also soaked up the flavor of the broth. It's a bit spicy at the end when you finally eat the small pepper morsel but it is not too hot, just right. The bokchoy is a great addition. Green onions and I would assume some ginger and garlic tops this soup nicely. The noodles are thin and a bit flat in shape. Not sure if these are egg noodles but I stopped caring after I tasted the broth. I also ordered beef and broccoli rice fish and it was a solid performer. With some sweet pickled cabbage it tasted very good. 

This restaurant is nicely decorated. Modern with dark/reddish wood overtones. The place is very clean an the service was spot on. They have a bar/counter area seating that overlooks the kitchen. Pretty cool design. The glasses they use for beverages are shaped like mini pitchers. Ultra cool. 

If you are contemplating on trying this place. Have no fear and go ahead. Make sure you try the beef stew noodle soup. Get a Groupon and it will be worth it.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,0,1,5,GBnRaM2KQaNaTC7TOVfugg

Worth the read!

Operations review:
First, the female chef/cook came out of the back several times talking on her iPhone and touching her personal phone. (Any fellow biology major, health food professional, or parent knows precisely how dirty that is) her hands went straight from her phone to wrapping and making some type of egg roll. Never washing her hands. This for me was a red flag. 

The kitchen is shielded only by glass, & so I purposely made eye contact with her as she put her phone down on the counter aka the food prep line. She just looked down, but continued to use her iPhone in the kitchen throughout the service. 

The waiter was a young boy that seemed inexperienced as a waiter. Very sweet young man, but clearly not a server. Hence, the service was slow, had to flag him down every time, water was left empty, had to ask for everything including to-go box and check. I should mention that he was on his own as far as front of house. He was the host, waiter, and busser. Unfair to him as an employee and myself as a patron. We sat ourselves and grabbed our own menus. 

Unfortunately, the cute little glass pitchers they serve tea in and tiny little Asian inspired decor on the table aren't enough to win me over after service like that and the food wasn't great either...

OH! ALSO, IT TOOK FOREVER FOR FOOD TO COME OUT AND PLATES COME OUT AT TOTALLY SEPARATE TIMES. 
What we ordered:
Beef & onion Pancakes 
Chicken & steak skewers
Chicken chow mein
Orange chicken with white rice 

Bill total: $36 and change 

Food review: 
Pancakes were a bit soggy. I saw a video review on Yelp draining them, but I figured it was because it was beef and onions and they're bound to cause liquid. Nope. The plate was totally wet under them. Fine, okay. However, the flavor was in consistent. We had two cakes cut in halves. My gf ate one half and was going on and on, but I was having a hard time getting it down. Something terribly strong and overpowering everything else was in mine. Then we noticed she grabbed hers from opposite end. She tasted mine and couldn't eat it either. Weird. 

Chicken and steak skewers were cooked fine, and others may enjoy them but the seasoning was over the top for me. You could visibly see that they were covered in seasoning. 

Chicken chow mein was delicious my gf said. It looked good. 

Orange chicken was crispy, but ultimately tasted like they buy the same bottle of ""Orange chicken glaze"" that I do at the supermarket when I make it at home. That was disappointing. 

Service 3/10
Food 5/10
Price point 9/10
Cleanliness 3/10

1404208,2017-05-02,8,rIeXMt92PLNjZbemWKRXcA,"So far, I would say that Mr. Chopstix is probably one of the most solidly consistent Chinese restaurants in Vegas, and probably the best one on the southwest.

On the outside of the restaurant, it doesn't seem like much, it just seems like a regular takeout joint. But once you walk inside, the interior is really well done. I think it previously was a café or something. What I also liked was the open kitchen, where you can see everything being made.

After sitting down, the server was there to take the order. I actually came here a couple times so I was able to check out a decent amount of the menu. They do a good mix of traditional styles of food, and food that appeals to a wide variety of people. I'm a sucker for honey walnut shrimp, and I like the one that they made there. I'm not too sure if the batter is traditional or not, but whatevs. I think where they really shine are their more traditional items. The skewers are really good, particularly the lamb and beef ones. I also liked the traditional Beijing noodles, spicy chili wontons, braised pork and eggs, and their Beef pancake appetizer.

This is a really solid restaurant. They might be somewhat tricky to find, but once you get there, I think you'll like it. I believe the prices are fair value and the quality is pretty good.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,17,18,4,vloln1PY_7joQZmeCLRvLg

I conceded victory to my luncheon companion when she bullseyed it with ""dirty mop"" and soon we found each other staring at the other with that silent, yet unmistakable half rolling bug eyed glare that suggested we could be embarking on a potential dining apocalypse. But I was determined to stay put, I had a Groupon and a mad hankering for onion pancakes. 

Prior to ordering, I showed our server the Groupon only to be told they no longer accept them and they have canceled their contract with them. Some muttering about 20% now 40% and heavy sighs and you don't knows. Yeah, okay and I don't really need to know, life is full of ambiguity and I'm already there and I still want onion pancakes. 

Our server was soon joined by another server or cook or passerby (as I mentioned, I had full on embraced ambiguity and was reluctant to deviate from that stance) to aid in the onion pancake ordering. There was picture pointing, asking how many pancakes came in an order, how big were they, there was this same process over and over and over again. Brain surgery should be this complicated, not onion pancake ordering. 

Then, for ambiguous reasons, we got another server and with that came renewed hope and we went on to order the rest of our meal. It felt like a new dawn, so I asked her about the Groupon, oh yes, they honor them. Then my friend also had a surge of optimism to ask for a new plate, since our previous server ran his fingers all around hers to demonstrate pancake size during the pancake ordering.  We enthusiastically pointed to the rest of our order under the impression that we were understood. 

Pointing worked in China, I figured it would work at Mr Chopstix, I figured wrong.  

Our different fathers, same mother ice green teas arrived; different colors, but similar in taste. Then came the soup we never ordered and sent back, followed by the lunch specials we didn't order, but decided to keep and eat because it was all too difficult and exasperating at this point to do otherwise.   Then came the great debate when our server asked how the food was and my friend nonchalantly told her it was fine, but not what she ordered. Then came the menu back at our table and the server pointing at the wrong meal and my friend flipping a few pages forward to show her the right meal; the culmination of the ultimate not on the same page moment. 

In fairness, the server tried to get us to reorder our meals, but we were fine with what we had, which I think might have been chicken and broccoli and orange chicken, all a bit too greasy, but ok, the onion pancakes, though not stellar were good enough to rate a solid 7. 

Whose meal is this anyway concluded with a greatly discounted final bill that was a gesture not requested, but unambiguously appreciated.",KLYgDnsQcZeIGPrTEFI6uQ,9,3,3,ov2Ra4bkvynrDIFBTzwCDw

Apparently the lunch Gods were not looking down on us this day. As the service was horribly slow here as well as we had to flag her down to order when there was only 1 other person in the venue. I asked for separate checks when we sat down & ordered our drinks. Most Chinese places are fairly fast on getting your food out. Had to ask if there were lunch specials. Waitress said it was the Special Rice pages on the menu that were supposed to come with the soup of the day, some kind of pickle & something else. As I write this I realize we never got the soup of the day or the other stuff that was supposed to come with the lunch special. $9 for a lunch special isn't really that great of a deal IMHO when there are so many other places that have fast service, good food for less than that price. Service was slow. Each plate came out by itself. The food was not that warm at least mine was not. When check came it was all on 1 bill. I mentioned to the waitress that we asked for separate checks when we started ordering. She gave me kind of a peeved look when I mentioned this but she did separate them for us. None of us had cash on us so we all needed to pay with a card.The place worked since we had bailed in Jjanga because of service & it was in the same parking lot.

I recently returned to the States in January.  I discovered ""Mr. Chopstix today. It's comforting to see Chinese families eating in a Chinese restaurant like Mr. Chopstix. It means there is a reason. The kitchen was open and clean. The decorations were comfortable and inviting. The best part was the food. It's rare to find good, genuine Chinese food in America. And what put it over the top was the quality of the food. Reasonable prices, cheaper than most restaurants in Chinatown.

I enjoyed the pulled pork and chive (in special sauce) on homemade toasted muffins. The lamb sticks were superior to China because the meat is a higher quality. The Beijing noodles with bean and meat sauce was great too. This was authentic Chinese and you can find the same dish in Beijing. The staff watched and served the table well and had a cheerful character.

Sit at the bar to watch your order get made fresh in their open kitchen. The pork and chive is my choice but the beef/onion version gets a lot of raves too. Feel your anticipation build as you watch the chef stretch and form the dough, scoop and stuff the filling, shape your pancake, and slap it on the grill. Then wait what seems like forever, because these juicy babies take awhile. But they are worth the wait: piping hot, savory pockets best enjoyed with a heap of chili oil. I recommend getting your own order because it will be hard to share. Better yet, just make this your entire order.

I ordered one skewer of lamb and one skewer of beef and she looked annoyed and asked "" just one?"".

There's not even a normal slush or I would have gotten my son one just so we can have the boba balls and lychees jelly. The environment is cool and modern looking but for the service we won't be back. I'll review my food when I get it lol, but I don't think it will raise any star either way. I'll just stick to my old boba place for boba drinks and Asian food. My family is done eating their food and I still yet have to receive my skewers, while my rice that was served prior is cold already! She never came to ask how was everything.

Not as authentic as having insects on the menu but they have some dishes that are must haves; Taiwanese chicken curry (potatoes are so good), sparerib green bean rice plate, eggplant chicken chow mein, skewers, there's lots of goodies on there.

If you are adventurous there is some ground for you to cover too...chicken gizzard entree is gooood (if you like that sort of thing).

And if you're not adventurous there's plenty of Western stuff on the menu too. -a friend had walnut shrimp which was the best I've ever had. Another had Kung pao which wasn't great, but I'm not really into the Western dishes, too sweet for my tastes.

You can tell the ingredients are all top notch and the different components to a dish (bell peppers, onions, green veg and protein) are all cooked perfectly, every time; it's quite difficult as they cook fast, at high temperatures and each component has a much different cooking time.

I ordered the pot stickers and fried rice, both were excellent! They make their own dumpling dough fresh and you can watch them make the dumplings. The fresh dough as opposed to the frozen kind that most places use makes a huge difference. The dough is fluffy, flavorful, and moist. The fried rice was made to order so it was fresh and had lots of eggs which I loved. Most Chinese places make the fried rice in large batches so it sits under a heat lamp drying out. The fried rice isn't covered in soy sauce either. It's white not brown. 

Service is overly friendly, multiple people greeted me to make sure I was taken care of.  This is not a fast food Chinese place, it's a sit down restaurant where you can expect good, fresh food, made to order, made in a clean environment unlike the places in Chinatown which are full of roaches .  

There are a few misspellings on the menu, but that's how you know it's real Chinese food, made by real Chinese people.",yNiCei5QzogiC5edd9UP5A,1,1,5,EsKm97w9j0sGAuf9tyGSRw

We sat in a quiet corner because we had our baby. There was lots of room around us in case we needed to get up and rock him.

Anyway, the food was good! I love salt and pepper pork chops and they did not disappoint. I got the fried rice that had salted fish in it. It was my fault for ordering this cause it really was very salty. Overall, the rice was good, just wouldn't order it again. Potstickers were just okay.

Sodas are served at $1.79 per can! Eek!

The snow ice had a hefty price of $11.99! It was a large portion, but sheeesh. We got mango and strawberry; we liked them both equally. The mangoes tasted fresher than the strawberries though.

To start off we ordered water and I got a Thai Tea. Nothing over the top with it, not too sweet, but tastes as expected.

For the meal I ordered the Braised Pork and Egg and my friend got the Lamb Stir Fry with Green Onions and Szechuan Pork. The entrees came with white rice. The Braised Pork and Egg has amazing rich flavor a lot of it coming from the fat on the pork. The meat was tender and the fat just melted in your mouth. The same goes with the Lamb Stir Fry minus the fat.The Szechuan Pork was primarily a stir fry of vegetables with some pork. It seemed like there wasn't enough pork after working through all the vegetables. 

The service here was substandard. The waiters did not really check with us throughout our meal. We had to flag down our waiters to get refills on waters. It may have been because there was an hour before closing so maybe I can't be too strict on them.

The pricing is a little pricey, but I think the taste justifies it. I'd probably come back to try their other food and compare their orange chicken to other Chinese places.",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,2,0,4,P89NbgH6qgynCFNOjx6DjA

Egg drop soup- besides it spilling it lacked flavor! Actually NO  Flavor at all! Took one taste, and it was in the garbage! Never had egg drop soup that tasted so bad.

Pork and cabbage pancakes: SOOOO OILY!! They must of taken them out of the fryer and threw them into the box because I had to soak them in paper towels myself. Wasn't anything special. Needed more flavor!

Wonton & chicken soup: this was extremely bland, just like the egg drop! The broth tasted really funny. I threw it away. Asked for no seaweed, guess they most of forgot. 

Chicken Skewers: I totally didn't even think they were chicken, looked like sausage. Small pieces with no skewers. Totally tasted like package taco seasoning. Weird I know! Lol 

Pot stickers: Just ok nothing special.

Orange chicken: Just ok nothing special, over cooked but not nasty.

Sweet and sour chicken: This was over fried and still a bit oily! But I opted for fried rice instead of white, totally the wrong move! The rice was white, they clearly decided not to add soy sauce! Zero flavor! I can make better fried rice and I'm Italian! 

This post isn't to be mean, or talk crap, the food was just not good!! I wouldn't eat here again! I was the most disappointed in the soups, because I know Asian soups are so delicious! Won't be back ever! I rather have Pei Wei!",j2rFqYXfK8dN-CxULh6aUg,1,0,1,3TIkMw5inJ3Aik6-i0fUGA

They haven't even started it. So now while my food gets cold I have to sit and wait for the last item. And I can't cancel it because it was done online with a credit card. 

So I finally got the food home. The pancake with the beef and onion basically tasted like an Asian hamburger wrapped in potsticker dough wasn't bad but wasn't amazing. Definitely not worth 45 minutes to an hour. Then I got to the braised pork noodles. Holy cow. It was a starred dish on their menu so I had high hopes. I bit into the first piece of ""pork"" and it was all fat. I looked through all of the pieces and they were all the same. Absolutely no meat, just fat. I love pork belly but this wasn't even close to that, it was braised pork fat. I wanted to through up with the first bite. Luckily the Mongolian beef was decent, I pulled out all of the pork from the noodles and added the beef. That made a pretty good dish. All in all I will give this place another chance.

After reading some very convincing reviews from some trusted Yelpers and seeing the great looking photos posted, my husband and I had dinner here. We definitely over-ordered because we were so excited to try everything. All the leftovers we had were still great the next day! Their crispy tofu was just the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the spices and garlic they used made each bite full of flavor. The green onion pancake was a very generous portion and made fresh. The Chinese sausage fried rice, with also had corn and bean sprouts, was one of the standout dishes. The rice was still very fluffy and all the different flavors went well together. I don't even like bean sprouts (especially in Vietnamese or Japanese cuisine), but it worked well here. I also had the sweet and sour chicken, which was not too greasy and reheated well the next day. My husband was raving about the honey walnut prawns and how the mayo flavor was really well fused into the batter. 

The service was very attentive and I was happily surprised at the modern decor inside. This restaurant is definitely a step above the China One-esque establishments in the valley, both in food offering and ambiance. Everyone we dealt with was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. My husband ran out to get my jacket because I was feeling a bit cold, but an employee noticed him hand me the jacket and promptly turned down the fan.

This one was full of flavor with well-made noodles (they make em in-house) and a good portion of tasty beef. It's not super spicy but the flavor was so good I didn't feel like adding any extra.
 
The lamb skewers remind me of the toothpick lamb at Chengdu Taste. Really good. $2/skewer. Not necessarily cheap, but definitely worth trying to know if you'd like an entrée size quantity (Trying to spilt that with someone next time). This place also has a more expansive menu than most places known for having good Chinese noodle soup to the point where it's more like a Chinese restaurant that happens to have good noodle soup.

It's rare that I'll take the time to write something negative about a place.  Mother taught me,  ""if you don't have nothing nice to say; don't say anything at all."" BUT this has to be known...

Let's start with the miniature pitchers they offer as glasses.  Ultimately very cute and original however, why are they serving Boba straws with my glass of water.  If I was a coke head I'd love these straws, you know what I mean... jk.  

The layout of the entire restaurant seemed like a giant waste of space. I understand you're highlighting your visible kitchen with a bar, very hipster-ish, however I feel maybe higher table tops would've been a better idea than the 9 inches people are being forced to eat on.  My roommate and I sat at a booth that was lower than the counter top so the kitchen view was pretty much useless. Oh and I saw a review where they said authentic Chinese cooks.... I guess they were all off today.

The service was mediocre at best.  First time, so I asked for recommendations.  Waiter instead asked what I liked and pointed it out on the menu.  Not what I was going for but hey, at least it's something.  He was able to name a dish in a picture we showed him from yelp. Kudos to him for that.  I was a little disappointed on how long we would have to wait for our food since there was only one additional family eating in the restaurant who already had their food.  I was warned though it was going to be at least 20 minutes for the pancakes. So I guess I can't be too upset about it.",gbLYe0YKdc8cW8AvORRWMA,0,0,2,7PKeeACg2-6784Mky4NpDQ

A bit off-putting to be sure. Our first visit was during the day right after they opened. Food was great; very traditional Chinese fare.

They really got their stuff together. The food was even better, the staff was on the ball, the drinks served in the most wonderful small pitchers, and the dumplings even better.

I usually get the pork and chives. The lamb skewers are also really tasty (priced at $2 per skewer), but I gotta say that Chengdu does it best with their toothpick lamb.

This place is located on Fort Apache Road not too far from 215 so it won't be too hard to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself isn't so large, but it doesn't get too busy so no problem getting a table.

We decided to try the Orange Chicken and the Honey Walnut Shrimp. The Honey Walnut shrimp was pretty good and the Orange Chicken was ok, even though it really felt like chicken nuggets freshly taken out of the freezer and dipped in an orange sauce... The main problem is that for $8.99 and $11.99, you don't even get some rice or noodles with your main entree, which means that we were both still hungry when we left the restaurant.

One good thing about this place is definitely service. Our waitress was omnipresent and did her best to make our time there as good as possible.

The orange chicken and hot and sour soup were on point! It was so good we ordered the same exact thing the next day! Feeling more confident with this restaurant, we also ordered the special rice plate with Mongolian beef also. The order came to about $18 - totally worth it! We will be eating there until the sun doesn't shine anymore! I highly recommend anyone to try it!

Salt and pepper shrimp: this is probably one of my favorite things to get at a Chinese restaurant. It lacked flavor and could have used more breading on it. Also the peppers I feel like should have been placed on top. It was hard to finish. 

Spicy wontons: probably the one thing I enjoyed. It had good flavor, I would get it again. 

Minced pork pockets: left an unsavory amount of oil in the container it came in. Lacked some flavor. It was promising but not as good as I expected. 

The service was okay. I felt like they were way more attentive to the family next to us. We very obviously were done with plates because we left it at the edge of the table but I guess they felt like ignoring it.

For an appetizer, I ordered the Chinese pancake with pork and cabbage stuffing.  I ordered noodles dan dan and a mango iced tea.

The meal was brought in reverse.  Since it took longer for the pancakes to be made than the noodles, I got the noodle dish first and as I was eating that, the pancakes were brought. Sometime in between the noodles and the pancake, I asked about the iced tea which had not yet been delivered.  She went to the drink bar area and retrieved an iced tea for me.

When I ordered the noodles, the server checked to make sure I knew they were spicy.  Yes, I knew, but they weren't.  On the tables are condiments common to noodle and rice shops.  Take the red jar of spicy chili pepper and oil and spoon heaping amounts on the noodles if you want your noodles spicy.  The noodles were brought out so quickly they weren't sufficiently heated tasting just a bit over room temperature.  I didn't boiling hot noodles but they should have bene heated more.

The pancakes are definitely a dish to share when there is more than one person but I made the sacrifice and finished both pancakes and the noodle dish.

Except for the drink, service was good and the young woman came by several times to check.

Mr. Chopstix is fairly close by so when I saw that it was opening I was pretty thrilled. The first time we went, they had just opened and service was a bit slow. The owner came from another noodle place which I frequented often as well and he recognized my husband. Service after that has been slightly better, but when we ordered online through Yelp there was a snafu with that so I wouldn't exactly recommend that. 

Now I've tried the potstickers, boba tea, beef noodle soup and the braised pork noodles. Overall, the braised pork noodles are my favorite. The potsticker quality has been slowly going down to the point where my last order of potstickers I didn't finish. The potstickers had a funny flavor and it was just meh. The braised noodles have never disappointed though. One time they added spice so it was a bit spicy for this wimp. There is a good ratio of pork and noodle though so well worth it. Boba milk tea was overly sweet with hard boba. Yuck. I would definitely say come for the noodles and hopefully the potstickers was just an off day. 

Service still has a ways to go. We ordered to go yesterday and the lady kept telling us that there was no pork noodles only shrimp, beef or chicken. So when we said we wanted the braised pork noodles she said that there was braised pork...lol?!

By the name, and the silly looking logo, one's first impression is a ""knock off"" of Panda Express, and just another Chinese Junk Food place. Oh no!  This place is a real find. 

The atmosphere is very pleasing, and the open kitchen, surrounded by glass, is just another plus that adds to this place. 

Food is very good, and the price is very affordable. What's more is they are very accomodating. Yes, there's the ususal American Favorites on the menu, but it's more authentic Szechuan Cuisine that makes this place a rare find. I usually ask for suggestions, and the servers reccomend entrees that are not listed on the menu, but are ordered up special by Chinese customers. 

I have never been disappointed. Even my ""know it all"" son, who is critical of any Asian eatery not located in Asia, really likes this place.

The meat and onion are cooked inside a closed dough pocket, which makes the juice that some see as fat. 
Pam fried pocket stuffed with chives, egg and rice noodles are new to me, and it's delicious! Made to order like everything here.

Items tried:
Spicy pork wontons
Braised pork noodle soup
Chicken and eggplant

Mr. Chopstix makes a good version of spicy pork wontons. There's a lot of flavor going on and enough heat to tingle your tongue. I have not been to one of the newer places in town to offer this dish (Shang), but my husband has. He prefers the way Mr. Chopstix makes theirs compared to Shang, Noodle Pot II, and Noodle man. 

The soup was really good and of course the tender and tasty pork was the star of the dish. 

The chicken and eggplant was our favorite dish here. Adding tofu is optional. The flavor was great and much more refined than a typical eggplant/tofu dish at a Chinese take out place. I like the way they cut the eggplant into thin strips to get some crunch and texture on the outside, rather than large, soggy eggplant pieces that other places serve. 

I think for Asian places that serve entrees like the chicken and eggplant, white rice should be included. When our dishes were served to us there was no rice. We assumed it was automatically part of the meal. Apparently, white rice is an extra charge. A slight annoyance, since we couldn't eat right away and had to pay extra.

They offer boba drinks here. I tried to order a green milk tea, but for some reason they couldn't make it. Our server said they could only do the flavored iced teas. Not sure if it was an ingredient issue or lack of trained staff to make the drink. 

The interior was done nicely and I like the open kitchen concept. Service was very polite and attentive. Usually, unheard of in Chinese restaurants.

""Braised Pork and Egg"" provides me with a deliciously nostalgic Taiwanese taste of home and the signature ""brown eggs"" accompanied with meaty, fatty pork belly are almost exactly like the ones my mom makes.  I know that flavor well as I've eaten a million of them give or take.

I don't recall any other spot in Las Vegas doing their ""Scallion pancake"" made to order from scratch, and this one is absolutely stellar.  The only con is the wait, since this is typically a starter dish, but even though this isn't brought as soon as I would like it to be, I forget all about those 15 minutes upon my first bite. 

In fact, all of their starchy goodness is made that way and forgoing at least one order of these from their extensive (for the burbs) array of dumplings and pancakes would be a mistake.  A couple of notable favorites are the classic pork and chive dumplings and the ""can't believe there's no meat in the"" vegetable and egg pancake. They're really big compared to other versions around. 

The spicy beef noodle soup, which is better than the signature bowl, is something I'd still be down with in sweltering Vegas heat.  Their mapo tofu is outstanding as well.  Easily the best Far East food.....in Far West Vegas.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,90,81,4,xvFHKkR1OMac5gDV3sb6pw

Probably the best flavor beef noodle soup base in town so far.  However, not the best I have ever tasted.  
The beef 2/5
This cut of beef is cheap for a reason.  Before the tendon being cooked throughly, the meat is almost over cooked.  There tricks to overcome this issue, but I'm not about to teach here. So, my rating is low on this part. I don't enjoy the meet melting and have to spit out the chewing tendon.   It's just not a proper beef noodle shop would do. 

Pork Chop with Fried rice 1/5
Fried rice wasn't cooked evenly. There are parts over cooked and parts lumpy.  The pork chop was too sweet.   
Didn't like this dish at all

For our meals my boys ordered a chicken chow mein, curry flank steak which included a side of rice, orange chicken which also had rice included and being a vegetarian I ordered the eggplant tofu chow mein. It was labeled as spicy but I didn't find it so. I also ordered steamed beef/onion dumplings for them which they all said was good. Two of them ordered Sprites which they brought out in cans and with a cup of ice to pour it in as well. Our server was friendly and attentive and our food was all served in generous portions, so much so that we had enough to take home for lunch the next day.

We had the spicy beef bowl, braised pork and the chicken skewers(6 total half spicy half not). 

I enjoy spicy food quite a lot and thought that would just add to everything here, sadly I was horribly wrong. They seem to just chuck spice on top of what they would have already made to make it ""spicy"". The end result is a layer of uncooked overly spicy crust to destroy your tongue with every bite.

Worst thing is the food is actually really good, but when your first bite burns your tongue out you might as well be eating rice pudding.

In summary, delicious food just run away from anything spicy... They don't know how to do spicy right.",gF5j6LYiY66dXUMok3EDgw,0,0,3,uyTxjW9mqIDY6ZqI8qlGVQ

Service has never been an issue for us. We always order so much food for us 2 that at one point our waitress was worried we didn't like the food cause we still had a decent amount of leftovers. 

There are some items I can't say I will get again, since they fall a little bit short, like the spicy chicken gizzard, but my sister actually liked the dish instead. To each your own!

The restaurant was pleasant if not a little warm due to the sun coming in the front windows. They had portable fans to help with that. No free refills on drinks. We had a meat and a shrimp skewer, which were excellent. We also had the beef fried rice, which was average. The hot sauce on the table redefined pain, so avoid unless you like that kind of thing. 

The reason I'm giving a three-star review is the Chinese Pancake. We had the beef version. The meat was not cooked through and it was basically grease upon grease. The grease spurt out on every bite. I believe the greasiness made me sick hours later. 

I did like the drinks in little pitchers and the bill coming in a little bucket, but being sick after a meal is never a good thing.",MGOLOBu4kxEkNo0pTPeSpw,0,0,3,h7PinoUFLfOPAM3L0rXaFw

This restaurant was far better than most I have tried to date here in Las Vegas, even in Chinatown. The ""potstickers"" (I really wish that restaurants in Nevada would start to know the difference between a potsticker and a a dumpling and at least here they seem to)were delicious. The Hunan Beef left something to be desired though-while utterly delicious, it did not have nearly enough beef in it. The pork chow mein (lo mein) was delicious, I do not get restaurants that do not use barbecue pork but rather steamed or boiled pork, here they knew better. The portions were perfect, heavy portion on the dumpling I might add-enough for a family of 4 to chow down on. This definitely will not be my last time ordering from them, though I will be sure to ask for extra beef if I get the Hunan Beef.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,0,5,1p5FPaXl9pU6JwhQ_-fQJw
