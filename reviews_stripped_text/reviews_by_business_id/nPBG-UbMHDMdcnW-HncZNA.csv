1597122,2017-11-21,0,nPBG-UbMHDMdcnW-HncZNA,"Meh says it all.  We had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all the wonderful reviews on Yelp. First, I will say categorically that their wings are better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  But BWW sets the bar so low that saying that isn't really a big recommendation.  

First, we were seated at a booth which seemed like it had the ""sticky' permanently embedded in the top of the table.  I'm not sure what they can use that will remove sticky residual sauce from the tabletops, but I've got to believe there is something industrial that will do the job.

We tried their ""pig wing"" starter with a bbq sauce selected by our server.  I couldn't tell if it was mesquite or hickory, but it was decent enough.  These ""pig wings"" are little fried riblets dipped in sauce.  Nothing spectacular.

We ordered 3 lbs of wings so we could sample sauces, and I guess we chose unwisely?  We tried Honey BBQ, Salt and Vinegar and Garlic Parmesan.  

The Honey BBQ were fried wings with BBQ sauce poured over the top.  You could literally do the same thing yourself, fry up some wings and dump your favorite BBQ sauce over the top.  But I bet your favorite BBQ sauce tastes a LOT better than their Honey BBQ sauce does.

The Salt and Vinegar were tasteless.  My wife tried that one first, as she LOVES Salt and Vinegar wings, and these were the worst we've ever had.  She usually gets them at the Albertsons on Charleston and Desert Foothills, and they are WAY BETTER from Albertsons.  They have a strong salt and vinegar taste there, but these at Wing King were tasteless.  Like they forgot to add any flavoring at all when they were cooking the wings.

Finally- the Garlic Parmesan were decent.  Not exceptional, but good enough that if those were the only thing we ordered, we would return to try other flavors.

One last note- even the ranch and blue cheese dressing they charge you for isn't all that great.  Like from one of those old time salad bars where they mix their own dressing, but water it down to make it go farther.  Like that.",ZXukgF-i9CTJBAtSV0du1w,0,0,2,iXKKzAI0WUeROQ3FVcdfhg

We went with a wet traditional hot, and a dry rub lemon pepper as well as a dry rub jerk pig wings. We were super excited to try those, basically a rib, ours a little dry.

Took a bit of my friends waffles and that syrup.. omg idk what it is but good lord!! It's amazing!!


Original review: My roommate ordered takeout and asked me to pick up on my way home.
I checked the menu on my way there and saw two jalapeño dishes I was interested in ordering.
One was close to jalapeño bottle caps and the other was stuffed jalapeños.. when I got there the woman told me they didn't have either dish so I was super disappointed. My roommate says the wings are amazing have yet to try.",nVNOFUAs82OTe0Mi6di35w,0,0,4,nxHuNAuE8CeriMrplBVX8w

I ordered the chicken strips w/ spicy honey bbq and a pound of fries which my date and I shared. For whatever reason my date was offended that the server placed empty plates in the middle of the table forcing us to move our hands, but I'm not sure there was another way to avoid that, given the size of the table and the length of her reach. 

Anyways, the strips were served on a super small plate so that the food hung off the edges, not sure why the choice in such small plates, but the strips were good and well seasoned and sauce was great. The fries were very good, I should've ordered some to go. The server did tell us that from time to time they do have live music, bands preform, which is very cool. 

The only complaint I'd have is that the young female server should've been equally as friendly to my date as this can cause a negative ripple in the experience. Other than that she was very polite and helpful.",-Wd_SCRLmBeRH8c-TmJ55A,0,0,3,ajhsTuwdHE7-ZCBRbtvgrA

Had a pound of what our waiter called the hottest that they had, Suicide wings, they weren't hot at all. The dry garlic parmesan was eh. The worst absolute worst was the chicken itself! It was freakin dry as bone, the meat wasn't moist at all - it was over fried :/

Because it's inside shooters you have to order your drinks at the bar - a bit odd, I mean the waiter could have put in the order for us and charged us when he came back - that would've gotten a point for customer service. It was also smokey even though you couldn't smoke in the Wing King area obviously the ventilation system was non existent as the smoke from the bar came over.

Their one and only dessert? Peach cobbler wasn't a cobbler it was more of a peach compote. Can't call a cobbler a cobbler if there's no dough. Instead it's crust was all sugar it was too sweet and the unexpected crunch of the sugar crust didn't help.

Plus the one thing I found funny was that they offered a two for one on the cobbler if you gave them a five star rating on Yelp ..... I probably would have gone for it if I hadn't forgot to bring my phone with me so I didn't have to share dessert but glad I didn't anyways since it wasn't as good as I had hoped.

Nothing here is a fluke. The menu is varied and well thought out. On our first visit, we tried the Fyah Buds and some Chipotle Medium and Medium Jamaican Jerk wings. The Fyah Buds are little nuggets of pure joy! Cauliflower is breaded in a flavorful and light breading, deep fried, and served with an amazing Green Chile Ranch dip that they should bottle and sell. The wings were hot and fresh with just the right amount of kick and spice. One of the unique things about eating here is that you can add CBD [Cannabidiol] oil to any wing sauce or dip sauce! Yes, actual CBD oil! So you can eat great food and ease your pain all at the same time! Gotta love Las Vegas! 

On our second trip I had the Bomb Diggity Brown Sugar Bacon Burger and OMG...wow.  After taking one bite, I had to pause and enjoy all of the flavors that were dancing on my tongue! The burger was juicy, and the toppings and sauces blended together so well that I didn't need to add any condiments to it. 

They have over 100 flavors of wings to choose from, so needless to say, we'll be coming back again and again. On some nights they even have live music for you to enjoy.

We live on the far east-side so it's definitely quite a drive for us, but we do it often with a smile. Once we heard they were relocating to their own stand-alone place on the west-side, we were sad but also ecstatic to hear that they would no longer be under the thumb of yet another bar. This place has deserved their own location for a very long time and it was definitely overdue. Their location is absolutely gorgeous and very unique, but at the same time, totally represents who they are and their belief system. This is a great place to walk in after you've smoked a blunt or two in preparation for a very comforting and extremely delicious meal. It is VERY easy to spend about $50-$60 dollars in here for two people because everything on the menu catches your eyes and tempts you to go on a whim and try it...and whatever you order, NEVER disappoints. This is also the type of hole-in-the-wall place that the incredible general manager Brittany and even the innovative owner Brian Peace will personally deliver your meal to your table and will ALWAYS remember a familiar face. 
The 100 royal sauce flavors are creative, one-of-a-kind, and absolutely amazing. And for marijuana enthusiasts, each flavor can be fused with CBD for only $3 extra per pound of chicken and or pig wings. Granted, we haven't tried every flavor just yet, but we try to mix it up every time, and each different flavor we've ordered has always been a pleasant surprise. Everything from their fried pickles and traditional wings, all the way to their peach cobbler and chicken and waffles, are to die for! We wish nothing but the best for Wing King and their new stand-alone location.

I ordered 3lbs of chicken wings to go a small order of fries. Everything was very good. I really like Wing Stop but there isn't one very close by and I hate Buffalo Wild Wings so Wing King looked like a great option.

I ordered 3 flavors; Regular Hot was good, just as any normal hot flavor although I feel there wasn't quite as much sauce as I like. 2nd was Honey BBQ which was really good and had plenty of sauce. It tasted exactly like Wing stops BBQ. The last flavor I tried was supposed to be Mango Habanero. I am skeptical that it was actually the mango Habanero because it had zero spice. They actually weren't sure they had it when I called to order but the lady on the phone said it was available. It may have been mixed up with a different mango sauce but was still very good. All the wings had a good amount of meat so I didn't feel cheated. For 3 lbs I think I counted out 21 or so wings. For $27 that's kinda pushing it. More than a dollar a wing to me is overly pricy which is why I give 4 stars.

The fries were very good and the fry sauce is definitely good. The only real complaint I have about this place was that you get zero Ranch or blue cheese dressing with any wings. Its all extra. I've never seen a wing restaurant that doesn't give you sauce with the wings, especially at the prices they charge.

On a mission to try all 80 flavors !  they also don't make the fries till you get there so they' won't get soggy which is pretty cool.  You get them hot & fresh . Will definitely keep coming back .

The collie-buds were clever but definitely have to be breaded. We pretty much paid $18 for plain cauliflower in sauce. Most expensive cauliflower ever lol the sauces were tasty but when you want ""wings"" I need my cauliflower to resemble wings to some aspect. 

The French fries were absolutely delicious! We finished the whole plate for sure! 

They have a p-dubb(?) pizza that was fantastic! They put some of their new vegan cheese on it and we loved that as well! 

Overall for a $60 meal it fell a little short and would only go back if they changed their collie bud recipe.",rTpsaH0Hz7XW92_tES1B2Q,3,1,3,U-P-FDZbExfMB8HKhaB1Ig

2811910,2016-04-16,7,nPBG-UbMHDMdcnW-HncZNA,"New location. Same awful smoky atmosphere. Wings are still awesome. Yup. Pretty much just like my last review when they were at Adrenaline Sports Bar. 

They used to have a lunch combo that had 6 wings, fries and a drink for $9.99. Here all 3 are complete separate items.  I ended up paying 12 and change for a 6 wings and fries. Soda you are supposed to get at the bar. Fortunately I had cold bottled water in my car.

What I got was my usual Mango Slam flavor for my wings and Fries tossed in Sweet Chili Sauce. Both were amazingly great as usual. That's what I love about Wing King 80 different flavors and you can have your fries tossed in whatever sauce you want as well.

Unfortunately the good food is where it ends. I had to eat the wings in my car so I don't contract lung cancer for the place smells like an ashtray full of cigarette butts. Even if it was non smoking you couldn't bring your kids here for you have to be 21 or older to enter

In closing, you will get really good wings here. I just recommend you get it to go. Unless you like cigarette smoke flavoring on your wings.

There were only two pig wings for half a pound but they were huge, tender, juicy and great flavor. The guy said it's not that spicy and it was perfect for me. I think I'll try the sugar bourbon rub next time. And the garlic Parmesan wings? They were crispy, completed coated with Parmesan and juicy. I mean it was the best wings around here.

We ordered carry out and the food was super underwhelming. Keep in mind if you're ordering carry out they ask you for your credit card info in order to put the order in but don't actually charge your card until you get there... 

Food: 

1lb of chicken tenders EXTRA crispy with the mild garlic. Every single piece was soggy as if it were drenched in water. The breading didn't hold that crunchy texture like it should.. very mushy. There also was a hair stuck to the side of the tender so yeah....

1lb of lemon pepper bbq- I've never in my life tasted a lemon pepper wing so bland... decent sized wing though so they weren't a huge fail

Fries- these weren't bad but I was surprised the girl that took the order didn't advise that these are heavily seasoned. We were expecting plain fries... I could see this being a problem if you don't like spices! 

We also received blue cheese instead of the ranch we paid for which was yet another let down.

Overall, we likely won't give this place a second chance after reading the reviews further. 

2 stars because they gave us a refund on the tenders but made us drive all the way back there to bring them to them =\",rRSX6CLmQryEQFUvOTlYrw,3,0,2,jJBRgtuRvSjTubT5JSQO7g

The tea is a rare find in the valley, and Wing King has some of the better tea I've had in restaurants here. The restaurant has a reggae/irie theme and everyone is very laid back.  Not so laid back that quality and customer service aren't a priority; there's definitely love and pride in their food and service.  They have over 60 different wing flavors.  I'm not adventurous when it comes to spice, so it's nice that there is a decent selection of non-spicy flavors, with everything from a bourbon brown sugar sauce to a blueberry sauce.  I also like their ""pig wings"" pork selection and CBD infused collie buds (cauliflower bites).  Both can be done in the various flavors.  The CBD oil is optional on the collie buds.  The food has always been fresh and delicious.  It's a little pricey compared to other wing places, but the quality and the kind service makes that little difference somewhat bearable.

The wings are BIG and meaty... They weren't really crispy, in fact, the wings were soft. We tried the mild buffalo, the jerk, and the sweet chili jerk sauces. BOTH of the jerk sauces were zan amazing flavor. The mild buffalo was b*a*s*i*c at best. I think the wings were temperature hot at one point, then tossed in cold sauce. That's problematic. We also ordered the loaded garlic cheese fries. First of all, this serving is HUGE. It had great potential. Imagine the breading from a mozzarella cheese stick on a French fry with melted cheese. Like I said, it had potential. The fries were thick, hand cut, and UNDERCOOKED. Not crispy and crunchy like they should've been, and the seasoning lacked that Italian flavor that is mentioned in the title.  They were also served with the smallest ramekin of marinara sauce. Whaaaatttttt!!!! My son ordered a burger, which looked stacked and legit when it was brought to the table. There was a knife stuck in the bun to keep it altogether... It was about to be ON...except our waitress, took her fingers to the bun in order to pull the knife out. YES, full on contact, and acknowledged it, while it was happening. I was at a complete loss of words, and just couldn't say anything. So, sad to say, we won't be going back. I love to support mom and pops restaurants here in town, but Wing King has to kick it up a notch or there residency will be cut short. So much potential here...

We walked in for lunch on a Friday afternoon and there were only a couple of other people in there. That should've been clue #1. 

The menu is huge with 100 different sauces for your wings! They'll even mix some of the flavors for a crazy combination. The menu has something for everyone, from salads and burgers to wings and fingers. The chicken wings and fingers are all sold by the pound, so come hungry. We took home massive amounts of leftovers (and we are both big eaters).

We ordered iced tea (fresh brewed but too weak), chicken wings, chicken fingers, and cauliflower ""wings."" Hubby raved about the wings, saying they were legit spicy and were cooked as ordered (he got 'em well done for maximum crispiness). 

I had the cauliflower ""wings"" which were a great concept but poorly executed. I got a huge plate of slightly blackened, roasted cauliflower tossed in mild buffalo sauce. It was very spicy to me and set my mouth on fire. The cauliflower was a little too ""soft"" and didn't really feel like the other veggie ""wings"" I've had at other places. I think a tweak to the recipe and preparation style would make this dish a superstar. 

The chicken fingers were downright odd. They are super long (uh, how do they do that?) with a sweet and crispy coating. The flavor reminded me of the old Captain Crunch fingers from Planet Hollywood if you remember those! They were good but I don't think I'd get them again. 

The sauces were all good, from the honey mustard to the super hot sauce. Service was good as well. The issue here is how slooooooow the kitchen is. Yeah, I know wings take forever to cook, but we were in the restaurant two hours. During the workday. No wonder nobody else was in here: don't come here if you have to get back to work! I knew there was an issue when there's a sign on the door before you even walk inside that basically says ""we're slow.""

The restaurant has a Reggae theme and a decidedly 420-friendly vibe. I would dine here again but next time I'd call in my order beforehand. Honestly, heed my warnings: THE KITCHEN IS VERY, VERY SLOW.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,14,8,3,Kx_x1EGC9t7sE75iPXg0fg

The food was great. I got chicken and waffles and the syrup on the wakes was amazing. Even though the wake was swimming in the syrup, it wasn't overwhelming at all. The sauce in the wings was perfect. 

The burger and fries my son got was great. And the so we're the wings my husband got.

So flavor wise, the food was great.

The reason I'm giving them 2 stars:

1. We ordered their parmesan cheese fries as an appetizer. We didn't get them until after mine, my son's and my husband's food came out. First, the server said they take a while to cook because they're hand cut, then fried, then they season it and cover it with cheese then baked to melt the cheese. She told me this after we'd been there for over 30 minutes and i asked about the fries. When we got our orders and still didn't get the fries, she then told us the cook over cooked them so they had to cook a new batch. So finally we're done eating or did and the fries (appetizers) arrived. Then she also told me the food takes a while cuz they only have 6 fryers. During Superbowl they had to rent more fryers to keep up with the orders. How does a wing and fry place not have enough fryers? After a while, she tells us they're comping the fries since we didn't get them until after we were done eating our other orders. 

2. My daughter ordered a kids pizza which cost $10. So over priced for a kids pizza. The problem with her order was she never got it. After we'd already been there for almost an hour, I asked them about it and she said it takes a while cuz they have to too out the dough. Wtf?! A few minutes later we asked again and she said, they're cutting it right now, it should be coming out  so we asked for it to be in a to go box and we asked for our check.

3. There was only 4 of us and they couldn't bring out our orders  around the same time. First, I got my chicken and waffles. About 5 minutes later my son got his burger and fries. Another 5 minutes later, my husband got his wings. It was about 20 minutes later before my daughter even got her pizza. There were  3 tables of about 8 people each, and they were all getting their orders out together so they actually got to eat their food at the same time. 

If the service was better, I'd give this place 4 stars because the food was good

I thought that these wings were ok. However that being said, we ordered wings with the sauce on the side. I felt that it had a great crunch but was still moist inside but was missing flavor without the sauce type of deal. I like wings that I can eat plain and still have flavor but I felt like the only way it had flavor was putting on the sauces that they have lots of. Don't get me wrong, the sauces were good but sometimes it can be overbearing. I think if the sauces were mixed with the wings, which is how it is normally served then it would be delicious. Unfortunately I have two kids that don't like the sauces and like chicken wings too. 

This place is pretty busy and our wings were nice and hot. I just wished it had more flavor plain!",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,4,3,4,oOcrgiE8ilR2CxyqmcnUgw

Thanks to the glowing Yelp reviews we made the trek across town to this little gem for some wing feasting and happily enjoyed what have to be the best wings in town! I ordered the strips while my boyfriend opted for traditional, and also splurged on some French fries and fried Gouda bites- those of which I'm still craving the next day and seriously considering driving back for more! Both strips and fingers are done to perfection and all sauces we tried (with 80 choices available, there's something for everybody!) had a delicious homemade taste. The owner was kind to suggest that I try a new concoction of his which was a watermelon BBQ- what a treat! The generous hospitality we were treated with made a lasting impression and we will definitely be back for more soon. Thank you!",pgMxiwSL7Hhz98jxCkYqHA,2,1,5,R2XKYVMxhsoHo9O53Hc8fw

First glace around, and there's a ""stoner"" feel to it lol. Photos by THCFotos, on the menu you can add CBD to your sauces, and the reggae music playing in the background.  The place overall seems really chill and laid back.

Prices...Lawd!! The place isn't cheap for wings! You order them by the pound and there around 7 wings per pound. My boyfriend got 2lbs w/2 flavors and they came to 17.99! That's a bit much for me BUT he loves wings so Yolo!

Wait time...At this location everything is made to order so the waitress made a note to tell us that just in case the wait time seemed a little long. 

......THINGS ABOVE WERE WRITTEN B4 I GOT MY FOOD...

The food arrived in like 7 mins if that of us ordering, super fast in my opinion!! 

I ordered the Pig Snacks in triple garlic MILD & waffle waffle sweet potato fries. OMG! These fries were soooooo good, the seasoning was so good, never had sweet potato fries that tasted like this. It's like a bbq seasoning was added to them.

The Pig Snacks were like drum sticks but pork! They were good BUT i dont handle spicy food well. I ordered the MILD but i could only eat 3 of the 4 (i kinda forced myself to eat the 3rd one). It was so spicy to me! I should've asked for a sample of the sauce, even though it was mild, it was spicy to me. Overall id give them a 5 out of 10 because they were good but too spicy to enjoy.

My boyfriend got 3x garlic Spicy and Curry Hot...all i got from him was ""They are Good"" lol 

Overall I enjoyed the fries, environment (music), and the staff. I personally wouldn't return because of the prices, but Wing lovers would want to try this place out because they offer 100 different flavors of wings!! 100!!!",VAzxJu-0d-2d22utN90sYA,1,0,4,O_2Yq31F17jh8Qo6qFD9WA

    I wasn't quite sure if they delivered and they were not on any third party delivery service so I contacted them through Facebook. I received a response right away from Brian and he assured me they do deliver and no order was too small (I was only ordering food for two people). 
    
    Around 2 PM I finally called to put in my order and the girl on the phone was awesome! So polite and wanting to help. I ended up ordering four lbs of chicken tenders for $32.00, with four different flavors: Honey BBQ, Garlic Parmesan,Garlic Teriyaki, and Sweet and Sour. The girl also threw in ranch and their garlic butter.

   When the food was ready I received a call from their delivery driver, David, just to let me know he was on his way and to quote me on the time. Really cool! Our food arrived on time and the driver was super polite and courteous. 

    We tried the tenders and they were DELICIOUS! Their Garlic Parmesan was perfect for my liking and my second favorite was the Honey BBQ. The Garlic Teriyaki was great and also the Sweet and Sour, although the boyfriend doesn't eat a lot of spicy food so he stayed away from the Sweet and Sour which had a little but of a kick to it. Their garlic butter is now one of my new favorites to dip with the tenders, then some ranch!

On a side note tho....  I had my vintage cigarette case stolen from me right from under my nose while sitting at the bar. When I confronted the only person who could have possibly stolen it, they denied it. When I said I would call the police they scrambled fast! Super sucky. It belonged to my grandmother.

It's hard to explain-  but it's not a typical wing place you'd think.

IF you are going to give his place a try I'd much advise you to order the pig wings instead of chicken-  much better flavor and don't taste frozen and over cooked dry.

The sauces and flavors are pretty good.  
I guess what I couldn't get over was the reggae vibe but they forgot to take down the ristras from when this place was a New Mexican restaurant -  hanging red chile pod decorations.  As well they left the Luminarias up too- 

The tables (which look like the same tables from before) were hastily painted black with latex based pant so they are sticky and ""dirty"".

Great selection, really cool atmosphere and music (assuming you like Reggae), the ""pigs wings"" are an excellent idea. Now onto the average. The food was just ok, I was expecting something superior to Wings Stop and was left disappointed. The bad. Apparently their waffle maker has been broken since November- they should remove there chicken and waffles selection if they are not going to fix the waffle maker. The fried pickles are incapable  of being eaten - they are shockingly salty. We ordered a four pound sampler and only one tiny ranch sauce comes with it. They will happily  give you more ranch at $0.69 per order. I had never been charged for ranch sauce before. They allow you to sit yourself while many might feel this is charming and friendly the concept doesn't work when a place is busy. As we were seated we saw other people who wanted to sit at dirty tables. The staff does their best to clean the table as soon as possible for the customer, but the customer is left to seat at their 2nd choice while waiting for this to occur. The whole process leads to chaos when they are busy. Our waitress, whom was very friendly, was filthy. I have worked in the restaurant industry, I know you get dirty. This was a different level. I didn't really want her near my table. The management needs to insure their employees go in the back and use a clean wet rag to try to clean themselves off on occasion. The last thing a customer wants is to be served by someone who looks like they lost a fight with an exploding food processor.  All in all I would not go back.

I wasn't crazy about the texture of them however to be completely honest - I prefer my wings to be a bit more on the crunchier side and fully cooked.
As far as sides - the fried gouda bites are heavenly! Try dipping them in the wing sauce for a next level experience. Note - these are nothing like cheese curds if that's what you're expecting.
I don't know if this was worth the drive all the way from where we were staying on the strip. But if you're in the area - it certainly wouldn't hurt giving them a try.

It took 52 minutes to receive any food at all. The child's meal we ordered came first. We then reminded the waitress about our appetizer. Never put in. We had no silverware or napkins. When our meal did arrive,They also forgot our fries. 

The music is not background music. It is too loud. You cannot hear the staff or the people you are there with. 

At this point, I suppose I could stop and not describe the food that was received. But I won't. 

Chicken wings: Cold to the touch. (I guess they were done earlier than the 52 minutes it took to get them to our table. 

Fries:  Soggy and tasteless.

Guda bites: The high point. However the Ranch dressing was very, very thin.

We will be back",miuLlOYWfT6hIJuoe1PkQg,0,0,5,PwAFayIRuRgKlWoLe38nRA

Mouth watering is an understatement, I don't want to wash my hand yet because my fingers have been blessed with goodness and I can't stop licking them.

5950012,2017-09-18,0,nPBG-UbMHDMdcnW-HncZNA,"Best wing place in Vegas!!! Let me just update this review since it's been a while and they've moved locations. This place became my 2x a week place to eat. Brittany the owner is a incredible person, loving, kind and just makes you smile the minute she talks to you. Everything about the new place feels so homey, very comfortable seating, nice jams to listen to, very family oriented. Any concern or issue(which is never) Brittany strives to her best to accommodate you. I kid you not I love these wings, Iv tried multiple places after they closed for a month to relocate and I was disappointed every single time. My favorite is the teriyaki BBQ, my wife gets the wet lemon pepper which is also amazing. Iv tried multiple flavors from hot to mild, normally im a spicy hot lover when it comes to the boneless wings, but for traditional i like the BBQ. Also they updated he pizza and my kid ate even the crust!! And he's 4, idk about you but when I was young I hated the crust lol. But seriously if you live out here don't pass this place up. They Also have CBD they fuse into the wings, not my cup of tea but it's definitely something unoriginal that you won't find anywhere in a different wing place. They are just getting up and running about 3 days ago and they are already killing it. 

If you are a BBQ guy/girl go for the teriyaki BBQ 

Oh and there fries are the only fries I will ever eat again, puts to shame any ans every place out here, one of the first that actually don't taste like chemicals. Real tasting. Absolute fave. I'll order pounds of wings and fries just to re heat for the next day or two.",SEjXquVnM0_2w1sr25RcKg,0,0,5,S3lArlZJOo0ck_VTFZL1NQ

The fries were so good, they are coated with a little flour and sprinkled with ""magic dust"" Enjoyed the reggae music and yes we will be back",3-_bQjgIpamGo5kSGBWJRg,0,0,4,3P1QVIcdJdYcMw7nA8xfNA
