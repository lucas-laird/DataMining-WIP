We went in during a pretty busy (but not packed) evening just to get an appetizer and some drinks. It took over a half hour to get our appetizer and when it came the avacado eggrolls were soggy and the boneless wings were pretty cool. This was our only bad experience here and the ended up voiding our bill because it took them so long to bring us the food (and we didn't even complain!)

I was like... you came to Vegas to eat at Chili's?  But her party said they hadn't been there in a while. We were starving and they were pretty busy for a Saturday night. The wait time was 35 minutes. As a result we were starving and ordered right when we were seated. 

My friend and I ordered under the 2 for $20 menu. I must say, I do like the options at Applebees better. We ordered the Texas Fries for  the appetizer, Cajun Chicken Pasta and  Original Baby Back Ribs. The Texas Fries were much smaller when they came out, and it was covered in cheese, jalepenos, and bacon bites. I didn't taste any bacon bites nor was it spicy at all. In fact, it was actually kind of cold.  The baby back ribs were pretty tasty, but they were kind of cold.  The Cajun Chicken pasta was not spicy at all. Maybe it was just the chicken that was suppose to be cajuny? The best part of the meal was the bread that came with the pasta! The food was mediocre and not tasty at all. It might have tasted better had it not been so cold? Who knows, though. 

The service was pretty good. We were checkd on pretty often. The food quality just didn't match the service.

This is my experience today. As usual, and I think it must be a policy, I'm not greeted at the door when I walk in. I came in after a family of 3. No Greeter was near or in sight. The waiters were working their tables, the bar had only one patron. We stood there for a few. Another family (4) came in after us and a couple also. Finally the greeter showed up and since he wasn't there to greet us when we walked in, had no idea who came in first. So he got the family info and also the couple's .. I asked to just go in the bar area since he had no idea who was supposed to come first. 

The bartender is the saving grace of this restaurant. Lee was attentive even when the bar started to get packed with patrons. He called me by name and made sure I was taken care of. He even sweetened the unsweetened ice tea (ALL RESTAURANTS SHOULD SERVE SWEET TEA!). 

The food was good for a mid day lunch. I had the Big Bites. My problem (which would have made this a 3 star rating if it wasn't for Lee) was that the menu did NOT specify that they put bacon on them. For someone who doesn't eat pork, ruined them. Fries were a little salty, but overall the meal was good. 

SIDENOTE: I have been to several different Chili's and am never greeted at the door and usually have to wait till whom ever is supposed to be at the door to arrive. Waiters just look at you cause that's not their place.

Waitress name: Alicia 
Managers name: never introduced himself (turned out to be Daniel Smith)
He was half rude and never listened to my complaint. I honestly didn't want the meal deducted but he just said fine I will remove it. I said ok but really is that how you handle customer service by not listening. Very poor service.
Update!!
We paid our bill at the table and printed out our receipt. After the talk with the manager we were never offered refills or ever spoken to again.  How hurtful.  We got up and were walking out the front door and the waitress Alicia charges toward us and offers me a piece of paper and says here is your receipt and I replied ""No thank you I printed it out at the table""  she then grabs my husbands hand and pulls his hand out of his pocket forcefully and stuffs the receipt and some cash in his pocket and says ""Here keep this you need it more than me!  I am not kidding this is like a lifetime move it really happened and I am still in shock.  Me not realizing what just happened turned around and saw my husband following her to a station and he stood there until someone retrieved a manager.  I then saw a different manager (Travis McLeod) speaking to my husband and then my husband came to the front door where I was waiting for him inside.  He told me that Mr. McLeod was appalled by the actions of the waitress and said No we don't treat our customers like that.  I am not sure how to remove the stars to a zero but I am copying this review to Chiils main office and management of the location on Las Vegas Blvd in the Belz Mall that we went to.
I feel Alicia should not be serving guests or dealing with the public. Calling people liars is not a good mirror image that Chili's has spent years creating.",e0Jn0ZjqL-dWi7Brs0bbmg,1,1,2,5_P2i3IM3jN_W4bEbAmYng

She comes back, puts the drinks on the table and walks away. Comes back after a few minutes: ""Have you decided on food?"" Takes our order and walks away; and that's how our interaction was throughout our meal. No ""excuse me"", or ""you're welcome"". Or a smile.

 There was this device on every table like a note pad  that I've never seen before, I asked the waiter what it was and he told me that it could be used to order additional drinks during the meal or dessert if I wanted to, also it could be used by kids to play games while waiting for their food  and even to pay your bill at the end using a credit card. I decided to give it a try and ordered dessert while we were eating. When we were done with the food they cleared our plates and brought the dessert the we had ordered through the machine. I swiped my credit card and paid the bill. Complaining about not seeing the waiter days are over, he's right there at the touch of a screen.

Our service was the worst I have ever had. The server took about 10 mins to come out and greet us to get our drink order. After the order was taken it took about 45 mins until our food hit the table, we ordered salads, boneless wings, soup and a burger. I'm sure it doesn't take this long for that stuff to come out of the kitchen. While waiting we had to walk to the back of the kitchen to ask for refills and status on food as the manager was in the back talking to the one cook. Finally we get our food and my burger had 4 French fries on the plate and all the food was cold. Once we got the serves attention after 10 mins of not seeing her anywhere she explained they ran out of fry. I told her it was unacceptable to send a plate out to a table looking like that..she then began to explain that it's not her fault because the regional manager refuse to hire more people and that they force the managers to cook and serve...I had to tell her I really didn't care and just wanted my food fixed and hot. I had to asked to speak to the manager 3 times before coming out after 10 mins of waiting. After i expressed my concerns she just stood there looking at me like I was gonna give her detention. I felt bad cause it seemed this happened all the time and it was nothing new to her but knew she was unable to fix the issues herself. The manager comped my meal (salad) but that was the only meal comped although my party of 6 all had awful food. I hope this helps their employees reach out to management that there are issues that need to be fixed.

We were sat quickly, greeted quicky, served drinks quickly and efficiently. The order was placed and we didn't wait long for the food. We were never offered chips and salsa.  Did Chilis stop doing this for free or was that laziness on the servers part? 

The enchilada soup is as good as I remember, but the pico was missing from the top. The soup needed to be about a few degrees hotter, but I dealt with it knowing it was close to proper temp.

We ordered the fajita trio and it came out sizzling and in a timely manner. What in the heck is this ridiculous tower of sauces and condiments you guys!? So dumb on the restaurant's behalf. This is annoying for both customer and server. 9 ramekins to fill this tower with what seems like a tablespoon at best of each condiment!? Come on! Can we get any cheaper? This is totally tacky.

The fajitas were completely below standard. The beef was chewy, not tender and the chicken was covered in this funky orange sauce. What did you guys do to the perfect fajitas we use to have!? So disappointed. 

After eating what we could tolerate, the server presented the check after offering dessert and the kiosk at our table was down. The hostess spent 30 seconds explaining the check out process, all to find we couldn't do ourselves. What happened next? I had to flag a manager down. He runs the check, never asks if everything was ok, never did a table touch.

Boy oh boy, I am not sure I want to claim to be a Chilihead anymore after this experience. Chilis has always prided themselves on holding things to the highest of standards. What is happening at this location?

I even noticed broken lights in the front of the store, I mean this store is on the world famous strip! You guys are serving customers who may have never had Chilis in their life!

The only reason I'm giving it a 2 star rating is because our server Cyndi was so nice.  If she wasn't our server then it would've been a 1 star.",Spp4T4DBJUMCtX9xZDoKdg,0,0,2,mO2mV7BwRoKpNs8Bq4S1pQ
2069883,2018-04-08,0,MDVbJicJvqaO4WGx0vEabQ,"How do I start. My husband, my children, and I eat at this restaurant at least twice a week and we have NEVER had an issue here... actually the opposite. We have always had great service and the two Mae managers are amazing! Today we had the most terrible service we had ever experienced there. The waitress named chelsey was very unengaged and seemed like she had an attitude at the beginning. We felt very pressured when Ordering our food. For example I worded the bacon burger and she didn't even let me finish ordering what I didn't want in the burger and she didn't ask if I wanted it pink or no pink. Then she jumped to my husband asking him what he wanted before I could finish ordering. I got the loaded potato soup and I got it very cold and my husband ordered the chili soup and when we got it it didn't look like chili soup... looked more like sloppy joe meat in a bowl. The girl didn't even explain that the Chili soup wasn't the same as the one they used to serve a few days ago. My burger came out almost burnt with no onions in it when I ordered was no bacon or pickles. My husband ordered the same and his burger came out literally uncooked with a lot of blood on it (I took a picture of it). The managers were very understanding and helpful and she avoided us the whole time and didn't ask how we were doing or if we needed refills. 

Like I said before I NEVER had an issue here ever! I love this place but this waitress was terrible! And when ever we asked for ranch or anything she had an attitude about it and when brought to us it's like she just threw it on be table and walked away as fast as she could......",jbkUJaG3wGWBdctKCJg8CA,0,0,1,OQOPg8IRgWO270fNK1DI3A
2078708,2013-07-18,4,MDVbJicJvqaO4WGx0vEabQ,"I can always rely on this place! This particular store is conveniently located about 5 minutes from my house, and I've revisited plenty of times. The hostesses and waitresses have always been friendly, and service has always been excellent! The food is always great as well...probably the most consistent place that I've been to. I'd have to say Chili's and In-N-Out Burger are my favorite places to eat off of the Strip on a regular basis. I don't remember a single time that I've been disappointed in my dining experience.

My most recent visit on 7/17 during lunch hour was top notch everything! My waitress Ruby was awesome and had a sweet and approachable personality. She kept the refills coming, and checked frequently to see if everything was ok. There was even another waitress that checked once on my table as well. 

I loved everything on the menu so far. Maybe I just click with a certain type of food style, and this is it. Previously I've tried the Southwestern Eggrolls, Texas Cheese Fries, Tostada Chips, Fajitas, Ribs, Fries, and Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie. I may even be missing some items throughout all the times I've visited. All so delicious. And I can't forget about the Blackberry Iced Tea. One of my favorite drinks ever. Just sweet enough. So refreshing! 

It's hard to believe that as someone who loves burgers, I haven't tried one here until this visit. I recently went on a Strip ""burger tour,"" looking for the best burger in Vegas. I tried a handful of different burgers, all good, but never found one that justified the price. But after all this time, something I was looking for was right in front of me. The Chili's Classic Bacon Burger. For under $9 with your choice of side (lots of options available, including light broccoli and fries). The bun is soft, the patty was prepared to perfection, the bacon was delicious, even the pickles were tasty and not too salty. A perfect burger. It's still breakfast time and I want another one right now!

I think this is the best neighborhood restaurant by far. If I had to choose one place to eat at everyday, this would be it!",b1wjZL3EBm4h2vbeXjfcTA,3,4,5,sEAIMtO4Wa0Sv_Yc0wVdkw

Must've been low on staff because we got one of the rudest servers I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Don't come here in a good mood because you'll leave extremely irritated. Anything we tried to order, we'd get cut off and told we couldn't get that. I've never been told we couldn't order something because the WAITRESS didn't agree with it. ""Wait, your child wants BOTH entrees?"", ARE YOU WATCHING MY CHILDS DIET?, ""so you wanna pay extra?"" ARE U PAYING FOR MY FOOD?.. ""We don't allow adults to order off the children's menu"".. but if you don't serve grilled cheese to adults, why can't I order from the children's menu to get it?!?!? Or we'd get hit with side comments like, ""Wow, you must be really hungry""... Yeah silly, that's why we came in here! Too bad I'm losing my appetite thanks to you. 

Being that we came in on a holiday, we were pleasantly surprised that Chili's wasn't as busy as the neighboring restaurants (especially after being the third or fourth spot we tried to visit but found to be too crowded); but after experiencing the service & thanks to this Waitress with an Attitude, we can understand why people weren't lining up at the door.

Thanks for the experience Chili's, at least I know Customer Service is not a main concern for your establishment... I just wish my family and I didn't have to be the ones to find this out.

We could see she was running around from table to table, but we were good and she didn't lack in her service to us. 

I had the southwestern egg rolls as my meal. Even though its an appetizer, it's definitely a generous amount to fill you up. I love them especially the ranch sauce dressing they serve with it, yum!! 

When we went to pay we tried to use the kiosk on the table but the bill that came up wasn't ours. We tried to clear it out and pull it up again but it still wasn't ours. We saw a hostess walk by so we stopped her and asked her about it. Her response threw me back, ""I don't know, I can't help you with that, best thing to do is findnyour sever and ask her"". I'm sorry but What the Heck?! I looked at her and she looked at me like what else do I want...I said ""uh ok"" and she walked away. 

Seriously, how rude! I mean even if you don't know, last I checked I was still the customer and as part of customer service the least you can do is help me figure it out or maybe you can get my server for me instead of telling me to ""find her"".

2703466,2017-04-23,0,MDVbJicJvqaO4WGx0vEabQ,"Easter Sunday. The birthday girl wanted chicken tenders from Raising Cane's but apparently they were closed for the holiday. We had just come from Cracker Barrel but didn't want to wait two hours, which is why we ended up here. Everyone was hangry and it was right next door to Cane's so we settled for Chili's. Birthday girl couldn't escape the wonderful smell of a cheeseburger, and she's not even eating meat right now! I am glad we did because our visit was more than I expected.

So let me start off by saying that yes, there are A LOT of 2 and 3 star reviews here, and yes, mine is a 4-star, BUUUUUUTTTTTT, knowing that you're gonna have to wait a little extra for your food to come out or that the service might be a tad bit below what you'd get at a Michelin   star rated fancy foo spot is only half the battle when going to a chain restaurant. You should already know this, and in my opinion, unless you've aged more than an extra 30 minutes, this should not be factored into your review, when reviewing a middle of the road chain restaurant. With that being said, yes, our food did take a minute to come out, but what made this visit memorable was the enthusiasm, charisma and charm of our server Shani. This young lady was just full of energy and friendly. She didn't pull no punches and told us the food was a little slow coming out because they were short handed, and she kept coming out just to shoot the shit with us, which were both greatly appreciated.

Moving on to the food, it was delicious and worth the wait. We got the Wisconsin cheese curds (ooey gooey goodness of fried cheese!!!!!!), wings and some kind Southwestern chicken and black bean egg rolls and all were good to go! My boy and I split a 3 item bbq plate that came with a whole corn on the cob, fries and piece of garlic bread. We opted for the ribs, which were fall off the bone and yummy, the jalapeno cheese sausage and chicken tenders. The chicken tenders were crispy, crunch and went perfect with their chipotle ranch or whatever it was. The sausage was basic, but it had a nice level of spice to it, and the cheese didn't overpower the flavor of the sausage itself. This was more than enough for us to share, but if you're a big eater, you might now want to! My wife and daughter split a chicken club, which is what I originally wanted, and again, it was more than enough food for them to share, but next time we come back, I'm gonna get that, but ain't no way in hell I'm sharing!

Overall, Shani would be the reason I'd go back to this particular Chili's in Vegas, even though there's plenty of dining choices out there.",eJBDhJRZhuL49rCNh_QnMQ,0,0,4,_9G-Qa9gcamtup1nDwO5sQ

Ciara made our experience!
The food was typical of the basic family American restaurants. I got the buffalo chicken salad and while it was really good, i would probably ask for the dressing on the side next time and be prepared to take 1/2 home! My friend got the chicken salad and liked it, the kids got chicken and Mac and cheese but really loved the corn on the cob. The corn came on two wooden sticks for handles and they enjoyed eating it that way but then we pulled one out and they got corn lollipops lol! An even bigger hit! The chips and salsa are always good, even got the picky kids eating salsa and asking for it at home lol! 
Overall good not great food but excellent experience, if have kids ask for Ciara!! We would go back to have her as our waitress!",-8syaSLDbMXW2F2FApVgig,3,3,4,D_IxH2yA5plbJ3oyGO6arQ

I got a to-Go order yesterday with my fiance for lunch and the whole expeirience was bad. Took 10 mins to place my order, and had to endure some plump chick staring dead at me. The woman that took my order was cool and polite. She said it would be 10-15 mins. So I placed our order, then run to the Mcdonalds in the same shopping center to get our son a happy meal and came back. That took atleast 15-20 mins. So I came back, wait at the bar.....no one comes up to me. Im clearly not standing here cause im the Health Inspector, like wtf?? So the nice woman comes from the back and finally asks if she could help me. I said im waiting for an order and she said she would check to see if its ready. Mind you its already been 15 mins since standing and waiting for my food. So a manager comes out and I ask to speak with her. I told her I've been waiting for my order for almost 40 mins. She tells me that someone will be bringing my order out shortly, and here im thinking"" are you guys all in on this??"" So finally a woman comes out with my order and apologizes. I asked for a shot for the trouble and she did give me one without any question. So I get in the car and we check our orders, and why are we not suprised that the order is wrong. I go back in and tell them its the wrong order and they apologize and get the right order. Now when i placed the order I specifically told the girl ringing my order up i wanted crispy chicken instead of grilled and she said they had no problem doing it. Whhhhhhhhhhhy was the chicken grilled?? Long story long, this was the worst Chili's I've ever been too. And my girl said her turkey club sucked!!!",v63s_QngaH6ywFMNM_YclA,0,0,1,7qnH8nuOTpZwZl5_03lvNw

2861496,2012-02-21,0,MDVbJicJvqaO4WGx0vEabQ,"I haven't been to Chili's for awhile, but due to time-constraints / work schedule; I decided to meet Jade here for lunch.  We went on Sunday.  I didn't know this ,but if you sit at the bar on Sundays, it's happy hour all day.  Selected appetizers are on the happy hour menu for a discounted price.  You also get free chips and salsa!

Pros:
  * We went during lunch hours.. it seemed really busy, but nonetheless we got sat immediately.
  * The waitress was very nice and checked on us numerous times.  I can happily say that I didn't have to hunt down a waitress to refill my Sprite.
  * Cheap eats...especially during the Happy Hour

Cons:
  *  We ordered the Cajun Pasta and the Wings and just really wasn't thrilled about neither.  The wings were boneless and the sauce overpowered the taste of chicken.  The pasta was really thick, but at the same time lacked in flavor.  The best part about it was the grilled chicken that I added on for an extra charge (you also have the option of adding shrimp for an additional charge).  

 Overall:
  To be fair, I failed to realize that the pasta dish was Penne (which I totally hate).  I really feel as if I just made some bad choices with my order.  I know Chili's has burgers that are on-point every time I order them.  The service was good and the prices were too.. and you definitely can't beat free chips and salsa!  Nothing spectacular, but not horrible either.  

Tips:
  *  Sit at the bar if you come on a Sunday... Happy Hour all day + Free Chips/salsa
  *  Appetizers on the Happy Hour menu are of a smaller portion.. just a heads up
  *  If you are looking to catch some sports, there are flat screens throughout the bar.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,1,3,o_73M8zeFIP0u5CsjnIVkw

Servers were walking our section but just kept ignoring us. Finally once someone came we placed all our orders and I felt like it still took longer than usual to get our drinks. Our server had a feeling like either he was asked to stay late to take our table or as if he came in late for his shift and had to hit the ground running and catch up.

It was nice to see Blackberry iced tea on the menu, since not many places have that in their iced tea selection. The Avocado Burger was good, but nothing special. It was on a wheat bun with avocado, red onion, and Swiss topped with avocado-ranch. They knew that we were sharing so they brought it out to us cut in half already (always an added bonus).

My reason for docking stars is because I feel like the company enforces the staff to care more about bottom line rather than customer satisfaction. For instance when ordering a side of avocado - you expect an actual side rather than two-three small slices. Or if you ask to substitute something especially if the substitution is cheaper why would I get charged extra for it. I felt like they were nickel and dime'ing me and that's not what I want from a restaurant.

It was a bit busy and they do not have much room for waiting. The wait time to be seated was relatively short for the amount of people there. We were able to get our drinks and appetizers really quick after ordering. The problem was the entrees taking too long. The food was really great for a chain restaurant with the enchiladas being the best I've had in a long time. The waiter was great and was keeping us up to date about our food. Overall great restaurant with good food but get four stars due to long food wait times and poor waiting area.",ZLdfLR9uHHDRM7doSJq_MA,0,1,4,wLYJ8VuuIRELbRtDGO9t4w

We come in 1-2 times a month, sit at the bar, tip well and usually leave fat and happy. Tonight however, I'm leaving with a horrible taste in my mouth thanks to management. Here's how it went down:

""We'd like the steak nachos""
""We're out of steak, we only have ground beef"" 
""Can you sub out the steak you use for the fajitas?""
""Uhh probably not.""
""Why not? We want steak nachos, you have steak and nachos, I don't understand"" 
""Hold on let me ask management""
""Management, no because we're almost out of steak""

So instead of maybe having to 86 steak fajitas later in the evening, they said no to two regular customers, just in case. Bad idea. 

Rule #1 of hospitality, always do everything you can to accommodate the guest. 

Rule #2 keep regulars happy.

3873221,2014-07-17,3,MDVbJicJvqaO4WGx0vEabQ,"Normally a review for Chili's would not be something I'd feel compelled to write, but we wrote off this place a few months ago due to horrible service and food that tasted frozen and microwaved.  We wound up here yesterday to use to a gift card and the need for something easy.

First thing we noticed was that the tired decor had received a face lift.   Second is that the staff seemed a lot less hostile and were quick to greet and seat us.  Third was that the menu had received an overhaul, which was a nice surprise.

I tried the new slow roasted chicken sandwich (shredded chicken) with homestyle fries.   Both the sandwich and fries were fresh, hot and delicious.  With my meal came a survey to rate the sandwich, which I thought was a great idea to find if people liked their new menu choices.  

They also added table tablets where you can play games, order drinks, see the menu, and pay at your table.  I love being able to keep my credit card in sight!  What was really handy is that it let's you split the check multiple ways with multiple payers. 

Our food was a 5, but the one thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review is that our sodas sat empty for over 5 minutes until we stopped a manager who was walking by.  The place was packed and I think our server may have had too many tables.  We only saw him to take our order and hand us the bill.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,2,3,4,64K65SWfcflFitUdcZQ0sA

It took us a loooooong wait, so if your that hungry pls... save yourself. Food came in and everything looks perfect. Except one detail, the food that I got wasn't that superb. My 1st entree was a Bacon Ranch Quesadilla; it was crispy (yes!) and the steak too! burned and yes ""crispy"" which I never ordered. With that being said, I call our server Sarah and asked if its a normal to have it like that and she honestly said ""no"". and took our order and apologize (thank you for that) in a split seconds the manager Mike came and said ""what seems to be the problem?"" and I replied ""I asked if its a normal way how to cook the food? and Sarah said it was not..."" and then he replied ""Sarah don't know and that's how it is cook. And I took it out of your bill."" and walk away... I felt like it was a rude way to handle the situation. A big no!

After a quick perusal of the lunch menu, I noticed a pretty fantastic deal wherein you get a starter and a main for $8. Sold!

For my appetizer, I went with the chili (Slow-cooked chili with beef, onions & chiles. Topped with cheese.) Chili at Chili's! How could I not?

This was about as mediocre a chili as I can easily recall eating. It tasted like it came direct from some kind of a mix, and it was totally lacking in anything even resembling spice. The direct-from-a-bag shredded cheese atop the dish didn't help matters, surely.

And although I chose to drink water, my dining companion elected to try a cocktail. Now, I know our waitress heard the order because she checked my dining companion's identification. But did a cocktail ever arrive to our table? It sure didn't!

For my main, I ordered the Pork Carnitas Fajitas. When it finally did arrive, I popped open the little container that's meant to hold the tortillas...and immediately noticed that it was completely empty. I flagged down our increasingly inept waitress and pointed out the issue, which, to her credit, she quickly rectified. The dish itself was just so-so, and I've honestly never eaten fajitas without guacamole, so that was a pretty shocking omission in my eyes.

My favorite part was at the end of the meal when our waitress asked us to give her a positive review on an online survey so she can ""get better shifts."" Get real, weirdo.",iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,0,0,2,My82R0VnDy3Gv34pLEEH3Q

Told the server it sounded more like FALSE ADVERTISING.  The server said he would have the Manager come by our table.   Manager never showed.

We came for lunch, it didn't start out super busy but did begin to fill up fairly quickly. Our server greeted us quickly and got drunk orders. After returning and gathering our food orders he became a little scarce but we didn't require much. A bit slow on the drink refills was about it. 

When the food arrived he realized there was cheese on one we requested without cheese. My fiancée requested only tomato and lettuce on his with a side or buffalo and his didn't arrive correct either. It took another 10-15 minutes to get the remade food items and he still did not get the tomato or sauce until he asked.

I especially like the bottomless chips and salsa.  The chips are made fresh and are thin and sometimes still warm.  Additionally, if you eat in the bar they usually give you the chips and salsa for free.

On this last visit I got a bacon and cheese covered steak.  It was the only thing I've ever ordered that I wasn't completely satisfied with it.  The steak was cooked a little more than I requested.  It was good, but it wasn't worth the price.

It was yummy. They have updated their menu and there is so much to choose from. My son enjoys the games on their mini kiosk.,0jxNwWF8DUEFuoD4xMGpgQ,0,0,4,cEKtcnzi7V3U04ZU2LUACg

We planned on visiting the mall close to this location as well upon finishing our meal here and this was a better option then some of the fast food restaurants located in this strip mall. We were seated a bit later than expected. A few tables were needed to be cleaned before being able to be sat and it was actually quite busy here. Our server was pleasant and our food came out in a timely manner. My friends sister had ordered mango tea and it was lacking in flavor and also very watered down. The server brought more mango server but was still lacking tea flavor like it was brewed weak. We started with spinach and artichoke dip as an app before deciding on the 2 for $22 which seemed like a good option but the appetizer they give you is quite small. I'm not sure if it's served that small normally. Had we known we would ordered the 2 for $22 we wouldn't have orders the artichoke dip. It was too much food. I had fajitas and she orders the Cajun pasta that comes with chicken and added shrimp. The server explained it was a .50 charge to add the shrimp. When we got the bill it was a $2.50 charge. That's fine but she didn't explain correctly. The garlic bread that came with the pasta was hard as a rock and my fajitas were served mainly with bell peppers and onions. The meat to veggie ratio was very off IMO. A reason why a don't typically enjoy coming to chain restaurants.

I came in with my party on a weekend night and wait time was between 10 to 15 minutes. 

After we got seated we waited about 10 minutes to get our waters. Then we waited another 10 minutes before we were ready to place our order. Our server was really nice and as busy as he seemed with his other tables I seen the effort in him trying to ensure we were getting in and out quick with our food. It took 20 minutes for our food to come out and I ordered the Honey Garlic Steak & Shrimp with broccoli and mash potatoes, plus a side of fries. Portioning was a 2/5, the shrimp and steak was super small - of course it didn't look like how it would in the menu. Presentation was 3/5, steamed broccoli was very hard, mash potatoes had melted cheese on top but it was dried up, and hard. Taste was 3/5, mash potatoes and broccolis were dried and hard, shrimp simply just tasted like salt, and the steak was okay. My side of fries were forgotten so I had to wait another 10 minutes for it to come out. It was frustrating but in the mean time I needed a drink refill so I either way I had to wait, and put my eating on hold. 

Price for mine and my fiancè's plate plus a drink was about $30 including tax and without tip. If you want to split tabs then do it on their pad that they have at the table, it makes things more convenient for a large group.

I've been to this specific location about 10 times and I freakin' loathe it. My sister asks, ""Rachel, what do you have against Chili's?"" I have nothing against Chili's, it's just this Chili's, along with the one off of Eastern in Henderson that makes a vein pop out of my forehead in rage. The service is horrific. Seriously, what's with this ""helper"" bs that Chili's has started? It's ridiculous because neither waiter asks you if you need anything; they just assume the other one has it covered, so you receive no service, rather than twice the service. 

I went here today, 2/13/11 for lunch with my sister and cousin. Our waitress, Ashlie, and her helper who never introduced herself or checked on us (black, pregnant lady) was good at first. I always order the unlimited soup and salad and every time I ask for my salad to come out with the chips, because I never eat the chips, it comes out after the chips are empty. Without fail, the waiters have NEVER given me my salad along with the chips, except today. Wow. Amazing! Jesus must be coming back soon or something because this NEVER happens. 

Well I guess Jesus sent out a rain check for his second coming because after that, the service went downhill. Our waitress ignored us the entire time. She'd ask other tables if they needed anything, but would breeze past our table, clearly avoiding us. Did we want drinks to refresh our palates? Well, we were SOL because Ashlie was for dang sure not going to get us more drinks. She took my sister's cup to ""get her a refill"" and never brought it back, let alone came back to our table, so my sister went the rest of the meal without a drink. We were never able to flag down our waitress or her helper to remedy the situation. 

While eating, some waitress was complaining about how messy this Chili's was, and asked my sister to move the chair next to her so she could sweep under it. Ummmm... we're eating, how about coming back after we're done eating to sweep the floor? Just a thought. 

When it was time to go, or more, it obviously was time to go because Ashlie threw down the check and walked off telling us ""no hurry,"" it took 15 minutes to get my cousin's debit card back. My cousin had a full plate of chicken crispers and fries and Ashlie piled a bunch of empty salad plates on top of the plate full of food, said she was going to go take it to the kitchen and process the check. Funny. We might have wanted a to-go box, but I guess as the waitress it's safer to assume and just toss it all out, rather than ask the customer what they wanted. She went back to the kitchen, and chatted with other waitresses in the entrance of the kitchen, then was lounging on the hostess podium while chatting with the helper server. She walked past my sister, threw my sister the side eye, put her pointer finger in the air and said, ""hold on"" and breezed on past our table to wait on another table. GEEZE, just give us the debit card back! She plunked it down and walked off. My sister made sure to write a big, fat ""NONE"" on the tip line. 

I'm sick of waiters thinking that young customers means no tip. Actually, no service means no tip. Her tip went from a few bucks, to one buck, to NONE real quick. EFF THIS LOCATION!!!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,3,1,1zXNe-kEmmuVlTt6lKbabg

There seemed to be only one waitress for this area which seemed to make waiting inedible. She was nice enough and we enjoyed her humor. Once our orders were taken for food, it seemed to again take awhile before we finally were able to eat. Our waitress brought our meals after an almost 30 minute wait and then seemed to disappear again, leaving us without drinks for quite sometime. Once we were able to get refills, she  was kind enough to bring us to go cups. The meal process took longer than it should have and I probably won't frequently this particular location.

They added a Margarita Meal Deal for $35 which consists of their regular dinner for 2 options, but now they've added on margaritas! They give you the option to upgrade to their presidente margarita which I suggest you do because it is uh-maz-ing. 

The main reason why me and my boyfriend love Chili's is primarily for their texas cheese fries. The combination of fries, cheese, bacon bits, and jalapeños that makes our mouth salivate. As for my entree, I almost always opt for their chicken cajun pasta.  This meal deal also includes strawberry cheese cake which speaks for itself so need I say more?

All in all, I would definitely choose Chili's over AppleBee's and TGIFridays anyway.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,1,2,4,nhzeZvRu7GAtC6Egb5btJQ

Good for a quick bite except the wait can be a bit frustrating on the weekend so try to come on another day if you want quick!,iCSv95THuGHsjzHHUjHdkw,0,0,3,CFyIG6iw5aCCk44wTcY_wg

Be ready to pay $8.99. For a tall glass of ice with a splash of juice . If u complain they might take 1/2. Off the tab but they will not remake it. She offerd to add some sour juice.. i gave a 2.

I have been there a few times too during happy hour. Out of the 10+ times I have been there I have nothing bad to say at all. I also love paying at the table without having to deal with the servers. 

Tip - Tell the server what you want and let them put it together for you. They always have specials and combination deals. They will be more than willing to help.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,2,1,4,zNsexgdF0ik5kGOdoDsbKw

Took about 20 minutes to sit down. Not too long. But then, service was super slow. It took forever to get our order taken as well as quite a while to bring us our food. The pasta was okay. But the mac and cheese was delicious. What killed me at the end of the night was the dessert. I love love love eating dessert and was so excited for the cookie with ice cream since our dinners were just okay and service was slow. Buuuuuut, the cookie was hard as a rock and the ice cream didn't taste that good. Wouldn't choose as somewhere to eat. Probably won't come back unless someone else wanted to go. Then I would know what to expect and suggest dessert somewhere else.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,0,0,1,s1vj_zbJ9zDRWuVkTiikcg
5921331,2014-08-17,1,MDVbJicJvqaO4WGx0vEabQ,"Over the years I have noticed that Chillis Bar and Grill food has gone downhill. They have changed their menu and got rid of some of my favorites. Service in this location was good, my husband and I were noticed by the employees and our server was attentive. Although, I can't give the food a better rating, we ordered our appetizer, I had a sirloin steak and my husband ordered the steak/shrimp fajitas, I had a taste of his dish.
Even my molten lava cake wasn't as great as it used to be. The service made up for the  bland food..",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,2,2,3,RdfWlrAz7H6MW39ZPPtqhA
