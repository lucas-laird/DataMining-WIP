Supposed cause is that there were too many people in the room ~ maybe it was just that night however I had a great time with friends and we're coming back again this Saturday.  Hopefully it will be a better experience.",AuIK5tF2GjO7SftHawTLKw,3,0,3,L7rcSQGVx_R9G6BcdKbyCw

can't really write the review about how fair the pricing is cause i don't know..
i loved the individual rooms for privacy reasons
my only complaint is that sometimes the random background view is distracting when singing. and some of the songs the tune is slightly different from the original 

the staff is very helpful & sweet. i had an awesome time because i didn't realize i was there for about 3 hours lol

some other group supposedly stayed for 10 hrs!",c9ljz9m6Fmmz6A8ITdubqg,0,0,4,S9VbYIZFljgNEidNVKs1TQ

I'm a stickler for exceptional customer service and this place did not even come close to subpar service. I called to check the availability and was told that rooms were on a first come, first serve basis however, the girl (Angela) I spoke with said she would put my name on the list for a certain time to be sure because we were coming and when we got here, she said it was merely a waiting list. Her story changed constantly. She said EVERY ROOM was booked but then another party came in after us and she gave them the room. We asked why they were given the room and not us and she said she thought we just wanted the medium room. But, there wasn't any type of disclosure on her part as far as any other options we had. 

There was no accommodation and no customer service at all. I would never come back here again and I am going to tell every single person I know that comes to Las Vegas to NOT come here. Ever. 

It's blatantly obvious this is an establishment for a certain type of crowd.",Fq5dU33S9NXdD5lvCT_0tA,1,0,1,N2k8ezB43JKlM-4C107oiw
64121,2011-08-09,1,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"I come here almost weekly!! That's why you see 5 stars.

The location isn't in the greatest of neighborhoods, but that doesn't phase me at all.  It's fun and cheap as well, but we'll get to pricing later.

They have private rooms of different sizes: Small, Medium, and Large.  The small room fits up to 5 people.  Any more than that, they'll charge you for a medium room, plus it starts getting uncomfortable.  Medium fits up to 10 people, and it's rather comfortable when there's only a few of you.  The large room is pretty damn large.  It could fit up to 15 people, but I wouldn't recommend going with 15 because that just lessens your mic time.  They also have a VIP room which seats 20.  I've never been in there, but I know they have it.  Lol.

The food is a little overpriced, so I'd suggest eating before and after.  They don't allow outside food or beverages including water so don't get caught with it.  Not only will they possibly charge extra, they might refuse service to you next time.  Lol.  O they have a buy two get one free deal with beer.  I don't drink but I know a lot of you do!! Lol.

They have a huge song list!! Of course depending on what language you get.  Usually I get the Korean/English which has up-to-date Pop songs, but even with the huge selection, I wish they had more!! Recently, we tried the Tagalog/English book and that has good songs which are not on the Korean one.  I wish we could have both, but the machines are different so they have to switch it out.  They'll let you switch halfway through so I might end up doing that from now on.  Lol.

The price of the rooms are hourly, not per person, which is great!! The more people you invite, the cheaper it is for you if you split it evenly.  They have this deal going on that's 50% off from Sunday - Wednesday.  Those are the only times I go.  They accept card but they have to charge at least $10 on it so keep that in mind when splitting amongst your friends.  Lol.

Like I said earlier, this isn't in the greatest of neighborhoods, and it's not the cleanest either.  But it's cleaner than most karaoke places here in Vegas.  Lol.

I don't know why it took so long for me to write a review on this place.  Maybe it's because I got a huge LESBIAN crush on it!! Suck on that!!! LOL.. (Mean Girls reference).",Y3sfm2jsyxa4n_Q1E-1L4Q,4,1,5,Y6lsKTM8oaUrGmRymO27jA

101301,2015-01-10,1,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"THE place to sing, to rap, to drink, and to eat all at the same time!

Located in the same plaza as District One, Icy Juicy, Cue D's, Myxx, and Cafe Moda, this is where you need to go for karaoke. Upon entering, you'll be immediately greeted and be asked how many is in your party. If busy, your name and number will be taken to put on a list. Had to wait 3 hours once so I recommend making a reservation or calling in advance especially on the weekends. If you happen to have to wait, you can drink, play pool, eat, or smoke hookah in the proximal places while you wait for them to call you.

Rooms are all numbered (listed above the doors) and vary from how many people you have with you. There'll be a large center table with couches in its perimeter. You'll get two mics with new cloth covers for sanitary purposes and there are tambourines in the room. The disco lights are adjustable and be sure to use the call button against the wall if you need anything. For the smokers, smoking is allowed in the room. Just ask for an ashtray and they'll give you one. 

As for the music, they range from oldies to more present day mainstream. They also have different languages including Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. Make sure to make the most of your time there by reserving songs in advance! 

The food and drinks... buy two Soju, get one free. We always opt for the yogurt and pineapple flavors. Also, two buckets of beer and you'll get the next free. Drink up because karaoke gets a lot better intoxicated. Haha. Their Korean fried chicken here is bomb. Get it. I recommend asking for the sauce on the side and just dipping it in to preserve the crispness. Their kimchi fried rice is good too.  If you stay long enough, they always give some kind of appetizer on them. We've gotten free fries multiple times.

Pricing is very reasonable. You're charged per hour but there's always some kind of deal going on. We've stayed here for hours and hours, eating, and drinking without limitations with our highest tab at about $200. Mind you, we went a little overboard but a good night shouldn't cost more than $100.

This is definitely the best place to karaoke. I've been to others along Chinatown but never returned to them. The customer service, ambiance, music, food, and pricing cannot be beat.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,7,3,5,qv7onJYJzPsqS2H06tl7Fw

Factors to that however are we were only there for 2 hrs instead of our usual 4 hrs, and only got 2 bottles of flavored soju, but for $15 a bottle, it was good. We got lychee and it was deeeeelcious. It's your basic Korean karaoke establishment with private rooms to sing away with you and and your group of friends. Song books are the same as others I've been too, with your standard giant karaoke remote control wrapped in plastic with English translation so you actually know what you're pressing. Comfy couches, clean room and comes with a tambourine!

We called ahead and were told they would call within the next 2 hrs when a room for 5 was available on a Saturday night, and they called a little after 1 hr later. Taxied their from the Cosmopolitan, and put in our room right away. Got there around midnight.

Service was good, they arrived within a couple minutes after pressing the button. I used the yelp deal for a free shaved ice with ice cream which came with berries and frosted flakes. Pretty good, especially since it's free then later in the night they gave us a free plate of French fries!! It was perfect timing after the drinking! Very pleased with this place! My friends and I definitely plan to come here for all future Vegas trips from now on! If you love karaoke and in Vegas, then this is the place for you!

The room (S) was around $20. We ordered a large soju cocktail and some bottles of water. The total was close to $50 including tip.

They have delicious SOJU drinks - YOGURT being my all time fave. A must order. There are specials where its buy 2, get 1 free and sake its buy 1, get 1.

I've been coming here for a couple of years now and it's safe to say that this is my go-to karaoke spot. I like how the rooms are private so you can embarrass yourself in the comfort of your own group of friends. 
They did a considerate amount of remodeling since I've started coming here and I have to hand it to them, they've done a smashing job. I love the furniture, the extra TVs, and the lighting effects.
The food isn't that great in my opinion. You can get free shaved ice if you give a good review. There's also BOGO alcohol. I don't drink, but that's pretty cool.

This is one of the ""best"" central locations that widely popular for karaoke needs. They have a variety of rooms available ranging from Small to Large and the VIP (x-large essentially). 

Prices are decent, especially when split with people. Big selection for ENGLISH and KOREAN music. Old selections for Chinese. So you can kind of tell what kind of audience/clients they get. 

They recently upgraded their system again but still limited selection but VERY up to date on music (includes recent album releases and movie OSTs like SNSD's Mr Mr or 2ne1's Crush to like Let it Go or Do you want to build a snowman from Frozen)

HUGE selection of food now as well as their drink menu. They've been having an on-going special of buy 2 get 1 free for flavored soju. Yum :P",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,5,2,4,O-FotcDMbQKXaflbgPKZkg

We found Girls Aloud (which we've never seen in a norebang joint), tons of Fleetwood Mac (also sadly missing from many catalogs) and plenty of newer songs. There are several (and I do mean several) song books, so ask for them.

We originally got the VIP room (for a group of four) because it was the only room available; however when a smaller one became available we were moved. The host was considerate enough to save us money. (It paid off because we bought tons of soju.)

The flavored sojus are so good; we got pretty messed up. We got little mini corn dogs for free, some veggie straw things -- it was really nice to get some free stuff.

All the room are very easy to find - they are all numbered and it is easy to look through the windows and see if your friends are in there. If you're there with someone you shouldn't be with, make sure you're wearing a hat lol 

The rooms are clean, the couches are clean, the mics have covers, and the remotes to pick what songs you want are covered in plastic so it stays clean. They even printed out english words and taped it onto the remote so you don't struggle with what everything says on it if you can't read korean. 

The food is pretty good too. My good friend and her boyfriend got the kimchi fried rice and asian style chicken wings and one other and they were pretty good. The chicken and the way it is cooked and seasoned reminded me of the ones they sell in korean ...mmmmm. 

They also have a button the wall so if you need anything they can come straight to the door immediately. They usually come pretty quick so you don't hav to wait forever like other places. The staff is pretty nice too - very friendly and one of the guys looks like he came out of some korean drama haha

The guys greeting us at the front were very welcoming and full of smiles. Great start! Throughout the night, their customer service was just superb. Love the energy and it was a super warm evening so before we left, they gave us each a bottle of water before we left and said to stay hydrated. Thanks guys!! 

Was happy there was one small room left so no wait for us. Came after 9pm, so the small room was $15/hr. Got a pitcher of beer, can of soda and bottle of water. One thing I would prefer they have was a pitchers of water and sodas as an option but it wasn't too big of a deal. They have a large variety of food/snacks and drinks which is awesome! When it comes to music selections, there are a lot for Korean and English. They have lots of other languages also but choices are limited. Example are the Chinese options are older and doesn't have a lot of newer ones. So for our friends who wants to sing Chinese songs, weren't super stoked about. But we all had fun nonetheless. 

Another important thing is a good sound system. It was very easy to adjust on their handheld device which is a first as it usually never comes it right when I'm at other karaoke places so this is definitely a plus. Their system was pretty good where we actually felt like badass singers for once! Hehe

Don't know if they made a wrong order or made too much fries but one of the employees gave us fries on the house. Yay!! It just made our karaoke night experience just that much better.

They're restroom was also pretty big, clean, cool decor with 2 stalls and not a single toilet which always help especially when alcohol may be involved causing much restroom runs.

I was excited because I've enjoyed other karaoke spots and heard really good things about this place. However, I was not impressed and don't think I'll be returning any time soon. They have a no outside food/drink policy, which I understand, but a few friends and I walked in with reusable water bottles and were not told anything about said policy until 10 minutes later when someone came into our room to confiscate them. When I asked the guy questions I was told that we could have received a $200 fine for breaking their policy (that no one had made us aware of) but that they would just hold them at the bar for us this time. There was no complimentary water offered, and a normal sized Aquafina was $1, cash only for purchases under $10. Around 2 hours into using our room someone in our group went out to order food. They were turned away and told that they, in fact, had to leave the studio because it was past 9pm and apparently the place is 21 and over on Friday and Saturday nights. Again, no mention of this when we checked in and the only ID checked was the person who made our reservation. We were told that we MUST leave (even though half of the group was 21+ and we were not ordering any alcohol) because the police drop by frequently. Very bizarre service, especially since the staff seemed very friendly upon first impression. Maybe we should have done more research on the place to avoid these misunderstandings, but my whole group felt very uncomfortable with how things were handled. I will give 3 stars though, because it is a clean, good-looking establishment and there was a good selection of song choices.",CoV9ZvUO90w0oQBIJpPaPg,0,0,3,QN56Vjj84x8Lf0vmxGXBEA

Pretty decent selection of food and alcohol and its non smoking which is actually pretty hard to find in Vegas. The rooms do get pretty loud and typically the music in the lobby is a little on the loud side too. With that being said the room rental price is ridiculously low and their song selection is pretty extensive. There weren't many songs we'd look for and not find.

I went today, and they're holding a 50% off special from Sunday-Thursday. A Small room fits up to 5 people, so for any normal size group, a Medium room shall do! They have songs of Korean, Chinese, and English background. However, there's a good chance, they won't have all of the American songs that you desire, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME! We all have that guilty pleasure song (ahem, Toxic by Britney Spears). 

The rooms are roomy enough to get your groove on and they also have tambourines for an even better time! Their alcohol is also buy two get one free if you need some extra courage to get up and sing/do yo thang!

They have a service button in the room so you don't have to leave to get a drink. The selection for English songs is abundant for many tastes. They have karaoke classics and new stuff. I have to admit the lyrics aren't always accurate. The sound quality is good. The rooms are new and clean. The tambourines are of HIGHEST QUALITY. Okay, they are pretty good at best.

Do I karaoke!? LOL Please. Of course I do. Just don't pass that mic my way at least until after I get that liquid courage into my body.

I'm a big fan of everything about Karaoke Q Studio. Spacious rooms with nice large tables for plenty of drinks, foods, and the occasional table dancing.  Reasonably priced rooms.  Their seats are large and comfy that I almost fell asleep after all the booze. They had an awesome deal on their Sojo and other alcohol last time there, check the board in the lobby area, it was CHEAP. The food they served was surprisingly excellent, a lot better than what I would have expected from a karaoke place.

Yell at the top of your lungs who cares if your good or bad at singing the rooms hold most of the sound inside. Get all wild and crazy. Ring the bell when you need more drinks and foods. They're fast at getting what you need. You need more drinks? Ring. You hungry? Ring. Need more people? Just invite other people over to your room. The remote for selecting your songs are complicated to use, at least it was for me. So many different buttons that did something. Ask for help or just press a bunch of buttons until it plays a song.  Who cares if it's not your song? Sing it.

It's located in a busy plaza so parking can be terrible. I almost gave up on parking after zigzagging through the parking lot.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,14,15,4,9IC4QrZc5Bx5rQHP5NsaKA

We just kind of ended up at Q around 1:30ish because it's open until 5... although I don't think we left until 6.  To be completely honest, I fell asleep around 3.  My ride was not ready to go.

We got rounds of soju-- 4 bottles per pail.  Also, we had some fries; however, we were all there really to sing.  Those that don't really like to sing in public this is the spot for you to just sing in front of your friends.  I think I was having too much fun with the tambourine.  There are alot of cool things you can do with the songs like change the key or octave that it is in.  Also, you have to love the background videos that usually don't really fit the songs to well.  Ah, that makes me miss my home town.  

The song list was pretty eclectic.  Viet ballads? Check.  J-pop? Of course.  Korean cartoon theme song? Sure.  Tagalog love song? Why not?  While we're at it, let's through in some Rage Against the Machine for good measure!  This is by far the most diverse list I've seen in awhile.  It's good for those times you need to sing some Pilita Corrales, Sweetbox, Maxwell, and Metallica all in the same session.  Because of the diversity, the depth of the songs for any genre or even really new music is lacking.  Don't fret the karaoke classics are still there.  Sweet Caroline bah bah bah!  

As always, if you venture to a place like this with moi, know you will end up singing.  Don't fight the urge.  Just get up and do it.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,3,3,4,nqA2dQdpMLZQy1ZjqC6AcA

2639443,2015-07-20,8,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"One of my ways of de-stressing or having fun is Karaoke. Love this place for their drink specials, food, and of course, singing my heart out. Their happy hour starts from when they open at 6p-9p with half off rooms and drink specials. Time sure flies by with you're having a good time here. Four hours felt like two hours! :P

This place remodeled all their rooms, karaoke equipment, and even the restrooms. The couches are plush, modern fancy dancy. I felt like I was in a ritzy boutique hotel in San Francisco! Love it! Even the ceramic wood floors were brand new. It felt like a new karaoke place opened up, but Q Karaoke has been around for years. Nicely done!

Q Karaoke is located next to my favorite Thai Restaurant, CHADA. In between W. Desert Inn Rd. and Spring Mountain Rd. on S. Jones Blvd. Smack right in the middle of the business complex with many other restaurants, pool hall, and boba cafe. The doors are pitch black, but they are open all the way until six in da morning!!! If you have a large group, you can even call ahead, at least one day in advance for the VIP room to reserve for holiday or birthday parties.

I love their Sweet Potato Fries without the sugar sprinkled on top, Spicy Seafood Soup, and when I used to eat chicken... their popular Chicken Wings! When my throat starts to get dry from all that singing, I order their Hot Honey Lemon Tea and like magic.. my pipes are ready sing again. They have a buy 2, get one free drink special, which I always choose their Yogurt Soju. It may taste like a weak drink, but it will mess you the *bleep up. Mark my words on that. It's a direct creeper and when the night is over you'll be out like a bulb. My brother drove his friend home one time and he's a big dude that can handle his liquor, but anything with Soju.. is a dangerous thing! He told my brother.. thanks for the ride, opened the car door, and passed out half way out of the car! So don't let Yogurt Soju fool you! It's like a nerdy, sweet Korean girl, but man oh man you have no idea. She will kick your bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. Yeah it""s just like that ;) Have you not watched My Sassy Girl???

Whenever you need anything from the room, you can ring my be-e-ell, my bell, ring my bell. Oh pardon my karaoke moment on yelp.. There's a ringer button on the wall, next to the room door. Push it.. ah, push it, push it real good.. Oooh baby,babeeeeeeeh! I apologize.. I'm having Karaoke Fever right now. Bell goes off and hopefully if the staff are attentive, which most of the time they are.. will be in your room in a flash. Although I was there during happy hour time and rang that ringer button four to five times before any staff came to our rescue of dry desert throats! I even opened the door and tested that ringer out... Yup it's working.. where are they??? Usually if you stay for more than a few hours, they come in and give you a complimentary bottle of some soju mix drink or fruit platter. It doesn't seem to apply during happy hour, since we were there for more than four hours :/ Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat???

Every room is equipped with two cordless mics, controller to input your songs, and two tambourines that light up when you shake shake shake it! You can even enter the title, artist, or even lyrics to find the song you want. Or look for the button that says.. ""Hit List"" below the Tempo Button. Then you will find 200 of the most popular requested songs to sing. Play around with the buttons on the top row to get your perfect tone. I like to sing with more echo, less music, and hit the applause button after someone just finished singing their all. 

In the song book, if you're looking for new songs, start at the back of the book, look at the bottom left of each page. There you will find a small section of six new songs under Pop. It's so fun, so entertaining, so therapeutic, and always a great time here. The staff is friendly and helpful if you need assistance in working the controller. The sound system and colorful lights, which you can turn off or on makes you feel like you're in your own nightclub :) Love the hours of operation here.

You might conclude that the place was ""dead"" when you first step inside and only the loud blasting music is there to greet you.   In actuality, most of the private rooms that encircled the restaurant were filled with people singing their hearts out.  Rest assured, the soundproofed walls keep Simon Cowell from hearing you and storming into the establishment and shutting the business down. 

The song selection was fairly up to date.   An extensive selection of American, K-pop, and J-pop was at our disposal.   Song selection was easy.  Sort by artist, title, or popular hits.    Even Disney songs such as Moana's ""How far I'll go"" was available making this place a hit for the kids as well.  Two mics allow for perfect (or not so perfect) duets.   A useless score at the end validates just how ready you are to be America's next Idol.  

The food we ordered was pretty good but we paid full price during happy hour.  We had calamari, korean fried chicken (great), pork belly, pizzas, and more.   It would have been 5 stars if Q actually offered some kind of happy hour deal for the food as well.  

The staff was very quick with our orders and they deserve a pat on the back for how well they did their jobs.  Add this to the list of something you can do with a group of friends for a great night out.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,6,2,4,pHMlsMv-OcjBHclecQRtEw

2929336,2012-09-21,1,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"A noraebang in Las Vegas??? That's the last thing I expected to be doing during my 3 days here, but it ended up being one of the best parts of the trip. There's nothing like singing your heart out until 4 in the morning after a mundane night of clubbing on the strip.

Pros:

- They're open 24 hrs a day (I think?), so you're free to come sing at any random hour of the night

- The song selection is fantastic. K-Pop, J-Pop, Russian oldies, 90s rock, brand new Top 40 hits. They're got it all. The system they use is common to most Korean karaoke places, so it's fairly easy to use. 

- Drinks and food are plentiful. This seems to be a problem with most karaoke places in California. It's hard to find a place that serves alcohol and/or food, and impossible after 2am. Here, you can drink and eat as much as you want however long you want. Their soju and beer prices are very reasonable and even cheaper than most Korean bars. A couple bottles of Chum-Churum and Hite always results in a great time, especially when done in Seoul Train fashion. We ordered a plate of tteokbokki (rice cake) as well, and that was pretty delicious. It's the perfect snack to go with soju.

- If you come in a large group of 10+ people like we did, it's going to end up being really cheap.  For 3 hours of singing + drinks + food, it cost us no more than $10 each. It's hard to beat that kind of price. 

Con:

- We had to wait a bit for our room, but it's understandable considering how many of us there were. The wait wasn't too long, but some people began to fall asleep.

Overall, Karaoke Q is perfect if you're visiting and want to get away from the strip. Although we had a local ""friend"" who I'm not too fond of with us who decided to invite himself, it was still a great time all around. It's not Seoul, but it comes very close.",1yv6GXttiII_-od7HaUcfA,1,1,5,izhQPA0W_O3LaiwEKb1-Ag

They rent rooms by the hour, which makes me wonder what this place was originally built for, but we won't go there. They have a huge selection of songs, and a variety of different bites. 
I was there for a 12year old's birthday, so I did not get to experience some of the unique menu items like the Buldogi pizza, or spicy beef noodle soup. However, I have high hopes that they know what they're doing in the food dept. If not, get drunk and order fried foods!

I was in the medium sized room with 8 people including myself, and found it to be a nice fit with a little bit of extra space. The owners/staff are incredibly friendly and considerate. They gave us free fruit because we were there for New Year's Eve/New Year's.

The variety of Korean/Japanese songs is incredible. Although most of us had trouble singing the Korean songs, the American songs were fun to sing as well. Though they don't have a big selection of the more recent mainstream songs, Backstreet Boys never fails me. There are a few funny typos here and there, but it's nothing that we can't out sing.

There are only two mics, but what the heck, you only need two singers at a time since everyone's capable singing without the mic anyway. The sound system was great, it was seriously loud, maybe a little too loud in the room! I probably had a little hearing loss from that.

It was super hot in the room, but it was probably from everyone jumping and singing and getting too excited. I definitely had a good experience here.",U2f_VCU5GrfOZlZHsJjetg,2,1,5,Dabgk3hETurdBEYWwPn1qQ

I told him there is 2 that are which is me and my girl friend. Jacob said after 9 no persons under 21 are allow. Bit we never ha e that experience before. He just kept repeating it like it's our first time. We been here 5 times together and we lots of friends. So we left. We came back 2 hours later. My one friend was nervous about being call out again. But I told my friend to not worry hopefully we can try to get the room. As we walk, Jacob was out smoking and somewhat remembers me. I ask him if the rooms still unavailable, and he kept saying no one under 21 are allow and he pointed at my friend. He was so rude and got the balls enough to point at my friend when my friend wasn't close to the venue. Not even 5 ft. His customer service was awful he was so rude embarrass my friend she.

They then said it would only be 40 min which was fine. We finally got into our room and at this point we had 8 people with us. Started singing and having a good time, then 4 other people showed up which put us at 12 and I guess the room we were in was only a 10 person maximum so they said they would charge us the price of the large room since we were 2 people over, but didn't off to have us move to a larger room. We wanted to order some food and drinks, pressed the doorbell on the door and nobody came, finally after about 15 minutes they came in to take our order. When my brother and I went to order some food, we asked the guy taking our order if we can please have ours on a separate check so it wouldn't get confusing when we had to pay. He told us that they don't do that and we'd have to just tell them when we go to the front to pay which is ours, which was fine so I thought. When we were done we went up to the front to pay and as we were telling the guy at the register which was which and how to split it, he gave us such attitude saying 'when you guys have it all figured out, come back, you can wait over there, we have other people in line and you're holding it up.' Excuse me? We're paying customers with about a $300 bill. Whatever, we step aside and let the two girls go, which looked like he knew cause they were having a full on conversation. Once we finally get back up to the register after having to re wait in line he tells us with an attitude 'Next time you guys wanna split the check, tell us before.' We did. Your waiter told us you don't split the check and for us to tell you at the register. Plus, you would think with a large party they would ask if we would like it split. And to top the whole thing off. We go to pay for it with a credit card and he has the nerve to say 'I see you didn't leave a tip, it's not mandatory or anything but you know...' ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? You're insisting on a tip after you were just so rude to us? We spent $300 here tonight, and $280 the last time we were here. I don't believe I will be going back anytime soon.

I had booked a large VIP room for a friends' birthday a week or so before the event. The booking process over the phone was clear and easy. They confirmed our booking a few hours before the event by calling us.

When we arrived, we were given a pick of a room which suited our needs. We picked a regular room (had about 15 people off an on). Worked nicely. They serve wine, Sake and beer. There is also some finger foods available for order (I wouldn't bother). The rooms are nicely sound-proofed, the songs we wanted were all available, the technology was dependable and most importantly, the service was impeccable. 

The cost for a medium room on a Saturday night is around 35 dollars/hour which I thought was pretty reasonable for entertainment for so many people. Again, the service provided was top notch. 

The only reason this is not a 5 star is the music videos. Imagine singing ""It's Your Bday - 50cent"" and ""Brown Eyed Girl"" to a video of a bunch of Asian dudes/chicks dancing around in Ninja/Sci-fi outfits. Surreal.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,0,0,4,YjG2IJ_jWO6FpBPoSOUu9w

The room had a weird smell to it.  It was kind of dirty.  Though there are a variety of songs in different language to chose from, I could not find any songs that I want to sing (or try to sing).  There were three binders of music, and they were all different.  It would be more convenient if all the songs were in one binder, and there were three binders so that a big group can filter through. 

We all used our check in offer to get a bottle of H2O.  They also provided us with a bowl of veggie stix.  It was untouched.

3836590,2016-02-17,6,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"Got turned on to this place from a old coworker, so I've been here once before. It's a decent Karaoke spot with some good food, deals on drinks, and pricing for rooms. Although there was one big problem when I went there last time and here's the story.

Decided to check it out again with a few friends randomly one night after a drink at the bar. I gave them a call and they quoted $15 for an hour for a group of four which was $5 less than another Karaoke Bar I called, HORAY! Thus, we decided to give it a try. So we take a Uber from to bar to embark on a KARAOKE ADVENTURE! 

So we arrived and it waited outiside the main bar area until we were helped. Nice black and white decor with the little crystal like chandeliers hanging over the tables. Quite classy I must say! Although, it's kind of late to still have a Christmas Tree up, it's almost February. TAKE IT DOWN and put some hearts or something, I don't know!

Anyways, we get a room after 10 minutes or so of waiting. The room included sleek black couches which we're very comfortable, a table to have drinks and food on, disco lights to set the mood, 2 tambourines, 2 microphones, and complimentary chips (which was probably there to dry your throats to encourage you to drink, smart... VERY SMART!). We were ready to party! But but 1st let me check in on TRUSTY OL' YELP!

As I checked in YELP on my smartphone I've noticed they have a deal for FREE SHVD ICE (One per room). Sounds like SHAVED ICE, a delicious treat! So I ask the young gentleman DO I GET THIS FOR CHECKING IN?!?!?! He then tells me to mention his name, give them a review, and HE'LL GET EVERYONE A ROUND OF FREE DRINKS! Sounds like a great deal if I were cheap and can be bribed easily to give a good Yelp review, but hey, I'm not easily swayed. I'm already buzzing and I don't want spend this time writing fake review when I can go home and write A REAL REVIEW after I've enjoyed and experienced this place. 

So we sing horribly throughout the night and we get the Soju deal BUY TWO GET ONE FREE! The third bottle will definitely help drown out off key, off pitch, off everything singing so good deal!  By the third bottle it has been almost two hours and I noticed that they haven't really checked up on us. It would be nice to have them check at least once nearing the end of every hour to make sure everything is ok and if we want to continue with another one. But hey, I guess he already has the review in the bag?

Overall the Karaoke Bar was your standard affair. Could use less bribes and better service which is the main reason why it scored lower on THE JULS SCALE. I noticed I didn't even get the Shaved Ice in the end for checking in, oh well!",CSMPQpkIMUmj06_CfMXARw,5,2,1,JqvTtvqI0bDKKLuY6LoYlQ

I am also a karaoke superstar, so it makes sense.
The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the selection is random.. Like, they have The Doors but only 2 songs. 3 Shania Twain songs. Rarely any one hit wonders. And then really random songs by people like Glenn Campbell, but it's not his most famous song.
I am NOT a drinker. Like I don't drink. At all. Not for religious/political/personal reasons. It's just not my thing. But someone introduced me to Soju and they got the bomb flavors! Yogurt Soju is the best, and they do a by 2, get 1 free deal if you're into that.

ALSO.
Though pricey, this place has THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS.
I know that's a bold statement, but I truly feel this way. They are large, breaded, and flavorful. Sometimes I just go there just to get chicken wings (and you can also visit the stylish restaurant next door to get chicken wings and other food).

4287104,2011-03-19,0,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"So far, Q is the best private room karaoke I've found in Vegas. 

Much as I'd like to keep it my secret, Q is really awesome, so I must share. Plus, only reviewing the poor and mediocre businesses is a sure path to idiocracy. 

Q has such great deals, I don't know how they stay in business. Mon-Thur is half price off room rentals all day. We went on a Thursday and got a medium room (accommodates 6-10 ppl), regular $25/ hr - we got it for $13 an hour. There was also a buy two get one free drink special. We ordered six carafes of yogurt soju at $15 a piece and only paid for four. 

For three hours in a small room and six carafes of soju, we paid $92 before tip. After tip, it broke down to about $16 per person. What?! For three hours of karaoke?!

Down side to Q is that their English song selection isn't great, but is pretty standard for Las Vegas (I think all the Asian-owned karaoke joints get their karaoke systems from the same company). If anyone knows of better karaoke places, please message me. I'll do the recon and review. 

(Please note that I'm reviewing Q under the standards of private room karaoke, as opposed to bar karaoke. While I do love bar karaoke, it's a different animal all together.) 

But it looks like they're phasing in a new system. You have to pick either the new system OR the old, you can't have both. The new system looks like they might have a larger selection of English songs, but they're kind of old. If you want to jam down with some Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Maroon 5, go old system. If you want to sing some Pretenders, old Foo Fighters, go with the new. 

If you hang around long enough, the host will come in, drop a fruit plate, and say, ""On the house."" 

They're pretty strict about bringing in outside food or drink. They wouldn't let my friend bring in a boba drink, even though Q doesn't sell boba drinks.",bEVFXdlFYzZzXsYY1DmXQg,4,1,5,yC9_YOc4pAAGmC2ov5nb3g

The staff comes to you for all of your food and beverage needs. Our group stuck with sake and soju. The soju was a bit different than we've had before, but it was good and helped fill us all with the holiday cheer. 

The music selection was great. Lots of classics and tons of new stuff. Our night was filled with ballads, hip hop and classics and a Christmas tune or two. The projection screen was great, large enough for everyone to see, and the flat screen at the back of the room with lyrics was nice as I am short and couldn't see over some of the ""dancers"" we had in our party.

4335577,2016-11-27,2,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"Here is to my first karaoke night in Las Vegas. And to my third night in Las Vegas. 

That day, I had my morning meeting outside in the 110 degree heat (yes, I know) and I worked in the 110 degree heat (was that exciting or what?) After work, one of my coworkers (who was a Red Sox fan but on the flipside was a nice person) told me it was his birthday and invited us to celebrate with him. Having been out of practice in karaoke but wanting to improve, I said yes. 

We got one of the karaoke rooms. I had met many of my coworkers the day before and while they told me their roles, not one of them mentioned ""talented singer."" Many of them I learned were. My boss's boss did a fantastic rendition of ""A Lion Sleeps Tonight"" and another one (who I later learned had trained in opera) was singing classic motown and doing a wonderful job. 

I then sang some Shania Twain although I was unable to hit her notes but as good karaoke places will do (such as this one), they help you out a bit. 

But overall, it was a great way to open up to Vegas and spend time with my coworkers where I would not be complaining about the heat but instead complimenting them on their vocal talents.",PhvHR6Lb8g8jJM0_tlyeYw,3,3,4,hZa9BDPMbTpfJYGmGCzNeA

They have English song selections, and some of them are pretty recent. They also have Korean (obviously), Japanese, Tagalog, and Chinese songs. They offer alcoholic drinks and a snack menu. Most of the times each room comes with complimentary snacks, so that's nice. The only annoying thing is that we can't bring our own drinks. I would love to bring my own water since singing for two hours can really hurt my throat, but they would rather you buy their water that costs twice the price I bought my own.

This turned out to be a great idea and we had an awesome time. We'd called ahead of time to make reservations for 10 people and once we arrived were directed to a private room that seated all of us comfortably. The rooms were pretty big, the seats were comfortable and they had enough stage space for us to dance around while four of us sang N'Sync's Bye Bye Bye.They had a buy two buckets of beer and get one free special going on which we gladly took advantage of. The song selection is fairly modern. They have a lot of popular Taylor Swifts and classic R&B ballads that are fun to drunkenly belt out. At some point in the night we were provided with complimentary fries on the house and some veggie chips. One of my friends ordered a chicken soup of sorts and really liked it. I can't remember what type of beer we ordered but I remember it being good. With the half off price for karaoking, the beer and the food we ended up paying $10 each which wasn't bad at all. I've definitely paid a lot more at other places for less time spent karaoking. They were really nice about allowing us to split the bill and broke it up for each one of us so that we could pay separately. Keep in mind that if you write a review while you're karaoking they'll give you a complimentary shaved ice for your group. Everyone in our group was much to preoccupied with drinking and singing to take advantage of this offer but it's good to keep in mind.",sFlAo0LmAVtA-Vg12oxYBg,4,3,4,fohW7lNvPFsesMnTr9gCzA

Well, the prices are amazing, the song list is pretty darn updated, AND there are A LOT of songs to choose from! These are all private rooms so everyone can sing to their heart's content in the confinement of a room. 

In addition to that, Karaoke Q has a happy hour promo, where rooms are half off Sunday through Thursday from 6 to 9pm and BOGO free alcohol. The room prices are pretty good to begin with and just FYI they charge you by the hour.

They offer:
Small room - up to 6 people
Medium room - up to 12 people
Large room - up to 16 people
VIP room - 22 people

The rooms are a good size for the amount of people it offers. I believe the VIP rooms are the ones that require reservation whereas the rest is okay, but I recommend booking the VIP in advance as they only have one room. We had about 22 ish people for the VIP room, ordered a ton of alcohol and food, and the bill came out to be $13 per person including a generous tip.

Staff is extremely attentive when need be, and always good vibes. I've never felt like I overpaid for the amount of singing and drinking I've done at this place, so I guess that's what will keep me coming back. Sing on!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,27,19,5,euyRyJnJgdXTQP9gEYCtvw

I have been to several others in California, so for comparison sake, this place definitely ranks well alongside those. In comparison to other reviews on here, it looks like it's the best in Vegas.... so I guess if you're going to a place in Vegas.. come here.

You can text (702-830-2887) ahead to reserve a large room/VIP room which is really convenient if you have a large party and want guaranteed space. I make a large room reservation but was able to down grade to a medium (because they had one left) when we arrived.

I think we spent like 4 hours here and it was tons of fun. There were 14 of us in the group and a medium group is enough space as long as someone is standing/singing at any time. 

The Soju and Sake are dangerous and delicious. The food is pretty good too! They even gave us two free orders of fries.. probably because we went through 5 large carafes of soju and 5 small bottles of sake.

The facilities are very clean... it doesn't stink in there.. and they keep the microphones sanitized with a mic condom. 

Service is great-- prompt as soon as you press that silver button. 

The music selection can be better and more up to date. While you can search for artists easily they definitely were missing some key karaoke songs.

At the end of the night we spent about $300+ for all we did/ate/drank.

Some will end up on the streets wishing they hadn't taken those last few shots of Captain Morgan.  But if you're up for a late night adventure and you're with a crowd of locals and Asians, best believe that Karaoke Q is the place to be.

My friends and I will always end up finding our way back to Karaoke Q.  Not only is this place cheap, but you can find yourself in a large private room with two mics and a projector for you to sing the lyrics off of.

They have an awesome selection to choose from, and you are more than welcome to get your fix of Top 40 and K-Pop right here in Vegas.

On our last adventure, we had a group of 15 and needed a spot at 1AM.  While there weren't any rooms initially, they offered us a free 'upgrade' to the VIP room for the same price if we were able to wait it out.  We did, and we reaped the benefits.  We had so much space in the room we had our own little dance party in the front.

Cocktails and food here are affordable, and the service is quick.

A must-try: SEOUL TRAIN.  Gear up some shots of plain soju and half a glass of beer.  Line the shots on top domino style, and when you tip the first glass over, the rest will fall in a furious bliss to make an excellent drink.  Sober or not, this is a must!  (courtesy of Dmitriy S.)

So, true to form, mr friend from Las Vegas brought me here for some singing.  What a blast. It looks very obscure from the outside, just a couple of doors with a sign above it. When we got inside, we were led to our private room (one of the smaller ones, since there were only 3 people in our party).  We were then shown the huge song list, and were asked if we wanted songs other than English. YES! was our answer, and she came back with another song list filled with songs in other languages. She showed us how to operate the karaoke machine and mics, and handed us the menu. We were to push a buzzer on the wall when we're ready to order. We ordered bibimbaap (rice with stir-fried veggies and ground beef) and calamari, with 3 flavors of soju (pineapple, mango and yogurt). They gave us complimentary fries and popcorn, because you know, there's nothing like singing with a popcorn stuck in your throat. But I have to say, the food was delicious. We just couldn't eat that much, what with all the singing we had to do. After all, we rent this private room on an hourly rate, so we gotta do as much singing as we could! The song selection was a good mix between current hits and oldies-but-goodies. The acoustics was insane. We sounded quite good. And they had some kind of light show that synced with the music. It was awesome!  
After the initial shock, I found th place quite clean and the service superb. Whenever there's a lull in our room, we could hear other people rocking out in their private rooms. We could just imagine how we sounded to them! But that is the whole point about karaoke. It's not about how good you are, it's how much how much of a good time you wanna have.

They had pretty updated songs.. the books kind of took some getting used to because they were arranged by artists and not song titles but it's allll good! 
We also tried the spicy rice cake (ddukboki,) popcorn chicken & mini corndogs which were all delicious and perfect to munch on! 
The service was ON POINT and special thanks to the manager who was so so NICE ;]]]

This is such a great place to take karaoke beginners and veterans.  The private room makes everyone feel awesome and comfortable.  My wife has never sang anywhere besides this place.

The rooms are very spacious and pretty inexpensive, especially when you split the price amongst a big group of people.  They charge an hourly rate and always seem to have specials.  So much so that I wonder why they have a real priced menu at all.  I believe Fri-Sun is half priced rooms for a certain amount of time.  

Once you get to your room they really set you up.  There's a buzzer by the door for whenever you need food or drinks.  They have multiple books in each room for you and your friends to look at.  You choose your song, key it in, and start belting.  Two mics in each room for all the duets your significant other will want to do.

Still, we managed to squeeze in there and cozied ourselves up regardless.

I didn't like the fact that there were only 2 mics for 16-18 of us. I mean, seriously? The other thing was, the sound system was HORRIFIC. The sound was just terrible. I've been to many norebangs in California and I thought their sound system was poor, but this one just takes the cake.

The service was good though. They were super friendly and nice and accommodating towards us when we ordered bucket after bucket of beer.

The other problem with their system was that you couldn't pre-set the songs in so it would be quick and smooth sailing. After each song, it then allows you to punch in the songs. It just wasted a lot of valuable time and the remote control would often not work.

Even so, we had a good time, but I'm reviewing the norebang not how much fun I had. I think we would've had fun even if we had packed ourselves into someone's hotel room. As a norebang only the service and beers lived up to standard. The karaoke sound system seriously SUCKED BIG TIME!",nzsv-p1O8gCfP3XijfQrIw,5,2,2,hOkvLj2LUSoIB98K-my0CQ

Reason why I am rating it so high, is because I have been dragged out to many a karaoke bar, and this one was easily the best I've been to so far.

First off, it is clean.  Most of the time, these poorly lit up private rooms make me feel like something is going to crawl up my leg, or expect my pants to stick to the sofa when I stand up.  This place was actually pretty comfortable and seemed taken care of well by staff.

Speaking of staff, service here is fast.  Ring the doorbell, and we had someone in our room within a few seconds.  When we ordered drinks, they came quickly.  They were friendly, knew enough English to communicate LOL, and were efficient.

Speaking of drinks, the prices here are cheap!  Their house soju is BOGO, so at $15 for two large bottles, it is a great value.  It is also a little less sweet here, which is a good thing...probably a little heavier hand which is always nice!  All other drinks were buy two get one free...beers, etc...just no hard liquor except Soju.

5156397,2011-08-29,0,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"Ever since I've been back home, my coworkers and I have wanted to do a karaoke night. It has taken two and half months, but Karaoke Q has finally garnered our visit and affection!

Not only are their discounted rooms an amazing deal in itself (Mon-Thurs half off rooms, Friday & Saturday 20% off rooms), but they have pretty decent drink specials as well - buy two, get one free on all alcohol. Seriously, once you're in the room, all inhibitions are far gone. As an employee was explaining to system to us (pretty neat - huge remote for selecting songs, button on the wall for service), the Korean and Japanese song selection far out-number the English. However, we found plenty to sing from Britney Spears to The Cranberries to the Strokes - with me on the brink of singing out of my Bieber fever (quickly shot down, may I add, to my coworkers' violent protests). With projectors pumping out Korean videos to American songs, my heart was instantly smitten. What's not to love about K-Pop bands in the background while you sing your heart out to 'I Will Always Love You'? That's right, nothing!

The rooms are large, comfortably accommodating seven of us initially then ten. The service was very friendly and quick when requested. In total, our three hours in a medium room cost around 39 dollars. Adding in a few bottles of Blue Moon came out to be around 52 dollars. Enough justification to come back next week, in my opinion.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,1,0,5,eaJKQr9iRxxSewjMdnRn6g

Clearly, I am not a karaoke expert given my limited experience. Wait, I do have another vague memory of a smoky, little private karaoke room in the East Village in Manhattan...but, since I can't remember it doesn't count, so given my limited experience, I can't say I know the ins and outs of karaoke world, but this place is a good time. 

It is a private room karaoke establishment, so you only have to make a fool of yourself in front of your friends, and Sunday through Thursday they run a 50% off special on the rooms, which are charged by the hour. The establishment is clean with cheery attendants, and it was not the least bit smoky when I visited. A medium room easily holds 10 people, and it is $35 an hour (or $17.50 Sun-Thurs). Cheaper than a movie with oodles of opportunities for socializing. Plus, who needs a movie when you can see random Korean music videos synced with all of your favorite pop songs? 

Bonus star for having huge bottles of Hite. I think they are a liter. Don't ask me how much they cost. I missed that little detail. Although, I do know they were running a buy 2 get 1 free special. 

There are Chinese, Korean and English songs, but approximately 30% of the songs weren't working, which means I did not get a chance to sing ""Holding Out For A Hero."" I was bummed because ""Material Girl"" didn't carry quite the same gusto. However, I am happy I was able to sing ""Manic Monday."" If you don't know what to sing, I recommend this highly.

They were pretty busy for a week night probably because karaoke rooms are 25% off from Sunday to Thursday. We had a group of 8 so we got a medium room (fits up to 10 people).

Soju was buy 2, get 1 free! I must say their flavored soju were pretty strong compared to the ""B"" place on Spring Mountain. They don't serve hard liquor other than regular soju.  Service was great. We press the button to call for a server and he was there in a few seconds...every single time!  Like a karaoke genie (what?).

After a few shots of soju...holy Spice Girls (and Oasis...I like Brits apparently)! I sang a few songs but I ended up having such a great time. I was amongst good friends, I had no shame...especially in a private room. 

The rooms were well-insulated and people from other rooms couldn't hear us being loud and we couldn't hear them either.  They have newer songs on their list too but some people in the group wanted more of the old typical karaoke songs/singers/bands i.e. Journey...and I forgot what else.

Three hours, six buckets of beers, and two large servings of sake we come out to a bill of $135. I consider it an inexpensive night when divided up. It definitely helps to go in the middle of the week because of their discounts on rooms and alcohol. 

The only thing I would ask for next time is the all English book.

It's more of a 'Korean"" karaoke place meaning you and your party will have your own private room so you can get as stupid as you want. 

This is actually my second time here with several years in between but less than a $20 cab ride it's totally worth the fun! (Seriously, we had an experiment, we took 3 separate cabs the fare came out to $16, $25 and $20) We had a party of 11 and had a private room immediately. Prices are RIDICULOUSLY cheap for the fun, for 11 people including alcohol, water, tip and tax, it came out to less than $15 per person. We ordered 2 large mango sojus, 3 bottles of soju, 11 waters and just under 2 hours of karaoking our brains out. Also, kudos to them for selling their waters at only $1. In any other neighborhood in po-dunk Tacoma, WA to Ktown in LA I''ve never seen it below $3. 

The songs were pretty updated, selection extensive, their gear up to date with no malfunctions, service was attentive, I seriously have zero complaints of this place.

For this celebratory weekend, my bf and I went to sing our hearts out with some karakoke!  Maybe it's from being spoiled with the karoke places in Hawai'i, this karaoke joint was a very different experience.  The karaoke videos were all videos of korean pop singers and didn't always go with the lyrics of the music playing.  Some of the lyrics were a bit off too, but the whole fam and I had a bunch of fun despite the little things.  The only thing that made me a little bit self conscious was the door had windows where people can just look in and see you gettin' jiggy with it and belt it out.  And it wasn't just one window, it was a lot of clear windows!!

 ---Cue the shyness--- 

Ya that was me.  What was great was that there were two screens, a really large projector screen on one side and a smaller TV on the other.  The place also sells snacks and drinks for you too, if you get the munchies.   On a side note: it gets really cold in the rooms, so bring a jacket.  I was freezing in here!

5622456,2014-03-06,1,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"We're all aware of the glitz, sin, and overall tempestuous nature of the Strip in Las Vegas. There are so many shows to watch, restaurants to be gluttonous at, and tables for money to be lost. But ever find yourself leaving a concert, like Boyz II Men at The Mirage, and have that groove, Motown Philly feeling reverberating through your whole body and soul?! Where you can no longer simply walk down the neon filled streets without your feet needing to tap and the tremble of notes urging to be spilled from your throat? If that's the case, hop into your cab/car/bike/tut-tut and head over to Chinatown just 4 miles away from the Strip to Karaoke Q Studio.

Deco: 5 stars

This place is found in a shopping plaza 4 miles away (about a $20 cab ride at night from the Strip) and doesn't seem like much from the outside, but the moment you walk inside, your ears and eyes are infiltrated by as much bass and darkness as any nightclub on the Strip. Signs advertising specials such as 2 for 1 sake deals are lighting up on clear signs reflecting ever changing neon glows. The walls are tagged up with graffiti frescoes of famous artists such as Tupac & Biggie Smalls. The air is clean, the furniture is fresh, and the atmosphere is alive. These are all the elements that welcome the beat thumping in your chest, ready to explode.

Rooms: 5 stars

The room selections they have are small, medium, and large and they're all LIES! The rooms are much bigger than you would expect. Although it says 5 people for a small room, without a doubt you could fit an extra two for that intimate feel. The rooms are also lit with disco balls, laser lights, and a sound system with as much bass as the subwoffer in a low rider. They take great care in cleaning out the rooms after each use and with extra napkins, two mics, and a tambourine, you're ready to party!

Food: 5 stars

Honestly, the food should probably be getting 4 stars but with the convenience of a full kitchen connected to this karaoke, you have the best of both worlds in this karaoke bar. You can get drinks, you get delicious Korean bar food like Korean fried chicken, ome rice, and donkatsu and all without ever leaving your room. The food is flavorful, crisp, and delicious. At least the Korean fried chicken was. Get it!

Service: 4 stars

The service here was very good. Perhaps it helped being Korean or perhaps they're always this friendly, but even with a busy list of people coming in to sing their night out, the wait wasn't too bad and service told us he'd call us when a room opened. Having some time to kill, my party and I took a hop, skip, and a leap next door to the bistro and had some tasty treats before heading back. Answered any questions we had and very hospitable. Even called us a taxi at the end of the night.

Price: 5 stars

With Las Vegas just a few miles away, you would expect the pricing to be quite high, but with a small room starting off at simply $17 on a weekend and $15 during the week, you won't be breaking any banks, or breaking into any banks for that matter, to pay for your visit here. You can simply enjoy your time and go buck wild for hours and hours!

Conclusion

Most people will never talk about a must go place off the Strip but Karaoke Q Bistro is a MUST for anyone who loves music, singing, and having fun. Your party can dance, sing, feast, and still have money for the slots later on during your stay in Las Vegas. So, find a great group of friends, get yourselves pumped, and go crazy at Karaoke Q Bistro. It's one night you'll have no hangover regrets over.

Always great pricing for food and drinks, and the room! Their customer service is excellent - always someone coming in to check on you if you're doing ok with drinks and the music. The only thing that would like to mention is that their songs aren't as updated as the other new karaoke places, but the old songs are always great songs anyway. The sound systems are awesome and the lighting makes me feel like I'm at a club. I definitely will be coming back.",XSTrK_qYAMKcdgQj_-BZvA,0,0,4,sSBCEVYAMZv49UFkqDcMZw

My only complaint was that it was kind of hot in there but they had like three fans going. I think ended up being $50 per hour? They charged my friend $132 for 2 and half hours!! Maybe because we had the VIP room but yikes. The free shaved ice for checking in was much appreciated.,o7sVRYWSskPEv9veCYes-g,0,0,5,asH9fB2RTtPeFfPlUQmzPg

We don't really karaoke very often, and some of us, not at all, so it was overall a good experience. The food we ordered was good. We had cheese and pepperoni pizza, chicken poppers, french fries and mozzarella sticks.  All were pretty tasty. The reason I docked them one star is because I wasn't too thrilled with the song selection.  I felt like it was pretty small.  Most of the book is in other languages then English.  Also, the waitress who came to take order was pretty... not nice.  I don't know how else to put it.  She took are order without saying more then 2 words, no smile, she definitely seemed like she hated her job, or maybe she hated us.  I don't know how that's possible since we only saw her for a few seconds here and there.  But the gentleman

Place was clean and fresh, and the room we rented was really nice, with TV's on two walls and plenty of seating, so everyone could enjoy themselves. We had about 20 people in the room, so only a few had to stand. Huge selection of songs. We drank quite a few large flavored Sujo drinks, and several buckets of Sapporo beer. Not sure if they were on special as I wasn't in charge of the bill. 

It was a lot of fun, service was good. You push a button on the wall and they come take your order. Everyone sounds great, especially after a few drinks. 

I would highly recommend this place. Located on S. Jones in the same shopping center as District One, Chada Thai, Cafe Moda, etc. Parking sucks but very easy to just park across the street.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,5,3,4,40FEz78mpCMmXAtMx7cciA
5778575,2014-02-15,1,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"I've been here previously times and I'm not that big of a fan. I don't like karaoke for one thing, but that's besides the point.

The room we were in had really bad feedback on the mic. It kept interfering and causing that awful ""buzz"" noise. Plus the location of the machine was just above when you see what numbers you entered so you either have to have good eye sight OR you have to get up close to make sure you entered the right number.

The songs itself are pretty updated. You can even request for a Spanish book as well. They have a menu for ordering drinks and saw they had a promotion on their alcohol so follow up with that if you're interested. They don't allow outside foods or drinks.

If you check in through Yelp you will get a free sake bottle. Just show one of the workers and they will follow up with ID checking. The only problem with that coupon is it is misleading. It says PER PERSON not per party so after I redeemed mine I told my friend to do it as well. She had shown the worker and had already clicked on redeemed. The worker said they allow one per party because if everyone redeemed it we would have 20 free bottles of sake. He later added on that they were meaning to change that coupon, but will honor it for now since she already redeemed it.

All in all, this place isn't bad to go if you don't mind singing your hearts out while getting drunk.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,1,0,3,Fa93aLWGPlMxj04j37eL7g

5895153,2013-08-01,1,l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw,"We walked in ready to sing our hearts out, and we walked out four or five hours later with hoarse voices (singing our fair share of Linkin Park songs, can you understand why the hoarse voices, now), our bellies full of soju (deals!)and free bottled waters upon exiting (so nice of them). It was a goooood night.

This place, I felt, even outdid one of my favorite spots back at home (Hawaii) for karaoke and soju! Never thought I would ever say that! We didn't order too much food or pupus in comparison to the amount of soju we got. Buy two get one free, so it was guaranteed that we would get the largest pitcher of mixed soju. We chose lychee, strawberry and some other things I don't recall too well. Lychee was right on the money and I would call myself a true lychee connoisseur and strawberry was fresh strawberry tasting. 

We ended up waiting for a slight moment to get a room, and the staff was very apologetic for the very brief wait even though it was no problem at all. We ended up getting upgraded to the biggest room they got for the 5 of us, without having to pay since they were short rooms. We just had to pay the cost of a regular room. The place was spacious, clean, and no sticky tables. Once again, I cannot stress how nice and friendly they were. The overhead projectors made for a smart way for the lyrics and video to show, and the tv at the back at the room made it easy to have friends sing directly to you (think as if you are a real singer singing to the audience)... Our audience was 4 people, ha. 

The price was not bad. 140 something dollars with the food, 4 (+2 free) pitchers of mixed soju and the hours spent there exhausting all Linkin Park songs till we sang um all. I'd call that some deals.

I usually like the tempura kimbap and the bulgogi. They're the same menu as the Q Bistro next door. The cost of the rooms are not that bad especially if you split the costs with all your friends. It's comes out to like $8 per person if you just sing or at most $20 per person if you eat food and sing. They lost a star because I was a little turned off by the cashier saying that the person signing did not leave a tip. That's the first time I witnessed that.
