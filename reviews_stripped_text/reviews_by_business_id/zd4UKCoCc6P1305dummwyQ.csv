244881,2011-08-18,1,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"This was our second visit to the Indian Curry Bowl.  We ate there shortly after it opened, and decided then never to go back. It was very expensive, especially for the no-frills location and decor.  There was no-one in the place at 6PM except us, and they still got our order completely wrong.  

 But it's been awhile, and there is a sign that says Best of Las Vegas 2011 (is there a restaurant that isn't on the Best of Las Vegas list?), so we went in for the lunch buffet.  The troll that owns the place is almost enough to make you flee in fright, but we suffered through him anyway.  There were about 10 different things on the buffet table, two chicken dishes, meatballs and the rest vegetarian dishes.  Naan at the beginning of the table should have been enough to make us change our mind.  It was charred, flat and dry, but we took a piece anyway.  The chicken curry was okay, and the ""butter"" chicken, whatever that is, wasn't too bad either.  However, most of the rest of the dishes were less than good.   Naan, usually one of our guilty pleasures, was awful.

We have eaten in many, many Indian restaurants here and around the world and are very familiar with Indian food, bad and good.  Origin India in Las Vegas, in our opinion, is the very best in town, and India Oven is pretty good too.  

There were only two other tables of people in the restaurant while we were there, at the noon hour, and one of them was eating the food with gusto. I don't want to question their taste, because this place has been open for a couple of years, so there must be some people who like it.  However, we don't, and won't be going back.",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,2,1,1,0n8n5z-oTOM8B5pVuYUFzA

My husband and I went there tonight and really enjoyed it!  I think we enjoyed not having to drive all the way to Paradise to find Indian food.

The dishes were a touch expensive for the area, but the quality and location made up for paying a bit extra.  They are working on getting their liquor license, so our bill was cheaper than normal anyhow.  

I had Aloo Gobi and my husband had Chicken Korma.  Their vegetable samosas were very good, served with two dipping sauces.  You can pick the spiciness of your dish from one to ten.  I got a 5 and felt it was very mild and my husband got a 7 and said it felt more like a 2 - so go much spicier than you normally would.

The service was very polite and prompt - we will definitely go there again - from the look of the menu, we will have many other things to try.  Also, I will be trying their lunch special soon - much cheaper and many options there.",OTkY0fEJAjPQhsSQ5wi9uQ,1,0,4,XAbfDDwF2nJYWt8twCGUeA

412411,2011-03-08,3,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"We ordered lunch from Indian Curry Bowl yesterday, and I can't say enough about how HORRIBLE it was.  Not just the food, but the entire experience.  The food was very overpriced.  For 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 orders of Samosas, the total came to $72!!  I was shocked, and looked over the receipt.  They were charging me $10 for chutney??!?  I eat Indian food from many different establishments on a regular bases, and the chutney is ALWAYS complimentary.  It's like charging for ketchup.  

While I was waiting for my order, I was watching the elderly woman prepare the food using...... a microwave.  Really?  No burners or stoves going, just a couple of microwaves.  The food was not good at all.  The Samosas were soggy and undercooked, the Chicken Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer were runny and looked like they literally had been mixed with water.  

So basically, I paid over $70 for food that was microwaved (seriously, I'm still appalled by that one) and terrible.  Never again!!!!",6c2kKq1aHejlOt2kNoCOxw,8,0,1,TLDepOroWFv0IdceiaPAPg

538979,2010-09-12,0,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"My fiance and I had a craving for good Indian food. We usually would go to India Oven but decided to pick a local place closer to our house. Indian Curry Bowl is in the Northwest part of town in a very quiet shopping center. 
Considering it's location the prices were rather steep. (14.95 for most lunch entrees) 

They do however, have a lunch special. Curry bowls starting around 5 dollars and then 2 dollars extra for anything you'd like to add. (ie: vegetables, Korma sauce, CHICKEN, etc.) 
The husband, who I think is the owner, was somewhat friendly, a little odd and certainly pushy. We placed our order and he told me to try something else instead. We both decided on Chicken  Curry Bowls for lunch and he convinced me to try the Korma Sauce. When asked how spicy we'd like our lunch, I ordered a 4 and my fiance ordered a 6. 

Then, we ordered Naan. ""Plain naan?"".. YES, plain naan. 

We get our bowls. Small, but looked appealing. We taste them. Bland and the same level of spiciness for both... non existent. There was no spice in either bowl. 

The lady at a table near us ordered a ten and asked for more spice because it wasn't spicy at all. I think she had to ask for more spice 3 times. 

Later, our naan came. Garlic naan. Oops. He must've decided on that for us as well as that Korma Sauce. 

Although, it wasn't spicy and wasn't the best Indian Food, we didn't think it was awful. We ate it. 

We got our 20 dollar bill and gave him 30 dollars to get some change. He smiled and said, ""Thank you!"" before we had to ask for change. 
He looked puzzled but brought us change. 

Overall, not awful. It was worth a shot but we aren't going back. Service was mediocre and the food wasn't up to par. 

I'd rather drive several miles to get to a great Indian Restaurant in Vegas.",kzJjG4SJ-2zdG6HTyY68sQ,0,0,2,Lsg2iraPsMBBac57ytx19g
591977,2010-07-01,1,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,The food here is pretty bland and the menu is very limited. I find it to be overpriced and over hyped. The owners used to own the Samosa Factory and I ate there when they were still the owners and it was great. Then they sold it and opened up Indian Curry Bowl right by my house and I was excited. But when I tried the food I was more than disappointed. The samosas were bland and the korma was watered down tasting. The owner isnt always the nicest guy either. Forget about special ordering anything. If you are looking for good indian food i would go to the little place on Sahara and Decatur that they used to own.,DJuCp6NVHAmfolqDAsSQpQ,3,1,1,3Nl1Krr_PcPyRrl5WdP5JQ
610686,2010-01-05,1,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"So, yeah.  I was really excited about this restaurant after reading the reviews here and have to agree the food is PHENOMENAL!  I had a wonderful butter chicken, I haven't had indian food that good since returning to the states.  Very nicely seasoned, naan wasn't greasy and the portion was more than enough for lunch the next day (with a second order of naan).

I can't in good conscience give this place higher than 3 stars, however, because the wait staff was absolutely atrocious.  

I went there with my husband and our friend and we were happy to see that we had the place mainly to ourselves.   We love indian food and had reviewed the menu online before we came.  We told our waitress we were ready to order.  I went first and ordered the butter chicken, level 5 spicy.  She stared at me for a second as if I wasn't speaking English.  After repeating myself a couple of times, she actually took the menu and stared at it like she'd never seen it before.  Very strange.  She mumbled something about her husband (huh?), finally got it straight and then shuffled over to the kitchen.  

She brought over our appetizers, but couldn't remember who had what.  The same happened with our entrees - there are only three of us in the restaurant.  You really couldn't get that right??

But the most egregious was during the meal.  A good waiter/waitress knows how to interject to see if you need something.  The two girls in the restaurant had this really strange habit of hanging out near the table until all three of us stopped talking to look in their direction because of the creepy staring.  Then, instead of I don't know, asking if we needed more water?  They would comment on our conversation.  We tried to be polite about it, but after the third or fourth time, we started making things up for them to get (more water, tea, soda, napkins) just so we could continue our conversation.  Not that that helped much. 

It was such a relief when other patrons came in and they were too busy to hover.  

The food is good enough that I will do take out orders, but I most certainly won't be eating in again.  Creepy.",G86P-cSNWblLZRTxoSJoqQ,2,0,3,meUZLXQX8sZq3bccWMqDwQ
635414,2011-07-28,2,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"Cute restaurant, food mediocre and not authentic.

I guess this place caters to gringo palates. We ordered samosas which were pretty good. the naan was a bit lacking in flavor. Myself and a companion who were familiar with Indian cuisine ordered the matar paneer and vegetable kofta. Food wasn't bad, but lacking in spice and deep traditional indian flavor. This was disappointing as we had specifically requested that our food be very spicy. The rest of our party ordered lamb korma and chicken tikka masala and were generally pleased as they liked their food on the milder side.

The owner (who acted as our waiter) was stingy with the rice. He brought us one bowl for five people and gaped at us when we asked for more, mid dinner service. Not that we were being greedy, but this was like the size of a cereal bowl. (when most indian restaurants will give you a serving bowl) He then proceeded to bring us  half a cereal bowl full of rice then said, ""ok guys this is all we have."" --REALLY.

He then paced around the restaurant then glared at us until we left.
I understand that we came about an hour before closing, which can be annoying for most restaurant staff, but there were also two other couples dining. Way to get your message across. I get it, you want us to get the f*ck out. Noted.

So we quickly finished and left. Needless to say I will not be returning. I've had better Indian Food in the backwoods of North Carolina. 

Service  was fast, food is ok in a pinch if you're desperate. But for me, Indian Curry Bowl is to Indian food as Taco Bell is to Mexican food.",Owq90C9CVGWN-lNcCfTo-w,1,0,2,9avBIGF4YUespKp_r2htyw

1088390,2011-07-12,0,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"I was craving indian food one evening and my favorite indian restaurant in North Las vegas, Saffron, is still temporarily closed.  I was really heading to Fresh and Easy to pick up a few items when I spotted Indian Curry Bowl.  I had been curious about this place for a while and looked up reviews on Yelp.  I remembered the microwave issues yet my man thought that having a large table inside was a good sign.  I thought that having only 1 table at 6pm on a Saturday was a bad sign.

To make a long story short, we ordered vegetable samosa, lamb samosa, salty lassi, chai, garlic naan and sweet and sour curry.  (By the way, they no longer serve curry bowls.) Right after we ordered I heard a microwave go on. That's okay probably for my water for my chai. The microwave went on 3 times.  Now please understand that the kitchen is in the open.  If they did cook anything fresh one would hear so.  Nobody cooked anything fresh.  The microwave did all the cooking.  The salty lassi was the only item made fresh. My chai had a tea bag. The chicken in our curry was tandoori chicken cut up in chunks, strange.  The samosas lacked flavor and were dry.  The chutneys were okay. Again, they used a microwave to cook.

As for the bill, well we were charged for the garlic naan that never made it to our table.  At the time we ordered, we were the only table being served.  By the time we got the bill we were 1 of 2 tables (total of 4 people).  My man called him over and said we never got our naan.  He looked around on our table to be sure because he didn't remember if he had made naan. Really?

I'd only go when I'd have the urging for curry and bc it is in my neighborhood, but I'd spend an easy $20 even just for my small lunch and always thought it was overpriced.   

I was so pleased to see their lunch buffet for 9.95 during the week, 12.95 on weekends.  I've been twice now and each time I had a little bit of every item, which were all nicely flavored.  Both times, finished everything on my plate and was super happy. So spending a $20 for weekend buffet, drink and tip was worth to me bc I got to try everything instead of just one item for the same price.   

Service and ambiance there has always been a little lack luster, but they must be reading their reviews bc the old man was no where to be found and the wife was super welcoming and friendly, and they had an attentive bus boy to help out.  I think they need some nice Indian music playing to kill the monotony.   But  I'm glad they are still open and in the neighborhood!

2223010,2011-03-19,5,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"There are Indian restaurants I simply don't visit twice: maybe they're not quite my style or the service was too poor to ignore. And then there is Indian Curry Bowl, an Indian restaurant so bad that I turn into Neil deGrasse Tyson. (""This makes me want to grab people on the street and yell, 'Have you heard this?!'"")

In fact, ICB was such a disappointing experience that I'm bopping out of my ""no time to Yelp"" mode to warn the public. As the LOLcats say, ""DO NOT WANT.""

We ended up here after driving to another restaurant only to find it temporarily closed. You may think my mouth was set for a certain place, and that maybe I went to Indian Curry Bowl with unreasonable standards, but I swear my expectations were low. I have my fave places, sure, but I'm happy to add more to that list any time. I also don't seek out the same experience every place I go - variety is welcome.

We started with the vegetable samosas and they were much the same as what ICB supplies to Whole Foods. Not particularly layered in aromas or flavours, but okay. The tamarind chutney was a little different, chunkier than you usually see, and nice. The ""green"" chutney (I call it that because I couldn't tell if it wanted to be cilantro or mint) was fine. I wasn't purring as I ate, but it was all fine.

The fresh lemonades were excellent. We could hear our waitress spending several minutes using the blender, and the result was a chunk of creamy ice crystals surrounded by sweet tartness. The lemonades were worth me updating my Facebook status on the spot.

Now the downhill slide. And by ""slide"" I mean ""luge."" I ignored the beeping of the microwave - after all, that wasn't necessarily a bad thing (and may not even involve my food), but when - midway through my samosa - the waitress set down my paneer tikka masala, the ""uh oh"" flash came. ""Uh oh, I didn't order soup.""

I had plenty of time to try to mentally reverse my reaction while we waited (amid more beeps from the kitchen) for Mike's chicken tikka masala to arrive. So my dish looks like soup. I like soup! In fact, I almost ordered soup! So it's a little different. Different is interesting! A nicely spiced soup-sauce with paneer-cubes bobbing in it. What's not to enjoy? I took a slurp.

Pause. Slurp. Pause. Finally, I nailed the flavor: wet air. ""Wait, is this even paneer, or is it tofu?"" (I asked my husband.) It was so bland that I honestly wasn't sure. Where were the flavours? I'm not talking about the heat - I enjoy both spicy and mild dishes so heat's a non-issue- I mean the taste. The watery ""sauce"" just slid right off the paneer. Let me give you the copycat recipe right now: combine one can of tomato soup with seven cans of water. Season as if you're a heart-smart 85-year-old nun who thinks grinding your own pepper is playing it exotic. Garnish with a whacked-up piece of string cheese. Heat in the microwave and serve.

The plain naan was a little chewy, on par with the grocery store's frozen section. My husband found his garlic naan tasteless, but he's already discussed it in his review (along with his chicken tikka masala). The rice did smell like Basmati if you got it right up in your nostril, but it was... say it with me... tasteless. (If this were a drinking game, I'd have to make up the sofa for you.) Dumping the rice into the soup (it's misleading to call it anything else) didn't improve either element. Nor did adding the salt and pepper provided on each table (something one doesn't usually see in an Indian restaurant).

Maybe the watered-down blandness comes from ICB's ""healthy"" angle, but Mantra Masala also promotes healthy cuisine, and they don't wave a soup-wand over their dishes. (Don't take this as an endorsement for MM, though - they've moved to my naughty list, another story.) 

With a bill over $50 (with tip), the extra star I might've added for the delicious lemonade + nice service + general kindness (because, after all, maybe there's a whole soup-style curry subculture out there that I just don't get) disappeared. My dish should have been six bucks, not thirteen. Maybe eight if the atmosphere was more ""restaurant-y."" (Until I saw the help-yourself basket of menus by the door, I was sure ICB was counter-service.)

I was so disappointed, it still astounds me to this day. Me and my boyfriend tried out their lunch specials, I ordered a chicken curry bowl and he ordered a shrimp curry bowl. Our server (which seemed to be the owner) asked us how spicy we wanted it, so we told him medium. Then he proceeded to mumble something about baby food. 

When we got our food it was utterly horrible. It was a watery bowl of rice and chicken, with NO FLAVOR whatsoever. My boyfriends lunch was the same, except his shrimp was still grey. The owner and other workers seemed to be looking something up on their computer, but when they finally got around to checking on us (because I believe I was loudly conversing with my boyfriend about my disdain for our lunch) we asked him to cook the shrimp longer, and told him there was not much flavor. He went on to blame us for the flavoring, saying that we wanted it not spicy, but that he could bring us flavoring on the side, and that we were that ones that wanted BABY FOOD. He also informed us that we did not order the right thing, and that if we had asked him he would have told us what was good. Let me ask you dear sir, why is it even on your menu if you know it sucks? Adding the curry paste improved it slightly, but don't get me wrong it was still gross.

When we checked out we had to find him to get our check. He informed us that we didn't like the food, and it was because it was food we were not use to.

I am truly in awe about how much she knows about food allergies...and the lengths at which she goes to ensure that anyone who eats in her restaurant has a good experience...no matter what allergy they may have.

She also cooks with pure, organic vegetables and spices and will custom -make orders to suit your taste.

The Korma we ordered mild spice, it was a little watery and since we went 2 months ago, the portion size had diminished.  The Chicken Tikka my hubby ordered #10 super-hot, it was not, but had some heat to it.  The samosas were tasty, but a bit greasy and the Naan was a hit with my 1 and 3 year olds.  Overall, definitely going back, the food comes out PIPING HOT and freshly made, which I love, and all of the flavors are there that I look for in Indian food.  This is a nice little family-owned restaurant with polite and prompt service, but relaxed enough to seat yourself.  I love it and I try to go every few months.",dDJwoJ09TTbF5A_EbmLH7g,1,1,4,fsuEs4u3sGFxhxY_MLfAOg

The name is Indian Curry Bowl - and a curry bowl costs $8 which is reasonable - but is only available from 11-2 pm 6 days a week.  After that it's called an ""entree"" where you pay $16 for the same quality and quantity of an $8 curry bowl.  It cost me $80 to feed myself, wife, and two kids.

3248175,2011-03-19,1,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"The wife and I ended up here today after discovering that Saffron - Flavors of India has temporarily closed.

I'm sad to report that this place is easily the worst a la carte Indian experience I have had in Las Vegas.

My wife ordered Paneer Tikka Masala and I ordered my standard Chicken Tikka Masala. We also had our standard mix of garlic and plain naan which we love to use the mop up all the lovely rich creamy gravy that you usually associate with Indian food and these dishes in particular.

What arrived was not rich, creamy or even remotely lovely. They seem to take the ""healthy take on Indian food"" to extremes here. My tikka masala looked like it had been prepared by throwing a few pieces of chicken tikka into a mixture of blended onion, tomato, green peppers, and cilantro which had then been cut with about a cup of water until watery and tasteless. We heard the microwave going during the preparation, so I'd say that's pretty much exactly what was happening.

Imagine what you'd get if you microwaved a can of (if it existed) ""Progresso low fat, low sodium Indian curry chicken soup"". There's something extremely wrong with your Chicken Tikka Masala when no matter how many times you re-dip your chicken in the ""sauce"" it comes up completely devoid of anything covering it. The chicken itself was bland, waterlogged and soaked free of any flavour whatsoever.

We didn't really have much use for our naan since there was no real gravy here, but my garlic naan was pretty tasteless.

The only minor saving grace of the meal was the excellent home made lemonade and the passable samosas we began our meal with. 

To round things all off, a bill of close to $50 for a terrible meal in a restaurant that felt like a Subway landed on the table and I knew the second star I was going to award this place just for the lemonade and friendly service was gone.  

If you're a health fanatic who likes vaguely chili flavoured water with your chicken, paneer etc, then this place might be for you. If your looking for wonderful silky sauces and creamy, nutty tastes, run as far from Indian Curry Bowl as you can.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,4,1,1,m9AvXndAItx9NMmKFz_UHA

4187284,2009-07-14,0,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,I love Indian Curry Bowl! Every time I head to Las Vegas I have to make a trip there. The food is simply amazing. The butter chicken is awesome and the Daal Makhani is awesome (ask for it extra spicy). Id also like to say that their stuffed Naan bread is hands down the best tasting Naan ive ever had (that says alot because I have quite a few Indian friends). Ive read of other people complaning about the prices and I have to disagree the prices are reasonable especially considering that the quality of the food is top notch. The only thing I'd have to complain about is that they dont have a beer or wine license. I'd love to have a good beer or nice bottle of wine with their food.

4620263,2010-07-26,2,zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ,"This place is decent. My friend and I were looking for a late lunch after a hike at Mt Charleston. I always want to try somewhere I've never been (so I can Yelp it of course). I won't pretend that I know what authentic Indian food tastes like. The bottom line for me is whether or not I enjoyed it. I honestly couldn't care less about authentic.

I ordered a Lamb Curry Bowl lunch special, along with some Roti and a Mango Lassi. Everything was good. Maybe I'm just too Americanized, but the portion was pretty tiny! It costs $4.95 for a curry bowl and then you add $2 for the lamb (or chicken or shrimp). That's $6.95 for a tiny bowl of curry. Fortunately, the roti and the lassi rounded out my meal and managed to fill me up.

Like I said, the food is indeed good. It just seems overpriced. You're paying in the mid teens for a regular entrée. Maybe the decor threw me off. The location and appearance suggest a cheaper price point. Next time, I'll take my Indian friend's advice and check out India Palace.

The vindaloo was supposed to be level 8 of 10 for heat, it was so bland I would say it was actually level 0.  The naan was very dry and did not even hold together, it was like bread particle board.  
  Not a good meal, but it wasn't over.  8 hrs later I began to have the most violent episode of food poisoning I have experienced in 45 years.  12 hours of projectile fluids coming out both ends.  I am lucky I was the only one in my family eating the Curry Bowl fare.  I will never go near the place again.

It's been dormant for about 2 years now ever since I left San Francisco where you can find a Naan N Curry on almost every street corner.  In Vegas we are in the land of plenty but not plenty of curry--Indian OR Japanese (still looking for the Japanese so if anyone has any suggestions message me!)

Trek all the way to the Strip for good Indian food?  Me thinks not!  Even if it is only 12 miles away.  I like things to be within a 5 mile radius...isn't life just more convenient that way??

After visiting the new Fresh & Easy off of Anne Rd. we notice a wittttle bitty  sign that says ""Indian Curry Bowl"" What? Could it be? Noooo...is that what I think it says?? 

""Food for a Healthy Body and Soul""--- I am HUGE on freshness and this place has precisely all the freshness your lips will touch.  I won't talk about the delicious food because you can read that from the other great reviews. I will make one important note about their food though-- everything is organic. They make their yogurt and spices from scratch! 

Lunch is in the $5-$10 range and dinner will be in the $12-$15 range.

So, I want to talk about how great you will feel coming out of there.  You're greeted by warmth, care, and sweet personality. The owner Amand and his lovely partner, fellow chef and owner Rita, make you feel like you are an honored guest in their own home.  Amand ""Andy"" greets you with a warm smile and makes sure that you are enjoying yourselves and your stay there. He's so very sweet.

Indian Curry Bowl, you've made a  HUGE fan out of us.  (I was also instantly drawn to them softly playing the wonderful sounds of Thievery Corporation---they're hip too?? Very cool!)

#1 - My old roomie said it was her favorite Indian food in town. It must have been the only place she's ever tried. Horrible service, very bland food. 

#2 - I was craving Indian for lunch, and this was the only place in the Northwest at the time. I ordered take out, took longer than I was told, charged me for the extra rice and naan I ordered, but failed to give it to me. Again, the food was very bland and watery. 

#3 - They had just advertised a new buffet for lunch. My boyfriend and I had both agreed this place was not very good, but we decided to give it one more try for the buffet. Horrible service, and very distasteful food. They didn't direct us to anything, just expected us to know how it worked didn't ask us if we needed anything. There was hardly any food to chose from and what there was available was cold and hardly any left.

The Chicken Korma with rice was absolutely amazing. The creaminess of the coconut milk and spiciness of the sauce made for a perfect combination of flavors! 

The garlic naan was light, fresh and equally flavorful. Warning: If you get this takeout, your car will smell like garlic for days! 

The curry chicken bowl lunch special (extra spicy) was tasty and full of spices. It was the perfect portion for lunch! 

I have only ordered take out on the 2 visits I have made. The place seems to be really slow, so I hope it picks up soon! I know I will be going back soon! I've heard that the samosas are the best!",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,9,7,4,0R40ysDr-SK-orrb4xWoRQ

They had about 10 menu items - I tried; meatballs, chicken curry, butter chicken, rice, okra, and some garbanzo bean thing.  The only item I didn't like too much was the butter chicken, the chicken was dry.  The meatballs had a healthy dose of cumin which was a little strong for my taste.  The chicken curry was tasty.  My favorite menu item was the okra dish.  

The place is nice inside.  I am guessing the fella working there is the owner.  Not exactly mister personality, but I had the buffet so he didn't have to do much.
