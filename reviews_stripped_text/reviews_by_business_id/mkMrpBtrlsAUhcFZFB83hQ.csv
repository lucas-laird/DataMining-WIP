Amazing food, great prices and huge portions, please don't let the location of this place make you not want to go, I know the ElCo (Cortez) is a really sucky place, but Roberta's is sooo worth it, the place is small but comfy and kinda romantic, the service was excellent to.",1dwa6Wkp0chKBcrRuO05lA,0,0,5,QSp28LYbJuNMIWE2LZDIDw

What it lacks in ambiance is made up by a friendly staff and moderate pricing.  Ms. Westie's 8 ounce filet, served medium rare as requested, was very good though decidedly short of prime.  My Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked - crusty on the outside and moist inside, and accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes, a small fennel salad and sauted spinach.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,1,0,4,1SbYTppUrquUpGOtODsVgg
