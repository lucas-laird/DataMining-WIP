Lupita is the person who helped me from start to finish and was friendly and professional, good service, good food you can't beat it!",ks1mktI5fNyc0gpINDqFeA,0,1,5,TFJKNP-7dSCgG49kahkaRQ
555119,2017-03-05,0,NM9A38hqiOAYbnUPpNz-UQ,"Favorite place to get Chinese style food. The portions aren't as large as other more authentic Chinese style restaurants but the food is always good. Love the honey walnut shrimp, black pepper chicken, orange chicken! But everything is always good. The chow mein is always the side i choose instead of fried rice. Only wish there was more chow mein noodles and less cabbage and onions.",T85PiMdzKMXGu7McR2WzzQ,0,0,5,KrLk4Gtb4-4AQAoTvhyAsg

Now a days all restaurants always do this. Is not the customer job to remind them of the things that need to be in the bag. Fast food places keep the same prices all year round...always the same bad quality services as well.

Thank you Panda Express.",pqR_luKPyFYYXEYccsu8dg,0,0,2,C5qDuQLHgG9cfybRzL-O4g

San Bernardino. The food was super sweet, portions were skimpy and prices were high. So I've never been a fan of the food but It was actually tasty today. 
Portions are skimpy and prices are high for what you get but you do get full. Service was ok. I most likely will return in the future.",0De5alHpWvnRo_lI5qRE-g,0,0,3,WzNF__AXbE0yr41jYwptsw

I was sure to be very clear and legible while ordering (in hopes this doesn't happen) however they didn't even give me and my family the correct food.
