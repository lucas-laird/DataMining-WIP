However, I went to the restaurant to order and received horrible service from the Manager named Oscar. I went in to order and I was told by the Hostess that my food would be ready in 20-25 minutes. So I went to run a quick errand and when I returned at the 20 minute mark I was greeted by Oscar (the grouch). When I approached the counter he stated that my food wasn't ready and it would be another 20 minutes. When Oscar spoke to me it was extremely condescending, rude and disrespectful. He spoke to me as if I was beneath him. Since I had already waited 20 minutes I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes so I asked for a refund. He kept going on and on and trying to avoid the refund. He left mid sentence as I asked him again for a refund and came back and said my food would be ready in 5 minutes. I declined and asked for a refund again and this time for his bosses name. Turns out he is the manager and said the Owners didn't want to spend their time talking to the customers. (What???does he not know customers pay their wages) Oscar continued to pick an argument and really avoided trying to give me a refund. Finally I did get a refund, and he continued to speak rudely to me as I walked out.

I immediately called the restaurant as soon as I saw what was delivered. I was then told by the woman on the phone what I liked on my salad and that it was what I ordered. I had to stop her and inform her you cannot tell me what I like. I was then told by her her manager would call me back. He obviously had no customer service skills either. His solution was we will give you a $4 credit and go ahead and eat what you ordered because it's okay you can eat it. Again how do you tell a customer what they like to eat. I could be allergic to a ranch ingredient. This entire ordering experience was horrible not to mention it taking over an hour to get one pizza, salad, & $4 worth of the wrong dressing.

Every time we have ordered , the food has been so great and the orders have been so accurate. This is a huge deal as most places always get at least one thing wrong.

I will say my only thing is they are stingy with the ranch. Even with an order of 20 wings one one sharable ranch. (There large size but not very large)

Also they forgot to mention that they charge 5.50$ to deliver, if I knew that I wouldn't of tipped the driver and I would of just simply picked it up.  I called back and asked why she didn't tell me that it's a 5.50 delivery charge, and she said ""we're not required to tell you that information"" in an extremely rude tone. Excuse me? Are you freaking kidding me? And why did your delivery guy think it's a good idea to put pizza and salad on top of each other together?

Very nice casual decor, comfy booths, nice large Samsung television to watch while you wait for your order. Spotless tables and floors, clean as  a whistle.

I came in today at Friday August 26th at about 4 PM.  My boyfriend and I had a flyer at the house for this place and he said he was craving a Philly Cheesesteak.  I remembered about the flyer and said they had Phillies right around the corner from the house.

Our waiter was a splendid guy to meet.  Very knowledgeable of the menu and suggested to try their Philly with cheese wiz.  We wanted to stay with an appetizer which we tried the loaded potato skins, Mm mm!

When the Philly was up it was succulent lyrics juicy!  It was perfectly cooked to  a nice light crunchy bun.  You can tell whomever was cooking paid close attention to the food and appearance. Some folks can easily overcook the thinly sliced meat. Which that was not the case.  We loved their crispy curl fries too. Very reasonably priced for the portions.

The food took about 45 minutes to arrive but the driver was super nice. Here is the scoop on the food:
Breaded mushrooms are awesome and come with ranch for dipping...only complaint is that there are not enough for the price.
Pickle fries are a spicy treat that you must try.
Philly cheese steak was good but meat seemed   a little thin compared to the roll. You really do not taste the peppers or cheese.
Burgers are awesome and huge with good amount of fries.
The beef shishkabob plate was a good size but overcooked.

My favorite item this far is the chicken fingers with garlic parmesan sauce. Holy cow! It is a creamy sauce they pour over the chicken fingers. It is unique and extremely tasty. 

Their onion rings, for whatever reason, are very very good. Beer battered and with lots of flavor. 

I've also ordered pizza from here and was very happy with it. They go heavy on the toppings! You definitely feel like you get your money's worth. I've also ordered they're appetizer sampler platter. They have fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks and onion rings. It comes with really flavorful marinara sauce and ranch.

On Yelp I checked in to receive a free piece of cheesecake. After talking two her twice about it they still forgot the free cheesecake. 

This is after listening to these two employees arguing over what they should be charging customers. 
 
Once home I was excited to eat my meatball parmesan sub. I was quickly disappointed that the meatballs tasted like a rubber ball. I'm thinking they've been sitting in the back for awhile. 

My wife did say her pizza was ok once she was able to use paper towels to get all the grease off.

Called to place order over the phone. I asked for hummus with veggies and the guy said ""yes we have the hummus platter, hummus with veggies"". I asked what veggies it came with and he listed off a handful of veggies so I said ok cool I'll take that. 

When I got home and opened my platter I was surprised to see a heap of cooked vegetables with some type of grain mixed in. 

Ok so maybe there was a lack of understanding, slightlyyyyy understandable, but honestly the taste of the veggies was extremely poor. The jumble of oily veggies all had a soggy and uniform taste. The ""broccoli"" was the stem pieces only, and the salt level was about the same as you could imagine a jar of olives. I ended up eating my pita dipped in the hummus. 

The Tzatziki kind of tasted like it was mixed with blue cheese... 
 
We also ordered the wings and fries which my friend said tasted good! Everything including my veggies were nice and hot which I appreciate. They seem to have a mixed menu of Mediterranean and bar food.",moPeVo2BVmpUC9HqTiR5_A,0,0,2,YaLIiDwhxKihTmNtsEvWWg

They have every kind of food: Italian, Mexican, American, and Greek. To me, this usually means that they have a wide variety of mediocre food. When a restaurant tries too hard to be good at too many things, usually it turns out bad. In the case of tasty girl, it seems like they have it down. Although we stuck the the American side of things, the food was good! Can't speak for the other types of food but we got the wings, mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks, wings, and mac and cheese bites and it was all very tasty. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out more items on the menu in the future. For the food aspect, I would say it's pretty good. As for the service, it was mediocre and the reason for the missing star. My boyfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant at the time and there was only one employee working the front. Every time we needed something we had to get up and get it (never got our drinks and had to ask for them, refills, to go boxes, condiments, etc.).

They have Philly's with actual cheese wiz! My kids loved it along with the fat cheesy mozzarella sticks! The zucchini sticks were cut perfectly, not too thick but not too skinny either! I had the chicken gyro which was good and will suffice when I can't get across town to Acropolis. I think next time I will try the Lamb gyro (which they don't at Acropolis). 

The restaurant was nice and quiet so the kids and I were able to enjoy our lunch and quantity time together.

The pizza was essentially like most other Vegas pizza joints, but I did really enjoy their sauce. The crust was evenly cooked and pepperonis were spread out nicely, not overloaded. Can't say I had any complaints. The mushrooms were good standard fried deliciousness too along with a side cup of homemade ranch.

  The white pizza was delicious becauses I love ricotta, crispy crust and greasy pizza! The calzone was tasty as well. My co-worker had me try the garlic parmesan wings and wasn't too happy with them. They thought they tasted ""fishy"", and I could definitely see what they were talking about. I don't know if it was just the sauce they used or maybe perhaps they also use the fryer to fry seafood products, but we were not fans of the garlic parmesan wings.
