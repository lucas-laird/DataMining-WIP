I will definitely come back to this establishment, solely for the service I received from James, and if his coworkers can provide the same amazing service, I will definitely put this establishment on my top places to visit and recommend to others.",EiVTvi5MNA7LpzKa1N7gFg,0,0,5,pmSij2K-c7qmTcPAMp1Rrw

So rude and mouthy I can't believe it! The pizza is good...when they actually put more than 2 pieces of sausage on it. I ordered 2 coors lights on draft and the keg blew...she had to change it. No big deal...when she didn't run the lines enough on the keg the beer tasted flat, thick and a little warm. So u asked her nicely to run the keg a little more she got pissed and said what do u mean?! It's a brand new keg!! That's just coors light, if u want something different just let me know...but that just coors light! I said wow ok, it just tastes funny and the keg needs to be run a little longer. She just got pissy and walked away and served someone else! I'm really in disbelief. It wasn't her fault the beer tastes like that.. Just needed to be flushed a bit more. She came back and said what do u want and we just ordered different beer. She sloppily poured out new beer and just rolled her eyes. What a sweetheart! I will NEVER. Be back to this place again. Me and my husband come here just about every Sunday & Monday for football and it's always the same bartender and she's been slightly rude before.  we contemplated coming back today bc of her attitude. This definitely put the icing on the cake for us. We won't ever be back and we will make sure that EVERYONE we know does the same.",1NDMZA1aDL52-Iuit065KQ,1,1,1,MEiLI-SPrkqd91fapqvNpw

The bartender Marty was super accommodating and extremely on point.  I have never felt so at home and comfortable.  I highly recommend this bar, Marty is unbelievable.  The best bartender in Vegas hands down.",n9JrKWoqNbpc_clmkfkOGQ,0,0,5,zR_-jtppfN7EWC0L0giUEQ
