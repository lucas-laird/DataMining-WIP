She without a doubt costs her bartenders tips, and customers. Too bad she is oblivious to her customers needs and anyone else in her vicinity because she really wasn't a bad looking women. Oh well next time I'll go to Torrey pines pub.",JfKT9mTiee270W_pLPt7Wg,5,2,1,cp7u7tPFlNaP7PjEral-Lw

The TV on the patio had volume issues and we could only get TBSHD in non-HD mode. We had to order from Angelina's for food which took well over an hour. Definitely went downhill from what this bar used to be. On a positive note, it was less smokey than usual.",3S3u4e_HY0769SSWID4EOw,0,1,2,x6PmnZqW4KQ3BVvK-ngiJA
704235,2015-03-26,1,vugrV0cSoUGfS1Ef_mF7nQ,"I went here a few days ago with some friends looking to check out a new bar. The bar seemed alright at first, a little sketchy but nothing terrible. After a while we were told that they had beer pong so my friends and I jumped at the opportunity to do something besides sit and watch some mediocre karaoke. When we asked the bartender for the balls/cups he told us they were out and handed my friend $10 to go to the store to buy our own cups. Normally you would think doing a chore for a business would entitle you to a free or at least discounted pitcher... that was not the case here. We not only had to pay full price after doing work for the bar but it also took about 10 minutes to receive said pitcher. How this place is able to operate so terribly is far beyond my comprehension.

She wants quiet hours, people. We asked her to come speak to us, and she ""didn't want to get involved."" Don't buy a bar if you don't want people to have fun. Total buzzkill. Bye, Felicia.

With Santa Fe being a mad house my buddy and I went to this place to check it out because it was super close and we had been meaning to anyhow.  With football season in full gear I find this to be my new place to go, kick back, have a few beers and watch the games.  They have several TV's spread all around the bar with pretty much every game that is on.  If you're game is playing, but not on, just ask and they won't have a problem turning it on for you.  

We arrive and the bar is pretty much dead with the exception of a few patrons here and there.  This is your typical sports bar environment though so If you don't appreciate the fine sound of a foul mouth and screaming guys that their buddies team sucks and the ref's are idiots, it's probably not a place you want to go to.  

My buddy ordered a buck of Bud for like 10 bucks and I being Mr. Responsible for the day got a diet (she didn't charge for it, whoohoo!- yes it's the small things in life that count)  We were able to watch both our games as we are both separate teams and didn't have to stay at home watching direct TV arguing over hogging one team over the other; so it all worked out marvelously.  

Didn't have any food, but I saw several other people grubbing, I'm sure it's typical bar food and when paired with alcohol you really cannot go wrong.  The staff was friendly and so were the patrons, just a little rowdy, but what do you expect- this is football were talking about here! 

To get that final star, I probably would have liked to see them ask me if I wanted anything, not me having to go up and request it. Really not a big, deal as I will always come back, just letting yelpers know why I didn't go five.",aF0x_jysPRIkR9O-qq8xuw,1,0,4,p0X6_jGemDEeqRD46p16sA

My family was complaining that everyone sang really well at this place, but the approachability of the joint counterbalanced their fears of going up to the mic. 

When I completely embarrassed myself, the karaoke jockey made sure that people clapped for me when they didn't, haha!

Their mugs of beer are ginormous. You will certainly feel like a pirate. Everyone is pretty nice and welcoming. They have standard bar food if you're starving.

They have square bar with great bartenders that will have your drink ready before you sit down. If you become a regular you won't even have to order one cause as soon as you walk in its made. The food is pretty good and at a decent price. If you are into football this is the place to go.

4511845,2015-12-25,0,vugrV0cSoUGfS1Ef_mF7nQ,"Now here's the kinda place where the meaning of karaoke is stretched a bit. The setup is super bad just a tiny corner in the room where the ""regulars"" sit and the equipment is really trashy but yes in the sense of singing music on a screen it's karaoke. Secondly I see so often now in bars where these servers will cater to obviously intoxicated patrons there is something very wrong with those situations. Not only in the sense of the lawsuits they could face but how aggressive these people get with flirtation and their behaviour. I do like the pool tables and it's nice to see a dive bar with bathrooms that don't look like a slaughterhouse but there has to be a line with the cleanliness of the bar itself. I mean I know it's a dive bar I get it but feet sticking to the floor and a bar top that is wet and smells is a bit too much even for a dive standard.",k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,0,0,2,UknYdkb4nFGmw9Oi2yp6og
