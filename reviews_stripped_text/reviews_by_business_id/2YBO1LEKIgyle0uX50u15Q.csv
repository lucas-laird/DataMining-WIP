We let the host know that we had a party of 6, she said that was fine and the wait was about 30 minutes....ended up waiting in line for 45 minutes. Once we were at the front of the line, we were asked again how many were in our party. The host made an unpleasant face and then we were asked if we would sit at a table of four on one side of the restaurant and our other 2 at the bar...Uh, What?! No. So, we ended up sitting at two four person tables for the six of us. Very awkward.
Our waiter was not very welcoming...when we asked him about recommendations, he  looked very bothered and said ""everything is good"". We had to flag him down to give us water and utensils. 
We ordered fried tofu as an appetizer and that was pretty good. The rest of the food was just okay.

165821,2010-09-20,1,2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q,"I've been craving ramen lately and decided to venture out to the Gold Coast Casino. I got the Chashu Pork Miso Ramen for $10.95, but I guess it just was not as good as I remember. It was served with half of a boiled egg and a soggy piece of sweet potato tempura on top [wtf?]. The thin white ramen noodles were cooked al dente but the broth and chashu pork left much to be desired. The broth was watery and essentially tasteless, lacking in both miso flavor and salt. I actually added some soy sauce to the broth which is something I normally never do. It's a bad sign when I cannot stand to drink the broth. The serving of chashu was generous, but despite soaking in the broth, it reminded me of very dry, sliced turkey. The amount of noodles was on the small side which is a shame because that was the best part of the dish. It should go without saying, but $11 for a relatively small portion of ramen is not a good value. Granted it is a casino restaurant but still. At the very least, the restaurant was clean, and service was relatively quick and efficient. They kept my water glass full. I've had other noodles dishes here in the past, i.e. Mandarin Pork Tenderloin Ramen and Tepan [sic] Pork Tenderloin Noodle with Onion Black Pepper Sauce, which were mediocre to okay. I guess I'll have to satisfy my ramen cravings elsewhere.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,2,2,2,9mjb7VloVHhBY5CZr2fRUA

I ordered the beef and onion flat rice noodle. It is basically just that as the flat rice noodles had a decent wok-seared flavor and the beef was seasoned well. It's similar to the beef flat rice noodle dish at Ping Pang Pong (in same casino) but without the bean sprouts.

My friend ordered what ended up as a 'house special lo mein'. It's not on the menu but they made something that ended up like it. The chicken, beef, and shrimp had only a few pieces and the lo mein was more on the wet side.

This is a sort of place that's between a fast food sort and a sit-down. We hit the spot around 3pm and it wasn't busy at all. Service was okay and our refills were pretty well taken care of. If Ping Pang Pong hadn't been closed between 3-5pm I wouldn't have gone here. But we just drove into town and didn't feel like going too far.",H0or19jTnvDTtl3l9oKE6Q,0,0,3,k_GrUqH2jjZOgfD4UiUUlA

1030477,2016-06-15,3,2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q,"This restaurant is located inside the Gold Coast Casino. It is a cross between Hong Kong Style and Taiwanese Style dishes. They offer bento boxes, lunch specials, hot pot, and regular family style rice dishes. Overall, the food is good, but it didn't stand out in any way that would get me to come back.

The hot pot dishes are perfect for individuals. For a set price you get a pre-set dish of raw veggies and meats. The hot pot comes out on a portable gas stove and most people eat an order by themselves. If you eat on the lighter side, you can share this dish as well. I recommend the spicy soup base. It is spicy, but very tasty. I personally like to order a extra side order of egg noodle and wontons with my hot pot.

Their bento boxes are really great for people who want their own personal meal. Bentos boxes come with rice or fried rice, an egg roll with sweet n sour sauce, a bowl of egg drop soup, cucumbers, a fortune cookie, and an entree of your choice. Bento boxes average around $15 each.

Their appetizers and pretty good if you're wanting a taste of other dishes. The chicken wings are chicken wings. They are good, but nothing too special. The Peking Duck Tasters are good, but not worth the $10 because it only comes with 3 pieces of duck and buns.

The service was the absolute worst here, but it's not something uncommon for a traditional Chinese restaurant. My party sat waiting for the waiters to come over and take our drink order and food order for 30 minutes before we realized that you have to get the waiter's attention to order or they had no intention of coming to stop by our table. I literally asked for utensils five times and they would keep saying ""okay,"" but then never bringing me any. In addition, condiments like the sauces that came with the hot pot or the soup that came with the bento boxes had to be asked for instead of it automatically coming out with the dish. I don't care about fancy service, but I expect that the waiters would at least come take our order and bring out our food on their own instead of the customer having to beg for their service.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,5,4,3,7k5i-1UtL6MTn-ZjjUJprA

I have been visiting this place since it started the hot pot till it stopped for a couple of months serving hotpot and then re-instate serving hotpot. 
I am a big fan of hotpot and I love their soup base. I could safely say I visited them 2-3 times a week.
Couple of days back, I was there dining again and was informed that there was an increase of $1 for the set and also an optional additional of 50 cents if I want the spice for my soup base to be bagged before putting in the soup. It was fine for me as a $1 increase for that fantastic hot pot is not too much and reasonable. 
Today I was there again and this time round, I requested for extra chili sauce and was told there will be an additional charge for extra chili sauce. This totally pissed me off .
I don't mind paying for an increase in price of dish as I feel it is worth it but not $2 extra for extra chili sauce. I understand certain time, there might be increase in food cost but not for a little extra spice.

We ordered quite a few things:

Peking duck sampler - 3.5/5 - my expectations weren't that high for this - i mean, it's not a roast duck house - the duck meat was on the dry side, but the crispy duck skin and bun were more on point.

Fried tofu w/ garlic, shallots - 3.5/5 - they definitely know how to make a crispy fried tofu dish - however, the flavoring of the shallots and garlic could have been much more intense. Really unfortunately blander than it ought to have been

Spicy beef noodle soup - 4/5 - pretty darn good - and they even throw in some tendon too! 

Kong Xin Cai (open heart chinese vegetable) - 4/5 - we had originally asked for the snow pea leaf tips but they were sold out - so they made a fairly traditional version of this vegetable with fermented tofu (dou fu rou). Pretty on point. 

Spicy Lamb Hot Pot - 5/5. This was the best part of the meal!!!! I almost wish we did more hotpot and less of the other things. The soup base was really good (they throw in lots of traditional chinese herbs (five-spice, goji beans to name a couple), and red chili peppers. And they were fairly generous with the napa cabbage, fish balls, rice noodles, and everything else you eventually threw in to the pot.

The second best thing was that for all this, after tax/tip, it was only ~$34 a person. A Pretty darn good deal.",jqTa-RtGU26q3TFTmMZOAw,1,0,4,JPlVizRZjolX370ANiyoEA

The broth tasted good with all the chinese herbs and spices. However, when you have all those herbs and spices (i.e. star anise, clove, whole black pepper seeds) in the broth, it ruins the experience bc they will stick the ingredients you're cooking in the broth.

I must admit, I was apprehensive.  I saw an Noodle Restaurant in Gold Coast Casino and I was thinking: ""Really..?""  But my party of three ventured in after a long drive from So-Cal and we were knocked off our feet by how authentic the food was.

First thing's first - I always order the same beef noodle and we ALWAYS split the Peking Duck Sampler.  Although the gf sometimes changes up her order, I stick with what I've come to love.  Why do I love these dishes?  Because the soup is not too salty, the meat is delicious and the Peking Duck comes with cucumbers which provides a very different element to the flavor.  Everything just goes very well together.

What really makes this place our tradition is that we stumbled upon this establishment with such low expectations and it has now turned into one of our must-do traditions every time we visit Vegas.

When we were trying to get seated, we didn't know where to sit and we asked the hostess in the front and she said in a rude way that we had to stand over there, where it wasn't even obvious. All there was, was a sign but no ropes to indicate there was a line up. That didn't exactly sit well with me before my meal began. I just thought of it as whatever since she wasn't going to be part of my eating experience and everything was going to get better. But it didn't get better...

We quickly got our drink orders, but it took the waiters more than 15 minutes to get our food orders. Nobody came to see us after our drinks got dropped off. I don't know why it took so long for them to see us but I was pretty impatient at that point and something dramatically good would have to happen for me to have a good time. Lucky me, it stayed the same.

I ordered their fried rice, pork belly, and their beef hot pot. For the price that you pay for the amount of food you get is most definitely not worth it. The food itself tasted alright, but not so delicious where they can skeet by with giving you the amount they did. The pork belly was fattier than I was expecting, and I already know pork belly is fat, but this pork must have not had any muscle. The fried rice was greasy. My plate was very oily after I finished my plate of rice and although it tasted good, it was probably far from good for me. When it was time to pay, the waiters disappeared again! Like yo, why do you guys disappear like that, it isn't cool! 

To say the least, I feel as though it is overpriced and the service was terrible. I wouldn't recommend going there. Chinatown is very nearby the Gold Coast, I would say go eat somewhere else in that area as opposed to here",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,1,0,2,jAcC5v4vgWXWtGSvtPP48w

Appetizer - Wor Wonton Soup:  Plump dumplings, tender chicken slices, and a few shrimp, this was the best item ordered and is perfect to share with one other person. 

Main course - Combination Stir Fry Noodles: according to our waiter, this is considered to be a popular item. To me, this was bland, except for the occasional surprise of flavor I tasted from the slices of BBQ pork.

Main Course - Mushroom fried rice with breaded meat cutlet: Basic friend ride with minuscule amounts of mushrooms. I didn't care for the over-seasoned and fried meat cutlet.

SERVICE
Typical service you get at any other Chinese restaurant. Not too friendly, but they are quick to take your order, refill drinks, get you the check or anything else you need. 

FOOD
My usual is their Beef Combination ($14.99). You get a choice of mild or spicy but I can't handle any heat so I always get mild. You get a medium sized pot with a tea bag (?) which contains all kinds of spices in it. I actually ripped it open one time to investigate what was inside, as if I was in a biology lab doing a dissection. This tiny bag had herbs, slices of ginger and other unknown spices that I had no clue of. Needs further investigation. 

Beef Combination comes with mushrooms, tofu, fish cakes, corn tomato, daikon, taro, noodle and fish balls. Beef is thinly sliced and is very similar to shabu shabu. You also get a choice of lamb or seafood combination hot pot but I have only ordered beef.  It's a decent portion and I always enjoy cooking at the table.

It's not your ""fancy"" restaurant but more like your local corner restaurant where the service can be hit or miss but the food has never disappointed. Come here for your bowl of noodles, congee, BBQ and rice dish. 

The hotpot meals in the evening is a recent addition (I also understand it went away but then came back again) - and it is a good value with a broth base (too many hotpot places give you hot water instead of a broth). For anyone who has never had a Chinese hotpot - you put in the vegetables to cook and give the broth flavor, then add your meats, taking them out and dipping them in sauces to eat them, then after all the food is gone, you drink the wonderfully flavorful soup.

Noodle Exchange has the usual beef / chicken / seafood hotpots and the bases are regular, spicy and herbal. If you have several people eating the hotpot, you can ask for two broths - they bring out a divided bowl. But do give the herbal broth a try. Let it boil a few minutes for the herbs and spices to release their fragrance before you start cooking your meats.

I will have to make special mention of the sauces. The Hoisin sauce for the Peking duck, the Sate sauce for hotpots - they are exceptionally good.

Once again, a good solid choice for authentic Chinese food. Not fancy, just good.

P.S. If service was top notch, they'd get a five star from me.",0orGVjaNx1Hzh12vNRay0g,1,1,4,b7bC0-Ev9YBOUMqDbA62cA

Great: Firecracker Shrimp Roll. Get a few orders if you're more than 1-2 people.

Good:I had the Beef Rice Noodle stir fry - was good only with my side addition of sliced red chiles in soy sauce. Kicked it up a notch and made it super yum. Without the chiles, the dish is pretty tame. The dish had good flavor but probably a lot of MSG. I had that MSG-overload super-thirsty sensation the next morning.

Not-so-Great:
1. Could do with a few more tables in the space.
2. Servers have trouble managing the few tables that are already there.
3. Service overall was lacking. I observed one the few valuable tables being used to stock pile dirty dishes from a few other tables. No bussers were there to take them into the back to be washed and free up that table. A couple either was seated there or sat themselves at that table and proceeded to grow visibly aggravated that no one was clearing that table and waiting on them. 
4. I saw a group of four be seated in the middle of the dining area and asked to be moved elsewhere because they were catching a cold draft.
5. There is virtually no acknowledgment of your arrival at the front desk as you wait to be seated. The hostess & servers do congregate there but chat amongst themselves, despite growing numbers of hungry potential customers waiting to be seated. You almost have to trip someone so you'll get seated. 

All these things are fixable, and again... the Firecracker Shrimp Rolls are a must-get.",7Pxx2FehELyKthPj0OY1sg,0,0,3,SRAS_bgyCOH2x2oof6TMAg

This dish also had good sized pieces of crispy pumpkin which was surprisingly delicious!  If you like Honey Walnut Chicken you will most likely like this too.

Now to be honest, the shabu here is pretty decent. Someone mentioned the soup base is plain and unfortunately I can't comment since I didn't drink the soup from my pot, but someone in my party did and she had a regular soup base and said there was actually some tasty flavor, similar to that of Xiao Fei Yang (this herbal based hot pot chain in Los Angeles).

For me, I ordered the beef with a spicy soup base. By looks, the soup didn't look anywhere near spicy (a few drops of chili oil and dried peppers were thrown into the soup). However, the amount of food given is extremely filling. The stuff is typical - a large plate of your choice of meat followed by a plate of vegetables (shittake mushrooms, lots of cabbage, spinach, tofu, enoki mushrooms, etc). I almost could not finish.

Shabu sauce is given and there is soy sauce available at the table. The pots are individual to each person and they're lit on this cool purple wax.

I ordered an iced green tea, and it was pretty dull. Flavorless. Maybe I should've gotten something else.

Service is good, a few waiters come around occasionally to refill water and take away any trash. On my visit, the manager actually took our order and delivered our food.

I don't know of any other shabu places on The Strip, but I would recommend Noodle Exchange for their shabu. I think quite a few Asians who go to Vegas know of this place (it's how I ended up going) and there were a lot of other Asians eating here too. Haha.

But I'd say if you're sick of buffets (and the lines) or the high ballin restaurants of The Strip, definitely venture off a little to find Noodle Exchange, which is located inside Gold Coast. Not too expensive and definitely filling.",ug2vTCuxIEnFir-r5FIa_Q,1,1,3,eN-XUsDs3U4dz8eTwQqeuw

We each picked a personal soup noodle dish and shared a plate of Garlic Snow Pea Leaves $10.  Mine was the Won Ton Noodle Soup with Beef Stew (shrimp & pork fillings) $10.99.

And I was very happy to get mine!

I ordered the spicy broth.  Along with the chili peppers, there were also several herbs in the broth.  I felt good that not only was I eating something good but healthy, too.  

The broth had excellent flavor but not overly spicy.  If you do want it spicy, just eat a piece of the chili pepper or break it and let it cook.  I actually took them out half way during cooking because I didn't want it to be too spicy.  Now, this is Chinese Hot Pot, not Japanese Shabu Shabu.  The sauce that accompanied with it was Chinese Satay Sauce which I LOVE!  

The veggie plate consists of Baby Bok Choy, Cabbage, Corn, Fish Balls, Tomato, Frozen Tofu, Tofu Skin, Straw Mushroom, Fish Cake, Taro (LOVE these), and Glass Noodle.  For the meat, I chose Rib Eye Beef.  I really enjoyed my dinner.  

During the meal, the manager, Mr. Howard Chang, came over to chat.  He actually recognized me from my Yelp review!  How awesome was that?  He is such a cool guy!  And the entire staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient.  Refills were provided many times.

Granted everyone raves about this place. Maybe it was a bad day or maybe they were too busy to care. Either way it was bad all around. Let me tell you why. 

We came in and most tables were full. Ok that's fine I've been places before and we had exceptional service even though they were insanely busy. We were seated quick but it took a while before we got water or menus. The beau decided on the seafood hot pot and I decided on skirt steak and tomato fried rice. 

Upon placing our order I asked for lemon for my water. I didn't get it until after we recieved our food and that's because I had to ask for it again. Hot pot igniter and pot came out quick. I mean why not ?! All your going to do is add raw fish to the pot. It should be quick. The problem with the hot pot is this. 


Hot Pot with Seafood - for $15.99 u get a big plate full of Sole , Squid , Shrimp , Taro , lettuce ???? Tomato , cabbage , fish balls , squid balls , noodles and tofu. Not bad for the price. It would have been great if the broth wasn't overloaded with all the chinese herbs. Just too much. I know it's for flavor but literally it was an overload , just way too much. It should be placed in a cheesecloth so it can flavor the broth but not stick to every piece Making this hot pot so hard to enjoy , when you're constantly spitting out bits and pieces of fennel and clove ! Eek ! We even tried to fish them out or the broth but there were just too many. 

Wok fried Diced Skirt Steak with Garlic and Basil with Tomato Fried Rice - the first few bites were ok. Pretty tender beef. No trace of garlic. Basil was very faint if not there at all. Then came the fat. Chunks of fat with some meat attached and gristle. I'm not a fan of fat unless it's barely there and makes the meat buttery and savory. I can deal with that. Huge chunks of fat and gristle is not something I enjoy. Of the portion I was served more than half was fatty gristly pieces of non enjoyable scraps. The tomato fried rice was good. I will admit. Not enough to save this meal. I even wanted to order steamed buns but our server was too busy to check on us or refill our drinks. There were however other employees taking breaks passing us by and no one stopped or noticed we were trying to eye them or that our drinks were empty.

Their mini hotpot looked very delicious and had plenty of stuffs on the side to cook, along with their tasty raw meats. My girlfriend and I ordered this mini hotpot of water-boiled spicy fish. Let me tell you this, this pre-made hotpot was probably the best tasting Chinese food I've ever had in Vegas! It wasn't spicy, it was just having the spicy kick to it after eating it! The hotpot also contained plenty of stuffs - tofu, veggies and I especially love their glass noodles which fully soaked in the spicy oil seasoning of the fish soup. It was so bomb, very flavorful and filling! The hotpot was more than enough to share with 2 people, we each ordered one and it was way too much food that we couldn't be able to finish after stuffing our faces with this delicious hotpot! If you were happened to be in Vegas and nearby the casino location, please go check it out and order this water-boiled spicy fish hotpot (not exactly sure the name), but do ask the server they know!

We then ordered the beef special and the seafood special. The overall hotpot experience is fine, I just feel that it could be better. Dirty cups were provided and we asked if the workers could change it, but it seemed like it was a burden to them. And one worker in particular ignored my mom multiple times which I find pretty rude.

Menu:
Hotpot              1/5
Service:           5/5
Management   2/5

I had tried all three different kind of hotpot here.  The plain one, the special and the spicy one.  The plain one was average.   Anyone who knows how to put water and buy all the ingredients at a Chinese supermarket can make the plain one at home.  The special was awful.  The pepper was floating on top of the soup and the flavor didn't simmer in as it suppose to.  The chef pretty much just put in the raw Chinese herb material in and serve.  The correct way should be cooked in the back with  with a stock for several hours as a soup base.  Not the case here.  Same goes for the Mala flavor (the spicy pot)  You have take extra effort to ask for the condiments such as satay sauce, garlic, chili sauce.  They even charge you for the egg to put in your condiment sauce.  How do people eat a plain taste of the hotpot without the condiment sauces?

The services was slow because they seem to be under staff.  The waiting line was ridiculously long.  There are simply not enough staffs. 
However, we need to give their staffs a lot of credits for putting in the effort of putting up with some awful customers.  An reasonable man screamed at the staff because he refused to give the staff his room number nor proper name to put it to his room charge.  At the end, the customers starts screaming at the staff and no management was brave enough to tell the customers that he was at fault.  I believe the cashiers had put up her best effort to do her job.  However, the failure to see her managers to back her up nor stop the clients from disturbing other customers was a total failure on the management.",DNxBV9OfvwNkNWZwLCyDkg,1,0,1,L_IFac0ioOsv3sYmERV8Vw

Very popular is the personal hot pot especially during the winter months.  My personal favorites are the beef or lamb hot pots with a side of fish filets for variety.  I like the clear broth to keep everything fresh and healthy but I recommend trying the spicy broth and herbal broth at least once.  Sometimes the wait can be annoying since hot pot usually takes longer to cook and eat and customers just tend to linger longer than usual during dinner time.  Noodle Exchange has a convenient bar seating area for solo dining or a quick meal.  The lunch combinations provide a good amount of food for the price but the quality and taste sometimes reflects what you pay for as some dishes are bland and some dishes are overwhelming with flavor.,hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,1,0,4,2qcvQ0hZyBWkBgW3GSL3Jw
