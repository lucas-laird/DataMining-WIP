The waitresses and the bartenders were attentive and really nice. They made sure that our empty glasses were taken and that when we needed more drinks, they were right on top of it. The decor was very modern and the seats were comfortable. I'm sure on a busy night, the area where we were sitting would have been bottle service or VIP. I would come here again for  more drinks if we decided to opt out of a club night or if you need to kill some time. I did notice that the crowd was a little older, I did noticed a group of cougars prowling and having some drinks and there were a lot of middle aged couples, too.

Me and the boys don't really go out unless we're getting a table somewhere and Jorge always makes sure we get taken care of. What's nice about this place is even if bottle service isn't your thing, it's still spacious enough to have a good time. The DJ spins hip hop on Saturdays and unlike most DJ booths these days you can actually put in a request; and he'll play it. The crowd ebbs and flows so even if you show up and it's slow all I can say is don't leave because the party always appears just when you think it might not. I've gone out to all the biggest venues in Vegas for the last decade, but now I'm over the super club and much prefer the upscale bar/ultra lounge scene.

I'm going to be brief: 
1.) Service is decent
2.) Beautiful atmosphere and extremely spacious lounge areas 
3.) Great place to kick it with friends. Laid back scene with friendly people just ready to have a good time. 

There are just so many places in Vegas that make you feel like a sardine. If your down to be attacked and crammed in a club go to XS. 

The owner or one of the bouncers was extremely friendly. There was a small incident that occurred with a server and the owner/bouncer came over and personally handled it. It was awesome.

I would highly suggest this place if you want to pre game or end a night. My favorite aspect of V bar? Your really free to be loud, dance, get rowdy and no one really complains. Overall a great spot to kick it and have fun.",wRjbceqeNN4XLFBujo5ttw,5,3,4,Rn9qbnfATRvV1EFHbnnwTA

They do bottle service, sitting at the bar or they have 3 tables in the back to smoke at. If you get there early enough you can get a table. The price wasn't to bad, I believe it was $30 for the Hookah. 

The atmosphere is great. They have a DJ and there's room to dance around if you want to. It does get pretty busy later on. The drinks are really good there too. I had a pineapple vodka, often there is just way to much vodka and it makes the drink horrible, but this had the perfect mix. The bartenders are friendly too.

The bar tender was cool, she was outgoing, pleasant and made good drinks. The service started going south when we decided to look for a booth to sit at so we could kick back and enjoy some hookah.  We ordered the hookah and it was delivered exceptionally fast, so fast that I think they brought out someone's unfinished hookah. The first hit I took was full of ash, I called the guy back and he took it to the back, I took 2 hits from the ""new"" one and it was very harsh.

I was recommended to get a table at the V bar for NYE for a group of ours. I contacted Danny, their General manger and he was so tentative to the reception. I book events with groups all the time, large scale and small stuff and even though this was going to be for leisure, I still expected decent customer service. Well, V bar management out did themselves. They offered me discounted packages and were flexible on adjusting the amount of people in my group. We  flip flopped a lot. If I were the V Bar I would have told me to go fuck myself, but they didn't. 
Danny kept tabs on my situation as it develop since my friends were undecided. His patience was what impressed me the most.  Unfortunately, my group split and I didn't have enough people to get a table. Yes this is strictly business and thats how the game is played but I left feeling like they deserve my business.

There was no cover and no line so that was a plus, but that was the only positive thing.  There was LOTS of room to dance since there really wasn't anyone there.  

We stayed here a maximum time of 6 minutes. We danced to one song because we really liked how catchy that ""apple bottom jeans and the boots with the fur"" song was.

My girls and I were dancing not taking notice of everyone else around; just appreciating the music.   We finally notice the guys that had basically sprinted across the room to us and the only reason we notice them was because they were already dancing so close to us without even asking or signaling that they wanted to dance.  These guys were creepy and trying to be very touchy with us. We started to lose enthusiasm for the song and as the song ended, one of my girls told them, we are going to go now.  We all immediately turned to leave and walked away very quickly.  Behind us, we heard one of the guys say, ""they're running away!"".  

My girls and I had a horrible time here.  it wasn't really V Bar's fault for our bad time; it was the guys that scared us away.

The bartender that helped me initially seemed confused or preoccupied because he seemed perplexed by my drink order. Fortunately, the next bartender was bit more engaging. And those are the bartenders that tend to get tipped a bit MORE! It is much appreciated.

I was here for about an hour or 2 and then the bar closed. There were not too many people here which made for a relaxing and easy going night. 

Things just worked out well here!

All within a 3 minute time frame. He did this all night. I'm all for diversity and playing all types of music THROUGH OUT the night, not in like 2 minutes. Like it was just horrible. Another thing that I didn't like was the bathrooms were not located inside the bar. You had to walk out and go to the ones outside. They weren't far or anything.

Located on the casino floor of the beautiful Venetian Hotel, V Bar is a decent sized place that offers happy hour deals from 5-8pm, 7 days a week. 
The inside of V Bar is dimly lit, with a large L shaped bar, quite a few booths, soft benches and a dance floor. After 9pm V Bar becomes a nightclub that features a DJ, hookah and more. Once V Bar becomes a club you'll have to pay a cover charge before entering. Since I'm not much of a clubber we left before 9pm.  

My party of six showed up to V Bar at 5:30pm to partake in their HH deals. 

Their HH features half off beers, well cocktails and a small percentage off of their specialty cocktails. 

The reason I had such a great time at V Bar was that even though we showed up during their happy hour, and even though it was a Saturday evening during Spring break weekend, the place was a ghost town. We drank at V Bar for almost two hours and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. It was awesome. 

I had quite a few drinks in the almost two hours I was at V Bar. My favorite drink of the evening was their Creamy Coconut Mojito. It was strong but still smooth and sweet. I also really enjoyed their Key Lime Pie Martini, Blueberry Stoli Press and some crazy shots our adorable server brought us.

Since it was HH the prices were great. The service here was also amazing. Our server was super cute and very friendly. She really helped make our experience at V Bar an enjoyable one.   

I'll definitely be returning to V Bar the next time I'm in LV. It's a great place to start your evening before a crazy night on the strip",YWFbTcVnun8i03XnEU7kVg,18,15,4,OC3yalTQoGtvrDwM0f_7Sw

Luckily, just as we were about to give up, we passed in front of this inconspicuous entrance with a giant V. We were sure the cover was going to be pricy. However, when we asked at the front desk, they asked whether we wanted bottle service ($200...reasonable) vs. just going to the bar. 

We started at the bar, but the cocktail waitress gave us a big table despite us not getting a bottle! Service was A++. The drink menu had delightful mojitos, orange cream martinis, among other items. 

Probably one of the BEST drinks I've ever had was their Key Lime Pie Martini. I had two in a row, which I almost never do with food or drinks. The pie crust was sprinkled around the rim of the cup. If you crave a drink without having to suffer through the taste of hard liquor, the drinks at this place are for you!

The decor is spacious and trendy. The couch seating is modern and comfortable. The music is fantastic and danceable, but not so loud as to overwhelm conversation. Within 20 minutes, everyone was up and dancing, with people breaking on the floor, having a good time. Actually, everyone mingled and we were all dancing with each other until the club closed.

Great find!! May be different during the week, but on the Sunday night we went, it was exactly what we needed. Amazing drinks, good dancing, and social vibe.",qgXcgfdrk5tzmLBq4_h6mQ,4,2,5,3l5GmMoQmcR73dKHFNnpeQ

Music here was pretty good, considering the DJ was a friend of my buddy who I rolled with. As a result, we were allowed in the VIP section, which led to some awesome bottle service. It's quite a perk when you know the DJ. 

Its nice to know that there's no line, the wait staff is super nice and attentive, the bar isn't too crowded, the drinks are cheaper, and you have easy in-and-out access for the entire night. I have witnessed people stumble out of the club to the bathroom down the hall and come back with bloodshot eyes from vomiting, only to go for another round inside. I'm not too proud in saying that I myself was one of those people, but then again, its Vegas.

We told the bouncer we didn't want a bottle because we were drinking all day and could not handle a bottle of liquor. So we left.

Just don't judge us, please and thank you). That's besides the point... Where was I??? Oh yes, that's right, so the one man didn't care we were dancing on the seating. However a few moments later a lady bartender told us to get off the seating. I don't know, I feel like the staff constantly gave us mixed messages.

I like that we can get tables without having to pay for bottle service. The hookah service is decently priced, however, I'm not too confident in their hookah staff's knowledge. The hookahs are always harsh and it seemed like we were smoking more ash than anything. I ordered a mint mixed with fruit flavor and barely tasted anything but a hint of something that tasted like a watered down fruit roll-up.

They could use some improvement on the quality of hookah they're serving. It's not hard, just takes some research. Perhaps some better coals to have smoother smoke as well. It could just be me, because I almost wanted to go in the back and set up the hookah just as I do at home, but I expected a little more quality at $30 bucks a bowl. Rhumbar at the Mirage does a pretty decent job.

I don't know if the rope was to make the place look cool or desirable???  That sort of schizo feeling continued on into the bar (this is a bar right? not a night club?).  Like it was missing a big dance floor and possibly a light show or something.

Moving on...the place had some cozy looking couches and tables, but they were all reserved so I didn't get a chance to test if the couches were indeed cozy.  My friend and I grabbed a seat at the bar.  Our bartender was really fast and friendly and made some really strong drinks.  (Major bonus points for her - she was really cool.)  Once we kicked back with our drinks, we enjoyed ourselves.  

I guess maybe this is the kind of place you come pre-club to get in the mood for the real thing, but whatever.  It was a nice place to relax after a long day and have a well made cocktail.",wPif9x51jxzO8DS6h-ZY4g,1,1,3,oWrEojLLhzCyZFU91aDgwg

Granted you have to travel into the casino to find a loo...but hey baby this is vegas, least your drink can go with you!
So if you're looking for a fun night minus the hassle of a big name club (like studio, light etc)  Try Vbar, you'll be glad you did!",PTY4nk9YobaeagjInz7C_Q,1,0,5,Eiwf1sORvP5Q7iCvbRzQQQ
5885407,2014-01-03,0,Kn23LDd740SBVJ7mum0fwg,"Very loud hookah bar more than a lounge. You can't really carry on a conversation because the music is very loud. Service is terrible, the drink server was hard to get a hold of cause she walks away as soon as she sets your drink down and the music is so loud she can't hear if you're trying to call her back. Hookah service was really bad, had to ask 3 times for a hookah and once we finally got one, the server never came back to adjust the coals.",EyL3Kx1k0IubaNfKvI6YNQ,0,0,2,fodrfsPHX7cYStBwAPFIGA

Was here for a private event and the hosts were so nice and crafted some great martinis. As it was early evening, the music was at a tolerable level. The best way to experience a bar, in my opinion. We could actually talk amongst ourselves!
A nice stop to try some superb martinis, enjoy the comfy seating areas and escape the throngs in the casino!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,1,1,4,MtKrkoMsy-8e4yN9EWvYdw
5945430,2008-05-28,0,Kn23LDd740SBVJ7mum0fwg,i really enjoyed my first Vegas bar here. I came here twice during my stay in the Venetian. The service from the bartenders were awesome and fast.  They knew what to recommend and stuff. The music was great too. It was definitely more crowded on saturday compared to friday night. i liked how it opened very late. Great place to meet people and just chill. The drinks were strong and some were good.,Kx4RtLVvwFuH2F4hWKB0ig,1,0,5,1sxsM_n7EpO9tqQHBppjsA

Unfortunately by the time we got here, we decided we were more hungry than thirsty so we headed over to Noodle Asia instead.  That and this place was totally dead, only had maybe a handful of patrons in there.  But I'm sure if we had more folks with us, we would have brought the party to them!",yy_KQA1FtwilaG-7LB4BgA,0,0,3,R35bRM1uA8t5LzTz_ruYZw
