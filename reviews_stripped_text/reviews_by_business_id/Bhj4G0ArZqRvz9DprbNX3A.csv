91569,2017-02-15,1,Bhj4G0ArZqRvz9DprbNX3A,So me and my BF were in Vegas for Vday and of course i wouldn't be myself unless I stopped at a hookah bar. I live in Houston and hookah literally consumes people's lives down here so I had to get my fix. I found a Groupon only $10 for 1 hookah flavor between 2 people. Can't beat that. I was in a rush and didn't notice I paid for the wrong Groupon (they had 2 options to purchase. One was for 1 hookah flavor and the other was for $20 worth of food) both were the same price so I asked can they still honor the Groupon. Al said he'll do it for us even though he's not supposed to so I was so grateful!! Only thing that kinda made me upset was I asked for some water only because I seen someone drinking a cup of water at the bar while doing HW and he decides to bring out 2 bottles of water. I didn't even make a big deal even though I much rather had water with ice chips that would've been free. At the end the water was $2/bottle. But whatever he honored the wrong Groupon so I'll return the favor by giving him 5 stars.,k93EZqyzHHlBQWw4y9YI3w,1,1,5,GVckBFFUXY_8tcDn-JBhIw

We took the recommendation for the waiter for the choice of hookah flavor (red gummy bear and white gummy bear ). Once it arrived we tried it a few times and it was disgusting. We notified the waiter who said that we just needed to allow the tobacco to warm
up. We asked him to start the hookah and it was still nasty. After that we asked for a different flavor which they brought. The rest of the night they proceeded to ignore us. They only time we received service is if we went to the bar or flagged down the waiter, even thought he was walking back and forth around the restaurant. At one point the hookah was no longer hitting as well so we asked for them to just change the coals. The waiter told us it's not the coals it's the tobacco. He refused to put more coal on the hookah unless we got a refill ( we had only been there for about an hour). Definitely won't be going back!!

The staff is very friendly, they work very fast paced and always make me feel welcome. I've become more and more of a ""regular"" because with every visit the food gets better and better. 

The staff: Very friendly, very fast speed of service and always welcoming. Guy, Nadav, Orel, Josie, Jason and Nitzan know me by name and always take care of me when I am there. 

The food: IS SOOO DELICIOUS! I love their falafel, as close to authentic as I can get. I also recommend the hummus with mushrooms and onions. Even with Uber Eats the food is always hot and delicious. 

The Hookah: I have different flavors everytime. The guys will mix something up just for me to have a new flavor everytime. With such comfy chairs my friends and I can sit there all day. (did I mention... they have WIFI!)

This place gets 5 stars for me. It is totally worth dropping by, at any time of day because they are open LATE! *winning*",Ezmxjfsx7BYGoqMZqUr0Gg,2,2,5,kvWTp_-p264_W3utGS3r6Q
1554589,2016-06-19,0,Bhj4G0ArZqRvz9DprbNX3A,"We've been coming here before they expanded the restaurant and have usually had a decent experience. On weekday nights they're decent service wise but for the last couple weekend nights the service has been terrible. 

Soon after ordering our first hookah and drinks, we were pretty much on our on. No one came to check on us and getting another drink required waving your arms like crazy just to get the attention of the bus person while he's walking by only to have him say he'll grab  one of the waiters who usually either forgets or comes 10-15 minutes later. 

Then after waiting another 30 minutes our hookah refill arrives and it's the wrong flavor (think getting straight mint when you wanted a fruity flavor). Then because no one came to check on our table, again, we had to walk to the bar to have it fixed.

Things go okay until the coal runs out on our hookah. We then asked 5 different times (2 times to one waiter, 2 times to the other, and 1 time to the bus person) who all said ""alright it's coming right away! 2-3 minutes"" only to have us wait 20 minutes each time and then having to go up to the bar to ask again (Yes we spent an hour and half asking for coals which were never delivered). Then out of frustration we decide that the waiting and poor service was just too much and had to go up to the bar to ask for the check. 

No one came back to the table to grab the check and again we had to walk the check up to the bar and hand it to someone. We also again asked to have some more coals while doing this. 30 minutes passes and we did not get our bill back (or the credit cards that were handed over) or the coals we had requested again. Finally after flagging down the same waiter again, he brought us our check to sign. 

I know that they were pretty busy last night, but what does someone expect for a Saturday night? Almost every table was filled and they had only two people taking orders with one bus person. All three just kept promising to bring what we asked but never apologized. I think it would really help this place out to have a couple extra servers on weekend nights. Every other table around us was equally having to flag people down or walk to the bar just to get someone's attention. 

It's sad because this place is decent on weeknights. One of the other owners works there and he's always very nice and attentive (a little bit longer hair, and always wears a button up shirt and jeans, Nitzan?). But the one that was working on Saturday night (short hair, usually wears a t shirt) rarely came to the table unless we spent time waiting for him to serve someone else and then flagging him down. Nitzan is an amazing server and always provides the best service, but the other guy while polite is not very attentive at all. 

In the end our bill was $90 for three people. The hookah wasn't bad while there was still coals on it and the drinks were okay. The service is really what killed our evening. We really couldn't even leave when we go frustrated with the service because it took another 45 minutes just to get our check and have them run it through the register. 

Disclaimer: We've been here many times, and the weekends usually repeat themselves. I feel like I know how to differentiate between bad service and a busy restaurant. This went beyond and above that. We basically got ignored even after going to and finding someone 5-6 different times. I'm usually pretty forgiving on any kind of server, but the servers here are the owners and they really need to just hire a couple people on the weekends. We still tipped 20%.",LDumTc7WsK0LK9vpu9R3UA,2,0,1,gQD5SJAliMx7_IgJy2X0uA

He was as funny as a comedian and  very professional. The staff was courteous and diligent. 

At the time of the hookahs were $10 and the second session was free. Even if they didn't have the promotion going on, the hookahs were reasonably  priced at $15.00 then $12.00 for your second round. The prices for the food menu are decent.

We ordered the hookah flavor pirates' cave. The hookahs hit good and lasted us around a hour on our first bowl. We ordered the kabob plate and it came with two sides. My boyfriend and I shared. Even though we shared the kabob plate, it filled us up.

This is another cool thing about this place - they randomly bring out free shots for everyone if you are there long enough. The drinks are also very cheap so if youre looking for a place to pregame before a night out on the town. Shots are cheaper than beers haha The mixed drinks such as a crown and coke or jameson and ginger ale are always really strong.

For just under $30, you can get a gigantic shwarma wrap and an order of schnitzel.
The wrap is huge. It's like a Mediterranean take on a burrito, packed with meat, some red cabbage and salad, and a bit of hummus for good measure. You also have an option for mayo, but I don't know why on earth you'd do that. It's fan-frickin'-tastic.
The schnitzel was my BF's pick: two thin-pounded, crispy cutlets, with two sides, for a filling portion of fresh food at $14. Not bad at all!

Side options include fries, onion rings, rice, red cabbage salad, white cabbage salad, Mediterranean chopped salad, egg salad,or cole slaw. Red and white cabbage salad are both pretty similar to coleslaw and the chopped salad is fresh and tasty.

I had to get take out because of my daughter but the environment itself looked like something I can enjoy with my wife. 

It was $13! Ouch. Over priced in my opinion and that is the reason for the - 1 star. Hope to find other shawarma places that can compete.",mlXLPBayYqjbUMmtFrlw4g,0,0,4,ixEU61Tao-H2Q_nWv-nT-w

They have a lot of flavors for hookah so we decided on Sex on the beach. The flavor was cool but I have had better. They really didn't have many  upgrades like fresh fruit like other places. The hookah smoked well for about 2 hours. 
The food was the best part! We had the hummus with sharwma which was fantastic. I especially like the pita bread it came with. Then we ordered the mixed meat plate with corn salad and fries. Everything was the bomb and had a lot of flavor. Kudos to the chef!!! Also they have takeout if you just want to pick up. 
I rated it a 3 mostly because of the service which was really slow. At first it was cool but it got a little busy and it was like they forgot about our table. At the end it took 30 minutes to pay the bill. We waited at the table but finally went to the bar and waited another 15 minutes. They were to busy talking to friends and catching up to help other customers. It really left a bad taste in my mouth since I was ready to go home.

2472148,2016-06-19,0,Bhj4G0ArZqRvz9DprbNX3A,"I live believing on the premise of ""first impressions"" having a lasting effect, and this one did not go particularly well in their favor.  Here's a breakdown of our first visit:

1. My girl and I waited about 20 minutes before being acknowledged by any staff and we actually had to ask, ""Hey do you work here?"" That should have been our first hint to leave but they seemed to be not too busy (all empty tables on our side of the room) and we didn't feel like traveling any further.

2. That person we asked ""if he worked here"" had to tell someone at the bar that we've been waiting and haven't been served, and 10 minutes later our server sits at our table and asks how long we've been waiting and we say ""about 30 minutes."" No consolation or apology - just took our hookah order and left.

3. Hookah experience was mediocre and hitting smoothly enough but no one came to check how we were doing or any coal check or blowouts for harshness.  The coal died out. I had to go up to the bar and request for more coal. It took 15-20 minutes for it to appear.

4.  Luckily the hookah itself required minimal maintenance because if it needed any actual attention we would have been screwed. Might as well stayed at home if I had to work for my own hookah setup. Stood up and flagged our server to order a refill for Blue Mist (figured if the setup was holding up we could chill for a bit without having to bother staff).

5. 20 minutes later the first guy we asked if he worked here apologized for the bad service (no consolation offered) and basically said ""We're too busy taking care of other people."" 5 minutes later I went up to the bar to request the check since he FORGOT that we ordered a refill for Blue Mist. Fastest part of all the service was him bringing us the check but made us wait to collect it, and so I walked it up to the bar once again.

6. He had trouble physically swiping my card and came back to our table asking if we had another method of payment and I said no. At this point my girl told him ""To be honest the service hear sucked.""  His reply: ""Thank you for the feedback, that's out service. Let me try to swipe your card again."" No apology or consolation offered.  Of course this time he was able to get my card to go through and I wrote on the signature slip: ""Forgot about our Blue Mist.""

Luckily there are a lot other choices on the southwest side like Paymon's or even all you can smoke at Karma in North Las Vegas. Yeah, we'd actually drive that far so we wouldn't have to experience ""do it yourself hookah"" again and the immaculate service at each place respectively is a huge bonus.

Disclaimer: Read the other less than perfect reviews and BEWARE the bottled water do not open it (unless you ordered it) or you will be charged $2 per bottle. O_O",QkgOAVkYCXTN-oNsXK4weA,5,0,1,yVHu6kspR2hYJJtS4-4sVg

We were greeted by a really nice server and sat at a booth in the back. We started with the blueberry mango hookah - it was excellent! Absolutely loved the flavor! We also ordered Bloody Maries - they were decent (I'm super picky with Bloodies - the mix was good though).
Before ordering any food, pretzels and pickles were placed as starters - I love pickles so I was thrilled! We then started our food order with the grape leaves and the hummus with mushrooms and pita - both were absolutely fantastic! For our entree, we ordered the medley of meats and we stuffed our faces.

Sat my self down on the nearest table and waited 20min before getting up and going to the bar where I asked if they had waiter service or not. He quickly brushed me off saying I'll mr right with you and continued his conversation with what seemed to be s friend or regular. Waited another 10 min before he made his way to my table. I ordered a hookah and lemon drink which were subpar. Ordered grape mint buh all I could taste was mint. Asked for coals and they never came back.

As you walk in on the right side they have more tables for people who just want to dine and on the left that would be where the couches and tables are for those who wants to dine and have a hookah. 

Sunday Funday for us so of course we went to the left. Our sever was super cool and to was very attentive. We started with the house hookah special mix which consisted of like guava, grape and some mint I believe (don't quote me) but it was good! Order of the 24pc wings (chili/buffalo) and some fries. Did I mention how fast the service was? Oh okay well it was super fast! Those wings came out like what seemed in seconds and they were delicious.

We were greeted by Guy who explained the dishes. I was already excited about the felafel and it was the best I have had! We not only devoured an appetizer of felafel with hummus but also some very good stuffed grape leaves. Our friend had a sabih in pita with eggplant (this has to be my choice on our next visit) and my husband loved the schnitzel of tender chicken and sesame seeds. I of course stuck with my felafel fixation but the felafel pita sandwich is so big I loved half and carried half of it home.

3304170,2013-04-02,8,Bhj4G0ArZqRvz9DprbNX3A,"Any quest to find a decent hookah lounge in this town is daunting. So few places get it right, and I have been all to often served up a $15 bowl of charcoal and ash.

Fortunately, Layla is one of the few lounges where the owners know what they are doing. The owners are nice and very attentive. They come by regularly with coals to and make sure you have everything you need.  A wide selection of flavors (Fumari, Starbuzz, Al Fakher and more) ensures that even the most discerning hookah smoker will find what they are looking for. The hookah was hitting great and service was on point.

The place is small but super clean. The lounge is really narrow but can accommodate large and small parties on their giant sofas. Though there isn't much flexibility in the seating, its comfortable and you can tell the owners care about keeping the place clean. The music on the night we went was awesome. Great mix of EDM, not sure if its the norm but 

They serve some food but the prices seem to be a bit high, few dishes below $10. We didn't order so I can't really comment if they are worth the price or not. Our server told us that they are going to be getting a liquor license soon which will definitely be a big plus as only a few lounges in town serve up alcohol.

We actually noticed the hookah lounge when we had first parked and knowing my obsession with having hookah after eating sushi, we decided to give it a try after we ate. 

First off, this place is very clean and very modern looking. It is nicely decorated and kinda gives you a lounge feel without being too dark and whatnot. This is also a restaurant so they have a counter and kitchen which you can see as you enter  but its really no big deal.

The couches are very comfortable in my opinion, and even though the suite is not that big, the couches and space for each table have a lot of leg room and whatnot. so that was a big plus as well.

Last and most importantly is the hookah. The hookah was hitting the whole time we were there and they have a variety of flavors. Being middle eastern, I am very picky regarding the whole hookah experience, from the coals to the flavor to the smoke produced. I'm really happy to say that this place got 3/3 for everything. 

The owner, Sean, is very chill and approachable. We mainly talked to his brother (which I forgot his name), but both were awesome and made sure we had a good experience. I definitely recommend this place to anyone for hookah and I would go a lot more often, but being in medical school kinda pre-occupies my life at the moment haha.

Oh and also, we didn't try the food since we were stuffed from the AYCE sushi next door, so next time we'll get some food and see how it is....but so far, 100% in my grade book!! haha",V_dT-3YVhfcwlTM_ztG0fQ,9,5,5,ukjBjVxz814SR9ZNTYrtWw

I walked in way overdressed after coming from dinner where my dining companion bailed on me so I ate alone (nothing gets between me and great food!) and decide to just continue with our plans by myself.  Admittedly, I was a bit uncomfortable walking int a Hookah lounge by myself because I don't smoke and it was out of the norm for me. (Restaurants I know my way around... this was all new!)

Fortunately, I can have some big brass ones so I just tucked them in and opened that door.  I looked around and it seemed like a combination of a small bar with food and then upholstered benches (like sofas but not quite) with a pair of seating areas facing each other and a coffee table in between.  As I gazed around a couple of (Do we call them Hookahers?) invited me to sit across from them.  Obviously they sensed I was a little uncomfortable.  I was grateful!

The server immediately came up, made me feel comfortable, explained things to me and as a non-smoker what might be too harsh, etc.   I decided on chocolate and almost instantly out came the pipe.  I made a joke about being old enough to know a big bong when I see it and he laughed and said ""don't inhale so deep and don't hold it in"" and I laughed with him.  (wink, wink)

I actually found it very pleasurable and relaxing.  It didn't make me sick to my stomach like when I have tried cigarettes!

It's hard not to patronize a place with such pleasant people.  I am definitely going to give it a second try with a group of people and have some food this time.",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,2,2,4,5MUpH3aNtJHtWq6pqFggBg

3848019,2018-04-28,0,Bhj4G0ArZqRvz9DprbNX3A,"Hookahs here are terrible. It tastes burnt and hits your throat right from the START. It feels like they don't wash their hookahs or just don't know how to pack it but regardless you should be able to taste the flavor you choose, not just a burnt flavor. The hookahs here used to be decent but now it's garbage. If you want a GOOD hookah experience I recommend Luna Hookah Lounge of Olive Hookah Lounge. For $18 you'll get a MUCH better hookah. 

As for the food here, it's not bad. It's good food but it's over-priced. 12-13 for a sandwich. Again though it's worth it if you're feeling the food. 


I'm more than willing to change this review if their hookahs become better. Nobody wants to pay $18 to smoke a hookah that's un-smokable. 

As a hookah lounge you guys should be serving 
1. Well packed hookahs
2. In premium hookahs
3. With good tobacco
4. And in clean hookahs. 

After that you need to make sure you guys are using the right amounts of tobacco and the right hookah bowls. Again, this used to be our favorite hookah place, you guys used to serve good hookahs so I'm sure you know how to fix this.",pvD3VyZ-c3Q08wSGAFxhUw,0,0,1,GFoYlWGTtL3CLTqvul-Uzw

Layla was right across the street. Even better for our night owl eating habits, it was still open, and stays open past 2:00 a.m. Perfect!

It may have a different, more brightly lit, ambiance during the day, when our waiter, Nis... (can't remember it exactly) said that it's busy with people eating. At this hour, most customers were here for the hookah; that may explain why the music was so loud. I love any music with a beat, even hip hop, which was part of the mix. But the booming bass made conversation difficult when that genre was playing. That won't stop us from coming back, because the food was absolutely delicious! 

I didn't try Shakshuka when I was in Israel, and I have a lot of recipes for it; but I don't do a lot of cooking, so I was thrilled to see it on the menu and get to try it for the first time. It was listed under the Breakfast heading, but that didn't matter. We decided to share that, along with a Sabih sandwich. Our waiter patiently explained the veggie combinations in that big sandwich, and it sounded differently delicious. And both items were just that: the smoky tomato-based vegetables were the perfect base for the eggs nestled on top. I'm already craving it again. The sandwich was unusual, but in a good way; a little messy, but he noticed and was quick to bring more napkins. We're not vegetarians, but I Iuvvv vegetables, so both items we ordered were beyond excellent.

Though I'm from the generation that started it all, and can't say that I ""didn't inhale,"" I really wasn't familiar with the mechanics of the hookah. That was remedied when our waiter sat down and gave me a full lesson!

I had a mojito which tasted more like spiked water & the first bowl of hookah we had kept getting harsh. We had it for about 15 minutes until we requested a different bowl of shisha. I thought it was odd that I was still charged for the first bowl even though we kept having a lot of problems with it. At other hookah places I've gone to, if I was having problems with the bowl I wouldn't be charged for it, so I did find that rather odd. I probably caught them on an off-day because I've never had a problem with their hookah getting harsh fast. The second bowl we received was perfect, so the first one was probably a fluke.

I love Lebanese food and I have not found a place on the West Coast that knows how to make shawarma. I was hoping this place did...nope. First of all you need to have the machine to rotate and cook the lamb. The meat does not taste the same on the grill. Then you need to have a panini grill to toast the sandwich after you roll it up. I still have to go back to Dearborn, Michigan to get a good shawarma sandwich.

That being said, I will say they have a cool little hookah lounge. They have nice drink menu and food menu as well. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. I just want a real shawarma sandwich!! I think the owners are Israeli, so that would explain the different style of some of the cooking. They make shawarma sandwiches way different.

1) The customer service is EXCELLENT! The staff are always insanely friendly and attentive.  My glass never hits empty before I'm asked if I'm all set or if I need another, but there's never any pressure to keep buying or drinking.  They aren't at all pushy or overbearing.  Sit for an hour puffing a hookah with a bottle of water and they're totally cool.

2) The hookahs are damn good.  These guys know how to keep just the right amount of continual coal on top without charring or getting harsh.  Pick a new flavor and just dont like it....they will replace it without batting an eye.

3) This was my first time in since they remodeled and its beautiful.  The venue now matches the quality of the service and product.  Comfy couches, very open and the air handling keeps the place clear and fresh, even with a room full of hookhas burning away.

4) The hummus and pitas (all I've ever had here) are excellent, fresh, and the perfect accoutrements to the well made drinks.

If you've never tried a hookah, check the place out!  Great for a midday break or to start/end a night with your friends.",9xMDoI8ZR-NQ6HgJcEetpQ,1,1,5,EFNKZudJC9j4_vX9lk4OKQ

The hookah has always just been ok, but the bowls are always over packed. The coal replenishment sucks and they constantly being out small, half used coals. I've never been able to enjoy a bowl for more than 45 minutes. The last visit no one checked on us for coals or food, we just had to walk to the bar.

I will say that they have some of the best hummus I've had though. The food seems pretty too notch all the way around.

The one reason that I have officially decided not to go there anymore is the music. This place is too God Damn small to have music that Damn loud. I might as well go alone because we have never been able to have a conversation there. Last night I left with a splitting head ache and I could feel my ears pulsing and throbbing. On top of the noise, the music they play is Shit. You just can't go there and chill.

They said the Hookah was just OK compared to other places but not bad.  The price was a little higher but the service was super fast and they were very friendly.  I only give four stars due to what they stated about the flavor of the Hookah and the price.  However, I did order the cheese sticks which were only $5 so that was cheap and although I have a feeling they were just frozen cheese sticks they were actually really good and I meant to ask them what brand they were.  They only have hot black tea and hot green tea which is another reason we would have preferred another spot that had better options for that.  Overall, if the kids wanted to go earlier in the day again we would go to this spot due to the service, the hours and maybe appetizers.

So imagine my surprise when the one thing she wanted to do to mark the occasion was to...smoke hookah??  I personally hadn't done that in well over 6+ years.  28 reviews and counting with consistent 5 star reviews lead us to Layla.

Although it's a small place that can cater to maybe 6 groups total, it's like a really cool guy's basement.  That really cool guy happens to also be named Guy.  He recognized my wife and I instantly since we lived in the same apartment complex a couple of years ago and had neighboring parking spots.  Throughout our visit, Guy was super friendly, attentive and made us feel very welcome.  The big leather couches you sit on INSIST that you stay a while.       

We were informed that all their food was homemade so trying the falafel and hummus appetizer was an absolute must for me.  Their falafel rivals any other joint as the best in LV, crunchy outside and flavorful green inside.  I could tell right away that the hummus was homemade.  It tasted more like a super thick tahini sauce than your average hummus but I thought it accompanied the falafel really well.  I'll be sure to get it again.  We also got an order of stuffed grape leaves and a nice basket of freshly toasted pita.  Guy also hooked us up with a couple of pieces of baklava which made for a nice ending to the meal.

Hookah time.  Lots of choices and my wife chose their ""pina colada"" which was fine and tasted as advertised.  3 bricks would have been enough for 4-6 people to smoke let alone two.

Count on me as a repeat customer!  At the very least I'll order their great Middle Eastern food to go since they're open so late or we'll lounge out the next time my wife has ""the itch"".",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,32,29,5,J7DX-izVrgbvLTiHfXrQrA

Loved the ambience of this place. Great music and great food.

As a group, we ordered lemon mint hookah, hummus/falafel plate, and onion rings. We also asked the person working for water as well. 

The ONLY thing I didn't like about this place is that they gave us a water bottle to charge us instead of just water on ice. I know it's for the business, but assumptions are a no go. 

The food was good, the portion was pretty good for a group of three. The pita bread was super fresh and hot when we received it too.

Thick smoke is always the best and the flavor was just as good too AAAAAND the music was good and super chill. Such a plus. This place will probably be my go to spot for chill nights and hookah sessions. Highly recommend it to my friends and peers.",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,2,1,4,84pDhtoTmM7_YUg0gaz-0g

We celebrated our friends birthday here and we brought a cake but before we brought the cake in we asked could we bring it in. One gentleman stated it was $10.00 for us to bring it in and we were okay with paying that. The second guy who stated he was the boss stopped us as we were approaching our friend to sing him happy birthday and took the cake from us blew out the candles himself and threw the cake away. Not only did he throw the cake away he took it out the trash can and tried to give it back to us and say that he didn't throw it. What were we going to do with a cake that was thrown in the trash. You wouldn't eat it or use it why would we. I should not have even given the 1 star because they don't deserve that much with how disrespectful the ""boss"" is. The guy who gave us the okay managed to give us cash back but the ""boss"" threw the money at my friend like she was the help.",is7S3ZHSjDmbTSfbJlQFYQ,0,0,1,6vsLtBqA5PEZpvuShZMHfA

Servers and bartenders are usually attentive, BUT don't go on a night where they have reservations for large groups because you WILL get ignored.",iqfWLGR_ysB7mxTgp31d-g,0,0,3,RL5MCK-38SHBJDXIKCIsBA

First of their pita chicken shawarma with Israeli salad and hummus inside is literally the best shawarma I ever had. I cannot find a better or as equal shawarma in Northern California ( still searching). Their hookahs are great as well, never had an issue with it not hitting or having to call them over to fix it. They know what they are doing. I mainly come back here for the food! The customer service is great as well. They have never let me down even on their most busiest nights.",9Dd1fLx93JRGypYC_3i9Zw,1,1,5,_txaQUSrsitPftPTa06yIg

Absolutely love it , only problem is there is always only 1 server and I feel like he can't handle it , takes a while to get our food every time we come in ... Food is excellent though !!! I would recommend it but definitely be prepared to wait a while for the food ....",6oq2TfWXX6CeHuAxsl14fQ,0,0,4,XSBWgmlJq1AQL5JABgewIg

I had a misinterpretation with one of the employees, although the owner contacted me and justified everything, apologizing for his actions and invited me back. Tuesday is karaoke night and it's very packed, you need to reserve a table fyi just to clarify!! But this is a great hookah lounge in southwest! 5/5",jEr99iuvhTgdKS8-NyMvaA,2,1,5,-SiI9LWpZZZG4scli0yT3w
