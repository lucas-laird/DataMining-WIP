I did not want to order up so I just asked for a chicken quesadilla.  It was made in a speedy fashion despite it being lunch time.  It seemed everyone was not in the mood for the DT's fantastic speedy mex.  Lucky for me, I grabbed and rolled to a free parking spot to give myself some speedy calories.  It was then that I spied a female walking over to parking block, sticking her finger down her throat and vomiting for what seemed five minutes.  I thought to myself.....odd.  Should I be disgusted and perhaps throw up myself?  NO WAY!  It's Vegas and DT is awesome.  I just want to say in closing, who knows where the female came from because I was a few lots away from the DT I had just ordered from.

I eat here a couple times a week because it is quick, cheap and tastes as good as you can get for a Mexican fast food chain. I always get coupons in the mail and use all but the chicken ones because why people come here for chicken is beyond me. This last time I used a coupon that got me a macho combo burrito for just $2! I was all over that. I change it up from time to time and get it either double wrapped, or all beef no beans, maybe some extra red AND green sauce, it just depends on my mood. The macho combo burrito is filling and not intended for the weak. My wife has a hard enough time finishing a half pound burrito and usually just sticks to the value bean and cheese burrito for only .50 cents. It was Tuesday taco night so I got 6 soft tacos (3 no lettuce for the fur-baby) as well. taco night is every Tuesday from 3pm - 11pm and regular tacos are 3 for $1.09 or you can upgrade to 3 classic tacos for a $1 more. My tacos were as good as always. I also tried this new crunchtada tostada. It tastes like the tostada they already have on the menu, but you can get it with beef or chicken if you don't just want beans, cheese and sauce. The crunchtada was just ok.

DT offers different breakfast deals that are worth checking out. Save your receipt to use for a free 1/2 pound bean and cheese in your next visit. Don't forget to save room for caramel cheesecake bites.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,6,7,5,Bv0O11bRfCyVaoAVQEfGYg

It's one of the chains that I feel like the food is actually better than ""South of the Border"" (reference to the old Taco Bell slogan if you're too young to remember).

Great food, and it's super fast.   I noticed that through the drive-thru, they actually have a timer set on the drive-thru window.   I actually dislike this method of management for food since sometimes you get some really crappy wrapped up food or what not.   It is fast food, but no reason to completely screw up someone's order due to a timer.

It turns out to be one of those things where expectations shouldn't be had.  The thing is the Del Taco commercial asking ""would you rather have jumbo eyebrows or jumbo teeth?..."" sent me a subliminal message.  I swore there's something else behind the strange ad.

And there was!  Seven jumbo battered shrimp later - hugged up in cabbage shreds, rice, and pick de gallo, I'm full, I'm satisfied, I stand corrected by my earlier presumption about the tapered tortilla wrap.  If there were anything I'd add to the pretty good flavor, it would be cilantro and maybe three slices of pickled jalapeno.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,40,38,4,2J1Q5wd6lY5jKcGzWWwyfg

I love how quick they make the food to making it a great breakfast/lunch/dinner spot if you are in a break from work. 

We get coupons like every week in the mail which is nice because they are coupons that are actually worth it and make it easy on your wallet. Not that there prices are high anyway but it is just a bonus.

They have had their ""Tuesday Taco Night"" for years but recently added to it which makes me super happy. You can still get 3 regular tacos (hard or soft) for $1.09 but now you can even get 3 ""Taco Deluxe""  (soft or hard) for $2.09. It has lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and salsa. So it is basically a baby ""Macho Taco"".
You can also on Thursday nights get 3 ""Grilled Chicken Tacos"" for $2.09.

I am a sucker for their ""Del Scorcho"" cause it is a must when I get a Cheddar Quesadilla. 

They have a e-club and if you sign up you automatically get free Grilled Chicken Quesadillas and other coupons from time to time.

Each item of your order is repeated back to you as you order, with MANY pauses in between, as well as repeated in its entirety again at the end. It is so slow that they actually sound rather incompetent. So much time is wasted placing your order, that when you drive around to the pick up window they immediatley hand you the order and ask for payment. This sounds great, but they don't even give you a chance to put your car in park, or gather your money in order to pay.

They need to learn which hot sauce packets are mild, medium, and hot.  That's why I gave them 4 stars and not 5.  Other than that, I recommend this Del Taco location.",4_cGIuyL3HG3-65RrXU_lw,1,0,4,l58VfExf7kGPJVExEXsUZA
5119885,2014-08-27,0,YNUdy-W_ZFO9B2SZUKRrPw,I love del taco. It is 10x better than Taco Bell. The people there were SO friendly. They said they loved us and gave us quality food. The chirps were to die for and the lemonade was so good. I can't wait to go back and devour some meat.,1WvrCK6SFLLpBKjWWzIjQA,0,0,5,4D9F9rXGDamEpmmqRUonrw
5199383,2010-12-09,15,YNUdy-W_ZFO9B2SZUKRrPw,"No, you are not hallucinating. I am reviewing Del Taco. Actually, consider this an extended quick tip.

Scenario: It's 1:20pm. I haven't eaten a darn thing, and I have a meeting at 2:00. This is when I end up at the Del.  I order up a bean burrito with lettuce, onions and cilantro. These are the goods you can add for no extra charge, so .99 and I have acceptable sustenance. Don't forget the Del Scorcho!

This is exactly what happened today, and this location delivered superior results lightning fast. The burrito was ready before we had time to pick out our hot sauces. 

Remember: lettuce, onions and cilantro are free. If you get greedy and ask for tomatoes, they're gonna charge you like .70. I don't understand the vegetable hierarchy. I just know how to work the system. When we ordered, the cashier gave us the nod and said, ""That's the way to do it."" Looks like I am changing my ""Don't Tell Anyone But..."" to ""I know Del Taco's insider secrets.""",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,10,4,Rh7O82h6IQUkYVfMWZoOGw

5516484,2014-04-26,1,YNUdy-W_ZFO9B2SZUKRrPw,"We tried Del Taco for the first time last month after a friend shared her fish taco with me. My partner loves Taco Bell, but I was bored and wanted something different. 

There are similarities between Taco Bell and Del Taco but I think Del Taco wins- more variety is the key. I don't like the bland tortilla chips, though- gotta give that to Taco Bell. Don't like the cheese sauce, either, so Taco Bell wins the nachos battle. 

The real winner are the tacos. I love the shrimp and fish tacos- flavorful with a mix of textures to make them interesting. Those soft corn tortillas are the bomb. Now, I know nothing about ""real"" fish tacos but I thought fried fish was probably not authentic- but what do I know? It's still tasty. It's fast food so I don't expect much.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,1,1,3,YM5t236ekyvrxFdzBnYByA
5521029,2015-04-02,0,YNUdy-W_ZFO9B2SZUKRrPw,"Del Taco messed with the wrong pregnant lady tonight. Never in my life have I been so upset with an order I received in the drive thru that I actually got in my car to go back after sitting down to eat, until tonight. I just wanted chicken soft tacos, but instead I got tortillas stuffed full of lettuce and cheese with 3-4 little bits of chicken with an average size of my pinkie nail, the largest no bigger than my thumb nail. Soft tacos aren't that big, I can't believe it was too much to expect that I could at least get a little chicken with every bite.",jEs0S7Qd6R7wmJArRr10BA,1,0,1,ZO1rTHDYuqfXzj2Q9BCEng

This is the new 4th meal baby! Kick that taco bell out the curb and order some chipotle soft/hard tacos. Even them carbon tacos aka. street tacos. I'd take this over Taco Bell any day. I'm not really a fan of fast food, but I like this place alright! Bean burrito with green sauce FTW over taco bell's bean burrito thas fasho.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,0,0,3,1RSq833b4nhboIKT9O24ow

This one was told by manager after my order was placed that he messed up my order. Instead of the manager adjusting the order once the mistake was caught, the over-charge of my meal left me ticked. Will NOT be back. Massive #fail on many levels!",4fE37HSVJitQlI78K8uM1A,2,2,1,KAsywydeJA6XjT4FvXw7AQ
