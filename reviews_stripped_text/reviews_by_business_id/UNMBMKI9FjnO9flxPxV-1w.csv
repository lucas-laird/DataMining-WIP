137056,2016-10-15,3,UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w,"Well this is awkward. I do not take a bad review lightly. So, I just called to order a pizza from here, as it has been a while, and was told that I was red flagged in their system to not have my order taken. For what you might ask? Well, let me begin by saying I am never rude nor do I not pay my bill. I am polite and always tip very well. That being said let us go ahead and explore my last experience with Papa Pinny's Pizzeria. I ordered a pizza, it arrived late and cold, I accepted the pizza in my hands and tipped the driver, and upon opening the pizza box in my kitchen it was very apparent the top of the pizza had shifted as if the delivery driver took a very, very, sharp turn...  Like a U turn... which led to the pizza topping shifting a good third worth over. So when I saw this, considering how much was spent on the pie (They are by no means a cheap pizzeria), I called and politely said that I was not satisfied with the quality of the pizza as it arrived. I mean.. Hell yes I want a pizza to arrive looking like a pizza with the toppings intact, who doesn't? The person who answered the phone said they would sent out a new pizza, when the new pizza arrived the delivery driver curtly requested I return the damaged pizza, which I did. I did not choose post anything at the time because I do not like to post negative reviews and understand that sometimes things just happen. We were satisfied with the new pizza and its condition. So, this bad review is because Papa Pinny's Pizzeria clearly does not take responsibility for a poor product that was clearly their error. Shame on them.",PPNtP0cTDDzGftQWTgzq9w,0,0,1,n08aaFCd4gpPID3AbGAzwQ

294567,2016-12-22,2,UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w,"We drove out of our way from the Strip because of the Yelp ratings. 

We got the Pinny Signature pizza. It was good, but not awesome or anything outstanding. The pizza knots were ok, but nothing memorable. The sauce for the pizza and the knots were too tomatoey for my liking and lacked typical Italian seasoning. Got the six-piece wings (hot) and they came with an order of fries. The wings and fries were both good and worthwhile. 

Service was meh. The server either wasn't paying much attention or something else was amiss. Kept having to repeat and reclarify the order. There wasn't any language barrier, so I don't know...

While she was attentive, she gave off the aire of hovering over us -which was both annoying and creepy. She also stood behind the refrigeration/display counter staring in our direction when not hovering -no doubt she was watching the game on TV -but it was creepy. 

I'm glad others have had good experiences here. But there are other choices for independent Mom&Pop pizzeria fare -and I think we will continue to shop around.",lPdpluDj1F0amchnGIyujg,0,0,3,0jO7pOMyWlfLhgR0cHNlFg
342617,2017-06-17,1,UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w,"Wow that was weird!  :-P

I just placed an order for delivery from Papa Pinny's and the subtotal without tax or anything added on was $23.  With tax and everything else it came to $29.  I asked to apply a coupon that came attached to their menu for $3 off a $20 order because it qualified by $3 and change.  

The cashier is new and needed to call her boss Jason (or James?) in order to apply the discount.  After a prolonged hold she told me that they would NOT honor the coupon because the taxes can't count toward the order.  

I told her that answer didn't make any sense, and reconfirmed that my subtotal was $23 without taxes, which should amply qualify my order for the coupon.  She agreed.  I asked to speak with her boss but she said he wasn't there, she had to call him on the phone.  

Rather than wait another 20 minutes to get the food underway I just put the order on my card without the discount and told her that I would Yelp it.  I'm blown away that in this age of Yelp and Social Media, a pizza joint would refuse to honor their own coupon.",WleoUwuThl-lhYulljiWxQ,4,0,2,n2ConL4PkG7hImaBAnIImg

Your business response makes me sure that I will never be returning to your establishment. On top of the pizza being thick, it was gross. I tried to call your restaurant the next day, and it was closed, otherwise I would've dropped what you describe as ""pizza"" off. Your server even explained to me that the cook was new. It was a half-and-half pizza, nothing crazy off the menu and it still was done incorrectly and, instead of your restaurant taking fault, you blame me for being incoherent when clearly the server understood me if my pizza was the correct half-and-half but just thick and gross.

Crust was good, sauce had flavor, and there was plenty of cheese. Order arrived on time, if not a bit early. It's rare for me to do delivery, but this is a place I'd keep in mind for the future. Four stars!

Second: Came in to pick up an order of pasta. Location is cozy, staff was polite, order was again ready quickly. The chicken piccata has protein, pasta, a bread stick and a side salad, all nicely priced for $14. Unfortunately, the sauce makes this dish and it was lackluster. Something was missing, it was just okay. The side salad was ordered with bleu cheese dressing which seemed to be either a cheap bottled brand or made in-house by someone who doesn't know it. It was gross and ruined the salad. Two stars?

Third: Ordered takeout again, got the antipasto salad with the bruschetta app. Ton of food, around $15. The bruschetta was fine but the salad was a bust. Looked more like a plate of cold cuts with meats and cheeses on a scant handful of spring mix. ""House italian"" dressing was a creamy version that was gross and brown? The whole thing looked and tasted like it was made by someone who doesn't like salads for other people who don't like salads. But the bruschetta was good. Three stars it is.

TLDR: Stick to the pizza and maybe the appetizers. Order pickup or delivery through the app, they're quick and friendly.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,28,17,3,HW4BFDIRt2Mn59KEN91mfQ

The grilled chicken in the Alfredo was the only thing that saved the dish and was pretty good. We also had a side of meatballs which the sauce also tasted like it came straight out of a can.

The calzone was pretty good. It was stuffed with delicious ricotta and mozzarella cheese, and I got pepperoni and Mushrooms as toppings. The zone came with a side of marinara sauce which was tasty.

This isn't the first time we have been here. Treated my daughter (5 years old) to a candle lit dinner last night and it was great so it reminded me to review. I didn't review in the past, because I loved the pizza but the spinach salad was sooooo greasy, and I wanted to only give a 4 or a 5 cuz I know they're trying. Waited it out and they've since removed that salad from the menu, ha! 

I was at the mercy of the kindergartener, so we ended up with a cheese pizza and Caesar salad. I really liked the Caesar. Perfectly dressed...not crazy amounts of dressing. 

Pizza is surprisingly good here. The crust is crisp on the bottom and sides, and chewy. I recently saw this Yelp type influencers posting videos of some pizza place that uses scissors and the guy citing talks about the ""crack crack""...it's just like that. I like the semi tart sauce. Cheese is a little greasy since it's normal shredded mozzarella (as opposed to the buffalo mozzarella like Grimaldi's, or whatever they use there), but a very satisfying pizza. 

They brought us this super tasty garlic bread (basically a super buttered, super toasted soft hoagie), complimentary. 

Sit down service can be slow because there are only a few tables, and the server (who we've had every time) has to answer phones, be a hostess, put together Grub Hub orders, etc. She is a super sweet lady and I tip her 50% every time. I know she is trying her best and I appreciate her.

The pizza? Not a fan. I ordered their version of a margarita (sp?) and one half pepperoni half cheese. 

As soon as I took a slice of the first, the tomato and one basil leaf with a slice of unmelted mozzarella slid off entirely. The pizza is covered in sauce and they place a regular slice of tomato, one leaf of basil, and a slice of fresh mozzarella. The mozzarella is poor quality. It didn't melt and the consistency and flavor were totally off. It tasted like rubber. I wanted to give it another chance, but the second slice was completely soggy. Wet pizza crust from the tomato and too much sauce. Would not recommend ordering. 

The second pizza I took a slice of and because the ratio of cheese to crust was out of balance, the toppings came completely off. 

Way too much cheese for a super thin crust. The texture of the crust was ok, but the crust doesn't have enough salt in the dough. The sauce is ok. A bit tart, but decent if not completely drowned by cheese.

We were eating the knots then the pizza came in hot & fresh the cheese was zooey & cheesy it was New York style the crust was light and crispy. I had two slices I got full quick.

The onions and green peppers were fresh and crisp not soggy Now the sauce is homemade in the best way! Great seasoning! The crust was crisp on the edges and tender and flavorful. Homemade dough is the secret! Man, do they have it right, all of it! Now the catcher, I called to give my praise and Rosy answered I asked to speak to the manager, Rosy politely related that they do not have a manager, yet a owner and he was with a customer, "" Could she take a message"". I went in and praised my order from wait time, to the sauce, to delivery driver John. Best online order experience I have ever had! No question about it! Now just a little back story, I throw down in the kitchen in all styles of food, so I know my way around the kitchen. I bake,cook,grill and make all my own breads and dough. I make pizza as well, and let me to tell you, this pizza and wings made me do the happy dance and want more! I just moved today, and afterwards, did not want to cook, after being in the hot, muggy, humid air. I was skeptical, reading the reviews, I decided to give Papa Pinny's Pizzeria my coin and I am elated I did! I have lived here since 1990, and it is really hard to find a great pizza place, pizza hut has been mine because I got tired of paying big bucks to only get disappointed. I can vouch , not the case here, I hope Pappa stays around for the rest of my years in this life and then some! Don't change a thing Pappa! Don't get overwhelmed with profit margin and cut corners, and whatever you do Pappa, DO NOT FIRE ROSY OR JOHN, HECK THE PIZZA MAKER EITHER!! I appericate you!",tfLy-9XaEn3f6_UuupeH9A,1,2,5,s7rYWwjJ-BI22-LmLXi3Gg

Nice side pizza cut into decent size slices.  The combination of ingredients was great, but best of all, was the dough.  Their dough blows everything I've tried lately out of the water.  I recommend ordering their pizza, I know I will  definitely be ordering from them again.

Ordered exact same pizza, never been so disappointed or seen such inconsistency. The pizza was extremely extremely greasy, flavor was off, missing meatballs and green olives, and was just really not very good.. will not order from them again, the pizza was terrible this time",Uh6DToB8too37cPVwbkHEw,3,0,1,2-xdZl9mIFt12sT8wUqPvg

The customer service is great! I brought  coupons with me the server let me know which one would be the most beneficial.  My drink was also topped off often so that is always a plus for me.

I didn't want to review after my first pizza' it was delicious, but a mess. I ordered sausage and green pepper and the sauce was to die for. I also ordered chicken parm done perfectly! I thought this was gonna be my place! So I ordered again last night, just pizza and wings and, once again, the pizza was a mess. All the ingredients had slid to the side and cheese was resealed. You know the look. The crust is so good, the sauce perfect, but they can't get it to your house cut and toppings spread all over. I don't know what the problem is but when you receive your pizza like that, you can't get that perfect, cheesy first bite. And of course, the left overs are a mess, had to tear the pizza in where I thought the slice was. Disappointed, this would have been my new pizza home.

The crust was thin, but easily held up to the mountain of toppings without getting soggy...throughout the whole meal. My son and the grandkids constantly commented on how good it was, too. I apologize to my daughter for ruining them on cheap pizza, but even the non-crust eaters ate the crust. The toppings are super generous. You could barely see the pizza under the ham on my son's half. For a supreme pizza lover, this is the place. Go for the super, 

Heck, one of the kids noted that the Coke tasted like McDonald's Coke. I can vouch for that statement. Some places have their mix a little too syrupy, but this was spot on. They have a nice espresso machine, so they may have a great water filtration system, too.

Seating are clean and inviting.  You can see back into the kitchen which was equally clean.  Awesome!

We were greeted and waited on by the manager, Dave who made us feel welcome.  He told us about the place, how long they had been there, etc...  It was just pretty cool to chat with him.

I kept it pretty simple for my first time in, I got a 2 slice lunch special and my daughter got the spaghetti.  Both were amazing!  I have been back several times since but always get pizza, it is that great.

They do have a chef there, not a ""cook"" who makes some great looking dishes.  I have seen what others around me are eating and I keep saying I am going to try something different, but I always stick with what I know.

Also now, our friend Rosie works there! We know her from way back and the most friendliest person you can meet.

I don't think it's my responsibility to heat it up more especially when I'm paying for a product that should be ready to eat. I was so disappointed :-( The garlic knots were also much smaller and not as good as before. The 3 stars is for the quality of food this time around where as before I would've rated it 5 stars.

Last evening, we enjoyed a very expensive family meal. This evening, we were looking for a good Italian meal that wouldn't require a second mortgage. Frankly, I was hesitant to dine at a pizzeria because we wanted a sit-down meal and more than pizza. Papa Pinny's was a great choice.

From our salads, garlic knots and garlic bread starters, to our entrées, that included chicken marsala and salmon, everything was exceptional. Rosie, our server, was very attentive and made terrific recommendations. I rarely give five star ratings but Papa Pinny's deserves it.

I ordered a 12"" pizza from Papa Pinny's Pizzeria, thru UberEATS (sorry, Yelp!). It is the first time I've ordered from them. I had a 12"" pizza with black olives, fresh garlic, anchovies, and shrimp. Loved the garlic, but it was very strong, so consider that if your date isn't gonna eat it with you!

I choose Papa Pinney's because 1. I'd never tried them before, 2. My usual go-tos were all closed, 3. They offer shrimp as a topping, one of the few places in Las Vegas that do, and 4. I always like to try new places. I'm constantly in search of the best!

Papa Pinney's pleasantly surprised me. A true New York style pizza, with a crusty rim but soft under crust, perfect for folding; a very fresh-tasting tomato sauce, and nice, melty Italian cheeses. I put it in a 250° oven for a few minutes, box and all, when it arrived, because delivery pizza inevitably ends up being delivered lukewarm. It was delicious!

I subtracted one star for two reasons: Their smallest pizza is a 12"", way too big for two people with small appetites and smaller wallets (although I'm betting this very good pizza will be great tomorrow, too); and although I'm thankful for the shrimp, please, Papa Pinney, remove the tails from the shrimp and chop them up, so I can have a bite of shrimp with each mouthful!

A hearty recommendation for this local pizzeria. If they chop the shrimp and offer a 10"" pizza, I'll upgrade my review to five stars!",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,1,4,d0xxCxGaPZKxQ2Vb8tWl6g

We came in from L.A. and drove across town from where we were staying because we had heard good things. There's tons of places you can get pizza in Vegas, but from now on, in my mind- there is only ONE. PAPA PINNY'S!!!

We were immediately welcomed by Kiana and Tom who were both incredibly friendly. The restaurant is charming and inviting. It's exactly what a traditional pizzeria should be. We hit them up on a Monday night not during peak hours, so they weren't busy- but that may have been the best timing ever. 

We ordered garlic knots and a supreme pizza. After we ordered, Kiana came out to offer us some complimentary wine. Shortly after that, Papa Pinny himself came out to introduce himself to us and talk with us about our experience. He also offered us some complimentary wine. Did I mention that he brought us out some complimentary garlic bread? Delicious garlic bread. Some of the best garlic bread I've ever had. 

Really cool to watch a hand-tossed pizza being made like a true artist like Tom! And the pizza was delicious. Perfect mix of sauce and toppings. Loved it. 

Like I said- the food is outstanding, but not even the best part of the experience. The best part is the people. Everyone was so incredibly kind and friendly. Tom and Papa Pinny kept coming over to visit. And there was a nice gentleman there named Scott. We talked a lot. We talked about hockey. We talked about Los Angeles and Vegas and Hughes Aircraft and you can tell- these people care about their customers. And it wasn't phony. These people are just genuinely cool, kind people. How often do you walk out of a pizza place feeling loved and respected? How often do you walk out of a pizza place feeling like you've made new friends? Feeling like family.

Papa Pinny has a guest book for everyone to sign. We were glad to sign it. And at one point, Papa came to take a picture with the family. We were told they were collecting photos of happy customers to put up on the wall at some point. 

Long story short: I can't say enough good things about this place. And we love the people. We will be back. I can't wait to come back.  And maybe next time we'll take the challenge of the massive square cut pizza they offer!

Such as Roma deli for a great lunch or Nora's for great sit down dinner.,fp2KiLfoIO9OIUV2KHkgEA,3,0,2,7KPAQujNaZJcrdSknPRlig

I highly recommend the garlic knots as an appetizer.  You will not be disappointed. We always get the thin crust and love, love, love this pizza.

Pizza's not the best but edible when you haven't had nothing all day. Being from the east coast Manhattan, what I like to do sometimes is a slice taste test and It would've been cool if they had slices any hr instead only during lunch time specials. It was evening and needed a quick bite but had to settle for a small pie. They probably were running out of sauce cause the 12inch I ordered didn't had much and it was like a light spread coating, the dough and cheese is what filled me up instead. I should've ask to put it back in the oven and cook it more for a mild darker edge cause the crust was too softy bread white all around. Maybe if I'm across the way next time I'll go for a well done thin crust. The women behind the counter was courteous and friendly thou. It's aaiight as we say ..",kxaSbX0427uT_77A6GdS4g,0,0,3,wD4xIBhB02P8YqrQ3mQHMQ

5876198,2018-02-14,15,UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w,"I came for the garlic knots, I stayed for the pizza.

After reading the reviews about the garlic knots I decided they sounded worth driving across town for. Y'all were right and for that, I thank you! Covered in buttery goodness and chunks of real garlic, I'm a fan. I honestly would just order those along next time with extra sauce. Pay for the extra sauce people and dunk your little hearts out.

The pizzas were simply okay. I had their signature supreme and although it was loaded with toppings, it lacked in the cheese and sauce. The crust was delicious. A little crunch and a whole lotta flavour. The white pizza was delicious in flavour but the crust was a miss for me. Perhaps I could order the white pizza with the supreme crust next time? I dunno! I'll have to ask.

I did drive across town and back for the order (we're talking 20 minutes and then some each way) so no points deducted for the food not being hot. When I picked up the boxes the food was piping hot and my car smelled of marinara and garlic for days. I was able to order pickup through the Yelp app, my order was accurate, and the staff was super nice.

I was surprised to see the intimate space set up like a little Italy. Different styles of tables and chairs for your to dine in. They even have a few tables set up outside. It would be a really cute little date night spot. It's true love if you both order your own garlic knots and don't mind kissing after.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,24,19,4,lx_Vguxw-3f0fSo0nPraTw

5908551,2018-05-18,0,UNMBMKI9FjnO9flxPxV-1w,"To support local biz, We've been going here at least every other week. It's close to home, and the pizza is satisfactory. However this last time, they got my pizza order wrong, and then did not double cut as we always get, and then argued about the situation after the fact. Not that hard guys. 

I didn't blame the order taker or the pizza cook. But a guy came from the back and was totally disrespectful, full of profanity. I called for the owner who came from the back.  He was rather apologetic, but the guy from the back continued with the profanities. I could  not believe it. Giovanni , the owner, stood there and listened to him shout profanities and did nothing.  He disappeared after 2min. 

Mistakes happen. I have no problems with mistaken orders. But I cannot believe the absolute poor service, profanities, and the owner cowering to an employee, despite clear mistakes. No, i will never be back. Giovanni is the new owner. He's in for a rough year.  There are at least a half dozen pizza places within a mile from here. It's not about one pizza order, right or wong. if I'm right, they will be out of business in 18months.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,1,neXy5xXtHp61Q2nBHpeo7w

I thought the Garlic Knots were average, although I never seem to like bread appetizers as much as most people.  They were definitely loaded with garlic if that's your thing.  

Pizza was solid.  Fairly thin and relatively crispy.  Sauce a bit too thin for my tastes and I actually like it a bit cheesier and greasier.  Price is reasonable.",YcaO4xCNgt123pNHsJkS_Q,1,0,4,NWK_zpNVlKAK8TZzWZDEMA
