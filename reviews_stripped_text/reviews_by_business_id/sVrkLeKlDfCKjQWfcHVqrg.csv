90484,2013-04-28,1,sVrkLeKlDfCKjQWfcHVqrg,This is the closest Popeye's I know of to me.  If I happen to be in the area I HAVE to stop in for the red beans and rice! If I knew how to make them like they do I would! I absolutely love them and as long as the biscuits are fresh and moist they go great with the beans and rice too.  The chicken is good as well but my favorite is the rice and beans!,1tRZCWlt2BEm9FlTaaiGLw,1,1,4,d1QsHfV-d1spfsVtocoTdA

At the drive thru sat a middle aged gentleman who called himself ""Diamond.""  Diamond demanded that I roll down my window so that he could tell me about his venture into the recording arts.  He then wanted to put a CD into my stereo to listen to while I ordered my food.

I declined, then he proceeded to MF me about not supporting artists and being a cheap ass because I didn't want to give him $5 for a CD that I have never heard.  I don't even particularly enjoy rap music.  

According to ""Diamond"" he has the permission of the manager to sell his wares.  If this is in fact true, I will not be going back.

In all my years going to popeyes I've never experienced the service I experienced today. I order 24 cajun wings waited 15 min for them to drop them fresh only to get home and they be undercooked. I took the wings back they advised they would drop new wings and to wait another 15 mins. Got the second batch of wings home and they were the same wings they just refried them. Long story short the 2nd batch were disgusting and no answer when I called the restaurant. Will filing a complaint with corporate and the BBB.

I love Popeyes I swear I go but just because you are busy doesn't mean turn up the oil and cook the outside of the chicken and not the inside ... the reason why I am so upset is because when I tried to call the store they never answer the phone . After work I drove back there to explain the situation . I was not asking for a refund of money I would of been happy with a coupon or somthing . The manager Jacqueline!!! Needs to be FIRED . She sat there and had a smile on her face the whole time like it was funny . Told me she wasent going to do anything unless I have the chicken from 4 hours ago ... mind you I picked up food for a co-worker and myself on lunch . I called them while I was still on lunch 3 times and there was no answer . They when I told her what is so funny ... she started laughing . I'm going back up there tomorrow to see if there is a store manager  I can speak to . She was working at night so this might just be a shift leader manager or somthing .. I called corporate also and I'm making a follow up because she doesn't need to have a job if she wants to laugh in people's faces ... another thing !!

Parking lot is ridiculous, service is terribly slow, had to repeat my order several times and I still had to correct the person at the window. I ordered 3 of the 5 piece chicken strip meals and 1 spicy 5 strip. Then I was told that they just had a fresh batch of chicken but only had enough chicken for 2 mild and 2 spicy? Then it wasn't ready so I had to drive around to the parking lot again, which takes an impressive act in that area if you have a big vehicle. I was told to make 2 u turns basically to get back around...the light is marked for no u turns! None of the boxes were marked, we didn't get any dipping sauces we asked for, no drink carrier.

This location is an actual popeyes unlike the others that are shared with a Terrible's gas station.  Place does get pretty busy during lunch.  

The service is fair, ordering is a bit difficult because they will not give you a few separate boxes for a few pieces.  A little difficult since I'm buying for a few people.  They do provide me with paper plates so I guess it works out.  

Environment is themed to Louisana and there are plenty of tables to sit after ordering.  Parking is a plenty and it is shared with Chevron.

Had I written this review two years ago I would have given it two stars tops. The remodel and subsequent upgrades have vastly improved the quality of service that you receive via the drive up window. 

Back a couple years ago, every single time I would go there via drive thru to get a Shrimp Po' Boy and side of Cajun fries I would constantly be asked to pull around and park at the side waiting for my order. I appreciate that food was made to order but the constant need to wait was frustrating to say the least. It seems with the remodel that they also upgraded their cooking equipment to allow for quicker delivery of food items. I placed a traditional shrimp order and another sandwich for the kids. It was promptly served and the employee quickly processed my charge transaction. I would like to see them accept Apple Pay in the future, but that's a minor request. 

Overall, I think they offer a nice alternative to McDonalds and their Shrimp Po' Boy and Cajun fries are still awesome. Enjoy!",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,2,4,4,Fvy3XT2O8hsiryivO4Bxng

IF they dont mess up your order then it usually is worth the wait. But you would think the wait would be quick since you can see all of the chicken that is cooked right in front of you!

Several visits to this establishment (shame on me), have shown that they either don't care about filling the order correctly or they are too incompetent to do so.  Ask for mild they give you spicy, ask for spicy chicken they give you a wrap. Not to mention the one time I used my credit card instead of cash(which I rarely do), and my card number is compromised. I'm over this place and I've expressed my concern to their corporate office. Franchise stores like this one will tarnish the image of the company.",5WIJnQFfP0zbKJd4BYXVGQ,6,2,1,br3RNNj8tI0XzYRD25k25w

With two chicken chains in such close proximity, it was basically a coin toss. Aside from some confusion at the window regarding the beverages, the service was ok.

3851389,2018-05-22,0,sVrkLeKlDfCKjQWfcHVqrg,"So I went here with my family about five minutes ago. When I ordered an eight piece mild they said it would take 15 to 20 minutes. Cool, I thought it shouldn't take that long considering I used to work at a Popeyes and I was the assistant manager for a store, I know how it works. Well, 40 minutes later...still no chicken...and my kids and I were sitting in the parking lot the whole time. So here we are sitting in very very hot temperature waiting for chicken and I had enough!  I decided to drive up to the drive-through and ask them where is our food and the guy at the window said we were looking for you but we couldn't find you. I said that's impossible I was literally 15 feet away from your drive-through window if you could clearly see me and I was next to the bus stop...stop lying! They said that they sent somebody out to come look for us but I highly doubt that. Because, again, 15 feet in front of your window if you could see me I could see you and I did not see anybody looking for us. Pathetic. I asked if they could hook it up with some free food for a consolation because if you wait 40 minutes at least give us something for it. Am I wrong in this? The guy said no and then closed the window on me. Very unprofessional and I am completely embarrassed my kids were hungry and had to let them know that we had to wait 40 minutes for something that I could've easily made myself. If this is the case I am never coming back to this location if this is how they treat customers. Never mind that I used to work at a Popeyes but the fact of the matter is that they want to say how much customers are always right is bogus now and that this franchise has changed since I used to work for it!",wdptzCd80-RokFuaufVDFQ,0,0,1,cdsK8ZgTwT9kze2fMWjm_Q
