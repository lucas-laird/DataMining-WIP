2858859,2017-12-18,0,0xNSLnqLT5miZO9RqSvbhw,My family tried these for the first time at First Friday last month and fell in love! So much so my daughter wanted them for her 15th birthday party! Each person at the party picked their flavor and absolutely loved them! So moist and delicious! My favorite - Circus Animal Cheesecake! We ended up arguing which ones were the best! Great service - delivered right to my door! Will definitely recommend and will order again! Thank you Heavenly Jars for making my girls birthday 100%,OJJRE-ZbLkBfqz-hZ6x6zQ,0,0,5,RGwV1xypkpI3JAUO_FoKag
